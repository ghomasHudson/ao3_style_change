Hank – well, Tony had to say he hadn't seen that one coming, not from Hank of all people, but maybe that was what the other one had been saying, maybe this was what he'd missed, wait, no, what if he was an hallucination too – sneered.
Tomorrow the President would make him Director of SHIELD, and at the same time announce the global amnesty for all the rogue heroes, granted they weren't, actually, outright murderers like Frank Castle – Captain America, of course, wasn't in the deal, because Tony didn't make miracles, but what was certain was that there would be no death sentence, and, as long as Steve didn't act like his bullheaded self during his trial, as long as he admitted to having done some things he shouldn't have, even if he still stood by his beliefs, the most he'd get would probably be a few months and possibly a probation with the Thunderbolts – which would do them a lot of good, if even one of them could use their ears for something else than listening to their own voices.
“Well, I'm offering. If you come to California, to SE here, I'll whip one right up. You can come try it out.”
Conclusion: he was right. Gay porn didn't do a thing for him – it wasn't disgusting, per se; simply... not interesting – where straight porn still did make him react; not even gay porn with actors who looked loosely like Steve did it. Tony couldn't rightly call himself bisexual in front of these facts – now that he thought about it, Tiberius had tended to be very engaging back when they were in school... but such an idea had been so far from what he had had in mind back then that Tony hadn't exactly noticed.
He'd found out what was happening – long story short, apparently Yinsen had a child from a first marriage who wasn't Toni Ho, and that son was angry because his dad hadn't loved him enough, cry me a river, Tony wasn't out there making terroristic points because Howard had failed to come to about 90% of his birthday parties when he'd been alive, and also Wong-Chu and Cie had apparently implanted him with a kill-switch that he was almost certain came from the Mandarin, hence why no one had ever picked up on it, makluan technology was just weird and alive like that, and no one had ever explained to the kid that the means justified the ends only as long as the ends were justified themselves.
“It wouldn't happen. And still, there's the problem of way too much red tape, of administration, of, of...! Everything that was wrong with Registration!”
Except Steve didn't tell him that he believed in him, that he was innocent, of course, Shellhead, don't be like that, we're going to deal with it, you'll see, everything will be fine.
If possible he'd rather not die at all, of course, and he'd do everything for that to happen on top of protecting everyone else, and maybe the other – hypothetical – person would be able to ensure that while Steve got the marshal out of the way, but if he absolutely had to...
Tony wasn't sure why, but he almost wanted to laugh, right then. No matter what Steve went by – be it Nomad and his frankly revealing outfit, or the plainer Captain of today – you just coudn't take Captain America out of Steve Rogers.
Strange's house. Which meant Strange had finally decided to intervene. Good to know he was on their side. Could have decided to step in sooner, really. It would have saved them a lot of effort. Maybe it'd have changed the way of the fight, too.
Steve's hands clenched, as did his jaws. He was getting really, really done with not being told things – it wasn't Misty's fault, of course, not unless she did the exact same thing, which she hadn't done yet, but her words sure confirmed what he already knew: there was something he was missing, and it was something he should know about, except the people who should have told him just... hadn't.
He remembered the heat from the desert, the fires he'd started as he'd gunned for Karzai and Lemar – no, he didn't, he didn't have any memory of the incident, of the, of the freaking slaughter, but he remembered Afghanistan, more than ten years ago, the heat, the fire, the pain, the death.
“Just us, helping people that need help. The big problems. I can find us a place, if needs be. And then, we'll figure the rest out together.”
Steve's eyes fluttered open, and Tony could feel himself breathe freely again – worried, him? Ah! Obviously he had been. Not one month ago Happy's life had been threatened because of him, and now Steve was unconscious for days because of a deadly gas. They were all trying to give him a new heart attack, he swore – not that the mechanical heart would let it happen, not as long as it was charged, and, no, let's not think about that again, please. This was about Steve, anyway, not the moment to whine about his personal problems.
“It's Iron Man, Steve. War Machine and I used Kang's own door into time at the Mansion to go and get him from... from before Kang got his clutches into him.”
Just thinking about it made him shudder. The security nightmare it would be, with all the old and new labs and the various secret projects that had been created in the mansion, both in his father's time and now... And of course, this was Tony's home, the place he had grown up in, the recipient of his – admittedly rarely that good – childhood memories. Tony didn't want random strangers to sully whatever was left of his mother's voice in his memory by speaking loudly all around the place, he didn't want them to make themselves at home when he hardly knew them.
What Tony needed was to be left alone. What they wanted to do in “helping” him was to get him back to do everything and anything to help people, to direct his enterprise, to... He wanted that, too, but it wasn't what he needed. If he even tried, it'd end up the same way, with him failing everyone because he wasn't good enough, because he wasn't strong enough, because he wasn't and couldn't be everywhere taking care of everything all the time but that was what people needed of him.
The supersoldier looked barely conscious, and that said something about the potency of the red stuff, but that really wasn't the moment to consider such things – except it was, because Tony had an idea and Steve wasn't going to like it when he'd wake up but at least he'd wake up and if Tony didn't make it, well, it wasn't like Steve would be able to berate him anymore.
Maria Hill wasn't Steve's favorite person, but considering she'd been Tony's second-in-command, and was still second-in-command even now that Fury had come back – apparently he'd showed up after Tony's disappearance, glaring at everyone and especially Hill, and grumbling about idiots who couldn't help but actually be right about everything, and had been the main reason why Gyrich's catastrophic handling of SHRA hadn't ended with a massacre – it stood to reason that she could tell Steve what exactly had happened for Carol to be in such an antagonistic mood.
He wasn't feeling right, less than he'd been back at the hospital – had there been a hospital? Was it even the same reality? Maybe this was were Tony hadn't taken the bullet for him, maybe this was – but, he'd seen Tony down in here too, hadn't he? Though, he might not be dead, Steve couldn't tell from what he'd seen, supposing this was even...
He watched as Steve took a deep breath – schooling his features into an encouraging expression, something that wouldn't let his confusion show and would make it all about Tony, just Tony, even if it really wasn't.
He didn't wait for an answer – after all, he was never granted to be listened to, when he was the one being accused, so why should he let anyone have the opportunity to defend themselves right away when it was their turn? T'Challa could take some time thinking about it, just like Tony had, before immediately getting on the defensive.
Once the nurse left, he snorted at the piece of paper in his hand and looked Tony straight in the eye – difficult to stare someone in both eyes when you only had one yourself.
“That means that sooner or later, the two of you... and the two of us... are going to end up on the same side. It might be wise to keep our disagreements confined to the civilian world. Might help keep people alive.”
A hard look settled on her face – Steve wasn't certain if it was towards himself, Tony, or the ones who hadn't told him about whatever was going on, though. For all he knew, it was for all of them lumped together.
Tony didn't want to argue about that, though. It wasn't like Steve would ever listen to him, not really, not even enough to at least try and understand, let alone agree.
Of course, Rogers didn't have to spend time with him, but what would it cost Tony to at least try and have an actual conversation with the man? To give them a chance to get to know each other?
“'Was thinking, boss... At first, I didn't get it. Why doesn't he tell them? Why doesn't he show them? But with everything going on... You're one of them, sure, as in, you're going around superheroing and risking your life for all of us poor sods just as much as any of them, but, thing is, I don't think they do consider you one of them. Or, you know, that they would, if they knew.”
“We're a close-knit community, Captain. What happens when someone fucks up and no one wants to admit it?”
He'd been toying with the idea for some time, but until now it wasn't like Steve had needed another shield, and Steve had made it clear he didn't want Tony's help, long, long ago, if he could do without. But now Steve didn't have a shield anymore.
It wasn't like there hadn't been any hints. It wasn't like Tony Stark had a tendency to disappear when Iron Man came around – though, okay, occasionally someone else was in the armor, and that was obviously enough to fool most people, but Steve, Steve should have known, if he'd really known Iron Man as well as he thought he did.
Wilson frowned, obviously a bit puzzled by Tony's attitude, but also very opposed to pretend nothing had happened and Tony Stark hadn't taken off Iron Man's helmet right before his eyes only to save Steve Rogers' life with CPR.
More like a landpoint of the island of Utopia, where everything always went well and everyone was perfectly kind, well-meaning, and unable to screw up, but hey. Sometimes you had to choose your words.
Tony didn't want to argue back – not yet, not right now – no matter how many issues he could find in Steve's reasoning. He was too tired, too uncomfortable, and too distressed right now to continue.
More than that, the armor shouldn't have been hijacked. More than that, Tony should have been good enough to prevent that from happening – how many times had he worried about Iron Man being used for evil? How many modifications had he done to the armor to keep it from being used against his will? But it didn't matter, because the one way they had used, that one way, he hadn't seen it coming – worse, perhaps he had, and hadn't been good enough to properly shield the armor from that way. He guessed he wouldn't know about that until he found out who, how, and why.
Steve almost thought he'd have to thank whoever they were, if he ever got to know their identity – except that they hadn't taken it down, they still thought it necessary, which meant they weren't on the right side. Because they'd done one thing right didn't mean everything else they were standing for wasn't utter bullshit. Just look at the nazis: they had interesting ideas about ecology and animal protection, but they were still primarily genocidal, monstruous murderers.
“Of course you can potentially make me talk, Skrull. It doesn't mean you will succeed in doing so. It doesn't mean you would like what I have to say.”
Well. Steve was in a dive with Clint, and Iron Man would stand out. Not only that, but Steve would almost certainly refuse to listen to Iron Man right away because he was stubborn like that.
When he woke up in the hospital, after a woman, after a friend had died in his arms, after barely managing to keep a newborn child alive – after having decided there was no point continuing, too – only Rhodey came to see him, which really wasn't a surprise. Pepper and Happy had left long ago, to live somewhere where they wouldn't be continuously endangered by Tony's superheroics – never mind the number of times they hadn't died because Tony was Iron Man, because the Avengers had been there to stop a catastrophe, because a villain wanted something and they were in the way regardless of Tony's superheroics, never mind all that, because Tony understood, because he knew he occasionally was a danger to them – but it didn't hurt any less.
“Yeah, that's what I remember too. But think about it, Steve. It doesn't make the slightest lick of sense. You don't do one night stands, and I don't do men. Still, here we are.”
Steve could leave, though. The Guardsmen were all out, and no one else knew he was here – Tony intended to go and wipe the recordings that weren't focused on the prisoners before leaving, which he would be able to do if Steve agreed to just leave it, but would most likely be useless and impossible if he persisted.
Peter's eyes – his lenses? How exactly had he made a mask that widened around the eyes exactly? – went wide, and the younger man tried to look away, except that would mean looking at the gathering crowd instead, and while they weren't being hunted down anymore, Steve didn't think his friend would be very comfortable with squirming under the attention so openly yet.
They didn't destroy Vision, because Vision wasn't trying to become the next Hitler and invade the world with bots every tuesday, because he was trying to do good.
Good point, though. This time Steve didn't think Iron Man was doing things he knew were wrong – incapaciting the guardsmen, murdering people, the exact same thing, right? – willingly, no, he just thought “Mr. Stark” had done it all alone. See, progress.
It was the Carnelian ambassador all over again, wasn't it? No matter how good the security he made, someone always ended up finding a loop-hole – and if it wasn't the armor itself being hijacked, well, why not go directly for the man behing it now? He was going to have to look into some tech to block mental control, or, if what Jan had reminded him of under her breath was right – in other words, if the crazier Tony Stark from back then was to be believed – into not ever letting any of his life-support tech fall into the hands of a time-travelling villain who probably had access to future reports onto said tech. Not that he shouldn't try and make sure to be immune to mind control anyway.
“It's alright, it happens to everyone. And I... I'm glad you've got such a loyal employee. We should all be so lucky.”
She left his office and Tony was alone again in his room at the mansion – he looked at the things on the shelves, at the files on his desk, at the pictures of him looking vaguely different with several women over the years, but none who stuck around, obviously, and two of him with friends, James Rhodes and Happy Hogan. He'd been learning his life back from the start, memorizing the people he'd met and the dangers he'd faced when he at least had something to tell him about it, looking at newspaper articles about Iron Man and trying to deduce what had actually happened, looking through the Avengers database and noticing all the things that went unsaid in the reports, things that he couldn't remember anymore and that were glaringly obvious in their absence.
He vacated a whole factory, put it on fire. He burned several of his favors and arguments for this last chance to convince the others to work within the system instead of bringing them in without giving them a chance – he wasn't sure he could ever offer another official chance if Steve refused that one, though that wouldn't stop him from managing to talk in secret if he absolutely had to, except he had a hundred spies on his back, and an agent at his side almost twenty-four / seven, and losing them the time to talk would mean losing some credit too, and he'd need at least some left for his global amnesty once this would come to an end.
Before Steve could say anything – he was feeling a bit lost, to be honest, and that probably had something to do with the fact he'd lived his shooting twice and he supposed the right version of events was the first one, considering how the doctor had summarized the event, but then what had been the second version? Had that version been a dream, finally, and not the first one? – the doctor and the nurse left, leaving only the marshal and Fury in the room with Steve – and Stark, except...
Good news, though, Rumiko and him had gotten back together – until the media shitstorm had her going back to Japan, especially as people didn't like the idea that their future Secretary of Defense was being chummy with a foreigner, the assholes. And yeah, he could see their point, and yeah, he'd seen it coming, and yeah, Rumiko and him had talked about it, but shit he'd gotten a ring and it still hurt no matter how much you tried to rationalize it.
“I thought you'd like to hear that Iron Man is doing alright. I mean, I know you've seen each other since the whole... Kang-thing, but he's not really one to tell when he's hurting, he'd be unlikely to tell you himself if things weren't good.”
“I told you this was going to happen, T'Challa. I told you, and you called me and the others arrogant. Then I told them again, and they called it distasteful. Now? Now it is happening, and maybe it wouldn't have gone that far if you'd been willing to do something about it the first time I told all of you about it. You wouldn't get your hands dirty, but now they are asking for an arm, and if we don't give it to them, they will have our heads.”
“You told me that already. I'm talking about the fact that you don't do one night stands, to begin with.”
Happy was standing on the balcony of Sal's house, trying to cheer him up – or, at least, telling him that yes, Tony had reasons for what he was doing, and those were not a complete blindness to the evils of administration and powerful people, nor a power grab of epic dimension. At this point, he was probably the only one who actually cared to support him to his face for the actual reasons he was doing things, unlike those who did it because it'd help them personally.
Yeah. Like everyone else. No one seemed to even consider the possibility that, perhaps, he was simply in a bad mood, or that maybe he was fed up with never being given a chance.
Anything. Until the others came back, he needed something to do not to think about things he couldn't do anything about.
And she stood up from her seat, but Steve – Steve needed more, she knew something, and she wasn't telling him, and he didn't care if she didn't have proof, he had to know, he...
For that he'd have to admit that maybe there was a reason to all of this, an actual truth behind the fact that heroes could make avoidable mistakes, and that wouldn't do, would it?
He doubted Kooning had already told Hill or the president, not if he wanted this to be the power move Tony suspected he'd been planning with this meeting.
More than ever, Tony was aware of how he stood, how he looked, legs apart as if to reaffirm his control over the situation when really it was just easier to stay upright that way, jacket rumpled, shirt barely tucked-in, tie askew, hair done but still a bit unruly. It would be worse, of course, if they could all see what he'd concealed this morning, after having had a drink to carry him through the first hours, the dark shadows under his eyes, the stubble, the way it all told how he'd woken up on his chair instead of his bed, still dressed, an empty glass next to his hand, before he took care of it. Tony could look worse than he did right now, but he had never looked like that before, not in public.
Except he wasn't with the other Avengers, he was alone in what looked like a crude cell made of dirt and iron bars, there were mutates all around him in other cells, his armor had been deactivated – with what, he had no idea, it just laid in a heap outside the cell – and the blue and red woman was talking with... with...
Steve hesitated a moment, but Tony saw the moment he thought he had a winning argument. Something about the relaxing of his jaw, visible even under the cowl, perhaps.
Shapeshifter? His enemies were rarely supportive – not that his friends were either, but not the point. LMD? Nick might want to contact him that way, but this certainly didn't sound like him at all. Too polite, and way too supportive. Could be, however, a self-aware LMD who really liked him – sentient armor, hello – and had become self-aware – that too had already happened, which had kickstarted one of his numerous heart attacks, right before the synthetic heart.
The sound of a glass being put down on a counter, liquid sloshing around, got his attention. He was alone in his private rooms at the Tower, Extremis hadn't picked on anyone through the security cameras, but with powered people – or even superscience – you could never be entirely sure.
But he didn't have the time to check, and if two people reacted – not only him – maybe there wouldn't be any casualties, but in the meantime he had to assume this wasn't the case, the rushed footsteps were some journalist's who wanted to know more than the others, that this wasn't someone here to help him, so he had to do what he'd do if he was the only one who'd noticed.
He was almost out when he heard Steve calling him, for the first time, “Tony”. Not “Mr. Stark”, but “Tony”. It was stupid, but his heart was full of hope.
He'd been doing paperwork – again, always, more and more – when Janet had busted his office's door open, her anger barely contained and plainly visible on her face, about to ask for answers.
When she stopped coughing, she looked at him with wide brown eyes – but there was a distinct lack of surprise there, or at least it soon took over, as if, well. She hadn't expected that, but wasn't particularly surprised either, now that she thought about it.
He woke up again in the version of the story where Tony was dead – for him – and yet there was a ghost of Tony Stark haunting him.
Once again Steve had the unpleasant feeling he had missed something, but couldn't tell what exactly. It probably had something to do with everything he'd missed. He should ask... someone. About what had happened with Jarvis exactly.
He just hoped he wouldn't keep putting her into that situation, but even that he couldn't be sure of.
He winced behind the faceplate, all too aware that people generally didn't understand exactly what they were engaging themselves to whenever they said that kind of things to him. What he meant by that. What it might cost them, too, and in the end they blamed him, because it was easier than to admit that they had made a promise without thinking it through.
It was pretty obvious that the marshal wasn't the actual target – well, okay, someone might be gunning for him personally, but given the circumstances it was more than likely that Steve, no, Captain America, was the actual target – and if Steve was going to be gunned down, he'd rather there'd be no collateral damages.
It depended, he supposed, on what Steve meant by “compromised”. Of course Tony Stark had access to everything they said on it, after all, he was Iron Man, wasn't he? Now, if it was about giving it all up to SHIELD, surprise, that hadn't happened, and it wouldn't happen until SHRA was law, for the very simple reason that yes, he was cooperating, and telling Hill was she needed to know, but it didn't mean he'd hand her over his suit designs or that he'd report what he ate for breakfeast every morning. So, as long as Steve didn't decide to do something stupid – which was looking more and more likely, but, hey, giving the guy a chance – Tony wouldn't have felt obligated to tell Hill about it.
He had barely spoken it aloud, because he didn't need an answer, because he already knew the answer.
Talking to him now wouldn't work. If the others hadn't wanted to listen to Tony – except Reed, but Reed was special, Reed looked at the consequences before anything else, just like Tony did, even if in different ways, they both took in account the possible results, and this time those would be terrible – there was no possibility that Captain America of all people would listen, at least not before he came to understand that the consequences were already here, and that this time there would be no sweeping them back under the rug.
Before he could berate himself for letting “Tony Stark” talk instead of “Iron Man”, Steve reached for him, hesitant, and Tony jerked back.
It had to be good enough for Tony, because there really wasn't an alternative that didn't end in a catastrophe at some point or another.
He couldn't even remember, he had no idea how that happened, even though the SHIELD files could tell him, surely, but that wasn't the point, the point was that Tony didn't remember, and the last time it had happened it had been with Kang and his split personality – or whatever that had been – and the time before that was when he'd been drinking.
It didn't matter. Either none of them got out, and they died, or one of them got out and managed to free the others. One way or another, an end would be coming.
Ah. No. Two things, he guessed. Brainwashing could do it, too. At this point Tony wouldn't be surprised if Steve thought that was the real answer.
Steve felt the U.S. Mashals' reinforced vehicle stop, and guessed they'd arrived. The marshals with him checked that everything was secure – again, and he wanted to say something about how he wasn't going to escape now, but he guessed they heard that all the time – before the doors opened, and Steve saw the crowd outside for the first time.
At some point from there, things happened. Several things. Which one exactly was the cause for this, he didn't know. But they all mattered, one way or another – if not all were about the matter at hand.
If... If Tony wanted to befriend Steve, he thought as his eyes fell on Cap in the kitchen, who, once again, wasn't sleeping even at 03:00 – and, yes, Tony obviously wasn't either, but it wasn't like anyone cared about that – now was the time to start. It had to be now or never, because if he didn't now, what told him he would ever manage to do it later? – because later would probably not cut it, because Steve didn't deserve to be alone just because Tony was feeling insecure.
If he had been able to tell Steve why he really needed the lesson without making it obvious that he was Iron Man, Steve wouldn't object, because then he'd know he was doing it for his friend – Steve would almost certainly ask to go with him, or even, he would want to do it himself, without Tony's help, for Iron Man, but it was Tony's problem. Tony's responsibility. And even without taking that into account, Tony needed to be there, to know what had happened, to make sure it would never happen again, and given how hostile Steve was to anything Tony-Stark related, he wasn't certain they'd be able to work together efficiently.
He didn't dare bring it up, though. He didn't want Cap to shut off and accuse him of using the memory of the dead to get whatever he wanted.
Steve might be onto something, there, a way to numb everything better than alcohol had ever managed. A complete, definitive desensitization.
“It's really no problem, you came back to save people, Avenger. In my book, that's more important than obeying some finicky little team bylaw.”
He didn't turn around, opting for simply staring out the window for now. The other Avengers – both West Coast and East Coast – were out there in, eating, discussing, arguing about whether or not the West Coast team should be terminated, on the grounds that they weren't “efficient enough”.
He turned back around to look at T'Challa, because hell if he was going to let anyone think he couldn't say it while facing the ones he accused.
Just like he didn't believe anyone would understand – would even care to understand – why he was letting go. Just like he didn't expect anything except to be blamed for whatever would go wrong in the time of transition, the time SI would need to change its ways, the time Rhodey would need to adapt to the job.
But he knew himself well enough, he knew how much he could control what he gave the world to see, and while he was aware that he wasn't in his best state right now, he probably gave away less than anyone else would. The Avengers would probably be able to tell something was wrong, especially those who had known him for some time already, but they wouldn't know what to make of it – no one ever did. People made assumptions about how he felt, about what he thought, about the fact that he couldn't have just as many problems as they did, and generally they were wrong in those assumptions.
On top of that, Misty wasn't quite as personally concerned as Carol or Pepper Potts had been, which meant she might actually tell him what was going on.
“Sorry, Tony... but Captain America's more important than you... I just hope I can keep him alive long enough for Panther to get him out.”
The man in his kitchen had a sardonic smile on his face, a perfectly trimed goatee, a thousands-dollars designer suit, a glass of amber next to him, and was, he immediately knew, Tony Stark.
Steve would never offer him a drink, would he? – if he did, Tony would probably do something equally cruel in return. Like, admitting at last that he was Iron Man, that he was dying, and that it was a damn shame Steve didn't want his apology. Then he'd leave.
"I thought it was going to be like all the other red tape we've been tangled up in over the years. You know, the government makes a fuss, eventually we trim the team or we add whoever they want us to add. Or I get a new codename, or they give us a liaison and we spend a few months doing what Gyrich tells us and grousing about it. And we all play along until the next time Ultron wants to destroy everything. And then it's the same as always, because then they realize that we don't need these regs, and that maintaining them is getting in the way of us doing our jobs."
Steve had to stop himself from reacting, from jumping away out of instinct as a projectile flew at his head – it was only a tomato, as it was.
Steve wasn't finished, though, and with each word of how much he didn't actually understand a thing, he made it all the more clear that he had never believed in Tony. Not as Tony Stark – a given, at that point – and not as Iron Man. Or else he wouldn't be assuming that Iron Man could be forced to do anything “wrong” against his will, or at least not that he'd do it unless the lives of innocents were in the balance. Which, you know, was potentially the case.
Tony made sure that his voice, even through the modulator, showcased how unimpressed he was with that argument.
He sent a repulsor blast just before Steve, both separating him from Sersi and making it obvious that he would not change his mind – knowing Steve, though, it probably translated as a threat of some kind, because Steve could never think anything wasn't personal when it came to the two of them... – this wasn't the moment to think about that.
Except that particular approach to their problem only worked as long as it was their relationship in the balance, just like not talking about the elephant in the room – Iron Man's loyalty to Tony – had only worked as long as nothing bigger than the both of them had come in the middle.
“I am Iron Man, sir. And you are either going to give me the possibility to adapt SHRA to the supers with the most problematic positions, or you are going to put me in that database without my accord. Eitherway, you have Iron Man's identity. The question, now, is whether or not you want his cooperation too.”
That couldn't... It didn't make any sense. What could be worth letting Tony's death go? What could...
As the afternoon went on, Tony absorbed the defense lesson – really, it wasn't that bad, as Iron Man he had to be fit, and mostly it was all about adapting himself to a combat situation where he didn't have the suit and its power. Of course, Steve was, and would remain, more experienced in hand-to-hand combat, fitter, too, because hey, the best of human fitness, which was definitely not Tony's state. But Tony held his own, and managed to gather enough self-confidence that perhaps, he wasn't going to get himself killed right away when he'd go and tackle the Iron Man situation – he had occasionally had to rely on his fists alone, and he was still alive, wasn't he?
He wondered, too, if, perhaps, it was Tony that Steve had misjudged, and not Iron Man, if, in fact, he was worthy of Steve's friendship and Steve just failed to acknowledge it. But that would imply that Tony was a way better man than he knew himself to be, and so it couldn't be right.
And maybe, maybe it wouldn't be enough. But it would still be better, and at that point that was more than what they had.
Also, because someone needed to remind Steve that his point of view wasn't always entirely right, if not entirely wrong, and that making a choice always meant jeopardizing something, no matter how much the man didn't want admit it.
There was a moment of staring, of Steve just not knowing what to say as his perfect – belittling – theory turned into dust – unless Iron Man was lying, right, maybe he was thinking that too, after all it wouldn't be a huge leap to take after all the other assumptions.
Or the fact that actual vigilantes, those who didn't even try to acknowledge local authorities, those who didn't have political backing – or, you know, the fame and almost religious admiration Captain America tended to inspire – were constantly hindered in their work by people who doubted them – for understandable reasons. Hell, Steve didn't realize it, probably because he'd spent his first years as a superhero under the Army's protection, and even if he didn't always do what they wanted, they'd still known who he was, why he was doing it, and that in the end his principles existed to defend people, not to endanger them. After that, he'd woken up with about sixty years of fame and hero worship under his belt, whether he liked it or not, which meant that even if he went against the government a lot of people still trusted him enough to make it work.
And some people would tell you, he did it because he was arrogant, because he thought he knew better than anyone else, because he decided who got to be the villain and who got to be the hero. Maybe they were right. Maybe they weren't. But one way or another, it wouldn't negate all the other reasons. It wouldn't change the fact that if he didn't do it out of fear or of his own arrogance, some people would be dead right now, and what right did he have not to help – not to try.
Tony, unlike some other people, didn't explain “Good” and “Evil” to people, as if he knew and they didn't, no matter what those people chose to think. He did, however, voice his concerns, and hope for an answer and an explanation.
The skrull took his hand – Tony's hand, and how weird was that? – off Tony's mouth, a pleading look on his face – was that what he looked like, hidden behind the faceplate, when he tried to get Steve to understand something but the man just wouldn't listen?
The West Coast Avengers looked at him with suspicion, as he rejoined them, unsure if they would want him – again – but willing to try and prove himself – again.
Or maybe that was more telling about Tony's relationships, romantic and otherwise, than of what true love actually was. One way or another, depressing.
At this point, he wasn't sure if that was still true. Maybe, maybe not. Depended on your definition of love, really. Lots of people went with the idea that love couldn't be selfish, couldn't hurt the one you loved, or else it wasn't true love. By that definition, neither Steve nor Tony loved each other, he supposed.
All of that would matter, anyway, only if the Supreme Intelligence wasn't a genocidal supercomputer, which it was – wasn't it...? It didn't matter. It wasn't. If it had been, it'd never had done that.
Not that it'd be enough, since he'd still be out there killing people, but at least it'd tell him when he fucked up, that'd tell him when to throw himself into a Faraday cage instead of trying to prove his non-existent innocence.
Moreover, that'd just antagonize him, and right now Iron Man couldn't afford to antagonize Captain America. He was trying to give him a chance – not even a chance to join him, to help him, but simply a chance to ask, to believe in Iron Man, even if he couldn't believe in Tony Stark.
He remembered thinking, long ago, that once Cap would get to know Tony Stark, just a little bit, just enough for it not to be a complete disaster, he'd... He'd tell him, maybe he'd show him.
But it was unlikely that, after what had happened with Hydra, after the brainwashing – again, Logan seemed to have at least that in common with Tony, a tendency to get controlled / brainwashed / manipulated into harming others – Logan wanted a reason that would be good for him.
Captain America was a good man, and for him Tony would break his own word – for entirely selfish reasons, actually – and get himself involved in the Avengers' lives. Or, at least, in Steve Rogers'.
Of course, he did spend a lot of time with Captain America, but that was as Iron Man, not as Tony Stark. So, for now, Tony Stark was neither Cap's friend nor Steve's, and he should really get to it if he wanted to have a chance. It wasn't like Steve seemed interested in befriending Tony himself, so obviously he'd have to take the first step.
So, Tony managed not to even greet the Avengers himself when he offered the mansion for their headquarters, using his Iron Man persona instead to extend the invitation, and only after that did he officially “meet” them. It was better that way: the less they saw him, the less context they could associate him with that would remind them of Iron Man... the less likely they were to discover anything – Jarvis probably caught on after a few months, but that was because Jarvis knew him better than anyone else who was still alive, because he was one of the rare people who actually wanted to believe in Tony, and it wasn't like the old man ever said anything. Jarvis, moreover, and unlike some other people, seemed to understand that whatever Tony's reasons were, he didn't have to explain himself to anyone about it.
Yeah, give Steve the overrides. Good plan. If it ever became necessary, then Steve would know, but at this point it didn't really matter, did it, and anyway it wasn't like Tony could put his secret identity before literal lives.
One of these days he'd have to call Captain America and the others to tell them that not only they'd lost Wanda and Vision and Clint and Scott, but he couldn't bankroll the Avengers anymore – and that was it, wasn't it, he couldn't, he didn't have the capacity, but who would understand that, really? They never did. They hadn't, when the official story for his behavior at the UN had hit the medias. They'd think he just didn't want the hassle, that he was tired of paying – ignoring the fact that if it had actually been the case, which it wasn't, it would still be his right not to, even if it would be selfish, even if it wouldn't be the right thing to do, that he didn't owe it to them to bankroll the Avengers.
Steve was probably the less practical man in the world whenever it wasn't about how to beat up supervillains, but Tony didn't comment. He smiled, too, and unlike Steve, no one could see that it wasn't a real smile, because no one who knew him was there to notice.
It was the right move, because that was what they were supposed to do – helping, even when it was at their own deficit.
“Listen... I'm not going to threaten you or send lawyers after you if you talk, but before you do that, before you look Steve in the eyes and tell him that Iron Man really is Tony Stark, I want you to take into account the worst case scenario. The possibility that Steve won't take it well, at all. And the small consequences that could lead up to bigger, nastier ones. Sure, he tells me to get out and leave the Avengers, maybe I've deserved it, and it's not like I'm the only one who can help save the world here. Or maybe he doesn't get rid of me, maybe he swallows it up, but refuse to ever trust Iron Man again, and then we all realize I'm out anyway because I'm useless if the team leader doesn't trust me. And yeah, all that, we don't care, it's on me, it's not endangering the world. But one day something happens, Ultimo wakes up, I don't know, and I go alone against him because I'm not part of the team anymore and anyway I do that all the time. Except for once it ends badly, maybe I missed something or the Mandarin joined forces with Ultimo for some reason or I'm particularly banged up from my last fight already, who cares? Thing is, I die, and the Avengers step in. Everything goes smoothly from there, no problem, the day is saved. Flashfoward to one year later, my cousin Morgan somehow managed to wriggle his way back in my company and decides to sell the Hellicarrier's plans to, uh, invading skrulls. SHIELD is taken out, Fury is locked up inside his own Hellicarrier, and shit, the one man who knew the plans like he'd made them himself, that's me, by the way, is dead. I can go on a long time and on many different littles consequences, the point is, maybe the Avengers save the day again, maybe other heroes do, but in the meanwhile someone dies or lose their jobs because I wasn't there to do this or know that. Or maybe it doesn't change anything at all, how would you know, but the thing is, you can't know that and maybe me being there, alive, Iron Man being still trusted to be a hero and not just Tony Stark in a suit of armor, maybe it will make a difference. Consider that, Falcon, and if you decide the risk is worth it, tell Steve. If you're not sure you want to know how it could go at the worst, however...”
It almost started another panic attack – he'd have to take the helmet off, didn't he, hell, he needed to, he needed to wipe off the snot and the tears and maybe his sins while he was at it, and then Steve wouldn't want to help him, he wouldn't, and even if he did he wouldn't trust him enough to actually listen to him, and that was fine, Tony deserved it, but there was still the matter of finding out if there was someone behind all this, someone who'd still be dangerous even if Tony was taken out of the equation, and...
The SHIELD agents – the same ones as in his dream, except he'd already seen them the day before so of course that didn't mean anything – told him the exact same things as in his dream about half the time, and they did some things the same way, some things another way. No way to say for sure if there was something suspicious about it.
Anthony, young, reading the dictionary – no one gets to judge, okay – and finding the definition of hypocrisy: “the practice of professing standards, beliefs, etc, contrary to one's real character or actual behaviour, esp. the pretence of virtue and piety”. Realizing that it was intricately tied with trying to be a better person, that you couldn't do one without risking the other.
Wanda had a second break-down, then a third one, and she somehow ended up turning the world upside down each time – the thing was, when you turned something upside down twice it ended back up in the right position, except that everything in it had gotten shaken up in the meantime and maybe some of it broke on the way.
Tony gave the man a small smile at his knee-jerk attempt to find something good to say to counter all the accusations Tony was burying himself under – but the fact that he didn't actually have anything to say about it, in the end, said enough.
"I know who he is, I know what he is. I've known a thousand men like him. My own father was like him. The only difference is that he's got more money than most. I know exactly what kind of man he is, and I don't see why I should sit here and let him play with my friends' lives because he wants to feel like he's worth something now that the drink's not telling him so, now that he's not pouring liquor down his throat.”
Steve was suddenly taken over by a weird, uncomfortable feeling, and he almost turned around to tell the ghost to shut up, except...
He was trying to sound friendly, though, each and every time, but Steve just kind of gave him a weird look – the suspicious glint in his eyes from their first official meeting wasn't there, no, but it was echoed in that look and Tony wasn't sure what it meant yet. He was probably doing something wrong again.
“Though, I can't say I like the mechanical heart. Or the prospect of recharging it by electrocution, for that matter. How do you bear with that?”
He bit back an urge to point out that this worked both ways, that while he hadn't been at Steve's back, Steve hadn't been at his either. If they ever disagreed on something – like on Hala, like with the guardsmen – it would be because they both thought they were right, but at least one of them would have to be wrong – both, maybe – and neither of them would be willing to consider they were the one in the wrong. It wasn't just Tony, here. Steve was just as guilty of this as Tony was.
What did she mean, Peter knew what had happened to Tony? SHIELD not saying anything was one thing, but Peter... Peter wouldn't.
Steve, after all, did not make mistakes in the field. The mistakes he made were of an entirely different kind, and because they didn't result in immediate deaths, it was all too easy to pretend they weren't mistakes to begin with.
Steve didn't know what to make of that – or rather, he feared to learn what Gyrich, at the head of SHRA, was going to make in terms of damages, especially with Sentinels to do his bidding – but he didn't like the sound of what this article was saying, and he didn't like that he couldn't really deny any of what it said, even if he still didn't think Sentinels were justified.
Steve looked at him for a moment, lips pinched, as if he hadn't yet heard the question – or rather, as if someone had put him on pause the time to comprehend the question.
And here came the part they both knew not to be true – though, as always, Tony really, really wanted Steve to prove him wrong.
“You're talking about thousands of people giving away their secret identity, the fact that they have abilities. It's enormous. It's a lot of trust you're asking for, regardless of whether or not you have the right to ask for it. The access to the database has to be heavily restricted. I can build you a system that'll recognize a superhero without giving away their name to the officer checking on them, but you have to make sure that the person at the head doesn't have unrestricted access either. And if you still want me to head it, then there will be no records of Iron Man's identity. The head of SHRA answer to you and only you, in order to be able to defend the ones in their care.”
Tony felt his smile disappear, but forced it to come back. He had to be reading this wrong, he had to. There was no way Captain America was looking at him like that, like he was astounded Tony would even want to talk to him.
It didn't look like Steve wanted to hear it, but tough luck. Nothing Tony could say was something Steve wanted to hear, if only because he didn't want the truth, and abhorred lies.
Well. He'd have to plan around her. Then again, at least he knew where she was, and that she was here. He couldn't say as much for all the potential measures of surveillance he had to have set on him right now.
The footsteps stopped, as if frozen in shock and incomprehension, for a few seconds, then resumed. Steve sat down next to Tony, and moved to put a hand on a shoulder – ultimately didn't, instead aiming for Tony's left knee. His shoulders were taken by the chestplate, he wouldn't have felt the touch.
Ah, right. That would give them – whoever they would be – access to a successful Extremis subject. Not good. Add in some self-destruct capability, then. His remodelled DNA crumbling on itself right after death. Nothing valuable left.
“...wait, scratch that, apparently the feelings are mutual, great, why don't we just hook you two up? I mean, apart from the fact that you're having a very public affair with Rumiko Fujikawa and Steve hates your guts, wait, where was I already? Ah, yes. Exactly there. I don't get you. Steve loves you but he doesn't know it's you he loves so you just let him talk shit about you instead of, what, proving him wrong? Proving him you aren't an opportunistic dilettante who thinks he's always right and has a right to control the world without ever sacrificing anything?”
Eitherway, Iron Man. What could Steve be meaning with that question, exactly? The quiver in his voice indicated it wasn't just about getting Iron Man's new number. Something was bothering Steve, some...
“And how's Registration going to stop you from blowing a jumbo jet the next time someone hacks your brain?”
He wasn't sure how Steve would take that, but what he meant was that no matter what, Iron Man would defend Steve's life. Though, knowing Steve, he'd probably take it like it meant Iron Man would always agree with Captain America / the Captain. Which wasn't likely.
Speaking of which, Kang was being awfully sure of himself, appointing Anthony himself to watch over his own life and make sure no one interfered.
Anthony was having doubts about whether or not that had actually been the “beginning” of Kang twisting him into someone he wasn't, mostly because the fact that it had happened didn't mean it had actually worked at all, and he hadn't been able to find any other interference from the time tyrant on the very advanced system that was checking over his whole life. Sure, something was influencing him, but he wasn't certain that thing was Kang's eloquence.
Meanwhile, reports from Tigra about what ran the rumor mill amongst the rogues told Tony that the Punisher had killed two people – criminals, but apparently that wasonly enough of an excuse when Captain America said so – in the anti-registration side's very presence, and still walked away, because he hadn't put up a fight afterwards.
Did Iron Man like Mr. Stark? He didn't, per se, hate him. “Mr. Stark” wasn't what he'd call a bad person... But he didn't quite like him – or, more accurately, he didn't like being him. He valued “Mr. Stark” as you'd value a great tool. And no matter how he could spin that answer, it was obvious that Steve could twist it back into a number of meanings, all of them bad, either for Tony Stark or for Iron Man. Given that Tony Stark was already on the man's shit list, and Iron Man wasn't, Tony knew which one he'd rather tarnish with his answer.
He could hear, in Cap's voice, that he didn't doubt Iron Man's innocence, per se. It was good – the contrary of what had happened with Bethany back in City Hall, and it had been awful, and he had said things he shouldn't have said, because Bethany didn't know, and Bethany disliked Iron Man, but she didn't dislike Tony – but still, it left the possibility that Tony wouldn't be able to prove “Iron Man”'s innocence, that no one would believe it – and it wasn't good, because, knowing Steve's opinion of Tony Stark, Cap probably didn't trust “Tony Stark” to defend Iron Man properly, and that, that hurt.
Tony finished Steve's sentence for him, because he didn't want to listen to him struggling to say something he didn't really feel, at least not in any way that mattered.
Misty almost choked on her beer, and Steve found himself patting her on the back awkwardly. If that wasn't an indication that yes, something was up...
The Director of SHIELD looked back at the president, leaving Tony to wallow in self-pity for about five seconds.
Why was Captain America looking at him like that, as if he just knew Tony wasn't trustworthy, as if...?
Once more – a last one before leaving, Tony figured – the man who'd called himself Iron Man's friend for about eleven years decided it would be swell to just try and antagonize him a little bit more.
Several skrulls – scientists? guards? maybe both – were standing on the other side of the energy wall, and Tony wondered what exactly they were planning to do. Leave him to die on his own? Try to interrogate him, to get him to do things for them – that had worked so well in Afghanistan, hadn't it? He wasn't a very “interesting” specimen of the human race, so they were unlikely to try and dissect him – though, at the same time, he was perfectly “baseline”, to a point where it was kind of surprising, how anyone could be so genetically bland? So in a way he was a very good standard to base their studies of the human race off. Which wasn't a positive way to think, but Tony had never been particularly positive, and generally didn't pretend to be.
“Yeah, I'm talking about Falcon and your war buddy. But also, all the others. All those who came to see you, who supported you, who thought you were right, and who never told you what happened, because that'd be admitting too much, wouldn't it? That'd be conceding that Tony had a point, not that they're doing themselves much of a favor by denying it either.”
The door was pushed open a bit, and Steve saw Peter's face appear in a dim light. When the younger man saw he was awake, he pushed the door wide open, and Steve recognized both Jessicas, as well as Luke Cage behind him.
It almost made him laugh, in a weird, slightly maniacal way, but Steve presumably couldn't hear it with the filters on.
Tony took in the harried look that was apparent on Steve's entire being. Even if the supersoldier couldn't get physically exhausted so easily, it was clear that he was mentally tired. Tony wasn't sure there was something he could do about it, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to try.
Perhaps if he... Yeah, that he could do. He was more valuable as a tool than as a person, so he should present how efficient he was as a tool. That was how you sold a tool, after all: by flaunting what you could do with it, and not by lauding its inner beauty.
Maybe an integrated warning for whoever had the overrides after a certain lapse of time doing questionable things? Of course that could get in the way of him actually getting things done when things needed to get done, so he'd have to think carefully about what constituted questionable things – aside from straight up murder.
Happy's life-support was beeping stubbornly next to him – except it wasn't, was it, Tony wasn't there, he was alone in his apartment, he was alone, he wasn't next to Happy, but still he could patch into the video surveillance, he could hear the beeps, he could be here and there, and most of all, he knew.
Tony wasn't here, because Tony was dead. And it was worse than back in the other timeline – or was it? – because Tony had been killed in retaliation to Steve's shooting. The Winter Soldier had been formally identified as the shooter, and – no mask, so no doubt, unless, of course, it was a rather elaborate disguise, which was always possible, but the thing was, Steve had no difficulty believing it, if Bucky had thought Tony was to blame, because Bucky had lived through some things, and still wasn't past it yet, because Steve had wondered himself if Tony had ordered the shooting, because... – and what?
Like Steve hadn't asked Tony why he was doing what he was doing, like he hadn't offered to find another way to do the same thing but better, like he had only considered his own way – not doing anything and then saying it wasn't their fault when something happened and someone else died because Tony hadn't done what needed to be done.
Tony squinted, tilted his head – he didn't doubt T'Challa knew all that already, that he was well-aware of the differences in their respective situations, because he didn't doubt T'Challa's intellect and awareness of the world, as it was, but he was also done with letting people get away with accusing him of things and not admitting any of their own reasons to act as they did.
Tony could see this was going to get ugly – maybe not now, maybe not right away, but at some point, later, there would be resentment and anger, and he wasn't sure why exactly but he knew it, and if someone had to take it then it could as well be him.
Just not enough for Steve to even consider that he might be wrong about some of his assumptions, right?
The fact that Steve still called him “sir” was enough for Tony to remember that Cap didn't actually care for Tony Stark, and was reacting so only because he was afraid of being rude – more likely, even, because he didn't want to sound like he didn't believe in Iron Man.
“If you'd been his friend, you would have worried about the bullets he took for you all, instead of blaming him for the few he couldn't stop.”
Steve, somehow, managed to get even more withdrawn, even more hunched on himself. As if to keep himself safe from Iron Man's influence.
He'd learned long back that when people asked him what he thought, they didn't actually want the truth, they wanted to hear what was the most convenient for them and what they cared about. Sometimes the truth was it.
All the times Steve had believed this before came back to Tony, but he bit his tongue and did not blurt it out – yet.
He'd have gone and proposed to the government an armor that only worked within the Vault – he'd have even upped the raw power of the thing, if they had asked for it as a compensation – but there was no way they'd accept that, not now that they already had the armors – which, too, had already been used against the West Coast Avengers when Quicksilver had decided he wanted revenge on anyone and everyone who had ever so slightly “wronged” him. If Stane hadn't sold the government the copies of the Guardsman armor...
So what if Steve didn't really understand, as long as he was happy? As long as he could laugh while with Iron Man?
Tony could see, on his armor's internal displays, that Tony-over-there was dying – and now, had died – as the older man synchronized their armors in one last effort, throwing all the intel he could into Tony's armor. He didn't have the time to finish, though, and his heart stopped beating.
Bethany was the only one to hold his hand throught the fiasco of his alcoholism. Tony wasn't sure why she bothered, even if she did love him – and he did love her, too. Jarvis hadn't, and honestly, Tony didn't blame him, considering how Tony had treated the poor man that one time.
That was completely stupid, and never going to work, if only for a few dozens of thousands of reasons, starting with the fact that while Tony did not need the salary, that while Steve could make do without it, not everyone was in such a good situation and they might not want to commit to a team when they could barely make sure they weren't evicted by the next month.
There was a tentative smile on his lips, and Tony could admit that he yearned to see it turn into a ugly grimace as Steve would be confronted with the truth. Just to prove that for all his promises, Steve wasn't as good as he liked to think.
Problem being, Tony had a hard time finding something really good to say about himself, without it sounding too desperate, or feeling completely dishonest.
It wasn't only about limiting the collateral damage, but also about providing some safety to those hotheads who would get there anyway. It made him think of Clint, who, when he'd first decided to do some heroing, had been mistaken for the very criminal he'd stopped and as a consequence had almost been lost to the dark side – also called Natasha Romanoff.
Maybe it hadn't been about what Bucky deserved, but about making sure no one else suffered from what Bucky had lived through. Making sure that Bucky himself didn't have to deal with it alone, with Steve ignoring the pro...
And also dangerously polished, the kind of look Stark used to sell to the press, to people he didn't care about, people who didn't know him, who didn't get to see past the facade.
He wasn't particularly surprised when Emma and the X-Men in general – you know, that team which didn't exist anymore? – refused to join his side, but he had needed to confirm what he already knew, and more than that, he had needed to hear her declaration of non-interference. He could deal with people doing their own thing discreetly – as long as it wasn't made public, because then he'd have no choice but to react – as long as there was no open confrontation with SHRA, no statement of resistance.
Steve of course couldn't see it with the faceplate – thanks God for the faceplate, at the same time, he didn't think it enough – but while Tony agreed to shut up – which he could easily have not done once the ringing finished – he wasn't any less defiant of Steve's self-righteousness for all that.
Well. It wasn't like Tony Stark ever measured up to Captain America's standards, anyway. Tony, for sure, had never pretended to; he knew himself, he knew how pathetic he could be, too well to think that. But once upon a time, he'd believed that Cap, being perfect and all, would not begrudge someone for not being as perfect as he himself was.
Peter shut down then, a startled look – seriously, how did he do it with the mask? – on his face, as if he'd just realized something. The younger man turned around sharply to stare at Steve, only to let out an anxious laugh as Steve raised an eyebrow at him.
Steve took a step towards him, a look on his face that Tony – that Iron Man associated with Captain America looking at civilians and checking whether or not they were about to snap because of whatever had happened just before.
And Tony let them all go, and Tony always ended up alone, or with people who didn't really know, or cared to know, him. Only Whitney hadn't done that to him, but Whitney was a special case and they had other reasons why it just couldn't work between them, no matter how much they had wanted it to work back then.
Him not taking responsibility anymore wasn't selfish. You didn't accuse someone who had no hands of being selfish for not cooking you your meals. He simply couldn't take responsibility. Him still taking responsibility, when it was obvious that he couldn't handle it anymore – that would have been selfish, egotist, self-centered.
Tony didn't say anything – didn't even have to force a fake smile of uneasy approval on his face, because he was wearing a mask, wasn't that perfect?
“When Tony was killed, because he was too fucking busy dealing with the next crisis to defend himself, because he'd always known how to prioritize, because it always ended up being at a personal cost, do you know what happened, Steve?”
Steve had tensed behind him, Tony could say because he felt the weird and fleeting lack of air against the back of his neck of a breath being sucked in and not let back out right away.
Then again, dreams didn't always make sense. Because this one had been unexpectedly realist didn't mean it hadn't had flaws.
The supersoldier, sure of himself and of the righteousness of his judgment, looked at Iron Man with a pleading look, for him to understand and agree, to say that, yes, indeed, Steve, you know better.
And, it was totally possible that Tony would enjoy locking himself up in his lab for a few hours, to distract him from all his other problems, just the time for Steve to get there. Just... to get his mind off the fact that, right now, perhaps, someone was using some of his most powerful tech to...
She leaned in, her bionic fingers curled dangerously around her bottle of beer, and Steve wondered if there was a risk of her strength breaking the glass into pieces, because it was easier than to speaculate on what was coming.
His chest was hurting, jailed inside the chestplate, and though he couldn't actually feel that – he couldn't feel anything up there anymore, except pain, more pain, and yet more pain, and he didn't know if he was going to get used to it or if it was going to get better but eitherway he didn't have a choice so he'd deal with it and there was no point in complaining – his heart felt like it was hammering itself against his ribcage.
He was aware he'd sighed, but it wasn't like this wasn't a particularly difficult conundrum. To tell or not to tell, but to fail either way.
At first Tony wasn't an alcoholic – no one was, at first. At first he drank socially, at first he could stop whenever he wanted. At first it wasn't a problem. Then something happened, and that period when it wasn't a problem was gone. He wouldn't be able to tell you which drink was the one with which he'd walked the line, but he knew there was one.
“Excuse me, but maybe we should address the actual subject here; what are we going to do to deal with this shit show?”
Apparently T'Challa had been looking over the files from the bunker, and Red Skull had had two options at some point, and obviously he'd chosen the one that made the gas slightly more problematic for supersoldiers, just because. Nothing really grave, though, just, Steve would take some more time to wake up, so they were going to transfer him back to the mansion.
Steve didn't answer right away, and Tony would have bet half his fortune the man was currently blushing. Honestly, the guy had no problem fucking him senseless but the moment he had to put words on it he went redder than a poppy.
He still didn't know if it was a dream – and which one was the dream, consequently – if there was a mastermind behind it all, if any of this at all was real.
But the thing was, Steve didn't like him, and so there was no point in pretending he believed Steve could be bought – a laughable theory in any version of the story, because Steve Rogers couldn't be corrupted, though he could be manipulated.
Thor took Tony Stark aside for a talk, but had no need to speak, for Tony had already made his mind earlier.
“Come one, I have to play shooting target on the way to my trial. It would be a damn shame if I didn't reach the stand, after all.”
“We're shapeshifters, we don't really care. And, sure, I'm most comfortable in my own body, but that doesn't make yours uncomfortable.”
Oh wait, he had. He'd just forgotten about it as he'd been worrying over the facts that, 1) Steve hadn't been waking up, and 2) Rumiko was still ignoring his calls. And, basically everything else, because of course someone had to look after SE and make sure no supervillains had the brilliant idea to attack whatever factory they wanted while Iron Man was worried about his teammate and Tony Stark was handling the disaster that had been the Red Zone alongside Fury, T'Challa and a few others.
“As I said, going about our daily life is still... possible, but superheroing out there is an entirely different problem. Since Gyrich got the authorization to use the Sentinels... Well. We tried to do our superhero job a few times, and all in all I'm not really certain we did any good, as we were too busy repelling the Sentinels.”
Instead, he brought up his hands, in an universal gesture of defense – though the fact that he was wearing a suit of armor with weapons in the palms might make it rather not defensive...
Because the moment he did that, he would say goodbye to any sort of future friendship with Steve Rogers – as Tony Stark.
Tony's laugh was dry and hard to his own ears, and he almost feared that Steve would take it the wrong way, but right now they had more pressing problems and he had to make the supersoldier see that.
For two brief weeks, and a vacation in Jamaica, Tony was almost content, as he and Jan started dating. Then it became more and more obvious that if it went on, he'd have to tell Jan who Iron Man was, because it was one thing not to tell his civilian dates, but it was another to keep it from a comrade in arms with whom he was in a relationship.
And, as time had gone by, as Tony had realized what exactly those feelings were, Steve had shown him again and again and again that it would never happen. That Tony Stark would never make Steve Rogers happy.
Fake-Fury's face moved to look pissed-off, probably in accord with real-Nick's face wherever he currently was.
Steve hadn't expected it to go smoothly, especially considering how they'd last parted ways – and, sure, it hadn't been quite as terrible as with Tony, but still – but so far there had been only a little awkwardness, some silences, and a bit of jaw-grinding. No deal-breaker.
Nevertheless, he'd ditched Agent Lockhart, scrambled all communications around him at the time of the call, and driven around for a while before heading up to the stadium. This wasn't an official meeting, not this time. Tony wasn't going to get another chance at an official parley, not if he wanted to keep enough credit for the global amnesty he'd been discussing with the President.
They were hidden behind the trees, now, and skrull-Tony had his armor by his side. As for Tony, he was observing the – seemingly – SHIELD agents who were doing whatever they were doing in here – and now that he thought about it, this all sounded a lot like the Deltite plot, and God he wasn't ready for another mess of that kind, especially not with skrulls instead of rogue LMDs. Where there even any real SHIELD agents here, or had they all been replaced? Maybe they didn't know their orders weren't legitimate?
The man continued squinting at Steve for a moment, and just as Steve was about to say something, snorted.
Then again, superheroes were people too, and it turned out that everyone could disappoint Captain America – if he knew, which he didn't – and lie to him. Incredible. After all, superheroes were to be trusted, right, Cap?
“No no no no, I got this: the point was, Tony Stark, sapiens, fighting against his sapiens father, both in armors, when Magneto shows up and more or less tries to peace-keepingly kill everyone. Howard Stark, already defeated, doesn't stand a chance, and Tony hurls himself in between his father and a flying lamp post. There, his suit fails, like, Magneto, everybody, and next thing you know, he's... Well. Skewered.”
The question had her startled, and a look of pain fell on her face, but V'ra quickly got her countenance back. She escaped his gaze by fiddling with the armor, apparently looking for the device the other skrulls had used to put it off-line.
Tony dragged himself across the room, towards Steve – he could see Falcon being chained up, but, more importantly, safe from the red gas for now. Steve, however, wasn't.
Steve put his shield away, on his back – which was already better when he thought back on the guardsmen, but didn't mean much, considering that Steve had more than enough practice reaching it in no time to sling it at someone's face.
Steve never brought up the past problems between them. Iron Man, who wasn't supposed to be the old Iron Man, even if it became obvious that less and less of his friends actually believed it as time went by, didn't say anything either, as he wasn't supposed to know the exact intricacies of the “old Iron Man”'s choices and actions.
Tony heard a distinct click, as if a mic was being enabled, and indeed soon after that he heard her voice, though vaguely distorted by the device. You'd think high-tech aliens would have gotten rid of that inconvenience.
“I... I... Of course you could. I hadn't recognized you, that's all! And well, better the two of us than neither, right? Like, of course you don't want to be mugged, but would you rather it happened to someone defenseless, without either of us here to...”
He didn't say, in the end, that he was really trying again mostly because he had no right not to help, not to try his best to make the world a better place, not to bleed himself dry for the future – because that was what it would end up being, wasn't it? At some point, some day, he'd have to give more than he could, because how could he not, how could he put himself as an absolute first? He'd have to give more than he had, and somehow he would, because he didn't have the right not to do it, because no one else would be willing.
Not that it would decide anyone who didn't want to turn off the Supreme Intelligence to do it, because the whole point of the Avengers was that though there was a “hierarchy” of sort, everyone would still end up doing what they thought was right if they were convinced of it hard enough. But this was a way of reminding everyone who wasn't on Steve's side that he too had years of Avenging under his belt and knew what he was doing, just as much as Steve did know what he was doing, and hopefully, it would bring the others not to be blinded by the Cap Charisma and to believe in their own instincts, in their own conclusions.
Aside from Stark's presence, and a few questions thrown his way by the journalists, things went mostly the same as in Steve's dream, up till...
So he winced, and pretended it was just that, only he acknowledged it out loud instead of not addressing the issue.
“And I thank you for that, Emma. But the fact that you protected my secret identity doesn't have any bearing on my stance here. Registration is happening, and you know why. Or would you pretend you aren't looking in my head right now?”
“Officially? My ex-fiancée, emphasis on the 'ex' and the fact that her knowing is directly linked to her not being my fiancée anymore. A couple of other people, friends. And I guess some others must have doubts. But that's it. After all, who would think Tony Stark could be a hero?”
This time it was Kooning, supposedly looking at him with a smile but really stealing glances at the suitcase. It was empty, of course – save for a faceplate that wasn't even metallic, but would do the job nonetheless. Not like he could get there with the armor put away.
He had to stop himself from standing up from his chair and take a step back as Steve leaned in to mock-whisper all his lack of trust and belief in Tony Stark in Tony's own ear.
Steve wasn't sure what it was, but it sure was weird. Stark's creations – and the SHRA database was Stark's creation – didn't just fail like that. Okay, sometimes someone managed to crack the system open, but A_ it was never a good thing for anyone and this was a good thing for them, and B_ it usually took more time before they managed to do that.
“Peter, I think Cap needs to rest right now. All he has to know is that he's safe, and he's going to get better. Okay?”
“The question, in the end, is simple: are you willing to sacrifice lives for a principle, and will you continue to argue that in doing so you are not betraying that very principle?”
Tony, at first, let his inner fanboy be completely awed by this sudden and unexpected event. Captain America was alive, and that was incredible. His childhood hero – the one imaginary friend he had had whenever he felt more alone than any child should feel in the mansion – was alive, and right next to him, and...
Tony couldn't find anything to say. Of course, he knew he was handsome, and objectively even Steve might say it, but they both knew what Steve thought of Tony Stark, and it was no secret what mattered more to the supersoldier, between looks and moral values. Steve might be sorry, now, that he hadn't seen Iron Man's face, but Tony also knew he'd have been sorrier if he'd seen that face was Tony Stark's.
Of course, if Captain America himself couldn't see it, Tony shouldn't have expected that from a child he barely knew either. What had he been thinking?
He was decidedly not taking his – not-so-sweet – time to get back to his flat – where Bucky and Sam were staying right now, and where he could ask the questions that had been plaguing him since he'd come back, but hadn't been courageous enough to actually ask until today, not that anyone was actually giving him answers – when he heard a woman's voice calling him.
Tony tried not to lie too much to Cap, though, or at least not to unless it was necessary. Most of the time he delt in omissions and half-truths. Here, saying the truth would only be a recipe for disaster.
Tony pinched his lips, wondering suddenly if a bullet had maybe hit Steve in his daring-and-absolutely-idiotic escape. Or... What if something else had come up in the meantime? They couldn't handle another major attack right now – well, no, they could, but the consequences would be terrible for absolutely everyone.
Except this wasn't about Tony Stark, but about Ho Yinsen. Steve would have to do with that terribly twisted answer, though, because he had asked him a question he couldn't answer honestly without compromising himself. It just wasn't possible. Tony had to answer as Iron Man, and so the only way to explain why he was Iron Man was by using Yinsen's memory.
Because right now there was another situation in which the both of them didn't agree, and neither of them could afford to agree with the other only to please him, because it was the easier, personal choice.
If Tony had needed one more reason not to divulge his secret identity, well – not that it mattered much, now.
The best thing that could happen would be for Steve to stay, to help make sure nothing went wrong, that there weren't any collateral damages, but that was about as likely as seeing Fury cross-dressing – cigar in mouth, still – for the aforementioned reasons, and anyway Tony wouldn't allow it because Steve would then be associated to this whole mess and his name would be stained too.
And now... Now Tony was in a room with the President of the United States and Nick Fury, feeling like he had the worse hangover in history, waiting for the results of the test that would say if he was actually hangover – and if he was, then there was an enormous problem because he hadn't drunk a thing and either someone had made him forget or he was losing time again, which wasn't something he wanted to repeat.
Misty just stared at him for a long time. Stared at her bottle. Finished it. Signaled for a second one. Steve guessed she came here often enough, as the waiter brought another beer.
Whoever shot Happy probably wouldn't have gone through with it if Tony had already been dead – because, let's be honest, the odds that Happy had gotten the attention of someone willing to kill by himself, instead of because of Tony, were not great.
He thought back to the time they saw each other, just after the armor wars. When he'd decided there was no point trying to explain anything to Steve, because Steve didn't care for an explanation that he didn't agree with, even if it was the truth.
Jan looked like she wanted to argue, but didn't. Probably because she understood that it was, indeed, for the best – even if that best was shitty.
There wasn't a chance, that much was obvious, now, but Tony would be damned if he didn't bring this attempt to its end – even if said end was to be in less than five minutes. He was not going to shield his feelings, to manipulate his face until this ended.
That got a smile out of him – but it was cold, humorless and possibly a bit disturbing to see on his face; not that the skrulls cared about who he usually was.
It might be a necessity – up to a point – but it wasn't a freaking principle, to keep your identity to yourself.
“You make some good points, though. What if... What if I said I was thinking about it? What if I said that you could... convince me?”
Whatever his infatuation with Steve was, it wasn't like the man would ever return the feeling – not as long as Iron Man was Tony Stark. Steve's feelings were only for Iron Man, not for Tony. Dwelling on what Tony's own sexuality meant for their non-existant relationship was of no actual interest as said relationship was doomed to remain non-existant.
So, the Captain was here, Iron Man was here, and the Guardsmen were here too, unconscious, at Tony's feet. Not difficult to guess who Steve was going to defend.
They'd probably call the Argonaut program an arrogant attempt at controlling the world, but in the meantime they wouldn't complain about the rescue units saving people when no one else would be there to do it themselves.
The last thing he saw was not-Hank reverting to skrull-form – so that was what the other one had been trying to warn him about – and trying to attack Lockhart – Vera – V'ra while holding onto her injured side. Tony couldn't feel his arm, his elbow, or his head, but he pushed himself on the first one, used the second to push the very-female-and-very-angry skrull away from V'ra, and headbutted her unconscious.
Steve was already standing when the SHIELD agents came for him, to escort him to the courthouse – New York, public, civil, not military, and he wasn't sure whether it was for the best or to mock him, because he'd get to say what he had to say, because it wasn't about the military only, it was about civil rights, it was... or because they'd parade him around, because they'd make a show of his surrender. Just to be safe, he'd assume it was the latter.
“I... You're the only one who saw, for Carol. And I can't help but think, you knew because you'd seen it before. You saw your boss fall into that same hole, didn't you?”
“I'm going to try, you understand, but the odds that anything can in fact be done are ridiculously low. That's all there is to it. Add that to the fact that I have to be very careful with the public knowledge of my medical condition, I can't just go and start demanding for a miracle.”
And, sure, you could argue that Tony did not, in fact, believe all the aspects of Registration to be good and right and perfect, but believing in something wasn't necessarily that restrictive. He believed in SHRA being necessary, in a number of ways – not in it being good.
He could almost fell the shadow of a smile, here, hidden under his worries. Steve might not trust Tony Stark, but there was still a chance. If there hadn't been, Steve wouldn't have proposed the Tower. Maybe... Maybe they could make this work. Iron Man could convince Steve to give Tony Stark's plan a shot – maybe he'd better frame it as their plan, Tony and Iron Man's, not just Tony, though.
The look on Steve's face as he punched Tony – as he punched Iron Man in the faceplate told him enough. Steve could have done it because he thought it was necessary, but here, it was before all an act of petty revenge.
No one liked to talk about that, and the fact that he'd thought of it first didn't make it any less hard to speak about out loud.
“What happened is that no one said anything. The few of us who have our suspicions about what happened, about who killed him, don't have any kind of evidence to back it up, especially as SHIELD is keeping it quiet, possibly because Tony's last wishes said to do so, because he always knew how to prioritize, and it never mattered to him what would be the personal cost, beause he thought it was better that way. Because, to him, his murderer being brought to justice wasn't worth the consequences to the community.”
But no. Steve was shit at lying, at pretending, and if he'd known that Old Shellhead was Tony Stark, if SHIELD had told him, he wouldn't act like that, he wouldn't be concerned, he'd probably say something about how this was all Tony's fault, how he should have known better, how...
A very disturbing recollection of Thanos tearing Iron Man's head off – Nebula had gotten the Infinity Gauntlet afterwards and put everything back in place, Tony had gotten better, no need to make that face – interrupted the conversation, and Rhodes shifted on his feet.
Tony didn't turn back to look at Logan. He had a speech about how the Avengers could help him get his good name back – or, as Wolverine would probably think considering the situation, considering what Tony himself knew about blame and guilt, doing something with himself, something good, could be a way to atone for things that had been out of his control but had still happened by his hands. Of course he had a speech. If needed, he could probably spin a totally different one right now, right here, depending on how the mutant continued on.
Right, gunshot. No actual hospital. Though someone had tended to his wound professionally – which he could say because he had an extensive experience of being wounded, despite, or maybe in correlation with his accelerated healing.
“But he does what he does because he wants what he wants and screw anyone who gets in his way. He wants everything and everyone to be under his control, exactly as he pictures it. That's why he's doing this, hunting down his technology. That's why he's making you do this. He's not stable. He's a flawed man. He's a drunk looking for a new addiction, and he's found it. Control. And he's never going to stop. He's not capable of it.”
“Good to see you alive. Not that I didn't know about it, but, you know how it is. We hear a lot of things in our line of work. Not all of them turn out to be true.”
He heard the Falcon's voice behind him, muffled through the glass, but still he heard it, the man was probably screaming something – and damn it, if he made it and Steve didn't wake up before him he'd have to track down Sam Wilson and have a chat with him to convince him not to say a word.
A shield, though, even an adamantium one... Sure, he couldn't stop Steve from doing whatever he wanted with it – not even using it against Iron Man himself, if it came to that – but he trusted Steve's intents, and it wasn't like there was any tech worth stealing in it, even if it was wrestled out of the Captain's hands.
That, more than likely, what he was going to do now was more along the line of fighting against others trying to help, because he couldn't be bothered with hearing them out when they said they had it. That, in the end, he would only be fighting for himself, no matter what he liked to pretend – and, that was fine, you had a right to fight for yourself, but you didn't get to say your were doing it for others when you just ended up doing more damage.
And it wasn't what Steve needed – let's be honest, Tony couldn't give Steve what the man needed, because what he needed didn't exist, not as such as Steve needed it, but he could give him the next best thing and hope it would be enough.
One week later, Tony was in Kyoto, apologizing to Rumiko's body – she'd come to see if he was alright, after Wanda and the UN, she'd come for him, she had been the only one, and for a second when he'd heard her message he'd thought, well, now we can be together again, now that he wasn't Secretary of Defense anymore, now that he wasn't an Avengers anymore, now that he wasn't even sure he could even bear wearing the armor ever again, they could put it all behind them, now that...
Steve wasn't with them this time, still busy with whatever mission was occupying all his free time lately – it was important, it seemed, because Tony wasn't sure he'd seen Cap this angrily focused since, probably, Zemo and Vespugia. He absently wondered about what he'd think of this story about Tony Stark's heroics, but ultimately he didn't think he actually wanted to know – what would it be this time, that there was nothing heroic in basic human decency, in refusing to kill Magnus, or perhaps that Tony hadn't not done it because he was a hero but because he wouldn't have had the guts to face the consequences?
That aside, Tony could tell Steve wasn't convinced, and at that point he just didn't know what else to say. It wasn't like he could force Steve to give a damn about Tony Stark – not even just some basic human respect, and while Tony himself didn't necessarily think he deserved that respect, he would have hoped that, if anything, Cap could respect Iron Man's opinion, even without understanding it.
That hit came when he first realized that the frozen man the Avengers had rescued was indeed Captain America, and not some sick joke from a guy who'd thought it would be funny to go treck in Inuit territory in full Captain America regalia and had gotten himself frozen for the effort – weird theory, yes, but it wasn't like it was less believable than the actual story, considering Captain America should have been dead or very very old, and not in suspended animation inside an iceberg.
They got back to the other Avengers, the ones who wouldn't get their hands dirty – and why would they, when others were clearly willing to do it in their stead, when they got to be righteous and not worry about the consequences of not having acted, since someone else had done it for them?
He snorted, choosing to rather focus on the fact that Tony could very well tell himself what to do without encouring any retaliation from the boss.
The president, who'd taken the post only a few months prior, on the other hand... Tony wasn't certain his predecessor had seen the need to tell him, though it was entirely probable that he'd called him just after Stamford just to share the news.
That seemed to amuse the SHIELD agent in a dark way. Hill spinned her pen between her fingers, and leaned back in her chair.
One from before Steve made it clear that Tony Stark wasn't worth his time, even less his friendship.
When he joined Happy for the ride to Westchester, Tony found a SHIELD agent – in her thirties, tan skin, brown hair almost as short as Hill's, dark grey eyes – standing next to his chauffeur and friend, who was watching her carefully.
Kooning koffed, and Hill squinted at him, but that was alright. If he had to, he'd go against those who were too strong, too independent to agree, just so that the people at the top could see how outmatched they actually were. He'd take a beating – or a thousand – if that was what it took. At least, if he was the one going against them, he had a chance not to be flattened out of respect, though he'd definitely lose all that respect as a consequence.
He blinked, suddenly realizing it was the morning light that he'd had in the eyes since he'd opened them. He'd spent the whole night arranging things for SE, considering the dreadful possibility that he might have to orchestrate some minor – read, no victims, but always the potential for it to go awry – disaster to eventually get enough people to register out of worry for the future, checking on Logan's progress tracking down Nitro – the guy didn't like the idea of SHRA, and Tony couldn't blame him, but at least he seemed to understand why going against it openly would just end in pain – and considering the timetable on which he could actually push against some of the less savory aspects of Registration – but that, that would take time, and it would only work if the others weren't too busy giving heroes bad press left and right, either because of mistakes, or because they were slowly turning into superpowered domestic terrorists, which, well, was likely to happen, if only with the most problematic members of the community.
There were literally dozens of reasons why that would have been one of the stupidest ways to go about murdering Yinsen's murderers, but Tony didn't think Steve really cared about that – about the facts that, come on, if he really wanted them dead he wouldn't have waited that long, and really it wasn't like there weren't any easier ways to do this than by hacking the Iron Man armor and somehow making “Iron Man” forget it all, or how it was a nightmare on PR, and did he say anything about how he could have just hired high-end mercenaries to do the dirty job?
Tony was also going after his stolen designs, which was also probably going to come back and bite him in the ass, because it was the right thing to do.
If Steve was willing to listen, to cooperate, if he showed SHIELD and the rest of the world that he could play, then Tony would be able to wrestle out even more good points for the heroes, more quickly, more efficiently. He could...
“He... left. He's not working for the Avengers anymore, whichever group you want to talk about, New, Mighty, East Coast... And, the thing is, we should have known it wasn't him. Because, you know. And that's the reason why he left, after we got him back. He said that despite all of the Avengers' qualities, he wouldn't be able to work for them anymore, not after what had happened.”
Had he already thought about how glad he was not to remember any of this? He had enough memories of various painful injuries as it was.
But, no, of course, it was Iron Man who'd been called. Even if Steve wanted to talk about everything, it would be the same as always: Steve's idea, Steve's incompromising principles, Steve's … – what? Steve's offer to fight the good fight against the evil overlords of accountability? How did Steve even think they would make that work, exactly? Using the armor while not expecting “Mr. Stark” to be able to pinpoint it, or at least to shut it down, was a ridiculous idea. Without the armor, though, Iron Man was useless – no, he wasn't, was he, but it wasn't like Steve knew that, and even then...
Eventually she took a step around his desk, and put delicate fingers on his – visible, because there were others, but she didn't need to know that – injury.
Tony wondered if, should he unmask now, Steve would go back and burn anything he'd ever gotten from Iron Man.
A carefully pleasant smile, not too open – Rhodes had made it obvious that they weren't close, not at all, even if Iron Man and Captain America were, when he'd told Tony about his relationships with the rest of the Avengers, or at least all he knew about it. Visibly relaxed, but not physically reaching out. A precise choice of words, made out not to sound willingly chosen.
Anthony Stark himself – well, no, Iron Man – giving an order or another – because he liked doing that, didn't he, Stark? All about control, all about what he wanted – to a SHIELD agent, and possibly keeping an eye on his transfer, because of course they couldn't be trusted – who? Steve himself? Afraid he'd make a run for it? The agents? Afraid one of them cared just a bit too much about free will and the possibility of getting Captain America out of custody no matter the means?
One thing Tony could say for himself was that he had never been afraid of Captain America, or of Steve Rogers for the matter. Clint often said Iron Man had the survival instincts of a lemming, which might be why he didn't react the way others did to Steve's judgmental assholishness – which was often deserved, but not always. Point was, whenever Steve tried to freaking judge him, Tony didn't back down. Maybe he apologized, sometimes he acknowledged that he had been wrong, but he did not shrink back.
Before Tony could ask what this was all about – and yes, you'd think people who wanted your death and / or suffering, which was apparently Hank's case, supposing that was Hank, of course; you'd think they wouldn't answer, but villains, and ill-intentioned people in general, actually had a weird tendency to monologue – the dot on the device flared gold, and the world pulsed around him.
Bad choice of words – perfect choice of words. It was exactly what he'd thought. And he could tell Carol understood the exact implications.
Sure, partly because Tony wasn't telling him everything – closer to nothing, really – but also because, even if he knew, he wouldn't want to understand anyway. The truth could be uncomfortable, and that wasn't something Steve Rogers was willing to admit most days.
He guessed, in a way, he was the abused – no continual harm, but permanent injury probably counted as abuse, right? He had been clear with Kathy about the specifics of their relationship – casual, unattached, and unexclusive. She had agreed. She also had priors of relationships that had ended poorly, even suspiciously – but Tony had been willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, of not judging someone on rumors alone, and look where that had gotten him. But even if her false claims were exposed, there would always be someone to doubt his word, to say he certainly deserved it. Because, as you all know, there was no smoke without fire.
Catching up with the scientific innovations took a lot of his time, but mostly he managed and he had yet to find something he couldn't eventually understand, so there was that. He just hoped Reed Richards wouldn't call to talk about anything above the fission of the atom in the next ten days because there was a lot he hadn't had time to read up on yet and he didn't think Richards wouldn't find it weird if Tony suddenly proved unable to remember how he'd delt – because yes, apparently Richards knew he was Iron Man – with the temporal interface in Central City. Sure, the man could be a bit obtuse when it came to human things, but it also meant he didn't know how to take a hint and he'd probably worry that Tony was losing his mind or whatever.
What was he supposed to do, in front of that? What could he even say? It wasn't like Steve actually wanted to hear the answers to all his questions, not as they were – not if they included Iron Man being Tony Stark. And well, they all did. So.
The marshal Steve asked for the wristband – Tony's ghost too, as it was – gave him a pitying glance alongside the wristband, and Steve had no idea why.
“Back on Throneworld, you said that sometimes you have to ask yourself which principle you'd rather fail in order to uphold another, and, well. We've lost Throneworld. All in all, our goal for coming to Earth, this time at least, isn't bad, but. No one considered simply asking for asylum. They just decided the planet was ours, and we were going to 'educate' humans, never mind that in order to do that we have to sacrifice some humans, and the superheroes in particular, nevermind that they only considered the option of putting ourselves as your masters, not as equals. So, when faced with the dilemma 'do we sacrifice our supremacy or other people?', I know where I stand. Even if... Even if that makes me traitress.”
Tony wondered for a moment if it was possible to be mostly straight, and only demisexual when it came to men – if that was even the word, people these days were way too snobbish when it came to someone's sexuality and romantic attractions. Like, my type is women, and Steve because I have feelings for him.
Not that any of this mattered, when Steve couldn't even bear to have a conversation with Tony Stark, and Tony Stark couldn't afford to let people know he was Iron Man.
One of the very first – in chronological order – reasons why he had recently been frozen to 40 K, had had his nervous system – which had already not been the original one – been rewritten into a new function, and had spent some weeks reliving all his memories.
Tony thought about turning around to face his lover and show him that no, that wasn't what he was going on about, but by the end of this conversation Steve would have a decision to make and he couldn't influence him like that.
He loved his country, really, he did. There was hope here, there could be progress. But unlike Steve, he also knew that the United States were not any better, in the end, than other countries. In general, of course, they weren't that bad a place to live in, compared to some other places, but it didn't change the fact that the people here were like everyone else. If you pushed them too far, too often, they'd snap and put you on a pyre, regardless of the long-term consequences.
Like the fact that they didn't actually have the right to claim themselves the best hands, to say they knew better all the time, without exception, and that of course if something happened they'd handle it themselves. Which was kind of ridiculous, actually, considering the Avengers had always more or less reported to higher authorities, at least when one of them had been involved in something dubious – or worse. Members had been pushed out when they'd done some problematic shit and didn't agree to even justify themselves, and some had even walked out by themselves when they'd thought they were endangering the team because something had to be done but someone would definitely pay the price for that. Steve should know, by now, that a level of cooperation was necessary for it to work – more than that, for them not to get arrogant. Wasn't it what he'd blamed Tony for, after the armor wars?
The door opened, and Steve stopped in the doorframe – Tony had no difficulty imagining him with his eyes fixed on a glint, somewhere on the chestplate, of metallic red, on Tony's unmoving form, as he wondered about what was happening and why there were no lights in their penthouse.
Besides, the man seemed happy with everything “back to normal”, so there was that. Maybe keeping the status quo was the best Tony could get.
Tony had made a sound he would never admit to have made as he had been flipped over, and so was very intent on focusing on basically anything else. The fact that Steve looked so damn content with himself, for example. Punk.
Tony, him, tended to go the other way – he knew how imperfect he was, but he still had to act, even with the knowledge that he could potentially be fucking it all up, because if he didn't and something happened anyway... He couldn't allow anxiety to freeze him. Even when he was right, though, he couldn't forget that no matter how rare it was, he could be wrong about that too.
Just as Sam put him down on the roof of a building – just as Steve's innards seemed to slosh inside him – he caught a glance of someone running away from the marshals and the agents, who couldn't shoot because of the crowd.
Tony cracked a smile from behind the helmet, and prepared himself to do the same with a joke, which would hopefully be better rendered to his audience.
Tony thought about asking if Steve had even considered the possibility that perhaps “Tony Stark” had given him the adamantium shield even while knowing that he'd get in his way. He thought about looking Steve dead in the eye, and asking him if he truly believed Mr. Stark to be idiotic enough to think Captain America could be bought. He thought about asking Steve to follow that train of thoughts right here, before him and out loud, just to see where exactly that brought him.
“The part about how some people throwing a temper tantrum might have given the good citizens of this country the impression that we fought only for ourselves?”
“I've been trying to figure out where exactly Tony went when he decided he'd rather wash his hands of the mess he'd made.”
The other Tony had disappeared with a terrified look on his face, just as the device had been activated. Whatever this was, it was messing with Extremis.
So he'd decided to go with the second option, then, dissing Tony Stark – just, without mentioning the last part about how Iron Man was disappointing him for not agreeing dumbly with Steve. Or perhaps Steve didn't think Iron Man intelligent enough to be able to make the distinction between what was “right” and what was “wrong”.
Tony made sure the message had disappeared, and got Peter not to talk about it to any of the others.
Not that Steve listened to Sersi, the Black Knight, Vision or Hercules – on that matter, everyone knew this was not Thor with a new taste in beards, and what exactly had happened to his favorite norsen... – there were more important problems here.
He heard the screams, and felt almost – good, or at least, relieved – that this time, it was only about him, not about...
That maybe, some of the people on Steve's side would go over to SHRA, just because their need to help would be more important than their own liberty.
When Steve walked out of the marshals' transport vehicle, he was surprised to see – the same crowd, with more or less the same signs for or against him, the same people as far as he could tell, except for those who weren't exactly at the same place as he remembered, a white guy who was altogether not there, or at least not visible, a black woman he hadn't noticed the first time around, and with his eidetic memory that meant something – Anthony Stark himself, standing just before the stairs to the courthouse, with several SHIELD agents surrounding him and keeping the journalists at bay.
Happy may be Pepper's husband, but he was also Tony's friend. No one – except Pepper – got to doubt his loss, no one got to say he didn't care, and more importantly, no one got to reduce Happy's fate to an insult against him.
He hadn't taken into account Steve's jealousy, either, but that was possibly only because that particular factor only worked in the case of that particular guess from Steve, a guess he hadn't thought possible to begin with.
Steve obviously wasn't willing to listen, and if Tony had to knock him out, so be it. Steve would probably try the same thing, if Tony let him, as soon as the conversation ended and he realized there was absolutely. Nothing. He. Could. Do. About. Tony's. Decision.
He laughed, and tried not to think about the way Steve looked somewhat angry, somewhat disgusted whenever the subject of conversation was Tony Stark's hot dates, and not Iron Man's. Steve would probably get along with Bethany, as it was, if they met out of any kind of context that related to Tony Stark – and once he'd find out who she was currently dating, Steve would probably make that face that said he thought someone was wasted on Tony Stark but he was too polite to say it out loud.
Okay, maybe a bit of an exaggeration. Things could always happen no matter the precautions taken. But it was true that the less precautions taken, the more things could go wrong. Steve had to know that. Rules weren't there to punish those who did nothing wrong, they were there to limit the power of those who did.
“I like to keep an eye on any piece of technology that walks around with my face, and anyway I need to make sure the world doesn't take on fire while I'm not available. Hill isn't a bad agent, but she's not cut for being at the top. Second-in-command, maybe. Still, my question. Did you get all that, Stark?”
Not that he'd back down from handling this catastrophe as best as possible, if they refused his conditions, because in the end he was trying to do as much damage control as possible, even if it ended up being at his personal cost – which, let's be honest, was a given. But one day, perhaps, he might not try anymore, and the fact that they couldn't know if and when it would happen was enough of a threat in itself.
He wasn't entirely sure why he was so angry – he knew, of course, the reasons, but he didn't get the intensity, this was not... – but he didn't care. Not right now, not right here. If... If Captain America came up with a better idea, then good, they'd follow it. But as long as he didn't – and no, just leaving wasn't a solution, it was irresponsibility, it was... – they'd need to turn off the Supreme Intelligence.
But Extremis was repairing the damage already – no matter the damage, as long as there was a coherency to what was left behind, as long as his brain wasn't too damaged.
Tony winced. He did not want to think about the Red Skull using Steve's fondness for Iron Man against Captain America – also, nazis and homosexuals feelings didn't mix well.
“Not falling for the compliment, Steve. And yes, maybe you did something different for once, you have the right to do that, of course, but what I want to know is if you actually know that you did it for those reasons or if you're only guessing.”
Not to mention the fact that Tony just didn't feel that way about men – at least not sexually; romantically, to be honest... he'd have to think about it. He had never fallen in love with a man, sexual orientation notwithstanding, but it didn't mean it couldn't happen at some point. He knew talks about sexual and romantic orientations had gotten very confusing in the last decades, and frankly he didn't want to label himself with one word or another when there wasn't even a way to know for sure what you were until it was to late too talk about it because your whole life had passed and thus you knew what did it for you and what didn't – the scientist in him mostly rebuked at the way talks of sexual orientation were just so vague and relied too much on identifying with a particular definition that no one seemed to agree on, and not actual facts, to be honest.
“But obviously... He walked out, he didn't take his responsabilities, he didn't stay at the helm, he... So it can't be a power-grab. If anything, it's him not dealing with what he's done, with...”
Which wasn't surprising, considering how he had never said anything face to face with Tony Stark, how he had never voiced his disdain for the man even though it had visibly dripped all over their non-relationship. Politeness, right. Or maybe Steve thought he'd be petty enough to take his support away from the Avengers if he let it be known. It seemed more than likely.
Tony went to sleep on that disturbing revelation and a disturbing – but expected by now – wish for a glass of brandy, and woke up with a headache – apparently hangovers could be had from not drinking, too – and a hard on, remnant from a wet dream that he wasn't going to forget anytime soon – it involved a lot of panting, mostly, because the images were foggy, probably thanks to Tony's lack of experience with men, but that didn't make it any less memorable when he could recognize Cap's voice and his own in that panting.
Also, Tony was – vaguely, sure, there were things going on as always, especially after Temugin and the manhunt for Tony that had ended up reflecting on her, and how she hadn't liked him asking about Happy first thing in his call, but him loving her didn't mean he'd stopped caring about everything else in his life and at the time Happy's life had been in the balance, just... just like, him loving Steve didn't mean Iron Man would shrug off his responsibilities each and every time Steve didn't like it – taken right now, and the fact that Steve's crush was totally mutual did not erase his feelings for Rumiko. No matter that both relationships seemed to be doomed right now – but, maybe, maybe Rumiko just needed a little time, and...
He told Rhodey that his eyes had been opened, that if a baby's life was worth saving, his own was too, yada yada yada.
The situation was too familiar, though. He was almost starting to act like he was in armor, as if it was Iron Man talking animatedly, with a smile – no smile this time, but he remembered how that felt, and if Tony didn't manage to make the situation right, he might never get to smile like this again – and not Tony Stark, asking for help from a man who didn't like him one bit.
Tony watched – his scanners looking for something, anything – as Marvel Girl managed to get a few survivors out of the ruins of the school that had been at the center of the explosion. Cap was standing next to him, overlooking the rescue – so busy being decent about the burnt skeletons that lay in the dust that he couldn't see the dawn of blood Stamford would stand for.
“With all due respect, Mr. Stark, it really is an Avenger matter. I'd prefer not to discuss it with you.”
If Tony hadn't been on a power-grab – considering he'd let the job to Gyrich of all people, considering he'd basically disappeared not long after Steve's death – then what?
Tony snorted, and gave him a paperclip version of the events with Hydra, Bruce, the armor, and the fact that he was now a cardiac cripple because karma was a bitch and apparently he'd deserved it – but, surprisingly enough, not enough to outright kill him, when really, pain was a terrible punishment but it also meant he was still in a position to make more damage, whereas a dead Tony Stark would be utterly unable to do anything, good or bad.
“It's still what they heard. And they used it to justify the fact that they didn't want to step in, because a lot of them thought Tony had ordered the hit on you, because they didn't like having been told that they should answer to someone, because, because, because. And now, now that we all know the Red Skull had you killed, not Tony, now that it's obvious they can't use your name and memory to justify his execution, well.”
War Machine – Rhodes – and Jan shared a look, and obviously made a decision because they looked back at Rogers at the same time – and if the faceplate kept Rhodes' expression hidden, Jan's expression was telling.
Tony arrived a bit late at his meeting with the Fury-LMD – which Tony was reasonably sure was working as much for Hill's SHIELD as it did for Nick himself no matter what anyone else thought on the matter – about the global summit, just in time to hear Dugan inform Nick-who-wasn't-Nick n°28 that Tony Stark had definitely blown a casket, and wasn't that worrying considering all the pies he had his fingers in and the fact that a superhero worked for him?
The woman squinted her eyes at him, but she didn't look upset by his statement, unlike the other skrulls who looked positively fuming at what they surely thought of as defiance.
Carol grabbed his arm – it would have been light, if he hadn't been able to feel the tension in her grip – and pushed him towards the door.
Stark, of course, was nowhere to be seen – was it for the better, because Steve didn't want his gloating presence here on the street? Was it for the worst, because Stark couldn't even stand by what he'd done? In the end, he'd rather believe the worst from Anthony Stark, because then he couldn't be disappointed anymore.
Tony was still having trouble processing what had happened – a guy who could manipulate all molecules, really? What need did people have for science if that guy, who obviously had no idea what he was doing and might accidentally turn air poisonous on the entire Earth or something just as cataclysmic, existed? – when he heard Steve's voice and looked up. The Silver Surfer had somehow gotten them out of the maniac's crushing machine and on the floor below, and they really, really had to find a way to deal with the Molecule Man before he went all Galactus on the planet.
Unless, of course, they knew those were monitored by someone, at least. The point wasn't to make everyone unmask.
What was that question? He couldn't even begin to untangle how he'd be able to gather any kind of hint on how to behave as Tony Stark around Cap from wherever this conversation would be going.
The problem, apparently, was that Steve didn't believe Tony Stark when he told him Iron Man was acting of his own volition even when that volition was the same as Tony Stark's, and he didn't believe it either when Iron Man himself told Steve the very same thing. And that, obviously, wasn't something Tony could fix. Steve would believe what he wanted to believe.
Tony couldn't – not this time, not again, not with everything else – do it. He just couldn't. Normally he'd have gritted his teeth and let it pass, but this time he just... He couldn't. He needed to get out of here. He needed to...
“Why not. I guess you're trying to catch up with... everything. Might as well talk about it over a drink.”
As close as he'd ever get to touch Steve again, he thought – bitter, considering the most actual human contact he'd ever had with Steve was during the whole Carnelian debacle. He pat – with the armor on, difficult to do much more gentle – his way up to Steve's face, ended up cupping his cheek. Absently hoped it didn't hurt – not quite able to throw away the vicious wish that it did, at least a little.
Killed someone – again, because that was what happened at one point or another, Iron Man could save as many people as he wanted, Tony Stark could pay for as many rescue efforts as he did, it would always come back to this – and wasn't that bad enough already?
Steve gritted his teeth. Was that all that was left of the Avengers, in the wake of Tony's fuck-ups?
Eitherway, it all boiled down to the fact that Howard hadn't only been a drunk, but also a mean drunk – Tony couldn't say for sure, of course, but he was under the impression that, himself, he was more of a sad drunk and went mean only when pushed. Not that he'd ever ask someone for confirmation.
Steve didn't seem to buy the tennis excuse, though – not that Tony was really trying to justify himself, at that point. That was not a thing he felt like he had to justify.
The Illuminati – they hadn't called themselves that yet, only he did it, but that was essentially what they were – had decided to go and bring a little warning to the Skrulls – the Kree, at least, weren't hell-bent on stealing their planet, even if they didn't generally care much for Earth and its inhabitants. Of course, that had gone pear-shaped, but Tony wasn't particularly surprised here – everything always tended to get worse before getting better, and they had gone in without proper intel, so, there was that. And sure, you could call them arrogant for making that decision, but at the same time, was pretending nothing was wrong and the Skrulls weren't going to come back like goddamn ostrichs all that better?
Still not taking the helmet off – he could probably check for more things spying on them with his scans than the device could, anyway – Tony snorted.
Tony wasn't sure there was anything she could say to actually convince him, but he was giving her a chance.
And before Steve could ask more, the younger man was spinning a web to the next building and disappearing from his sight.
Before Wilson could say anything along the lines of “but he could surprise you” or how Steve was a great man and not like everyone else, he added:
Maybe this was it. Maybe this was the time Steve proved him wrong. Maybe this was what he'd waited for all along. Maybe this was the moment Captain America gave him – Iron Man, not Tony Stark, but at this point he'd take it – a chance.
He'd tell them himself, though, because if they were going to resent someone, at least that way it wouldn't be Iron Man. If he one day managed to get back in the game...
Then again, neither had Tony. So either Tony had been wrong, or... Or he'd been in the wrong and had known it. Hadn't cared. Steve still wasn't certain which one it was.
He took a deep breath, passed a hand through his hair, pushing away the headache that was coming – he couldn't hear the gulps of scotch at the next table, he couldn't smell bourbon from the glass the guy behind him had in hand, he couldn't see the color of the beer in Steve's mug through it, but he could imagine it just right, and it was like he could, like he just had to extend a hand and everything would be back to the good old days, with a brandy and a smile as everything horrible in his life fadded away for a few hours.
Or perhaps it was Steve who wasn't paying attention, because five minutes later he noticed they both had a beer and he hadn't even noticed it getting there. He stared dumbfoundedly at the bottle for a moment, blinked, and decided it really wasn't that important.
Tony flinched under the armor, just as Steve reached for him, looking completely lost and still somehow alert, as if – as if there was anything to be done, anything he could do to help, and God, why did Tony even come here?
Of course, Tony, stubborn as he always was, had managed to be both, to become the first and stay the second. Which had put him through so much pain...
Steve grabbed his arm, and flipped him over and into a wall – not violently, no, but still, Tony ended upside down with his back against a wall and his head and shoulders on the mat, so.
More outraged at the thought that Iron Man could doubt his morals – hypocritical, considering that he'd been doing the same to Iron Man and Tony Stark for the last decade – than concerned at the fact that, maybe, one of the people working for him might have decided to go ahead and not abide by the Steve Rogers Book of Rules. Probably not even considering it.
"If you know anyone who's good with communications tech... or, heck, maybe it could be you, we're going to need alternative comms. I'm going to assume these are compromised."
Tony snorted at himself, reached for the nearest bottle, and contemplated drinking it now, even if he hadn't drunk anything since after the Carnelian ambassador.
He'd have liked to say Tony would never have hired someone to shoot him – even in a non-life-threatening way – except, except he'd learned the hard way that with Stark it was always best to assume the worst, if only so as not to be disappointed, hadn't he?
So Steve searched for something else to think about, to chase the doubts away, to annihilate the questions which came with it.
“I could have brought your 'friends' over, you know. I knew who Iron Man was, and everyone knew where to find you. You were, after all, 'the most successful sapiens' under a rule of mutants. But I didn't.”
Not sure what good it would do, after everything. After all the times before. After all the failures to communicate.
Tony didn't like it either, but what could you do. He met his friend's eyes, and wondered how his life would have been if he'd never met Captain America – not necessarily better, but almost certainly easier to live with. Less painful.
Just... Reasons. An explanation. Something, at least, that would show Steve how stubborn and hypocritical he could be.
So yeah, maybe he had personal, selfish reasons to do what he did. Maybe. But what was certain was that doing it was giving him a reason to live, a reason to go on and try, and maybe his selfishness would save a live or two.
Steve found it a bit weird that Jarvis would leave just because the Avengers hadn't been able to tell it wasn't him – it didn't sound like the old butler at all.
A terrible thought crossed his mind, and it made sense, how could he not have thought of that, how did he not – Nick had to have informed people about who was in the Iron Man armor, now, it was the logical thing to do, hell, Tony would do the same just so that they'd put a bullet in his brain if it was so easy to make sure no one else got hurt, except you'd need a special bullet and who was to say that 1) he'd let himself be killed if he'd really gone mental, 2) the person who was behind all this, supposing there was one, didn't have other plans even after Tony was done for.
“You know, we'd prepared a way out for you, and then you just had to go and get yourself shot in the middle of it.”
Misty Knight soon emerged from the late-evening crowd, looking him up and down, as if to reassure herself it was really him. Most people did that, these days.
Oh God, he was tired. He had a feeling he was forgetting about something important, but what? He couldn't remember – what was it, about four obligatory hours of sleep a night to be able to function normally? Or was it three? No, three was from before he became Iron Man, when his physical and emotional activity hadn't been quite as strenuous even if his mental activity had been roughly the same – which didn't tell him what he was forgetting, just why.
Aside from the fact that Steve, once again, didn't even question how exactly Tony could have pulled placing Iron Man inside SHRA without giving his identity to anyone, how he'd managed to be put at the head of Registration without revealing who was his bodyguard, well. It wasn't entirely wrong.
Maybe Steve should start looking into this – Tony would do it for him, but Tony was dead, and Tony wasn't on his side. That was, if anything, something he could do in the mean time, before he got an idea of what to do about SHRA.
Then again, it could easily lead you to overlook the possibility of you being wrong – something that, ironically, Tony had often been accused of. It could make one wonder how much worse it would be for someone almost no one ever confronted about their screw-ups – because yes, Steve did have skeletons in his closet, but Tony had always been there to tidy up behind him, to take care of the political toes on which Steve kept stamping down, to make sure that despite Steve's utter lack of sensibility the Avengers, and heroes in general, could continue to operate without hell raining on them, and, more importantly, to make it so that Steve wouldn't notice how much work this really was.
A tomato thrown at him hardly registered as a threat, and it was unlikely that it actually was how it had all started.
Now Thor was back and Tony was hidden back in his armor, but he'd never felt quite as exposed in his life before – not even with Wong-Chu checking over his every move, not with the knowledge that Ho Yinsen had had his hands inside Tony's chest and Tony hadn't been aware of it until he'd woken up with a bandaged torso and pain and a sword of Damocles over his head, not under the constant threat of dozens of terrorists and war-lords and other murderers who'd come together in Afghanistan for no other reason than because it was convenient and they wanted to watch the world burn and guess what, Tony Stark could make that happen if they managed to force him to do their bidding.
“But I went to see Hill yesterday. She brought up Registration, and I swear to God, Shellhead, she was about to have me shot when I said no. I had to jump out of the damn helicarrier to get away.”
“I'm sorry. I know Iron Man said there was a team meeting. It's my fault. I had Stark Enterprises business in LA and I'm afraid I kept him too long. He... he sent me to make his apologies. Clear the air.”
“Is it mind-control? Is that why you've been doing... things... you wouldn't normally do? Or... Is he holding something over you? Can we... Can we help?”
He could say that maybe he'd rather be shot down than have that happen ever again, not that it'd get there because accountability meant they might get a chance to act on it before it went too far, and not that Steve would ever get it because he had never been used like that.
Steve, despite all the shit he'd dealt with, hadn't faced mind control like some of them – and sure, some of it was because he was mentally resistant to that kind of things, but there were so many ways to be controlled, not all of them were an affair of mental strength. More than that, his powers were, while above the usual human's, rather tame, so the physical damage he could do if he lost it – which didn't happen to Captain America, of course it didn't happen to him, until one day it would and then he'd have to face the music like everyone else, and because there wouldn't be any kind of regulations in place, maybe he'd get away with it, or maybe they'd just decide to execute him and be done with it – was minimal, compared to, say, what the Sentry could cause. Or Carol, when she'd been drinking. Tony, too, and surprisingly enough the damage from his drunken days was minimal, compared to the times he'd been taken over, because he'd been lucky and had stopped before it had gotten a chance to happen again.
instead of telling him how good it was that he'd made anything at all, least something that actually worked just as well as what already existed – and Howard was right, wasn't he, because people didn't care for solutions that were no better than what they already had, because people wanted perfection, they wanted progress, and they didn't like waiting for it, it had to come right away, an ideal already, with no drawbacks and a nice bow on it.
Locked back into the duty of forcing himself to become more, to give more, to try and be enough. Because anything less would be selfish.
Spider-Man arrived about ten minutes later, looked at the headless corpse of Mallen, and disappeared right after having made an off-color joke – possibly to throw up.
It had never worked for Tony – unless Tony went clean-shaven, put on glasses, and / or dyied his hair blond. Steve could pass off as a Captain-America-like person, even while looking like himself, whereas Tony was always Tony Stark, unless he actively tried not to be.
For the people, for their security, for their right not to wonder whether or not the superheroes would actually be tried if one day they decided they were done with being heroes, just for today, just long enough to ruin thousands of lives, just because they weren't in a good mood. For the heroes, too, because if there were no laws pertaining to them it would be way too easy to not treat them as human beings – or, more generally speaking, as people – if something happened, because if they weren't bound by the law then nothing would bind anyone who did something to them either.
Steve gave her a tentative smile – she had sided with the law during Registration, but she'd also helped him and the others occasionally, and he wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Especially of the fact that Tony had... let her do it? Sure, he probably hadn't been happy with her and her decision that one time, but she hadn't been amongst the prisoners at Prison 42, so.
Did it even really matter, when the end result was that Tony was dead in both realities, and Steve had something to do with both facts – would it be better if Tony had died and Steve had nothing to do with it?
The worst, of course, was that Tony understood. Which meant he couldn't even really blame them, and could only blame himself for doing something good and suffering because of it. No good deed went unpunished, indeed.
He'd have said something about how extremists and heroes had a thing in common, that they were always stubborn in their views of the world – and they had to be, or the first ones wouldn't be able to do the horrors they did, and the second ones would doubt too often to be efficient – and that meant that, the one time heroes were wrong they also were as unlikely to see it in time as terrorists were, but comparing Steve to those people was not something he wanted to do in any circumstances, so.
Two days before a business partner that he didn't remember at all had joked and told him he looked like he'd found the fountain of youth, and asked when he'd commercialize it. It was telling, he thought, that a woman who didn't know him as more than an acquaintance could tell, when no one close to him had even commented.
A moment to breathe deeply, to calm himself down – he didn't deserve to be calm, but he needed to be if he wanted to stop all this, he needed to stop crying, to start being useful again, he might be nothing more than an instrument in this story, but an instrument could be used different ways, and it was time to use it to determine what was going on.
Anthony shrugged, and went back to watching the screens. It wouldn't do if someone changed something in his past that he didn't want to change, something that'd disturb the plan that had started to grow in his mind after he'd realized Tony's two friends were in Chronopolis. Kang had made sure Anthony himself would not do anything to compromise his plans, but had he taken into account what Anthony could say, if not do?
Unsurprisingly, Steve's expression suddenly turned sour. Eyes squinted, just a little, barely enough to be noticeable, but still, Tony was right there, in front of him, and Tony spent half his life reading people's reactions, of course he could tell. The curb of his mouth moved just enough to let disdain show – Tony was well acquainted with that facial expession, the one that said you had done something wrong and there was no respecting you for that, he used to see it often enough on his father's face.
Tony was sitting in the dark, in their bedroom, alone, carefully not touching the brand-new, hotroad red chestplate that was now allowing him to stay alive – the Prometheus armor had not been meant for that, and yet here they were, one victim brought to his death and another unable to be physically out of the armor.
He remembered the adamantium shield in his office, where Steve had left it to mark his anger. Which was stupid, really, the “Captain” should better have kept it and done what was right with it, even if just to spite Tony – which, of course, wouldn't have worked, because it was the point of giving Steve a shield even when he knew it'd probably be used against him, but it wasn't like Steve would ever see that.
Steve – Captain Freaking America, the man with a plan, the one who will never fail you, the symbol you should respect no matter what – and Jan came by at some point, back when Tony was still at the penthouse, offering “help”. As if Steve cared, as if there was anything they could do. They couldn't revive the dead, could they? They couldn't undo his failures. Jan, he believed when she said she wanted to help him. Didn't mean she could.
And sure, superheroes hadn't, for the most part, asked to have powers, they hadn't chosen to have an assault rifle in their hands, but the things was, they did have it, and deciding that their rights were worth more than the rights of others not to be threatened every day of the week by someone who had an assault rifle and no control over it – or worst, over themselves – wasn't any better than the contrary, and would just get more people killed.
More than that, it was exactly what he had been about to anounce himself anyway. He had already turned the armor over to City Hall – minus everything that made it functional, of course – and put Iron Man in time-out, so to say.
After all, if Steve Rogers thought he knew why someone did something, there was just no way it was for any other reason, was it?
“Pepper left me two messages, Tony, and she was worried and angry in the first and careful in the second, saying you'd fired her and disappeared, then that you'd been hurt. So, what happened?”
It was obvious how much Steve didn't believe one word of what he had just said, or at least, how jealous and disgusted he was that he wasn't the one who got Iron Man's unwavering loyalty – never thinking, of course, that such loyalty, such accord between Tony and Iron Man's ideals could only come from one thing.
He needed to sit down, and to explode his own skull with a – wait, shame there were no bottles of alcohol left around here, that would have been more than appropriate.
Tony did not, as it was, expect to survive long. Sure, he had Erica and Abe's team working on cryogenic suspension, and a solution beyond that, but he also was painfully aware that the odds of that working in time were low. Experimental procedure for a condition without precedent, the fact that no one – except one supersoldier who couldn't be used as an example because of the serum – had been successfully frozen and revived, the possibility that even then he would just start dying again... He'd take his chance, because not doing it ended with him dying anyway, but that was it.
After that, he went and thanked Sam Wilson for his hard work, assured him again that the Avengers would cover any medical bill he might have after the fiasco with the Red Skull, and gave him a blinding smile as he said that, obviously, there was no need to mention to Steve anything that could upset him. Just, if Steve asked and Iron Man wasn't around at the moment, mention he was doing fine, no further complication, nothing.
After all, that would mean this wasn't about Steve himself, or Tony Stark and Iron Man's unbelievable loyalty to the man – right back to Steve, who, as a consequence, came in second, and wasn't that inacceptable?
Tony failed to react, mostly because he wasn't particularly surprised that Steve wouldn't let it go. The man could be like a dog with a bone, and the fact that they'd gotten into a relationship had only made it even more actual with basically anything that pertained to Tony.
There was an open file on the table, he finally noticed, and Steve was staring at it with his hands fisted, instead of looking at Iron Man.
The various TV crews, the journalists – in another time, Peter might have been there too, and Steve wouldn't have even known that Spider-Man was out there snapping pictures of him, but thanks to Stark, that was another era – even some random people were asking him questions, and the marshals answered in his stead – no comments.
“You know, if you want back in one of these days... There's always a place for you on the Avengers.”
But apparently Franklin Richards had – at least – unconsciously caught on the lingering feelings – did that mean Iron Man and Cap behaved like his parents, for him to recognize it? Did they behave like a married couple? – between Iron Man and Captain America, because he'd ended up with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers being a happy – if nonsensical – couple in his mental creation.
He was back to wondering, how many things had he done that he didn't remember, were there any other crimes to add to these murders, that he didn't even know about it.
He held out a hand for them to shake, knowing full well how unlikely it would be that Captain America would ever need to act on that last chance. Unless anything big enough happened in the little time he had left, they could both act as if nothing had ever happened, as if Steve didn't hate him with all his soul, and they wouldn't actually need to show it.
Tony fell next to Steve, exhausted – his lungs, burning – and barely managed to bring his right arm over his face, not entirely sure why anymore, but it was important and...
He wondered if, perhaps, Steve would wonder why exactly Tony Stark would let Iron Man order him around. Why Iron Man would think it a good idea to send Tony Stark of all people to apologize to Captain America.
Steve was smiling, and Tony almost wanted to point out that he had given him the opportunity to get to know about Tony Stark, and Steve had rejected it. But Iron Man couldn't know about this as far as Cap was concerned, and this conversation had been about making Steve feel better after Zemo, not about blaming him for not wanting to be the friend of a man who probably didn't deserve it anyway.
If only he could care enough to look past what he wanted to see, what he thought was going on, and actually pay attention to what was really going on.
Well. Iron Man still had to answer to Tony Stark's schedule, which was why he interrupted Steve as the man was reading his newspaper.
Tony was wearing a hot pink vest with SUPERSTAR written on it, a mock-gift from one of his previous casual girlfriends – one of the rare ones who had actually cared that he wasn't dead in a ditch somewhere, she had always been too kind – which he was wearing anyway because let not it be said that Tony Stark couldn't rock everything and anything. The only times he didn't look perfectly good – if not fashionable – were usually when he was well on his way to “not fine”. Otherwise he'd probably be able to wear eyeliner and a potato bag and look good in it – not that he'd want to, but if he had to do it, no way he'd act ashamed and let anyone know he didn't actually like it.
“And, you see, because you do know the problems a cape has to deal with, and because none of them do stick with you in those problems, and because they don't consider you one of them, well. You have the outsider and the insider's view of the situation. So, I've got to ask: who else would make sure things are fair for both sides?”
Steve was staring at his hands, focusing on the problem at hand – and being consequently oblivious to all the other problems that would follow.
The marshal took a step, told him his trial had been rescheduled for the next week, supposing he didn't relapse, and added that they'd discuss his transfer later in the afternoon, before leaving too.
So Steve barely stopped a moment, squinting at the lone figure – Stark had several people with him, true, but he looked unexpectedly alone amongst the SHIELD uniforms – as he noticed the armor had gone – the picture of Stark's dead eyes came to his mind, and he wondered why the man hadn't had the armor on back in the dream, when that would have saved them both, as long as the sniper wasn't using some particular, heavy-duty munitions.
“Interesting, isn't it, how you're one of us, T'Challa, one of the 'good guys', one of the super-people, and the king of your country. Even putting aside the obvious issue of power play, because while I'm certain Storm is acting out of concern for human and mutant rights, I also know that you cannot allow your personal morals to entirely overwrite your duties as a king... Even putting that aside, T'Challa, I find it interesting that a country whose king is one of us, and thus has the legitimity and the ability to deal with any superpowered issue, is rooting for the freedom of action of heroes.”
Steve barely looked surprised. He did look angry – at Tony Stark – for a moment, though, before going back to trying to cajole Iron Man into changing his mind.
Janet took a step towards him, but her eyes were drawn to the screen where Kathleen Dare had just shot Tony and left him for dead.
He couldn't say he wasn't relieved when his armor did not disappear at the hand of the Molecule Man, like Thor's hammer did, like Steve's shield did, like the Silver Surfer's board did. For all he knew, they'd have learned who he really was, and then, somehow, for some unfathomable reason that didn't even have anything to do with Tony being Iron Man, but that would nonetheless follow the reveal, the Avengers would leave him behind, too – assuming they didn't care about the fact that he had a history of cardiac problems, which was unlikely anyway, or about the fact that he was, well, him.
After all, if T'Challa had really wanted to respond, he would have made it so that Tony would listen.
“Yes, Iron Man. He's been a good teammate and a good friend. So, thank you. I'd never have met him without you.”
He also didn't seem to understand that they did need the rules, because it wasn't just the Avengers this time, it was everyone, and everyone included the guys who had a tendency to leave bodies in their trail, the ones who wanted to do good but really had a problem up there, the ones who didn't care about doing good but worked for the higher powers because it was easier than being a supervillain – or, you know, a minion. People Steve frowned at generally, but got away with tolerating because they weren't part of the team, because they weren't their responsibility.
One of the marshals – the darker-skinned one, the one who semeed to be the most considerate towards Steve, given the circumstances – turned around to confront the man who'd thrown the tomato, and...
This time he would just focus on the fact that, one way or another, Iron Man and the Captain would have to work together again, and no matter Steve's feelings on the subject, they would have to make it work. At least whenever their goals would happen to be the same.
And even if Tony couldn't stop imagining Steve ramming that brand new shield in the armor, as the Captain would stand in Iron Man's way, even if he knew that, no matter what, Steve wouldn't even listen – not that Tony could explain and be believed – even if he knew he was giving Steve something that would be used against him...
Still, Steve had reasons to be angry – always taking everything personally, as his attempt to step down from chairmanship from earlier demonstrated.
Peter jumped at Tony – Iron Man's voice, and turned to look at him with a deer-in-the-highlights look. Why exactly, Tony wasn't sure, but this was Peter. He got startled and looked vaguely guilty for no reason on a daily basis.
Tony just stared at his friend for the longest time, as no words or explanations came to him – he was pretty certain he'd know if he had been doing something like that to Jan, and since he didn't, and Jan wasn't one to lie like that, he...
“It didn't. It... didn't matter to me. But now, with Registration, with everything... You're standing for accountability. For transparency. And no one knows who you are. Not even the Avengers. Hell, even when I had a secret identity to the public, it was never secret to you. You've known my name from the beginning.”
Carol, though, shifted on her seat – not looking him in the eyes anymore. Better to address that first.
If Iron Man's secret identity hadn't been a secret identity, Tony just knew that the answers would have been different, that he'd have gotten muttering about how he wasn't taking his role as an Avenger seriously enough and maybe he should try and figure out what were his actual priorities instead of wasting their time. But the miracle of a secret identity was that your reasons being secret and personal, hence completely abstract and vague, no one started nitpicking about them as long as you did your job – the moment the secret was open, though, everyone suddenly thought they knew better than you why you were a failure of a human being.
Besides, that was only for the personal aspect of revealing himself as Iron Man, and even if, say, people were willing to believe him, a little self-satisfaction was definitely not worth all the other consequences. If there hadn't been quite as many super – or not-so-super, for the matter – villains running around, Tony might have considered telling the truth, but as things were, it would just attract even more unwanted attention onto SI, so, that was a no anyway.
Tony could see the gears starting into motion in her head, and he wasn't entirely sure about what she was deducing exactly, but he sure as hell hoped it wasn't about how he'd actually gotten the bruise.
It made him think of Steve, who scowled at the Tower but still accepted it as a HQ – since, you know, they needed one – while complaining about the fact that it wasn't the Mansion, completely disregarding the possibility that maybe “Mr. Stark” just couldn't take rebuilding it once more, just to see it being reduced to rubbles again and again. That maybe, the Tower wasn't a means to “lord it over people”, but simply a practical option in NYC that wasn't emotionally charged with pain and misery.
Tony was almost tempted to say yes – somehow ignoring the issue that SHIELD would demand confirmation of his identity in the process of “fixing” his “misguided” actions and then Tony wouldn't be able not to show them the truth, which would result in a lot of unpleasant consequences, starting with the fact that Steve's promise would end up thrown with the trash – just to see, in a few years perhaps, a Guardsman going back home with his regulation armor and murder his wife and children because he was having an existential crisis and wanted to elope with his young mistress and become a mercenary, or a random villain gaining control of the Vault and mass-producing the armor to arm their minions, or whatever, because something always happened, and Tony knew he couldn't eliminate all risks, but he could minimize them and at least when something he had put on the market himself was misused, it was a risk he had agreed to. Then in that hypothetic future that would never happen, Steve and him would have a discussion about how it wasn't Tony's fault that assholes were assholes, to which he would answer that his fault or not, he could have done something about it and then the victims wouldn't be victims, which made the fact that they were dead partially his fault, and Steve's for having convinced him to not do it.
“I'm not saying you didn't care about him, Captain. Only that you weren't his friend. There's a difference, you know.”
They walked out of the cell, and just as they were going to board the vehicle of the marshals waiting for him – who, then, would get him to the courthouse – Steve caught sight of a glint of red in the corner of his eye.
Then Captain America's voice rose up again, and sounded vaguely flat, as if he was trying to control his tone, not to let anything be heard of what he felt about that.
And if he wasn't, then there still was an enormous problem because that meant that, somehow, someone or something had managed to influence him into acting drunk without actual alcohol being involved.
Kooning made a face, though, as he understood what was going on, as Hill's eyes widened at the sight of the faceplate, as the president took a deep breath when he saw the undersuit creeping at the edges of Tony's business suit.
He swallowed, imagined the whole dive going up into flames, the alcohol burning bright, and himself standing in the middle, entirely sober for the last time. His eyes left Steve's mug, and a smile pushed itself onto his face.
Barely listening at this point, he almost didn't notice Steve's next words – and in a way, he supposed it would have been better if he hadn't heard them.
Steve tried to turn around as he headed for the breakfast his guards had left on the small table, so that he wouldn't have to see the ghost's – Tony's – face and reaction to that statement, but he still caught the subsequent rolling of the eyes.
Right. Which was why he had almost no friends left, why a would-be-terrorist had almost blown him up the other week, why he was getting blamed for everything, why one of his remaining friends was comatose, why his only other friend had just asked him to kill Happy in his sleep, why Sue was here laying her problems with Reed on him as if Reed was completely unable to think by himself, which about took the cake.
Which was, wow, so freaking untrue Tony didn't even have an answer to that. How many times exactly had he responded with such an accusation, even when he thought Steve was in the wrong, and Steve hadn't been the one to initiate it? How many veiled insults, in Steve's words, towards Tony Stark – and the fact that Steve didn't know he was Tony Stark didn't matter, not on this point, because what had Tony Stark ever done to deserve such contempt from Captain America? Tony might not think he was worthy of Steve's admiration, but that didn't mean he had no right to some kind of human decency and respect.
Or, close enough. Now Hill, Kooning, and the President of the United States knew too. Which meant they could aim the weapons they would need to take him down if it came to that – weapons he was going to give to them, too, or at least some of them, just like Rhodey had others in the War Machine armor, just in case.
People opened a way as they walked out, barely not uncomfortable at the sight of Spider-Man's costume – good thing Steve was in civies, really. People might still like Captain America, but he'd also gotten a few distrustful looks, which was, he guessed, fair, considering how some of those people might have lived in the buildings they had... in the buildings... around the Baxter Building. Before.
Anthony watched the monitors as Kang had told him to, his attention unfortunately drawn to the moments of his life he liked the least, from the worst betrayals to the small reaffirmations that no one actually cared that much, not enough to stand by him, not enough to give him a chance, not enough to even try and understand. The times he hadn't been enough, too, and in general all the times he'd suffered.
But no. It didn't happen, and Tony couldn't imagine Steve doing that. Captain America, after all, was a good man, and would never do that.
“If that's what you're going to ask... Steve, I'm happy you're alive, I'm happy you're well, I'm happy you're back, but if this is what you're going to say...”
“...range said you'd have a difficult time staying awake the first day or so. I mean, after the shooting, we had a bit of a hard time getting you to safety, especially after what happened with the second shooting, and it might be that you were a bit more roughed up than you should have been in that state, plus I think there was something weird with that bullet, from what I hear SHIELD is all over it, not that they talk to us, but...”
Never mind that Steve had always done the exact same thing Rhodey was doing right now, and that, because he was still convinced he was right – always, without question – he didn't acknowledge it either.
Steve's answer was tentative, then, and infuriatingly understanding when it really wasn't about that.
How ironic, really, that the one who brandished his trust in superheroics as a principle of goodness was here the one who first used a measure of restriction that could be considered an inappropriate use of force against someone trying to talk things out.
But, admitting that would be admitting that Steve Rogers could be petty and judgmental, and they couldn't have that, could they?
Just as Steve's back-up blundered in – yet another proof that either Steve had lied, or he didn't have quite the grip he thought he had on his troops – Tony caught a look on his face. Understood that, of all things, Steve didn't see why Happy mattered, why they should feel concerned over his fate, not when “Iron Man” wasn't on his side to begin with, not when he'd been “betrayed” by his “best friend”.
Steve probably didn't think that, maybe, Happy was Iron Man's friend. Or Tony Stark's, for the matter, because as everyone knew, Tony Stark didn't have friends, only people he used and cast aside afterwards, as evidenced by Peter's current presence within Steve's ranks..
Steve took a moment to look around before answering. For a second he made a face – Tony wasn't quite sure at what – before his eyes fell back on Iron Man and locked themselves there.
And the fact that it did was the exact reason why Tony couldn't take Steve's offered “help”. Why he tazed Steve, in the end, and went on to do what he had started.
After all, Tony was trying to be responsible here: he might not have noticed right away that he had crossed the line, but the moment he'd actually endangered innocents because he was flying drunk, he decided to stop being Iron Man. He didn't wait for the second time it went wrong, he didn't refuse to accept the truth. He could obviously not continue being a reliable CEO for SI, so he was stopping that too. What was the point of fighting for your rights to something when all that would come out of it would be more hurt for everyone else?
He didn't say anything about how he hadn't even received an “invitation” to this meeting, how he'd had to hear about it through “Mr. Stark”, as “Mr. Stark” was the one who made it all possible – his mansion, his money, his contacts for the most part, his responsibility when it didn't work, and his blame when people thought it wasn't enough.
It was rare for the entire team to be so indisposed at the same time, though. They'd probably see the message soon enough, and even if they didn't, well. It wasn't like Mallen was being discreet. Tony's message basically consisted of a resume about what he'd seen – almost no readings, not with the way the armor had been battered – and his destination, that Tony had figured out thanks to the map Mallen had graciously circled in red – seriously, who did that? Was he worried he'd forget he was going to D.C.?
If he winked, knowing that the eyeslits were large enough to show it – and he really needed to work on that, or else one of these days someone would recognize him just because of that, he was really surprised no one close to him ever saw it, then again it probably had to do with the fact that those who'd look Tony Stark in the eyes tended not to linger on Iron Man's, and
The sound of a rifle shooting. A moment later – almost at the same moment – the burn of a bullet through his collarbone – right through, from his back to the front, and then out again – except...
It was the right move too, to take his stolen technology off the market. It didn't matter that nobody else saw it, because they weren't the ones whose powers were being used for evil – they didn't understand, anyway, because people with powers, or physical skills, were much more difficult to steal from than scientists or engineers like Tony Stark, who had no say about what their creations were used for afterwards. If Hank could get Ultron off the table forever and ever, Tony had no doubts that his friend would do what was necessary even if it broke a few laws.
And after that, he'd probably be accused of “explaining the world” to people he thought of as less than himself. Impossible to defend yourself when people didn't want to see anything else but condescension in your words.
The ghost got up from the seat he was not-occupying, an unpleasant sneer on his perfect face, and went to stand right before Steve's nose – Steve noticed the twitch the marshal gave, and guessed he'd instinctively straightened up in defiance.
The old fantasy of the helmet being thrown across the room, hurled at Captain America's feet, rose its ugly head, and Tony forced himself to stay still.
Which meant she was here to keep an eye on him – which, considering Hill was finally starting to get a bit better at not doing stupid things in regards to Cap, was not that terrible, though potentially problematic if he wanted to try and foment a discussion with the bullheaded asshole.
Steve's left hand was shaking – why was his left hand shaking? – so he gripped the hospital sheets harder, and didn't say a thing when Fury handed him a small device, saying it would allow them to communicate secretly before the trial and while Fury was wrestling SHIELD back into his own hands – something about the wishes of the dead, about how Stark had been the one to get Nick into that position to begin with, but Steve wasn't really listening at this point.
V'ra hadn't moved, herself, except for taking a step back, and now she was watching him as he stole a skrull's pants, one of his hands on one of their guns. She didn't look quite as assured as before, obviously, but she wasn't backing away. Wasn't attacking him either.
Turned out, Tony didn't die, arrived on the scene first, and didn't have to explain why Tony Stark had died right after Iron Man took a beating to anyone – though, obviously if that had happened he'd have been in no position to explain anything to anyone, except maybe to other dead people, but he didn't really believe in an afterlife, so.
“That's your first lesson, Mr. Stark. If anyone offers you a sucker punch, they've probably got a reason, so... don't fall for it.”
To be fair, Clint had given him – Iron Man-him, not Tony Stark-him – a look when, just after they'd all come back from Franklin's pocket universe, he'd gone and “rescued Mr. Stark” only to reappear two days later with the news that the concerned authorities had been given a temporary explanation and they would not be shot on sight for pretending to be the lost heroes of the battle against Onslaught – barely joking there, you never knew what people might shoot you for in this country.
Which. Obvious enough. It could have been about the Maria Stark Foundation, he supposed, but as it had never stopped founding the Avengers – okay, the New Avengers hadn't gotten money, for obvious reasons, but the Mighty Avengers had, and now that they were all back on the good side of the law it wasn't a concern anymore – there wasn't exactly a reason for him to be here.
“Assuming, of course, that said principle is benevolent and not divided in several sub-principles that would be the ones to contradict themselves, leaving the abstract first principle entirely devoid of sense but otherwise safe. Example: do not lie, and protect life at all cost. Someone tells you they want to murder one of your friends and ask you where they are. Do you lie, or do you protect your friend? Better, you've seen said friend beforehand, and swore to them that you'd protect them. Same situation again. Do you lie to the newcomer, or do you make your promise to your friend into a lie instead? Do you lie, or do you lie?”
What went unsaid was that one of these days, it could be that their intervention, and the subsequent coming of the Sentinels, would deal more damage than the initial situation. That one day, maybe, they'd end up being forced to let things be, because the SHRA would have effectively cut them out of the possibility to help. That only those who'd registered would still be able to intervene.
“The point was, V'ra, that your fault or not, you have to deal with the circumstances you are given. And sometimes, those are such that you must ask yourself which principle you'd rather fail in order to uphold the other. Not doing so is either naivety or hypocrisy. I make my choices, and I hope that they were the right ones, but at least if they weren't, I know that I tried, and I don't regret having chosen one principle over another, though I may regret what comes out of that choice, though I may admit that I was wrong in how I acted on it.”
