Sherlock turned back to the office, his face set in a firm look. He marched back into the small room, the other two boys gone. “Sir, with all due respect you are an idiot,” he said.
When John finished though he looked over at Sherlock with a smile. “What?” he asked, noticing him watching him. “Do I have something on my face?”
John nodded. “Okay,” he said. “Thank you Mr. Holmes. You are amazing.”
John spotted Sherlock and smiled a bit. He looked at Sarah. "I've got to go," he told her.
“See you tomorrow sir,” John said. He turned and went inside.
John laughed and stopped outside Sherlock’s door. He bit his lip and looked up at Sherlock for a moment. “Thank you Mr. Holmes,” he murmured. He opened the door and went back to his seat.
“And it showed,” Sherlock said. He stood up. “What’s your next class?”
He pulled him closer, wanting to feel him, wanting to feel everything that he was feeling in that moment.
John shook his head. “I’m sure they’ll remember a lot more than they do now,” he said. “Have faith in your students.”
John shook his head. “Well, you can leave,” he said. He wiped his nose and looked down the street. “I’m going to be leaving soon anyway.”
“Of course Mr. Watson, I can’t wait,” Sherlock grinned,
“You have plenty of fans,” Sherlock stated with a laugh. “I’ll try to make it. No promises.”
As he shut the door, he noticed a paper on the front step that he hadn’t noticed before. Slowly he bent down and snatched it from the stone.
“Okay, I’ll drive you home,” Sherlock said as quietly as John did. He backed away from the teen when the nurse came back into the room. “I should be getting back to my classes now. I’ll check on you in a bit. Can’t have my best student getting worse while I’m away.” He gave a nod to the two before leaving.
“Yes I do sir but I already said yes,” John said. “I’ll do something for you next week. Please just this once let me go.”
“Oh yes, you turning blue is really making me want to join you,” Sherlock said. “No, I’ll let you get it out of your system.”
John climbed out of the quickly and led him into the restaurant. He moved to the table that they sat at last time and settled into his seat. “I don’t either,” he said. “I enjoy our time together.”
"Wait," she said. "Before you go. Um....would you like to go out again sometime?" She bit her lip, tugging on her sleeve. "I think it will go a lot better this time."
Sherlock nodded, trying not to look disappointed. “Yes, great fun. We’ll do it again sometime. I promise.”
John nodded. “Of course,” he said. “I won’t hold you to anything.” He opened the passenger door and climbed in. He buckled up and settled down in the seat.
"Well, I was thinking that its such a nice day that we can go out and have ourselves a picnic," Sherlock said with a smile. "Pick up a few things from the shop and go to the park:"
Sherlock was pulled from his thoughts when John began to stir. He smiled and pressed a kiss to his broad shoulders. “You up?” he asked, his voice low and rough.
Sherlock pulled on his jacket and started to head outside. He walked to the field and leaned against the fence. He watched them practice for the last half hour and then waited for John to show up.
John smiled and slipped out of the car. “Thank you Mr. Holmes,” he said. “I know you are tired of hearing it but this is the last time. I swear.”
“No,” Sherlock said. “We’ll let it be a surprise for everyone else. Don’t worry.”
Sherlock let his eyes slide close, titling his head to the side. However, John didn't continue and he was a bit disappointed. "I suppose we can do that," he said as he stood up. He turned around, pulling John into a kiss. He ran his fingers through his hair, holding him there for a moment before pulling away. "Alright, go get dressed," he said softly. He slapped his arse before he went to go get his jacket. He smiled softly, pulling it on and checking his pockets.
“Please,” John said swimming closer. He stood up. “It may be bloody cold but it is still fun.”
His father had to ruin that.
John licked his lips and looked to Sherlock. “Fine,” he said. “If you want to do that Mr. Holmes, I’ll accept the ride, but this has to be the last one.”
Sherlock arrived at the school a bit later than normal, it wasn’t a good night and it wasn’t a good morning. He stopped by the office to tell them that he was there before heading to his class. He wasn’t looking forward to it.
Sherlock watched him go, letting out a low groan when he was finally left alone. He covered his face with his hands, trying to sort out his head.
Sherlock nodded. “I was doing it earlier, I can do it now,” he said. “Do you still need a ride today?”
He led John to a secluded area before setting everything down. "I'm sorry we don't have a blanket," he smiled. "Still never replaced it in my car.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. That raised his curiosity more than it should have. “I’m sure if it’s bothering you I would want to know.”
John nodded slowly. “I see,” he murmured.
Sherlock laughed softly as he watched the other run off. He went and grabbed them a few drinks that they both would enjoy. He found a few other things as well. He decided to go find John and stopped when he spotted him, but he wasn't alone. He saw Sarah standing with him and they were talking. Sherlock felt a knot of jealousy in his stomach and wondered if he should interrupt.
They drove to the restaurant and Sherlock helped John out. “I’m fine,” John assured him. “I can walk on my own now. I’m just a bit shaky.”
John shut his eyes and thought for a moment. Sherlock could see the inner turmoil working and knew that if he said yes it would be a reluctant yes. “Please,” John whispered. He couldn’t walk home in his condition even if he tried.
Sherlock nodded, smiling a bit. "We are," he said softly. "But we still have a lot to talk about. This is your life but I want to try to be apart of it."
Sherlock frowned a bit but didn’t want to show it. “Hey, I know how that is,” he said. He glanced out the window. “How far do you live?”
Sherlock waited until John was out of sight before leaving the airport. He headed home to a flat that hadn’t been empty in months.
“I am,” John said. He rubbed his eyes and leaned against the window.
Sherlock smiled. “I know I am,” he said. “Have a nice day Mr. Watson, see you after school.”
Something inside John fell and he had to put a hand to the wall to steady himself. Where was his father? Why would he leave without trying to contact John at all?
Sherlock looked at him. “Tired?”
John bit his lip and looked up at him. “Yes Mr. Holmes?” he asked.
Sherlock smiled down at her. "Yes, well it seems Saturday is a shopping day," he said. He put the divider between his and John's things.
"What about you John?" Sarah asked.
“Weren’t you supposed to do that last night?” Sherlock asked with an amused smile.
He packed everything back up and checked his phone to make sure no one texted him while he was at work. It was odd, no one ever texted him but he still checked.
John blushed a bit and looked down. “Thank you sir,” he said. “I did try my best this time.”
“It was my pleasure,” Sherlock said. He led him back to the car. “You should sleep well tonight, after a shower of course.”
John rolled his eyes. "No, someone else decided they were going to take my heart," he laughed softly. He looked over at him, smiling. He spotted Sarah again and she came to their line.
"Oh, I know exactly what we'll need for this," John told him with a smile, his hand feeling empty now. He hated having to hide. He shoved his hands in his pockets. It was a lot weirder to see them holding hands than it was just to be with him. He was okay with it. One more day and they would be fine. That's all they needed.
John raised an eyebrow and silently wondered what was wrong with his teacher but he didn’t let it get to him too much. He started to put his things away, still talking about his date with Sarah.
“I will,” John said, licking the cone. He leaned against the counter, watching him with a smirk. “You know my stomach is almost endless.”
“What’s on your mind?” Sherlock asked, glancing at the teen for a brief moment.
John rolled his eyes, nudging him. “It would not have been funny,” he laughed. He paused. “Maybe it would have been.”
Sherlock nodded. “You have the last three games to play,” he said. “You just have to serve detention with me and that shouldn’t be that hard.”
He looked around, trying to find a sign of someone living there but there was none. The place was abandoned it looked like.
Sherlock smiled over at him, shaking his head. He caught the other staring but said nothing. He wasn’t going to make this night awkward.
“You’re always starving,” Sherlock said with a small laugh. He grabbed his bag and put his things away. “School’s almost over you know. I don’t know what you’re going to do when you can’t spend all this time with me.”
He turned to run back out but John caught him around the waist and pulled him in further. “You’re in now,” he told him. “You just have to go under.”
John shook his head. “How did you know it was dishes?” he asked, leaning forward.
By the end of their detention the two of them were covered in paint sitting against the wall laughing. “I told you, you shouldn’t have put the can up on the ladder,” John laughed.
John frowned and looked down at his feet. “It didn’t go so well,” he admitted. They went out and had a great time at dinner. John walked her home even. However when she went to kiss him he backed away from her.
“Ice cream it is,” Sherlock smiled and started to drive towards the ice cream shop.
John smiled. “So, Sherlock, I think we can get some ice cream, yes?” he asked, feeling happier now that he was using the man’s first name. It felt nice. Like it was meant to be.
When he pulled back John was just staring down at him. He didn’t have to say it. Neither of them did. They both loved each other and knew that there was no going back.
“I don’t want to tell you,” John said, finally looking up at him. “Now, why are you here?”
John stopped at his desk again. “Sorry for not telling you about the paint in your hair earlier,” he said.
John quickly shook his head. “Nothing you want to know about,” he muttered. “Trust me.”
“For what, giving you hypothermia?” Sherlock asked.
They were having their last dinner together at the restaurant they had first gone to when they had started to hang out.
Sherlock glanced from his papers as he listened to the two boys. John had a date? Well good for him. His stomach twisted though as he kept listening to the conversation. He couldn’t pinpoint why he had that feeling but it wasn’t a good one to have.
He squeezed his hand to get his attention. “What’s wrong?” he asked when he looked up. It had to be more than just the jitters about going. There was something that Sherlock couldn’t quite pinpoint about the emotions going over John’s face.
Neither spoke until they were back at the flat. It wasn’t an awkward silence, but it was tense. Sherlock watched as John walked in and went straight for the bathroom. He sighed, shaking his head before heading to the door as it shut.
Sherlock nodded. “Come on, let me take you to the nurse,” he whispered. He wrapped an arm around his shoulders gently. “I’ll talk with the principle about this. I promise.”
John looked to his feet as they walked. He really didn’t want to tell him. “Nothing too bad,” he mumbled, wiping at the blood again.
Sherlock didn't take his eyes off John. Ah; the army. Of course. How could he not see? John looked ashamed, shrugging a bit. "Yeah, well it will be okay," he said softly. "If it happens it happens." He licked his lips. "I'm going to go outside and see if my ride is here. I'll see you two tomorrow."
Sherlock groaned and moved to lie down on his back. “Don’t say that. I really don’t want you to leave.”
“Do you need a ride home?” Sherlock asked. He bit his lip, wishing the words didn’t come out. He couldn’t drive students home. “I mean, it might get you home quicker.”
Sherlock glanced over at him. “I don’t know,” he said. He rubbed his eyes and sighed. “It was just…one of those days I guess.”
John was stripping down to his boxers as Sherlock leaned against the hood of the car. “Come on Mr. Holmes, it will be fun,” he told him. He folded his clothes and set them next to his teacher. “It’s just a quick swim.”
Mr. Jamison sighed. “He inflicted harm unto another student, in the rules it says those who fight get suspended and lose any special privileges.”
A smile grew on John’s face as he looked up. “I can play?” he asked.
“Yes sir,” John said with a nod. He looked down at his feet for a moment before looking back up at Sherlock. “Thank you sir, you helped a lot today.”
“Hello Mr. Watson,” Sherlock smiled. He noticed John’s nervousness but didn’t say anything about it. “Just have a seat and we’ll be out of here before you know it. I don’t have much more today and we can leave early.”
The slightly muddled look on John’s face made him chuckle slightly. ”You said yesterday that you had dishes to do, I remember because you complained about them most of the way home. You also mentioned that’s why you leave them for last.”
The next day John went to class earlier then before so he could finish up the reading. He found his regular seat up front and started to skim through the paragraphs. He was startled from his reading by the deep voice of his teacher. “Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said with a smile.
Sherlock wrapped his arm around his waist and started to flip through the channels looking for a movie. When he found one he tossed the remote off to the side and rested his head against the arm of the sofa. “Happy birthday,” he whispered, pressing a kiss to John’s cheek.
Sherlock didn’t like the feeling John gave him when he thought of him. So John would be pushed out of his thoughts unless it was during school hours.
“I fought back,” John said. “Sir, I was on the ground and they were kicking me, ask Mr. Holmes. I came in with a nearly broken nose and a few good bruises myself. I would never just randomly beat someone up.”
Thump, thump, thump.
Sherlock shook his head. “Your nose is bleeding, you have a black eye, and your lip is split open,” he told him, “it is bad.”
John rolled his eyes. “You seemed to be enjoying yourself today,” he hummed. “Did you see the looks I got when you announced I got the best grade?”
Sherlock stared after John after he pulled his arm away. John must have known what he wanted to do, what he had been thinking about for so long. He must have been mortified. He slowly moved to the car and got in. He pulled off the side and started towards John’s house.
John shook his head. “For giving me a good night,” he said. “I had fun.”
John grinned. “I’ll try to be more careful,” he said. He looked down at his feet before nodding. “Goodbye,” he mumbled, shutting the door. He quickly ran inside.
Sherlock laughed and nodded. “Of course I do,” he said. “Everyone doesn’t think that we know what goes on when we leave the room. No work gets done. That’s why I’m going to quiz everyone on it tomorrow.”
Sherlock stood next to John as they stood at the airport. John’s recruiter was going to meet them in just a few minutes to send John off.
For the remainder of class John tried to catch up on his reading. He didn’t have much time to do homework after school because of practice then his chores at home.  When the bell rang John jumped from his seat and headed for the door.
“It will be freezing,” Sherlock said, watching the boy shiver slightly already. “I can guess you already know this already though.”
Sherlock smiled and leaned back in his chair. He couldn’t get angry at the teen. He was just having a good time. His smile and laugh were great things to hear. He shook his head and shut his eyes. He shouldn’t be thinking that.
“I’ll walk with you,” Sherlock said. “I need to go to the office anyway.”
John laughed softly as Sarah told him about how her dog woke her up that morning. She caught him while he was looking over the chips and they had been talking ever since.
Sherlock sighed as he started driving. “I’m sorry,” he told him. He was truly sorry. He really didn’t want the boy to get in trouble at all, at home or at school. “I’ll help you with any homework tomorrow.”
“Will you promise me you’ll take it easy?” Sherlock asked.
“What?” Banks asked, turning to look at the teacher. His eyes landed on John. “Oh, god.” He turned and they made their way to the office.
John ducked his head down into his book, his eyes going over the pages quickly as he tried to take in the information before he saw Sherlock’s shiny shoes in front of him. He glanced up, trying to stop himself from laughing more.
Sherlock ran his hands through his hair, groaning as he felt the paint. “I forgot about that,” he mumbled. He wiped the paint on his pants before looking over at John. “I can give you a ride home if you want one from now on.”
John smiled and nodded once more. “See you tomorrow Mr. Holmes,” he said. He turned and ran from the room.
The next Wednesday John moved into the classroom, going to Sherlock’s desk. The past week had been great. John had stayed after to talk with Sherlock and rode home with him every day. He was spending more time with his teacher than his friends.
Sherlock closed his eyes. How could he forget that? “You can borrow some of my pants,” he told him and brought him to the bedroom. He found bottoms for him and handed them over. “Change into these.”
He didn't hear anything else from the man as he catcher up with John. "Are you okay?" He asked quietly.
Sherlock nodded. “I’m going to take a long shower after this,” he said. He tried not to focus on how John felt comfortable enough to pull something from his hair.
“I told you, I don’t need help. So please, keep your opinions to yourself,” John said, his voice rougher than it usually was. He hadn’t meant to sound so harsh, but it was already out there. He didn’t want to say anything else, so he just left it there.
John groaned and dropped his bag in an empty seat and walked to the door, trying to ignore the other’s as they stared. Sherlock went to the door and opened it for John. “What happened?” he asked once they were in the hall way.
“My birthday is tomorrow,” John told him, rocking on his heels.
John grinned and cheered quietly before packing his bag away and moving to the front desk. He watched the other students file out, a few giving him glares as they left.
“What did I say about thanking me?” Sherlock asked.
John shut the door and slowly went to the house. He watched his teacher drive off with a smile before going inside.
Sherlock stood up and gently rubbed his shoulder. “I’ll be back, John,” he said. “Go to your next class and I’ll talk with you at lunch.”
For now.
Sherlock kissed him back, humming softly. He pulled back when he saw the recruiter coming towards them. “I guess this is my goodbye,” he whispered.
John’s face fell a bit as he looked out at the house. He chewed the inside of his lip before undoing his seatbelt. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes.”
“The Chinese one? Of course I do,” Sherlock said. “Why?”
They made it to Sherlock’s in no time, Sherlock wouldn’t admit that he was speeding at all. Though John knew they were going faster than normal and he couldn’t blame the man. He was sure they were both waiting for a time like this.
Sherlock smiled, squeezing his hand. “No problem,” he said as they drove.
He stared at the familiar door, wondering if he could still just walk in. He knew he had said horrible things to his father the last time they spoke, but he just didn’t feel right going off without actually speaking with him.
Sherlock sighed softly, swallowing down his curiosity. “Yes, see you Monday,” he hummed. When the door was shut he let out a low groan and hit his head against the steering wheel.
"That means you got up", John also glanced at Sherlock’ watch "at four o’clock?"
“So?”
Sherlock grabbed the letter and put it under his laptop. “You are right. Old-fashioned.” His attention returned to whatever he was researching. Making clear that he wasn’t interested at all to go deeper.
Holmes looked at his friend with an amused smirk on his face. "Well, I had something completely different in mind."
Holmes saw tears running down Samuel's cheeks, who had become a murderer because of deep love and his inability to understand.
Sherlock turned around again with a seemingly guilty face, an egg in one hand, a spatula in the other and John had problems to stay serious because Sherlock looked so funny.
"He was a creep. Always wanted my best, ha? He couldn’t keep his dirty thick fingers away from me. That night he was drunk. He held me down and..." She started sobbing. "I managed to free myself and pushed him away. I only realised what happened as he flailed his arms. The balustrade is low..."
“The letter I gave to you yesterday. Scarlett… remember?”
“So you are the guard I couldn’t talk to before because you are on holiday.” Sherlock said, breathing heavily.
Seemingly without effort, Holmes turned back to business by stopping the coach. With a sigh Watson climbed inside behind him.
"Sherlock, please", Watson hissed and turned around again, where the cast and workers of the theatre stared at the body and them in turns now.
Poor Annabelle Christie. She really needed protection but didn’t get it. She will not even be able to prove it was self-defence, and has to hope the jury will be merciful and willing to believe her. That’s… " Holmes tilted his head and frowned, "sad?
"That’s the murder weapon. Hamlet murdered Polonius by accident."
“Remote-controlled toy cars.” Sherlock answered. “I saw them near the entrance.”
Before anybody could react, Samuel ran over to Annabelle Christie and held a knife at her throat. "Don’t... don’t come closer!"
A line of Sherlock bears hovered in front of him.
He turned back to Watson and took their coats and hats from the balustrade where Watson had placed them. "Come on, let’s go."
"Gentlemen…", Watson tried to step in and calm down the situation but was kept back by his friend.
Once more the consulting detective cast a satisfied glance at those assembled and then turned around to leave the scene. Watson followed him, mumbling, "Breakfast? He wants to eat? Now?"
Holmes glanced at his friend and smiled. ‘His’ doctor and his determined way to handle such situations, a relic of his time at the army... Watson was the only one he knew who was able to hold a candle to him, at least in this respect. One of the many reasons he appreciated him so much.
"Yes, that’s how Shakespeare wrote it", Watson responded, a bit annoyed.
“Hunting ghosts means that we are hunting ghosts. The management contacted me, speaking of inexplicable phenomena. That’s worth a look, isn’t it?”
"Holmes needs more time", he hissed to the inspector.
When Watson concluded his report and looked up again, he saw a smile on his friend’s face. He wasn’t sure what to make of it and gazed at him sceptically. "What?"
"Oh, for now I’ve seen everything I needed to see, my dear Watson. Lestrade will do well. At least he can’t do anything wrong. So what have you got?"
Ms Newton described Charles Thomas as especially devoted to younger women, and interested in more than Ms Christie’s acting skills, even to the point that rumours started among the cast. But she never mentioned Ms Christie soliciting or encouraging his advances. Old Thomas was a creep as Ms Christie just said, and his interest in Ms Christie indicated a greater desire than only being a mentor.
Only two persons seemed to be somehow separate. The actress playing Ophelia stood a bit aloof and seemed strangely emotionless. Only the deep breaths she took now and then showed that something worked inside her. The tall man who had arrived with the police still stood alone at the stairs leading from the stage. He kneaded his cap in his hands and mumbled to himself. Holmes noted a small, fresh cut running across his forehead.
"You don’t say!", Watson replied, shaking his head.
“Yes?”
He looked back at the young woman and her captor. Fear and anger were reflected in his face…. and, more tellingly, in hers as well.
“A few hours later. When exactly?”
"Well, it seems that I was wrong then", Holmes said while observing everyone intently.
Watson tried to defuse the situation. "You don’t have to worry, we know exactly what to do. Mr Holmes often works with the police. For a start, I would really appreciate it if you would introduce yourself. And your company, if you don’t mind."
"Yes", the player of Claudius answered. "Samuel, a stagehand, is on his way. But for heaven’s sake, who are you?"
The detective settled in his arm chair and put his fingertips together.
"Interesting. Who told you all that?"
Slowly Samuel stepped backwards, holding poor Ms Christie as a shield in front of him. Watson and Lestrade who stood sideways behind the stagehand started to move carefully towards him. But Holmes shook his head without looking at them. Watson understood and stopped Lestrade.
“Of course these phenomena are man-made. There are no ghosts. I already suspect someone; I just need proof. As for how - I suppose we will find some kind of technical device that is vibrating the shelves. It has to be very small. I didn’t… “Sherlock jerked to a stop and raised his hand.  “Shush! Do you hear that?”
Sherlock just raised an eyebrow. “You’re not serious… are you?” John repeated.
“Sometimes I really doubt that you have a heart.” John answered stony-faced.
"The blade of that knife is too short to reach the victim unless he stood really close to the tapestry. And why should he do that, when he had enough space to retreat? What do you think, Inspector? Seven feet perhaps, from the tapestry to the rear wall?" Holmes stepped in. "Ah, and you can leave by the side. On the right there’s a low passage."
John smiled. “I will get one of those Sherlock bears,” he whispered to himself, “to allay your disappointment, Sherlock, that there aren’t any ghosts.”
Holmes put his finger tips together in front of his face and addressed Francis Thomas. "Right, but if you didn’t put Samuel up to help you, what made him do it? Did you say anything to him?"
"Excellent. I want to hear more. It’s getting interesting", Holmes whispered.
His look went back to the body, turning the coat of the costume back from the wounds. "Well, these are two proper stabs. Didn’t you feel any resistance, Hamlet?"
Shortly before they left the stage, Holmes turned around once again to get a general idea of the situation. The actors and other theatre people were standing around, still shocked. Some were whispering to each other, now and then interrupted by Lestrade who questioned them.
“But Sherlock –“
“About bloody time! I suspect that the drug overdose from yesterday caused another seizure. His system is more susceptible to it because it is weakened by his long use of other drugs. We need to give him some intravenous fluids to dilute the drug. He needs to be intubated for there is a good chance that he will vomit. And somebody get me some naloxone!” John was in full doctor mode at that point. He starched his arm out to the nurse to receive an intubation tube but even after 3 seconds his hand was still empty. He looked up, annoyed and angry.
“So?”
“Strange that you don’t want to talk about it. I thought… after I split up with Mary… you would have more trust in me… that you and I were more than just friends…”
The actor wanted to reply something but Watson stopped him by turning his back on him. He went to the front of the stage and drew back the curtain a bit. Holmes joined him, the knife still in his hand.
"You were a good friend of old Thomas, a very good friend actually. What do you think about his incapable son and this chinless wonder Homrich ruining your friend’s lifework?
Holmes looked at the stagehand, Samuel, who stared back and hesitantly touched his forehead.
"Right." Watson opened his small notebook, using the glow of a gas lantern to read. "The victim’s name is Brighton Homrich. He did the acting just for fun, the same way he owned that theatre just for fun. He joined the cast after he bought the theatre. Actually he made his living with being a ship-owner, originally located in Portsmouth. The murderer whom you don’t believe to be the murderer..."
Rutherford cleared his throat. "Yes, I’m sorry to admit it, George, but in fact you aren’t a good actor at all. You don’t put much feeling into your performances. And you’re absolutely terrible at learning and remembering your lines. You will never get a lead."
“Sherlock, would you please put that damn egg away?”
"I didn’t tell you to kill anybody. I didn’t tell you that Homrich was guilty of father’s death!" Francis Thomas cried out defensively.
There was dead silence for a few seconds while Holmes’ words sunk in.
“I have to apologise. You definitely have a heart. A big one.”
Holmes turned to his friend and slightly shook his head, which meant, ‘also not him’.
While Lestrade tried to calm down Rutherford and the others, Watson took Holmes aside where the gas light barely reached them.
Holmes turned around and left the loge in a hurry.
Thomas frowned and looked at the stagehand. "I can’t remember saying anything to Samuel, that... Well, I was angry and disappointed when I had to sell the theatre. It could be that I said things..."
"So we have everyone from the cast but Ophelia. And what about the other people working in that place?"
"Don’t come near me. I will kill her!" Samuel shouted and looked manically around.
“Because of what I am going to do now. It will break.” John stood up, took Sherlock’s head in both hands and pressed a gentle long lasting kiss on Sherlock’s mouth.
"They can go. They aren’t required. The culprit is among the theatre people, Watson", Holmes interrupted him. "Oh, how I love this. Who would have thought that theatre could be so fascinating?"
“Who?” John hurried to follow him, leaving a trace of Paddington bears as he once again bumped into a shelf.
“Breakfast. YOU are making breakfast.” John pulled a chair from the kitchen table and sat down.
"Sherlock...", he started, but was interrupted by his amazing friend laying a hand on his cheek.
"Including me," John stated.
Samuel breathed heavily. His hand holding the knife at Ms Christie’s throat trembled.
Holmes turned to the theatre cast and workers again. "Shall we begin then?" he asked, walking slowly around, finally reaching the tapestry and skimming his fingers over it.
"And how surprised you were, unpleasantly surprised, on discovering who your new boss was, my dear George", Rutherford chipped in. "What had happened between you before you left his company? Perhaps something giving you a sufficient reason for a murder?"
As John reached his friend he already restrained someone on the floor. John joined Sherlock holding the man who surprisingly wore a security guard uniform.
John interrupted his friend.
Watson tapped his cock against Holmes’ tongue. Pre-ejaculate was gathering at the tip, its flavor intense on Holmes’ tongue. Holmes exhaled through his nose and moaned.
“Thank you for seeing me again.”
"...run you a hot bath and help you remove the plug. I have some petroleum jelly at home and would like to make sure you are thoroughly clean before applying it to ease where you are no doubt very tender. I insist we refrain from penetration for a time, on your part. Even after the tenderness resides. I worry somewhat that I put you through too much tonight." Watson really could be quite thorough when he put his mind to it.
"Please, Doctor." Holmes dramatically slid off the chair to his knees.
“How, how can I help you?”
Holmes waited until Watson had donned his jacket to point out the dildo still sitting on the desk.
At Holmes' nod, Watson thrust forward slowly. Holmes gagged. Watson pulled away slightly. Then in again, deep. Watson could feel his cock head touch the back of Holmes' throat. Holmes swallowed around him—oh Lord!
Watson opened his mouth to retort but Holmes interrupted him.
“Quite alright Doctor, but,” he confessed, “I feel the hunger more strongly now.”
Holmes wailed.
"Oh, of that I have no doubt."
Watson nodded and showed Holmes the other two items he had taken from the drawer.  He was blushing but he soldiered on.  Holmes raised his eyebrows.
Holmes' cock was hot, hard, and straining under the fabric of his trousers.
Holmes mumbled something to the affirmative.
"Don't pout, Watson. It's unbecoming. Let's return home. Will you share my bed tonight?"
“I must say, Mr. Holmes, you are a fine specimen, able to take all of this facsimile into you. I wonder if this is indicative of your issue.  Perhaps your body’s natural ability to hold so much causes a yearning to be penetrated? To be
Holmes lay his forehead on the table and arched his back.  Watson already had two thick fingers inside him—massaging, probing, and altogether driving him mad.
“I mean that if you do not insert your fingers, I will surely perish right here on your examination table.”
“Oh, my word.”
“I am afraid, Dr. Watson, that I have no idea what that is.” Holmes betrayed a small, wicked twitch of the lips.
“The best remaining option, then, is oral application.”
"Careful, Mr. Holmes. Keep your mouth closed. I'm close. In fact—here it—here it is—!"
"I'm going to slide my fingers into your mouth now. Please tap my elbow you feel discomfort."
“Well, that is certainly an option,” he continued. “However, based on my research I believe it is best if the ejaculate come into as little contact with the air as possible. I will have to ask you to place your mouth around my, ah, instrument, and receive the ejaculate directly into your mouth.”
"A cab. I desire to have you wrapped in my arms and in your bed as soon as possible."
"Then please, provide me my medicine. Treat the ache residing so deep inside me."
Holmes almost balked at that but he managed to keep a straight face.  Watson continued.
Watson motioned to the chair opposite his.  They sat in somewhat of an awkward silence for a moment.
“Yes, please. The need is burning through me.”
? It warrants further study…” Watson trailed off as he began slowly moving the shaft in and out, gently side to side and up and down, stretching Holmes’ rim in every direction.
“Well, it all feels quite normal, Mr. Holmes. But I can still see and feel how your muscles spasm around my fingers.  I would like to examine further if that is no trouble?” He twisted his fingers inside Holmes, who clenched his teeth.
“Doctor!?”
“That seems reasonable.” Holmes was fighting a light blush himself.
Holmes nodded.
“Ah!” Holmes gripped the sheet lining the table.
Holmes winked at him.
Holmes was on him in an instant, sucking Watson’s length into his mouth, gagging himself, slicking the way with saliva. Watson stilled his movements and pulled him off his cock.
“Good evening Dr. Watson.  Thank you for seeing me at such an unconventional time.”
“Ah, yes, fresh is indeed best. Very cleverly put. I have already taken the liberty of preparing a couple of items that may aid us should you desire to continue with the treatment tonight.  I admit this late there are no other men here to assist, and so I am your only option as a source of the ejaculate.  I assure you I am in perfect health and will be utterly professional in applying the treatment.”
Retuning to Holmes, Watson quickly but gently spread the soothing, healing salve in and around Holmes' tender entrance, and slipped in the plug.
Holmes used his own handkerchief to wipe the worst of the mess from Watson's face.
Watson straightened his waistcoat and smoothed his hair and mustache. His voice was low when he spoke next.
"Oh, please, Doctor. It is like before. I feel empty. I crave. My work is no distraction. I cannot concentrate. I cannot eat. I cannot sleep. My body aches." Holmes shuffled closer on his knees; eyes locked with Watson's.
"John, quickly. I need you. Forget the game."
Watson crawled to him.
“To clarify, that would entail what exactly?”
“Mr. Holmes, not at all!  You are not the first patient to make such a request in the name of privacy.  And goodness knows I stay here late most nights anyway.”
Watson dried his hands and turned to remove something from his desk drawer. It was wrapped loosely in two handkerchiefs, but Holmes recognized the suggestive shape immediately.
“Ah, yes, I thought you might say that.” He gave Holmes a fond look.  “Without going into too much scientific detail, it is a gland that is vital to maintaining a man’s essence.  I’d like to check for any obvious irregularities. Would you lean over the examination table there and lower your trousers?”
"Something like that."
"My body aches for your cure."
Holmes looked up at him, but Watson continued before he could say anything.
Watson thrust deep and felt from outside and in how Holmes' mouth and throat filled. Oh, how Holmes strained, how his throat bulged as it worked around his cock!
Holmes released a groan from his very bones.
"Oh, I can't take it!" He said and reached for his prick. Watson stopped him.
He heard Watson take the lubrication onto his fingers and saw the tube placed next to him on the table.
Watson couldn't help but smile.
Watson gazed back for a moment. Here was Holmes kneeling at his feet, Holmes’ mouth holding his cock, Holmes’ beloved head between his hands, Holmes' eyes trained on his, reading his thoughts.
Watson strove to find an angle to better stimulate Holmes' prostate with his thrusts. When Holmes' cries of pleasure turned into an aria, he knew he found it.
Holmes was back bending over the examination table, but now he was completely naked from the waist down.  Watson had removed his shoes, wanting to avoid injuring Holmes should he inadvertently step on him, but was otherwise fully clothed.
“To summarize, Doctor? Tell me the plan as plainly as possible, no euphemisms or vague language, please.”
“Ouch!” Watson startled and stood up straight.
“Yes, of course.”
“This is certainly one kind of discomfort.”
Watson’s fingers pressed against his hole. His mouth came close to Holmes’ ear for just a moment as he said, “Is the hunger that powerful now? Indeed, you were not exaggerating when you told me of your predicament.”
"That is
His gaze fell to the bulge in Watson's trousers. He licked his lips.
He smoothed down his mustache, gathering himself.
“I will first conduct an oral exam to determine if there are any health or hygiene issues that would decrease the effectiveness of the treatment. Next, I will use my fingers and then a facsimile of a penis to test your pharyngeal reflex. This is to ensure that I do not go any further into your mouth than you are comfortable with during your treatment. You must seal your lips around the penis before receiving the ejaculate—I will warn you when it is time. This is all to ensure ease in swallowing the ejaculate and prevent waste, should it leak from your mouth.”
“It will be necessary for you to take my member as deeply as possible, to ensure that none of the essence is wasted by accident. I must investigate how deeply you can take something into your mouth to prevent discomfort during the application of the treatment.”
Holmes placed a hand on Watson's leg and drew a small circle with his forefinger.
Watson hummed and caressed the lump beyond the inner lining.  Holmes broke out in a sweat.
Without waiting for acknowledgement, Watson slowly but unyieldingly inserted his whole forefinger.
“Thank you for your confidence, Mr. Holmes. I do agree. All that is left now is to discuss the treatment. Forgive me for being straightforward, but I believe I mentioned that I do not recommend another rectal application so soon. Would you be able to wait for another week, perhaps even a fortni—"
“Your prostate gland seems healthy.  However, your reaction to the introduction of my fingers, and your own description of the sensation you felt lead me to believe that your hormones are out of balance.”
Watson removed his fingers and stood up.
Holmes gripped the edge of the desk and wailed.
Watson came around to stand behind Holmes.
“First, I will use my fingers again to relax the muscles of your anus and rectum.  Then I will insert this phallus to dilate you further.  My own, ah, phallus, is a little bigger than this when erect, but I will do my best to prepare you thoroughly enough you should not feel any pain.”
Holmes took Watson’s wrist in both hands and, eyes tightly shut, held Watson’s hand still as he fellated his fingers. Watson staggered. The hand on Holmes’ head was now gripping his hair. Watson bent and dropped his head, his breath tickling the loose hair falling over Holmes’ temple. It was all Holmes’ mouth on his fingers—pulling off, sucking in, saliva dripping—his look of intense concentration—obscene!
"Oh, is that all." Watson sounded relieved.
Holmes spread his legs a little further and leaned down to rest his head and chest on the table.
Watson would give Holmes more.
“Hm.”
“Hmm…” Watson took a knee on the floor behind Holmes and used his free hand to pull away one side of Holmes’ buttocks and moved closer to watch his fingers glistening as he moved them in and out, twisting them in Holmes’ hole, feeling around the rim and just inside it. He blew a soft stream of air against the slick hole as he pressed again at Holmes’ prostate, harder this time—
Holmes cleared his throat.
Was up on his knees before him.
Watson was thrusting in earnest, a hand on Holmes' hip, the other still holding his arms. He could feel their testicles slapping together.
“Shall we get to it, then?"
“Ah,” Watson smoothed his mustache in an attempt calm his blush at the suggestion.
Watson drained his own cup as well.
Holmes' face was relaxed, and his eyes closed. His breath had slowed, but Watson knew him too well to be fooled—Holmes was controlling his breathing, trying hard to remain cool. He also knew that Holmes was most likely concentrating on the minute sensations—the heat and strength of his fingers, the roughness of his calluses, the relative smoothness of his fingertips.
Watson was watching him, an intense look in his eyes.
With a growl, Watson grabbed Holmes’ haunches and like a piston, fucked him at that exact angle as hard as he dared.
He smiled at Holmes and patted it.
"That tickles."
Watson interrupted Holmes speech by grinding the dildo into him.
"Good evening, Dr. Watson."
"Tell me." Watson's voice was low.
Holmes drank and took his time moistening his dry mouth. After drinking it all, and unable to resist Watson's burning look, he set down his cup.
“I will give it to you.”
"Have a drink," he said, and poured a cup from the teapot on the desk. "It's an herbal blend. I'm afraid it's cooled by now, but it should still be refreshing."
“I see.”
“I don’t know.  Let us observe your reactions and decide from there.”
"Mr. Holmes," he was breathless, but he was motivated to maintain what was left of this role play.
“Now, now, Mr. Holmes, bear with me for a moment. After reading some recent publications on the topic, I have concluded that, perhaps, the source of your complaint is hormonal.”
“Indeed. However, having given it some thought myself, I have concluded that you were on the right track, Doctor. It must be merely that the intensity of my predicament is such that a second dose is necessary.”
“Well then? What is your hypothesis doctor?  What have you deduced?”
"Shall we proceed with the treatment, or was
“Not at all. Once I start treating a patient, I like to see it through to completion, until unquestionably satisfied. It is a shame the success of the first treatment was only temporary.”
“I am. How exactly will this be done? Shall I drink it from a cup, or—?”
Holmes moaned hotly.
Mr. Holmes had returned for a second dose.
“Of course, excuse me.” Watson returned to his chair and continued.
"What was it? The play?"
“Unprof—! Dr. Watson, please, this is like throwing a life preserver to a drowning man but it landing three feet short!”
“I see you have been consulting your books in preparation for my visit.”
"Now then, Mr. Holmes. Please tilt your head back and open your mouth."
"Oh, my dear boy," Holmes whispered, and helped Watson to his feet.
“I think I will need to insert a second finger.  I can clearly see your anus fluttering, and the strength of its grip on my finger is quite something.  Yes, I think a second finger is needed.” Watson removed his hand and took up the ointment once again.  “Let me know if you feel any discomfort, please.”
The consulting detective grinned at his friend. “Still afraid of Santa Claus?” Then he headed for the next aisle past shelves and tables full of everything that children love.
"We have to trust Holmes, Inspector. I do", the doctor replied with a piercing look.
"Yes, indeed. I remember the credit we got for our production of
"So what exactly am I doing here? " Holmes’ look went around the little theatre and down to the stage around 20 feet beneath their loge while he took off his coat and placed it together with his top hat on the small table between their seats. Small gas lamps put the loges, the auditorium and the curtain of the small stage in diffused light. Everywhere one could hear whispering among the audience waiting for the play to start.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?”
“Um… that… yes.”
Only one of the stagehands, Samuel, the one who was sent for the police, is different. He is hardworking, too, but needs more support and advice because he is mentally retarded. Old Thomas picked him up from the street when he was a child, begging in front of the theatre. Ms Newton mentioned that she finds him a bit scary, because he behaves very strangely sometimes. Let’s see… How did she describe him? ‘A poor soul which, if he hadn’t been found by old Thomas, would certainly have died. ` Samuel loved old Thomas like a son his father and was devastated after the accident."
Watson turned a page in his notebook. "Ophelia is Annabelle Christie. Astonishingly Ms Newton didn’t know that much about her. She joined the company about a year ago and is a talented actress. But in real life she seems to be an unremarkable and very shy person. She is certainly in her early twenties and her past is unknown. Charles Thomas was absolutely enthusiastic about her, an ardent worshipper. Rumours had started among the cast. That old Thomas could be interested in more than her acting skills. He was a widower for a decade already and especially devoted to younger women. Off the stage Annabelle Christie had no contact to the other cast members whatsoever, which increased the tittle-tattle."
Watson faced the actor. "I am Dr John Watson and this is Sherlock Holmes. He’s the right man to be here now, be assured."
John’s memory went back to the House Mistress of the boarding school where the children of the U.S. ambassador had been kidnapped some years ago. He wondered which poor woman had had to breathe into a bag this time.
“For how long?”
"Doctor, surely—"
Watson looked at him. Holmes was feigning nonchalance but the blush on his cheeks had darkened. Watson neatly re-folded his shirtsleeves to the elbow.
“There’s no need,” Watson repeated, hand stroking over Holmes’ hair and ear, coming to rest at the back of his head.
Watson started moving his finger in and out, and Holmes’ gave a true gasp.  He was clenching around Watson’s finger uncontrollably.
Holmes shivered.
Holmes took a deep breath as he felt a delicate, slick probe at his entrance.  Watson moved his fingertip slowly in circles around the rim before inserting just the tip.  Holmes gave a small gasp.
Watson licked his lips, then blindly laved at Holmes cock head, cleaning the last dribbles of this seed.
Holmes smiled. "Oh John, I’m unbelievably hungry. You... in my dressing gown this morning... I'm sure you know what I want for breakfast." And he bent over to close his doctor’s mouth with his lips.
"Sherlock, please, not now. Did you discover anything new? I thought you had seen everything?"
Gertrude shook her head. "He’s dead", she said and tried to fight her tears. Watson leaned over the body and took the pulse at the man’s throat.
Holmes’ words made everyone gasp.
“Sherlock, did you read the letter?”
"How now? A rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!" On stage, Hamlet rushed enraged to the tapestry where Polonius was hiding and stabbed him twice.
“As I mentioned before, it’s not important.”
"I mean you wanted to punish the murderer of Charles Thomas. And now you are holding a knife right to her throat."
As it turned out, Watson couldn’t really enjoy the play. Holmes was permanently commenting on the – in his eyes – illogical story. Watson’s reply that it was really useless to criticise a nearly three hundred years old work of Shakespeare in that way couldn’t stop the consulting detective, either. People from other loges already threw angry looks at them. That wasn’t only distracting but also rather embarrassing.
Thomas shrugged.
, wasn’t it sold out for weeks? But also comedy…
"He really killed him", Holmes stated immediately, straightening himself up in his seat.
She dropped on her knees and wept inconsolably. Holmes nodded to Lestrade who took the opportunity to throw the stunned young man to the floor and handcuff him.
“Alright then. She is my sister.”
Temple was offended. "What about you? You had a splendid career, hadn’t you? Why aren’t you part of the cast in one of the fashionable theatres instead of languishing at our small amateur theatre then? Too many glasses of wine before every performance?"
And, you know what? Now I feel like having breakfast. I hope you told the coach to wait."
Temple looked around as if searching for support, but in vain, and then hesitantly answered. "Being an actor always was my passion. I wanted to concentrate on acting completely."
But Holmes rose. "No, Watson, I mean he actually stabbed the actor behind the tapestry. Can’t you see?"
"Unbelievable!" Watson stated after joining his friend. "How could you know all that?"
“At the toys department of Harrods?” John grabbed Sherlock’s shoulder to stop him and turn him around. “You’re not serious.”
John immediately folded his newspaper. “Yes… if you want to tell me.”
"You murdered the wrong one, you know?" The consulting detective went on, still circling with slow steps around the tall man and his hostage. "Homrich didn’t kill Charles Thomas. You made a mistake. But you are going to correct it as I notice."
"Always read between the lines, my dear Watson, and observe, of course. The implications were clear in everything Ms Newton told you.
." Ms Newton agreed. "And Francis,
The man just nodded guiltily, went to the remote controlled toys and started stopping them.
One of the toy cars crossed their way and drove against a table leg which stopped it with spinning wheels.
“What’s that?” John whispered.
Sherlock shortly turned around to John, smiling, and then continued his work as house husband.
“Sherlock, what happened? Why are you doing this? It’s the first time in all those years.”
Lestrade frowned at that but upon Watson’s look remained quiet. Together they watched as Holmes started walking, but not towards the confused man. Instead he circled around him, keeping a measured distance.
“Who is Scarlett? “ John entered the flat with a letter in his hand, given to him by Mrs. Hudson for Sherlock when he returned from work.
The addressed turned to John and looked at his fob watch. "For three hours and 4 minutes already to be precise, my dear John. Hope you slept well?"
"Like... that if my father hadn’t died before, this sale would certainly have killed him. And Homrich would have been his murderer. Silly things one says when one gets emotional."
Suddenly, the theatre people’s mumbling became louder again. A man in a brown suit, well-known to Holmes and Watson, and obviously in charge of the three accompanying police officers entered the stage. They were followed by a young, very tall man, 6.5 at least, who wore dirty work clothes and preferred to stay a bit behind.
"Ah, Mr Temple, it’s very kind of you to volunteer to be first. You used to work in the victim’s company as a book keeper? Why did you leave?"
"Correct it in terms of judging the real murderer now."
“What do you mean we will investigate that? I just solved the case and found the culprit. We will…”
Poor Samuel, too... he just wanted to revenge the death of a man he loved like a father, but he made the wrong decision and will pay for it with his life.
“Strange. Only the first name, no address of sender. That implies a certain… intimacy? Or one of those “ladies” who offer “special” services. But usually that doesn’t happen via old-fashioned letters.” Amused, John waved the envelope in front of Sherlock’s face.
"Alden Rutherford, Claudius, was an old friend of Charles Thomas and really grieved for him. He didn’t like Homrich at all. Actually no one did. George Temple, Horatio, used to work for Homrich as a bookkeeper in Portsmouth until he suddenly decided to follow his passion for acting. It had been a really unpleasant surprise for him, according to Ms Newton, to discover that Homrich became his boss again. And Homrich in return also seemed very startled to see him. Ms Newton told me there was always tension between them. She once overheard a quarrel between the two men. Didn’t understand much but thought that money was the reason."
"What... what do you mean?" Samuel stammered.
But Sherlock didn’t respond to that. Instead he went to John and ran his hand over his friend’s shoulder.
Watson grinned. "You don’t really believe him, Inspector, do you?"
“Inexplicable phenomena.”
The police officer who accompanied Lestrade went to Annabelle Christie and pulled her up. She didn’t resist.
“It wasn’t that bad, really. In fact she seemed… touched that I came to her. She said things like “I’m so glad” and “Finally you face up your feelings”. Sounds… good, doesn’t it? Well, I wasn’t aware that being frank could be… um… hurtful. I am really sorry, John. You know my brain is full of useful things but being tactful isn’t part of it. But it is fact that Mary… Anyway I want to apologise, I must apologise. In fact I couldn’t sleep after I… you left… Oh, Mycroft would burst of laughter if he could see me now. Mrs Hudson had tears in her eyes when she said I should be honest to you… just once. What I’m trying to say… when you didn’t live in Baker Street anymore and married Mary… inside me something… hurts… my non existing heart, you know… never had that before…”
“So no one banging into it.” John said with a snort.
"Holmes... says he’s wrong?" Lestrade whispered in utter disbelief.
The consulting detective simply ignored the man, went to the body, knelt down and started to scrutinize it with a magnifying glass he pulled out of his jacket pocket.
Sherlock turned around. “She is, well, the black sheep of the family.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s arm and pulled him closer.
"Did someone send for the police?" Watson asked no one in particular.
As they sat in the coach on their way home Watson couldn’t help asking again. "You’re serious? You just caught a murderer and revealed the true circumstances of Charles Thomas’ death, and now you want to have breakfast?"
‘Hamlet’ was still stunned. "My... my name is Francis... Francis Thomas. I... thought it was the tapestry. It’s really thick, you know? Usually Brighton stands far enough from it that the knife can’t reach him. I don’t understand..."
Holmes slightly shook his head, as if he couldn’t believe himself what he was about to say now.
He left the little chamber again. "So the question is: Why did the victim stand that close to the tapestry?"
"Sorry, what?" The inspector seemed slightly annoyed.
"Ah, John, people standing in your way, always interrupting… my brilliant mind needs silence for its work. I inspected our loge, after all the place of old Thomas’ accident, and then the whole stage once again. I also investigated the passage next to the small chamber behind the tapestry. I was curious where it was leading. When I went through I found myself in a storeroom full of props. And there is another door, leading straight out into the street. So…this is how it happened: someone came through that passage to the chamber, held Homrich so he couldn’t avoid the knife and escaped the same way."
“You have a sister? Why did you never tell me? That Mycroft didn’t is no surprise, but even your parents never mentioned her.”
Sherlock turned off the television. “I shouldn’t waste my time watching these poorly researched documentaries. Do you remember the one about mummies? That was even worse. I don’t understand how halfway educated people… What is it?”
Holmes grabbed a clean handkerchief which a nearby standing woman had just wanted to use and took the knife carefully by its hilt. He didn’t take notice of the woman’s outraged expression and examined the knife by turning it.
Holmes looked at his friend with a smile.
“Just you wait Rosy… I will be a good man. I will be a man you will be proud to call your father.”
Once they had settled down on the lab chairs with each of them having their own cup of cheep coffee John started explaining what had been going on with Sherlock.
“Not now, I’m busy!” he hissed and waved his hand at her as to make her disappear. He wanted to take Rosie in his arms and rock her till she calmed down, but how the hell was he supposed to do that with one arm? If she moved too much she could just slip out of his hold and fall to the ground.
“I’s ok Mrs Holmes I will go. There is no place for me here anyway.” He said and turned towards the door. He was about to open the door when Sherlock snapped at his mother again when she was trying to help him sit up. John was thinking about saying something to him, to tell him not to bark at his mother like that but then again who was he to tell him that? The best thing he could do right now was to leave them and give them the time and space that they needed.
He kept his gaze on them for a little while before he went back to the couch and laid down on, deciding to take a little nap himself.
“But what if he just closes of more?” her voice was faint this time, filled with general concern. A thousand and one thing could go wrong. If she chose the wrong word or if she asked something she shouldn’t have …  it could cause Sherlock to close of completely.
“Yes hello this is Mr Smith. You know your boss?”
Suddenly there was a sound of glass shattering and Sherlock just jumped out of his chair and pushed himself into the corner of the room. He pulled his knees to his chest and covered his head with his hand. He needed to make himself small, he needed to make himself as small as possibly -  if you are small then there is not much surface where they could hurt you.
The little girl huffed at him displeased and began to frown.
“Ow shit … I forgot that I have patients today,” John slid his hand down his face and checked the time on his watch. 8:28 am … Damn it, he was so late! And it was so hard to get that job too.
John cursed under his breath as he realized how ignorant he had been of Sherlocks problems - again. The desire to die was not something that would just go away. It stays with you, sneaks in to your mind when you are most vulnerable, when you are already on the ground and feel like you can’t breathe … And once it’s there it never leaves. John knows that. He knows that just too well.
“John there is no “we”. Let’s be honest you wouldn’t even be here if Mycroft wasn’t paying you. You don’t know me. Don’t know what I have done to come back to you. And what for? For you to hate me? I should have stayed in Siberia. I should have stayed dead.”
“Dr Watson about time, I was writing you the whole day. What-“
God, now that felt like it happened a hundred years ago.
“I said no. We can … ugh … what about if we dissolve the clot over a longer time period? That way the dead cells are slowly released in to my body giving my immune system enough time to defend me?” He twisted his body again as the pain grew stronger and stronger. John was staring at the detective slightly impressed that he managed to come up with that.
“Where is --- Where is Rosie?” The question was so silent that John almost missed it. The doctor cleared his throat and said:
“John I never meant to let her die. It was supposed to be me! It was always supposed to be me –“ he cried out loud not caring if the other man would find him now. Nothing matter to him anymore. His vison was all blurry from the pain and the tears that filled his eyes. His throat felt sore and was slowly closing up. He felt as if he couldn’t breathe.
“Your phone. It made the text alert. Was it Mycroft again?”
“Listen Mycroft, I know we are not close or anything, but if I can somehow help you –“
He could hear the door opening, and in his panic he tried to muffle his sobs and wipe away his tears. John stepped in to the room with this look still fixed on the phone in his hand. “They are on their way here. I told them that they can stay at my house if they have nowhere else to go. I tried to reassure them that he will pull thru, to calm them but truth be told the situation is far from ideal. Did you get any update on Sherlock? Did a nurse …” He cut his monologue short as his eyes lied a look on Mycroft. Johns face softened and his arms fall to his side. His look was fixed on the Holmes brother who held his head low in a desperate attempted to hide his red eyes and running nose. John moved his weight from one leg to the other in his nerves manner as he did not know how to react. Is he supposed to hug Mycroft or just tell him that everything will be alright? No he can't do that, Mycroft is all too aware how serious this situation is. Another hand on the shoulder to show him that he is there for him, but at the same time not intrude? But before he could make up his mind about it Mycroft found his voice again.
“Mister Homes will be fine. His heart is beating again and he is able to breathe by himself. He is unconscious at the moment. He needs rest, and not an ex-doctor pocking around him.” Her words were harsh but they were telling the truth. In his current state he could not help Sherlock. He needed to calm down, collect his mind. He nodded at the sister and she left the room. John sat in the room for some time, thinking over what had just happened. Sherlock’s heat stopped. Was it because of all the drugs that he took? Or was it because of Johns beating? How the hell did it come to this? John couldn’t help but to think of what Sherlock said as the security people pulled him off of him.
"You are the only human being able to allure me. I love you, John", he answered softly.
“You don’t believe in ghosts.” John said and followed Sherlock, who had turned and gone on again.  When the consulting detective suddenly stopped in front of a shelf John nearly bumped into him. “A teddy bear with a deerstalker? Named after me? Seriously, do children play with… that?” Sherlock asked amused.
John swore silently, picked up his own torch and pointed it at something in front of him. A plastic figure nearly 6 feet tall with a white beard and red clothes appeared in the torchlight. “I had a crash with that guy. Didn’t see him because ‘of course’ we have to roam around in the dark.” John mumbled angrily.
As the man in the suit caught sight of Holmes and Watson one could read an ‘Oh, no’ on his lips. He gave a few instructions to his men and headed directly towards the consulting detective. "Holmes, what are YOU doing here?"
John shortly thought about picking up the robots and putting them back but then followed Sherlock. As he caught up he asked, “Sherlock, what the hell are we doing here?” “Hunting ghosts.” Sherlock replied, pointing his torch at soft toys and baby dolls while passing them.
Holmes pointed at the inspector. "Exactly, my dear inspector. I’ll leave the ‘How’ to you."
“Her boss is a silly boy,” the guard hissed, giving up his resistance. “Do you know why Lindsey was really fired? Because she stood up to him when he molested her. And Lindsey wasn’t his first victim.  He thinks of himself as irresistible. No woman working for him was safe. But if they refused to do as he wanted he made their life hell. First he accused Lindsey of not working properly, breaking toys and things like that, and then he told colleagues lies about her. And at the end he told the directors that he suspected her of stealing money. Yes, Lindsey is suffering from it. And she hasn’t been able to get a new job so far, because he spread bad rumours about her in retail circles. But hey, I’m sure I can join her now in being unemployed.” His last sentence sounded sarcastic.
"Interesting. A proper blade was used", he muttered.
“We will investigate your story.” John stated and received a confused look from Sherlock.
Play H for Murder
“We will?” the consulting detective asked.
The egg burst on the floor.
"Oh my god, Samuel…" Francis Thomas repeated in a low voice.
Now Francis Thomas rose to speak. "Amateur theatre? The Marylebone Theatre is a house with a long tradition. My grandfather founded it nearly a hundred years ago. We have had the most excellent plays on this stage with superb reviews."
“I had a chat with Mrs Hudson about what happened yesterday. And she said I should…”
Sherlock watched a documentary about forensic medicine on TV. “I’m not an expert on that. But I’m sure the cut they suggested to open the skull is nonsense. Have to talk to Molly about it someday.”
As regards the death of Mr Homrich, there aren’t any logical suspects other than Samuel. Rutherford is a big sedate dog with bark but no bite. George Temple, he is just a snatcher, not particularly cunning, either, and Francis Thomas only a desperate young man who tried to rescue his heritage, which gave him every motive to keep Homrich alive. Everybody else had neither motive nor opportunity. By the way, your Ms Newton was the only one I never considered as culprit. Obviously, she wasn’t guilty of anything apart from her addiction to gossip. Same with the theatre crew apart from Samuel. None of them would bite the hand that feeds them. These are difficult times and it is so challenging to make a living….
And he became aware that his friend actually didn’t know the play at all. Apparently a mere play was something that was too trivial to find a place in Holmes’ extraordinary mind, even a classical piece of art like Shakespeare’s "Hamlet". Watson gradually started to regret the visit to the theatre. He was glad when Holmes’ comments finally died away and the consulting detective got nearly interested as the scene with Hamlet, Gertrude and the hiding Polonius started.
“Am I allowed to know anything about it?”
John shrugged his shoulders and went into the kitchen.
"Yes. Needed to look closely at the crime scene once more."
