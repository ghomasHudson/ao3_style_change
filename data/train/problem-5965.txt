“You are attracted to me,” Tony hissed. “And it is
When he knelt next to the symbiote, it stilled and its white eyes focused on Steve.
Eddie snorted and said, “Fine, but no grumbling about what I throw at you.”
“Tony!” Steve hissed.
“Up for a quick romp in the woods?” Tony said, nodding to the heavily condensed forest behind them.
Jarvis wasn’t kidding about the chest pains. It felt like Steve had pulled him into one of his tight hugs and forgot to check his strength and just wouldn’t let go. He rolled onto his back, gasping from the effort, and wildly searched for Steve. He was still on the bridge and struggling with the Winter Soldier but was noticeably distracted as he kept looking in Tony’s direction.
Peter mumbled something and shifted his arm on Wade’s waist. Wade smiled down at Peter and ran his fingers through his hair, loving the soft feel and how it bounced back up after every passing. Peter was slowly waking up with Wade. His mouth twitched into a small smile and his eyes moved beneath his lids.
Steve shook his head and gritted his teeth, unable to tell his son any differently.
“This is so boring,” Tony moaned.
Tony flew him level with Mary’s floor and Steve swung from his hold and crashed through the glass. He rolled into the landing and stood in the hallway he and Tony had twice crossed to get to Mary’s lab.
When the bullets stopped Steve cautiously peeked out from behind his shield and darkly wondered what sort of villain stalked his grave, waiting to kill him again.
He woke slowly, enjoying his dream as it gently fragmented into nothing.
In his sleepy state, it hadn’t occurred to him that Dum Dum might be a little shocked to see his one time leader back from the dead on Entertainment Tonight as the hosts gossiped about Tony’s mysterious new lover.
Howard leapt from his kneeling position and countered, “And you’ll learn all your genius from those of us from this era, you little whipper-snapper! Don’t worry. I’ll take care of everything! In the meantime, you get some rest like Dr. Jones ordered. I’ll be back in time to wake you for dinner!”
Tony licked his lips and leaned into his touch as he countered, “Make me.”
Steve picked Peter up, wrapping him in his quilt, and Peter continued to hold onto the slender gift from Clint. Steve said, “Then we are going to your labs right now!”
It was all so unfair.
Yes, Steve was captured and turned and Hydra lived on to the 21st century.
Wade laughed and asked, “So are you
He wanted to love.
“It is good to see you, Sir.”
“We need to jump,” Steve gasped. “Now!”
“Shut up, we’re older than you,” Tony replied. “Hell, Steve is older than all of us. Minus Thor, but Thor has the pure heart of a child.”
August 20
Steve raced to his son but as he did his eyes were drawn to the television where a circular hole was cratered the middle of the screen with minute fractures spreading out from it in a halo. His gut hallowed upon seeing it.
Jarvis stated over the loudspeakers in the tower, “The Jarvis uplink at the Malibu house has been disconnected, Master Rogers. I cannot tell you how much longer the structure will hold but I am still connected to the Mark 42. The armor is heavily damaged but Sir currently has only minor injuries so far. However, his blood pressure is at a dangerously high level as is his respiratory rate.”
Steve turned off the burner and divided the scrambled eggs onto two plates. He avoided Tony’s observation and answered his second question, “I hope we are going to be productive today. You have a deadline on that reactor, don’t you?”
Everyone turned to the forgotten Winter Soldier. Barnes was standing right where they left him but he now wore a resolute expression.
Clint was the most shocked and refused to believe him at first. He thought Tony had put Steve up to it. Only after Steve insisted repeatedly, did Clint finally believe him. After that he flipped but it was not from anger, it was surprise. Clint became giddy with the knowledge and asked if he could be there when he eventually told Coulson.
“Oh my God,” Tony gasped. He’d never seen Steve so injured or so pale. He was unconscious and Tony desperately whispered to him, “Steve? Steve, baby, wake up.”
He was a little apprehensive about seeing Steve so soon after their breakup…could it be categorized as a breakup? It certainly felt like one to Tony but they were never officially together. Would he call it a split? A meandering of ways? The end of cock on cock action? The possibilities were endless…and it just depressed him to think about.
Pepper rolled her eyes and said, “We have bigger problems than Fury.”
“I miss you too,” Tony whispered back after a long pause. “But I do not…” Tony sighed heavily and murmured, “We need to have this discussion face-to-face. I am not going to have a heart-to-heart with you over the phone…mostly because I am not going to factor out the make-up sex and because it’s better to do this in person. But I also want make-up sex…and a ton of it.”
“Good morning,” Steve murmured, kissing Tony lightly on the forehead.
The room was circular with machines that circled the room in layers. It kinda reminded him of NASA’s setup where they had rows of terminals, each with its own setup, designed to complete a specific task. NASA had their setup done in classroom lines, with all of their stations, facing one direction. But this room was set up in a Socratic circle, with all of the terminals facing a giant structure in the middle. So naturally, Tony went to the center.
“Captain-?”
Howard looked at the device in his hand like it had just signed his own death warrant.
Tony turned back to the lawyers and explained to the group of people before them, “I’m Steve’s dirty little secret.”
Snow was falling gently but steadily and settled on the robot. It tilted its head to the side and some of the flakes slid off. It murmured, “Hello, brother.”
Tony, gasped, “I didn’t notice you weren’t aging because you are always wearing different clothes and, dammit, maybe I was willfully blind to it!” Tony grasped Steve’s hands tightly and held onto him like he was his lifeline. Steve tightened his grip on Tony, relaying the shared sentiment. Tony nearly sobbed, “I don’t want to grow older than you!”
He regarded Tony with a small smile and studied his face. Tony always had a way to make him feel better. He was so grateful to have him in his life.
"Yeah and he's gotten it into his head that he's five years older and should be allowed to fight with the Avengers on a full time basis," Steve said, rolling his eyes.
The prosecutor nodded and turned back to the detective and started questioning him again.
Steve was also obsessed with Tony’s workshop ever since he first took him there so they spent most of their time there as Steve educated himself. Steve especially loved his bots and Dummy was smitten with the super soldier. Tony initially took him to the workshop to show off his bots but Steve could not get enough of the place. He had questions about everything and he absorbed the information like a sponge.
Jarvis inclined its head and murmured, “Yes, he was one of the last people we saw before we departed to France and were lost to the past.”
But mostly he missed that safe feeling he had found in Steve’s arms…
Coulson wouldn’t have considered it a year ago but…since he met Thor, it seemed like anything was possible. He shook his head at the silly thought. Cap had the serum running through his veins. It had amazing healing factors and maybe, just maybe it was what saved him.
He typed out the message and the team tersely waited. Clint was clutching at the air and starting to hyperventilate.
“Yes, I did,” Steve whispered hoarsely. His leg was tense at first but he quickly relaxed under Tony’s touch. He moved his leg closer to Tony and Tony’s foot moved with him. He began to caress his inner thigh, his foot coming within centimeters of his crotch. Heat began to pool in his groin and Steve bit back a moan.
“He will be with you momentarily, Sir,” Jarvis replied and Tony bounced on the balls of his feet with impatience.
His eyes rolled back into his head and he promptly fell back as he fainted.
!” Pepper steeped into the room and her face paled as her eyes focused on them. She spun around, facing away from them, and hissed, “Tony! He just got back!! You couldn’t wait five minutes!?”
The second and final indicator is more for the mates to confirm that they are indeed mates. They merely need to touch and the implant will beep in confirmation what the mates will most likely already know, they have found their soulmates.
Tony did not notice him at first. He was bent over a piece of his Iron Man suit. Steve could not see his hands, they were buried in the machinery, and sparks were flying up from what he was working on.
“…No, I need to find a way to protect Spidey’s identity,” Peter sighed, pulling himself out of Steve’s arms.
Breathing more shallowly, Steve stepped into the nearest building, a corner grocer, and asked the man behind the counter, “Wha-What year is it?”
He’d seen Tony last night. It had ended with them sharing a late-night walk and Steve pressing Tony into a tree and kissing him so deeply the other man moaned into his mouth. As soon as he woke, he began to miss him…but now here he was in Steve’s arms,
It was like he was stuck in the worst part in a horror movie except the horror just
Century without your guidance. And you and your smile gives me hope for a future…a future I could never have with Bucky.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Again, the impact caused his chest to contract in pain and his entire body seized.
Steve instantly swooped over to him and knelt by his side. He imagined Tony’s plush bed and it thankfully appeared beneath him. The rest of Tony’s room materialized, blocking out the prior darkness.
Beyond the barricades, were reporters but everyday citizens were there as well. One side held supporters, holding signs proclaiming their backing, and on the other side was a gathering of protestors against him. It was the latter group Steve’s eyes focused on. They were already worked into a frenzy and chanting for his conviction. They held signs calling for him to abdicate his shield and saying he was going to hell.
“That’s up to Tony,” Steve stated, interrupting Tony’s babbling. Tony’s face grew lax with shock and Steve reassessed what he said and added, “That is…if you want to?”
“So breakfast should be fun,” Wade joked cheerfully, pressing his chest into Peter’s back and wrapping his arms around his front.
“Sir?”
Alright, Stark was clearly the one who made the first move. No surprise there.
Out of the two of them, Tony was the first to venture outside. He claimed to not be afraid and said he had several very important meetings he needed to go to. More importantly, he needed to show his face to show people he was still alive. Rumors were starting to spread that the usually charismatic billionaire had developed a deadly disease.
The media was not all bad. When patrolling the internet, Tony was glad to see the photos originally taken of Tony and Steve during Steve’s panic attack were lost in the hundreds more that were born from their outings and from the ones they posted personally. In all of these new pictures, they looked happy and so in love and Tony adored it.
Tony dropped the clothes and gasped, “You've got to be kidding me!?”
“Got any Vaseline?” Steve gasped into Tony’s mouth, rubbing suggestively at Tony’s backside.
happily.
Steve placed him in the bed then paced around the apartment, trying to get rid of his excess energy. He could not sleep. He was too wired from his encounter with Tony.
“I can be in the Avengers?!” Peter gasped excitedly, all his sullen emotions about Hydra were immediately dashed.
Grinning widely as joy surged through him and filled with boundless energy, Tony excitedly gasped, “Let’s pick a present!”
…For now.
His window to act would be small and he needed to be there when Stane made his move.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest with an angry huff and speared his glare into the ground. Hurt and sadness churned within Steve and he had the awful feeling of wanting to throttle Tony or push him against the wall and hold him.
He looked from his computer screen to his phone.
[Magic] one voice stated. [Sex with baby boy is the absolute epitome of pure magic.]
“What? You want alone time with him? And when he starts kissing you, then what? You’ll let him because it makes him feel better?”
Bucky smiled gratefully at him with his small, sad smile and whispered, “Thank you, Steve.”
Yet as soon as he found himself in view of the swinging doors he found himself stopped.
Peter was his everything so Wade was there too.
“The coffee here sucks, I have been threatened with arrest three and a half times, and the internet connection is so bad it’s like living in the Dark Ages! But who cares about me! Are you alright?? No one would tell me
It was as useless as Steve’s ability to help…
When Tony first started at elementary school, Howard was approached by SHIELD again.
With wide eyes, Peggy looked down at Tony and her eyes seemed to grow larger as she made connections with this new information. Steve gently picked Tony back up and her gaze followed them as he stood up. Steve implored, “Peggy?”
For a moment, he contemplated what it would be like to fall those hundreds of stories. With his serum, would he survive? Was he still mortal? Could he die like anyone else…like Tony? Steve shook his head to rid himself of such thoughts. He would not do it and even if he really wanted to he could not do that to Peter. Even though he was a horrible father, he was still his father and Peter loved him.
Tony crept up beside Steve and whispered, “He’s still here??”
“Whoops,” Tony chuckled beneath him. Steve looked down at Tony in surprise. He was expecting annoyance from people prying into their private lives. Steve himself was a little apprehensive about the reaction from the press.
was the one who was going to try and save Bucky and Steve…
Tony wanted to hold him and hear his voice but, instead, he closed his eyes and remembered the warmth of his arms and the tender tone of his voice. He thought back to all the cherished memories he shared with Steve and they were able to calm him down.
It was a whine akin to a scared dog.
“My fiddling must have done something to it,” Tony murmured. His gaze flickered away and he added, “I…I just wanted to help out and
With Steve’s fingers clutching tightly at the bedsheets and no longer teasing his body, Tony moved down to give Steve’s lower half with his complete attention. He kept one hand on his cock and then stuck a lube-soaked finger into his hole. Steve back arched up and Tony patiently waited for him to stop cursing as the warming spread into his sensitive insides.
Steve woke to the feel of fingers lightly playing with the ends of his hair.
On one of those night, Tony asked him about sex and Steve, somewhat mortified to be talking about it, told Tony all he knew, which wasn’t much. Oral sex was the furthest he’d ever gone with a girl and she’d been the one doing all the work…He basically was still a virgin, which he haltingly revealed to Tony.
“That’s right,” his dad agreed, sitting on Peter’s other side. “You’re not alone in this. We’re going to be with you every step of the way.
This was the longest the two of them had gone from making love since they started and they were long past due.
Tony rubbed his arms and whispered, “I’ll be behind you the entire time.”
Tony smiled sadly at his father and gave his forearms a gentle squeeze as he whispered, “You’ll find a solution.”
“I’ll leave you two to your reunion but, I’ll leave you with this too.”
As soon as the suit landed, they surrounded him.
It was there he crossed his arms over his chest, closed his eyes, and began to do what he did best: think.
. He’s alive!”
Tony had installed a reactor into the suit as soon as he was healthy enough to do so but, he hadn’t touched it since. Too many painful memories accompanied the suit.
Tony’s heart compressed painfully, and he wondered if he was going too fast or if it was all too much for the Winter Soldier. Bucky looked like Tony had just gutted him.
“Ugh, don’t get me started. Have you looked outside? Half of New York is dressed like Cap right now.”
They lingered on the kiss so it was the fourth one as well.
“Don’t leave me!” Steve half begged, half sobbed. They couldn’t end like this. It was too cruel.
And yes there is going to be a Part 3 to the series, which will be all about Steve, Bucky, and Tony!
had one.
“I’m surprised he didn't throw much of a fit,” Tony murmured.
They dressed between stolen kisses and went downstairs to check in with their friends.
“Which is why I chose to be here,” Fury said and threw a packet of papers on Tony’s lap.
Tony’s eyes pinched in sorrow and he needed a moment to collect himself. Steve held him and patiently waited. Tony pressed himself closer into Steve’s embrace and buried his face into the crook of Steve’s neck. His fever burned hotly into Steve’s flesh and Steve drew the blanket off of both of them, hoping to cool him down.
“Yeah,
Tony put his hand over Steve’s and ironically gasped, “Timing.”
Tony ran his hands through his hair, sighing heavily again, and turned to Steve. Steve looked ashamed but, when their eyes met, Tony saw that there was a smolder there purely for Tony.
Peter sighed to himself and then turned to his boyfriend. Wade was still in his cocoon. Practically all of the blankets on the bed were wrapped around him. Peter asked with a smile, “How am I supposed to cuddle with you with all of that in the way?”
Venom screeched. Wade screamed. Vision gritted his teeth.
“…Can we go back to my birthday?” Peter asked sullenly and he frowned at his unopened gift.
“Yes, Sir.”
Steve’s favorite throw was laying across the corner of the bed and Tony ran his hand over the soft fabric. Memories arose from the feel of the fabric and he recalled many nights cuddling under the blanket with Steve. Tony sat up, running his hand over the fabric and looked to the side.
“How long have you been waiting to call me that?”
Peter flushed deeply and turned on Wade, gasping, “
“Steve?!” Tony gasped and ran to his side. He grabbed his arm tightly.
Tony had been his lover.
“It is strange,” Howard stated.
Peter snorted and leaned into Wade as he said, “Pops, you remember Wade? And Wade, well, you also remember Steve but you clearly would like to get to know his apron more…”
“We’re
to keep y'all informed!
“If you told me this story last year I would have thought you were pulling my leg but with Hydra, that thing in New Mexico, and, well, I just looked up a picture of you on my phone and there’s no denying it…You’re Captain America.” The priest said it with a revered tone.
“T-Tony,” he tried to warn but he could not get out any more words. His entire body shuddered as he was tipped over the edge and he came into Tony's mouth with relieved groan. Tony swallowed eagerly then released his cock with a loud pop.
“It would be very subtle,” Steve scoffed. “The others would not miss our absence at all.”
“All of this will be nothing if he ends up dead,” he countered.
see her. Wade is probably the only person living to know what she looked like.
Steve nodded him forward and Bruce ran to the door.
Soooo...ya'll are awesome! Thank you for the enthusiastic responses!
Peter jerked around, half expecting the symbiote to be standing behind him. Peter was alone and the symbiote was still on his person…Peter was just hearing its voice like it was right there…not behind him but…but maybe…Peter gulped…in his head?
“I can do even better reactions,” Wade gasped excitedly, leaning in for another kiss.
There was a short hiatus of silence, in which, everyone but Bucky was staring at Natasha.
Then he heard his son scream within the lab.
Tony’s head snapped over to the voice and his eyes focused on Steve. His heart dropped as his mind connected the dots.
“Yes,” Tony whispered with great disbelief at his own statement.
nothing! It–.”
“Wh-wha-?” He gasped in a disbelieving tone.
“He’d be so embarrassed by this,” Bucky chuckled. “Hell, that plaque over there could be considered a novel and it mostly says what a good soldier he is…he was…” Bucky paused, all good nature leaving his expression, and then he hissed, “He was so much more than a good soldier.”
Glancing Peter’s automated suit and then pointedly to Tony’s, Steve ironically replied to his fiance, “I think he’ll take after you in other respects too…”
But Tony...Tony was alone in this timeline and he was presented an impossible puzzle. His friends would have wanted him to turn from it but Tony was invested.
Steve and Tony exchanged fond smiles. They never admitted it aloud but they loved to tell their story.
“You promised to be nice to each other today!” Peter stated, tears forming in his eyes. Harry stood behind him and was shooting glares at everyone involved in the fight.
?? What were they thinking?!”
Peter was wide awake after that remembrance and leapt to his feet and searched for the monster.
Tony covered his eyes with a shuddering breath.
Saturday!” Tony gasped with horror. “The 20
After a while however, Wade started giving him this look and he knew they needed to return to his bedroom pronto or risk having his parents find them in a compromising position.
He opened his eyes to the plain white ceiling of his bedroom. He sat up and took in the usual clutter of his room. He reached to his side, feeling for Wade, but his hand met nothing. Peter looked to the spot in surprise. Hadn’t he fallen asleep with Wade?
Once Tony’s breathing regulated somewhat, Steve murmured, “Don’t forget to eat your food.”
And then all Steve Rogers knew from that point on was nothing.
Tony tossed Peter the ring case and his son caught it. He looked at what he caught and his eyes widened. He quickly opened it and gasped, “Woah…How are you going to do it?”
The strange plea stalled the archer but not the others.
“We’re going to go ahead, Steve,” Bruce murmured and Steve nodded. Bruce, the rest of the Avengers, and Pepper went down the hall to where his hearing would be held. Tony wordlessly stayed by his side and they walked over to the lawyers.
“No, we both run around the capital,” Steve replied, speaking for the first time since he introduced Tony and Sam to each other. He placed his water on the counter and continued to smirk at Sam.
Tony turned around and started to rub the soap into Steve’s skin. He circled the mesh ball down his torso until he reached his cock and he conveniently dropped it and smirked, “Oops.”
“The hospital has had an intercom system for the last thirty years and Jarvis easily hacked it. Venom –
Steve smirked and murmured, “Alright, I’ll be right back.”
As soon as the judge stood, bringing an end to the session, Steve shot to his feet and spun around to embrace Tony. He could feel tears prickling at the edges of his eyes and he smashed his eyes shut to hide his strong emotional reaction.
With no food, Venom fed off Peter instead, draining him of energy. He had lost all his body fat and looked like he had not eaten in weeks. Hell, he felt like he had not eaten in weeks.
“Your very presence is changing the future,” Howard argued. “What’s the problem with changing it a little more?”
Tony’s eyes flickered open and he lightly moaned, “Steve?”
“…Chapter Three?” Peter asked, confused.
Steve blushed and stared at the top of Peter’s head. Thanks to his healing factor, his body was relatively unaffected with the exception of his hair being a mess. Tony, on the other hand, not only had messy hair but also his lips were red and swollen, he had a bruise beginning to form on his waist where Steve gripped him too tightly, and the telltale bulge in his loose jeans had not gone down yet. Steve self-consciously adjusted his stance. His cock was still half hard and he hoped it was not as noticeable. The archer easily read the telltale signs and gasped, “
“Ever since then Deadpool has been seen around the Tower and helping the Avengers a lot. Additionally, he’s all but stopped his work as a mercenary and those rumors say it is because of you. That, whenever you two are seen at a function together, you’re very
"Captain America is needed and I have agents who are willing to step up and take to mantle if need be," Coulson stated.
“Of course you would latch on that,” Steve said with a roll of his eyes.
He wanted to go to sleep, holding Tony close. As it was, he was not going to be leaving him alone for the next week at least.
to stop it. Especially for Steve…
Death tilted her head to the side and her skull grinned at him in its forever smile as she said, “Hello again, Wade.”
Clint moved into action without a second thought. Bucky stared at Natasha the entire time Clint searched his person. Bucky’s face was as blank and unreadable as Natasha’s. Steve held his hand, unable to do more for him. He was glad Bucky was remembering more but he feared what he would remember with Natasha. It could not be good, especially if he was training her to kill.
American camp? Could he be wrong about operations in the arctic? Were the Allies doing covert operations without the knowledge of the Army? Could it be the Navy? Or was he correct in his prior assumptions, was this another piece of Hydra?
Eventually, Norman stepped back from the project and let the Hydra scientists have their fun but he always kept an eye on the boy and his progress. The boy was his greatest creation and, one day, he might be of use to Norman. But at his young age and the years it would take him to mature, Norman had no patience to babysit. He had enough to deal with, with Harry, especially after his wife died.
That was Peter's voice. That was Peter.
Dennis got to work and Peter looked back to Wade and found the man smiling at him. He leaned toward Peter and said, “So my baby boy isn’t a baby after all.”
Steve started talking, letting the words flow from his mouth with no abandon. He gasped, “I truthfully do not know how I feel about Bucky. I fell for him when we were teenagers and I repressed my feelings for years. I may still be repressing them.” Tony tensed in his hold and Steve spun him around and grasped his face, he hissed, “But I do know how I feel about you, Anthony Edward Stark. You make me feel like I can be true to myself. You make me feel like I can fly! When I think of us, I think of a future. And w-when I think of you I get all hot and bothered…” His last comment drew a smile from Tony like he had hoped. He blushed from the audacity of his confession and whispered, “I’m sorry I was an idiot. Please, forgive me.”
Steve nodded stiffly and stepped back to let the medical personnel do their jobs. It took all of Steve’s willpower not to muscle his way back in and hold onto Tony.
Harry was born a few months later but Norman did not find as much excitement in his birth. Harry was remarkably average. Normally sized and screamed like a banshee whenever he wanted something.
Both Steve and Tony pulled him into their arms simultaneously and knocked the air out of his chest. He instantly felt warm in his parents' embrace. They worriedly looked him over and Peter did the same of him.
Steve sleepily blinked open his eyes and smiled softly when he noticed Tony’s attempt at sitting up.
Wade sat up straighter and he gasped, “Wh-What?! Is that thing stuck on him??”
“Looks like the base is ours,” Bucky informed Steve as he strolled up to him with his helmet tucked under his arm. “But we’ve got boys already reporting in that Schmidt got away.”
Steve would love to go outside. Being cooped up in that tiny apartment with an unsocial Cable for days on end with only the laptop was driving him insane. He could go running again and drink in the rays of the sun and live a little instead of counting down the days.
Peter scurried out of an alley, one hand clutching the front of his shirt tightly, and gasped, “I’m here! Let’s go!”
Steve smiled and tightened his hold on Tony for just a moment before pulling back and letting him go. Steve replied, “Everything is alright. I have an alibi and am not under arrest.”
Playing along, like nothing was wrong, Tony leaned back with a smirk and replied, “Onward, Banner.”
“…I love him, Pep,” Tony stated truthfully. “I’d never hurt him…”
“I-I-,” Steve gasped.
He threw back his head and laughed as he injected himself with something. His body expanded, ripping his clothes until only shreds remained and the very same Goblin Steve had seen on the field weeks ago was now standing there. The monster activated the time glove and, in a swirl of golden light, he was gone.
“D-Don’t make noises like that, baby boy,” Wade gasped, kissing the side of his face as he spoke. “I’m barely sane as it is and your mouth alone has taken me to the edge. You start making noises like that and I’ll go totally crazy.”
“Yeah,” Tony whispered, his eyes unable to look away from the face. His heart was aching again as he remembered Steve’s easy smiles and how his eyes warmed as soon as they met Tony’s. Out of all the photos he’d pulled out of the archives…none of them could capture the way Steve used to look at him.
Steve took in a deep, shuddering breath and he replied, “B-Bucky…Mostly I’ve been dreaming about Bucky’s death.”
Tony was the exact opposite and he was dying.
His weak legs slowly collapsed beneath him and he sunk to his knees, his eyes never leaving the portal…but Tony never appeared.
Mary looked down at her lap and said, “I’ve been here. I locked myself away in Osborn’s tower…Richard, he told you we were in SHIELD?”
Anything.
“I could have just seen him and be assured he was okay!” Steve growled.
Since the Bifrost’s repair, his prince was busily helping bring order to the nine realms.  Many worlds were in peril after being cut off from Asgard for so long. Heimdall always kept an eye on Thor but his gaze was all-seeing and he could see the events on Midgard. He’d always watched Midgard, even before Thor had been banished to its lands.
“Well, I beat you to it,” Peter replied smartly. Wade was extremely tempted to add in how close they were to beating each other off too but declined to add that in favor of keeping his balls. They were very nice balls and he liked them exactly where they were thank you very much. Though Stark looked like he was seconds from ripping said balls off as it was…
The Mark III would need to withstand high atmosphere flying to prevent it from icing again. Tony tested out a few metals on a digital simulation, but his mind kept wandering back to how the man said his name and how it strangely sounded had been filled such yearning…
“What are the mission’s parameters?”
As his brain became deprived of oxygen, he found himself unable to focus and his thinking became hazy.
Peter looked up to his aunt then back to Steve and nodded. May wordlessly transferred Peter to Steve’s arms.
It wasn’t enough time.
“The rest of the team can handle the base,” Steve retorted sharply. “Tony…we don’t know what will happen to the
“Growing up, I had one of your old recruitment posters in my room,” Tony explained. “And it did not encourage me to join the army but it did encourage me to jerk off.”
“Was a man with a silver arm seen attacking him?” She pushed.
a bad idea and if Steve wasn’t emotionally destroyed from almost losing Tony, he may have pulled back.
Harry sat up and proclaimed, “No one can defeat the mighty Thor!”
“Fury,” Tony said evenly. “This is a private party to which you and your goonies were not invited.”
Till next time, time travelers!
Bucky was not one of them.
They broke apart with happy smiles and Steve cupped his new husband’s jaw. Tony mouthed the words “love you” to him and Steve loved him so much in that moment that he had to bend down and kiss him again.
“Especially with my sudden reappearance,” Steve added and finishing off the last of his sandwich. Tony got another cup of coffee and looked at Natasha with raised eyebrows.
Bucky blinked open his eyes with a small smile on his lips that smile disappeared as his eyes focused on Steve. He sat up and looked around them then his shoulders slumped.
“It’s not every day my baby boy is a damsel in distress,” Wade retorted smartly.
“Steve—,” Bucky began with a disapproving tone.
“…You were looking at Stark, weren’t you? I heard over the scanner that he stopped that hostage situation. He’s with Stark, isn’t he?”
Tony returned his sudden kiss and they spent the next few moments letting the kiss overrule everything. Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s scalp and pressed his mouth so tightly to Steve’s that it felt like he was trying to steal his breath. Steve cherished every second and every shared breath.
“You start training with me this Monday, kid,” Natasha stated. Peter gushed over the prospect excitedly and Steve fearfully wondered what kind of training the former assassin had for his son.
Tony rolled his eyes and whispered to Peter, “And your dad is a stickler.”
“…What year is it?” Steve asked incredulously. How far in the future were they?
“Damn it,” Tony growled. He stated, “I got nothing on my end too.
Tony chuckled upon his curse and whispered, “If you insist.”
For a moment, Steve was tempted to ask if the robot had “known” him too. He pushed the reckless idea aside. He didn't want to change the future but, also, he did not want to have the timer ticking down in his head for his own death.
“All I ask is that you let me shadow you guys and have the opportunity to snatch up the Tesseract and use it to get back home.”
They scrambled to separate and both stared at each other with equal measures of bewilderment.
“After yesterday, they’d have to be crazy as Tyler to do any different!”
Hundreds of miles from where Steve Rogers was learning about the new century he found himself in, Tony was learning about a whole new world.
“After the Chitauri attack…after I went through the vortex,” Tony stated. “When I woke, and you were above me, all I could think was ‘I died and am in heaven’ and when I realized I was alive my next thought was ‘I hoped he kissed me.’ It was with those thoughts I knew…I knew my childhood crush was something more than a crush…”
“Tony
Tony reached over him to the bedside table. He opened the top drawer and withdrew a bottle.
“Don't kill him, Tony!” Steve gasped, pushing the Solider back. Steve could hear the whine of his repulsors, he knew Tony had them at full blast and they could be fatal. Steve gasped, “I've got this! I don't want to hurt him!” To the Soldier, Steve gasped, “I'm here for you, Buck!”
When the elevator opened, the alpha exit for the team members who could fly was already open for him. He jumped into a sprint and leapt from the building, hooting with excitement.
“You’re awake,” Tony whispered with relief. He held him tightly and gasped, “I don’t think I will ever be able to sleep again!”
He was torn from wanting to be with his soulmate to wanting to protect him from anymore agony.
Bile collected in the back of Tony’s throat as he took in the other man. He was tall, well-built, and young. All the things Tony was not. Jealousy instantly flared like a great boiling mass in his gut. Who was this person to Steve??
“If we want this to work, we need to come out before the DNA results. If we do it after then a good number of people will think it’s a ploy…Are you okay to do another make out session sometime in the next couple of days?”
Tony sat up, dragging Steve with him. Steve groaned but the weight of sleep was starting to release its pressure. He was waking up.
I love you most of all.” Steve poked the tip of Peter’s nose upon his last statement and Peter scrunched it with a cocky grin similar to the one Tony wore and the warmth in his chest grew.
Steve managed to get the coffee cup out of Tony’s hands and a glass of water in its place before Mary reached the lab.
“Shut up!” Eddie hissed, elbowing him in the side. “Don't jinx us!”
The tub quickly filled behind him, aided by multiple jets. Tony filled it enough so the water would only reach Steve’s waist. Steve could only have sponge baths until his burns were completely healed but the worst burns were on the top half of his body so his lower half could be submerged.
Tony jumped away from the worktable, clutching his mouth and weaving with no direction to escape. He felt like he was going to be sick. Whatever excitement he might have felt over Steve being alive was washed away with the horror that the Red Skull was doing to him.
“You are an awesome friend,” Tony whispered. With a voice he fought hard to keep steady but failed miserably at, Tony whispered, “I-I think I need some alone time with him.”
“Yeah and your face is ugly,” Peter retorted instantly. He felt shocked by the words. Before Venom they had come to him so easily…he didn’t know he could still do it…
“Outside??” Tony squawked, nearly dropping his piece.
was thinking.
“Shut up,” Peter replied affectionately and lightly elbowed Wade.
Shock speared itself through Tony and he stared blankly at Steve.
Wade turned around to see Peter’s father fall to his knee. He was clearly struggling to breathe by the way he was gasping. Wade lurched to get up and help him but Vision was by Tony’s side in seconds. He helped support him and stated, “The Captain says you are to be escorted to the closest hospital, no exceptions.”
“Go, Dad!” Peter retorted. “Back up at least and lose all hostile stances!”
Tony's brow rose in surprise and he replied, “No! Why would you say that?!”
Ignoring the mercenaries and the Red Skull, Tony dove back to his soulmate’s side.
Tony sat beside him on the tiny couch, his leg pressing into Steve’s thigh, and he lightly rubbed circles into Steve’s back. He wanted it too but he easily accepted they could not tell it. It did not bother him to the extent it was bothering Steve. Perhaps it was because he was used to always using a different face with the media. Steve never before lied to them. He was always open and honest and having to lie, especially about their relationship, must have been taxing. Tony whispered, “Just a little longer, baby…”
Natasha leaned into the hallway and fired again. She leapt back in when the return fire was almost immediate.
Coulson removed his phone from his pocket and pulled off his thick glove in order to properly dial Fury.
,” Peter said to Steve, “I’ll try it out.”
There was one way for him to get some questions answered...
Steve glanced up and saw Tony was no longer playing with him. He wore a serious expression, glossed over with a pinch of nervousness. Tony had changed his ways with Pepper. He dropped his playboy attitude and gave his heart to her. Their break up had been bad and drove Tony close to the brink. He had once confessed to Steve if the Avengers had not formed Tony might not have survived.
I'm thinking I'll be able to post the next chapter by next weekend! Thanks for reading! :)
“Go away,” Tony gasped painfully.
“You know,” Natasha commented dryly. “The female body has a number of sensitive zones and you are currently not focusing on any one of them.”
blade was in his fingers and he was lazily deciding where to throw it while his subconscious handled more serious matters: Peter.
Just a reminder, all my chapter titles are and will be quotes from the Back to the Future Trilogy. So yes, I meant to put DENSITY, not destiny...It would make sense if you saw the movies XD
“Bucky,” Steve answered the phone.
“We can stick to the truth,” Tony stated. “Just fudge up the timelines. Steve was frozen and he woke up. We met and fell in love. We don’t have to tell them the circumstances and they won’t expect us to. We’re celebrities after all.”
Tony felt frustrated. SHIELD was being tight-lipped about Brock so Tony could not really reassure his son he was completely safe.
“Well, J, how do I look?”
“…You might not want to see,” James stated without turning, he kept his eyes on Natasha, though she pretended she did not notice.
“Peter,” Bruce quietly cajoled. “Peter, look, there’s ice cream!”
“Thinking,” Tony agreed. He paused and picked up Steve’s left hand. He carded his fingers through Steve’s fingers and whispered, “I love you, Steve. I was thinking about how I have never loved someone as much as I love you. I was thinking about us, Peter, the Tower, our safety, our lives...
Tony twitched and gasped, “You’re not serious.”
Next Time, Ch. 13: Sticks and Stones may Break my Bones but the Look in Your Eyes will Forever Haunt me
He blacked out before he could ask anything.
Wade looked at his time traveling watch and said, “Perfect, we’re right on time!”
He wasn’t going to sleep any time soon.
Natasha’s eyes widened and she paused in whatever she was doing. Staring at him intently, she slowly repeated, “Stepan.”
“This isn’t much,” Brock murmured uneasily.
Steve weakly grasped the side of his face and murmured, “Let me look at you.”
Steve paused. He didn’t know Tony liked coffee.
Steve laughed and lowered his head to huskily whisper in Tony’s ear, “That sounds even
“They’re Hydra,” Tony stated, interrupting him before he got into a speech about secret inteligence.
Tony gasped, “This just…it just feels too fantastical to be real.”
They cleared away the last of the blankets and Peter pulled Wade into his embrace. They fell onto the bed together, hooking their legs and shifting their arms underneath their bodies so they wouldn’t fall asleep immediately. Peter inhaled deeply, drinking in Wade’s scent again, and then letting it go with a content sigh.
There’d been
The entire intersection was hooked up with speakers, ready to play the shrill sound at a moment’s notice. The plan was to turn it on as soon as Venom was close enough. Steve knew he could not get the symbiote into the cage. It was smart enough to know it could contain it but he planned to grab Peter as soon as the shrill alarm went off. Then, after he gave the signal, the alarm would be turned off for a few seconds and the symbiote rebound back to them. Steve planned to drop and let it fly past him and into the cage.
“Get out, Harry, I’m busy,” Norman growled.
“You’re being uncharacteristically quiet, Deadpool,” Stark murmured.
He practically threw the tickets at the poor teen and the kid pulled all three bears off the shelves for them. Tony greedily grabbed the Iron Man one first and looked at the tag on its ear. He crooned, “It’s called Iron Bear! Steve…My life is fulfilled. I am Teddy Bear merchandise now.”
“Just like you handled all those scars on your torso?” Howard asked, cocking his eyebrow in question at where his shrapnel scars were hidden under his shirt. Tony paused on the top button and dropped his hands as he met his father’s overly inquisitive gaze. Howard quickly pressed, “If you tell me how they occur I can make sure it’ll never happ –.”
Steve paused as he realized what had passed between them. He met Tony’s eyes and seriously stated, “I mean it. I never loved anyone the way I love you.”
Tony was the face of the Avengers. He was the one the media went to with questions or scandals. Steve would probably be dragged into it through their tie of marriage…
Tony tightened his hold on him and promised, “You are not going to lose me, whatever happens, I will be there for you.”
Steve put the soap back in the caddy then turned back around and grabbed Tony’s arm. He pulled it up and he roughly scrubbed his arm, leaving behind suds on his skin.
He placed his hand on the door handle and raised his gun. She raised her batons and charged the electrical impulse to max.
He toed the paperwork aside and the entire page was exposed, revealing…
Howard’s eyes widened with understanding and then he whispered, “That explains the scars then…” Howard’s eyes focused on the light in Tony’s chest and whispered, “Ingenious…”
One more chapter to go for Part 2!
He sat on a bench and unloaded his heart, telling her how he didn't mean to treat her that way and how much he loved her. He never really told his aunt how he truly felt but he felt the need to do it now. He never got the chance with his parents nor Uncle Ben. Aunt May was the most important person in his life and he wanted her to know that, knowing neither of them would know what tomorrow may bring.
“Wait!” Steve gasped, “Wait! Tony! I-I know this is horrible, but I don't – I can't leave you alone! You're my soulmate! I swore I would be there for you as long as I exist in your dreams! Don't push me away!”
Neither of them needed to vocalize that this indeed could be the end.
The gunshot made Tony jerk so violently that anyone watching would have guessed he was the one that was shot. But it hadn’t been him. He scrambled up as the Red Skull straightened up and returned his gun to his hostler.
Why would he assume that? Steve was dead! Even if they had eventually fallen in love, it wouldn't have been fair to Tony…Tony had a life beyond the dreamscape. He should be able to love and make a family…not waste his years away in a dream...with Steve.
Steve nodded and said, “Let’s take a walk…”
“…I don’t think I can go on saving others when I could not save the one person who mattered,” Steve whispered without meeting the Director’s eyes. “You once told me you had people who would gladly take up my mantle. Well, I am gladly giving it up to them.”
“…Tony, h-how long have you and Cap…?”
‘Alright, but only on one condition.’
With a warm gaze, Tony replied, “No problem.”
As they went down, Peter tried again, “Can I open it
“I am sorry, Sir. I am unable to connect to the server. Suit systems are returning to optimum function, but outside communication is very limited. I cannot get a reading on
Steve was quick to grow out a beard and, from Goodwill, got a large backpack to tote around his shield and uniform along with other amenities needed for living on the streets.
Another cold reminder of how the world had changed. Steve stated, “This is not my era. This is not my war or fight.”
But Steve felt like a different man. He looked down to Tony and reassessed the thought, he was a more appreciative man. He’d gone through losing his lover and he knew how lucky he was to have him again.
His soulmate did not reply which was not surprising as the Red Skull had shot him in the back of the neck.
He snatched the apple and loaf from him and began to devour it like a wild animal.
There was a loud crash overhead and everyone’s heads snapped up to see what it was. Tony slid across the glass ceiling. He was in his armor but was missing his helmet and one of his gauntlets. Tony was so focused on his opponent that he did not seem to notice them and quickly turned back to the man he was fighting.
They were…tingling.
“No,” Natasha growled from her balancing beam as soon as Steve entered the gym with Peter on his hip. His son played with the dog tag on his wrist. Steve left it with him and probably was not going to take it back.
He came to a halt where the footprints showed signs of bending down and he felt his stomach drop as he took in the large, circular formation left imprinted in the ice next to the footprints.
Tony continued, “Well, you can't fix me! I'm a fuck up even with you here! I –!”
Natasha hit him over the head and said, “Try again.”
The audience’s volume quadrupled and, by the volume, he knew it was going to take them a moment to calm down.
Bucky remained where he stood in the hall with stooped shoulders and a forlorn expression trained on the point where Natasha disappeared. Steve rushed up beside him then pressed the napkin into his bloody nose. Bucky winced but put his hand over Steve’s and applied additional pressure. Steve removed his hand and he was glad to see Bucky keep the napkin up to his nose.
“No!” Steve hissed fiercely as the weapons were pointed at Tony. He took a step toward Tony and half the guns swung in Steve’s direction.
“You will break out of it again and again. Every day, you not only regain memoires, but you grow stronger…” She placed her hand on his chest and whispered, “And you seem even stronger when you are with me.”
“Babe, I’ve had nightmares before. I’ll get over these like the others.”
"No," Tony replied defensively and a little too quickly.
They were a few weeks old but it clearly showed that they were not the first to discover Cap’s final resting place.
“Go right ahead, Edwards,” Steve retorted still smiling that larger than life smile.
amazing. How did you pull that off?”
Standing in front of it, he cleared his throat, but the suit did not react. He tried knocking gently on its chest next. He didn’t expect a reaction, however, it suddenly seemed to grow a little taller as it lifted its head and its eyes flickered on. The glowing gaze bypassed Howard and locked onto Tony and then the robot was no longer in front of Howard but by Tony's side.
“You are not doing this at this hour,” Steve moaned. Steve lifted one of his arms off Tony’s side and wearily rubbed his face.
“No,” Peter whimpered, his small hands knotted tightly into Tony’s shirt. Bruce glanced at his friend and was glad to see that Tony continued to sleep. Tony was Bruce’s best friend but he would not understand and most likely would not approve of what he was about to tell his son.
Steve reached up to him and Tony fell to his knees, falling into Steve’s arms with a sob. After taking in the state of his suit and lack of helmet, Steve gasped, “What happened to you? Are you alright??”
The brat’s parents weren’t supposed to be there! Hell! The kid was supposed to be here alone! It was going to be an easy kill and
Bucky put up no word of complaint, but Tony didn’t expect him to…
’s Doc Brown yelling,
From his place in Steve’s arms, Peter’s eyes had grown huge and he looked around the room with fascination.
Steve twitched as he strangled the resulting sob in his throat.
Tony found his friend hunched over in an unused hall.
Despite the tremendous pain he was in Steve pushed himself up to the elbows and looked up the 200 feet he fell. Tony was no longer on the storage container and there was no sign of him, Pepper, or Kilian.
Yet being the only child of Tony Stark did not equate to such a life. He’d been lucky so far but it ran out on Monday, August 8th.
Steve gulped dryly and whispered, “No, I didn’t…It’s…ah, complicated…”
Not that Peter did not enjoy his aunt embarrassing the hell out of him, but he found that he and Wade suddenly could not impose any longer.
die and that was the last thing Peter wanted.
Peter lifted his head as he opened his eyes and smiled lightly at Wade. His boyfriend must have been keeping an eye on him. Peter reasoned, “I think I ate too much sugar.”
“Still have no interest in returning…” Howard stated dryly.
They had a future together now and, from the photos he’d seen, it looked like it was going to be a happy one.
As Tony settled back onto the bed and looked up at his super soldier, he realized from now on, when Tony woke in the morning, Steve would be by his side. He'd wake up to this man every morning, smiling in a way that practically radiated with his love for him. The very thought made Tony smile.
Steve reached his floor just when Jarvis got back to him. The AI stated, “Sir will be glad to join you but he said he hopes you will not ‘eat’ him in front of your son as it might not be appropriate.”
They were both backed into a corner with Iron Man and the Falcon hovering overhead and the Winter Soldier and the Black Widow standing in front of them with guns trained on them.
They hadn’t made love since they had first parted, all of those years ago.
“What’s up, Pep?”
“Without that suit you are nothing but a weak man,” Schmidt stated, pulling himself out of the wall. “And even with your armor, I can crush you with my bare hands. You are no match for me.”
to help you…Steve?”
‘You, me, the moonlight, and New York’s best chimichangas. Tomorrow night.’
“Or swoon in your arms,” Tony said in a mocking romantic sigh.
“It’s really her,” Uncle Tony stated with a smirk.
“An old friend of
“Slow down,” Steve murmured, bumping him with his elbow as he walked by.
“Are you really in danger?” Steve asked, looking skeptically out the windows to the peaceful scenery outside. Tony was beginning to wonder the same too.
He finally acknowledged what he had been avoiding for days: there was nothing more they could do for Steve.
Steve did not wait for a retort and slid Tony’s loose jeans and boxers from his hips. He bent down and, one by one, pulled Tony’s legs out of his scrunched clothing. When he stood again, Tony grasped his arm and made him look in his eyes.
“A moment of reflection,” Jarvis advised and stepped back until he disappeared into the shadows. The only clue to his continued observance was the glow of Iron Man’s eyes burning through the darkness.
As more time passed, Steve grew increasingly on edge. Where was Bucky? Was he unable to follow him? Or was he watching him?
They were back in their bedroom. The same bedroom where he and Tony were going to make love in so, so long ago. Their clothes were still strewn where they had thrown them and even the sheets still had their imprints. Nothing had changed since they were last there.
“The breaks in my bones are only minute fractures now, I can walk on them for short periods and my skin is already starting to regrow,” Steve stated. He had already removed most of the bandages and only kept the ones on his face so not to scare Peter. His flesh was mostly exposed on his jaw and only a part of his ear had grown back. The white of his left eye was also bright red so he kept it closed. His hands were dark red and swollen as was the skin of his neck and the right side of his face. Yet, since he woke the swelling had gone down greatly. Steve was confident he would be better in a few days at this rate.
“Iron Man, Iron Man, Iron Man,” Solo muttered darkly. “His technology is too advanced. It’s alien. He’s one of them,” Solo grumbled.
“You could just keep it in your chest?” Steve suggested, chewing nervously on his bottom lip.
“Little robots, use my reactor to heat up my thrusters to max setting and we’re going to turn this Sandcastle into glass!” Tony frantically yelled.
“She wasn’t throwing out the Avengers’ trash,” Tony replied. “She was keeping it.”
Peter closed his eyes and took comfort in Wade’s nearness. He lightly nuzzled his face against Wade’s and whispered, “Feels mighty comfy here…”
to solidify it.”
It was vastly unprotected compared to the future mansion he’d live in with his family, in upstate New York. It’d be so easy for Norman to go in there and slowly choke the life out of him.
Tony dropped his head and garbled, “It-It was me –Pep – I was the one who-who hurt him. I shot him. I-I didn’t mean to but—! He can’t die. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself knowing…”
“No,” the Goblin hissed. “Last year, when I broke into Stark’s lab to get samples of the boy’s DNA, I was promised to see results in a matter of months but here we are…No, closer than we had started. I want what I paid for…”
“I got worse burns from Electro,” Peter assured his father.
Bucky rubbed his forehead and murmured, “Jumbles. Only a little bit of you…Mostly… Mostly I remember killing people. Shooting them in the back, in the head, in the heart, or in the stomach so they would die painfully and slowly…”
Steve lay in the top basket of the iron-wrought, fire escape. He was curled on his side and his limbs had been placed with care into the fetal position. He was unconscious but the Soldier hadn’t just flung him down there and had taken the time to make sure he was comfortable.
Steve’s eyes fell on the mark and knew he shouldn’t but he could not help but he aroused by it. He peered at it possessively and licked his lips as he remembered the salty tang of Tony’s skin.
“No,” Steve chided, sitting up with him. He reached out to Tony and lightly grasped his knee and said, “Just promise you will not go straight to Peter and demand they break up. Hear your son out before judging the man he’s seeing.”
Wade would gladly remove the mask for Peter. He was already yearning to see Peter with his own eyes and to see him smile
Tony stepped beside him lightly pinching his arm to grab his attention. Steve exchanged a warm smile with his husband and then redirected his gaze as their son approached them.
“What?”
Pepper would try to be shaking some sense into him by this point.
Steve realized, “You don’t have shoes. I’ll get you those while you bathe.”
Thor was laughing as he stepped back into their realm. As soon as his eyes fell on Heimdall, he boasted, “Another great battle and worthy victory!”
“D-Did I hurted it?” Peter asked, tears were growing in his eyes.
“Peter, we don’t even know if it is really her,” Uncle Bruce reasoned, his voice was a little shaky.
Eddie was distracted by Venom as he imagined several tops for himself. Peter covered the watch with the sleeve of his shirt, feeling…strange. He trusted Eddie so his abnormal thoughts of pushing Eddie away weren’t…right. But, this was Venom. Venom was going to protect Peter’s identity. He
“One of you will need to bring up the adoption with Peter,” Pepper stated.
“We did?” Steve asked, his expression pinched with worry and upset. He clearly did not remember and he looked like he was trying to see if the Red Skull was telling the truth or not.
Tony opened his legs and Steve stepped between them but they only touched by their carded fingers. Steve whispered, “Right now,
"Oh, it's so much more far-fetched," Bucky countered.
handle Tony dying.
Barnes hovered in the background, making the hair stand up on the back of Tony’s neck despite the uneasy truce they’d called.
Tony pulled Steve deeper into his face and pressed another kiss into Steve’s forehead. Steve relaxed into his hold so he continued to pepper his face with kisses. All were meant to comfort and nothing more.
“…Aunt Peggy?” Tony guessed, not looking up from the folder in his hands.
Looking at Tony, Steve’s heart fluttered. His eyes focused on the same brown eyes that had caught his attention when he first saw his photo, and he stared at them unabashed. His gaze was even better in the flesh. But, better yet, his mate was a man and he could be with him without fear.
Peter pressed back into Wade, making the older man inhale sharply, similarly to what Peter had just done. He pressed back onto Wade’s sex and knew the merc had to be biting back a groan.
Steve lightly grasped Tony’s side and pulled him closer before answering his friend’s request and lightly touching his lips to Tony's neck. In response, Tony made a moaning noise in his throat that made Steve’s toes curl.
Tony nodded and Steve slipped out. Steve instantly went in search of the quartermaster on duty and was able to get some shoes for Tony. He’d glanced at his feet and guesstimated the time traveler’s size but he was pretty confident he guessed right. After that, he strolled back to his room, stopping to check in with a few sentries.
Peter placed the beaker onto the counter beside him and then stated, “Can you please take off your mask, Wade?”
His heart shuddered at the memory of their hurt expressions.
Steve looked down at his chest. Beneath the layer of ice was his internationally recognizable uniform and on his back was his shield. They would know who he was in seconds.
to see your
Tony stepped out of Steve's hold and looked at his husband with a pinched gaze. He asked, “Really, Steve, what is with the sudden interest in the shield?”
Tony suddenly spun back around and his eyes fell on Steve and they were full of gratuity. He did not know how well he knew Mary but next thing he knew Tony had his arms around both of them. Steve tensed then relaxed into his hold.
He paused with his hands still on the door as he processed the situation he was in. Ever since he realized who they really were, his mind had been racing, trying to come up with a reason as to why these incredible people just stepped into his life and only one plausible reason came to him: They knew he was Spider-Man.
“Thank you,” he gasped. He hugged Bucky, not caring how Natasha and Clint will construe it and repeated, “Thank you.”
…You referred to Hydra in the present tense…” Steve’s grip was tight on Tony but he barely noticed because he was too focused on what Steve was saying. Steve gulped and whispered, “Hydra still exists in this future?”
“Yes, DNA…but you yourself said the DNA was old,” Marcel pressed.
He recoiled as soon as he saw where the Red Skull had shot him. He stared at the mortal wound for several seconds, unable to comprehend what it meant in that span of time.
Fury leveled his eyes at Stark and studied his expression. The man was truly worried for the Captain. Coulson had written in his reports that there was the possibility that Stark was sleeping with a man. Had these two really grown so close in the short amount of time they had been together?
"Sorry for letting you slip on the secret identity deal?" He didn't mean for it to happen but he bet Peter also blamed him for what happened!!
Coming up, Chapter 2: Practice makes Perfect
Peter quickly calmed down in their presence. He unwound his arms from around the other two and let go of Tony as he embarrassedly murmured, “Sorry…”
Coulson’s thoughts dwindled to a stop as he noted the fresh footprints.
“We literally just reunited too,” Tony added. “
“But can you help him?” Steve asked with a note of exasperation.
“And if we told you about it before you even met him…” Tony added and trailed off, the implications obvious.
Never before had he ever felt as powerless in the dreamworld as he did at that moment.
“What? There’s a built-in jock strap,” Steve said.
Steve tightened his embrace and tears spilled from his eyes as his emotions overcame him. Tony was
What happened to Steve in this new future? What...what horrors did Tony create for him?
Steve got an odd look on his face and he asked Peter, “How are you doing?”
“Is Romanov your girlfriend? Is she the man in the relationship?
The burning metal of his dog-tags seared into his flesh. The discomfort from that was the only thing that kept him focused and able ignore the rest of the pains of his body cooking alive. He was able to use it to remember Peter and center his mind on surviving for him.
Steve took the papers and flipped through them quickly. He commented, “One more meeting then Air Force One and then arrival at secure location…Where’s the location?”
The comfort of a bed and Steve’s familiar form, made Tony’s body feel sleepy but, on the inside, he was an emotional wreck.
Iron Man must have been inside the building with the perpetrators because Steve saw no sign of him outside and Tony was stubbornly ignoring their hails.
The VA rep walked up to them and, with an amused grin, he said, “Hey guys, I’m Sam Wilson...”
His room had turned into a makeshift hospital with various machine sitting around his bed recording his vitals. Wade was dozing at his side with his limbs thrown over Peter in his bed. On Peter’s other side, and on the edge of his bed, his father also slept with his face buried in his arms and his bottom sitting on the edge of Peter’s desk chair.
“I don’t care,” Steve groaned. He could not even remember what Tony asked him. He growled, “Your mouth, on me, now.”
Bucky struck him again, breaking his nose. He was hit a few more times and he heard Maria screaming his name.
He no longer needed the reactor…
Steve felt like the breath had been knocked out of him and his legs stopped moving.
mistake…”
That knife of betrayal not only twisted inside of Tony but also gutted him and then felt like it proceeded to viciously stab him in the chest as Obadiah walked away from him with the arc reactor in hand.
“No, really, Tony. Thank you, for everything. Between the lawyers and the advice…even warning me…thank you. I don’t know what I would have done without you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'd rather die a hero than live as a monster," his host reasoned and Venom screamed in frustration.
Steve was still smiling widely. He knew Tony well enough to know when he was fibbing. He kissed Tony’s cheek again and he rubbed his arm, stating, “Peter will be overjoyed.”
“Good morning, baby boy,” Wade murmured, his voice made husky by sleep.
Tony seemed to be hanging on to just his words. Steve gently cupped Tony’s cheek, caressing his cheek bone with his thumb. Those hazel eyes were cloudy with pain, despair, and love. Tony's gaze was locked with his, but Steve could already see those beautiful eyes weakening.
“Okay…” She whispered, lightly touching his shoulder. He leaned into her touch and she continued, “I’ll order some pizza and then we can put him up in one of the guest rooms.”
The supermarket was small and, with all of the souvenirs, it seemed to cater to tourists more than locals.
Steve almost called out to them but then he saw their flag and he ducked lower to the horizon.
Steve flushed as he immediately remembered the offhand comment Tony had made prior to the other statement about using the same images to masturbate to. Natasha saw the blush and inquired, “Well..?”
The reporters started screaming questions in a frenzy and Tony laughed.
Steve couldn’t stop touching him after that and the feeling was mutual for Tony. He wanted to go straight to bed but Steve murmured something about feeling bad about ignoring their team. Using Jarvis, they called everyone together for lunch.
No, no, no, no! Why did he say that?? Tony was probably joking about practicing!! He was just thinking about how mortified Tony must have been but then there he was forcing him into a situation Tony only teased about happening! Steve tried to brush it away and smirked awkwardly at Tony. The older man was staring at him with a blank expression and Steve laughed nervously and said, “Never mind, it was just a—.”
Steve smiled gratefully at the agent and they changed the subject to the public relations nightmare Steve was going to have to face.
“Fuck you and your selfish feelings,” Bucky growled. He grabbed a fistful of Steve’s hair with his metal hand and drew back his head. He hissed against his lips, “You don’t want me to kiss you? You want me to be pissed at you? You want me to kick you out of here. Fine. But I am still going to look out for you. You are still my mission…” Bucky paused and his faced relaxed from his snarl into something tender. He whispered, “Or do you want me to make you forget him? Fine. Done. It is going to happen unless you command otherwise.” Bucky rubbed his semi-hard length into Steve’s thigh and Steve inhaled sharply. Bucky obviously had a carnal idea on how to make him forget.
“I have a feeling Bucky can fill us in, right, soldier?”
? New Mexico? Are we talking E.T. here, Jarvis?” Tony asked excitedly. Thoughts of Area 51 and other alien conspiracies blossomed in his mind.
Steve’s fingers dug into Tony’s back, ready to move him at a moment’s notice. Hulk roared and jumped toward them. His emerald eyes were focused on Tyler and filled with murder.
It was the same smile Steve had seen when Tony flirted with him.
“Look at me! Look at you!” Tony retorted, “What are you doing to that machine?! It is my only ticket home and you’re picking it apart!”
Bucky wordlessly went upstairs with his box and Tony watched him go with a dumbfound expression.
He could have Steve.
The Tesseract unnerved her anyway.
“Eventually,” Steve guessed.
Bucky was on him before he could finish his rant. He cupped his hands around his neck and kissed him so hard all the breath escaped Steve’s lungs.
“Captain Rogers?” One of the secret service agents approached him and Steve directed his attention to him. The man handed him a few papers and said, “Here is the President’s itinerary. You will be shadowing him the rest of the day.”
He felt tired.
“Reporters, screaming fans, etc. The public is going to want a glimpse of their long-lost Captain,” she replied. Natasha was to be his SHIELD liaison and keep an eye on him but her cover was that of his public relations assistant. She was currently on her phone answering e-mails ranging from senators to the local news stations.
“Bruce, let’s go make some popcorn,” Steve said and Peter tensed. “Then we’ll start a movie.”
Telling Howard of all people…
“Rhetorical question, Jarvis!” Tony groaned. “Go on mute!”
“That has been a long time,” Tony commented. His eyes followed Steve’s hands as they traced the edge of his penis, going up and down with nothing more than a fleeting caress. His dick throbbed at the touch and the promise for more. Tony lifted the towel out of the water and the excess fluid poured off the fabric in a loud chorus of splashing water. He quickly rubbed the soap into a lather on the towel and stated, “I think I will start there and if your doctor asks, we did this for hygienic purposes.”
Everyone looked Steve down and their eyes landed on his feet. The cheap plastic rubber of the flip-flops had rubbed his skin raw and, now that he was standing still, his feet were really beginning to throb. Steve kicked off the shoes and Bucky immediately started to fuss over him just like he used to in the past.
As soon as his door closed behind him, the limo’s engine rumbled to life and the vehicle began to drive. The driver’s screen was up so it was just him and Natasha.
Steve nodded with a clenched jaw. It was a problem but it was one he would have to face tomorrow. Today, he had to get Peter to Bruce.
Because one thing was certain: Deadpool wasn't good enough for Peter.
“I’m sorry to drop in uninvited but I am in need of Vibranium and
“On foot?” The cashier reiterated like he was crazy. “You don’t have anyone picking you up or like an Uber or…anything?”
Grinning wider than he’d ever seen, Wade leaned in and whispered, “You know, Stark invited a lot of supes and I’d recognize that ass anywhere, Spidey.”
Steve always believed that to be the case. No matter what evils he faced or the wrongs in the world, he thought it was all going to be alright because Bucky was going to be with him to the end.
“You’ll die!” She gasped and another explosion.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, his smile not breaking as he uttered the greeting.
Steve and Tony had been sticking close together ever since Tony revealed himself to him. Originally, Tony stayed by the man’s side for safety. He needed help navigating the past and Steve was his biggest asset. Tony had also done so with Bucky but,
Upon Tony’s call, Steve looked up with some reservation. Iron Man hovered a few feet above him. Tony asked, “Do you need a lift to the meeting point?”
“I’m also the smartest man he has ever done, if you catch my drift,” Tony teased.
“Steve…I…It was real? This just now, and before, I want to comfort you. That is real!
The Goblin could already be in this timeline and Steve knew the space time continuum was fickle. His and Cable’s presences may alter the Goblin’s plans and he wanted to be there for Tony if such a thing occurred.
Steve grasped his friend’s shoulders and stated, “Yes, there is a robot but it is not here anymore. It went flying after the Red Skull.”
Wherever they were, as long as they were together, it was home…but his super soldier was ecstatic to be back in his home town and Tony was glad to have made that happen.
Peter wanted him.
They were sitting on the railing to the Brooklyn Bridge, eating their meager lunches, while cars and commuters passed by. The ocean breeze was hitting them at just the right angle so they wouldn’t have to smell the stink of the city or the cars’ exhaust.
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers, the detectives need to collect Mr. Rogers’ DNA to compare it to the sample Ms. Tyler gave.”
Peter last communicated he was swinging over to Tribeca to help the police with what was supposed to be crowd control. The rest of them were in Lower Manhattan where the heart of the attack was but Friday reported Peter had run into enemy combatants and they hadn’t heard anything since.
Wade laughed and he eagerly replied to May, “Yes, please! I always wondered if it were possible for Pete to look any cuter!”
Okay, not so quiet house now.
To distract himself while he waited for Pepper to get the information, Tony finished updating the Mark III. He kept the color scheme from the Mark II, loving the way the gold-titanium paired with the hot-rod red.
Steve lowered the picture and smiled at their son. He asked, “Do you need something more?”
Peter’s day at the lab was surprisingly pretty normal. The normalcy came from the fact that he mostly worked with Eddie and, after his initial approach, his friend acted like nothing was wrong. Both of them directed their full attentions to their research and didn’t have time to discuss Peter’s parentage.
satellites. It's like they are not there…”
Living at the Tower would be good for both of them. It would give Steve constant contact with his friends and Peter a stable father. He just hoped Tony would still take them.
Bucky swallowed his toast thickly and murmured, “How?”
Grinning, Peter wrapped an arm around Wade’s waist tightly and pulled his mask back down. Wade also pulled his mask back down and Peter said, “Hang on!”
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied and Iron Man’s arm lifted and pointed its repulsor at the bullet wound in his chest. Tony bit down on his lip and Jarvis fired a blast from the repulsor. Tony strangled his immediate scream in his throat so Steve wouldn’t hear it.
Steve fell and he heard explanations of alarm and fear. Moments later, clothed hands were turning him over and they were talking to him.
“Come on, inspire me,” Tony said.
Tony wrenched his arm out of Steve’s hold and rose into the air.
“Why aren’t you putting your resources towards finding
Tony didn’t have complete control back, but he did have some movement. He tried to get up and run after the man but ended up falling on the floor.
“It’s just us, Eyepatch, unless you want to include Bucky but, last I checked, he’s not really into threesomes,” Tony replied, picking up the container of blueberries he brought with him and sat down on his couch as he began to munch.
“Please do not call her ‘Ms. Tyler,’” Tony grumbled from behind his laptop. “’Ms.’ makes her sound civilized.”
To distract Tony, Steve smirked and asked, “What? No wisecracks about my being bald?”
But Steve was back in the lab.
Tony pinched his chin and then teased, “So we
Tony strolled up to Steve’s side and then leaned into him. He looked at the holograms and perceived from the text, “Bucky?”
Tony felt his “unfit” tendencies tingling and he asked, “So, if you had data to work with, it’ll help?”
Peter tipped his head back and Wade greedily accepted the wordless invitation to love on Peter’s neck some more. Peter melted into his arms as he trailed tiny bites down his neck. Peter wound his arms around the back of Wade’s neck and whispered, “Why was that picture up? Are you already conspiring for the next Valentine’s Day?”
“Move,” Steve commanded after several seconds of motionlessness. Steve clenched his muscles around Tony’s cock and Tony dropped his head with a loud moan. He needed friction. This immobility made him squirm with discomfort. When Tony did nothing Steve growled, “Move, Goddamnit!!”
“I don’t know,” Peter replied, looking around the field. “Oh! There he is!”
“Yes,” Steve replied and he picked Peter up. Peter slumped over in his hold and curled into his chest with a tired yawn. Peter mumbled incomprehensible words into his chest and continued to refuse to open his eyes.
Steve woke with a strangled gasp. Hyperventilating, he strangled the sweat soaked sheets and stared straight up into the darkness as he caught his breath. His heart was beating so fast it bordered on painful but he did not notice his physical pains…the emotional onslaught from his nightmare was too strong to ignore.
Wade pressed Peter into the tiled wall and kissed him with renewed fervor, physically showing Peter how much he loved him.
But the darkness was short lived.
“Steve better be with it,” Tony gritted through clenched teeth. He did not know what to think if he only found Steve’s shield. Steve never let out of sight. If need be, Tony knew he was able to tear down this entire building to find his friend.
“You said it yourself Bruce…”
He was hurting too. Every time Tony winced or he saw the marks, or he contemplated how much longer they had…he felt like someone was trying to rip his heart out of his chest.
“My friends tell me they can only handle small doses of me at a time,” Tony teased.
She sat him beside Steve and James continued to shake. It had nothing to do with the cold. He was used to the cold but the pain from disobeying the Red Skull refused to dissipate. Steve was pressed heavily into his side and could feel his shivering.
Tony turned as he approached and hit Steve with a dazzling smile.
“Sir –,” Jarvis began.
Unsure how Howard would handle the information, Steve cautiously replied, “Yes…”
He not only gained Iron Man but also gained a new outlook on life. He couldn’t say he stopped hating his soulmate. The person had a lot to answer for, for never using his program. But he started to wonder again and hopefully imagine a happiness they could share.
When he reached his chin, however, Steve paused. His lips hovered over Tony’s with only an infinitesimal amount of space between them. His breath was escaping him in shallow pants as he stared at his mouth. So close. How many times had Steve dreamed of this?
Peter looked for the faces of his Pops and Dad in the reflection but they were not proudly standing behind him like he had always imagined.
And what was going to happen to him? He’d woken up in a test tube. Was this robot going to bring him back?
,” his Pops gasped, his voice filled with a combination of pity and comfort, and Peter was instantly confused.
“Totally did and he is the suavest motherfucker around.”
Tony had built a special scanner for his chest alone as the reactor and metal shards were the worst things to put into an MRI machine. Jarvis brought it out of the containment storage in the floor below and DUM-E was lightly tapping it when Tony reached the workshop.
“How about you, me, and Uncle Tony go to the park?” They did not need to wait for the weekend to go with Ben and May.
Steve laughed and assured the teenager that robots were definitely impressive.
The paper with his phone number was crumpled into a ball beside him, forgotten by Bucky. Steve stared at it morosely. Such a simple thing was the precursor to a traitorous act. He gently picked it up, stared at it a moment, and then smoothed out the wrinkled paper. He carefully folded it and slipped out of the bed.
“I feel dead,” Steve groaned. He only had cracked open his right eye, his left eye still inoperable, and peered at Tony. He had a glow around him from the fire burn all round him it reminded him of the religious paintings he studied in art school. He whispered, “You look like an angel.”
The only difference was his heart was beating not out of fear but from excitement.
Bucky dropped the gun and clutched his head, his legs swaying beneath him.
“We want to keep this on the Down Low,” Tony stated. “We don’t know how the American public would react if Steve came out.”
Steve spun around and, soon as his eyes fell on Tony, his gaze darkened with desire and he gulped.
“I don't know,” Steve whispered and bitterly pulled back his hand.
Steve sighed heavily and unconvincingly whispered, “I know…”
He’d already been taken to a detention cell to sleep for the night. Though it looked more like a small hotel room than a cell. The priest’s eyes widened with recognition when he saw Tony.
The parted slowly and grinned happily at each other. They only had eyes for one another and the rest of the world faded in the background.
“I think you and the Man of Iron need to sit down and talk,” Loki teased.
It was at that moment Kilian decided to step out of the fire again. Tony cleared the distance between himself and Steve. He tore the pipe from his clutches. He stepped in front of Steve and raised it like a bat, drawing a chuckle from Kilian.
Tony’s eyes widened as he recognized the river and the familiar cityscape in the backdrop. Peter was in New York. He could have walked past him on the street and would have never known. Weren’t Richard and Mary talking about moving to Virginia?! What were they doing in New York??
To which, Steve did not bother to respond and merely rolled his eyes.
Laying across his legs was Steven’s prone body. He could smell the man’s burnt flesh and froze, wondering if he should move him. But then Obadiah moved in his peripheral vision. Tony sat up sharply and half expected Obadiah to come charging at them.
!” The Soldier exclaimed.
was the current topic of discussion.
“Did you hear that, Petey? You’re going to be fine, your papa got worked up over nothing. Do you want more food?” He asked. Peter had finished his banana but was still watching his cartoon.
He went straight to Steve and gave him a quick hug from behind. He murmured a greeting to his husband and then slipped from him. He looked to his son and nodded, “Hey, Pete.” His eyes then turned to Wade and all the good feelings he had curdled down into his gullet and threatened to expel in a bout of explosive diarrhea.
Tony stopped what he was doing and sincerely replied, “Yes, he was.”
Oh Tony...
They rose into the air and the boosters on the robot’s feet blasted with more power. The air thinned and the speed was too much for Peter, knocking him out before he could even guess where the android was taking him.
Coulson led Bruce over to the current readings and Tony circled the cylinder. Tony was taking in the image of the Captain, memorizing him for later that night when he was all alone with his favorite brand of moisturizer and a box of tissues.
“I-I’m scared,” Tony whispered into Steve’s chest.
“I understand why you did it,” Tony whispered, hating seeing such pain in Steve’s eyes. Hell, he was willing to change the future to save Steve but ended up damning him to Hydra instead. But still… “It still hurts. I wish you spoke to me –
“They’ll send an intern over as soon as they’re ready,” Pepper admonished, sounding more amused than annoyed.
Being told so wasn’t enough.
‘Oh you can service me whenever you want! ;D’
“And what about SHIELD?” Peter inquired.
“And when exactly did you two find the time to fall in love and become engaged in the five minutes…” Fury paused and then his glare burned hotter as he hissed,
“You should return to bed,” Bruce whispered, his eyes flickering up to Tony.
“Am I keeping you awake?” Tony murmured into his arm.
{Shut up! You're ruining the best moment of our lives!}
Wade made another strangled noise. He was still freaking out over Captain America being in an apron but then Peter had to go and call him “Pops” and make one of the world’s greatest heroes so-so… so fantastically
“The Black Widow Program and me,” he whispered and his eyes seemed to bore deeper into hers.
“Just tell him everything he needs to hear,” Bucky stated.
Bucky grasped Steve's head with both hands and slammed Steve’s head into the hard cement. His skull cracked as easily as an egg under Bucky’s strength and sounded like a watermelon cracking open. Hot blood flowed from his scalp.
different than that little exchange. He didn’t get to exchange a handshake but, worse, the Captain was so morose that he could even smile.
Then she was gone, leaving behind a lot of baffled people and questions.
He rubbed his face, trying to dispel the nervous feelings that cropped up. As he moved, his phone shifted in his pocket and all his worries melted away as he remembered what he had planned tonight.
They had a bag of bagels between them, a platter of eggs over easy, bacon, and toast. They had enough to feed a small army or, in their case, two super humans.
It was rare to be born with because it meant one did not have a soulmate. Usually, most got zeroed out soul implants when their soulmates died. His Ma was one of those few people.
He only had to wait less than a minute before the phone in his pocket started to buzz. He took a single hand off the blanket and slipped the phone out of his pocket. It was an unknown number but he knew who it was. Bucky had kept the number he gave him.
Steve snorted and a relaxed silence fell between them. Steve's hands were gentle as they spread the bandages and smoothed them down in a nearly never-ending touch.
Steve gently grasped the tablet and slipped it from Tony’s hold. Steve whispered, “They were my friends…from before…”
They went back to the safe house and the Avengers split off as they divided into different areas to be alone with their soulmates and families.
Another double chapter! I'm on a roll! Hopefully I can keep this up! :)
Natasha was about to name another when he hoarsely demanded, “Say it again.”
Peter looked down with a frown and asked, “Why can’t I go too?”
Peter snorted as he slid off him and glanced around Wade's room before his eyes settled on a small, empty trashcan. He picked it up and asked, “Can I keep it in here?”
Peter instantly began to shiver in the freezing temperatures.
Steve draped the quilt over Peter’s shoulders and sent out a prayer to Mary and hoped she knew Peter was doing well.
Tony’s brows rose with the new information. So they were going to find a way to get the shrapnel out of him, eh? Still, so soon after recovering from the palladium poisoning, he felt a little relieved by this.
“Yes, Ma’am.”
She twisted the broken arc reactor from his chest and pulled out the internal wiring with a quick jerk. Tony hissed from the sharp burst of pain and Pepper whispered, “Sorry, sorry. Okay, ew, here I go.” With the new unit in hand, Pepper used her tiny hands to reach into his chest cavity and plugged in the new reactor. The instant it was connected, Tony’s chest pain lessened by half and he felt renewed. He inhaled sharply and felt like he was getting sufficient oxygen for the first in years. His chest ached reminding him that he shouldn’t abuse his lungs too much.
Tony couldn’t believe it. He’d obviously cracked from the pressure of losing his soulmate but he scrambled to his feet either way and ran past Pepper.
Tony grinned and Steve stopped in front of him with only inches to spare. Still grinning, Tony tilted his head to the side and lightly placed his fingertips on Steve’s chest. This tiny spot of contact electrified him and Steve stood straighter.
Within a few minutes, Steve was done. Tony sat up and accepted the towel Steve handed him. He rubbed the excess lather from his face and then looked at the mirror he had left on the desk.
Tony leaned forward to take the bar of soap from its caddie in the wall. He hovered close to Steve, his breath intermingling with Steve’s as he did. It took all of Steve’s willpower not to kiss him.
Venom tried to press upon his emotions…but the boy now knew what he was doing and he knew he could fight back. Whenever Venom tried to turn his will, all his host needed to do was think of being safe in the warm embrace of his sire, his adoptive father, his uncles, or aunts, and their love was strong enough that, in his weakened state, Venom could not break through.
“Perhaps,” Marcel replied and Tony bared his teeth as he snarled.
Tony leaned into his side and punched his arm lightly. He teased, “Steve was a little ruffled from the
but now, with all they knew, it could very well be the movie monster he had joked about.
He never noticed it before but the sky moved. It was how he measured the passage of time as stars and constellations disappeared on the horizon.
Heimdall’s gaze returned to the eons and he commented, “You have gained sight as well as wisdom since your trials on Midgard.”
“Dis isn’t his home?”
Bucky clenched his fists but clenched down on his frustrated words too to keep Howard’s attention on the core. It felt like it took an eternity for Howard connect the welder and the core and even longer for him to begin fusing the metal.
Steve wished he could wrap Peter in a cocoon and protect him from all of this, the reality of death and the loss of a loved one. He was at a loss on how to comfort his son. In the past, all he needed to do was hold his boy and all of Peter's fears or pain would go away. It was the same for Steve, Peter's presence had always calmed him yet now... Tony's loss was so great to both of them that even being with each other was not enough.
Steve happened to come across the kitchens. The food service personnel already searched it and prepped it for breakfast tomorrow. Steve quickly peeked into the walking pantry and grabbed an apple and a loaf of bread. When had Tony last eaten?
“Where is Steve?” Tony asked him.
She left him promising to visit more and then Howard was alone again with his notebook. Memories spurned him to turn back the pages and look at his old notes. He came across a drawing Tony had managed to draw next to his sketch of the Hydra base and smiled sadly at the image. It was a pencil drawing of Captain America's spangled shield. Howard still remembered walking into his office and nearly having a heart attack when he saw the young child treating such a precious object like a coloring book.
“I’m holding you back too…”
Coulson messaged and called him several times, wanting to know what exactly Tony wanted to talk about, but Tony ignored them all in favor of going through SHIELD personnel files. He was too busy sorting out who exactly was SHIELD and who was Hydra and looking for Bucky to explain to the agent that his organization was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
Thank you to everyone who has been following this series from the beginning and thank you for the kudos and comments!
“Good,” Tony replied. He turned back to Steve and pressed his forehead against Steve’s. He stated, “It is very good. It means when we ride off into the sunset, you’ll be able to appreciate how cheesy I am being.”
The suit slumped forward as soon as the men disappeared outside. All the systems turned off and Tony gasped, “J??”
If they’d only met years before the other was destined to die…
, his subconscious subtly reminded him.
“Aye,” Thor murmured, “You have suffered egregious wounds, my friend.”
Come morning, he woke up with a headache and a hungry stomach but he remained in his lab.
“…What?” Bruce asked on the behalf of the others. But with one look to Steve, Tony could see his husband knew too.
All he could wonder about was what Steve and Peter were doing.
“…Maybe another time,” Steve replied.
One week later and their new idyllic home had been left in ruin.
He tried to keep his mind blank. Venom knew everything he thought. So he kept talking to keep his mind busy, and continued, “Bruce and Scott expressed an interest in my shield and I bet their interest is piqued now! It is certainly acting beyond the parameters I had set for it. I bet, with their help, we can
“So where are we going to go right now?” Peter asked.
Steve’s earlier words came back to him, hitting him like a freight train. The man probably feared it because of the persecution he might have faced but, he still
“Have you seen enough?” The SHIELD agent behind her asked.
Howard gently turned the man over so he was laying in a more comfortable position, and then mopped up the excess sweat and tears. Even in sleep, he looked distraught.
“Why can’ I be sweeping?” Peter grumbled.
Steve exited the elevator looking extremely amused and asked, “Are we really going to dance because I feel like we are one step away from having sex.” He motioned to their both being half dressed.
Tony’s excitement deflated a little but he would not let it drag him down. He looked on the brighter side: Tony was willing and Steve was willing. This relationship they were going to portray was fake but it did not mean they could not have fun in the meantime.
“Steve…” Tony began, his voice already defeated. He lightly rubbed the back of Steve’s hand with his thumb, trying to wordlessly comfort him from the action.
As the evidence was presented by the state’s medical examiner, Steve watched the juror box. His stomach curdled as he saw doubt begin to flicker in their eyes.
“Springtime?” Tony asked sarcastically, looking everywhere but Natasha.
Ten minutes later, Bruce returned with a group of hospital employees and a wheelchair.
“I know you will…” Steve whispered back, gently squeezing Tony’s hand. Tony stared at him with a pained but determined gaze and Steve stared back, not wanting the moment to end and to have to let go of him.
This was real. This wasn’t Tony playing some kind of sick joke.
“…Sir,” Jarvis said and then paused, an unusual occurrence for the AI. He continued, “A video file was sent to your personal email. It’s of Captain Rogers. I did not think you should view it alone.”
Peter picked up his head and met Tony’s sympathetic eyes. A single tear escaped and Peter whispered, “You don’t understand…Gwen fell and I jumped after her. I waited until I was close enough and shot my web at her. I caught her but I was too late.” He wrapped his arms around himself. He repeated, “I should not have waited. I should have shot out my web as soon as she started to fall. I killed her. I kil-.”
This wasn’t an “
He contorted his body in odd ways as he worked on his machinery. It was why Steve first started to sketch him. He was used to sketching people in relaxed positions, either sitting down or standing in place. While Tony worked, he was like a contortionist, moving around his inventions in odd angles to get to a piece from a certain vantage point. Steve quickly had his sketchbook filled with various images of Tony contorting his body in ways he did not think possible.
By the tone of his voice, Steve was reminded of the vultures and guessed one of them wanted a close up. Steve tilted his head away so they could not get any good photos of him. Making up his mind quickly, he nodded to the kettle, and said, “Just give me whatever tea you have on the pot.”
Tony pressed Steve to continue, “But?”
Century equates to being homosexual and how in the hell did I not know he was gay?!” Tony butt in.
Coulson stepped into the room and said, “Five minutes.”
Without warning, his dad faded away, leaving Pops frozen over where he once lay. The look on his face was utter shock and heart-wrenching horror and it seared into Peter’s mind like a burning hot brand.
“So…When you’re in this house, you are safe, okay?
The boy would not budge.
Breathing shallowly, Steve slowly lifted his head. He looked first to the Red Skull and then slowly turned to Tony and Bucky. Schmidt wanted him to inject himself and Steve would do it in an instant if it meant saving Tony but…
Tony had agreed to practice touching him. What would it entail? And how intimate would it get?
But it's back and I wanted to let ya'll know that  took some inspiration from CACW in this chapter but it does not contain any spoilers from the movie! Enjoy! :)
The medical examiner’s brows pinched together in confusion and he stated, “Sir, this was the condition of the dress when I received it. There was no tampering. I didn’t believe the Captain could do it either but DNA doesn’t lie.”
Bucky looked away from him again and whispered, “Natasha.”
! If this were real life, however, Iron Man would be the winner…Right, Steve?” He added when he spotted Steve.
“Okay, bye!” Peter gasped, sprinting back out of the lab.
Steve should have been worried about the Hulk. He should have been evacuating the room and trying to calm Bruce but he could not calm himself. He was their leader and he was supposed to be clearheaded in any situation. But he did not give a damn about anything but Peter at that moment.
Howard hugged her, hoping to comfort her. The fact that Cap was dead was too shocking and he couldn’t truly believe it just yet. She let him pull her into his embrace for just a moment but then she pushed herself out of it. She stated, “Steve wanted me to relay a message to Tony…I thought I should tell him what happened to Steve and Steve’s final words all at once to lessen the blow…”
“He survives to time travel,” Peggy pointed out.
The intruder needed no other incentive and spun right around and out the backdoor.
“I’ll see you later, Cap,” he said with a shaky smile and the doors sealed between them, forever cutting him off from Steve and whatever romantic relationship they could have had.
…If he helped Venom more…would that make him a villain?
He was not even allowed a name. His master would never allow him a soulmate too.
“Why would they do that?!” Peter demanded. He broke his eyes away from the photo and looked to his aunt. Her hand was over her mouth and her eyes were glassy.
The agent was a part of the government so Steve avoided her and the agent did not seem to notice or care.
He was back in his bedroom at Aunt May’s and he could hear her singing to herself like she always did when she cooked.
His playlist was playing so he didn’t really notice Bucky until he happened to glance up.
Steve was tempted to blurt out that Tony made an amazing father but bit back the words. He and Tony never discussed Tony’s role with Peter. They started dating when Peter was two-years-old so Peter and Tony were always constants in each other’s lives. Their dating was so natural that they did not even have to explain that they were dating to Peter or what it meant to be gay. To Peter, it was normal and Tony was just of a father to him as Steve was. Tony doted on Peter but Steve was scared to bring up parenthood with Tony. They’d been dating for over a year but they were only boyfriends. They were not married. Tony did not really have any responsibility to Peter and he did not want to unnecessarily impose it on him.
“Okay,” he whispered, his voice sounding dead to him.
Steve’s other blue eye appeared as Steve slowly dropped his hands. Steve murmured, “I’m sorry…I didn’t realize. This – with you Tony – I’m fine with it. I’m obviously more than fine with it,” Steve added with a roll of his eyes as he waved in the direction of his erection. He smiled diminutively at Tony and said, “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me. Promise to tell me if anything is bothering you, alright?”
Mary smile thinly then said, “Where are my manners? Ben meet my partner, Dr. Susan Calvin. Dr. Calvin, this is my brother-in-law, Ben Parker.”
He wore only the white towel around his waist since he did not pause to get dressed as he took care of Steve. He choose some loose clothing for Steve to wear, sweatpants and a large tank. Steve had teased Tony about how easy it would be for Tony to strip him, making Tony groan.
Maybe if Steve kissed the area around his reactor, it'd feel better.
“Like a dream come true,” Tony said with a smile, his vision growing blurry.
Tony dropped the specs he was working on and ran straight to where Jarvis directed him to where Steve was.
Tony grinned and replied, “Pepper came up with it, not me!”
Tony threw back his head and laughed and Bucky smothered a chuckle. Steve flushed and explained, “It’s what guys from the forties called old fashioned people.”
Tony fell back onto the cot and groaned, “Great, you’re worse than me. Pepper is going to have an emotional crisis…who will she mother the most?” He sat up and teased, “With your baggage, I think you’re going to move into her number one spot.”
“I'll get it out of you one way or another future man!” Howard said in parting, waving his hand over his head. He was flocked by his lackies, carrying all the tools they were going to use to dissemble the time machine.
He heard the shower turn on and Tony’s clothes slap the floor. He listened to the water splash as Tony stepped under the spray and, for a few moments, replayed the dozen or so instances he’d seen Tony under the spray. Sometimes he had been in the shower with Tony or sometimes he’d be brushing his teeth and Tony’s figure was just a blur in the background.
When they finally went down for bed, Steve carefully wrapped his arms around Tony but Tony still grunted painfully from his touch. Steve instantly flinched back feeling horrible for causing him more pain. He scooted back, planning to give Tony as much room as possible as he slept.
“No, Pete –,” Steve began.
Bucky nodded, feeling some tension lessen in his muscles, and stated, “Good. I’ll be the first in line to testify at his war crimes trial. The man deserves to go away for life.”
Peter pulled off his mask so he could meet Pops square in the eye and nodded his consent.
Tony couldn’t speak just occasionally moan. His eyes were glassy and full of pain, but focused on Steve as if he were begging him to stop what was happening to him.
None of them being there confirmed the worst to Steve.
More years passed and Tony stopped growing up and started to age. Steve first noticed it in his soulmate’s laugh lines as they stayed even after he smiled. Then he noted the frown lines between Tony’s brows were becoming more pronounced.
Tony didn’t let himself dwell on it and got right down to business, stating, “Alright, any hypothesizes you can come up with to help?”
Steve had never seen anything like it before so he asked, “What is it?”
To Bucky, she pointedly said, “You are not allowed in my room.”
Peter looked around at his collective family with large, scared eyes and gasped, “No!”
Not the expression of relief…
When his dishonesty was discovered, his master threw him to the ground and kicked him until he could no longer breathe. The Soldier lay there and let the master hit him. He deserved it, he had gone against is master’s command. In time, his master grew tired from attacking him and ordered a memory wipe.
“He’s probably one of the most famous people of this century,” Father Michael chuckled. He asked, “Are you looking for him?”
Steve sighed and joined Bucky’s gaze, looking off to the side at nothing in particular. They sat in silence, listening to the sound of their breathing evening out. Eventually Steve broke that silence by saying, “I guess we need to talk…” Bucky did not say anything but from the corner of his eye he say him sit up a little straighter. He knew his old friend would not bring it up. He had a mission and whatever Bucky was feeling about what happened between them he would keep bottled up until Steve ordered him to confront it. Steve would not do that to him so instead he talked and hoped Bucky was listening. Steve continued, “The other day, when we kissed, it was a mistake.”
He could barely see Steve’s fortified expression through his tears but he knew his stepfather. Steve would not let him go until he was dead. Which was more than likely going to happen and there was
“You promised not to speak until I said my piece!” Tony glared at him until Steve shut his mouth and ground his teeth in frustration. Tony continued, “And I’m just a mess, more so especially after the vortex. I’m a grown man but you have to take care of me just as much as Peter, being there for me when I have nightmares, feeding me when I forget to eat, making me sleep…And you are gorgeous but I am this skinny, old guy covered in grease half the time with some grey hair starting to come in…From my perspective, Barnes is a perfect fit for you…You would not believe the number of times I almost called you from California to tell you to cut your losses and go to him…” Tony’s voice dwindled and he looked down, his eyes sad and misty. “I do not think I deserve to be the one you choose. I do not think I am more important…”
Tony kept petting his hair and was muttering something darkly about Vaseline. With a small grin, Steve half listened. One ear took in the soothing tone of his voice and the other the steady beat of his heart and quiet hum of the reactor.
Steve smiled sweetly at the tablet as the video ended.
They reached Oscorp Tower in less than thirty seconds. Steve commanded, “You get Peter out of there and I’ll take care of ‘
“Papa?” Peter’s voice was tiny and fragile.
Tony stepped back and out of Steve’s reach. He sat back down on the chair next to his bed.
His hand returned to cup Tony’s face and Tony leaned into it and lightly kissed the side of Steve’s hand. His lips were wet and left an imprint onto Steve's flesh. Steve’s cock twitched and he froze.
“There’s those two baby blues,” Tony murmured approvingly.
Part 3 is going to be coming out much more slowly than Part 2! So sorry!! I have a lot of work to do on top of writing! DX
Peter’s family had protected him from all sorts of danger throughout his life but there was a period when he was not under their watchful care. Peter may not remember the first years of his life but he could never forget what that tingling sensation meant.
“Guilty,” Tony stated with a grin. He leaned in closer and whispered, “I was putting together the finishing touches on Project Winterwidow Part 6.”
He didn’t see Tony again though Steve did read his file and he saw how much Tony looked like his father, despite the arrogant smile coupled with warm brown eyes.
It was the coffee comment that finally did it…
“The Midgardians were able to defeat the threat without your assistance. If they ever truly needed your support I would have summoned you. At the time, your strength was needed in Alfheim.”
“Sir, did something happen in the past?” Jarvis questioned.
“Tony?!” Steve hissed. He turned around and saw both Bruce and Thor standing tensely in front of the television, on the screen a bulbous cloud of flames was rising from the house. Bruce had his phone out and was dialing a number, Coulson or someone in SHIELD probably.
Steve was right…he did like to “woo” him, especially when he got to see such an expression on his face.
The weeks grew into months.
Thor stepped up to the foot of Steve’s bed and held his hammer before him.
“NO NEED TO YELL?!
With a trembling voice, Howard gasped, “
“Okay, that proves it,” Tony stated, landing next to Steve. “Our Captain never curses…” Tony leaned close to Steve and privately whispered, “Except when I touch him just
She clenched her fists, but Howard did not waver. He needed to make the new element, not help her investigate a probable murderer.
The Americans were informed of his “amnesia” and ecstatically told him of their country. The Russians gave him rudimentary knowledge but these people were actual citizens and knew the little things that Steve had been craving to hear. They came from all over the country from the tip of Southern California to the northern part of Maine. They shared stories of their lives growing up and most were humorous and others were miraculous or adventure filled. They loved to boast which was parallel to the American soldiers he had fought with. It made Steve happy. The world may have changed but the American spirit was as strong as ever.
and Steve had people coming up to him for approvals or questions. He was currently one of the highest ranking officers, Peggy was actually the highest ranking but everyone knew they worked together so Steve was the perfect (less intimidating) proxy. He was probably going to be busy until the rest of the 107
Bucky shook his head and said, “You don’t need me anymore. You do not need to escape your pain. Stark is alive.”
And then there was Tony. Tony who confessed to loving him and then…and then he had to watch as Steve was arrested like a petty criminal.
“Sir, the intruder could still be out there!” Jarvis countered in protest at Howards exclamation.
The third door opened easy enough and the dark corridor started off similarly to the one she and Bruce had ventured down, but theirs led them to a team of assailants, guarding Laura, locked away in a sealed room. Their hall contained things like barricades for someone to hide behind. But the third hall was just smooth walls and the only tactical advantage it would give their enemies would be the easier for them to pick them off in the narrow corridor.
can throw you a birthday party.”
It was
Tony shakily reached out to Steve then grasped the side of his neck. His fingers dug into Steve flesh and his face crumpled. Tony leaned in and pressed his forehead to Steve’s.
Bucky nodded and then clapped Tony’s shoulder, leaving him alone with Steve’s memorial as he rejoined Natasha and they began to walk across the lawn to the reflecting pool.
He wasn’t moving.
“No means no,” Cap retorted and Tony had to hold back his laughter. He’d never seen anyone talk back to his father that way. As a child, he remembered everyone was afraid of the man but Cap was treating
The AI didn’t reply and Tony’s heart seized worriedly. After a few tense moments, the systems began to reboot and Tony could relax.
Bucky chuckled some more and Steve paused to help Peter clean up the pieces of the mug, smiling as he did.  Peter was blushing furiously and mumbling apologies about the broken mug. As soon as the mess was cleared, Peter shot a glare at Natasha.
“Jarvis, tell me everything Bruce plans to do
Steve chuckled into his chest and Tony smiled. Tony raised his hand up to cup the back of Steve’s head and run his fingers gently through his hair. He lightly kissed the top of his head and relaxed into Steve’s hold. It took Steve a few minutes to catch his breath but eventually his panic attack slowly faded away.
“Do you have somewhere in mind?” Steve asked and paused as Peter answered. He then said, “Alright, I will see you at two.”
With the first shot, she staggered back, touched, and looked down at her chest in absolute disbelief.
“Sneaky?” Bucky reiterated with a smirk.
“I broke up with you because you are such a great person and deserved someone who could love all of you: Tony and Iron Man…I thought you understood that when we split but all of this with Steve…I can now see you blame yourself. I am the one at fault, Tony. I am not perfect. I was not strong enough.
Peter crawled up the wall and murmured, "I have no token to leave fair prince. Accept one last kiss?"
“I like that,” Tony purred and the blush on Steve’s cheeks grew warmer. Tony continued, “I especially like that you are not testing your newly freed homosexuality out on me but are really interested in seeing me.” Tony reached out and grasped Steve’s forearm for a few seconds before pulling back and going back to unloading the food. His touch lingered on Steve’s skin in a tingling heat. Tony continued, “So Cap, I figured we eat then perhaps watch a movie. How does that sound?”
“He is actively seeing a man right now,” Steve continued. “I was a little worried by ‘who’ it was but Peter assured me, he makes him happy.”
He laid down on his bed and wrapped his arms around himself. He tried to pretend Gwen was by his side. He thought back to the last time she was in his bed, her light blonde locks were spread out over his pillow and across his arm, the smell of her lavender perfume overriding all other smells, her limbs tangled with his, her hot breathe mixed with his own, their naked bodies pressed to each other, the feeling of being one…and thinking that he was going to spend the rest of his life with her...
“Jealous?” Wade murmured into his ear. His breath was hot and it brushed against Peter’s ear and neck, making shivers run down his spine. The memory of waking up to Wade in his bed resurfaced and those feelings began to rise too.
,” Tony whispered, his voice was tiny but filled with such yearning.
Steve winced and Peggy covertly stood beside him and murmured, “He’s as smooth as a jagged rock.”
She silently walked up to the bedside and peered down at his face. The lurch inside her was more powerful and painful this time. She always pictured him in her mind as the boy she first saw, smiling nervously with such hopeful and loving eyes, but right now Peter looked like a corpse.
Their wedding photo shifted again, only it was Tony’s hand that disappeared a little more.
growing out of your back!?!”
He was so busy looking at the people, he didn’t notice the soccer ball that had been kicked under foot and had conveniently rolled to a stop underneath him. Steve stepped on the ball and fell back. Like something out of a classical romance, he fell onto the bench right beside his mate, and when they looked at each other their timers went off with matching pairs of beeps.
So Venom told his host of their impending demise, he frightened the boy, but the boy countered with thoughts of his sire’s bravery and wanting to emulate him. Images of the sire, younger, smaller, and weaker, came to his mind and his host felt reassured by them.
“Get some food, punk!” Bucky yelled out across the table.
He buried his face into his hands and wept, missing Steve’s comforting embrace more than ever.
“Hey, buddy,” Tony greeted him as he entered.
Peter was in the middle of a huge mass of moving spikes and he looked like a giant sea urchin. Wade was still at his side and his hands had held onto him but he was basically immobile due to the number of impalements he had. His blood was sliding down the tendrils and sloping down to Peter, drenching him in his boyfriend’s blood.
, he imagined Peter correcting him, his voice a loving sigh.
“I need to have a solid timeline now,” Howard sighed. “I can’t help Tony if we are always on the move and in the field. I am limited here. I need access to a proper lab now and chemistry books. Otherwise, all I can do for him is let him sleep on my cot and that won’t fix the reactor.”
Steve positioned himself between himself and the President and replied, “I find that odd since I am in the way of you and your target…Where’s Rhodes?”
Tony wound his arms around Steve’s head and pressed his face into Steve’s scalp and, with Steve, he too wept for their lost child.
“So…?” Howard said expectantly. When Tony simply rose an eyebrow in response, Howard pressed, “If we are going to ignore the white elephant in the room then let’s focus on the pink canary.” Howard pointed at his chest and asked, “What’s it made of?? What does it do??”
“Y-You awe
Tony groaned, “You’re so hot…”
“Have you been able to do since you first moved here?” Bruce inquired.
Tony grinned and flexed himself out on full display, he spared no modesty with a sheet like Steve did. Steve blushed and took the picture. His eyes lingered on Tony and not the phone as he did it. He turned the screen toward him and Tony laughed as soon as his eyes landed on it. Steve had made sure the picture cut off just above his waist but it was low enough that anyone who saw it would know he was naked and proud.
“And,” his father murmured uncertainly. “Everything is okay?”
Howard took it and shook his hand like Tony wanted and said, “Congratulations, son.”
