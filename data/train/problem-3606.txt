Now the only issue was how to broach the topic with Matt.  To just ask outright or wait until it came up naturally?  Though how it would come up naturally, Dean had no idea.
“Mm,” Dean hummed his agreement.  “Damn straight.”
Matt watched this exchange with some interest, which wasn’t that surprising.  Charlie and Bela were both extremely beautiful women, after all.  Still, Dean couldn’t help but feel amused.  “Don’t even think about it, kid.”
Both men watched with amusement as the two teenagers said goodnight.  The rough boy Dean had met last night was so very different when he was around Mary, turning into a shy, stammering mess.  Dean would wager good money that Matt hadn’t spent much if any time around girls.
Ellen saw them come in and met them at the door.  “Hello, boys!”  She smiled at Mary.  “And girl.”
“It’s been too long.”
Cas felt Dean come up behind him, arms slipping around his waist, chin resting on his shoulder.  “It’s beautiful,” he whispered.  He just knew that Dean was smiling, could hear it in his voice as he replied.
The two men waited until they reached their bedroom before they spoke further.  Cas flopped onto the bed.  “Well…..what’s THAT about?”
Dean gave Matt a reassuring smile and then opened the door.  Cindy spilled into the room and pounced on him, nearly sending them both to the floor.  He managed to catch her, laughing.  “Geez, what’re you trying to do, kill me?”
It was a good thing they had worn their jackets.  As soon as they had left the house, it had begun raining.  A very light rain, but still, the jackets kept their clothes dry.
Dean smiled.  “Yea.  Good.”
.  I swear, he puts in more effort than anyone I’ve ever known.”
The two were just finishing up their sandwiches when there came a knocking on the door.  Immediately Matt sobered up, the laughter that had been setting his face alight fading behind nerves that he was desperately trying to hide, and the natural defensiveness that had clearly become engrained over the years.
“You okay?”
Mary’s voice rang out over the sound of Matt’s stifled laughter; Dean turned and saw her fighting her way through the crowd, Chrissy by her side.  Finally she made it over to them.  “What’re you doing here?”
Claire tucked a lock of Mary’s blonde hair (so like her own) behind her ear.  “Doing well in school?”
Matt still looked nervous but he nodded.  With an encouraging smile, Dean hit play, and the music began.  The three began to move, to hand jive.  Matt did fumble, mix up a few moves, and embarrassment and irritation came over his face.
Matt was blushing at the noise he had made, but he nodded.  “They’re really good.”
Ellen came out from the back, wiping her hands on a dishtowel.  “Hey, baby!”  She pulled Dean into a hug, kissing him on the cheek.  “What brings you here?”
Sam punched Dean’s shoulder.  “You’re
Castiel smiled softly.  “I’d love to.”  He seated himself on the bench and looked expectantly at his husband.
Cas accepted Dean’s hand.  “If you get tangled up,” he quoted, “just tango on.”
“Nope.  You get to clean the dance studio.”
Surprise registered on Mary’s face.  “You’re not supposed to know about that.”
He took a deep breath.  He never liked talking about his past.  Mary knew all about it by now (she was old enough) but it still wasn’t a subject he enjoyed discussing.  “You know about my childhood.”  She didn’t know about his attempt at hooking (and if Dean had his way, she wouldn’t know until she was as old as Sam was when HE found out), but she knew about how he grew up hustling to take care of Sam.
“Yeah, sure you are.”
Castiel looked surprised, and a little amused.  “I love you too.”  He stroked Dean’s cheek.  “What brought that on?”
Dean leaned in for another kiss.  “Ecstatic.”
“Fuck o—
“Extra chores this weekend, kiddo.”
“Don’t tell her that.  Her head doesn’t need to be any bigger than it is.”
“Definitely.”  Cas kissed Dean softly, stroking his cheek.  Dean hummed into the kiss, gently nipping Cas’ lip as he pulled away.
They had reached the house now.  Dean cried out in excitement at the sight that greeted them.  Sitting on their front steps was a boy with shaggy brown hair.  He was the spitting image of his father at that age.
“Bye, bitch.”
The ride to Oxford had taken a little over an hour, but it was well worth it to see the glow in Dean’s eyes as he surveyed the place where Lewis Carroll had lived.  Oh, sorry….Charles Dodgson.  Dean only ever called the man by his true name.  As soon as they had alighted from the bus, Dean had grabbed Castiel’s hand and dragged him down the street, laughing all the way.  They wandered the grounds of Christ Church, where Dodgson had lived and taught, took in the beautiful gardens that had inspired the court of the Queen of Hearts, then went inside to look at the beautiful stained glass windows depicting Dodgson himself, along with the real life Alice, little Alice Liddell, the girl for whom Charles Dodgson wrote the book while boating down the river on that golden afternoon so many years ago.  They even paused to examine the andirons in the fireplace that might have inspired Alice’s first growth spurt in the books.  But Cas had something special in mind.
“I also thought you were going to have dinner ready when we got home.”
So far the day had been wonderful, the weather glorious.  They had bought a picnic lunch and eaten by the Seine.  Afterwards, they had taken a nice long walk through the Tuileries gardens.  They were positively lovely, especially on a day as nice as this one.  They were also directly adjacent to the Louvre, so it was easy enough to head right over when they were ready.
, Dean’s first novel, and smiled.
“One,” Cas felt a tugging on his shirt.  Charlemagne’s voice was plaintive.  “I’m
.  It was a lovely piece, but they wanted to put their own spin on it.  They weren’t performing it anywhere….this was just something they did.  They had the time and freedom to do whatever they liked, work on what ballets and pieces they chose, choreograph what moves they wanted.  As much as Dean missed performing, there was a certain joy in this that he had never known in any other kind of dancing.
.  Matt seemed the type.  And they had a good time there, even going so far as to goof off a bit.  Dean made a big show out of putting on clothes that were WAY too young for his age range, whether he could pull them off or not.  Matt had managed to bite back most of his smiles, but he hadn’t been able to hide that he was having a good time.  It warmed Dean’s heart to think about it.  Every day, they got through to Matt just a little bit more.  Hopefully it wouldn’t be too long before he would really begin opening up.
Dean’s fingers were working at the buttons on Castiel’s shirt.  “No one is home until Matt gets out of work tonight.”  Those green eyes looked up, meeting Cas’ gaze, and there was a heat in them that made Cas weak in the knees.  “And I have plenty of ideas on how to spend that time.”
Dean’s grin was abashed.  “You shouldn’t have expected anything less.”
Matt stared at him like a deer in the headlights.  Cas sat on Matt’s other side, rolling his eyes.  “Ignore him, Matt, he’s joking.”
Dean glanced at his husband as they walked.  Cas smiled at him.  Despite the anxiousness, Matt seemed to be fitting in well.  He moved smoothly through the crowded restaurant, his steps getting surer and more confident as he went.
“So are we!” Dean’s yell came from the living room.  Cas’ smile grew.  We.  Dean said ‘we’.  That meant Matt was still there.  He set his messenger bag down and headed into the living room, but stopped dead at what he saw, caught completely by surprise.
that?”
The boy was silent for a long time.  Finally, he answered.  “It’s just me.”
“They can.
This was honestly probably the most excited Castiel had yet been this trip, and it was all Dean could do to smother his laughter.  This did not go unnoticed by Cas, who threw him a not very convincing glare.  “Shut up.”
They had decided to go by rented car rather than train.  Both were a bit nervous about the wheel being on the right side of the car, since it was completely different than the US, added to driving on the left side of the road, but in the end, it seemed preferable to a long and uncomfortable train ride.
“You like it?”
Dean chuckled at the reaction.  “You wanna start planning tonight, babe?  For the trip?”  His voice was breathless, lips brushing Cas’ ear.
“It’s disgusting!”
“The pas de deux at the beginning of
“Is that…..are you working on a new book right now?”
Understanding came over Castiel’s face, and he nodded.  “Okay.”  He smiled.  “Still.  Little victories.”
Matt was watching him anxiously.  “Was that okay?”
Dean was sling-shot back in time to when he had first moved in with Ellen and Jo and how he had begun cooking dinner as a means of paying them back and showing his thanks for all they were doing for him and his brother.  His eyes burned with hot pinpricks of tears; he forced them back, nodding.  “That….that would be great.”  He cleared his throat.  “Do you need any help?”
Dean was overjoyed.  He wanted to hug Matt but wasn't sure if that would be too much too soon. "Can I hug you?"
“It’s okay,” Cas soothed.
Matt looked at him curiously.  “What?”
Dean shook his head.  “There’s a cot up there for him.  He had just been born when I first started teaching, so we used to keep a crib, then a little mattress as he got older.  It’s in the side room, so he doesn’t have to put up with all the music and talking.”
“Actually, I think we just came,” Cas murmured from behind him.  Dean’s head whipped about, and he stared at his husband with wide eyes.  Cas just smirked at him.  Dean cracked up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Matt had turned progressively pinker as Dean spoke.  His dark eyes had also gone wide and round in shock.  “
Cas laughed softly at the surprised excitement in Dean’s voice.  “Yup.  You want me to take your picture with it?”
Dean shook his head.  “Matt…..I don’t care.  I have all the dance space I could ever need up in the garage studio.  Believe me, I’d much rather you have a bedroom, and a place to store your clothes.”
“……Matt.”  It was Dean’s turn to be at a loss.  “Of course he does.  We all do.  Every one of us.”  Matt’s eyes were disbelieving.  It was painfully clear that he still didn’t think he was worth this kind of love.  Dean’s heart ached.  "Matt, Cas and I have told you before....you're a part of this family. As long as you want to be.  That hasn’t changed and it never will.  I swear to you."
Benny offered the Tupperware to Dean.  “Brought you a little something from the diner.”  Shortly after Chaz was born, Benny had finally managed to make his dream come true: he had opened his own restaurant.  Nothing fancy, more comfort food than anything else, but damn was it delicious.
Dean huffed a laugh.  “Get right to it, don’t you.”
Dean straightened up and moved to Matt’s side, placing his hands on the boy’s shoulders.  “Matt….you are welcome to stay here as long as you like.  I don’t want you out there selling yourself.”
Dean covered the mouthpiece with his hand and whispered to Jared “he called you a brat.”
“Yes.  Yes, I just……what’s all this about?”
She truly was a wonderful dancer, though unlike Dean, it hadn’t come naturally.  When Mary had first started, she had been a bumbling klutz.  But she had wanted to dance, and stubbornly stuck it out.  Her hard work had paid off.  Now dancing was a second nature.  No one would ever know she wasn’t a natural.
“YES, Cas.”
There were several more seconds of silence and Dean was worried that the teen wasn’t going to say a thing.  Then, Matt spoke up.  “…..Charlemagne called me his brother today.”
The record scratched as Dean reset the music for what was the……God, he had lost track of how many times they had stopped and restarted this routine.
“Hey!” Cas protested, but he got no further.  The front door opened as Dean returned.
He prepared Mary’s favorite bacon and hash browns, and some French toast.  Like him, she loathed eggs (much to the chagrin of Castiel, who loved them), but Dean made some anyway, for his husband, son, and Matt, in case the boy liked them.  If he had stayed.  Dean didn’t know if Matt was even there still, and he didn’t want to go downstairs to check and risk waking him up.  The kid deserved as much sleep as he could get.
Slowly but surely, they began to make progress.  Soon they were nearly out of the city and onto more remote roads.  Then Dean made another wrong turn and had to hit the brakes again.  “MOTHER
Dean took pity on the boy, coming to his side with a plate.  “I didn’t know what you like, so I put a little bit of everything on there.”
Sure enough, the boy was now approaching.  Dean slid out of his car and the boy faltered, obviously not expecting that, then he resumed his steps, meeting Dean halfway.  “Hey, there.”  His words were obviously meant to sound sultry, but his voice was shaking.  Dean would bet anything that this was the boy’s first time.  He prayed to God it was.  If he could save this boy the same way that Jody had saved him….
Claire only laughed.  “Hey, sometimes they know what they’re talking about.”
“Yup.”  Dean leaned in and kissed his husband.  “Now let’s go.  You have no clue how long I’ve dreamed of going here.”
Mary was smiling up at them.  “Have fun, Matt?”  She loved that Matt was dancing, though she was still frustrated that he wasn’t dancing with her and her classmates.  Matt nodded.
It was well after lunchtime by the time they were done with Nash’s House (it had belonged to Thomas Nash, the first husband of Shakespeare’s granddaughter, Elizabeth Hall) and the place upon which lay the remains of New Place, where Shakespeare spent his last years.  The cottage itself had been torn down by the last owner in attempt to stop all the visitors from hanging around, but an Elizabethan knot garden and topiary still marked the spot.
“She doesn’t have one?”  Castiel was surprised.
, was he looking forwards to that.
Dean and Matt were both seated on the floor, battling it out in
Cas sighed but he couldn’t help smiling.  “You’re ridiculous.”
Cas insistently pulled again.  “Come HERE!”
“Yet somehow she still hasn’t noticed.”
“He came home that night,” Dean continued, and smiled at the memory.  “It was hard to convince him to stay.”  He paused, amending the statement.  “I’m still fighting to get him to stay.  Though he’s agreed to for now.  He doesn’t want us paying for all his clothes and stuff, though.  Hence the job.”
“But it’d be such a waste…”
“Totally.”  Dean had wanted to experience high tea for as long as he could remember.  He grinned.  “Still can’t believe our waiter’s name was Fabio.”
Dean shook his head with a grin.  “Nope.”  He crawled into bed beside his husband.  “For now,” he added.  “He said he’ll stay for now.  But hey, I’ll take what I can get.”
“Yea.  I mean….gotta fill up that dresser, right?”
Castiel looked at his husband, so handsome in a dark suit of impeccable fit, a forest green tie that brought out the color of his eyes.  Dean was smiling, but there was a hint of anxiousness to it.  “Yes, Dean?”
Smiling, Dean leaned in and kissed her forehead.  “I love you, babygirl.”
“So is Cindy coming over tonight?”
The sound Mary let out when she saw her car could not be considered human.  “AN IMPALA????”
Dean pinched the boy’s nose.  “Good.”  He accepted his own light jacket from Cas and slipped into it.  “Everyone ready?”  Both Mary and Cas had their own jackets on; the group was all set.  “Great.  Let’s get going.”
Silence.  Cas looked pleadingly to Dean, silently begging for help.
Dean was silent for a moment, then shrugged.  “I’ll take that.”
Amazingly, she did as told.  Charlemagne went to bed without complaint, asleep practically before his head hit the pillow.  Matt had said goodnight as if it was second nature and headed right down to bed as though he did it every night, as though he were a regular member of the family.  It filled both men with happiness.
Grinning, Dean placed a light kiss to Cas’ lips.  “No help for you now, mister.”  He glanced over his right shoulder.  “Would you look at that.”
Matt flushed red. "Shut up," he mumbled.
Dean pulled his shirt over his head.  “Was driving home from the mall and I saw him on the side of the road.  He was hooking.”
The boy still looked uncertain.  “But I’ll be taking up more of your dance space.”
Matt returned quickly, and they were ready with their orders.  They all almost always ordered the same thing.  Not that it was surprising.  Dean got a bacon cheeseburger almost everywhere he went.  He was getting old enough that Castiel was beginning to pester him about it, reminding him that his cholesterol was going to be a major issue.  Dean was making an effort to listen and cut back on the cheeseburgers in general, but he would NEVER not order them at Ellen’s.  His majka made one hell of a bacon cheeseburger.
They were standing at their gate at Bradley International Airport.  It was two in the morning and thus amazing that any of them were awake at all.  No one among their group had ever been anything remotely close to what could be called a morning person.  Yet here they were.  Even Mary, Matt, and Charlemagne were there.  The eight year old was still half asleep but he had been insistent upon coming; he looked at his fathers, his sleepy eyes full of anxiousness.
“Well, I was wondering….do you think we might be able to find her somehow?  I mean I’m guessing there was a reason he left, so he probably couldn’t go live with her again, but if he could at least get in touch with her…..do you think he’d like that?”
“You do.  God, Cas.  More than anything.”  Dean pulled back and kissed Cas, soft and deep.  By the time Dean pulled away, Castiel’s head was spinning.  “So….”  Dean shifted so that he was stretched out beside Cas.  He rested his head on Castiel’s chest, then looked up at him, a smile in those big green eyes.  “Read to me?”
Dean pushed open the door, eyes immediately scanning the crowd.  Matt was nowhere in sight.  It didn’t mean anything (the boy had been training in all aspects of Roadhouse work) but Dean felt that immediate stirring of worry.  He always worried when he didn’t see Matt around, unable to help but be afraid that someday Matt would up and vanish.
help you.  I want you to move in here with us.  If you don’t want us to buy you things then let me help you find a job so you can help pay your way.  But at least move in here and off the street.  And know that if you can’t find a job, we’re more than willing to take care of you.  We WANT to take care of you.  And Matt?”  Still those dark eyes stared at Dean, so wary.  “There’s no shame in being taken care of.”
Dean’s response was to pounce onto the bed and right into Castiel’s lap.  “Get up!”  Cas laughed as Dean began poking at him, tickling him.
That elicited a charming laugh.  “A voracious reader, is he?”
Cas teased that third finger over Dean’s prostate and those hands released their grip on the pillow, flying to grip Castiel’s shoulders with bruising force.  “
Dean grinned.  “I bet it is.”  A thought occurred suddenly and a lightbulb may as well have appeared above his head, his eyes lit up that much.  “Oh!”
"Youthful sex appeal?" Cas echoed with a disbelieving laugh. "Oh, come on, Dean. Don't try to pretend you don't get hit on like, five times a week."
“On?”
‘Okay’ worked for Dean.
“Cas!  Cas!  CasCasCasCas!”
Matt had been with the family for a little over a month now, and things were going relatively smoothly.  He still had little bursts of anger now and then, which really didn’t surprise Dean.  He was fairly certain that Matt had ODD: oppositional defiant disorder.  It was a common problem among children who came from bad home situations, who suffered from neglect or abuse.  He still didn’t know much of Matt’s history but he
As before, Matt had been utterly caught up in the dancing, eyes wide as he watched.  He had been intensely focused even before the dancing had begun.  Dean had paid incredibly close attention as he pulled his shoes from his bag and yes, Matt’s eyes zeroed in on them immediately, his attention glued on the dance slippers as Dean pulled them on.  Dean was more and more certain by the minute that Matt wasn’t just interested in dance as a spectator but interested in learning to dance himself.
Dean was surprised.  “How did you….” But it wasn’t so hard to figure out.  “Majka.  Majka told you.”
, he was adorable.  “Yes?”
“That’s cuz Two slacked on dinner tonight.”  Cas ignored Dean’s indignant “hey!” and smiled down at his son.  “We’re ordering pizza.”  He looked around the room.  “Does everyone know what they want?”
,” Dean said this as though it should be totally obvious.  “Cuz it’s AWESOME.”
“Cas!”  He struggled to break free but it was hard with Cas tugging so insistently at his shirt.  “Cas….Cas, hold on a minute.”  He managed to pull away and spun to face Cas.  “Okay.”  He raised his arms and Cas happily pulled the shirt up and off, tossing it aside and moving in for yet another kiss, hands running greedily over the bared skin of Dean’s chest.  Dean sighed into Cas’ mouth at the sensation.  “
Dean’s entire face was glowing.  “
Cas pulled Dean closer, stroking his hair.  “Of course you couldn’t.  I’m glad you brought him here, baby.”
“I hate both of you.”
Dean shook his head in amused exasperation.  “Hey, Charlie.”
Dean turned off the TV and rose, offering Matt a hand up, holding his breath as he waited to see if the boy would accept.  He did.  It was such a little victory, but Dean would take it.  Any help that Matt accepted was a victory.
The girl looked slightly surprised but that was it.  Honestly, her reaction didn’t come as a surprise to either man.  Mary had always been extremely accepting.  Add that to her knowledge of her father’s past and it made sense that she would accept a homeless boy coming to live with them.
“Downstairs,” Castiel answered.  “To do your homework and watch your brother.”
And he did.  From there on, there were no more incidents, and the ride became much more relaxed.  They popped a cd into the player and sang along to the words, talking and laughing through the rest of their trip.  Still, despite being an easy trip, they were both relieved when they arrived.  Well….maybe Cas was relieved.  Dean immediately began practically bouncing off the walls in excitement.  Castiel was amazed he had remembered to put the car in park before jumping out of it.
Ellen’s brows shot up in surprise.  “Oh?”  But she offered a hand.  “Hello, Matt, I’m Ellen Harvelle.”
“No,” Dean answered.  Matt’s head whipped around to look at Dean, face stricken, and Dean grinned, one hand leaving the controller to point at the teen.  “He’s kicking my ass.”
Dean arched a brow at his brother, echoing “done good?”
The answer seemed good enough for Matt, explanation or no explanation, and he nodded.  “Okay.”
Matt jumped when he was spoken to, and flushed at being the center of attention, but Mary smiled at him, softly saying “stay,” and that seemed to do it.  He nodded.  “I….if it’s okay.”
“Everybody ready?”  Dean got a variety of answers in return.  He clapped his hands together with a smile.  “Then let’s go!”
,” he breathed.  He let go of his suitcase, the handle slipping through his fingers, and he moved to the center of the room, eyes focused on the ceiling above him.  “It’s
Castiel was completely bewildered.  When he had gotten home that afternoon, Mary and Matt were just getting Charlemagne into the car to take him over to Charlie’s and Bela’s for the night.  He barely had a moment to question this state of affairs before Dean was pushing him off to his closet to get changed for dinner.
Dean flushed, glaring at his husband. "Shut up.  It’s not like you’re much better."
Her mouth formed a tiny ‘o’ of remembrance.  “Oh yeah.”  Then she noticed Matt, smile lighting up her face.  “Hey, Matt!”
That surprised Dean.  “Really?  That came out before Mary was born.  We had just met her mother when I published it.”  He paused, head cocking as he considered Matt.  “How old are you?”
“Pervert.”
“I’m glad,” he replied softly, pulling back to look at Dean, to see those beautiful green eyes, to stroke his cheek before brushing his lips in a feather light kiss.  “I love you,” he murmured.
Cas nodded.  “I am.  Matt seems to be doing well, huh?”
Benny arched a brow.  “Would he.”
He had been incredibly aware of Matt the entire time they were dancing.  The boy was sitting with Benny off to one side of the room, not too far from the doorway.  For the most part the two were quiet, content to watch the dancing, but they had also talked quite a bit and were completely at ease together.  Dean was so happy to see them getting along.
Cas looked around, surprise registering on his face when he saw Matt there.  He smiled at his husband.  “Well, I don’t want to miss that….do I?”
Cindy, however, had no concerns about holding back.  She pulled Matt into a tight hug.  His eyes went wide, entire body stiffening, and Dean felt a surge of panic that Cindy was scaring the boy off.  But then Matt’s hands came up, hovering nervously near Cindy’s shoulders for a moment before awkwardly patting her on the back.  “Hello,” he managed.
Dean couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face, the joy filling him.  “Alright.  Well, then….you wanna go to the store today?”
She shook her head.  “Anytime.”
that??”
“And we don’t have museums here in the U.S?”  Those hazel eyes narrowed and Dean had to laugh.  “Kidding, I’m kidding!”
Sure enough, something lit up in Matt’s eyes.  “Yeah?  Really?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The two men had stopped in at their room for only a few minutes.  They had contemplated taking a nap to counteract the time-change, but both were too excited to sleep.  Instead they freshened up and headed out.  The hotel was only a few minutes’ walk from the Tate Modern.  That would be the first stop on the museum tour.  Their first stop in London.
Charlie turned to the two men with a smile.  “He’s great.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She groaned as she accepted her notes, head falling back.  “Nooo,” she whined.  “I don’t NEED notes.  I was perfect.”
Mary made a face.  “Oh God, it was gross.”  Dean cracked up.  “No, seriously.  Do you know how creepy it is hearing kids you know gush over your dad?”
“True.”  Dean wriggled a little.  “Better sooner than later.”
Cas nodded.  “I have.  And I’ve been thinking the same thing.”
Those beautiful blue eyes met his.  “Mm?”
Dean stared.  He couldn’t believe what he had just heard.  That was the most outgoing, boldest thing he had yet heard Matt say.  Just as if he felt at home here.
Dean smiled.  “Goodnight.”  And he headed upstairs with Cas.
Matt was bright red, but amazingly, he spoke up.  “I’ll start again if you join us.”
Immediately, Dean turned crimson, accusing eyes turning to Castiel.  “You told her about that???”
“No!”  The word burst forth.  “No, it just…..”  He seemed to be fumbling for words.  “…..I didn’t know what to say.  I didn’t realize he cared about me like that.”
They returned to the other room, Charlemagne’s hand in his.  Matt had joined the others now, looking shyly at Mary.
Sylvia is the real life owner of the Shakespeare and Company bookstore, and there is a black dog named Colette.  I tried not to include her too much because I hate fictionalizing real life people, but it is what it is.
is a romance?  They’re teenagers who know each other for like three days and behave like idiots and are responsible the death of pretty much everyone around them.”  He shook his head.  “No.  Fuck that.
The next morning, Matt woke up early, although neither Cas nor Dean was surprised.  Charlemagne had chosen to remind them last minute that he was supposed to have a permission slip signed for school so he could go on a field trip to the Mystic Aquarium.  A field trip that took place that day.  Unfortunately, he had no idea where he had PUT said permission slip.  Chaos ensued, both men tearing apart every room in the house as they searched for it.
Matt nodded.  “Okay.”
“Is that a yes?” Dean asked, when they had separated, a grin on his face.
Dean’s laughter echoed off the bathroom tiles.  “Right away, sir.”
Mary laughed at that.  Dean smiled.  “What.  What’s so funny.”
“Nope.”
actually came pretty fast, but
, you’re beautiful.”
If possible, that beautiful smile only grew.  “Better.”
Charlemagne, trying to help, picked up one of Castiel’s art cases and upended it, dumping pastels and charcoals all over the floor, much to Cas’ horror.  The poor man was not having a good morning.
“……honestly?”
“Yea, I’m horrible.”  He kissed the top of Mary’s head.  “Now get ready for bed.”
“Two novels, a book of poetry, and a play.”
This is a really short one and I apologize, but for the sake of splitting up the days properly, this is how it goes.  I hope you still enjoy it and I apologize again that it's been so long in coming.  Now that I've started I'm going to try to continue.  I love you all, and thank you for bearing with me and all my issues.  <3
The three teenagers came bounding down the hallway, Mary once again dragging Matt.  Not that he looked as if he minded.  It made Dean smile to see them.  Ever since they were little, Mary and Lauryn had always been like this, hand in hand, such energy.  Now they had made Matt a part of their group, and he really did look as if he belonged there.  As if he had
“You ready to go?”
“Don’t ‘hey’ me.” He plopped onto the barstool beside his brother.  “What’re you doing here?”
Cas gently poked his tummy.  “I think your belly says otherwise.
“Sir, huh?”
“Ew, gross, guys!”
Dean shut his laptop with a sigh.  He had gotten a great deal of writing done that day.  He wasn’t satisfied with what he had accomplished, but he rarely was.  Oh well.  Generally when he proofread, he liked it a lot better.  When he looked at his work with fresh eyes, everything would be different.
“Okay.  Well, how about we find you a job, then.  My mom owns a roadhouse.  We could talk to her this morning….see what she thinks about you waiting tables?”
“Your words, not mine.”
Matt looked around him at all the aisles of books, the desks of computers, almost as familiar to him as his own face.  He had always spent a great deal of time at the library.  When you were homeless, it was a good place to find some warmth and comfort.  He had buried himself in the books for hours.  It was there that he had discovered Dean’s novels, and fallen in love.
There was a pause, and when Matt spoke up again, his voice was hesitant.  “S’that because you grew up taking care of your brother?”
Dean peeked up at Cas from his place snuggled up under his chin.  “Really?”
“Damn straight I’m gonna take pictures for Mrs. Harrison.”
Dean rolled his eyes at Mary’s words.  “You said ‘half a minute’ ten minutes ago!”
Dean’s face lit up.  “Okay?”
“Yea.  Mom died and dad became pretty much the world’s biggest douche.  We moved at least once a year.  He was always drunk, never fed us.  I spent all my time hustling pool and…other things…so I could afford to feed and clothe Sammy.  Finally, my senior year of high school, he moved us here.  He had known Ellen in high school.”
“You’re such a jerk, One.”
Cas glanced at Matt.  Those dark eyes were huge as he stared at the girl, watched her twirl, her blonde hair like a soft golden cloud about her face.  Even after Mary had finished, Matt still stared at her with that look of utter awe, as if she were some rare creature, a goddess to be worshipped.  The other girls got up to dance one by one, and even though he watched them, Matt still couldn’t help but steal glances at Mary here and there.  Finally, she noticed his attentions and smiled at him.  He jumped when he was caught and turned bright red, but somehow managed a smile in return.  Cas had to bite his lip hard to hold back a smile of his own.  The boy was just too funny.
“Dean….Dean Winchester?”  Dean nodded.  “The Dean Winchester who wrote
“Hey!” Claire protested indignantly.  Matt stifled a laugh, which made Dean happy.  He had initially seemed legitimately troubled by the blonde.
“Because there are fantastic museums there.”
He walked with Matt to the top of the stairs, pausing.  “You still have everything you need down there?  The pajamas we gave you, the toothbrush?”  Matt nodded.  “Okay.  Well, if you need anything else, just let us know.  Our bedroom is down there.”  Dean pointed.  “That one at the end of the hall.”  He gave the boy a smile.  “Night.”
It wasn’t until after ten before Matt found his way upstairs.  Dean was sitting at the table, laptop in front of him, pouring over the latest pages of the novel he was currently working on.  He looked up when he heard Matt, and smiled.  The boy’s dark hair was a mess, standing up in all directions, and he was in his borrowed pajamas.  “Hey, Matt.”
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle.  Castiel was simply sitting there, smiling at him.  “What?  What’re you smiling at?”
“I’m serious.  Wake up and I’ll take a shower with you.”
Dean didn’t even seem to hear him, still staring at the blonde woman at the counter.  “You….you’re Sylvia.”
Thank you so much to all of you for all your kind notes!  I don't have a huge friend base here at home....most of my friends are online....so it really helps hearing from people.  You're the best.
“Do they take that long?”  Matt looked intrigued.  Dean gave another nod.
“I do.”  Cas’ expression turned somewhat wistful.  “Wish I could get a picture of you in front of actual marbles in Greece.”  He looked to Dean.  “Next trip?”
“You’re giving me jambalaya!”
“If she does, I’ve never seen it, and I’ve been in her office and at her house so many times that I think I would’ve by now.  But hey, why’re we still standing here?” Dean grabbed Cas’ hand.  “There’s history to explore!”
He glanced up to see a petite blonde woman smiling at him.  “She’s very friendly.”
Not ten minutes later they were out the door and on their way.  “So, what shows are playing?  Do you know?”  Dean looked about them in confusion.  “Why’ve we stopped?”
The flight was over twelve hours long.  Cas was incredibly impressed with Dean’s strength.  The man had clearly been incredibly distraught, but he had kept his fear under control.  For twelve hours.  Castiel couldn’t imagine what kind of mental fortitude and strength that took.
Mary shook her head.  “No.  My friend Matt.”
“You.  You’re laughing at me.”
Cas smiled softly.  “Reminded me of you when we were teenagers.”
“Far too long,” Cas agreed.  He ran his fingers absentmindedly through Dean’s hair, loving the way the soft fuzz tickled the palm of his hand.  Dean sighed happily at the feeling and Cas smiled.  “Of course, if SOMEONE was quieter, we could do this all the time.”
“Oh.” Dean bit his lower lip.  “You can’t really dance in shoes that are too big, you could turn an ankle or something.”  He pondered the matter for a moment, then shrugged.
“How old is he?  Six?”
“Oh, hey Matt.”  There.  Act casual.
“Thanks….for helping him out.  Really.”
Cas couldn’t help but smile at the pleased tone of Dean’s voice. “I know.  You’re still ridiculous.”
“Leave him alone, guys.” Cas’ voice was amused but he still took pity on the poor boy.  Dean grinned, looking at Matt.  The teen’s eyes were shooting all about the room, desperately searching for something to focus on.  Then they landed on Cas’ sketchpad and, startled, immediately zeroed in on the drawing of him with Chaz.  Wordlessly, he moved to it and picked it up.  Cas watched with bated breath, waiting nervously to see what the reaction would be.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled.  “Good morning, Matt.  Are you hungry?”  The boy nodded.  “Well, come this way and we’ll set you up with a plate.”
“Think it’s a good idea?”
“I’ve been thinking,” Cas spoke up.  Dean looked to him, brow cocked.
Cas arched a brow.  “What happened to making love?”
Dean glanced at Cas, and there was that smirk in his eyes that Cas had fallen in love with all those years ago. “Why Castiel, I have no idea what you could be talking about.”
Dean nodded.  “And my dad, really.  My mom died when I was four, giving birth to my brother.”
“Don’t I know it.”  They planned to see the Globe, Westminster Abbey, and the British Museum.  It was their last full day in London and they wanted to make the most of it.  He snuggled closer to Cas, stealing another kiss.  “I love you.”
Cas nodded as though that settled the matter.  “Okay, then.  Let’s clear it all up with Sam and Sarah.”
Castiel flopped down into his seat with a happy sigh.  “This is definitely the only way to fly.”  When Dean didn’t reply, Cas glanced his way, and was immediately taken aback at what he saw.  “Dean?  Dean, what’s wrong?”
Dean perked up.  “Okay?” he ventured.
Mary kissed his cheek, then bounced over to Cas, hugging him as well.  “You guys are AMAZING!  Thank you so much!”
Dean’s eyes were burning with tears.  He struggled to clear his throat.  “Well…..I don’t have any fancy words planned to say, since I didn’t even know this was happening until about ten minutes ago.”  He heard some chuckles from the people who had stopped to watch.  “But I can tell you this: you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.  Until you, I never knew what life could be, or real love.  You saved my life in more ways than I can ever express, and I love you more than I could ever tell you if I never stopped trying for the rest of my life.  Which I never will.  Because you deserve to know.  You mean the world to me, Cas, and you’ve given me a life I never thought was possible.  A home, the greatest children in the world, and more love than any man could ask for.  So today….”  He couldn’t remember the exact wording, but he had the gist of it.  “…today, I renew my vows to you.  I pledge my eternal love to you.  I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you, and to whatever else life brings us.”
Hopefully he would enjoy the surprise Cas had in store for him that evening.
In the end they decided just to get plain.  It was easier than splitting it all up.
“Ah…” Matt was completely at a loss, not wanting to be rude but unable to find the right words.  Besides, despite his complete inability to handle the attention, it was clear that he wasn’t completely immune to the flirtations, if the flush on his cheeks was anything to go by.  “That would be nice.”
“Hey!”  Dean ignored Mary’s laughter, smacking his husband’s shoulder.  “Don’t try and act like you’re not a dramatic bastard.”
Bela looked towards the sound of laughter that echoed from the kitchen.  “I hope that doesn’t get awkward.”
Cas smiled as he watched the two of them.  His fingers flew across the pages in his lap, charcoal sketching out the picture before him, capturing the moment forever.  If only Dean were here.
Cas chuckled.  “You getting riled up, baby?”  He teased his fingertips over Dean’s throat, making his way down to circle a nipple, delighting in the resulting gasp.
“Hi, babe.”  Dean leaned down to kiss his husband.  “How’s it going?”
But it didn’t look as though Matt had heard a word he’d said, and it was easy to see why.  He had spotted Mary, and his gaze was fixed on her.  His dark eyes were wide, his mouth slightly open as if in awe.
“You’re welcome.  Any friend of Dean’s is a friend of ours.”  Ellen turned to Dean.  “Any chance I could see you for a minute?  I’ve been having some trouble with one of the cabinets in the back.”
But Sam was speaking up, interrupting.
He really needn’t have bothered asking.  Matt nodded fervently.  “Yes.  That’s…..I’d love that.”
“My thoughts exactly.”  A thought occurred and Dean glanced at Matt.  “Hey, do you know if Claire is working tonight?”  Probably.  Ellen was grooming her to take over the business, so she worked there most nights.
“You?  An attitude problem?  I never would have guessed.”
”  He cursed a blue streak as horns began honking at him from all directions.
As she headed to the door to pick up her backpack, her eyes set on Matt.  “Matt!”  He blushed under the attention, as he always did, and she smiled at him.  “Are you gonna come back down to the house with us?”
“I hope so.  Is that okay with you?”
“Hey, this is the
Matt nodded.  “Sure.”  He sat down, still clearly ill at ease in a domestic situation, but he was better than he was yesterday.  It would definitely take a while before he fully adjusted.
Dean knocked once on the basement door and then gently opened it, poking his head inside.  “Matt?”
Dean nodded happily.  “Yea.”
I actually picked out 'Grease' before remembering the Sandra Dee thing, and then I remembered and lol'd.
“Finally?”
as drawn by John Tenniel.  As an avid reader and long-time lover of the book, Dean had flipped out when Cas had found the place.
Castiel turned in Dean's embrace until he was facing his husband, slipping his arms about Dean's neck and tugging him into a soft, deep kiss. When they separated, Dean was looking at him with wide eyes, clearly surprised by the change in mood. "What was that for?"
It was getting late.  They had put Charlemagne to bed hours ago (with QUITE a bit of difficulty….Cas had been right about the sugar), but it was past Mary’s bedtime.  They had given her some leeway considering it was her birthday and that she was spending time with Matt.  They wanted Matt to feel comfortable there, and Mary seemed not just to be humoring the boy but to honestly like him.  But even so, it was time for bed.
Dean had been rearranging the refrigerator to make room for the jambalaya.  Now he turned around, head tilting curiously.  “Money?”  Benny nodded.
“I remember.”  Cas still looked completely stunned.  “You….I can’t believe it.”  Dean opened his mouth to speak again but was silenced when Cas leaned in and kissed him soundly on the lips. It was long and deep and swept through him like a storm.  “You’re taking me to London,” Cas breathed, his eyes full of wonder.  Dean nodded.
“I definitely did.  Right when I saw you at that tag sale, I said Cas, this has to be the biggest dork you’ve ever seen in your life.”
I actually didn't choose an impala on purpose.  I began doing a search of 60s cars and when I saw that photo I instantly fell in love, and it happened to be an impala.
"No." Dean grinned.  Matt’s eyes were now intently focused on his laps, cheeks flushed.  Dean took pity on him.  “You want to go get some dance shoes?  Or do you want to borrow some of mine and make sure you like it before you buy some?”
“So?”  Dean looked to Sam.  His brother was still waiting expectantly.  “You gonna tell me?”
“If you keep being so distracting, I’m not gonna be able to focus on anything else.”
The other man stifled a laugh.  “Don’t forget to breathe, Dean.”
him.”  Jared smirked.
Dean was out of the car practically before it had stopped moving.  “Dean!” Cas cried out, startled.  But Dean hadn’t even registered the sound, too occupied with his nephew.
Dean felt an overwhelming sense of relief, of pride and love for his majka.  He looked for her, a smile on his face.  She saw him looking and met his gaze, smiling affectionately back at him.
“No, don’t be.”
“My dork of a brother is supposed to go on a field trip today and never got his permission slip signed,” she explained.  “And it’s missing.”
And an hour later, sitting out on their balcony with some dinner and a bottle of champagne as the lights glowed in the city below and the Eiffel Tower shone brilliantly before them, Cas had to agree.  It really was perfect.
Dean was already dressed.  While Dean may be better in the morning than Cas, he was by no means an early riser, but here he was, up and showered and wide-awake.
“Yea…..”oops”.”  Dean moved to the table and set down the wrinkled piece of paper, signing it with a flourish perfected at so many book signings.  “Okay, we’re all set.”  He handed it over to Cas.  “You guys better get going, before you’re late.”
“Hey, I said nothing.”
“YOUNGER brother, if you can believe it,” Dean said.  “Despite the ginormous moose body.”  Sam punched his shoulder again.  “OW!”  Dean rubbed the spot.  “Will you stop??”
“He gets along with the others?”
It was a lovely day…slightly overcast but with the sun peeping through the clouds just enough.  Cas pointed out a little side gully.  “How about we pull in over there?”  Dean cocked his head, quirking a brow.  He clearly knew Cas had something else up his sleeve but as always, he trusted Cas to make it good, and so he nodded, and they headed for the secluded spot.
“Is there a problem here, Johnathan?”  It was the first librarian, the woman who had signed them onto the computer.
They spent far too long in the gift shop, which was no surprise.  Dean found a bust of Shakespeare, just like he’d wanted to bring home for Mrs. Harrison.  They still hadn’t found anything that screamed Mary’s or Matt’s names, which was frustrating, but they knew that they would know it when they saw it, and there was still both France and Italy to look forward to.  They would find it.
“…..I have no clue what that means.”
She arched a brow.  “Published?”
“I figured as much.”  Matt made no response, his gaze returning to his plate.  “You do that often?”  Silence.  “Or was that the first time.”
Another girl joined their group.  She had chin-length black hair and green eyes, and her attention was completely on Mary.  She placed one hand on the girl’s shoulder, leaning in to ask “Mary, you’re coming to drama club today, right?”
over-indulge in tea.”
Dean hummed happily, fingers tapping on the wheel of the car as he drove home from the mall.  Tomorrow was Mary’s sixteenth birthday and he had promised Cas he would pick up a second gift for her….besides the car, that is.  But it had taken him a while to choose something, and that left him here, driving home at nine thirty at night. Since it was late March, it was still light out.  That made it more than easy to see the figure lurking in the alleyway a few streets from home.
Castiel’s face lit up.  “When can we eat?”
“I know you do.”  Cas removed his own coat and it joined Dean’s.  He went to work loosening his tie and yanked it free in one smooth motion.  He saw the heat move behind Dean’s eyes, and smiled.  “Well, what’re you waiting for?  Keep going.  I want it all off.”
“Matt’s going to be living with us,” Dean explained.  Immediately, Claire’s eyes narrowed.
“So what?”
Dean nodded.  “He substitutes sometimes.  Usually just for elementary schools, but every now and then a middle school or high school will need him.”
This is for my lovely Bekki.  There's something in here that only you will understand.  I hope you recognize it.  <3
When they reentered the main building, Claire and Matt were talking.  Dean felt a momentary stab of fear that Claire was giving him a hard time and that he would choose to leave. Then he heard their conversation.
Besides, it was damn cute when Dean geeked out like this.  And usually really sexy.
Castiel laughed breathlessly, squeezing Dean tightly in return.  “I just want to make you happy.”
Dean held Castiel’s hands in his, everything else around him forgotten as the other man spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You were supposed to clean them before practice tonight.”
“Dean, are you sure this is really a wise first stop to make?”
That only made Dean happier.  “That’s great.”
It was so wonderful to think of….the two of them, alone for two whole weeks.  And not just alone….alone in Europe!  He didn’t know how he would wait a whole month.
“Mm.”
Matt nodded, eyes wide as he looked around him.  Dean realized that the boy must be even more overwhelmed than he was.  He doubted Matt had ever been inside a high school.  He might be wrong, but he didn’t think so.
“Do you like records?”
'Coppelia' is a wonderful ballet.  The pas de deux at the beginning is so lovely.
That startled a laugh out of Matt; he shook his head.  “No.  I liked them.”
Matt was silent, emotion warring in his eyes, pride and desire versus the desperate need for help, for a family.  At last, he answered.  “Okay.”
Dean glanced over as he drove.  “What’s your name?”
Dean grabbed the remote and hit pause, ignoring Charlemagne’s tiny noise of disappointment.  “Hey Matt, c’mere.”
“Wonderful,” Dean finished.  Cas looked to him, smiling.
“Dean!”
, you have a filthy mouth tonight,” Cas commented.
Dean only laughed.  “Now I’m going to buy thirty-
Laughing, Dean gave Cas a shove.  “Well you don’t have to overdo it.”
A smile curved over the girl’s lips and she offered her hand to Matt.  “I’m Tessa.”
“Tch,
me.  Dean, too.”
So far, London was turning out to be everything they had ever dreamed of, and more.
Matt just looked at him silently.  Dean had no idea what the boy was thinking.  That expression was unreadable.  Then he spoke up.  “Well, shit.”
“I know, I meant to, I just—“ but Dean didn’t let her finish.
Castiel gave the envelope a gentle shake and two tickets slid into his hand.  He looked closely at them and then his eyes went huge and round, mouth falling open.  He looked up at Dean in utter shock.  “You…..London?  You’re taking me to
The two men had risen early for breakfast and had left to see the rest of the town before heading out.  Now they were walking hand in hand down the lane, taking in the sights on yet another beautiful morning.
Cas’ eyes widened in realization, mouth forming on ‘o’.  “I never thought of that,” he breathed.
Cas laughed breathlessly.  “My sentiments exactly.”  He lightly smacked Dean’s flank.  “Hey.  Get up here.”
“Castiel and Dean,” the priest spoke up, and Dean realized with a start that they hadn’t quite finished, “today you have renewed the vows you made to each other on your wedding day.  You have symbolized the renewal of the marriage union by the joining of hands and the taking of vows.  It is with pleasure that I conclude the ceremony of renewing the vows of marriage that joined you and forever binds you as husbands.  You may kiss!”
Peanut butter and bacon sandwiches are DELICIOUS.  And pickles and honey actually isn't bad.  It's not something I actively eat but my friend made me try it and it's okay.  But I make peanut butter and bacon all the time.
“But….you just got married—“
“NO!”  It was then that he noticed the bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice by the bed.  He stepped closer to look.  There was a card with it, a simple word of ‘
Dean was watching the exchange with some amusement.  He glanced at Cas only to see that his husband was in the same state.  Cas glanced at him with humor in those blue eyes.
“Don’t say such things!”
Cas shouldered his bag again.  “Well, then.”  He looked to Dean and Matt with a smile.  “Shall we go?”
“What.”  Dean looked at his husband.
Dean smiled.  “I love you, too.”
“I know, right?  I had no idea he cooked.”  Dean snuggled up close to his husband.
His husband rolled his eyes. “You’re so dramatic.”  He smiled.  “Gonna take pictures for Mrs. Harrison?”
She released him with a smile.  “So….you’re going to come watch us dance?”  He nodded.  “Fantastic!”
“That’s Colette.”
The excitement was plain to see on Cas’ face.  They didn’t have any big plans for their first day in France but it didn’t matter.  They would still be in France.  That was enough.
“Dean!”
So Dean had been right.  The two teens were about the same age.  “Not much older than Mary.  So you read it later, then.”
Cas felt a tiny tug on his shirtfront and looked down.  Charlemagne was gazing up at him with an imploring look in those big brown eyes.  “Can I come?” His voice was pleading.  Castiel ached to hear it.
“You.”  Dean gently set Chaz back on the floor, leaning down to talk to him.  “You got homework, Chaz?”  The little boy wrinkled up his nose in distaste but he nodded.  Dean chuckled, stroking his cheek.  “Better go do it, then.  Your sister will go with you.”  For he was positive that Mary had homework.
Dean shook his head.  “We’re not starting for another week.” He finally managed to snag a box of Honey Bunches of Oats from the top shelf and dropped it into the shopping cart with a noise of satisfaction.  “She and Benny just got home from the Cape, so they’re going to take a couple days to settle back into their routine.”
They got back to the hotel fairly late after the museum.  They had spent the last couple of days geeking out over Dean’s obsessions; Dean found it only fair to let Cas spend as much time as he wanted in the museum.  Still, despite only doing two things that day, they’d had a busy week and they were exhausted.  Instead of going out for dinner they simply ordered up room service and turned on the tv.
He shook his head.  “Not at all.”
Dean smiled.  “I love you, too.”
“I’d like to.  Neither of us have ever been and I know he’d love to go.  Especially to see all the art museums.”
“…..belaying pin?”  Cas’ tone was bemused.
“Yea.  It was his, too.”
It was the first time Dean had heard Matt’s full name.  He filed it away and pushed forward.  “I was thinking maybe he could work for you?”
The gift that Dean had picked up from the mall had been Castiel’s idea.  After hours of wandering, Dean had had to resort to calling Cas, desperate, and Cas had come through with a suggestion in a matter of seconds.  Mary had inherited the men’s love of records, and the gift was an app for the computer that hooked up to a turntable and would convert record tracks to sound files on your computer.
is a nice surprise.”
“Why do you work from home?”
“Oof.”  Dean practically collapsed into bed.  “I am
“Much.”  Dean nuzzled up beneath Castiel’s chin, kissing his jaw.  “Though I won’t be fully happy till I’ve got my feet on solid ground again.”
"Good.”  He smiled.  “Thanks.”
“It’s fine,” Dean reassured.  “Keep going.”
Dean tapped the butt of his pencil rapidly against the table as he thought.  If he had worked everything out correctly, they could go for two weeks.  They had the money, they could both make the time…..all they needed was someone to stay with the kids.  If they were only going to be gone for a day or two he would be fine with leaving Mary and Matt alone with Chaz, but not for two weeks.  But that length of time would allow them see London, France, Italy…..Cas would be so happy.
Guys, I'm back!  New chapter ahoy!
Cas stretched Dean open, watching the man come apart beneath him.  Dean was moaning and writhing on the mattress, and
“That sounds WONDERFUL.”  Cas sighed the words.  Dean chuckled.  He loved seeing Cas so happy.  He couldn’t wait till they were actually abroad.  “We can go to the Louvre?”
Mary had entered just in time to catch the end of those words and she peered over her father’s shoulder, immediately seeing the slippers in Matt’s hands.  “Oh my God!”  Matt immediately turned crimson.
“Ah ha!”  Dean held up the permission slip, triumphant.
“YES!”
The boy’s face was definitely red, but he nodded.
Even though they had known Charlie would love Matt, it still felt nice to hear.  Cas rose to his feet, stretching.  He had been sitting for a while now, and it felt good to stand.  “You’re staying for dinner, right?”
The music ended with a flourish and Dean couldn’t help but sigh with relief.  The studio may be air conditioned but it was summer, and it was still warm to be dancing.
took much longer.”
Castiel’s heart broke.  A glance at Dean told him that his husband was feeling the same.  Dean’s beautiful green eyes were glistening with tears; he brushed the back of his hand across his eyes to wipe them away.  “Of COURSE we’re letting you stay!”  Cas insisted.  “There was never any question about that!” Matt looked somewhat reassured, but still hesitant “What, did you think we were going to kick you out or something?”
“Oh, God.”  Cas’ voice was barely more than a whisper.  “You’re beautiful.  God, you’re so beautiful.”  His hand vanished from Dean’s cock and moments later he let out a moan.  Dean realized that Cas was licking his hand clean and a shiver went through him, his spent cock twitching at the knowledge.  A final thrust was all it took and Cas was burying himself deep inside Dean as he came.  Thoroughly exhausted, the two men collapsed together onto the bed.
Matt looked shocked by such an answer, amazed that this woman was being treated as a complete equal.  Slowly, a smile curved over his lips, the reply clearly pleasing him.
Dean gave his hand a squeeze and smiling, Cas joined in the song.  Everyone probably thought they were idiots, but he didn’t care.  Right here, at this moment, he didn’t think he could be any happier.
Cas watched them go with a smile on his face.  “Think it’s okay to leave them alone in there?”
“Two!”
Dean could feel it, too. He looked up at Cas, green eyes utterly lose.  “Cas,” he managed.  Cas kissed him.
“Oh, Chaz.”  He lifted the boy into his lap, kissing his forehead.  “No.  You’re going to stay home with Auntie Charlie and Auntie Bela, and Lauryn and Mary.”  He looked up, eyes meeting Matt’s, and he smiled.  “And your brother.”
.”  He grinned at Castiel’s laughter.  “Hey.  Don’t laugh at me.”
Another nod.  “Yea.  I needed a new pair.”  He pulled off his socks and tugged the slippers on.
“Oi.  Get in the boat.”
, back at their old table, only there was a fresh new vase of crimson roses on it.  Honestly, he was at a complete loss.
Dean somehow managed to stifle the laughter that tried to burst free, to hide it behind a façade of anger, nodding in agreement as his husband ordered “okay, young lady, go to your room.”
He wrapped his arms around Dean, who held him close, and the two men danced together in the rain beneath the moon on the warm Paris night.
“Then stop being ridiculous.  It’s already two hours past your bedtime.  And don’t try to pretend you’re not going to be up for at least another hour, reading by flashlight.”
These photos are all from my trip to London.  A lot of, if not all, of the stops they take will be ones I took, since I have similar interests.  And that hotel was AMAZING.  I am an Alice/Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) FANATIC.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “When you turn me into a pathetic pile of need, I get less poetic.”
“If it was over jambalaya?”  Dean grinned.  “Hell yea he would.  He loves it as much as I do.”
Matt sat on the couch, watching the two of them with a tiny smile on his face.  He had been watching the whole film with them but stayed seated when the dancing began.
Rolling his eyes, Cas gave her a tiny shove.  “Quit your bitching and go take a shower.”
At that, Matt was on his feet, chair screeching on the floor as he shoved it back.  He was looking down at Dean with anger in his eyes.  “I don’t need you buying me anything!  I can….I can take care of myself!”
Suddenly, it began to rain.  It was very light, just enough to patter against the cobble stones and to send the most uptight of vendors packing up their carts.
Dean glanced over his shoulder to where Matt was sitting at the table.  “Most nights, yea.  I’m better at it than Cas.”
After watching the couple interact, Matt was much more relaxed about the entire encounter.  He accepted Benny’s handshake with a tiny smile.  “You too.”
Cas laughed and leaned in to kiss Dean’s cheek.  “It’s a term for a certain era of painters.  Like how you have Impressionists or Surrealists.  Pre-Raphaelites are English artists who attempted to imitate the style of art in Italy in the time before Raphael.”
Cas had to laugh at the eager hopefulness in Dean’s voice.  “Of course we can.”
“Yes,” Cas sighed happily.  He looked to Dean, smiling.  “Hey.”  Dean turned to his husband with a question in his eyes; Cas caught his hand, pulling him to a stop.  Taking both of Dean’s hands in his, Cas smiled up at his husband.  “Thank you.  For all of this.”
“Yes!” both chimed in unison.  He just shook his head, grinning.
Dean had expected that.  He knew that getting Matt to admit he needed help was going to take a while.  “I know.”  He rose, moving around the table slowly, not wanting to anger Matt, to frighten him off.  “And if you don’t want us buying you anything, you can pay us back later.  Do chores around the house or something.  But you should have some more clothes. I really don’t want you back out there on the street, Matt.  And I know you don’t want that, either.”
“Hell yea, we do!”
The priest gestured, a smile on his face as he asked “shall we begin?”
Half an hour later found them sitting snuggled up together in a private capsule of the London Eye, each holding a steaming cup of tea as they gazed across the city.
Cas couldn’t help but smile at that face, stroking his son’s messy hair.  “It’s okay.”
“Yea.  I actually set it aside for a while and published a book of poems in the interim.”
“GUYS!  FOOD!”  This time it was Chaz, and he was yelling.
“Good.”  It looked as if that was all the girl wanted for she turned to go.  However, she caught sight of Matt and stopped.  “…..is this your brother, Mary?”
Mary chose that moment to reappear.  She was in her dance clothes, a leotard and leggings, all in black, with blue leg warmers that brought out the color of her eyes.
Cas had to fight to stifle his laughter, since he knew laughing when Dean was so upset was not likely to be helpful.  “I don’t know.”  He rubbed Dean’s back.  “We’re almost out of the city, though.  Just a bit further.  Do you want me to take over?”
The man was still regarding Dean as though he were crazy, but he set the red tickets aside and tore two of the yellow tickets off, exchanging them for the money Castiel held out. Dean snatched the tickets up with excitement and, grabbing Cas by the wrist, he dragged him off to the theatre.
It was hard not to laugh at the expression on Matt’s face.  Where Dean had expected immediate resistance, Matt only seemed surprised.  “
“It’s okay,” he murmured.  “You’re safe.”
“No.  No, I really didn’t.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile at that.  “I love you, majka.”
“Yeah!” Charlemagne piped up, seeming to have gotten a burst of courage.  “You listen to my brother!”
Dean turned to his daughter and her friend.  “Tell me how many kids hit on Cas today.”
Cas’ response was to pinch Dean’s butt….hard.  Dean yelped, jumping away.  “Hey!”  He rubbed the now sore spot, grumbling “jerk.”
Another nod.  “He’s a hard worker, too.  Picked up on everything faster than any other worker I’ve ever had.”
“Dean, you don’t have to—“ but even as he spoke, Castiel’s hips were unconsciously rocking upward, seeking Dean’s touch.  The blonde laughed.
Dean was insistent upon singing the song from the old Disney film ‘
“Yea.”  Dean wrapped an arm about his husband’s shoulders.  “Time for dinner, anyway.”
Cas shook his head with a smile as he headed into the back room.  Charlemagne was fast asleep on his little bed.  Cas crouched beside him, stroking his hair.  “Hey,” he said softly.  “Time to wake up, Chaz.”
Dean chuckled.  “Really.”
I just wanted to let everyone know that this piece is NOT abandoned. I suffer from depression and have been having a hard time lately so it's been difficult to write, but I'm working on it. I apologize for the delay.
The bathroom door opened and shut and Matt reappeared clad in his pajamas, dark hair wet and messy.  He smiled at Dean.  “Shower’s all yours.”
As the thoughts were ringing in his head, the front door opened and a flurry of voices greeted his ears.  Dean entered the room with Charlie at his side, both of them laughing.  Cas’ smile grew to see it.  “Hey, guys.”
“Yay!”  He leapt into his father’s arms, which he was really too big to do.  Dean let out an ‘oof’.  Cas shook his head with a smile.
“Vow renewal.” Cas corrected.
Matt was looking at him as though he were crazy.  “Of course it’s okay!  Dean…you don’t have to ask.  I’m just so happy for the lessons.”
If possible, he blushed even more.  “I’m sorry.  God, I must sound like a dork.  I’ve wanted to come here for years.”
That sobered her up, though she knew it was a completely idle threat.  “So he’s going to come live here?”
“He DOES seem to love it.”
“I know you do.  I just wasn’t sure how you’d feel about Lauryn staying with him.”  But Charlie brushed the concerns aside.
Matt didn’t even try to suppress his smile.  Johnathan glowered at him, but he didn’t get to for long, for the woman (Maria, her nametag read) was demanding his attention.  “Get back to work, Johnathan.”
Dean put two muffins on a plate, along with some bacon that he had been keeping warm, and returned to the table, setting the plate before Matt with a smile.  “Here you go.”
“Cas, this is Matt.  Matt, this is my husband, Cas.”
Matt nodded.  “Okay.”
“Sadly, the food isn’t as great as it’s been the past two days,” Dean said.  “Just plain old fruit and toast today.  But we’ve got different jams to put on it.  And butter, or peanut butter.”
“Hello.”  Dean looked the boy up and down.  “Are you hooking?”
Matt actually smiled at him, though it was small.  “Thanks.”
“It’s a
“Fuck, Dean!  Are you okay!?”
“Me too!  Me too!” Chaz piped up.  “I wanna help!”
“….what’re you doing?”
any more pathetically in love with each other?”
Dean nodded.  “Definitely.”  He looked at the object of Matt’s hesitance: a large dresser that the men had gotten secondhand from Ellen and Bobby and moved down to the basement for Matt to use.  Or rather, Dean and Matt had just moved it downstairs.  Dean’s shoulders ached from the heavy weight but Matt didn’t look winded at all.
Ellen’s face had fallen as Dean told the story, overcome by sadness.  She leaned in and gave Dean a kiss on the cheek.  “You’re such a good kid.”
As always when Mary smiled at him or touched him, Matt turned bright red, but he returned her smile and went with her and Lauryn into the kitchen.
A few seconds later, Dean bounced to his feet, fully nude.  “Yup!”  He kicked aside the messy pile of clothes and shoes.  Cas stared at him in disbelief and couldn’t help the burst of laughter.  “Oh, shut up.”
paraphernalia, and they had probably spent more money than necessary there.  Then it was a two hour ride back to London, where they promptly crashed.  It had been an incredibly busy 24 hours, and they still had a lot of vacation left to go.
Dean smiled.  “I love you, too.”
For her part, she took it in stride, smiling at him and giving a little wave.  “Hi.  I’m Mary.”
“I thought he had copyrighted the name.”
Cas leaned across the table to kiss his husband.  “It’s perfect.”
Mary and Charlemagne shouldered their book bags, the girl giving a smile to Matt, who returned it with a shy blush.  Dean handed them their lunches as they headed out the door, catching Cas by his shirtfront and tugging him in for a kiss.
Dean leaned in, a smile on his face, and brushed their lips together in a soft kiss.  “Morning, babe.”  He stroked his husband’s cheek, rough with a night’s growth of stubble.  “Looking forward to our first full day in London?”
“And he doesn’t have the internet at home?”  The man’s voice was cold.  Matt’s eyes narrowed.
The blonde simply shook his head and turned away to explore more.  “God help you if I find a belaying pin.”
Cas smiled up at him.  “Happy?”
Cas laughed.  “Okay, guys, let’s all leave Matt alone.”  Matt mouthed a grateful ‘thank you’ at Cas, and he smiled in return.
“Oh?  Friend?”  The word was stressed, and by the way the girl’s eyes lingered on Matt, it was fairly easy to guess why.  She thought Matt was attractive and wanted to know if he was single.
“That’s us.”  Dean looked to his family.  “We’ll see you in two weeks.”
Castiel shut the front door behind him with some relief.  Charlemagne was spending the night with Sam and Sarah, and Mary was having a sleepover with Lauryn.  Matt wouldn’t be home until the Roadhouse closed at 11.  Cas and Dean would have the house to themselves.  As much as he loved his children and truly liked Matt, it would be so nice to have a night alone.
Normally the thought of a fourteen year old putting “the fear of God” into an seventeen year old would be funny, but this was Jared.  He took after his father in almost every way possible, including his height.  At fourteen years, he was already almost as tall as both Castiel and Dean.  “No,” Castiel said, ignoring his husband’s laughter.  “You’re not.”
At that, the boy got EXTREMELY defensive.  “I don’t need looking after!”
There was another moment of hesitation.  “…..what size do you wear?”
Cas rolled his eyes but he scooted, sliding out of the booth so Dean could do the same.  Dean kissed his husband’s cheek.  “I’ll be back before dinner.”  And he headed off to the bar.
Castiel obeyed.  The instant he was naked, Dean pulled Cas to him, pressing their bodies flush together.  Cas wasn’t as patient.  He propelled Dean backwards as they kissed until the backs of the man’s knees hit the bed and sent Dean tumbling onto the mattress, laughing the whole way.  There wasn’t a moment’s pause before Cas was following, kissing Dean as he pinned his wrists down.  Dean made a pleased noise at the show of force, arching up against Cas.  He loved it when the man got all dominant.
“You should pose with them.  You know.  Since you’re a Greek god and all.”
Charlemagne nodded solemnly.  “I promise.”
Dean cracked up; he knew he shouldn't but he couldn't help it. "No!" he managed. "Why would you ask that? I don't wear tights, do I?"
“Mm….I do.”  Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair as the blonde settled on the bed with him.
“Just for a moment.”  He gently tugged at Dean’s hand, greatly enjoying the confusion on his face, but Dean let himself be pulled along.  Once inside, however, the interior caught Dean’s attention and he began to look around in wonder, eyes wide at the beauty of it all.  Cas leaned in and gently kissed his cheek.  “You look around.  I’ll be right back.”
Her attention made him blush.  “Your dad took me shopping.”  He tugged anxiously at his shirt.
Dean nodded.  “Me too.”  He smiled.  “I can’t believe he goaded Mary into helping.”
Laughing, Dean obliged.  “Bossy.”
Dean smiled, brushing a lock of that messy brown hair back from Cas’ forehead.  “I love you, too.”
Dean’s head fell back and he let out a groan of pure pleasure.  “Oh my God you’re the best.  Marry me, Benny.”
Then they got inside and green eyes widened in shock.  There on the wall was a painting he knew all too well.  “Salvador Dali!”
Dean grinned.  “Better get one for Charlie, too, or she’d never forgive me.”
On the other hand, Matt also occasionally sank into long bouts of silence.  It would often happen after one of the angry flare-ups.  As soon as the anger started it would end, and Matt would fall into sullen silence.  But sometimes that silence would turn into a deep, empty hole, seemingly bottomless.  If you looked into his eyes, there was nothing there…..a hollow expression, emptiness.  Dean knew that look.  That was a look of complete and utter despair.  Matt was depressed, Dean was sure of it.  He just didn’t know how to broach the topic without upsetting Matt even further and pushing him away.  So for now he would simply keep a close eye on the boy, make certain he wasn’t going to hurt himself in any way, and hopefully soon Matt would feel comfortable enough that Dean could talk to him about these things.  If Matt needed to see a therapist, or be on medication, or both, Dean wanted to help.
I'm so sorry this has taken almost a year to update.  I still haven't come to terms with losing my dad because I have disassociative seizures and if I think of him I seizure so I really can't think of him.  It's hard, and that's made it almost impossible to do anything.
“Mmm,” Cas stroked Dean’s cheek.  “The image
“Hi.”  Dean smiled.  “I’m gonna be heading to the studio in a little bit.  My friends Cindy and Benny are coming by.  Cindy has been my dance partner since college and we like to get together when we have a chance, just for fun.  I didn’t know if you might like to come.”
I want to apologize for and explain my long absence. I was in the hospital. I suffer from depression and had reached the point where I was beginning to cut again and didn't know if I could hold out any longer, really suicidal, so I committed myself. I made some amazing friends and we all worked through things together, and I got out in time for gishwhes.
They never did get around to dancing that night.  They DID get Matt’s shoes, a process which didn’t take long at all, and when they got home, Dean showed Matt how to place and attach the ribbons.  It was then that the others got home.  Cas lit up when he saw that Dean had spoken to Matt and that the boy had indeed wanted to dance.
“We know that Matt lived in at least one foster home before now.”
They lay wrapped together in bed, breath coming heavily.  The window was open, a warm summer breeze rifling the curtain and carrying with it the sweet scent of freshly cut grass.
I'll be writing again soon. I'm just taking my time to get back into the swing of things. I just wanted you all to know that I haven't abandoned you, or this piece. <3
“You’re such a pain in the ass.”
“But….you want to go too, right?”
Cas kissed his way down Dean’s throat, pausing here and there to gently nip the flesh.  When he reached the planes of Dean’s chest, he let his tongue flick across a nipple.
“Lunch?”  Dean checked his watch.  “Oh, shit, it’s almost three!  I’m so sorry!”
Cas nodded.  “You’re a like a five year old.”
Those deep blue eyes lit up.  “You….
“Yea, well Two doesn’t feel like cooking tonight.”
“He’s eight.”
He could see the lingering hesitation, the unwillingness to trust a stranger, and he completely understood those feelings.  Still, after a moment, the boy nodded and followed Dean into the car.
, he was beautiful.
“I’ll give you a heads-up,” Dean continued.  "He’s a lot like me at his age.  Meaning he’s got a bit of an attitude.”
Cas gave him a look of mock surprise.  “Me?”
Matt looked unsure.  He turned his attention to Dean, who shrugged.  “It’s up to you,” the man answered.  “You’re welcome to stay and keep watching, but we won’t be offended if you go.”
Well, now he had somewhere, if Dean had any say in the matter.
,” Dean filled in.  With a nod, Cas began to play.
Castiel wasn’t sure what had Dean so shocked, but he was too distracted by the stack of books in his arms to even think about it.  “Oh my God, Dean, how many books
God, it felt good.  Dean would never tire of this, feeling Cas’ fingers in him, buried deep, stretching him open.  His fingers tightened around the pillow beneath his head.  Cas glanced up at him.
Claire accepted, shaking it.  “I’m Claire.”
“Right behind you.”  And Dean smacked Cas’ ass.  For a split second he felt horror overcome him.  For that second, that brief second, he had completely forgotten Matt was there.  Had he gone too far?  Would Matt be put off by what he had just seen?
(See the end of the chapter for
Matt had been watching all of this very quietly.  Dean was worried that maybe it was pushing him away.  After all, who knows when he was last given a gift, if he ever was.  But then Mary was looking at the boy with a smile.
“I can’t believe someone would
Matt was staying.  He had been there for two months.  Telling him that Matt was staying would seem a little redundant to the eight year old.  So Cas skipped over that part.  "Matt's your brother."
“Shut up.  I haven’t seen you in a while.”
Hope you're still enjoying it!  I can't guarantee how quickly it will be uploaded, but I'll do my best!^^  <3
“Yea.”  Dean gently punched Mary’s shoulder.  “Chaz has been ready for over half an hour.”
Cas’ eyes roved over what they had chosen as their first place in France to visit:
idea.”
I have recently been suffering MAJOR computer issues. I bought a new one last January only to have it break a few months ago and delete all of my works. You can imagine the heart attack THAT gave me. It deleted absolutely EVERYTHING. Luckily they managed to restore most of it, but it promptly deleted it all again (luckily after I had saved it to a usb drive), so I had to buy a new one, but this one keeps fritzing as well. So I apologize for any and all delays. I have no idea what’s going on. Technology hates me. 😭😭😭
“What??”  Dean was horrified.  “NO!  Give us
Cas smiled.  “I’m certain you’ll recognize many of them.”  Blue eyes widened and he pointed.  “Look!”
Dinner had been wonderful.  Charlie’s exuberance hadn’t put Matt off in the slightest (something both men had been a bit concerned about).  Rather, the two had hit it off splendidly, bonding over a love of games, and after dinner, sat down to battle it out in
The two showered together, despite the relatively small size of the shower, giggling as though they were teenagers again.  Dean was unsurprised but delighted to find that the hotel’s restaurant served tea with breakfast.  He would wager that most places served tea with all meals.
Matt jumped at being caught.  “I didn’t….I just…”
That excitement quickly faded behind a carefully practiced façade of nonchalance, and Matt shrugged.  “I guess that’d be cool.”
Cas wrapped an arm around his husband’s neck, pulling him into a slow, deep kiss.  It was at risk of quickly developing into more but they were interrupted by a knock on the door.
~tbc~
By the look on Matt’s face, the different last name clearly registered, but he didn’t ask questions.  “Hello, ma’am.  I’m Matt Hunter.”
Dean sat beside him.  “Do you eat eggs?”  Matt opened his mouth to answer but Dean wasn’t done.  “Careful, this is a test.”
It was cumbersome to drag their luggage through the hallways into the dining area, but it was well worth it to see the way Dean’s face lit up when he saw the beautiful artwork.  “
“Of course I did!  Just not at the same time.  We don’t do that often.”
“Yeah,” he agreed.  “Wonderful.”
Dean wasn’t the least bit surprised by the booth they were lead to.  It was the one they usually sat at.  He slid into the booth, Cas joining him and their children sitting opposite.  Matt gave each of them a menu and pulled a notepad out of his back pocket.  “Can I get you some drinks?”  His tone was all business, and Dean had to fight to suppress a smile.  He wrote down their orders with the same professionalism, and retreated to the kitchen.
“You’d better bring me back a gift.”
“Good.”  With that, he headed over to look through the shelves.  He found several books that sounded interesting.  Maybe he could take them out under Charlemagne’s card.  A few shelves in, he stumbled across
Chaz came up to Matt, looking anxiously up at him.  “Matt?”
Dean and Matt had headed straight from the Roadhouse to the store to find something for dinner.  With quite a bit of prodding, Dean had managed to get Matt to give up his favorite meals.  Now they were back home, Dean putting the finishing touches on some hamburgers.  Cas would be happy about that.
“You’re
“Sit.  I’ll get you some breakfast.”
“Hey, don’t knock it till you tried it.  They’re freaking awesome.”  Matt just wrinkled his nose and Dean laughed.  “Hey, at least I’m not as bad as Mary.  She likes pickles and honey.”
“Good.”  Cas leaned down to give him a soft kiss.
Dean gave his head a tight shake.  “Don’t like flying.”
“….wow,” Dean said at last.  “Did they all think we were actual newlyweds or are people in this part of the country just really nice?”
Dean nodded, smiling back.  “Yea.  I’ll take any victory we can get.”
Cas cupped Dean’s face and pulled him into a deep kiss, the applause of the onlookers no more than a dim buzzing in the background.  He pulled away just far enough to lean his forehead against Dean’s.  “I love you,” he whispered.
“Guys?”  It was Mary.  “Dinner.”
Sure enough, Dean was a mess, practically mewling as he clutched at the sheets.  Then Cas reached around and took his cock in hand and it was just too much for him.  It had been too long since they’d had the time to do anything more than exchange handjobs or blowjobs.  This was a sensation overload.  He came with a cry of Castiel’s name, holding nothing back.  He didn’t need to…..not when none of the kids were home.
