Pepper nods her head as she dials Rhodey.
Steve drains his glass before he nods in agreement. “Damn right we did. It’s been a hell of a week.”
Almost as if she knows, or has an inkling, of Steve’s more-than-platonic feelings for the man currently standing a little too close next to him. Not that Steve’s complaining.
Tony glances at him, and there’s a softness in his brown eyes that the super soldier discerns when he aims an equally soft smile at Steve. The pressing weight in his chest suddenly gives way to a fluttery feeling, and he willfully ignores the keen gazes of Natasha and Bruce as he returns Tony’s smile with one of his own.
he thinks fondly), hyperaware of Steve’s taller form two steps behind him.
He looks back at Tony and blinks at the odd expression on the man’s face.
Evidently, the rest sees the emotions playing wildly over Tony’s face, and they immediately turn somber. Even Clint looks ashamed just then.
“That… huh. That actually makes sense, Thor. Well, theoretically anyway. But without more concrete data and evidence, I’m afraid this is as far as we got.”
Tony looks up at Steve, who feels his heart stutter in his chest at the warmth-filled gaze.
Tony gulps.
Whoa, okay. That sounded a lot dirtier than Tony intended, but thankfully the accidental innuendo goes unnoticed by Steve. Instead, the super soldier blinks in surprise before he eyes Tony with a heartfelt look.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve utters quietly as he swipes the towel across Tony’s neck. Tony, as if he heard the super soldier, whimpers pitifully and leans on Steve’s other hand that’s still softly stroking the engineer’s hair. Steve’s chest tightens on the unconscious gesture, and before he can think twice, he leans over Tony’s face to kiss the man’s brow. “It’s okay, Tony. I’m here. We’re all here. You’re going to be okay.”
“… Wow. Really? Silence is your answer? Unbe-
Tony shuffles out of the elevator and into the common area. He blearily makes his way towards the kitchen, eyes half-open and swallowing past the dryness in his throat as he wets his chapped lips. There’s an insistent pounding in his head, and the engineer groans and swears under his breath when his temples throb. This is the worst hangover he’s had in a while, which is saying
“That does not bode well,” Thor imparts.
. At least, maybe, give him the benefit of the doubt?”
“What is it, friend Tony?” Thor’s booming voice comes next.
because God knows how much Tony detests those kind of statements. Gives the engineer the hives and all that.
That’s perfectly fine with him. Unless he decides to cut this hide and seek game short and Tony goes home an hour earlier than planned.
Natasha, the super spy that she is, peers at Pepper with a calculating look.
that I’m worthy, and she wanted me to be aware of that.”
Oh, right. They didn’t know. None of them did, except for Thor, obviously.
He’s not completely sure why he decided to go up here in the first place, but Tony has a gut feeling that this is where he’s supposed to be. As to why, he can’t say — it’s not like his teammates care about him, anyway. Though their concern is touching, Tony can’t bring himself to think that it’s genuine concern for
As they start to load their plates with roasted chicken, baked potatoes, and quinoa salad, Steve’s attention soon turns to the lively conversation of Thor recounting the best feasts he’s had in Asgard. He loses himself in the Asgardian’s exuberant storytelling, laughing along with the others as Steve momentarily forgets about Tony’s offhanded comment.
Steve coughs at the declaration and mutters “Bullshit”, but he smiles innocently when Tony shoots him a dirty look.
Dumping the empty saucepan in the sink, Steve slides a mug towards Tony, remembering the latter’s aversion to being handed things. That gesture doesn’t go past Tony, who picks up the mug with a small smile of gratitude towards Steve as he mumbles his thanks. Smiling back, Steve picks up his own mug and blows on the surface before taking a small sip. Inhaling the sweet, rich scent of the cocoa, Steve finds himself closing his eyes in bliss before taking a longer sip of his drink.
Tony hums in response, still too lost in his thoughts that he doesn’t register the voice speaking from behind him.
Sorry, can’t resist. Sleeping now.
Everyone misses you, too. But don’t tell Clint I told you that.
The man in question, dressed in his usual double-breasted suit, warmly replies with a, “Hello, sir.”
Tony opens his eyes to grin roguishly at the redhead. “Who says it was a party I was at?”
“What— now?”
“Oh, wow. Tony, are you—”
As he dozes off, he vaguely senses Steve shift his head before he feels soft lips press gently on the crown of his head.
“Oh my god,” she distantly hears Clint. “
It’s Natasha who answers, much to Steve’s surprise. “He’s not a walk in the park, but we’re all working together to make it work, Pepper. I know it’s hard to believe right now, and honestly I’m partly to blame for this because of my initial review of him all those years ago for The Avengers Initiative, but I do care about Tony. We all do.”
His eyes are downcast, staring aimlessly at the plush carpeted floor of his penthouse suite, so he doesn’t see the genuine look of shock that crosses over Pepper’s face at that statement.
As they begin to walk towards the same direction the engineer was walking on earlier, Tony wonders if he’ll remember any of this when he wakes up.
‘cos from what I can see, there are about two dozen of those shitholes coming at Nat.”
“Tony,” Steve groans to himself, drawing out the last syllable as he thumps his head at the back of the couch.
“Tony, the doctor’s orders were to take it easy for the next few days. You shouldn’t be working in this state.”
The second warship goes down fifteen seconds later, Tony hollering in delight at the success.
Nope, no nightmare. I was just inspired to draw.
?” Clint exclaims with an incredulous look aimed at the Norse god. “Thor, ‘disturbing’ is you eating a minimum of two boxes of pop tarts a day. A
“Works like a charm every time,” Tony pronounces, pleased at the result as always.
“Is it morning already? What time’s it?” He asks, and Clint takes in the exhausted lines across Tony’s sleep-deprived face.
Now, Bruce already expected it, what with Clint’s detailed recollection of the first time it happened. Regardless of his body language that screams ‘uncomfortable’, the sight of Tony holding Mjölnir doesn’t fail to bring a smile to Bruce’s face.
Tony turns to look at her, brows raised.
“Oh boy,” Natasha murmurs.
“What does, Tony?” He hears Bruce quietly ask on his right, and it’s then Tony registers the physicist’s hand on his shoulder.
A sense of belonging.
But Tony’s already fast asleep, his body curled up into a ball in the middle of the bed and arms wrapped tight around his torso, an unconscious gesture of shielding his arc reactor. From what, the engineer doesn’t know.
. I didn’t— it’s just. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, honey—”
look before she carries on with her own business.
“Tony?” Steve repeats, this time in a quieter voice as he gently sets his hands on the man’s arms. In the back of his mind, Steve realizes how intimate this must look like to a third party. It’s the middle of the night and here he is, standing in close proximity to another man in the dark-lit common area. But all Steve can think of in that moment is to take Tony into his arms. Tony, whom he realizes is shivering despite being buried in thick layers of clothing. He has hidden it so well that even

Pepper smiles at him again. “Steve’s going to love whatever it is you’ve planned to perform for him, Tony. Don’t overthink it, okay?”

Unsurprisingly, his AI picks up on it, for he says in a warm tone, “It’s my pleasure, sir.”
Without a second thought, Steve ducks down to kiss the corner of Tony’s mouth. He hears Tony's sudden intake of breath, and Steve glances up in time to see Tony's eyes fluttering shut. Endeared, Steve can't help but gently nuzzle his nose against Tony's before he pulls away.
that he deems worthy enough to give to Steve.
“Steve,” Tony starts with a pained grimace. The absence of his signature goatee makes him look so much younger, and Steve wonders if his cheeks are as soft as it looks. “Pep…” His eyes glance at the CEO, who’s standing a few feet from Steve and wearing a concerned expression on her face. Tony licks his lips, which—
will come, Tony doesn’t bother to give her a response, only to roll his eyes and carry on with their training. Just the mere thought of it is laughable, really.
the sentient war-hammer agrees.
It takes a few more moments of tense silence before Tony graces them with a reply.
“I wasn’t aware you were teaching me a lesson in the first place. Care to enlighten me,
While all this is happening, Thor is opening his third box of pizza, unaware of the silent conversations taking place around the Norse god.
It’s Tony’s turn to sigh. Not knowing what else to say, he shakes his head and shrugs as he looks away from Pepper’s gaze.
Enjoy!
“JARVIS,” Steve quietly calls out.
“That, I assure you, am perfectly aware of,” answers Jarvis after a long period of silence has passed. Well, long enough for Tony to calm down enough from his tirade, the genius engineer looking at the face of the man who once loved and cared for him like his own with a mixture of uncertainty and sorrow.
“They are currently in the common living area, sir. Do you wish me to call Dr. Banner?”
After giving Tony painkillers for his still tender ribs, and then leaving the room to allow the engineer to rest, the rest of the team congregates to the communal living room, where they finally chose to verbalize their thoughts of what they just witnessed earlier. To say that Steve was concerned about the sudden turn of events in regards to one genius billionaire would be an understatement.
He opens the door then steps out gingerly. It takes sixteen steps to make it to the elevator, and Tony steps inside to JARVIS saying:
“Hope you know what you’re doing, Cap.”
. You, Tony Stark, are valued. And I hope that one day you’ll see yourself the way I see you.”
, by his side. Tony has their friendship and support, and it’s then he realized he’s never felt this assured in his life.
Just as Tony executes a somersault to avoid another blast of the energy-based guns, he sees the quinjet approaching and a familiar figure dressed in red, white and blue free falling, the sound of Steve whooping in delight clear over the comms.
Steve blinks, the cogs of his brain turning as he also recalls that day vividly.
Thor responds with sorrow.
Three more days and you’ll be back. 😊
Tony, the gracious host that he is, mingled with all of their guests first for the first hour. When Steve finally made his entrance (Tony and the others made sure to get the point across that the birthday celebrant must be fashionably late,
“Uh…”
As he slowly loses consciousness, the last thing Tony remembers is Steve, awe and concern warring over his bright blue eyes as he continues to hold Tony in his arms, a beatific smile on his grimy but beautiful face.
— that you haven’t eaten in twenty-six hours, you’ve no choice but to join us.”
The bespectacled man rolls his eyes. “Don’t let Nat hear you say that.”
Steve surmised that there’s still a silver lining to their current situation. Following Tony’s emotional breakdown, it’s like a barrier has been lifted that was separating the engineer from the rest of the team. Granted, Tony’s still acting his unusual self since he woke up, but he’s been a bit more open to them. Not in an atypical way that would send alarm bells ringing in Steve’s head. Just that after they comforted the engineer, Steve had the feeling that they passed some sort of test. And having passed that test led to Tony warming up to them.
“Sir spent the afternoon at Pier 45,” JARVIS informs them, surprising everyone. “He is currently on his way back to the Tower.”
It’s pretty fucked up, it’s what it is, and that’s why Natasha is doing her best to do right by Tony, in any way she can.
Well, he certainly deserved that, Tony thinks with another wince.
Bleurgh.
“Sir,” JARVIS acknowledges with a lilt in his voice. “Ms. Potts is with Captain and the others at the common area.”
“What do you mean?” Bruce asks with a slight tilt of his head at the super soldier.
), Steve licks his lips and offers Tony a lopsided smile.
“Tony?” Steve repeats once Tony has drained his glass and hands it with a timid smile at Natasha. Alarm bells start to ring in Steve’s head when he sees the smile, and he ignores Natasha’s baffled expression to focus solely on Tony. The engineer turns his head to meet his eyes, and it’s through sheer force of will that Steve doesn’t recoil at the
It takes half a second before his AI draws to the same conclusion as Tony did.
Once he’s inside his room, the super soldier quickly strips down until he’s naked before he climbs into his bed and gets under the covers. Lying on his back with his arms raised and hands curled under his head, Steve sighs heavily and then stares aimlessly at the dark ceiling as he goes over the events that occurred that evening.
“Come now, you must be longing to know as well. For science,” he adds, beaming widely.
Mjölnir. Like I’m gonna use her in a fight when I got my suit.”
“You guys really aren’t mad?” Tony whispers, curious, his hushed tone meant only for the super soldier’s ears.
Swallowing past the lump in his throat, Steve tightens his grip on Tony’s hand when the other man tries to pull his hand away. Meeting Tony’s eyes that’s full of regret, Steve takes a deep breath and allows himself a few seconds to gather his thoughts before he speaks.
Ha. Famous last words.
Steve blinks, and his smile widens a fraction. Before his brain can catch up, he finds himself bringing a hand up to cup Tony’s jaw, thumb stroking his cheekbone. He was right: it
? How can you even— okay, you know what? Never mind. Let’s change the topic.”
“Don’t stop believing, hold on to that feeling!” Clint belts out exuberantly into the microphone as he dances on the small stage with abandon, his tenor voice drowning out the others’ as they sang along.
“We’re doing our best to help accommodate Tony and his needs,” Steve answers earnestly. “Pepper, please believe me when I say that we all have his best interests at heart. We want the old Tony back just as much as you do.”
Steve just stares at Tony, and Natasha and Bruce trade looks before they look back at the engineer. From the kitchen, Clint and Thor remain silent.
Pepper snorts. “You have to admit, as far as reckless stunts go, this is one of his tamest. Easily a Level 3.”
“We are right where you are,” is Jarvis’ cryptic response, the corner of his mouth quirked upwards.
He’s done with the pining, to be honest. Sooner or later, Steve will find out that Tony has feelings for him, and Tony would rather have said feelings be revealed under his own terms. Granted, he knows Captain Righteous is bisexual himself, having confessed to Tony a long time ago that he used to have a thing for his best friend Bucky when they were in their teens. Of course, Steve hasn’t dated much — or at all, frankly speaking — since he woke up, but that is of his own volition, rather than a lack of prospects.
Steve nods with a smile. “Yeah, just like that. But really, I just love hot cocoa.”
his ass to the beat is making Steve think of really
So swallowing past the tightness in his throat, Tony manages to croak out, “I’m sorry.”
Like, what even.
“I don’t know about that, Steve,” Natasha interjects, doubt in her tone.
“It’s fine, Clint. I forgive you,” Tony uttered with a small, sad smile as he looked at the archer. “Thanks for, uh, apologizing. Not many people have shown that much consideration for my feelings before, so. Um. Thanks.”
And besides, Pepper made the right choice. After all, they’re okay now — hell, more than okay, they’re fucking great — and somehow their friendship only seemed to solidify after their failed relationship. Pretty crazy how life works like that, huh?
When Tony’s head is nestled comfortably once more on Steve’s shoulder, the super soldier selfishly allows himself this moment and rests his head on top of Tony’s, nose brushing lightly against the dark brown locks.
Edwin Jarvis releases a long-suffering sigh, but there’s a fond smile on his face and Tony’s heart twinges in sorrow.
“Hmm pretty much,” Tony utters instead, and Steve almost exhales in relief. “A coming-of-age movie, filled with late night road trips and perfect sunrises featuring a feel-good soundtrack. Basically the kind of movie that Clint hates but deep down it makes him curl up into a ball and cry like a baby.”
Tony dealing with the press, let alone the paparazzi, in his current condition. It’s for the best that he remains here in the Tower until we get more answers
me as I am, and deemed me worthy. Not just the ability to lift her, but —” Tony falters for a second, and Bruce sees him swallow inaudibly before he forces the rest of the words out, “— but in general. She
“He has a point,” Bruce addresses Steve.
“Welcome to the twenty-first century, Cap,” Clint says with a smirk. “You’d be surprised that you’re not the only one who doesn’t know how to make friends.”
“Ugh. Shit. Fuck that dick-shaped bottle,” he groans as he massages his temples. “Never again, I tell you.”
Finally able to untangle his limbs from the sweat-soaked sheets, Tony shakily gets up from bed. He first takes off his socks, then his sweatpants, and finally the three layers of sweaters. It took the engineer a bit of maneuvering to get rid of the last sweater as the cloth clung to his skin like a leech. But once it was off and he’s only left standing a little unsteadily in his boxers, it was in that moment that it dawned on Tony that the bone-chilling sensation in his chest was long gone.
Of course, that was also the night Steve realized he harbored romantic feelings for a certain genius.
“Thor, what do you mean by
“Then we started a family — three sons and two daughters. It wasn’t easy. Never is, marrying a soldier. You not only love the good parts, but also accept the broken parts. Well, when I say broken.” She snorts and wrinkles her nose, much to Tony’s amusement. “But he wasn't broken, see. Lost and wounded, yes, but all he needed to do was heal. Every day he was alive, my George loved our kids with all he had. He struggled with his own demons, but he loved them fiercely, he did. And being surrounded by everyone who loved and cared for him... well, it helped a lot. And all that love he gave was returned tenfold.”
He’s known Tony for nearly two years, been living with him for almost that long, and not once did he hear the man speak without swearing every other sentence. Feeling ashamed of himself for not noticing the obvious, Steve discreetly glances at Bruce and is filled with relief when he catches sight of the embarrassed look that passes over the physicist’s face.
A split second later, Bruce hurries back to the bedroom. Steve tries not to startle at the manic glint in the man’s eye.
“Do you do this often? Make hot cocoa?” Tony asks then, and it’s the curiosity in his voice that makes Steve meet his inquiring gaze with a slightly sheepish smile.
Tony falls into a dreamless slumber with a smile on his face.
Seen what, exactly? That can’t be good, can it?
Bring It Home To Me - Sam Cooke
of mistakes, and I’m still atoning for them. Still making up for the… important components that got lost, or destroyed. And no matter how much I work, no matter how much I build and freely give to make up for the loss, it still doesn’t feel enough. Like, I have to — I
Steve snorts. “That sentence shouldn’t make sense, but it does.”
Tony breathes out a sigh of relief then.
“Not in front of the children, cupcake,” he replies with a pout. “Besides, we’ve been doing this song and dance for years.
Tony’s silent as he contemplates his words. Without waiting for an answer, Steve starts preparing their food.
They all decided to settle on a jazz club-like theme, so it was all warm lights and snazzy decor, with the combined efforts of Natasha and Bruce decorating the place earlier. Clint and Thor tag-teamed once again, but this time they were in charge of the food (they had all of Steve’s favorites cooked by a hired chef, of course) and drinks, stocking the bar with the best and strongest alcohol. The engineer himself contributed by taking charge of the evening’s playlist, sticking closely to Steve’s favorites, the music playing from a jukebox. Tony also rented a photo booth that prints the photos in sepia tone that gives a 40s feel to it, as well as set up three rounds of fireworks displays that’ll go off in intervals during the duration of the party.
The four turn their heads to see Clint looking at them with a perplexed expression, the archer carrying a bowl of salad in his hands while Thor sets down the butcher knife as he pauses in cutting the roasted chicken to pieces.
Lifting his head to stare ahead of him once more, Tony opens his mouth to speak — to say anything, even if it’s a meaningless “hello?” — but he finds out that no voice emits from his throat.
Huh. Okay, then.
After several moments, Tony hums and drops a kiss to the crown of Natasha’s head.
Tony bites his lower lip as he lands beside an upturned truck. He fires his repulsors at two approaching Chitauri before he replies to his disapproving AI.
“Well, I was a lot worse when I didn’t have the Other Guy,” Bruce admits with a shrug. “Sometimes, I wonder if I didn’t get hit by that radiation I would eventually die due to liver failure. But lo and behold.”
. What you think — and feel — is valid. I mean, yeah, you still have a long way to go in terms of catching up, but that’s okay. Like you said, you’re still adjusting. But don’t think for one second that you don’t deserve to be here. Because you do. There’s a reason you survived that crash; there’s a reason why the serum worked and you were frozen for seventy years. Whatever those reasons are, it’s not for us to comprehend; we just gotta deal with the cards that we’re dealt with. Fact of the matter is: you belong here.”
expecting that reception! Thank you all
Clint has an annoying habit of camping out in the vents, but the archer also happens to be the tidiest among them.
If possible, Tony’s already vulnerable expression slackens when his mouth hangs open in shock at Steve’s declaration. Stomach fluttering with nerves and his heart in his throat, Steve forces himself not to break eye contact. His hands have become sweaty, but since Tony is still clutching onto his fingers like a lifeline, he doesn’t let go. Not like he wants to, to be honest.
, Clint! Of course it’s my fault —”
Tony, who’s uncharacteristically approaching the table with slow, almost timid steps, blinks owlishly at him.
“Who says I was trying to beat Clint?” Tony says with a lopsided grin, his whiskey-colored eyes bright with undisguised affection.
The super soldier rolls his eyes but simply states, “C’mon, Tony, don’t make this awkward. I’m tired, you’re tired, and we need to rest. You don’t want to go back to your room, and this couch is big enough for the two of us.”
For example, last year he bought Clint one of the original Storm Trooper costumes from Disney (who bought Lucasfilm,
“— ‘that it isn’t real?’ I know that!” Tony interjects hotly. He stops in his tracks and points an accusing finger at the other man as he adds, “Also, I know for a fact that it was Albus Dumbledore from
Natasha cocks her head and hums contemplatively. Thor grins, as he always does. Bruce blinks twice before pinching the bridge of his nose.
“What exactly are you trying to say?” Steve cocks his head, brows furrowed in confusion even as his mouth stretches into a smile. He wasn’t aware that their teammates gave Tony a similar pep talk, however he’s not surprised that they did. They’ve all seen how self-destructive the genius can be, and Steve supposes they also considered it their responsibility to look after Tony in their own way.
“You’ve been awake for approximately thirty-nine hours, sir,” announces JARVIS suddenly, and there's no mistaking the disapproval in the AI's tone.
to read and learn and keep track of. But it’s okay. I have you and the team, and JARVIS. God knows I would’ve given up if it weren’t for you guys, so. Thank you, Tony.”
“You’ve never had cold milk with grilled cheese sandwich?” He asks.
That conversation happened almost sixteen hours ago. In the present, it’s a little after two in the morning and Steve has just stepped out of the elevator in the common area to make some hot cocoa. He’d been tossing and turning in his bed for almost three hours, unable to fall asleep. As to why, the super soldier doesn’t have a clue, but he sure hopes that a cup of his favorite beverage will be able to help him fall asleep.
“Mm-hm. ‘Night, Steve.”
JARVIS — tear him a new one.
“Also in need of repair.”
“It’s okay, Steve.”
“You’re not pathetic, Steve,” Natasha cuts in with an eye-roll, and it’s then Steve realizes he must’ve said the last part out loud. “You’re just slow on the uptake on some things. But that doesn’t mean you’re not gonna learn.”
I mean it. Seriously. I miss you so much.
Whiskey-colored eyes suddenly open wide, but he’s greeted with darkness. Turning his head left and right, then up, his body goes along with the movement in a sluggish motion. Still, there’s nothing — and all he’s greeted with is darkness.
,” Bruce quips back as he glances up in time to meet Tony’s unimpressed gaze with a knowing look of his own. Sighing, he abandons the sample he’s inspecting to angle his body towards his friend’s. He remains quiet, and when Tony doesn’t speak, Bruce lets out another sigh as he pinches the bridge of his nose.
“So are you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mjölnir unknowingly (or not) took a lifetime’s worth of Tony’s fears and insecurities and completely hammered — no pun intended — the simple truth in the genius’s thick skull through one phrase.
for your incredible feedback. I honestly feel quite overwhelmed. Seeing as I'm making this up as I go along (like, around 65% this time, I'm doing a bit more research now haha), I'm very excited to go on this journey with you!

“I suggest house arrest,” Natasha pipes up. When they turn to stare at her with mirroring looks of shock, the redhead sighs and explains, “Imagine the Tony we just witnessed dealing with the general public. People will wonder what the hell happened to him, especially when he doesn’t make his trademark sarcastic and witty comebacks. It’s for his protection.”
Steve sets aside his sketchbook, a half-drawn outline of a bakery from Brooklyn in the ‘40s, and he stands up from the couch to stretch. He walks to the stereo where his beloved iPod is currently plugged. He scrolls and selects a random playlist and hits shuffles.
“You need to use your words, dear. And based from what you just said, I take it you haven’t really been communicating properly to your family and friends?”
“Yeah, what she said. We know you, Cap. You’re guilty that you didn’t watch Stark’s six more, but it’s not your fault.”
Oh yes, Thor agrees silently. Only time will tell, indeed.
A beat, and then, “Yes, sir. Astute observation as always.”
The silence then becomes more strained as the minutes ticked by, and that’s when Steve finally decides to break it.
“Good to be back, Captain,” is the AI’s response, then quickly adds, “Currently tracing Sir’s whereabouts.”
“Uh,” he hears Tony say dumbly.
“It’s alright, Steve,” the redhead says. “Now, luckily, I got Rhodey on the line so we can quickly get JARVIS back online.”
They’re silent for a while after that. Suddenly, Tony’s temples throb, and he closes his eyes with a curse.
“Aye,” Thor nods. “Mjölnir has always found you worthy. She has longed to reach out to you but couldn’t. It was only fate that you accidentally wielded her.”
Odd but nice. Unexpected but welcomed.
There’s a hint of sarcasm in his tone this time, and Natasha just blinks at the engineer while Bruce and Steve exchange a look. The super soldier can’t help but frown because although it’s his trademark trait, Tony’s manner of speaking still sounds so
A deep sigh.
. I’m so sick and tired of people calling me
Steve’s chest twinges when he discerns the erratic beating of Tony’s heart that signifies his nervousness.
“So, Tony,” he starts conversationally. He waits until Tony is pulled from his thoughts and looks up to meet Steve’s eyes, an eyebrow quirking up in a silent question. Steve feels the corners of his lips slightly tug upwards into a smile because
“Which brings me to my next point,” Tony interjects between huffs of breath as he fires repulsors at the alien bastards about to attack a group of tourists. “It’s like 2012 all over again. Also, since it’s a Thursday — #TBT, team! Go us!”
Right away, some pop music starts to play over the speakers. Steve, who’s been listening to all kinds of music ever since he’s bought his own iPod (
“Hey, Tony, mind putting the milk back in the fridge?”
“Sir, I’ve told you before that it is me,” Jarvis interrupts Tony mid-rant, the taller man raising an eyebrow at the engineer when he scoffs. “And as I told you earlier, of course it’s happening in your head. But why should that mean —”
“Bed empty! No note! Car gone!” Clint adds with a shit-eating grin.
After that, he tells Pepper the interaction he had with Steve at the communal kitchen from a few days ago, and how the super soldier’s words jarred some memories he wasn’t aware he could still recall until that fateful day. And how, in the years he’s been living and fighting with the Avengers, none of them knew of his musical abilities. How he accidentally on purpose kept it a secret from them. It wasn’t in his file for the proposal of The Avengers Initiative, that Tony knows of for certain. So in that time he decided to gift Steve with a private performance (which will happen sooner than later, he thinks with trepidation), Tony knows that it’ll be the most honest and most open he’ll ever be towards another person.
“We get that, Steve. Really, we do. But sometimes even the best-laid plans go wrong. I’m not saying that there’s anything wrong with your to-do list,” the archer adds in a placating tone when Steve opens his mouth to protest. “It’s fine. But I’m just saying that it would be better if we play this by ear. Sta—
Steve’s a horrible person and he
It’s only when Steve’s lying on his bed twenty minutes later when it dawns on him that despite the circumstances, he reveled in the feeling of having Tony in his arms. He admits then that he likes it more than he initially thought.
Shaking himself from his stupor, Steve closes the book and meets Tony’s tired eyes with a tired smile of his own.
Tony???
It takes Clint a horribly long time to discern what just happened and
Steve and Thor are standing stock still in one of the corridors, and the two share a troubled look.
“Yes.”
Hell, Tony
Steve’s heart warms at the easy affection that has grown between them this past month. The relief at seeing Tony safe and unharmed is apparent on the others’ body language, and Steve realizes that it wasn’t just him who made a conscious decision to set aside their disappointment and anger at the stunt the genius pulled this afternoon.
is glancing their way every other minute or so. Granted, they’ve broken up months ago, and it was a mutual break up, too. But sometimes Steve can’t help but feel he’s being watched by the indomitable Pepper Potts.
Thor shakes his head, brows furrowed in frustration.
Steve purses his lips for a moment before he nods. He looks at Tony, dressed in black sweatpants and two layers of sweater. He has finally stood from the couch and is walking towards them, his sock-clad feet not making a noise on the tiles.
“Nothing is wrong with you, Tony,” Jarvis states firmly, and for a moment Tony almost believes him. “Now come along. The earlier we arrive at our destination, the sooner your questions will be answered.”
They continue to walk as Steve listens for the lyrics. Once he hears it, he can’t help the faint flush that creeps up his neck. Thank God for crappy street lights because then Tony won’t be able to see it.
is a better question.
, Tony mouths.
“It didn’t bother me when he said that he didn’t know if he’d be able to help me out,” Bruce utters to the group. “He’s still recovering, after all. But it’s the hesitation in his eyes that bothers me the most. Like, like as if he —”
“It’s the way you carry yourself. Can’t see your eyes, can I? But no matter, those hands of yours speak a world of experience, and as far as I know, my George had that same slump in his shoulders as you do. He was a surgeon, see. Served in World War II. Saved as many lives as he could, but war’s a messy business. Can’t save everyone. Still, didn’t stop my George from feeling guilty for every life lost under his hands. Went into depression for a long while, too, along with the PTSD. It took years before he got better.”
“But your arc reactor’s there,” Clint points out in confusion.
. Aside from Rhodey, Jarvis the butler and Jarvis the AI, he’s thankful that he has another person in his life who knows him well enough to read between the lines.
“He married me, of course,” the elderly woman replies with a wink at Tony, and he can’t help but laugh at that.
of her. But another part of her, the sensible part that is, could understand why Tony would draw to that conclusion.
“The ventilation’s okay, J. It’s just — I was… never mind.”
It’s the first time in almost a month that Tony can confidently say it’s the most
It takes another two days before Tony’s released from medical. Fortunately, it so happened that Steve and the rest of the team (minus Bruce who was with Tony down in med bay) were in the communal kitchen for brunch, so when the two scientists arrive at the common area, Steve doesn’t hesitate to gesture them over to join them at the dining table.
“I swear, I’m never gonna let you drink milkshakes at two in the morning,” Steve promises with a shake of his head. Then, seeing Tony’s pout for the second time that night, Steve purses his lips to refrain from laughing. “No, I’m serious. Your imagination knows no bounds in the dead of the night.”
Distantly, he can hear Peter’s movements in the bathroom, and he knows they have less than a minute before the teen comes out and it’s Tony’s turn to clean up.
“Thanks, buddy.”
Coming Home - Sheppard
With Thor, Steve described him at first as a child trapped in an adult man’s body. But lo and behold, the Asgardian turns out to offer more wisdom and insight to the team as much as he consumes pop tarts on a daily basis.
It's been a month since Avengers: Endgame. I still find myself grieving these characters, hence why I've been binge reading a lot of fanfic lately and spent less time writing. That ought to change. This chapter is dedicated to the Original Avengers, especially to Tony and Nat.
“Thanks, Tony. You’re pretty great yourself."
“Yeah, we sorta got that.”
much information about an Asgardian’s stamina in bed.
“Past eight,” Clint replies. Then after a moment, he asks, “How long have you been awake, anyway?”
With a heavy sigh, Tony turns around to look at him, and the expression on his face makes the super soldier’s cheerful mood plummet.
Bruce sighs heavily once more, and it’s in the slight slump in his shoulders that the heavy weight in Steve’s stomach presses further uncomfortably.
“Oh.”
So yeah.
“If you’re sure,” the blond man says, still looking at Tony with doubt.
“Not too long, then,” Steve mutters to himself.
Suffice to say, today is
However, much to everyone’s surprise, Natasha leans her head against Tony’s shoulder. Their hips swaying in sync to the music, she quietly admits, “It reminded of my humanity. One I thought I lost while in the Red Room. That maybe there’s something worth salvaging in me, even after everything.”
“No, it’s not yet safe for you,” Natasha interjects with a shake of her head.
“Yes, now! C’mon!”
Finally, after what feels like hours of a little bit of awkward silence, but was only in fact a minute and a half, Pepper’s eyes return to Tony’s, and the look the CEO gives the engineer is one he’s only seen a handful of times in the time they’ve known each other. There’s a small pinch between Pepper’s brows, lips pursed into a thin line as she stares at Tony with glistening eyes.
Thor hums, clearly displeased. Clint and Natasha swear in uncanny unison. Steve’s frown deepens.
Tony clears his throat and nods once. “Yeah, sure. Lunch sounds good.”
to make friends. For a long time, the only friend he ever had was Bucky, and it’s only when he got juiced up on the serum that he managed to meet other people and have them look twice at him, instead of looking through him. And it was always
“Cabin fever will do that to you,” Bruce comments wryly.
Because when you’re unable to say the words you want to say to the person who means everything to you, then what else could Tony do but to sing his heart out to the man? Quite literally, too.
Bruce grins at him and offers a hasty ‘thanks’ before he hurries out of the suite.
Tony snorts and takes a sip of his drink. “I think I’ve spoiled you too much, Cap.”
“Well, he didn’t exactly specify what activities I should and shouldn’t do,” Tony reasons with a shrug. “So joke’s on him, really.”
His mind hazy with exhaustion and vision blurring slightly around the edges (that can’t be good, he thinks, but quickly swats the thought away because he needs his caffeine fix, damn it), he distantly hears himself croak out a request for JARVIS to turn on the lights to twenty-five percent. When he’s bathed with the soft fluorescent lights, he mumbles a thanks and proceeds to make his way to the counter where he knows the coffee machine is located.
Tony takes in his surroundings one more time before he answers, “I’m clear here, too.” Then he adds, “J, what’s the sitch?”
In fact, he likes it so much that he’s perfectly aware he’s definitely treading on uncharted waters. And frankly, Steve doesn’t think he’s willing to step away from the feelings that’s starting to surface and blossom in regards to a certain genius-engineer.
There’s more to Tony than meets the eye, yes. He’s known that since the failed Chitauri invasion. But what he didn’t know until today was how deep Tony’s insecurities lie, how doubtful he is of himself, considering his achievements and accolades. That information alone is enough for the Other Guy to want to break out and avenge his favorite teammate. It also goes to show how protective Bruce has become of his friend. Going over the engineer’s words earlier, it makes the physicist's blood boil with anger at all the people who hurt Tony, who made the man question his own self-worth.
He realizes he never asked for her name.
Steve enters the workshop and stares at the stubborn genius with a reproachful look. Annoyed as he is, the super soldier can’t help the rush of affection when Tony, who’s hunched over one of the tables and fiddling with one of the gauntlets, glances up and looks at him like a kid that was caught with his hand in the cookie jar. His expression quickly shifts as he grins roguishly at Steve.
It’s pretty pathetic, come to think of it. But then again, that’s nothing new.
But it’s just…
“Well, not everything can be destroyed with a nuke or lightning,” Tony begins slowly.
Every now and then he stops and turns to shoot repulso s at the oncoming horde. However, after the fourth time he did that, his aim was cut off by one of the Chitauri’s gun hitting the edge of his left gauntlet. Tossing aside the ruined gauntlet, Tony does his best to take down more Chitauri with his remaining weapon. It doesn’t take long before that goes down as well. Momentarily thrown off at the impact of the energy-based gun, Tony crashes into the side of a Camaro and lands on his ass. He groans as pain shoots up his back before he forces himself to get up, deactivating the destroyed gauntlet and casting it aside in the process. He’ll find it later during clean-up.
Closing his eyes, Tony focuses inward and clears his mind. He does so by concentrating on his breathing — two seconds in, three seconds out. He repeats the process a few more times until the chaos in his mind dissipates. When Tony slowly breathes out for the last time, he finds himself almost calm and grounded in that moment. Next, he opens his eyes and when he calls for more lightning the second time around, he instantly notices the difference.
He occupies himself with catching up to decades’ worth of information he’s missed since he was in the ice. It’s slow going, but the support Steve has received from his team in terms of helping him acclimatize to the new century has proved invaluable.
Try as he might, Steve is unable to hide his flinch at Pepper’s blunt words. Shame and guilt twists in his gut, and he knows he deserves to be called out on his behavior from before. After all, he’s just as liable as the others. From the corner of his eye, he can see Bruce shifting from foot to foot with a chagrined expression, while Natasha averts her eyes from them, remorse evident in the assassin’s eyes.
— he loves wholly, in every sense of the word.
Steve sighs. Sad to say, that’s exactly what the old Tony would do, but the new (?) Tony they have now is making the super soldier — and the rest of the team — reevaluate what little they know about the genius-billionaire.
“Uh…” Bruce falters, an inscrutable expression crossing over his face. “Tony?”
fine. Just… please.”
“And that requires going somewhere in private?”
that’s been missing in his chest.
He sees his own hand clutching the milk jug for Tony to take. Next, he catches sight of Tony’s expression go from disinterested to alarmed, brown eyes blown wide in — panic? Shock? Fear? — before that
At this, Tony reacts. Wide-eyed and most probably looking panicked (that’s how he feels, so no doubt he’s projecting his emotions like bright, neon signs), he shakes his head repeatedly as he exclaims, “Are you crazy?! We’ve been planning this since May! No fucking way we’re cancelling your party, Cap. Besides, we’ve sent the invites weeks ago and everyone RSVP’d  already. So nuh-uh, no backing out.”
“Suit up and meet at the hangar in five,” Steve orders. They’re almost at the elevator when Steve realizes his error. With a curse, he turns around to look at Tony, who’s craned his neck to look at them with wide, fearful eyes. “Tony…”
Ignoring the unpleasant rolling in his stomach because
I'm on
Steve smiles at him and nods, looking pleased that Tony’s finally deciding to sleep, regardless that it’s only past three in the afternoon. Oh, well, it’s not like Tony doesn’t have fucked up sleeping habits, anyway.
Bruce, who turns into a green rage monster when pissed, is probably the most level-headed person Steve’s ever met, and despite the scientist’s way of holing himself up in his laboratory for several hours a day, it turns out that he’s a surprisingly good cook.
… Not exactly helping my case, Rogers. 🙈
Steve looks slightly amused when he says, “Because Bruce crashed into my room instead of his, and I didn’t wanna bring out the Other Guy so I just. Decided to sleep here.”
But before Tony can reply, the remaining creatures let out a collective roar, and that's when all hell breaks loose.
Steve bites his lip when no further text comes. It takes him several seconds to reply.
Steve just shakes his head as he chuckles when Tony raises his pinky, a shit-eating grin gracing the engineer’s face when he sees Steve’s face light up.
“I’m a free bitch, baby!”
didn’t notice it until he’s literally laid hands on him. “You’re shivering,” he adds, unable to hide the alarm in his voice. “Why— are you running a fever?”
I'm so sorry this is almost a month late. Work's just been so stressful. I've been working overtime often (without pay, mind you), and I rarely have time to just sit down and write. The free time that I get, I spend it either sleeping or reading.
“Captain?”
“Knew you were gonna catch me,” Steve says with a wide grin after Tony grabs him around the waist and depositing him safely on the ground. “Thanks, babe.”
In fact,
This time, it’s Clint’s voice they hear over the comms. “I’ve changed spots but — hang on, I think — yeah, I have visuals on Goldilocks. He looks to be knocked out. Must be from the explosion as well ‘cos there’s a slab of concrete and an upturned vehicle on top of him.”
“Relationships are a two-way street,” she continues with another pat to Tony’s smooth cheek. “Can’t expect your loved ones to know what you need if you don’t voice them out. And I know people like you hate the thought of being vulnerable, but let me tell you what I told my George all those years ago:
Nevertheless, Thor will not concede defeat for he has a plan.
“Are you alright?” Steve adds, furrowing his brows when he sees Tony cross his arms.
“No, it’s not. That was unprofessional of me. I —”
. Making enemies, however? Sure, he can probably write a dissertation about that. The thing is, the ugly truth is that Steve doesn’t know
Before Steve can reply, Tony walks ahead of him and makes a beeline to the grand piano placed between the living room and the floor-to-ceiling windows — giving it a perfect view of the balcony and landing pad, as well as New York City’s iconic skyline. The fireworks display was over hours ago, but there’s still the occasional colorful bursts of gunpowder that’s somewhat audible, painting the dark, cloudless sky every now and then. The only source of light they have is from the full moon and the high-rise buildings outside, exhibiting a very intimate ambience that Tony can’t help but notice.
He plays the last note and holds it for a few seconds before letting go. All throughout, not once did he avert his gaze from Steve, and Tony marvels at the mere fact that he managed to not fuck up.
“Did anyone—” he rasps out. It’s only now he realizes that his throat is dry and his voice is hoarse from talking out loud and to himself for the past half hour.
I hope you like this chapter. More Tony and Team Bonding to come in the succeeding chapters.
. Because if there’s one thing Tony is, it’s that he wants to take everything to the next level. From the gifts to the actual celebration, he wants this year to be better.
So yeah.
“Who needs a nuke or lightning when we have a fully functioning suit with an arc reactor embedded in it?” Tony asks innocently. “It’s perfect, J.”
“Sir, that is not an—” JARVIS protests but Tony easily cuts him off, his mind already made up with his harebrained plan.
Bruce doesn’t respond, counting under his breath as he keeps one eye on his watch as he takes Tony’s pulse. A minute passes, and when Steve sees Bruce start to frown, he feels his stomach swoop uncomfortably.
But Steve is paying attention. Just… it’s a bit hard to give Tony his complete attention when his
“Where are we?” he asks instead, swallowing past the lump still lodged in his throat.
“What do you mean?” Steve asks.
,” Clint hears himself say. He knows he’s looking just as wide-eyed as Tony who
It's been a while. Here's something short and sweet.
Steve feels his chest swell with affection for his friends, and he blames his sentimentality in that moment that he doesn’t notice when Tony managed to wrap his arm around Steve’s, his right hand burning an invisible mark on Steve’s forearm as his head nestles comfortably on the super soldier’s broad shoulder.
“Isn’t that normal?” Clint asks, puzzled.
I miss you, Steve.
Tony Stark is many things, but being worthy of wielding a powerful weapon created for a god is not one of them.
“I know it’s bothering you,” Bruce says softly. When Tony’s doubtful eyes meet his a second time, Bruce can’t help the wave of compassion he feels for his friend just then, the Other Guy rumbling at the back of his mind. “But what I don’t know is
for the man. If there’s one thing Tony isn’t, it’s that he doesn’t do things halfway. It's either you go big or you go home, and Tony is far from doing the latter.
Steve hears a gasp, and he turns to look at Natasha, green eyes lighting up in recognition of the song. In two seconds flat she’s up in her feet with Tony and Bruce, the three starting to dance to the music again.
“Okay, so I know we’re all a bit freaked out at what just happened,” he says. Clint snorts and Steve shoots the archer a look, the latter having the grace to look sheepish. Bruce clears his throat before he continues. “And JARVIS is still busy doing scans on the weapon that hit Tony. It’s going to take another couple of hours before it’s complete. At this point, I’m afraid I can’t give you guys good enough answers to your questions.”
“Sir is currently asleep in the living room of his suite,” JARVIS explains as Steve sets his sketchbook aside and gets up from bed to wash his smudged hands. “However, he’s fallen from the couch from tossing and turning. Further scanning indicates that he’s experiencing a nightmare, although his body temperature is also worrisome.”
How about that?
, gosh it’s like he’s back to feeling like a pubescent teenager — voice. “All good here, but it’s not as fun without you guys.”
It takes JARVIS a fraction of a second to respond, and his AI’s voice is laced with concern when he says, “Sir, your bedroom won’t have proper ventilation if I do as you say. Your vitals also indicate that your body temperature is perfectly normal, and I —”
Tony glares half-heartedly at the camera installed.
Tony’s silence is answer enough.
Which is why he’s disheartened when he realized that the eccentric mortal completely fails to grasp the importance of this feat. Thus, Thor has taken it upon himself to create opportunities wherein he can leave Mjölnir whenever Tony is not in his workshop or penthouse, giving his friend the chance to better acquaint himself with Mjölnir. Fortunately, he also had the full support of his dear hammer and JARVIS, so the Asgardian was able to carry out his plan to near perfection.
That last bit ended up sounding like a question than a statement.
If possible, Steve’s frown deepens. “Tony, of course this is something to worry about. I should probably wake Bruce up —”
Now, he is perfectly aware that he’s
“Hmm?”
Pepper chokes out, flabbergasted.
He would’ve said more, but the chills are getting worse and he needs to find a way to cut this conversation short, no matter how much he wants to continue chatting with his best friend.
Steve nods mutely, his throat too dry to utter a word.
So Tony has a problem.
“Hey,” he says in a hushed tone.
“We should also enlist the help of JARVIS,” Bruce adds. “This way, he’d be able to tell us of Tony’s whereabouts or alert us if something’s come up.”
Fortunately, Tony finds his inattentiveness amusing because he snorts and rolls his eyes good-naturedly.
(WIP)
Bruce’s brows are furrowed, but he nods his head. “Yeah?”
Bruce shakes his head. “Not yet. He hasn’t got back to us with any report about that weapon that hit Tony, anyway. Let’s leave SHIELD as a last resort.”
Tony Stark.
“You look weird without the beard, man,” the archer comments. Before Natasha or Pepper can tear him a new one for his lack of
, I just need to figure it all out. The sooner JARVIS and I start, the sooner I can give us all answers.”
“Fury isn’t exactly known for his patience,” Steve says with a smirk. He takes out a loaf of bread and two kinds of cheese before closing the fridge with a gentle nudge of his hip. “SHIELD may have the resources, but even Fury wouldn’t be willing to assign an agent or two to specifically bring me up to date on everything I missed. Grilled cheese sandwich okay with you?”
“It wasn’t a who, it was a
“What’s going on?” Steve asks, curious.
If anyone asks what he was thinking in that moment, Steve wouldn’t be able to give them a proper answer. But deep down, he knows. He gave in to the urge and just… finally leaned in.
their leader can get whenever Tony goes on these work binges; Clint would describe it as pathetic if it weren’t so — perish the thought, he’s shuddering just thinking about it —
Eventually, Bruce breaks the silence, his sober tone a complete contrast to his loose posture.
Tony forces himself to open one eye, sees that Steve’s eyes are already closed, but there’s a fond smile etched on the blond man’s face. His heart skips a beat, and Tony shuts his eye again as he slowly breathes out.
, he tells himself with steely determination.
It’s obvious that Steve doesn’t believe him — seriously? He can lie better than this, but oh well, it’s just not his week — and after another minute of studying Tony in contemplation, he notices Steve’s shoulders droop slightly as he nods his head once.
Steve tilts his head in thought as he ponders on the question for a moment longer. Eventually, he settles with, “Gotta say, Tony, that question got me thinking. But I’d go with the hot cocoa, only because it’s the same way my ma used to make, save for a couple of ingredients. She made me this drink whenever I was sick, which was pretty often. And I suppose I associate it with comfort and safety, so I guess it makes sense that I’d seek this out whenever I can’t fall asleep.”
Steve’s frowning as he tosses the towel in the laundry basket before quickly grabbing his phone and leaving his room.
Honestly, Steve may have initially come down here with good intentions to properly chastise Tony, but what he didn’t expect is to
“Sorry. What now?” Clint asks with a nervous chuckle when the silence stretched on for more than five seconds.
There’s a slight pause before the AI answers. “Sir’s current vitals show that he is in distress, and I have drawn to the conclusion that it has to do with the nightmare he had. I highly suggest that you do not bombard him with questions for it may only aggravate his state further.”
He sees Tony furrow his brows in thought, and Steve thinks the engineer looks almost child-like wearing that expression. Inwardly shaking his head at that random observation, he focuses back on Tony as he opens his mouth to speak.
In fact, the next song the physicist requested JARVIS to play ends up breaking the impromptu lesson when Steve sees Tony’s face light up when a ukulele starts to play across the room.
“Exactly like a date,” Steve confirms quickly, and he flushes at his emphatic response.
“Uh, Cap? Steve?” Tony asks at last, unable to take the silence any longer. “Some feedback would be nice. Preferably ‘thank you’.”
“I know that look,” Steve remarks quietly. “I’ve seen that look more often than I want to, and it hurts every time I catch a glimpse of that expression on your face. I know you, Tony, and you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself. I won’t even pretend to know or understand what’s bothering you, but I — I worry about you. We all do. All the time. And I, I just want to help you, in any way I can. If you’ll let me, that is.”
“Alright, I’m coming there to assist him,” is Steve’s curt response.
“Thanks for the, uh, drink,” Tony interjects, slightly stumbling over his words. “I should head to bed, now. Kinda feeling the cocoa kick in.”
But Tony’s smiling, if a little reluctantly, as he says, “It’s fine. Now that you mentioned it, I’m curious myself. Thinking back to when I first woke up, I never felt the urge to swear. I mean, it’s
He’s discombobulated by his surroundings (is that the correct term? Oh, well). Still, he’s not able to make out the ground he’s standing on,
Aaaaand sorry if I woke you up. Shutting up now.
“Already done, Cap. Fury said their ETA is four minutes.”
“And what about those chills he gets?” Natasha pipes in, and Bruce acknowledges her with a nod.
from Lord of the Rings. A very odd combination, but it’s the closest that Steve can compare it to with his limited knowledge of pop culture.
There’s shocked silence over the comms as Tony’s teammates mull over his words.
Still, he can’t bring himself to remember how they managed to end up where they are: a private karaoke room complete with a table filled with snacks and finger foods next to the open bar, which everyone minus Steve immediately took advantage of.
Tony’s lips quirk around the rim of his mug as he takes another long sip.
Tony wrinkles his nose at the odd remark, so he turns to look at her. “What?”
Oh god, not this again.
Steve doesn’t even pretend to understand those references. He just shakes his head and pushes himself from the wall he’s been leaning against for the past hour.
"Me more. Like, so much more," Tony slurs.
To listen to the playlist, click the link below:
“Well, you
“Yes. That. Adding in that observation Steve shared before about the mysterious chills Tony gets now and then, I think it also ties in to what’s happening with his brain. Because if you look at the dates here, say about three days ago — I recall Tony wearing a sweater to dinner.”
“For the record,” Steve adds, eyes boring into Tony’s with earnestness. He squeezes the latter’s fingers a second time, pleasantly surprised when Tony squeezes back with a wavering smile. With a deep breath, he finally decides to lay down all his cards on the table. “The only version I want you to be is already standing in front of me. I like you, and want you, just as you are.”
Not wanting to ruin the good mood, they soon drop the topic. They each do their own thing for several minutes, only to be broken once more by Natasha.
Tony looks at him in surprise. “That’s oddly specific. But then again, you got super hearing. So what’s the song? I can’t hear the lyrics.”
Peter’s eyes widened in excitement. He finishes cleaning in no time and goes to the bathroom built in the lab.
“Doesn’t hurt to be prepared, Clint,” Steve contradicts, frowning slightly at the two assassins. He meets Natasha’s stare with a raised eyebrow of his own. “What? What’s that look for, Nat?”
“Yeah,” he mumbles.
“Hey, Steve,” the engineer replies with a small smile. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just can’t sleep. Fancy seeing you here at this late hour, too.”
Is he about to have a stroke? That can’t be right. He has the serum running through his veins.
Upon hearing those words, alarm bells start to sound in Steve’s head.
After several moments, he hears Steve speak quietly, affectionately, "Love you, too, Tony."
sounds too light, and
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve assures him with a small smile.
Tony looks up from the tablet where he’s been answering Stark Industries-related e-mails to meet Natasha’s eyes.
“J-JARVIS,” Tony chokes, still heaving deep breaths. He tightly shuts his eyes, vague images of his dream dancing behind his eyelids like a distorted film reel as JARVIS — his
Steve grunts upon hearing the AI’s voice, his focus deep on the sketch he’s been doing for the past forty minutes of his old neighborhood in Brooklyn. Though he’s been adjusting really well to the 21st century, the super soldier still has those days when he feels the memories of his past life creep up on him like tendrils of smoke — long enough to see it but fades away almost instantly. A glimpse of him and Bucky getting drunk on cheap liquor at the nearest bar. The Howling Commandos laughing at something incredibly lewd but funny Dugan’s said. Peggy and her ruby red lips brushing against Steve’s in desperation — a reassurance, a promise, a goodbye.
“I understand. Just don’t do it again.”
Bruce doesn’t have an answer to that, and when the bespectacled man only shakes his head with a muttered “I don’t know, Tony”, he looks up to meet the rest of the team’s frightened expressions.
Something presses in Steve’s chest, and the tender expression on Tony’s face is one that stays with him for a long time.
long, wow) when the man himself slowly opens his eyes to meet Tony’s.
Tony carefully makes his way to where they’re all seated — or stood, in Steve’s and Pepper’s case — in the living room.
Tony hesitates for a second, but he eventually utters, “I guess. My chest did hurt from the impact, though. But yeah, that’s it.” He adds with another shrug.
Tony snorts, and they fall silent for a while.
what the hell he’s wearing, but based on the texture of the cloth he’s guessing it’s his suit’s under armor. Then, he notices that he’s barefoot, which is weird, because he
“Not all of it, I’m afraid,” Jarvis replies apologetically, and Tony jerks his head to look at him in shock. The former turns to meet Tony’s startled eyes, and he impishly adds, “Yes, sir. I can hear your thoughts, but don’t worry. It’s nothing I haven’t heard before. And I must say, I agree with your assessment of Captain Rogers’ physique. He is, indeed, a fine specimen.”
Natasha raises an eyebrow at that information. “What kind of party were you at to be listening to this music while pissed drunk?”
Like last year, Tony bought out The Metropolitan Museum of Art for
smug at the small whimper he hears leave Tony’s full lips as he straightens his posture.
It’s painless but numbing, and it’s a sensation he hasn’t felt before —
“Hulk is excited,” Bruce comments offhandedly before the sound of Hulk roaring comes a second later.
“Bruce is right. We should give Tony the benefit of the doubt,” he says in his Captain America voice. “As of now, there’s nothing else we can do except to be there for Tony when he needs us. And he
Tony doesn’t say anything, in fact he’s quiet. And Steve’s starting to second-guess himself, that maybe he shouldn’t have said something horribly cliché and, and
“It does now,” Steve says with a tender expression.
, we’ll have a harder time helping him because it’s clear now that he doesn’t trust us.”
big enough for them. Still, Tony knows it’s gonna be a bit of a tight fit, considering Steve’s tall and muscular physique. Even though he’s been harboring a huge crush (okay, fine, it's more than that) on the super soldier, Tony also knows that it’s not every day he’s gonna be offered to sleep beside Steve Rogers.
He sees Tony glance at him from the corner in his eye, but the mild-mannered physicist wills himself not to hunch further from his position of peering into the microscope as he examines the DNA of the creature they defeated the other day.
Bruce only shrugged, but there’s a frown on his face when he said, “Though Tony’s tech is more advanced than theirs, I won’t be surprised if they got something up their sleeve. And I hope they do. For Tony’s sake, I really hope they do.”
“Was that Tony or a doppelgänger?”
He doesn’t want to put a name to it, not yet. He’s far from superstitious, but even Steve doesn’t want to jinx it. But he’s fought enough battles with his team to know when he’s witnessed a game changer.
“Sir has been asleep for two hours and forty-five minutes.”
The physicist, in question, hears Tony’s voice drift closer. Bruce gingerly gets up from his sprawled position to turn to see what tripped him, only to be greeted by the sight of Mjölnir innocently lying face down at the entrance of his lab.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve blinks, and he glances at Tony to see the genius looking at him with a curious look.
I'm Yours - Jason Mraz
Then all of a sudden, Natasha hears before she sees the crackle of lightning that appears from behind them. In the next second, Thor comes sweeping over the spider bots, swinging Mjölnir left and right before he releases a surge of lightning over the remaining bots so powerful that it hits two of the upturned vehicles and

Tony groans out loud before his eyes swivel around his workshop.
“No,” he admits hoarsely, voice breaking on the vowel. “I’m not.”
After Rhodey hangs up with the promise of Pepper updating him later, Clint grumbles under his breath while Natasha lets out a soft sigh. Bruce leans his hip against one of the worktables as he massages his temples. Thor casually swings Mjölnir in his grip.
Stay safe, everyone.
Tony shrugs. Kind as she may appear to be, he’s not going to blindly trust a stranger with his problems.
“Bruce, what — wait, Bruce!” Steve calls out after the retreating scientist, baffled at the nervous excitement he’s just witnessed his teammate exude.
“You were out of the country. I didn’t w—”
“Tony’s smart, guys. He would know to avoid the cameras and go the long way instead.”
“Don’t do it again, Tony,” Pepper says next. Her voice is stern but there’s a pleading note in her tone that nobody misses. There’s something heavy in the look she and Tony exchange, and Steve tamps down at the sudden flare of jealousy. “
Tony can feel the tingling in his damp and cramping fingers increase. Moisture drips from his temples and nose as his ruined dress shirt clings to his skin like a leech from the amount of sweat he’s produced.
He’s so
Like what gift to buy — or build — for Steve’s upcoming birthday. Which is happening in a week.
“Any idea when Old Saint Nick’s elves are arriving?” Tony asks as he fires up his thrusters and makes his way to clear 6th Avenue.
“So what, we’re sitting ducks here?” Clint says sharply.
about him. But he’s still only human, for the most part.
Tony gapes at him for a moment, eyes wide as he silently ponders Steve’s question until —
“Then what was it? The weapon they were using?”
“I did,” Steve admits honestly. It’s worth it, though, upon seeing Tony’s blinding smile. “Ready, Shellhead?”
“Hey now,” he says comfortingly as he takes a tentative step towards Pepper, who’s now looking at him as if he’s grown an extra four heads. “Don’t look like that, like I — like I kicked your puppy. Pep, c’mon, please.”
Natasha, who at first was stoic and guarded around them at first, turns out to be quite affectionate once she’s lowered her walls around them.
Like a fucking creep.
Haha yeah, currently typing from the jacuzzi. 😎
Tony looks over his shoulder to wink at him, and he catches sight of the super soldier flushing slightly at the gesture. He’s about to reach the elevator, the doors already open and waiting for him to enter, when he hears Steve’s voice call out to him again.
In the image that’s been retweeted more than half a million times and liked five million times on Instagram, Tony’s dominant arm that’s wielding Mjölnir is thrust towards the sky, his posture taut and brown doe-like eyes hidden behind an intense blue-white light as tendrils of lightning curl around his form.
Tony hums in pleasure. "Love you," he mumbles absentmindedly.
Steve cocks his head to the side. “What do you mean?”
Steve snorts at the obviously poor attempt to make fun of him, but nonetheless he smiles sheepishly at the brunet sitting opposite him.
“Well, I got bruised ribs ‘cos of it, didn’t I?”
what he’s discovered so far.
Despite the exhaustion making itself known again, Tony feels as light as a feather as he thinks with a dopey smile,
“That doesn’t sound like a bad idea. Maybe I should, then.”
, a really long time, Tony thinks he looks at least a decade younger.
. A welcome reprieve from the usual attention he gets whenever he’s in public. Not a single person has given him a second glance in the past few hours he’s been sitting in the stone bench. Yet despite knowing that he’s going to get an earful from his teammates when he returns to the Tower, Tony can’t bring it in himself to regret doing what he did.
Then again, it’s not like there was ever anything right with him in the first place.
So, disheartened at the lack of progress and good news, Bruce decided then to surrender the device to SHIELD, who gladly whisked it away the moment Steve contacted Fury that they weren’t able to obtain much information from their end.
From there, the others take turns requesting the AI to play songs as they seized the opportunity to educate both Steve and Thor on the evolution of music. What’s surprising is that in doing so, Steve learns more about his team.
Natasha notes with morbid amusement when she hears Tony curse in Italian, the sound of the repulsors audible in the distance.
Bruce exhales slowly, and he looks at Natasha and Steve knowingly.
“So what’s this burden you carry, young man?”
“Not yet, I’m afraid.”
That question, although innocent, ends up becoming the tipping point of Tony’s emotional turmoil this past week.
Tony grins at the nearest camera. “That’s my boy.”
They’re at a towering height of over seven feet, their bluish gray skin appearing reptilian-like. The top of their heads are bald and their faces are oval in shape, with a long neck and defined cheekbones that would initially give off a regal vibe if it weren’t for the rows of sharp teeth and crimson eyes. The creatures are dressed similarly from when Steve and the others fought them — silver armor protecting the vulnerable joints. There are weird symbols decorating the chest plate, with a round light at the center of it, similar to Iron Man’s arc reactor.
“Thor, do the lullaby on Hulk, please. We need Bruce for this.”
“We did well today.”
He’s coping, he’s adapting. He’s adjusting, and with each passing day Steve starts to feel less lost and more… well, not
How the fuck did he miss that the first time?
“Okay, was I the only one who didn’t know that Barton can carry a tune?” Tony asks in shock, and sounding sober for the first time all night.
to believe all those things. But it’s going to take some time. Like, a horribly long time, for me to come to terms with it. I mean,
The hammer remains quiet in his hand for several moments before Thor feels her acceptance of his statement.
. None of you do, so don’t pretend that you’ve got me all figured out because let me be frank with you: I’ll never be the person you want me to be so don’t expect that you can mold me into someone that you deem fit. Howard tried doing that, Obadiah attempted several times. Hell, even Pepper and Rhodey tried to change me, and they’re the two most important people in my life. None of them succeeded, because you know why? I’m fucked up! Damaged goods or whatever. So you better get that fantasy out of your head, Cap. Just because we got something going on doesn’t mean you’re gonna be my knight in shining fucking armor and be the person to save me from myself.”
“See you later, Winghead,” Tony breathes out.
In response, Tony whimpers again as his body continues to tremble under Steve’s hands, even though the intensity of his shivering has decreased. Helpless, Steve swallows his frustration at being unable to do anything else, so he presses another kiss on Tony’s forehead and continues to run his hand through his sweat-soaked hair.
“Oh, please,” the woman interrupts with a shake of her head. “You can’t expect to go about life alone, young man. No man is an island, after all. Smart people like you get stuck in your head and think it’s better to suffer in silence. Like doing that did a lot of good for my George. Well, all you’re doing is being selfish.”
Goodnight, Steve. Miss you and your baby blues. Hug you soon, baby 😘
Missing you. 🥺
The game is on! Things are finally picking up at the Tony & Steve train, and the plot is moving forward in the coming chapters. And yes, Clint did make that Mrs. Weasley reference. No regrets.
“But that’s the thing,” Tony argues. “I don’t want to burden them with my problems. It doesn’t matter—”
With the kid gone, Steve turns his attention to Tony and slowly walks over to the man who’s packing up the soldering iron.
Tony doesn’t bother to give him an answer except to roll his eyes and flip him off. Steve laughs, but it abruptly cuts off when Tony finally make a move.
The image of Tony’s melancholy expression from earlier is the last thing that Steve sees before he falls into a fitful sleep.
his mind chants repeatedly. And though it hurts him, Steve knows that he’s not
“What —” Tony starts, and he grimaces at the raspiness in his voice. Natasha, who’s standing nearest the bedside table, quickly fills up a glass with ice-cold water and hands it to Tony who gladly accepts it. “Thank you,” he mumbles quietly.
She pats Tony’s shoulder once more before she turns to watch the sunset. They watch it together in silence, and it stretches on until the skies turn dark and the stars start to twinkle in view. After some time, the elderly woman takes her cane to gingerly get up from the stone bench.
“I know. I’m making my rounds of thanking everyone. It just so happened I started with you. Still, thank you. This party looks great, and I can already see you have a few entertaining activities in store for us.”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he hears Tony mumble repeatedly.
“I actually
Grunting with the effort of disabling another spider bot, Natasha calmly states, “No use, they’ll easily outrun me. But I could use a lift.”
Unbeknownst to Pepper, the five Avengers exchange significant looks. Steve crosses his arms in thought as his mind mulls over that reference. The window disappears as well as the mainframe, accepting the codes. They patiently wait for JARVIS to activate.
It takes several moments before they get an answer.
It takes the CEO of Stark Industries a few seconds for those words and its meaning to sink in before she reacts. Eyes widening in shock, Pepper stares at Tony with an astonished look.
around them, and — sadly — to allow himself to bond with his peers. To truly be happy and content, it’s something he’s been craving for for most of his life.
Thor’s still eating his pop tart, but there’s a huge smile on his face as he looks at the two dancing Science Bros. Natasha’s picking at the leftover egg rolls as she rolls her eyes at Clint filming the two with his upgraded StarkPhone, all the while goading Tony to dip Bruce.
He straightens up from his slumped position on his bed as he replies, “What is it? Is it Tony? Is he okay? What happened?”
“Oh! Yeah, that’s the song,” the engineer agrees with a nod. “It’s called ‘Ho Hey’. I forgot the name of the band, though.”
way, as if I’m some dung stuck on the sole of their shoe. I know that none of you like me — I mean, we’re not even friends — and I’ve come to accept that.
sorry for what I did to you."
“Take off his suit. Use the override codes if you have to.”
“Steve, I-I’m,” Tony stammers helplessly. “
Smiling wistfully, he remembers the words uttered to him in his head, and he shakes his head again before he leaves the floor to return to his workshop.
Tony blinks at him, possibly a bit taken aback at the random request.
Another pause. “Dr. Banner has been informed and will meet you in three minutes, Captain.”
“Bruce? What is it?” the super soldier asks in a hushed tone.
“We are getting closer, sir.”
Steve’s eyebrows lift in mild surprise when he notices that Tony’s wearing a thick, grey sweater, plaid pajama pants, and white socks.
In that same instant, the hairs at the back of his neck and arms start to raise as a sudden chill sweeps over him, and it’s in that moment that something registers in him.
“About damn time.”
the one who’s sorry.” Tony blinks in shock, but Steve carries on, shifting to take Tony’s other hand in his and entwining their fingers together. Funny, that the first time he makes a move like this, it’s in the middle of an argument. “I didn’t mean— I never meant to offend or belittle you because that’s the last thing I’d ever do to you, Tony. God, it’s been a crazy night and I probably didn’t verbalize my thoughts properly, so, uh, let me try again?” At Tony’s cautious nod, Steve lets out a breath in relief and lightly squeezes his fingers before he soldiers on. “The thing is, Tony: I
that and what I’m… currently going through.”
Steve turns his head to look at Thor with bewilderment. He’s not the only one. Natasha and Clint share twin looks of confusion before aiming it at the demigod. Bruce, on the other hand, blinks and massages his temples.
It takes a second for the implication to set in before everyone, bar Thor who’s busy opening a packet of strawberry-flavored pop tarts, groans at the engineer. Clint throws a dirty pair of chopsticks towards Tony while Steve crumples an unused napkin and throws it at his head.
They remain in that position for some time, Steve basking in the affection and trust Tony has bestowed upon him until JARVIS informs them that the food has arrived and their teammates are impatiently waiting for them to join them in the living room.
“Oh! I haven’t heard this song since my MIT days,” the genius gushes, eyes closed with a blissful smile on his face as he hums along to the music. “Ah, I remember being absolutely drunk or high — probably both, to be honest.”
Tony’s blinking blearily as he opens one of the cupboards to retrieve a mug while he waits for the coffee to be brewed. Thankfully, he doesn’t have to wait long, and when he hears the familiar sound of the machine signalling it has finished doing its job, the engineer — mind still reeling with formulas and coming up with specs for the new Black Widow suit he has in mind — absentmindedly reaches for the coffee pot.
“I’m gonna check the portal and see if there’s a way we can close it from our side,” Tony announces over the comms. He hears a chorus of agreement before he switches to his private channel. “J, what are your readings on the portal? Any chance we can shut it down before more of those ugly warships come out and play?”
“Aye,” Thor agrees with a solemn nod. The new arrivals join Steve on the couch, Bruce sitting in the middle as the Asgardian prince adds, “We have all made mistakes, thus we are now paying the price for it. But it does not do to dwell on the past for we may lose sight of the gift we have in front of us. That is to say that you do not have to shoulder this burden alone, Steven. You have us to help you carry the weight, and Anthony has us to aid him in his recovery.”
“And you’re too stubborn, Tony Stark,” Steve quips back with a raised brow. He hears Clint cough loudly to cover his laugh. Even Natasha is smirking at him as the redhead picks up another handgun from her pile to clean next.
, Mjölnir acknowledges, amusement laced in her tone.
Steve’s countenance sobers at that thought.
It only makes sense to add both songs to his growing playlist.
This was the longest, and toughest, to write. I also had to re-write some parts as I wasn't satisfied with the flow. Still, I hope it delivers. Enjoy reading!
Tony hasn’t told the others yet, even Steve who’s comforted him that night he made Tony hot cocoa. He knows the super soldier wants to ask Tony about that, and he doesn’t doubt that Steve’s told the others as well. Sheesh, it’s obvious that he has because the rest of his teammates recently had the tendency to hover around Tony. Not that Tony doesn’t appreciate the gesture — he does, especially that they’ve taken to keeping him company every time he’s in the common area. And honestly, Tony’s touched that they’re going out of their way to befriending him. But he can’t help but be saddened by the fact that it had to take Tony being hit with an alien weapon for them to treat him with kindness and respect. To treat him like he
Steve rolls his eyes but quickly types a response and hits send.
“Once again, sir, I must reiterate,” JARVIS answers, resigned. “I wouldn’t consider him a role model.”
“Thanks, Steve.” Tony looks at him through his lashes, the dimple on his cheeks prominent.
“Nothing. Just felt like indulging him.”
“I don’t know.”
Steve’s lips twitch as he says, “That’s too much dairy, though, don’t you think?”
Steve turns and looks over his shoulder, the two assassins looking up at the physicist who’s just stepped out of the elevator, Thor half a step behind him.
“Pepper, c’mon. Please don’t — I just… I didn’t want to burden you.”
Anyway, back to The Avengers.
“Why were you sleeping here?” Tony tilts his head in curiosity.
“I hope that, too,” Pepper agrees. After a beat, she adds, “I know it hasn’t been easy, but thank you for looking after him.”
Thank you for your support, it truly means a lot.
“What has you so troubled, dear?”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve murmurs back, and Tony hears the love he feels reciprocated in the other man’s tone and mouth. And god, what a talented mouth he has.
There’s no doubt that he’s grinning like a lovesick fool this time, so Steve types a quick response and sends it before shutting his phone and finally settling in for a good night’s sleep.
Thor nods solemnly in agreement, and Clint, looking more ashamed of his actions by the second, opens and closes his mouth a few times before he deflates.
Holy crap. I was
Some days, he thinks this is a gift that the universe has bestowed upon him. He’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, after all.
“Sir?”
Steve doesn’t remember how he and his teammates ended up in a karaoke bar at ten o’clock on a chilly October night, but the super soldier thinks that it has to do with the stressful week they had in tracking down one of the HYDRA bases SHIELD discovered. With another successful raid under their belt, Steve knows they more than deserve this night off.
Tony frowns, perplexed at the confidence he sensed in her tone.
Unbeta'd. Enjoy reading!
,” Rhodey says with a groan.
he feels, spreading from the inside out. He’s never felt that before until today. And it isn’t until he’s stripping out of his sweat-soaked clothes that he realizes the phantom pressure in his chest is absent.
“Hey, Pep,” he greets.
,” Tony groans out loud, horrified that
“Who hit him, anyway?”
“I can’t believe that just came out of your mouth,” Clint cackles.
“What if we have Thor hit the source with lightning?”
“Accept it, babe,” the blond mutters against Tony’s cheek as he presses another kiss. “We’ve always known you’re worthy. It’s just now the rest of the world is finally aware of it, too.”
Hmm, that’s some food for thought.
“About damn time you got here,” Tony calls out, waving his chopsticks in the air in greeting. Steve smiles when the engineer adds, “C’mon, Spangles, I saved you the last box of orange chicken.”
Everyone collectively breathes out a sigh of relief upon hearing JARVIS’ distinct voice.
There’s a note of regret in JARVIS’ voice when he says, “I’m afraid so, sir.”
He’s no Steve Rogers, he’s not a tactician. Sometimes, the only way through is, well, through.
“She doesn’t want to spar, does she? ‘Cos I’m still recovering from our last training session.” Tony sounds skeptical, and considering his injuries there’s no way he’d be fit to fight— wait.
“Even like this?” Tony replies shakily, doubt laced in his tone.
“Where you slow pokes at?” He starts by way of greeting. “You’re missing all the fun in this party.”
Thor’s expression clears. “Ah. But you mentioned earlier that the increase of his brain activity at night is similar to when a person is awake.”
“I’m afraid there are, Dr. Banner,” JARVIS replies, and Steve blinks because it shouldn’t be possible for an AI to sound so… solemn.
Bruce snorts while Tony laughs, the latter swatting a hand on Steve’s bicep as he leans against the super soldier in mirth.
Tony slightly cocks his head, and he winks at Steve as he croons those words.
Thor and Natasha remain silent, the latter's lips pursed in thought as she studies Tony through narrowed eyes.
Tony doesn’t reply, and Steve understands, because then, the engineer lets out a whimper as he gives out another full body shudder. And Steve, feeling helpless, holds him tighter in response.
Pepper's slender fingers fly over the keyboard for a few moments before the monitor shows a mainframe that features a lot of codes and colors. Just looking at it is enough to give Steve a migraine. The redhead CEO types some more before another window opens and the rest can see the two-step authentication Bruce found earlier.
“Jesus Christ, Barton, shut the fuck up,” Natasha snarls over the comms. “I don’t know whether to be jealous that you get to see Tony in action — great, I’m starting to sound like you — or you get to sit pretty up high. Either you continue calling out patterns or just. Shut. Up.”
A lopsided smile forms on Tony’s face before he can stop it.
He jumps from the taxi in time to avoid a blast from the energy-based weapon the Chitauri are equipped with. Landing lightly on his feet, he eyes at least a dozen of them approaching him from all sides, and Tony doesn’t hesitate to utilize the one-time only laser. Moments later multiple bodies drop to the ground, and at the same time he hears the telltale whirring of his suit approaching. Thanking all the deities he could think of in that moment, Tony deactivates the wrist gauntlets before leaping into position as the suit wraps around him like a glove. The HUD comes online and, now patched through the team’s communications system, Tony instantly makes his presence known as he shoots to the sky and takes down a dozen more Chitauri in his wake.
“I can help if you want me to,” Tony says, voice tight.
For Tony and Nat.
. It requires a two-step authentication, and none of us have the clearance to the codes.”
A few minutes later, Steve’s phone buzzes in his hand. He looks at the notification and sees that Tony has sent him another photo. Steve wets his lips and opens the message.
“Okay, that’s decided, then,” Steve also nods. He exhales loudly before he runs a hand through his short blond locks. “Meeting adjourned. Let’s all get some rest now.”
“I won’t do it again,” he promises them. His eyes land on Steve’s for a second longer. “I promise. I just… needed to get away.”
“Yo assholes, this one’s for you,” Clint says into the mic just as the notes of a familiar song start to play.
“Yes, please. Just in case,” he eventually answers after a few moments.
He hears Tony grunt in acknowledgement before he twists his upper body, hand reaching out for the milk jug. Then, out of nowhere, Clint’s ears pick up the whooshing sound of
But that still doesn’t make sense why he has Mjölnir in his grasp, though.
Steve really should’ve interrupted Clint the moment he opened his mouth.
Alice in Wonderland,
It isn’t until he hears Thor’s loud, booming voice that Steve jolts from his daydreaming.
“Thor, buddy, d’you mind if I speed things up? I don’t want to risk more of those things coming through the portal.”
they agreed upon. How could they be so careless? In a forced calm tone, Steve addresses the AI. “JARVIS, where is Tony?”
Nothing Matters When We're Dancing - The Magnetic Fields
Tony sighs and rubs his eyes. “Hey, J. Any reason why Thor thought to leave his hammer here in the first place?”
Nobody moves or speaks for a long time after their teammate’s departure, each lost in thought as they individually ran over everything Tony just revealed to them in their befuddled minds. Steve’s mind is still stuck on the
Right. Well, that was easier than expected.
He finds himself stumbling to the ground, but before his knees could hit the pavement he feels strong, familiar arms wrap around his trembling form. Tony catches a whiff of aftershave and tangerines and thinks,
of what we’ll discover about the weapon.”
Tony just blinks. He’s not gonna deign him with an answer ‘cos, well.
! What happened just now was, was — it was more than disturbing, okay!”
The old woman chuckles as she carefully perches herself on the warm stone bench beside Tony. Her back is straight, and she positions her cane between them. They sit together in peaceful silence, Tony observing the skyline and the calm waters before him.
“Is that statement meant to comfort me?”
Steve smiles against Tony’s dark locks, pressing another lingering kiss before he simply says, “You’re welcome.”
“But he is not,” Thor interjects sadly. “That is not the Anthony I know, and his current behavior only serves to concern me more about his well-being.”
, and not his
busiest person Steve’s ever known in this century, but it’s apparent that Tony is one of the most caring and supportive people Steve has the privilege to know.
Then the Chitauri Invasion of 2012 happened. That’s when The Avengers first banded together to help defeat Loki and the aliens. Not long after that, his relationship with Pepper ended after she watched him fly a nuke up through a worm hole from the TV screen. That act of self-sacrifice he pulled was the last proverbial straw that broke Pepper’s back, and Tony wasn’t the least bit surprised when she broke up with him. True, he was hurt, and he went on a week-long bender after that, but see, the thing is that Pepper
Tony’s broken out of his thoughts as he turns his head to look at the elderly woman, who’s staring at him kindly. They’re such kind eyes, Tony thinks, filled with compassion and wisdom. He finds himself swallowing past the small lump that’s suddenly lodged his throat.
“It is to normal people, but this is Tony we’re talking about. He tackles every problem with enthusiasm and passion, regardless of the danger it poses.”
This time, Tony doesn’t fight back the yawn, so the super soldier has to wait several seconds before he can get a response.
“Yeah, okay. But how closer?”
Steve thinks he’s never loved this man more than in that moment.
“You’re just jealous, Katniss,” Tony retorts playfully.
But it’s fine. It was a small price to pay for this kind of freedom. The anonymity is… nice. It’s more than nice, it’s
Once he has also unbuttoned Steve’s shirt and carelessly throws it somewhere behind him, Tony belatedly thinks,
Tony wonders to himself.

Tony hums. “Just peachy, Cap.”
Yeah yeah. You should sleep now too, it’s almost 3am there.
Moving in sync, he and Steve stand back to back to fight the onslaught of Chitauri, the clang of Steve’s shield hitting its targets with precision before it soars back to him in time for Tony to swivel and aim his repulsors at the shield, the trajectory of the blast taking down a significant number of their enemy.
butler — turns on the air-condition. Tony doesn’t know how long he was asleep, but it must’ve been for several hours if the darkening sky is anything to get by. “W-what time is it?”
Steve’s throat is dry and tight, and he has the feeling that he won’t like what he’ll hear next. But God, he needs to know. He needs to understand. They all do.
Tony flushes at Steve's stunned look. He quickly waves it off, feeling a little self-conscious then.
Steve chuckles and kisses Tony’s other cheek.
— know is still in there.”
So Tony’s been trying his goddamned best in reaching out to his fellow teammates, trying to connect and bond with them, or however the fuck normal people say it. He’s even invited them to live in his Tower after he’s done re-constructing the damages done to it, to which the two assassins, a nuclear physicist, a super soldier, and a Norse god accepted. Now, a year and half a later, the engineer’s relationship with his teammates hasn’t grown or developed into how he wants — or even expects — it to be.
The elevator dings to the floor where their uniforms and gears are located, Tony hangs back inside as the rest of the Avengers step off of the lift to suit up. Steve also hangs back and watches Natasha brush her fingers along Tony’s waist. Clint and Thor clap him on the back on their way out, and even Bruce squeezes his shoulder with a parting smile at the genius.
Steve smiles sympathetically at the engineer, his heart thumping against his ribcage when Tony smiles back at him with sleep-soft eyes. More often than not, Steve finds himself aching with the need to
“It’s two-thirty in the afternoon, sir,” JARVIS helpfully provides.
You’re Tony Stark. Your name carries weight, naturally, but what you’ve done and accomplished isn’t what makes you
, that would physically connect Steve to the gorgeous man beside him. His fingers itch with the need to run his hands through Tony’s bedhead, or wrap an arm around his shoulders until the shorter man is pressed flushed against his side with his face tucked into the crook of Steve’s neck.
“Where’s the med team?”

“Oh, Tony. You didn’t have to go through all this.”
How sneaky and clever, Steve muses with a shake of his head. But before anyone can voice their queries, Clint’s voice comes next.
There’s a short pause before the AI responds. “There is a portal that opened near the Chrysler Building. Based from the heat signatures, the creatures that are stepping out from it are the same from that day when Sir was hit.”
Tony lets that information sink in first before he reacts.
“Welcome back, Sir.”
It’s alright. 😘
Steve blinks again before a smile slowly stretches across his face. “Good morning. Have you been standing there just staring at me?”
Hey, you. Just got back at the hotel.
? For a second, the super soldier didn’t know who to be jealous of more — his teammate or his teammate’s sentient weapon?
Tony admits (if only to himself) that he is a lot less emotionally intelligent than he wants to be, but he’s
“Reverting back to the previous time we fought them, sir, it is logical to conclude that we can only close the portal by destroying the source from where the device is located. The heat signature is coming strongest from outside the portal. Unless there’s another nuclear missile, chances of closing the portal are slim to none.”
“I’ll change your coding so you’ll never conspire against me again.”
, too. For God’s sake, I’m not incapable of emotions; I feel them just as strongly as you do — but I hide them better than most. And yeah, it’s probably a mistake to do that. But that doesn’t give you the right to talk to me, or even
There’s blatant fear in those whiskey-colored eyes, but Tony juts his chin. A small gesture to appear strong in front of them.
“What the hell, man?” Clint demands after several moments. He peers doubtfully at the engineer, who is yet to look up from his bowl of decimated oatmeal. “Stark, this is the same weapon that fucking hit you and knocked you out for three days before you
Thank you again for reading. Hope you enjoyed the ride. 'Till the next adventure!
Ugh, he’s so far gone on this man, it’s not even a joke.
Steve bites his lip, then he pulls up the camera app on his phone and selects the front-camera feature. Normally, Steve is not a fan of taking pictures of himself, but just this once he’ll indulge the genius. Mussing up his hair a bit, Steve angles his phone up and does his best version of a puppy pout. Lower lip jutting out nicely and blue eyes wide and innocent-looking.
Steve gulps inaudibly, and even he feels a shiver down his spine when he says, “I recall after you asked Tony for another MRI that I overheard him say something about
Clint stares at him with a raised eyebrow. “Y’know, that day we were both in the kitchen and I asked you to put the milk back in the fridge. Then you thrust your hand out and then Mjölnir, well,
Jerking in surprise, Steve blinks and lets out a shaky breath before he runs a hand through his hair, cursing when he realizes that he used the hand that was smudged with charcoal.
Enjoy reading this chapter. It's quite self-indulgent.
That irks the engineer, but his relief in seeing a familiar face, and one who Tony knows genuinely cared about him when he was still alive, is far greater than letting his annoyance at not getting the answer he wants get to him. So instead, Tony just nods his head and clears his throat.
Steve feels despondent that it’s taken him this long to realize all of that, more so for Tony to get hurt to make the super soldier see that he’s been seeing the engineer through different lenses. Somehow, life’s pretty wise like that. In order to truly understand a person, one of them would have to go through something really terrible — or really well, depending on the circumstance — to have the other’s eyes opened to the truth that has been in front of them all along.
He has Mjölnir in his hand.
Then he blinks again.
Steve gulps. That can’t be good.
“I can’t.
Tony’s brows furrow in confusion. “Guide me? To where? Wait — is this some Alice in Wonderland kind of shit? But, like, a creepier version of it. I fell down the rabbit hole and now I’m Alice while you’re the White Rabbit?”
“Tony, JARVIS— anything?” Steve asks as the group slowly approaches the creatures.
, I wanna see Tony do it again!”
Tony pats his back before they both pull away after a few moments. “It’s nothing, Steve. Besides, it wasn’t just me! The rest of the team pitched in, too.”
There was a lull in their conversation, albeit a comfortable one, only to be broken by Tony who requested JARVIS to “drop his needle”. It isn’t until Steve hears the familiar riffs of a song the genius frequently listens to in his workshop that he understands what he meant by that phrase.
“J, turn off the air-condition for me,” Tony requests.
“Me, too,” Steve concurs, not caring in the slightest that he’s smiling sappily at the other man.
, if that makes sense, and Tony knew then that they were still going to be okay. Still, he loved her so much and it fucking hurt, but it’s all water under the bridge.
This time, the silence that follows is one of shock as everyone turns to stare at the engineer. Even Thor is gawking down at Tony, bits and pieces of pop tarts visible from his gaping mouth. Eyes wide in shock, Steve swivels his head to look at Bruce, the physicist’s eyebrows raised high into his hairline, clearly taken aback by what he just heard.
When everyone’s settled down on the couches, Steve gestures for Bruce to take the floor. The physicist nods at him once before he begins.
Thank you for all your lovely comments — I promise to reply to you all tomorrow!
He knows now what to give Steve for his birthday.
“Hey! There were several things going on at the same time, so forgive me if I didn’t have both of my eyes focused on Stark as I was a bit preoccupied not getting stabbed in the gut.”
“How long was I asleep?”
I understand that to you, I’m just some rich guy who builds suits of armor for fun and you’re only tolerating me because I give you what you want, plus you’re all living in my Tower rent-free. I get it, I really do. But in case you forgot, I’m
Tony shrugs one shoulder. “Fair enough. It could’ve gone worse, to be honest. And besides, I’m used to being in the limelight, anyway, it’s just…” He trails off with another shrug.
Steve musters a small but genuine smile and turns his head to look at Tony, but the greeting dies on his lips when he sees the haunted look in the engineer’s eyes.
“Oh.”
“The Other Guy would gladly smash him around again,” Bruce remarks, and there’s an underlying note of promise in his tone.
“I have to disagree with you on that last bit, Captain. The way you, and the others, have treated him the past year and a half prior to his accident say otherwise.”
“‘Night, Tony.”
It’s Tony, however, who remains calm and unaffected. Although there’s a small crease between his brows, and he appears to be lost in thought as he ponders on Steve’s questions.
But that’s not what surprises Tony the most.
“Sweet dreams, Tony,” Steve’s voice calls out softly to Tony’s retreating back.
It’s late in the night and Steve’s still wide awake. Fortunately, it’s not because of a nightmare that kept him up, but rather he was struck by inspiration to draw.
“I’m in Tony’s bedroom. His phone is here but his wallet is missing.”
Steve is left more confused because he doesn’t get the reference.
“Tony?” Steve utters instead, concern seeping into his voice as he carefully stands up from the couch. When Tony doesn’t speak, only continues to look at Steve with the same tormented look, he adds in a softer tone, as if he’s talking to a wounded animal. “What is it?”
Steve and Thor laugh out loud when Bruce, Tony, and Nat simultaneously raise their middle fingers to Clint, the archer blowing each of them a kiss before he starts to sing in a surprisingly good voice.
Glancing up, Tony sees more Chitauri advancing towards him from above. Many have leapt to the ground and are sprinting towards Tony, who doesn’t hesitate to hurl Mjölnir at the nearest alien bastard. The hammer hits it right across the chest, Mjölnir not breaking her momentum as she proceeds to take down a dozen more before she soars back to Tony’s outstretched hand.
There's a huge lump in Tony's throat when he croaks out, “Jarvis?”
But not all hope is lost, Tony thinks as an idea — a crazy, stupid,
Centering himself, Tony takes a deep breath and exhales slowly. He stretches his fingers before lightly pressing them on the keys, playing a few random notes to prep himself.
“Not all good-byes have to be sad.” Steve hears Tony say in time. He blinks and inclines his head at Tony, who sighs almost wistfully as brown doe eyes roam around the spacious hall.
Tony blinks and looks up to meet kind blue eyes. It’s an old woman, probably in her eighties, and she’s dressed comfortably in walking shoes, brown slacks and a woolen cardigan over a blouse. Her greying hair is fixed into a neat bun, and there’s a wooden cane clutched in her wrinkled left hand. Tony notes a thick gold band around her ring finger.
When several seconds pass and Steve continues to remain quiet, eyes still wide and mouth slightly agape, Tony bites his lower lip and starts to fidget in his seat.
“America’s Ass?” Steve’s brain short-circuited for the second time that night because
The thing is, Tony has so much love to give. But he doesn’t know how the fuck to do it and how to do it right. He has a poor judge of character, yes, but he also knows that when he meets the right person — or in this case,
— seals his lips over Tony's in a gentle kiss.
The memory of the day he woke up comes to mind, and he recalls what he said. About something missing. It’s not his arc reactor, obviously, since it’s still there. Has always been there.
“Sir—”
“Why's that, JARVIS? Is it lower than the last diagnosis Bruce did?”
This time, there’s a note of concern in JARVIS’ voice when he answers, “Sir, I would recommend you to take a shower and then take a nap. Your current vitals show that you’re heavily fatigued.”
“Oh my God, please stop,” Steve moans.
. Still, he doesn’t say anything as he sets the dirty mugs in the sink, aware of Tony’s eyes boring into the back of his head.
“Tony,” he begins. He shuffles closer to the engineer and, haltingly, rests a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. It takes a second before he feels the latter relax further under his touch. “You and I both know I’m not that type of doctor. I’m not gonna be uttering platitudes that won’t even mean anything.” Tony snorts, and Bruce is pleased when the engineer shoots him a tiny smirk. “But you’re my friend, so let me just say my piece and we’ll never speak of this again if that’s your wish.” At Tony’s reluctant nod, Bruce continues. “Sometimes, you fail to see the simple things as they are because you’re too busy looking at the bigger picture. Not that it’s a bad thing; it goes to show that you’re only human — flawed, yes, but still human. Every so often your head is so far up your ass that you forget you’re no longer the person you were before Afghanistan. Even after all these years, you still carry the weight of other people’s mistakes on your shoulders, and you’re still atoning for the sins you’ve committed, even if half — or most — of it wasn’t your fault to begin with. Yes, you’re a mess and a walking disaster, and also a pain in the ass, but who isn’t?
They’re quiet again after that, both of them facing the other with a hip leaning against the counter as they continue to sip their drinks. Unsurprisingly, Steve is the first to finish off his, but he waits for Tony to drain his mug before he takes it from the engineer’s hands. When his fingers accidentally brush against Tony’s, Steve jerks in surprise and he almost drops the mug because
“Bruce? You okay, buddy?”
“Tony! How about a friendly spar with me?” Thor booms excitedly as he fully enters the gym. With Mjölnir in his grasp, he doesn’t miss the light tingling in his fingers when his dear hammer senses Tony’s presence.
Tony takes his time chewing his food and only answers the antsy super soldier once he’s swallowed.
Without further ado, piano starts to play before a soulful voice starts to croon across the impressive speakers.
Steve.
Life goes on for these people, and there’s the familiar ache in Tony’s chest that has made itself known since he got hit by that alien weapon. A longing, a yearning. For something. Something which Tony has always craved for.
Tony inhales and exhales several times until he’s breathing a little easier. Although the heaviness is still present in his chest, it’s a bit subdued now. And yet, the emptiness he’s felt upon waking up nearly a week ago is a constant reminder of Tony’s current predicament. Sure, he’s felt this way hundreds of times before — but for some unfathomable reason that the engineer can’t think of yet, this time is a lot worse.
“Steeeeeve!” Tony whines, and Steve snorts at the childish pout on his face. It should be a crime to look that adorable, damn it. “Alright, fine. I know the owner and I may or may not have been there a couple of times around this time.”
“I’m not a fucking damsel in distress, Steve,” Tony snaps back.
There is a slight pause before the AI responds, “Of course, sir.”
Because he’s doing this for Steve, and it’s Tony’s
to start and how.
Fuck, he’s miscalculated this time, and he quickly needs to reassess everything.

“Love you, too, Tones, but —”
Unbeta'd. Enjoy reading!
He hears voices over the comms but Tony can’t discern what his teammates are saying. Between one breath and the next, he allows a predatory grin to grace his face before he lets pure instinct take over.
Addressing the AI, Bruce continues, “JARVIS, does this often happen to Tony when he’s in this state?”
In the end, it takes him a few seconds to process Steve’s words, the latter silently gazing at him with an inexplicable expression.
look on Tony’s face.
Suddenly, he’s struck with a forceful wave of despair and hopelessness, and combined with the sinking void he’s already feeling, there’s nothing else Tony can do except to squeeze his eyes shut and stifle a sob.
As an answer, they hear the loud rumbling of thunder and the crackle of lightning before the Asgardian comes into view in his typical, outlandish way by sending a bolt of lightning to at least half a dozen Chitauri.
“Uh, maybe? But like, in a non-creepy way.”
Tony smirks, looking up at Steve for a brief moment. “The kid’s been begging me for months to play his work playlist.”
I'm terribly sorry for the late update. My depression was triggered last week and it took me a while to recover. Given the nature of this story, I opted to take a break. I'm feeling better now, but I'm still taking it easy. This chapter took me longer to finish, but I hope it delivers.
“Sir, there are two more Leviathan ships escaping through the portal,” JARVIS announces over the team comms. “Hulk is currently engaged with the first Leviathan while Mr. Odinson is clearing the path for the civilians on 5th Avenue.”
“With that mouth, I can think of a dozen ways to put it to good use.”
“Duh, it is. It’s open ‘till 3.”
— he gets cured from whatever’s happening to him, that there’s a great chance he’ll also end up losing them. Because like it or not, Tony has more experience with people walking out of his life than staying in it.
“Yes, sir,” is the dry response of his sassy AI.
“Like your go-to pick-me-up,” Tony supplies helpfully.
“You guess?” Natasha repeats with a raised brow.
apologized to the engineer, saying that he had nothing to be sorry for, and that it was the archer’s fault for being insensitive to his situation.
,” the redhead snarls next. Again, Steve’s not sorry to admit that he feels satisfaction curl in his gut when he sees Clint hunch his shoulders in shame. “We agreed to
Everyone nods and files out, set on checking the designated rooms. They’re less than five minutes into their search for their wayward teammate when Natasha’s voice comes via their comms.
“That day wasn’t the first time I wielded M,” Tony reveals lightheartedly, relishing in the view of their jaws dropping open in shock at his words. Rubbing his neck, a trait he likely adapted from Steve, Tony continues. “Yeah, the first time it happened was nearly three weeks before that day, and I did it by accident."
Mjölnir tells him one day when Tony makes a hasty escape when he spotted Thor casually swinging the hammer in the kitchen island as the Asgardian munches on his third box of hot sundae pop tarts.
“Any second now, boys,” Natasha says, surprised that she still manages to sound calm.
(See the end of the chapter for
Oh, Steve’s perfectly aware that he swings both ways, though his preference leans more towards the male spectrum. But his bisexuality isn’t the reason why he’s been having strange, unnameable feelings towards Tony. No, not at all. He’s still figuring things out on his own, and Steve hopes that the current predicament they’re in will also help shed a light on, well, pretty much everything. From Tony and his unusual behavior to Steve embarking on uncharted territories by befriending the one person he’s secretly been hoping to connect with.
“What glitch? What are you talking about?” Clint inquires with a befuddled expression.
“Hey, honey,” Tony answers sweetly, and though he’s in the midst of battle he can’t help the flutter in his chest upon hearing his boyfriend’s — they’re
. I think… there’s a possibility that Thor’s hypothesis has merit now.”
From the corner of his eye, he notes the stiffening of Tony’s shoulders, the other man’s jaw clenching for a moment before he slowly breathes out through his nose.
Specifically, at Tony who’s looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
“Oh my god,
Tony blushes, thankful that it’s just the two of them. He caresses the hammer’s face with a fondly exasperated look.
If possible, JARVIS’ voice turns drier as the AI says, “You shifted your checklist in order to prioritize the deadlines for Stark Industries as well as the repairs and upgrades for the team’s gear. It went from number three to number eighteen, sir.”
Still, regardless of those factors that make up a semblance of their day-to-day life in the Tower, Steve can’t help but be ashamed that he hasn’t really actively (or genuinely, for that matter) taken the initiative to
“Yeah, we’re here for you, man,” Clint adds reassuringly.
She looks exhausted and distraught, Steve observes, feeling sympathy for the woman who’s quite literally running the whole company and doing so with efficiency and style in deadly six-inched heels.
“I concur,” Thor agrees, a frown on his face as he digests Bruce’s words. “Those creatures are not from the Nine Realms, and I must return to Asgard to consult with the Allfather about this. Something tells me that magic could also be involved. However, I shall remain first to observe Anthony and see if his condition will improve or not before I leave.”
If it were possible to virtually send you a hug right now, you know I would in a heartbeat.
“Happy birthday, Dorito!” He greets, and inwardly cringes at how exuberant he sounded just then.
“What the hell was that?”
Natasha finds herself on her back with Tony in the Iron Man suit lying several feet to her right. She shuts her eyes against the searing pain in her leg, and she takes several deep breaths and ignores the panicked voices of her fellow teammates shouting over each other before she opens her eyes and glances down her body.
moment.
“You okay?”
“In-between? In-between what?” Natasha inquires as she straightens in her seat.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about, Rogers,” Clint quips back as he takes a huge bite of his slice of pepperoni pizza.
“Precisely.”
. Tony, Clint, and Thor tag-teamed and baked a two-tier chocolate cake that ended up looking slightly burnt, yet it tasted delicious. Tony also dealt with the drinks; thankfully, he had a cellar located in the mansion he used to live growing up. He’s no connoisseur, but Tony has an extensive taste and knowledge, and since it was Steve’s first year in the twenty-first century that time, the engineer took three bottles of Macallan 1947 (
to sleep — if I’m going to solve this problem. So please. Turn it off.”
“Yeah, what he said,” Clint agrees with a thumbs up towards Thor, who smiles widely at the archer in return.
Steve is bringing up the rear so he sees Clint reach the living room first and he picks up the StarkPad Tony’s been seen using recently from one of the couches.
“J, where are they?” Tony inquires as he jumps on the roof of an abandoned taxi and starts shooting repulsor blasts at the aliens closest to him.
“On your six, Tin Man,” Clint’s worried voice cuts in. “Though they’re not even running, more like walking leisurely towards you. What the hell.”
“What do you need?” he asks next. When Tony looks up to meet his eyes, Steve adds, “Please, Tony. Allow me to help you. I — please let me help you, in any way I can. What do you need?”
“My gift?”
“Lasagne and Korean BBQ chicken,” Steve answers with a knowing grin aimed at the teen.
“Don’t know what’s there to learn more about,” Tony eventually utters, sounding indifferent but Bruce knows better now. “Forged in the heart of a dying star, right? That’s what Thor said. Created with magic and all that jazz. Nothing further to learn, really.”
Ah, if the All-Father could see this, Thor believes that he would, as Midgardians say it,
And it’s not just your typical hammer. Specifically, he’s holding Thor’s hammer.
“Sleep now.”
“Steve,” Tony answers patiently. With another raised brow, Steve smothers a laugh when the engineer sighs dramatically and wiggles his outstretched fingers to him. “There’s a diner a few blocks from here. Let’s go.”
“Alarm has already been set, sir,” the AI swiftly cuts, sounding amused.
Mjölnir says with undisguised glee.
Tony looks at him with something close to understanding, for the other man replies, “Hey, no. It’s fine, no need to apologize. I mean, I’m probably the last person who’s gonna admit this, but I can’t imagine what this must be like for you.”
“Thor, what —” Tony exclaims, trepidation written plainly over his sweaty face.
2. I considered writing an epilogue, but I figured it wasn't ideal. However, if you weren't satisfied with the conclusion and would want to see more Stony content, I wouldn't mind writing a short one.
Thor spent more than an hour regaling them with tales of the battles he fought in Asgard along with Sif and The Warriors Three. His storytelling only came to an end when he started to shamelessly recount what transpired
Thor shrugs, an uncharacteristic gesture from the Nordic god. “I am uncertain as to Mjölnir’s intentions, but she is insistent that I take her to you.”
“Yeah, I know. They’re going to tear me a new one, and with Pep with them…”
“Oh, thank God.”
It’s not like it’s gonna happen again.
“Yeah, sure, I’d love to,” he finally answers before accepting Tony’s offered hand.
One glance at the clock shows Steve that Tony’s right. He’ll wrap up his conversation with Tony, finish his lukewarm tea, and then go to sleep.
Steve shares a glance with Pepper across the room, the CEO currently involved in what looked to be an intense discussion with Natasha and Bruce. Pepper offers a smile at Steve, who quickly returns it before focusing his attention on Tony once more lest the genius thinks he’s not paying attention.
“Remember that thing we did before, J?” Tony flippantly reminds his AI. “The tale of Jonah?”
“Who was with Tony before we had that meeting?” Bruce addresses them. “I was obviously in my lab.”
“You’re not,” Steve’s firm voice comes next. “And even if you are — which you’re
Steve casts a glance at the ceiling — he’s never gonna break that habit, no matter how much Clint teases him — with a small smile before he enters the elevator, the doors closing almost at once.
“You’re incredible.”
Tony is silent. He’s secretly impressed at the insightfulness of the elderly woman, and god forbid if she were a few decades younger. SHIELD would hire her on the spot.
Tilting his head in curiosity, Tony now takes note of the slight humming he feels in the hand that’s still firmly clutched around the handle of the weapon. Momentarily forgetting about his caffeine fix, Tony’s lips quirk into a bittersweet smile as he eyes Mjölnir.
Natasha is quick to respond. “Wait. We can check the surveillance cameras and trace the car’s plate to the last location.”
“Sure. Yeah. You’ll be dazzled. I hope. Right, okay. I’m off to make some rounds with the guests again, so enjoy your party, Cap. Don’t drink anything Clint gives you.”

Okay, so maybe Steve could’ve written that one better. But it’s not like he’s had experience

Steve shakes his head with a small smile.

“‘Kay.”
“Sorry to be a disappointment, Rogers. I’m perfectly aware that I’ve got a laundry list of issues. Some days I hide it well, some days I don’t. And I’m so fucking sick and tired of everyone treating me like I’m like some delicate piece of china that’s gonna break every five fucking minutes. You may claim to know me, but as a matter of fact you
Steve swallows inaudibly, and he has to bite his lower lip to stop himself from reprimanding the stubborn engineer. It’s only when he hears the desperate plea in Tony’s tone that Steve gives in with a defeated nod. The worry continues to build up, and he starts to feel the familiar weight pressing in his chest as he helplessly watches Tony clench his fists by his sides as his body continues to tremble.
“Yes.”
I miss you, too. Are you okay?
Tony’s not really a complicated person. He just
that kind of doctor, but Tony is one of his best friends and he deeply cares about the guy. So Bruce decides then that he will no longer allow Tony to wallow in this state on his own.
“Does it have to do with… what happened?” the physicist asks carefully.
“Not a chance in hell,” Clint answers with a shit-eating grin as he scrolls through his Twitter feed using the latest StarkPhone. “Give it a couple more weeks. Or months.”
“Sir only experiences tachycardia when he sleeps this fitfully, Dr. Banner,” JARVIS replies after a slight pause. “Reviewing previous scans from the past three weeks since sir’s accident, data indicates that when he’s not going through this episode, his heart rate is that of a normal human being’s.”
— is what keeps him going. Call it motivation, call it another reason to get up in the morning, but it is what it is. And what it is, to Tony, is the most essential part of his life.
“I don’t know. I just know something important’s missing, and it hurts. Bruce, how can it hurt when I’ve never had it to begin with?”
Breathing out slowly, and shakily, Tony clears his throat before gently setting the hammer down in the same place he vaguely recalls it was located. He quickly cleans the countertop of the shattered remains of the mug before he takes out another one from the cupboard. Careful to not mistake the coffee pot for another object (or weapon), Tony pours the thankfully still searing hot coffee into his new mug.
Tony was so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t realize he was quiet for too long, causing Pepper’s already concerned expression to deepen, the beautiful woman’s face scrunching up further. When he feels a gentle hand settle on his shoulder, Tony jerks slightly and looks up. Though startled at the contact, he finds himself leaning into Pepper’s touch, welcoming the familiar touch with a small sigh.
You live your whole life looking over your shoulder to see who would backstab you, only to realize at the last second it was right in front of you all along.
). Which, no surprise, they all finished within two hours.
“Um. You’ve been staring at the fridge for the past three minutes now. Are you okay?”
Wait, that’s Star Wars.
approaching from behind. But before he can move or react, Clint witnesses the whole thing in slow-motion.
“No, it means that not everything is about you,” Natasha intervenes, but there’s a quirk in her lips that means she’s teasing Steve.
, Steve welcomes the feeling of pride and joy that washes over him. Pulled from his thoughts by the sound of Tony snorting, Steve spots the brunet shaking his head, a look of fond exasperation crossing over his face as he leans his hip against the edge of the worktable.
“I was at the gym,” Steve says, although panic is starting to build in his chest. Fuck, there should
Steve smiles a little lopsidedly at Tony as he shrugs and says, “Can’t sleep myself. How long have you been standing there?”
“You’re not making sense!”
Electricity crackles around him, the concrete splintering a distant sound as Tony’s vision whites out for a few moments before it clears. Between one breath and the next, Tony hears the ear-splitting sound of the last Leviathan as tendrils of lightning curl around its massive form like tentacles — piercing through the armor and burning its insides as well as the remaining Chitauri onboard.
who can activate JARVIS’s system.”
is already unpredictable to begin with, and he’s more so now.  I’m not saying I know the guy, but I observe people — comes with the job and all. All I’m saying is that, the way I see it, the best way to deal with
“Yeah, you did. You gave me a home and supported me in adjusting to a century I don’t belong in. Sometimes, I feel that I don’t deserve—”
Regardless of those facts, that doesn’t mean that Steve’s not gonna give as good as he gets.
“Hmm?”
Okay, so this is less science and more of an existential crisis, Bruce thinks in horror when he sees the tormented look in Tony’s eyes.
Despite feeling almost — happy — about the development of his relationship with each of the members of the team, Tony can’t help but think that if —
Wincing because he clearly pissed off his concerned AI, Tony forces those thoughts to the back of his mind in order to focus on the more important matter, like save New York from a second alien invasion.
“Tony, what’re you doing?” Bruce asks in between chuckles, one hand holding on to his drink while the other is clasped in Tony’s.
“I seriously didn’t need a mental image of Hulk’s nether regions,” Steve slightly reprimands Tony, but he knows he looks mischievous because Tony’s laughter soon subsides to chuckles.
“Beautiful, M,” Tony gushes fondly. Though he can’t see it, the genius feels a rush of warmth, and he thinks it’s Mjölnir’s way of blushing at the praise.
Much to Steve’s amusement, Tony, who’s probably only realized he’s said more than he’s meant to, fidgets in his seat and tries to wave it off. “Eh, it’s fine. Any good American citizen would’ve done the same.”
“You’re right. Thanks, Thor. That means a lot. We’ll only be able successfully help Tony if we do it together, so that’s what we should do, then.”
Okay, so Tony’s still in his undersuit. And Steve only noticed that
Another piece added to the puzzle that is Tony Stark. Yes, they’re nowhere near close to solving it, but considering the information that they just unearthed in this meeting, it’s evident that a picture is slowly being formed. This can be considered as a minor success, and Steve is not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Tony shoots the ceiling a fond smile before he looks down to meet Steve’s eyes. He claps a hand on one broad shoulder before he slowly (albeit reluctantly, though hopefully Steve doesn’t notice) pulls away from Steve’s firm but gentle hold on his arm.
He takes off his black blazer and throws it haphazardly towards one of the couches, rolling up the sleeves of his white button-down shirt up to his elbows as he takes a seat in front of the gleaming Steinway & Sons piano. Though he hasn’t played in several years, doing so the other day proved to Tony that he still got it. He knows he’s still a bit rough and would need to practice more, but for this one performance he’s rehearsed over and over again, Tony’s quite confident that he’ll do well. Ish.
(See the end of the chapter for
The creature shakes its head and then speaks in that same, foreign language. Then it slowly raises its arm. The arm that has the weapon that hit Tony in its tight grasp.
“Of course I did, Pep.” Tony scoffs and takes a sip of his scotch as his eyes survey the room.
Tony’s comically perplexed expression at the sight of Thor’s weapon served to break Bruce out of his shock as he laughs at the situation.
, Steve. I know when to concede defeat. Sometimes.”
Natasha shakes her head. “It’s fine. We understand.”
Tony gulps but he nods once.
Bruce frowns to himself and thinks that there must be more to this. Tony’s a scientist, after all. He wouldn’t just brush the whole thing off for no reason, consequences be damned. So whatever happened the first time he wielded Mjölnir in Clint’s presence, it must’ve been something big to even freak him out of experimenting on the hammer. In the name of science, of course.
Tony takes a deep breath and decides to just nip it in the bud. “I know it’s bad timing, but I need to borrow Mjölnir for a while.”
To be fair, this evening’s been eventful enough, so Steve’s more than willing to be a spectator of what he hopes is going to occur in the next five minutes.
Steve does his best not to stare at Tony’s profile, so he forces himself to stare at the New York skyline before them, the glass-to-ceiling windows serving its purpose of giving them a magnificent view.
. You’re far from fine.”
Steve tilts his head. “What changed?”
Bruce nods as he massages the bridge of his nose.
“Sir?”
“Thor?” Steve inquires as he turns to look at the demigod.
“Yes, Steve?” Tony answers calmly. His voice, usually laced with sarcasm or cleverness, is now filled with… nothing. Well,
Tony snorts, but there’s a grin on his face when he says, “Well, tough luck, buddy.” Then he fires up his thrusters to meet the Leviathan head on. “Once I’m in, unleash all the mini-missiles, J. Bottoms up, asshole.”
Well, Steve sure won’t be happy once he finds out Tony’s been on another engineering binge, Clint thinks with a snort. It’s bad enough he’s a witness to the duo’s unsubtle flirting, considering that they’re all living in the same building, and one of these days Clint swears he’s going to get fed up and lock those two up in a closet so they can fuck it out. That is, if Steve eventually grows a pair and decides to stop beating around the bush to make a move on Stark. God knows how much of a
No suit, no gauntlets — Tony’s more vulnerable than ever. Lungs burning and energy depleting by the second, he knows he won’t make it to Steve and Nat on time. The Chitauri are still approaching, and it doesn’t take a genius like Tony to figure out why they’re closing in on him in particular. They obviously want his head for what he did to their army four years ago.
Steve doesn’t hesitate to save the photo before reading the rest of his best friend’s message.
"Let them in, young man," she affirms with an earnest look in her kind eyes.
Knowing that Steve’s just humoring him, Tony rolls his eyes before he breaks out into a yawn. He covers his mouth with one hand, and he nearly gags when he accidentally smells his breath.
I'm overwhelmed by your response. Thank you so much for all the comments and kudos! This chapter is nearly thrice the length of the first, so I hope it lives up to your expectations. Enjoy!
part when he’s pulled from his thoughts by Clint breaking the stifling silence.
It doesn't last long.
Looks like it’ll be one of those nights, the super soldier thinks to himself.
Steve barks out a laugh as he drains his mug. He levels the genius with a look, and he knows the sincerity he feels is projected in his face because Tony’s eyes soften.
“Don’t be stupid, Clint. He was clearly referring to Mjölnir.”
Like as if Tony’s just given him the world. Like as if
“Disengage, J,” Tony swiftly cuts him off again as he punches a Chitauri in the guts before shooting him with a repulsor blast in the face. “Start the countdown for the suit’s self-destruct in two minutes once I’m out of it. That’s an order.” He adds in his sternest tone.
“Tony,” Steve starts, his voice soft and fond, and Tony feels his insides turn to jelly upon hearing that tone directed towards him.
“Yeah?” Tony says with a sniffle. “How do you suppose we’re gonna do that?”
, Thor. Jesus, it’s bad enough America’s Ass over there is hovering over me. I really don’t think this is necessary. Can’t you just tell Mjölnir that I’m perfectly alright and she should stop worrying?”
Tony is silent for several seconds.
“Raise the necessary alarms, J,” Tony huffs out as he dodges past a group of teenagers. “And send the Mark 35 along as well.”
His head downcast and eyes closed as he washes his hair with shampoo next, Tony’s not surprised to find his mind wandering to the cause of his current melancholy. So it’s nothing new that he caused another dramatic scene, and then made an even more dramatic exit.
“Ready, Winghead. Let’s go blow this popsicle stand.”
, there isn’t much he can do to fight off the army of Chitauri. Still, never let it be said that Tony will go down without a fight, because if there’s one thing the genius is, is that he’s a stubborn fighter ’till the very end. Sooner than he realized, he reaches the corner of 34th street and is greeted with the horrible sight of an enemy they once conquered four years ago.
. For all Tony knows, they’re probably worried that he’s going to have another dramatic outburst similar to this morning. If that’s the case, then fine, Tony can’t do anything about that.
He’s pulled from his thoughts when he hears Tony make a noise of agreement. Steve opens his eyes to see Tony looking at his drink as if it holds all the answers to life’s questions.
The elderly woman fixes Tony a sympathetic look.
“They’ll fail. Spectacularly.”
“Iron Man,” Steve’s voice comes next, and Natasha can’t help but roll her eyes (in fond exasperation, don’t get her wrong) at their leader’s insistence to use their codenames during battles. Not that they follow it, but sometimes they slip occasionally.
In the distance, Thor and Hulk’s figures jump from the ship in time to avoid being burned alive, though the former probably won’t be affected.
Across the room, Steve sees Nat surrender the microphone to Clint, whose animated expression does little to hide his drunken state.
, that he wasn’t just someone to give them shelter and make them weapons, and even buy whatever they fancied.
“Hey, guys,” Steve greets with a pointed look at Tony who looks back innocently. “Dinner’s ready in ten, so why don’t you both clean up first before coming up?”
Tony’s lips draw in a tight line, and his next reply comes a little strained. “You’re not wrong on that, Bruce. But I — that is — I’m just letting you know how it feels. Okay? But I don’t, um, really think it’s depression.”
“Because I’ve taken off his suit and he’s breathing. It’s labored and shallow, though, so he probably has a few broken ribs.”
A few years later, Steve hears those two songs again in separate occasions, and he finds himself reliving that night both times.
Steve chokes on his saliva while Tony guffaws at that bit of information. "Remind me when I'm sober to have JARVIS search for that."
Natasha and Bruce roll their eyes while Thor perks up at the word ‘parties’. Steve, however, shakes his head and sighs.
, I think I made a mistake taking those tequila shots with Clint. I lost count after six.”
“Okay,” Steve replies, amusement laced in his tone.
When Tony opens his eyes once more, it’s to see Steve eyeing him with concern.
Tony shrugs for the third time, eyes downcast as he plays with his food, turning his spoon around the middle until there’s a small hole before he mixes the oatmeal again and repeats the process.
When Bruce rights Tony, Steve meets the engineer’s eyes. Warmth blooms in Steve’s chest when he sees the happiness in Tony’s eyes. Sure, he’s a little tipsy at this point, but there’s no mistaking the relaxed limbs of the other man. Steve knows the hardships Tony’s going through these days — responsibilities at SI, the Avengers, his strained relationship with Pepper — and it’s humbling for the super soldier to know that Tony trusts
“Nobody takes me much for anything but a trouble maker.”
Thor, either oblivious to their small exchange or not, just grins down at Tony and holds Mjölnir up.
When Tony doesn’t pull away but blinks owlishly and looks up at him in shock at the gesture, it bolsters Steve’s confidence and he steps a few inches closer to the genius until their chests are half a foot apart.
If only he can know
getting compensated handsomely for dealing with my overbearing butt, though, right?”
The engineer hums again, this time with a smile at the endearment. He’s out like a light before his brain can fully process the implication of what just occurred.
Gosh, a Happy Tony is such a beautiful sight to see, Steve thinks with a lopsided smile.
“Then should it not make sense that when this episode occurs his mind is someplace else?” Thor concludes with a final bite to his Strawberry pop tart.
Hi, Tony. It’s okay, I’m not asleep. I lost track of time drawing.
As for Tony, the genius billionaire has an unhealthy tradition of consuming at least three cups of coffee every morning, not taking into account his appalling lack of sleeping and eating habits. Over the months since they were invited to live in the Tower by the man himself, Steve’s surprised to find out that Tony is one of the kindest, most generous people he’s ever come across.
Steve lightly nudges him, and he waits until Tony lifts his head to meet his eyes before he says, “You know you can talk to me, right? About anything.”
, of all people, that you got hurt! I mean, seriously, Tones! What were you thinking?”
“Shit, uh — sorry, JARVIS,” Steve says apologetically. He shakes his head and adds, “Sorry, uh — did you say something?”
Halting in his steps, Tony shifts his stance and thrusts his right hand up in the air. He sees the Chitauri pull up in confusion, but before they can react further, Tony feels the handle of Mjölnir land in his grip. The little bolts of lightning around the face of the war-hammer unfurls past Tony’s right hand until it’s creeping up the whole length of his arm. Power he’s never sensed before in the months since he’s started wielding her courses within Tony, and it’s in that moment he realizes this must be what Thor feels every time he uses her in battle.
“Who the hell is blasting music that loud at this hour?” Tony reacts incredulously.
His fifteen-year-old self would've never dreamed of this happening. At all. And Tony’s had
Unfortunately, until his suit and the team arrives, all Tony has with him are his wrist gauntlets. And since there is already one Leviathan in New York, with more approaching for sure,
Well, it’s not like he’s not used to staying up past his bedtime.
“Mostly?”
“But that only occurs when he is asleep.”
The super soldier rolls his eyes good-naturedly, but he ends up smiling softly at Tony.
There’s a new tension in the room as they, bar Tony who’s frozen stiff on the couch, stand up in attention.
“Mjölnir said that she
It’s the thought that counts, he repeats to himself again.
Hopefully that’s not bile she can taste in her mouth because she’d rather not die to the thought of ‘when will Steve and Tony resolve their sexual tension?’
“Are you saying that he was healed by the power of love?”
It opens its mouth and speaks in a language none of them obviously understands.
Because Steve is, well,
Natasha’s eyes are narrowed in contemplation as she asks, “So what
The Avengers.
Thankfully, all it took was one (desperate) look at a corner in the room where he knows JARVIS is for the AI to lower the volume at a respectable level. This action causes both geniuses to stop their jig and finally look up at Steve.
Tony’s mouth is open but no voice emits from his throat. Next, he tries to mouth the word, but that also doesn’t work. Eventually, the engineer stops trying, and there’s dubious look etched on his face as he blinks.
“That is one way of describing me looking after you, sir. It is, after all, my sole duty, to protect my creator.”
“Nonsense!” Thor exclaims, and this time he doesn’t fight the mischievous grin from spreading across his face. Tony’s beginning to look at him suspiciously as he adds, “We will be evenly matched, my friend.”
Once he’s stepped out of the suit, Tony activates his wrist gauntlets once more before asking JARVIS to connect him to the team’s comms via his bluetooth earpiece.
Well, it looks like she’s finally going to bear witness to Tony lifting Mjölnir. She would’ve preferred it to happen under better circumstances, but she’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. So with a nod to signal her consent, Tony only hesitates a second before he grips the handle of Mjölnir and swiftly lifts it from her broken leg.
“As do I, Captain,” JARVIS adds. “I am always at your service.”
Time to face the music.
Sounds great!
I miss you more now than I did an hour ago. Sweet dreams, darling.
Natasha, for once, does her best to stay still as JARVIS does his scanning through Iron Man’s sensors. After a few seconds, she hears Tony hum as the AI relays the diagnosis to him via their private channel.
. Now Bruce just asked you for
“That’s alright,” Steve says soothingly. It’s alright, to be honest, ‘cos he already memorized a few lines while he was listening in. After a beat, he adds, “It’s a nice song.”
The elderly woman snorts. “That, and he wasn’t the best at communicating. Had to wrestle it out of him sometimes, but it was always worth it in the end.” A wistful smile graces her face.
The air is warm, slightly humid; the well-known scents of hot dogs and pastries, as well as the stale smell of the Hudson River. Tony breathes it all in and slowly exhales it through his mouth. Kids running and screeching in laughter. Young adults — couples, groups of friends — walking at a sedate pace while murmuring whatever nonsense to each other that Tony can’t hear. Older couples, families, sprawled comfortably on the grass as they trade stories and take pictures.
Overall, Tony’s satisfied with how everything turned out. If only the butterflies in his stomach would settle so he could focus on more important things, like try to enjoy this goddamn party.
Tony shrugs while rubbing his eyes.
Eventually, Steve clears his throat and speaks in a quiet voice. “I speak for myself when I say that these past few weeks, I’ve come to know Tony better. And though I already cared about him as a teammate, I’ve also grown to care about him as a friend. Tony is — he’s a brilliant man — and even better, he’s a
“I just,” Tony starts with a huff. He exhales a puff of breath and breaks eye contact with Jarvis to start walking again, and it only takes a few steps for the latter match his pace. “This whole situation is just freaking me out, okay? I’m sorry for snapping at you, J, but I just…”
, Nat thinks fondly, and she doesn’t just mean this particular moment at all.
“Don’t worry, only happens when I’m drunk.”
“The quinjet is less than three minutes away, sir,” JARVIS answers. “Mark 35 is incoming in thirty seconds.”
to him, and Steve doesn’t have the first clue on how to befriend someone without writing down a list.
,” Clint wheezes in what must be glee in his tone.
“Agent Barton and Agent Romanoff are still at SHIELD, Mr. Odinson has not yet returned from his trip in New Mexico, and Doctor Banner wishes to not be disturbed as he is in the middle of a time-sensitive experiment,” JARVIS answers promptly.
“Better. We call Pepper.”
“He’s a prideful man, my George, but even he wasn’t immune to seek help. Even the strongest of people need the comforting touch and the listening ear of a loved one.”
“Have you secured the weapon that hit Stark?”
? What a joke! I’m a fucking mess, a walking disaster, and a royal pain in everyone’s ass. If anything, I’m the last person who’d be deemed worthy of anything.”
“Okay, Rhodey, you’re on loudspeaker. You’re in a safe space?” Pepper asks as she increases the volume of her phone before directing it to the microphone that’s lodged in the monitor.
“That was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever witnessed,” he utters breathlessly, sounding choked with emotion. Tony’s stomach swoops at the admission, and Steve continues, “
“Do you think that could be part of what you’re missing? When you first woke up, you said that you were missing something. Could that be part of it?” the super soldier inquires. Somehow, he must’ve said something right — or wrong — because suddenly the air shifts as the implication of his question registers in everyone.
“Aye, Captain!” Thor exclaims with a loud rumble of thunder overhead.
“Uh… sure? I mean — yeah. Okay. If it’s okay.”
“Tony, you’re my friend. And these past few weeks, we’ve all been skirting around the topic of The-Incident-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named because, for some reason, you’re really freaked out by it. Don’t argue,” the physicist adds with an imploring look when Tony opens his mouth to do just that.
(WIP)
He doesn’t notice Steve hesitate, too busy rubbing his aching temples. The next thing he knows, Tony notices the blond man move until his back is pressed against the back of the couch. Steve straightens the blanket draped over his legs as he pats the space beside him.
There’s a stinging in his eyes then, and Tony hates himself when he feels the tears spill down his cheeks. He sees the panicked expression on Steve’s face, but that doesn’t register in him as Tony closes his eyes in shame and he brings a hand up to cover his mouth to stifle his sobs. Before he knows it, Tony feels large, hesitant hands rest on his biceps, and he stiffens at the contact for a moment before his body relaxes and sways towards the figure in front of him. The hands — Steve’s hands, he notes with surprised confusion — slowly rub circles on Tony’s arms before they carefully encircle around his shaking form.
Having left the Tower after three that afternoon, Tony’s been sitting in the bench and looking at the golden skies for the better part of two and a half hours now. He deliberately left his phone in his dresser, and he took the long way to avoid the surveillance cameras so he won’t be followed. Of course, Tony also knows that either Steve or Natasha will contact Pepper for the two-step authentication to bring JARVIS back online. Given the fact that his company’s CEO has a meeting until six o’clock, plus she needs to get in touch with Rhodey who's still in Afghanistan, Tony deduces that he has another hour or two before they find him.
“Hey! That was uncalled for, Jarv. And besides, you started it! You haven’t given me a straight answer ever since, and it’s not like I’m going to remember this whole conversation anyway once I wake up. I never do, and it’s honestly getting on my nerves. I’m sorry, really I am. And as much as I’ve missed you all these years, I know it when someone’s deliberately withholding
The archer does as he’s told, and in a split second the 85-inch TV is switched on to a random channel — some cartoon called Adventure Time — and Steve forces himself to slouch in his position. Five seconds later, he hears the elevator doors open, followed by the footsteps of Tony’s sock-clad feet padding quietly, uncertainly, towards the living area.
Which, he thinks if the quiet snigger behind him is anything to go by, is
about Howard’s son that leaves Steve feeling very peculiar, and it certainly doesn’t help that Tony’s extremely easy on the eyes.
Steve does his best not to frown at the uncertainty in Tony’s voice, so he musters a reassuring smile as he gestures his head for the man to join him in the kitchen. As he turns around, he notices Tony hesitate before he shuffles forward to follow the super soldier.
To hide his thoughts, Steve forces out a chuckle. “I see your point. Not your cup of tea — or coffee, should I say?” At Tony’s snort at the terrible joke, Steve’s laugh is more genuine, and his next words come out more sincere than he expected. “This one’s made for the movies.”
“Hello, Steven,” the Asgardian greets with a knowing grin at Steve, much to the super soldier’s embarrassment. Thankfully, Thor walks past him to stand next to Tony, heedful of the latter’s injuries as he places a careful hand on his shoulder. “Tony! How are you faring, my friend?”
Steve rolls his eyes despite the blush on his face. Natasha, on the other hand, arches a brow at him.
He shuffles inside his room and makes a beeline to his en suite where he proceeds to turn on the shower, setting the water to hot. Next, he carefully strips off his clothes, the almost week-old pajamas pooling at his feet. He gets inside the shower stall, sliding the door closed behind him as he does so, and Tony groans in relief when the scalding water cascades over his body. He feels the chill that’s been residing in his chest since waking up from an odd dream the day before begin to alleviate, albeit little by little. After several minutes, he decides to lather his body with soap, taking his time with scrubbing away the sweat and grime from being in the med bay for nearly a week.
After several moments, Steve opens his mouth to speak.
“What was it?” Natasha asks cautiously, eyebrows furrowed.
“C’mon, Brucie bear. Shake those hips with me!”
, right now.”
“You really do have a way with speeches,” the genius mumbles teasingly, ducking his head and leaning forward until his face is buried against Steve’s broad chest.
“Yeah, uh, it was great chatting with you, platypus. But I gotta go do number two. Heh, you know how it is.”
Firstly, a pop song is playing at an unacceptable volume. Due to the super serum, Steve’s senses are heightened, causing him to wince at the thumping bass.
” Tony laughs bitterly, and at this point Bruce is growing more alarmed by the second. “And let me tell you, Brucie, that didn’t make sense to me. At all. Can you imagine —
“Hey, babycakes,” Tony greets with a grin, ignoring Peter’s groan. “What brings you to our humble abode?”
This time, Tony huffs out in laughter. “Yeah, pretty much.”
Mjölnir vibrates in his hand and answers,
“Right. Okay, great. I’m sending M to you after this so you can pick up Katniss afterwards.”
“Enjoying the party?”
Don’t get him wrong. It’s still difficult to come to grips with it, and some days he regrets ever entertaining those kind of thoughts about himself because
Steve smiles, and he raises a hand to rest on Tony’s cheek, thumb slowly caressing his jaw as the rest of his fingers card through the small hairs at the back of Tony’s neck. The engineer is incapable of holding back a shiver, and he involuntarily closes his eyes at the intimate gesture. When Tony opens his eyes again, he feels heat curl low in his abdomen when he’s met with Steve’s hooded eyes, dark with desire.
At who, Steve doesn’t know, and he doesn’t want to linger too much on that thought, either.
“Yeah, uh, you’re doing pretty well, Tin Man. Cap, no need to get your panties in a twist — Tony’s holding his own just fine. Great moves, too, and really flexible. All that training with Nat paid off, eh?”
, but if the knowing looks his teammates were giving him were any indication, then Tony thinks he was doing a poor job of concealing his emotions.
“Thanks, JARVIS,” Steve answers the AI, gratitude evident in his tone. “Your support will definitely make things a lot easier for us. Speaking of,” he adds as an afterthought. He checks his watch, shocked to see that it’s already gone past six in the evening. “Is Tony still asleep?”
“Right.”
“You’ve been talking to yourself for the past thirty minutes about what to get for Captain Rogers’ birthday, sir.”
“Good boy.”
The elderly woman meets his gaze, heedless that she can’t see his eyes. Still, she smiles at Tony as if he’s her favorite grandchild, and the genius is unable to hide the choked noise he makes when a wrinkled hand comes up to pat his cheek. The phantom ache in his chest eases a fraction at the affectionate gesture.
, there’s no guarantee that I will. But I want to try.”
“What’s wrong with me, Jarvis?” he utters next, unable to keep the fear out of his tone. “What’s happened to me?”
ass is gorgeous,” Steve retaliates dumbly. He knows it’s a weak one, but his mind is still repeating the part where Tony just admitted he loves his ass, even if the latter’s smirk melts into a bashful expression.
Blinking away his thoughts, Steve shakes his head once. He takes a few steps towards Tony who hasn’t spoken a word since Steve called out his name.
he was wearing thick black socks earlier — and
He takes a tentative step forward, only realizing that the “ground” beneath him is warm to the touch. Taking a few more steps ahead, he flexes his toes next to get a feel of the texture of the floor, and he’s mildly surprised to find out that it’s similar to a tartan track.
“Strangers waiting!” Bruce shouts, making Steve flinch in surprise.
There are brief moments when Steve is consumed with his love for Tony, and sometimes he doesn’t know how
“Alright, alright, settle down,” Steve interrupts in a loud voice before anyone can answer Clint.
Several hours passed, and half a dozen artworks later, Steve looks up from his sketchbook to look at the clock hanging above the entertainment centre in his room.
is so damn domestic. Sure, he’s been living Tony and the rest of the team for a long time now. They’ve already established a routine at this point, no matter how sporadic that is. But it’s times like today that Steve is reminded on how absolutely fortunate he is to have this life. This team.
“Welcome back, JARVIS,” Steve greets with a relieved grin.
Please enjoy!
Jarvis answers in the negative, and Tony sighs loudly in relief. Next, he considers what his AI previously suggested. It takes another few minutes for him to weigh his options before he makes a decision.
“Thanks, J.”
?” Clint yelps, aghast.
Empty cartons of take-out from their favorite Chinese and Indian restaurants lay haphazardly on the coffee table as well as empty bottles of beer and sodas. They’ve elected to forego watching a movie in exchange for a lazy night spent talking instead.
“Well, this party is far from ending,” he starts.
Rather, he has the beginnings of a plan.
“Not even the Allspeak knows this language, Captain.”
The same creature from when Tony was hit, Steve repeats in his head with dread settling in the pit of his stomach.
Natasha, who’s sitting closest to him, leans forward and slaps the archer right across the face. The others wince at the loud smack of skin hitting against skin, but Steve doesn’t feel the least bit sorry for Clint as he swears loudly and massages his burning cheek.
The air shifts in the room instantly, everyone on high alert.
expenses at all, thank you very much) would be putting it mildly. Steve was fucking
Tony briefly glances at her, notices her sitting on her knees in the armchair she’s unofficially claimed as hers, before returning his eyes to Steve’s, who’s standing a mere four feet away from Tony. The super soldier’s back is ramrod straight, but despite that posture it only brought a strange sense of comfort to him.
“Hey yourself,” Tony answers just as quietly. He attempts to smile but it falls flat.
“I haven’t really,” Tony pauses and purses his lips. After a moment, he finishes his sentence with, “Haven’t felt an inclination to go there recently.”
“Okay, here’s the plan,” Steve declares in an authoritative tone. “Thor and Iron Man, you’re on aerial support; secure the perimeter and get rid of the Chitauri before they hurt any more people. Widow, I need you with me here on the ground. We gotta aid the rest of the civilians to safety before more can get hurt, or worse. Hawkeye, your usual place as our eye up high — call out patterns when you can. And Hulk? Continue smashing, buddy.”
Oh, shit. Has been talking out loud this whole time?!
“Dunno. Maybe half an hour.”
It’s when their chests are nearly touching, and Tony can smell Steve’s familiar scent mixed with the alcohol in his breath, that it registers in the engineer that he’s never been
Maybe.
“Speaking of Bruce…”
“It’s currently eight forty-five, sir,” Jarvis instantly replies.
Instead, Steve raises an eyebrow at Tony. “So you’re saying you took twelve shots of tequila for shits and giggles?”
“Well, we did go through two bottles. Plus, you kept asking Nat for more shots.” Steve turns on his side and shifts his left arm so his head is resting on the palm of his hand as he stares up at Tony with a small smirk.
has a lot to make up for.
“Tony,” Steve repeats, the concern he’s feeling apparent in his voice when Tony doesn’t speak.
“Fuck.”
Thor and Tony eventually join in, the Asgardian more likely reading the lyrics on the TV screen rather than singing it.
? Preferably in the bedroom,” Tony adds with a lascivious smirk.
“There’s a horde of spiders incoming on sixteenth,” Clint shouts. Ah, so that’s why he’s panicking. “Nat, you’ve got less than a minute to get the fuck outta there.”
“You stopped swearing.”
Mjölnir.
Steve gathers his thoughts before abandoning the worktable to walk to Tony’s side. Once he’s next to him, Steve hesitates for a fraction of a second before thinking,
“Actually, I’m hungry,” Tony announces. Steve turns his head to look at him, eyebrows raised. With a small smirk, the engineer continues, “I”m craving pie. And a milkshake.”
Thankfully, and unsurprisingly, JARVIS still hears his query.
Violin starts to play from the Bose speakers that Tony insisted he buy Steve, and the thought of the genius makes a smile appear on his face just as the song shifts.
“My dear hammer is, indeed, a beautiful weapon.”
“And what exactly is that supposed to mean?” Steve adds with a deep frown.
* * * * * *
A year ago, the redheaded assassin hadn’t felt comfortable enough to let down her guard around the them, excluding Clint since they’ve known each other before the Initiative. Now, though, after everything they’ve been through — the battles they fought, the close calls every single one of them encountered — Steve thinks it was all worth it to see them come this far.
“Tony,” Steve interrupts softly, heart pounding at the earnest look on Tony’s face. It takes every ounce of his control to not reach out to the genius and take his hand in his.
Tony meets his dazed expression with a smug smirk as the genius shrugs and states, “Have you seen yourself from behind, honey? I love your ass. It’s gorgeous, a national treasure, in my humble opinion.”
But that’s not the reason why he stopped.
. And before you ask: yes, I know how to play; and no, nobody else knows except you, Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy.”
He remembers Pepper’s advice a few days ago.
“Hello, Steve!” Peter waves at him brightly.
“For once you’re getting good press, and it’s not just your typical breaking news, either,” Natasha finishes for him with a smug smirk.
He was singing? What the fuck? He wasn’t even aware he was still capable of doing that. Tony remembers forcing himself to grow out of that mindless habit in his teens after good ol’ Howard ordered him to cut out his nonsensical humming. It was mostly that, actually — nonsensical humming — but there were times back then when Tony, too deep in his thoughts with designs and equations, would hum songs under his breath. Most of the time, the lyrics are wrong, especially if they were songs he heard on the radio in passing. But sometimes, they don’t even have lyrics, and Tony just hums the tune under his breath while spouting random lyrics on-the-fly.
“Only you would end up in that kind of situation,” Steve remarks with a shake of his head.
“Thank you.” The words are mumbled unintelligibly, but the weight that phrase carries speaks a lot.
“I was totally not expecting that,” Clint comments, breaking the silence.
) can take his time roaming around the place and taking in each artwork to his heart’s content. Then on his actual birthday, they celebrated it by spending a long weekend at the engineer’s Hamptons residence, where everyone — including Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Jane Foster, and Darcy Lewis — ate and drank until their eyes crossed (except for Bruce and Rhodey who elected to be the “responsible adults”; and also Steve because of the super serum) around the campfire they made, and then went night swimming afterwards.
— chokes on the huge bite of French toast he’s chewing when he hears how uncertain and vulnerable Tony sounded just then. He casually roams his eyes over the table and shares a look with Natasha and Clint, the two assassins (subtly) looking as tense as Steve is feeling.
As he and Tony set the table together, Steve finds himself locking gazes with him.
Steve smiles. “You were the one who decided to join me here.”
“Do you think SHIELD will be able to find something?” Steve had asked the physicist after Agent Hill and two SHIELD agents left the Tower with the device.
“… Okay, ma’am. I’ll try.”
Physically shaking his head to clear away the graphic images of him bending Tony over one of the tables and showing him a
“Yeah, I know,” Tony cuts in. They hear the ping of the lift as they reach his floor, and before they step out, he quickly adds, “I know I didn’t have to, but I wanted to.”
When Steve only responds with a confused expression, the genius sighs in what can only be considered a dramatic one before he expounds.
Before his eyes fall completely closed, he manages to catch a glimpse of Steve smirking as the man says just as quietly, “S’fine. Mine stinks, too.”
she tells him.
At this point, the rest of the team are looking at Tony, concern visible on their faces as they silently, patiently, wait for Tony to speak. From the corner of his eye, he sees Clint lower the volume of the TV until it’s a low, buzzing sound, and for some reason that gesture melts something in the engineer.
Clint and Thor nod in agreement.
Not gonna lie, even I gave myself cavities writing this segment.
“It —
Ignoring their friends’ half-hearted complaints about the display of affection (Clint is obviously taking pictures, the bastard), Tony feels Steve’s mouth stretch into a grin against his as the blond mutters, “Have dinner with me tonight? I gotta show my favorite fella just how much I appreciate him.”
“I’m a grown-ass adult. I can do whatever the hell I want, especially when it comes to drinking milkshakes at half past two in the morning.”
“Your current vitals beg to differ, sir,” JARVIS replies placidly.
your problems and it’s your business, I respect that — I want you to know that that’s not your only option. You have the team behind your back and by your side. Yes, you fight your battles and you do so beautifully and admirably. But you should, you
that expression. That look should never have graced Tony’s face in the first place. Fortunately, Steve’s also a stubborn man; if he has to spend the rest of his life making Tony see that he is a person of value and worth, that there are so many people who love and care about him, then Steve will make it his mission to do so. Because if there’s one thing that he can’t stand, it’s to see the man he loves suffer in silence over his fears and insecurities.
“How did it go?” Natasha asks.
“We’re comin’ in hot,” Clint announces then. “Cap and Bruce are about to jump off the ramp as we speak.”
“Point taken,” Tony eventually says with a nod. “Also — lunch? Isn’t it only ten?”
Holy shit.
If Tony were sober, he would’ve said something sarcastic or come up with a crude joke. But as it is, he’s having the Worst Fucking Hangover since ’97, and the couch
self-defense, even before I started training with you lot,” Tony finds himself saying in between grunts. Before Steve, or any of the team, can say anything, the genius presses on as he continues to fight off against the horde of Chitauri who just. Keep. Coming at him. Jesus, they’re never ending. “And as for that reason, there’s no way we can shut the portal down from here. JARVIS said that the heat signature is coming strongest from outside the portal. And seeing that we don’t have a nuke coming this way, the best option is to send my suit towards the mothership and have it self-destruct since, y’know, the suit has an arc reactor in it.”
He notes the way Tony’s jaw clenches for a moment before forcing himself to relax. He still looks tense, body coiled as if ready to bolt at a moment’s notice, but despite that Bruce can also see that Tony’s shoulders have relaxed somewhat.
“We’re almost clear here, too,” Steve responds, followed by a grunt and the clang of his vibranium shield hitting its target.
Tony gestures his hands as if to say ‘you know what I’m talking about’.
Nothing happens.
“Especially like this,” is his emphatic answer.
After several beats, he breaks the silence by taking a long sip of his lukewarm coffee.
“Of course, sir. I have now programmed your alarm to wake you up should Sir need assistance.”
“Sure, whatever helps you sleep at night, Barton.”
swirling in Tony’s rich brown eyes.
“Thanks for the head’s up, buddy.”
Steve’s smile widens when he hears Tony chuckle, and he shoots him another lopsided smile, inwardly patting himself on the back for getting such a positive reaction out of the engineer.
I’m sorry about the long meeting you had. How are you? Have you eaten dinner yet?
Bruce giggles as he plops gracelessly next to Steve and says, “All good, Steve. Just,
I should go. I think I’m gonna fall asleep in the jacuzzi if I don’t move now.
“None of you were there! That weapon released some sort of blue light, and it hit Tony right in the chest —
It takes Tony several attempts to muster a response. “Wh-where are the others?”
Thank you for 11 years of lessons and memories, both good and bad.
“… No promises there, Pep.”
“I can’t say for certain,” he finally ends up saying carefully. But before Steve, or the others, can begin to feel disappointed, Tony is quick to add, “But I think that whatever the barrier is that’s preventing me from swearing — even from this sudden lack of interest in my work —
he looked just then. Tony looks good clean-shaven, but Steve can’t help but miss the goatee.
“Happy birthday, Steve,” Tony murmurs in between fervent kisses.
And that pout? Christ, I could just eat you up, Rogers. 😩
Tony feels his face grow warm, eyes crinkling at how wide he’s smiling now, but he nips Steve’s lower lip and mutters back, “Sure, honey. Looking forward to it.”
nothing, but it’s too… calm. Too serene, and Steve’s starting to panic because
Tony doesn’t say anything, except to clutch tighter to the cotton fabric of Steve’s shirt as he lets out another sob and allows himself to be comforted by his teammates.
The thing is, if it were someone else, Tony wouldn’t have thought twice and just buy that person a ridiculously expensive gift that they want (but don’t need).
, but also
“I’m guessing that that same light is the cause of what’s happening to Tony right now. It’s like what he said earlier — physically, he’s alright. But ‘something’ is missing, and we don’t know
Tony shakes his head with another smile, and they descend into a peaceful silence.
There’s a tightening in his chest when Bruce casually points out that he and Tony don’t get along, and in that moment Steve wishes that that weren’t true. It’s a well-known fact that he and Tony argue more than they agree, but in the past year and a half that they’ve been living under the same roof as the rest of the Avengers, Steve can freely admit that his relationship with the genius-billionaire has improved, if only marginally, and not in the way he would’ve liked nor expected.
Unfortunately, neither Tony nor Thor arrive on time because not barely five seconds pass when she hears the telltale sounds of the cluster of spider bots approaching around the corner.
“Best one I’ve tasted, though,” the engineer murmurs into his drink.
There’s something peculiar in her expression that Steve catches sight of, but is unable to put a finger on what it is. He watches Pepper as she breathes out a long sigh. She closes her eyes and massages the bridge of her nose with a thumb and forefinger before lifting her head to look at them again.
“So what do we do instead?” Clint asks.
before she takes to the air once more to reunite with Thor.
“I’m having déjà vu, guys,” Clint says next. “How the fuck did they even manage to open a portal?”
Steve reaches for the device to look at the notification, wondering who could be texting him at this time. When he sees the name on his lock screen, Steve can’t help the chuckle that leaves past his lips. He taps the screen to open the message:
Steve straightens in his seat, and even Thor can’t hide the gleeful expression on his face.
“Okay, on it.”
“Black Widow report,” Steve commands, worry laced in his tone.
“Talk to her, Tony. There’s no harm in doing so,” Thor says softly. Then, with one last pat on the shoulder and a nod at Steve, the Asgardian turns and walks out of the workshop.
type of situation is to watch and observe Tony and act accordingly to how he acts around us. For example, #10 on your list says ‘Strike up a conversation with Tony about his interests when you’re in the same room’ doesn’t really give off a genuine vibe.”
Tony opens and closes his mouth. His eyes narrow in thought as he stares aimlessly at somewhere over Steve’s shoulder for a few seconds before he tilts his head to meet Bruce’s concerned eyes.
Truly, Mjölnir has developed a soft spot for the brilliant man. With the way Mjölnir reacts whenever Tony is in the vicinity is telling enough. It is not evident to the others, of course, for they don’t possess ability to sense these things, but it never fails to bring joy to Thor to observe the minute vibration and tiny sparks of lightning his dear hammer emits every time she senses his friend.
“How are you sure?”
What the hell?
Tony not fifteen minutes ago? I don’t think it’s a glitch in the system anymore.”
“Now hang on, Tones, you never had a problem chatting with me while you were —”
wrecked, Steve thinks as his chest twinges uncomfortably.
“How’d it go?” he asks lightly, still in high spirits because he finally witnessed Tony wield Mjölnir. Steve won’t admit it out loud, and thinking about it is enough to make him turn red as a tomato, but he realized just then that the image of his stubborn genius grasping Mjölnir in his hand turns him on. Steve coughs and mentally shakes his head, cursing himself for getting aroused at the most inopportune time. Again. He clears his throat and continues. “Mjölnir ripped you a new one? I won’t be surprised if she did, though.”
This time, Pepper’s smile turns brittle as she directs her attention to the super soldier.
Taking out the ingredients from the corresponding cupboards, Steve moves fluidly as he fills the saucepan with low-fat milk and turns the stove on to start heating it. Next, he measures a few tablespoons of cocoa powder and then adds it into the saucepan. Then, he adds a tablespoon of sugar, a dash of salt, and lastly a half teaspoon of vanilla extract before he starts stirring the ingredients together. All the while, Steve is cognizant of Tony’s presence behind him, the engineer leaning against a counter as he silently observes Steve make their drink.
at his workshop, tinkering with whatever project he’s working on. But Steve and the others chose not comment, instead thinking that it’s probably another factor in Tony’s unusual behavior.
Steve has found himself part of a dysfunctional team who, despite their differences and shortcomings, somehow complement one another. They fill in each other’s gaps, all six of them. It’s certainly not like how it was with the Howling Commandos, no, but Steve still believes that the bond the Avengers formed following the failed alien invasion is just as special.
Tony’s brows furrow and, looking around at the still standing Chitauri, his frown deepens as dread coils in his gut. “The two minutes should’ve passed by now. The suit should’ve exploded and destroyed the mothership.”
They all get up from their seats and amble towards the elevator. The lights in the common area shut off one by one as they all shuffle together inside the shaft. They bid each other ‘good night’ as they got off on their designated floor until it’s Steve who’s the last person to step out of the elevator.
“Negative, Captain,” JARVIS answers over the comms.
“This is really good,” Tony remarks. Not bothering to blow on the surface, he takes another sip, and Steve almost chokes on the hot liquid when the engineer runs a tongue on his upper lip. “You got some skills, Steve.”
Suddenly, the R&B music that’s been blasting from the speakers changes to a soft pop song, acoustic guitars softly playing before a familiar voice starts singing. Eyebrows raised, Steve shares a look with Tony before they turn their heads in unison to the direction where the music booth is located. Unsurprisingly, Clint is talking animatedly with the DJ, who’s looking exasperated if the long-suffering sigh Steve heard is anything to go by.
