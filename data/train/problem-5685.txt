“Nat, he says he’s fine, so leave him,” Bucky called. “Besides, I need your help with our friend here, so let’s hit the road.”
Tony walked Steve and Evie Rose to the subway station, after Steve insisted Tony didn’t have to drive them back to Brooklyn. Evie Rose skipped along, hand in hand with Steve, clearly fuelled by the two bowls of ice cream, humming to herself, and Tony fell a little bit more in love with her.
“It is,” Bruce replied automatically. He swallowed. “Uh, if you’d like to follow me and we’ll see what the-”
, so he couldn’t even cajole her into making him a sandwich. And the jar of Cheese Whiz he’d been snacking on was disappointingly empty.
Steve’s mouth twitched upwards. Angie fell in step with him, swinging her bag in one hand as they made their way downstairs.
“Hey Stevie,” he greeted, slapping Steve on the shoulder. “God, I hope we have donuts, I’m starving.”
Stark nodded and jogged off towards the locker room, and Steve watched him go. Clint scoffed under his breath and handed off the completed paperwork to Wanda. He glanced up as Stark reappeared with his jacket and medical kit.
Johnny buried his hands into his pocket and slouched against the wall, glancing up when someone exited the ER, his heart doing that funny little jump in his chest until he saw it wasn’t Peter but a doctor in blue scrubs.
For a minute he thought he was imagining things, as though thinking of her was enough to hear her voice. But then he realised that no, it really was her voice. He spun around, his jaw falling at a little.
Steve paused in buttoning his shirt and tilted his head, giving Hammer a look which said that he thought Hammer was crazy. Which, fair enough, Hammer was weird. But in this case, he was only saying what they all thought.
Sharon and Clint groaned. The relationship drama between the two techs had a habit of taking over the whole hospital. Sharon felt sick and it had nothing to do with… other things.
His laughter was cut off by a faint scream. It wasn’t that usual to hear someone scream in the ER, considering some of the injuries they dealt with, but this wasn’t a scream of pain but of fear. It made Natasha’s skin crawl.
Steve howled, his head falling back against the bed, leaving Tony drunk on the power he held. It was a heady feeling, the knowledge that Steve was giving him this power, this control over him. Tony could feel his blood pounding in his head.
“Guess they gotta be pissed when the best weapons manufacturer stops making weapons,” Steve reasoned.
Steve’s breath hitched as Tony ran his hand from Steve’s neck, down his chest, all the way until he reached his groin, spreading his hand over the growing bulge in Steve’s jeans. Throwing his head back again, Steve whined, his hips bucking upwards. Tony rubbed him slowly through his jeans until Steve was fully hard and a gasping mess.
Tony stared at the ceiling, his fingers rubbing tiny circles into Steve’s shoulder. “There was a girl. A kid. I was ordered to hand her over to her husband. I refused.”
“I agree with the need for conservation, and I can see the benefit of certain zoos. But I don’t agree with animals being used for entertainment,” Bruce said as they reached the foot of the garden. He smiled up at Steve. “Well. Steve. Good to see you again.”
Tony tensed, his eyes going distant, and Steve’s heart sank. Had he unknowingly tripped over one of Tony’s many triggers again?
From his confused expression, Warren wasn’t going to be thinking about anything until he sobered up. So it was just as well that he wasn’t the real intended recipient. Steve watched Alexander leave though narrowed eyes then turned to his patient.
Tony sniffed. He decided to ignore the rest of his team, and dropped the cloth-covered box into Natasha’s lap. Natasha glanced between the box and Tony.
And it was stupid the way the nickname made his eyes fill with tears, but it did. Tony gulped for air.
He didn’t have to do anything with them, just because he took them to the mansion. But it was an option.
“Fuck,” he groaned then laughed at the irony because fucking was exactly what he was trying to avoid thinking about.
Panting for breath, Steve let his head hang. He shook his head. Why did he think he could do anything? He couldn’t get Tony out of here, he couldn’t take down Stane. Hell, he couldn’t even take care of himself. What hope did he have of helping anyone else?
“Thank you, Your Honour,” the defence attorney replied. “Your Honour, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, counsel, my name is Jerri Hogarth. I am Mr Nefaria’s lawyer.
He forced down the coffee, his need for caffeine overriding his dislike of unsweetened coffee, then dropped the mug into the sink. He held out his hand and was relieved to find that he’d stopped shaking.
There was something comforting about seeing the imprints of humans long gone; no matter who you were, there was a part of you, of what you made, of who you were that left its mark upon the world.
“Jerk,” Steve retorted, but he let Bucky drag him into the elevator, feeling some of the weight lift from his shoulders.
“Nah, it’s fine,” Tony assured her. “I’m already here. Besides, if I leave I’m just going to worry about him, so I’d rather stay where I can check up on him myself.”
Steve turned to the next room, another bathroom, and found it had fallen victim to the water damage too, although not as seriously as the nursery.
“I’ll see you both soon,” Natasha said, giving Charles a final reassuring smile before leaving the cubicle only to instantly be ambushed by Bruce.
“Thank you,” Natasha smiled. “Now, let’s see if we can figure out what’s going on with your heart. Are you happy for…” She indicated to the woman. “Your friend to stay?”
“Thanks,” Steve said gratefully, when Tony handed him his ice cream, and Tony knew he meant for more than just the ice cream.
Hauling himself off of the sofa, he padded through to his bedroom which, in all honesty, looked like an extension of his sofa-nest. He should probably feel guilty about that.
He took the bathroom first at Tony’s insistence, running through his nighttime routine before padding over to the bed. He flicked through social media while waiting for Tony, scrolling through his Twitter feed before refreshing his Tumblr notifications.
“I’m going to tackle the pump,” Steve decided. “We’ve pretty much finished getting all the crap out of the water that we can - although I am going to look at that water vacuum thing again - and we’ve removed all the gunk from the walls, so I think it’s time to see if we can get this thing fired up.”
“No,” he snapped. “I’m going to DC to testify against my kidnapper and hope that our corrupt justice system doesn’t set him free again.”
Wade giggled. Tony glanced over his shoulder at MJ, who stared at him with wide hopeful eyes, reminding himself of why he was doing this
That earned Clint a punch to the stomach. Tony winced in sympathy as Clint doubled over as much as his restraints would allow.
“Sorted. Finally,” Peggy exclaimed. “Can I hide some of the girls gifts here? Evie Rose is getting far too good at guessing my hiding places.”
“Yeah, sorry. I know,” Steve sighed, scrubbing his hands over his face. “It’s just, it’s hard for me to be objective here.”
“Oh, I used to be smaller,” Steve explained. “I guess I could try and find the instructions on the internet? Maybe… Maybe I can figure it out. It’s worth a shot, I guess.”
“It’s not that simple,” Natasha explained, hating herself for causing their expressions to drop. “Your heart stopped twice during the cath procedure. The fact is your heart likely isn’t strong enough to survive the operation.”
“And I thought I’d never have a chance, because before she always dated guys,” Angie added. “But then this summer she came out as bi.” She sighed, pressing her palms together. “Thank you, Jesus.”
Steve shook his head but he realised with a pang that he was going to miss having her around all the time, knowing that she was just across the apartment if he needed to talk or go out. She’d moved in a stranger and now he was leaving a sister behind.
She flailed for a moment, clearly recognising Tony as a stranger, but settled down once Tony shifted enough that she could see Steve was still there.
When he returned with their cups refilled, Peggy turned to him with a smirk. She nodded towards Tony and Evie Rose.
Steve watched Tony climb into the car, the engine roaring into life, and waved as Tony drove away, before making his way home, grinning like a loon for the entire walk back.
Then he turned to go back inside, and found Tony perched on the edge of the pool, tossing individual prawns into the air and catching them in his mouth. He watched Steve with a calculating expression.
The next day they returned to the courthouse together. Tony was called first, so Steve left Bucky in the hallway and found a seat in the gallery to support Tony. Unfortunately, this had the disadvantage of leaving him open to Nefaria’s disquieting gaze for the second day in a row. Steve gritted his teeth and tried to avoid looking towards the dock, keeping his eyes on Tony.
“No, you don’t,” she grinned, wrapping herself around his arm and leaning against his shoulder. “Jesus, did they get these chairs from a torture chamber?”
Unfortunately, Tony didn’t seem to get the message, swimming after Steve and getting in the way of the net every time he tried to scoop trash out of the water. Steve could feel the irritation creeping up his spine.
rang out, then the doors slid open soundlessly and Tony stepped out of the elevator without another word. Steve glared at his back then followed him upstairs.
“Okay. Thank you,” Pepper replied. “I should go, I have a, uh, a meeting in an hour. I need to prepare, and-“
"Sure," Steve nodded, heading to the kitchen and filling a glass. He heard a quiet murmur of voices behind him, and caught sight of Foggy leaning close to Tony in the reflection on the glass doors of the kitchen cabinets. "Here you are."
Tony’s words echoed in his head, leaving Steve with a warm feeling he’d been unable to appreciate when he first heard them, due to the maniac threatening to kill them.
“What doesn’t work?” Stark asked, appearing out of nowhere. Scott looked around; where the hell did he come from? He’d already discovered Stark had a habit of sneaking up on people with his unnaturally silent footsteps. Scott wondered if it was a soldier thing, before remembering Sharon and her three inch heels echoing through the corridors and reassessed his assumptions.
For the first time in a long time, Steve felt like he could breathe. He was still exhausted, and pretty much everything seemed insurmountable, but he could breathe.
“What?” Clint asked, hugging a travel mug of coffee like his life depended on it. “Dude seems okay. Said you worked together?”
“I didn’t know,” Steve shook his head, a few stray tears escaping down his face. “When you finished your leave or when I… When the plane went down. I didn’t know about her.” He nosed at Ellie’s hair. “I didn’t know until I woke up and they told me I was pregnant. But she’s yours. She could only be yours.”
Steve caught Tony’s face and pulled their lips together. Tony let out a sigh, a little huff of breath. Steve felt the shiver run down Tony’s spine in the way his arm tightened around Steve’s waist. It set off a burst of tingles beneath his skin. Steve pushed forward with renewed vigour. As they kissed, he heard the
“Uh huh, so good,” Steve nodded, sliding his hand onto Tony’s cheek and holding him in place as he leaned in to kiss his neck.
“I would take the three to six months,” Natasha replied honestly. That would give her enough time to see Sharon’s baby and so she didn’t have to go through childbirth alone. Plus, selfishly, Natasha wanted to see Sharon as a mother. She already knew she was going to be a wonderful mother.
It turned out to be something between a corridor and a conservatory. A bay window jutted out from the next room; through the glass, Steve caught a glimpse of a burnt orange carpet. At the end of the corridor, there was a toilet and a closet, then the final room opened out and Steve giggled to himself, tipping his head back to take in both floors of the library, sadly bereft of books.
Deft fingers sneaked under the hem of Steve’s shirt, tugging it upwards, and yeah, this was better Steve decided. Once Tony tossed the shirt aside, he pushed Steve down again. Steve caught Tony’s jeans by the waistband, simultaneously using them to tug Tony with him and to unbutton them.
He turned the business card over in his hand before slipping it into his pocket. He made his way back up to the house with Bruce’s words ringing in his ears.
All the broken glass from the Dreadnought attack was gone or replaced, Steve noted. Almost as though nothing had ever happened. But it had, Steve remembered it. His vision blurred again and his chest felt tight, and this was
“Uh huh. Sure. Sure.” Angie raised an eyebrow. “We’re putting a pin in this conversation, Steve. No!” she interrupted when he tried to object. “I haven’t forgotten the Rotten Tooth Incident of ‘09.”
He forewent a jacket; it was already over eighty degrees and climbing. Checking the door was locked behind him, Steve ran down the stairs two at a time, and turned right onto Wolcott Street.
have it. Tony wasn’t going to leave without explanation. They’d talked about the future and they had a plan. The knowledge filled him with warm excitement.
Clint eyed Dr. Stark curiously. He wasn’t their first or their only military member of staff, that wasn’t curious. But what was curious was the way Steve was eyeing him. Steve, very married, very devoted to his husband, Steve who was staring at Stark with a smile creeping across his face.
Sharon was nice like that. She often invited Steve along, and Rhodey, because he was a good guy, bore it with good grace and never looked pissed off. Probably because by now he knew Steve was unlikely to agree.
“I feel that my position here has been made untenable,” he continued. “You’ve made it clear that you care about the opinions and money of the bigoted few rather than the defence of my privacy. So I’m done. I don’t want to work in this kind of environment.”
They had more in common than anyone would ever realise, both of them practised liars who couldn’t lie very well at all.
“Don’t think that’s possible,” he replied before he could think better of it. “It was good to see you.”
He definitely remembered a conversation with Matt and Bucky over wings at Josie’s about telling Steve about Matt’s alter ego.
She definitely was. But Steve wasn’t about to inflate her ego by telling her that. He kept his face neutral, biting the inside of his cheeks to hide his grin when her expectant expression dropped into a scowl.
Following the instructions on his phone - and the notes he’d made from Tony’s explanation - Steve managed to replace the sand in the filter. Then he fought with the backwashing hose, grinning in triumph when he managed to get it attached. It took him longer than he wanted to admit to figure it out, but eventually he managed to get it to work and the filter was backwashed.
He heard Steve rinse his mouth, then the shower door opened and Steve stepped inside. He leaned down to kiss Tony, then murmured, “Thought you’d never ask.”
He sighed, lying down and letting the cold seep through his shirt from the ground. Even though the sun had slipped below the horizon, the humidity lingered, leaving Steve sticky and longing for a New York winter.
A shaky gasp escaped from Steve, his fingers gripping reflexively tighter, his fingernails becoming a row of pin-pricks against Tony’s shoulders and Tony could see him trembling.
He settled Ellie in his lap and guided her fingers towards the wrapping paper, helping her tear it away. She seemed more interested in the wrapping paper and the fact that she could tear it to her heart’s content than the box inside.
“Any time,” Tony promised. And squeezed Steve’s thigh, his thumb brushing his dick through his jeans.
Tony nodded, thinking of the library in his parents’ house when he was a child. He’d never really spent much time reading the books within it, and after they died, Stane was the one who’d cleared the house, under Tony’s instructions. No doubt it was filled with first editions, yet Tony’d never given them a second thought, while Steve’s mother had painstakingly parted with four first editions in order to support her family.
Steve passed a copy of the contract to Tony before taking one for himself. He’d read it yesterday with Peggy, getting her to look it over with him and explain any terms he didn’t understand. It had her approval, which meant it had Steve’s approval. He read through quickly, checking that nothing had changed, leaving the detailed reading to Tony who had actual experience and knowledge of contracts.
Tony gave him a look full of heat, which sent a shiver running down Steve’s spine straight to his dick.
The door closed behind Sharon and Natasha as they left the supply closet and Hope let out the breath she’d been holding since the door first opened.
“Steve’s just a nice guy,” Hope insisted. “He’d be that worried about any of us if we were out there. Remember when Sharon had food poisoning last week? He’s the definition of a mother hen.”
“Asshole,” Tony muttered, slapping Steve’s ass and listening to his muffled laughter as he left the room.
“It’s, uh, it’s not just a watch,” Tony explained. “There's a chip in it which gives you full access to the tower. Well, technically not full access. I mean, it doesn’t give you access to any of the Avengers’ apartments. But the communal areas, the labs - my lab and the labs - and the penthouse. Everything like that.”
Bruce pulled out his own flashlight and did just that. When he stepped back, his expression could only be described as flabbergasted.
“And I’ve got seventy years of back pay to waste and a boyfriend who won’t let me buy him diamonds,” Bucky waved him off. “Relax, Steve. I got this. Or, more accurately, the army’s got this.”
Sure enough, with every breath, a rattling wheeze echoed from Jessica. Then her eyes rolled back and she slumped forward as she went limp. She wasn’t breathing.
“Zoey, this is Tony,” Steve called, and Tony noticed the third girl, curled up in the corner of the couch, game controller in hand. She studied him with big dark eyes, then threw him a small wave, before turning back to the game on the TV. “Tony, spaghetti for dinner, okay?”
Steve roused himself as they landed, climbing to his feet with a wide yawn before reaching for Tony and tangling their fingers together.
And who was sitting downstairs with a weird lump in her side that needed treatment. Weird lumps didn’t care about insurance or capitalism; they just appeared and usually had a horrible outcome for whoever they’d appeared on.
“Pepper half-seriously offered me a job,” Steve admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “But I don’t think I’m cut out for business.”
Evie Rose scowled at him dubiously. “You’re famous for that? That’s silly. You should be famous for, like, saving someone’s life. Or, or doing something special. Or being in a movie. Not because you’re dating Tony.”
Sharon jumped, Clint’s voice right in her ear. She shot him a glare before signing off on the discharge paperwork for a patient with chest pains who thought he was having a heart attack but actually had sprained muscles from exercising for the first time in six months. “About what?”
“I broke up with him because I knew I had feelings for Tony and it wasn’t fair,” Steve explained without looking up. “Tony and I discussed it. We agreed we’d give it time.”
“You’re not funny,” Tony informed him, returning to the bedroom. Steve’s eyes flickered over Tony’s body as he crossed the room and climbed into bed, taking in the corded muscle and dark brown tan lines from the Afghan sun. “I don’t know why you can’t just put the menu back when you’re done with it. Then we know where it is.”
They made their way upstairs hand in hand, shoulders and hips brushing as they walked, both seeking more contact.
“You just called me doc, so I guess it’s something that happens,” Tony replied, examining the wound.
“Seriously,” Tony continued, catching Steve’s blazer by the button and letting his eyes roam over Steve’s body, leaving trails of heat in their wake. “You are stunning. My God, look at your eyes. They are so blue,” Tony murmured, running his thumb over Steve’s cheekbones.
“And homemade focaccia,” Natasha finished, putting the bread into the centre of the table before taking the seat between Steve and Thor.
She looked the same. Same long blonde hair, same bright eyes, still as beautiful as she was the last time he saw her when everything fell apart.
Especially when Tony had no problem with Steve sucking a bruise into his neck ten minutes later after Peggy’s neighbour spent a little too long flirting with Tony at the snack table for it to be anything other than casual.
“Okay,” Natasha said once they were alone. “I’m going to check your blood pressure again. The paramedics said it was high and I can already see from the wires we plugged you into that your heart is beating faster than normal, which isn’t what we want to see when you’re sitting still. Then we’ll get you up to the cath lab.”
“Hang on,” he told her, pulling out his phone. “I might have an idea. It’s a long shot,” he warned, “But it’s better than nothing.”
He negotiated the crowded dive bar, raising a hand to catch Josie’s attention and raising his empty glass. She nodded, and a few seconds later, he had a fresh scotch on the rocks in hand. But when he made it back to their booth, they were all still making out.
“Sue me,” he snapped. “I don’t like Starks. They never have to work for anything. And as a result, their skills are never up to standard.”
Steve took his time rocking into Tony’s body, delighting in the high-pitched little moans and gasps each thrust elicited from Tony. His hands scrabbled for purchase against Steve’s shoulders, his nails scraping lightly.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said once they were back in the living room. “You’re taking really good care of me. I’m sorry I’m being such an asshole. I just, I hate being sick.”
“I mean, you smiled more,” she shrugged. “And some of the weight from the aftermath of she-who-shall-not-be-named kinda disappeared, which was good.”
Driving actually helped. Some of the fog disappeared a little with all of his attention on the road and the unpredictable actions of the other drivers. But once he parked and started trudging up the trail which ran along the back of the Stark property, the fog descended again and it took everything Steve had to climb the wall.
“They are a team of liars and thieves who tricked the world into believing they are heroes. You just can’t see it yet.”
(He made the mistake of telling Bucky that one night while on a video call. Bucky glared at him, then threw his prosthetic at the camera)
“It’s fine,” Tony replied. “That’s what friends do. They get caught up in your crazy fights with pseudo-Russian mobsters.”
Steve nodded; Tony pulled back, giving him enough room to roll over until Steve was stretched out. The miles of pale skin in display left Tony a little breathless and he couldn’t resist reaching out and running his hand up Steve’s bicep, where his tan faded into near-white skin.
When it came down to a competition between his own happiness and the safety of the world, it was no contest.
“Yeah,” Tony grimaced. “If it helps, things are still awkward between me and her too. Want me to make it up to you?”
And there was something niggling at the back of his brain, like a toddler desperate for attention poking him in the ribs. With a sigh, Steve rolled over and grabbed his laptop. He winced when the screen burst into life and the brightness almost blinded him. Squinting, he tapped in his password and smacked the brightness button until he could see without the image being burned into his retinas. Grabbing his glasses from the table, Steve leaned his laptop against his steepled knees, opened the internet and googled
He’d promised Pepper he wouldn’t use the app, and he’d meant it. But his phone was just sitting there, and it was a temptation, blinking up at him.
“I’m gonna try. Goodbye Tony,” Steve said, managing a smile for him. “Enjoy your life. You deserve it.”
He scrolled through the thesis, most of which he didn’t understand - biology was another subject he hadn’t exactly excelled at - but he was able to work out the gist of it. And the gist was a hypothetical description of how real life mermaids would look and act, theorising on diet and communication and even mating habits, which prompted Steve’s mind to start wandering until he firmly clamped down on
“Not sure your legs can take that,” Tony said, helping Steve to his feet. Steve hummed in agreement, but he didn’t look happy about it.
With one final lingering kiss, Tony sat back, pulling his t-shirt over his head and Steve just stared. Technically he’d seen Tony naked before, the night they sexted, but the pictures were nothing compared to the real thing. Steve’s brain stalled, his eyes drinking in the sight of Tony in front of him, all compact muscle and a lattice of scars littering his torso around the blue light of the arc reactor.
Alexander smiled at him then turned back to Warren. “I will leave you in Steve’s very capable hands. But think about what I said.”
“I never wanted to bond with Arnie,” he said. “He was my best friend and he helped me through a bad heat, but we were never going to be anything more than that. I’m not pining for what could’ve been.”
“Yes, I do,” Peggy murmured, leaning in to kiss Daniel. “Alright: drinks. Steve, Tony, help yourselves. Alcohol on that table, soft drinks on that one. And why are we all hiding in the kitchen? There’s a party going on.”
“I did not. I don’t think anyone does. I mean, if Clint knew then everyone would know which is why we
“Finish the school day, and then you are on indefinite leave until we can find a way to make this work.”
Steve clenched his fists, his anger growing. “But he never told you when they died? Or, or came to help you or anything?”
“What?” Clint exclaimed, throwing his hands. “Why are you all hating on my beard? Bruce: beard, yes or no?”
But if he was going to reveal Ellie to the world, there would be questions about her sire. Which meant that he needed to take a road trip upstate.
Even as he smiled at Tony, Steve’s throat grew tight. He tried to clear it as quietly as possible to hide the fact his heart was breaking.
Steve printed out copies of the PDFs, hiding them in his bedroom before returning to his laptop. Glancing at Rhodey and Sharon, he felt a burst of guilt before deleting that file forever.
Lunch started at two pm, and it didn’t finish until well after six. Though no one shows any inclination of going home as they all gather in the living room. They’ve been really patient, barely anyone has mentioned the huge mound of gifts under the tree. Even Peter, who is young enough to be super excited, hasn’t mentioned the presents. But Tony is now shifting with anticipation as he eyes the boxes. Steve laughs as Tony wriggles next to him. Natasha is smirking at them from where she’s curled up on the sofa with Clint’s head in her lap. Lucky, Clint’s dog, is thumping his tail lazily against the floor. Bruce is napping in the recliner next to the sofa where Tony, Steve, and Bucky are cuddled up together. The others are all crowded around Peter’s new game that Tony spent most of November designing. They’d allowed him to have it whilst they were waiting for lunch; it was easier to keep a fifteen year old occupied with a game than it was to try and keep him busy with something else.
“You stayed up with me all night,” Steve murmured, “even when I got snot all over your favourite jumper, you weren’t angry. You just laughed and made us cocoa; we watched the sun come up from the roof of your apartment building.”
“You know I left some toast in the toaster for you, there was no need to steal mine,” Steve says mildly sitting down next to Clint. “Come on Tony, just sit and eat with us for once.”
“More than good,” Peter grins, and Tony hugs him even closer, dreading the minute he’s going to have to let his son go again. “Love you, Dad,” Peter whispers into Tony’s chest.
The common floor living room is empty; Tony knew it would be, most of the time the team doesn't start getting up and ready for the day until later in the morning. Steve would be in the kitchen, reading the paper and eating after his run; if Tony was lucky, there would be spare food for him to steal. Gold rays of the rising sun stream in through the floor to ceiling windows coating the room in a soft, warm light. It is spring in New York and the world is just about waking up from the winter. This is the kind of weather Tony loves, the kind of weather he loved in California, not cold enough for things to be grey and miserable and not warm enough for there to be too many bugs.
Tony and the rest of the team burst into the room. The face place and helmet of the Iron Man suit are nowhere to be seen; Steve has never been so grateful to see Tony’s face. Bruce has been brought in to assist Tony with the medical care Bucky desperately needs. Though he can see that Natasha has a tight grip on Bruce’s hand. Clint and Sam split from the group to follow Wanda as soon as Steve tells them that she went to find Peter alone. Tony grits his teeth, it looks like it’s physically painful for him to not follow them; but when he kneels next to Bucky and looks at his wounds, he’s wholly focussed.
“Try the East. Then move on to the West.” Steve must notice something in his voice because he doesn't even ask Tony, why the usually disobedient component of their team has given in to being a proper soldier. “Don’t stay quiet on the comms, let us know what you're doing, Iron Man.” He’s all business, his voice is hard, and Tony knows that this is the soldier that helped win the war for America.
“He was diagnosed with PTSD two weeks or so ago,” Steve shrugs, he was going to debrief the team about it the day Peter was taken. “He’s had one to two before, things have been hard on him, and I don’t think he got the right kind of support after his mom and dad died, I don’t know, but Tony’s good with it.” Steve is telling the truth, Tony knows exactly how to coax Peter out of his panic attacks, he’s seen it before.
“I’m not doing it for you. Well, not wholly for you,” Bucky shakes his head, taking Tony’s hand. “What you said about doing even just one kid some good. That was me, back in the day, ’n’ Stevie too. We had no one, back then, no one who was like us. Not in the media anyway. I didn't know that what I was feeling when I looked at fellas was normal, not before Stevie and I properly looked around Brooklyn. Yeah, I guess that got me thinkin’ what if I could help someone you know? To actually help someone by doing this, then anything that happens to me is worth it, I’ve been through worse; I came out the other side ‘a that with two amazing fellas on my arms. I know this charity is important, so I’m gonna do this.”
Bucky is standing in front of the door to Tony’s workshop; he’s been there for the past fifteen minutes, debating whether or not to go in. His arm is twinging, he thinks he did something to it on the last mission. Guilt is bubbling through him, as he thinks back to last night, he hates the idea of lying to Tony, of telling him that everything is fine; that he and Steve totally did not have a moment, that he hasn't thought of kissing Steve in the last few days. Music is blasting through the walls, Bucky can hear it, and feel the vibrations of the bass; Tony must be working on something, he thinks about asking JARVIS if Tony is too busy to see him, but that would just make his making a decision inevitable. Hovering outside the workshop seems like the best plan for the time being, he worries his lip between his teeth, wringing his hands until his arm gives another twinge. He definitely did something to it on the last mission, this twinge was enough to make him draw in a breath and for his knees to go weak.
“And the date, J?” Tony asks because he isn’t entirely sure, he remembers heading down to the lab on a Monday.
“Tony!” Pepper doesn't yell, she doesn’t scream, but Tony can see the nervous glint in her eyes. “You need to get down here right now. I haven’t even briefed you yet. God, I don’t even know if James wants to do the conference, I have a seat here for him, but you never told me if he wanted to come along yet.”
“I love it when you get all rebellious,” Tony grins pulling him down the hall towards his room, not before he pushes him against the wall outside and kisses him thoroughly.
Inside the building its a mess of dripping walls, with mould and damp streaking down them. Tony is flying; he doesn't want to make a sound, in case he alerts the guards; at least, he thinks there’re guards. He feels Clint land behind him, he hears the soft rush of air and the thump of boots; and he knows he has backup inside the building now, he enjoys the sense of confidence it gives him. Clint slips past him, darting down the corridor to the right, he moves entirely soundlessly; like a ghost. Tony watches him go, letting out a puff of air before he flies off down the opposite corridor.
“Shit,” Bucky says, looking down at Tony’s relaxed face, his hair is sticking to his forehead both damp with sweat; but there’s no panic etched into his features, he looks peaceful. Bucky really doesn't want to move him, but he also knows that Tony really shouldn't spend a night on the sofa. “Come on; Stark lets get you to bed.”
“Also JARVIS, these agents don’t seem like normal HYDRA operatives. I’ve never seen this symbol before,” Steve say his voice slightly crackly through the comms, even though Tony can see his vitals it’s a relief to hear his voice, “can you tell us who’s running this joint?”
“I love you,” Steve whispers against his lips, “I love you so much. But, I need to know that you are one hundred percent with this because I couldn't stand it if I knew that whatever happened between Bucky and me was hurting you.”
“Yeah, that about covers it,” Rhodey, mutters “they don’t seem to know where they’ve been, Dr Banner is working on that, along with some SHEILD psyches. They’re going to try and bring the memories out, but we need your permission for Peter, he’s still under eighteen, so-“
“Hey guys,” Clint walks into the room, “you checked that your spawn is still alive? I wouldn't trust Barnes with my cactus, let alone my child.”  He jumps up on the counter, swinging his legs as he begins to re-fletch his arrows.
“He’s here because he wants to be, because he is supporting the project too, and because he is representing the rest of the Avengers,” Tony smiles and gestures for Bucky to speak.
“You can’t love two people at once, таша,” Bucky sighs sadly, fiddling with the pillow, rolling the tassels between the fingers of his metal hand.
“Just queue up a flight path for the mark IV,” Tony stops himself from shouting, just, he can feel the warmth from Steve’s hand; he leans into it, just barely, an imperceptible amount.
“Peter!” Bucky calls out, looking around the penthouse, “Peter! Where’re you kid, your dad said we can for ice cream and a flick!”
“Don’t forget who volunteered to look after your spawn tonight, Stark,” Clint sneers, but there’s no real venom behind it.
Steve has never really felt so present in a moment, not since the serum, since the war, but for once he allows himself to be there when Tony reaches for his hand. A comforting presence, Tony’s warm calloused fingers seem to ground him, they hold him to the present. Bucky’s foot has somehow found his under the table, their feet are pressed up against each other. Steve notices that Bucky looks less tired than he has done in a long time. It is like some sort of invisible weight has been lifted from his shoulders, his hair is tied up in a loose bun and he’s wearing a ripped tank top and sweatpants, but Steve can't help but think that Bucky is beautiful. Tony is casting quick glances between the two of them, while he listens to Peter talk about his latest science project; Steve catches his eye, Tony winks which sends Steve into a fit of giggles. All thoughts of hatred and bigotry are gone from his mind replaced with thoughts of love and family, Steve has never felt so loved before, now though he feels full of it.
“We can tell them the truth, and then we’re going to go and get Bucky and Peter back,” Natasha has that glint in her eye, which means that Clint won’t be getting a quiet night in with Kate and his dog.
“They aren't food,” Tony mutters rolling his eyes, but he smiles and winks at them. “Clinton eats like a frat brother. I don’t think I’ve seen him ever eat a vegetable. Not only that but he treats this place like a frat house, fletching his arrows on surfaces the people eat on, honestly.”
“Feels a little stiff, Stark,” Bucky teases lightly, “maybe your engineering ain’t as good as you think it is.” This brings out a slightly offended noise from Tony and a small squeak from Peter. “I think you need to let Peter take a look at it. I think he could do a bang-up job of it.” Bucky grins a little when Peter laughs.
It takes no more than a slight hesitation for Steve to give in and let Tony sit him down to breakfast, Peter and Bucky are both laughing at a private joke; Tony is demanding to be informed about said joke. Steve pretends not to notice as Clint sneaks his dog through the common room through the door that leads to his room; he instead turns to laugh at whatever it is that Peter and Bucky are telling Tony about. He feels so at home, in a way that he thought would never happen again, it feels like a blanket of warmth has settled itself over his shoulders. There is not a spare thought in his head for the people outside the tower with signs, they are pushed from his head with his thoughts of love for his family. In the rational part of his brain, the part that he can never quite switch off, he knows that they still have so much to talk about; so much left to work out, but he forces himself not to think about it.
“Move up, Widow, and remember during missions its codenames only,” Steve directs, “do you agree, Iron Man?”
“Mister Barnes and Master Parker left approximately five hours ago, they have not returned,” JARVIS answers Steve’s first question, and the next one he was going to ask.
Tony’s office isn't huge; he explains that Pepper has the biggest office since she’s CEO and he took a smaller one, which he only uses for meeting business partners and the like. There’s a sofa with two small armchairs at one of the room; Tony sits Peter down on the couch with a glass of water in front of him. Peter is pale, and his face looks pinched and worried, but Tony sits down next to him; the boy seems to calm with Tony’s presence. Tony reaches behind him and pulls the cushion out from beneath his back; he offers it to Peter, the kid takes it and holds it to his chest with both arms cross in front of him.
“Do you mind if Steve comes with us?” Tony says, looking at Peter again, “if you don’t want him in there, all you have to do is say.” Steve is shocked by how patient and kind Tony is being, even though he knows that the only thing Tony wants to do right then is get everything over and done with.
The coffee cup shatters as it hits the floor of the workshop, along with about five thousand dollars worth of scanning equipment. Tony curses as he wraps his cut hand in a rag; he kicks the poxy machine, it didn't work. All of his efforts have been poured into scanning machines, he’s coded, and built as he has never done before. But, none of it has worked, and now all he wants to do is curl into a ball and die. Part of him is grateful to Natasha and Clint; they worked hard to remove every last drop of alcohol from the tower; another part of him wants a drink. Every bone in his body aches, with loss. It is as though he has lost his purpose. Which he knows is a terrible thought, because he has Steve. Steve, who has been nothing but perfect, and good and gold like he is, but it hasn't helped, and Tony knows Steve knows. Though he continues to try every single day. Nothing will help, until they have people hold or bodies to bury.
“Probably Peter, honestly,” Steve sighs. “We all know that wasn’t really about Clint and his questionable eating habits though, was it? We’ll talk about that while we’re out, but before that, Buck; what was the movie like?”
Four hours later and Steve is banging his head against Tony’s shoulder as Tony tries to explain the selfie Olympics, Bucky watches as he sends Tony more videos of cute dogs. They’ve shifted from their original position, once for a bathroom break and once for popcorn; Steve’s now cradled in the V of Tony’s legs while Bucky has his head in Steve’s lap. The screens JARVIS has in front of them are great, they can show several different sites all at once, Bucky is currently watching a video made up of many different videos of cats falling off things. Steve’s phone is still going crazy with people retweeting his first tweet.
“I can hear you thinking, please just go to sleep,” Steve whispers in his ear, “we’re going to have so many mornings like this, you don’t need to take all of this one in.”
Tony was making French toast and trying not to think about how quiet the tower felt the next morning when JARVIS announced, “Sir, Miss Potts is on the line.”
Tony kissed his way up Steve’s neck, sucking another bruise into his flushed skin, speeding up both his hips and his hands.
“I… I loved him. Or I thought I did,” Steve shrugged. “Haven’t you ever been with someone who you thought you were in love with?”
“But even so,” Bucky continued, “He’s still in a war zone. I don’t know how to cope with that. I love him.”
“You’re listed as his next of kin and the VA won’t give me any information because I’m not his next of kin,” Michelle explained.
She was perfect. Whatever happened, Steve would always be grateful to his old friend for helping him through the worst heat of his life and he would never regret it, not when it led to the birth of his perfect daughter.
Darting across the bedroom to the bedside cabinet, he retrieved the lube before climbing up onto the mattress, straddling Steve’s thigh. Drizzling lube onto his hand, he smiled down at Steve, who nodded encouragingly. Wrapping his hand around Steve’s dick, he stroked him to full hardness, a shiver running through him with every groan punched from Steve’s lips.
He didn’t doubt Tony’s abilities. On the contrary, he believed in Tony more than he’d ever believed in anyone. He just hated watching someone he loved in danger when he could do nothing to protect them.
Tony pocketed his wallet and his phone, checking there were no new messages from Steve first, before chivvying Bucky towards the door.
He wasn’t mad. Not the way he smiled softly when Tony handed over the carton of The King of the Mangoes, adding, “Your favourite, I believe”
“Okay,” Bruce replied. He put the file of the girl he’d just released into the appropriate tray then crossed the nurses’ station, following Clint and Scott towards the waiting room. “Who?”
Once dry and dressed in clean pyjamas - Tony’s pants fitted Steve, even if they only came to his ankles - they made their way to the bedroom. Tony peeled back the covers then fell onto the mattress, practically asleep by the time his head hit the mattress.
He could remember very clearly the last time he’d tried to organise his thoughts by writing music. Five, nearly six years ago now.
They all stood as instructed when the judge entered the courtroom, then Steve tightened his grip of Tony’s hand as the judge called for the defendant to be brought in. The doors opened and Luchino Nefaria was guided to the stand, somehow managing to look defiantly charming even in a prison jumpsuit and chains. His gaze swept across the gallery, his eyes lingering on Steve.
Watching Lorna’s face light up with glee chased away the lingering discomfort from her argument with Sharon that morning, warming Natasha in a way only a handful of patients managed. Natasha leaned forward, examining Lorna’s arm carefully.
And it was getting on Steve’s last nerve, but he bit back his frustration. It wasn’t his students’ fault that he was hungover.
“So, what happened here?” Natasha asked, turning her attention to Lorna’s left arm, which was purpling and held awkwardly to her body. “Because that looks sore.”
Steve snuck a glance up at him to see if he meant that. Arnie caught him looking and rolled his eyes.
He’d never met the Avengers before - except for Bucky, of course - but Steve recognised them instantly from pictures and video clips and new reports. Hell, Tumblr was filled with photos and fan art of them almost every day. Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff were in the kitchen, while Bucky sprawled in a chair at the head of the table, drinking beer with Thor. And Clint Barton was leaning over the island with a determined expression.
Pym hummed. “I never understood how Howard could disown his only child. There’s nothing Hope could do which would make me disown her. Well, except maybe dating Lang.”
He sat back, kneeling between Steve’s legs as Steve spread them to make more room for him. Tony’s breath caught at the picture Steve made, spread out before him, his chest covered with a sheen of sweat, his hair in disarray, and his legs wide, drawing attention to the bulge in his jeans.
“Hey, sunflowers,” Angie called when he arrived at the apartment. “Your favourite. Where’d you get them?”
“No, Tony, you don’t. The problem isn’t you, or Iron Man. The problem is me. The problem is I hate seeing the people I love in danger. I can’t just stand by and do nothing. But when you’re in danger, there’s nothing I can do. That’s something I need to find a way to deal with.”
. “Steve you don’t know how happy you make me feel. Of course I… love you too. I love being with you but I don’t want you to give up sex just to be with me. I can’t do an open relationship so you won’t be able to have sex with other people. You’ll grow to resent me and we’ll still end up breaking up later down the line. You can’t lie and say you don’t want to have sex with me,” he points out.
Tony stands in front of the mirror and nervously adjusts the cuffs of his bespoke suit. He fiddles with the cufflinks shaped like the atoms of the element he created (a present from Rhodey for his forty-something birthday) and tries to breathe in slowly and calm his nerves. This is his fifth and probably last date with Steve and he wants to commemorate the moment with his most polished look. The suit is his armor and it’ll carry him through to the bitter end.
“Hold on,” Steve says and be actually has his hands in the time out sign. “Can we back up a few steps? So, you’re saying, you like me and want to be with me, but you just don’t want to have sex with me―or anyone else for that matter?”
“Tony, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I haven’t really been in any relationships since I was found in the ice. I don’t… sex wasn’t really ever important to me. I can honestly say the only people I’ve ever wanted to have sex with are Peggy and you. So, yes, I’m attracted to you… sexually―I hope that doesn’t make you feel uncomfortable―but I don’t need sex. I love you, and I want to be with you, sex would have been just another part of that, but certainly not the most important part. If you’re still up for it, will you be my fella?”
That somber thought sinks Tony’s mood like lead for the rest of dinner and he stays uncharacteristically silent, letting Steve fill the space between them with words. Steve shoots him a few confused looks but he doesn’t bring up the change and allows Tony to stew in his own thoughts.
Steve has that determined ‘this mission is too important to fail’ face on, but he looks nervous underneath it. He looks vulnerable and Tony realizes that he’s not the only who’s afraid of this ending. He wants to give in, to tell Steve they can try this, but he’s so
“Who do you think? Bucky, of course. He was always going on about how a properly done up tie and a good suit would help me get a dame. Turns out, I need the opposite for a fella.”
“So, you can’t be with anyone? Why did you say yes to going out with me? God, Tony, you didn’t have to do that to spare my feelings. Have I been forcing myself on you? Oh God, we’ve kissed and touched so much…” Steve trails off and Tony’s head snaps up to meet Steve’s anguished eyes. He looks horrified and Tony feels bile rise up in his throat. He’s messed this up in the worst way possible.
“Tony? Are you ok? Did I hurt you?” Steve asks. He sounds so concerned and Tony feels wretched. He shouldn’t have ever let it get this far. It wasn’t fair to Steve, letting him get invested in a relationship that was never going to last. But, the temptation had been too much when Steve had first asked him out. At least now, when they fell apart, Tony would have the memory of what it was like to be Steve Rogers’ boyfriend to help him deal with the loss.
Steve shakes his head. “No, of course not, Tony. I’m not saying any of that. I believe you and I’m trying to say… it doesn’t matter to me. I don’t care if we never have sex. If you still want to and are able to be in a relationship with me, that’s what I want. I,” he pauses, but continues when Tony gives him an encouraging look, “I think you already know this, but I love you. I don’t need sex in a relationship and if you’re okay with it, I’d like it if we continued to see each other.”
Tony pauses to gauge Steve’s reaction. He looks less hurt and more curious, and he nods, as if to tell Tony to continue. “Anyway, I’m not sure how thorough SHIELD’s dossier on sexuality was, but if you’ve heard the term asexual, that is what I am. What it means differs for each person, but for me, personally, I don’t feel sexual attraction. I don’t ever feel the need to have sex and the thought of it actually makes me uncomfortable.” Tony takes a deep breath.
Tony concentrates on breathing, trying to quell the rising panic in his chest. He flinches as Steve starts to press kisses down his throat. He should move, he tells himself. He should touch Steve through his pants. Maybe if he gets Steve off quickly, he won’t be expected to strip, to try to get hard. He lifts his hand and then drops it. He can’t.
Dinner is lively and fun; Tony forgets for a while that he’ll have to give Steve up at the end of the night. They talk about the last villain they fought, about the team, about their day, and about themselves. Steve never looks bored as Tony regales him with the details of his newest project. He’s attentive and asks questions, looking genuinely interested in what Tony has to say.
Tony shakes his head fondly and takes Steve’s tie in hand, quickly and efficiently assembling a perfect knot. He presses the tie down and lightly taps Steve’s chest. “Who did this for you before I came along?”
Tony grabs Steve’s hand, interlacing their fingers together. “Like I said, I very much like holding hands and cuddling. I like the kisses too, though I’m not too into the whole tongue thing.” He tries to keep his tone light. He’s still nervous but he feels hopeful.
A low whistle cuts through his thoughts and he turns away from the mirror to catch sight of Steve in his own suit, leaning against the door frame. His tie is loose around his neck and he’s barefoot. He looks so comfortable and soft that Tony’s breath catches.
. He doesn’t want to try it and have Steve realize he can’t be in a sexless relationship further down the line. On the other hand, Steve is honest and he wouldn’t tell Tony he could do it if he didn’t think he could.
“Any reason you couldn't make him do it now?” Tony asks. Bucky might have a metal arm now, but it is perfectly calibrated, so even intricate and delicate tasks are within his scope. It would have been faster if Steve had just asked his best friend to fix his tie rather than coming to Tony.
“So, we’ll take this one day at a time. I have a lot to read up on and I’d like it if you helped me understand this more fully. But, can’t we try?” Steve asks. He looks like he’s holding himself back from touching Tony; he’s a tactile person, Tony has learned.
He knows he should step back; knows he should push Steve away like he planned and gently end this with dignity but he can’t. He loves Steve and he’s desperate to hold onto him.
“Come on, we’ll be late for our dinner reservations,” Tony says. He doesn’t miss the look of disappointed wistfulness on Steve’s face and his gut fills with ice. He won’t be able to avoid it tonight. Steve has been patient for the last month, but surely tonight he’ll push for something more than the kisses and the cuddles they’ve shared so far. Tony slips his hands into his pockets and clenches them into fists, ruining the crisp lines of his slacks. He can’t delay the inevitable.
He turns away from Steve and walks to his bed. He sits down on the edge and hunches his shoulders, feeling small and worn down. A moment later, the bed dips as Steve sits down next to him. “Can you please explain?” Steve asks, his voice soft and filled with worry.
“Steve, no! No, you never forced yourself on me! Just because I don’t feel sexual attraction doesn’t mean I don’t like or want to be with you. I like you a lot, I love dating you; this last month has been amazing. And the kisses, the cuddles, the hand holding? All of that I love. It’s the other stuff I can’t do,” Tony clarifies.
“So, it’s not you. It’s emphatically me. I’m sorry for wasting your time, I hope we can at least still be friends,” Tony says tiredly.
“That’s cheating, using your 1940’s Brooklyn charm on me,” Tony says weakly. “I want to say yes Steve, you have no idea how much. I just don’t want either of us to be hurt later on.”
It’s refreshing, to be listened to rather than tolerated. It’s not unlike talking to Rhodey or Bruce but unlike them, Steve looks at Tony like he hung the moon in the sky. Tony probably doesn’t look much better and he listens just as intently as Steve describes his visit to the VA office with Sam and Bucky. How he’s teaching Wanda hand to hand combat. The bet he won against Nat; something to do with doing 300 pushups in a ludicrous time frame. Steve is animated and excited, letting Tony see a side that’s usually locked behind the professional Captain America mask he dons for the public.
Tony hesitantly nods, unsure where Steve is going with this. Steve blows out a breath and gives Tony a tiny smile. “Well, I’ll admit, I’m still a little confused and we definitely have to talk more about this, but I don’t know why we can’t still be in a relationship? I understand if you don’t want to be in one, but it sounds like you
break his heart. He can see in it Steve's tender gazes, feel it in his gentle touches, and almost taste it on his lips. Steve Rogers is in love with him and tonight Tony will break his heart and his own in the process.
“We’ll talk about it all in the morning,” he murmurs and feels Steve nod. He reaches across Steve’s chest and drags his arm up until they’re holding hands again.
He has the length of time it will take for him to drive them back to the compound to enjoy their relationship. He supposes it is a blessing that they haven’t exchanged “I love yous”; it would be so much harder to walk away if they had. Tony glances at Steve. He looks vibrant, anticipatory, his leg bouncing and his gaze… meeting Tony’s own. Tony quickly looks back at the road but he can’t help but lift one hand off the wheel and place it on the divider between them. After a moment, he feels Steve's hand settle over his own, and then feels a light squeeze that he returns. If only they could hold hands forever.
Steve smiles softly and places his hand over Tony’s on his chest. “I like it when you do it.” He draws Tony’s hand to his mouth and drops a kiss on the back. His eyes have that certain look in them and Tony knows what is coming, has time to prepare himself when Steve drops his hand and draws him in for a kiss. It is...pleasant. Chaste. Just a sweet press of lips. Tony kisses back and then draws away quickly before Steve can deepen it.
Steve winks at Tony and Tony suppresses a smile. Ever since he had admitted he loved the 1940’s vocabulary that Steve sometimes dropped, Steve had been playing it up, even letting his Brooklyn drawl grow more exaggerated. Tony feels fondness, sweet and slow like molasses, fill him up every time Steve indulges him.
He isn’t sure what tomorrow will bring and maybe they’ll crash and burn, but for now, he’s going to live in the moment, accept the love that Steve feels for him and love him back just as hard. They had made it this far, and perhaps they’d make it a little further, together.
“I’m still capable of wanting a romantic relationship, I just don’t want the more carnal, physical aspects. I like you, I want to date you, I want to go on dates and spend time with you. I like holding hands and when we cuddle while watching movies or before bed. I like the little kisses we’ve shared. I just can’t do more. So, I’m so sorry that I led you on like this. I’ll give you time. I can leave the compound if you need some time away from me. I’ll tell the team it was all on me, because it was.”
“You’d think I’d get used to seeing in you in a suit, but I’m never ready,” Steve says. He approaches Tony and points at his neck with a pleading expression on his face. “Can you do the tie for me?”
“I don’t… understand?” Steve asks. He looks marginally less panicked but his expression is skeptical, as if he thinks Tony is trying to spare his feelings and merely placating him.
As Tony predicted, once they arrive back at the compound, Steve follows Tony to his room. They don’t run into anyone, for which he is grateful, but he slows his steps the closer they get to his door. His hands are sweating and his heart feels like it is beating out of his chest. His breathing grows unsteady as he feels Steve crowd against his back. He knows Steve can hear his heart, can probably hear his rapid breathing. He is sure Steve will mistake them as signs of Tony’s mutual arousal, rather than the fear it really is.
He steps back, breaking Steve’s hold. For a moment, Steve reaches towards him, looking aroused but confused. He drops his hand when he sees the stricken expression on Tony’s face, concern flooding onto his own face, dimming the arousal.
Tony doesn’t know what to say; his heart is soaring, hearing Steve’s confession but he still isn’t sure Steve
Tony pays for dinner and resists the urge to suggest they stop for ice cream on the way home. He knows what is coming and hopes he can do it with dignity. Steve will kiss him, maybe press him against the door and run his hands down Tony’s body. Tony will have to push him away. He’ll regretfully step away from Steve and avoid the hurt in his eyes and say, honestly, “It’s not you, it’s me.”
. Surely even Steve wouldn’t be kind enough to stay friends with the ex who broke his heart. And Tony knows it
“Steve, didn’t you hear me? I can’t have sex. I don’t want to have sex, and no matter how much time passes or how patient you are, it’s not going to change. I’ve been to doctors and therapists, tried meds, tried everything. I’m done thinking something is wrong with me; I’ve accepted that this is a part of me and that it’s not wrong and I’m not broken,” Tony says. He’s been here before, his partners trying to understand but pushing him to go to the doctor, to try to find a ‘cure’. He hopes Steve isn’t asking him to do that.
Tony cuts him off, desperate to correct Steve’s misconceptions. “No, please, it’s not you! It’s completely about me. You’re right, I have had sex before, though a lot of the stories you’ve probably heard are also exaggerated. It took me years to realize that no matter how hard I tried, I wasn’t going to come to like sex if I just had it enough. But I was scared, I thought something was wrong with me, or that I was less of a man because I couldn’t do it. So I tried and did a lot of things I wasn’t comfortable with. But since Pepper, I told myself that I wouldn’t do that again. It isn’t fair to my partners and it’s not fair to me.”
As soon as Tony opens his door, Steve pulls him into a kiss. This one is a complete contrast to the kiss they shared earlier. Instead of a chaste, sweet thing, it is deep, Steve’s tongue licking against Tony’s mouth and sweeping inside when Tony reluctantly parts them. His hands grip Tony’s arms, wrinkling the suit jacket and crushing Tony to his chest. His whole body is a hot brand against Tony and―there, pressed against his thigh―he can feel Steve’s cock.
“You talk it out,” Natasha says it like it’s the most simple thing in the world. “You’ve got to talk and talk, then talk some more. Everyone has to be happy with what’s going on, and that doesn’t just take one conversation, котенок; if you don’t talk it out, then someone’s going to end up getting hurt. But, that’s the same in every relationship.”
“Warm,” he says, “your skin, it feels warm, not the way I remember, Stevie. Don’t have a fever heat to you now do you? You’re warmer than him though, he’s cool, like water; don’t mind though, ‘ts nice,” Bucky’s smiling, so wide in a way that Tony can only describe as completely happy. “Both of you have ridiculously smooth skin, that ain’t fair. I wanna touch everything now, this is the coolest thing ever, how am I going to be able to repay you?”
“JARVIS is a traitor,” Peter mumbles but he sits up and grins at Steve anyway, “is Bucky okay? You spent ages at the hospital, I hope he didn't get hurt cause of me. Really, I’m not that important, you didn't need to all come after me.”
Steve grips his friend’s hand as he fumbles for the nanobot stuff that Tony gave him before the mission. “You’re not going to die, Buck,” Steve says, his hands are shaking so badly that he’s worried he’s going to set the spray off in the wrong direction and waste it. “That’s an order.” He says in his firmest Captain America voice, smiling when Bucky lifts his hand and salutes him. The nanobot spray is a miracle; Steve notices as he sprays it on to Bucky’s wounds, and watches the skin, muscles and tissues knit together.
“He sounds, like a good friend, with good taste in comics.” Bucky nods seriously, “you know, I used ta show Stevie loads of the best comics too.” Bucky perches on the bed, smiling when he sees Peter’s face lose some of the sadness. “We used t’ save for weeks to get them, then we’d read ‘em in bed, where it was warm.” He can practically feel Steve’s smile from where he sits; he looks up to see it, it blinds him. “Remember, Steve?”
“A sticky situation?” Tony’s eyebrow works its way further up his forehead, Clint doesn’t know how that’s even possible. “Do I want to know?”
“I just thought it was because you didn't want me to hide away in there on my birthday,” Peter shrugs.
“Fuck,” Tony says, dropping his head on to Ben’s chest. “What the hell am I going to do?” His voice cracks, his tears have not stopped falling.
“JARVIS, update on Bucky please,” he’s only been gone forty-five minutes, but he’s too tired to think of anything else.
“Can you do it?” Peter asks, looking up at Tony, and yeah, Tony will never get used to seeing his eyes looking back at him.
“I am with this,” Tony nods, in a way he’s trying to convince himself, he just squashes the emotions down and smiles. He knows that this is going to be good, but there is a certain amount of trepidation that’s eating into his mind.
“Tony I,” his voice comes out hoarse and croaky, it’s deep like he hasn’t spoken in weeks, “Tony, can I- Can I kiss you?” Tony lets out a huff of laughter, but he brings Steve’s face down to his, the hand that had been tracing Steve’s cheek is now fisted in the front of his shirt. Steve forgets how to think as their lips touch, the only thing that exists is Tony, the only thing he can feel is Tony. They stand there in Steve’s room, kissing for what feels like hours until Steve’s lungs are burning from lack of oxygen.
“We should do that post,” Tony laughs, pulling out his phone. “Come on Steve, Bucky, Petey. Are you ready to break the internet?”
“I’m still arguing with them about that,” Tony sighs, “he think’s he’s a monster. Honestly, I came pretty fucking close to throwing my chair at Fury’s face when he said it; no one says my son is a monster, so yeah if you wanna punch him I’d let you.” Tony buries his face into the crook of Steve’s neck. Tony’s hands are around Steve’s waist; Steve pulls back slightly and presses their lips together in a chaste kiss that was meant more as a comfort than anything else.
