“Like Christmas, only with more me,” he smirked; pleased with the eye roll he received.
“Tony,” he breathed out, causing the clanking sound to stop and Tony to turn slightly.
, Tony.”
He tried to push himself up on shaking arms, making it only so far as to lean his back against the wall so he was sitting upright.
“Well,
Letting out an exasperated breath, Steve turned to leave, only for Tony’s quiet call of his name to stop him.
“Let’s get this movie started, shall we?” he asked, voice light.
“Yeah, I’d have no one to snark with,” Clint grinned at him.
Steve lets alcohol get to him and Natasha is an expert at teasing.
Tony felt pride well up in his chest like a bubble of hot air fit to burst.
“Agent, I need you to report in for duty immediately. We have a reconnaissance mission you need to take over.”
“I’m real good with engines, Steve. I mean, real, real, good. I can boost the hydraulics, get speed from her you ain’t never dreamed about.”
“Oh,” Tony frowned. He missed her as well.
“So, where were we?” He asked, taking two different flavoured cider mugs and handing one over to Tony with a small smile.
“Darcy bakes,” Tony said idly, watching as Bruce headed for the kettle while Clint wandered pseudo-casually over to the cakes.
“It’s what people do when they make unbreakable promises. This means I won’t break this promise, not that I’d ever want to,” Tony said, as much conviction in his eleven-year-old voice as he could manage.
“Pep, Pepper, my darling,” Tony grinned, finding unending amusement in the calm facade he knew was hiding a wealth of irritation.
“What was mama like?”
“And I wouldn’t have had such a wonderful childhood, with such incredible memories of a loving brother. Hell, I wouldn’t have even known my own mother if it wasn’t for you, Tony,” Darcy said, reaching out to gently touch his arm.
“It is what it is, big guy,” Tony smiled slightly with a shrug. “Rumiko and I would’ve never worked anyway. It was good while it lasted, but ain’t nothin’ lasts forever.”
“Totally awesome, big bro,” she let out a small laugh before quickly ducking over to him for a short, tight, hug.
Returning to Planeta Stark was definitely not something he thought he’d ever do, in fact it had been pretty high up on his list of things to never do. However, Tony had figured he’d have a good few hours to look around before Steve’s curfew of sundown hit and he’d have to be back on the ship, hopefully in time for them to get off the planet without a problem.
Clint stood up straight, the familiar upward tick of his mouth indicating he was about to launch into an argument with Tony about something stupid, again. Steve, however, seemed to notice the same thing, and before the archer could get started he stepped between them, a warm hand coming to rest against Tony’s back and he gently guided him towards the couch.
“Oh really?” Tony could feel an answering smile quirking his lips as he wondered what new skill Darcy was planning on accomplishing this week. The girl was notorious for trying out new things, working tirelessly at them for a week before either declaring herself to have mastered them or that they were not appropriate skills for her repertoire and moving onto something new.
They didn’t even get a chance to take the picture before the explosion rocked the vehicle. Tony found himself thrown to the side of the humvee, shock and horrified realisation hitting him in turns. Time blurred quickly as he watched the soldiers surrounding him, who he had just been
“Refrain from blowing up anything and we won’t have to find out.”
It had been a while since something shaken Steve so much. But, he supposed that radiation mutated, cannibalistic sub-humans would do that to most anyone.
“What?” Steve asked, tilting his head up so that both ears were free.
Steve couldn’t have wiped the smile off his face for a thousands credits.
Refusing to look up from his own plate of the same protein pack, Steve took an angry bite of his own.
Pulling back, he was relieved to see the pleased look on Tony’s face.
Ta me de – fuck
“Tony?” Darcy pulled at his shirt again, apparently sick of being ignored.
Steve gave into the urge to reach for him, and rested a hand on his shoulder.
“You saw,” he said, voice oddly flat.
“When Tony found out, he was furious. He used a Good Night Kiss on me and I awoke the next morning in the front gardens of my house.”
“You help Tony in his workshop, do you?” Steve asked the bot, a smile lighting his face when Dummy suddenly grabbed hold of the bottom of his shirt and gently tugged him towards where Butterfingers and You were more cautiously sitting back and watching the proceedings.
“As long as you’re having fun, and you’re safe,” Pepper smiled at her.
“Twenty-five credit, twenty-five credit. You want, Mister, you pay,” the seedy-looking man gestured emphatically with his hand, the fancy rings weighing down each finger catching the muted light. His yellowed teeth were visible in a sly smile, and Steve knew he was getting ripped off with the price.
“Hey,” Tony said quietly to Rhodey, eyes trained on his sister so he didn’t have to look at his friend. “Thanks.”
Tony let out a hum as he fiddled with the electronic file, keying it into his system so that Jarvis could extract the information for him.
Tony blinked at him in genuine surprise. It appeared that, while he’d wanted to ask, he’d been expecting Steve to reject his request and dump him on whatever was the closest planet.
As he got comfortable, Pepper sighed and sat down next to his hip, her eyes worried.
*edited 2019*
“Old boyfriend?” Clint tilted his head, a smile playing at his lips.
“Don’t worry, Jarvis and I totally hooked them up with a brand-new motor oil can each,” Darcy stage whispered, bursting into loud laughter when the excited beeps and pleased whirls from all three bots made themselves known.
“I will be. I have to do this.”
The hand on his shoulder squeezed him gently.
“I think we need to get in the sky, then have a talk,” Steve said, eyes trained on Tony.
He only had a moment to register a series of text messages from Darcy, the latest just being his name with a question mark, when suddenly one of the bombs that had been going off around him landed in the sand beside him.
“Okay,” Steve said gently, offering Tony a small smile when the man opened his eyes and looked at him again.
“Nice to meet you both,” the woman said, shaking Steve’s hand. “My name’s Darcy Lewis.”
“That’s fine, because I love to be handed things. So, let’s trade,” Pepper said smoothly ignoring his behaviour as usual, swapping her Champagne flute for the folder, before taking Tony’s glass and pushing the file into his hands, making him take it lest he drop it. “Thank you,” she said, taking a sip of his drink.
“Hey, wait, I’m still tied up!” Tony yelled.
The words spewed forth from Rogers’ mouth were hurtful, designed to hit their target dead-on, no missing at all. Tony could say with complete honesty, he wasn’t a fan of having his dark thoughts put in the spot light.
“We should have thrown a party to welcome them. With streamers and lots of cans of motor oil,” Tony said, a touch saddened by the missed opportunity.
“Stop sulking,” Pepper broke into his sul-
“Fujikawa and Viastone are direct competitors. If we tried to accuse them of something like this, even if we could prove it, the public image of the company would be ruined,” Rumiko said, her mouth tight with what Steve suspected was annoyance.
Steve stood silent for a long moment before letting out a curse.
It took a moment for Steve to realise that Tony wasn’t talking to him, but to the
“Pepper, you never let me have any fun,” he sighed, flopping back in his chair for a dramatic flair.
The smile faded entirely, however, when Tony made it to the bathroom and pulled out his rectangular blood toxicity reader. Feeling the small pinch in his thumb, followed by the evidence of the rising level of poison in his blood stream, caused his heart to clench. Falling forwards onto the sink, he stared at his reflection as emotions warred within him.
“Surely, we can spare a few hours, Steve?” Natasha looked at him and their eyes locked.
It would be very bad if that turned out to be the case. Steve had no desire to show up on the Universal Security Council’s radar. Nothing good would come from a dead man showing up alive. He’d be labelled as a deserter, a traitor to the supposedly peaceful government organisation that ran the universe. There was no doubt that they’d take The Avenger, incarcerate the rest of his crew and sentence Steve to death as an example of what happened to people like him who didn’t follow their rules.
There it was.
Steve sighed and finally gave up, turning to step into the cargo hold properly and reached for the control panel that would allow him to raise the ramp and seal the ship up.
– motherfucker
When the doors finally opened, Tony quickly exited, making a beeline straight for the large couch he usually shared with Darcy and Jane. Sitting down, he was pleased to see that only Clint had arrived thus far, the archer sitting in the armchair Natasha usually claimed.
Steve Rogers,” Tony spoke up, sounding amused as he nudged an elbow into his side.
“Verily, this is most excellent news. To have such strong and courageous worriers both cut from the same family cloth is a great honour,” Thor boomed. Tony raised an eyebrow at the way the god was speaking. If he didn’t know better, he’d say the god was amping up his flowery language for a certain doctor’s benefit.
“Mister Stark, we need to talk,” Agent Phil Coulson’s voice suddenly sounded over the phone. Tony pulled a face, causing Darcy to let out a small laugh, before he reached over the picked it up his StarkPhone. Holding it before him so he could see Phil’s face, Tony finally spoke to him.
“Miss Potts, apologies for the rough treatment. I’m sure you, better than I, understand why it was necessary?” Steve watched as she stared back at him, giving no indication either way.
“Do they actually offer the program you want to do?” he finally asked, semi-admitting defeat.
Giving the metal in his hands one last look, frustration and anger filling him, Tony walked towards where Jarvis stood at the entrance to the lounge room, holding out the scrap metal when he was close enough.
Darcy started groaning before Tony could even finish.
” He asked instead, looking over at Steve with a small smile beginning to lift his lips.
!” Tony cursed suddenly, hand retreating from the flames and sticking his thumb into his mouth.
“Go ‘way,” he groaned, bringing his arms up to cover his head in the absence of a pillow to hide under.
“Oh, yeah, calm. That’s really goin’ to help us,” Clint snarked, hands white knuckled on the controls.
“So, we’ve heard,” Natasha said, eyes evaluating the new comer.
“Heaven forbid the paper ever just report some of the good stuff that’s going on in the world,” Clint snarked.
“What is this ‘Ravencroft Asylum’?” Thor asked, looking at the others for some kind of explanation.
Tony felt his eyes go wide and he swung around to look at her, almost pulling her off balance from where she was still leaning against his side.
“Tony,” Steve huffed, arms crossing over his chest in growing annoyance. “I ain’t askin’ here.”
The last thing they needed was for Captain America to turn his back on his country and wander around like some homeless nomad.
“Steady,” Steve said quietly. Thor, Tony and Natasha were trying their best to blend in with the few people still milling around the electrically lit street, the red dirt the planet was covered in appearing almost black beneath their feet.
“I’ve been here before, once or twice. Didn’t get to see the sights either, I’m afraid. Business is business.”
“Indeed, Sir. Perhaps, if you’re having difficulties remembering the exact location of the kitchen coffee pot, you might consider taking a nap instead of caffeinating?”
“Of course. He was pretty rough before, my first ever
Tony went quickly to Darcy, pulling her from the room and moving down the hallway as fast as her smaller legs could go. The threat of their father following them was at the forefront of Tony’s mind.
When JARVIS had opened the elevator onto the community level, which housed the kitchen, everyone’s main goal at the moment, they had all come to a stop only a few steps into the room.
“I have to admit, Tony, I really didn’t think I’d ever see this day,” Obie said conversationally, moving around the room and proceeding to pour himself a glass of whiskey out of the crystal decanter that had Tony’s grandfather’s name carved elaborately onto the side.
“Heard more about your brother, but I’ve heard stuff about you, too.” The nasty look Loki shot him confirmed he’d hit a nerve and Tony chuckled.
He waited another few minutes before emerging from his hiding place. Dusting down his clothes, he took a step towards his ship when a voice startled him.
Tony glanced at him, mind still not fully online from where he stood between the other two occupants in the box.
“Yeah, not today,” Steve couldn’t keep the small smile off his face. He’d sooner see his ship in ruins then allow the USC to get their hands on his crew.
“Hi, Rhodey!” Darcy’s voice came loudly from the tinny speakers of Tony’s phone. Honestly, he needed to do something about using other people’s phones, he’d improved the laughably clunky Microsoft tablet that had been knocking about the local market, and phones should logically be the next step. Just because he was a weapons dealer didn’t mean he couldn’t branch out a bit.
“Ow!” he hissed, trying to jerk away from her, but she was freakishly strong when she felt like it.
Tony wasn’t hard to find when returned to The Avenger. The man was sitting on one of the deck chairs Clint and Thor frequently sprawled in when they were picking up passengers and doing some honest work for a change. Despite his odd behaviour on the planet so far, he didn’t look surprised to see the rest of the crew, minus Thor and Bruce – the latter of whom was standing beside Tony conversing with him – when they arrived.
“You’re in bed. You looked like death warmed over when I saw you, so I thought a few hours couldn’t hurt,” Pepper’s familiar voice came from the window. Looking around, he saw her still sitting in the large chair, a Starkpad in hand and her hair almost on fire in the early afternoon sun.
“This here is Rumiko Fujikawa. She is part of the Fujikawa Industries family,” Nick made the introductions. “Rumiko, this here is Captain Steve Rogers of the Avenger. He’s out best bet at getting Doctor Helen Cho back.”
“I will never be able to replace you, ya dummy. You’re too important for me to even try - hey!”
“Okay, Avengers Assemble,” Captain America said.
“It’s called the Super Secret Ingredient Chocolate Cake,” Darcy said, grinning at them all.
“Oh, gimme,” he unashamedly reached into the bowl and took out a large, sticky handful. As the opening music began to fill the room, Tony didn’t say anything when Steve’s thigh ended up pressed against his own. He remained silent when, at one point during the movie, Steve’s arm somehow appeared on the back of the couch behind him. He definitely didn’t make any noise when said arm pressed against the back of his neck, almost but not quite curling around his shoulders.
“No, I just wanna stay down here with you,” she looked up at him with large eyes. “Please?”
“Thor! Faster!” Steve yelled, relying mostly on Natasha’s ability to shoot with precision as he was mostly out of commission thanks to holding onto the mechanic and trying to keep his balance.
“What’s Captain Amewica?” Darcy asked around her thumb.
“Ready, Captain,” Clint announced a moment later.
“Where exactly does one find some foodstuffs around here, anyway?” He changed topics, looking around as if the protein packs were going to materialise from nowhere for him.
Jane inclined her head to them, a small smile on her face.
“He’s going to be insufferable for a week, now,” Natasha lamented, though there was something thoughtful about the way she was eyeing Steve across the table.
“We’re still waitin’ on one of them to return, the rest of you can go on ahead, we’ll catch up.”
“He brought you back to the ship because you were one mug from tripping over your own feet. Hardly date-worthy material at the time. I’m sure if you asked him, properly and soberly, if he wanted to take a short trip to the Gods statue in Aquamarine, he’d be perfectly willing to oblige.”
“Master Tony.”
“Well,” a bitter smile crossed his face. “I should hope I was a little informed given I was sold to them for some years.”
“What’re you doing here? I thought you and Jane were going back to New Mexico for a while,” Tony peered over her shoulder at where Jane was standing awkwardly next to the elevators. “Hi, Jane,” he let go of Darcy with one of his hands to offer her a small wave.
Even if Maria Stark hadn’t been much of a mother while she was alive, Tony was going to make damn sure that she was the most amazing mother in the world in death.
Tony hummed lowly, body relaxing back onto the medical chair as he closed his eyes again, his still weakened body quickly succumbing to a healing sleep.
The Ten Rings had been a surprise. He knew there were terrorist organisations in the world, what else was he making all those weapons for? But, to know that such a group was being supplied with his companies’ own weapons? That they were his ‘loyal customers’ as Yinsen said. He had effectively aided in the killing of American soldiers, perhaps not pulling the trigger himself, but supplying the means. He felt sick to his stomach every time he thought about it. The sheer stockpile they had of them, how had that even happened? Who would betray him like that?
“If you want to know what I’d do,” Tony finally said, looking up at Steve. “I’d take what we can use and stick the rest in the airlock and blast it back into space. Having this much around, it’s bound to cause problems.”
“Why are you sulking?” Bruce asked, leaning a hip on the counter, arms loosely crossed over his chest, as he waited for the water to boil.
This didn’t make
“Tasha loves me,” he pouted, and Steve gave up on the both of them, opting as usual to ignore whatever bizarre relationship they had going on. As long as it never affected the rest of the crew, they could do as they wanted amongst themselves.
Tony was up and off the couch before he was even consciously aware of what he was doing, half of it an automatic reaction to the familiarly yelled words and half an instinctive need to protect his sister. A quick glance at his father revealed Howard clearly about to launch into a long, loud, and aggressive tirade about inconsiderate children interrupting him.
The Avengers crew had been different. They clearly had secrets, some of them legal, but they’d seemed to genuinely be interested in him and wanted him to stay on with them after Ariel. Tony had felt something he hadn’t in years, a sense of belonging. So, after only a few months, Tony had thrown his lot in with a ragtag crew of sometimes law-abiding citizens.
“I could just get up and grab another cup,” Tony said reasonably, eyes flickering to the coffee pot on the counter.
“Good. Now, listen up, because you’re a smart guy - not genius level like me, but you’ve got a good head on your shoulders. People love Captain America. What happened to you with the whole freezing time jump thing is awful. We can’t say we understand, but we at least acknowledge that it’s screwed up and unfair on you, which is more than a lot of people get in life. So, you need to stop letting it control yours. You’re so determined to dislike the future and compare it to your idealistic memories of the past that you haven’t even tried to involve yourself in the world as it is now. Not everything in the here and now is out to get you, or to make you remember that it’s no longer in the 1940s. The world is at your fingertips; the globe is your oyster. There is so much to do, so much to see - wait, no, that’s Disney,” Tony snorted, amused with himself despite the important message he was trying to convey.
“Captain Rogers, might I remind you that the Avengers Initiative is a part of SHIELD?” Fury gritted back.
Gently, as if she was a delicate piece of glass or a fragile piece of circuitry, Tony ran a finger down a chubby cheek, the softness warm beneath his finger tip.
“I could turn you in for the reward money,” Steve said. Nothing in his character would ever allow Steve to do such a thing, but the words were worth it if they inspired just a little bit of sense in Tony.
“Oh, Avengers stuff!” Darcy was up and off the couch faster than Tony had expected, and he suddenly had a familiar shadow following him over to the stand of screens he’d set up off to the side.
“I’m here, I’m here,” he whispered into her hair like a mantra, at a loss for what else he could possibly say to comfort her when the world as they knew it had just been completely, irrevocably changed.
“Yeah, what’d you need, Jarvis?” Tony asked, pulling away from her and moving back over to his desk.
His first instinct was to get up and get out of there, however as soon as he levered himself to his feet with the aid of the wall, the world swam before his eyes and starbursts blocked his vision. Disorientated, and feeling his stomach rebel at the change in altitude, he stumbled blindly forward for a moment before a chase lounge tripped him up and he collapsed onto it. Desperately, he tried to simultaneously swallow the bile building in his throat and blink away the floaters in his eyes so he could once more see.
“We’ve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign,” Pepper gently pushed Darcy from the frame, excitement also visible on her face as she began rapidly firing off ideas and lists of what they’d have to do in the near future.
“Every time! Every single fucking time!
“Incomin' from the USC Skiff,” Clint glanced back at Steve, looking for his permission to accept it.
“Let’s get back to the ship.”
“Please, let her stay with me. I can’t - I can’t stand the thought of her so far away now that she’s all that I have left. Please, I’ll do anything you want me to do with the company and those designs you’ve been asking me about, the ones that’ll make dad’s missiles more aerodynamic, I’ll get to working on them right away. Just-” he hugged Darcy to his chest tighter, pressing his face into her hair and just breathing in deeply for a moment. Her familiar smell bringing the comfort of home to him.
“Jarvis, where’s the coffee?” he asked, staring at his empty cup as if that was all that was required to get more.
Climbing onto the crate attached to the bike, Steve steadied himself as Clint revved the engine before the machine jerked forwards, taking off down the ramp and onto the sandy soil of Tadamori.
“Come on, Tony. You can do it,” Steve encouraged, a comforting squeeze to his sounders accompanying his words.
“Indeed, we shall drink tonight in thanks,” Thor said, his large grin still dimmed.
"Nothin', just thought I recognised somethin', but it's no bother."
“I’m sorry, this is the ‘fun-vee’, the ‘hum-drum-vee' is back there,” Tony waved him off, no desire to listen to the other man’s complaints about his hangover again. It wasn’t Tony’s fault that the soldier didn’t know moderation.
“Well, I suppose I should say
Reaching out, Tony grabbed the metal bar that acted as a lock, and twisted it around before pulling it upwards, the metallic squeal of cogs shifting behind the door. Holding it with both hands, Tony pulled the heavy door slowly open, peering into the darkness as he did so.
(See the end of the chapter for
A slightly hysterical part of Tony marvelled that Traveller may have in fact been slightly psychic with an ability to see the future, as he was sure Darcy would no longer speak to him after this.
“Tony?” Darcy’s sleep-muffled voice called out, causing Tony to look over from where he had been sitting on his stool before holoscreens for the past few hours.
“It’s good to hear you’re making friends, Darcy,” Pepper said.
“I’m not glaring.” Steve half-heartedly protested.
Tony was peacefully sleeping away in his bed, pillow once more on the floor and covers twisted around his legs, one arm up above his head and he may have been snoring slightly, though he’d never admit it, when the tranquil atmosphere was broken by his sister.
He managed to get a hit into Obie’s side, before he shoved the older man off him and scrambled to his feet. Snatching up the heavy ornate lamp, he turned around as Obie began to get to his feet and he didn’t think, he just swung.
Steve snorted to himself, putting down his drawing tool and moving over to Tony.
Steve tilted his head just enough so that he could shoot a look behind them, disguising his hand resting high on his thigh near his gun holster as him simply repositioning himself.
“Tony, my name is Steve Rogers, I’m one of the volunteer care-taking nurses at the Institute, remember? I’ve been working with you since you came here,” Steve took a step closer to Tony, as if Tony was a colt about to attempt escape.
“The escape pods are still here, Steve,” she hissed quietly, body tense.
“That was almost poetic, Cap,” he finally said.
When they arrived on the communal floor, Tony only had long enough to glance around and take note of everyone already being there, before Darcy was in his face, her hands reaching for Sparky and a high pitch noise emitting from her throat.
– we are in big trouble
“I am. We could use someone like you,” Steve nodded slightly, refusing to examine why he was pushing this so hard. Even if Clint had said that the man was a good addition, it was ultimately up to Steve to keep them all in the sky with limited threats of incarceration.
“Yeah, okay. Just, like, an hour and I’ll be good to go again,” he yawned, eyes already beginning to drop as his body recognised the comfortable surface he was lying on, the recent coffee not strong enough to combat his body’s exhaustion.
“It was a present,” Tony said quietly, body still tense and uncomfortable with how Howard was between him and Darcy.
Steve was pretty sure that operating on desperate people to try and save their lives after the hospitals had told them they were as good as dead, was a minor sin in the grand scheme of things.
Tony slammed his eyes shut and tiled his head up, but one loan tear still managed to slide down his face. Steve reached up and wiped it away, but didn’t say anything else about it.
“Take Pepper and go to my office at SI,” he carefully explained what he needed her to do as he passed her the drive.
“I guess that’s one way to describe it,” he cleared his throat and shifted awkwardly, feeling warm down to his bones as he once more lifted his ale and took a large gulp, largely just for something to do with his hands.
In the end, Tony managed to establish a series of facts within his mind.
“I’ll see what I can do, Tony. But you need to understand that this is a very delicate situation and needs to be handled with the utmost care. If we go after this, guns blazing, your sister could get hurt. And nobody wants that, do they?”
The Avengers might be earth’s mightiest heroes, but it still took almost a full month for them to learn about Tony’s quirk after they had moved into the tower. This was despite the fact that various members had wandered into recently abandoned, half completed dishes, table wipes and even a memorable occasion where Thor ended up slipping over onto his back due to a half finished floor mopping.
Thankfully, it wasn’t too much further to the ship, and as Thor rode the bike up the ramp, Natasha had sprung off the bike and hit the button to raise the ramp.
Steve felt his stomach twist unhappily at her words.
Steve drank deeply of the cheap ale the bar was selling, eyes tracking the loud music and chatter that surrounded him.
“You think so?” he asked quietly, the hopefulness painfully obvious in his voice.
“Reavers,” Clint grunted.
“You want me to turn the ship around, to go over four days outta our way, just so you can do somethin’ you ain’t even gonna tell me about, on a tiny planet where we won’t get no job? You must be moonbrained, maybe we need to get you to the bughouse?” Steve snorted, unamused.
“I’m sure it’s something you’ll enjoy,” Steve said, naïvely optimistically.
He definitely recalled parting from her. He’d wanted to check out all the changes that he could while he was on planet. There had been a part of him, small and completely irrational so not worth listening to, that had believed that as soon as he’d stepped foot back here, that there would be men waiting with guns for him on the docks, ready to take him away. He was good, but even Tony wasn’t sure he’d be able to survive another kidnaping like last time. But, that had been pushed aside in the faceless sea of people that swamped the streets. He figured if he kept on the move, to the middle of the masses where no one ever looked anyone in the eye, he’d be fine for his little sightseeing adventure.
“If I may, Sir?” Jarvis asked, the holoscreen before Tony lighting up brighter as the AI took control and proceeded to dress the area with a simple, slightly old-fashioned finish.
“I’ll think on it,” Tony finally said, when the silence between them had become awkward.
“You are terrifying,” he said, amused despite himself.
“Don’t pretend like you’ve never had her give you a manicure, because I’ve seen the pictures,” Steve shot back with a slightly arrogant tilt of his head.
A soft, blue light filled the room, and Steve found himself frozen, bloodied shirt in one hand, scissors in the other, Tony’s hand still weakly holding onto his wrist. He stared at the man lying before him, the bloody wound barely registering as his eyes were stuck on the strange blue disc of light that peaked through Tony’s fingers.
“No, Steve, please. You have to know who you are; you’re Captain America. We’re part of a team. Remember Clint, Natasha, Thor and Bruce. You were a soldier in the second World War, but you were frozen for decades. We saved the world from Loki only a few months ago.”
What the hell was going on? One minute Tony’s in a battle with a hallucination creating wizard wannabe, the next he’s meant to be in what looked like a psychiatric hospital as a patent? He’d never thought a hallucinogenic magical power could be this realistic.
He noted absentmindedly that he could make out Thor standing at the ring tossing stall, Clint behind and to the side of him as he cheered him on.
“We should only be an hour,” Steve explained as Clint and Thor finished loading the goods onto the transport bike.
The SHIELD soldier sent him a particularly venomous look, but turned his attention to escorting Doctor Cho towards another ship that was awaiting her to depart.
The harvest festival on Eris was already in full swing when they descended the ramp onto the planet. A large tree was at the centre of the festivities, with baskets hung from its branches filled with various vegetables and fruits that had no doubt been collected by the planets occupants. Various locals and tourists alike wandered about, partaking in activities held at the rickety looking booths that had no doubt sprouted up just for the festival. A selection of simple games were lined up to one side, barely visible through the crowds, the familiar ring tossing game the only one Steve could clearly see.
He didn’t, however, say that.
“Twenty credits,” he repeated calmly, not interested in bartering with the man too much as he wanted to get back on his ship and into the sky. He had deliveries that needed to be made and a schedule to keep.
“It’s fine, Rhodey. We’re fine,” he let go of Darcy’s hand - that had somehow made its way back into his own - only to pull her closer into his side. The warmth of her small frame grounding him.
"What's so amusin'?" he asked, quietly.
“Let’s assume that the Doctor’s plan involves breaking out some of the patients here, so be on the lookout for them. Detain without force as much as possible, but we can’t have anyone leaving the grounds until we have the situation under control. Doctor Traveller is still our primary objective, so make sure you have your comms on at all times, no blackouts,” Captain America glanced at each of the Avengers as he spoke.
“The hospital, please, Happy,” Pepper immediately said.
“It was one time!” Tony groaned, remembering a particularly celebrity stuck individual who had, indeed, gotten a bit light headed around him.
“Firstly, not okay. I help you get away from laser tottin’ crazies and you tie me to a chair in thanks? Were you raised on a Rim asteroid? Secondly, I am not with the USC – I ain’t even sure how you jumped to that conclusion. I’m the last person to wanna buddy it up with those people. Seriously, why would I get on a ship with a crew of criminals if I was with the USC?” He paused, a thoughtful look on his face for a moment.
"We can get a new pilot," Steve yelled back.
“The Avengers moved into the Tower weeks ago, Darcy,” Tony said cautiously, body tense and waiting for the bomb to drop.
“I read all about your accident. That much gamma radiation should have killed you,” he said, watching Bruce carefully.
to use your stupid modern technology to read my fucking news!” Steve suddenly yelled, standing up abruptly and sending his chair careening backwards with a loud clatter onto the ground.
It was… incredible.
“Just so you’re aware,” he called out as Tony moved to the kitchen. “We need to make a short stop on Tadamori before we reach Ariel. We’ve been tasked with delivering some supplies to them. I hope that ain’t no problem?”
“Tony?”
“Tony certainly isn’t flying with us just for the joy of working on the Avenger’s engine,” she said with a smirk, before walking past him, headed for her bunk.
He knew she didn’t mean anything by it, but it still hurt. Darcy’s public appearances had been few and far between for years now, something he was finding he had to argue increasingly with Obie about. Tony knew it was something that helped to keep her safe, no one was kidnapping or threatening someone they didn’t recognise. Initially, Obie had been helpful in keeping Darcy out of the limelight, paying off those who needed some persuasion to refer to Darcy as ‘Lewis’ rather than ‘Stark’, sighting Tony as the face of the company, not his, of average intelligence, sister. Recently, however, Obie seemed to have realised the potential Darcy offered in establishing a connection between Stark Industries and other, powerful companies overseas or wealthy potential investors. He had been pushing for her to meet various wealthy,
“Problem solved,” he shrugged, aiming for casual nonchalance, but he was pretty sure he achieved awkward simpleton instead.
“Get my finger nice and wet, baby, ‘cos I’m going to push it so far into you, you’ll see stars.”
“Not to mention Rhodey’s angry phone call where I got to listen to him going on about you flying unregistered in American airspace,” she raised an eyebrow at him, a look remarkably reminisce of Pepper’s usual one.
“Look,” he finally tore his eyes away from the book and looked at Steve, mouth drawn hard with determination. “If you can’t swing it, no problem. Drop me off on the nearest planet with an intergalactic shippin’ station and I’ll make my own way.”
“Any time, Tony. I mean that,” Rhodey said, voice completely serious.
“‘Scuse me, I seem to remember it was someone else who was causin’ us all the problems just a little while ago?” Clint snorted loudly.
“Remember what I said, don’t move.” He ordered, a shiver of delight running up his spine when Tony groaned.
"Are you askin' me out on a date?"
“Thor,” Steve called out to the large man who had yet to wander too far off.
“You met Pepper?” Tony peered up at him with surprise.
Steve carefully pushed himself along the wreckage towards the man, he didn’t want to push too hard and end up floating off in zero-gravity space, it would be a pain in the ass to get back to the ship without a point to propel himself off of.
“Set a course for the Rim planets, it’s not good to be this deep into the Core,” he continued.
“So, what you’re saying is that the Hulk…” the man glanced away with a mirthless smile. “The other guy saved my life? That’s nice. It’s a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?”
Slowly turning the knob and pushing open the heavy wood, Tony cautiously entered the room. All disused rooms in the manor were white walled, with neutral cream furniture, but the large double bed usually in the middle of the room was missing. In its place was a fancy looking cot, with a small single pushed into the back corner of the room.
Sitting on the couch with his sister while a movie played before them wasn’t all that unusual, Tony had been doing in since before the DVD was even invented and Darcy had spent a week carrying around a CD soundtrack from Aqua - of all godforsaken bands - claiming that she wanted to ‘watch’ the film. He’s also spent an entire Summer watching and re-watching the animated Alice in Wonderland movie,
Tony blinked, looking at what he had been designing with tired eyes. He had put off working on the Captain’s floor in Stark Tower out of a combination of not knowing where to start, and petty annoyance that he still held towards the man after their argument on the Helicarrier. He didn’t want to examine the small part of his mind that whispered about still being
“Pleasure doin’ business with you,” the stranger tipped an imaginary hat and quickly turned to Steve and his crew. “Let’s go before he decides he don’t much like our transaction.”
“Alright,” Steve finally said. “I wanna meet your friend before either of you steps foot on me ship, though,” he continued.
Gently pulling free his fingers, Steve added more lube to his hand before dropping the tube off the side of the couch and stroking his cock so it was sufficiently covered. Reaching down, Steve slowly pulled Tony’s hand away, his finger shinny from the excess lube Steve had used. Moving closer, Steve released the badly shaking right hand from holding Tony’s leg, allowing both legs to hook over his shoulders and Tony’s hands to grasp tightly in Steve’s hair, his breath ragged.
“I could give you something else that could do with a good polish?”
“Tony’s not back yet.”
Well. Tony could always claim the flush to his cheeks was from anger once he saw the half-burned state of the kitchen.
, was best known for. Natasha had sauntered out of the crowd, her clothes as perfect as when she’d left, a small smile lurking at the corner of her mouth that suggested she’d been up to something that she wouldn’t be sharing with the rest of them. A normal look on her face, after a planet visit. Thor, too, returned victoriously with the new pressure belt, although the boisterous grin matched the small pouch he kept touching at his hip, no doubt holding something of value that he’d managed to persuade someone to part with.
“He looks incredible. Can I pat him?” Steve asked, leaning slightly into Tony’s space, eyes hopeful as they darted between Tony and Sparky.
There was a tense moment, where neither of them moved, just stared at one another, before the large man let out an angry sounding grunt.
“You?” Tony prompted helpfully.
“I hear we picked up a mechanic,” she said upon seeing him, her head tilted slightly to the side in question, causing her short red hair to brush against her cheek.
“Is this about the Avengers?” Pepper asked curiously. “Which I know nothing about,” she added at the look Phil shot her. Tony wasn’t sure why the man was surprised, he always discussed ridiculous ideas with Pepper - Fury’s meetings always leading to numerous hours of cross examination between them and a bottle of Screaming Eagle Cabernet Savingon. Tony believed it was an appropriate choice.
“We have an agreement.”
Clint, who’d looked surprised by the comment as they’d previously been under the working assumption that Tony didn’t even hear them when he was in one of his cleaning zones, suddenly burst into delighted sounding laughter.
“Let’s not stay too long. Go out, get what you need and restock, then back on the ship,” Steve told his crew, eyes darting around looking for the one man not part of it.
Thank you, honestly, from the bottom of my heart for those who are still sticking with this. There's only one chapter after this and it's all wrapped up, but here's the first - and last - chapter in Tony's POV.
The USC had just thrown him aside when he’d refused to commit mass genocide.
“Steve,” Clint butted into the conversation, voice pitched high with nerves.
He leant an elbow on the table, cushioning his chin on his palm, the other hand still free to gesture as he spoke. The fact that he was sitting at an empty plate with no clear indicators that he was actually going to get up and get himself something to eat, didn’t seem to bother him.
“Go do some study or something,” he waved a hand dismissively at his sister, but she only laughed.
“Ever seen somethin’ like that before?” Steve asked quietly, not taking his eyes from Tony’s sleeping form.
“I’m good at ‘em, is all. Always have been good at anythin' involvin’ buildin’,” Tony looked faintly pleased with himself, clearly confident with his abilities.
“You were only seven, I thought you’d forgotten about it,” Tony admitted, fingers running over the mechanical dog's body, finding small nicks and scrapes that his mind immediately started working on ways to fix.
“Is the invitation for the rest of my crew as well, Miss Potts?” Steve asked, relenting.
“It’ll be okay, Obie knows about the arc reactor. That should keep his attention for a while,” Tony sighed before wincing, his aching ribs once more making themselves known. It had been a bargaining chip, a band aid to a gaping wound. He knew that it was only a matter of time before Obie came demanding more than just the knowledge of what Tony had been able to do. He would want the process, patented and in production. It was a gold mine, a forever battery some might say. Any business savvy person would be crazy not to want to market it.
“What? No, what the hell are you trying to pull? Let me go, Igor!” Tony snapped, trying to crane his head again to see the man holding him, only to falter slightly when he saw a perfectly normal looking man behind him.
“I really hate that you still hang around that McGee kid. Always up in my business,” he muttered, reminded of the last time he’d seen the kid and had been forced to ‘accidentally’ knock the kids’ recorder off the table and stomp on it when he’d said something without realising the stupid thing was on. Kid was going to be a real J. Jonah Jameson at the rate he was going.
Stronger Than Iron
He could just avoid them in the Tower, that wouldn’t be too hard. Sure, the kitchen on the communal floor had the best coffee maker, and he might miss the team dinners and movie watching that they had done, but it wouldn’t kill him to no longer be a part of that. He was Tony Stark. As long as everyone else was happy, he didn’t need anything else.
“Right, I don’t know about you lot, but I want cake,” he said, rubbing his hands together as a real smile pulled up his lips at the thought of all the sweets that would be waiting for them when they arrived in the kitchen.
“I am not a mad scientist,” he waved a fork in Bruce’s general direction, trying to chew faster so he could finish talking. “I am a mad genius, get it right.”
“Good. Darcy was serious about that StarkPlayer, by the way,” Tony couldn’t keep the amusement off his face. “She’s been complaining about it since you seized it; said you gave Jane back her research, but you’re keeping the StarkPlayer hostage,” He continued, pointedly.
Instantly, Tony tried to get back up and escape.
Well.
“Oh,” Tony moaned quietly, immediately going to pull his finger out and thrust.
“Well, you have got a flat ass,” Tony agreed in amusement.
,” Clint called after her, rubbing his arm.
“Hey, let’s go to bed.” He pulled Tony closer, hugging him gently before moving away slightly, keeping the arm Tony was holding onto around him still, Steve began to steer them towards the elevator.
“Her name is Darcy Maria Lewis Stark,” Jarvis said softly from behind him, having followed at a more sedate pace.
It took them another half an hour – Earth-that-was time – before they managed to find someone who had a dusty stockpile of semi-legal looking engine parts, including a newer model compression core.
“See, Steve knows how to be appreciative,” Darcy leaned into Tony’s side, grinning at the super soldier.
“Tony, we’re needed downstairs,” Pepper’s voice cut off Tony’s absentminded search on his StarkPad for possible countries to escape to.
“Tony,” Darcy groaned loudly, hand coming up to her forehead in what was a remarkable display of exasperation for a thirteen-year-old.
all the time. I just can’t take that seriously, so many jokes in one word,” he shook his head. “I’ll never be able to talk to you without laughing. I mean, what can I say, I’m a child at heart and immature jokes get me every time,” he offered a slightly apologetic shrug.
“Would you like to look at the menu, or just have your usual coffee?” Steve asked, smiling at him.
“It’s not,” Tony stubbornly tried to tell himself, the water creeping up his shoulders now, body shivering so uncontrollably that he had to clench his teeth to prevent them from chattering.
“Steve,” he turned slightly, and wasn’t surprised to see Natasha standing there. “It was for the safety of the ship.”
Silence fell over the table again, not even Clint filled it with the sound of his chewing. The crew looked slightly chagrined for having pried into Tony’s past, while Steve felt as though he was on an emotional rollercoaster.
“That glowin’ light powerin’ his human suit says different.”
“Yes, it looks as though Tony will make a full recover in no time,” Bruce said.
“It’s okay. You looked like you could use the sleep,” Steve smiled at him.
He’d have almost preferred the yelling.
“Crew members will be on time, or they’ll get left on planet,” he said, pointedly.
“Clint,” Steve snapped.
The rumble of laughter that swept over his crew members earned a glare from Steve, embarrassment be damned.
“Ah, is she hiding my disc-man under the table again?” Tony grinned, more amused than worried by her behaviour.
“Tiberius and I knew each other a long time ago. I’m not convinced that if he saw me today, he wouldn’t immediately recognise who I was.”
“It’s amazing, Darc,” he said, clearing his throat in the hopes of dislodging whatever had gotten stuck in it.
“Indeed,” Obie looked at him, before knocking back half his glass.
“How?” he managed to get out, voice rough.
Tian na - holy shit/gosh
“Oh wow, did you make sure to thank him for teaching you all this stuff?” he asked, thinking that Jarvis was taking something of a gamble with teaching his well-meaning, but loose tongued sister the secret ingredient in his Super Secret Ingredient Chocolate Cake.
“Of course, doctor,” Steve glanced behind to Traveller, the attentive look of a student learning from their teacher on his face.
“I believe she has it hidden under the couch cushion this time,” Jarvis turned to receive the luggage Tony had brought home with him from the driver.
“Clint,” Steve sighed, glancing at him from where he stood beside Tony.
“Agreed, somethin’ went down here. But, that don’t mean we can’t reap some kind of benefit from stumblin’ across the ship now,” Steve said, gesturing for Thor to leave the room and begin the trek back to the rest of the crew.
“Iridium… what do they need the iridium for?”
“A stupid one,” her voice was firm.
“Hmm?”
“Well, that’s different,” he absently patted Dummy when the bot nudged his shoulder, seeking attention.
He wasn’t entirely sure how long he was out of it for, but the world was fuzzy around the edges and he was so comfortable that the idea of opening his eyes didn’t even merit thinking about. He was pretty sure that someone said something, then there was a reply which sounded deeper and oddly rumbly, but Tony was content to tune them out as he relaxed into his pillow.
“Without you as the man of iron, there is no Avengers team,” Thor said, voice just booming as usual.
“Young Miss Darcy is in the foyer attempting to convince me that she is, indeed, doing her lesson work.”
I just... motivation guys, it's a struggle sometimes.
“Tony! Just tell me what’s going on. The last time you were this secretive about your projects you were building the Iron Man suit,” she huffed.
“What!” Tony squawked, ignoring any attention the noise gained him from the surrounding soldiers.
“Fine, but
, Tony thought as he was lectured on proper safety protocols. Seriously, Tony didn’t need this crap from a man who had deliberately disobeyed orders to get where he was in life… Okay, the 70-year sleep had probably been a surprise to Rogers as well, but really. Then he insulted the Tower and, honestly, Tony sternly told his libido to get lost and focus on someone not as infuriating.
“Got everythin’ we needed, Captain,” Clint said, cheerfully jostling the large sack hanging over his shoulder.
“What’s happened?” He asked as he hurried down the stairs, the loud thumping of his shoes on the metal heard over the engine roaring to life as they began their ascent into the sky.
“Oh, my god! I-I’m so, I mean, it just,” she made a gesture with her hand that Tony took to mean: ‘the words literally burst from my mouth with no prior thought to what they might be and what that would mean for my employed status’, as she fumbled with trying to form an apology.
“That’s cool. We can totally share,” Darcy said, and pulled Tony into the elevator.
“Hence the name ‘Pepper’, right?” Darcy asked from the couch, a bit of amusement tinging her voice again.
“You’re sayin’ it’s a prosthetic? In his chest?” Steve turned to him in disbelief.
They say the truth will set you free.
“I understand,” Tony got out, teeth clenched together but a faint glimmer of relief rushing through him. He didn’t like the answer he had been given, but it was better than nothing, and right now he had nothing.
Tony grinned and stood himself, stretching slightly before following Steve to the counter, offering a token protest once more about paying for their coffee and food, only to be shushed before they headed outside once more in the direction of the Tower.
Steve only managed a quick order for everyone to be back by sunset, before Tony had slipped into the crowded streets of the port with a vague hand wave to acknowledge he’d heard. Despite his issues with stopping on Palneta Stark, he still continued his habit of losing the rest of the crew within the first five minutes of being on planet. Steve nodded vaguely to the others, confident that they would be able to sort out the ships various needs with little difficulty, before he discretely followed behind Tony.
Steve sighed as he looked at it all.
Sitting down at the table in his normal seat, Steve looked over at Tony who was single-mindedly using his fork to break apart the food, though none of it ever made it to his mouth.
Steve clenched his jaw for a moment before focusing on the more important and pressing issues.
– Drooling prostitute son
When he’d finished, Tony looked about the area for a moment, before dropping the rock and turning away from the small graveyard, heading in a roundabout way back towards the main street of the town.
“Ay, I saw many things of value as we walked through. Tis strange though, as if the occupants simply vanished into the Dark,” Thor frowned, an expression not normally found on the jovial man’s face.
“So,” he looked over at Tony, noting the faint blush beginning to rise in his cheeks. “Shall we?”
“Not at all,” Tony grinned at him over his shoulder, a few too many teeth showing.
“He’s insisting, Sir.”
*edited 2019*
“Come on, Darc. Let’s go and get some lunch,” he stood up, holding out his hand for her.
“Go to the bridge and increase our speed towards Planeta Stark, I want to be there by early afternoon,” Steve walked past him, pointedly ignoring the sniggering that followed him.
“Steve. My sword broke.” He whined, mostly just because the danger had passed and he could. Looking over at the blond, Tony was slightly surprised by the man’s wide eyes and almost stricken expression.
“Did we step into an alternate universe when the elevator opened?” Clint asked, voice tinged with amusement as he stepped closer to the surprising sight before them.
Part of Tony’s brain was stuck on the word alien and the ridiculousness of it all. The other part of his brain was a kid who loved the idea of alien life and alien technology and was currently squealing and jumping up and down in excitement.
“How’d they manage to sneak up on us?” Steve demanded to himself, standing quickly and moving towards the door.
“We don’t know how much they saw of the drop. They might be speculatin' and we’d be fine. Or, they might’a seen what went down and are plannin’ on boardin’ and arresstin’ us all. How long till they’re on us?”
“Yes, but there is a chain of command to adhere to… Sir,” Steve tacked on the last word almost as an afterthought.
“Would you if you’d spent years lookin’ for someone, and then found them wastin’ time at a festival rather than lookin’ for you?” Darcy asked.
“Just promise me you’ll be more careful, then. Can you do that?”
He’d like to repay the favour, to the asshole or Obie, he wasn’t picky.
“Uh, Cap, you might wanna break up the reunion, they’re startin’ to attract a lotta local attention,” Tony suddenly said, eyes on the growing crowd of people staring at the spectacle.
“Take it back. I have a fantastic ass, you dick,” Clint all but sat on Tony, seemingly unfazed by Tony’s attempts to push him away.
“What’s the situation?” Steve asked, falling into Captain mode as he looked out the large window into the Dark.
“Morning, Pepper… Tony?” Steve’s voice lifted at the end as the rest of the team approached, confusion still evident on their faces.
“ETA five minutes,” Clint reported, squinting at one of the screens critically.
Tony went to her and pulled her flour covered self into his arms anyway, delighted.
“Funny lookin’,” she said, pulling out her thumb in order to reach down and touch the edge of the band aid.
Steve knew Thor wasn’t wrong. Stuttgart was famous for having a lot of items for sale, maybe even half of them were legal. If the dwarf planet had been located closer to the Core Planets, where the Universal Security Council liked to patrol and arrest anyone who even hinted at illegal activities, then its vendors and buys would be locked up on a jail moon before they had time to even think of escape. Of course, if the place had been swarming with USC soldiers, Steve would have avoided it as he had no desire to end up in a cell himself. The flimsy cover that The Avenger crew used as curriers and cargo transportation would only hold up under scrutiny for so long. Being accused of smuggling and other illegal actives would be more than enough to get each member of his crew assigned their own minimalistic 6x8’ft cell.
Apparently, the Super Soldier had experienced a change of heart. Briefly, Tony wondered if his words to the man the other day had caused Steve to rethink how he had been mindlessly following orders, before he mentally slapped himself.
“Tony, why don’t we start with you telling Doctor Traveller how you feel so we can all calm down a bit?” Steve’s voice was once again soft and encouraging.
“It’s goin’ to be okay, Tony,” he tried to comfort him.
Tony, seeming to realise the futility of arguing this time, rolled his eyes and started moving towards where the two ships were joint.
Steve sighed and mentally gave up, why Clint had deigned to give that blasted chicken such a stupid name was beyond him… actually, it was perfectly in keeping with Clint’s brand of normal so he really shouldn’t have been surprised.
This was the man Tony could remember playing super hero’s as with Darcy when they were kids? The expressions ‘never meet your hero’ had never been truer. Tony opted for lying to himself that he didn’t care what the man said, Jarvis would sniff out all of Fury’s little secrets and then he’d show the teacher’s pet.
Tony took a stumbling step backwards, eyes locked on the man, waiting for him to rise again, to blink his eyes open and say something about finishing the job he had begun so many years ago.
“Jarvis!”
“We’re waiting to hear what the kidnappers want, Tony. This isn’t something that can be rushed, as you should be aware.”
“I have a surprise for you,” Steve said, body practically vibrating with anticipation.
Steve rolled his eyes fondly, though the woman before them seemed to perk up.
– terminate them – full force authorised
She sighed and picked up her cup of coffee, moving over to him to lay a hand on his shoulder briefly.
– Nothing ever goes smooth with you!
“Sleep is an important time.”
“JARIVS, can you pause all the stuff Tony’s working on, please?”
“Pepper’s just fine, thank you.”
Steve had been reading quietly on the couch when he was brought out of the magical world within his novel by the feeling of a hand sliding up his thigh. Lowering his book, Steve looked down to where Tony was kneeling in front of the couch before him; one hand paused halfway up his thigh and the other resting on Steve’s knee.
The small, pleased smile on Steve’s lips when Tony stayed for the entirety of the debrief (snarking his way throughout, he would never be the poster child for well-behaved) almost made up for the hours of his life he’s never be able to get back.
“If we had a stronger engine, no problems. With what we’ve got, Captain, the fasted speed we’ve ever managed to coax outta her is under their maximum. We’d just as well stay put then add attempted escape to our list of transgressions.” Clint groaned.
“Darcy.”
“My name is Tony Stark, I was meant to take over Stark Galactic, but,” his words caught in his throat and he raised his free hand to cover his eyes, breathing in a shaky breath.
“Just thinkin',” Tony’s voice grew soft, eyes sliding back to the book on the floor.
Rhodey looked like the offered names were slugs Tony was asking him to eat. Then his eyes flickered down to Darcy for a moment, a small smile lighting his face at the sight of her hand still in Tony’s.
Steve stared incredulously at the back of Tony’s head for a moment.
As soon as he was sure she was out of earshot, he sighed.
“Jarvis, cut the communication with the team unless it’s actually important,” Tony said quietly, and Captain America’s angry words were cut off abruptly.
“Keep moving, Iron Man. You must be close to Doctor Traveller,” Steve said. The, ‘because you’ve found a bloody and disgusting version of pick pocketing,’ went unsaid.
It wasn’t until a few minutes later that Tony veered off from the main street and headed for a sparsely treed area, that it became more difficult to track him. The trio had taken to hiding amongst a wheat field that was close enough to see Tony, but not to hear him.
Steve suppressed the need to laugh, Tony’s own awkwardness boosting his bravery and relaxing his tense muscles.
An entire moon rocks’ population was to be killed. Steve had been down on that rock for the intial meeting, wherein he’d attempted to talk the people into falling in line with the government’s system. He’d tried to show them how beneficial and sustainable it would make their community. Steve had seen the young children there, peering through curtains as their mothers rushed them away. He’d seen the primitive weaponry that the people had at their disposal. He’s known that it would take only a bit of time before his unit would have been able to supress those that were the real resistance, and everyone else would have been just glad for the conflict to be over with.
“Come on, Steve, let’s go,” Tony pulled lightly on his hand, brown eyes scanning over the various stalls.
“Captain, what do we do?” Tony asked quietly into the silence.
“Yeah, I’ve no doubt.” Steve said affectionately, moving over to the small caldron full of water and dipping a piece of fabric in it that had been sitting there exactly for that purpose. Returning to Tony, he carefully wiped away the small bit of blood on his cheek and some of the dirt that had found its way to his skin on both his face and arms. Deeming Tony as clean and unharmed as he was going to be at that point in time, Steve carelessly discarded the fabric on the floor and raised his hand up to gently cup Tony’s cheek. The brunet leaned into it, eyes sliding closed easily.
If Steve noticed - and how could he not? Tony was practically a red stoplight his cheeks were so warm - he didn’t say anything. Although, the remarkably pleased air about him told Tony that he was somewhat aware of it. Tony, for his part, stared determinedly at the elevator wall as they rose in silence, Steve standing more in Tony’s personal space than out of it.
“Thank you, Steve. I really appreciate this.”
Steve didn’t appear dissuaded by Tony’s slightly alarming eagerness, instead the large grin that never failed to make Tony’s stomach flop burst over his face and his eyes glowed in the off-colour light.
“Oh, Cap. Let’s not lose all the mystery tonight,” Tony lent in close, his ale scented breath reaching Steve’s nose. “That’s what keeps this relationship alive.”
“I don’t know what you’re referring to. Pepper made me remove them, remember,” he said tartly.
Steve slowed to a stop, putting his back to where The Avenger was waiting behind him.
“Besides, we’ll need you tendin’ to the engine soon enough.”
He spared a glance down as he crossed the catwalk, seeing Thor leaning against a crate laughing uproariously, while Bruce adjusted his glasses, a relatively large smile on his face. Tony had crouched down near the chicken and was trying to call it to him amidst his own laughter, his outstretched hand was completely ignored by the chicken that was now pecking at the floor as though there was food to be found there.
Steve looked up as Jarvis responded.
, you’ve heard of the Ten Rings before?” He finally began.
Steve stared at him for a long moment, conflicted.
Steve tensed in response to her enquiry.
“It’s alright, Darc; it’s going to be okay,” he said, throat clicking as he swallowed, heart still beating hard against his ribs as his mind whirled with all the ways that could have gone so much worse.
“What can you tell me about this job?” he continued, eager to get the meeting over with and move out to where he could question Tony away from curious ears.
Sorry for the delays - computer troubles, ugh.
“See, I really don’t think I do. I told them I was working on something and, here I am, working on something,” he spread his arms wide and grinned, his new holoscreen technology surrounding him in a soft, blue light.
“Sir, the telephone,” Jarvis interrupted, voice now sounding exasperated.
“Used to it. You clearly didn’t know what you was tryin’ to buy either, and you helped me out earlier, so now we’re square,” Tony shrugged again.
“Of course,” she nodded her head slightly, the look on her face saying that he needn’t have bothered asking as she’d have done it anyway.
"I'm not offended," Bruce said mildly from where he sat across from Tony.
"He's goin' to be insufferable," Tony whined, pulling back slightly.
“Oh, my god, Tony!” she quickly turned back to Bruce. “I’m not a creepy stalker or anything, I promise.”
“I want the Avengers on scene within an hour,” Fury hung up.
onto the ship.”
“Iron Man and Thor, you both take the grasshoppers. Hawkeye, see if you can get at the praying mantis without getting too close. Black Widow, you and me are on the two ants. Hulk, that big honey bee over there is yours,” Steve said, and the Avengers obligingly broke off to tackle their own, individual assignment.
“I met these two guys, not like that,” she shot Tony a bland look, causing him to snort and put his hands up innocently as if he’d never been thinking what they all knew he had. “Jack McGee, he’s part of the campus paper.” Tony made an unhappy noise in the back of his throat.
He couldn’t tell his sweet, innocent, baby sister that the only times he could remember their mother touching him was a tossup between when they’d been at a press conference for Howard and she’d placed a hand on his shoulder briefly in a show of support for the camera. Or that time in the kitchen when she’d pulled him from the room when Howard and Uncle Obie had been arguing about work and recreational financial commitments.
“Open, please,” she held the muffin tray of cupcakes up carefully.
“I have a little sister, light of my fucking life,” Tony couldn’t stop the slightly hysterical chuckle from escaping his mouth as his thoughts once again circulated back to Darcy.
– motherfucker
“No,” Tony shook his head.
Steve was Captain of The Avenger, an ex-soldier for the Universal Security Council, and had been travelling around the ‘verse for the better part of his life. He’d face down all manner of dangers, with barely a flinch.
“Of course, I know who he is, he’s Captain America,” Tony gritted out between teeth.
“What?”
“Sure. Hey, want to see something really cool?” he leaned back slightly so that he could see her clearly, a grin spreading over his face.
“Right, pizza. Well, you’d better go and get the phone, the pizza place won’t ring us themselves,” Tony pushed her gently in the direction of the phone’s cradle, smiling at the enthusiasm that fell over her face at the prospect of using it.
“I do like it, but Pepper does most of the stuff the CEO should. I just sign the papers when she tells me to, go to the fancy parties she says I need to be seen at and spend the rest of my time doing R and D stuff,” Tony said.
“So, I was just saying to Jarvis, I might be coming to visit you this weekend,” he said, unable to hear himself finish as excited squealing filled his ear, enough to force him to pull the phone away until she’d calmed down slightly.
“Mister Stone plans to only be on-planet for another two days, then he will be departing to places unknown. We only have a short window in which to rescue Doctor Cho,” she finished.
Tony stared at them, not understanding, before a horrible realisation hit him. Just because he hadn’t been able to hear or see what was really going on, didn’t mean his teammates couldn’t hear what was being said over the comm that was still in his ear. That meant, his team had heard everything. They now knew how little he thought of himself, how little he was really worth.
“I feel…” he began, for some reason his tongue was hard to work, like his mouth was full of chocolate cake and he was trying to talk around it.
" Thor called jovially to them as they reached the ramp, his deckchair in place and the multicoloured parasol shading only his face from the suns rays.
Steve ignored him as he opened the lid and raised an eyebrow at the sight of the gun within.
The feel of her small hand slipping trustingly into his own made something in his chest tighten and then release.
“Hawkeye, I want you to stay outside, detain anyone who makes it out onto the grounds,” Steve ignored the complaints. “Black Widow, I want this floor covered as soon as possible, then start making your way upward. Thor, Iron Man, I want both of you starting from the top of the building and making your way downstairs.
