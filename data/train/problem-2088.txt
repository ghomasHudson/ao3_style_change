I was overheated with exertion and pleasure, and slowly removed the dildo and set it aside before sitting up in bed and stripping off my nightshirt. Then I eyed the larger dildo, which still lay at my side. It made me think of Watson again, and I longed to feel something I could pretend was a part of him. Taking it up, I greased it, laid myself down, and tried to insert it.
It was messy work, though; we were both in shambles now, to say nothing of the bedclothes. Red-faced and glowing with perspiration, Watson slumped beside me, just as he remarked, “We must get up. The day has only just begun.”
“Watson,” I said, “it is mine, and I shall wash it as fast as I like.”
And when things were not so exciting as all that, Watson proved invaluable to my health and sanity, listening to me when I needed to think aloud, leaving me to my own ponderings when I preferred solitude, urging me to eat, tending to my wounds, and giving me just the right amount of scolding about the cocaine. He could put people at ease when I arrived at their homes and began immediately sweeping through their rooms, inspecting their personal possessions, perhaps climbing on their furniture or crawling on their floors as the situation merited. He could comfort a lady in distress or shake an upright gentleman’s hand more naturally than I had ever cared to learn.
There was one that I was more drawn to than any other. It was one of the more recently-crafted specimens, solid, seamless, and smooth, made of Bristol glass, and very realistic. This one that I favoured was slightly bigger than my own was when at a full stand, and it had a subtle upward sweep which mine lacked. After some consideration, I determined that this one must be closest to Watson’s.
. It was nothing new for me to admire Watson’s fortuitous confluence of qualities: Strength means nothing if you have not the will to employ it when necessary, and bravery means nothing if you have not the skill to exhibit it effectively, and it is a rare man who has an equal command of both virtues. As I thought of Watson being that rare man (and not for the first time in my presence), my heart swelled. I was suddenly much more confident than I had been, reading those books as a bewildered adolescent, about what qualities comprised a “very masculine” man.
, and the enormous brass-trimmed cedar trunk I’d recovered earlier that day was doing an excellent job of taking up space in the middle of the room. Occasionally Watson would glare at it, as if doing so would reveal its secrets, but to no avail.
My plan had been to catch a burglar red-handed, with a replica of one of my client’s priceless
“God, yes,” I panted, and lifted my legs to give him a better view of where I wanted him to be. The cool air touched my slickened entrance. “Please give it to me now.”
By the time we returned to the cottage, we were quite ready for bed. We looked in on the second bedroom, which was little more than a closet. Both of us had endured far worse overnight accommodations in our lives; nevertheless, I declared that there was no reason to use this room, when the spacious master bed was plenty for both of us, and as we kept dissimilar hours, any time one of us was up and about, the other would have the whole thing to himself. Anyway, it wouldn’t be the first time we’d shared a bed away from home.
I kept to the far edges of the stairs as I climbed, avoiding the creakiness of the middle. But just as I was at the top, I heard the two men moving from the kitchen into the main room – and then toward the stairs! Holmes must have been bringing Watson up to the room he kept as a chemistry lab, to show him some experiment or other (the results of which Watson would surely not comprehend). I had intended to hide myself in that very room, but the door was shut, and I did not trust myself to open it silently. Instead, I dove through the open bedroom door.
I felt no lassitude after my orgasm; my blood was still singing with the pleasure I had received, and surely good manners dictated that I return the favour post-haste. I directed Watson to get up off his knees and return to his chair, and I assumed the same supplicating position before him as he had done before me.
He smirked; this broke the tension in exactly the way I had intended. He glanced down at his prick, still in his hand, then pivoted so that he faced me. Ah, excellent, he was game for it! He took a half-step so that his knees nearly touched the rim of the tub. My prick jerked in my hand as he loomed over me, holding his own ample instrument in his hand. He brought himself back to a state of full excitement, easing his foreskin back and forth over the glans. I watched how his fingers played with the sensitive spot just under the crown, and began to do the same to myself.
. My heart raced with the anticipation of unlocking all these secrets.
I stammered, “Yes…?” I did feel incredibly stupid, after his passionate assault on my person, for having ever been satisfied with such perfunctory relief as I was administering to myself at the moment. But Watson’s next remark was, “You work so slowly at yourself.”
The telephone exchange, never the most reliable, was inoperative when I returned to the Downs at the end of Hilary term. I did not wish to wait until the lines were restored to announce to Holmes that I was visiting, and in the past he’d never seemed to mind my dropping by unexpectedly, so I set off on my bicycle not an hour after I’d arrived home for the cottage which I considered my second home, and a second institution of higher learning as well.
I heard a rhythmic splashing, and looked down between my legs to see that Watson, too, was frigging himself. He moaned against me as he brought himself to his own crisis. The idea that doing that to me had so agitated him that he could not resist spending himself made my stomach flip, and one final pulse of seed trickled from my softening prick.
an exquisite length of cock. I must have convinced him, for he at last set the tin aside so he could come forward on his knees. His cockstand swayed to and fro, and he caught me watching it raptly. He held it at the root, and said, “You like this?”
I was frank with Watson about my bad habits upon our first meeting, and after we took up lodgings together my candor continued. I saw no reason to hide from him those foibles I possessed, and those particular vices which cohabitants might tend to be discreet about, I did not indulge in. Watson did not care for it when I opened my Morocco case, that was immediately apparent, but other than that, he tolerated my eccentricities, and on occasion spoke about them fondly in his chronicles.
But I didn’t want to stop entirely. I was full of coiled energy and now that he was not in me I felt empty inside once again. I didn’t know how to articulate my desires, but my helpless groans and whimpers seemed to give Watson an idea. “How about if you ride a Saint George upon me,” he suggested, “and then you can set the pace.”
At last, he implored: “Holmes, you must tell me what is in that box. I’ve been waiting all day. I assumed that your delay in telling me was owed to your flair for the dramatic, but the hour has long come and gone for a memorable reveal.”
Which brought me into the general vicinity of his prick.
I had not the energy just then to reassure him of the full extent of my satisfaction, to recount detail by detail the sincere cries, the fragrant odours, and the deliciously lurid images which I would hold in my memory forever, and would surely revisit whenever I needed relief from boredom (which would be often). I lacked the wit and verve, in my languor, to describe how fascinating, how riveting, how wonderfully novel each moment of our inaugural coupling felt to me. Instead, I simply replied, “You have proven yourself once again to be an invaluable companion. I wonder if you might read to me some more tonight?”
I followed the strand until the frolicking bathers and strollers thinned out and then were absent entirely. Here, the shore was overgrown with marram grass, and the sand was strewn with rocks and seaweed. I found an enormous chunk of driftwood, formerly a tree trunk, upon which to sit and fill my pipe, and whilst I smoked I contemplated the tide.
Thus, masturbation had been for me more often a necessary release of distracting nervous tension than an erotic indulgence. These occasional trespasses sometimes made me temporarily lethargic, but one emission would not prompt me to seek another; weeks or months would go by before I felt the next need to quell my bodily agitation. This minimised the lingering anxiety I felt, about those maladies which the hygiene books had warned me of.
Thus, the knowledge gleaned from the health and hygiene books permeated two years or so of my life, coinciding (perhaps unfortunately) with the first stirrings of adolescence in my mind and body. When that process began, I desperately attempted to allay my new confusions with these books, but more often than not, reading them made things worse. The anatomical diagrams and the factual, sterile descriptions of bodily functions were enlightening, but that information comprised only a sliver of these texts. The rest was concerned with more nebulous information about such things as the powerful reciprocation of influence between the reproductive organs and the brain (and other organs as well, but the brain was the one I was most concerned with – even in my youngest days I considered everything below my neck to be an appendix). I was fascinated by and terrified of the explanations of how excitements of the reproductive organs affected the brain. My organs, the books warned, caused libidinous thoughts, which if exercised would pollute my mind and drain my vital powers.
Though I lacked experience, I was no naïf: I had strolled through parks in the West End and crossed paths with those notorious dandies in their garish frock-coats, their lapels bearing coded messages. On several of these occasions I had been the object of a dandy’s peculiar gaze, one which travelled quickly down, then slowly up, with a final inquiring look into my eyes at the end. I had on those occasions never returned the signal they sought, but neither did I communicate offence or disdain, as there was no harm done...and I confess I had always felt a certain sympathy with them, as they were, like myself, compelled to continuously seek what satisfied them with no respite in sight, finding no permanent contentment as society dictated they ought, in the arms of a respectable wife.
“Not necessarily,” I said. “Why?”
“Now you must direct me in any way you see fit, and correct all my mistakes,” I insisted, before bending to my task.
The man had me dead to rights. Was I truly ready for what I longed for so desperately? I had thought I was, but now my ardour was being put to the test. “So I should just…” I inclined my head to indicate my prick. He nodded.
My body did not resist his advance, and he sheathed himself inside me with ease. I had perhaps been overgenerous with my estimation of his dimensions, but despite the fact that he was smaller than the article I’d been employing, the feeling was incomparable; his bodily presence, the warmth and scent of him, made even the intense pleasure of the dildo seem to pale. Nothing could match the wonderful feeling of having a flesh-and-blood prick, hot and throbbing, buried deep inside.
I had never been so near to one before, even my own, which was easily enough gripped, but by necessity remained farther from my eyes. How dazzlingly obscene Watson’s tumescence was, up close! Wet and rubicund and throbbing and hot, so much more than even my lascivious imaginings, so real and vulgar and thrumming, so proud and straight when erect. His bollocks were drawn up tightly to his body. I watched them quiver whenever I touched him in particularly sensitive spots. I played with his foreskin, pushing it back and forth over the crown, watching the fluid well up at the tip, then spill over.
As I made my way yet further into these books, new fears overcame me, specifically in regards to the female sex, and the expectations for my interactions with them. My parents were not at all affectionate with each other, and whilst certain sections of the books made clear that my parents must have engaged in sexual congress at least twice in order to become the authors of myself and my brother, they had given me no idea that men and women were meant to interact with each other with anything other than icy courtesy.
"It's okay, sweetheart. This is the most secure room on the ship. That's why we picked it." Lucy helped Eva strap into a safety chair and then helped Billy and Ishros with the other children. Strapping in themselves as the ship shuddered.
Here Julian lowered a device onto his chest. There was a tingling sensation deep inside him.
"For the last time, this is Commander Tomalak of the Romulan Star Empire to the unknown Starfleet vessel. You are in violation of the Neutral Zone. If you continue, this will be considered an act of war and we will take steps to neutralize your ship and retaliate."
Their healing abilities were amazing, but even they could not heal from some things.
He informed his cousins of the results, "Well before we had to make our first payment to the Ferengi Commerce Authority, we have had a hundred percent return on our investment."
"Now, now," said Culverton. "That's not how it works. You wanted to be captain and I made you a captain. I know you want someone to do the dastardly for you, but you need to wait."
As Bihr was shen, her spiritual element was water. Her gender represented blood and the connection between generations. Her parents had not bled when they'd died. Burned to ash, there would never be a funeral mask or cubes containing memories of them for the clan. Many in her clan had been reduced to dust. Those that had not starved.
He didn't turn it in to Donovan. He unpacked every item of his and Connor's few possessions in their rooms, which smelled like ozone and lilacs.
Sarabeth moved slightly away from John.
She went on a raid. Scooped up some scared Andorians. A lot more scared migrants from all over the sector. It seemed that people were flooding into the few worlds that weren't in the middle of a war, which ironically included this one.
Unexpected to himself, the next day he sent a message to Mummy wanting to talk, which earned a startling quick reply.
"I'm not a whore!" Sherlock whispered, even managing a single perfect tear that glimmered as it fell. "I'm a free citizen of…" he jerked his chin out of John's hand and mumbled, "Crete."
But he'd known that about five seconds after meeting him. His scent alone told John that.
If he went back to sleep, he'd wake up alone. Refreshed and ready for the day.
"My husband is getting help. But that may be hours yet. I can't carry both of you, I'm concerned about moving either of you further into the cave, the temperature differential is sucking the cold air into the cave, and the temperature is dropping. So, crawl into the bloody beast."
The Federation had to be expecting high casualties to recall a Doctor cashiered out on a medical disability. He was fine now, but they didn't know that.
The child looked up.
Martha said, "I'm not going to press charges. You thought you had a reason to mutiny. Considering events, it's questionable who was correct."
For John's last birthday, after John had dance-flirted with the jet set at Area 51 in 1970s New York in a fairly ridiculous baby doll white lace dress, Sherlock had taken him over his knee and spanked him once for every year of his life before fucking his bright red arse on a balcony. It had been fantastic. So, John was determined that Sherlock wasn't going to know what hit him. If Sherlock wanted cloud soft worship. Affirmation on adoration. Then John was more than happy to make that happen.
Sherlock reveled in John's scent. In the warmth of blood near the surface. Of being lower than John in this position.
He must.
"Yeah, I thought I should test if they will grow into adulthood."
The only reason the 23
"You don't know what you're talking about," said Kenner sharply.
John had a source of warmth and life right there. A way to stop thinking.
"Stop staring at me! Say something, you arse! You great big tit." She shook the table, pulling against the force field. The table was bolted to the ground.
There was a trilling whistle followed by a computerized voice. "Your brain scans show that you are awake Khan Brittanus."
He ignored her. Focused on pleasing his mate. Rubbing sweat slick skin against skin. Scenting and biting him. Working to ensure that John would be pleased with Sherlock. Know that Sherlock would do everything he could to care for the children that they were breeding. He tended to John's love bits when they were done. Cleaning them lovingly.
"Likewise," said Julian.
"We were ambushed by two Klingon birds of prey under the command of some Ferengi." She rubbed her neck. "Hudson refused to leave the bridge, which caused confusion in the bridge crew. They didn't know who to follow. Klingons took the Bakerstreet with barely a shot fired." She added grudgingly. "Hudson did think to put the ship into lockdown before they boarded us. Fortunately, with…" she looked at the Ferengi approaching with their capacious ear shot, "no captain and first officer, they've had no one to shake down to unlock the ship. They beamed us down to the planet so we could mine vendarite with the Starfleet scientists we came to rescue."
Sherlock shouldn't have found the chandeliers decorated with dilithium crystals familiar. The palace where he'd spent his formative years had been decorated in baroque decorations. Holograms. To be conformed to his parent's whims.
Still, there was hope. The Federation had an enormous amount of industrial capacity if they could the requisitions through the Council. They might just get through this. Particularly the way the Dominion was throwing ships away to gain victories as if they had an unlimited supply. Which they didn't with the wormhole shut down.
Bihr left her bondmates to settle in, with a rueful look from Ishros. She went to the engine room to find Stonn asleep on a cot, McCarthy and Smith looking wild eyed at the controls for the transducer coils. "What are you doing?"
Hudson sighed. "You are not saving anything by your current actions. Instead you are destabilizing a possible… opportunity."
"A well chosen destination," said the Guardian. Its center filled in with a long hallway.
John said, "Lift your hair away from your neck.
Sarabeth recognized her from before. Sawyersa wasn't a juvenile, but she was thin and wheezed with most breaths. Although the injury to her right eye had been sustained by a blow to the head.
John would not have wanted to be in Killander's shoes.
Still, John needed to stop right there, because thinking about Sherlock led back to thinking this might be worst mistake of his life. "Let's see what this ship's got."
"What about dad? Will he come visit while he gets better?"
Sherlock sat near John by the fire, while the Mollyhoo fairly efficiently dissected the creature. Medical training with cadavers. Even without her comments, the Y shape of her cut on the creature's belly could not have been more indicative.
"They broke up the company. Took a job doing Tellarite dinner theater on Rigos so they could be near the school. Looking back, I think my parents may have almost broken up over it. They argued all the time about it. Course, Harry, my twin, thought I was just trying to get attention. We were close before that, but after… we haven't really spoken much."
Mind you, you'll get the honeymoon phase of marriage first.
Sherlock was going to figure this out.
He had resisted treatment for Sherlock's condition, which meant that treatment must lead to a result that Moriarty did not want.
"Ha, you weren't careful enough with the merchandise," said Nom. "Why am I the only careful one?"
Mollyhoo giggled. "Can't move. Fucked in half by magic cock."
Unexpectedly, Stonn said, "He has as least some medical knowledge."
A mixed blessing. He wondered if shouting he knew Mycroft Holmes or Chin Singh would help or get him knocked out again. He'd heard that the Breen used slave labor on some of their mining installations. Although, by treaty that couldn't happen in Federation space. But they weren't in Federation space.
For his upcoming trip, he couldn't decide if she actually had gotten word her niece was visiting Beta Aurigae, and wanted to visit her, or if she was being kind yet again.
John repeated what he'd seen. Sherlock asked him questions before saying, "Given what you saw, the Federation must be aware that Augments are being kidnapped at a statistically high rate. There are less clandestine organizations that Section 31 that examine statistics from all over the Federation."
She kept calling even as she flung visions at Victor. Even as she threw a rock at him to get him off of Sherlock. Kept the sound of the feradon's approach out of Victor's mind as Sherlock pushed her behind him to face Victor.
Eva looked between them. "Daddy, you said Mommy was coming back today. Where's Mommy?"
They'd gone from not needing to talk to never talking.
"Oh, I…" Protector's scowl lost its rigor. "Yeah."
"Fuck, your voice is gorgeous. I could get off just listening to you talk, but," another wide eyed kiss, "let's not try that this time."
"Silvery," said Euros. "Like reflections on a mountain lake."
"So you say, but there is a break in both the brig and sickbay logs for the time you were in the past. How unfortunate for you that the logs documenting your nerve damage and your psychologically induced limp were copied to Starfleet central."
Mum had changed the route the troop took, which allowed her to visit Elba II time to time. When John had last seen Mum when their paths crossed on DS9, she'd said Harry seemed to be responding well to treatment at the Tantalus Asylum for the Criminally Insane. She even seemed to be buying into Harry's delusion that she might get out at some point now that Doctor Frankland was giving her neural neutralizer treatments.
Unaware of his thoughts, Mollyhoo laughed. "Sherlock, you really are strong, which is wonderful. We could use a little muscle. Not that it'll help when we're in season, but other times. That would be good. Oh, let's see. The cave system. We found has this gallery of stalactites and stalagmites full of salt crystals. So, we have salt. No other seasonings, but we have salt." She rubbed Toby's head. "And someone will get some yummy liver. Oh, yes you will. Sarabeth, she's my special someone, thinks we could use the bones to make tools. Awls. Needles, which," she glanced at their soaking wet clothes, "let me tell you take good care of that fabric, because it's the last you'll wear not made out of rodent skins or felt from Toby's fur." She waved at her own body, which was clothed in a tube of felt. She did a little dance. "We have a big beautiful hide to skin. I sort of know how to skin an animal."
With his other hand, he lightly hefted his bollocks. “What about these? Do you want me to put my prick in you so deep that you feel these bouncing against your arse?”
He snorted. “That is an easy one. You recognised the set of spare clothes I keep at the office in case of a mishap.”
But then he made his way downwards, and began to fellate me. This was unexpected, though not unwelcome. He attended to me in a most leisurely manner, very fitting for a lazy morning. I was so relaxed, I didn’t want to lift a finger or open my mouth to encourage him, I just hummed a bit occasionally to communicate my appreciation.
According to the boy, the dog was a mottled grey-and-black terrier, and it had been perfectly healthy and safe the night before, when it had laid itself down at the foot of the boy’s bed. He had awoken to find the dog absent, and had called to it all over the neighborhood, to no avail. I suggested to Watson that a brief exploration of the surrounding streets was in order, to familiarise ourselves with them.
“Hm, yes,” I said, rolling over and surveying the scene. “We’ll need to wash up. Send the laundry out. And have some breakfast – I would demolish anything put in front of me right now.”
At every opportunity I moved incrementally closer to him, under the guise of reaching for some morsel, adjusting the blanket, or avoiding a tree root erupting from the ground. When he noticed how close I was, he looked at me, and I can’t imagine he did not catch my knowing look which indicated that it was no accident. Not once did he attempt to regain the distance between us. Instead, he poured more wine into my glass after refreshing his own, and offered me the box of sweetmeats.
Three fingers made me feel full and stretched; there was some discomfort, but I dared not tell him for fear that he would stop. I was happy to work through it to get to the pleasure. I knew I could accommodate more if he was patient with me. He’d barely had them in a minute when I whinged, “Watson, please put me out of my misery and give me your prick.”
“I promise to do so,” I breathed, trying to appear calm despite how hard I was clutching the arm of the chair, “if my own eagerness permits me to stay your hand.”
I soon found Watson’s companionship indispensable. As a military man, he understood the importance of utter loyalty, both to one’s compatriots and to one’s objective: you never abandoned your fellow soldier to peril, you never lost sight of your mission, and retreat was unthinkable. The majority of my cases were (to my mind) simple, and lacking in life-threatening scenarios, but when a lowlife is ready to carry out another murder in order to hide the ones he has already committed and levels his pistol at you, you want a man like Watson at your side, because you know then that the villain will be dispatched.
Watson examined the envelope. “It’s addressed in a fine, deliberate hand, no haste or worry in it. Ah, and the name: Thomas Waugh. I remember him. He sought your services several years ago, about a scheme being perpetrated by his brother, if I recall. No, his brother-in-law. Well, so this is a man who has brought you interesting work in the past, and yet you have opened this envelope and found nothing hopeful in it. So the letter must be merely some show of gratitude.”
“Perhaps, but that is not what I mean at all. I desperately need to know, if at all possible, how it feels to be the object of such a craving as I have. Would you teach me what it feels like to be consumed in a mutual voluptuous desire?
Those times were particularly troublesome when Watson was similarly idle. Every wry smile he gave me, every twinkle in his eye, every gesture of his body seemed to inspire an onanistic indulgence – and increased my suspicion (my hope? my delusion?) that he was aware of my yearning and felt similarly. I searched for clues that this was so, taking note of his jealousy when I pursued cases without him, measuring his willingness to set other duties aside to accompany me on adventures. But even then, was I merely projecting my own possessiveness onto him? Was I only seeing my own depravity in his mischievous behaviour?
I wished to nuzzle him, to bury my face in his scent, but I had not shaved since that morning, and so to avoid abrasion, restricted myself to lightly nosing and tonguing at him whilst I explored. At last, the head of his prick, red as claret, slipped between my lips, and I lashed it with my tongue, back and forth, over the fraenulum and across the slit, tasting the brackish fluid that had collected there.
So a few days following, during the hours in which I was least likely to be sought out for tutoring or meals, I returned to the library, climbed up onto the chair, and took down the books again.
The head of his prick nuzzled at my entrance, lingering there though I knew it need not, as I could not have been more open and inviting; he was still just teasing me. I was beside myself with ardour, begging him to give me the whole column of it, to let me possess the thing I had so longed for. At last he consented to do so, sliding it snugly into me, and I dissolved in bliss.
It was a warm day, and the breeze was not so strong up here as it was closer to the shore, making it uncomfortable to wear our coats. We checked for anyone else who might be strolling or picnicking, but it would seem that we had the little hill to ourselves, so we cast our coats aside. It was very intimate indeed, to be outdoors with Watson in my shirtsleeves. I felt emboldened, and desperate to know once and for all if he might share the tender affections I harboured for him.
“Nonsense, you are a treasure,” he replied, and kissed me some more.
It did not all happen at once. To begin with, I had not every hour of the day to myself, and these books were vast, one of them running to seven hundred pages. I dared not look at them when anyone else was in the library, or might suddenly appear. Additionally, even in my unscheduled hours, I had other interests, and continued to learn all there was to know about chemistry, geology, music, and certain languages, sometimes from books, sometimes from outdoors exploration, sometimes from knowledgeable (and patient) adults. And if the family went on holiday, our library was of course left behind entirely.
Holmes called a temporary halt, his thighs trembling with the effort of holding himself up. He asked to be allowed to lie fully on his front, with Watson covering him. Watson complied, naturally. I found it strangely satisfying to see how his belly fit perfectly against the small of Holmes’ back as he seated himself fully in Holmes’ body. He worked diligently at his task, but it seemed that he found it more physically taxing than before, for it was not long before he retreated, and asked if Holmes might like to climb on top of him.
But when Watson wiggled his fingertips with more vigor, Holmes’ thighs quivered and he cried out; by this time, he had worked Watson into the most intense state of excitement, and so as his instrument slipped from between Holmes’ lips, it sprang up and stood straight out from his body.
His slow sucking was lush, and I was tingling all over and unable to keep still; my toes curled, and I squirmed in my seat. Watson was very tolerant of my restlessness, and placed his hands on my thighs to keep himself steady upon and around me.
I discovered this shelf (that is, I became tall enough to reach it with the aid of a chair) when I was ten years old. I took them down and sat with them in the leather wingback chair the same as I had every book before, but when I realised what these books were concerned with, I was so startled that I immediately climbed up and put them back, terrified that my parents would find out I had looked at them (I was aware by that age of telltale signs of interference, such as the presence or absence of dust upon an object).
I could not imagine that there was anything remarkable or worthy of insight in my personal technique, but I did my best to show him how I had been rubbing my prick lately, when it had demanded attention. I wasn’t at it long before he asked, “Is that all you do?”
I protested that I did not want to picnic on the strand, as I did not care for sand in my food (and my shoes, and my shirt), but I pointed out the enormous oak trees on a hill overlooking the coastline, and we hiked up. We found that these oaks shaded a little green meadow, from which vantage point we could still see the waves rolling in, and hear the cries of gulls. The leaves of the ancient oaks provided plenty of shade, and we found a spot that was not too lumpy with exposed roots upon which to spread our blanket.
At first I didn’t think I could ensconce myself there in time, except Holmes and Watson were taking their time climbing the stairs. Once I did see them, however, all thought of giving Holmes a start fled my mind completely, for the surprise I felt seeing him and Watson could not be surpassed.
I hummed again and turned my attention to the crackling fire.
“Holmes?” He sounded considerably more agitated than he typically did on a Sunday morning. “Are you just about finished in the bath?”
He glanced nervously at the way I was oriented in the tub, facing him directly – a bit bashful, that was understandable. He dared not look at me too long though, or turn fully in my direction, lest he appear to be leering at my nakedness. I did not take my eyes off him, and he must certainly have felt the weight of my gaze. However, his need was too urgent to ignore, and he lifted his nightshirt.
For here I must tell you something odd, and perhaps funny: I was never so obsessed with the act of self-abuse as I was when I was reading the books which so fiercely warned me against it. When I was away from the library, visiting distant relatives or on some other sort of holiday, I did not think much about the practice at all. Occasionally my organ would become stiff, and always for seemingly no reason, but I was usually occupied with some adventure or study which I preferred not to interrupt, and then my body would calm down on its own. I waited for “impure thoughts” and “prurient desires” to overcome me, as the books warned, but they rarely troubled me, even if I forgot to sleep on my side, or washed with a soft cloth instead of a coarse one. It was only when I was in the habit of reading those particular texts that my thoughts turned to that loathsome activity.
I protested briefly but vociferously when Watson slid his finger back out of me, but he assured me it was only so he could prepare himself to put in a second. He replenished the Vaseline and made good on his promise, going slowly but steadily.
“Good night,” I said, and shook my newspaper in such a way as to make it seem that I was going back to reading it, though in actuality I was watching Watson clap his book shut, rise from his chair, and make his way to the door. Sometimes at this time of night, I liked to imagine Watson sauntering towards my bedroom instead, turning back once to give me a profligate glance, inviting me to follow him. Or I pictured myself accompanying him up to his room. Of course, I would never dare take the slightest action toward making such a thing a reality. Watson was a soldier, and if that were not enough, middle-class; there was no doubt that he found such inclinations as mine to be dishonourable.
I fumbled about until I found the tin of cold cream, then held it out to him with a shaking hand, and he grabbed it and applied it generously to himself. Just watching him handle his prick for the time it took to smear the cold cream on it was enough to make me think my heart would burst. He took a better stance, spreading his legs and leaning over me to kiss me deeply.
A very strange thrill had run through me when I watched Watson’s graceful tackle, and the burglar’s futile struggle against his hold. I quashed this feeling immediately out of habit, though with a shiver that told me I would be tempted to dwell on it later. It had electrified me to witness Watson’s physical prowess – and one would think that would be nothing to be ashamed of, being a boxer and fencer myself, and therefore naturally an admirer of any feat of athleticism. That evening, however, after I had performed my nighttime routine and slipped into bed, I lay awake for quite some time, playing the scene over in my head in a way which had little to do with sporting technique.
“Sulking in a torpor has its own charms,” I insisted. Then I snuggled against him bodily and sighed, “But perhaps I will do it less.”
After our meal, Watson insisted on a stroll along the strand – there was a boardwalk to keep our shoes out of the sand, at least. As we walked, he told me of the times on the west coast of India where he had watched the sun sink into the sea at this time of day, and how enchanting it was. I myself had not seen such a thing, only two or three sunrises over eastern coasts such as this one, but I could not imagine that these sunsets of Watson’s were any more of a sight to see. I asked him for more details nonetheless, as these days I was enamoured of hearing him speak of fond memories.
That’s when I felt the most astonishingly intense pleasure. It was like a sudden spark had ignited at the center of me, sending arrows of fire down my thighs and deep into my prick. I repeated my thrust, and it happened again. I rotated and manipulated the dildo, searching for the best way to give myself that sensation over and over. All the while, I gritted my teeth and twisted this way and that, fighting the urge to cry out.
I laid my hand over his, as if to steady the box, which was of course completely unnecessary. With my other hand I took up one of the morsels, and looked at him as I popped it into my mouth. He smiled at me.
I stood utterly naked before him, and I chanced to glance at myself in the full-length mirror, and was momentarily humbled by my pallid, rangy form. I had never stopped thinking of myself, even at this age, as a scrawny youth always on the edge of bodily corruption. But Watson, oblivious to my thoughts, slid his strong hands approvingly down my arms and then up over my belly and chest. I made another effort to divest him of his clothing, and this time he allowed me to unfasten his cuffs, collar, and tie and cast them aside, but before I could get my hands on the buttons of his waistcoat, he murmured in my ear, “Why don’t you lie down on the bed.”
I lowered my newspaper. “My dear Watson, I fear I cannot reveal to you the contents, on the grounds that I do not know, myself. When the British Museum requested my services in recovering the stolen trunk, they would not tell me what was inside – they promised to pay me whether they found the contents still within or not, but they sternly warned me that the payment would not be rendered if I opened the trunk after recovering it. I’m counting on the fee to finance a season’s worth of operas at Covent Garden, so I dare not investigate further.”
I was lost in a bliss so intense I ached with it, but then Watson retreated from me, and perched himself on the edge of the bed, at my feet. I once again felt silly, naked and splayed whilst he was still mostly dressed, and I demanded, “Where are you going?”
Oh, that was what I had longed to hear! I clutched his sleeve and whispered, “If we make our way back to the cottage and shut ourselves up in it, will you make good on this promise?”
“Perhaps that can be arranged,” he said. I opened my eyes immediately, to see his hands seeking the top button of his trousers. I began to pant open-mouthed, “Yes, yes,” whilst I pumped my prick faster. I could tell that he already had an erection; I ached to view it.
Sherlock could not think.
He snorted to let them know what he thought of that question.
The armored Breen said, "Milady, I'm afraid it's time for your guest to go. It's time for your treatment."
They visited a shop selling rocks. Sestre looked at a round silicone sphere on display, which he pointed out to his father. "Fascinating," said Stonn. "This is a very unusual geological specimen. Given the lack of atmosphere and free flowing water, the probability that such a mineral formation would occur naturally is highly improbable."
"Eggs," said Connor. "You've been taking away their babies." He darted from under his mum's arm and grabbed the egg from the miner's hands. He rolled it to the largest Horta. "Here you go."
Sherlock hailed the Bakerstreet irritably, but there was no answer. There was no answer when John tried. Nor Sh'Alaack. Nor even Erickson or her graduate students.
In that space, John's scent rich in the air, Sherlock flushed, lowered his lashes to a narrow crescent of sight. Whispered the truth thundering with his heart beats. "Next time, could I be…" he bit his lower lip and let out the words, "be owned by you?"
Soo-Lin patted his arm.
Billy looked closer. "I don't know Connor. Maybe because they moved there so early, they didn't build it like that. Maybe it was before the Federation."
A smile flashed across Sherlock's face. "On DS9. Garak's. I haven't had a chance to show them to you yet." He slunk – because that was the only word for it – closer. "Do you like it?"
"Really," said Bob, who looked around with fresh appreciation. While he'd read every paper Adams had ever written, every statistical analysis showing the appreciable value of Adams' theories, and quite considered himself an Adamsite, he hadn't delved too much into the details of the man's life. He'd made that mistake early on and learned to his disappointment that heroes often had feet of clay. Humane treatment was what mattered in the healing of battered souls.
"I've got you. I'll take care of you. I'll take such good care of someone so precious. Come for me."
As it was, Mollyhoo was a little sorry that her own alpha daughter by Sherlock was scouting for Fenisal incursions. Zarabeth often became restless at the physical restrictions they had to place on alphas if there were any pregnant omegas in the settlement.
But when she found herself looking at a duplicate of Shroleb, Sh'Alaack's bondmate, short of shooting him, there was no way to stop him from saying, "I know where the prince's pet is. An old acquaintance came to get him yesterday. If I tell you where they are, will you let us go?" He was holding a thin little girl. Could be his. Might not be. Scanner indicated the kid was a shen, and should be apprehended to take to the palace. Course, as Legless had told her on day one, her only priority was rounding up omegas.
Out of nowhere, Sherlock said, "I've come to the conclusion that Sholto instigated a relationship with you in an attempt to gain access to your father. You had no classes with him. There was no reason for you to encounter each other. You yourself have described his behavior as uncomfortable during the sexual phase of your involvement. That he was overly interested in your parents. The relationship that ultimately got him transferred was when he became involved with a student working in the records office at the Academy. Someone with access to your medical records. Your DNA test. He asked her to download it for him. With that, he’d have been able to do a genetic search. But the student became uncomfortable with the situation and turned them both in."
"Not sure I believe anyone can smell what you say you can," said Protector. She hooked her thumbs through her black belt.
Jo Schmitter liked mining. Done it his whole life. Janus VI weren't like one of them atmo worlds. Lazy bastards could just shoot the shit all day and all night, and not do a lick of work if they so choose. Plants just shat out all the air they could ever want to breathe.
"No, it's not," said Melas. "Dionysus desired you and shifted your gender. Because," they smiled tightly, "in Greek and Roman society it was shameful to be the one who got fucked. Who wasn't the one on top." They laughed somewhat bitterly to themselves. "Yeah. That's about it. Yeah." They looked down at their hands. "Of course." They nodded. "What do I need to do, sir?"
Sherlock could smell what was wrong as soon as he crawled inside the nest, which now stank of the Alpha's piss and shit. Released in death when the arrow launcher slammed dozens of arrows into his face and neck. Blood. There was a lot of blood too.
But when she'd gotten word from Stonn on the Bakerstreet that every Augment in the fleet had been ordered to be remanded to a Starbase, all she could think about was the engines. Alive or not, to the engineering crew, a ship was a living thing. An extremely modified and customized living thing.
After all those scientists weren't the ones who'd have to gestate the High Order Magnitude pregnancies. Who had been taking a, "What if we do this?" approach to Human DNA. Not that he was averse to gene therapies. He was a doctor, but the level of hubris those scientists had displayed was mind boggling. Course, as he'd heard it, Khan Brittanus' first act on rising to power had been a series of reprisals against anyone even vaguely involved in his own creation.
But while the stores of dried meat and fruit, wild grains, and root vegetables increased in the refrigeration room, as the leaves turned brilliant yellow and red, and began to fall from the trees, the future didn't come.
What was important was an intruder was talking with his voice in his body. "It's good of you to gather here. To stand in the solidarity of grief with me, your captain, Sherlock Holmes. My husband was a fine man. Handsome if you're into that sort of thing."
Sarabeth raised her spear even higher. "Then they can't stay. It's only a matter of time before they turn on us. Before he turns on us." Sherlock was interested to note that many of them had woven small rings out of felt: brown, white, and a mix. A useless affectation to indicate gender and relationship status given the size of the community.
Sherlock became aware of multiple things as he came awake.
"It's true, it's just not that common," said John.
He needed to get to John. There were hundreds, thousands, of possible explanations. If he could see John, run a scan on him, talk to him, then he would know. Knowing would lead to clearing John's name and earning his freedom.
He did not let go of John's hand.
Washington gave the humanoid his food bars, while John focused on guiding Sherlock's body into the cave.
She tapped her fingers on the table top, thinking. There was nothing anyone could do to force grow herself and the others, but plants weren't like that. She could keep some control plants set aside and expose selected plants to a nutrient bath and a concentrated light regimen that would force their growth. If the plants developed into the adult versions, then at least they'd know that theoretically they would as well. If the controls also experienced development, or worse regressed, at least they'd know. It would be something.
"Will Mama Bihr be okay?" whispered Shor. At eleven, he was too big, too aware of his dignity, for Shroleb to gather into his lap.
Evil Owen was a persistent prick, and that grandfather of his wasn't much better. It made Sally's skin crawl when she realized that the fucker bothering her every ten minutes was one of Khan Brittanus' crew. Part of the reason he'd wanted to blown up half of London City Center to try and save him. Had her father blow it up in exchange for saving her life.
All around the other Breen from the other alignments stopped singing and got down on one knee.
Lestrade came over to John after the skits and asked for an introduction to his parents, which he was more than happy to give. Unlike Sholto, Lestrade didn't come out with accusations. He wanted to talk about the tap routine during the final skit, as it turned out he'd studied tap dancing as a boy. John left his mum and Lestrade rattling off a series of steps at each other. Mum's the louder for wearing actual tap shoes, while the Tamerians watched in delight, and Sirok looked slightly perturbed. Another arch of his eyebrows.
She was Eva's mother. She always would be. How she looked didn't change that.
"We figured out who you were," said not-Lestrade. John was thrown into the back of a glide unit.
She held out her hand, and glancing up at their mother, both children shook on it with her.
"As it happened, his Sugar Daddy had a way of giving his Sugar Baby a spanking while giving him his medicine. A way that would make his Sugar Baby cry out. He spanked his baby with the big thick knot at the base his long fat prick and his muscular thighs. The naughty Sugar Baby accepted his punishment happily. Greedily. He cried just like his Sugar Daddy had hoped. He yelled, 'Daddy, please I need my medicine. Please, Daddy. Stick me again with your prick.' And his Sugar Daddy pricked him over and over, until they were both ready."
She held out a small gold device. "Then keep in touch. And you should know that home is where when you have to go there, they have to take you in. The Bakerstreet will always have a place for you. Well, for as long as friends in various places can keep convincing Starfleet from deciding that our girl isn't past her fly by date. She was only rated for ten years, but," she twinkled a smile, "I at least know how to keep friendships alive."
A guard turned on the force field and left the room. They were alone.
"Uh…" said Washington. "I'm not sure I'm…"
The past wasn't all bad.
"What the buggery fuck is going on?" asked John in a tone reasonable for someone who'd been stunned twice and run through the ringer once in the last few days.
Hudson was saying something about how he was gone, how his psyche had been taken, which was not on while Sherlock's heart was beating.
He pushed back a strand of Sherlock's hair. "Still she did point me at the old Breen outpost. Interesting people the Breen. Spend their lives inside armor, but completely comfortable swapping bodies back in the day so they could steal each other's most precious possession. As if solid bodies are all that interesting." As he spoke, Moriarty kept dragging his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
"Not at all. I thought…when you didn't know me immediately that I had…" Chin trailed off into a useless silence.
When they were standing there wet and slick, kissing under the falling water, it was inevitable that Sherlock would linger. Exploring every inch of his husband with his lips. Blind fingers. Tracing freckles by memory. Unless his love demanded, "Fuck me!" There in the warm wet world they'd created, pounding inside his husband, his John, until the wall shook with the force of their bodies, until his husband shouted Sherlock's name.
John laughed. He was still laughing when the metal projectile from an old fashioned weapon went through the back of his right shoulder, ricocheted, and made its way out the other side. John did his best to fall backwards. The entry wound was smaller. Less chance of bleeding out in that direction. He couldn't feel his right hand.
Woke up a few hours later to blearily look at the rest of who he'd saved. Most of them were just kids. Seventeen. Eighteen. Twenty years old tops.
Bihr twitched her antennae in acknowledgment and pushed the bin into the lift. Even the service exit from the palace was grand. A human guard acknowledged her as she went out the wide door, but Eshess had been right about the force field. A mild yellow glow curved over the entire facility keeping out the environment beyond.
Sisko coughed. "Perhaps we should sit."
Sestre's own older brother and sister were busy with families of their own. His niece, T'Pringa, who was three years his elder, was employed as an engineer at New Gol. Her daughter attended the same school as Sirok, if one grade below him. T'Pringa had told him that with the increased demand, she would be able to find him an internship easily. Building ships that he would never travel in.

John did not laugh at the question. It wasn't funny and Lucy had made different choices than he had. "For now, let's focus on getting us out of here. Yeah."
He searched for it the moment they arrived at position 6775. Not entirely easy, given he was looking for sub-atomic particles in a vast room of dust and other conflicting energy signatures from the various items in storage.
John crept down the hallways of the Klingon ship. There were Klingons on this ship, but the medical tricorder worked a trick for ducking out of their way. On the third deck, he finally found Human life signs. Unfortunately, they were in the brig with two Klingon guards.
The creature shuddered, but the stone on its back didn't move.
Julian was arguing with Doctor Culverton from the archeological expedition on Camus II–
John walked quickly down the hallway. He groused to himself, "My body is like a baby rattlesnake. It doesn't know not to drop an entire load of poison on a single bite." Also, "Utter, utter, utter cocks! Good idea if we went back in time and punched them all in the fucking nads!"
Sherlock kissed his forehead. He climbed back onto the bunk. They lay there listening to each other breathe until there was a tentative knock on the door and a plaintive request through the com from Owen. "Commander, could you unlock the door? If you know, you're done in there. It's just the toilet is on your side of the door."
"No," said John, flushing a brilliant red. "You should go directly to the bridge. I'll be fine. I am a doctor. I know how to dispense a pill." His heart was beating rapidly. But as with everything since John had reappeared as a teenager, that could mean anything. His tells wildly varying based on every new emotional spike.
"It's locked," said Protector regaining the sour tone to her voice. "We have actually tried to figure out what's going on."
Mollyhoo put her arm around him. "I'm sure it'll be better this year." But her look at John wasn't hopeful.
"You'll what?" said Mama G, putting her hand on Connor's shoulder.
"That is a good wage," said Tevek. His voice took a very crafty tone. "But did you get any of it upfront?"
John almost did whimper when the fingers were removed and the bunk shifted as Sherlock slid off of it. He almost opened his eyes. Waited instead as Sherlock told the replicator, "10 cc of Risean lubricant. High viscosity." After a moment, he added, "Beach towel."
"Yeah," said John. He squeezed Sherlock's hand, before letting go. "Love you."
"It was an egg," whispered Connor.
It would have broken his heart if it hadn't been true.
John didn't ask how hot. The answer was obviously very hot. John was very hot. He rubbed his arse against their bed and arched his back. Pressed another kiss to Sherlock's hand. Then feeling very naughty and hot, slipped Sherlock's index finger between his lips.
Fucking distant howl from the air vents were getting the fuck on her last fucking nerve too.
But bad engineering was not the reason the intrusion detection system had not barked in the night for the original hack. But that did get Sherlock to thinking.
John raised his glass. "My parents raised me in the theater, and I know who created plays." Dionysus filled in more and more as John continued speaking. Filling in completely as John dashed a little wine on the ground. "To Dionysus, who created the first plays and in whose honor each play is held." Around them, he saw some of the others dashing wine to the ground.
It was a pleasant surprise to run into Commodore Lestrade when he and Sherlock went to see "Much Ado About Nothing" in Stratford.
It was grit in his machine.
He cleared his throat and said, "Today, we will be studying uh….simple transmutations. If I…if…Mr. Watson can keep his attention on the… scenario." He wrote some gibberish on the board. Actual gibberish. John knew his Jabir given that they had done this scenario a few times and ways over the years.
John applied a stasis devise to Sherlock's over developed head and since it wasn't built do anything, but stop bleeding, re-programmed it to supply the impulses to tell Sherlock's heart to keep beating. To tell his lungs to keep pumping air. At some point, while doing all of this, he flung the anal plug against the wall, because some things were just not on while trying to save the love of his life from dying.
Sherlock hated to say what he said next. "I can contact my brother about your situation. There is… that is there may be… somewhere you can go."
He lost his grip.
"Hmmm…" hummed Amazing Sparkles, running their hand along the side panel. "Does anyone have a tricorder?"
He liked the name.
Baby fucking rattlesnake.
Sherlock groaned. "That is not helping."
Not a single one of all the Breen doctors in the last year had betrayed the slightest understanding of what it was like to go into heat, much less the overwhelming constant metabolic change of juvenile heat in a mind and body too young to deal with it.
Which left that damn box burning a hole in his desk.
They made slow soft love with gentle kisses for each truth of themselves.
Chin said, "I know this face must be a shock to you, but what you are observing is the truth."
More than that, John knew how to make bread. He knew how to cook. The idea to put dried berries with the farradon meat had turned something gamey into something delicious. She'd forgotten delicious. He even understood the basics of making beer, which once she got used to the idea of chewing the grain and spitting it in the pot as a way of using the enzymes in their saliva to break down the complex carbohydrates, it tasted better than she would have expected. And after all, they did boil it.
"Yes, yes, if Mummy can solve the Breen's self-inflicted problem, they'll have a great deal of influence."
"Someone who is mistaken." John moved between Sh'Alaack and his father. "You don't know who you're talking about." He tried to think of the words that would convince her. "My father's a good man." Memories of a thousand kindnesses shown to strangers. Soft words and patient guidance on how to be a decent Human being. There was simply no way for John to align a person guilty of what this Kodos had done with his father.
She said absently, "It would be difficult for Mummy to reward..." the name strange in her mouth, "Sherlock. Time travel, I presume."
"I think that's what's called a trap," said Cho.
John asked his father about the plays they were going to put on. If his back was any better after that fall he'd taken a few months ago. What medications he was taking. Normal conversations.
Julian's treatments were debilitating. This body was debilitating. Its eyes leaked water while he tried to stare at the screen for clues as to John's and the others' location. He was forced to close them repeatedly in an effort to gain control of himself.
"Sebastian, you don't have the courage to kill me," said Sherlock. "Just as you didn't have the intelligence to graduate from the academy. I remember you now. Begging for my help with basic courses. Pathetic."
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Savage_Curtain_(episode)
"No," said Mr. Mott flatly. "We all knew about him."
John forced his tongue to move. "Harry."
"Not exactly, and there's not really time right now," said John. He looked at Billy, but it really wasn't the time to talk with him either.
Mollyhoo held back slightly. "Sarabeth, be careful." Mollyhoo held the tip of her braid to her lips. "I wouldn't let her rub against you like that. I don't have a vasopressing 1b receptor gene, but you do."
"I had no hand in the symmetry of my features," was Sherlock's scowling reply.
John licked his lips. "I know you don't need to ask. You know I do."
They were kissing softly as klaxons went off for a red alert.
Back on the Horta planet, Killander was trying to find someone within two or three generations to the occupants of the cryo chambers to provide a negative ID. He needed someone that closely related because anyone less closely related wouldn't be good enough proof that the people in the chamber were random bodies that had been disintegrated.
John looked over at Sherlock, who was staring wide eyed at the room. Sherlock said, "This is the building where they hold the Meiosis of Alignments on the Breen home world. The temple we visited before is not far." He went further into the room and John followed, glancing once behind them, but there was no portal. Only mirrored walls and tapestries. This time at least, all they had to do was call for a ride home.
"Four of them," said Supersmart.
He needed to focus on that. He tapped his com. "Bridge. Have the wreckage of 221C tractor beamed into the shuttle bay. Transfer the full set of all sensor readings from the energy anomaly to the shuttle bay's stations.
Bihr listened to Lucy.
It took some hours to study the night shift schedule. Simulate a home emergency for one of the two officers assigned to monitor the cell an hour into their shift. Leaving them shorthanded.
They woke one morning to find bright red spotting on the sheets. A panicked grab at the tricorder.
He was years out of practice, but he gave her a wink, and looking at Killander, said, "Oh, I intend to be."
Two seats up, Bailey was smiling at Eva's story. Alpha scent now that they'd completed their transition. They were a good person. Steady. A bit dull. Nothing like Harry. Nothing like John.
Sherlock turned the HVAC on, which startled the animals that Morg had been hunting, which led to the man standing up and cursing, which led to him being captured by the away team.
John knelt next to Connor as if to check on his condition. He whispered, "Think you could throw a tantrum for me?"
When he woke, John's scent had shifted. Not returning to its new normal. But something more liveable. Something that allowed Sherlock to think.
"A man of Commander Holmes' skill could easily have modified the records. And there is also his planet of origin. Corindium IV. How convenient that all their computer records were destroyed in an e-pulse."
Bihr heard the words, but in her heart she knew that they would be gathering, simply without her. Their bond had not caused Lucy Hebron and Captain Holmes to discover the properties of the Ceti Sexus Pollinis.
He also got to absorb, what Sherlock said next. "As you know I can't remember my early childhood. I don't recall ever being touched as a preteen. Teen." John couldn't resist a stroke of Sherlock's hip at that statement. "Every morning, I would wake at four. Swim in the river the flowed beneath the… place where I lived. It was set to ten degrees Celsius. Run for ten miles. Study during my waking hours. My parents or my brother would periodically check in on my progress. There were… call them servants who watched me. Monitored me."
Hudson tittered, "A new level was opened up just as the incidents began."
Chin straightened in a posture that reminded him achingly of First Father. "Perhaps you thought I was dead, but I survived the Feradon attack and the fall into the crevice. For years, I thought you were dead. Our parents lied to me. I only learned when I went on the run of the ancestors, and your name was not among the fallen. But by then you'd already left the home our parents created for you and I had no idea where you'd gone until much later."
"I can't begin to get the whole Augment thing, but I'm making career decisions because I'm in love with a hologram, who fuck – I'm the reason he has the programming to love me back and I'll never know if that's…" Hunter stopped herself. Chewed on her lower lip for a bit. "Children are not the only reason people get together. At least you didn't program him to be into you."
A mystery to be examined at length when not in Starfleet custody.
When Sherlock said, impatiently, "You should have moved closer to food sources."
"And my semen," supplied Sherlock. "What have you concluded?" Those changeable eyes of his were wide and blue in the starlight from John's window.
One of my best theater experiences was going this production based on Ovid's Metamorphoses + Lucius Apuleius Metamorphoses/Golden Ass
"I did notice he gave a lot away with his questions," said Billy.
RVN is not a real thing (RNA and DNA are real things), but according to Trek it is. Keeping in mind, we hadn't mapped the genome in the 1990s, but less the 60s when the idea of Augments was created.
Killander sat up. "I demand that you release myself and my crew. We are Starfleet officers. Attacking our vessel is an act of aggression against Starfleet."
Sherlock jumped into the climb. He could hear Finney laughing all the way up to the second level and even after he burst through the hand operated latch into the cool blue corridor and came face to face with the mural of a massive hound.
John sat next to him and put his arm around the kid. Gave him a quick squeeze. "That's right. Can you imagine a universe where Sherlock doesn't look for us? Doesn't find us? Because I can't."
Then to make matters worse, the coms chirped. "You have a message, Captain," said Winters. "I'll relay it into your ready room.
Still, Sestre recorded their route. He was not certain he trusted Connor's ability to find their way back by scent.
Lucy knelt down. "It's very dangerous."
Greedy, he agreed. He'd take what he could.
He walked into a narrow room, where the Cardassian was clearing debris from the floor. Garak said, "I'm sorry not open for business just yet." He looked up, his gaze sliding from Sherlock's feet to his head. "But," he stood up, "for a customer such as yourself, I could make an exception. I had hoped you'd come in before now, but better beautifully clothed now than never. Especially given the nature of the the orders regarding Augments." Given that Garak was not in Starfleet, the fact that he'd heard anything about these orders was interesting.
It was brilliant. John's scent and heartbeat and expression all indicated his focus was on what they were doing.
"No time," said Sherlock. "Culverton implied after… time… permanent."
Sherlock woke, and was released by his brother's guards with a laugh and a rude gesture.
"And you?" said Bihr. "Why are you headed to Andor?"
"Sherlock. Of course, I'm coming back. And you're not allowed to go anywhere stupid without me, yeah. No dying. That's right out."
She barked a laugh. "I see why John likes you. You're as fucked up as he is. As we all are." She slid her chair closer. "So, is John happy to be proved to the good one? Cordelia, while I'm Goneril. But," she swayed, "that's not right. I loved my daddy. I would never… why did he jump in the way? Spots on my hands, not his."
"Billy," said Ms. Hudson, "if you don't mind helping me up, I'd like to close the room off to external access."
Sherlock fake grumbled and picked him up, which was just lovely. He lay John down on the bed and pulled the covers up around John. Actually tucked them in on the side, leaving John feeling tightly held by Sherlock across his entire body.
When the ancient gunpowder weapon was fired, she took off at a steady pace. Most chose to go the safe long route through the Sunrise valley. The adults had been lighting fire all week to drive off the feradons that lived in the Serrated Mountains.
As they came out into the corridor, Sh'Alaack had a panel off the wall directly next to his door. "Anything wrong?" John did not want to be trapped in a room with his family if the door was malfunctioning.
Lestrade said, "Revive the Pegasus Chimera ships."
Was given a number of other rather obvious clues about John's great poverty, and mounting debts to pay for his sick mother’s healthcare, which bizarrely wasn't something paid for by society at large.
The creature moved slowly in Sestre's direction. Very slowly. As if it was worried about the rock.
Sherlock raced up through the caves to the place where the tunnel split between the gallery leading to the omega's nest and the cold chamber, beyond which lay Sherlock and John's nest.
His new helmsman, Ensign Winter, smiled weakly, "Nice to know, sir." He'd preferred Smith, but she'd transferred to the USS Reliant as Second Officer. Some things changed.
The Bakerstreet had gone through a Verithon wave anomaly, came across the Exeter, a ship lost a century before, which had been abandoned when the crew caught a bioengineered plague.
Not only was Lucy there, with Hunter, Smith, and Hudson, but Sisko, Dax, Bashir, and Lestrade were there.
John forced himself to check what he knew to be true.
After all, as John had told him more than once, "It's not like we need to try to have children." Generally, while pregnant. After Sherlock failed at yet another method to prevent just that. Augments went into heat for three months every year in the winter. Unless on suppressants. Which always failed no matter what Sherlock tried. Since staying apart wasn't really an option.
She climbed up and examined the seedlings. Like herself, there was nothing wrong with the plants themselves. They were just immature versions of the adult plants that she'd brought back with her.
Mr. Mott, who'd heard the story before, pushed in with a story about the secret prince raised in the moons of Ferenginar, who the new Khan had freed from some sort of obligation, which sparked a brief nine-day war among the Breen, before Prince William had been setup in a nice palace on Andor to make weapons and fight wars for his brother. "Lots of them," said Deanna dully.
John crouched behind a rock and did his best to stop the bleeding from the projectile wound on Chief McCarthy's chest. "Stay with me."
"And snatches her prey," was the thaan's reply.
Dad picked up her hands and kissed them, one by one. "My love, Banquo's ghost comes late to the feast."
His genius had purposely lit the dimly lit bordello to give him an across the eyes spotlight like a film noire dame and was showing more poise than any teen had ever had.
The most important question would be to find out if their family lived. What was left of their family. Those few Augments created to be superior to the Beta version of Humanity, who had made it to the sleeper ship before Brittanus had set off the nuclear device to obscure the heading of their journey.
John bobbed his head under the water to lick and stroke. Coming up for air as needed. Sherlock lasted somewhat longer before he came again in the water.
She was stuck in the ready room, because the prospect of facing Donovan had suddenly felt overwhelming. Intimidating, which was ridiculous. Martha looked and felt better than she had in years.
Bihr did not flinch. She did not ask if she was to say this before or after she killed everyone in the palace including the shen. Including Eshess.
John sat down on a pillar that had toppled and was now halfway sunken into the soil. Sherlock curled up and laid his head in John's lap. John stroked his hair. Rubbed his back. Whispered, "It's fine. It's all fine. We know they survived. Had children of their own. We'll figure something else out. We always do."
"Stop that," said Julian. "We need to keep the body that you are in healthy and to do that we need to treat your celebrium poisoning."
John sat awkwardly for a bit longer with Billy, until Billy said very softly, "It's okay. I need to be alone for a bit before Connor gets out of school."
Mummy said, "You think that I planned this!"
Victor stood back. "No. I don't want to play with you."
As she found out after a series of intensely interesting conversations with Sherlock, could easily have had a cloaked ship above the planet. Had the technology to do that too.
Bihr did not feel up to being a spy. In an alternative reality. She wished that John was the one who'd been greeted by every Maquis as some sort of savior.
That something hadn't changed.
"Okay," said Connor bracing himself.
He'd invited Elim a time or two on a few of Mummy's less important ventures. Not that Mummy approved, but Mummy approved of so little. At least now that Chin had taken up with Billy, some of the pressure was off of Mycroft. As to why Sherlock was free to be pressureless once he escaped the family home so to speak, Mummy had shared the reason long ago when Mycroft had been just fourteen.
"Mommy loves you so much. Let's go back to our quarters. We can have pancakes for dinner to celebrate."
They shook their heads at her. Clearly a failure in their education.
They sat, and the conversation shifted to other things.
Ms. Melusine said, "This is Connor son of Dora, daughter of Grendel, and a child of Meleagant, who sacrificed himself that our ships might take off. As told you last week, Connor, like I, is a refugee out of time." Her hand was warm on his shoulder. She squeezed it slightly. "He knows first hand the cruelties of the Betas." Connor wanted to protest that not all Normal Humans were cruel, but he remembered what Mummy had said about thinking before he said things so he didn't. "His grandfather Grendel is very lucky to have recovered him. A great grandchild." Her expression was full of such longing, that Connor ached for her. "Now class, like we practiced."
"Door locking," said the shuttle's computer.
"We'll need to run some tests," said Doctor Imprid.

Mycroft didn't answer, but his silence was sufficient.
In that moment, Sebastian would have given his right kidney for the equipment to be real. To really do what Culverton said it could.
"Deeper. I want ever mouthful of air to be for me. I want to fill you."
A safe place to go to shore.
John almost blacked out from everything he was feeling. Everything about everything overwhelming him. He came again. He couldn't count how many times it had been. Too much. Too many. Not enough.
"Harry, I don't want to rehash our teen years again. I'm sorry. I went a little crazy with back then. I never said it then, but I know you didn't want to be stuck on one world. I know that it made things hard for you." He reached out to take her hands again. This time she let him with an odd smile. "You're my twin."
Redbeard said flatly, "He betrayed our band and that can't go unpunished. Come on."
"I believe that you are not telling me the truth, but I will not hold this against you," said Sestre.
Sherlock crushed another piece of tritanium. Purely to provide an additional sample. "I will solve this." He wanted to shout that he couldn't think, because all he could think about was burying himself inside John. Being claimed by him.
Dropped the force field and tossed it to Khatri. Grinned at each other. She pulled out some yarn and the needles, and knitted a few rows. "See." She came closer to the nearer Klingon. Billy could see her muscles bunching to make a lunge.
Not-Lestrade led him back out of the cave system and into the equally underground complex of an Andorian city.
The Bakerstreet was surveying the Draconis nebula, and really other than looking for anomalies and updating star maps, there wasn't much going on, which was lovely really. Just lovely.
Perhaps if Martha hadn't thought to expose Billy's quarters, the day care center, and several other randomized areas of the ship to low levels of baryon particles there might be something to find in those locations.
"Billy," said Chin, standing up at the same time. "About what we talked about?"
Which given the way Sherlock was glaring at some of the egg shell fragments that he'd been given from the Horta earned Sherlock another snog. This time in front of the bridge crew, who were actually somewhat used to that sort thing.
Thil whispered even softer. "Uzaveh blessed Aidalas the Constant when he was born. And Veraaeh, and Keelor."
Sherlock resisted the urge to cover himself. After all, John had seen Sherlock in every state of undress. He could feel blood rushing to his cheeks and upper chest in embarrassment. "You didn't indicate that it was necessary," he said somewhat snappishly.
Sherlock could not fail to observe that after John spent the early evening hours searching, John had Sherlock's body lie down on his bed with him and hold John in a simulacrum of sleep.
John licked his lips. Caught in a sense memory.
There was no painting over his cubicle. John reached out and captured Sherlock's chin, met Sherlock's eyes, midnight blue in the dimly lit brothel. "And what is this celestial beauty's specialty?"
"Ha." She tapped the golden edge of the seal on the diploma. "I did. Found a few cousins on Earth. I'd wondered sometimes if you'd done the same, but you didn't care enough to bother. Like everything else. Taking care of our parents was my problem. Ensuring the family traditions carry on, my problem." She turned to look at him and for a moment, she was Joan of Arc at trial. K'latha at her final battle. "Our father is an incredible man, who has done his best by everyone around him. Who loves both of us. If you don't understand what that's worth, then maybe you should stop pretending that you're a member of this family." On that line, a true Watson, she made her exit.
If there were damaged ovarian cells, the dreadnaughts did nothing, but the fast cruisers did the work of healing the cells, while a dreadnaught took care of fertilization.
Sisko steepled his hands. "Lieutenant, can you provide us with the access logs?"
No sooner did his alpha release him, did he demand more. Always more. On his knees, forehead resting in the earth as his alpha thrust wetly inside him. On his back gazing up at twin moons and starlit sky. A slow moving light marking the Bakerstreet. Vague thought swept away as his alpha woke from his nap at Sherlock's nuzzling. By his strong and steady alpha release inside of him. Teeth safely clamping the skin of Sherlock's neck. Legs wrapped around his alpha to ensure he would never leave. The knot the promise it was true.
Hunter said, "Yes, I was there, sir."
She stepped inside and Gomtuu wriggled away through space on a thought. Wriggled all the Breen who'd come with her out.
Even the distant sound of machinery, which did sound a bit like a hound dog's belling cry, filled him with comfort.

But Sherlock, as always, grinned at her response. He liked to have people talk back to him. Lucy knew that. Sometimes, she forgot.
He was dimly aware that some of the others had left the chamber. Had gone down into the caves below. He could hear them yowling. Mixed with shouts from Jovas and Kenner. Other voices too. Strangers.
"Yes, an afterheat pill. That's reasonable." That made sense. John's current body was far too young to bear a child. Especially not since the norm for Augments was two or three children. That was the only reason that Sherlock ruthlessly tamped down the suggestion drifting through every room in his Mind Palace that they were married, and John's career need not be affected and they even had childcare on the Bakerstreet. Others had their children onboard. Now that he could think, he could think about how a child of theirs might look at John's current age. But only a barbarian would force the love of their life to bear a child in such a primitive way and when all was said and done, Sherlock's genetics were nothing that should be passed on. Except John's genetics were something to be studied. They could ensure that they didn't pass on the particular gene they'd just been discussing if they were to create children in a more reasonable way. In a lab. As science intended. If they were to want to do so.
He went back to the places where people were gathered. Offered to check the bleeding sores of a Bolian and typical of his race, Mr. Mott had a lot to say. It was good to know there were some constants in reality.
As it was, John waited until the count of ten and injected himself. The other answer to the trolley problem was for the conductor to jump in front of the trolley.
The logical thing to do after picking an incorrect portal was to pick the next portal over, but curiosity overcame Sherlock. After all as long as they were quick, there was so much they could learn.
Mama G said, "Connor!"
"Of course," shouted Sherlock. He tapped his com. "Hunter, in the historical records. What building at White Sands was the center of the American research into developing Augumented humans?"
"I don't know what that word means, John," said Mollyhoo. "There's so many things we should have asked you before, but…"
Billy said faintly, blood pounding in his ears. "Self-defense class from Donovan." He wrapped his arms around Connor. Kissed the top of his head. "We'll keep each other safe. Yeah."
"Of course not," said Martha. "You knew you didn't need to."
Chin didn't ask why the fact that William had lived had been kept a secret from her. It could have any number of reasons.
Wilkes launched himself at Sherlock, who felt a burst of adrenaline as he tried to move closer. For a moment, just a moment, he was in his old body again. He stepped back breathing air as it was meant to breathed. Scents and impression blooming all around him.
He didn't mention Finney. If Adams couldn't deduce what Finney would do, that was his own problem.
"Exploitation," said Sherlock.
"Females of our species develop more rapidly. That is why you should look to them for leadership and example," said his father placidly. As if there were any Vulcan girls on board ship. The only other child Sestre's age was Connor, who had been through war and famine, and all sorts of things.
John's mother stood motionless on the stage. She dropped like a sand bag whose rope had been cut next to John's father. John held her. Cousins gathered around them.
She could have broken those walls, but was too distracted. She flinched when she heard the name Chin. He said, "She's very angry about what happened, and quite transparent about her plans to kill you, which I'm afraid Khan Meiying encourages. It's the reason your father, Khan Noonian, latched onto the idea of waking you, but you must…" He droned on.
"Retake ship, yes," said Sherlock glaring at the device on his chest. "Find John. Get me scans from the wreckage."
He'd wake holding John. Holding his husband. Inhaling his intoxicating scent. The marks that Sherlock had bitten into his skin inches from his lips. He could never resist scenting his husband.
"Care for dessert?" he asked sweetly.
"Happy Five Year Anniversary, love. Here's to a million more," he grinned, softly, popping a chocolate in each of their mouths.
He smiled at his John, always happy to see the man eat
John grabbed his jacket and shoes, pulled on a hat. "I'm heading out to the shops for a bit. Be right back."
"Hand over the extra takeaway I had you get," he said, then retrieved the heavily laden cartons and presented them to Jim with reverence.
"Oh well...if you want to," Sherlock said, trying not to sound too disappointed, "Maybe I could order a pizza or something for when you come back? Watch one of those spy films?"
"Look for bre-" the detective lets out a monstrous burp, "breadcrumbs on the floor."
"Go on. You can do it. I know you can," he murmured. Sherlock gave an odd hiccup that sounded more like a burp, his belly sloshing slightly, then he nodded, and accepted it, throwing his head back to gulp down the last of it.
Just in time as well, several officers with bloated middles and straining buttons were wandering in looking panic stricken. They fell on the boxes with glee, stuffing piping hot chips, fish, and fried chicken into their mouths with gusto.
"Yeah, your arse is yards larger. Bet you ate more too. I hardly got to eat any of it," Greg said with a wink, disregarding the heavy gut that seemed to contradict the statement.
"F'anks," John said through bulging cheeks. He slapped his gut again and swallowed. "S'good. Really good."
"Eat Me"
Sherlock opens his mouth a little wider, a look of sheer horror in his eyes as he is unable to stop himself.
He did his best to walk normally, then dove into the men's room and found a stall, shoving his hand down his pants without further ado. Left over adrenaline. That's what it was.
Sherlock hummed, hefting his belly in his hands as John scribbled down the new number. He let it drop as John fetched the tape measure. They would need to find a new one soon.
"Hmmph... Hands are cold," he mumbled.
"W-what will you do to John i-if I don’t?"
Sherlock had meant to ask his questions. Instead, the remarkably aroused detective breathed
"Moriarty? Why would he send you-"
Warning for horrible abuse of tea in this chapter.
Therefore, it took until the pair of them had been called to a crime scene for anyone to comment on Sherlock's changing figure. And many were happy to. All the officers stared. Donovan looked like Christmas had come early and Anderson had a superior smirk plastered on his face. They wasted no time in commenting on Sherlock's altered physique, not bothering to keep their voices down. John was about to ask them what the hell they were on about, he had that steely captain's glint in his eye and that dangerous smile that usually meant someone was about to be torn a new one. Sherlock didn't pay them any mind. The dead body was far more interesting.
John smiled and followed after. He collapsed with a low groan and wriggled out of his clothing. He hoped Sherlock's drunkenness would also mean that the man would be liable to sleep in.
John smiled to himself.
"Maybe you ought to switch to water as well," said Sherlock pointedly, "before you make an idiot of yourself. Or well a bigger idiot anyway."
"Thank you," he murmured, leaning down to kiss John's cheek above his beard. "That's...no one's ever been so nice to me, John. I...I don't know how I got so lucky." The curly haired man said, eyes soft as his looked upon the doctor's face.
*****
He seemed nervous about touching the detective. Oh kisses and compliments occurred just as frequently as ever, but hugs seemed shorter, and whenever they made love Sherlock was too overwhelmed with just how amazing it was to be
"Yes. The man behind the blog," Mr. Holmes said, nodding and giving his son a wink. "Glad Sherlock has someone to look after him with everything he gets up to"
Moran checked the monitor.
"Do...do Winter Fae have two cocks?" He flushed, wondering what it might feel like to rub his pale cheek against John's round, chubby one
"I-It was a mystery?" John repeated, clearly distracted. Sherlock opened an eye and smirked even more. Very distracted.
"Boooo! Cry baby! Just fuck already! Jesus! Just don’t think about being on top Fattylock, you’ll probably crush him!" There’s a cruel cackle.
"God, I'm such a-"
"Feeling okay?" he asks. The man’s bloating seems to have gone down, but Sherlock still looks... well it looks like some of it's sticking around.
Stuffed to maximum capacity, belching loudly enough to shake the flat, stained with sweets, surrounded by emptied plates, tins, and crumbs, John Watson is finally in his element.
That question drew out a sharp breath. Sherlock smirked.
He quickly stomped to Lestrade’s office, putting the box down for a moment to open the door - long enough for two, younger officers to grab a handful to share with their friends
It wasn’t a fear he had faced in a long while, living in the same flat for years upon years, and knowing the streets of London like the back of his hand had left Sherlock essentially immune to this fear. But now, in a strange house made of candy, nearly engaging in the forced vore of a living gummy bear, the detective was shaken, and that childish fear had taken root in his head once more. The music turns louder, and he begins humming along with it more loudly, his mind turning fuzzy.
But quite suddenly eyes that may or may not be there are driven completely from his mind. John’s jaw actually drops. If that's - that can't be Jim Moriarty in his trim suits. No. Never.
Sherlock whimpers pathetically and bites at his knuckle.  He was not hungry...
Sherlock simply pouted further, and continued,"It's a
Sherlock noted the small tummy he was sporting, moving his hands to squeeze the bit of soft flesh. It looked...good. Like he was taken care of, which the curly haired man most certainly was. He rubbed at his eyes, wandering out of the bedroom and yawning loudly. Perhaps he could heat up some of the leftover ham from last night, if there was any left, John seemed to have really enjoyed-
He stood and fetched a blanket, then plopped down on the sofa and slouched back, throwing half of it towards Sherlock. He grunted, stomach sloshing, as he reached for the remote, then started flipping through channels.
It was going to be fun.
"Oi! Me! Not him!" John bellows, turning and pointing his gun at the creatures. He fires a bit haphazardly, hitting only one in the leg. He manages to get one in the head as it darts towards them, then the gun clicks, empty, and the soldier brandishes the butt of it instead, giving into the rage that's pounding through him.
"Mmm... here's to forever," agreed John, smiling and leaning in for a deep and chocolatey kiss.
"John is lovely. What about Hogson? Or Potson?" He offered, sliding a hand to John's gut, jiggling the round, fatty thing, his thumb daring to slip into the blondes navel
The detective moaned his encouragement as John prepared him, the doctor feeling his arousal build and build as he slid a hand between those two fat jiggling globes to get him ready. Then they were fucking, John grunting as he pounded into Sherlock’s big fat arse again and again, his mouth marking and sucking on every pinch and roll of flesh he could reach. He felt Sherlock’s belly jiggling heavily against his hand as he reached around to bring him off.  They were spent in moments, shuddering and gasping as they came down again. John managed to guide Sherlock to the sofa on wobbly legs. They both crashed onto it with low groans, the frame giving a small groan of its own to protest the added weight.  John held Sherlock close and was just about to drift off for a quick post coital nap when Sherlock spoke.
Sherlock grinned widely, spying the box, he hurried over and read the note
John grapples with Moran, he's larger than John, more sadistic, and goes right for where it hurts, twisting John’s bad arm and giving him a good punch to the gut. John does his best to throw him off, but he's heavy. John manages to elbow Moran in the throat and he chokes before his arm closes around John’s own and traps him in a head lock. John freezes as he squeezes and the doctor’s vision flickers. Moran shouts for the patients to fall silent again.
"Soon, my precious piggy," the other man said, now coming into frame, a similarly sized gut on his mostly-nude, fat frame. He moved soft hands down to squeeze and jiggle the bound man's round, soft belly.
He quickly forced himself to focus on the program. "This-this alright?" he asked, his voice oddly gruff.
He moaned again as John's mouth bit into his arse once more
He chuckled and slathered another slice up with loads of butter and strawberry jam, then passed it to Sherlock. He drank a bit of his tea and then polished off his own slice. His stomach gurgled happily, even as it was restrained and forced to be flat by his clothing. "Mm, that's very good actually."
"Oi, Greg? Sherlock? What's going on h-"
"Sherlock," John says simply, weapon still trained on Moran.
"Sherlock! Where in God's name are you?!"
Well impossible or not, it's coming towards him. And it’s not looking remotely friendly as those pincers open, a mouth gaping behind it. John raises his gun and fires coolly, the bullet soaring true through the creature's maw into its brain. It makes an odd shrieking noise and falls, many legs twitching.
Sherlock gasped.
The detective felt color rise to his cheeks. Of course, it couldn't be true. Just the angle at which John was sitting, the amount of tea sloshing about in that... that
"Hrrmph, hardly," Sherlock replied, patting his belly. It let out a dull thud of a smack. "My capacity's been increasing. Along with my appetite. And... various other-"
As soon as the doctor was out the door, Sherlock began work. He ransacked their cupboards, pulling out recipes in Mary's handwriting. He sent rapid texts to acquire the ingredients he would need as he flipped through the papers. He set to cooking.
He approached Father Christmas slowly, with reverence, a massive smile beaming on his face
He reached for the new slice of toast automatically, hardly giving thought to how much he was eating. Everything was feeling tight though, full, and warm, stuffed to contentment. He bit into the toast and licked up a bit of marmalade that got on his thumb.  "Mmm... almost something like that." He grinned as he slathered Sherlock's next slice thickly with honey rather than jam and passed it over. "Here. An old favorite."
"Perhaps I'll order my portion separate. We might be hungry at the same time and...and maybe we'll get a bit more work done if we do it on our own," he offered, mind doing backflips.
Sherlock slapped at the man's hand
Then every last drop was inside him, and Sherlock collapsed back with a moan that was quickly replaced by a litany of burps. He couldn't seem to stop, his cheeks flushing pink, one hand on his bloated middle.
The ex-army captain springs immediately to attention, looking over at the massive detective who is now crooking a finger in a distinct ‘come hither’ motion.
John is still thrumming with energy, even as Sherlock pulls him away from his fight. He grumbles and growls slightly at that, then realizes who it is. Sherlock. Yeah. Sherlock's safe.
"Sh-hah-fuck!" he came harder than he had in his life, his vision swimming for a moment as he slumped against the stall. He panted and set about cleaning himself up, shuddering and shaking still.
"I'd say it's worth keeping around... yeah," he murmured, smirking at John. "This is... better than I could ever have imagined."
Sherlock chuckled and bumped his middle into John's. "Don't tell me you enjoyed this too," he said, his tone joking. But John knew him well enough to pick up on the tiny notes of hope in the detective's voice.
"I don't know-hurp- why I let-urp- you do-hmmph-this to me," he murmured as his stomach sloshed and gurgled between his doctor's gentle hands.
"Yeah," said John, his voice gruff and low. He reached out slowly and prodded the man's middle, his lips parting as the flesh jiggled slightly at his poke.
"Shut up!" John shouts back with enough force to make himself hoarse. Sherlock. Sherlock is important. He's alive. Oh God, why do half of them seem to sound like him?! John forces himself to his feet and takes off running between the beds, the way Sherlock had been going. Pale ghostly arms reach out for him, crying as John passes.
And toast.
At least his jumpers did a rather good job of disguising just how much he was eating. Still, at the end of the day, there was a definite roundness as he looked down. It was oddly fascinating, especially in the shower where John was used to looking down and finding washboard abs. Now he just found a rather soft round butterball of belly with a deep navel dimpling the furthermost arc.
Then Sherlock was ready and John was feeling rather full.
"Thanks. Needed this," John added, smiling groggily and patting his belly again. He cupped it in both hands and wobbled off to his room. "Niiiiight, Sher-humph-lock!"
He gave his flatmate a grin, willing himself not to think about what all that food might do to the skeletal man's middle. Probably make it bulge out, round and plump and- No!
Sherlock shivered as John said 'gluttony', the very sound of it on the doctor lips was something he would finish to for days after, but for now, Sherlock was obsessed with downing a pizza with his lov-with John
perfect."
"Fuck, I've- urp- never... never eaten like that," Sherlock groaned, now rubbing his belly, his eyes fluttering closed.
He waved from the kitchen window as John went by, almost instantly unbuttoning his shirt and shedding his trousers, moving to the fridge and taking out the chocolate cake he'd hidden behind a wall of sauces an jams
He wet his lips again and leaned a bit closer. "What do you say you and I take leave of the rest of these boring well-to-dos and... have a more interesting discussion?"
John swallowed, but managed a quick, "Thanks," before the man dashed off. He still looked lean as ever, but John imagined those burps louder, a pale belly growing rounder and fatter with each one and still wanting more.
One of Sherlock's eyes slid open. "Mm... nor I you," he rumbled, reaching over to prod at John's belly with two fingers.
He burped loudly and then reached for the carton again, flopping onto his side and rolling onto his well cushioned back, belly stuck up in the air as he dumped the lot into his mouth. His trousers too were growing tight around chubby thighs, his love handles blossoming out and untucking what remained of his shirt. Oh Christ this was heaven!
Sherlock Holmes should not be here.
Sherlock’s laughter stops when he sees a small table with two tapes on it. He puts one into his recorder and presses play, then chooses the second.
He cut himself another piece and flooded it with whipped cream again as casually as he could muster. He sipped his tea and then dove back in, his stomach feeling heavier already with the rich dessert. He swiped up a bit of whipped cream with one of the other cookies and ate it thoughtfully.
"Let's see if we can't find any more breadcrumbs. And Sherlock, for the love of God, don't eat anything else." With that, John leads Sherlock off a different corridor, eyes trained on the ground. The scuttle follows. The army doctor thinks about stopping to take it out, but perhaps he can use it if Sherlock recedes back under the house's spell.
His chins folded, round cheeks swam into view, and those piercing blue eyes that seemed to almost glow remained fixed upon the detective as the rest of his features solidified. He was blonde. Tanned. and endlessly soft. But no part of him was angelic. His thin lips curled into a smirk.
Sherlock chuckled and moved himself to the side of the bed, getting up with a grunt, his really rather enormous arse at the perfect height for John to enjoy. "That it is. Come on then, doctor. Let's see what affect three months with you has had on me."
John sat down with his tea in his chair, ruffling a newspaper. It was a quiet Sunday. No cases. No surgery shifts. Just tea.
"Yeah, you two," she replied, then went to buy a drink at the other end of the bar. Just in time too. The next date was slated to meet in just five minutes. Sherlock swallowed a growl when the clock ticked steadily past the allotted time. Honestly, was punctuality dead? He got up to use the loo. Damn all that water.
"Yeah, yeah," said John, waving a hand impatiently, "M'hurp- drunk. Still. I like it too." He patted his belly and winked. Then he hefted himself up again, with a loud moan that made Sherlock shiver.
"M-more... food?" John repeated, his pupils blowing wide as he took in the great expanse of white bloated skin and fat before him. He chuckled and stepped closer, giving in to his urge to poke, and prod, and squeeze.
"Perfect," he snarled, his hands cupping Sherlock's belly, dipping into his waistband.
The least amount of conversation one had with them - the better. If one wanted to hang onto one’s soul.
Sherlock hadn’t simply gotten chubby or even fat off of all the food everyone in London was suddenly shoving in his face. No, the detective had positively ballooned. Slim arms and legs had puffed up until they made his seams scream. A narrow waist had expanded into thickly rolled sides, complete with love handles that sat atop new voluptuous hips that seemed to be constantly spilling out over his trouser band in a truly ample muffin top. His poor tailor hardly knew how to fashion trousers that could contain, much less minimize the giant quivering arse that bowed out behind Sherlock wherever he went, jiggling with his steps. Sherlock’s concave little tum had swelled and swelled until it became a proper gut that hung over his waistband, rippling gently with any quick motions. And it was always hungry for more. A bony chest had suddenly bloomed into two soft malleable breasts. His chin had doubled. His cheeks plumped. The most astonishing change, however, was arguably Sherlock’s disposition. He was growing almost jolly as he continued to gain and soften from all the treats. Though, he was still rather blunt or rude from time to time.
"I've put on a bit weight I think, all that baking you've been doing," he chuckled, scratching at the back of his head, "I...like it. The weight. I hope that's alright." He offered, hands moved to snake around John's back, then laughing.
Greg's lips were powdered with sugar. He hummed as the jam trickled onto his tongue.
He swallowed and took the wine, placed it on the mantle, then trailed his hand back up over those straining buttons.
He smiled at his flat mate and best friend... and perhaps something more that he couldn't say just yet.
Sherlock's parents turned out to be quite incredibly... ordinary. Mrs. Holmes was cheery and kind and tended to ramble on and on about any matter of things as she set dishes out on the large wooden table in the dining room. Mr. Holmes too was genial, nodding or interjecting into his wife's speech here and there. He seemed a good and quiet man. John found himself warming to him immediately. Sherlock's smile was undoubtedly his, where his eyes were passed down from Mummy Holmes. He saw that as she scanned the table again, looking for anywhere with enough space for yet another pot of potatoes.
John chuckled. "Pizza? Well, might as well not bother then," he joked, secretly thrilled. "And sure, I'd love to."
"Sounds good," said John grinning, "Maybe the cookies you put out weren't his favorite so he was full by the time he came to your house."
"Just thinking Mary would be proud of us," he murmured after a little while, rubbing his belly, "Finally ate a real meal."
"You know my sweet tooth," Sherlock murmured, sipping again at his tea.
'What? The two of them are together?" he asked, chuckling, "Oh, that's rather sweet though..."
John chuckled, "No, I'm afraid I don't know anyone by that name. Least not since the 1800s." He smiled and Deliah laughed. Sherlock turned subtly to get a better view.
"P-Play it again. We need as many details as we can get," he said, voice barely quavering.
"Sherlock
He settled back against the counter, rubbing both sides of John's massive area happily, purring
"H-hungry?" Sherlock asked as he realized neither of them had said a word in quite some time. He coughed to cover up an undignified noise as John rucked up his jumper, rubbing his bloated belly idly as he looked around for more food.
It was a cheerful morning – I awoke with the melody of Handel’s
After all the intensity of our coupling, it was when he was washing me intimately that I became overwhelmed with emotion; he must have noticed the tightening of my throat, and the humidity of my gaze, for he asked what was the matter. I refused to open my mouth, for fear of letting loose a mortifying sob, but he understood anyway, and climbed back in bed beside me and held me tightly, rocking me back and forth a little and stroking my hair.
? But I could see Holmes’ expression while Watson did it, and thus I learned that it was not only possible but pleasurable. Never had I seen such bliss on Holmes’ face.
All I knew at the time was that I wished to avoid such a fate, and I made careful notes of which habits were healthful and which were not: to prevent temptations from creeping up, and also to prevent involuntary night losses, I should make a habit of bathing in cold water, washing with a stiff brush and drying with a coarse towel, going to the gymnasium, climbing, swinging, running, horseback riding...I got the idea that essentially I must exhaust myself daily, to leave no energy in my body to devote to solitary vice.
I saved face by replying, “Yes, and also one of your patients vomited on you.”
(one such preface assured me),
meaning “delight,” it is not certain, and probably does not matter. In any case, this trunk was loaded with them, a collection spanning ten centuries and all manner of materials – polished stone, lacquered wood, buffalo horn. Some were stylized, with flourishes that gave them the appearance of a whole humanoid form, or a creature of some kind, or a scepter; others bore a startling resemblance to an actual organ. None were the latest models, which were made of India rubber, nor were any constructed of more perishable materials, such as leather. I knew that the British Museum, though they would never display such items as this, had crates upon crates of them locked away from prying eyes and delicate sensibilities; this was only the tiniest sampling.
He encouraged me to stroke my own prick at my preferred pace, so that he could concentrate all his efforts on servicing me with his own formidable staff. I squeezed and pulled at my prick, but the feeling was as nothing, just a morsel of supplementary pleasure, compared to what Watson was putting in me. When I could feel the inevitability of my orgasm, I gave him half a minute or so of warnings, pleas, and promises, and then at last my whole body ignited in a conflagration of ecstasy, and I begged him to take his own pleasure inside me at once.
I spent abruptly onto my nightshirt after lingering on this thought for some minutes. It happened so suddenly, I was too startled to feel ashamed. I changed into a clean nightshirt and laid back down to ponder what had just happened. It seemed that I might be in danger of developing a habit that, for the first time, it would be best to hide from Watson.
Holmes’ response was a gasp: “
To my dismay, Watson continued to insist that I needed more practise getting accustomed to accommodating his fingers before he would give me his prick. The following day when I asked, he declared that I must be sore from what he done the previous morning. “Tell me when you can sit down without feeling it,” he said. But when I told him so, he just gave me his fingers again.
I never told Watson that I had seen this, because I suspected that he might not have realised he was doing it, and I did not want to make him self-conscious of such a useful (if incongruous) habit. But any man who, in a hospital in London, exercised a level of caution appropriate for enemy territory in wartime was, as I said, clearly both brave and sensible. Here was a man of good character fallen on hard times, yet his apparent qualities made me feel that we would be at the very least suitable cohabitants. (My suspicions later proved true that once he regained his niche, his constancy, his nerve, and his capable surgeon’s hands would make him an ideal brother-in-arms.)
John obligingly wriggled, unmooring the bedclothes on his far side, which was fine, he was burning up. He pushed the covers down, exposing his sweat soaked body to the cooler air.
The Bakerstreet wasn't ripped to shreds. Really nothing more than some really gorgeous lights playing off the shields.
Sestre turned a red eyed and teary face up at them. "No, Father. Don't shoot. The Horta, it's a Horta. She's in pain. So much pain. She didn't intend to hurt anyone. Her mother told her to stay away from the humans, but when she found at that there were unhatched eggs being kept by the colonists, she wanted to help. She… she… she's in so much pain! Please, Father! We have to help!"
Taking his time, he freed the last button, then shifted aside his drawers, and his cockstand tumbled into view. It was thick and flushed and beautiful, and I kept my eyes open to admire it even as I was provoked to a crisis. I spent onto my belly whilst uttering the most embarrassing groans. I saw Watson’s prick twitch and jerk while I was spending; he liked what he was seeing as well.
No talent or skill was needed to observe this. Nonetheless my pulse was quickening with being under his scrutiny. “I like to draw it out,” I explained. “I like to think about you and I don’t like to stop.”
He ended his astronomy lecture with a sigh. “We won’t see the stars like this for a long while, I suppose, after tonight.” I said nothing, and after a moment he continued. “Not that I am not looking forward to returning to London. But you were right, last night: it will be strange going back to our old lives now that there is something new between us. I feel like I am in a dream, and I’m about to wake up.”
I imagined the sea air so invigorating Watson that the amorous element would be quickened within him, and with no other suitable outlet, he would be forced to turn to me to find relief.
, I was unashamed when my tears fell upon his shoulder. Love was not a sentiment to be trifled with, I understood that now more than ever, but I knew that we could not have generated such a powerful communion of ecstasy if I had not given myself up to him entirely, and now we could not hope to sustain it if I became guarded again, retreating into my dispassionate carapace.
The sinister spectre of self-abuse had haunted my adolescence only occasionally, and in my adulthood with even less frequency. I had gone about mostly untroubled by the physical charms of those around me, and it was a rare day when vigorous exercise and a self-imposed spartan lifestyle (or the overwhelming weight of one of my black moods) proved insufficient at keeping at bay those few urges that did manifest.
,” he read aloud, “
I was sore where he had serviced me, and still a-flutter in my belly when he looked into my eyes. “What a marvel you are,” he remarked. “So delightfully greedy for a nice prick. One would never guess.”
“I’ve been craving your prick for weeks,” he confessed breathily, returning his attention entirely to Watson, handling him in that place he was referring to.
I thought of how, with this facsimile of Watson, I could experience something I’d desired but had never thought possible: I could learn what it felt like to have one inside me. I had long wondered how it felt, and saw now that I had an opportunity to satisfy my curiosity.
I couldn’t understand why he had insisted on being able to see my face; as he sank his prick inside me, my eyes rolled back and I gasped open-mouthed like a landed fish, and I cannot imagine that looked the least bit alluring. But I couldn’t help it, I was out of control with excitement, feeling him finally push his prick up into me. It felt even better than his fingers had, so much smoother and fuller, and I knew it was better for him, as well, because his breath was coming in little sobs as I engulfed him.
This was a fair reason for hesitation, and my heart leapt to know that the possibility of being spied on was his only objection. But I felt shame nonetheless, for was I not the tireless guardian of my emotions? Was I not the untouchable statue, with no weaknesses to exploit? Yet here I was now, scolded by Watson for my juvenile lack of discipline. “Of course you are right,” I sighed.
But then he did something that seemed incongruous, considering his reaction to my proposal. He gave me some polite direction:
“No,” I said. I myself knew that the work was entirely finished, and so was already collapsing upon the settee, lighting a cigarette. “It is not worth saving.”
In the end, as Miss Hayes had every reason to believe that her aunt was quite deceased but unmistakably strolling through the streets, I presumed she was the victim of a ruse, or at the very least a misunderstanding, rather than any supernatural phenomena. I asked her for every detail of her daily routine, then instructed her to carry out this routine to the letter the following day, during which time Watson and I would, rather than follow her directly and possibly draw attention to ourselves, instead plant ourselves at key places along her route, watching for this mysterious figure to appear in her wake.
“Only just to here. I’d like to watch you touch yourself for me.”
