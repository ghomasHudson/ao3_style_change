“Me too,” Gabe adds, “I’m bored of research.”
“Clearly.”
“Okay,” the Shadow snaps their fingers and Lucifer disappears. Gabe stares at the being possessing his face as the darkness around him slowly envelops his body. The last thing he will ever see.
Mary sighs. “Yes. My poor Carl, they still haven’t caught the monster that killed him. Why don’t you two come in.”
“But how do I make sure I don’t make any more mistakes?”
“Possibly. Some may have been a little racy.”
“Is there anyone who can confirm that?” Eileen asks.
“So Moriah too huh?”
Three hours later and still no one except Chuck has spoken and it’s clearly getting to him.
“I had to. It was the only way to keep everyone safe.”
Jack smiles. “Thank you.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Not until the last second. We don’t trust you to not turn on us,” Jack responds.
“No.” Jack sighs and steps back. “I don’t think it’s working.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Is there a way that your husband could have found out?”
“I’m glad we have you on our side.” Cass and Gabe turn away from Hannah.
“Fine, you caught me.” Jack spins around to meet Chuck’s voice. “I wanted a bit of leverage.” Chuck is standing over Dean II's limp body that’s lying on the ground. “Don’t worry, he’s alive. He just wouldn’t shut up so I had to put him to sleep.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You idiots gonna hurry up or should we just eat all this food on our own?” Sam yells from a couple of hundred feet away. He and Eileen have the blanket and food all set up and are already digging in.
“Good,” Jack answered. “She said that we can use the cage to hold Chuck. I already made the necessary alterations and now I just need to take him down there but I wanted to wait for you to get back. Did you have any problems when you went to see him?”
Dean rolls his eyes, “bitch.”
“Of course my boys. Happy to be of service.” She gives Dean a hug and whispers in his ear, “Now go get your Angel back, tell him that secret you’ve been hiding. Even though everyone knew it.” They pull away and Rowena winks at him. Dean smiles and turns away.
“Oh,” the Shadow makes a fake pity face. “No no no, Gabriel. I agreed to send Lucifer back, not you. But, since I find you entertaining, I’ll make you a deal, either I send Lucifer back, or you. Not both, sorry.”
Cass looks at Dean in shock and unable to form sentences. “O… Ok.”
“That’s all relative. All I care about is me and me only.”
Jack makes a decison regarding his position as God.
“That’s what Chuck said when he came to get Lucifer. ‘Once the Winchesters are out of the picture, you will never be bothered again.’”
“I love you too.”
“He not home?” Eileen asks.
“Of course, we saw it as we were driving in, we’ll meet you there in a few minutes.”
“Cool.”
“Okay, I guess this is what we’re doing,” Cass says, standing in front of Gabriel, the archangel blade gripped tightly in his hand.
Everyone gathers into a group and prepares to celebrate the end of an insane year and hope for a peaceful 2021. They all stare at the clock in anticipation as the second hand rounds the bottom of the clock.
“You’re still no fun,” Charlie says.
“Ya.”
“I don’t care what you think. I don’t regret what I did. Then or now.”
“Epic job saving the world.”
“Either way, he is human,” Jesse says. “Why is it even an issue if he’s free? It just means you don’t have to deal with him”
“So it wasn’t the pastor after all,” Dean says.
“But instead we chose to show him mercy. So his actions are partially on us.”
“By taking out your allies, your friends. ‘God’ shouldn’t be working with Demons. And you shouldn’t be God. You didn’t create this world, you shouldn’t be in charge of it.”
“Derik Simon?” Eileen asks a short, slightly overweight man in a white dress shirt and black slacks.
“No. Didn’t say who it was either, just that they were a member of our church but that’s pretty much everyone in town.”
Amara collapses and their eyes flash blue again as Chuck regains control. He immediately stands and throws everyone back into the wall. The hole crackling closed after Lucifer’s concentration is broken.
“We missed you so much,” Sam says sadly. “I’m so sor-”
Sam, Dean, Cass, and Eileen all sit in the impala. Dean in the driver’s seat.
“Chuck!” Jack yells as he enters Sam and Eileen’s old house. “You’ve gone too far this time!”
Dean laughs and Cass gives him a look of annoyance. “I don’t think I was ever a dick, just misguided.”
“Death has some manner of control over the beings here. They have been know to retrieve an angel or demon on occasion to bring them back to Earth, Heaven, or Hell. But I’ve always been asleep when that happened.”
“I mean it makes sense,” Cass says.
Dean feels arms wrap around him, burying his head in what he assumes is Sam’s shoulder.
“Pastor,” she shakes his hand, her silver ring touching his palm. “I’m Agent Hoth and this is my partner Agent Halen. We’re investigating the death of Edward Kilick and we just had a few questions for you.”
“Me too boys,” John adds.
~~~~~~~~~~
“He killed everyone on the planet. He doesn’t deserve help.”
“I’ve been waiting for this moment for like 40 years, let me have this.”
“Is there anyone at the church that your husband was close with?”
“No,” Jack answers, “Another Angel will have to go with you. They can be your backup also. In case something happens.”
The man looks around and goes back to sweeping the floor.
“Are you sure?” Jack looks to Mary and John nervously.
“And Amara isn’t bad,” Cass adds. “We can trust her.”
“Of course. Anything you need, I’m here to help. Jack has done so much good for Heaven and Earth.”
“Huh?” Jack says.
“Chuck gets all his power back.”
“But then we’d have to listen to him complain,” Dean groans.
“Hi, Dean.” Comes a voice from behind.
“Chuck thought he was invincible too.”
“A soulless body possessing the qualities and powers of Lucifer being released in the world while Jack’s human soul exists here in heaven.”
“Everyone that you thought I could trust. Gabriel, Balthazar, Samandriel, and quite a few others who have been on your side in the past.”
“That’s just the thing I want to see. My boyfriend beating up my dad.”
“What?”
“Keep him in the dungeon.”
“How do we stop him?”
“I lied. I don’t have friends, or a job, or a home. I have absolutely no idea how to do anything anymore. You guys are all I have.” No one responds. “Please, I just need to get out of here then you’ll never hear from me again.”
“Cass!”
“Then let’s get closer,” Balthazar responds.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,” Cass mutters as he paces around the room. They are back in heaven now, in Cass and Dean’s living room. Everyone but them, Jack, Sam, and Gabe are still in Hell figuring out the details of the plan. Gabe’s body is lying on the couch. Technically it’s his empty vessel that Loki made for Gabe to possess and pretend to be him, but it’s still Gabe to them all, it’s what they’ve always seen as him. “This was a terrible idea. There’s no way this is going to work. Now Chuck just got more power and Gabriel gave his life for absolutely no reason. It should have been me instead. Gabriel’s more powerful and important in this fight.”
“Yes, I can see everyone but Chuck now. They are both on Earth and I can only assume that Chuck is with them.”
“Why the hell did we not think of that? I’ll go let the others know.” Dean stands and leaves. Just before Sam is about to do the same Ash gets his attention.
“Hey if anyone deserves retirement it’s you,” Dean says, wrapping his arm around Cass’ shoulders. “Jack can handle this.” He looks back over at Sam and Eileen who are both smiling like children at Dean’s out-of-character public display of affection (that isn’t making out with a random woman at a bar). Dean blushes. “Shut up. Has Chuck shown himself at all since I’ve been out?”
“The guard is dead and the cell door has been blasted open. Chuck’s gone. Someone broke him out.”
“Oh look, it’s my grandson who betrayed me.”
—————————————————————
“Are you sure we don’t have to do anything?” Dean asks Balthazar.
“Ya, well, Sam enters every room with ‘so get this'.”
“Where’s Gabriel?” Cass asks sternly, slowly descending the stairs. “What did you do to him?”
Jesse walks slowly over to where Rowena is sitting with the codex and Book of the Damned.
Cass walks over to him. “Ya, I’m fine. We just had some past issues to hash out.”
Jack turns back to Chuck. “Amara are you there?”
Cass looks down and pulls it out of his back pocket.
“Ya, it did.”Gabe wiggles his eyebrows.
Dean looks over at Cass, “Can I talk to you before you guys go?” Cass nods and he and Dean walk into the other room.
“No, you’re not. You’re hunters.”
“I can feel you rebels out there,” Chuck yells from inside the cabin.
“Ya good Jack?” Sam asks after Jack stops glowing.
“It’s no problem. I’m always happy to do God’s work.”
“Yes, Dean.”
“We’re gonna do what now?” Gabe says.
“Apparently not.”
“That wasn’t your fault, Jesse,” Dean says after a moment. “The power that was released with Amara must have been drawn to you for some reason. It wasn’t that you couldn’t control your powers, it’s that that power wasn’t from you. It was just channeled through your body.”
“Shut up. Let’s just sit down.”
“Power-share huh?”
“Whatever.”
“Jack! What happened? Are you okay?”
“I know. I wish he could have just been a kid. It isn’t fair to him but if any one person has to have that amount of power, Jack is the one I would trust with it.”
“I’m right here!”
“He hasn’t changed, has he,” Cass says as soon as they get out, stopping to allow Dean to take a breath.
“What’s the rush?” Cass says. “You’re all kinda here for eternity.”
“Nope,” Dean responds.
“And whether you keep your powers or not, or stay on Earth or don’t, we want you to know that you deserve to be happy,” Sam adds.
“Yes”, Sam, Jack, Bobby, and Eileen say simultaneously.
“I’ve seen your type here before. A year or so ago. Eddie and my’s friends Cara and Maggie were killed while walking back from youth group. A man showed up after claiming to be FBI but I quickly learned otherwise when he started asking questions about strange noises and smells.”
“We don’t care,” Jack responds bluntly.
“Dean, I…”
“Sam, you shouldn’t be texting and driving. You’re gonna get us all killed.”
“What did you think would happen after a regime change?” Gabe responds as they stand at the front of the ‘throne room’. “Just 'cause we’re angels doesn’t mean we’re peaceful.”
“Oh it’ll likely get weirder,” Sam laughs quietly. “Okay, we’ll leave you with Jack. But, um, first, Cass, you want to get his grace?”
Cass looks over at Dean then Sam. They both nod hesitantly. “Hey, Jack?” Cass says. “You listening? We got a friend here that would like to talk to you.”
“Let him rot in there,” Dean says bluntly.
“So you’re just gonna let yourself die?”
Sam bows his head and laughs. “Ya, he is.”
They reach the front and separate to their individual sides, turning to watch their partners approach. Their parents take their seats in the front row.
“Ok pop in any time.” She smiles at Jack then turns back to Sam. “You too Samuel. And tell Dean and Castiel to come by soon as well. I want to hear all about their new relationship.”
“How…? Did we just win?” Dean smiles hesitantly and turns to Jack, pulling him up and enveloping him in a bear hug, tears streaming down his face, “thank you.”
“Maybe it’s because of all the mirrors we smashed in the Bloody Mary case. What was it I said? 600 years bad luck?”
“I still can’t believe you boys fought God and won without me. It wasn’t that long ago that you couldn’t handle a ghost without calling me up for help.”
“I’m afraid you won’t like the details.”
“They did. They also taught me that family doesn’t end in blood and it doesn’t start there either. So you aren’t my family. My family is Cass and Sam and Dean.” He looks over at Kelly. “It’s my mom and Rowena.” He looks back at Chuck. “Eileen, Mary, John, Gabriel, Bobby, Charlie, Jodi, Donna, Ash, Ellen, Jo, Rufus.” He looks to his side. “and you Jesse.” Jesse cracks a small smile and nods. “So you see Chuck, you mean absolutely nothing to me. So don’t try that family shit with me. Because I have a family and you are not a part of it.”
The call is from the Sacramento Police Department.
Sam, Eileen, and Dean sit in the living room of Sam and Eileen’s house.
“Oh.”
“Hmm.”
“Oh fuck off. Let’s just get ready for midnight.”
“I love you.”
Jack starts to smile. He’s had his ups and downs with the brothers but in the end, they were a family. They only had each other.
“So I’ll ask again. What are you doing here?”
“Cass, he has no power and is in a prison cell. You and Dean can handle this. Just don’t let him get in your head.”
“Ya. If any situation were to suddenly become easy I would definitely choose this one.”
“Well, that’s not going to happen. How about I just put you to sleep instead?”
“I’m going to be fine. I promise.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just as I was leaving town Sunday morning.”
“I didn’t do anything, Castiel. The Shadow thingy would only let one of us leave and good ol’ Gabe knew I was more valuable to the mission. So here I am.”
“I need to know how to power-share,” Jack says.
“Who am I to mess with fate? And you were wrong before. I do know you. Death is the only thing that will last forever. So time has no effect on me. I know everything that has, will and might happen. I know every possible timeline, even before God does.” Death pulls off his ring and holds it out for Dean. “And I know if you do not return this, the consequences are disastrous for the world.”
“You mean to tell me, one of you finally grew a pair and pulled your head out of your ass and no one told me! I’ve been trying to get you two idiots together for 12 fucking years and I’m the last to know about this!”
“What do you want, Cassiel.”
“Just one night of peace, that’s all I wanted,” Sam mumbles as he grabs his phone off of the nightstand.
“Dean!” Sam interrupts, confused as fuck. “I’m not the one you’re holding onto right now.”
“He isn’t a bad guy. And I didn’t give him all that much power. Nothing near the level he used to have.”
“You all see the version of each other that you love the most or are most familiar with. For example, you see Bobby as an older man while his wife sees him as much younger. And you guys see me as my vessel from Earth instead of my true form because that is what you know.”
“I dunno. There’s just this part of me that needs to get some closure. See him locked up. Tell him again that he lost and that he’s getting what he deserves.”
“He thinks he deserves it,” Cass whispers without taking his eyes off of Jack.
“What does that mean for Jack?” Dean asks.
“That sounds too good to be true but I hope that’s the case,” Jack says.
“I swear, it’s like I never woke up. Everything is just mirroring my dream in one way or another.”
“Not even slightly.”
Jack’s eyes get wide. “What! What happened? I’m so sorry, if I had known I would have come to heal you so much sooner.”
The seconds feel like hours to everyone in the room until finally, Amara reaches the entrance. She looks over to Cass and Jack. Their faces reflect their guilt and sorrow for Amara’s fate but also great appreciation for her sacrifice. She gives them a sad smile and nod before launching her and Chuck into the black hole.
Gabriel and Dean stand over Sam, who is crouching over the destroyed cell door. “You’ve been looking at that door for like five minutes.”
“But that would also mean Chuck likely is not in Heaven anymore.” Sam groans.
“I’m sorry to hear that. Because you may have the power of God, but you are not him. You still have human in you, a human with a fatal weakness. And thanks to Death, we know what that weakness is and how to exploit it.”
“Yep. Carl Styl. 43 years old. Was married to Mary Styl. No kids.”
“I created this heaven for a couple that was together for 68 years. They died within 2 weeks of each other.”
“We can come back to this after my boyfriend ices God, God’s sister, and possibly the Devil.”
“Sorry to hear that. I was hoping to see him all old and wrinkly.”
“Cool,” Jesse laughs. His childlike facial expression reminds the others just how young he actually is. This is the first time since they found him that his mind seems at ease.
“Ya we’ve missed not seeing you every day,” Sam says.
“Because you’re alive. The good ol’ flaming sword wouldn’t have let you live if you weren’t forgiven by them and yourself.” Dean groans and Chuck sighs, go back to sleep Junior.”
“One sec. I just have one last question for ya Chuckles. How exactly did you lose? I mean you were freaking God! Omniscient, Omnipotent, the whole shebang. How is it that you were defeated by the things that you created for your own amusement?”
“Sam! Someone’s here, they’re trying to break down the door!”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I still don’t get why you never mentioned them.”
“Ya. All good. Or I will be when everyone gets back.”
“I heard that!” Dean yells from the doorway.
“Sam,” she says.
Dean is speechless as he looks Cass up and down. Cass chuckles and does the same to Dean, who is wearing the same outfit as him with the exception of a green flower instead of blue.
“That’s your big idea?” Cass responds. “Dying?”
The music starts and the others immediately recognize it as Zepp’s “All of My Love”. It starts out with just Dean singing as Cass is still slightly unwilling but he finally jumps in at the chorus. His gravelly voice starts out shaky, trying to stay in sync with Dean, but after a few lines, he gets the hang of it. Their deep voices mesh well as they continue on with the song past the chorus. Cass’ singing voice is surprisingly beautiful once he relaxes a bit. Dean can’t help but stare at Cass as he reads the lyrics off the screen.
Cass sighs and meets Jesse’s eyes. “I’m sorry you got dragged into this. You didn’t deserve to deal with this bullshit back then and you definitely don’t deserve it now. I wish you could have just been a normal kid.”
He has to get Cass back, even if it’s the last thing he does. He WILL help him this time, whether Cass likes it or not. He was too fucking emotionally constipated to tell him he love him when it really counted. Cass died thinking that his feelings were unrequited and that hurt Dean more than anything else.
“Mr. Kilick,” Sam starts.
Kelly pulls back and smiles. “There is no one I would rather be his father than you, Castiel.”
“But what if the Empty has gotten stronger or something and he isn’t even given a chance to stay awake?”
“No, it’s not Gabriel.” Cass chuckles. “But Jack did rescue him and many others from the Empty. It’s Balthazar, he volunteered.
Cass looks across the field. There are less than half of them left. Only five of the angels, Jack, and Hades remain of God’s power. That means Chuck is nearly at half power. Everyone slowly merges together into a group, the hunters looking around to tally their losses. Many are covered in blood and black goo. No one has gotten by without a cut or bruise… or twenty. Jack is pale and staring blankly at the crowd.
“Ooooo look who’s been watching CSI.”
“Touché, but technically you’re the only one that can die again since I’m already in my afterlife so…”
“Fuck you! I’m done!”
Sam and Dean sit in silence as they wait for Michael and Jack to return from their search for Jesse. That silence is broken by Dean.
Sam laughs as he leaves the room.
“Bitch.”
Cass laughs. “Have you had one of those before?”
“I’m fine, I assure you. Whatever it is, it’s attacking the human portion of Jack. His grace wasn’t damaged but it is unable to heal his body for some reason.”
“When you say it like that we almost sound normal dysfunctional family.”
“Okay, let’s do this,” Jesse says.
Cass nods and sighs.
~~~~~~~~~~
“We won Cass. Chuck is gone, the empty is asleep again, everyone’s safe.”
“You’re wrong. He hurt my family. I can’t let you do this.”
“Dean, they’re my responsibility.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh, he’s sooooo dead.” Dean storms out of the house, yelling, “I’m going to rip his LUNGS out!”
“Exactly. I tried to. No regular angel could take him out.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Crazy day.” Eileen signs.
Rowena sighs sadly, “Well nothing we can do about it now I guess.”
“Well, you got the drive down there to think about it. Good luck.” Bobby says as he turns and heads back towards the house.
Everyone is silent for a moment.
“No, it's not. It’s a copout. An easy ending to your favorite show. But it’s not just a show that you 'canceled', you are destroying innocent lives. And I can’t let you go through with it.”
“Either way, my presence caused hundreds of innocent people to die. So I haven’t used my powers since then. And I’m not planning on using them any time in the future.”
“Should we confer with the others?”
——————————————————————————
“Damn.”
Dean smiles and places a kiss on Cass’ head. “Why don’t you take a little break and I’ll keep looking?”
“So you all kind of adopted him?”
Dean laughs and walks up to give Benny a bear hug. “It is really good to see you, man.” He says as they pull apart. “But how are you here? I didn’t think vamps could come to Heaven.”
“Gabriel is getting them set them up at a place near here.”
“Jack. I’m so glad you guys are okay. What happened?” Sam says.
“Okay,” Cass smiles and gives Jack a hug. “How much longer do you think you’ll need to be in heaven?”
They appear in a large dark warehouse that’s completely empty besides some bare shelves along the walls. A figure is visible in the moonlight on the other side of the building.
“Dean, you need to go back, no matter how much it hurts,” Lisa says.
“Ya, we can,” Sam says through the door.
Everyone sighs in relief.
Jack nods and places his hand on Cass’ shoulder, closing his eyes in concentration. After a few moments, Jack opens one eye. “Do you feel anything?”
“Not sure if that’s a good or bad thing,” Charlie responds.
“Sam. Dean. Long time.”
“Okay Jebediah. I’m here. Now what.”
“You’re right.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh fuck off. You’re one to talk.”
Dean sits a large burger down in front of Jesse. “Eat up. You gotta get some meat on those bones.”
“We hate to ask this but, do you think it’s possible that your husband was behind their deaths?” Eileen asks.
Sam and Eileen rush in, their guns raised. The first thing they see when they enter is Martin, his knife across Micah’s throat. The others are, lying in the background, hopefully just unconscious.
“Release Sam and Eileen’s son, and let’s just talk.”
“I’m glad to hear you say that.”
Sam sighs and runs his hand over his face, “well in case we don’t find anything else we should probably prepare for the worst but still only cross that bridge if we need to. This could eventually be our only option given how little information there is on the sword.”
“Sounds good but, um, I have a family of my own now. They were visiting my in-laws when Chuck came. Do you know if they’re safe?”
Cass pulls Dean towards the exit. Dean’s eyes staying on Chuck, who continued to smile at Dean until he was out of sight.
“Dude, you’re God. How did that happen?”
“Maybe not. The members of ‘Team Free Will’ were the only ones that Chuck wanted to punish. And yet you are still here. It’s possible that if he was hiding well enough against the forces of Heaven, like his must have been staying off their radar all these years, Chuck may have missed him. Or Chuck could have just killed off all the non angels and demons, meaning he could have been demon enough to have missed it.”
“You don’t get to make that decision. Do you really think I want to be God? I just want to live a normal life, be a kid. But I don’t get to because someone had to save the world from Chuck. Someone had to take on the responsibility.”
“I’ve killed people too, Jesse, innocent people. Getting rid of your powers won’t bring those people back.”
“Ya things are great, let me just put you on speaker.”
“Long story. Another time. For now, we still have 12 years to make up for.” Dean pulls Cass in for another much needed kiss.
Gabe nods in response.
“Well, this’ll be interesting.” Sam laughs.
Jack smiles at his family and continues his search. The laughter quiets down as the group starts thinking more about what they are actually having to deal with. If Chuck has a group of angels and Jesse on his payroll then they could have another Civil War in Heaven ahead of them. Especially if more angels decide to side with Chuck and try to overthrow Jack. “I found him.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ya, uh, Bobby said he helped Jack rebuild Heaven.”
“Ya,” Sam says. “He does.”
Sam sighs. “I guess I wasn’t around to protect them anymore.”
Jebediah responds with a swing at Jack with his angel blade. Jack easily dodges it and blasts him with his powers. Jebediah flies back and knocks over two of the angels backing him up. The other two angels run at him and he stops them in their tracks and forces them to the ground. He walks up and placing his hands on their shoulders. He closes his eyes as they yell in pain. When he opens his eyes they are lying on the ground with their eyes burned out. He turns around just as Jebediah stabs at him. The blade slices deep across his chest as he attempts to move out of the way. His grace shines through the cut as his shirt soaks up the dripping blood.
“What?”
“He means literally blow it up. Human style. There are enough nukes and explosives on Earth to blow up a planet 10 times its size. All they have to do is possess the world leaders.”
“So what happens now? Ya know, with Chuck and stuff.”
Dean doesn’t respond to Sam, or I guess himself, for a moment.
Dean jumps and looks over at his concerned family. “Do you hear that?”
“And nothing. I told him that nothing that has happened is his fault and that the only thing that he deserves is happiness and he said he understood.”
“I agree.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Looking across the street he sees Death sitting alone in the Rinascita Pizzeria across the street. Dean sighs and starts making his way towards the pizza place, hoping that he beats his past self to the scene. Death doesn’t even know him yet, what’s to stop him from killing him on the spot. Dean isn’t the same person that he was a decade ago. He isn’t as charismatic as he once was. Not as confident. He doesn’t even remember what he said to him when he got the ring from Death the first time. How did he get that lucky? Wait, that’s right, it was Chuck’s doing, part of his story. This time he’s on his own.
They all move to sit down in the living room, Jack, and John, and Mary taking the two armchairs and Sam, Eileen, Dean and Cass squeezing onto the large couch. “So whatcha gonna do now that you’re not God, Jack?” Mary asks.
Sam smiles. “Me too. Definitely the best New Year I’ve ever had.”
“Jake.”
“Technically yes but we would have to do a spell and they probably have the area warded against magic. Plus by the time we get the ingredients together, Jack’ll probably be back.”
“Brother say anything else?” Dean asks.
“Fuck off it was a dream, I had no control.” Liar. He hesitantly looks over at Cass, who looks slightly hurt to Dean. “Fuck, I didn’t mean it like that. It- it was the greatest day of my life, even if it wasn’t real.”
“I don’t say ‘awesome’ that much.”
“Sounds like a plan.”
Dean feels a lump in his throat growing. It’s because of him. Because Cass didn’t think Dean loved him back but sacrificed himself to save him anyway. Because he had been hiding for so long that he was happy with just telling Dean how he truly felt. He thought that his life was worth less than Dean’s. Than Jack’s. Than Sam’s. Cass thought that he was just a tool to them in saving the world. Because Dean never told him the truth about how he feels.
“You gave Hades God power?”
“Jerk.”
“You okay kid?”
“So, Castiel, how long ago did you stop being a dick?”
“Actually, things are pretty calm in Heaven right now and Gabe has really stepped up so I was thinking about coming home for a while.”
“You better not.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Seriously, Dean,” Sam groans.
“What?” Dean responds.
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
“You can say it. I got old.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“If that were true I would have been attracted to Jimmy after you left his body for those few days or Lucifer, but I wasn’t. I find you adorable, not your vessel.” Cass smiles shyly and looks down at his feet. “Hey, you said I didn’t have to lie anymore. I gotta get everything out that I’ve been holding in.” Dean places his hand under Cass’ chin and tilts his head up to meet him in a quick kiss. “We should probably head back before I go back in there and punch Chuck.”
“What did I do.”
“Thanks. I hope.”
“3!” They all start in unison. “2! 1! Happy New Year!!!”
“Well, this was definitely a good day.”
Dean sighs and collapses onto the couch next to Eileen.
The crowd of people there is enormous. It’s full of people who didn’t even realize he remembered. Everyone they lost or they saved along the way. People they’ve hunted with, fought with. Dean’s flings and ex's from long ago, Sam’s as well. Everyone that has ever known the Winchesters are there because they have all been a part of getting Dean to this moment in his mind. Bobby stands at the front, ready to perform the ceremony. Benny, Charlie, and Donna are on Dean’s side, Jack, Kelly, and Claire on Cass’. Even though Claire hadn’t died yet in this universe, Dean couldn’t imagine it without her. On the other side of the aisle, Jody, Kevin, and Rowena stand where Sam will be, with Eileen’s birth mother and father, and Marlene, who she stayed good friends with, standing on Eileen's side.
“New leadership, new rules.”
“I- I just don’t want to cause anyone any more pain.”
“Hades?!” Dean and Cass respond simultaneously.
“No, you’re not. And I’m not either.” Dean doesn’t respond. “Let’s go get Eileen and she can be the deciding vote.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ya. And we tried it out on Hades. It worked.”
“He’s gonna find out sooner or later Dean.” Sam responds.
They come to a screeching halt in front of the motel, both of them jumping out without even turning off the car. The door is knocked down and the alert Sam set up is screeching like a car alarm.
“Hmm?” He snaps back into it.
“Do it. Open the cage,” Cass yells to Lucifer after striking down a rogue reaper.
“We require your assistance, Gabriel.”
“Hi, buddy!” Dean says, walking over to them. He checks the tag. “Lucy. You should meet Miracle. I think the two of you would get along real well.” Miracle is staying with Jodi right now while they’re on the road.
“You’re the one I trust the most. I want you to be the first one I give some of God’s power to.”
Their eyes flash black. “No. You’ve been in control of the world for too long. I’m not going to let this happen.”
Jesse just looks down at his feet and shrugs.
“Dean, you don’t have a body to inhabit on Earth. It isn’t even an option.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Couldn’t have done it without you.”
“Of course it is. He and Charlie are gonna be one hell of a team.”
“The table.” Sam says pointing to the 3 initials carved in.
“They are innocent children,” Sam pleads. “They have done nothing wrong.”
“Come on, we should get back and wait for Jack and Cass.”
Eileen nods in reluctant agreement.
“Maybe,” Cass responds. “But I’m not sure how it would work. Especially since the mark is on Chuck slash Amara.”
“That’s great Jesse,” Sam says.
“Is it dangerous?” Charlie asks.
“So let me guess. The Winchesters want me to take out my father? You know I can’t do that.”
“Okay, deal.” Sam pulls out his phone and starts playing Sudoku.
“Of course. I really hope you solve this.”
“Don’t even say ‘if’. You are coming back to me, or I will drag your sorry ass outta the empty myself.”
“There’s at least one angel that’s on Chuck’s side so there’s probably more. That mean’s Jack and in turn, the world is in danger.”
“Hey everyone’s workin’ on your plan”
Dean shakes his head. “Never mind, it’s gone. I’m probably just hearing things.”
He looks back up at Sam with fear in his eyes. Sam looks at him with pity. “You know how.”
Jack swallows back his fear and turns to walk back into the group, Leaving Cass to reluctantly lead the army.
“We’ll see.”
“That’s great! What’s her name?”
“The cemetery that Dean almost killed me in, then Chuck actually killed me, then Chuck released all the souls from hell, then…”
“I’m from Hell, Canada’s too cold for me. So do we have a deal or what? Save in world in exchange for the throne?”
“Wait, what happens when he has to go to the bathroom?” Dean asks.
Eileen suddenly looks at Micah. “We need to get you somewhere safe. You and anyone else you think might be targeted.”
“Anything’s possible but with the process that we had to go through to get Jack there, it’s unlikely.”
“How could you think that I would want that?" Dean tried to stand but falls down.
“What’s your name,” Cass says walking up behind Jack with his blade drawn, followed by Sam, Dean, Eileen and Jesse.
“What the Hell! Is he alone?”
“Then I’d take advantage of it for as long as I could.”
“I’ll do my best but no promises.” Eileen responds.
Sam pulls Eileen close and dips her back as they kiss. Claire and Kaia share a sweet kiss, giggling as they pull away.
Jack and Cass stand outside the bunker. “I appreciate you remaking my body for this.”
“I might be able to find him. I am ‘God’ after all. He can hide his powers but I don’t think he can hide himself as a person.”
Hades smiles. “Man, that feels good.”
“Not if Chuck wins and we all get wiped out. Upside.”
“I didn’t even think of that,” Sam says. “I’ll get on it. Thanks, Jesse.”
“Wait. I’m fucking Death.” Dean says to himself. “What power does Death have here?”
“Would you want to fight your dad if you could avoid it?”
“Touche.”
“He and Cass had some catching up to do and… wait how did you know what I said? I wasn’t even facing you.”
“I was asleep for 2 weeks,” he said, “I’m good to go for a while. Besides Jack fully healed me so I’m all good to go.”
“Who?”
“Father Jackson said you’re cleaned of your ‘sins’ and you should be healing. But he also said that you may need to forgive yourself first.”
“What’re your plans now?” Sam asks Dean as they sit alone on the porch. Cass and Jack went back to regroup with the rest of the angels and Eileen went to visit some old hunter friends.
“Damn Chief, you got sappy.” Benny interrupts Dean and Cass’ reunion.
“Okay. Good.” They all sit down.
“What? Straight to the point.”
“So this is it,” they stop at the old guest room. “It’s not much but the bed is fairly comfortable and there’s hot water. Bathrooms are just down that way. Kitchen is up the stairs, help yourself to anything in there. There isn’t much at the moment but we’ll make a supply run tomorrow.”
“Is that you?” Eileen asks.
“Amara, we need you to transfer the Mark to Jesse.”
“Chuck, put him down and talk to us,” Jack says slowly.
Sam does the last thing one would do when fighting God himself, he prays. “Michael? Look I know you wanted out and you want no part in this fight, but we need you, the world needs you.” Silence. “Please.”
“I can just send the humans back to their homes and you guys,” Cass gestures at Garth and Benny, “are coming to Heaven, where you deserve to be.”
“Then why did you call us and not one of your friends?” Sam asks.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Is he okay?” Eileen asks the second Jack and Jesse reappear.
“It’s my wedding, we’re having pie.”
“I promise Cass. Same goes for you.” After a moment to take a breath Dean takes Cass’ hand in his own and presses a quick kiss against his lips. “Let’s do this.”
“Don’t worry about it.” She smiles at Cass. “We’ve been getting bored in retirement.”
“How did everyone know about us but us?” Dean asks.
“Me neither. Too long having denied, well, everything. I think it’s always going to feel like some sort of alcohol-induced dream.”
“Being a dick.”
“What Dean is trying to say,” Cass says, “is that our parents or our past don’t dictate who we really are. Everything you have done has stemmed from good intentions, and that’s what makes you a good person.”
“That was not specified in our agreement.”
“I’m sorry.”
I have zero plans for the rest of this, I'm just making it up as I go along so wish me luck
“To show Jesse why he should keep his powers.”
“Gee, good to see you too.”
“Still something to do while we wait.”
“Martin?” Eileen asks as a bald man with dog tags hanging around his neck opens the door.
Sams eyed get wide “Jesse.”
“I want to go see Chuck.”
“What are you talking about? Of course he wants out. He doesn’t want to stay in that prison for the rest of eternity.”
“How strong?” Dean asks.
“Your test results came back all clear and you are officially a free man. It’s quite frankly a miracle given the state you came in when you arrived.”
“Just be careful Jack.”
“Well even when you were just a Nephilim you could hold your own with God when you were at full power,” Cass says. “Is there a chance there was another one born without our knowledge?”
“Then they’re either being cocky or it’s a trap.”
“Do you think Chuck could actually do that?” Sam asks.
She turns to Eileen, “keep this guy safe for me,” pointing to Sam.
“It's not a sin to have been born Jack.”
“I’m Agent Hoth, this is my partner Agent Halen. We’re investigating the death of Edward Kilick. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?”
“Night guys,” Cass says to everyone as he drags Dean out of the room. Sam and Eileen follow.
“Oh, I’ll give them to you but don’t think for a moment that that means you won. We’re just getting started.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Right? I can’t even imagine what it would be like to just be normal or in our case, enjoy Heaven like a normal dead person.”
“I need to go.”
“Either way, how do we find this kid?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I dunno. I guess it would depend on what I had waiting for me in the real world. When I was in the coma after that Dick shot me, if I had one of those dreams, I wouldn’t have even hesitated to choose to wake up, cause I knew you boys needed me. But if I was just dying in general, after I had lived a good, long life, I’d probably live out the rest of my days in my mind.”
“No. Sorry but it’s not. Our deal was that I get to replace dear ol’ Dad as God.”
“You’re dead and I’m an angel, what would that even mean.”
With a whooshing sound, he is gone and Cass collapses back onto the couch. “What if they kill him? What if this was the wrong thing to do? We never should have let him get rid of his powers. It just made him vulnerable. If anything…”
“Hello!” Jack does his regular wave before he holds out his hand towards Jesse. “I’m Jack,”
Sam and Eileen started dancing together at the beginning of the song, followed by Claire and Kaia, and Jesse and Patience, who hit it off right away. Jody and Donna join in now, teasingly mimicking Jesse and Patience’s awkward slow dancing. Seeing them all, Dean smiles and wraps his arm around Cass’ waist, and moves closer, still singing along. Cass stutters as he looks at Dean instead of the lyrics, making Dean laugh and look at him smugly.
“Could you give us contact information for someone who could confirm you were at work? Or are there security cameras? Both here and at your work.”
“Are you sure about that?”
Rowena nods “I can’t find anything else. Believe me, if I thought there was another way, I would keep looking for it, but I don’t think there is.”
Dean is drained and exhausted. He stands in the empty field that he had brought everyone to. Even though he planned on immediately returning them to the empty, he still had to fight off some of the more intelligent demons and angels that had realized what happened and didn’t want to return to the empty. Once they were taken care of he was able to cast them all back. Dean takes a breath and turns his ring once more, transporting himself to the empty.
“I’m sure you guys’ll figure it out,” Sam says.
“How long do you think they’ll be gone?” Sam asks.
Always appreciate writing tips :)
“Hell ya.”
“Either way, it doesn’t work like that,” Cass adds. “We can’t just send something or someone to Purgatory or the Empty based on how we see them. They have to actually be a ‘monster’ or a divine being. The only option we have for now is to lock him up in Heaven’s prison.”
“Now why would I do that? My fight isn’t with you. It’s with these abominations.”
“And what do you think of that?” Cass asks.
“Yes. But she didn’t know how to open it, so we need to talk to an archangel. Hopefully, Gabriel knows, or we’re going to have a problem.”
“Amara?” Cass questions.
Amara nods.
“I didn’t feel jealous, I felt betrayed. I gave you all life. I am God. But what thanks do I get now that I’ve been demoted to one of you monkeys? None. I just get insulted. Right to my face.”
“But you are so many things that he wasn’t. You are kind and compassionate. You care about every living thing in this world. You fight for everyone. He only fought for himself.”
“Well, I think you’re a pretty cool guy now.”
“Because I give you my word.”
Amara stands up and begins to make her way towards the gaping hole in the wall, taking small strained steps forward.
“You’re gonna do great things,” Eileen adds.
“Well, Dean would kill me if I let anything happen to you two.” He grabs Cass by the hand a pulls him up before heading over to Jack.
“What would it involve?”
“So why don’t we just get everyone out in the open and away from the city.”
“Idiot.”
“You have the rest part right.” Cass pulls the armchair over to Jack as Sam guides him into it. “But that isn’t going to be enough. We should get Bobby. Have him take a look.”
“What are you walking about? We can’t just give up! That’s not who we are. If we go out we go out swinging remember?”
“Can you tell what it is? Then maybe we can figure out the spell.”
“Why would you want that?”
“Jack,” Sam says, “what happened?”
“We’re investigating the death of your son, Edward and we just had a few questions for you.”
“Was this the blade Cass?” Sam asks holding up a book.
“Good to see my boy’s got good taste,” John says.
“Dean,” Cass says weakly. “What are you doing here? It’s not safe.”
“I got out of hunting after Dean died. Retired with Eileen, started a family, the whole nine yards.”
“Where you off to?”
“How would you know? Have you even read the Bible? Or are you just one of those bleeding heart Atheists?”
“Well, quick summary, he was God,” Cass says, “but he kind of left the picture for a while then he came back but we didn’t know it was him, then he left again, then he came back, left again, and lastly came back and, as Dean says, fucked shit up, so we had to stop him. Chuck became human, Jack is now quote-unquote ‘God’, Chuck died and went to Heaven’s prison then he got broken out and we don’t know how.”
“Ya,” Cass smiles and pulls away slightly so he can look at Dean. “They’re gone.”
“Jack made it loud, he can make it quiet again. You know how powerful he is.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Oh Hell no.” Dean gets wide-eyed.
“It’s amazing Jack.” Sam pulls away. His hand still on Jack’s shoulder. “Why did you never visit? We missed you.”
Claire and Kaia are over in the corner slow dancing in a similar position to Cass and Dean. They too feel comforted by the reassurance that the other is alive and well that comes from physical contact.
“But still a little mad that you didn’t tell us Dean was in a coma,” Jody says in her mom voice.
“Ready as I’ll ever be."
“How could he possibly think that he didn’t lose,” Sam says, rolling his eyes. “He fucking died… as a human. And Jack is God now, not him. And he’s in a prison.”
“Bitch.”
“He was awake for a little bit but he passed back out a few minutes ago.”
“Do you know how minuscule you are compared to my dad?”
“Come on guys, when have I ever stayed dead?”
“Don’t you dare use Terminator against me!” Dean smiled for the first time all day.
Mary rolls her eyes.
Mary nods. “I was the only one in the church that was open-minded. I was the first one Eddie told when he decided to come out as transgender. Same with Cara and Maggie telling me they were in a relationship.”
“We can catch up later,” Cass says. “For now we need to focus on finding Jebediah.”
“Just shut up and come here.” Cass pulls Dean into another kiss. Cass pushes Dean’s jackets off his shoulders and Dean pulls it off the rest of the way, tossing it to the side.
“Well, what’s the big deal? You think I won’t approve of her.”
“What do you suggest we do?” Cass says monotonously without looking up.
“Old age.”
“We were trying to save Dean. And you were the bad guy.”
“Deal.” Cass presses up to meet Dean’s lips.
Chuck starts to laugh and regains his composure. “You think you can stop me?! It took me and all of my Archangels to imprison Amara. And you think you can do it with a Nephilim, an abomination and a broken Archangel?” Chuck laughs once more makes his way in their direction. “You don't have the power. But I appreciate the effort. It makes for a good storyline. One final effort by the Winchester’s.” But Chuck’s smile suddenly disappears as his motions and voice become strained. “No! What are your doing? You have no more power! Stop!!!!”
“I’m sorry we haven’t been there for you until now,” Sam says.
“I know. I just-“ Cass takes a deep breath, “I just can’t give up. Not yet. But you’re right. We need to be ready. Jack can’t go on suffering like this.”
“And yet you love me anyway.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Either way,”  Dean says after a moment, “it’s the only plan we got so let’s get on it.”
Sam laughs sadly. “Ya. It was pretty unexpected and it wasn’t what he deserved. But we’re all together now, so I guess it turned out okay.”
“That’s a chaotic team.”
They look at Cass. “I’ll fill you in later.”
“What?”
“So, what? Do we just go to bed and let him plot in there with Amara?”
Dean shakes his head, “I doubt it. Who knows what Lucifer’s not telling us about what happened in the Empty. There’s no way he just agreed to do this without getting something in return.”
“I guess we’ll figure it out later.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Atara? Why?”
“What do you mean?” Sam asks.
~~~~~~~~~~
Chuck gasps for air and falls to the ground. “Finally!” Jack pulls him up and presses him up against the wall.
“But he’s still alone and he’s only 22, he should have been able to be a normal kid, but we kinda destroyed his life so the least we can do is check in on him.”
“It wasn’t an angel.”
“Where the fuck have you been? You just disappeared! We thought you were dead.” Dean raises his voice (such a dad).
“Cassiel,” Cass says. His voice echoes around the room.
Cass stifles a laugh. “I’m glad to hear. Just a warning, the things he’s going to tell you may be a little out of the ordinary compared to what you are used to hearing.”
“I really hope you’re wrong,” Kevin responds.
“Now go comfort your husband, he’s a mess in there.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Cass presses the blade closer to Atara’s throat, “you heard him. Key. Now.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Dean, Jack is God now. I don’t think backup is necessary.”
“Good luck, Jack,” Sam says as Jack stands up from the table, waves, and disappears.
————————————————————————
“You completely set him up for that, Sammy,” Dean says catching his breath.
“Then everyone would be dead.”
~~~~~~~~~~
They continue walking in silence until they reach the ‘throne room’. “Hannah. We need your help.” Cass says as they approach her.
“Even when you were alive ‘till death do us part’ was irrelevant,” Kevin jokes.
“I don’t see another choice at this point,” Sam says. “He’s a monster, and killing monsters is what we do.”
“He didn’t say it back right then because he’s clearly always been an emotionally repressed closeted bisexual mess.”
“Hello brother,” Gabe says.
“Oh ya. By far,” Sam puts his arm around Eileen and pulls her close to him, both of them closing their eyes and leaning into each other.
“Of course not.”
Jack nods and places his hand on Chuck’s forehead. Chuck’s eyes are wide and full of fear. “Please, I’ll do anything. I won’t ever try anything ever again. I’m sorry I was a terrible God, I-.” His eyes glow blue momentarily before they go dim once again as he slumps forward. Cass puts his hand on Jack’s shoulder and the others move closer, a mix of shock and relief on their faces. Amara looks up at them through Chuck’s eyes.
Sam laughs. “Ya… almost.”
——————————————————————————
“Jesse. Do you know anything about Chuck’s whereabouts?” Jack asks.
Sam and Dean continue on teasing each other while the others listen and laugh. Everyone is truly at peace. This is what a happy ending looks like, even though we know, nothing ever truly ends ;)
“I also get to do your brother,” he responds bluntly.
“Hmmm, na. I’m good. See you guys around, ya know, when I come for my crown.” Before any of them can act, Lucifer is gone, along with the Mark.
Cass laughs. “If it makes you feel any better, I’m much older than you are.”
Dean and John go out the door and head towards the Impala. “Glad to see she made it to Heaven.”
“Well you’re both back alive and that’s all that matters.”
“Somewhere safe.”
“Ahhh you called Cass your boyfriend!” Sam teases.
“You knew this whole time?!”
“Dean. He is at almost 40% power from the last battle and he has an angel possessing the leader of every government on the planet. If he dies, every nuke in the world goes off and everyone dies.”
“So are you gonna tell us about your wedding and your kid or what?” John says after a moment.
“You’re the king of crazy-ass plans.”
“I was so sorry to hear about Dean’s demise. I can’t even imagine how that must have felt. But at least he didn’t end up here!”
“I still feel guilty about that.”
“What?” Dean says bluntly.
“There’s something I can’t place my finger on. Shh.”
“Because I am a better person than you.”
“Who are you?” Jack says to a middle-aged woman that walks up behind Kelly.
“Hi guys. Thanks for comin’. Castiel, Eileen nice to see you two alive.”
Chuck/ Amara yells and Chuck regains control.
“You probably don’t want to know.”
Everyone stands from the table and gathers their trays.
They both start cautiously making their way downstairs, Cass’ blade drawn. As they get closer to the dungeon door, voices are heard, slowly getting clearer.
Before Dean can do anything else to mess with his soon-to-be husband, the music starts. As per Dean’s request, they don’t use the traditional ‘here comes the bride’ music. Instead, what is playing is the tune to Dust in the Wind slowed down slightly. Their parents look to them and start leading them forward down the aisle. John only looks slightly uncomfortable.
Suddenly there’s a whooshing sound and Jack appears in front of them.
“Please Jebediah,” Jack yells over the noise as he faces off with a group of angels. "Enough blood has been shed. It’s not too late.”
“We’ll be in touch.” They turn and head towards the exit. Before they can reach the door a tall teenage boy with dark hair and blue eyes taps Eileen on the shoulder.
“Whatever. Let’s just get this over with.”
“Like I said before Dean. I haven’t lost, you have.”
“Purgatory?” An angel interjects. “We’re resorting to asking monsters for help?”
“Lucifer abandoned me to make his demons and I was forced to live among humanity. I didn’t use my powers, I didn’t interact with anything, I just watched.”
“It was a group of angels. They threatened to send my family to Hell if I didn’t do what they wanted. They told me I had to block some breakout from the mind of a Nephilim. It wasn’t very hard cause their jailbreaker wasn’t a huge beacon of power. They didn’t tell me who it was but when I was doing it, I could tell it was a reaper. And they blew themselves up. Blasted open the door and the dude just walked out. Then they forced me to break the connection. But ‘Chuck’ is still hidden. I heard them talking to a witch.”
“Sam doesn’t understand. He has Eileen. He can move on from hunting and start a normal life, have a family. I can’t. I can’t just move on from Cass. He was it for me. And I can’t just keep hunting. It’s not what I want.”
“Do you think they could actually do it?” Bobby says, breaking the silence.
They reach the door and Sam hesitantly rings the doorbell. Cass and Dean stand behind him, both still visible.
“Ok, let’s get this party started then. You and my dear nephew can go to Earth for whatever reason and I’ll take Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb here on a tour around Heaven.”
“Better. Thank you, Cass.”
“This is not gonna end well.” Jesse says monotonously standing next to Jack outside the bunker. “And why do they keep choosing this dump?”
“Why not? I’ve been happy with the lie so far. Besides, a fake Cass is better than no Cass.”
“We understand.”
“How are you doing that?” Dean interrupts Sam.
“Got it,” Cass responds smiling. “And if you ever die that stupidly again I will make you spend eternity listening to Vince Vicente’s albums on repeat.”
“He’s in Heaven.”
“Dad. This is Cass.”
Dean wakes up from his coma.
“Cas, he...”
“What-.” Dean starts before seeing Lucifer standing there, alone.
“Really? Cause they were able to defeat you.”
“Then what is it?”
“Excuse me?”
“Why Eva?” Jack asks.
“Jack! Are you okay?” Cass grabs his arm to keep him from falling.
“I’m trying to believe that, I am.”
“Okay. Reason?”
“Well one of us already has grey hair.”
“Cass,” Dean starts, “why does she have the same name as you?”
“Will do,” Dean nods. She turns and heads back towards the Cafeteria exit.
Dean spins around to see Meg sitting in what appeared to be a throne. “Meg?”
“Were you able to figure out how to use the Mark to locate and open the cage?” Cass asks.
“Nothing.”
Chuck appears to be talking to himself. “What else was I supposed to do? I couldn’t stay in jail with those disgusting people.” “Ya ya ya I know but how was I supposed to know they would keep me in here?”
“He was. And he still is, just not in this room. He’s in the storeroom.”
Tears stream down Cass’ face. “Jack,” he sobs. “You do not deserve this. You know why? Because you are good. We all have done bad things but it doesn’t make us bad. It doesn’t make us ‘sinners’. It makes us human. Even if the two of us aren’t actually human our mistakes make us more and more human with every single screw-up. They make us closer to the people we love because they forgive us and love us no matter what we do. So don’t you dare say that you deserve this because if you deserve it then we all do. Everyone in the entire universe.”
“And what is that right reason?”
“What if I take everyone out, you go to sleep and then I send everyone back, asleep. Except Cass. Death can send people to the empty with a snap right?”
“Cass,” Dean interrupts, “stop talking. I couldn’t reciprocate because you didn’t give me a chance to. You were just gone. I couldn’t even process what you had said until after. I’ve been denying how I feel since we first met because I thought angels weren’t capable of feeling that way about somebody.” Cass looks hopeful and terrified at the same time. “I love you too, Cass. I’ve always loved you.”
“Where the hell are we?” Jesse asks, looking around at the bright green meadow that Jack has taken them to.
“Cassie? I thought you two broke up.”
“So we gettin’ this party started or what!?” Gabe interrupts.
They all sit at the table watching the live security footage of Chuck on Sam’s laptop. Jesse is there too. He stayed behind to fill everyone in before they went home and take care of Miracle and Lucy.
“Did they ever confide in you? Possibly about their sexualities or identities,” Eileen asks
“So Jack probably knows how to do it, he just doesn’t know that he knows.”
Sam, Dean, Eileen, Charlie, Kevin, and Jo all sit out on the porch of the Leahy house.
“Hmmm… I’m not so sure I want that scum in my kingdom. My demons may not be too happy having the former God down here.”
“Is there a way for me to be able to talk to Rowena myself? It would be nice to see her after so long.” Sam asks.
~~~~~~~~~~
“And neither do the humans! Don’t you see! I created humanity in my image and that is why they are flawed. That is why it needs to be redone. Don’t defend them, Jack, Help me fix them.”
They decide to put on The Danish Girl because Sam insists it’s a must-watch movie. Dean insists he didn’t cry at the end but he totally did (so did everyone else). By the time the credits are rolling, everyone’s eyes are heavy.
“Cass.” He stands and walks closer. “I’m so sorry. I should have responded but…”
“I love you,” Kaia whispers.
“What about redemption and second chances?”
“Oh, Jack. We aren’t people. We just happen to look it. Why would you want to protect a world that you don’t belong in? One that does horrible things. We could have been great together. We could have created an entirely new universe. One that actually celebrates us for who we are. Not one that fights wars and discriminates and destroys in my name, but one that has peace and contentment.”
Cass interjects. “Wait, Jesse, the antichrist? The mark? What the hell happened while I was gone?
“Anything else? Any tiny detail or conversation?”
“We'll keep looking, we’re not going to let him die.”
Before Jack can respond Cass is enveloped in a hug from Kelly. “Thank you for protecting my baby.”
“Hell ya! Field trip!”
“Well, your bad luck is ending,” Jesse says. “We’re going to save your son and end Chuck once and for all.”
“Are you sure you want to do transfer that much power Jack?”
“It’s supposed to be just something they do. Like breathing.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You get to talk to him?”
“Well you’ve never talked to the son of Lucifer who became God then gave up being God and is now dying from being cut by the Flaming Sword.”
“So are you guys going to tell us the details?” Dean says, wrapping his arm around Cass.
“Cass. It’s the best plan we’ve had. And it could solve two problems.” Cass looks at him with pity. “I shouldn’t be God. And I don’t want to be God.”
“Dean, please, this is the only way for peace and balance. This is the only way to save this beautiful world.” She turns to Jack, Jesse and Michael. “NOW!”
“How would Jack not dying help, Chuck?”
Gabriel rolls his eyes. “I’m an archangel and I got stuck playing detective with Nancy Drew over here.”
“So we go talk to the widow?”
“It’s what I’m here for.”
“Jack! What’s happening? Hey! Something’s happening!”
They had made a trip to hell to ask her if she knew the spell they needed, and of course she did but, if they were gonna take on God himself, she wanted in. She has a bone to pick with him after all. He’s she reason she’s dead after all. Her and Sam begin performing the spell to undo the magic that they performed to remove the mark from Dean. But this time they would tie the Mark to Jesse (Jesse was already part demon so the mark shouldn’t have the same effect that it had on Dean). They didn’t want Jesse to have to take on this burden but he had insisted that it was the only way to stop Chuck. They needed the Mark to be tied to someone in order to lock the cage. Cain had found a way to make peace with it, why couldn’t Jesse?
“Did you at least get what you needed out of that?”
Jesse smiles. “Only cause I’m curious about this bunker you live in.”
“That doesn’t stop me from worrying.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ok, I got it. Don’t worry we’ll have Gabe to watch out for us.”
“No,” Chuck grunts as he stumbles back, his eyes closed.
~~~~~~~~~~
“No.” He whispers. “But I do.” He shoots to his feet and blasts his father back with all the power he has.
Dean nods. “Remember, don’t fuck it up. This is the only chance you get.”
As the three continue to hit Chuck with all they have, the Impala skids up next to the fight. Sam and Dean jump out followed by Rowena.
“How’s being alive again Balth?” Dean asks.
Benny sighs and smiles. “Thank you, Cass.” He turns away when Gabe walks up to them.
“So either they killed the wrong person or it was a pack that’s targeting people in the LGBT community. Which is what’s most likely,” Sam says.
Sam stands as well, “Can’t we just send him to the Empty or something? Or Purgatory? He’s a more of a monster the anything else we’ve hunted?”
“What do you suggest you do? Enjoy all that Heaven has to offer while our family is off fighting a war that we started?”
“Maybe it’s not a Nephilim.” Bobby jumps in. “Remember that Jesse Turner kid? The ‘antichrist’? He had powers that easily rival a Nephilim. He disappeared, didn’t he? Maybe he’s back.”
“Just one last fight, then you can retire for good.”
“Hello, this is I’m Agent Halen from the church. You said you wanted to talk?”
“Neither was you blowing up your town. It wasn’t your fault Amara was released.”
“Cass!” Dean yells standing up from the dusty couch he was sitting on. “Are you okay? What happened”
“What are you doing?”
“Me too,” a dozen or so other angels say after.
“So what happens now? How do we get everyone back?” Sam chimes in.
“It’s fine. I appreciate the honesty,” Jack says weakly. “What do I have to do?”
“Of course. Um, I’m guessing that was your house that we were in before?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Okay, Jack. We think we found something that will stop this but possibly could mean you would die and couldn’t leave Heaven.” Sam says bluntly.
“Actually, not Loki, just stole his face a while back. The name’s Gabriel.”
Cass sighs in relief.
“Because Amara’s still in there,” Cass says, limping up behind Jack, “and I don’t think she deserves to die, at least before she gets a chance to explain herself.”
“Appears Dean couldn’t make it.”
“Just Jebediah. But I know there are more”
“I guess Lucifer has the Mark,” Sam says.
“We don’t know for sure that she had a role in Chuck’s escape. We need to talk to her first, get her side of the story.”
“Ya.”
“Can’t argue with you there.” Dean sighs. “But why did you never tell me?”
“I will.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You share some of your power with me.”
“I don’t think it matters what we think. It’s Jesse’s decision.”
“Heaven isn’t the same anymore. There is no leadership anymore, and we aren’t planning on having one again. No more God.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“No you were a dick,” Dean says.
“Well you know I’m not entirely comfortable with you and Cass yet but if it’ll make you happy, of course, I’ll be there.”
“Sleep,” Dean groans, rolling over so his face is buried in Cass’ stomach.
“Ya.”
“I believe it was Moriah and Atara for the most part but there were others that seemed to agree.”
“Why did you never tell us?” Dean asks.
“Well congratulations to you guys but Eileen and I are already married.”
“Did you and Carl know Cara Sanders and Margret Johnson?” Eileen asks.
Mr. Kilick sighs and wipes his eyes.
“Why does everything in my dream keep coming true?” Dean asks, groaning.
“You really think I would break a deal? What do you think I am? Some kind of monster?”
“I understand but if we keep him in Heaven, we are worried he will find a way to influence some of the more blindly loyal angels. The Earth can’t afford another civil war in Heaven.”
Cass looks at him for a moment before punching him in the face, causing Chuck to curl forward holding his now bleeding nose in his hands.
“I’ve heard so much about you.”
“He even has the hair.”
“Please give our gratitude to your colleagues,” Sam says.
“Could you get his address?”
“Let me guess, long story?”
“I mean Metatron figured it out. If that dipshit can do it, anyone can,” Dean responds.
“Fuck, I hope so. Or else I’m gonna be making some weird noises in my sleep.” Cass laughs quietly and presses his lips against Dean’s once more, pulling him even closer. Dean leans into the kiss and pushes Cass’ trench coat off his shoulders, Cass removing his hands from Dean’s back just long enough to pull it off the rest of the way.
“Hey Sam.”
Dean holds up his phone to reveal he, Cass, Sam, and Eileen had been texting instead of talking so Chuck couldn’t get any enjoyment out of it.
“Mmmmm, no. I think I’ll just stick with my plan.”
“We’re all good though, I think,” Gabe adds looking over at Jesse
“If someone tells a 16-year-old kid that they’re going to hell, there’s no way I can be respectful to them. So how about you answer the question. Unless you want to come back with us to the station and move higher up on our list of suspects.”
WOOSH
“Okay, good luck. Kick that douchbag’s ass.”
“Come on. I could feel the sexual tension from the moment I was first in the same room as you two. I deserve some details.”
Gabe spins around to face his own vessel. He suddenly feels fully awake. “Look, I know that face is quite handsome but it’s not yours to use.”
“We can help you. Please just let us take him back to the bunker and we can talk like civilized people,” Sam tries to reason.
“Um… I fell in love.”
“Ya. You’re just as much a part of this family as we are. I mean these are basically your grandparents since we kinda adopted you.” Dean adds.
“Hello Dean. Would you like some pizza?”
“Whose side is she on?”
“Okay.” Cass sighs. “Let's do this.”
“Well, the only one that they might listen to is me so I think I should go talk with them, alone.”
“Really went all out huh?”
“We need to get Jack back here now.” Sam looks up. “They’re gonna try and kill him.”
Dean smiles and presses a gentle kiss onto Cass’ lips, tears of happiness rolling down the side of his face. He feels like a breath that he’s been holding in his whole life has been released. This is the first time in all of his existence that he’s ever been entirely himself and entirely honest about how he feels.
He turns around. “Dean-o! Sasquatch! Good to see you finally decided to stay dead.”
“Is Chuck there?” Sam asks.
“Why does this keep happening?” Sam asks.
They all roll their eyes. “So why’d you attack a pastor?” Dean asks.
“No. No-,” Cass stops partway down the steps and collapses down. “I never should have let him talk me into this. It- it should have been me.” He sinks his face in his hands.
Dean snorts and everyone else stares at him. “What?! That’s funny.”
“That’s the Spark Notes version.” Dean sighs and sits back.
“Of course.”
“He’s gone,” Dean’s voice wavering, “He sacrificed himself. So even if our only plan is a longshot, we need to carry on fighting.”
“After I sensed all the wardings on the walls in this place I researched the facility and found out it is one of many similar bunkers across America. So I’ve been in one in Nevada until a few days ago when I sensed a massive exertion of power and then felt nothing. Right after I left the bunker a few hours ago, Michael and Jack found me and filled me in on what happened.”
“Me too.”
“But if you go to the Empty and they won’t help or release you, we have no way to get you out,” Jack points out.
“What happened?” Sam stands from the table as Dean rushes over to them.
“Ya let me just write them down for you,” Jake turns and walks into his house. He returns after a moment with a piece of paper, handing it to Eileen.
“Did- did they do it?” Eileen asks hesitantly.
Sam chokes on his sandwich as Dean bursts out laughing and falls on his back, covering his face. “TMI dude,” he groans and grits his teeth, burying his head in Eileen’s shoulder “TMI.”
“Maybe not. Maybe he would have let the Earth be and make another universe to start over on.”
“You had more in common with him and he trusted you in the end.”
“You’re sure? No more revivals after this.”
“Okay, good luck,” Jack places his hand on her shoulder and she disappears.
Sam was alone.
“Well even though he’s got a dork of a dad, at least he’s got a cool name.”
“I said Chuck is gone.”
“Oh this is surely a trap,” Cass says. “I don’t know how they knew we were coming but they definitely did.”
“See ya, Chuck,” Dean says, going to open the door.
“Cass we shouldn’t have done it. Now all they have to do is kill all the angels that I gave the power to and Chuck gets his powers back. And as each of them are killed he gets some power back making it even easier for him to kill the rest.”
“You tried to kill us!” Sam responds.
“Who you callin’ old? You’re like a billion years old. Literally.”
“Well, Ash and Charlie are on it. I’m sure they’ll find something.”
“Micah, were Cara and Maggie LGBT?” Eileen asks
“Well it all depends on what happens with Chuck and Jebediah and…”
WOOSH
“Thank you, Jake. We’re very sorry for your loss.”
“Wait she’s still in there?”
“You don’t have genes.”
~~~~~~~~~~
This is gonna be a fun car ride, Dean sends on the group chat.
“Are these really necessary?” Lucifer holds up his restrained hands as they walk through the white halls of Heaven.
“Wait Gabe, where do reapers go when they’re not, ya know, reaping?”
With that Dean and John walk back in slightly awkwardly. Sam gives Dean a questioning look and Dean just smiles faintly and nods. Sam returns the smile and clears his throat. “Ok let’s get down to business.”
“They’re right.”
~~~~~~~~~~
The two couples sit at the table in Sam and Eileen’s new home. Miracle curled up at Dean’s feet. “So Cass,” Sam begins, “how exactly does everything work here? Why do we all look 40? How do you, ya know, get around? et cetera.”
“Do you want to just go get them? Fill them in before you come back.”
“Hi, Rowena,” Sam says as she pulls him down for a hug.
“Michael.” Chuck says monotonously with annoyance in his voice.
“Ok guys,” Michael chimes in hesitantly. “I guess I’m in, IF and only if we find this Jesse and make an actual plan to take on Chuck. Not a guns blazing, hope for the best Winchester plan.”
Sam walks up and gives Cass a hug, “How are you man? I think you’ve died more times than I have now."
“How do you know?”
The Shadow sighs heavily. “If I do this, Jack and I, we’re even, no more favors. None of them can come back to bother me. ”
“Well there’s a whisper and nachzehrer but they are both known to drain blood in addition to consuming hearts,” Cass explains. “Plus whispers only feed during solar eclipses so that completely rules them out.”
“So far I don’t see how this is helpful.”
“He didn’t. And he never will. Because he’s dead. And unlike the one in this dream world you created, he’s not coming back. Because if he was, he would have come down to heal you by now.”
“Probably because the human mind is complex enough to analyze probabilities and accurately predict what is likely to happen, even subconsciously,” Cass says.
“I know.”
“Jesse, you don’t really want that,” Sam says. “You’re special, don’t give that up.”
“What is with you people?!”
“Jesse!” Jack yells.
“You too angel,” Dean says, shoving a burger in front of Cass as he sits down next to him with a burger of his own.
“I guess that’s for God to decide.”
“I’ll come with you.” Dean groans as he sits up from Cass’ lap, giving him a quick kiss before he fully stands up.
“Okay putting aside the son of Lucifer thing for now. Could- could he remove mine?”
“Thank you, Sam. I hope you find Heaven to be to your liking. Eileen will be waiting for you when you are ready.”
“I didn’t even know who Chuck was until like a minute ago.”
“Nail in the wall.”
“No, last time Dean chose to spare you, but I had a feeling that decision would come back to bite us in the butts so what makes you think I would make the same mistake again.”
“Dean! Cass! You did it!?”
“Ya, but it’s not like we know anything different,” Sam responds.
“Come on. We skipped Christmas cause we were on the road. Let’s celebrate! We deserve it. I already called Jodi, Donna, and the girls. Jack, Gabe, and Balthazar might stop by too.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“If that’s true, then what’s stopping us from just killing you two and your mother? Did you think that through?”
“Your life for your mother’s.”
“But if she merged with Chuck then how could she be causing trouble?”
“So what’s goin’ on? Why do you have Chuck?”
“Do I look defeated to you? Na, they just delayed their defeat a couple of decades. Do you know how minuscule that is to someone my age?”
~~~~~~~~~~
Dean sits on the dock of the pond outside Bobby’s house. He desperately needs to talk to the real Bobby right now. The one that would call him an idjit and a coward for giving up like this but it’s hard to get someone to talk you out of something when everything is happening inside your head. Part of him wishes he would just die already so that Sam could start to move on. But there’s still a tiny annoying part of him that wants to hold onto this for a little bit longer.
Cass looks down at his feet and doesn’t respond.
“I don’t think I’m ever gonna get used to this.”
WOOSH
“I guess I never told you that, did I?”
“Whatever, sure.” Dean takes a slice and devours it, suddenly realizing how hungry he was.
“Back at ya, Angel.”
“Ya. You just have to get to know him and I’m sure you’ll get along great. But, really,” Dean gets more assertive as John just stares at him, emotionless, “it doesn’t matter what you think because he’s the only person I’ve ever truly loved in this way and-“	“Dean.” John cuts him off. “It isn’t what I imagined for you and I’m definitely not comfortable with that lifestyle but I’m not going to tell you what to do. Because you’re an adult that has been through hell and you deserve to be happy.”
“Wow, that’s amazing.”
“Wait what! Amara? What else did they say about her?”
“Ya, I got that. Go to the front door. We’re right behind you!”
“Wait Cass is here?”
“I’m trying to decide if Dad will be more okay with a dude or an angel the size of a skyscraper.”
“Okay, well, what we do is up to you then,” Sam sighs.
“Huh. Is there a way to distribute the power?”
“Because he’s an asshole. He has Dean. Not the grumpy one. Your guys’ Dean.”
He stumbles back and Jebediah goes after him again.
“Technically Sam does too.”
“Man I wish he would just disappear and go make another world to fuck with.”
“Rhetorical question, Angel.”
“I’m fine. Well, now I am. It was mostly the vessel that got hurt.”
“You’re finally ready to go to therapy?”
“Okay, I’ll get him.” Jack turns back to Cass. “I’ll be okay. We’ll all be okay.”
“Don’t mention it. You’re a part of Team Free Will now whether you like it or not. Food and housing’s part of the package.”
“Don’t make me stab you in the face again.”
“They’re about a mile that way, in a little cabin,” Jesse interrupts, pointing to the West.
“How?” Eileen asks. “It’s not like we can track strange occurrences or anything. He’s just human.”
“You killed me 103 times! We are so not even.”
Everyone nods in agreement.
“I want to go back, I need to go back to Cass.”
Sam doesn’t know what to do, what to say. He just looks at his brother, more broken and defeated than he has ever seen him. He sits down in despair with Jack and Dean. All three of them mourning the losses that they have endured that day.
“Pretty much,” Cass responds.
They wait until dark to strike. Not that the dark has any effect on angels or demons or anything but at night there are fewer humans wandering around the city.
“You didn’t just betray Heaven, you betrayed me.”
Cass laughs sadly. “One more fight,” he repeats. “Heard that before.”
The empty just tilted its head. When Dean turned around a crowd was in front of him. Many of them demons and angels he had killed himself. Dean sighed and turned the ring on his finger.
“Let’s move on to a happier topic,” Dean says after a moment. “We’re trying to distract ourselves here.”
“You love me.”
“I said Lucifer. Send him back. Keep me.”
“I have forgiven him of his sins and he has been cleansed but he is so drenched in guilt that I believe that he won’t heal until he feels that he deserves to be better.”
“But he failed to get them out of the picture so Jack came and helped you. He didn’t need to, he could have just gotten Cass and me and left. So you owe him and the Winchesters for that matter.”
“Does it say why?” Sam asks.
“He’s not wrong,” Eileen says.
Sam manages a small laugh. “Ya. Maybe.”
“I’ve never sung in my life."
“I already should for the way he neglected you and Sam as children,” Cass mumbles.
“And the grace thing, well, they wanted to make me stronger for the ‘upcoming fight’, I didn’t know they meant disobeying God. They extracted a portion of their Archangel grace and intertwined it with mine. It wasn’t like stolen grace where it faded quickly, this was gifted and bound to me. In a way, it made me part Archangel. No one but us knew about it of course.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Castiel, do you take Dean to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
“Dammit,” Sam says breaking the peaceful silence. “We left the cooler in the car. I’ll be right back.”
“Then I am too.”
“Anything for New-God.”
Cass, Jesse, and Gabe stand on the porch of Sam’s old house. Cass’ hand is on the doorknob hesitantly.
“You have to become fully human then confess your sins to a priest. Then the curse will be lifted and you will either die or heal. The book wasn’t very clear.”
“Of course you don’t.” Cass turns to the group of angels in front of them. “Okay, everyone! I know there has been a lot of change in Heaven recently and that this is a lot to ask but if you know anything about Chuck then you know he cannot become God again. If you are willing to fight, we need you.”
“You really didn’t think I would let you get away with saying that and immediately leaving did you?” Tears welled up in his eyes and a lump formed in his throat. “Cass I…”
“No, we can’t have any of that. You might realize that you are way too good for me.”
There’s much more space in this room than in his apartment, especially without all the books. He left most of his stuff in his car or in his old apartment for the landlord to deal with. He brought some of the books that he found helpful or interesting, the few pieces of clothing he owns, his shitty TV, his toiletries, and Lucy of course (she was busy wandering around the bunker with Miracle, Dean was right about them getting along) But that was pretty much it. He didn’t have any belongings that he was emotionally attached to. Any furniture he has had he’s picked up at garage sales once he got to a new place or they came with the apartment.
Sam laughs. “The movie had a good point though. No matter how much Chuck manipulates things, he can’t control everything. And he is done controlling us. We will win this, because we will make it happen. Then we will get our family back and live our lives how we were meant to. Free and together.”
He walks over to the bed and plops down on it, laying back and looking up at the ceiling. Before he can sit up and actually put his stuff away, Dean sticks his head in.
“I don’t see anything. Are you sure this is where they are?”
“Understandable. And how did a hunter make it to old age?”
“Hahaha ya… good times. I’m guessing you’re here for your boy toy Castiel. But let me tell you, he doesn’t want to see you, let alone leave with you.”
“Are you okay, Cass?” Jack asks as they open the bunker door.
Dean hesitates, not even wanting the fake Cass to worry. “Because we want to do it before Lucifer finds a way to fuck everything up.” Not that Dean is going to let that happen. Now that he knows that all of this is in his head, he’s gonna be in full control.
“Think about why the angel is there in the first place.”
Cass and Dean lay in the grass facing each other, their legs intertwined. Cass’ arm is draped over Dean’s waist, Dean’s hand gently stroking the back of Cass’ neck. “Why did this take us so long?” Dean whispers.
“Pretty much.” Jesse sighs.
“Well, he doesn’t exactly have a soul so he didn’t so much get into heaven as he just died and we need to figure out a place to put him. But I don’t think any side really wants him.” Jack explains.
Dean presses his face into his hands. “I’m sorry, Cass. I’m not mad at you for anything. It’s just... when you were gone, I-, it destroyed me. I thought I would never get the chance to say it back and now, you’re here and I don’t know whether to punch you or kiss you.”
“You go on with your life,” Dean says. Everyone looks at him. “But if you do anything out of line, we will find you.”
“Amazing. One of the best nights of my life.”
Jack sits in the kitchen chair of Sam and Eileen’s house, exhausted and drained, literally.
“Geez. I’ve never seen this part of Heaven before. It’s so… white.”
Cass sighs. “Ok Jesse, you’re going to Heaven.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful! Those boys have been pining for each other for years. Tell them ‘congrats’ for me. So, Jack can get people out of the Empty?”
“Okay,” Gabe says to the Shadow. “Send us back.”
“Oh.”
Cass looks over at Dean, who hasn’t breathed since the conversation started, and smiles. He then turns to Mary. “It’s really great to see you again Mary.”
“Believe me, I’ve heard some crazy stuff.”
“God is never wrong.”
Everything goes black.
“No, there’s no way. Jesse’s a good kid. He wouldn’t be doing this without someone at least influencing him.”
The reaper looks at him and nods with a small smile, giving him permission to finish before he has to go. Dean nods back, this is it, but he puts that thought out of his mind.
Sam smiles and chuckles. Happy to see his brother so at ease. He glances over at Eileen who looks almost as happy at Dean as she looks around the festive bunker. “I’ve never really celebrated New Year’s before,” she signs at Sam.
“Can you just quit it with the names? I know what I am. You don’t have to keep reminding me.”
“He in jail.”
Sam laughs and taps Eileen on the shoulder as she drives. She turns to look at him. “Dean says he’s a feminist.” He signs and says. Over the phone, they hear Eileen laugh.
“I’m sorry. I just don’t have another vessel.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Even if his decision leads to mass murder?”
“Better to be safe though. If they have Death on their side, witches, and who knows how many angels and reapers, we can’t underestimate them.” Eileen adds.
“I don’t want to be special!” Jesse stands up and paces around the room. “I just want to have a normal life and be a stupidly normal 22-year-old without having to worry about accidentally killing everyone.” No one knows how to respond. “Please Castiel. You owe me this. Let me at least talk to him.”
“Just God.”
“I just need to make sure he’s okay. I feel like we abandoned him,” Dean explains. Cass signs what Dean says for Eileen.
“So how was your first New Years' celebration?” Sam signs to Eileen as they get in bed.
“Great. Another fight with Death. That totally didn’t end badly last time.” Dean groans.
“I still am God. No little kid can take that title away from me.”
“You don’t. You just go out every day and do the best you can.”
“Cold.”
“Because if you don’t, all of Heaven’s angels, including 9 with some of your power, will smite this bunker and everyone in it.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Eileen nods sleepily.
Jack sighs, “Chuck died as a human so we put him in Heaven’s prison. We were going to transfer him to the cage in Hell but someone broke him out and now he’s missing. Somehow I am being blocked from seeing who it was and what happened.”
“Inside joke.”
“There’s Google in Heaven?” Sam asks.
Gabe nods. “They need him more than they need me. Besides, I’ve gotten enough chances at life. At least this time my death’ll mean something to the world.”
“Hiya Gabe.”
“No way. My mind was just making shit up.” Dean wonders whether he should tell them about his mind torturing Jack with the flaming sword shit. He decides against it for Cass’ sake. “So what has Jack actually done in Heaven?”
Eileen smiles and gulps back tears before beginning her vows. “Sam, I have loved you ever since you tried to use sign language with me all those years ago. Even though I thought you were a banshee, no one had ever made an effort with me before and that made me fall fast and hard. You became my family when I had none and for that, I will be forever grateful. Not to mention you brought me back to life twice so I guess I should be grateful for that too.” She laughs along with Sam. “Our son was so lucky to have you as a father. I love you, Sam.”
“No. I was still in denial when she was with us. We didn’t really get together until recently even though I’ve been in love with him for like a decade. He told me how he felt right before he sacrificed himself to save me. I was able to tell him I felt the same way once I died, came here and found out Jack brought him back.”
They turn away from Moriah. “So dead end.”
“Where have you been?!” Sam exclaims. “I’ve been praying to you for weeks.”
“I’ve missed you so much. You should see our son. He grew more and more like you each day.” He said once his face was visible enough for her to be able to read his lips.
“You boys outgrew the small stuff a long time ago.”
“Wow.” Sam sits down, “I can’t believe you’ve been on your own for all these years.”
“Because I know you aren’t really on his side, you’re on your own side, which means you will always choose the winning side and take the path best for you. And when we lock him away, you’ll be free.”
“Why is that?” Comes a grumpy voice from behind him.
“Ooohhhh honey. Castiel isn’t going anywhere. We had a deal and now they are mine.”
“With a forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.”
“Why not?”
“Ya, but I wasn’t there so it doesn’t count.”
“Of course. Goodbye boys.”
Jesse nods.
“Thanks, Mom. Dad? Are you in?”
“Hades! How you doin’ bro?”
“Okay.” Cass gulps. “You’re going to be better soon.”
Jack smiles sadly before responding. “Come with me.” He touches Jesse on the shoulder and the two of them disappear.
“What?”
“Thanks for your overwhelming confidence in our abilities,” Dean says sarcastically.
“I should have come back. If I had Dean wouldn’t have died. Sam wouldn’t have had to go through the rest of his life without his brother.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Chuck really is the worst
“What about them?”
With the final cord, they bow and walk back towards the table, both grabbing some food. “You’re up Angel,” Dean says with a mouth full of food.
“I’m gonna be belting out some of your least favorite songs regardless,” Dean says.
“Awesome. Ash was thinking we should find a way for Jack to expel power into people not for others to suck it out of him.”
“Mom, Dad, this is Eileen, my wife.”
“I don’t know. What do normal people even do?”
“Jesse’s off looking for Chuck with Gabe and for all we know, Jebediah wasn’t even aware that it was the flaming sword that he was using.”
“Just the ones that we trust. They’re not all bad.”
“Awesome.”
Cass sighs and lays his head on Dean’s shoulder, closing his eyes in defeat. “That’s not possible.”
“Hey.” Cass interrupts. “Don’t think about that right now. We’ll sort it out. It isn’t entirely up to you to fix anymore.”
“It’s been 10 minutes on Earth. It could have been a trap all along and we just sent him right into it powered down.”
“Me neither,” Sam responds.
“Thanks.”
“Man our life’s weird. I can’t believe that plan actually worked.”
“Guess what?”
“Oh you know, here and there.”
“There’s no way to track him,” Cass says. “Or else we would have gotten his help to fight Chuck.”
Jesse runs his hand over his face and sighs. “I appreciate it but your offer is about five years too late.”
“You don’t have to have that responsibility. God isn’t the villain you make him out to be. We can help you if you let us.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“We’re in Heaven. The one I recently renovated.”
“Like you were any better. Umm killing you was pretty much my last order from Heaven that I tried to follow. After that I tried to fix things but made them worse then more shit went down.”
“Me too.” Sam goes with her.
“You okay.”
“Not helpful,” Cass mutters before turning back to the group. “We also have all the demons in Hell thanks to Rowena, and Jack is working on getting some people from Purgatory.”
“They were just flawed, broken toys. It needs to be redone in a better way. Wiped out to create a clean slate for my new creations. One's that aren't as boring and... idiotic. ”
On the other side of them is Gabe and Balthazar, doing the Macarena, which does not fit the song at all but they’re having fun with it anyway.
“Why Castiel, whatever happened to your grace?”
“Well ya but it’ll be fun. More ceremonial than legal. Sam and Eileen are doing it too. That way you guys can see both your sons get married.”
“I can’t leave this vessel now that my powers are gone so it makes sense that both Chuck and Amara were trapped in Chuck’s vessel when Jack absorbed their power.”
Sam sighs. “Okay.”
Cass sighs. “We have to remove your grace then you have to confess.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Bobby asks Cass. “If you got stabbed by this thing it could have affected more than just your vessel.”
“Jack. Didn’t the Winchesters teach you that family needs to stick together?”
——————————————————————
“It means I need to go out on my own again.” The others nod sadly but understandingly. “But I’m gonna stay close, I’ve grown fond of Kansas. Plus I’m gonna need a nice home-cooked meal every once in a while.”
“Jack?” Dean whispers.
“Dean, what did we just talk about.”
“Uh sure. Let me just go let Eileen know what’s going on.” Sam says as he turns and heads next door.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Little bit of both. Maybe take the next few months to relax like I always wanted. All of us on the beach with our toes in the sand, sippin’ on some fancy drinks with tiny little umbrellas. Then maybe I’ll get a job as a mechanic or something for a while, earn an honest living. What about you?”
“How many others did you bring back from the empty?” Cass asks.
“I can’t even go to Earth to save my own son.” Sam’s head is buried in his hands. Eileen is sitting next to him staring at her feet numbly.
Sam sighs and sits in the chair next to Dean’s bed, “Dean we need a plan.”
“Fuck off,” Dean laughs, shoving Sam to the side.
“It’s me,” come’s Amara using Chuck’s voice. “But he’s still screaming in here. And I might not be able to stay in control for long.”
Sam was silent for a second before he snapped. “You complete dumb ass!”
“True, I mean this might just be problem solved,” Sam says.
“I don’t even know these Winchesters, all I’ve ever seen of them is the memories I used to torture Castiel. Why would I owe them?”
“What was your name before they gave it to you?”
“But you know it’s time to wake up,” Cassie says.
“Quite nice. The Empty was very boring if I’m being honest. Terrible conversationalist.”
Jack closes his eyes and laughs. “I would say that they are doing more than just catching up. I’m not sure you want to know the details.”
Dean looks up at Bobby and smiles. “Thanks, Bobby,” he then gets up and starts walking off the dock.
“Are you sure that was a good idea?” Dean asks.
“Which is?”
“I’m glad I’m not seeing that,” Dean says.
“Remember Tessa?”
“What? You can’t blame me for being curious.” Cass rolls his eyes. “So, what’s he like?”
“Okay let’s try this again. Ol gift yls oi lansh.” Jack places his hand on Cass’ and more orange energy leaves Jack for Cass.
“Well, that’s not good. Dad doesn’t exactly like to create peace wherever he goes.”
Lucifer rolls his eyes, “we should probably get them out here first unless you want us all to get sucked in instead.”
“Yes. Yes it is,” Gabe responds.
“Well I killed Loki, so it’s mine now.”
“I had it removed so that I could be human.”
Woosh
“And if every shitty thing that has ever happened to us has led us to knowing or having known these people, then it was all worth it.”
“No. And why would anyone want Canada?”
“Okay, subject change!” Charlie claps her hands together. “When’s the double wedding?”
“Mmmm… yes we do. But Castiel stays here until everyone is returned and asleep and …Castiel goes back as a human, I keep his grace. I never want to see either of you again.”
“Not. An. Option.”
No one responds.
“Because that would be too easy.”
“Fine. I was just sitting in my apartment in Belize about a week ago when two angels just appeared. It was pretty obvious that they didn’t just want to chat. All they said is that if I didn’t do everything they said without question that my family would be cast out of Heaven and be tortured in Hell for eternity. It’s not like they asked me to kill anyone or anything so I just did what they told me. But when I tried to leave they chained me up in some underground bunker and said I needed to ‘await further instruction’. By that point, it was pretty clear that they had no control over who is in Heaven or else they would have had more manpower and they wouldn’t have needed me to help break someone out of Heaven’s prison. But just when I was about to snap, kill that bitch holding me there and leave, Jack and Cass showed up.”
“I mean I thought he was gonna try when I told him about Cass. If he didn’t beat my ass then, I don’t think I’ll happen any time soon.”
“Ready to go too?” Sam signs.
“I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad thing.”
“You’re the one who needs to get sleep,” Sam responds.
“Well, you ain’t in charge anymore.”
“That’s wonderful, Jack.” Cass gleams with pride. “Ready to do this?”
“Would you please give us a copy of that footage and the phone number of your coworker?” Eileen asks.
“Time works differently here. Your life on earth was just a few moments for Dean here and a few months for me. I’ve been busy creating this for you and Dean. I wanted it to be perfect.”
“Ok, subject change. We should start at Chuck’s cell and see if there’s anything Jack missed.”
Sam laughs before saying, “Of course I do.” He slips a silver ring on Eileen’s finger.
“You didn’t follow me.”
“I don’t think that’s an option anymore.” Dean points to the reaper approaching behind them.
“You’re going to tell him yourself. After this is all over. We’re going to find a way for you to get to Heaven like you deserve.”
“That happened decades ago. What does it have to do with our current problem?”
“So what should we do now?” Hannah asks.
“Asleep. Everyone in the Empty had woken up when I exploded but it’s all good now.”
“You mean on…”
“Dean?” Sam says louder, tapping his brother on the shoulder.
“I read lips, stupid.”
“Probably a little bit of both.”
The wind is blowing people’s belongings out of their hands they run through the streets. It’s just like he remembers it was. The same panicked atmosphere with a darkness looming over the city from the presence of Death with a capital “D”.
“Cass!” Dean yells standing in an empty field. He falls to his knees and begins to speak quieter “Please, I need to see you. I’m an idiot and a coward. I’ve been afraid of being who I am my whole life but I’m not afraid now.”
Bobby nods. “So whatcha got goin’ on in that noggin of yours?”
“Perhaps. One condition.”
“Of course. Once a hunter, always a hunter. I have to say though, it’s really weird to see my father’s body as younger than me.”
For once Gabe doesn’t know what to say.
Dean pulls back and places a kiss on Cass’ lips before turning away.
“Ya… I do.”
“He went to find his parents. I think he’ll be fine with the mark. He’s strong.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“What the hell are they doing there?”
“That’s because I was cast out of Heaven a long time ago.”
“Agnes,” Rowena says shakily. “She wrote the Book of the Damned.”
Before anyone can do anything, Jack pops into the front middle seat. “Hello!”
“Why was that?” Eileen asks.
“I know. He can never take this away.” Dean says pulling Cass closer to him. “Even if he did manipulate some things, he didn’t make me fall in love with you. That was all your doing.”
“I wouldn’t let him,” Cass says bluntly.
“Ya, that’s one way to put it. Wait, you said retiring.” Dean interjects. “How do you retire from being an angel?”
Sam looks at his older brother with more admiration than he ever has. Even with how broken he is right now, Dean still has fight in him. “We WILL get him back Dean. Chuck won’t win.”
Dean shoots out of his seat and runs down the steps towards the sound. The others follow behind him. He stops before he reaches the survivors, not seeing Cass among the small group of remaining angels.
“Ya, I’m fine. Cass? How do you feel?”
“I hope you’re right.”
“Hm.”
“What do we do now?” Sam asks after a moment.
“What? Didn’t think I could commit to one person for eternity?”
“We never should have let him go free in the first place,” Dean groans. “This whole thing was probably a part of his plan or something.”
Jack snapped his fingers and they were gone.
“Jack.” Cass says
“You could say that.”
“Are you sure you don’t just want to let me kill you and your superpowered angels?” Chuck says to Jack and Cass in a demeaning fake sympathetic voice from across the cemetery. “It would save a lot of lives.”
“Of course. Edward was a kind boy. I knew him back when he was Jennifer but our church isn’t exactly friendly towards people like him. Anything you need help with, I’m here.”
Jack, on the other hand, was not in a vessel and was still covered in blood. “I’m fine.” He says weakly.
“Sorry. There’s not really any way to teleport next to you in a non-startling way. Hello Chuck.”
“Because I’ve done too much bad.”
“Fine. What finally made you two pull your heads out of your asses.”
“Another war in heaven. I had hoped we were done with this.” Cass sighs.
“Ugh. Do I even have to tell him?”
“Leave me alone.”
“Ooooo, our?” Gabe teases. “When’s the wedding?”
WOOSH
~~~~~~~~~~
“Either way, it’s gonna be awesome.”
“Did the hunter tell you who it was that killed them?” Eileen asks.
“Didn’t expect this, huh?”
“I guess worst case, we always have our origional fate. Butch and Sundance.”
“Knowing those boys, I guarantee it.”
“Strong.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“We have God, we’ll be fine. Jack, is there anyone else with them?”
“Okay. Jebediah and Eva. Oh, and they are apparently working with a witch too.”
“That’s a lovely thing to tell a 16-year-old,” Sam grumbles. “Look asshat you got an alibi for Monday, December 28th from 4 PM to 8 PM?”
“What did you do?”
“Okay, if you think that’s best. You are the smart one.” He leans over the back of his seat to give her a kiss before they get out.
Cass smiles. “Sounds good to me.”
“Me too,” Eileen says. Sam nods, sleepily, in response.
“I guess we’re going to bed,” Cass laughs.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ya, I’m gonna leave you two alone to talk,” Sam says awkwardly, getting up from his chair and leaving the room.
Jack just stares back with anger in his eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Seems a little too easy,” Cass responds.
“We should probably get back to the bunker at some point. Jack is gonna be anxious to see you and I have to return this ring to 2010.”
“I know. I miss them a lot.”
“What?”
“Then we make another deal.”
“Hear what?”
“It was really rough at the beginning without Dean but Eileen really helped me through it once I stopped closing myself off from the rest of the world. We both decided to retire from hunting and live a fairly normal life. We had a son, hopefully, he won’t be joining us any time soon. It was… it was really nice, for a long time. But once Eileen died, I felt pretty alone again. Dean, my son, was off living his own life and I kind of felt like I was ready to go, for good this time.”
Cass looks over to where the rest of Jebediah’s group was and they are both dead on the ground with Claire and Kaya standing over them. There are similar scenes across the battlefield. Jesse and Hades stand over the pile of ash that used to be Death, her scythe in Jesse’s hand. Black goo and burnt wings cover the field. The battle is over, so where the hell is Chuck?
“No. Thank you. You should be able to do that about 9 more times before you are at the power level of an archangel.”
“You’re correct in saying ‘I’m not Sammy’ but I’m not Lucifer or Chuck. Just the part of your brain that’s telling you the truth, no matter how painful it is.”
Everyone in their 20’s (or still in single digits like Jack) laughs. Their night is just getting started.
“What are you doing here Gabriel?” Cass asks.
With a chorus of flapping wings, all of the angels of Heaven are gone and the brothers are alone once again.
“Well we’re excited for you to finally come home,” Dean says.
“How about you and Cass go talk to the other angels to see if anyone knows anything about Jebediah’s plans. Jesse, tell Dean everything that you can think of about what has happened since they found you, maybe he’ll notice something I didn’t. I’m going to go see Rowena to ask about the witch and the spell and see where that takes me.”
“Hey,” Dean says defensively. “You have no idea what we’ve been through. We deserve to be gross.”
“We aren’t your TV show anymore Chuck. You aren’t God anymore. And you never will be again.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Rowena, could you figure out how to do it?” Jack asks.
“So if we undid the spell that Rowena used to remove the mark from me, would we be able to reseal the cage?”
“No. Do you?”
“And now there’s a group that’s trying to reinstate ‘Chuck’ as God and you need everyone’s help to stop them.”
“What are you talking about Sam?”
Dean pulls the flask out of his pocket and hands it to Jack. He looks up at Cass before he hesitantly opens the top. A blue stream of light floats out the top and into Jack’s mouth. His eyes glow his classic orange as his wings create a shadow behind him from the light coming off his body.
“We should be helping.”
“I’ll leave you guys to catch up,” Jack says as he turns to leave.
“Then why hasn’t anyone popped back in to update us? It’s been forever.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Dean’s phone rings and he picks up. “Hey, how’s the case going.”
“Why’s that?” Cass asks.
“No. No, he can’t be. You’re lying, this is real, this has to be real. You’re not Sammy. You’re Lucifer or, or Chuck or something.”
The music stops and Bobby clears his throat. “We’re gathered here today to witness the unions between Sam Winchester and Eileen Leahy, and Dean Winchester and Castiel. Both of these couples have been through life and death, bad times and good. They’ve fought God himself together. And yet they are still here standing before you today. Their love has literally saved the world on multiple occasions. I’ve known both of these boys,” Bobby gestures at Sam and Dean “since, well, it’s been a long time. And I have never seen them happier than they are now. Eileen, Cass, thank you for giving my boys light in the dark life that the universe chose for them.” Cass and Eileen smile widely. “Now, you may recite your vows. Sam, you may start.”
“It’s always an option,” Cassie says, spinning around and twisting the reaper’s arm behind his back, preventing him from getting close enough to touch Dean.
“Well, then I think it was a piece of the Flaming Sword.”
“Cass, you need to focus on Chuck.”
“Oh, um I do.” He slides a gold ring on Cass’ finger, smiling.
Dean is in the driver’s seat of the Impala with Sam sleeping in the seat next to him. Cass and Eileen are doing the same in the back. Traveling Riverside Blues is playing quietly out of the speakers, the tape spinning in the tape deck. Sam tried to get Dean to take a turn sleeping but he refused.
“No, just that they were a part of the church. So if the last hunter got the original killer, this one would probably have been close to that person,” Sam explains.
“Stubborn idiots.” She laughs and smiles at Sam. “So what about you honey. Did you get to settle down?”
“So, what took you two so long to come and see us?” John asks. “Didn’t you boys get here a while ago?”
“That's,” Cass stutters. “That’s not possible.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Or it was all a part of Chuck’s plan in some way.”
“Dean, what’s she talking about?” Cass asks.
“Great. Another fight with Death. Cause that ended so well last time.”
“I’ll come,” Cass responds. “You can’t go by yourself.”
Sam takes a deep breath. “Ya. You did. But you had no soul. And you lost your soul because you saved us all. It wasn’t your fault. Believe me, I know what not having a soul can do to a person. And I did much worse when I was in your shoes.”
“I really need to find Cass.”
“Well, ya.”
“Night guys!” Jodi responds.
“Awesome.”
They begin the fight once more. Sam and Rowena continue the spell, unlocking the cage. A gaping black hole opens up in the field as Sam and Dean get flashbacks to their fight with Lucifer all those years before. Amara forces Chuck to the edge of the cage, with him fighting tooth and nail against her control. With a final blow from the combined force of Michael, Jesse and Jack, Amara is able to throw herself and Chuck into the pit. The hole closing up behind them with a force that shakes the whole planet as the mark transfers itself to Jesse. Jack and Michael collapse in exhaustion, their graces faded from the exertion of power. Jesse falls to the ground as the mark gets burned onto his arm.
“Ya ya ya whatever, will you marry me?”
Jesse laughs.
“I feel like that’s what we said about 2019.”
Jack nods. “She said if we can get the prison that she was trapped in open, she can get them both in.”
“Thanks, Dad,” Sam says
“Well if he saved you, then he’s already getting on my good side.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I’m not invincible, I know that. But that’s the difference between me and Chuck. I have weaknesses, you guys. But somehow those weaknesses are what make me stronger than he ever was. So I may not be invincible but unlike Chuck, I have something to fight for and that’s why he doesn’t stand a chance.”
“Well, long story short, they won, temporarily. The battle went down like 40 years ago. Jack took Dad’s powers and ‘God’ became human. Then Jack fixed Heaven, Dean died on a hunt and Sam lived out his life then went to heaven, Dean banged Cass, finally, Chuck died and was put in Heaven’s jail, then he was broken out by a rogue group of angels and reapers, he got an army together and took back a portion of his power, that’s a long story for another time. Now Amara is fighting him for control of the vessel and we have a shot of locking them both away with Amara’s help. The only problem is that we thought that the Mark was the only thing we need, but it’s not, it’s just the key, and, sadly, you’re the lock. If we’re going to open the cage on Earth, we need both you and the Mark, together.”
“I- I don’t know. It just says ‘the pain will cease’.”
“Will you?”
“They’re using cambion’s, reapers, and witches to try and reinstate a sociopath as God?”
Dean sticks his tongue out with food in his mouth.
“Thanks, Rowena. And in Dean’s case, I’m kind of thinking him dying wasn’t so bad on his end. He and Cass finally pulled their heads out of the sand and admitted how they felt about each other. I don’t think Cass would have had the guts to come back down the Earth after admitting how he felt and Dean had no idea that Jack had gotten Cass out of the Empty. So I don’t think he ever could have moved on with his life without Cass.”
“Just like how it did when he was just focusing on you, without anyone dictating the average person’s life. Only this time everyone will be free from his control on the apocalyptic events of the world.”
“Oh please. You think that because you got a defective, broken angel to follow you around like a pathetic little puppy dog that you won.” Dean takes a defensive step forward but Cass holds him back.
“Touche.”
“If you hurt us or my mom then there is an army of powered-up angels waiting in Heaven to attack if I do not return or send word within the hour. And I am not leaving without my mother and Rowena.”
“You doing okay Cass?” Jack asks quietly.
“Bitch.”
“No, I’m sorry. We had a plan and I didn’t stick to it. I was wrong. I- I didn’t fully understand the depths of my brother’s evil until after.”
No one in the room knows how to respond to that. Sam just looks down at his feet and Dean grabs Cass’ hand.
“So what do you expect us to do here?” Cass asks.
Both Sam and Dean feel their eyes getting heavy. No more anxiety or fear-induced insomnia that once allowed them to stay up for days on end to work a case, avoid the nightmares or, ya know, fight God.
“I’m sorry but I don’t think he’s in this universe. He died in apocalypse world so he would have ended up in their ‘empty’, which was destroyed by Chuck when he was erasing worlds. I really am sorry. He deserved to go to a better place.”
Cass laughs as they break apart.
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
Eileen smiles smugly at Sam.
“Is there anything else that has kills similar to a werewolf?” Jesse asks.
“Fun.”
“What do you mean.”
“What would you have me do then.”
“No thank you.”
“Well Death can enter the empty and retrieve the dead, but our Death was taken, along with the ring.”
“But you’re already a god. Why do you need more power?”
Cass and Gabe follow behind him. Sam, Eileen, and Jesse run up and meet them in the driveway.
“You love me.”
“Is that a yes or no on the pizza?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“The Flaming Sword was given to a Cherub to guard the Garden after Adam and Eve were banished. Then it was removed after the messiah was resurrected. It’s been missing ever since. Well, I guess until now.”
“Ya, she’s running Hell like a well-oiled machine. She’s definitely fit for queen, that’s for sure. She wants you two to visit her at some point. She says congrats on finally getting together by the way.”
“Okay then,” Jesse laughs.
“What?!”
“Cause I don’t have Chuck’s powers anymore. No one does.”
“I mean after this it’ll be over, right?” Jo asks.
“Party’s about to end,” Dean jokes. “Midnight’s in 12 minutes.”
“No, but if his arm is ripped from his body, can he use the mark?”
“Are you sure this is the only way?” Sam asks, looking over Rowena’s shoulder at a book in front of her.
“I went overseas. You guys don’t tend to leave America and you also cause the majority of supernatural trouble so it was much quieter over there. Didn’t see any angels until like a week ago”
“Chuck punched a pastor and got arrested,” Cass explains.
“Well you already did the first one,” Sam says. “And if someone would fill me in, I could tell you whether the other one is justified.”
“Okay, I guess. Dean? Are you onboard.”
It’s 7:25 AM now and everyone in the car is awake. Sam is behind the wheel now. He managed to convince Dean to get an hour or so of sleep after he took over. They have around 2 more hours left in their drive.
“They weren’t the same Cassiel I used to know. I lost them a long time ago.”
“Jerk.”
“Wait, what do you mean you can’t anymore?”
A few angels come out carrying Castiel by his arms, legs dragging on the ground. His head falling forward. “Cass!” Dean runs up to him but is stopped by a the empty appearing in front of him.
~~~~~~~~~~
“I’m so proud of you, Jack,” Cass says smiling.
“Fine. You okay with this Jack?”
“Don’t you have, like, heaven surveillance or something? Security cameras?”
“So how do I start this out?” Jack asks weakly.
“It isn’t so bad. In all honestly, things don’t feel all that different. At least this way I can actually make a difference in the world.”
“No,” Cass responds. “You need to go back to Heaven. If something happens to us, you need to be okay.”
Jack looks down and smiles.
Dean gets in the impala and drives away.
They all look at each other before Sam speaks up. “Okay, family meeting.”
“Will do. How are things going there? Jesse settling in okay?”
“Jack, come on.” Cass shakes his shoulder. “You can’t die in Heaven.”
“What I had to. I’m sorry.”
“About that, if you two were so close,” Dean starts, “why didn’t you fall with them?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I knew asking you for help would backfire.”
“And it’s our responsibility to lock up a dangerous person.”
“Oh, so I was supposed to betray Heaven.”
Heaven shakes and gets momentarily dark once again. But in a different way this time. It feels calmer and brighter after. Like a weight has been lifted off the universe.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Mom,” Dean whispers as he pulls her in for a hug. “We’ve missed you. So much has happened. I’m so sorry.”
“But it’s not miserable. They’re happy. You just can’t stand that they fixed the planet without you. They don’t need you anymore, Brother. It’s time to move on.”
“And how, exactly, are you going to do that for me.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Jack starts to stir a few minutes later. This time with just Dean sitting beside him. Cass, Eileen, and Sam are in the other room trying to find a cure.
“Well I have had an interest in men but with how I was raised and how my Dad felt about ‘queers' I just never acted on it. I guess I was ashamed. By the time I was more comfortable with that side of myself I was just too in love with you to be with any other guy so I just, you know, kept hooking up with women to push those feelings down. I didn’t think that angels could feel that way about someone so I never thought a relationship with you was possible.”
Amara suddenly inhales. “Go!” Their eyes glow blue.
“Whatever ya gotta tell yourself, man.”
“Absolutely nothing,” Jebediah says. “You will go back to Heaven and stay there until you are contacted.”
“Hiya father, how ya doin’?” Dean asks as the man and Cass enter the room.
Jesse nods as Sam heads up the hall towards his and Eileen’s room.
“Castiel,” Cassiel says turning towards Cass. “I think we should go somewhere and chat.” They place their arm on Cass’ shoulder and they disappear.
“Hey, we won in that right?” Sam says, trying to be optimistic. “We’ll win here too.”
“Not everyone.”
“Ya, but I never did… this.”
Cass looks at Jack and smiles. “How about an archangel?”
She turns and yells, “Jerry! There are some people here for you!”
“I’m fine.”
“Oh look, it’s my grandpa who killed me.”
“So you weren’t ignoring my prayers?”
Sam shoots upright. “I’m going to murder you.” He hangs up the phone.
“What are we even going to do if we find him?” Cass asks. “He ran away for a reason, he might not be too happy to see us.”
“Cass, I’m literally God.”
“That’s probably a good thing,” Sam laughs.
She sighs. “I wrote it in my diary. It’s mostly for helping me think things through and work out problems. One day I came home and Carl was reading it. We got into an argument about how I was encouraging ‘sin’.”
“Jack?” Cass stands. “What's wrong?”
“Really Jack, I’m fine, I promise. Everything worked out.”
“Seems like you did that anyway. For a lesser cause I presume.”
“Okay,” Cass interrupts, “I remember. Let’s go. We got a lot of people to move.”
“It could go either way.”
WOOSH
“How?” Dean asks.
“Thank you, Hades.”
Cass shakes his hand. “I’ve heard so much about you. It’s wonderful to finally meet you.”
Dean presses his face into Cass’ shoulder. “Did it work?”
“He isn’t breathing.” Sam stutters.
“Isn’t there a way for me to come with you?” Sam asks.
“That was very brave of both of you and I’m sorry that happened,” Sam says.
“Eddie’s was, transgender. We grew up going to the Christian Church in town and when he came out a few months ago when he turned 16, the church said he wasn’t welcome and our parents kicked him out of the house. I took him in and became his legal guardian.”
“Ok what’s gonna happen after that? How does the world function without a God?”
“We could get Charlie, Ash and Kevin to come down to help out,” Cass responds.
“But now you’re working with the angels?”
“Dang Cass, guess you got a thing for younger men huh?” Sam teases.
Dean nods hesitantly.
“Never.”
A familiar face turns back up after many years. What side are they going to be on?
“Did you figure it out?” Sam asks when they reappear back in front of him and Dean.
“I don’t think he planned on us locking him up,” Sam reassures him.
“And Chuck’s an asshole,” Dean adds.
“Shit,” Dean mutters under his breath.
“Why else would you do this?”
Sam laughs. “They’ve basically been an old married couple since they met but no, they were in denial the whole time.”
“What do you mean ‘Amara’?” Jack questions.
“Oh, we definitely are,” Cass smirks. “I mean I tried to consume Leviathans and you used your powers to get into porn.”
“But you’ve never escaped on your own before.”
“Okay, let's get to it!” Dean says over-enthusiastically, heading out of the room.
Rowena sighs. “If it would help keep you boys safe then I suppose you could use the cage. You would need to make some adjustments to it as it was created to house an archangel, not a human.”
“Hey Jack, healing at all?” Sam says as he walks into the room.
“Not anymore.” Jack smiles.
“You still have it?”
“I don’t even know what this is!”
“They don’t. This is Cassiel. They’re an archangel that fell shortly after Lucifer. They were my friend. They trained me. I even had their grace.”
“But you’re forgetting Sam, God is one with Amara again. He’s more than twice as powerful now. On top of that I am the only Archangel left. And Jack is only so powerful himself.”
“This is kinda like that faith healer case we did in ’05. The wife was making a reaper kill the people she saw as immoral in exchange for healing someone else.”
Sam chuckles.“Once he gets here, which hopefully won’t be for a while, I’m glad he’ll be able to meet the original.”
“For the thousandth time, yes.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Good. I love ya, kiddo. Now get some rest. We’ll get you better soon.” Dean leans back in the chair and tilts his head back as tears run down his face, wiping them away as they come out.
“Bro! I’m a feminist.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I’ll see you guys in a second. Ok Michael, let’s do this. Bring me back the minute I get the ring.”
“Dean.”
“It’s difficult, he doesn’t have a soul to sense or track, but the angel who took him, I didn’t recognize but I sensed their power then and I can sense them now. They’re still on Earth in an abandoned house just outside of Denver, Colorado.”
“Good luck,” she says as she gives Sam a hug. “I hope those fellas make it back safe.”
“What Jack?”
Sam laughs and rolls his eyes. He then looks over at Dean, who is clearly gripping Cass’ hand extremely hard judging by his white knuckles. Dean gulps and leads Cass over.
“Oh Dean. I’m already dead, so what exactly would that accomplish.”
“Awesome Doc. Thanks.”
“Jack!” Cass exclaims, jumping up from the bench and wrapping his son in a hug.
“Like I said before, I’ve gotten enough sleep for a while.”
“Thank you,” Gabriel says.
“Jesse got the mark, but just in time. Amara couldn’t hold control and Chuck tried to attack.” Cass explains.
“We need Lucifer.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Before Jebediah can respond, Rowena and Kelly emerge from the other room. A group of angels behind them, followed by Chuck himself.
“Um, what are you talking about?” Moriah asks.
“Thank you very much for your help,” Sam says.
“Cass.”
“He’s human,” Sam says.
“Hey, how you holding up?”
“How did you get him to say yes?” Cass asks.
“Is that even possible?” Benny asks.
“So they’re human?”
“What if I went with you?” Jack suggests. “They don’t like humans but I’m not human so they have no reason to hate me.”
“So what’s the plan here?” Jesse asks.
Dean glances at the clock which reads 2:18. “How ‘bout I let you drive at 3?”
Jack laughs. “I’ll be sure to pass it along. Be safe. I’ll let you know when you can return home.”
“And us?” Garth gestures to him and Benny.
“Okay.” Jack tries to sit up but fails. “Anyone know a priest?”
“Why would I do that? Didn’t you hear? Dad and I are good now.”
“Doesn’t mean I know how to execute it. The Empty is a complex being that no one but Chuck fully understands.”
“He’s been gone too long. I should have gone with him.”
“Wait where is Dean? I expected you two to show up together.”
“Why the hell would you want to do that!” Cass interjects.
“Ya, they’re in Heaven. We’re all working to find Chuck. Chuck wouldn’t have been defeated in the first place without them.”
“You’re Jack.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “How do we stop this?”
Cass and Eileen reach the front and stand in front of their soon-to-be husbands. Both unable to contain their smiles. Gabe pats Cass on the shoulder and gives Dean the ‘I’m watching you gesture’ before sitting next to John. Dean chuckles and gives him a thumbs up. Lilian kisses Eileen on the cheek and takes her seat next to Mary.

“We haven’t exactly had time.”
“Hurtful.” Chuck straightens back up in his seat. “For your information, I’ve been on the straight and narrow since you guys abandoned me. I got a job, an apartment, friends, the whole nine yards.”
“How should I know?”
“How did you become a demon?”
“We stop playing defense and make the first move,” John says after a few moments of silence. “I may not know angels but I know hunting. You don’t wait for the monster to come to you, you go to it. These assholes seem like monsters to me, so let’s treat them like it and hunt these sons of bitches.”
“But, you’re dead.”
“I think it would be best to stay together. So I can punch them if they say something terrible.”
“I’m almost 4.”
Those words made Sam smile. The world will be free. They can just live their lives. Sam can go find Eileen. Dean can start his life with Cass (he isn’t even letting the thought that Dean could fail to get him back enter his mind). They can get normal jobs and normal houses. Start families if they want. Retire from full time hunting. Team Free Will can actually have free will.
“Not necessarily. The souls could just belong to vessels.”
“Could we get the names and addresses of both your father and the pastor?” Eileen asks.
“Because if you don’t, your mother will go through an unbelievable amount of pain for eternity. Worse than if she were in Hell.”
“What? Who is she?”
“No, he’s not,” Dean says from behind Cass. “Cause I’m not letting that happen ever again.”
“I already told you guys everything I know.”
“Okay youngins, the old people are going to bed,” Dean says, yawning and pulling Cass towards the doorway.
“You wouldn’t have been a burden,” Cass says as he and Dean sit on the couch and Sam takes the lawn chair next to it.
“No. Not from this distance.”
“So… you and Dean huh?” Gabe smirks as they are walking down the white hallway.
~~~~~~~~~~
“That would work. At least until I can figure out a better place for him.”
“Don’t you Han Solo me!” Dean pulls back slightly to meet Cass’ eyes.
“You sure you choose him?” Mary mutters to Cass.
“I wouldn’t be able to handle you dying again, even temporarily.”
Before Dean can respond Michael and Jack pop back into the bunker with a familiar face. “Jesse?” Sam whispers in disbelief.
“It’s so nice to finally meet you properly. I’ve heard so much about you.”

(See the end of the chapter for
Before Cass can call the plan off, Gabe pulls himself forward and plunges the blade into his gut, his grace glowing through the stab wound as he collapses on top of Cass, Sam and Dean rushing forward to help Cass lay Gabe on the table.
“I’ve had enough chances at life. I’ve died over a hundred times. Why not let this one be permanent? If I can be happy in my head for a little longer, then I’m gonna take advantage of it. But I can’t just wake up and go back to life, not if Cass, the real Cass is gone.”
“Please, I need this ring. I always keep my word. Besides, I kinda have to return it cause it’ll fuck up the timeline if I don’t so…”
“This is all my fault.”
“Doesn’t matter. We still have your mother and we are willing to trade.”
“I get it, tough guy. Are we gonna do this or what?”
“Have you tried checking obituaries from the time of the last kill to see who in the church died under mysterious circumstances?” Jesse asks. “Then you can at least narrow it down to who it was the first time and ask around to see who they were close with.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I feel insulted.”
Jesse turns towards her more so that she can see him better. “Nice to meet you,” he signs, causing Eileen to smile in appreciation.
They all look at each other, the joy quickly fading from their faces.
~~~~~~~~~~
“Ya. I guess. I just don’t want him to do anything he’ll regret.”
“I know you’re not alone.”
Jack and Cass appear next to the table in the Bunker expecting a fight, but no one is there.
“So does that mean it’s time for you guys to go?” Dean says after a few moments of silence from the group
Chuck scoffs, “you are way too much like your family. They were talkers too. But not exactly the sharpest tools in the shed.”
“Congrats, Samantha. Oh and Dean-o, congrats on your escape from the closet.”
Before anyone can respond there is a flap of wings from the kitchen. Cass immediately shoots up and runs into the other room. The rest of the Winchesters follow.
“Congratulations Dean,” Cassie says.
“So we do nothing?” Jack asks.
“Hey, we’re just on our way to talk to the first suspect so I thought I’d call and check-in.”
“Since when do you eat?” Sam asks as Cass takes a bite.
With that they head out of the room, leaving Jack with Father Jackson to confess his apparent sins.
“Did Sam and Dean tell you what I’ve done in the past?”
“Seems too simple,” Cass responds.
“Thanks. Apparently, I need it.”
Sam laughs quietly. “Still, can’t we just help out with small things? No more apocalypse level shit.”
“And the humans?”
“He’s just trying to mess with your head. You can’t let him get to you.”
“Yes. Poor girls died just before Carl. They always came to my youth group.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Cass sighs and pushes open the door.
“Well technically it was a vamp that did it, but it’s more fun to tell people I got nailed.”
“So everyone is alright?”
“Ya, I guess. Maybe we just, ya know, relax. I mean this is heaven after all. Paradise doesn’t exactly give us much to worry about or work for.”
“You can stay here for a while? Your family and I lived here for a long time. There are some cars in the basement and it’s well warded. There should still be electricity and hot water as well.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Thank you, Rowena,” Sam jumps in, “We really appreciate it.”
Dean sighs and turns to Cass. “Why’d you have to say all those nice things to me? If you hadn’t said I was loving and caring and shit I would have just shot him in the face.” He tried to pretend to be angry but can’t keep a straight face and starts laughing.
Dean smiles and slowly takes it from Cass’ hand, pulling him in for a short kiss.
“Sounds like a plan,” Dean responds.
“Ya, I’m fine.” He stands up straight.
*Voiceover*
Woosh
“It seems like you all need therapy more than you need a priest.”
“More like I didn’t think someone could tolerate you for eternity.”
“Ya, it’s awesome. Anyway, Dean?”
“Can’t say the same for you.”
“And you didn’t try and kill him like I did.”
“No not Cassie. Cass.”
“That doesn’t mean that she knows what we are going to try and do,” Sam responds.
Gabe smiles, “Dean-o! Look who’s the smart one now. Let’s go.”
“If I remember correctly, Charlie, last time we were together you were the one having no fun.”
“Wait, they weren’t already dating? I thought Dean was just afraid to tell me or do anything with me there.”
“And what do you have to offer ME. Your just a mediocre hunter with a borrowed ring. You are nothing. You have nothing.”
“So what do we do first?” An angel asks.
Sam, Dean, Cass and Eileen sit on crappy beach towels in the sand, watching the waves on the horizon and fishing boats head in and out of the bay. Sam’s arm is around Eileen and Dean is laying with his head on Cass’ lap, Cass playing with his hair absent-mindedly while staring out on the horizon.
“Good. Were Sam, Dean, and Gabriel there?”
“Monsters are easier to deal with than Angels or Demons. Anyway, I was there until a few months ago when I sensed a portal to Earth opening up and tracked its power source. I heard two men talking about what was happening on Earth, I now realize one of them was you Dean, and decided it was time for me to come back. So I went through it.”
“Oh, nothing.”
“Want to, no. But yes. Just a moment Father.” He grabs Dean’s hand to pull him with him as he walks over to Jack and pulls out his blade. “I’m sorry Jack.” He removes his hand from Dean’s, placing it on Jack’s shoulder. Sighing and grimacing, he sliced across Jack’s throat. Dean holds out a flask and Jack’s grace streams into it. Cass runs his hand over the cut to heal it. “Are you okay Jack?”
“Hmmm, how ‘bout Sam?” Lucifer says slyly.
“Boy problems?”
“What the fuck?” Sam says laughing.
Dean holds out the Archangel blade they stole from Micheal and steps in front of Cass. “Don’t”
Jack turns to look at the rest of the group, nodding. They all hit Chuck with as much power as they can muster, forcing them to fly back into the wall. Lucifer falls to the ground with a loud thud. Cass pulls him up to his feet and shoots him an annoyed look for coming in without backup.
“We’re we really that obvious!”
“Nothing,” Dean chuckles. “Long story.”
“Let me guess, love,” they say mockingly.
There’s no response from Chuck. Instead, a few opposing angels pop up behind them, going after the others with their blades. They are easily fought off with Heaven’s army greatly outnumbering Chuck’s.
“Right before.”
“Well tell them I love them for me, would ya?”
“I don’t know, did it?” Jack asks turning to Jesse.
“Sam?” Rowena interrupts his thoughts. “I need to return to Hell. It’s been full blown panic since all of the humans disappeared from Earth. I need to put my poor demons’ minds at ease.”
Sam looks up to see a beautifully rustic house with a large yard enclosed by a white picket fence. It reminds him of the house that he and Eileen had raised their son in. “It’s amazing Jack.” Sam looks next to him just in time to see Jack smile in response and disappear. Turning back to the house he sees Eileen emerge from the door and step out onto the porch. She looks as young as the day of their unofficial wedding ceremony.
“You’re no fun. What’s a good battle without some casualties.”
“You’re investigating Eddie’s Death?” He whispers.
“Okay,” Sam says, “so what does that mean for our present situation?”
“Really? You had to bring my favorite son into this?”
“So what was Jack’s offer?” Sam asks a withdrawn Jesse after a moment.
Jesse sighs and looks down. “Well after I left home I wanted to make sure I couldn’t be used by either side as a weapon. I found myself an old emergency bunker, kinda like this one, and went into hiding. Only leaving for essentials and never using my powers. It seemed to do the trick for a while. I was never found there. Until the angels fell. I have a feeling you guys had something to do with that?”
The car is completely quiet as they get an hour or so into the long-ass drive back to Kansas. Sam is driving this time since Dean drove pretty much the whole way there. They’re planning on stopping for the night somewhere in Utah. Eileen is in the passenger seat next to Sam and Dean and Cass are in the back with Chuck in the middle, who is still in handcuffs. Music plays loudly out of the stereo to try and avoid conversation with Chuck.
“I never saw you express interest in other men, let alone me. I didn’t think that you could ever feel the same way and I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. So I just pushed it down and ignored how I felt.”
“Mmmmm no. You’re adorable.”
“They’re always reaping.”
“Thank you, Amara.”
“You can’t kill him,” Jesse says. “He already has the Mark so he can’t die.”
“Ya,” Sam said hesitantly, “Theoretically that could work but, Dean, it’s risky. What if you don’t make it back? What if the Empty doesn’t let you leave? It’s still pretty pissed.”
“Actually, she isn’t anymore. See that’s the benefit of having Death on your side. She’s very much alive. So she can very much feel pain.” Jack raised his hand, “I wouldn’t hon. If you kill me, my spell takes full effect and she will feel more pain than anyone ever has. And there is no way for anyone but me to remove the spell.”
“You sure?” Dean asks.
“Not really. A monster is a monster.”
“Oh god please don’t let it be Gabe, this place will be chaos,” Dean says groaning.
“I guess not.”
“Just take a breath sweetie,” Mary places her hand on Sam’s shoulder in comfort. “I’m sure Jack and Jesse are going to be back any minute now with good news.”
“You too.”
“So what do we do with him?” Dean asks.
~~~~~~~~~~
“But Lucifer, not so much.”
Jesse nods, “I have been hiding for too long, It’s time for me to do some good for this world.” He looked around the room, “What do you need me to do?”
“Ah. Here. Since Chuck disappeared Eva has not been accounted for. I bet if Jack checked, he would see that Eva is now Death.”
“So boys. I’m guessing you’re not here to reinstate me in my rightful place as God so what do you want?”
“It was a reaper,” Jack and Sam say simultaneously.
“Okay. I’ll send Dean if we find anything.” Charlie says without looking up from her computer.
“How do I know you won’t just do it anyway after you leave?”
“Then I’m sure we’ll figure out something to get rid of that bastard once and for all.”
“Stop arguing with me, me.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You’re-,” Dean stops as images flash through his mind. Flashing lights then a white ceiling blocked by unfamiliar faces. The beeping gets louder. He looks down at his arms and, for an instant, sees tubes and needles coming out of his skin.
Sam and Dean line up first, standing on either side of their parents. Dean links arms with John and Sam with Mary. Behind them stands Eileen with Lillian, dressed in a flowy white pantsuit, linked up with Cass who is being led by Gabriel. With Dean in control now, he decided if Cass was going to get married, even in a dream, Gabe should be there.
“How ‘bout we just agree that we make each other better.”
“Not exactly a memory I wanted to relive.”
“Amara,” he mumbles.
“I don’t want anyone to have to be possessed ever again. This made me decide that my first action after we deal with Chuck will be to craft empty vessels for Angels to use when they visit Earth.”
“I love you, Dean.”
Jesse’s apartment is small and dark. It smells of dust and wet dog. The source being the scruffy mutt asleep on the dirt-stained armchair. Books line the walls in stacks of varying heights. A small TV sits in the corner on top of a brown cardboard box labeled ‘kitchen’.
Dean walks back into the room. “Everyone’s on board.”
“Thank you. We’ll be in touch.”
“Too many people. Or angels in my case. If possible, permanently.”
Cass looks like he just saw a ghost (actually he would have been fine in that situation). Dean just laughs and grabs him by the tie, pulling him in for a long-awaited kiss. Cass doesn’t do anything at first, still in shock, but after a few seconds, he melts into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist. Dean smiles in response and places one hand on Cass’ neck and his other on Cass’ hip.
“But you were the one who had to take on this ginormous burden for the rest of eternity,” Sam mentions.
