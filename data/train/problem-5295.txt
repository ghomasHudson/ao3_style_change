"She didn't come in; she just... appeared." Tony's voice, equally startled and offended-sounding. "It's either magic, or some kind of teleportation device. Come on; I've told the security guards not to try to approach her."
Steve shook his head, but Tony thought he saw his lips twitch, just for a second. "I'll go tell them you're awake," he said.
"What data?" One of the worst parts of having a female body, Tony thought, for a half-hysterical second, was the way his voice went shrill when he was upset.
Did every woman he knew other than Wanda have to sound so gleeful? He wasn't that bad, surely. Tony buried his face in his hands, closing his eyes; it felt strange to rub his hands over his face and not feel the slight rough catch of facial hair, another reminder that his body wasn't his own anymore. "I hate my life," he muttered.
Didn't mean to do what, Clint wondered. As far as he knew, Tony had kept his cool and hadn't hurt anyone at the restaurant. He and Jan both had. Was he apologizing for the Registration mess? That time he'd been mind-controlled by Kang the Conqueror? The time he'd gone crazy and hunted down and attacked everyone who'd stolen his armor technology? The drinking? When it came to Tony, there was a lot to choose from. It was a toss up which was worse; his occasional spectacular losses of control, or his control-freak attempts to fix things afterwards.
Wanda shook her head, serious again. "I won't. Look, Tony, it will be okay. Whatever you decide to do, the rest of the team will be here for you."
It was a tempting thought, but actually attempting to put pressure on the museum via donations would be unethical. And it wasn't Steve's money to spend, either, though Tony wasn't likely to object to using financial blackmail for a good cause. Not ethical, he reminded himself.
"Sure you don't." Sam put one hand on Steve's shoulder, pushing him toward the Mansion. "This isn't your fault, you know," he added quietly, after a moment. "I mean, aside from the part where you should have known better than to get someone pregnant in the first place. Stark's never been a woman before, but I know damn well you've slept with women before."
The press. Steve resisted the impulse to groan, rubbing at his forehead. The media had been kind to them in the wake of the incident with the venom clones, the Avengers' first major fight as a re-unified team. They were not going to be kind about this. The prospect of wealthy businessman Tony Stark and almost as wealthy fashion designer and heiress Janet Van Dyne hospitalized and possibly crazy was too good a story not to have reporters fasten themselves on it like leeches.
He offered Sam a weak smile.  "I don't suppose you could recite the engineering schematics for quinjet engines?"
Sam blinked, shaking his head slowly. "Right. I think he's in the living room. But you might want to wash your face off, first."
Carol looked down at her hands. "Clint told me some things about what happened in Transia. I didn't want to listen, at first, but..." She looked back up, a rueful little smile on her lips. "I owe her an apology. God, that's going to be fun. What am I going to say, 'I wanted to believe you were evil because I liked you and then you hurt my feelings?'
"It doesn't affect her physiology when she's normal-sized," Cap said. "What do you mean, 'not exactly awake?'"
Both of them lurched sideways, his arm hitting the side of one of the room's stone statue bases with numbing force. There was an ominous rattling noise from above them, and Steve pushed himself away from the statue before it could fall on him, trying to blink the spots out of his vision.
She ought to vote no. But the fact remained that Chthon was too powerful for them to face without Wanda's magic at their disposal. Strange had admitted that touching the spear and accessing its power was beyond him, that channeling pure chaos power would drive almost any magic user other than Wanda insane. "We need her," she said. "I vote yes. But not as an Avenger. Not until we can be sure she's really okay."
He ignored her.  “Which helicopter are you taking me to?  I want to go in the one with Wanda and Tony.”
"I'll walk you there," MJ said. She slipped one hand around his arm, and fell into step beside him. "Then I'll go tell May where you are."
Steve managed not to drop his shield, despite his instinctive flinch at what looked like lightening crawling over his fingers. Another bullet clanged off it, slamming into the floor by his feet.
"Not the charging, the heart. I look like one of Dr. Frankenstein's less successful lab experiments." Tony looked back up, away from Steve, staring blankly at the shower wall. "You'd think being literally heartless would make all of this easier." Then, very quietly. "I just want it to stop."
"Yeah, Man-Mountain, go be useful," Clint said. He'd never expected to feel sorry for Hank, but right now the guy actually hadn't done anything wrong, and if Clint was being fair, Hank had to be just as worried about Jan as he was, maybe more. "We'll call you if anything changes."
Tony made no move to escape, not that he could have from this position given how much of a weight advantage Steve had. He was panting slightly; with his knee planted on Tony's chest, Steve could feel the motion of his ribs with every breath.
Steve nodded. That made sense; taking them all to one place would have flooded the emergency room before capacity. "And Tony?"
In Hank's experience, that usually meant just as much potential danger as things that glowed bright, radioactive green, flashed red, or made ominous beeping sounds. He took it gingerly, wishing illogically that he were wearing gloves – if the contents were capable of seeping though glass, they were all doomed anyway. "I'll take a look at it. If it's really some kind of virus, I'll send it to Beast; he specializes in that kind of thing."
Pepper didn't even bother trying to deny it. "You'd be cute in a miniskirt, sir. The board would love it."
"Yes," Steve said. "Jan is here." He glanced automatically around the room once again, taking in the scattered knots of museum donors. Hank and Jan had split up, Jan chatting with a tall Asian woman in impressively stacked heels while Hank examined a display of woodcuts depicting the process of distillation.
"Pepper got to me first," Steve confirmed. "Trust me, the threats aren't necesary." Watching the way Tony had been hurting while under the toxin's influence had been agony. And watching and being unable to help had been nearly unbearable. There had been far too many times in the past where Tony had been hurt and Steve had found himself unable to do anything, but this time had been one of the worst, because he had so much more to lose now. "The other day, I-" He broke off, not knowing how to continue or even if he wanted to.
"All for one, and one for all," Tony agreed. He meant for it to sound light, upbeat, but the words came out sounding grim.
Wanda glanced down at her broomstick skirt and brown leather boots and wondered if she ought to have come in costume. Would Strange think she looked unprofessional?
"That's not always true," Wanda said, a little defensively.  Considering that Strange had all but written her off completely as crazy and beyond help a little over a year ago, it was awfully forgiving off her, probably moreso than Tony would have been.  The fact that he'd apologized and helped her when she'd escaped Chthon must have gone a long way.
The Doombot's energy weapons crackled uselessly as she forced them to malfunction.  It barely seemed to notice her next punch, all of its attention focused on trying to rip free the handheld force cannon she had fused to its gauntlet.  The cannon was emitting a high-pitched whine, only moments away from exploding.
Daredevil had heard whispering in the cathedral, before Chthon had influenced a previously law-abiding man into attacking Strange. Wanda had said that she could feel both Chthon and the magic in the book trying to speak to her because of her powers, but magical ability didn't seem to be necessary.
It hadn't been fair of her, she knew now. Only the second part had been his fault, not the first. At least he realized that his actions had been dangerous now. At the time, he'd seemed totally incapable of grasping that anything he did might have negative consequences.
Tony blinked, expression uncertain for second, then smiled. It was only a little forced. "That's because you usually aren't one. I only have to remind you that there are options you're not considering once in a while."
Hank looked up from his mass-spectrometer results with relief as Thor's voice echoed through the building; they were back.
"We'll apologize to them as nicely as we can," he said.  "I think I'll go call Bucky.  Maybe they've made some progress on tracking down Doom's headquarters."  He'd vanished from the Latverian embassy the previous evening, several hours before his attack on the mansion, and the Avengers, SHIELD, and the NYPD had all been met with polite shrugs and an obviously rehearsed statement that Latveria's beloved leader had left to return to Doomstadt, and that they had no idea of his current whereabouts.
Sin laughed, the sound reverberating in a way that shouldn't have been possible coming from a human throat.   She thrust her good hand toward Doom, and Tony's vision dissolved into static as the armor's visual sensors malfunctioned and his helmet display warped into a distorted smear of light.   He shut them all down and switched to simply looked through the helmet's lenses, normal vision with nothing enabled, just in time to see the spear hit the ground, the air around it wavering as if from extreme heat.
"Good," Hank pointed at the nearest computer terminal. "Pull up the medical database and start cross-checking them to make sure none of them are contraindicted against physostigmine."
Cap shook his head. "I've had good luck recently, until today." He reached out with the hand that wasn't holding onto the bed and took Tony's wrist.
The spear went through his armor like a hot knife through butter, and the pain was like Afghanistan all over again.
"Pepper's going to help Jan organize it and send out invitations," Tony said, his voice dry. "Happy wants me to... okay, Happy's suggestions are actually good, but that doesn't mean this isn't going to be the most embarrassing experience of our lives."
Its voice cut out abruptly, and Hank never got to hear the rest of the threat.  It was moving jerkily now, as the ants' work began to interfere with its ability to send commands to its limbs. Unfortunately, it wasn't the only Doombot in the room.
Barnes slapped his good hand down on the table, muttering something in Russian that was obviously an obscenity.  "I don't know.  We didn't bother to find out; all we cared about was stopping it."
"Tony Stark and Janet Van Dyne," Sam said, not giving Cap a chance to speak. "The paramedics just brought them in."
Tony was still staring up at him, still wearing that crooked grin. "I almost choked on my drink when you did. Do you have any idea how many fantasies I've had about you?"
Redwing swooped down to settle on Sam's shoulder, making a soft, chirring noise of protest at being left behind. Then Steve appeared at Sam's side, grabbing him by the elbow. "Can you get back up?' he asked, tone abrupt, no preamble at all. "War Machine's gone into the dining room, so if anyone else jumps, there's only Carol to catch them."
Wanda arched an eyebrow. "Did you try asking the Night Nurse? I think the two of them are involved."
Steve moved closer, taking hold of Tony's wrists, and gently pulling his hands down. "That's not what I want to talk about." He hesitated, then decided to be blunt. Subtle hints rarely succeeded in getting Tony to talk about whatever was bothering him. "Are you... all right? You looked-"
Steve would have insisted on Tony still sleeping in his bed, on not changing anything they did just because circumstances had changed. He would probably have insisted on going ahead with the wedding, as well, if there had been a snowball's chance in hell that the state would have let them.
She shook her head. "That's not the only reason I was angry. I was angry at you for hurting yourself, for being so stupid, for throwing your career and our marriage and your membership on the Avengers away." Hank was one of the smartest men she knew, and he'd acted like an idiot, done things she'd
. Chthon's hollow, whispery voice stabbed at his brain, the syllables like the crackling of fire, or the crunching of tiny, dried bones.
Tony stared at him, the irritation Steve had expected to see completely absent from his expression. "That may be the sappiest thing anyone has ever said to me," he said, lips curving into a slightly-crooked smile.
Steve pulled on a clean shirt, then guiltily picked the towel back up and went to hang it on the appropriate towel rack in the bathroom. He'd hoped that working out would alleviate the restless boredom that had been plaguing him all morning. Unfortunately, Clint and Sam had both refused to spar with him, claiming that he was just grouchy and looking for someone to hit, and beating up a punching bag wasn't nearly as satisfying.
Someone grabbed his shoulder, fingers digging in so hard that his entire arm went numb, and pulled him upright.  “Are you all right?  Where are you hurt?”
That had been Steve's idea, as had the plate of cookies on the coffee table. Tony had pointed out that Ben Urich was legendarily immune to bribery, and Steve had given him a shove that was somewhere between playful and admonishing and told him that it wasn't a bribe; it was good manners.
The Adam's annual charity ball was semi-infamous in New York's business world; given the hosts' banking and finance connections, there was often as much quiet not-quite-insider-trading going on at the event as their was fundraising for the American Cancer Society.
Wanda straightened, slowly uncurling her fingers from the brass rail and stepped away from it. She could feel cold sweat prickling up and down her sides, sticking her clothing to her skin. She wouldn't be able to hold him out for long – driving him out in the first place had already exhausted her.
Bringing him back didn’t make sense.   Thor had come back to life entirely on his own, but he was a god, and the normal rules don’t apply to them.  Cap had been brought back by Doom for god knew what reasons, probably some convoluted plan involving brainwashing and an army of Latverian super soldiers, but if anyone deserved a second chance at life, it was Cap.  It was only justice that he’d gotten it.  Whereas Clint himself – he was a pretty good guy, and a damn good superhero, but why him?  Why him, and not the man Wanda had loved, or any one of the other people the Avengers had lost.
Tony dodged another blast of invisible force, and fired at the Doombot still hammering on Steve's shield.  It exploded in a miniature fireball that burned both green and orange-white, and the nearly invisible magical explosion that shadowed it stank of Chthon.  "Only to the Helicarrier," he said, "and only if I divert power from the rest of the armor's systems to boost the signal.  Sorry.  Without Extremis-"
Wanda was not there. Once upon a time, she would have been out there reminding Clint that spying on one's teammates was juvenile and silly, all the while elbowing him out of the way so that she could have a chance to listen at the keyhole.
He was probably going to go hide in the basement lab, where he would stay holed up for hours, not emerging until either Steve, Pepper, or Jarvis dragged him out.
Wanda looked down at her hands, then back up at Clint, her face carefully expressionless. "I think we need to," she said. Her voice was even, but Clint could hear the strain in it.
Strange. She could go to Strange. The Sorcerer Supreme had faced Chthon before, and managed at the very least to fight him to a draw. Strange was the most powerful magician on Earth; if he couldn't help her, then she was beyond help. And even then, he would be able to do something. Cut off her access to her powers, maybe – it was possible to burn the mutant abilities out of someone. Sinister had done it – or even, if necessary, kill her.
As Steve stepped into Tony's room, he could hear the familiar beeping of a heart monitor -- too fast for someone unconscious, just as Dr. Brackett had said. That had to be a good sign; as long as Tony was awake, he wasn't dying.
"Isn't he your brother?" Sam sounded openly horrified. He had never been on a team with Thor, Hercules, or any of the Avengers' other divine or semi-divine members before; the particularly nasty nature of Asgardian politics was clearly a revelation to him.
"Why would you-" he started, and then felt a chill as he remembered Tony's face that night on the Helicarrier, when Steve had accused him of being suicidal.
Tony lifted his head again, but did not meet Thor's eyes. "The SHRA is gone, and so is your clone. I don't think there's anything left for us to say to one another about them." He rubbed the back of his hand under his nose, removing some of the blood, then looked down at his blood-smeared hand and frowned, visibly irritated at the sight.
Hank, Jan knew from long experience, frequently didn't notice what women were wearing, and sometimes didn't even notice their hair color. But he still noticed her, even after their relationship's spectacularly messy ending.
The flash of hurt he felt was ridiculous — Steve was just being over-protective and stubborn and unreasonable and... he still managed to have a point.  He was a liability at the moment, had been steadily more and more of one recently as his ability to use the Extremis decreased.
Carol glanced involuntarily at the shrouded body, then forced herself to look away, back to Clint. "She was already being influenced by Chthon in England. I don't think her powers naturally work that way, or she would have healed people with them a lot more often." And if Chthon's influence was necessary in order to do it, then one person's life wasn't worth the potential consequences.
There were circles under her eyes, and something about the expression in them reminded Clint of Jan and Tony in the hospital, staring at horrible things that didn't exist outside their own heads, or Hank, sick-looking and white-faced after Jan had flinched back from him.
Bucky and Natasha were both pretty good at it, though they were hardly typical, but she had a point.  He should have heard her coming.
"Loathe as I am to admit this, my treacherous kinsman hath a point." Thor sounded aghast, through whether it was at the idea of being used as a vessel for Chthon, or over the fact that he was agreeing with Loki, Tony wasn't sure. "Only a monster would do such a thing to a woman who was with child."
Steve hadn't slept in over twenty-four hours, some of his teammates were pushing forty-eight hours without sleep, and the six of them had to give a press conference less than four hours from now, wherein they would have to explain how they'd managed to thwart Kang's latest attempt to take over the world, and why doing so had involved blowing up Madison Square Garden.
Pepper. Tony winced, suddenly regretting the fact that he'd taught her how to do that little trick, which she'd apparently learned well enough that the measures he'd taken to hide the location of the computer he was using hadn't stopped her.
"Which means you'd keep it." As if there were really any question about that. Tony stared down at the pieces of his armor, the dent still visibly scarring the side of his breastplate. If he looked at Steve, he knew, he would see the disappointment in his eyes - maybe he could keep it out of his voice, but his face had always been painfully easy to read.
"Let. Go," she hissed. "Or I will zap you." He flinched back, releasing his death grip on her arm, and she shoved him toward the nearest table. "Get under there and stay down. You'll be safe there."
"Return that to me, or I shall take it from your corpse!" Doom snarled.  He fired a stream of energy at Wong, missing him by inches, then turned and aimed a vicious kick at Sam's ribs.
Byrd. At least there was someone out there whose pursuit of Tony's armor was open, above-board, and well-intentioned. Tony and the senior senator for Virginia had a mutual respect for one another that made clashes with him, if not pleasant, at least endurable. At least, Byrd had respected Tony. God knew what he thought of him now.
"You think such petty weapons can disable the Sorcerer Supreme?" he asked, and raised his hands once more, gathering the power he had never lost hold of into them and preparing to launch into another spell.
Steve glared at Tony, feeling his face start to burn again. This entire game seemed to be designed for the sole purpose of humiliating him and making him uncomfortable. He'd told everyone something about himself that he'd kept hidden for years, trusted them with one of his longest-held secrets - one that in his original time could have gotten him kicked out of the army, arrested, thrown in jail - any Tony was acting like it was nothing, like it was something to mock.
"No," Peter said, "More like hallucinating that your friends are dead and you killed them." He thought of Gwen again, who would still be alive if it wasn't for him. It wasn't just that his webline had broken her neck -- if it weren't for him, she would never have been anywhere near the top of the Brooklyn Bridge in the first place. The Green Goblin had kidnapped her because she had been Peter's friend. Like the Kingpin's hired assassin shooting Aunt May because she had the bad luck to be related to Spiderman.
"Hey, we saved the book," Clint said, crouching down to examine the limp form of the man Steve had disarmed and knocked down. "And Sin's the only one who got — damn it, this guy's dead."
"It must be hard for you," Agatha said gently, laying a sympathetic hand over Wanda's. "And Stephen was your doctor before the twins were born, wasn't he?"
“Yeah,” she said after a moment, and he could feel her arms come up to hug him back.  “I guess we did.”
It was one of the reasons they hadn't realized how bad his drinking was; he'd never asked anyone for help, never mentioned how much stress he was under or how much pain he was in. He'd just carried the weight of his problems by himself until it had broken him.
She picked the little girl up. Thankfully, instead of panicking further, the child clung to her, burying her face in Jan's neck, snuffling quietly. Her face was hot, and damp with tears.
Jan rubbed at her arms, and wished the new, weatherproof and silk-lined version of her costume had been ready last night. Hank hadn't gotten around to infusing it with Pym particles yet, still too busy dissecting the remains of Thursday's giant squid and pouring over his recessive X-gene carrier theory to have time for anything else.
He felt restless, twitchy, the kind of useless, jumpy energy he usually burned off by going for a run or working out, but a hand-to-hand workout with Sam earlier hadn't made a dent in it.
"Why don't you go see how Steven and the others are doing," Aunt May said, cutting him off before he could stammer something else inarticulate. She frowned. "Somebody should call Edwin and tell him what's going on. They're not going to think of it. Mary Jane, would you? I need to get to my appointment, and they won't let you use cell phones in here."
"It makes people hallucinate," Cap said. "Things so bad that they started stabbing each other with silverware and jumping out tenth storey windows to get away."
"The kind of collector," Wanda said, "who likes to summon demons in their spare time. Or transform himself into a vampire, or gain ultimate power."
"So did the last person claiming to be one of Mr. Stark's relatives, and he had a camera around his neck."
Steve leaned down and curved one hand around the side of Tony's face, using his thumb to brush away the soot. Tony's eyes fluttered to half-mast, and he leaned into Steve's hand for a moment before Steve let go and drew his hand away.
Blood was seeping between his fingers, the raw, metallic smell of it so thick that he could taste it in the back of his throat.  He remembered drowning on it, feeling cold and sick and unable to breathe, and hoped the spear hadn’t caught one of Tony’s lungs.
"I wouldn't wish the kind of press this would have gotten you on anyone." Hank said. He held up one finger. "But if you ever call in for emergency backup again and refuse to tell anyone what's wrong with you until we get there... I thought you were dying."
Steve was big and warm and oh, thank God, alive. Tony's face was buried in his shoulder, the edges of Steve's scale-mail digging into his cheek. He was alive, and whatever it felt like, none of it had been real.
He wasn't even sure if his presence was welcome - Tony wasn't even looking at him. He was still staring down at his own hands, as he had been since he's woken up an hour ago and been pronounced unharmed by Don.
She got off the subway in midtown, emerging onto the street to see a familiar cathedral spire visible a few blocks away. The giant cross that topped St. Margaret's stood out starkly against the pale violet of the evening sky.
"I-was going to tell you not to try that."  Hank's voice was just above a whisper, not that that would actually help if Doom had them under electronic or magical surveillance.  From this distance, without decent light, it was impossible to tell if he was hurt of not.
Clint shook his head. "It'll teach me not to lurk in hallways. I know what you mean about restaurants closing," he added. "That pizza place by the Met went out of business while I was dead."
So Wanda was out there somewhere, possibly with amnesia, possibly still in full possession of her powers, and they had no idea where. Tony made a mental note to keep an eye out for any unexplained events or energy surges in Europe. "If she's not using her powers on a major scale, and she really does have amnesia, than she's not a major threat right this moment. We've got enough to deal with here without mounting a global search for someone who wants to stay lost and can use magic to keep it that way."
"You're the last person I expected to be this pleased to have her back on the team," she said, the words coming out a little more sarcastically than she had intended. "After what she did to you..." Explicitly mentioning the mind-controlled sex Clint had been subjected to in Transia was not something she was willing to do in a place this public, but he would know what she meant. There were certain things that didn't need to be named — things terrible enough or significant enough that afterwards, 'what he did to you,' or 'what happened in Transia' could only have one possible meaning. "I would have expected Thor to greet Tony with open arms first."
. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't relax, and everything I felt was so overwhelming that I couldn't handle it. Looking back, it's so obvious that the things I did were just so incredibly stupid that I can't believe I did them, but I swear, at the time it all made perfect sense."
The curved line of Tony's spine was the same, male or female; the way his lower back dipped in just a bit above the base of his spine was something that he'd always had. His face was less delicate than Steve remembered, the pointed chin gone.
Steve half-raised one hand, intending to put a hand on Tony's arm, pull him in for a hug, something, then thought better of it. Tony might not want Steve to touch him. Probably didn't want Steve to touch him.
"Step away from him, Loki," Steve called, but he didn't throw his shield, though Don could tell from the way he held it that he wanted to.
"The beauty of team simulations is that I don't have to be faster than the holographic bad guys. I just have to be faster than you."
"Cap," Wanda interrupted, "if you had actually told Tony that he couldn't be Iron Man because he was pregnant, I would have had to hit you on behalf of all women everywhere. I stayed in costume until I was eight months pregnant." She looked away, staring down at the grass, and Steve tried and failed to think of something to say.
"Does anyone have any points of business to bring up?" Jan went on. These meetings always reminded her how heavily Tony had been involved in writing their by-laws. "Do we want Iron Man to read us the latest financial report on the Maria Stark Foundation and our funding, or shall we skip that?"
His head still ached dully, his left temple and eye throbbing sharply in warning any time he tried to access anything other than the armor. It hadn't been this bad in months, not since those first few days after the fight with the Mandarin and Red Skull. It might possibly be worse now — he'd nearly keeled over in SE's boardroom yesterday, something that would have been a high point in personal humiliation not equaled since he'd stopped drinking.
The impulse to pull Tony even closer to him warred with annoyance. "I get to decide who deserves me." Steve settled for grabbing Tony by the arms to prevent him from pulling away. "I was dead," he said, remembering what he'd told Luke Cage months ago. "I can sleep with whoever I want. And I don't care who knows about it."
Tony had listened, though.  Eventually.  And had nearly died anyway, after they had stopped Sin and Chthon and Doom, after their backup had come, when they were all supposed to be safe.
Sam banked left, then folded his wings and went into a steep dive, leaving Redwing to circle above the street alone. He'd only have once chance to grab her; the air was dead calm, with no lift to speak of, so once he'd lost altitude, he wouldn't be able to climb back up for another try, and if he missed, she was as good as dead.
There had been six glossy photographs, all of them full color. He could remember the details clearly, but nothing about what he'd felt or thought while looking at them. Maybe he hadn't felt anything; it had been easier not to. "I specifically requested the information."
Tony offered him what was probably supposed to be an encouraging smile. "We're going to fix it. Maya's working on it right now." Steve wasn't sure if he was trying to reassure him or himself.
"Did he really just make air quotes when he said 'law' and 'morality?'" Clint asked. He ducked a roundhouse swing from one of the A.I.M. hirelings and slammed his elbow into the man's ribs, doubling him over. Then he turned back to their main antagonist, an arrow nocked and ready to shoot.
Well, this was going to have to be one time that Captain America lost.  "I'm fine," Tony said. "'We want to keep you overnight for observation' is doctor speak for 'There's nothing seriously wrong with you but your medical history makes us nervous.'  I just need a couple hours of sleep and some aspirin, and then I'll be good as new."  It was a slight exaggeration, considering how much effort just sitting up and talking was taking, but Tony had been in enough hospitals and seen enough doctors to know when they thought you were seriously ill or on the verge of death, and when they were just being cautious, and the looks he'd been getting and firm-yet-polite "suggestions" that he rest and recover and not pull the IV line out of his arm that he'd been given fell under "just being cautious."  And even if they hadn't been, with Hank missing, Tony was the only one who could properly run a diagnostic on the mansion's systems.
"Sir, we need you to go outside and tell the police and firemen that they can start coming in," Steve told the building manager. "We've determined that the attack is chemical rather than biological, but they're still going to need breathing gear."
"Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty for the greater good," Barnes said. He pulled off his left glove and rested his forehead against the silver metal of his left palm.
"Everything's changed since Tony and Reed and the rest of you blew the lid off everything. Blitzschlag is out, and there's an oversight committee looking into Van Patrick's death. I think his family is going to sue."
"At the ritual?  He was leading it."  Barnes smirked at the memory.  "I think he was almost offended that Steve wasn't there."
The final gunman's weapon jammed with a loud click, and Carol grabbed him from behind, pinning his arms to his sides.
"The Meridian," she said, all business. "It's on Wall Street." She snatched a sticky-note from the corner of Tony's desk and thrust it at Steve. "Here's the address."
Which meant it wasn't safe yet for Hank to try shrinking down small enough to fit through the gaps in the energy grid.  Even twenty-four hours would have been risky — it took longer than that for most psychological medications to completely leave the body — and by that time, Sin was likely to have come back and started in on whatever plans he had for them anyway.
Around them, the contents of one of Steve's boxes of books lay scattered across the floor, the box itself lying on its side a few feet away. The bare wood of the floor was hard, still waiting to be covered by rugs, and the air smelled like new paint beneath the already-fading odor of sex.
It felt empty, these days. Tony had never thought he would actually miss the terrariums full of assorted creepy crawly things, but the lab seemed much more sterile with none of Hank or Scott Lang's pets in residence.
Once the drug had worn off, her reactions just seemed disproportionate and silly. She couldn't imagine herself overreacting like that, even back when she'd been a twenty-two year old socialite playing at being a superhero.
"You are the one who does not think.  You lack vision, even more so than Richards does.  I am a genius, a strategist, a master of both science and magic; naturally a second-rate scientist whose only accomplishments were accidents would fail to understand my plans."
Sam and Clint had been coming by in alternating shifts, probably, Steve acknowledged, as much to keep an eye on himself and Hank as anything else.
“Do it,” Steve said, because now that the possibility had been suggested, he couldn’t stand not knowing.
"I..." he started, then hesitated. "I can go back to LA if, um, if you really want me to," he blurted out, after the pause had grown just long enough to feel unnatural.
"No, we're all fine." Jan closed the distance between them and put a hand on his arm, leaning her head on his shoulder. "There were vials of something in the unexploded bombs."
Hank dropped to one knee, braced a hand against the wall, and began to grow, stopping only when his shoulder was in danger of brushing against the energy grid.  Then he took the chain attached to Don's right wrist in both hands, and threw his weight against it, pulling for all he was worth.
Arlington. Jack Monroe was buried there, and Toro, and all the Howling Commandos save for Nick, Dugan, and Gabe Jones. Bucky had a headstone there, that still hadn't been taken down.
Loki's smile was cold now, revealing teeth just a fraction too sharp to belong to anything human. "No, I merely had hoped that you would choose to follow the wisest course available to you. My aid is not a thing to be dismissed lightly. We were brothers once; does none of that bond remain?"
There was a murmur of sound from the hallway outside – the building was a warren of little hallways and rooms, thin, pasteboard walls partitioning up what had once been either a warehouse or a factory floor – and Wanda lifted her hands, calling her power to her and trying not to notice that the energy she could feel welling up inside her was less intense than it had been before. Even constrained by her new wards, she had more than enough power behind her hexes to take care of anyone unfriendly about to walk through the exam room's door.
Tony might be apologizing, but clearly he didn't actually understand how serious any of this was. Or what Steve had actually meant. Tony flirted with people all the time - maybe it didn't really mean anything, or at least, not what Steve had hoped it meant.
Tony shook his head, his stomach hollow. "Just tell me now and get it over with." She wouldn't meet his eyes, which didn't necessarily mean anything with Maya — like Reed, she didn't feel that actually looking at people was necessary for conversation — but they never asked you to sit down for good news.
Clint shrugged. "They weren't that good after the second one, anyway. Not that I cared," he went on hastily, "since they're kids' books and I was only reading them to Cassie."
Steve closed his eyes for a long moment, hands clenching uselessly into fists at his sides, then exhaled, forcing himself to treat this like he would any other emergency.
"He asked for it. Literally." Wanda was smiling now, a real smile. "I don't think I'll ever forget him defending your dubious honor against Cap, though."
"I could have hurt you." Tony lifted his head from his hands; even this close, Steve could still barely make out his expression in the dim light. "When that poison was affecting me... it's a miracle I didn't hurt anyone. Next time something like this happens, I might."
There was a long, awkward moment of silence, while Hank obliviously continued to work. Wanda looked stricken, her eyes wide and her face raw.
Wanda rubbed the cat's other ear, carefully, then smiled when he leaned his head into her hand. "The book will be gone soon, kitty," she told him. "I won't let it hurt you." She paused for a second, stroking the six-toed foot splayed against Steve's scale-mail. "I'm glad
"The Jackson Pollock paintings," Tony announced. "I think MoMA outbid me for one of them a few years ago."
"We've used up far more than our share of good luck recently." Tony met Cap's eyes as he spoke, and the two of them shared a moment of silent communication that made Wanda very aware if how much she'd missed while Chthon had had her. The Avengers had presented her with a united front so far, as if the entire Superhuman Registration fight that she had heard so much about had never occurred, but there were moments when the attempt to put a brave face on things wore thin. They weren't always the moments she had expected, either.
Then she took a step backward, and vanished into thin air, her wide, unfriendly smile the last thing to disappear.
Wanda turned, her face expressionless. She was wearing a conservative skirt and blouse in subdued colors, and her face looked drawn and pale with exhaustion. She straightened her shoulders and faced them unflinchingly. "Clint," she said. "Steve, Carol. I'm... I'm glad you came. All of you." Her voice wavered on the last word, but her face and posture didn't change.
Taking it off and putting it away had been a relief. He knew that it wasn't the costume that had been responsible for his past mistakes, and his loss of control - it had been his own personality flaws, and his own screwed up brain chemistry - but wearing one again brought back too many memories. Good memories, which was why they were dangerous.
"Well, obviously," Clint was saying, "but now Wanda and Hank can't figure out how to change him back, and it's not funny anymore. And I had to watch him and Hank-"
"I've got it." Steve took a deep breath, hoping his minor miracle was still working, and commanded the armor to return itself to Tony's briefcase. Luck was still with him; the pieces floated up into the air and repacked themselves neatly into the metal case.
There was blood in his mouth, thick and metallic, so much that he was choking on it, and he couldn't breathe, his lungs as paralyzed as the rest of him.
Tony forced down the impulse to snap that he didn't want Fury's business anyway. Not now that he knew how little he could trust the man. Fury knew, better than most people, why Tony didn't want his armor in anyone else's hands, how dangerous it was. "Iron Man is aware of that," he said. "That particular bodyguard has been fired and replaced. Wishing that our problems didn't exist doesn't help anyone. We have to move forward, not dwell on previous mistakes. SHIELD is still involved in several patent lawsuits with SI, which would make a business relationship extremely," Tony paused, searching for a word that would not raise eyebrows in polite company, "awkward. If the judge rules in our favor, SHIELD will have to compensate us for their unauthorized use of Stark designs."
"So you see," Wanda was saying, her voice measured and careful, "I can't leave until Chthon has been stopped. And I can't fight him alone, not without using his own power to strengthen mine. And if I do that, he'll have me again. I can understand if you don't want to help me, but you needed to know-"
The gap between him and Tony felt much wider than the bare few inches of mattress between them counted for. The memory of Tony flinching away from his touch was all too clear; Steve rolled over onto his side, facing away from Tony. Sleep was a long time in coming.
Cap entered the room first, ducking his head slightly as he came through the doorframe, as if he expected the jamb to be too low to clear the top of his head; it wasn't, but only by a few inches. He was in civilian clothes, the collar of his old-fashioned trench coat turned up against the cool night air.
Tony was still angry, obviously, even if he was making an effort to hide it. He'd never objected to Steve's presence in his lab before. "Well, I don't have things to do, so I might as well come. I can hand you tools."
in tones that would once have been an annoyed snarl and now were usually just resigned, but there were times when they had to stop tiptoeing around the truth. And the truth was that all of them had the potential to be incredibly dangerous under the wrong circumstances. It wasn't as if having to keep a watchful eye on a teammate was a new concept.
Tony, unsurprisingly, didn't answer. "You should go upstairs," Hank told Jan. "I'll be busy down here for a while." He didn't have time for any of this. He had a poison to analyze, and a paper for the
His shield was back in his hand now, and the edge left long dents and gouges in Doom's armor.  It was sturdier than the recent batch of Doombots had been; he obviously saved the stronger — and rarer — alloys for his own armor.
Tony spun on the ball of his right foot and launched a kick at Steve's stomach. Steve's hand clamped around his ankle and yanked, his foot sweeping Tony's supporting leg out from under him, and then Tony was flat on his back, staring up at the high, white ceiling. He rolled before Steve could pin him, and scrambled back to his feet. "I thought we were done with this whole chaos spear thing after Strange took care of it last spring." At least Strange was awake now, though the fact that Chthon had been able to take him out so easily made that less comforting than Tony would have liked. Worse, his hands were apparently going to take days, maybe weeks, to heal completely.
She had moved her hand. Because she chose to, not because Chthon had made her. His control must be slipping, or maybe the power that filled the cathedral nave was interfering with it. It didn't matter – all that mattered was the tiny sliver of freedom it gave her.
Just because Strange had heard nothing didn't necessarily mean he was dead. Strange had little contact with the X-Men or any other mutant organization, outside of the occasional meeting with Xavier, and Pietro was unlikely to go to anyone who was neither a mutant nor an Avenger for help.
"Ah," she said. "One of Mr. Stark's 'relatives.'" Clint could actually hear the quotation marks around the word 'relatives.' "Come along, Mr. Hawkeye." She gestured with her clipboard for him to precede her. "Why don't we get you seen to?"
Jan shoved her way through the crowd, ducking under a chair that one of the stock brokers threw at her. It crashed into the window, creating a spiderweb of cracks in the glass.
"You know that's not my name, Victor. Not my real one, anyway." She removed the tip of the dagger from his mask and slid the weapon back into the scabbard at her thigh, probably intending the action to be erotic.
She'd lived in this small village, at the foot of Mount Wundgadore, for her whole life. But how could she have? It didn't make sense; she didn't know any of these people, didn't even remember the names of the streets.
Sam nodded. "Yeah, that would do it, I imagine." He still looked skeptical, eyeing Thor uneasily. The idea that anyone would kidnap and rape a sibling - blood relative or not - as part of a political plot was obviously new to him and probably not something he thought Thor should be taking this lightly.
Carol shrugged. "Oh, he doesn't die. He just loses both legs in an unfortunate teleporter accident."
“I don’t even know what she did,” Jan admitted.  It had stopped Sin, or whatever it was Sin had become, and that was all that mattered at the moment.  If there were any side effects... they’d deal with those later.
There was a hint of jerkiness in Tony's movements as he resumed his feet, a tenseness through his shoulders; despite Steve's hopes, he didn't look any more relaxed than he had when he'd returned from SI's offices. Steve hadn't asked, but he assumed today's board meeting had gone badly.
A wall of invisible force hit them like a wave, crushing her into the hard metal of Tony's armor, and then Wanda was falling the remaining few feet to the ground.
Steve had just gotten up to swap the icepack out for one that wasn't starting to melt when the very last person he wanted to see appeared in the kitchen doorway.
"I read your interview," she repeated. "I want to apologize for the autopsy reports. I would never have left them on your desk like that if I'd known."
There was a moment of tense, frozen silence, during which Carol could almost feel them debating whether or not to make one last suicidal attack, and then the two of them turned and ran.
Clint stepped forward and took the magazine from Steve's hands, opened it, and shoved it back at him. "Actually, I think he just needs to see the last page."
"You think there's any chance Spiderman might be willing to sign on with us?" Rhodey went on. "He's been doing this since he was younger than most of those kids, and he's got actual experience as a teacher, which is more than the rest of us have."
thought about the villains they were fighting, and ask for her suggestions on strategy. She and Pietro had had nowhere to go, after running from Magneto, and Steve had given them a home.
Peter shifted his weight from one foot to the other, feeling awkward. He didn't really feel comfortable speaking for Hank about this, not when Hank's solution was still a work in progress. "Maybe," he said, noncommittally. "He did think of something that we can do now, though. Somebody needs to get the Wasp to grow, because if she doubles her size-"
Clint giggled. There was no other word for it. "Oooh, Captain America said the word 'breasts.' Without blushing! Keep that up and you might even be able to find another girlfriend some time soon."
"I've tried everything I can think of," she said now. "Spells to dispel enchantments, hexes to disrupt other people's magic, even healing spells, though my powers don't exactly lend themselves to that. If I don't take a break soon, I'm going to start accidentally frying lab equipment. Or you."
The relief on Sam's face when he caught sight of Steve heading toward them was obvious even from several yards away.
"It doesn't matter." Tony waved a hand dismissively. "Indres didn't lie about-" he broke off, then said, "It is true, you know it is. Even Jan just wanted a distraction from everything that had happened with Hank. Even if I hadn't told her about being Iron Man, it wouldn't have lasted. She can do better."
Tony rubbed his thumb up and down Steve's bicep, the familiar warmth of his skin obscurely comforting, and leaned in a little closer. "We never got a chance to finish what we started earlier," he said, lowering his eyes to glance at Steve's crotch. "I think you said I owed you something for cooking for me."
“Yes?”  Then confusion instantly melted into contriteness.  “Sorry.  I’m not supposed to do that, am I?”  Tony closed his eyes again, and groaned faintly, his fingers relaxing in Steve’s hand.  “I feel much too good, even with the pain.  How much morphine do they have me on?”
"Hank thinks she didn't intend to kill him," Steve said, leaning into Tony's touch. "Sin is insane, but she's not incompetent; if she had wanted him dead tonight there would have been something more immediately lethal on that knife blade."
Hank threw himself to the side as his Doombot lurched toward him, ordering the remaining ants toward the still fully functional one, which was now aiming its energy weapon at Sam.
"Vision's a coward about you. He always has been." As far as Steve was concerned, being an android was no excuse; Jim Hammond had been an android as well, and probably a less sophisticated model than Vision, and he would never have treated someone he so obviously cared about so coldly. He wouldn't have run away from them, either.
"I'm going to go look for him," Clint said, standing abruptly and brushing feather barbs off his pants.
Hank carefully loaded a third sample of blood into the mass spectrometer, then sat back to await the results. Yes, he'd done this twice already, but this time he was searching for a different set of variable than the first two times.
He knew Tony was even more exhausted. Jan had dozed on the couch for most of the day, recovering from the fear toxin and its antidote. Tony, on the other hand, had refused to go and lie down; instead, he had listlessly followed Steve from room to room around the Avengers' living quarters.
Tony stared at him blankly for a moment, as if he’d forgotten that that would even be in question.  Then he smiled again, the expression not quite a smirk.   “I’ll flip you for it.”
They were silent for a moment, while the cat prowled around the room, tail and fur still twitching.  The he froze, crouched low, wriggled his entire little orange body, and launched himself at Sam's foot.
It did not make his actions acceptable, or forgivable, but it did, perhaps, render them comprehensible. He said as much, and Tony dropped his face into his hands again, his shoulders sagging.
Saying 'I told you so,' would be petty. Steve lifted his hand from Tony's shoulder, letting it fall back to his side. "You could barely move last night. I think the side effects are pretty bad already."
Tony leaned his weight a little more heavily against Steve, his skin hot against Steve's bare shoulder. "That numerous mutants appear to have spontaneously regained their powers, and that they'll have to ask the X-Men if they want more detailed information. Even if I actually had a clue what was going on, I wouldn't tell them. Not now that I have a choice."
Everyone in the room except for Clint was laughing. He suspected that they were all starting to hit the point where good judgment went out the window, himself included.
Steve led Tony into the kitchen and fetched a clean dishtowel out of a drawer, dampening it under the faucet.
Steve knew he'd passed out trying to recharge his old chestplate more than once back in the early days. Staying to keep an eye on him suddenly seemed like a good idea, regardless of Tony's objections. "Yes," he said, "I do. This whole floor's just one big room, and it's the only furnished part of the building."
"A while?"  Hank's shoulders twitched, the attempt at a shrug cut short by the fact that at least part of his weight was hanging from his arms.  "I don't know.  Long enough to be thirsty, not long enough to start desperately needing a bathroom, and definitely less than twenty-four hours."
The crystal was growing warm in her hands, like something living, and it had begun to glow just brightly enough that she could see its light as a soft red glow through her closed eyelids.
Except, as it turned out, the library was not empty. Wanda was curled up in one of the oversized leather chairs that predated the Avengers' use of the house and had somehow managed to survive six years of superhero occupancy. She had her nose buried in a copy of
The robot lost its grip on the bridge cables and fell, its impact taking out the remarkably ugly abandoned office building Sam had been ranting about just yesterday -- "People want to level it and put a park there, but it was built by the student of some famous architect, not that you can tell, because it's your standard 60s cinderblock bunker" -- and Steve, watching, tried very hard to look appropriately guilty. He suspected that he failed in this endeavor, since the firemen who came to deal with the robot remains a few minutes later kept giving him conspiratorial looks.
The hallways and stairs blurred around him, and he distinctly heard at least one objet d'art shatter as he blasted by it.  It was probably rare, antique, and expensive, and would take hours' worth of negotiating with art dealers to replace; Tony ignored the sound, and flew faster.
"That's a useful trick." She didn't say thank you, probably because Steve, in her shoes, would be worried that his phone was going to either be damaged by Tony's hacking, or simply self-destruct when he tried to turn it off. He'd seen the promotional material for the StarkPhone; it wasn't cheap, especially the super-thin little black models like that one.
After a few long moments during which all of the victims of the toxin failed to move, Tony let himself relax, hunching forward to ease the ache in his lungs. Hank's antidote really did work, it seemed, even if the part of him that had seen one too many horror movies kept expecting one of the men or women who had been affected to suddenly sit up and try to bite someone.
Tony's eyes narrowed, and he backed up a step, fists at the ready. "If I close with you, you'll just use the
"Just because she doesn't remember that she has powers doesn't mean she isn't using them unconsciously. People don't just lose all their memories, not in real life, not unless there's something they need to forget. Maybe she recognized you on some level, and because she didn't want to remember, she just, I don't know, made you go away."
"So," Tony said, voice very dry, "your entire sexual history with men consists of 'that one time you had pity sex with Jack Monroe?'"
"Something I can shoot," Clint said, locking his hands together and stretching his fingers out. "I can't wait."
"What did you do to him?" she demanded.  Mjolnir was still lying on the floor several yards behind Doom; he might have been able to teleport it here, but almost no one other than Thor was able to lift it by hand.  If he'd had the hammer with him, then Don had been Thor when Doom had taken him, and Thor didn't turn back into Don involuntarily anymore.  Simply taking Mjolnir away wouldn't have done it.
It hit the floor in a clatter of metal, the sound almost swallowed up by the ringing clang from across the hall.
"Neither did I." The cat gave one more high-pitched growl then subsided into long-suffering silence, clearly having given up. Steve scratched it behind one ear with a gloved finger. "See, if you hold him long enough, he eventually calms down."
“I can try,” Steve muttered, knowing he was being childish.  The short, greying man currently standing by the buffet table was one of the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and Steve strongly suspected that he was the specific trustee he had argued with over the phone and through email for most of a week.
"That's because you dressed me like a doll," Hank was saying, as she straightened the collar of his shirt. "I still don't see what was wrong with the blue tie."
"Maybe," Tony said, offering Steve a smile of his own. Yes, coffee would be good. "I should take a shower first, though. I have to leave in an hour." The process of dismantling the SHRA and revamping the Initiative had not gone as smoothly as they might have hoped; the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security had dragged their heels every step of the way, and Henry Gyrich had requested that Tony come to DC to light a fire under those officials who were reluctant to give up the notion of a government-controlled superhuman army.
Wanda had both hands pressed to the side of her head, her face twisted in pain. If Chthon was able to overwhelm her as well...
Tony's lips twitched, but the look in his eyes was far from amused. "Steve, you flinched. You didn't even want to look at me."
Carol made a noncommittal sound.  She didn’t need to ask for further details; superheroes were as familiar with casualties and hospital vigils as soldiers, and Carol had been both.  She didn’t try to offer reassurances, either.
"Expensive," Tony told him.  "Jan?  Carol?"  He tried to raise the others through the communicator in his helmet, and got only static and interference.  Something was jamming the signal.  Something that didn't register on his armor's sensors, and didn't interfere with any other electronics.  The Extremis didn't seem to be affected by it either, but the situation wasn't desperate enough to warrant completely breaking his word to Steve.
"Run yourself into the ground until you collapse. It's not good for you, it's not good for your company, and it's not good for the team."
"You searched the rest of the room, too, right?" Steve asked, the thought of Bucky overhearing some of the things he'd spent the past few weeks doing with Tony throwing him off just enough that one of Tony's blows slipped past his guard, catching him on the shoulder.
Steve moved at the same time he did, both of them charging Sin, Steve from behind and Tony from her lame side.
Right. There was one piece of luck. Sam donned his own gas mask, then dislodged a disgruntled Redwing talon-by-talon from his shoulder. "Sorry, buddy. We don't have any masks in your size." Redwing informed him that if something jumped Sam while he wasn't there to watch his back, it would Sam's fault, and that he was going to go back up to the roofline to watch the humans' pathetic attempts at flight some more.
The quinjet's engine cut off, and the door opened, revealing Wanda, dressed in costume and with a duffle bag in one hand. Next to her was Hank.
She was down there with Don, he reminded himself. It wasn't like he was going to be cornering her while she was alone. If she wanted him to leave, if being too close to him scared her or made her nervous, all she'd have to do was say so, and he'd be gone, twice as fast as Hank had left.
She couldn't think of a more terrible use of her powers, save for mass slaughter. To strip people's mutations away – it was like rape, like mutilation. And to do it to all mutantkind came sickeningly close to genocide, in intent if not in actuality.
The silence stretched long enough to be painful, long enough for Clint to remember exactly what Bobbi's face had looked like when Mephisto's fireball had hit her in the back. He didn't really remember dying, or whether or not it had hurt, and he wasn't about to ask Cap about it, but he suspected that the answer was yes, that it hurt a lot.
As she went from room to empty room, the conviction that she was not alone only grew. "This isn't right," she whispered to herself in growing frustration. "I shouldn't be here."
The silence stretched out, just long enough to be awkward and for Steve to again consider apologizing for bringing the topic of death up at all.
A hand wrapped around his wrist, crushingly tight, and Loki's fist hit his face so hard that he saw white for a moment.
"That's the only other time I was ever mad at the Witch." Clint shrugged slightly. "I don't know the whole story, she didn’t tell me until after everything was over. Apparently there was a while there, right after Tony stopped drinking, when Rhodey was having some kind of issues. Wanda saw him haul off and slug Tony once."
Everyone had been  entirely unreasonable about that, although in retrospect, now that Steve  knew that Tony had wanted things between them to be serious from the  beginning, his objections made a lot more sense.  "Just because Hank  can't dance…" Steve began.
