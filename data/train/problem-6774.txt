All of last week's comments will be replied to soon. Thank you for commenting and making me smile!
Tony smiled. He didn't know who was around that Steve needed to play undercover husband for, but Tony liked that nickname. He wished he used it more often.
Steve was always so quick to play the Good Guy card as if they were a big happy team that could do anything with the power of friendship. Tony was always the one made into a bad guy. “I don’t care what you do. If you want to, go for it. If you don’t, then don’t.”
Peter felt his face burn red. Did

"I panicked!" Steve said, his good mood out the window. "I told you I needed to use the restroom, and you refused to stop for over two hours, and then had me getting your bags. I was a little preoccupied."
Steve glanced over his shoulder warily before taking Peter’s hand. “Please call me Steve.”
Instead, Tony leaned in too, and their lips were so close to touching until he heard a quiet gasp from somewhere behind them.
"You heard Fury. He wants us to draw them out. We're getting them angry. Whoever seems most suspicious about the crash is probably our suspect." Steve turned his plate so his pile of chips was closer to Tony.
“You will do no such thing,” Tony snapped. He immediately regretted it when he saw Peter flinch. He didn’t want to actually live up to the name he was borrowing. “I’m sorry, Peter. I didn’t mean to snap. I just...I really did not want you involved in this mission, and now, I’ve got to explain to Fury about what happened and hope he has a solution.”
"I'm glad he has you. You have him. You both have each other…"
"Great," he said, trying not to sound too miserable. "Can't wait, kiddo."
So he did.
"My name is Edwin," Tony said, turning around. "You should start getting used to it for when we're around people."
His voice sounded so gentle that Tony couldn’t say no to him. Even if they were arguing, though Tony had no idea what about anymore. He stood up, unable to hold Steve’s eyes contact for longer than a second. “I’m sorry.”
"I can be a freelance artist working on commissions at home--."
Because Steve already knew he was mentally and emotionally abusive. That much was obvious.
“I don’t care,” Tony said. “You’re not his father. I say no, and that’s final.”
This chapter...has like none of what I planned on it being. I crossed off two bullet points in my notebook for chapter four, added an entire scene that has to be written in chapter five, and then probably, the rest of the original chapter four will be in chapter six. And still, this chapter is 8k words long. I love writing.
"He's in his room," Tony said. "Which is actually the reason I'm calling."
Steve's hand was suddenly on his shoulder, and damn, he was fast. Tony thought he had only just left with Peter. "Wake up, Tony. Do I need to carry you too?"
“We spoke on the battlefield,” Seve said, glancing over to Peter as if he was trying to see if he had the same hostile reaction as Tony did. Peter made sure to keep the smile on his face. “He said he was from Queens. I recognized his voice.”
“Do not threaten my son,” Steve said. “Now leave.”
wasn’t how he wanted the night to go.
Steve felt bad for Peter...the kid was humiliated by mistaking Steve and Tony for his real parents, and Tony probably wouldn't let him forget it any time soon.
Someone liked Peter, and not just anyone, but
He turned around and took Steve's hands in his effortlessly. He lowered one of Steve's hands around his waist. His hand was rigid until Tony said, "Relax, Steve."

While Steve and Peter were out for their run, Tony decided to drop their new boat at a nearby marina. His original plan of donating it was destroyed after Peter suggested, yet again last night, that they all go out on it one day soon.
Peter brushed one of his curls off his forehead and out of his eyes. He needed a haircut. He probably looked so stupid. Harry was going to laugh at him. How hadn’t he laughed at him already? Why was he giving Peter a chance? What did he see in him?
In Tony's dream, he had been carried to bed by Steve. He could carry him to bed after he was up too long in the lab and Tony was being stubborn. He could carry him to bed because he was too excited to have sex that he needed to get them in there fast. He could carry him to bed when Tony fell asleep on the couch and he was too tired to walk back into their room.
Tony was right behind him as he ran in and ended his conversation on the phone. They were side by side dressing frantically in their bedroom.
“Yeah,” Steve said quietly. “Me too.”
“A motorcycle? Wow. You must have been real nice to him last night for a thank you gift like that.” Thomas elbowed Steve with a loud laugh.
Tony groaned. "I'll see him later. Even though he's got no reason to be pissed. He scared the shit outta me, and he'd be safer anywhere else."
Also, one of the songs they dance to on the boat together is "So Close" by Jon McLaughlin. Go listen to it and close your eyes, imagining Steve and Tony in the moment dancing together. If you do that after you leave a review, come back to tell me what you felt while imagining that.
Peter pulled a face as he shut the door behind him, throwing his backpack on the large bed. “Why do you gotta make it weird? He’s not gonna try strangling me in my sleep or anything. He’s Captain America.”
Even when Harry reassured Peter he was safe, he still didn't relax. He was tense throughout the movie until Tony slipped his fingers through his hair and began to scratch his scalp gently.
He was trying to think of what they'd need when they started this charade by himself since Tony wasn't bothering to brainstorm with him. He'd tell the neighbors he was a freelance artist working from home, and Tony could be a high school science teacher. That would explain why they'd never go into work a day that summer.
“This is Spider-Man. The one you brought to Germany,” Steve explained, stepping closer to Peter.
He pulled out his phone as Peter started saying goodbye to May and texted Steve.
Tony jumped at the sudden music, and Steve caught him quickly before he fell into the pool. It was a reflex to save him, but it was a second later when Steve realized his hands were holding Tony up by his ass and he was pressing him close to his chest-- and was that-- oh yeah...Tony was definitely just as into this as Steve was.
After a good ten minutes of May struggling to catch her breath through laughter, she let Tony explain why he was looking the way he did. Then after another hour of explaining the mission, and their new predicament, May drilled him with a million questions.
Sorry for the later than usual update! I spent yesterday moving to my new apartment from 04:00 to 22:00 without even a break for food. I'm feeling a little bit rested today. Just terribly homesick lol and trying to find things to distract myself with.
Steve shifted, relaxing his hand and curling it around Tony's waist perfectly. Tony held back the shiver.
He sat on the loveseat, Netflix ready, and Steve sat next to him a few moments later. Their bodies were flush, and if Tony got a little tired later, Steve's shoulder was the perfect height for him to rest his head.
His dad had mocked him for weeks but not in the teasing tone Tony used on Peter. He was mean and cruel.
Dream Steve hushed him softly just as he had done for Peter as he tucked him into bed. Then he crawled into the bed beside him, but he didn't come hold him like he was supposed to.
“Did we make it worse?” Peter asked, biting his lip nervously. “I just wanted to help him.”
Tony sat on the couch and patted the spot next to him. "Come sit next to Dad."
"Maybe we just give him time to cool down?" Steve didn't sound any more certain that Tony did. "I have zero experience with teenagers, except for when I was one...and when I felt like that, I just wanted to be left alone."
Tony's eyes widened at Steve's innocent smile. Tony wondered if Steve knew what Netflix and Chill really meant. "Honestly? I'd love to Netflix and Chill."
He rolled over and found Dream Steve easily. He tucked himself in Dream Steve's arms and cuddled in his chest.
“I’m not going to get kidnapped. I’m--.”
"I need to use the restroom," he said, looking Norman in the eyes as he spoke.
"He misses you too," Tony told her, though she probably already knew that.
Steve and Peter were home and showered. Not that Tony was surprised; it took him a few hours to get the boat set up.
Peter gasped, and his voice was a little louder than normal. His ears were probably still adjusting to the volume change. "You've never heard
Hello! Just a reminder that I'm now updating twice a week, so if you missed the update on Friday, make sure to read that before coming here!!
“I lied,” he said.
"Thank you. I better keep running before he wakes up, but I'll see you around soon, Roger. Have a good day!" She started to jog off and Steve waved with a smile.
Was that wrong of him? Probably...he shouldn't mix his work with pleasure. To Tony, this might just be a show, and Steve couldn't afford having him and then losing him. It would hurt more than anything in the entire world.
“It’s alright, Mr. Stark,” Peter said, giving him a small smile. Tony didn’t deserve Peter. He didn’t think anyone did, really. “I know you’ve got a lot going on. I won’t be any trouble.”
Peter sang.
“He’s a lowlife, Peter. He will do whatever necessary to get what he wants, and frankly, I don’t know what that is with you.” Steve’s  knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel.
Peter nodded his head and insisted. “I
Growing up sick, Steve was used to embarrassing things happening without his control. It was a part of the sick kid package. So he knew exactly how bad Peter must have been feeling.
"But he's here now, and he's not leaving." Steve patted his back, letting his hand linger. "Might as well have much control as we can."
Harry smiled as he rubbed the back of his neck. “Alright...I thought…I wasn’t sure if you were enjoying it.”
May laughed. "Oh, are you finally seeing that side of him, then?"
“It’s late. You need to get to bed.”
Peter rolled his eyes. “Alright, Mr. Billionaire.”
Steve didn't seem to mind though, even when there was a perfectly fine couch that could fit them both easily a few feet away.
Steve didn't even turn to look at him, but Tony could see a smile on his face in the corner of his eyes.
"You have a very good son," Steve added with a genuine smile. "You should be proud."
“Sir, are you sure there is nothing that you can do?”
It didn’t feel like it solved their disagreement. Tony still felt like the air between them was tense. But at least, it was a start.
Peter didn’t approve, but he was a little satisfied when Steve told him that he wouldn’t go through with it. Tony was going to stop him. Steve was sure of it. Peter was hesitant to let it go, but he didn’t continue to argue with him through their jog.
Their eyes never looked away from each other as they danced. Steve held him close and as the singing stopped and the music slowed, he leaned in closer. Ever so slightly.
Comments will be replied to tomorrow morning! I just got home from work so I edited it once and then I'm crashing.
Writing this chapter was like pulling teeth. Nothing seemed to work or and flow right. I'm not sure if it's because the chapter is just so bad or if it's because I'm a little rusty after my writing hiatus (only a week but I'm dramatic). I'm sorry for the disappointment, but next chapter will be better!
"Are you about to swim in your boxers?" Steve asked, wondering why he was too lazy to just go inside and get changed or why he didn’t come out in a bathing suit in the first place.

“Someone like

“M’not ‘barassin’ myself,” Peter muttered before promptly leaning forward and vomiting. He almost fell forward into it until Harry caught him.
Rolling his eyes, Norman said, "People call anything child abuse these days."
until this is over. Don’t think I was joking about grounding you,” he said in a voice not unlike the one he used after the ferry incident.
“Ah, yes. Let’s just invite the bad guy to our home.”
He didn’t know why Klaus hated him so much, but that was the only problem he had in this town. He didn’t need to wrapped in bubble wrap and locked in his room.
"Great idea, kiddo, if you hadn't invited Mr. Douche to dinner," Tony said pointedly as he raised his eyebrows.
Well,
"It's fine," he said quickly. "I just...don't want to talk about all that anymore. Please."
"You can. Come on. Just relax...feel the music and let yourself move to it," Tony instructed.
“Oh, I can't wait,” Peter said with a grin.
Peter started arguing just as Tony shut the door. Tony grinned smugly as he walked back towards the kitchen where Steve was waiting. He was just finishing one of their sandwiches when Tony returned. He had made a half dozen because he and Peter needed so much to eat each meal.
“We don’t know for sure, Peter,” Steve replied. “I’d rather be safe than sorry when it comes to you.”
"I am," Steve said, returning the smile. "Just moved in with my husband down the block."
"Maybe it'll be good for you," Peter said in an uncharacteristically quiet voice. "It's been a few months since Germany and things have been...weird."
They still got the chance to play family, but now they had to host Norman. Steve wasn't sure if the guy was physically abusive, but the idea had him worried. Abusive people didn't take very well to people confronting them or trying to control them. The last thing he wanted to do was make home life worse for Harry. But Peter was right; they couldn't ignore Harry if he needed help.
“Of course,” Norman said, nodding his head.
“Why are you so harsh on him?”
"I'm not coming out until you leave," Peter said, making Tony's smile falter. He tried not to let that bother him.
Tony wasn't sure why he offered that. Steve didn't know May, and he wasn't as involved in Peter's life as Tony was. But maybe part of Tony wanted him to be? And by the way Steve hesitated, it seemed he wanted to be as well.
“And that means I can give you the full blown teenage angst and attitude,” Peter said while rolling his eyes dramatically. He opened the door and stepped outside. It was humid outside, and wherever they were was somewhere by the water. Peter hadn’t been to the beach in years. He hoped he could convince Tony to take a trip to one while they were here. He’d heard that Long Island beaches were gorgeous.
“Uh…”
Peter continued to sing, trying to get Tony to dance too. Tony wasn't drunk enough to dance as wildly as the kid was.
"So whoever is most surprised by you two being alive is probably the culprit?"
“He’ll wake up at any time when he smells food,” Tony said. “You make it, and he’ll come running.”
Peter groaned loudly. “I can’t stay cooped up here all day long. I need to leave the house.”
Tony didn’t go to his own seat until Peter was in the back and buckled up. Then they started the drive back to their home. Peter didn’t waste a second before he quickly said, “I wasn’t stealing it!”
Harry, of course, voiced his displeasure with Peter, but Peter ignored him. Then he decided to give up trying to stop him and instead stay nearby to make sure he wouldn’t get into trouble.
“I’m being serious. Just...stay out of trouble. Please. If you only ever keep yourself from bad guys one time, let it be this time.” Tony was pleading now, and Peter felt bad.
Harry followed him as he went over to the large bowl of what looked like fruit punch. From a few feet away, Peter could smell it was obviously more than fruit punch. He grabbed a cup from the stack and filled it up without a pause of hesitation.
Thank you so much again. I would not be here today with so much support without all of you.
“Benjamin, if you’re weirded out-- I’m sorry-- I’ll just leave.”

mission.”
Steve couldn't help but laugh and join the conversation, "I dunno 'bout that, Queens."
“Anyway, you are my son from another relationship. Girlfriend died or whatever.” Tony waved his hand. “No relationship whatsoever to my new husband. Don't even talk to each other."
“Don’t give up. Tony’s stubborn, but he’s worth fighting for.” Peter smiled up at him smally. “I’ll try talking to him too.”
Norman gave him a shocked look as if he didn't expect Peter to hear him. The shock turned to anger almost instantly. "What are you implying, boy?"
“Shit,” he muttered, still not able to tear his eyes completely off of Tony. They kept dancing back to Tony.
“Oh, my God. Tony Stark just called me his
"Maybe. But right now, I’m mad,” Peter grumbled, walking close to Harry’s tree. He stopped when he started to hear a faint sound of music. “Do you hear that?”
"You don't. Now poke your head out and eat." Tony tapped right next to the plate.
“Mr. Stark!”
"Yeah," Peter snapped. "I'm fine."
“Is that a yes?”
After breakfast, Tony still wasn't awake, so he slipped outside and started his walk. It was reaching a normal hour now, half past eight, so there were others outside at least.
When he got back home--
Norman didn't argue as he filled his plate with some vegetables and meat from the other platters. Harry waited until Norman told him he could eat before he started to serve himself.

He froze in the middle of pouring Peter’s orange juice as he watched Tony stumble his way to the coffee mug that was waiting for him at the perfect temperature. Steve knew that hadn’t been the shirt Tony fell asleep in. He had actually been shirtless, which surprised Steve up until he saw him in his shirt. That was more wild than having
"How was he?" Steve asked, putting the bread on top of the cold cuts.
"Hello?"
Tony had known the moment that Steve ran out the door that morning that he wasn’t really going to find his phone somewhere. Steve didn’t just leave his phone places, especially on a job, and his phone was sitting on the counter where he left it.
So far nothing had happened, but they had only just sat down for dinner.
“It’s okay. I’m just gonna call your dad, okay? Can I have your phone?”
“I know,” Harry said, coming closer, looking nervous. “I’m sorry.”
“You didn’t have to tell him I got you a present,” Tony said.
Peter’s eyes widened as he tried to think of what he could have done wrong. "What’s wrong? Why don't you want to kiss me?”
Steve's face softened. "He did?"
Tony whirled around to Klaus with a glare that rivaled Steve's. "Why is my child restrained?"
“You’re not Spider-Man here. And I don’t want you taking on Hydra alone.”

encouraged it."
Peter's next words were almost carefully planned, it sounded like. "The new version of the Accords is good. It satisfies both sides. Even you admitted that. What's still an issue?"
what he was doing.
"Yes," Tony said. "It'll help you find your rhythm. I mean, we both just heard Peter. What's worse than that?"
"I'm going out. You are already suffocating me to the point of wanting to commit a murder-suicide in this house. So chill out, Captain Bossy. I need space." He disappeared into the hallway, slamming the bedroom door shut.
Steve sighed. “Just come to bed. You don’t have to stay out here all night.”
“I thought we already discovered Evalyn is Hydra. Isn’t that why Steve’s going over there.”
Aahhhh the ending😭 I am going to miss these guys SM. I don't have a sequel planned, even though I know so many of you were interested. Who knows! Maybe I'll have more inspiration for another installment later. I genuinely don't have one planned, but if there's enough interest from you and me, who knows!!!
His shower was quick, just long enough to wash the sweat off of his body, and then he was grabbing his clothes off of the shower stall door and getting dressed. It was a little cramped, but he wasn’t too comfortable with getting dressed in the middle of the backyard.
Peter and Tony stood in silence for a long moment before Tony’s tense shoulders relaxed with a heavy sigh.
“I’ll make sure he calls to apologize tomorrow,” Tony told him. “He should not have put you through this.”
"Well, what are
So many of you guessed sex dungeon. Nice job. I mean...is anyone surprised?
“I know that. But, you give him the idea that it’s okay, and I don't want to encourage it for my own son. Maybe it’s best if our children stopped seeing each other.”
Also just as I love casual inclusion of aspec characters, I also love casual inclusion of adhd. Maybe I project a Lil too much.  Who cares!! It's fanfic.

The two of them jumped apart, a little breathless, and stared at each other.
“Yeah…” Harry said, still seeming nervous.
"You need to come to town." Came the immediate reply, his German accent making the caller obvious.
"It's nothing to be embarrassed about," Steve started to say. "Bullying is--."
Steve laughed, and Tony's smile only grew.
"Of course, he does," Tony answered instead.
speak to me like that because he knows if he did, he'd regret it."
Harry was quiet for a moment, and Peter waited for him to shove him away. But he didn’t. “We can talk about that later, okay?”
“Really? Not even a hint?”
“Wow, you’re really not a morning person, are you, Queens?” Steve started to dish out some of the scrambled eggs to Peter’s plate and then placed it in front of the sleepy teenager.
The crowd that had gathered around him while he drank cheered. Peter smiled as some of them patted his back and clapped, encouraging him to drink another. He had never been this well-liked within a group of people before as anyone other than Spider-Man. This was what it felt like to be normal.
“I was just looking.”

“We know, Pete,” Tony said, meeting his eyes in the rear view mirror.
So, Steve had a crisis about seeing Tony in one of his t-shirts that morning and responded to it by running out of the house and buying a motorcycle.
“And you didn’t think to call me about this purchase or even, I don’t know, wait until you were dressed properly?” Tony didn’t even know why he was angry. He bought a boat for Christ’s sake. He’d be a hypocrite if he was angry at Steve for doing the same thing he did.
“No thank you, Dad,” he said, throwing one last glare at Norman before leaving.
Norman looked over to Steve. “You’re okay with this?”
"Oh, definitely. Unless I wanna go poke the bear, I'm gonna stay
Steve slammed open the door and before long, Klaus popped his head out of a doorway at the sound.
"So what do we do now, genius?" Tony asked. "Do we go out and test the reactions?"
“Ben?”
Steve didn’t come home until later that night. Tony didn’t care. He didn’t. He just hid in the garage and did some work for Stark Industries to avoid thinking about Steve. It didn’t work though. He tormented himself for hours thinking about how Steve cared about Peter, and about how close he had been to kissing the man this morning.
“Hopefully, he is,” Tony grumbled. “He starts puking, I won’t be far behind him.”
"Any is fine," Steve said, standing up.
“Stay? Ben, no way. You don’t drink, and your dads will kill you if they find out.”
Yeah, it sounded pretty stupid to Tony to, but he wasn’t sure what else would be the reason. He had spent the entire afternoon thinking about it when he was interrupted by the sound of a motorcycle engine coming up in front of the house.
“I don’t want Peter on that bike,” Tony said again after a moment. “I don’t care how safe you drive.”
Steve pointedly ignored him as he continued, "And you could be a high school teacher-- science or maybe a technology class-- on summer break."
Tony pulled out his phone and clicked May's contact. Part of the deal to let Peter stay with them was keeping her in the loop and always giving her an option to reach them. She had both Peter and Tony's undercover phone numbers.
“If you gotta throw up, tell me, bud,” Steve said. “You gotta get it all out.”
“I wanted to see what you were into. See if you had any clues around while I was in here.”
“Goo’ mornin’,” Peter grumbled, sleepily leaning his chin on his hand. His eyes were already closed again.
Steve knew that Tony was a complicated person. Nothing was going to change that, not even living with the man for a few weeks. Sometimes, Steve thought he hated him; other times they were friends; on rare occasions, Steve thought maybe Tony wanted to be more than friends; and then, sometimes, Steve had no idea what he was feeling for Steve.
Harry pulled away from Peter, watching him closely.
Steve looked down in his glass as he swirled the orange juice around. He didn’t want either of them to see the disappointment on his face.
I can’t wait to tell Ned and MJ.”
i love harry sm
Thank you for all of the love and support! I'll answer reviews from the last chapter sometime soon!
Steve didn't say a word either.
Peter didn't leave his room the next day. Tony didn't care; he actually preferred for the kid to sulk in his room so he could heal from the possible concussion without getting himself into more trouble.
Peter immediately turned to pout. "Hey…"
"No! I was just looking!" Peter insisted. "I didn't steal anything!"
“You don’t need to take me to bed like I’m a child,” Ton replied. “I’m fine here. Don’t worry about me, Rogers.”
“Benjamin Peter Stevens,” Tony said, seeming to come to the same conclusion as Steve did. “Why don’t you go take a walk and calm down?”
Peter thought it was sweet that he remembered his voice even though that had been months ago. He took a step from behind Tony so he could actually shake Steve’s hand. “It’s fine, Mr. Stark.”
Tony rested his arm on the back of the couch as the movie started, and the singing began already. His fingers brushed Steve's hair as his hand settled and he found himself absent-mindedly playing with the end of his locks, curling them around his fingers.
I had a scene written in this chapter...the pool scene...a year ago. That was the first thing written for this fic.
"Good. So how are you three? Is Pete there?"
“There’s a lot of people I didn’t think you’d ever hurt,” Tony said, making the silence in the room so tense that Peter was feeling uncomfortable almost immediately. “Yet, here we are.”
“Oh, please,” Norman said with narrowed eyes. “I’m just raising him to be a man. You should take some hints. Then, maybe your son won’t be running around in makeup and a dress one day.”
"Not all of it's about the Accords, kid."

Peter continued to stare, blinking his eyes a few times.
Sharing clothing was a romantic thing, usually. Though, it could be platonic too like when he had borrowed Rhodey’s clothes back in college some nights because had the comfiest sweats or when Peter borrowed his sweatshirts in the lab because he got too cold. That wasn’t romantic, but it was something

Steve didn't reply, but they got into the car together, and Steve started driving to the small town where some shops owned by the neighborhood residents were. Klaus owned a antique store that he'd heard some of their neighbors mention, so they pulled up in front of that store.
"And you don't scare me," Tony returned.
"This isn't Broadway!" Peter insisted. "We
“Don’t worry about it, Cap. It’s no problem.” Tony waved his hand because it really shouldn’t have been a problem. Tony shouldn’t care if Steve was sleeping with someone on the mission. Steve betrayed him. Steve was bad. Steve didn’t matter.
"Did Harry say if he was okay?" Stevs asked, following Tony as he ran out of the bedroom.
Steve loved the movie, and not just because Tony was playing with his hair through it. The music was great, and so was the story. Steve loved the message of being yourself and finding a family that lifted you up. The Avengers were once that family.
Tony pulled the phone from his ear and cupped the microphone end. "Ben's drunk at a party in the woods with Harry."
Norman grunted before grabbing Harry by the arm to yank him out of the house. Peter intended to follow after them to get Norman to loosen his hold on Harry, but before he could go, Tony grabbed his hand and pulled him to his side. Steve glanced at them before following Harry and Norman.
“I needed some air, so I ran. Found myself at a Harley Davidson store. I wanted the bike the moment I saw her. I gave them your credit card.”
I'm in the middle of writing the last chapter; I expect to finish it tomorrow, and I'm so sad to be saying goodbye to this universe:(
“I’ll take you out, Pete,” Tony offered. He was glad that Peter made such a good friend while staying here, but he didn’t like that it was in a place where Tony didn’t trust a damn soul. “I don’t want you going places alone by that man. If it means staying out of town, then so be it.”
“We’re done. You’re done. I don’t want you over here again,” Norman said, snapping his fingers. “Get over here.”
“Sure--.”
He was so distracted by
Later that night, they all ended up on the couch again. They let Steve pick the movie this time, and he chose a film that had been on his list for a long time. Tony wasn't familiar with it, but it wasn't bad.
If you're interested in more Superfamily stories, don't don't I've got more planned! New long fics like this, fics for other series, and new ficlets too! I hope you come back to read those too!
"He's never drank before, Steve. He chooses now to sneak out and get drunk? After someone tried
Tony said, gesturing to them.
Whenever they seemed to be going one step forward, they took ten steps back. They were absolutely infuriating, but Peter refused to give up on them.
"I get it if you're not as endowed as you claim you are, but I won't judge you for that. I married you for your personality and your ass, not the size of your--."
“I’m 16. I’m old enough to understand what could make you hate him so much if you just told me why!” Peter didn’t want to get into an argument with Tony when they were both forced to stay under the same roof together, but he didn’t want to be treated like a baby either.
"You're a billionaire."
"What're you two even listening to?"
"Ben!" Steve said as he slammed the door open harder than necessary. It probably dented his wall.
“No. You know what seems ridiculous to me, Peter? The fact that I”m the adult in this conversation, and you’re the child yet you’re arguing with me. What I say is final. I am the adult. I am
“I’m not going to touch you, Benjamin,” Harry said in a lower voice.
“Yeah. Shopping is definitely on the list,” Tony grumbled, though he sounded more tired than grumpy. “Still gotta make sure we’re all on the same page for this whole undercover family bullcrap.”
“Alright. I trust you, Tony.”
He went around to the trunk and popped it open, while still looking around him. He couldn’t wait to go explore the neighborhood the next morning. Tony came around the back to help him carry some of his bags. He didn’t have a lot: just two suitcases and a backpack, but if Peter were a normal teenage boy like he was pretending to be, there was no way he’d be able to carry all of the bags in by himself.
“Oh,” Peter said, relaxing. “I see why.”
felt off, and his spidey sense didn’t let him ignore that. “Well, were you looking for something? ‘Cus you were looking--.”
“It’s none of your business. I told you not to get involved with this, but you persisted. Just leave it alone, okay?” Tony slammed his drawer shut a little harder than necessary. “I’m supposed to keep you safe while we’re here. I’m not letting him give you another black eye.”
with a child. "He's my son."
"But what if he's a brat and deserves it?"
Tony frowned. "This is nothing to laugh at. He was fine. Singing and dancing one second, and then the next, he was snapping at us and storming to his room."
“We’ll talk about it,” Steve said instead.
"That's never happened before…" Tony said, unsure of what else he could say.
Thomas laughed but only because he thought Steve was joking around with him. “Funny man! I’ll see you later, boys.”
“Get out,” Steve said, his voice dripping venom. “Get out of my house right now.”
No one in the neighborhood that Tony had noticed owned a bike, so the sound definitely had him suspicious. He hurried to the front window and peeks through the blinds. He would have been worried about the bike pulling up into the driveway if he didn’t recognize the man riding it.
Tony nodded his head, even though they had a dozen other things to do. They should do more research or call Fury or think of a plan. Literally anything else. But Steve almost died yesterday. Tony almost lost him. If they wanted to spend the afternoon watching a movie, they should be allowed to.
“Where’s Captain Rogers’ room?” Peter asked curiously. “Why does he have to sleep on the couch?”
Steve couldn't help it when his face softened. He always had a soft spot for babies and kids. He grew up wanting at least three of his own. That obviously was never going to happen now, but the yearning to be a father never really faded. "How old is he?"
"For what?"
“No ‘but’s, son,” Steve said, not rudely. His voice was firm but gentle. “It’ll help you.”
Just barely, Tony heard Peter blowing a raspberry underneath the blanket. He rolled his eyes and walked out of his room.
Tony realized with a startle that he wasn't thinking of just any run of the mill gorgeous hunk of muscle. He was thinking about a very specific tall, muscled, blond hair, blue eyed man...and this specific man had just given him plenty more of ideas when he rolled up the driveway on that bike.
"'Cus your dad is home and I'm grounded, so we've got to sneak away. Your spot in the tree is the only safe place I know," Peter said, peddling his bike next to Harry.
Steve followed Norman and Harry once Tony had Peter. He made sure Norman left so he could slam the door on his face. Harry hesitated before leaving the house. “Thanks, Mr. Stevens...for everything.”
Tony groaned as he turned to face Peter, who was sitting in the passenger seat with a shit eating grin on his face. “You think you’re in this? Nope. No way Aunt Hottie says yes, and she can definitely override Fury.”
“Is that bike to show off to your girlfriend or something?” He spat, and Tony wasn’t sure why
Tony pushed Peter inside until the door was shut behind them. It was like he didn’t even trust him around Thomas either. Peter could handle himself! Peter pulled himself from Tony’s hold when they were inside, but Tony didn’t even seem to notice.
Steve said he'd be out there if he changed his mind, but Steve doubted he would come out. So he went outside for a night swim by himself while Peter hid and Tony was tinkering with something in his makeshift lab.
Peter hurried down the hall to the room with a door open and the light on. This bedroom was three times the size of his room back in Queens. “Woah!”
"Oh, I am," she said warmly. "Letting him go for so long is killing me. I miss my baby."
of them had to move their lips for it to be considered a kiss.
"Oh, yeah." Peter deflated.
When it ended, Steve was disappointed. It was time to get up and destroy the idea of their own little family. No more Tony playing with his hair, and no more Peter curled between them as he hummed along to the music.
Steve wasn't even sure how he heard about that. He doubted that Harry would have told him. But this was a small community, and everyone somehow knew everything about everybody.
Tony saw the gears turning in Peter's mind, and he expected something crazy, but when Peter offered his hand, all he said was, “Benjamin.”
“Peter!”
There was a beat of hesitation before Dream Steve kissed the top of his head. "I love you too, sweetheart."
When it came time for the song to finally end, Tony lowered the volume on the record player until it was almost muted.
"Same difference."
"So kinda like you before your morning coffee, huh?" Steve teased with a smile that made butterflies flutter in his stomach.
“Peter, just...stay away from him as much as you can please. I don’t want you getting involved.”
It was a quiet night, and he was so glad that Evalyn wasn't around to ruin that.
"Stealing is no joking matter."
“I bought the bike because I wanted a bike, Tony,” Steve said, keeping his voice even. “I saw her, and I wanted her. That’s it.”
He had his own sweatpants on, but the shirt was enough to short circuit Steve’s brain.
"We're headed to bed now," Dream Steve said as they walked. Tony nuzzled his face against Steve's chest and he didn't care what Thomas said about him having boobs, Tony loved them.
At the door, Tony stuck his keys in the lock and swung the door open. “Honey, I’m home!” He called sarcastically.
"He said he wanted to go for a bike ride. I wasn't going to tell him no."
Peter rolled his eyes. "That's my
He had never experienced anything like this before, growing up in Brooklyn during the Depression and then waking up to another war. For a moment, he could just walk around the block and have a normal life like the one he always wanted.
“I have no problem,” he said, though he could list a dozen off the top of his head. “Have fun, Cap. At least one of us is going to get some action on this mission.”
Peter wasn’t sure what Steve was thinking, but he knew it probably wasn’t good. “Mr. Stark was really against it, but both Director Fury and my aunt were okay with it. We didn’t wanna risk ruining the operation.”
Steve could see
That meant Peter was in trouble. Steve pulled himself out of the water, not bothering to cover himself up anymore. He'd been naked before in front of dozens of men in the Army. It was different in front of Tony, but if Peter needed help, he wasn't going to hesitate.
“Are you even worried about me being around Hydra or only Steve? Because it seems more like the latter, and that’s a little ridiculous if you ask me.” Peter was great at teenage sass, though he’d never really laid it on Tony.
He was being laid down before he was done admiring Dream Steve's chest and he let out a whine.
Tony was angry because he wanted to be, but he wasn’t.
I am so sad to say goodbye to these boys, and I'm sure you are too. Thank you for joining me through this story! Please leave your thoughts one last time!!
was normal. “Let’s go sit somewhere quiet while you relax.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “Please don’t remind me.”
"Yes, I did," Peter said quickly. "It was me. No one else."
“That’s Steve’s,” Tony answered, and Peter knew something was wrong by his tone. “He bought it this morning because he wanted to.”
Steve grabbed Tony by the shoulders to stop him before he ran out the door. "You need to take a deep breath. Peter is with Harry. He's going to be okay until we get there, but you need to relax first."
“Nope,” Tony cut him off. “You’re not. No powers whatsoever. Never ever. Whoever is here will keep tabs on everyone moving in they don’t know, which includes us. I don’t want them linking you to Spider-Man.”
As he sang, his movement turned more graceful.
“I wouldn’t be any less proud of him if he did,” Tony said. “How he chooses to dress will never make me love him any less.”
Tony grunted when Peter's weight was gone from his side. His arm was tingling from pins and needles after being asleep for so long during his nap.
“Our daughter?” Steve repeated, feeling his Irish temper rise to the surface. He didn’t want to be like his father, but he couldn’t stand for this. He looked over at Tony. “Did he just call our son our
"It's alright," he said. "Let's just let him relax and listen to some music. Maybe he'll come out when he hears it, or even if he just lays in his room and listens. My music always calmed me down when I was younger. My ma would play it when I was sick. Even when I was incoherent, I could hear the music."
"Tony, aren't you going to wash that?"
He finished his shower anyway without any problems and made sure he was dressed before he left the bathroom, just in case Tony was awake. But when he stepped into the kitchen with damp hair and clean clothes, he was nowhere to be seen.
May picked up after a few rings and sounded happy to hear from him. "Hey, Tony!"
Peter groaned and complained as Steve cradled him against his chest.
“What if I need to use my powers?” Peter pouted.
"Let me think...nope." Tony said, walking back to the hallway. "Sorry, Mom!"
Tony wasn't about to say that he'd dance all night with Steve, even before the serum, if it meant that they could end the night with Steve railing him. Nope. That would be just a little bit awkward.
"What? No."
"Grounded? What for?" Harry asked.
Harry had been over and having dinner with them, and he seemed surprised. Apparently, only Norman and his work friends were allowed on his boat. Peter had looked over at Tony with puppy eyes, and he immediately told Harry that he was welcome to join them on their first day on the water.
“Yeah. I thought it was already obvious we don’t like you, and I don't think you’re worth our time. Only reason why you’re here is because my son is friends with your son, and he’s worried about how he’s treated. You already confirmed his worries.”
but I think we've done a damn good job raising our son," Tony argued. The claws were out. Norman made a mistake by making a comment about Peter.
Thank you all for your continued support. I loooove getting reviews...especially these long ones some of you leave. It makes me so happy that you care enough about this fic to not only read and leave kudos but to also comment!
As it turned out, Peter wasn’t the trouble. Fury was.
Steve eyed him as he slid over his plate. "You better not be teasing that boy about what he said."
"We already
This chapter is a few days late for a few reasons...I originally had it ready to post last update day, but then a few hours before I realized a scene was missing that needed to be added. Then the last few days have been rough mentally and emotionally so I didn't get a chance to write even though that's what I do when I need to relax.
"Come sit!"
Tony nodded his head as he lowered the needle down carefully so he didn't pop Steve's vinyl. "Everyone needs a family."
Steve knew he was just taunting him, probably trying to get a rise out of him. Steve refused to give in. "Don't be like that. It'll be fine. It's easier for you to call me Roger anyway, since you seem to have reverted to a last name basis with me."
"Then what are you doing?" Steve eyed him as he shifted. He held his breath when Tony turned and swung a leg around Steve, kneeling on the pool bench with Steve between his legs. His knees were pressed against his hips, and Steve had to look up to see his face because he was sightline with his chest and belly. He tried not to think too much about what was just a few inches lower. Unfortunately, trying not to think about it was still thinking about it, and he felt his dick twitch.
“We'll keep an eye on him,” Tony promised, wrapping his arm around Peter to pull him in close. After a long day of too many emotions, it’s exactly what Peter needed, so he curled against him for a hug.
him? When we're on an undercover mission? I've seen the kid high on pain meds before, and he can't keep his mouth shut."
“As much as we would love to have you involved in our conversation, you aren’t really
"I woke up, and you were nowhere. We're undercover on a mission; you can't just go wandering off!" Tony snapped, searching through the cabinets for something. He was in sweats and a band t-shirt with messed up hair. He had just woken up, obviously grumpy with no coffee yet. Steve thought it was cute even if he was on the receiving end of Tony's mood.
“Oh, because I’m such a horrible person to deal with, huh?”
"Don't stress it," she said with another laugh. "And don't take it personally. I get that at least once a month. I'm surprised you've never seen it...he can get pretty angry."
I've also got my second road test tomorrow, so let's hope I pass this time and don't hit the curb again.
"Yeah? We'll see how long that lasts." Tony placed the plate on his nightstand along with the water bottle. "I brought you lunch. Your favorite. Peanut butter and jelly."
“Sounds like a good idea,” Tony said, rubbing his arm as he passed. “You want company, kiddo?”
Tony narrowed his eyes. "He snuck out when someone was trying to kill him and got drunk."
Steve smiled, tucking his thumbs into his belt loops like an old man. "Perfect. You can pick the movie, and I'll get the popcorn?"
Norman narrowed his eyes. “You want to keep your son away from the only friend he has? That doesn’t sound like good parenting.”
“I need to-- my phone. Lost it. Jogging.” Steve wasn’t sure if that made any sense, but he didn’t really care. He needed to go. So he ran out of the kitchen, through the living room, and out the house.
Tony smirked. "That lasted, what? Twenty seconds?"
"You know, I feel a little self conscious here. I'm the only one naked. You could at least take your suit off too."
This song was very upbeat and either had a set routine or Peter had choreographed his own. Between the music and Peter's (off-key) singing, it was loud in the house.
Peter took Harry by one of the hands and pulled him in closer, leaning up and puckering his lips. He continued leaning forward until he was pressing his lips against Harry’s. He remembered Harry liked to use tongue sometimes, so he tried to shove it between his lips. Within a moment of the start of their kiss, Harry was gently pushing Peter away.
“Did you really shower outside?”
“I just wanted to get a gift for Harry,” Peter said quietly. “He got me this cool shark necklace, and I wanted to get something for him.”
“Alright.”
So, he settled on, “You know...you don’t have to be so angry at Steve all the time.”
"See you later, Kyra!"
“Nope,” Tony said. “Past those gates I am no longer a billionaire. Can’t you tell from this shit car I’ve got?”
with seeing yours. I have a plan for his life, and I will not have your daughter ruining that.”
“Edwin bought her for me,” Steve told him, even though that wasn’t the case. Tony seemed just as surprised as Thomas did when hearing that.
you yesterday, and we're just sitting here, doing nothing." Tony furrowed his brow. "It doesn't feel right."
Peter still seemed tense, and Tony felt bad. He remembered how much he struggled with his own emotions at that age, and all he wanted was for his dad to make him feel heard and comforted.
Tony narrowed his eyes and threw open the front door, storming down the stoop. “Roger, what the hell do you think you’re doing?”
"There was a mix-up," Tony said. "Peter didn't steal anything."
Harry gave him a funny look. "I'm just worried about you. This isn't how you act, and I'm worried something is wrong.”
I'm dropping this as I fight a migraine so if there are mistakes please ignore them until I can fix them. I wil answer all comments on the last chapter tomorrow morning! Thank you all for the HUGE response last chapter! Your comments are so sweet and I've never the smiles they've been giving more than usual lately.
Steve only heard him because of his enhanced hearing, so he let it drop. He didn't want to start anything close to a brawl at dinner time. He glanced over to Tony to see if he heard anything, but he was smiling proudly over at him. Steve blushed and gave him a small smile back.
"He said he caught Peter stealing. We need to go before he calls the police." Tony huffed, trying to calm down. He didn't want to upset Peter when he saw him.
He didn’t have a destination in mind, but wherever it was, he was going to run the entire way there.
I wish I could keep you away from everyone, Harry included. But until then, I’m going to keep my family from you.”
Steve brought him his breakfast and told Tony he was quiet. Tony didn't doubt that he was probably nursing a headache, even though his concussion was healing at a much faster rate than any other human.
am, and I say that he will not be going on that thing. You shouldn’t even be on it like you were this morning.”
Steve sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Look, Tony, I don't want to fight on day one. Can we just figure out how to get along until we're done with this?"
Tony brought his and Peter's plates to the sink wordlessly. Steve stayed where he was, watching Tony walk towards where Peter just disappeared to. He paused before leaving though he didn't turn around. "Next time, just come in the room for a shower. Don't give the neighbors a show."
Tony drifted back to the unconscious part of dreamland with a smile on his face.
“It’s alright,” Steve said with a sigh. “He has every reason to be. I’ve hurt him, and I hoped we could work through it, but I’m not so sure anymore.”
"Watch how you speak to my son, or I will ensure you cannot speak any more." Steve held his hand out, palm up. "Now give me that key or else we'll have a problem here."
“You said he was acting weird,” Tony nted. “What was he doing?”
Tony snorted as he took a sip of his coffee.
that when he heard his voice for real a few hours later, he thought he was going insane.
Steve had acted so strangely. Once upon a time, when he had been in love with Pepper, seeing her in one of his science t-shirts had made his stomach do a million flips as he pulled her in close for a kiss.
"But it wasn't that loud!"
Peter’s brain was still much. Was he into that? Of course, he was. Harry was gorgeous, and Peter loved being with him. He didn’t think Harry would ever feel the same way about him.
Tony followed the dot on his phone that was tracking Peter’s exact location. He shoved past drunk people until they found themselves in a more secluded area of the woods. There were two familiar figures sitting at the base of a tree, who were noticeably younger than anyone else at the party.
is just making up a story. He needs to stay away from him." Steve was already turning on his heel, storming out the door.
Steve didn’t sound as understanding. “We told you not to go near him! He’s dangerous, Peter.”
He tried to push those thoughts out of his head when all he was wearing was a bathing suit. At least he was underwater from his chest down.
The smile stayed on Steve's face throughout the rest of his walk. Even when he walked through their front door, he was still smiling. He heard Tony moving around the kitchen, and walked over to join him. "I met one of our neighbors today--."
Harry scrambled out of the house and to Norman’s side, following him rigidly as they walked back to their house. Steve didn't close the door until he saw the two of them disappear in their own house. Steve prayed that Norman didn’t take anything out on his son.
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asked, prompting him for a response.
"I think you know."
"He's puking and crying. Harry said he was acting weird. The kid always acts weird, so I'm not sure why he's surprised--."
"Do I not?" He tilted his head. "Because you seem a bit scared."
It didn’t make sense, and it was driving Steve crazy.
"Oh, Captain Rogers! Hello!"
“I’m sorry, sir,” Harry said immediately. “I made sure he didn’t choke. I tried to get him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen.”
convincing." Peter couldn't keep the mirth from his voice. "I can barely recognize you."
Stepping out into the yard, he collected his towel and dirty clothes before walking inside. It was a little after nine now, so he thought sometime soon, Peter or Tony would join him. He threw his sweaty clothes and towel into the washing machine and then headed back to the kitchen.
"Oh, well, Captain Rogers hadn't set up his record player yet. We were listening to some of his music, and I asked how they danced to it back then, but he said he
Peter didn’t know how many drinks it took but soon, he was finally feeling pretty good. It was almost like when he took the pain medication after a bad injury, but this time, Tony wasn’t there to babysit him. Though, Harry had taken his place.
“Steve,” Peter said, suddenly grabbing the container of juice from his hand. IT was only then that Steve realized he had been spilling juice now that Peter’s cup was full.
So the next morning, though it was unfamiliar, he woke up early in the small twin bed and sat up, stretching. A six foot tall man was definitely not meant to fit in this bed, and Steve wondered why Fury couldn’t have at least made sure there was a queen sized bed in the guest room.
"Because I've been raised by a father who thought a good smack was the answer, and let me tell you, it's not."
Tony turned around when his coffee started to pour into his mug. "If you can't handle the pressure of this, then maybe you should call Fury and tell him you can't do it. Have them send in someone else."
“Ben…”
"I caught your boy trying to steal. Come get him before I call the police." He snapped before ending the call.
"You're not going anywhere yet."
know about what happened at the mall? He just wanted to keep Harry out of trouble...he didn’t think the news would travel around the entire neighborhood.
"We're taking the car, not the bike," Tony said, following after him.
"I'm not speaking to you ever again," Peter grumbled.
"Just askin'..."
Peter furrowed his brow. “Why?”
"Good. Well, thank you for your apology. I'm sorry for talking about…" Tony winced, not wanting to start the mood again. "You know…"
here's chapter two!! I'm so excited to share this with all of you. I can't believe the big reaction I've gotten to the first chapter already. I'm so excited to have more reviews to look forward to again. I really hope this story lives up to all of your expectations-- even mine! The concept is so good, and frankly, I'm scared of ruining it. Hopefully, I'll do it justice!
"No, you're not. You love him. You're only worried because he's putting himself in danger." Steve locked eyes with Tony and held his gaze until he felt the muscles in Tony's shoulders relax.
“Got it,” Peter said, nodding his head seriously.
"You do not scare me, Stevens."
Before their kiss finished, there was  a shout from the kitchen. “Harold!”
Tony grunted and turned his head so it was tucked in Peter's hair. His curls tickled his nose, but he stayed put.
Tony spoke like a normal human. "Don't glare at my son like that please."
Tony couldn't imagine Peter being anything but his typically bubbly self. "I don't like it," he said honestly.
"He really showed you."
Tony said in a mock whine. "Enjoy your time out."
"Where is my son?" Steve asked, his voice booming throughout the small store.
“You won’t because you’re not leaving the house. Remember that part of the rules?”
“I don’t want to kiss you like this,” Harry said.
“No, you won’t!” His yell was so sudden that even Peter flinched. Steve stepped in between him and Norman. Peter glanced around his huge mountain of a body to peer over at Harry as his father continued to yell. “You’re not to see my son anymore. If I see you near him, you will regret it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve didn't say anything. He wasn't sure what to say. He was still trying to focus on getting himself to calm down. He wondered if Tony was having the same problem, though he wouldn't be able to tell since he refused to let his eyes drift lower than his chin.
"So," Norman said, being the one to start a conversation. "Is this whole meal to apologize about the mall incident?"
"Happy says most of them are in the compound. Maybe they're trying to fix things? Don’t you wanna help?"
Which was the wrong thing to do because Tony dropped his hand immediately and glared at Steve. “Did you really just tell he could go on that bike after I said no?”
“Because I said so. You can be creative with your reasoning. Maybe you don’t want to share me with him, or you don’t want another father, or you think he’s not good enough, or you just don’t like him. I’m giving you a lot of choices here. Take your pick.”
Tony hadn’t even realized he was wearing Steve’s shirt. He was up the entire night thinking about Evalyn and Steve together, and the thought of it had him too sick to sleep. Why was he feeling that way? Maybe because he was worried about Steve sleeping with a potential Hydra operative? That could be dangerous, no matter how much experience Steve had in the field.
“Leave them be for now,” Tony whispered.
The only person he spoke to directly though was when he passed a mother pushing a stroller as she jogged towards Steve on the same sidewalk.
"Then you won't see my handsome face."
Steve started his morning just as he would have started any other morning. He made sure that any signs of sleeping on the couch were gone before he was healing outside for his morning jog.
Peter hoped he wasn’t getting any of it on Harry. That would definitely be embarrassing. He groaned after another round of vomiting. Harry helped move him to the ground by a tree and sat next to him. “‘M sorry!” Peter cried, feeling nauseous. He regretted drinking. If this was what being normal felt like, he never wanted to be normal again.
Peter had his eyes squeezed shut because he didn’t want to see the world around him anymore, but he shoved his hand into his pocket and grabbed the phone. He hoped it was his undercover phone, but he couldn’t remember which one he grabbed.
"No...by the time I was old and healthy enough...there wasn't a soul within 100 miles that wanted to dance with me."
“Aaand that’s where you kindly leave us the hell alone,” Tony said, grabbing Peter’s wrist to guide him towards the house.
With a sigh, Harry said, “It’s alright, Ben.”
But he did.
“Of course, you don’t. Anyway. Before we leave the car, you need to understand that we are always in character outside. Fury ensured the inside of the house wasn’t bugged, but he can’t do the same for the outside. So whenever we’re outside, around anyone or think you can be heard, you’ve got to stay in character.”
Steve certainly didn’t want to lose his virginity to some random person, let alone
Thomas ignored him, whistling as he walked over and ran a hand over Steve’s motorcycle. “She’s a beaut.”
Tony's eyes flickered over to Steve, though he wasn't as offended by it as Peter was. "So, you were…?"
"It is
Tony groaned loudly so Peter knew he was so not okay with this. “Fine. But it’s not up to me. It’s up to your aunt-- you know, your legal guardian.”
Tony's lip upturned into a small smile. "He'll get over it. Like when he ate too much food last Thanksgiving, decided to patrol after and puked in his suit. I'll never forget him sulking into the lab with that suit. He avoided me for a week because he was so embarrassed. I told him he never has to be embarrassed in front of me, but that doesn't mean I'll refrain from teasing the punk."
They called him after their lunch, and Fury was aggravated, but refused to let Peter out of the mission. They wanted them to look like a normal couple, and apparently sending off their child to a boarding school or killing him off in some freak accident was a no-go.
"Enjoying the peace and quiet," Steve said in a low voice. Living out here was so different from the city. There was no honking or yelling this late at night. There were crickets singing and nothing else. He was going to miss it when they left.
Tony started to play the music, and it was a soft sound. He smiled because it was only a few seconds in, and Tony could already tell it was so
“Why should we punish our son because you’re an ignorant prick?” Tony asked, puffing out his chest.
Maybe that was the reason why he was so against the idea of Steve going over there, even if it was for their mission. He was just a concerned teammate.
"You know why," Tony whispered, leaning down to start kissing his neck. Steve bit the inside of his lip to contain the whimper he almost released as Tony's kissing turned to gentle sucking and biting.
Tony laughed. "Because they're the softest pants I've ever worn."
But any plans he had to lay on his bed and sulk were forgotten about when he saw Harry by his desk. He was staring down at it, though Peter didn’t have much there. Only the few comic books that they had picked up together the other day.
“Are you mad at me?” Peter asked quietly, making himself comfortable in Harry’s arms. “No,” Harry replied. “Just worried.”
“Please? I’ll wear a helmet!” Peter amped his puppy dog eyes to eleven. Tony was weak when it came to his big eyes and pout.
Tony glanced at Peter in the corner of his eyes. He wondered if Peter was referring to the fact that he was bisexual, or maybe Peter was too. The kid hadn't come out to him, or May as far as he knew. Tony had kinda assumed he was straight, but maybe he wasn't. And maybe this little crush really wasn't MJ.
If Steve knew what he was really like, then he’d never invite him on another run. And if Harry knew what he was really like, then, he’d never even give him the time of day to be his friend, let alone something more.
"Oh, thank God. Thought you were going to pull out some vintage name from the '30s."
Even if maybe he was Edwin, Steve could still enjoy a little fun. Just because he didn't want to have sex with Evalyn didn't mean he would turn Tony down.
Please leave a review for me to read...it's a Rough Night, and your reviews can always make me smile.
Norman stood up, though he wasn’t as tall as Steve so he wasn’t very threatening. Steve still looked down at him. “Fine. I don’t want to be here with the likes of you either.”
"Roger. My husband is Edwin."
"Can't you just stay on top of it now?" Steve pressed.
Steve never wanted his child to feel like Joseph made him feel. And even if this child wasn’t his real child, for now, Peter was his boy, and he would protect and defend him.
The easiest solution to dealing with his anger was taking it out on someone that deserved his anger. Someone who lied to him and frustrated him and always acted like he was so much better than him.
Steve didn't quit. "C'mon, get to bed. I'll carry Pete to bed so he doesn't have to wake up."
Now, Tony was bringing him a few sandwiches and chips for lunch. He knocked on the door and of course the kid ignored him. He knocked again. "Kid, I know you're up. Unless you're napping like a good little spider baby."
"Yes. But he's drunk. He made a stupid mistake and yelling at him while he's already upset won't help."
"Okay! Ready?" Peter asked excitedly.
Both Tony and Peter are being big dumb in their argument so don't don't comment hate for either of them pls... they will learn as the story is wrapped up
Tony eyed him carefully. "You should sing."
Steve waved to every person he passed, whether they were bringing in the paper, getting in their car, or taking a morning walk. It was weird to be in such a normal neighborhood.
“Please! It’ll work this time. I’ll be normal! Just touch me,” Peter begged. All he needed was a little liquid courage to summon the strength because there was no way in hell he could have done any of this sober.
“You saw her. You wanted her. That’s why you’re so quick to jump in her bed the moment that she invites you over when there are plenty of other ways to find out what’s in that basement.” Tony crossed his arms over his chest, and he shouldn't look Steve in the eyes. The argument felt wrong; Tony felt wrong. But he had to be angry at Steve...he just had to be.
“Sorry,” Peter said with a nervous laugh. “I poured too much.”
Peter was curled up, leaning against Harry’s side. The smell of vomit was thick in the air even though they were outside. Steve had smelt worse during the war so he didn’t let it bother him. Tony on the other hand couldn’t hold back his gag. “Oh, kid--.”
“It’s alright,” he said. “I’m just glad I was here. He’s really going through something.”
Evalyn obviously had business in the city, and if she managed to run into Peter again after their fake cover story of his disappearance, then she’d start to ask questions.
Another question Peter had, though this one, he could actually ask Steve and Tony as they pulled up in font of their house. “Uh...why is there a motorcycle in the driveway?”
Tony wasn’t sure why he said the first thing that came to mind, but he wasn’t sure what else he could say that would excuse him having lunch so far from his
Steve woke up before his alarm just like every morning. He wasn’t sure why, but he always made sure that he was up a full minute before the alarm went off so he could swipe it off before it even turned on.
"I think we can let it go," Steve said carefully. "That's not why we invited you over."
in his hands."
“You’re welcome, Harry. I’m sorry it ended like this, but please,” he said, keeping his voice low, “don’t be afraid to call us or come over anytime you need.”
“We didn’t send him away to punish him, Norman,” Tony said, quirking an eyebrow. “He was getting worked up and overwhelmed. We let him take a walk so he could relax and clear his mind. There’s no need to get him all worked up over someone like you.”
Peter turned around, and all of his previous annoyance at Steve was gone. Of course, Steve wasn’t trying to hurt Tony purposely with this mission. He was a
"That's why he was detained by security for shoplifting, yes?" Norman asked, raising an eyebrow.
Especially when their bodies were so close and their hands lingered after every touch in the popcorn bowl when they reached for some at the same time. This was better than any other Netflix and Chilling.
"I know. Doesn't make him a bad kid...he's just a real pain in the ass sometimes." Tony shook his head, wondering how the hell he didn't have a full head of gray hair already because of Peter. He had some streaks here and there, all courtesy of Peter.
Steve was just as disgusted by the comment and said, “Please don’t say that around my son.”
Peter went silent as Tony started to put away more of his clothes. Peter stayed on his bed, glaring down his lap. He heard Tony struggling with some clothes before he grunted and shut the drawer. Peter glanced up to see him rubbing his face.
Now onto what's really important...not me...the fic.
For a few moments, they were both quiet as they continued to eat lunch. Tony knew that Peter was just thinking about the next best way to torment him with this situation.
“Your dads are on their way, okay? We’re just going to wait here for them.” Harry put an arm around his shoulder, kissing the top of his head.
Peter winced when he heard Tony calling his name down the hallway. “Well, I better get going. But I’ll see you tomorrow, Captain Rogers!”
Steve nodded his head, though he looked sad. “I would never hurt him, Tony.”
“I’m never going to hear the end of this, am I?”
"I love that kid," Tony mumbled, mostly to himself as he pulled the first one of Steve's he saw. "He's going to be the death of me, I swear."
"A real adorable one."
“No!”
“Come on, man!” Someone slurred from behind him. That guy was normal and having fun. “Just touch your boyfriend!”
“But, I didn't finish, Dad--.”
"Hold your horses. I'm coming in." He started to pull off his t-shirt, and Steve couldn't help it when his eyes went to Tony's tummy. Ever since Steve assured him having a little bit of a belly wasn't bad, he'd been much more confident with wearing no shirt. Steve preferred it that way. And while Steve enjoyed how muscled his arms were, his soft belly was better than abs.
He was searching through an almost empty fridge for anything to eat when Tony’s voice behind him made him jump.
Harry held him by the wrists and kept him away. “You’re embarrassing yourself,” he told him, Peter didn’t care. Peter was used to embarrassing himself.
Steve grabbed his towel and started drying himself off quickly so he could run inside and throw clothes on.
Here I am with an update. AO3 died a few minutes ago, and I was jealous of AO3 and also worried that I wouldn't be able to get this up tonight.
"Okay!" Steve said, his heart pounding in his ears. "If I take off my suit will you just get in the water?"
Tony wasn’t as impressed. “Uh, I guess?”
television. There were even pictures of Tony and Steve together on the walls and fireplace. Peter knew they were edited because Tony would never take a selfie with Steve, kissing his cheek. But they looked so real!
It was a feeling that Tony was very familiar with, though not with Steve. It was confusing.
"Where are you going? We have to go over the plan--."
“Yup.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony tried not to focus on how that made him feel. He couldn't get used to this little family. It wasn't going to last. They never did. "I still don't know why you thought you were capable of teaching Cap how to dance."
“It’s for his sake too. I know he misses you, and the rest of the team too. He tries to hide it, but it’s so obvious. He needs his family back.”
“I’m sorry, Tony. I don’t know how many times I can apologize before you believe it, but--.”
Peter’s eyes widened as Tony drove through the gate. He couldn’t believe he was actually going to live in a real house. He’d only ever known his Queens apartments his entire life. It was nighttime by the time that they made it to the island, so he couldn't see much of the neighborhood, but it looked like the kind of place where neighbors shared sugar, kids ran through sprinklers, and dogs were always being walked.
Steve cursed and tried stepping back, but Tony refused to let go of him.
"Alright. That sounds good." Steve nodded his head with a smile.
“We’ll have to go shopping later,” Steve said, grabbing a carton of eggs from the fridge. “We don’t have much of anything.”
“Nope!”
It had taken a few moments for Peter to let himself loosen up, but when he did, he leaned his head on Tony's shoulder. Tony smiled, glancing down at him.
And wasn't that true? Tony met Steve just as he was starting his new life in this century.
“We’ll do that when Peter wakes up.” Steve checked the time on his watch. “Does he usually wake up at a certain time? Is it too early to start breakfast?”
"I like that deal."
Steve flinched and so did Harry. Norman didn't seem to be affected by the words.
"I'll take him now, if you let go." Steve started to get a hold on the sleeping teenager, and Tony let go of him so he didn't make it anymore difficult.
what that was."
“It’s not fine,” Tony huffed before turning back to Steve. “You put a hand on him again, and I’ll kill you. Got that?”
Tony nodded his head. "Good idea."
Something about Norman coming over made him worried. Tony wasn't too happy to have the guy over either; he had his fair share of asshole fathers.
Which then led to Peter thanking her profusely and jumping up and down before Tony shooed him away to go pack some things he’d want to bring with them. He wasn’t sure how long the mission would last, but Tony learned his lesson to avoid going around the city now.
"That's because this disguise is already enough!" He gestured to himself.
Feeling his cheeks and ears burning, he pulled his swimsuit off and threw it out of the pool behind him. "Now, can you please get in here before someone sees you? Our son's window is right there, and you know Evalyn is always looking at us."
“Excuse me?”
"And what kind of discipline would you suggest?" Tony asked, faux interest in his voice. The sarcasm was practically dripping from his tongue. "Smacking him around? Is that your idea of good parenting?"
“You wouldn’t care if I wasn’t here,” Peter said. “You’re being too protective.”
"I'll probably rely on pet names," Steve admitted.
"She sounds sweet," Steve said. "I can see why Peter is such a good kid."
“I want you to be safe,” Harry said in a serious voice. He didn’t look like he was having fun. Maybe he was sad to share Peter with the rest of the people here?
Peter raised his cup to Harry before drinking it. It burned his throat and made his stomach feel queasy, but he didn’t stop. This is what normal kids did, and he was going to be normal. Once that drink was done, he filled the cup up again because he was sure his metabolism would mess with his ability to get drunk. Steve couldn’t ever get drunk and Peter prayed it wasn’t the same for him.
"Drop it...sure. That's why your son acts like that," Norman said, waving his fork over at Peter. "He needs discipline."
Once he was gone, Norman chuckled. “Well, you’re halfway there to parenting.”
If you couldn't tell, I Stan healthy discussions about sex when dealing with an aspec character. We'll see plenty more! (With both Steve and Peter!)
Tony returned Peter's back to the case and flipped through the small collection they had. He smiled when he saw a few of his own music.
Steve opened his eyes, ready to gently push Tony away, but then Tony moaned with a name on his lips. A name that wasn't Roger.
"Excuse me? Why would we be apologizing?" He challenged.
Tony waved him off. "Go ahead. I'll probably have the call in the bedroom, unless you want to hear it too?"
"Oh, you're so right." Tony paused before he yelled, presumably to Peter's window. "Benjamin, don't look out your window! Your dads are skinny dipping and having a little fun!"
"Where the hell were you?"
Tony walked in, watching him fondly, standing next to Steve. Steve looked up at him with a smile, though he didn't say a word. Tony wouldn't have been able to hear it, even if he did.
“Tony,” he said again.
“Yes, there is.” Peter stood up, walking towards the hallway his bedroom was in. “And you need to chill out or else this mission will never get far. I’m getting dressed. You guys work on invitations without killing each other.”
“Make sure she does then. Goodbye, Stark.” Then the line went dead.
This night was going horribly. Peter just wanted to have a nice dinner with Harry while Steve and Tony talked to Norman. Of course, Norman had to ruin that. He was such a dick. He didn’t understand how Harry could listen to him degrade him like that all the time.
"No. I mean, someone tried
Steve shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe we should give it until Peter is feeling better? Just a few hours? Maybe while we're waiting we can watch a movie or something."
Steve rolled his eyes, taking Tony's hand. "Alright. Let's go."
"Embarrassed about it, huh? Yeah, I'd be mortified too if my son tried getting makeup. I mean, condoms, good for him. But makeup? No, sir--."
Tony scoffed and said, "Why does Happy gossip so much? We're not children. There are some things you just can't forget, kiss, and make up from."
"Pops!" Peter shouted, sounding worried. Tony rushed in when he heard him. He was sitting behind a desk with a dirty handcuff locking him to the arm of the chair he was sitting on. "Dad!"
Steve chuckled softly, but when the singing continued, he joined in. There was his beautiful voice that Tony never thought he'd hear outside of the shower.
"We're not canceling," Peter said firmly. "I want you to talk to him. To help Harry."
Peter could finally be a normal boyfriend and give Harry what he wanted. Peter pushed Harry up against the nearest tree and started to kiss him hungrily. He heard whistles and claps behind him, so he must have been doing something right. Except, Harry wasn’t as excited about Peter’s kissing as everyone else seemed to be. He took Peter by the cheeks and gently pulled him away.
"Is everything alright?" She asked, sounding a bit concerned. "He called me last night. He said he was fine."
Peter fidgeted. "I'm sorry for interrupting."
“Yes! Before I screw this up-- yes-- just--.” Peter squeezed his eyes shut and puckered his lips for a kiss. A second later, Harry’s lips were back on his, and his hands cupped Peter’s cheeks. Peter was doing better with moving his lips. Kind of. Harry was doing most of the work, and Peter was just doing his best at copying him.
“Yes, you do. Come to bed.” Steve walked over and took the tablet out of Tony’s hands.
"I didn't," Peter said again. "I didn't even leave the store yet."
The meal started in an awkward silence as everyone just ate their food. Steve really wasn't sure what they were supposed to do. They couldn't just ask:
Klaus stared into his eyes, looking over his body, as if he was studying him and his muscles. Finally, he looked back up and something about him seemed calmer...almost smug. "Fine."
Steve made a plate for Tony as well before he made one for himself. He leaned against the counter, far away from Peter and Tony while he ate his breakfast.
“Cap’s one of your childhood heroes. He was mine too, kid. And...I don’t want to ruin that image you have of him. If I tell you what happened, you might lose two childhood heroes. So just drop it. Please.” Tony wasn’t looking at him, and Peter knew he was making his escape soon. He always did when conversations turned too emotional.
Tony pried open an eye to watch Peter go still in Steve's arms again, resting his head on Steve's chest as he carried him, cradled in his arms down the hallway.
“Look, kid. I’m sorry. God, I’m sounding like my dad more and more everyday.”
Peter crossed his arms over his chest. “You can’t just tell me to stay away without explaining why. It’s not fair.”
"Let's just say, if it was my son caught with makeup and condoms, he'd still be in his bedroom."
Peter shook his head, spilling some of the drink that somebody had shoved into his hand. "There's nothing wrong with me. I’m finally and perfectly fine. I'm normal like this, and we can have fun!”
He was already still horrified from the fact that Tony told Steve about his bullying problem. He wasn’t supposed to be
Tony groaned loudly. “I don’t even know if his aunt will say okay to this.”
Peter grinned widely and pulled him in for a hug. “Thank you!”
when they didn't know just what he would be forgiving.
"What're you doing out here all alone?" Tony asked, stopping by the edge of the pool.
Tony's mind started to scream. Was he trying to kiss him? Why was he doing that? Why wasn't Tony pulling away?
face."
“I saw the rabbit in the window, and I really wanted it,” Peter replied. “I didn’t think he’d accuse me of stealing.”
Tony stabbed his french fry into his small puddle of ketchup. "He's-- so-- and just-- ugh!"
"But I care what he thinks about me!" Peter shouted, his voice cracking slightly. He froze and cleared his throat as his face burned red.
“Yes,” Tony said, crossing his arms as he glared down at Peter.
“Oh, no,” Steve said, shaking his head. “I couldn’t ask you to get caught in the middle of us, son.”
“Thanks, Dad,” Peter said, cheekily.
No...that seemed so wrong. Peter knew Steve’s feelings for Tony. He’d heard him talk about him. Steve really did love Tony. So, then why was he going to sleep with another person? To make him jealous? Making someone jealous was not a cool thing. It was mean and cruel.
Steve’s shoulders relaxed the moment Peter started talking, and a smile spread across his face. “Queens,” was all he said and Peter found himself smiling right back.
"Everything you do is enough. I've seen you with Peter. Give yourself more credit." Steve smiled softly. "Now let's go pick him up. Promise me you'll try to hold back the anger until tomorrow?"
Peter rolled his eyes but didn't complain as he took his seat on the couch, almost sitting in Tony's lap.
“Now that we’re all awake and ready for our day, I think we should figure out the cover story for this whole little
Tony mock gasped and placed a hand on his chest. "Who? Me?
I am posting this from my breakroom at work, so I won't have a chance to reply to all of the previous comments yet
Tony chuckled, ignoring the way Peter was staring at him, probably in shock. “No, he wasn’t. He was staying at his aunt’s apartment while we settled everything into the house.”
implying?" Peter asked, tilting his head to the side.
Peter was on his side at least, though he was upset at Steve for just agreeing to it, even if he was only trying to get Tony to break. Steve still thought that at the last minute, he wouldn’t be able to take the jealousy and would tell him to stop. If Tony was just as gone on him as he was, then he would stop him. It was just a matter of
Peter shrugged his shoulders. “Not anymore dangerous than other things I’ve done. I’ll be fine. Especially with you there. Don’t worry about me. I’m Spider-Man. I can handle myself.”
“No!” Peter shouted before slapping a hand over his mouth. He didn’t want Tony or Steve to hear him, come in, and ruin the moment. “I mean, no-- don’t leave.”
“What’re you two doin’?” Tony asked, turning around to stare at them with a furrowed brow. His voice was thick with sleep still, and his hair was as wild as Peter’s was before a run. Tony used to make sure he was dressed and ready for the day before he entered the kitchen. He never wanted to look anything less than put together.
Is that what’s bothering you?” Steve raised an eyebrow.
was upset though when Steve was the one that was angry at him. Tony was supposed to tell him to tell Evalyn to screw off. Steve didn’t want anything to do with her, but Tony had just gone with it and said okay. What the hell was
"You got that right. My husband manages to sleep through it every morning, but I never have that same luck."
"You chose that--."
Peter turned his pout to Steve and Steve nodded his head before mouthing,
I've been waiting to write this chapter since last year and was so excited to finally do it!! Please enjoy :)
So he grabbed his clothes, and headed into the backyard where there was a shower on the side of the pool. Thankfully, it had a stall around it so he could have some privacy for everyone in the house’s sake.
“Shoulda kept you asleep, twerp.” Tony shoved him gently. “I don’t need the sarcasm.”
The pants landed behind Steve's head on the patio, and Steve wished he had kept looking to watch him throw them like that. He wondered if he used his hand or tossed it off with his foot.
Tony stayed with Peter, lifting his arm to spin Peter underneath him a few times. That was the extent of Tony's dancing.
Maybe he did it because it gave him some sort of control in his life.
Almost 9k words and this chapter has only the beginning of the original plan. Peter took control of this chapter, and needed to get some stuff in here for all of you to see. I hope you enjoy.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, though he wasn’t sure what for.
The only time his father didn’t throw his fists around was when he had been drunk. Then he just came home and passed out on the couch. Those nights, his mother had to take care of him and his father. Steve tried not to need anything on those nights. Sometimes, Bucky came over to check on them and took care of Steve when his mother was busy with Joseph.
“We should stay,” Peter said, already walking towards the party.
“You finally punished your son,” Norman said, sounding too proud.
“No, you won’t,” Norman snapped, making Peter flinch. This time, Steve
Tony took a chip from his plate and ate it, chewing thoughtfully. "Do you think they know who we are or just that we're onto them?"
"Teaching him how to dance."
Once his shirt wasn't covering his waist, Steve saw the drawstrings tied up tightly to keep the sweatpants from falling down his hips. Those were definitely Steve's.
Steve chuckled. “Yeah, see you tomorrow, kid.”
"Are you surprised by that,
Evalyn looked just as she did when she was hanging around the neighborhood. Her long, wavy blonde hair cascaded down her shoulders and back. Her makeup was done perfectly, giving her lips a bright red color. Her bodycon dress that clung to her body left nothing to the imagination and showed off every curve.
“Have fun with the new gift, Roger. Tell me if you ever need someone else to go on a little ride.”
"Of course, Peter."
"I hate you."
Peter ignored the looks and glared at the ground still, but that didn't silence him. "Fuck those kids, Peter. If something makes you happy, who gives a rat's ass what anybody else thinks?"
"Let's make a deal. You call me May, and you'll be Steve."
Tony grinned when he heard Peter groan under the blankets. Tony loved embarrassing that kid. "Stop! It was a
“He’s an intern of mine,” Tony lied. So he didn’t want Steve knowing his identity, or maybe he wanted to make sure it was okay with Peter before he shared it. “I was having lunch with him in the city when Evalyn came up to me and started asking questions. I panicked and gave us a kid.”
Steve's smile only widened. "Perfect. Then let's start! You pick since I picked last time."
Steve froze, and he saw Tony's face turn to a glare instantly. Oh no.
"He'd be out there with or without you, Tony," Steve told him. Steve had seen videos of him long before the airport in Germany. "You're just giving him more protection and keeping him safe."
"Because we're happily married. And I want to be close to my husband." Tony was shifting suddenly and he had his leg hooked around one of Steve's.
“Hell no.”
"I hate when you're right," Tony grumbled, sticking his lower lip out in a pout.
“Harold!” Norman shouted. “Harold, get out here right now!”
Peter's cheeks flushed. "Well, yeah, but you guys are different."
He wanted to go out and start his day with a run, but he still hadn’t unpacked his clothes yet. He didn’t want to have to dig through it all right now, so he decided that making breakfast would be a good use of his time.
“I’ve got that,” Tony said, taking the larger one out.
"Any tips on how to bring back the dimple-y smile?'
"A few months," she answered. "He has trouble sleeping still, so I jog every morning after he usually wakes himself up before the sun."
“Lemme be normal!” Peter begged when Harry tried stopping him from filling the cup again. Peter was stronger though so he got his way. He smirked triumphantly as he chugged the drink within seconds.
"You two fell asleep," Steve whispered. "You'll mess up your backs."
Peter was vibrating with excitement. The living room had a couch and a
"With all due respect," Steve said because zero respect was due to Norman, "I'd appreciate it if you didn't discuss my son's business when it's not your own."
Harry scrambled away and hurried to Norman’s side. “Sorry,” he mumbled to Peter as he left his side.
Tony glanced around and sure enough, Thomas was watching them from across the street. He was smirking over at Tony, and their conversation about divorce. He only grew angrier, and Tony didn’t even know who he was mad at anymore.
Sorry for the wait! I just moved to a new state last week and started a new job and life has been hectic. I'm hoping that when things settle in more, I'll have more time to write. Not only to keep up with my update schedule but also for my own mental health.
"Long story, but my dad said I couldn't leave my room." Peter didn't want to be in that home another minute with Steve worrying about how his concussion was healing and Tony giving him a sarcastic attitude about his stupid mistake yesterday. He was confused!
Peter lifted his fingers to his lips, remembering the feeling of Harry’s on his, and he had a hard time believing anything else.
May hissed. "Ooh, yeah. That'll do it."
“But, I didn't finish, Dad--.” Harry started to say, making Peter blush. Peter knew he was talking about using the restroom probably, but Peter knew it was really about
“I don’t like you around my family. I want you to leave.”
“I think him drinking more and more was weird enough,” Harry said with another moment of hesitation. “But he said some other stuff that I think you should ask him about. It’s not my business to tell.”
“I’m sorry, what?” Tony asked.
They got into the car and hurried to where Tony traced Peter’s phone to the exact location. Steve wasn’t surprised that Tony had his location so readily, though he did wonder if Peter knew about it. Probably not, as that would just start another fight.
Steve was so close. He was in Tony's space, and maybe for a reason. Maybe Tony could jump him now and devour those pretty lips of his. Surely, he wouldn't mind. He needed some practice, especially if he was going through with the affair.
"Why?" Steve's brain was running a mile a minute trying to keep up with Tony. He wasn't sure why Tony was seducing him, but it was working.
“I’m not having this conversation with you,” Steve said, walking past him. When he was close enough, he added in a whisper, “Not when there are people watching.”
"You okay?"
"You were in the corner, glancing around. You have a history. It's not hard to connect dots, boy." Klaus narrowed his eyes, slamming the rabbit on the table.
“No apologizing,” Tony told him. “It’s gonna be okay. I promise.”
"Seriously?" Tony asked. "I'll wash it later when there are more dishes."
“I’m going for a ride,” he replied. “And then when I come home, I’m asking Evalyn when her husband is leaving so I can go over. I don’t want this going on much longer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harold, get out here now!”
“Tony, that’s ridiculous. I just want to find Hydra, and you agreed that it was the easiest way to snoop.” Steve jabbed his finger in his direction. “But if you don’t want me to do it, we can find another way together.”
"Well, he's lucky to have a mother like you," Steve said genuinely.
Tony had never seen another person have quite a crisis like he had, but this definitely seemed like a Tony Stark Breakdown. “Why?”
Tony waited for the, “no”, but it never came. What she said instead, surprised him.
Surprise!!! Unless you follow my insta or you're in the superfam discord, you probably weren't expecting an update so soon! Well, I decided to start updating this story twice a week. Only because I'm so excited to get these next chapters out and also start new projects.
Parents were supposed to lift you up and support you, no matter what.
Harry frowned next to him, oblivious to the music coming from somewhere deeper in the woods. Peter left his bike at the nearest tree and started to run towards the source of the sounds. Harry shouted after him, telling him to slow down, but Peter didn’t stop until he was face to face with a party in the woods.
Peter curled deeper into his side with a whimper. “Sorry.”
His curiosity was paused when he heard another voice join them. He recognized it from not only Germany, but from all of the school videos he had to watch featuring Captain America. “Hello, Tony…”
It hadn’t been until Peter gestured to the shirt he was wearing that Tony realized
"No, he was fine. He's a teenager. I irked him. It's fine."
“Why not? You’re my husband. Can we not get each other gifts?”
“It’s fine,” Peter said, not wanting to make it a big deal. “I’ll see you later--.”
Peter eyed him and was quiet before continuing, "I took ballet. I stopped in high school."
“I’m not keeping him from Harry,” Steve said. “I’m keeping him away from
seen that look on Peter's face, so it was jarring. Especially to see it directed to him.
Peter’s frown deepened. “What--?”
“Alright,” Steve said before he started cracking eggs into a bowl.
Peter didn’t like being babied, and even though he knew Tony and Steve didn’t try to make him feel bad about it, they were good at babying him. They worried too much about a man that Peter could easily take of if he ever tried anything. He wasn’t useless.
"So he takes it out on you? Nope. I don't buy that excuse." Tony crossed his arms over his chest.
Sighing, Peter pushed open his bedroom door. He thought one hide-out was enough for today, but he already needed another one.
Steve's smile faltered. "What?"
"Have fun in this room," he said, halfway out the doorway. "Because you're going to be stuck here until the mission's over."
It didn’t make sense. Tony had to hate the guy because if he didn’t turn all of these feelings to hate, then they’d turn to something else. Something dangerous.
"I mean, how do they expect me to be his
Her eyes were on Tony before slowly glancing over at Peter. Then she turned back to Tony. "I should be asking you that. Does Roger know you're out here having lunch with some
"Tony, I don't like to be teased," he said, his voice tense.
“Good...well, I’m gonna head to bed. You should too. We’ve got a long day tomorrow of figuring out cover stories and all that fun stuff.” Tony walked towards the bedroom door, and opened it up quietly.
Norman grunted before grabbing Harry by the arm to yank him out of the house. Peter started to follow them, but Tony stopped him by grabbing his hand. He pulled him to his side much more gently than Norman did.
"I'm fine!" Peter snapped at Steve before glaring over at Tony. Tony felt his heart skip a beat. He had
Tony stared at the mess and then at Peter, though he didn’t look shocked. “Thirsty, huh?”
Tony wasn't above killing a child for bullying his kid. Maybe he was...no, he wasn't. He was only above that when someone official like the police asked. "I will kill that Flash kid, if he’s still bugging you."
Don't be mad
He heard them before seeing them. He heard them before even opening the front door. There was a faint sound of loud music coming from inside, though Tony couldn't tell what it was.
Peter would have laughed if he still wasn’t completely humiliated by Thomas’ words.
“Excuse me, but you are not responsible for the kid.
“Putting him in danger isn’t just my punishment!” Tony yelled, knowing that Peter was rolling his eyes as he listened to his side of the conversation.
“I--uh, have to go,” he said, running away from the table before he even finished helping Peter clean up the spill. He needed to get away from Tony in his shirt, and he needed space to breathe and think.
"Mac and cheese...a little infantile, no?" Norman said as he made a face at the bowl in the middle.
“About the bathroom. I didn’t need to go,” he explained, shrugging his shoulders. “I just needed to get away from my dad.”
“Can’t we just get along?”
"Good. And the other hand holds mine like that...and I put my hand here…" Tony wrapped a hand around the back of Steve's neck, the bottom of his hair tickling his hand.
"I hate peanut butter!"
"Woah," Tony chuckled as he was dragged onto the carpeted floor that was apparently now an impromptu dance floor.
"Tony. Just get in the water."
"If I find out you did anything to him, I will end your entire life just like that," Tony said, snapping his fingers smoothly.
To prove his point, Peter pushed forward and kissed him deeper, shoving his tongue forward. Still, there was no reaction from below his belt. Peter grunted and tried to kiss him more, but Harry pushed him away again. “Ben, stop.”
“Well, maybe one day soon, I’ll take you for a ride. If you want.”
weird.
“Because I’m too old to sleep on a couch, and there are only two bedrooms in this house.” Tony started to unpack Peter’s clothes and put them away in his drawers. Peter knew he was just trying to keep himself busy so he didn’t have to go to bed and lay awake thinking about whatever the hell was going on between him and Steve.
"I have him in the back," Klaus replied. "I caught him sneaking around, looking very suspicious with
"No!" Peter shouted. "Don't kill anyone. He's just insecure."
“Woah,” he marveled. “I always thought parties like this were just in the movies.”
One moment he closed his eyes and promised he was just resting them as he listened to the movie, but then his shoulder was being shaken and he was dragging his eyelids open again.
