Someone who, in a way, had also looked after her health concerns, because injecting Botox is not without danger to one's health ...
And there could not possibly be any mistake either. No one in Moriarty's organisation could afford to make a mistake if they still wanted to see the next day. Alive.
All very obvious, John thought and smirked slightly. From the looks of it, he had indeed succeeded Sherlock's heir.
It was just a pity that the end of his career would be rather bloody ... but there was still time before that.
John was standing on the middle of the roof. She had to get him to the edge. Then she could push him down, and afterwards claim he had committed suicide ... out of sheer despair at the loss he still hadn't come to terms with ...
The weekend with Richard had ended satisfactorily and, above all, purposefully. I didn't have to worry about him for the time being.
The weapon that had also been used a time or two afterwards. Forbidden, because actually he should not have possessed that weapon any more.
And before I had the chance to make him understand that there was no problem at all, he sank into his memory palace.
This was necessary on the one hand, because even for a genius like me it is not easy to present a completely different person in every single second of life. On top of that I sometimes, well, have certain mental breakdowns... ( yes, when people are stupid for example, and then treat me disparagingly, that makes me aggressive. I mean, how dare such people!)
But now the tears were running, first softly, then the crying turned into a loud sobbing. It hurt, it hurt so much!
Mike Stamford worked at Bart's Hospital, where Sherlock used the labs for his experiments. They knew each other and got along quite well, which may have been largely due to Stamford's good nature.
I had fallen in love the day we met, I'd already fallen in love with him when I shot the taxi driver. I loved him and almost got crushed when I thought he was dead. I loved him when I started dating Mary. I loved him the moment he stood in front of me and I realised he wasn't dead. I loved him when I broke up with Mary because he was back.
But the longer I was with Sherlock the more I saw how quickly he got bored and how much the cases I kept serving him made him happy. The more complicated, the better. For this purpose, I had already let some of my henchmen go over the edge, but so what? After all, my plan was to dissolve my organisation in the long run, so a few collateral damages didn't matter. It was just their turn sooner than the rest.
But first I had to solve the case at the bank together with Sherlock. There were a few uncomfortable moments when Sherlock managed to get me arrested for illegal graffiti. I had to appear in court and pull some strings to prevent anyone from noticing that John Watson didn't exist.
"You do realise, Sherlock," she said , "that my snipers are in position and will blow you and your battle dachshund here off the roof?"
When he had somehow regained his composure, could catch his breath again and was able to articulate something like words again, he yapped:
Of course I knew his looks from photos and videos, but I had deliberately stayed away from him until now. So now I was facing him in the flesh for the first time.
Mycroft Holmes rubbed the bridge of his nose with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand and furrowed his brow.
Here she was, on this rooftop, which should have been Sherlock's last hour, and which would now apparently be the place where she herself breathed her last.
John had first had tea with Mrs. Hudson and assured the old lady that she could always turn to him if she needed someone to talk to. She had hugged him with tears in her eyes, for at that moment they had both missed Sherlock especially.
Mike didn't seem to think so because he banged on the door and threatened to come in and undress John himself and stuff him under the shower. Mike had been a doctor and had also been in the military, so it was safe to assume that he would not shy away from the sight of a naked guy, so there was no doubt that he would make good on his threat. Well, that went against John's instincts, so he picked himself up, growled angrily:
John hesitated. He wasn't stupid, of course someone who was up to no good could pose so that he couldn't be seen through the peephole, and then, if the door had been opened, pounce on him.
In addition, the first days were hectic. He was overrun by journalists, those assholes, who were somehow responsible for everything. The police questioned him, asked him about everything, wanted to know...
And he hated himself for his cowardice that kept him from emulating his friend and putting an end to this "life", this existence.
The willingness to prepare a thing down to the smallest detail and to pay attention to every last detail is what makes me so successful. And when you use my services, you have to be prepared to pay a fair amount of money for it, because I am not cheap.
Shortly after it became clear that Moriarty, the bastard, was still alive, the first voices had been raised in the press that he, Dr John Watson, should take up the matter and continue Sherlock's investigation. At first it had only been those smear sheets from the yellow press. In the meantime, however, some of the more serious newspapers had also published articles on the subject, and unlike the clamour of the yellow press, they were well-founded.
"Was I wrong about anything?", in the sure expectation that he was of course wrong about nothing at all, I couldn't help but spontaneously change one little thing.
"Sherlock," I said, snuggling even closer, "we don't have to discuss that now, of all times. I love you, and you love me. Everything else will work out."
Besides, he wondered if "Sherlock" would appear when he entered the flat. It was crazy, but he longed to discuss the whole thing with him, his own figment of the imagination. On the other hand, he dreaded it. "Sherlock's" presence, even if he didn't speak, did him good and helped him think more clearly and with more focus.
Not with Sherlock-I-Must-See-Everything-And-Scientifically-understand-It- And-Plan-To-The-Detail-Holmes.
How it "stands" between me and Sherlock... the ambiguity of this statement only became clear to me the moment I said it.
Rarely in her life, in her career, had she had to ask herself that. Everything had always been planned in such a way that she had not had to worry about such things. But now ...
It was not about feelings. I don't have feelings for other people. Not for someone special like Sherlock, nor for some ant person. When Sherlock called me his "friend" during the case at the bank, where a gang of smugglers, also working on my behalf, had smeared strange signs over the portrait of an important former bank executive, I found it downright hilarious.
Slowly he walked up the stairs. His thoughts were wandering. Yes, he was really worried about his state of mind. It was just all too much, and he missed Sherlock.
"My esteemed brother IS the British government. And no, I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Now come on John, we wouldn't want you to collapse from hunger."
After a night on Sarah's uncomfortable sofa (I would make that woman suffer yet for her arrogant manner towards Watson ...) I made my way back to 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock not being the great detective he pretended to be. Nobody could be that clever. He would commit the crimes himself in order to solve them and present himself as the great saviour, it had been said. Oh, no one had ever really claimed that. They had always put question marks around it, written: "Could it be ...?" or " Is it perhaps the case that ...?". But it had had its effect: the people on the street who read these sensational papers had begun to believe the lies about Sherlock. And then more serious papers had followed with just such questions.
For the very first time, it seemed that those who represented law and order, and thus at the forefront, Dr John Hamish Watson, always treated by Sherlock as a kind of lapdog, were getting uncomfortably close to Moriarty.
Well, it would probably be better to keep an eye on the whole affair, especially Mycroft Holmes, because he just couldn't be trusted. The man just remained mysterious.
"I know that, John. I know you well enough. But I also know that you've had sex frequently and enjoyed it in the past, with your various girlfriends."
I nodded, I think I knew that one. Sherlock's insecure, childlike side, which I had got to know by now, would not be seen by many people either.
And he stood up, picked up his mobile phone, went into the small kitchen of the flat and from there began to make phone calls and give initial instructions.
It was irreparable, he would have to live with that for the rest of his days. knowing that he had failed as a friend. Well...
"Well, I suppose you have so much decency, that YOU understood that no means no, and I don't have to defend myself against YOUR intrusions?" I asked sarcastically.
Instantly, the little cogs in Molly Moriarty's head rattled and she played through all her options in a flash.
It was a mixture of bewilderment, wonder, love, gratitude and... Yeah, what was it? Anyway, he seemed to be having a great time.
On the one hand, there was Greg Lestrade. For he had been very close to Sherlock in terms of all the cases and had also known him very well personally. He was often to be found here in Baker Street. He seemed to feel responsible for Sherlock, because he had picked him up in the gutter and got him to get off drugs, something Mycroft had not managed before, and to lead him to a more or less regular life by giving him the choice: Assist with cases only if Sherlock stayed clean.
I had originally intended to send these texts to the pager itself. But then I had decided to stay in touch with Sherlock and had left that task in Richard's capable hands. The little guy proved to be an invaluable accomplice.
For taking the meaning out of his, John's, life and now preventing him from putting an end to this existence that had become meaningless just by remembering him.
I slid into the bath and motioned for him to sit in front of me in the warm water. He did, I wrapped my arms around him and he leaned against me.
They had started asking vicious and mean questions then. Making assumptions. Always under the guise of speculation.
I roughly cleaned myself with my shirt that I had found on the floor and gently pressed Sherlock onto the sofa.
What could be done if this so unassuming and yet so amazing Doctor Watson actually found out who Moriarty was? A little annoyed at Moriarty's own game... the business with the body in Baker Street, the hint of the cat and mouse game had been superfluous. Well, it seemed John hadn't taken that hint. Mickey. Like Mickey Mouse. Cats Paradise, like cat. Cat and mouse game. Sherlock would have immediately ...
He opened the door to the Chinese restaurant for me and led me straight into one of the alcoves that had a door that could be closed and was therefore private.
Thanks to my lover, he already knew about it and, as I saw him, he already knew that Sherlock and I had actually found each other. I had no idea how he always managed to know everything, but he just did.
She had no meaning. She only got that by the fact that I used her. She became a piece that had to be taken into account.
On the other hand, not boring, but with a taste for adventure, for danger, because like me, Sherlock's biggest problem was boredom.
Anyway, the thanks to Sherlock he was already in the know anyway, so I might as well get advice and help from him.
So I had him on an unexpected but very welcome hook and the game promised to be even better than I had hoped.
Oh yes, John hated Anderson and Donovan too. Very much so, in fact. So much so that he felt sick just thinking about them.
Yes, now John realised that he had just ... deduced a few things there. He had probably learned more from Sherlock than he had believed himself, because these things had just jumped out at him.
With that done, Moriarty set off into the day, for there was a part to play. A role that Moriarty had been playing for so long now, and one that was likely to fool the whole world into thinking that this person who seemed so friendly and harmless was in fact something else entirely.
Oh yeah? Just yesterday he was nearly freaking out from boredom .... I had to bite back a grin. Brotherly love was really something fine after all.
For the next half hour I had time to get to know other characters in the drama. DI Lestrade, who had only briefly been rushing through the flat in Bakerstreet earlier; Sergeant Donovan, who dared to call Sherlock, who was after all almost as brilliant as me, a freak; Anderson, who ... well, I could understand after a few words from this ... person ... that Sherlock looked at him like he was a skunk with syphilis.
He wrote back. Something he really shouldn't do under any circumstances, and if he did, then only in an absolute emergency.
Oh boy, how did I get myself into this stupid situation. John Hamish Watson, you can be a real idiot sometimes.
The fact that Sherlock had allowed himself to be captured so easily, almost like a child playing hash me, had been rather disappointing.
I was curious to see if Sherlock would find it and if he would find out what was missing inside, namely her mobile phone, which, again on my instructions, had been left with the taxi man.
Yes, the good old game of "I fuck you until you lose your mind and then you lose your life" was more than tempting at that moment.
That's not as arrogant a word as it sounds. It's more of a statement of fact based on hard data. That I am a criminal cannot be denied, but beyond that I am simply more intelligent than any man on this planet.
He sat in his armchair, brooding muffledly. Eating and drinking what was necessary, dragging himself into the bathroom when his body felt the need. Dragged himself back into his armchair, sat there brooding again. For weeks, in the same shirt, the same pants. Barefoot. Unwashed, unkempt... It didn't matter anymore.
John jumped up and ran in the direction where the person had just been standing. But at that moment the train had reached the next platform, stopped and the doors opened. People poured out and in the crowd John lost track.
Well, this crush played into my hands and I would take advantage of it later, but for the time being it was unsuitable for my project.
"All I want to know, Sherlock, is why. Has anything happened that might have hurt you, or anything like that?" I still worried.
He hated Sherlock for it, and hated himself for realising that it wasn't really true and that he really did love Sherlock.
I surrendered to his arms and enjoyed his tenderness, almost purring, and we cuddled for quite a while until he finally said
"Jesus Christ!", John shouted at her. He seemed genuinely angry. "Molly, are you even listening to me? I know you're Moriarty!"
"I can see that obviously this isn't working. It seems you have great difficulty engaging in sex outside of our relationship, even though it was you who first had the idea."
It was only to take a few minutes before I realized that I had been thoroughly mistaken in this assessment.
But no. His heart, into which he had obviously enclosed me so much, didn't let him even think of the idea.
"John, I've found that when you are happy about something I do, with the aim of bringing you joy, my heart does something rather strange."
"You think Mrs. Hudson is Moriarty? You think she's ultimately to blame for his death? Do you really think she could have fooled us all that much? That you could even be so deceived?"
John threw himself back into everyday life. Performed his duties. Did his job with all the dedication and sense of duty that was his.
And while Moriarty's footsteps sounded on the pavement, and the fresh air of the morning created a pleasant feeling of freshness in Moriarty's lungs, John had also finished his breakfast in his Baker Street flat, unaware that he was being targeted by the very target of his investigation.
"Well, Greg," I said, "I'm still not sure about that. But so be it. It is what it is. So could you just keep it to Sherlock that you and I spent the evening together? If he thinks I spent the evening with... well, met someone else, and maybe done something other than drink beer... then he's less worried about my... sexual needs."
I enjoyed that very much, of course, and Sherlock seemed more balanced than ever and obviously enjoyed it too.
"Oh," I said seemingly as an aside. "So you're unattached, then, like me." And I lowered my eyes to the menu with interest.
The two of them were obviously in a discussion about whether Sherlock could take on one of his brother's cases.
So I, John Watson, stormed out of the flat in a rage, slamming the door. In doing so, I almost knocked over Mrs Hudson, who was checking up on me again.
As tears ran down his cheeks and he could hardly breathe from loud, barking laughter, Sherlock slapped him hard across the face.
And yet, every now and then I thought how nice it would be to experience something like this with Sherlock.
Of course I was still upset, but I knew that with Sherlock I would always have to expect surprises like this and similar ones.
After all, I had, at least that's what I had led Sherlock to believe, also had had sex with other people from time to time in the last few weeks.
When John regained consciousness, he was lying in the same place on the carpet and a figure was crouching beside him.
So an army doctor, returned from a foreign mission, with an injury (I actually have one, and the person who shot me in the shoulder did not live long enough to hear my cry of pain), with a trauma, with an alcoholic brother, with parents who have already passed away, with an old friend in Sherlock's circle.
"John, I thought you would have known. Sherlock didn't jump to his death from the roof of the Bart. I was helping him. It was an act."
What he had experienced with Molly hurt so much. John felt as if he had lost Sherlock all over again.
When I entered the room and my eyes fell on it, he just grinned wryly, shrugged his shoulders and continued reading.
After all, the moment Sherlock had started to develop feelings, for John, but also friendly feelings for Lestrade and that old hen Hudson, she' d been able to get hold of him. Feelings made one manipulable. So she would manipulate John for her own purposes.
"I'm fine, John. The man I love has deflowered me. Of course, my backside hurts a bit. Which is no wonder, given that your penis has penetrated my Musculus Sphincter Ani..."
"Oh," he said, "now I suppose I'll have to ask you if you want to go at all. So, John, will you marry me?"
And in doing so, I ensured that he, and therefore both of us, had a regular income. He could seriously refuse cheques of enormous size!
"Twelve hours you have to solve the puzzle. If you don't succeed Sherlock, I will be quite naughty!"
Later on, there was some kind of film on the television, but I didn't notice anything, because he had started cuddling again right at the beginning of the cinematic crap and he was, well, very enthusiastic today.
"You must think I'm crazy. I've only known you for a few days. But I'd be ready to marry you right now."
The flat was full of police. Lestrade was furious that Sherlock had just walked away from the scene of the crime and not told him about what was on his mind. So he had arranged for a drugs bust.
"Well, Sherlock's business seems to be booming, Dr Watson, since you both are .... well ... buddies."
"I almost laughed my head off," Molly said. At the moment, however, her voice didn't sound like she felt like laughing.
Besides, the whole thing is a good remedy against my omnipresent boredom. Boredom is probably the plague of the highly intelligent. My brain always knows everything in advance and finds no pleasure in the small, strange activities of "normal" people, who for me are not much more than ants.
John shook himself as he realised how awful that was, to really distrust everyone in his close circle, and especially those who were close to him and cared about him ...
"Will you drive me home, Mr Holmes? I find that since you're obviously spying on me, for which I'm grateful for once, you might as well do me that service."
Over the years, my organization has developed unhealthily because too many people knew the name Moriarty.
"I give you my word, Molly, that when I officially reappear, I will confess to the press that I am giving up the fight against you. That I have never beaten you and that I have no chance against you. That I acknowledge that you are the greater genius of the two of us."
I saw Mike Stamford from a distance. He was sitting on a bench and seemed to be waiting. Slightly nervous and willing to hate the one he was about to meet.
Mycroft, whose nose had turned a little red, looked at Lestrade and said quietly, "Yes, Detective Inspector."
He immediately arranged this, of course, and was deeply puzzled that the tracking showed this address.
"Well," Sherlock said, "I told Mike this morning that I was looking for a flatmate. And now he introduces me to an old acquaintance who's just back from military service in Afghanistan. Not hard to draw the right conclusions from that, is it?"
And yes, I have a confession to make here: it was a little hard not to come with the name "Sherlock!" on my lips.
The next moment Sergeant Donovan stepped into the office with a phone receiver in her hand and astonishment on her face.
"True," he said. "However, I am a consulting detective, the only one in the world. I invented the profession."
"And what do you think you can put on the line for me? What do you have to offer, Sherlock, that could be worth my death?"
John had not, as hoped, completely collapsed and had not shot himself with his army gun, which would have been a good solution. Nor had he been admitted to a sanatorium, she would have known about that, for her contacts were far-reaching and her henchmen everywhere.
"That's true enough," he said. "I know someone who said something very similar to me just this morning. 'Who would share a flat with me' were his words."
Unlike Sherlock, Mycroft Holmes was in the know about what I was doing on those evenings. Or what I wasn't doing. I knew that, and I found it out very clearly one night when I was under a bit of stress.
There was nothing I could do about it, because equal rights for everyone, and Sherlock believed that I, too, had cheerfully screwed other people.
I ordered, the food came, we dined aristocratically out of cardboard boxes with cheap wooden chopsticks.
If he had his way, he would spend the rest of his life packing bags for Sherlock and doing similar mundane things that hindered the great detective's thinking.
It was me who made sure that he at least ate something now and then, by making sandwiches or bringing food from the Chinese or Indian restaurants.
Besides, the most important trump card the other side had, Sherlock Holmes, was no longer there to help.
The permanent ticket for a certain line of the Tube and the packed lunch, both of which implied that he had been on his way to work.
It was like the minutes before the door to the good room opens at Christmas, where the presents lie ...
Well, he would have to tell Scotland Yard his suspicions, but first, before he did that, he wanted to talk to someone in private.
I looked up hopeful. Did he now understand that I didn't want all this nonsense about an open relationship?
The door opened and an elderly lady, who greeted Sherlock as "Mrs Hudson" and who was obviously the landlady, stepped out. She greeted Sherlock warmly. She seemed to like him very much. Sherlock had already told me that he got the flat cheaper because he had once done her an invaluable favour.
And yes, he meant it. He was many things, and not just good things, especially interpersonally. But he was bitterly serious about this. He gave Molly Moriarty his word, and he wouldn't break it.
"John, let's start by repeating what we just experienced. Today. And tomorrow. And the day after. ...and …"
Several others who know they work for Moriarty but have never seen my face. No, that's wrong; many of them have seen it, only not knowing that they were looking into J. Moriarty's eyes at that moment.
Reporters had been calling for days. Writers from some newspapers, but also TV stations and radio stations. He was even ambushed at the door. Poor Mrs. Hudson was already at her wits' end. John had offered to do the shopping for her, because the good woman was just completely annoyed and didn't want to go out the door any more.
"Look, you and I don't know anything about each other. I have no idea where we're meeting. I don't even know your name!"
As confused as John was now, as upset and deeply hurt, he would certainly not be able to continue his investigation effectively. With a bit of luck, the post-traumatic stress disorder that had had him tightly in its clutches once before would grip him again this time, perhaps even taking him to the brink of despair. To the edge of the shadow, and a step beyond. After all, Watson still had his army weapon, Moriarty knew that, and, well, one could certainly help a little with the last decision ...
I spent the night with Sarah, who still believed a little that John Watson would want something from her. Silly thing. She played the preening virgin and let me spend the night on the sofa. Good, at least I didn't have to come up with an excuse, because she would have bored me so much ....
Sherlock was alive and here with him. He hadn't died jumping off the roof of the Bart, and obviously not, as Molly had believed, in Serbia.
While Angelo placed a candle on our table with the words, "That makes it more romantic!" and I called out again, "I'm not his date, okay?", I laid out my strategy.
But on the other hand, here she was alone with two men on the roof, each of whose weak point was the other.
"Sherlock" was by his side whenever John set about going through the files, papers, etc., relating to the Moriarty case. He no longer went to the Yard, he worked through it all at home. He had justified this to Lestrade by saying that he was too exhausted, that all this had taken too much out of him. And that wasn't even wrong.
Well, there was still a lot to do, because even though Sherlock had been dead for some time now, Moriarty's organisation had been unravelling. Piece by piece and at the moment the situation was getting a little uncomfortable. Not critical yet, Moriarty wouldn't let it get that far.
For the fact that the message had come to her mobile, from whoever, clearly showed that someone, anyone, knew that she, Molly Hooper, was in fact Moriarty.
While the water ran into the tub, I leaned against the wall for a moment, looked at myself in the mirror and recapped the current events.
Come on John, he's a grown man (...well...), and you want to, and we're both just bursting with excitement.
Well, and last but not least, Connie Prince was killed by someone close to her. Someone who had also always been catlike friendly to her.
"No, John. I gather from our text conversation that you don't approve of my scheme. Which doesn't make sense to me. But because I don't want you to be angry with me, I didn't do it. I thought it best to wait until you got here so we could discuss it."
"I'm sorry, John," Sherlock said again, looking at John with such an expression of concern and affection that it warmed his heart.
"Moriarty? Are you here? I've brought you something! The Partington plans. That's what they wanted, wasn't it? That's why you pulled all that nonsense, isn't it?"
How he worked out that the woman was from Cardiff; that she had lovers; that she wanted to stay in London overnight, that the word she had tried to scratch into the wooden floor before she died was the name 'Rachel'; that there had to be a suitcase.
The next morning I woke up and the bed next to me was empty. I got up, snuggled in my bathrobe and went in search of Sherlock.
Because, by the wheels of the Big Dipper, I was the only one who could know that he had a chance of solving the puzzle!
He had pushed me onto the sofa and was now lying over me. He kissed me so intensively that I felt hot. His lips moved down my neck where he nibbled a little bit. At the same time he began to run his hands under my shirt and wipe it off me.
He hated himself for his inability to see Sherlock's intentions and stop him from being so stupid. He hated himself for having been such a bad friend. So unable to see what was going on.
"Dr Watson, you seem very loyal very quickly. Very well, it is up to you. However, you should be clear why you are so quick to side with him. Your left hand betrays you."
After all, I didn't want my Richard to be in danger. After all, he had to be safe and sound and a free man for all that I still had planned for him.
Mrs Hudson scurried around the flat, putting something in its place here, tidying something up there, when she finally held the daily paper in her hand.
"An absolute pain in the arse," I said. "A maniac. An egotist. An absolutely fascinating person. I have to put up with quite a bit from him because he pushes me around and uses me as a personal maid. But he's also brilliant. Just to see him at work, it's ... wow."
I took the whole thing as an opportunity to let off some steam, have fun and meet nice people. But not once did I go beyond dancing and talking. There would have been no lack of opportunities. I may not be of classic male beauty, I can't keep up with Sherlock. But I do have a certain charm and charisma, I am open and sociable, and that certainly makes some hearts fly to me.
"John, did you remove the gunshot residue from their hands? No one would condemn you, because at the end of the day, that was emergency aid you gave. But ... it's better if you don't come to court in the first place."
Still, I was curious to know what had been left in writing. What had the taxi driver missed? It didn't really matter, the taxi man was nothing more than a puppet I had dancing on a string.
I first had the painting examined and checked by experts from my own ranks to find out any weak points. Artistically, there were none.
John was bowled over. But ... it fitted. As much as he wanted to find reasons that it didn't, it did fit.
John had knocked over the coffee mug and the brown brew was flowing across the floor, but he didn't care.
In retrospect, I almost regretted a bit that Sarah survived, because she was starting to get on my nerves quite a bit.
I hate that Sherlock fucks other people. Him thinking I've done the same when I've been faithful to him all this time.
They trickled out of the present, like grains of sand falling from the top of the hourglass into the bottom.
"Your therapist thinks the tremor is the result of post-traumatic stress disorder. She thinks it's triggered by memories of the war. Fire her. You're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly still. You don't fear the war, Dr. Watson. You miss it."
Moriarty was restless. For the very first time since the battle with the great detective Sherlock Holmes had begun.
The next murder was a trivial matter and I actually instigated it for two reasons: firstly, because I wanted to leave Sherlock a few more clues.
John felt better. Slowly but surely the pain was subsiding, for Sherlock had, it seemed, returned... for his own sake more than anything else.
It was the last case in the series and I wanted to use it to make Sherlock realise that the man who had committed all the murders in the last few days and created the fashionably extravagant explosive vest chique was really and truly Moriarty.
Sherlock's wonderful, deep voice rang out. It echoed off the tiles and in this way sounded even deeper and fuller than usual.
He wanted to know if he would succeed in choosing the right capsule. He wanted to know if he could do it, wanted to know which would be the right capsule. Even if it cost him his life.
John let his gaze wander over the table and to his greatest amazement, he had to notice that both the second teacup was empty and the second sandwich had disappeared.
So far so good. Yeah, it's nice with Sherlock. Yeah, I love him and I love every single day, every single minute with him, even if he sometimes drives me crazy with his quirks.
"Yes," he said, "that's perfectly all right. As long as your heart is mine, I can share your body with others."
She had worked closely with Sherlock, but also with the police, had investigated all the victims that came up in the Moriarty cases, which meant she could manipulate everything to suit her needs ...
"Yes, Sherlock, I promise. I'm sure you'll be angry with me at one time or another. Promise to stand by me, won't you?"
When John got out of the shower, he brushed his teeth and did his hair, the first time in weeks. His nose wrinkled at the pile of sweaty clothes he had been wearing until just now.
When he reached the door again downstairs, he remembered that it wouldn't be of any use to him like that and picked it up again. The whole situation deeply unsettled him, even though he was still a soldier at heart and had experienced far more dangerous and dramatic situations, God knows. But facing an open enemy on the battlefield was simply different from this worry about the hidden enemy.
His hands went under my T-shirt and began to gently caress my skin. Then he pulled my shirt off and threw it to the floor.
So convincingly I can perform such feelings, such actions of social interaction between people, that I can have them eating out of my hand if I want to.
"I'M BORED!" he shouted, and threw himself sulkily onto the sofa. Dressed in silk pyjamas, dressing gown and bare feet, he was a sight for sore eyes.
"Tell me, Sherlock, these suicides, there are three so far... isn't that something you should investigate?"
And when it was over and she could have been rescued by the police, she began to describe Richard's voice.
"Yes, John. You're looking at Moriarty. The Moriarty. The Great Moriarty, to be precise. And believe me, I've enjoyed tricking you and Sherlock."
He would have looked for him. And maybe he would have found him. And then he would have helped him with whatever Sherlock had been up to. And then, yes, maybe Sherlock would still be alive.
After all, I had intended the psychosomatic limp to gradually get better and disappear through meeting Sherlock. Well, my mind had probably decided over my head (what a pun, yes, I'm good at that too!) that it would be better if the whole thing happened much faster.
I wanted Sherlock to take me to his crime scenes and get in touch with his investigation. So it would be convenient for me to act as a doctor, as he would distrust people with a police background.
I smiled with satisfaction. To outsiders, my grin would've been borderline stupid, but I was too happy at that moment.
For that I threw thirty million to the wind. But my God, I have amassed enough fortune to buy a hundred such paintings if I wanted to. I have it deposited all over the world in accounts, gold deposits and other property. So I won't be in trouble if something breaks away somewhere or I can't show my face in a country.
He had watched video footage of every possible incident associated with Moriarty. Of interrogations of convicted or suspected perpetrators thought to be connected to Moriarty. Hours of it.
But Mike Stamford. Who showed himself to be the good warm-hearted friend ... a perfect cover for a criminal with sinister intentions. And besides, Sherlock had been at Barts almost daily, and had included Mike in much there. Mike, in turn, had been with them often ...
"At first, not as much as I had hoped. Some things happened quite quickly that made it clear that Moriarty had found out I was alive. So I staged my death a second time. I got myself captured in Serbia. Mycroft was there. He got me out, although he was a bit late... some scars I owe to that fact... well, as I said, he got me out as planned and made it known in a credible way that I was dead after all. Moriarty's henchmen would certainly have done a good job too, if my brother hadn't arrived in time .... Anyway.We burnt down my prison to avoid uncertainty and so I had a clear run."
I couldn't watch the current TV series that ran in prime time in the evenings because we were so fucking busy. But well, if I have to choose between "How I met your mother" or "How to give Sherlock a blowjob", then I choose the latter. Definitely.
"Well, Molly, we need your decision. One thing's for sure, you're not getting out of here. You don't have a chance to escape."
Well, they would escape the spear over the flame, as would Donna herself if Mike did what the letter told him to do, which he would find in his mailbox just before the drama began.
I knew because it was the one the killer had pulled out of his right jacket pocket and that was the poisonous one.
But then... I have to admit that the rest of the evening was running over me like a bunch of buffalo.
Fucking morons. When this was over, she'd take these people to task. They would be sorry, although they wouldn't have too much longer to regret their mistakes. Molly would...
Harmless assignments, like introducing someone, throwing a letter in a box, placing a certain ad. That sort of thing.
This was John. And as much as he might have learned from Sherlock. John was still a man with a warm, human heart and with more feeling and understanding than was good for him. And that made him vulnerable.
John was a doctor, and even if psychology had only been touched upon in his studies of general medicine, he knew at least a little bit about the multi-level phases of mourning. It was part of it that it took a few days to really understand what had happened.
Sherlock talked at her, got out where she was and called Lestrade, who immediately arranged everything else.
So would he recognise that a Janus-faced being, a person with two faces was living in his immediate environment?
I feel hate when someone feels equal to me and especially when I mingle with the crowd and play a normal person, I feel it when someone doesn't give me the space I deserve. For example, bumping into me or not listening to me. I have already killed for that.
They were too far away and it was too noisy around us, so I couldn't hear what they were talking about. After all, I was a bystander to what was happening, so I was standing behind the barrier at the side of the road.
When the time came, I dragged Sherlock to a small Asian takeaway, right at the time of broadcasting this person's strange makeover show.
"You two should talk in private. And I need some explanations too, but there's time. First of all, I'm glad you're back, you snoot."
"No," he said. "Molly, of course, knew I didn't jump to my death from the hospital roof. After all, she helped me do it. But ... she didn't find out about Serbia. She must think I'm still alive... Isn't that a little bit bad? Treating her like this, keeping my death from her? On the other hand, I am actually still alive ..."
"Well, John, we've been a couple for a few minutes now and, as far as my theoretical knowledge of interpersonal relationships is concerned, a stable relationship between two loving partners that I'm willing to entertain with you includes the occasional sexual encounter."
They do real things, no question, and what they do may affect me. Yeah, they breathe, they eat, and they excrete the remains. They can hurt me and they can cause me pain and they can make me feel pleasure... and yet, they're... different. They're not important.
To hell with the costs. Mycroft should pay for it. After all, he had done enough damage, had contributed his share to Sherlock's fate, and John felt he owed him a debt.
I had a lot of plans for Richard, although at first he was only supposed to have one or two rather small appearances.
"But ... Sherlock ... You were just there ... and you never said a word... well, except for those whispered words a few hours ago, but ... I thought I only heard those in my head too!"
For example, I find it extremely amusing to be able to name every bone that one of my henchmen breaks in a prisoner. It adds spice to interrogations...
Well, I suppose the only right thing would be to go down there and set the record straight. Make it clear to Sherlock that I, for one, was not interested in an open relationship.
"Very well, doctor. In that case, that honors you. But even I find it hard to believe that it will last. Do you have any idea how difficult this must be for Sherlock?"
The man seemed smarter than he appeared at first glance. I would have to keep a close eye on him too.
Sherlock muttered something, but otherwise ignored me. In love with me or not, in some ways Sherlock just stayed Sherlock, and I was quite happy about it. After all, I loved him for who he was.
I was ready and, with Richard's help, pulled John Watson's anorak over the waistcoat so that it would not be seen at first glance.
When he regained consciousness, he was sprawled on the sofa. Lestrade sat in the armchair opposite him, still bewilderment in his gaze, and held a glass of an amber liquid in his hands, trembling slightly.
"I couldn't, John. You're ... a good friend, an invaluable assistant, and more ... but if there's one thing you can't do, it's lie. You're a horrible liar and you wouldn't have been able to keep up such a deception credibly."
You might think that's an exaggeration, but you have to remember that I intended to portray John Watson for a very long period of time, and in doing so I had to stand up to the SEEING EYES of Sherlock Holmes. And I simply believe that if you want things to work one hundred percent, thorough and meticulous preparation is essential.
To buy myself the time I began kissing my way down his stomach, licking over his belly button and teasing his thighs until he finally moaned lustfully. Last but not least, I took his penis in my mouth and began to suck him off.
There was only one person who knew that Sherlock had studied the structure of the solar system following this case for that very reason.
It felt so great to stand here in front of him and just throw in his face that the one he trusted so much; the one he had let get so close to him like hardly anyone else .... ;
Anyway, Sherlock stopped the taxi and then, well, then I was almost a bit disappointed in him. It turned out that he was only almost as good as me after all. He was far more intelligent than the great mass of ant people, but I was still superior to him.
I killed that boy, Carl Powers, because he was getting on my nerves with his smugness. Nobody has any business being annoying me and nobody has any reason to be smug but me.
I knew Sherlock well enough by now to know that of course he would be all over this case. After all, in the conversation with Mycroft, the words "of national importance" had been uttered, and to a certain extent Sherlock too felt an obligation to his nation. For Queen and England ... pah ...!
Every now and then, visitors came to the Baker Street flat. First of all, Mrs Hudson. She had simply wanted to check on him. However, after he had once shouted loudly at her, completely against his habit (he had apologised immediately afterwards...), she had got into the habit of knocking and announcing herself and no longer just barging in on him.
"I really got to work on Moriarty's network now. And I managed to take out the important heads one by one. With the help of Mycroft's people and contacts, we kept up the channels of communication within the network, so for a long time it didn't really show that we were going after one by one. We sort of subverted and infiltrated and hollowed out the network. It's on the verge of collapse now, one coordinated effort and it's over. And the most amazing thing is that all signs point to the fact that we have managed to hide this fact from Moriarty. He's just brilliant, yes, but not as much as I am. In the end, it proves that my mind is superior to his after all."
"That's why I liked him from the start. He was also very understanding. He just wanted to dance a bit, have some fun, that's all. He has a boyfriend, you know? I just told him my problem."
"What ... if I ... if I myself ... without knowing it ... was Moriarty's informer... and delivered my best friend over to be killed?"
Lestrade, on the other hand, looked dumbfounded at the phone, from which now only the toot of the line sounded. A strange call, in more ways than one. He shook his head and went on his way.
While he frantically said goodbye and made another appointment with Molly, Sherlock remained completely impassive, bent over the microscope.
We both claimed to have no heart. For me, that was true. Not in the anatomical sense, of course, because I can't change biology either. But in a figurative sense it certainly did. God, what for? What should I care about the feelings of some ant-people?
The guys who were supposed to raid a few small shops, petrol stations and the like all over the city at just before midnight and the ones who were supposed to phone in a few bomb threats were also ready. These were diversionary tactics to keep the Yard on their toes so that we could have a bit of peace and quiet in the swimming pool, even if Sherlock should get the idea of calling the cops. Unlikely as that was.
"John, I like you, and I appreciate you, and given your situation... so what I'm saying is, if you ever want to live the open relationship... so anyway, if you'd like to try a little BDSM and experience what it feels like to be a sub... I'd like to try some games with you, after all you're handsome and ..."
Again John went into the living room and grabbed his laptop. Again he researched the internet on the subject of grief psychology.
The day came when all the preparations had gone as far as they should have, and I decided to send the letter to Mike Stamford so that in three days' time the first meeting between Sherlock Holmes and "Dr. Watson" could take place.
He had to admit that it felt good to have the warm water flowing around his body. It seemed to wash away some of the dullness.
This was going too far now. The fact that he drank the tea he prepared for "Sherlock" without consciously noticing it was something he had somehow already got used to. Even if it was still so strange.
This was our first case together. And through everything that had happened, everything I had done or said, I had managed to awaken Sherlock's interest in me and to bind him to me in a certain way.
Someone stepped into the room, and to John's greatest surprise, a man he had in no way expected stood before him.
By now Sherlock had figured out why the killer was murdering. He was paid for each murder and the money would go to his children when he died. And he was terminally ill... he just didn't realise that it wouldn't be the disease that would kill him.
It was purely self-protective, because I was interested in Sherlock from the first moment I met him, but he wasn't interested in me. He was married to his work.
"You know I can't, sweetie. We both have our jobs to do. Moriarty pays us well, but he won't tolerate any Self-empowerment."
Or John Watson would refuse. Then at least he would know that his brother had someone loyal at his side.
The young hotel attendant smirked at us knowingly. Well, the room smelled of masculine perfume and sex. It was impossible not to notice what had been going on here until a few minutes ago, and the food we had ordered implied that it was about to continue in exactly the same way.
Well, yes. Surely the guy had learned a thing or two from Sherlock, and Sherlock had come frighteningly close to the head of the most far-flung criminal organisation. Thank God he'd taken the bait he'd been given and mistaken the little actor for Moriarty. Well, Sherlock was dead now and could not regret his mistake.
He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment, torn by feelings that were a mixture of fear, hope, panic and hope again....
He didn't necessarily treat me like a "normal" roommate would treat you. He was Sherlock Holmes. He took the right to chase me around, to let me do most of the housework on my own, not to mention the shopping.
However, I would simply be better able to have Sherlock dance to my tune if I starved him on the outstretched arm. I wanted there to be an ever-present, never really expressed sexual tension between us. It remained in the background, but was always palpable.
"… but when it comes to people, I'm just clumsy. It was irrelevant to me anyway. It's only mattered since I met you, John Watson."
I put the groceries in their place and went to Sherlock, who was sitting on the sofa in the living room with his hands folded under his chin.
"Mycroft Holmes. I am a man, and I enjoy sex. Yes. But now I'm with Sherlock and I'm not going to shag around! Jesus Christ!"
"...well, almost no feelings at all. And if it does happen to me, I can handle it differently than my unstable brother."
Yet I trusted him in that I would have put my life in his hands and known with one hundred percent certainty that it was safe there.
We had a lot of fun together and in the end we agreed to repeat the whole thing for the next evening.
No, he thought then. No. It would be easy, but he knew there were people who cared about him. And he didn't want to ... no, he couldn't bring himself to leave such a ground zero as Sherlock had done.
His heart was pounding madly. They were in a damn tricky situation here, but John could hardly take his eyes off Sherlock at that moment, feeling deep down how in love he was and how hot he thought he was.
"She's right. As glad as I am that she won't be torturing anyone anymore ... I'm going to miss her a little."
No, not even that was true. She didn't fear failure per se, she feared others finding out about her failure.
The thing was, I wouldn't have minded ending up in bed with Sherlock tonight, playing "relationship". The thought of faking a passionate relationship that even fooled the partner in the relationship and would involve a lot of sex for my pleasure appealed to me immensely.
Mycroft phoned his assistant, informed her of his absence and asked her to postpone the meeting with some CEO.
"Information. Nothing dramatic. Just keep me informed about Sherlock's daily life. You know, I care about him. Constantly."
He didn't mind being Sherlock's sidekick, his lapdog, in the eyes of others until the end of his days, because he knew now that Sherlock saw so much more in him.
The bomb man, he had said. And he obviously didn't seem to be so easily fooled into thinking it was a woman.
And it didn't get any better that day when the police investigation had finally come to a surprising conclusion and the press couldn't help but announce in big letters and lurid articles that Sherlock was completely vindicated:
"But what if it does? I want so much to live with you, John. Want to experience so many more things with you. Can't we just run away?"
It got louder again, until he finally threw himself onto the sofa laughing, clawing at me and looking as if he couldn't breathe. I was a bit in a huff, I didn't think it was so funny, and sat there with my arms crossed in annoyance.
It was a very special situation, so exposed to Sherlock, my dearest, to lie there and caress me in my most intimate places.
Nothing could really have forced him to take that capsule. It was clear by now that the taxi man's weapon was only a lighter. And he himself would have ... well, Sherlock would be able to incapacitate him with a single blow.
And there remained this dark, somehow painful look from Sherlock's eyes, which I still couldn't identify.
Rubbish, John thought, as he pushed himself out of his chair and went into the kitchen to make himself some tea. That might all be true, but still. He had never been more than Sherlock's assistant. He was nowhere near as smart as the detective, well, maybe a little more practical. Quite a lot, actually. But still. To carry on Sherlock's investigative work - no. He just didn't trust himself to do that.
If I had wanted to, I could have had one or two pretty women in bed. Or even the one or other good-looking guy.
In the beginning, you are in shock. During that time, you don't understand what has really happened. Even if the intellect understands, the soul still does not. You feel as if the deceased is just not here. Would come back. Would be on the other side of the world or in the next room, but in any case still there.
And when he became conscious, he was overcome with grief. It came like a great surge of darkness, fear, but mostly pain. Such a dull, deep pain that lay on top of him and woven a cloak of blackness around everything, so that he could no longer see the life around him.
Okay, okay, that had been unnecessary and I should be careful not to jeopardise all my planning by such actions. Well, John's brother only existed virtually until now. Turning him into a sister wasn't much of a problem in the end.
You can't fake a doctor, I know that. But I didn't have to, I have a medical degree, next to another in chemistry. I did it at a young age out of boredom, and because I thought that it certainly couldn't hurt to have some medical knowledge when choosing my profession.
It didn't happen until the following day and I let two more days pass after that because I was amused by the way Sherlock was getting more and more restless by the hour. It was a mixture of new-found boredom on the one hand and great impatience and tension on the other. Because, of course, it was clear that the whole affair was not over yet and would go on.
"I must offer you my deepest respect, Dr Watson. It seems you have succeeded in what we have tried so unsuccessfully for so long. Moriarty is unmasked."
John looked at him with wide eyes. Deep inside him, warmth flooded up. It felt good, for Sherlock, the self-proclaimed sociopath who supposedly didn't have such a thing as feelings because they only prevented him from thinking to mean anything.
As he stood there in front of me, with his big, soulful eyes, red lips and slender, boyish figure, I couldn't help myself. I pulled him to me, pressed my body against his and clawed my hands into his tight buttocks. Even though he was bugging me a bit at the moment because he was obviously planning to cause trouble, he was just sexy as hell and I felt like giving him a good fucking before I called him to order.
When he had finally left the carriage with the other passengers and was standing on the platform, he looked around frantically. But the figure - had it really been Sherlock? - was nowhere to be seen.
Her name was Nina and she was pretty, charming and funny, and like me, she just wanted to spend a nice evening without any further intentions. She was recently separated, had no interest in a new relationship yet, wanted to celebrate the new freedom.
When I had published this on my blog, the people at the Yard had mocked him heartily. First and foremost, and how could it be otherwise, Donovan and Anderson. Even Lestrade, who seemed to like Sherlock somehow, had grinned.
"Not at all, Dr. Watson. Before you get too upset, let me get to the other side. Yes, I think a relationship kept open like that would be best for Sherlock, at least for now. You know how quickly he sets himself under pressure when he doesn't get things right. If he wants to do justice to someone, which usually involves clients whose cases he wants to solve, but now you as his partner whom he wants to make happy, he puts all his resources into this task. And because of his psychological history, which I include his addictive tendencies, it is important to avoid such a situation."
Then Sherlock showed me and Lestrade the photo. It showed an empty room and I was curious to see if he recognised it straight away.
"But that's not important for you either, Richard. You'd better not ask too many questions. It's what you're supposed to embody. That's all you need to know."
You can't simply call a shareholders' meeting, pay out the last dividend, dissolve the structures and dismiss the employees.
I went back into the other room and fetched my glowing-eyed beau. I untied him and escorted him into the bath.
For three days this went on, and he had the feeling that everything was still upside down in his mind, but that he would still manage somehow.
Sherlock crouched down carefully and looked at the sports shoes, but without touching them. He too seemed to realise that the situation was not without danger and that the criminal, who obviously had it in for him, was not to be made fun about.
She hated that. To find herself in a situation where she had no choice and had to do something she wasn't one hundred percent convinced of.
So he decided to postpone thinking about it until later and just enjoy the "here and now", because he liked it much better than "just a few hours ago", and what "tomorrow" would look like was completely unclear to him at the moment.
John had just grabbed another cup of coffee from the vending machine in the hallway and had gone back to the small office he had been given at the Yard.
If somebody wanted to get the rich hereditary uncle or any other unpopular person out of the way, I assign the one of my people who seems to me to be the most suitable one.
As far as the case was concerned, he found out the whole thing quite quickly. For me, that meant that this source of income was gone, but honestly, compared to everything my organisation encompassed, that was peanuts.
"Well..." , I said hesitantly. "I think so. We should keep quiet about it until this whole thing is over."
Such was the general opinion of the press, and by now the public, and the demands that he should take a position on this were growing louder.
He had me, and I was very amused by this, write a message on the mobile phone with the certainty that the murderer would read it.
"Well, I ... you know for me it's not quite easy to find someone to share a flat with and I got the tip to turn to you.  You might have some advice for me."
"Sherlock? Sherlock...!" shouted John as his Sig Sauer fell from his hand and hit the floor with a loud crash.
The strange, unusual, painful and yet at the same time liberating emotionality of the situation urged him to unite his lips with Sherlock's ...
I had "caught" him doing it one day when I came home from duty at Sarah's surgery. He was sitting in his armchair reading a book called "Sun, Moons and Planets".
She took a deep breath, and then ... she wouldn't embarrass herself by showing anything like uncertainty, after all, she wasn't Molly Hooper, she was Moriarty, Ha! ... so she walked slowly, deliberately, yet resolutely towards the small enclosing wall on the roof of the hospital and looked down into the depths.
I stormed noisily down the stairs, only to scurry light-footedly and quietly back up again, because I wanted to eavesdrop a little.
I decided at that moment to deal promptly with the young actor who was to portray Moriarty for Sherlock.
When I then decided to return to you, I was standing here in front of the door and you opened it. And there you were standing in front of me and it went through me like lightning. I put the pieces of the puzzle together in a split second and it was clear to me how I felt. And so I decided at that moment not to speak to you, so I wouldn't say the wrong thing and you wouldn't turn away from me. And that's how it all came about."
She wanted to cash in. But I knew that if it came to Sherlock solving the mystery, she would turn tail and reveal what she knew.
More difficult was the tanning of my skin. I wanted to have a tan on my face and hands that indicated a long stay abroad, and just my face and hands so that it was clear that it had not been a pleasure stay.
Would it actually happen that Sherlock didn't figure it out? Well, that would have been very disappointing.
"Sure, it won't be easy for me. But the knowledge that you will then, in truth, no longer exist and no crime, no suffering will be expected from you, is worth it to me. My ego will be quite bruised, no doubt, but well, I'll get through it."
And fifthly I had the next laughing fit because my poor, overworked brain told me that if Sherlock would not share this passion in the long run, I could still turn to Greg Lestrade with confidence ...
After all, in my role I only had the measly armypension and the not exactly lavish salary from the practice.
"Sherlock, you've been discussing the at that stage completely hypothetical sex life of our at that stage completely questionable love affair with your brother, Mycroft, YOUR BROTHER!“
"Dead about two hours. Stabbed through the heart. He was, it looks like, on his way to work. Working ... well, I'd say in a pet shop or something similar. Married ... but the wife probably didn't do it. My guess, though, is that he wasn't a random victim ..."
The school consisted of two wings. Sherlock and the taxi driver were in the right wing of the building on my instructions.
On the other hand, after holding it under the nose of the horrified Molly, he had pocketed the note.
"Really, John?" a voice sounded in his head. Startled, he looked up. It sounded so much like Sherlock.
Bill Wiggins was one of Sherlock's informants from his homeless network. A shrewd young man who had done us quite a service.
I was as excited as I'd been since I was a kid at Christmas. Stupid comparison, I know. Whatever. Anyway, I was in a kind of frenzy. I felt like I was on drugs.
My sniper at the swimming pool had instructions to call a specific mobile number on a set signal from Richard. He, no, I must be specific, she would of course comply. She was an extremely shrewd young woman, quite sexy to boot, called Mary Morstan.
They actually discussed, with John talking and Sherlock responding with body language and gestures. The whole thing was productive and John enjoyed the exchange.
"John," he whispered, "John, would you help me? I've never done anything like this before, I don't know how to do it, but..."
Would Molly in this way, even in death, still harm him, Sherlock, and his John, and in this way triumph, as it were?
Apparently his state of mind was worse than he had feared. Not only was he hallucinating his deceased roommate. Now he himself seemed to be unconsciously performing actions to make himself believe that said roommate was actually here with him. This was now clearly taking on very worrying features.
I intended to take my time until I caused Sherlock's death. But at that moment I gave myself permission to bring it forward if necessary, if I couldn't bear to wear these clothes any more.
"You told me," he said. "When you told me about his death in Serbia. You couldn't have known that if you'd really just been Molly. It struck us as odd and then we investigated."
He opened the document where he had summarised the results of his investigation and showed it to Sherlock.
"Good, that's good. I love you too Sherlock, and if you don't finally kiss me now after all I've been through, I' m going to smash this teacup over your fucking stubborn skull!"
At that moment, not a breath of air seemed to stir, not a sound seemed to ring out, not a breath seemed possible.
The only thing she regretted was underestimating Sherlock. Sherlock and damn his lapdog, John Watson.
Moreover, he had solved cases together with Sherlock for several years, and it was assumed that he had learned a lot from the consulting detective. Had studied his methods at close quarters. So who, if not he, would be able to bring Moriarty to justice?
"Yes, yes," John said, " and sweet little Molly let herself be used .... Is that what you're trying to put on me here?"
Across town, Mycroft Holmes had received a call from one of his subordinates about half an hour earlier.
Nothing bad, really nothing at all ... just meet "John Watson" on a certain day in the park, take him to Barts and introduce him as an old friend from his student days.
"Sherlock, I heard you the first time. You did what, please? You discussed our then-not-even existing relationship with your brother?!"
I am a real, a proper person. All the others are... just images... just holographic reproductions... dropped stitches in the knitting patterns of the universe. Impressions of my cerebral cortex or flaws in the matrix. Whatever you want to call it, they're not real.
These two loved each other. Moriarty found love, like other human emotions, superfluous and disturbing. Quite disgusting, in fact. But she could use it wonderfully, it had always worked brilliantly so far.
"Of course I would. John, I want to make love to you. Soon. And I want it to be perfect. And so I, too, am going to take advantage of the fact that we have an open relationship."
A short while later, Dr Watson had cause to look downright horrified, while my inner Jim rolled on the floor laughing instead as Mrs Hudson said:
"Sherlock, I've fooled you. I never wanted an open relationship. I only went along with it because both Mycroft and Greg advised me to, but mostly because I didn't want you to put pressure on yourself, because you felt you had to give me more than you were ready to. I know you slept with others to learn and be ready for me, so that's fine with me and I'm not angry or anything like that.
Perhaps, he thought to himself, his mind would realise that Sherlock no longer existed if he later saw the second cup still untouched here on the table. Maybe he should make himself a sandwich too? Yes, that was a good idea.
"But of course, my darling. Look, I love you. We've been a couple for about half an hour. And I'd just be a rotten bastard to give it up so quickly and just for a little disagreement, don't you think?"
Making a young, self-absorbed man who was not strictly defined in his sexuality sexually dependent on me should not be particularly difficult for me. I would enjoy feigning great love for him.
But I just couldn't imagine him doing something like that, you know... I wanted Sherlock just the way he was.
"Oh God, your nemesis," I said, because as John Watson I had no idea who was standing in front of us. "The one who offered me money to spy on you!"
And why did he miss his brother so much, even though they had never really agreed on anything, and even though he knew exactly ...
He had probably learned a few things from Sherlock, but on the other hand he was not really a clever man. He was a man of the heart, Sherlock's sidekick. Perhaps also Sherlock's soft teddy bear, who had warmed his bed on cold London nights ... in any case, no one to be seriously worried about.
She still knew that she was one of the brightest, even most brilliant minds on the planet. There was only the one superior to her. As much as she hated to admit it, it was a fact. And as big and inflated as her ego was, as strangely twisted and skewed as her brain was, as much as omnipotent fantasies dominated her thinking and delusions of grandeur were undeniably a part of her personality - she didn't even deny it herself - she was not inclined to overlook immutable facts.
"But then you came and gave me your friendship. Just like that. Without asking for anything in return. Sure, you would have liked more consideration sometimes, I know that, but you didn't get it, I'm just the way I am.  But I still had your friendship. No conditions. And whether I wanted it or not, I started to reciprocate that friendship."
So when the request had come to me to get her out of the way, I had immediately and happily gone along with it.
An old friend. That would make sense, too. Maybe not a real good friend, more like an old, casual acquaintance.
"Will it be an Self-empowerment in his eyes that we have become so close?" he asked. Clever boy. He was asking exactly the right questions.
And while John took a sip of soothing Earl Grey with a squeeze of lemon, just the way he liked it, and incidentally just clung to his teacup, Sherlock began to explain.
So he turned around, ran upstairs to his bedroom and opened the small drawer containing his old military weapon. He weighed it in his hand indecisively for a moment, but then tucked it into his waistband and slipped his jumper over it.
Sherlock's brain was like Moriarty's. Logical, quick as a flash, unravelling the threads in the game immediately.
Because unlike me, he has one, even if he denies it, and unlike me, he is able to feel compassion and the like.
"And then, when it's all over, no one can forbid us anything any more. We'll both have enough money for a nice life. We'll buy a house... great cars... travel around the world... And if you want ..."
Nothing was to be expected from Sherlock, with whom she still had a crush. She lived completely below his radar.
Oh, to hell with it. He had now decided to go for it, and if he was going to do something, he was going to do it with full commitment. He would just put up with the resulting inconvenience.
"So that's the way it is, Greg," I finished my monologue. "Can you understand that I'm not doing so well with all this right now? Can you imagine how you'd feel if Mycroft came up with a very odd suggestion like that?“
"I never really thought I was that naïve," he said quietly. "But more and more I think I'm too inclined to see the good in people .... oh I don't know either."
Sherlock's gaze was on me for a moment before he turned back to the window. In those few seconds, I saw a sort of shadow seem to settle over his eyes.
Sherlock and I lived our lives, which had not changed much compared to the time before our relationship, with one notable exception:
There were some decidedly funny moments as Sherlock, always under the guise of the case, torpedoed my dates with Sarah. Sarah was the extremely attractive doctor in whose practice I had recently started working as a substitute.
But the fact that he was now apparently starting to prepare the tea unconsciously so that his head could believe that "Sherlock" had done it, that was going too far. After all, that would not be entirely safe, apart from anything else, just think of boiling water and the like. And what would come next?
He shone with some decidedly insensitive remarks that might have pleased me if I hadn't sensed they were just fronts. He was not as cold as he pretended to be.
I could be relieved that I was such a good doctor and especially that my patients liked me so much. I just seem to have a knack for sick people and their mental states, at least my patients idolize me, and that has saved my job a few times when Sherlock has really torpedoed it.
Richard sprawled in front of me, on this large hotel bed covered with wonderfully fragrant, floral-white bed linen and pillows in orientally lavish quantities. Naked, as some spiritual omnipotent entity assumed by most of the western world had created him.
"I had only one chance to prevent that: by dying myself. Now, of course, I had no intention of really stepping down from the stage of life. So my brother and I turned to Molly Hooper. And she helped us... well, at least I survived. When you found me on the pavement, I wasn't dead, and the body that was in the pathology later was someone else's. ... Anyway, the point of all this was to put a smokescreen on Moriarty."
I am blessed with a downright friendly-looking, harmless-looking average face. And yes, that is a blessing indeed.
Oh and that text was from Lestrade. He had a case for us. It was the case of the tapeworm carcass nailed to the church door. But it contains some very unsavory details ... so I didn't post it on my blog.
Clever, intelligent, skilful. But he too had allowed himself to be manipulated when it mattered. Had investigated Sherlock and contributed to his death. He wouldn't be a real threat.
"Well," Sherlock went on to say, "first I actually wanted to be with other people ... to practice ... but I couldn't. I thought about you all the time and I couldn't do it and I didn't want to. And then I met Charlie. A very likeable person. He's a little like you."
When we said goodbye, we walked a few more yards in the same direction. Before we parted, Greg stopped, scratched his neck again and then said (we remember the "fuck, yes!" that had my life still up it’s sleeve?):
Well, Sherlock didn't need to be told twice. He took John's chin in his right hand, pulled him gently towards him and kissed John.
Well, I would have to keep a bit of an eye on Mycroft Holmes to make sure he didn't get on my trail, because he was not to be underestimated. But neither was I, so what the hell.
I had hit my target. Not well enough, though, because that damned ant of a taxi driver was still alive.
I knew him well enough now to know, or let's say, to suspect from time to time, what was going on in that brilliant but socially awkward head.
And he stood up and kissed Sherlock. It was a fleeting little kiss on the lips, but it made it clear to everyone how John and Sherlock felt about each other. Lestrade grinned broadly and a small, subtle smile appeared on Mycroft's face.
Whoever wanted to do the unmasking could do it. John was through with it. He was out of it. One way or another.
"Mycroft is... Well, Mycroft is... He's very, how shall I put it, conservative in bed too. That's OK, and we have a pretty good time in bed too, but... ...but I don't think that's enough for me. I just likes it a bit harder now and again.“
I reacted immediately and, by pressing a single button on my mobile, caused a text message to go off saying "Boom!" and my snipers to shoot the old woman down.
"The best." Yes I know my tendency to show off will get me into trouble again. But what can I do when I'm actually the best.
He told it to ME, and again I laughed to myself. It was wonderful, so wonderful to imagine that he had not been able to find out who was behind the murder of Carl Powers all these years. He couldn't even prove that it was actually a murder. No one had believed him.
When John went through the files, he did so aloud. He read aloud, voiced his thought processes, shared his conclusions with "Sherlock".
"Mr. Holmes, it's about Dr. Watson. He's just come out of the house where Dr Hooper lives. He looks completely distraught, you should take a look."
It was botulinum again. So a toxin that has a direct relationship to Sherlock through the Powers case.
For days, weeks, he sat in his armchair in the living room at Baker Street, brooding and giving in to despair. And if Mrs Hudson, the good soul of the house, had not placed a tray of tea and a few sandwiches near him now and again, he would not have eaten or drunk. He did, automatically, as one breathes. But it meant nothing to him.
Well, for a while Moriarty had kept the feet still. After Sherlock Holmes had thrown himself off the roof of that unspeakable hospital and the little actor who was supposed to impersonate Moriarty had shot himself on commission (of course, the little one had not known about this part of the plan, he had believed the pistol contained blanks ...), the whole world had believed that the greatest criminal who had ever existed was dead. And Moriarty had kept a low profile for a while, only allowing actions to take place that were out of the public's and the state's sight.
"Two choices. You let us arrest you. Without much fuss. Come before a proper court. And you won't have a chance to blackmail anyone, my dear. We've cut off all your connections, believe me."
And amazingly, it helped him. It really advanced his research, going over the whole thing with "Sherlock". It made his thoughts more focused, his conclusions more logical, his insights clearer.
He hung up and dialled Miss Hooper's number afterwards. Maybe she could tell him why John was so rattled.
"Well, John, and then he took me back to his place. and his partner, Chris. And they showed me all the... everything."
Well, that should be fine with me, there was no doubting that I was the white king in this game anyway. Because the colour white is the one that wins much more often due to the advantage of the first move.
And he rushed out of the door, which slammed into the lock behind him, leaving Sherlock and John alone.
The figure ... John, slowly calming down a little, decided to simply call the vision "Sherlock" despite all inner resistance and outer circumstances, even though he was aware that this did not necessarily make his problem any better. It would certainly be much healthier if he managed to let go. But after all, man is not an automaton, and there is no button with which one can simply switch off unwanted mental problems.
I didn't want to go to bed with just anybody. I just wanted to sleep with Sherlock and if I couldn't, I wouldn't sleep with anyone.
"Yes, John. Rather original, isn't it? If I wasn't a consulting detective, that might have been an interesting line of business ..."
It was only when we had calmed down after a few minutes that Sherlock picked up his mobile. It had been Lestrade, and Sherlock called back immediately.
So I pushed him away from me and hissed, "No, I wasn't screwing around. I don't have to fuck wildly around to feel good about myself!"
"Well," I snarled, "Well, I know now anyway. However, Mr Holmes, didn't you say earlier that you had no feelings in your life?“
"Sherlock," he said, " ... you said the only one who knew about your ... 'second death' in Serbia is Mycroft."
"Well, we'll see," I said, and decided to go out the next night. I hadn't planned to, well... but I wouldn't tell Sherlock where I was going, and if he thought I'd had a sexual adventure and he was feeling better, then so be it.
Yes, I liked that. I just wanted him to believe that Sherlock's brother, about whom I had of course found out as much as I could, was behind it. Nevertheless, Sherlock's brother was still a big unknown in my equation. For what I had found out was not much and what little was very worrying.
And that's when I realized with the full force of realization that this must have been his first, his fucking first, his very fucking first orgasm.
Finally the mobile beeped and Sherlock received first a picture message and shortly afterwards a phone call.
"I'll make some fresh tea first," Sherlock said quietly. John nodded. Tea, the panacea if you were British through and through, as he was.
I turned back to the almost inedible chicken dish and had to admit for myself that in some ways I had hit something of a low point at the moment.
I swallowed and said, "No, it's all right. Well, have a good time. And, uh, take care of yourself, okay?"
When I arrived upstairs, to my surprise, instead of Sherlock, I found DI Lestrade sitting on the sofa.
He was far too flashed by the fact that he was the lover of the great criminal Moriarty that it simply didn't occur to him to cause trouble in any way. On the contrary, he wanted to make me proud and show me that he was worth me.
"Yes, Sherlock. We may be enemies, and I may hate you, but I actually believe you. It amazes me myself, but I trust you on this. Between us mad geniuses."
To please me, but also to prove to himself that he, the ingenious Sherlock Holmes, would be able to overcome even these difficulties without any problems.
He buried his nose in the hollow of my neck, obviously liking my scent. I pushed him gently but firmly towards the bedroom.
"Sherlock, I know you mean well. But please, just leave it to me, who I get into bed with and who I don't, OK?"
"Well, listen," I said. "If you're going to play Moriarty, you can't do it in clothes from the discount store. That requires style. You'll be sent the appropriate clothes and other equipment in due course."
For a few weeks he had been working as harmless little Jim in Saint Bart's, in the IT department. Shortly afterwards, he had already started flirting with Molly, the little sheep. Molly had taken the bait immediately, probably because she was starved for male attention.
He had not the faintest idea. For the time being, it was probably best to wait until Sherlock said something.
At which point, all I could do was scream, and Sherlock just looked at me in complete confusion, because he had absolutely no idea what I was getting so upset about.
A short time later we were standing outside a small restaurant called Angelos. There he found us a table with a good view of the address given.
A short time later, the police were there. Inspector Lestrade and his men, also Forensic Anderson, an ambulance with a doctor and paramedics.
Moriarty looked at the corpse lying here, in a place that seemed made for it. A place where a corpse seemed as natural as a duck on a pond or a little flower in a park.
"So you don't have a girlfriend?", I asked. I had the feeling that the vibes that were here at our table right now were so intense that they should almost be visible to everyone else in the room.
He was beautiful. Pale, delicate skin, still youthfully fresh. A curious glow in the dark, soulful eyes. Experience and yet uncertainty at the same time. Freshness, hope and depravity all in one.
But still, the route we took was quite effective and eventually we reached the street where our path crossed that of the taxi.
"Lestrade and his men are standing by. Mycroft and his men are backup. And you're cut off from all communications, so you have no chance of contacting your men. So you are left only and exclusively with our terms."
Plans that had been ripening for a long time and were supposed to lead to profitable success were smashed.
I've also slipped into roles from time to time in the past. It's part of the job and I actually like doing it. But over such a long period of time, day after day and actually around the clock, because even if I didn't spend my time with Sherlock, I moved in "our" environment and had to behave accordingly, I hadn't had that in this form before.
The next evening I got dressed up and went out. I knew some interesting clubs in town. Some from earlier years, too, where you were in good hands if you were interested in the same sex.
Time was running out and he had not yet come to any conclusion. There were only three hours left until the ultimatum expired.
A few ideas popped up, were discarded. But at the end of the deliberations, it was clear what would now happen within the next few days.
John wasn't stupid, and he was already aware that all the things he was advancing to avoid taking that step now were nothing more than excuses to delay the inevitable. But he didn't have the strength to fight it. So much had happened, he felt burnt out and drained and didn't have the energy to take all the necessary steps.
What a fool he had been. He had trusted Molly. She was the only one he had never suspected. He had even trusted her enough to tell her about his suspicions of Mrs Hudson. Mrs. Hudson, holy! How could he!
I can sum up the most important things: bad clothes, bad food and lousy TV. I was just used to better things.
After all, she had succeeded once before. Of course, it had taken years, but that was no problem. After all, it would be interesting and anything but boring.
She took one last breath. The air was cool and damp, cutting into her lungs. The smell of London, something she had always liked, would be the last thing she felt before she hit the pavement.
Yes, it was still great fun chasing criminals alongside Sherlock. Yes, I was still not bored, not for a second. And yes, it was still obvious that I was playing my role perfectly.
"Dr Watson, yes, I am of the opinion that feelings are a weakness, a flaw that leaves a person vulnerable and blocks some capacity for the mind to function properly. I myself do not allow..." He hesitated -
And that would make it clear that "Moriarty" was behind it all. Had murdered Carl Powers and that awful person on the television. That he'd run the company Janus Cars and orchestrated the wonderful explosives games.
"Well, he's not usually the one who's hands-on, he organises it all and stays in the background himself. No one ever has any direct contact."
Once even Mycroft himself had stopped by ... but he had been dealt with quite briefly by John and had not tried to show up here again.
He didn't touch John, he just looked with wide anxious eyes, and then, as John sat up, rubbed his temples and said, 'Don't worry, I'm fine,' with clear relief in his gaze.
"Well, I'm up here alone with you two. I'm going to wipe you out, and then claim you killed each other. And then the world will see nothing in me but desperately distraught Molly."
Now I kissed gently and lovingly down his neck, further over his body, came to his nipples and nibbled them gently.
And last but not least: the way he had been arranged. The way the dead man's identity card had been pressed into his hand. That, in turn, made it clear that he had been a purposefully chosen victim.
"My dear John, you are anything but stupid. You may not have Sherlock's - or my - intellect. But you do have a keen practical mind, and we both know that you have been instrumental in solving a case with it on more than one occasion. You really should stop hiding your light under a bushel."
He was an extremely good-looking fellow with a finely cut face and expressive, dark eyes. He was also talented. It was almost a bit of a pity about him, but sacrifices have to be made and it didn't matter which (as long as I'm not the sacrificed, of course).
He didn't ask me the next morning what it had been like. I tried something like a mysterious, satisfied smile. And I noticed Sherlock's attempts to see what I'd experienced, and I also realised that he wasn't getting down to the details.
"Two possibilities," Sherlock said with a calm blaséness that made John grin. Yes, that was Sherlock as he knew him. The way he had been before ...
"Look, I know I'm not the ideal flatmate. Physically battered and traumatised ... had some unpleasant experiences in Afghanistan and now I have nightmares, flashbacks and ...  So if you don't want to put your acquaintance through that, then I should probably go now."
Sherlock was looking so insecure again, I couldn't blame him this time. Somehow the situation was strange. I started giggling.
That was when it had started. Me, who committed the crime. He, who could have solved the crime if he had been listened to.
Sherlock would have preferred to simply ignore this request, since his brother had brought it to his attention. On the other hand, he was well aware of the importance of these plans. And as much as he would deny it if it were brought up to him, he loved his country and would therefore take care of the matter.
Sherlock was sitting in his armchair, had put the laptop on the table and had folded his hands under his chin. His thinking pose.
I solved cases with him and I ran around London with him. Through narrow streets and through dark nights. I saw the battlefield, I saw the fight and the war of the good guys against the bad guys.
When I came home that night, I was pretty tipsy. Because now that Gregory Lestrade had also made advances to me, I desperately needed some more alcohol. So I went to another bar and had a few more glasses of whisky. To tell you the truth, I was more than tipsy.
"John, an emergency call just came in, there's a body in the hallway at Mrs Hudson's place on Baker Street!"
Getting to that point was a difficult thing. Which was mainly because, although everyone in the world suspected we were involved, I, on the other hand, was always and everywhere shouting out, "I'm not gay!"
"Well, it just so happens... He's different for me, you know? Not the way the world knows him, cold and calculating... I know the other one, the real Mycroft.“
He had found the suitcase, which was now in his, our? flat. He had discovered the mobile phone missing and deduced that it must be with the murderer.
"No," she breathed, "It was all a charade to get a chance to put a stop to Moriarty's network. But they captured and killed him in Serbia a few weeks later. I'm sorry, John. I, uh... I thought you were in on everything ..."
"Detective Inspector Lestrade? Listen. It's about John. I don't have much time to explain, but he's in a worrying condition. I don't know what's happened, but in view of the fact that, as we both know, he still has his old army gun, I think it's appropriate for you to check on him ... Yes, thank you. Detective Inspector... I owe you a favour."
I memorised the young room waiter's face for two reasons. Firstly, who knows, maybe I would have a little time for him at a later date ... and secondly, it was necessary to prevent him from memorising my face too thoroughly, as well as that of young Mr Brook.
"Is that why you showed up here a few weeks ago? Came back to me while I thought I was starting to hallucinate?"
"Never mind. Come on, Dr Watson. Whatever's behind this, it's not hurting anyone.I'll take you to him."
To know, to experience, to find out ... that was what his mind wanted. That was what chased away his boredom.
"Of course I will do what is necessary immediately," Mycroft said, and John was sure that his measures would be as quick as they were effective.
We enjoyed this peaceful, tender togetherness. Yes, I too can enjoy such things. But usually as the calm before the storm. It was not quite to my taste that the storm had to be cancelled this time. I couldn't harm a hair on the little one's head, that wouldn't help the cause. Well, I would let off steam elsewhere.
I would promise him everything his heart desired, of course without the intention of keeping even a part of it.
I described our cases from the point of view of John the ant, overflowing with admiration, but not omitting Sherlock's weaknesses. He had no idea about the solar system because he had simply erased it. I, of course, had also mastered this technique. However, I had learned that EVERYTHING can be important at some point.
"Don't touch me!" he shouted angrily. "I know what's going on here. You're Moriarty. You had him killed in Serbia. You killed all those people. Committed all those crimes. And all under the mask of little clueless Molly Hooper. But I know now!"
"Mickey Clifton," the ID card said. A few phone calls later through Lestrade, and they knew he was the owner of the Cat's Paradise pet shop.
He was like wax in my hands. He was so easy to manipulate in terms of his personality if you knew which buttons to push. And knowing something like that is just part of my daily routine.
"I know that you were in Afghanistan. You were wounded there and that's why you returned. You have a brother whom you don't ask for help because you don't get on well with him. He is probably an alcoholic. And he recently left his wife. Your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic and rightly so. That's enough to start with, don't you think?"
Once again it showed, that the old adage is right, that the truth is simply the best lie, if you are bold enough to tell it and clever enough to present it in such a way that no one will believe it.
So I was just going to get up and go downstairs to clear the air and make things right when my mind started to wander.
When I could hardly stand it any longer, I pushed him gently away from me, whispering heavily breathing:
"It took you a really long time to figure it out. Well, since Sherlock already disappointed me so much, though, I shouldn't really be surprised with a simple stupid person like you, should I?"
Then we looked around a bit. Everything seemed to be in order, the terrain was set. All right, of course, I had already had the pool searched before we arrived. After all, I didn't want to put myself in danger unnecessarily. After all, the world needs me. I am Moriarty. There is only one of me and therefore I have to make sure that nothing happens to me!
