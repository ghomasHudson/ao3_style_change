lucid enough to register splash after splash of hot cum landing on his stomach and chest, some even hitting his neck, and he knows when Cas’s significant weight collapses on top of him that Cas feels every bit as good about the orgasm he just had as he does his own.
Dean shakes his head and walks away from him, taking the coffee with him into the living room to where Liam is still glued to the television. “Hey kid, how’s it goin’?”
Cas laughs quietly. “It’s not exactly difficult to cook a roast. Though I don’t want that to hold you back from moaning like you did a second ago.”
Cas has been keeping from him, keeping from him and warning him this whole time that he would hate Cas for it. Wait.
“I dunno. You never hook up at home, so I’ve never seen you with anybody. Guess I haven’t really thought about you
“Sorry,” he says quickly. His face is positively flaming now that he’s been caught staring, so he turns away from Dean to take a few steps away from the door towards the couch. “Do you want anything to drink?”
Dean looks around him, realizing the obvious solution literally lies at their feet. “Let’s go swimming.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that or to the way Cas’s voice holds a low promise his body still responds to after all these years, so he finishes knotting the tie and then applies pressure to Cas’s shoulder to have him turn towards him. The knot isn’t as straight as it could be, and Dean’s hands reach out to fix it without his permission.
“Papers were filed in October, and when you were unreachable for 90 days following, the divorce was granted. You’ve been officially divorced since January 10, 2020. I can get you a copy of the decree for $41.58 if you’d like it.”
Dean’s dealt with more photographers than the average person, and it surprises him to see that Gabriel seems to know his shit for a small-town photographer. He always manages to pose Dean so that the right side of his face isn’t facing the camera, and he does it in a way that doesn’t seem forced or obvious, which Dean appreciates more than he can say. Between Gabriel doing his job like a damn pro and Cas’s warm smiles and reassuring touches, Dean’s more at ease than he ever could have predicted by the time they’re ready to head to the chapel.
“I want you, too,” Cas croaks out, and holy shit. If he thought Cas’s voice was wrecked before, it’s nothing compared to the grit that’s in it now. “But you’re right. We should stop.” Dean nods, but he takes a few more seconds to sear this image into his brain before he moves. “Is it weird that I like having you on top of me?”
“I’m sorry I had to keep this from you, Dean. Nobody outside the royal family knows. It’s only ever shared between married couples on their wedding night.”
“I’m glad we did this,” Cas says once they reach his house. “I feel almost re-energized after being out in the fresh air.”
He and his dad don’t exchange a word while his dad finishes drawing up the contract in duplicate, and although his dad keeps telling him to just sign it already once it’s prepared, Dean takes his time and makes sure he reads every word over three different times before he finally prepares to sign his name on the dotted line.
“Doesn’t really matter,” Dean says quietly. “I don’t exactly deal with shit like this in a healthy way anyway. Just sorta push it down or whatever so I don’t have to think about it.”
Dean shrugs, but his finger is tapping nervously against the arm of the chair. “I already told Sam I’m fine.”
He looks up at Dean over the rims of his glasses, which is when he realizes he still has them on, so he tugs them free to let them hang around his neck.
“Jesus,” he breathes. Dean’s lips are blazing a trail down the side of his neck now and he knows there’s no way they’re going to make any progress like this, so he rolls his shoulder to shove him off, earning himself another laugh from his
Instinctively, his hips start to rock in the back-and-forth rhythm his body craves to reach its release, causing a needy little sound to escape him when he not only gets the friction he was seeking, but feels the first nudge of Castiel’s cock against his hip as well.
He follows the pace Dean guides him into, slurping all the way to the top to lick across the blunt head before Dean shoves him right back down until Dean’s thick cock is entering his throat. Again and again he swallows Dean down, saliva dripping down his chin and coating Dean’s cock as he bobs his head, the wet, messy sounds only seeming to drive them both on faster and harder until Dean has ahold of him by the back of his head and is fucking his face without restraint.
“It was mortifying. All of these girls were clamoring for my attention when the one person I really liked didn’t like me back.”
when he opens the door to Dean looking unfairly handsome in a dark pair of jeans and a green plaid flannel shirt undone with a black tee underneath.
and immediately steals his breath. She’s poured her voluptuous body into an incredibly tight, strapless red top that’s laced up the front, and a short, black pleather skirt. She’s wearing fishnet stockings and extremely high and narrow heels, and even just walking on to the stage - slowly and deliberately to the music - it’s easy to see she exudes confidence.
in such dainty panties without anything substantial to hold it back, and the heat on his face spreads down to his chest.
Cas jumps like he startled him, and whirls around with a sheepish smile on his face. “I thought I would just take stock of where you put everything.”
“You’re probably right.” It helps that Cas looks like he doesn’t want Dean to leave anymore than Dean wants to leave. “I’ll walk you out.”
Thinking about Cas using the lube to jerk off right here in this very bed, coming all over himself night after night is definitely not something he should be doing when he’s already this worked up, but vision after vision springs to his mind anyway. He imagines Cas twisted into a pretzel, struggling to finger himself deep enough, sweaty and frustrated that he can’t reach his prostate on his own, leaking all over the sheets and his stomach and...
Just like that, Dean,” Castiel urges him. Keen to follow his direction and hear Castiel say his name the same way again, he keeps his lips sealed around him and introduces his tongue, gently massaging the tip of his cock with slow, teasing circles.
“Yup. I was just thinking about coming to wake you so we could get her up for a bottle, but you beat me to it by about twenty minutes,” Dean tells him.
“Believe me, I’m getting that,” Dean laughs. Then he stops to rake his eyes up and down Castiel, and while he has no idea what Dean sees when he looks at him, he knows whatever it is is responsible for the quiet little whine Dean makes in his throat. Dean forces his gaze away and actually curls his hands into fists before he shoves them into his jeans pockets. “I don’t trust us not to try for more if I touch you again, and I know we’re not ready for that. So I’m just gonna... go...” Castiel nods, amused by the way Dean seems unable to look him in the face. “I had a great time, Cas. Seriously the best. And you’re way too fucking hot for your own good,” he adds emphatically, surprising a laugh out of Castiel. “Yeah, you laugh, jerk,” Dean says under his breath, but there’s no heat behind it. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I lied. We, uh, kinda had a threesome,” Dean admits. “Lisa was on the pill, but I mean... nothing’s one hundred percent, right?”
“Coincidences,” Gabriel replies. His goofy, sarcastic, happy-go-lucky demeanor fades, and for the first time, Dean wonders how much of a facade it really is. Because he never thought Gabriel was stupid, not by a long shot, but the golden halos of his eyes staring back at him now seem so much sharper without the usual mirth dancing in them that he wonders how he didn’t question this sooner. “People going into battle and not coming back right after they question a decision he’s made. Hell, nobody actually having a first-hand account of the war at all.”
Cas takes a deep breath and nods. “Other than that meeting at the lawyer’s office, this might be the most nervous I’ve ever been. I wanted you to come sit with me hoping that being close to you would calm me down the way it usually does.”
Dean’s laughing quietly when he opens up his menu. Castiel decides to follow suit, but he barely glances down at his own before Dean says, “I hope you don’t mind me taking you here. I know this place isn’t much. The food’s cheap and the atmosphere is more like a bar than the nice kind of place you probably expected. Hell, your chair doesn’t even have a back to it.”
“It wasn’t bad at all, and I’m glad for the picture. Like you said, there aren’t any others of just Grace and I, and I’m happy to have them.”
She sits up straight like she just stumbled upon her first real clue. “And what you have isn’t?” Dean doesn’t say anything,
He tugs Cas in for a soft, lingering kiss that has heat gathering quickly in his groin. He pulls back to kiss along Cas’s jaw, nipping his way across until he finds a spot just behind his ear that makes goosebumps spread along Cas’s arms. “You wanna share a shower?”
And even though Cas is teasing, there’s not a hint of a joke in Dean’s voice when he replies. “I’m the luckiest son of a bitch alive. I love you so much, Cas. And I’ll tell you what,” he says as an idea occurs to him. “When we finish the house that’s waiting for me now, I’m gonna take some vacation time. At least two weeks. We’ll take Liam to Universal or Disney or something, and then take a long weekend just for me and you.”
Admittedly, Dean’s stomach is a little soft right in the middle, but it’s nowhere close to off-putting. He had thought at the time that it would feel nice to run his hands over the slight swell of his belly to feel the difference between the softness there and the rest of Dean’s firm muscles, and when he woke up with his hand right there, he knew he was right. He didn’t allow himself to caress Dean’s stomach or slip up to his strong chest, but that didn’t mean he didn’t want to. Even now, just looking at Dean’s broad shoulders makes his blood heat up, and as much as everything else inside of him is urging him to climb back into bed with Dean where he belongs, he turns away to get some clothes to change into for his run.
Dean blinks rapidly, forcing away the tears that spring to his eyes as Castiel’s wedding vows echo in his ears. “C-Cas,” he chokes out.
“And if Cas is out here on the couch, I’d wake him up if I had to walk past him to use the bathroom,” Eileen says. “He could really startle me if he woke up and I couldn’t see him.”
“Would you shut your trap already? It’s my birthday, I wanna go, and you’re going with me. End of story,” Dean says, shooting him a cocky smile to soften his words along with Castiel’s resolve.
Just like that, David starts purring up a storm, and as his eyes close, Dean has to admit he’s pretty cute with his little pink nose and white whiskers. The little guy moves his head this way and that, obviously guiding Dean’s fingers where he wants them, and Dean finds himself reluctantly charmed by this cat that so openly seeks out affection when he wants it.
“But as satisfying as I’m sure that would be, if I’m being completely honest, that’s not what I fantasize about anymore.” Dean licks his lips, having difficulty trying to suss out what that’s supposed to mean when his dick is hard and his heart is thumping with anticipation. “Do you remember last night?” Cas asks next.
“Can I just come right out and get something off my chest?” Dean nods, still trying to collect himself. “I was really nervous before we got here and now that I know I already fucked up, I honestly feel like I might throw up.”
it feels. He keeps his legs wrapped securely around Cas as Cas ravages his neck, sliding his hot, wet lips along Dean’s skin as he grinds filthily on top of him. Dean can feel the heat building rapidly within him, feel himself getting unbearably close to his peak already, and all it takes is two big hands squeezing his ass and one more solid thrust of Castiel’s thick cock up against his before he loses the tenuous grip he was struggling to keep on his control.
It feels sensational. Everything has, all night. The whole meal, their evening together, watching Cas get down on one knee and hearing Cas say he loves him, and when the subtle scrape of Castiel’s facial hair against his skin feels at least as good as all of that in a completely different way, Dean’s more than ready to end the night with a bang.
They’re either really, really in sync or Cas is scary good at reading his body language, because he breaks the silence by narrating Dean’s thoughts. “You feel this too, right?” Dean can only nod, so far past words in this moment he couldn’t put them together with super glue. “God, Dean. You drive me crazy. I can’t get enough of you.”
That’s putting it mildly. On second thought, it’s probably a good thing Cas didn’t talk to him back then. He was really pissed at the whole fucking world for a long time once he realized what happened to him, and Cas being there wouldn’t have changed that.
The grin disappears when Cas’s hand curls around the back of his neck and pulls him up for a kiss, because when Cas’s tongue pushes past the seal of his lips and flicks against his sinuously, it’s no longer funny. This isn’t teasing anymore, and Cas’s hand pushing down his back and curling around his hips to lift him until their groins are aligned is a hell of a lot more than he expected to happen. Cas’s hands slip up over his hips to get two handfuls of his ass, and when he feels his husband’s half-hard cock dragging against his, he is suddenly and enthusiastically one thousand percent on board.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know how to tell you. I don’t even know what to do! Everything happened so fast and I’m—”
“Oh shit,” Dean says quietly, turning back to Castiel with wide eyes. “Can you—can you bring these back to our table? I’m gonna need it when I’m done.”
“Probably from the wedding fund they saved up for and didn’t need since you paid for everything you could,” Cas says. “And besides, he’s already outbid, so don’t get worked up over nothing.”
“Well, to be fair, I had no reason to think you’d go and fall in love in a week,” Chuck says, laughing a little. “Who
“I get if you guys don’t want to share that kiss with the whole world,” Jess starts, “but I’m just sayin’, watching the video over made it clear that you were singing to just one person, and seeing Castiel come into the frame and kissing you afterwards is probably the best advertising you could hope for.”
With one hand on his belly and one gripping onto his desk, he hauls himself to his feet and straightens his shirt. He walks around to the corner of the counter and signs the invoice, trying to surreptitiously take in as much of Dean’s welcoming scent as he can without getting caught. Once again, that seems to rouse his baby and he huffs a laugh at her persistence when he feels another kick.
Dean leans back against him and tilts his head back to kiss him under his chin. “You’ve been trying to pawn him off on me since the beginning.”
just to please Cas that his cock is starting to fatten up again already. “Guess you know what to buy me for Valentine’s Day.”
“Forgive me if this is insensitive to ask right now, but other than what we’re here to deal with, how have you been, Dean? I hope it’s not out of line to say you’ve crossed my mind a time or two over the years.”
Cas chuckles and turns his head to deny him his kiss, but that exposes the side of his neck in the process, so Dean redirects his lips and lands there instead, mouthing at his golden skin while his fingers slip into Cas’s soft hair.
Dean looks to Bobby, who seems reluctant to leave the room, but does so after Dean urges him by lifting his eyebrows.
He can almost hear Dean’s voice in his head as he begins to fall apart: a quiet, rough, breathless sounding,
Cas smiling through his tears is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. “Yes,” Cas breathes, already falling to his knees in front of Dean to cup his face in his hands. “Yes, my Rembrandt, it would be an honor to marry you.”
“Yes, all of that, and this time...” Dean purposely isn’t looking at Cas, but that doesn’t mean he can’t tell Cas just looked at him, especially since Sam and Jess look at him at the same time. “She wrote her phone number on the receipt and left it on the counter.”
Cas leans in slowly and presses a kiss to his unscarred cheek, and Dean finds it extremely difficult to breathe all of the sudden. Then Cas kisses the tip of his nose, and the eyelid that doesn’t have the scar on it, and Dean realizes Cas is kissing him everywhere he isn’t scarred. That’s all it takes to make him start trembling from head to toe, because it only took a few seconds and Cas is already out of unblemished skin on his face. The rest of him is scarred and disgusting. His entire body is tense with fear and self-hatred, just waiting for the inevitable, waiting for Cas to finally see how ugly he is now that Cas is up close and personal.
There’s a twinkle in Dean’s green eyes now, and like always, his teasing mood is infectious. Just making eye contact has that crazy connection between them sparking to life. He drifts closer without fully meaning to, and he’s sure Dean does the same considering they’re only inches apart now, but the moment is broken when the elevator doors open.
Castiel leans in to kiss him one more time. “Will it be better for you to come out and see everybody as they come in, or do you want me to come get you after everybody’s inside?”
“Uhm.” Dean swallows. Hard. Why did he bring this up? “Well. N-not really, I guess. I just don’t really know what you’re comfortable with.”
Dean hums his agreement, blissed out and more comfortable than he thought he could be half naked in bed with the hottest man he’s ever seen. “Don’t leave, kay?”
Cas smiles, and says, “And I look forward to meeting them.” Cas takes another step forward so that their bodies are much closer together and releases his fingers to run his big hands up his arms and loop around behind his neck. “But they’re not going to change my mind. I like you, and not because I’m pretending, but because it’s impossible not to.”
Cas stops, slips his hand up to the back of Dean’s neck, and waits for their eyes to meet again. “Dean,” he says softly. “I—”
It’s 5:30 by the time they’ve finished eating, and Liam asks if he can play in the backyard. It’s a nice day, so there’s no reason to say no. Liam grabs some of his dinosaurs from his room and then the three of them head outside while Donna chooses to watch through the patio door. Apparently Liam needs to burn off some energy, because he runs in circles with dinosaurs in hand for almost ten minutes before he flops into the grass and starts setting up a battle between them.
There’s his brother, Sam and his fiancée Jess, dressed as The Man With The Yellow Hat and Curious George, his best friend Charlie and her live-in girlfriend Gilda, in costume as Wonder Woman and Batgirl, Benny and his wife Andrea as some vampire and Buffy The Vampire Slayer, his half-brother Adam and Dean's childhood best friend Jo, who are a
It turns out there’s a lot more stairs than Dean would have willingly climbed if he knew what he was getting into beforehand. His thighs are burning and they’re both breathing hard by the time they get to the top, which is when Cas wheezes, “Holy shit.”
Castiel hasn’t been to LAX for a little more than a year. As familiar as he is with this airport by now, he’s never flown here alone. He’s never booked his own ticket, and he’s never had to follow the signs leading him towards the taxi pick-up by himself like he is now. He’s more nervous than he thought he would be, and his heart is racing faster than is probably necessary once he makes it outside, but he remembers what Dean said the first time he met him here and looks for a taxi with the official seal of Los Angeles Department of Transportation so he doesn’t end up like those poor people in that
“You want to have sex with me,” Dean repeats. Cas nods without a trace of hesitation, and as Dean’s mind catches up with what Cas just said about getting a blow job first, he sky-rockets past panic and lands firmly in hysteria.
He and Cas share another puzzled look between them as they step into the elevator, but the second the doors close, Dean whirls on him and demands, “What the fuck was that all about?”
“See, isn’t that more interesting than whatever art thing Hannah was babbling on about the other day?” Dean says with a grin.
Dean ruffles the hair on the back of his head before answering. “I uh, usually sleep without a shirt on.” Castiel can see Dean’s cheeks starting to redden, but before he can assure Dean that’s fine if that’s what he’s comfortable with, Dean blurts, “But I can keep it on if you want. I don’t want you to feel like I’m pressuring you to sleep in bed with me half-naked. Whatever you’re comfortable with.”
Dean doesn’t wait to hear Sam’s arguments, just walks towards Castiel with his bowlegs and stupidly attractive backwards ball cap, and says, “Come with me.” Dean leads the way through the kitchen and back towards where Sam’s office was, and Castiel follows in silence until they’re alone in the office with the door closed.
They’ve been through more boxes of condoms than Cas could begin to count over the last six months, so this is a recurring issue.
“She did indeed,” Cain says, smiling down at him fondly. “But she was always the easy one to train.”
“You want me to suck your pretty cock, Cas? Make you come so hard down my throat that I can’t swallow it all?”
Dean takes two steps towards Jess, thinking Cas could use a shot or two to the face to even things out. “Shoot Cas a few times and we’re square,” he bargains.
“You ain’t bad yourself, y’know,” Dean replies, and then Cas is all warm flesh and hard lines pinning him right back down to the bed, and absolutely everything else goes flying out of his brain except for how unbelievably good it feels. Heavy, firm, solid,
In fact, he should probably try to stop thinking about it altogether. Yeah, it had been some of the best sex of his life, but that doesn’t mean he should focus on it. Not when Cas is only a few walls away, looking way too good with his messy hair and exposed collar bones from that damn button down he chose to wear around the house.
Cas surges up to his tiptoes and wraps his arms around Dean’s neck to kiss him just as enthusiastically as Dean had kissed him, and he’s so fucking happy that he picks Cas right up off the ground and spins him around like they’re in some cheesy rom-com or something. Cas tucks his face into his neck and laughs against his skin, and Dean’s joining in by the time he sets Cas down and he ducks his head to scent along Cas’s
“Actually, yes. I’m fairly certain I have the paint mixed to be identical to the actual Impala, but I’m going to do a test run on another diecast car to see how it looks on the metal before I paint the one I bought for you. I was thinking I would do that this afternoon, actually.”
“It’s a sad day, because we’re all still really sad that your mom died,” Cas tells him. “But even though it’s hard, we don’t want to pretend this day never happened. We want you to remember your mom forever because we know how much you love her.”
mixed in for the first time in a day. Cas turns his head so that his nose is in Dean’s hair, and he figures Cas is probably doing the same thing to him.
Liam laughs, but Cas leans in, pressing a kiss to his temple. “You poor thing. You must be starving.”
“Busy?” Cas echoes. “Busy doing what?” Cas’s eyes go all wide and innocent, and even though he knows Cas is faking his reaction, he’s already backing him against the wall for a demonstration.
"Hang on a damn second," Dean says, still trying to breathe through his laughter. "I was at the grocery store, Cas. I wanted the recipe for the -"
It’s the hook he’d been working on the other day that’s bothering him. He’s been working on it for a while and a part of his mind is always looking for the right inspiration, the right words to fill in the blanks where the lyrics should mesh with the music he’s written. Sometimes it takes him weeks or even months to put them together, and sometimes the words come to him so fast he can’t write them down fast enough.
“Because the contract with the Angels has already been signed. If Dean is unwilling to marry Princess Castielle because of his sexual orientation, of course, that’s his choice. You know as well as I do that I can’t force him to enter into a marriage.”
“There’s comments?” The nausea returns with a vengeance, but before he can work himself into a full-blown panic, Cas starts talking.
Dean’s fingers brush through his hair and down to the base of his neck, the cool metal on his skin letting him know Dean put his ring on as soon as he came home as usual, and their mouths pull apart. When Dean takes half of a step back, they both have small, happy smiles on their faces.
“I think I started falling for you the first time I tried to kiss you and you shot me down with your thumb like this,” Dean tells him, lifting his hand to brush over his cheek.
he breathes, his heart aching from changing the verb tense. “Didn’t have any other relatives. I don’t know what she’s been up to since we broke up but she never had a lot of close friends, so you and me might be all she has. Had.
Dean makes a muffled noise of approval against his lips as he squeezes his ass, gently at first, and then so hard he brings Castiel up onto the balls of his feet. As much as he enjoys the groping, what he really needs is some friction on his cock, so he grabs Dean’s hand and drags it over his hip and between his legs until he gets his wish.
Dean doesn’t respond, can’t find his voice to deny a damn thing even if he wanted to, but his insides are
His jacket is pushed unceremoniously from his shoulders as Castiel’s mouth ravages his neck, then Castiel’s hands are climbing the ladders of his ribs and sliding back down to caress his hips. He does it again, up Dean’s sides and back down to his hips, and this time he makes a muffled sound against Dean’s throat before he moves back up to whisper into his ear. “I love the shape of you. Tiny hips, broad shoulders. It’s so unbearably sexy, Dean, I don’t even have words.”
it sends shivers up his spine anyway. Before Dean can even try to catch his breath, Cas pins him against the wall with the bowl of his hips while one hand slips down between them to palm over Dean’s cock. Just that has Dean moaning so fucking loud, right into Castiel’s ear, but other than Cas’s fingers tightening—the ones on his hip holding him in place and the ones now plunging down his boxers to pull his cock out—he makes no indication that he heard him.
Instead, he gives his hair one final little tug and says, “Get on the bed before that prep was for nothing.”
aware of them for comfort in a public place, so he ducks Cas’s gaze and takes a careful step back so his body doesn’t get the wrong idea about Cas’s proximity.
“Deal.” Dean already knows there’s a slim chance he’d ever be able to resist sharing Cas’s heat with him and not biting him in the first place, so he’s more than happy to go along with this if Cas is sure that’s what he wants. “But you’re really okay with this if it happens to be like, next week though? You’re ready?”
He wipes the lube off of his fingers in the sheets and buries them in Cas’s hair, holding him in place while they ravage each other’s mouths like two men starving. Cas lowers himself until his ass is hovering over Dean’s erection, and he moans when he feels Cas reach between them to grasp his cock in his hand. Overwhelmed with what’s obviously about to happen, his hands flit nervously down Cas’s body until they settle on his hips when Cas straightens up, and then he nods shakily to give the okay as Cas lines himself up until his cock is pressing against his hole.
“I won’t cheapen the experience by denying that,” Castiel says quietly. “I wouldn’t have wanted to kiss her if I didn’t feel anything at all. But I know now it wasn’t romantic. Not how I always hoped it would be with the person I would someday marry.” Dean softens slightly at the admission, and Castiel steps closer, placing one hand gently on his lower back. “I know I’ve upset you, and I’m so sorry, Dean. If I had known that there was a man like you waiting for me, wishing that was something we could experience together, I wouldn’t have done it then. But I had no idea. I never expected—” His breath catches on a deep inhale, and Dean’s heart clenches painfully in his chest at the idea of Castiel hurting. “I hoped.
“Thank you.” The kitchen really does feel small with the two of them standing in it, so he walks back through the doorway to the living room. “I didn’t really think I’d be here as long as I have when I moved in, so I guess it’s a good thing I like it.”
Dean fish mouths for a second, not sure if he should apologize and take the words back or try to comfort him, but before he can even force out some semblance of words, Cas is waving him away. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I’m fine.”
“I thought it was only fair that you should get to see it in person,” Castiel says. “It fits her well. Just enough room to get a couple of wears out of it, I think.”
“Doesn’t all the bad-for-you stuff in the dressing eliminate the point of the salad in the first place?”
know what he was doing and made it pretty damn clear he got off on it, I don’t even think I lasted that long,” Dean laughs. “I know how you’re feeling right now, and I promise you, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about if you come too fast.”
“I’d be lost without you,” Alex says, smiling down at him. “Before you take off, I just need your driver’s licence and phone number for Liam’s file,” she tells Dean.
It has its desired effect when Cas laughs. “Let’s wait and see how smooth you are on the dancefloor first.”
“No, I know. I just thought it was kind of weird since Castiel has been here five nights, and I think I’ve had two dreams about him now, including the squirrel one.”
He blinks back his tears, swallows down the lump in his throat, and lies through his teeth. “I’m gonna be okay, ma. Not like I know what I’m missing out on anyway.”
It’s been so long since he looked at someone and instantly felt an attraction that he’s quite literally struck stupid. He stops in his tracks, his lips parted and his heart racing as he drinks in the gorgeous combination of bright green eyes, full, almost feminine-looking lips, and a jaw so sharp it could cut glass. His brain only just comes back online in time to notice that the other man is staring at him in a similar fashion before Jess’s laugh breaks the spell.
had you. You always made sure I had what I needed, most of what I wanted, more food than any kid should ever need to eat in a day, and you were always,
“Well, like I said before, I don’t have a lot of friends left in the area. If it’s not a problem for you that half of my brain cells stop working every time I look at you, I would like to be friends.” He has to swallow again because his mouth is still unnaturally dry. “It can be lonely at times. Waiting to find my soulmate.”
He broke it. He broke what he and Dean had before it even started, and there’s nothing left to do now but cry out the pain, the regret, the fear, and the heartache. His tears seem to go on and on, not helping anything in the least, but not easing up at all either. He has no idea how long he sits there crying as close to silently as he can, with Dean still standing in the middle of the room looking down at the floor.
He’s pretty sure all he manages to get out is a simple, “Bye,” and the second the door closes, he looks over to meet Cas’s eyes. His own eyes are watering and his voice is hoarse when he says, “Cas—” Cas stares back at him, his face eerily blank. “I—I’m so fucking sorry, Cas.”
“Look at you making eyes at your husband on your wedding night,” Castiel says, but the teasing tone he’s sure Cas was aiming for falls a little short. Castiel’s big hands slide up Dean’s back until his arms are looped around his neck, Cas’s fingers start stroking the short hairs on the back of Dean’s neck, and Cas’s voice is much quieter when he speaks again. “If our night ends just like this, Dean, I hope you know I’ll still fall asleep feeling like the luckiest man in the realm.”
“Me neither,” Cas says. It’s been ten years, though, and Dean doesn’t know if he’s happy or sad to hear that. He never wanted Cas to be
Once they reach the double doors, they stop to wave to the people waiting outside, and the crowd absolutely explodes with cheering. Dean’s still waving to everybody he can see, completely blown away by the support the kingdom is showing him when Cas wraps an arm around him and tucks him up against his side. They slot together like puzzle pieces, and even with all of the people watching, he turns to Castiel and gives him a little peck on the lips.
He grabs a white, v-neck t-shirt, and his lips quirk at the tiny penguins that decorate the fabric like polka dots. He bought it thinking they were dots and hadn’t even noticed they were penguins until the lady at the checkout mentioned it.
“We’re never gonna let anybody take you. Never ever,” Dean promises. “Come here,” he urges him, and Liam scrambles into his lap and coils both arms and legs around him like some kind of snake or something. He rocks him back and forth as he shushes him, smiling sadly at Cas when he starts rubbing Liam’s back the same way he rubs his. “Donna’s just here to check that you’re doing okay.”
It’s a Thursday in the middle of October when he finally sees him again. Instead of taking his lunch from 12-1 like he usually does, he’s stuck with the 1-2 slot today since Meg has an appointment. He’s a creature of habit, so his stomach isn’t the only thing that’s grumbly about the time change. When he hears the jingle on the door he aims a fake smile in that direction, and he sees Castiel with the same basket in his arms as before.
There’s a hard edge to Dean’s words, like he’s angry about it, but the low rasp is sexy as hell and he’s still distracted by it when Dean reaches for his fly. Dean fumbles with the zipper, and once Castiel realizes what Dean’s trying to do, his fingers work on lowering his own, and then both pairs of jeans and boxers are discarded. He’s robbed of the opportunity for a look of his lover completely bare for the first time because Dean’s pressing what feels like a very large cock against his before he can peek, and
speed,” Dean corrects, and there’s a real smile. “And that’s what’s always gonna happen. It’s me, you, and Cas for good now. If Cas can’t be there, I will be, and if I can’t, Cas will be. You got us both on your team now, okay?”
“Not off the top of my noggin, but it’s true. Keeping established routines after big changes is helpful for the little ones,” Donna confirms.
He’s vaguely aware of Cas pushing himself up to his elbows, his burning gaze pinning Dean in place and adding to his already unfathomably intense orgasm as Cas watches him come undone.
As soon as they're alone, Dean tries again. “I’m an idiot,” Dean says quietly. “I was such a dick. I should’ve given you a second to explain before I thought—”
“Do you want to just let this sit with you for a little bit and then tell him when you’re feeling more settled?”
Dean rolls over and nuzzles into Castiel’s neck, which Castiel suspects is more to hide his embarrassment from a genuine compliment than because Dean wanted to be closer to him. “So you’re sayin’ it wasn’t just my pretty face?”
He’s openly staring at the lips that inspired that train of thought, watching eagerly for another smile that makes Dean’s tongue peek out behind his teeth, when the abrupt silence in the room strikes him. His eyes flick up just in time for him to see Dean’s eyes move from
He feels teeth catch on his skin and he thrusts wildly, riding the tiny bolt of pain that brings him much closer to his release.
He’s got a couple of parts to track down in the back room to kill time until then, though. He’s sure they don’t have one of them, but the inventory says they do, so he’s gotta check every damn nook and cranny before he can tell his boss it isn’t there. His knees crack when he squats down to scan the numbers on the boxes on the bottom shelf, and he’s reading them outloud to himself when it happens.
Dean tries to hide a smirk, but he’s clearly pleased with himself. “Yeah, but what kind of fun would that be for me?” Dean teases. “Besides, you’re cute when you blush.”
the twisting of his torso, his back arching and his chest puffing out, and Cas is so fucking sexy like this that Dean can’t resist pushing his luck. He looks up at Cas through his eyelashes as he inches his mouth up to the soft strip of skin between his pubic hair and his belly button. He starts a trail of open-mouth kisses from hip to hip, and when Cas is only breathing hard and squirming instead of asking him to stop, he goes up another inch.
As usual, Dean being a good dad to Grace makes warmth bloom in his chest, and he feels so incredibly fond of Dean when he comes back into the room he can hardly wait for Dean to take the few remaining steps to get into the nest with him.
He moans with pleasure as the sweet flavor bursts on his tongue, and then he dives in and flattens his tongue against Dean’s hole. He swirls it around, pressing and stretching until he can spear his tongue inside of him. Dean calls out, so he does it again and again, forcing his tongue as deep inside of his omega as he can go. His chin slides in the slick, and he moans as the aroma and savoriness floods his senses. All he can think is
“Fuck, yes,” Dean gasps, already pressing his ass back towards him asking for more. Castiel grips his firm asscheek in his hand and squeezes, loving the give of his soft flesh beneath his palm. “Mark me up, Cas.”
His regalia is a long-sleeve garment made out of the softest navy blue velvet he’s ever felt, with lavish white silk cuffs that go almost up to his elbows and a matching sash for a belt that clips behind his back. His cape has the same white silk inner lining, and the outside is the navy blue velvet with silver, scalloped edges. There’s a white silk cape top fastened around his neck almost like a scarf that droops down to his chest, and it, too, has silver edges that match the cape. There’s also white, shiny jewels sewed to the scarf, cuffs, and sash, and some navy blue ones on his cuffs and the lapels that hang down from the sash. Some of the most intricate bead work he has ever seen fills the space between the jewels on his cuffs, sash, and the fabric hanging down over his waist. The only things that are plain are the ivory leather boots that almost reach his knees, and the white tights he has beneath them that remind him a lot of what Cas was wearing two nights ago.
He steps back as if he's been burned and Dean barely manages to get his feet under him in time to remain standing.
It’s nice before they even get to wherever Dean is driving them, because Dean takes Castiel’s hand again and they drive through some backroads and up into a steady incline with their hands folded on the bench seat between them.
you a meal instead?” Castiel asks, his heart in his throat. Asking out the man that will be his boss if he gets the job he’s technically still interviewing for is arguably the stupidest thing he’s ever done, but when Dean flashes a sexy grin in his direction, he already knows it was well worth it.
Cas pushes Dean towards the door so they can step out onto the ice. They take a couple of slow, easy strides to get them started, and once they have their feet under them, Cas reassures Dean that they’ll be fine.
God, what a terrible, terrible couple of days it was when he thought he lost Dean forever. Thankfully, after talking so thoroughly with Dean once they finally reconnected, he feels much better. He knows things aren’t going to be perfect, and honestly, he’s a little nervous that it might be awkward between them tonight. But he’s ready to work through that, because despite the fact that Dean said some pretty awful things to him, he still wants to be with him. Thanks to the two weeks they spent getting to know each other before Dean found out the truth, he knows that Dean’s a better person than he was that one morning a week ago. He knows that Dean’s the kind of man who made sure he got home safe the first time they met even when Dean was so drunk he could hardly stand up straight, and that Dean wouldn’t accept Castiel’s first kiss when he was high because Dean wasn’t sure it’s really what Castiel wanted. He knows Dean is the kind of man who takes his own air conditioner out to install at Castiel’s house just so he could sleep more comfortably, then offers to take it out all over again just so Castiel didn’t feel pressured into sleeping in the same bed as Dean before he was ready.
It’s dead silent on the other end of the phone. It stretches on for so long that he pulls his phone away from his face to look at it to make sure he didn’t hang up or something, and when he sees the timer still counting, he checks on his brother. “Sam?”
His mouth moves to the slit of Castiel’s open shirt like a moth to a flame, and he nudges Castiel’s shirt collar aside with his nose as he travels the defined jut of his collarbone from his shoulder down until his lips become flush with the hollow of his throat. He feels the faint give to his flesh and drags his tongue along it, relishing in the hitch of Castiel’s breath and the taste of his skin. Encouraged both by Castiel’s reaction and his own enjoyment of tasting Castiel’s body one inch at a time, he continues down his chest. He switches it up between trailing his tongue along his skin and leaving wet, open-mouthed kisses as he goes. He stops to explore the subtle rise to his pecs and becomes instantly aware of his cock growing heavier as he traces the proof of Castiel’s firm, muscled body with his tongue.
“So you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop?” Sam asks, cracking another smile when Dean looks down at the shoes Sam is currently stepping into.
Dean nods, already blushing with anticipation over what he should probably say. “Yeah. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re gonna be sticking out like a sore thumb if you wear that to The Roadhouse.”
It may have been accidentally at first, when it comes to both his initial mating bite and Hunter’s conception, but it’s completely and unquestionably intentional now. And considering how the whole clusterfuck at Patience wound up bringing the only person he’s ever loved into his life and
Cas doesn't seem comforted by that at all. “But Sam kept looking at me like he was waiting for me to pull a gun or something. I've never seen him look at me like that before."
“I really just wanted an excuse to do this,” Cas says, taking his hand and sliding their fingers together.
Dean doesn’t want to think about where they would be right now if he didn’t. “Maybe one of those surges of grace you told me about that can be brought on by, uh, strong emotions?”
on the side of the bowl. He can tell by the way Liam pulls his hand back way too far that this is going to end badly, but even though they both start to say his name to stop him, Liam is already in motion and ends up smashing the egg into the side of a bowl like a football in the end zone.
Dean releases a sharp breath and his forehead braces against Cas’s in an act of intimacy and trust that makes his heart sing. Dean breathes, “N-not gonna last, sweetheart.”
Castiel throws his head back and moans, rutting forward into Dean’s big hand, riding the tunnel of his fist with his teeth clenched. It’s so unbelievably good that he’s lost all coherent thought, all concept of decency and modesty, and he just thrusts wildly, mindlessly chasing his orgasm.
okay, but they won’t know for sure until right now. Thankfully, the doctor is very thorough, so Dean doesn’t feel like he needs to interfere (though Cas is holding his hand like he’s expecting it any second). The only time Liam complains is when she touches the goose egg on his head, and the doctor pulls her hands away with an apologetic smile.
His knees damn near give out on him he comes so hard, and if it wasn’t for Cas’s hands pressed firmly against his hips, he’s not entirely sure he wouldn’t have fallen over completely. Cas sucks down every drop like they have all the time in the world, pulls himself to his feet, and tucks Dean’s softening cock back into his boxers. He does up the button and pulls up the fly all while maintaining eye contact, then leans in to kiss him, but stops right before their lips connect.
That’s not what he meant at all, but he nods anyway, then pulls his phone out of his pocket to check the time. They were supposed to meet here at 3:00 and it’s 3:05 and Sam and Jess are nowhere to be found. His brother is
Dean laughs a little, but slaps a hand onto his shoulder as they start walking. “Yeah, man. I mean, there wasn’t exactly a lot to it, but you didn’t slobber all over me or anything.”
Every sound of pleasure he wrings out of Cas causes heat to course through him, and he moans one of his own as he cleans up the mess of precum that’s dribbled down Cas’s shaft. Dean’s cock throbs where it’s pressed into the bed sheets beneath him as his tongue works Cas’s shaft until there’s nothing but the newest beads of pre-release beading at the tip. Dean licks that up too, and with his job now accomplished, he meets Cas’s eyes as he wraps his lips around Cas’s cock for the first time.
The first two fingers sliding in with only the help of the saliva Dean’s left behind is filthy and so unbelievably good he genuinely forgets how to breathe while they inch their way into him.
“I’m okay,” Dean promises. “I get it, you know? I was there. I know what I did to you and what it did to us.”
Dean hits him with a patented Dean Winchester smile, the one that will make his heart skip a beat every time he sees it for as long as he lives. “Not as perfect as you, sweetheart.”
“Cas.” Dean’s voice comes out low and muffled against his skin, but he hears him start to chant his name like a prayer between wet, open-mouthed kisses to his neck. “Cas, Cas,
“Wh—” And then it hits him. And it might be hotter than the way Cas is steadily sucking a mark into the bend of his neck.
By the time he does, the man is breathing like he ran a marathon, red-faced and sweating. Dean notes that the man still forces his spine to straighten out as he stumbles with as much grace as he can muster towards the table where he takes the empty seat with a grimace full of pain. The first words out of his mouth are, “Thank you for your kindness.”
with how hot it is when he uses Cas’s precum to slick up the both of them, his breath catching when he feels the contrasting sensations of their rock hard cocks covered by velvety soft skin glide trough the circle of his fist.
“Looks to me you’re the one wearin’ a dress, Your Highness,” Bobby says back, surprising a laugh out of him. “By the way,” Bobby says, his voice decidedly quieter. “That contract you signed with your dad? Iron-clad regardless of gender, since he used the Enochian symbol instead of the actual word.”
Dean basically sprints down the hallway after that, and the sight has Castiel’s voice filled with laughter when he calls out, “I had a great time, too. See you tomorrow!”
He sees it without meaning to, finds it even when he isn’t looking, but it’s there. Logically, he knows it’s there. Emotionally, he doesn’t understand it, but
“It could be fake, Your Majesty,” Castiel says. “Computer animation is good enough now that it’s almost impossible to tell what’s real and what isn’t. Gabriel said he doesn’t know a single soldier who has actually been in battle, and he’s a high-ranking soldier. He would know.”
“More,” Cas confirms. “More of everything with you,” Cas declares, catching his lips in a surprisingly heated kiss.
Please don’t give constructive criticism... or any kind of criticism, really. I’ve been having a really hard time lately (like most of the world) and all I want to do is be able to write fluffy, sexy fic where we can all exist in a happy place.
He sucks Cas’s bottom lip between his own and then scrapes his teeth over it as it pulls free. “Must’ve been one hell of a first kiss,” Dean pants.
It was just a shock to wake up alone, is all. Hell, for a minute there Dean was even optimistic enough to think that Cas might have been in the kitchen making coffee or starting breakfast, but nothing was even out of place.
“And you,” Cas returns, “are the very personification of perfection, outside and in.” He circles his hips when he says
Dean grabs the utensil caddy to start putting those away to help. “The wall stickers look awesome, by the way.”
Cas doesn’t say anything for a long while, but Dean lets him have time to think it through. Finally, he says, “Alright. But I do have one request, if you’ll humor me.”
“If you say so,” Dean replies. He grabs Liam’s plate and pushes away from the table to get another piece of pizza, which he cuts up before he brings it back. “Anybody else want more while I’m up?” It turns out only he and Liam do, so the two of them settle in to eat, and Donna and Cas wind up in a conversation about what vegetables they like on their pizza, while he and Liam exchange grossed out faces.
“I wanted to be with you, too. I still do.” Just knowing Dean cares about him enough to try talking again fills him with enough hope to make his silent sobs come to a stop. “Even if you walk out of here like you said you might, I always will. I won’t want anybody else.”
Feeling immediately defensive on Grace’s behalf, Castiel says, “It’s not her fault. Babies don’t cry for no reason. She obviously wants something, I just can’t figure out what it is.” He can feel his throat getting thick with emotion or embarrassment again, but powers through to say, “I guess I’m not as good at the whole dad thing as I hoped I would be.”
“The thing is, I—I usually only play for Sam and Jess, and Jo sometimes if she’s there, but they’re all basically family, you know? And it’s not that I don’t believe them I guess, but it’s kinda like your mom telling you you’re handsome or whatever,” Dean says, smiling weakly.
Cas is the only person other than Sam that’s ever been able to tell when Dean’s lying, and apparently that hasn’t changed, which means all he can do to answer Cas’s question is shrug his shoulders in an exaggerated movement he hopes Cas can see from the ground in the dark.
Dean feels so many conflicting emotions all at once he doesn’t even know how to begin to respond. He’s pissed at Sam for saying that even though it's logical, it hurts to hear Cas talking about moving on even though they haven’t been together for ten years, and at the same time, he’s glad Cas had somebody looking out for him since Dean wasn’t doing it anymore.
“At least now I can text or call you to tell you to shut up,” Cas says, and now it’s Dean’s turn to laugh.
“No,” Dean says. His voice is barely above a whisper because his throat is as dry as a desert, but it turns both of his parents’ heads towards him anyway. “Don’t—don’t do that to Sam. I’ll do it. I’ll marry the Princess of the Land of the Angels, but I want my own contract first.”
Jess’s voice is like a slap to the face, but his brain still doesn’t get the message to get his hands off of Cas’s perfectly round ass in time to save any of them the embarrassment of getting caught. “Oh!” she says, looking startled to see them wrapped together so closely. She badly stifles a laugh and looks pointedly at the ceiling. “I heard a bang, but I’m guessing that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.”
Dean’s sure his brain would have come up with a response to that other than the complete absence of any and all thought eventually, but then Cas’s hand slides up between his shirt and his skin, tracing the bare curve of his lower back for several teasing seconds and Dean forgets all about it. He arches forward, already desperate for a firmer touch, when Cas’s hands move to his hips and guide him back as Cas hops off of the table.
Dean slept like the fucking dead, and he knows that because when he opens his eyes and sees the diffused light glowing behind the blinds in the cabin window, he feels wide awake in a way he rarely does when he first wakes up.
This is exactly what he needed. His brother and his closest friend, both on his side, making him laugh and feel like he hasn’t changed one bit even though a part of him is uncomfortably aware that his whole life is about to be turned upside down. Knowing that he still has to tell his mom and dad niggles at the back of his mind, but because there’s no part of him who thinks that’s going to go as well as this has, he chooses to stay where he is and lets Sam and Charlie tease him mercilessly about Cain and how oblivious he’s been this whole time.
for that,” he deadpans. Cas laughs, looking adorably pleased with himself, and he decides to keep talking while Cas works on finding a rhythm. “You fit in my lap like a dream, and watching you getting so turned on just from touching my shoulders and chest had me hard enough to hammer nails.”
Cas’s eyes go all soft and Dean feels himself pulled into them the way he always is. He’s pretty sure he could stare into them for days and still not get used to how fuckin’ blue they are. Hell, it’s been ten years and he hasn’t been able to stop staring at them yet. “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas was at the sink, but he pops his head around the corner with a dish towel thrown over his shoulder. “Donna said she’s coming back at 4:30 right?”
“God, no,” Dean says immediately, all traces of annoyance gone in an instant. “Just the way you look at me sometimes is more romance than most people get in a lifetime.”
Dean smiles again, and Cas can see the way his shoulders relax. Maybe they can do this, enjoy themselves even while feeling like two fish out of water.
They were basically already living together anyway, but it’s been almost a month since their talk when they officially decided to take the next step, and now
Sam nods and pats his jacket pocket, and like they were waiting for it, the music that was playing while he and Sam walked in stops. Almost at once, the murmuring sound of the people in the chapel comes to a halt as a hush falls over the crowd. He feels like his heart is going to beat out of his chest when the whimsical sound of what
Cas lowers his voice to whisper conspiratorially. “If it helps, I heard through the grapevine that The Queen managed to sneak in pie to go with the traditional wedding cake.”
Dean presses his lips together to keep from laughing, and Castiel rolls his eyes so dramatically, he finds himself smiling before he can stop it. The dynamic between Castiel being so serious and Gabriel cracking jokes like they’re going out of style is absolutely hilarious, and as much as he wants to get to know Castiel better on his own, he hopes he gets to see a lot of these two together, too.
“What’s with the new locks on the front and back doors?” he wonders. “I installed those locks myself. They’re good. Solid.”
“Not only did this guy right here, Dean Winchester, do a killer cover of 'Lover,' his original song 'One Good Reason' has
He and Cas bitch and joke about the indignity of it all on the way home, and he’s all loose and smiley after laughing it off with Cas. For the first time he can remember, he’s almost reluctant to go into work—and not because he’s too sore or thinks he might puke if he looks at the same color paint for one more day—but because he thinks he might have more fun hanging out with Cas than working. And isn’t that a revelation?
He didn’t think it was possible to love Cas more than he did before, but with every beat of his heart sending
knowing exactly what it’s like to kiss his best friend and the man he’s in love with. His hands slide into his wild hair, drawing another moan out of Cas that has his dick standing at rapt attention. He tucks up against him, straddling Castiel’s thick thigh and letting him feel how hard he is while he plunges his tongue into Castiel’s mouth. He groans in surprise when Castiel takes control of the kiss and the situation.
“Funnily enough, I recently had a similar conversation with my mom, and she kind of implied I must have learned it from the stables.”
Castiel has a wide smile on his face when he gets confirmation Dean remembers too, but his eyes start to fill as he realizes how far they’ve come. From Dean trying to kiss him so many times the first night they met, to the two of them failing miserably at being friends when he was keeping their soulmate status from Dean for so long. From Dean breaking his heart to the two of them working so very, very hard to fix things, building trust and understanding and a bond so strong that he knows
for it by now, but hearing Dean say it all rough and low like he’s barely holding back sends a dirty thrill through him anyway. “Wanna knot you and mark you from the inside, fill you so full of my seed that it drips like your slick down your thighs.” Castiel whimpers, so hot he wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if he burst into flames right here and now. “Jesus Christ you smell
Cas is clearly not offended, because he leans in and plants a firm kiss to his lips before handing him a glass of wine. Dean exchanges the flowers for the wine, and watches with a soft smile when Cas buries his face in the bouquet and breathes in deep.
Dean shakes his head and continues, “Sam obviously doesn’t care, and it turns out I don’t really care what anybody else thinks.” Cas is so proud of him, he could burst. “I figured if you were ready...”
“I figure he probably packs up and leaves without so much as a goodbye, huh?” Ellen says, sounding amused. He rolls his eyes, but truthfully, her sarcastic reply helped remind him that Cas doesn’t care if he’s fancy or not. If he screws it up, they’ll laugh together and move past it. Cas likes him the way he is.
“Good,” Cas says softly, allowing Dean to start breathing again. Cas scoots in a little closer, skirting his palm down Dean’s arm. “I wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to freak you out when I tell you I’d be more than happy to spend the next several years fucking you.” Cas drops a chaste kiss just beneath his ear, like saying that didn’t make Dean flush right to the tip of them. “I’ll fuck you over the arm of the couch and with your face pressed against the shower tile.” He can feel Cas’s breath hot on the shell of his ear, making it impossible to tell if it’s that or his words that cause goosebumps to pop up all along his skin. “When we’re waiting for the laundry to finish or in the kitchen after you burn dinner.” Dean might be insulted by Cas assuming he’d burn dinner when he’s a hell of a cook, but Cas scrapes his teeth over Dean’s earlobe and any will to hold a grudge disappears. “Frankly, I’ll fuck you
He doesn’t get a chance to keep their playful banter going, because just then, their waitress comes over to take their drink order. She tells him he made a good choice with the margaritas, and he smiles smugly at Dean when she walks away.
Castiel’s eyes flick away shyly after the compliment but Dean waits him out, and once Cas lifts his gaze again, their eyes lock and
“I’m no expert on sex or sexual acts,” Castiel says quickly. “But I’m happy to try to answer any questions you might have.”
“That was just a mistake,” Dean tells him. “They didn’t know who Cas was, but they do now. Remember I put his name on those forms so they know? And I asked Jack a whole bunch of times to make sure that daycare knows you can go with me and Cas. Remember how I signed my name on it and made it all official and stuff?” Liam nods, but he can still see fear in his too-blue eyes. “And do you remember what happened when they wouldn’t let you go home with Cas?” he asks. “Who’d they call?”
They must go over a bump or something because the whole ambulance shakes and Liam whimpers. “Daddy?”
Unfortunately for Dean, Hannah only has eyes for Cas. She’s made her interest in him abundantly clear over the years, despite the fact that she knows he’s gay. It’s both baffling to him and a rather uncomfortable position to be in.
“Touché,” he said. They talk frequently, but he’s more of a texter and she knows that. “Nothing’s wrong, I’m just, uh, checking in to make sure Thanksgiving is still a go?”
Because Dean seems so adorably shy to admit it, Castiel can’t help but smile. “It doesn’t look bad. I’m glad you thought ahead.”
“We can do that,” Cas replies, closing the fridge and grabbing the bunch from where they’re hanging on a fruit bowl that Dean’s never even seen before. Cas pulls one off of the bunch and asks, “Do you need me to open it for you?”
Over the next two weeks, he notices that the candy dish gets refilled at least once a week, but despite the fact that he’s in the office seven hours a day, he never actually sees Castiel again. He wonders if Castiel is avoiding him after he gave him an adorkable thumbs up and fell out the door, but two weeks is a long time to avoid a person when they both know they’re bound to run into each other again eventually.
His brain and body are suffering from extreme whiplash, and apparently that means he can’t come up with a decent course of action for what the hell he’s supposed to do next. Cas doesn’t seem to have the same problem, because the next thing Dean knows, Cas is moving Dean’s shirt out of the way and reaching for the button on Dean’s fly.
spending time with Dean without being able to hold his hand after this would be difficult, that today would shift something between them, and yet after a couple of handjobs that had been much more of an excuse to experience Dean’s lips against his again than a genuine need for release, he had gathered Dean up in his arms again the second night and held him all night long.
Castiel mulls that around for a minute, but he finds he doesn’t really mind if the whole town knows he’s going out with Dean. Dean’s a good man, and he’s lucky to be associated with him. “That doesn’t bother me. Does it bother you?”
“No. I want this. I want you,” he says plainly, his voice dropping an octave without his permission. “I’m just a little nervous.”
Dean shrugs again, though Castiel notices he doesn’t seem to be able to keep eye contact when he responds. “I’m a simple guy. Gimme some pie, my brother, and a guitar, and that’s enough for me.”
They somehow blend in perfectly with the rest of the picture, thanks to Cas’s unbelievable talent, and Dean quite literally
Cas shrugs. “I don’t know. It’s a lot of information. I knew it wasn’t going to be as easy as a man and a woman, but I don’t know if I really thought through the details.”
Dean wants to be fucked. Based on the way his cock is currently leaking onto his washboard stomach and he’s squirming under Cas’s curious gaze, Cas guesses he wants it pretty bad. He’s sure it’s nothing compared to his own almost stifling arousal, but then again, only one of them hasn’t had sex in more than a year.
He loves that first half-aborted thrust when Cas starts to lose control and reins it in a second too late, trying to be gentlemen.
behind schedule finishing his current project, and every day it sits unfinished costs Winchester Brothers Contracting money.
and Dean’s moaning incoherent nonsense mixed with Castiel’s name as he’s thrown head-first over the edge and into a mind-numbing orgasm that seems to stretch on for eons. Castiel collapses in a heap on top of him while Dean’s still coming hot and thick between them, and every time he so much as twitches, Dean’s hyper-aware of the cum smearing all over him. While part of his brain tries to make an argument for it being gross, in all honesty, it makes him feel wanted and desired and
Cas holds out his hand like he expects Dean to give them back without a fight, but Dean shakes his head. “No way, Jose. You gave ‘em to me.”
Sam was always too smart for his own good. “Yeah, alright.” He keeps his head down to stop any other memories from hitting him as they head into the living room of their childhood home and Dean takes in the few changes Sam’s made since he moved in and John moved to six-feet-under. Newer wallpaper, freshly painted ceiling, the wall knocked out between the kitchen and the living room really opening up the space. “Place looks good,” he comments.
But then, ever so gently that Dean might not have been able to feel it at all if it wasn't for the constantly raw nerve-endings, Cas kisses the corner of his right eye. Where he’s scarred. Dean isn’t even breathing, poised for rejection and for more pain than he’s ever felt before, because he knows with every fiber of his being that Cas is about to get up and walk away. This has to be goodbye for real, for good, because
kinda way. Castiel narrows his eyes and shakes his head, which he takes to mean Cas has no idea. “I wanted more. So every now and then, I dip my fingers into a few pies, feel ‘em out to see what takes and what doesn’t. In this realm,” he says, lifting his eyes to the ceiling in a sweeping gesture. “I got caught up in the whole stealing land thing.”
He waits until they’re out for a walk so that there are no distractions other than the sun shining and Grace babbling away as she looks around at whatever she can see from her stroller, and then he brings it up casually. Like it’s no big deal. Like he hasn’t lost sleep and countless hours wondering exactly how to word this because it absolutely won’t break his heart if Cas says he isn’t interested.
Like the mere thought of his date tonight has conjured him to his front door, Castiel hears a knock that
careful when it comes to prep, but they’ve done this enough times that his body knows what to do. The lube warms quickly, and pretty soon, he has two fingers working him open and his hips rocking back into each press of them deep inside. His back aches and his knees protest, but it feels
“I was clearly too drunk to stop you from walking home alone last night at 2AM, but you’re stuck with the sober, pushy Dean tonight.”
there’s something Dean hasn’t told him yet. He should have expected it. There’s no way a man as smart, funny, and good-looking as Dean is going to come without baggage. Despite what Dean said, there had to be a reason he wasn’t already married. Unless...?
He barely even pays her any attention, though, because his eyes are already glued to the little kid by her side, and all he can do is nod and step back. Thankfully, Cas is right there, and before he can even reach for him, he feels Cas’s hand find his. Their fingers slot together like they’ve done it a million times, and even though the grip is harder than is strictly comfortable, he knows he’s holding on just as tight.
Cas positions himself between his legs, lifting his balls out of the way and giving them a gentle rub with his palm before he lines himself up. “Maybe next time we save that for the actual sex.”
“So perfect, my love. You’re so good for me.” Dean hears the needy sound trying to escape his throat, but he can’t stop it with Cas rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. He can barely take a breath before Cas pulls out to bury himself to the hilt and grinds all over again with a shaky breath of his own. “Fuck, I’m so close. I need you to come, Dean.”
Now all that’s left is the jacket, and once again, he’s blown away by the intricate fabric he has the chance to wear for the first time. The inside feels like cotton, but the outside has an expensive-looking lace overlay that’s absolutely gorgeous. This must be one of the new outfits he was fitted for the day before Castiel arrived. He just never bothered with them once he got to know Cas and realized it didn’t matter what he wore.
“It doesn’t sound stupid. I’m sorry I never thought of it,” Cas says. But why would he? Dean’s the high-maintenance freak, here, not Cas. “If you promise not to use that as an excuse not to have David in the bed, then I promise we’ll work something out with limiting David’s access to the bedroom.”
“You’re good boys,” Missouri tells them again. “You know damn well you’ve got something special between you most people only ever dream of, and that deserves to be celebrated, not ridiculed.”
“I wouldn’t count on it.” Then, with Liam fresh in his mind, he says, “We should get cleaned up so I can go check on him.”
what they were busy doing last night, and he shifts awkwardly foot to foot as he tries to tell himself that not only is it impossible for her to know that, but they’re married and there’s nothing wrong with what they did even if she does.
She may be a pain in the ass at times, but she’s the only person he met in L.A. that he counts as a friend, and he knows he’s going to miss having her around more than anything else he’s spent his money on in the last ten years. He reads the note a second time, shaking his head at Charlie calling getting booted out of the industry at 32 years old
As catchy as the tune is, it’s the lyrics that really make this one. Apparently, his soulmate has an excellent sense of humor. Each verse goes through different places his soulmate might meet him, and each chorus lists all the things his soulmate doesn’t know about him, but it still somehow manages to logically circle back to how he knows he already loves him more than pie. The lyrics to this song change often, but the chorus stays the same. Knowing that this song is written about him—even if his soulmate doesn’t know who he is yet—makes him warm inside despite the way his soulmate is still singing it on repeat by the time he arrives at The Roadhouse.
Whatever hormone feedback loop they were stuck in evaporates in a moment, and Dean jumps back, wrenching his hands away from Castiel like they’ve been burned. “I—
When he steps back to get a better look at Cas from a distance, the full power of Cas’s blue eyes highlighted by the baby blue tie damn near stops his heart. He’s always been a sucker for Cas’s eyes, but he thought after all the time away they would lose some of the effect they hold over him. Turns out he was wrong about that, too, because he’s pretty damn sure they’ve never been more beautiful.
“I have years of practice,” Dean tells him. “You’ll get it. How are things going, by the way? I was kinda bummed that I haven’t heard from you.”
They go back to LSA Burger for dinner with Sam, Jess, and Jo to celebrate Cas’s 30th birthday. They’ve been here plenty of times in the four months since they’ve met, and it’s kinda their thing to get up and dance anytime they happen to be there when there’s live music playing. They’re well-known here, both because of how frequently they pop by and because of their ‘local celebrity’ status, so they always get great seats close to the stage. They’ve all finished their food and are working on their drinks waiting for the music to start when Dean excuses himself to use the bathroom.
Dean closes the door behind them and sinks back against it, his eyes closed as he feels some of the nerves that had been knotted in his stomach loosen now that they’re alone again.
He waits until she turns the sander off so he doesn’t startle her while she has a power tool in her hand, and says, “Didja hire elves to help you or something?”
He knows just from the unfairly sexy smirk on Cas’s face what his answer should be, and he drops his head onto the steering wheel with an exaggerated groan that has the sound of Cas’s laughter echoing in the car long after Cas closes the door and walks inside.
damn close—when suddenly Cas locks up. Dean braces himself as Cas comes with one final, grinding thrust and a low growl of Dean’s name that has heat ripping through him, and just like that, he’s pulled over the edge with Cas into oblivion.
“Yes, Sir. On it, Sir. Your Highnesses,” he says to Sam, Dean, and Castiel. “You three stick together with Gabriel. I figure between him and Prince Castiel, you’re as safe as you’re gettin’.”
“Worth it,” Dean mutters. Then he lets out a huge sigh as he rolls onto his back, immediately pulling at Castiel to join him. Castiel goes willingly, tucking himself into Dean’s side and resting his head on his shoulder. “Though I swear I didn’t plan to get you naked before we even ate.”
“So I set up a sheet in the living room and a bunch of extra lights and I have the entire Harry Potter movie series set up to watch so you won’t get bored. I also have finger foods you can eat and, again, sexual favors at the end if you behave yourself.”
“I’ve been okay,” Castiel answers. “I’m very lucky. This pregnancy has been everything I’ve always wanted.”
Castiel gives a wave, waits for Dean to back out behind him, and then leaves his driveway in his own car without a baby in the back seat for the first time since Grace was born.
Dean just waves him away and makes his way to the coffee machine where Cas already has his K-Cup loaded and a mug underneath. He would smile if he wasn’t such a miserable excuse for a human being before caffeine. He does search out Cas, who he apparently walked right past without noticing thanks to his tunnel vision for coffee, and makes fleeting eye contact while the machine gurgles behind him. Cas’s little smile makes his stomach flip, and because it is
“Hi,” Castiel says back, experiencing a giddy sense of excitement now that Dean’s really here. Dean has his guitar and a duffel bag thrown over his shoulder. “Want me to take something?”
apparently, because that’s exactly what Cas starts doing. His gaze is unwavering as he pulls his finger out just a little bit, then wiggles his way back in, over and over a little bit more each time until there’s almost no resistance. It feels
Liam’s eyes go wide but he keeps his hands up carefully as he walks. He can just hear Cas whisper, “Told ya. Heart attack,” before the bathroom door closes on Liam’s high-pitched laughter.
He takes in the sight of Cas’s broad shoulders and long torso, his big hands, and his tanned skin against the crisp white of the shirt collar. His mouth goes dry as his eyes land on Cas’s face, and his heart thuds in his chest when he finds Cas looking back, watching Dean blatantly checking him out.
Castiel shakes his head. “I’ve got it. It’s the least I can do after you’ve been working so hard this morning.”
Cas scans the papers in front of him for a few seconds, then looks up sharply. “Charlie sent you a contract? Did you ask her to?”
“Me neither,” Dean answers with a cheeky grin. “I kept thinking about how hard it was going to be to get yourself and Grace ready at the same time so I thought I’d let myself in to give you a hand. Should’ve known you’d have it all under control, though. You uh, look great by the way,” Dean says, adding a quick whistle that makes Castiel roll his eyes with a smile. “Giving me flashbacks to years of trying to check you out at work without getting busted.”
