John stared, feeling himself blushing, and his stomach doing weird clenching things that made him feel half sick and half excited. “You - you mean that? You don’t want to... ring my parents and ask for permission first?” he teased.
And John realised. ‘Oh, no. Sherlock?’
Christmas break came and went. Sherlock grew two inches in height, and as well as new trousers, John bought him a medical-grade laboratory set to use in his room. Sherlock was very happy with the present, taking it upstairs and setting it up for most of Boxing Day. He seemed happy to be away from school for the holidays, and John was more than happy to have him. The bullying had continued steadily, with the name-calling turning into pushing and shoving, and John knew it was a matter of time before a real fight broke out and Sherlock was sent home with a broken nose, or worse. Sherlock still wouldn’t let John complain to the school, instead studying hard in some form of rebellion and getting the highest grades the school had ever seen. John was undeniably proud of him, and kissed him on the top of the head when he saw the report card.
Sherlock smiled. "John, this is Mrs Hudson. She's the daughter of my previous landlady."
Sherlock laughed, the sound exploding out of him. “I – I didn’t think you did.”
“Well, I am,” Sherlock brushed a pile of snow onto the ground. “The world does not need Sherlock Holmes. It never has.”
In John’s mind, the title of
“Fuck…” John reached for Sherlock’s hips, hesitating at the last moment, until Sherlock rolled his eyes, and pushed John’s hands closer.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock breathed. “What –”
“Mm…” Sherlock looked pointedly at the door.
John posed for the photographs, his mind buzzing with babies and omegas and alphas and betas and weddings, until it was time to go home.
John swore under his breath as he clambered up as much as he could onto Sherlock’s lap, the alpha helping him get seated on his knee with the invasive bump between them. The baby squirmed as John’s heartrate picked up, and John did his best to ignore it as he ended up pushing it against Sherlock’s front to get close enough to snog him properly. There was a definite bulge in his trousers, and a matching one in Sherlock’s as they giggled and kissed and touched at one another, but didn’t repeat the
Mycroft sighed. “Don’t –”
John had to scratch his arms, the urge to stand up and hug Sherlock was almost overwhelming. His bond bite was throbbing, and his stomach was rolling like the inside of a washing machine.
Siger had said he was.
Sherlock hummed again, stroking John’s bump with small, ever-decreasing, circles. “I’d get in trouble.”
“Is he cute?”
The feel of Cam’s tongue in his mouth suddenly rocketed back into Sherlock’s mind, and he shuddered, half in revulsion, and half in a feeling he couldn’t quite place. The revulsion was at his own behaviour, it had to be. As for the other feeling, that was probably lust, though it felt different to how it felt when Sherlock wanted to put his hands on John.
“You’ll what? Beat me up?” Sherlock rolled his eyes, his pale fingers typing fast on the keys as he hacked past protective software and the system mainframe. "Recover... Files. Today’s date, and counting back… Easy." Sherlock's eyes scanned the screen. "He'd been drinking. The dead man. His alcohol toxicity was missing from the report. By these numbers, he certainly would have been relaxed."
“Oh… my god.”
Sherlock tutted. “Well, obviously not
“Well, I think I have a clear list of issues to work through, and if more come to us, we will work on those, too,” Melody said. “Now… let’s get you back to your family.”
Then came a lecture from their usual teacher about how to cope should they receive a vampire as a patient.
He shook his head. “Not yet. Maybe…” he laced his fingers together. “I’m seeing this woman. This therapist. I think, maybe in a while, I can talk about it. But not yet.”
“They won’t listen,” John said. “They think I’m going to do something horrible to him. I just want things back like they were, when we could go out and play, and stuff.”
John cleared his throat. “I haven’t…” he stopped, fingers holding the pages open. “Sherlock.” He shook his head. “I don’t know.”
“Jeans,” he looked down at himself.
“I’ll call the hospital,” Mycroft said, obviously awake, too.
“Fine,” the teacher shook his head. “Mr Holmes, give us the answer.”
Greg’s face fell. “Shit, that was a joke. You haven’t, have you?”
“A policeman.”
John smiled. “I’m going to make you feel so good, my alpha. I’m going to make you come, and then I’m going to come inside you,” he touched a finger to the tight, tight muscle. Sherlock twitched, biting his lip. “I’m going to bury my cock in you,” John went on, starting to rub gently at the locked entrance. “Make you
“I know,” John nodded, his smile finally falling away. He looked over Sherlock’s face as if it was a mirage. “I shouldn’t have shown you that future. But I had to show you why I came. Because I care for you. Was meant to care for you. In every sort of story, in every universe, in every version of you bar the one you lived, it’s us. Sherlock and John. Holmes and Watson. It was meant to be. That’s why I’m here.” He reached up, and stroked Sherlock’s hair, on the shorter side of his parting, tucking an errant curl down. “That why you’ll remember this.”
“I…” Sherlock put his hands on John’s back, gripping hard at his jumper. “God-!”
John put a hand on the student’s chest and pushed him gently back down, climbing over him as he did so. Sherlock fell back against the bedclothes, licking his lower lip for an instant as John got between his legs. The unpresented student didn’t smell of arousal in the way John was used to – there was nothing to tell John’s subconscious mind that this man was for the taking. He had to use his eyes, his hands, and his mouth to know, instead.
Sherlock braced himself.
John looked at the note, first.
John showed the woman out, and then came back, sitting on his side of the bed as Sherlock rested their daughter on his outstretched legs. Her little arms went up beside her head, as though she had been flattened. It was funny.
Sherlock kept a straight face. "Did you think I was asleep?" He asked, opening his eyes in time to watch John jump. That did make him smile.
John stared, then pulled up his jeans and fastened them, trying not to let his panic show. “You got too close to me. I should have backed off. This is my fault. We’re bonded. It’s just biology, Sherlock.” He tucked his shirt in. “This doesn’t have to mean anything.”
“Strangers.”
“I do.”
But he still kept his desire to become a doctor secret from everyone except Mrs Rivers, who had her set of twins, and promptly became pregnant with another baby. John was slightly squicked out at the speed at which his Form Tutor was producing children, but he was comforted by the fact that she continued to teach, and was very good at it.
“Really.” Lestrade shook his head. “Someone ought to bash your heads together, I swear. Because that baby will be here before you know it. And neither of you are ready.”
John tried to imagine how the vampire had looked, in fashions 500 years past, what colour his eyes might have been, how much pink had been in his cheeks.
“Doctor Watson?” One of the officers on the door yelled.
Even moreso.
“Why wouldn’t you go?” John blinked. “You’re clever enough, you could go to one in London so you could stay living here, if you wanted.”
“What about you, with your arms?” John gestured at Eurus’ fading bruises.
John started sobbing.
And that feel like more than enough, because John’s face is pressed against Sherlock’s chest, lungs filling with the close scent of him, hearing the soft thrum of his heartbeat.
Sherlock hummed a note of thanks, and carefully got up. His knees clicked, but he ignored them. All his joints ached, now. His skin hurt if you brushed against it in the wrong direction, and showering made him cry. His eyes throbbed under bright lights, and even something as simple as sitting on the toilet became an order, as sitting on the plastic seat hurt his thighs, and left bruises.
The house was not silent.
“Santa hasn’t been yet,” Sherlock pointed out, with a gleam in his eyes.
Sherlock moved over to the desk, and touched at the mahogany. “It’s a favour, actually.”
John beamed again, and Sherlock bent over to kiss him.
There was a buzz of noise behind them as a few people took seats to watch the proceedings, but John kept his eyes on the table.
It was troublesome, making friends of humans. They tended to die, one way or another. One way or another, they became lost to you. Victor, James, John, Lestrade… they were all men Sherlock had lost. All losses he had been the instigator of.
The scan got going, and John lay beaming happily at the screen as their baby fuzzed into clarity, little arms and legs wriggling about.
‘Try being the operative word, yes.’
“Nah, you can learn at any time. And then you never forget.” John picked at the skin on his thumbs. “Apparently, anyway.”
“I’ve done it,” Sherlock pulled a plastic wallet out of his bag, neat lines of writing in blue ink.
He gave it a solid minute before going back in himself. He went straight back to the labs, and found them deserted. Molly’s bag was gone. Sherlock shook his head, and went to screw the lid onto his petri dish.
“Just a thing.” John sat back, and Sherlock had to let go. “I can’t ask more of you than that. You’ve made it clear where you stand.”
stare. "Anyway, it turns out Mycroft was engaged, too. To some alpha who didn't follow through on his arrangement."
. They didn’t tell me about this. About school, or getting my own bedroom, or…” his voice broke, and John was pained with how young he was. He wanted to go over the give the boy a hug, but he didn’t want it to be misinterpreted.
you in the shower so long, hm?” She inhaled suddenly, deeply. Her eyes widened. “John?”
He couldn’t change it. James had betrayed him utterly.
required effort, and skill. It was clear now to Sherlock that John’s kissing was part of a mating display, though he hadn’t initiated it when Sherlock had worked his seed from him before – perhaps this only happened when the human initiated the contact. Or perhaps the last time had been out of John’s control. That felt rather worrying, though it clearly hadn’t put John off, as his penis was hard again, and pressing at Sherlock’s body through the human’s clothes Well, if that was a human thing, Sherlock would show him a siren’s way of being intimate, too.
“So they know I’m serious about… this.”
Sherlock walked away, attention having shifted from him, disgust over his own cowardice and stupidity crawling over his skin like someone was pouring oil onto his head. He went out into the quad, and sat on the steps, catching his breath, trying to think straight.
“About forty minutes,” Sherlock’s legs gave way and he sank into the visitor’s chair.
“Missed having you like this,” Sherlock said, his words rolling deep through the quiet night.
“That helps,” Sherlock nodded, before promptly falling asleep, and leaving John to clean up.
Mycroft’s lips had gone very thin. ‘And you think he’s a candidate for a bonding, do you?’
Greg picked up on the third ring. “What.”
Mycroft shook his head. “Oh, Sherlock.”
"Nice to meet you, Sherlock," John said. "Wish I'd kind of known your name before you started fiddling with me, mind..." he closed his eyes. "I'll probably wake up in the morning in my own bed."
Sherlock smirked, and lifted Birdie out of the sling and gave her to Lestrade, who held her and started cooing at her. Birdie looked very unimpressed, and glared hard at him.
“Try, young man, you have to try…”
John gave a small smile. “I’m going back to the flat. I need to tell him where I’m staying. In person.”
“He did it to be funny – it made him laugh,” Sherlock said, taking a deep breath. “He found it… funny, that I was trying to figure out who he was, and everything he said confused me more. He knew I was vulnerable, and trying to figure out new ideas, and I was struggling. So, he fed me lies, and misinformation, and he was amused by it. More than that, he found it hysterical that he could be in a relationship with a
“Well, heroic doctors tend to make the gossip rounds,” James said. “Idiot grunts who nearly blow themselves up… not so much.” He stroked a finger down his own jaw.
Mycroft gave a short laugh. “Apologies, I didn’t mean to offend you. And you are?” he looked at Julian.
Later that night, Sherlock realised he hadn’t said it back.
“Noted, John. I shall keep you informed as to what happens.”
Sherlock sighed, and sat back, away from John’s hands. “It’s what we get told, ok? That no one likes an omega who wants to… do stuff like that. Because it makes us look easy. Like we’re not waiting for the right alpha. But at the same time…” he paused, and grit his teeth for a moment. “At the same time, acting like we don’t want anything to do with alphas is what gets read as attractive. It’s a Catch-22 situation. I don’t want you to think less of me because we… kissed.”
John’s guest room was like the poshest hotel room he had ever been in, except there wasn’t a minibar. The huge bed was made up with soft cottons, and there was a soft towelling robe on the back of the door to the sumptuous bathroom.
“Is it an emergency?” John asked. James walked in, and looked concerned.
“Do you want a bath?” he said softly.
"Oh, thank you," John said, surprised by the display of affection that Sherlock was allowing to go on.
John smiled. “I can’t believe we’re doing this.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It’s just a visit. I usually spend most of it rifling through his library. Dad and him talk business crap, and Mummy drinks tea. It’s like visiting a relative.”
“Oh, no.”
Sherlock went behind John, and knelt, closing his eyes in a sort of prayer before having a look. His stomach dropped. ‘Ohhhh… kay…’
“Sherlock, is this… I don’t want you to feel that you have to…”
“Sibling. Mycroft Holmes,” the vampire offered a hand. John shook it weakly, feeling a bit faint. He badly wanted to sleep all of a sudden, as if fatigue was taking over his limbs.
He let it.
John checked his phone every ten minutes. He told his supervisor the basics of his sudden obsession, and she was happy for him to take on the admin work in the general practice department. There was one text from Sherlock, around lunchtime, where he said he wasn’t in heat, but had maxed out his dinner card, and could John top it up, please.
“Then don’t say –” Sherlock cut off to make a face, gesturing at John to start the timer.
She only gave him a wan smile.
“Then turn him.”
John started up the stairs, and Sherlock and Mycroft bickered behind him the entire way. It was obvious Sherlock wished Mycroft hadn’t chosen this day to come around and give a lecture. He would much rather that John could acclimate, and relax.
Sherlock drew his knees up, and stared at the television, watching the news.
you are. Even if you have… magic hands.” Sherlock grimaced.
“Noted,” Sherlock said, apparently having regained his hearing.
“I’d hate to spoil it for you,” John smiled wider. “You’ll just have to live it.”
John followed Mycroft, not looking up at Sherlock as he passed him, letting the older alpha pick up his bags and show him upstairs to a guest room that was sparse, but neat and clean. It smelled faintly of alpha, as the whole flat did, but moreso of clean, and laundry.
The music stopped.
“I think he saw value in him,” Mycroft said gently. “Victor made Sherlock not think about drugs. Made him not think about you. He was a kind man, and he understood Sherlock’s struggle with addiction. They suited one another.”
“So,” Violet smiled, “when you go into heat, Sherlock will be ready for you. Isn’t that lovely?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock apologised immediately. “I’ll try to remember to warn you.”
“He won’t,” Sherlock stood. “He knows I…”
Sherlock drew the bow over the strings of his Stradivarius. The violin’s last note played out perfectly into the room, vibrating through the air with a melancholy finale.
“I thought he went away for Christmas,” Sherlock said.
“Do you want to wait in here? For Mycroft?” John nodded at the assessment room.
“Oh, god,” John let out a sob. “I was just trying to… I didn’t want to scare him, he was so young. I didn’t want him to think I was going to…”
with my life.’
John smiled, letting his head back to get to Sherlock’s lips, letting his alpha caress his mouth with soft lips, before planting a kiss firmly on him. “Maybe you should.”
John had to smile, at this. “A bit,” he managed.
“Alright, I’ll call the car,” Sherry signalled for the bill. “Do you think… if you maybe had a chance to speak about your problems to someone who wasn’t a therapist…”
Finally, an update! Thanks for being patient with me, guys xx
Mycroft made a noise like an angry cow. “Eurus! Talk to Gregory!”
“Oh, come
The last thing he thought of, before he closed his eyes, was the lack of pity in John Watson’s voice. If he had to be in the care of doctors, he would always choose one who didn’t treat him as though his circumstance was a tragedy.
Before he knew it, John had been living at 221b Baker Street for three weeks. He had a job, working with the police, and a flat-mate who got on his nerves, but who was also his sort-of friend, now. Sherlock hadn’t treated John like an omega, not even slightly. There’d been no stifling ‘looking after’ behaviour, no insistence that John didn’t need to carry that bag, and Sherlock never seemed to think that John couldn’t keep up when they were running. John, on the other hand, had started wondering for how long he
“Your grades are all good,” Mrs River said as she looked over John’s file. It was an after-school session to set his targets and assess him for ability groups. “You went to a private primary, then a state secondary, before coming here?”
Sherlock’s insides clenched, and he roared in agony, slick gushing out of him impossibly. He kept on moving his hand, but it was a splash of water on a bonfire, and had little effect on his need.
“I know, but it’s not that flash.”
“What do you mean?”
Sherlock’s foot stayed wedged against John’s.
Two days of sex left the two of them exhausted and half-asleep in the almost-midday sun. Sherlock was draped over John’s chest, his hair stuck to the side of his head, his stomach slightly distended from the amount of semen that had flooded his womb. Aside from that slight curve, Sherlock was all arms and legs, straight lines and bones. The bumps of his spine rested between John’s fingers.
“John not with you, today?”
“But nothing, lovely. You get more beautiful every day.”
“John, stop making that noise, now. Just breathe.”
"Yes, pay," John started flicking through the folders. "He's a shit most of the time, and this is going to go down like a fucking lead balloon."
“Sherlock?”
John dropped the hand, and sat up sharply, immediately regretting the move as his intestines complained. “Ow. Oh, that’s not good.”
Well. “New”.
And twisted.
Mrs Rivers looked up. “Oh, I see. Have – have you met him?”
Sherlock nodded.
"Just come to the mess," John sighed, not really wanting the vampire alone with his things. "I know you can drink liquids. And you can get a decent brew. Treat yourself."
Sherlock looked up. “You can stay.”
, Sherlock heard a little voice say in his mind.
“I bet it’s not the last,” John said, darkly, before sipping his tea.
John didn’t know what to say. He suddenly felt rather angry, though he knew better than to show it. If Sherlock had been told that alphas were brutes and nasty, he wasn’t going to reinforce that stereotype. “So, what happens now?”
He nodded.
“Yeah, me too,” John shrugged. “I’d love to get off, but there you go.”
Mycroft was quiet for a moment. “You should have used a cubicle,” he said after a moment.
“We always do,” John smiled, and sighed happily as his mate bent to inhale along his throat. “Sherlock…”
Then, the pain came back, with barbs this time, tearing through his abdomen like heat-pains, making his knees go weak. If he’d been standing up, he would have fallen over.
Or the heartbreak he was convinced would come with him.
Sherlock didn’t answer.
“Mm,” John agreed. “The first Christmas at the manor… I didn’t like it.”
John grinned, and Sherlock felt it against his throat. John’s soft bump was pressing against him, and Sherlock badly wanted to touch it, but knew without even asking that it would be unwelcome. If John wanted to pretend it wasn’t there, then so be it.
“You look so beautiful,” John kissed his throat. “Don’t run away with a strange alpha, will you?”
“I have a bit of an idea,” John smiled. “You’re like a new man.”
Except no. It wasn’t.
“No!” John said, reaching out. He shook his head, and made to take the book back.
It was suggestive and welcoming in a way very few of his partners had been before, and Sherlock swallowed, then removed his fingers and gripped the backs of John's knees. He pushed, curling John’s body further upwards, perhaps bruising his skin with the forcefulness of the action as the vampire leaned down and dragged his tongue flat against John's entrance.
“I never meant for this to
There was a mask on his face, and the part of his mind that still worked in medicine told him it was an oxygen mask, to bring him back to consciousness.
John was standing in front of the full-length mirror, mouth open as he probed at his descended fangs. He made eye contact with Sherlock in the mirror. “’ey.”
“Work? An omega’s place is in the home, raising their alpha’s children, not slaving behind some counter.”
John looked up. “You… you’re bonded, that’s meant to be the safest time to get pregnant?”
The gun was entirely pointless - Sherlock was bulletproof, and the base was more of less secure. It just made John feel better to keep his hand on it. Protection from what he wasn't entirely sure.
“I’m sorry,” John sobbed, “I… your bed smelled so nice…”
‘Relax.’ Another order.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock gasped.
“The boy next door, then,” Mycroft said. “Watson.”
“They are people.”
The moon, wreathed in cloud, glowed in amusement at Sherlock’s shocked expression. The snow-clouds were clearing, and the night air was bitingly crisp. Below their shoes, London glowed in a blur of streetlamps, headlights and shop-signs.
John moaned silently, a gust of air leaving his lungs. Sherlock caught it, and kissed it back to him as he slid his fingers out and in again, curling his touch, feeling the depth of John, the warmth and wetness, the familiarity. He ghosted over John’s prostate, making the omega shudder, and arch his back, his body seeking the touch again, and Sherlock gave it to him.
Sherlock blinked, as if the mountains of possibility were rising up in front of him.
“I didn’t know if I was allowed in here,” John admitted.
“If you want something to happen, you should just say so,” John said.
Omega slick was gently running down John’s arse, and he reached quickly, soaking his fingers before gripping both of their erections together, and lubricating their frottage with his own slick.
It took a moment of struggle, the two of them trying to meet, and John’s elbow slipping on the bed, and Sherlock tensing at just the wrong moment.
Sherlock’s stomach clenched. He did not want to hear that man’s voice, his reasoning, his excuses, his justification for what had happened.
“You'll not end up with nothing, John," Sherlock said sternly, meaning it entirely.
"Your pride is commendable, Major Sholto, but perhaps it's not the best idea to meet my eyes. Did you like being under my glamour? Fascinating."
“Good,” Sherlock leaned against him, relaxing. “Can we try kissing, again?”
“Something?”
“Oh god!” Sherlock twitched backwards, searching for more, his in-heat body in complete control of his mind.
“Love… you…” Sherlock tried bending a little to aid John’s touches, but standing made it awkward, and he still had his trousers and pants around his legs. “John, I need to lie back.”
Forever, if they wanted it.
Except then Sherlock is there, closing the space between them awkwardly, hands on John’s body, and for once neither of them is resisting or doing the masculine back-slapping and grinning routine because this is going to be different. And John makes himself small, allows Sherlock to hold him – to
In love.
“It’s fine,” John opened his eyes. “Is she ok?”
“They’re not for immature omegas,” Sherlock pointed out.
Detective Inspector Lestrade had eventually persuaded John to come out from under the table, and had taken ‘a statement’ from him, delivered tonelessly as John looked at the kitchen tiles. Mycroft had then written a statement, and Lestrade had told John not to worry, he’d have his place of address corrected in no time.
“Deal.”
Lestrade waited. “To… John? Or to you?”
“There won’t be a precedent,” John said after putting Birdie down for the night. “If an alpha wants to claim a fallen omega’s child, he can. Birdie is his property. He made her.”
“Oh, god. In his condition..?”
Or else John really was that perfect.
"Have you ever been one?" John asked, without thinking.
“I never wanted to bond with an omega,” Sherlock said softly. “I never had the flash of lust, or love, that gets talked about. I saw having a bond as being forced to give up my freedoms, and… a lot of people found that difficult to understand. Even Mycroft, and he thinks the same way. I think he wanted for me what he didn’t find for himself.”
“Your baby looks great,” the technician said, smiling. “The nasal measurements are all good, and…” she carried on rattling off information, but John couldn’t hear her.
“How? He’s an alpha.”
Sherlock looked over. “Cam? Really?”
They’d somehow come south of the river, and were approaching the gardens at Kew.
“Sherlock, look at this,” Mycroft called over.
“And then apply to the force. I’ll give you any references you need, you’ll walk straight into a good job.”
"Sherlock. Why are you a detective?"
“Because a new omega has shown up. Daddy and Mycroft have been snapping at each other, and Mummy is off with me because she’s got a mate and I haven’t… It’ll be fine in a couple of days, so they said at the hospital.”
John laughed softly, looking down at the therapist rubbing something warming and peppermint-y onto his feet. “This should be weird, but honestly I never want to get out of this chair. Such a great idea, Sherry, thanks for suggesting it.”
“I trust you, Sherlock. I just hope you trust me, too.” He looked up.
John grit his teeth. “You’re…you’re what? You’re my best friend, Sherlock. You have been since we were little and we used to play in the back garden. Something’s been eating at you for a while, I know it. You’ve been keeping secrets, and I haven’t always listened I know, but… Sherlock, please.”
John looked up, slightly.
He felt as if he was getting his life back.
Sherlock huffed as he lay down on the torn mattress on John’s side of the room, staring at the ceiling for a moment before closing his eyes. He would leave, and he would leave easily. John would say goodbye easily, and Sherlock wouldn't look back. He could resign himself from this one human, as he had all the others the past half a millennia.
did you do to me, Sherlock?” John eyes flashed like rubies in the afternoon light. His mouth was open, fangs bared, his shoulders set in an animalistic way Sherlock had never seen before. John was running on instinct, and Sherlock would have to talk him down.
Mycroft pressed his lips together for a moment. “You… you are aware that the terms of your engagement forbid you from Higher Ed?”
“You can say, Sherlock. If you were ok, you wouldn’t have paused,” John smiled gently down at him.
"I only assumed that it would be a hindrance to your case, which seemed rather time sensitive. You've thus far never welcomed distractions. Care to explain what makes this any different?"
“That future can never be,” John said. “But think of the love you could give others. The ways your love has already helped the world, saved the world.”
“Yes, him… I wanted to see if he took on people like me for work experience.” Sherlock blushed as he finished.
John concentrated on the road as they drove towards the temporary barracks. The dust kicked up, and the tyres bocketed over stones, and just keeping control of the wheel made John's shoulders ache slightly, his arms shaking with the vibrations travelling up through the vehicle. It meant you had to pay attention.
“Because someone else would be a better family for it than just me?”
“Cough?” John took out his stethoscope, and motioned for Sherlock to lift his pyjama top, which he did.
“…no,” Sherlock whispered.
They smiled at one another.
John blinked. “You love her.”
Jim went purple. “I am not making this up. Sherlock is a transsexual. At our old school, she was wearing a skirt and had long hair. That’s why Watson isn’t gay – he’s with a girl playing dress-up!”
“I’ve deleted it,” John said quickly. “I just… it came through after we… were... you know, last night. It… I didn’t want to see it, but then I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I’m sorry. I should have said –”
James nodded. “Didn’t think so. It’s not like we were dating, right? Like he is?”
Sherlock pursed his lips after the mention of the war.
John pretended to be asleep.
Sherlock clamped his mouth shut, as if he was biting back a great deal he wanted to say.
“No, I – I’m sorry.”
There was a small
Sherlock covered his face with his hands. “Victor…”
“He’s a friend, Sherlock, not just some… man who entertains you with murders.”
John’s heart lurched. “I always mean what I say, Sherlock.”
John woke when the recording of morning trumpets sounded into the corridors. He tensed slightly at the feeling of an arm over him, before he remembered. He smiled, snuggling back, feeling a fold of duvet between him and Sherlock - the vampire must have stuffed it between them during the night to stop John getting too cold. John moved it, now, the coolness of Sherlock’s body welcome with the increasing warmth of his own.
John tried to scream. But no sound came out of his mouth.
“Grown-ups say a lot when they think you’re not listening,” John said.
Sherlock moaned, not in pain, but in the revelry of being claimed. “Yes!”
“I don’t mind going,” John said.
They looked at each other, and smiled.
“We need an on-call, actually,” Greg Lestrade said, not shaking hands as his arms were full of files. John was grateful. The detective inspector wasn’t John’s type, but he had the sort of easy attractiveness of any alpha, and John’s hormones were enough of a mess as it was. The detective nodded to himself. “This could work out quite well… any police experience, Doctor Watson?”
He shut his eyes.
Sherlock glanced away. “I… When Mycroft came. He asked me if I’d thought about… you. As an option.”
John squeezed his eyes shut.
“So… because some alpha might be a pervert, Sherlock has to hide in a cubicle to pee?” John asked. “That’s… why don’t you do something about the actual perverts?”
“I could give you a lift,” the beta man on the pavement called. “If you feel safe to –”
Sherlock vaguely remembered sitting in the doctor’s office as the man behind the desk spoke to his mother. He remembered the man had a big poster of a skeleton on the wall, and Sherlock had got down and wandered over to it to name as many of the bones as he could, which was a lot.
‘Has he?’ Sherlock asked in surprise.
John sat on the edge of his desk, and put his head in his hands.
Sherlock shut his eyes as a wave of pain coursed through his insides. It ebbed away slowly. Manageable pain, the specialist had called it. Pain you could deal with. To stop you becoming too reliant on pain-killers. Sherlock had just stared at her when she said that. He was an addict already. Morphine barely touched the sides, sometimes. Other times it seemed to knock him out flat. It was like an itch under his skin, on his bones, never reachable, always buzzing through him. It had gotten easier, that was for sure. But it would never go away. Not until he died.
Where was John?
There were flies in the room, now.
“Gone?”
Uni had made Sherlock lose a bit of weight, apparently, but he was taller again, unless John wasn’t remembering him properly. He gave John a tiny smile that was probably meant to be reassuring.
John swallowed, and looked back at his phone. He’d forgotten what it was like to live in a crowded city where vampires mingled with the populace. He, and everyone else in the train, was one second away from being reclassified as ‘food’.
“Don’t be,” Sherlock said as John pushed his head to one side. “I love you.”
John stared. “That’s… debatable, I –”
John pressed the phone against his forehead, biting his lip in shame and sorrow. It was like admitting he was a failure. That he’d been awful to Sherlock, driven him away, when it was, in his eyes, anything but the truth.
‘Where have you been?’ John breathed into his ear.
for one alpha in particular – his mate.
“Must’ve felt safe,” John leaned up to kiss him softly. Then a horrid sinking feeling crept down his chest and settled in his stomach. He felt his mouth turn down against his will. “Sherlock-“
“Can anyone tell me what the inpatient procedure would be for receiving an omega in hospital?” John asked.
for that, Sherlock. Your life was still full, so
He crashed to the floor.
Sherlock let out a breath, but didn’t collapse on top of John like the omega wanted.
Would she be an omega, like him?
John sighed. He'd asked himself the same question many times. "I guess because when it started it was just... I don't know. Release. I didn't even think I liked men, at that point."
Sherlock went to sit at the back in his Maths class, to continue with the solo work he’d been given by the exasperated teacher.
Sherlock let out an anguished moan. “You – you… weren’t…”
“I don’t know for sure, yet,” he said, looking up at John. “But I have an idea.”
Sherlock nodded.
And yet, when John bit him, he couldn’t deny that something changed. He felt a swell of love, so intense he gasped. Something changed in his psyche – something he couldn’t put a finger on. John loved him. He always would. And it was as clear a fact as gravity.
“He said
Sherlock looked at him, at the weapon of his undoing in John’s hand. “John…”
“I think it can only be him. He’s the only person still alive who I’ve wronged.” Sherlock glanced at John’s bruised throat. “Aside from you, perhaps.”
“He came to see me. With some… information. About couples looking to adopt.”
Molly gave a weak smile up at Mycroft. “Thanks for asking us.”
“And… why have your brother and dad left the house?”
Sherlock hoped he failed every single one.
John looked up. “But –”
There hadn’t even been a proper Hello.
“Nothing,” John looked at him.
“He likes you. I can smell it. I can smell a lot of things recently; I think I’ll mature pretty soon. He smells… jealous. And possessive.”
“John, look at me. I want you to look at me.”
“Sure.”
Sherlock licked his dry lips. “I don’t feel it, yet,” he whispered.
“He… he never even reacted,” John forced out. “He just stared. Like… like he couldn’t even see me.”
“Mummy,” a little voice came from behind Molly. A small girl peeped around Molly’s leg. “Who’s that?”
And John spent his final night in hospital with his mate squashed into the bed with him, holding him tight, one pale hand splayed over his scarred stomach, face buried into his hair.
The vampire groaned as he watched John's mouth spread around him, taking him all the way, down his throat. John’s nose buried into Sherlock's stomach, and he lifted his hands, scraping his fingernails over Sherlock's abdomen, down his thighs, choking lightly as he swallowed around Sherlock, before pulling off again with a gasp, saliva dripping down his chin.
“I dreaded,” Mycroft said, staying on the doorstep. “We are not a hive mind, my parents and I. Some of us opposed this from the word ‘go’. May I come in? I have Sherlock’s belongings in the car. My man will bring them up.”
“Ah. Well, then I think it’s even more important they continue this spontaneous friendship.”
John nodded, dropping his arms after a moment. He looked into Sherlock’s face and touched his jaw with a finger. “You’ll be fine, Sherlock. About it all. You’ll be fine. And I’ll be here, when you get back.”
“I haven’t received my injury compensation yet,” John said firmly. “It’s been a month.”
“What’s that?” John stroked the baby’s hand.
Sherlock stared, his eyes wide, mouth pinched as he tried to hold back tears.
“Have
Sherlock watched her turn to one of the servers to ask about the canapes, and filed her words away for later dissection. He didn’t want to be the only one left at his current school, but his only option besides that was to leave and see where his life took him. Omega education was only obligatory until age thirteen, so Sherlock was pushing his luck as it was. A year abroad would be something many omegas only dreamed of.
Sherlock joined John for a shower, lucky that most of the men had already had theirs that morning as they had a lingering snog brought on by eyes meeting just a moment too long. Foam and soap ran down their bodies as Sherlock let himself be pressed against the tiles to avoid John catching a chill.
“Keep your hand on it,” John pulled his medi-kit out. “Don’t lessen the pressure. Is it deep?”
“Please don’t stop,” John cried. “It’s my birthday.”
The prickling feeling at John's knees got worse.
“Alright,” John frowned, watching the dextrous tentacles lift out bits and pieces, and eventually his notebook. “Don’t get that wet,” John took it, quickly. “Sorry. It’s paper. Look…” he flipped a few pages, and turned it around when he reached the portrait he’d drawn of Sherlock. “It’s supposed to be you, but… I don’t know. I’m not an artist. I don’t think it’s bad, though.”
John frowned. “So… why is Sherlock –”
Sherlock reached out for it, then hesitated. “Er…”
“Mycroft, don’t you dare walk away from me,” John shoved the door open and grabbed the alpha by the lapels, yanking him down to face him. “You did something. Didn’t you?”
Sherlock planned to sneak in. John paused as he soaped up, imagining what that might entail.
Her hands stopped on the files. “And – and you’re looking on your own?”
“You’re not exactly impartial,” Mycroft pointed out.
Sherlock swiped his card, and opened the door, glancing up at the CCTV. “Come closer, John. Stop, right there. Ok… One, two, three, click. One, two, three, click. One-”
John groaned, and hid his face. “It doesn’t matter. You don’t know, and I don’t want to tell you, ok? It’s… embarrassing.”
. John got off Sherlock’s lap. His erection had entirely wilted away through shame. “I’m sorry. I’m not in the right headspace for this right now.”
There was a heartbeat of silence.
John was furious, and fierce, and scenting Sherlock like an alpha possessed. He was driven by hormones and jealousy, and for the first time, Sherlock was almost afraid of him. “You’re mine.”
“In ten..? Oh, I see.” Molly glanced down at John’s stomach. “Hasn’t he been supportive?”
John took a moment for that to sink in. “Right. Ok. That’s…” he sat on the window seat. “Makes my scarf look a bit shit.”
Or staring, it was difficult to say how much thinking he was doing when the only thing in his head was white noise and worry.
Sorry this has been so long coming... I've had to take on more paid work to try and cover some unexpected bad news, and that's taken a lot out of me emotionally, too. Writing things I love, like fic, has had to take a back-seat, and that's just made me feel worse. But hopefully things are turning around, now! Apologies again for keeping you all waiting.
“Wait,” John took hold of Sherlock’s arms, and the alpha stopped. “Wait, you – you mean you know that I’m a… that I’m not a beta?”
John didn't laugh, but he did smile. "No, sir."
engraved on the top. The pen inside was monogrammed with the same.
“He’s not picking up,” John came back over. “I don’t suppose you still have his number?”
“You fucking act like you are!” John stood, seeing black dots burst in front of his vision. “Get this set right!”
“John – I –”
John wondered if he was supposed to feel sad, knowing Sherlock had had sex.
“If they think anything, I haven’t heard it.”
“I know you don’t need to see,” Sherlock said. “But I want you to. This… is the last time I’m going to look like this. And you’ve never seen.” His mouth twitched. “The incident, aside.” He held the gown together, with a hand.
Then, he saw nothing at all.
Violet smiled wider. “You are making this old woman very happy, John. And the fact you say you will stay with Sherlock no matter the outcome of his maturity… To be frank with you, it opened my eyes.” She steepled her fingers in the same way John had seen Sherlock do so often. “For so long, my mate and I’s focus has been on inheritance, on finding mates for our children. But it should have been on their happiness. Sherlock has found you. Who is to say that Eurus, ill as he is, cannot find someone of his own to love?” She looked suddenly sad. “I fear I have wasted a great deal of time, indeed.”
Sherlock nodded. “I…”
“That’s very… understanding of you.”
“You should put some inside me, too,” Sherlock parted his legs, and John wondered how something so clinical could sound so damn sexy.
“I think,” Sherlock picked up a teaspoon, “we should draw a line under this.”
“He has a uterus,” John said, keeping his voice down. “But that’s all I know for sure.”
In John’s head, the person Sherlock had kissed was an alpha man, bigger and stronger than he was. The imaginary alpha was handsome and well-built, and rich, and he gave Sherlock lavish presents and told him he’d take care of him forever.
The room was dimmed by the drawn curtains, and Sherlock was sitting up in bed tapping at an ipad. The text on the screen was large.
“You have to say you do,” he gripped her hand hard. “Even if you don’t. You tell John. And the trust. You tell them you trust me. And I promise. Not to.”
“There’s nothing weak about a young man who’s dying admitting himself into hospital,” John said.
Not really.
“It’s Christmas,” John rubbed his eyes. “It makes you tired. Food and central heating and expectation.”
There was only a moment’s delay, as Sherlock slicked lubricant onto his cock, and then he was over John, his alpha cock rubbing against John’s little omega one, smearing pre-come over them both, making their arms tremble, their bodies arch in need to touch, to thrust…
“Not as long as I’m having heats,” John pointed out. “and you’re fine coming over to
Sherlock pressed a few buttons on the controller, and John sat up slightly, pressing a kiss to the back of Sherlock’s neck.
Hurt throbbed through John’s chest, unexpectedly. “Thanks. I thought I did count, anyway, if I’m such a concern?”
John wondered if he could crawl down the plughole and escape. “I… don’t know.” In the Holmes’ Manor, he usually stuck to toast, or Eurus’ sugary cereals.
“…yeah.”
“I don’t like this,” Sherlock said suddenly.
John clapped his hands together. “Well, then. There we go.”
The Head Teacher – a beta woman in her sixties named Ms Tressle – met them in her office. She took their names without batting an eyelid, and John realised she had to have seen all sorts in her time.
The question looked to have smacked John like a ton of bricks. He gaped, and glanced around the room as if looking for an exit. “That’s – that’s not going to happen, though, is it? No one wants to be stuck with this.” He put a hand to his belly. And glared at Sherlock like an accusation.
Sherlock could only nod. His legs gripped John tight, his hands on John’s arms, trying to ground himself, to get over the fact his omega’s cock was inside him.
Sherlock had watched John leave, sincerely wishing he hadn't given into temptation, but also put in the odd position of not quite regretting it.
John nodded.
John gave a tiny laugh. “Flatterer… Breathe out, now, Sherlock. Through your mouth. Blow.”
I can't believe this fic has crossed ten thousand views! *crying emoji* I'm so, so grateful for all the reads, comments and kudos you guys have left, you are all the best readers in the world, and I am so, so grateful to you all. xxxx
John saw it, anyway. “Hey -  what’s happened to your tie?” He caught Sherlock by the shoulders and turned him, Sherlock’s omega instincts forcing him to comply with the action. He snorted, and looked at the floorboards as John surveyed the tie, which had been sprogged and neatly snipped in half. “What the hell?”
The manor was empty, save for the sounds of the piano in the music room. That was Violet. John listened, halfway down the stairs, for Siger.
John nudged him. “Don’t be. It’s ok.” He looked over to where the adults were clustered, trying to get in touch with their drivers as the boys waited for the luggage. “Sherlock… are you mad at me?”
"Okay."
Unless they never had sex.
“Right.”
John checked his phone at midnight, struggling to see the time in his queasy state. He’d made it until ten pm before admitting he was too far gone to risk leaving the flat, and had spent more time than seemed realistic in the bathroom before dragging himself back into the bedroom, his limbs shaking.
John smiled sadly. “I was a soldier.”
John’s stomach contracted around the rich food, and he had to look away, at the floor, to stay grounded.
"You'd better hope he solves this case before someone stakes him. Captain Watson." Sholto grabbed John's shirtfront. "You're still mine."
He looked.
The nurse applied gel to John’s skin, and pressed a fat wand with a flat head like a paint-roller onto it. “What does your mate do?”
Sherlock woke before his alarm went off, and stared at the grey light filtering through the curtains. He felt tired, and wrung-out, and so ready to roll back over and sleep for ever. No more worry, no more angst, no more fear, or disgust with himself… It would be so peaceful.
Mycroft gave a single nod. “I always had reservations about Mr Trevor. A beta addicted to heroin, a history of failing to attend rehabilitation courses to their end, though, like Sherlock, a promising student, and rather clever. I dreaded the thought of them together. They would either kill one another, or…”
John shook his head. “I’m not. I’m not, and I never will be.”
Sherlock watched the ‘sending’ bar crawl across the screen. The school’s wifi was appalling. Checking himself in the mirror again, he went out, and headed to maths for his test. He got a few funny looks as he went through the corridors – he probably looked like he’d been throwing up. He ignored them, and let himself into the classroom with a minute to spare, sitting at the back as usual, taking his scarf off, and undoing him top button. He now felt too hot. He’d get John to come and pick him up when this test was done.
There was a knock at the door to the stairs. They looked over, and Mycroft’s driver was hovering awkwardly in the hall.
“When do you get to take her home?” Victor asked softly.
adopt Birdie. Come to think of it, is that allowed? She does technically have a father, even if he’s nameless and absent.’
He put the stethoscope around his neck, and looked in the mirror.
He sat in the bedroom, holding the thick folder, the leaflet folded into four, on the top.
The drugs hit his empty stomach and fizzed, frothing up his throat horribly, so Sherlock had to sick them up in the sink as quietly as he could. He rinsed his mouth out, and considered waking John, then saw the time.
Timothy threw his covers back, chilling Sherlock immediately. “Are you alright?”
“I doubt it,” Sherlock pouted, as John lifted his hand away. “But… it will have to do. For now.”
“You ok walking on your own?”
"I needed oxygen, you bastard," John avoided a kiss. "You can't actually suffocate me, you know."
“I don’t like girls,” Sherlock sighed, but he might as well have been talking to the wall.
Mr Thorne had noticed, of course. ‘I don’t know what’s the matter with you, Sherlock,’ he sighed. ‘Are you worried about school ending, or something? Your attitude is really poor.’
“Doesn’t sound so complex, John,” she smiled gently at him. “Is he a nice man? Boy?”
“Thanks.” The man took a seat, then offered a hand. “Captain Joe Crossland.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was blindingly obvious that they were now talking about sex, and both teenagers felt a flush of embarrassment.
“Alright then… yes. We will. All of us.”
John gave a tiny smile.
“I realise,” Sherlock said, then put a hand to his mouth, realising he’d argued with the alpha in front of him.
“That wasn’t what I asked.”
John kissed her hair, which was beginning to fall out (they’d said it might, though he was still funny to look at), before starting on the grim task at hand. Minutes later, the nappy was replaced, and John was lying back on the bed, Lucy under his pyjama top, starting on her breakfast with gusto. He kept a hand on her back, and let his eyes close, half-grateful for the pinch on his skin where she dug her nails in – it kept him awake.
John looked at the desk.
“Can I go straight to Mycroft’s?” John asked.
Sherlock’s eyes blazed.
“No,” Sherlock said. “But you’re just out of hospital, and you haven’t even made your tea.”
“Precisely,” Mycroft smirked, not missing a beat. He sipped from his glass, and nodded at John. “You’re looking well, Doctor Watson.”
Sherlock was pinned to the mattress, John’s hands holding him by the wrists. John was kissing and rutting down his body, making him twitch and shiver with every touch. Sherlock moaned, and rocked his hips up. And got a bite on his nipple for his trouble.
“So… how can I help you today?”
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just squeezed John’s hand.
And the thought of that made John feel distinctly strange. Alphas were not simply machines programmed to only want omegas. Plenty of alphas married betas, that wasn’t unusual. But Sherlock smelled of nothing. Just himself. Which had to mean Victor wanted him for just… him. Despite the fact Sherlock’s body was not ready for anything more than kisses and cuddles, he was staying with him.
John put his head slightly on one side. “Not all alphas think like that.”
John frowned. “So… if you were being careful, how…?”
John scooted over, and perched on the footstool near Sherlock’s head. “Hey, handsome.”
“Yes, yes,” Sherry waved a hand and took out a pack of cigarettes. “But let’s let bygones be bygones…”
John left the hospital by himself, unable to bring himself to ask Sherlock to meet him. The flat at 221B was cleaned and ready to be lived in again. He carried his backpack of things over to the taxi rank, and caught a cab into the city. As it drove down the road, John rested his head back against the seat. He had a lot to think about.
“She was brisk,” Sherlock sat up and rubbed his face. “She was happy enough to wait for me to present, but she was rather keen on me getting pregnant. Instantly.”
“They already make my life hell for being gay,” Sherlock moved his head to lie on his side. “I haven’t even said ‘yes’ when someone’s asked if we’re going out. I don’t want you to get it, too.”
“Mycroft has my number,” John pointed out. “You know where I live. This isn’t… appropriate.”
“Good. I never thought you’d swear like that after all your posh etiquette lessons,” John grinned. “You used to.”
“Sherlock, please,” John grabbed Sherlock’s hand, and put it over his stomach, the cold gel making the touch wet and slippery, but warm, and John’s body felt such satisfaction at the touch – his mate’s hand over his pregnancy – that he wanted to burst into tears all over again, electricity running over his skin, and John realised it wasn't just because Sherlock was his mate. It was because he was Sherlock, and he was touching him.
John didn’t protest.
But Mycroft was still wading through disbelief. ‘Sherlock – there is
John came out of his rut around twenty hours later. He woke up with his head pounding from dehydration, the acrid smell of come in the air. He groaned, and lifted his head from the mattress. His bedroom looked like a bomb had hit it, and for the first time he regretted having carpets installed in it. They’d have to be cleaned, or replaced, more like. His landlady would throw a fit.
Siger let go of him, and John stumbled away, pressing his back against the fridge, knowing without asking that he was not allowed to leave, just yet. Siger folded his arms and looked at him, slowly, down and up.
A broken cry came from upstairs, and John snapped.
“Oh my god,” John breathed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “That’s…”
“Amy made me block it,” Victor said apologetically. “Sorry. Look, I’ll be fine, go get your phone. You’ll only sit worrying –”
Sherlock went redder, looking away.
“Oh, my god,” John swallowed, nearly choking on his unexhaled air.
“Romance?” John suggested.
Make that two more chapters! I would very much bear in mind the tropes of this AU, and the fact this is now a series(!) as you read what's to come.
Sherlock put a hand at the side of John’s face. “I want to stop. Just for tonight. After all that’s happened today… It doesn’t feel right to do anything more.”
Five years did sound like a long time, to John’s childish ears.
"Who found them?"
“Good luck,” John stood as Sherlock came down the stairs.
“All female-bodies have uteri,” the student reeled off, “and vaginas. But alpha women don’t have functional ovaries, and this one looks like they’re fully developed.”
“God…” Sherlock kissed John’s mostly-flat stomach again, scenting over the skin as if he could get closer to their foetus. “John…”
“Sherlock!” his mother banged on his door, startling him.
‘We’ll deny it.’
That it’s finally done.
“Yes. He thinks Jim might have hacked into our home network to access family photos. That’s a crime. He’s doing some sort of trace at work, today.”
“I’ll see you at Christmas,” Sherlock suddenly bent down and pulled John into a hug.
Sholto looked at the empty playing field. “You’re nice, John. Too nice for this sort of thing, that’s for sure.”
The boy glanced at him again, looking confused. “Physics. Maths. Law.”
John nodded, and looked away as Sherlock walked out.
“Ok…”
“And the news story?”
“Maturity cannot be forced through intercourse,” Mycroft said. “It is rumour and old wives’ tales.”
“And if he is a beta, then… now, I only wish to see him happy,” Violet said, her voice breaking.
“It’s the sugar and the bubbles,” John said. He grabbed the remote and turned on the TV. “And the caffeine, maybe. I don’t know how it works.”
“Makes sense to me,” John said. He shifted slightly, and rubbed his nose. “Not wanting to give up your freedom. It’s got you where you are now, anyway?”
“And alphas are all six foot six with biceps the size of Brooklyn,” John snorted. “It’s all bullshit. Your height and build and decided by your genes. Gender is just a nudge.”
“Yes, exactly,” John smiled.
“Information for a get out of jail free card?”
“I don’t mind other people’s.”
“Three hours ago you regretted being born,” John pointed out. “Who’s to say you won’t regret this?”
John, naturally, blamed himself for the whole thing. He had kissed Sherlock without his permission, and Sherlock had probably been too afraid to take his hand away during the film. John was a terrible friend.
He resisted the urge to bit his own lip at the sight of it.
“I don’t suppose they talk a lot about university at your finishing school.”
“What happened to Molly?” Sherlock turned to the angel. “She wasn’t at Bart’s… What happened to her?”
Underwear is kicked off, and there’s a moment of
As was his wallet.
“Sherlock… this isn’t a game, it’s your education.” John folded his arms. “And why did you request a tutorial if you didn’t want to catch up on the lecture?”
“He’s gone?” Sherlock appeared moments later.
“No, it’s not ok. But it is what it is.”
“Ouch,” he whispered to himself. He frowned at his stomach. He’d been having mild pains for the past two days. John assured him they were nothing to get worried about. Except the baby seemed to love pressing her head down, and that made pain radiate out through Sherlock’s pelvis and back. The warm bathwater helped, at least.
“No, I’m not,” Sherlock sighed. “Mycroft is going to Italy, and he did invite me, but I’m… not bothered about going.”
But how could he ever try and make it his, as well?
you –”
John would later put the yell he made down to surprise.
John picked up his tea, letting go of Sherlock’s hand. “Mycroft and Greg are over later, don’t forget.”
Sherlock considered. “I meant. The actual… process.”
He shrugged.
Sherlock had to smile. “It’s involuntary, when you first turn. Can happen without you wanting it to, or as a result of a stimulus.” His smile twitched. “Like an erection.”
“Yes, but you’ve not –”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
He grit his teeth as he stomped up the stairs. He knew it was the testosterone making him ruder and more antisocial than usual, but it wasn’t just that.
“Don’t you start,” Sherlock sighed, getting under the covers. He smelled of that sour lime shower gel he liked to use, though maybe John’s bedding left something to be desired, as Sherlock sniffed the duvet, and the pillow, several times.
Sherlock was bent double, letting Lucy hold onto his fingers as she ‘walked’ over the grass. Greg Lestrade was laughing his head off as he filmed it, and Violet Holmes was giggling into her pink gin as Molly – Sherlock’s friend from St Bart’s – watched with something like a mixture of apprehension and delight.
John looked at Sherlock, then did a crooked smile that Sherlock liked. "I think I do."
“What?” John half laughed. “I thought that was a myth!”
“It’s cliché,” John smiled, “but when you get older, you’ll realise. I used to think I’d be the calmest, most polite alpha doctor ever. Then I matured and joined the army and started fights and my parents said it was like I’d been replaced, until I learned to control it.”
A fresh gush of slick distracted them both.
They settled into a pattern of small movements, John kissing and inhaling, Sherlock stroking and making little shivered motions as John explored his chest, making no effort to get to his throat. That could wait.
“Sorry you had to go through it. I… I wish you hadn’t.”
“Not at all?”
John realised he’d been staring at it for some time. He went red, and brushed at his own, new jeans. “I should… go pay for these, too. Especially now.”
“No,” John glared at Sherlock. “Come on, Sherlock, it’s going to be an alpha boy. Let’s at least pretend we’re getting a surprise.”
“You know what I –”
He stroked his bump again, absent-mindedly.
The words hung in the air, unpleasantly. Sherlock’s mind was a blur of conflicted emotions. He wanted to say a million things, and also nothing at all because John was right, but he was wrong, but he was…
"Even if he doesn't let you come," Sherlock finally looked up.
He had never been lured into John’s bed.
“All that – that I have,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, “I will share with you.”
Then Sherlock stepped into John’s arms, and John felt himself melt. Sherlock planted his forehead on John’s shoulder, and just stood there as John held him loosely around his middle.
The heat suppressants John had spoken of were now in the bathroom cabinet, on the top shelf.
John swallowed hard, throat dry, limbs trembling. His heart was thundering in his chest. He opened his eyes and nearly screamed at the sight of two red ones staring back at him, before he remembered. "Oh, shit," he clamped a hand to his chest. "Shit, fuck. Sorry." He stood straighter. "Sorry... about that." Embarrassment began to creep through him, along with the dissipating fear, and shame.
“She likes you, she’s intelligent, and she’s from a good family,” John listed. “You should ask her.”
“Ok…” John put the essay on his pile of marking. “Thank you. The lecture you missed –”
John whined, tears leaking down his face again. He did want… that. He wanted someone. He wanted to be… Had.
“They’ve practically ordered you out,” Mycroft said. “He’s not being brought around until tomorrow. You need rest.”
done that. After everything, he’d been suggestive. “I – I didn’t think…”
to. We’ve been together over a year and I’ve never seen your chest. I don’t need to, because you didn’t want me to.”
“I suspected.”
“Please don’t mention your mother when my knot is up your arse,” John sighed.
“You can have the sofa,” Davis shrugged, not seeming to be bothered by the wet patch Sherlock’s flannel had left on it.
‘Switzerland?’ Cam asked, eyebrows raised. ‘Really?’
Sherlock had spent his special day at university, coming home to find Mycroft had planned a meal out, and John shyly presented him with a cake he’d made after school. The evening had felt horribly stilted, as they all talked louder than necessary, and tried to avoid thinking about the next day. John had the day off from school to attend, and he could barely taste the cake he’d made, though he suspected that was more to do with his cooking than nerves.
“I thought she’d be the image of you,” John said. “Dark, and everything. Guess I’ve got stronger genes.”
“Come on,” Sherrinford pointed with the biscuits. “Let’s get out of here before we’re knee-deep.”
“Arranged for a few years, now. John has lived with us since he was ten.”
“You need to tell him. Otherwise you’re just keeping secrets, and that’s the same as lying.” James folded his arms, then relaxed them, trying, John could see, not to seem threatening. Fourteen weeks ago, John could probably have fought James off, physically. Now, he wasn’t so sure. He was weaker, and vulnerable, with another life inside him. Both of them knew that.
It was a picture message.
John let go. “What happened?”
The first two years were probably the worst.
“I shouldn’t have threatened him,” John sighed. “I nearly bit him.”
Sherlock’s presence made the time go faster.
“Heaven only knows. The office organises it. I gather they’re all influential or important in some way or other. People you need to keep onside, that sort of thing.”
Sherlock put the controller down, and leaned against John properly, the game forgotten as he relaxed, letting John’s hand slip beneath the hem of his t-shirt, and touch warmly at the skin of his stomach.
“I really wish you hadn’t,” Sherlock said, eyes still shut. “That’s all you’re going to think of, now. Me, with – with – with – ”
It was all very boring.
“You did nothing but moan when you were giving off all those pheromones.”
“It’s not ok.”
“Thank you,” John nodded. “I’m sure he’ll be fine. His stats look good, and he’s stable.”
‘You know what,’ Lestrade gestured at Sherlock’s chest, where Birdie was firmly strapped into a carrier. A number of admiring people were pausing to peep at her as they passed. ‘You can’t bring a baby to a police station.’
Cold disappointment landed on John’s chest. “No,” he said, “I get that.”
“So, it’s just you and your brother? What’s he like?”
“Mum says ten is too young to be courting.”
“Oh,” Sherlock smiled slowly.
“I invented the term.”
The praise made John melt, his inner omega relishing in being told such things. He gave a little purr, and parted his legs further, letting Sherlock settle there, their cocks slotting together as if designed for it, heat against damp heat as Sherlock continued his thrusts, rubbing them together, sparks of pleasure flying between them.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Sherlock asked, as John slipped Lucy under his t-shirt again, and she enthusiastically went for his nipple.
John clicked the slideshow on, showing a graph of hormone levels. “Alpha men and women can present at any age between around twelve and twenty – there’s no set time limit on presentation, it’s simply to do with hormone levels. Nor does it mean that an alpha that matures at twelve is somehow
John looked up at him, wordlessly.
John frowned in the dark. "Why?"
John scraped butter onto his crumpets, and took an overlarge bite of one, angrily. He knew he was being ridiculous, but he couldn’t help it. How could he talk about milk pads or maternity towels or pressure stockings with Sherlock when he couldn’t even talk about them to himself? He didn’t have a single item of baby equipment. He didn’t even have a clue where they were going to sleep.
“Sherlock, you should have called, I was going to –” Victor stopped in the doorway. “Oh. Hello, John.”
He didn’t feel any better the next morning, at breakfast. He sat at the table in the kitchen, looking at the photo again, at the face of the figure in it, at their smooth face and rounded cheeks.
He opened his eyes. “Oh god.”
Sherlock stood, his eyes peering through John as he stepped towards the man. "You… you make me remember what it was like to be human."
‘You realise you never even had me sign a lease?’ John sighed, letting Sherlock’s teeth drag over his skin, without being afraid of a bite.
“Oh…” he blushed. “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock was on the tiny, squashy sofa at the back of the office, curled up asleep, his coat over himself like a blanket.
Sherlock picked up his test tube in the metal tongs. “And the circus isn’t in town, Jim, and yet you’re still in fine form for the freak show.”
“Shit…” John gripped the bedclothes with a hand to steady himself. “Sherlock…”
“You said, if they can handle it so can we?” John blinked. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
This was no life.
And there was no Sherlock.
“Mycroft said the same,” John managed to say from where he was pressed into Sherlock’s shirt.
“No, but give me a few years.”
“Not at all. I wasn’t joking when I said help yourself to my books, either. Any interest you have, let us encourage it.”
A sudden peacefulness settled over him, and John struggled to stay awake. "Sherlock?"
“I’ll take that as a yes. Well, for some people, boy omegas are… especially attractive. You know how some betas prefer men over women? Same sort of thing.”
“I see. And Mr Watson,” she turned in her chair to face John, who stood up. “You did not tell Mr Mayhew you were keeping your baby, nor did you tell him he was a father, correct?”
“It’s not that I don’t want tuition,” Sherlock said quickly, “but my parents… they won’t even let me see John anymore, and –”
“And for good reason,” John sighed. “You saw that adultery case in the papers. Two alphas, it was a right scandal. Greg’s already looked at funny for having a broken bond.” He bit his lip, and Sherlock watched worry crease his face. “Just go easy on him, ok? He’s just being affectionate, not sexual. He doesn’t see me like that. But if he needs a sniff of omega, I’m fine with that omega being me.”
“Simple, then. You know she’ll deny it.”
John hummed happily as they kissed, moving his legs apart just a touch, so Sherlock’s right leg could fall between them. Sherlock’s soft tongue pressed against John’s, neither of them caring that it was morning, both of them kissing back, languidly, as though they had all the time in the world. John moved his hands up over Sherlock’s arms, then down his back, over his pyjama top, to the hem, slipping his hands beneath.
“You will,” John said, helping his mate to stand. “I don’t believe in that rush of love mothers are meant to get. It doesn’t make sense. But you will fall in love with her. You’re going to be fantastic at it.”
John’s good intentions dried up in his mouth. “Hi,” he croaked out. “Come in, I’m just… finishing off.”
“Hello,” the lady with dark brown skin, Tabitha, smiled, and offered a hand to John. “It’s nice to put a face to a name.”
“Sorry,” John apologised. “Rogue thought. I meant to say, if he is a friend…” the words stuck in his throat.
“Shh,” Sherlock put a hand to the side of John’s head. “It’s alright, John. I know.”
His eyes widened, and he took a huge breath, shoving his chair back as he stood in shock, holding the paper, looking from it to John as though one of them might disappear.
John picked up his washbag, and closed the door behind him.
John’s hands went still, and he hesitated.
“Your I.D.,” Sherlock said, by way of explanation.
John grinned. “Of course she’s real.” He crawled closer, tucking the fluffy towel around them both. “God, look at her. Look at you. Look at what you did.” He touched her blood-slick head with a finger.
And then Sherlock was gone, down to his taxi, and Mycroft was double-locking the door. John felt strange. As if he was letting something painful go, but at the same time it was like ripping off a plaster – there was a wound underneath that was raw and unhealed.
“You smell wrong,” he said thickly. “Why do you smell wrong?”
Lestrade looked curious. ‘Do you love her? Like… like you’d love your own kid?’
“Just a moment, darling,” Molly looked back at Sherlock. “I’m sorry, I don’t recognise you, you must have made a mistake.”
say it
“Cam?” Sherlock looked so surprised John felt stupid, for a moment. “What about him?”
“You’re welcome, Lestrade,” Sherlock stood, wobbling. “I suppose I should go and face the music.”
“People have lain in worse.”
“Not precisely,” Sherlock said. “He did say I ought to make more of an effort…” he paused, as if thinking. “He… had some opinions.”
‘I…’ Sherlock hesitated, the thought of being put to the ground by Magnussen hitting his mind unpleasantly. ‘I know how to say
“No,” John said. “I…”
“Leave? I… I can’t, John, you…”
“But you still wanted to have his baby?”
“Sentiment will get you nowhere, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, coming out of the house behind him. “You’d rather leave her alive and injured?”
But he was past caring.
“Oh,” John blushed. “I wasn’t… saying you were.”
“We’re ok.” John smiled back, but behind his eyes his mind was ticking. There was something about Sherlock’s expectation that wasn’t quite right. Almost as though John’s refusal had been unthinkable.
John wondered if it was possible to will yourself into evaporating.
“You didn’t have to,” John stroked up Sherlock’s thigh, from knee to the curve of his bump. He placed a hand on the warmth, feeling the smallest movement beneath his touch. “I think you’re incredible. And you can do this, Sherlock. You can, I promise you. And nothing will change between us, unless it’s for the better.”
"I bet." John wrote something down. He glanced up at their oblivious teacher, and Sherlock got a hint of John's aftershave, escaping from his shirt. John shaved, every third day or so, though he could have gotten away with longer. He probably liked doing it. Sherlock understood that. Mycroft had caught him trying it, once. It had felt lovely. John used a wet razor, and some own-brand cream, and he went with the grain, because he had sensitive skin. And chapped lips, sometimes, though it didn't detract from his handsomeness.
Sherlock realised there was nothing loving or sexual in his look at all. He was seeing if Sherlock would
“Because you’re a good man,” John said evenly, glancing towards the door.
“I know,” John breathed. “I can grow it ou-”
John ruffled his hair. “Your body is yours, Sherlock. Only you can decide what to do with it, in my opinion. If you’re worried about it… we can see about you getting heat suppressants.”
“As long as we live,” Sherlock said.
“Fucking hell.” John shouted in horror, dropping his phone and the present. He threw himself at Sherlock, grabbing his wrist, forcing the knife away from him, wrenching it from his grasp.
"Enid Blyton special, yeah?"
“We don’t need to tell anyone. Anyone at all. Not really.”
Sherlock bit his own wrist, trying to hold back the cry of pain that always came at the start of their intercourse.
“That… that week?” Victor blinked. John could almost see the cogs grinding away in his head.
Sherlock felt himself smile. “Thank you.”
“Friends, is it?” Victor almost smiled.
“It shouldn’t be long,” John opened his laptop to order online. “Did you want to call anyone else? Use the internet? Watch TV? Read?”
*obviously offensive or triggering material will obv be tagged as soon as possible
‘Good.’ John knelt up, nudging Sherlock’s legs closed to sit in his lap, their cocks brushing over one another, then thrusting hard as John took them both in hand. John had a look on his face that made Sherlock want to scream – a sort of teasing certainty that he’d never seen on an omega’s face before.
“Thank you, Mrs Holmes.”
John had elected not to find out his baby’s sex. He wondered idly what would happen if he had a girl, and dressed her in blue. People would assume she was a boy, that’s what. He rolled his eyes, and picked up a multipack of white vests, some grey sleepsuits, a tiny hat, some scratch mitts, a snowsuit…
“Nothing. I just meant you’re young and healthy, and I’m sure you have a lot of admirers.”
His parents glanced at one another.
“Oh, I hardly think that’s necessary these days,” Sherlock teased back.
A kiss at the corner of his mouth. ‘Onto the bed, then.’
“I might,” John closed the fridge door. “Eating late, though. Might keep me up all night,” he grinned, and Sherlock grinned back, neither of them having to say the obvious come-back to that out loud.
They drove home from the hospital in relative silence, the radio playing some old music that didn’t ask anyone to sing along.
“You realise that won’t help if you’re continuing to attempt to hide it. Before, with a beta scent, you would have been assumed to be gaining weight, but now…” Mycroft sighed. “Have you told your employer, yet?”
And John realised why.
he was clever, until he went to school, did he?”
Greg hummed.
Eyre put her head on one side. “You have not sought to prosecute him for attacking you?”
His hands were shaking.
“Sure,” John smiled. “I’ll fetch a chair.”
John pressed his lips together, and leaned on the counter-top. “I’ve been thinking. Maybe this isn’t the best situation to bring up a baby.”
Sherlock nodded, and moved his hips a little.
“John would be an alphaless mother,” Mycroft repeated.
Sherlock shook his head. “I can’t.”
Sherlock sighed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “That you’re an alpha, a former soldier and trained doctor, lecturing at university.” He typed a few letters before adding: “They don’t know you’re
“Sherlock,” John said, “I’m never going to agree to it, you know? I don’t want to be turned, and I don’t want to be bound. I want to stay me.”
“When will he be back?”
Sherlock shook his head. ‘John would hate that. He has an appointment, next week, about going back on his suppressants. I’m not going to suggest we do something that would mark him as an omega forever.’
"Hey, are you free this weekend?"
Sherlock couldn’t speak. His jaw had gone stiff. His entire body was rooted to the floorboards, and he knew what was going to happen, even as it started happening, and he couldn’t move, didn’t want to move, didn’t want to not move, couldn’t remember how to breathe…
John watched him up, feeling very out of sorts. There was something not quite right about what Cam said about immaturity equalling childhood. If that was the case… then what about kids who matured young?
John looked at him, but Sherlock was buried in his book again, and clearly didn’t want to come out any time soon.
Mycroft would have an aneurism.
John had been on a school trip, and he was exhausted. The coach had broken down on the way back, and all the boys had had an impromptu game of football in the car park whilst it was fixed. Even John. The first game of sports he had played since the game of rounders. He’d cried off PE since that day, Siger providing him with a note, saying he was too delicate for sports. But, this time, he didn’t feel like sitting out. He joined in with the other lads, who were surprised but happy to have a fast lad on their team, and the journey back to school was much happier, with all of them swapping sweets and swigs of Lucozade.
“Yes, please.”
"You're up, then," John said awkwardly.
John lowered his swab. “Sherlock?”
“I want you to, now,” Sherlock said, surety in his voice. “Please. They’ll be gone, this time tomorrow, and… I want you to see.”
It did seem awfully difficult to deny that, now he thought about it… and the other night on the sofa… that magnetic draw towards John. How Sherlock had wanted their hands to come into contact, yet feared what would happen if they did. John had been the one to move away… but then he was an omega, even if he acted like a beta…
Which one was the real one? And which one might bite John, one day?
John looked at him.
The land-walker gave a sort of moan. Its face was still flushed red, and its penis was hard - it was definitely sexually stimulated. It hadn't used that refusal sound
“Ah!” Sherlock writhed suddenly as John rubbed over his prostate. Sherlock’s cock thrust up against John’s, which was now steadily leaking pre-come, making them both moan. “Oh, John. John, please. Please, do… something!”
Sherlock blinked.
sure about this? You’re not designed for it, it’ll probably hurt a lot.”
John hands are clenched on bunches of shirt and dressing gown, and Sherlock is holding him fast, like a dancer, like when they danced, in secret, behind closed curtains, and John had been so sure the sparks struck between their bodies were all in his mind.
John responded greedily, the grip he had on Sherlock’s wrists tightening, then releasing on one wrist as John’s hand moved to Sherlock’s throat, his clavicle, his buttons, popping two of them open to slip a warm hand inside, battle-roughened fingers grazing over the alpha’s nipple.
“So, this is it, then,” Sherlock sniffed. “Choose to stay alive, and never know you. Or never exist and spare myself this… this damn feeling.”
“But they’re not bonded?”
“He’s my –” Sherlock stopped.
The results were mixed.
Mycroft. Stupid, fat Mycroft. Gotten himself cornered.
“Yes. Carer, and sole recipient of wealth. If I am an omega, or a beta… Eurus gets everything, and will most likely die young and childless, which, apparently, would be terrible.”
“How nice of Sherlock to bring you along, though. Aren’t you lonely with no one to play with?”
“You’re cross-dressing, and you think you’re not deceiving anyone?”
He shook his head at himself. He shouldn’t be disappointed. He shouldn’t feel anything, really. He’d made the deal, and last time they’d come close to biting being on the cards...
Sherlock smiled back, and glanced behind himself, as if expecting cameras or parents to be lurking behind the trees.
John lowered his phone.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock,” he said softly, lunging for the stocking.
Sherlock saved him the worry by half-rolling into the water and sighing, apparently taking the initiative as he disappeared beneath the waves.
“Yes,” he reached for Sherlock’s hips and held his belt-loops for want of a better grip, thrusting up, chasing the hardness that Sherlock suddenly moved out of reach. “Sherlock!”
“I love you,” Sherlock murmured, touching the ejaculate on his skin with a soft curiosity.
He followed the nurse around the corner to a seat built onto some weighing scales. He perched on it, and watched the woman write the numbers down, before she took out a blood pressure cuff.
“I love you,” John said, when he was sure the pain had lessened. “I love you so much, Sherlock. This…” he put a hand gently on the painful bump, “this is our baby. Yours and mine. No one else’s. We made her. We made her in love, and passion, and belonging. Your mine, and I’m yours. The circumstances were anything but perfect, but no one else has claim to this baby. She’s ours. And I want her. I can’t wait to see her.”
“A couple,” she said, accepting the drink. “Sherlock, obviously. My mother. And I think my parents mentioned a few uncles and distant relatives. But no one I’ve been close to.”
“He’s cut his – his chest,” John didn’t know what else to say. Sherlock had cut himself, but he’d cut… god… “It’s really deep,” John said, crying. “I’ve got a towel over it and it’s bleeding through, god, please, it’s Somerset House on Trubride Road, please, god…”
The alpha in his grasp twisted free, and bared his teeth. “What is he to you, old man? Not your son, that’s for sure. Your servant? Your rent boy?”
He took a deep breath, and started typing.
Sherlock urged John's mouth to open, and the man obliged with a moan. John’s hands skittered from Sherlock’s arms to his sides and back again in tense confusion. The kiss deepened further, Sherlock possessing John’s mouth like it was his to explore, his tongue dragging to taste. Sherlock stepped forward until John was forced against the wall. The vampire gave a grunt of satisfaction as John's tongue worked its best against his. It wasn't languid, it was fast and unceremonious.
“I need you or Sherlock to sniff this,” John thrust the packet at him. “I think there’s some sort of ammonia-based agent in it.”
Mycroft grabbed a waste-paper basket and got it onto Sherlock lap just in time for him to heave into. He wasn’t sick, but the impulse was there for a minute or two, before he could talk again.
James draped a towel, warm from the radiator, around his shoulders. “How you feeling now?”
It was a low blow in what was a simmering, silent contention for dominance.
John would have hated it. Hated him, maybe.
"I can't imagine it'll taste like a fine wine, but I imagine it'll serve the purpose, John," Sherlock said with a twitch of amusement playing on his lips. "I'll be in the bunk. Take your time, please."
‘She’ll vomit,’ Sherlock said. He shut his eyes with the air of someone who is speaking from experience. ‘How are you feeling?’
“Maybe. See you.”
“Of course,” Sherlock let John embrace him, melting into his arms. “We shouldn’t be apart if we’re sleeping under the same roof for the first time.”
Sherlock turned to look at him. “John what’s wrong?”
“We pack,” Sherlock said. “We go home, to our real home, we move back in. We eat toast, and make tea, and have sex, and paint our baby’s room, and go to work and just… live. As happily as we can.”
Sherlock snorted. “Sure. That’s the end-all with you, isn’t it?”
“Oh, yes,” the doctor smiled. “Doing quite well, in the circumstances. Doctor Tanner reports that he’s stable, and, though we obviously can’t prevent the inevitable, he’s as comfortable as he can be.”
John’s pace quickened, his thrusts becoming firmer as his knot swelled, slipping in and out of Sherlock’s arse with the tiniest degree of difficulty. “Sherlock,” he forced out, “Do you want me to try – you have to tell me –”
Barely eight stones, and yet enough to flatten two of the bullies as he landed on them from a great height. Sherlock was up before they could register, grabbing the biggest boy by the throat and yanking him backwards with both hands. There were punches to Sherlock’s body and head, but he took no notice, dragging the largest to the floor and kicking him in side of the head. Someone yanked his arm, and that hurt, so he had to fight properly, then. Not with punches, as people did it films – that wasn’t how you hurt someone. Sherlock slammed into a boy with his shoulder, driving his elbow up into his ribcage, kicking out at another who was trying to grab his hair. They struggled, all of them together, hands and arms and legs and bites and god knows what else as they fought.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock admitted. “But I do know she hates herself as much as she hates you.”
It had taken months to get here, even after they moved to Baker Street.
John nodded. “Third year, yes. How did you guess?”
The legs paused, then Gregory Lestrade knelt down, sitting cross-legged on the tiled floor to look at John. He smiled nicely.
Warnings for: homophobia, transphobia, suicidal thoughts
John grabbed Jim by the shirt front and yanked him close. “Apologise,” he snarled, “or I’ll break your nose. Just fucking try me.”
John flushed the toilet. “It what?”
John hummed. “She knew about us.”
“Mycroft won’t tell me where you went. Why you stopped taking my calls. You…” John got out of bed, not caring he was naked, and pulled the package of letters from his drawer. “Look! I wrote to you every week for five years. They were all returned.”
“You’ve held onto this one for
“What are you talking about?” Sherlock raised a hand.
Sherlock came over, and put a hand to John’s arm. “John… what’s brought this on? You said you wanted to be a parent.”
The baby would probably look like the alpha who sired them. That hurt. There was nothing he could do about it, but it still hurt. He didn’t want reminding of that day. The only blessing had been that he’d conceived on the first… go. His heat hadn’t taken over him, and he’d had enough strength remaining to protect his neck with his arms. He ruined his shoulder doing it, so much that it still hurt, and his arms had been bitten to smithereens, but he hadn’t been bitten on the throat.
“They’ve had enough to deal with. And the rate things are going… they need a week whilst they can still have one.” Sherlock wanted to fold his arms, but also wanted to fall asleep on the examination bed opposite. It looked so comfortable.
John didn’t move. He could hear his heart hammering. The vampire could, too. Drum-beat to dinner.
“Oh my god,” Sherlock gasped, half-sobbing onto John’s chest as realisation and pleasure took him over. His arms gave way and he lay sprawled on John’s chest as the alpha gently fucked him with his fingers, bringing him to an orgasm so overwhelming that Sherlock cried, tears running down his face in relief and pleasure and love. “I want…” he forced himself to sit up, keeping John’s fingers lodged inside himself as he took hold of John’s cock in two hands. There was a tiny splatter of omega come on the shaft, but Sherlock ignored it, breathing heavily as he pumped John’s cock in his fists, moaning and shuddering as John gave his arse shallow fucks with his two digits, deep inside.
‘Mm.’
‘We were never together,’ John pulled his laptop back. ‘Not really.’
Sherlock covered his mouth as pleasure bloomed inside and outside him, John’s mouth moving to suck him, then, firmly, his tiny cock drawn into that hot mouth where it swelled, pleasure shooting up Sherlock’s body, dampening other places, which suddenly he felt were neglected.
Sherlock felt the land-walker shiver, though apparently not with cold. He looked carefully down at it, at its browny-pink skin, small blue eyes, and wet hair. He had discarded the land-walker's outer layers as soon as he discovered they were not its skin, but hadn't given much time to properly cataloguing it, yet. Still.
“Shitting hell,” John thrust against the hard heat on his cock, and back against that stretching penetration. “S’too much... want... god, Sherlock...” he rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, feeling the dull ache at his throat, and wanting it opened anew regardless.
The man glared down at him, and John’s smile slipped. “How old did you say he was?”
Sherlock stood, and John could see the thick outline of his cock, straining against his trousers. He gripped the bedclothes, his inner omega crying out in desire to have that obvious hardness inside.
things a lot more.”
“I know.”
"I told you," John said.
The days when John wasn’t fast enough running to his room. The days he had to put his uniform in the wash, or use the main bathroom, or even when he was tying his shoes for school. Siger would approach him from behind like a shark, grip John tight at the shoulders or arms, and hold him still as he scented him.
John looked over his face in the bathroom mirror. He raised a hand, and pushed his forehead up, just a touch, to erase the lines that had appeared over the past year. He let go, and watched them form again.
Lestrade leaned over, and started collecting the pieces of paper. John helped him, sweeping everything into the folder, and checking Sherlock wasn’t lying on anything. The detective inspector stood and stretched, whilst John gently reclined Sherlock’s bed, and covered him over with a blanket.
Sherlock pressed his mouth closed, and seemed to be thinking.
John put the bottle, a previously unopened gift from a client, back in the fridge. “One small glass, Sherlock. I’m not necking a bottle of vodka.” He shut the fridge door, and picked the glass up, walking over to the sofa with it.
John adjusted his knee-sock. “Guess alphas have it as shit as omegas, when you think about it like that.”
John looked back at the paper, and read aloud: “
you. Don’t you realise? I want to claim you and kill him at the same time, and it’s so…” he held a hand up, palm down. “I’m shaking, look. I can’t help it. I’m… dangerous, like this.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock nodded, pushing a lock of hair behind his ear. “That… that was nice, though. Thank you.”
“Please. I’ll have my one cup of caffeinated tea,” John smiled, watching James go, then caught sight of himself in the mirror – dishevelled hair, red blotchy face… there was nothing more like to put an alpha off than bodily functions. He snorted, and went to wash his face, wondering what Sherlock would have thought to all this.
“It’s ok,” John dropped down to look. “Ok, Sherlock… her head is out. She’s… god, do you want to see?”
“I don’t know,” John sighed. “My inner alpha might… look for you. Try and sit by you, regardless.”
“You will.”
‘No. No grip. Just go wash your hands. Thoroughly. Up to the elbows.’
Comforts at all, were all-but non-existent.
John didn’t know what to say.
John had not.
“You said boys get it too? What is it? She looked sick,” John asked, before he lost his chance.
“Oh god,” Sherlock laughed. “Don’t curse it!”
John suspected he was being insulted a little, but decided not to read into it. “You want me to come and look at a murder?”
“Hello, John,” the lady stood, and John realised she was an omega. The bite-mark on her neck was healed, but clearly visible. “Take a seat anywhere you like. I’m Mrs Rivers,” she offered a hand, and John shook it briefly, taking a seat a row back from the front.
John’s throat went tight. “Sherlock, if you tell me to get off you, I’ll get off you and leave you alone. I’m… you’re my best friend. I don’t look at you and see some omega I’ve got to test to see if they’re, I don’t know, good enough?! You’re just Sherlock, and that’s…” he punched the dirt. “That’s why I was hanging onto you.”
“But a half an hour,” John said. He slowed their skating, until they came to a stop, in the centre. He put a warm hand to Sherlock’s face. “You need to exist, Sherlock Holmes. You must.”
“This country’s laws dictate that omegas in heat cannot be raped,” Miss Ali went on, after a pause. “And we are not in a court to challenge that, however wrong we in this party believe that to be. However, we point out that Mr Watson was, undeniably, attacked. His injuries were life-changing – he was unable to continue to serve in the armed forces – and he has suffered psychological damage from both the attack and the pregnancy itself. But by finding a mate of his own, and building his own family, Mr Watson is well into recovery. He is a wonderful parent to Baby B, who we are told by her GP is thriving. He has a job, is engaged to be married, and it was fear, not malice, that forced him to withhold information about Baby B from Mr Mayhew. We submit to you that Mr Mayhew is a danger to Mr Watson, and to Baby B. We ask that Mr Mayhew is kept off the birth certificate of the child, and that a restraining order be put in place to ensure Mr Watson and his family’s future safety. Thank you.” Miss Ali and John sat down.
“He is.”
, he added, silently.
Life happens now in a series of scenes, of pauses between the manic changing-of-nappies or the frantic happiness that comes from a baby learning to crawl. Life happens now in those quiet moments of soft sleepiness, or waiting rooms outside solicitors’ offices and waiting for important brown envelopes to arrive. Life for Sherlock is now punctuated by bursts of events that demand his attention but are only borrowing it for a while.
Sherlock did so, tucking the tissue paper in, and pushing his trousers down so John could just see a few curls of dark hair. “Is that far enough?”
Sherlock reached towards the pictures. John watched his eyebrows rise, and his mouth open, just a little. “Oh…”
Sherlock came back with two cups of caffeine-free tea and a ready baby bottle, which Birdie accepted with a happy ‘hmm’ sound as she snuggled into John’s chest.
He squeezed until he heard the creak of bones and the quickening of James' breath. The man released Sherlock’s clothes and pulled his arm free, immediately swinging a fist at Sherlock. Sherlock took the hit on the jaw like a feather-touch. Then, quicker than John or James could comprehend, Sherlock had the major by his neck, his feet dangling from the ground.
And in bed that night, his heart carned out from his chest, Sherlock still couldn’t decide whether he had said it, or John.
“Use whatever words you need to use, John.”
“I might feel like it upstairs, though,” the alpha added. “If you wanted to find out.” He trotted up the staircase and disappeared.
“You’re only fifteen, Sherlock, dear. I doubt you’ll have to worry about that for a few years –”
Sherlock nodded, red in the face, cock throbbing in his underwear. His hands were gripping the bedclothes tight, and his jaw was clenched, the only indicator that he was trying very hard, this time. Sometimes, it was easy for him. But he’d had a lot of cases recently, and it had been a while since John had taken charge so firmly, and it was
John leaned down, and closed their mouths together as Sherlock reached into the bedside drawer for the lubricant. He opened his eyes at the sound of the bottle being uncapped. He kissed Sherlock again, and smiled. “Let me?”
John felt the firmness of the alpha’s decision, and decided not to fight against it. If Sherlock was saying ‘no’, he couldn’t exactly sneak off, alone. He didn’t even know where Eurus was. He snuggled against Sherlock, backwards, against his chest. “What about your mum?”
Sherlock looked perfectly fine.
Uh, gross.
“Sherlock, go to the office!”
“Yeah?” James grinned. “Then why don’t you ask John what happened the night after his passing-out parade?”
‘We were at his house,’ Sherlock said to the waste-paper basket. ‘Alone. And I… I did something. Gave him some sort of signal – not on purpose! I swear, Mycroft, it wasn’t on purpose, but I… I made him…’
A firm hand at his hip stopped him.
John stared. “I… our baby…”
And slept with his gun under his pillow.
“Is Sherlock with you?” John asked.
Sherlock turned, then, hooking his legs over John’s, and then round again so he was sitting in his lap, John leaning against the bed, Sherlock’s legs kicking out beneath it as they kissed on the lips, properly, Sherlock’s arms around John’s neck.
"It can hardly be called a war if the people you were murdering weren't able to fight back, but as you please. You admit to all the charges?"
“There is nothing wrong with you!” John leaned back to lift Sherlock’s chin and look him in the eye. “Listen to me, I know what I’m saying. There’s nothing wrong with you, Sherlock Holmes. You’re you, and you’re unique, and if you’re a couple of years outside average, well, that just makes you more special.”
‘Both?’
“I thought you were supposed to be a detective?” John teased, from his position kneeling on the floor.
“I thought about it, but I didn’t want to disturb you.”
“Christ,” he caught himself and put a hand to his chest. “Sorry. Head in the… What’re you doing here?”
“Hold me,” John whispered. “Please.”
‘Hormones,’ his dad mouthed at his mum as John sulked through another family dinner.
Cannot overstate the warning for this one, do not put yourself at risk by reading if this is at all triggering to you.
Maybe because he only wanted Sherlock for kissing. He couldn’t offer him anything else.
“That had better not be your proposal.”
Winter came, and the Christmas holidays with it. John was sitting in the window-seat of the lounge, pretending to read. Really, he was waiting for Sherlock to come home from boarding school. It was a dry December, of the sort that chills your bones, and John had his sleeves pulled down over his hands as he held his book.
“They’re children,” John’s mum said in an even tone. “They’re friends. It’s a sleepover, and both Jack and I would be in the house.”
“I don’t want to not exist,” he said. “I don’t wish I’d never been born. I want you to fix it. John… please…”
“Ah.” Sherlock looked away. “Don’t they mess you up?”
“Sherlock, you know I –”
“John…” Sherlock sniffed, snuggling into his alpha’s shoulder and neck, inhaling the scent of him. Woodsmoke and orange chocolate and masculinity. Sherlock could feel John’s hard cock pressing against his stomach, against his own erection, and he wanted to rock himself to climax right there. Why not?
The judge banged her gavel, then, and the noise died down as Siger and his solicitor took their seats. “Order, if you please.” She put some reading glasses on her nose. “The case this morning is to decide the future guardianship of Omega John Hamish Watson. Alpha William Sherlock Scott Holmes is bringing the case, with Alpha Siger Augustus Mycroft Holmes in defence.”
John lowered his hand. “You know what I’m saying.”
John screamed, and thrashed like a salmon, trying to bite, trying to shake Sherlock off. Sherlock spun him around, and raised a fist.
For some extra fun, compare chapter eleven with Sherlock's memories of what happened.
“You were going to tell me when Lestrade came over,” Sherlock pressed his hands against his eyes. “Oh god. Oh…” his hands dropped. “That was your appointment. That’s why you were sick. I’m… I’m such an
“What happened to Eurus?” John asked. His eyes were closed, and he was back on a drip for fluids and painkillers. He badly needed to sleep, but his skin was aching through missing his baby. It was as if she was still attached to him by some invisible cord, and he could sense her, even on the floor above.
When John neared thirty, he realised his arrangement was likely to be fulfilled. He checked the name of his backup with his parents, and even found a flat with a second bedroom (omegas liked their own space, even if they were going to share a bed). He knew the protocol – someone would deliver his mate to his den, and that would be the end of it. There’d be mating and bonding, and John would have a mate for the rest of his life.
. Clinical.
“You got a mum and dad?”
“That was an experience,” Sherlock said, when they were finally dismissed. He was carrying a bag full of the leaflets and equipment and toys John had been given on the way out.
And now there was one coming to stay in the barracks.
“No, not… I don’t know if… It’s so small,” John whispered.
“You’re getting it,” John said, which sounded like praise. He asked for the pencil, holding his hand out to make his meaning clear, and Sherlock handed it over. John turned to another clean page, and wrote several definite, large marks, before turning the page for Sherlock to see. It didn’t follow a pattern, but looked intricate and pleasing, and Sherlock was about to nod at the land-walker’s efforts when John pointed to the marks.
talk a lot about babies and food technology and household accounting. Out of all of Sherlock’s classmates, he only knew one other omega who was interested in going on to higher education. He wondered if Molly knew she needed a sponsor.
John nodded in thanks. “Did you get her?”
Sherlock nodded, and let himself out of the office.
John smiled. “That’s nice.”
John shrugged.
“What do you want?”
“Yes.” Sherlock hesitated, then came over as well, fetching mugs out of the cupboard. “But I would rather have them now, than… later.”
Sherlock went red. “Is that bad?”
Craig folded his arms. “He walked into the girls toilets, and that’s the best you can come up with? That was yesterday.” He said it as though it was a million years ago. Maybe, in school-life terms, it was.
Greg sipped his tea. “Seems to me that that’s an obstacle he could get over. Yeah, it seems like a huge deal, at first. A fallen – sorry, sorry, a single parent,” he looked apologetically at John, “but one who is obviously a nice man, clever, and you’re their friend… I don’t know if it’s such a big leap to think maybe… you could get over it.”
Heads up for mentions of breastfeeding, and ongoing hospital stuff.
“I met one,” John snapped. “An omega army doctor. I met him, at a recruitment evening.”
"Yeah, it is," John said. "They like the medical staff to use it, in case we have to leap into action."
“See you later,” John said. “Don’t fall asleep in the bath.”
“That’s sick!” John said. “That’s… if I have a baby, it’s my baby first. If I’m growing it, it’s mine.”
“So you met at work? How nice!”
John sheepishly draped it over one arm. “It was cool this morning.”
“Don’t be,” Sherlock put a hand to John’s face, and turned it. “You’re you.”
Sherlock covered his face and laughed, fighting back happy tears. “John, stop it!”
Mycroft puffed out a breath that seemed relieved. “I see.”
“Do you miss your sister?”
“I…” he tried to remember how to speak. “I… did this.”
“Hey,” John said.
When John was fifteen, he presented as an omega, and had his first heat. He was disgusted with himself. His parents were shocked. His sister was shocked. His teachers, neighbours, friends were shocked. No one would ever have guessed that John Watson, who played rugby and was on the cycling team, who had no talent for the arts or music… was an omega.
“Take care,” James said, holding the door open for him, and standing rather rigidly as John squeezed past him and clattered down the steps to the road.
John went still.
They were silent, for a moment.
“I thought she was me,” John said. “In another life. But… She’s just her. I’d never do anything like that, to anyone. I’m not like her. I thought I was, but I’m not. I thought we were the same, because of what happened to us. But… I don’t… We’re not. I could never hurt someone like that. Even if I hated them. I’m not her, after all.”
“You broke his collarbone, apparently,” Victor rolled his eyes. “He’s going to be in a fashionable compression vest for a few weeks. Very attractive.”
“No one,” Sherlock said. “I just know.”
John smiled. “I know. Thank you, for not keeping things from me.”
John had to stand up, and walk away. He went over to the cake display, and stood for a moment, trying not to scream.
It had to be said, Sherlock knew. But, for the first time, he found himself begging a god he didn’t believe in for more time.
“You’re the most special person I’ve ever known,” Sherlock said, looking down at John. “You really are. I’m so lucky to have you here, in my arms.”
It was still early, by the standards of the average Friday night, but 221B Baker Street was dark, and quiet. The clock on the mantle ticked – the second-hand going the wrong way after Sherlock had tinkered with it and put it back together in too much of a hurry. Beside a collection of impaled butterflies, a single letter sat, torn open, the contents read and re-read several times, and still to be digested. More letters – this time with an address penned with military precision – were stacked on the desk against the wall. Around one half of them were still to be read, their contents sealed up against the years.
“Cuffed?” John stopped in his tracks. “Is… she a prisoner?”
“Forever, love.”
Sherlock stared. “I don’t know, John. I can’t answer that. I can only say I missed you so terribly I had to stop thinking of you or else go mad.”
Sherlock huffed in agreement, and John smirked.
“Nothing’s going to happen that you don’t want,” Sherlock said.
He looked at the body again.
“It’s not wrapped, I’m afraid,” the man Cam was saying. “I’m not good at that sort of thing. But, the case does need opening.”
“Thanks for going out,” John gave him a smile. He took the toast out, and cut it into soldiers, plain, no butter. “You didn’t have to.”
He got into bed, and pulled the covers over his head, and stayed there for the rest of the day.
A lot of the omegas in Sherlock’s intake were uncertain about the amount of freedom they suddenly seemed to have. If they wanted to learn to paint, the school would arrange it. If they wanted to go into the snow-blanketed forest and take photographs, someone would go with them. If they wanted to stay in the school and study forensic science, this would also be encouraged. It was a strange place to be – the omega students were not refused anything, within reason, but they were not permitted to leave the supervision of the staff. It felt to Sherlock like a fancy prison, where there were guards but no bars on the windows.
“John?”
Victor pressed a hand to his mouth. His eyes were shining with fresh tears.
“Because it looks to me like you’re just shredding it. I haven’t seen any of it make it to your mouth, yet.”
“Sherlock… if he does get kicked out… what do you think to maybe… us being… out?”
Mycroft blushed, too, and the Holmes’s looked at one another in apparent amazement.
“You don’t have to swear anything,” Sherlock said softly. “You just have to take this at your own pace. If - if
And, in the end, it was no decision at all.
John rolled his eyes. “Sherlock, I’m a doctor. I’ve seen worse than that.”
“Mm?”
“Enough is enough,” he said, sitting John and Sherlock down in the lounge. “As fun as this festive season has been, you are not squatting in my flat. John, you are welcome to stay as long as you need, but Sherlock – what is happening with Baker Street?”
John knew it was grief, making Mycroft Holmes angry. But he couldn’t stand there and take it. ‘This,’ he said softly, ‘was inevitable. If not tonight, then tomorrow, or the next day. Sherlock is dying. I do not have the skills to make him better. No one does. I’m sorry.’
They drove the rest of the way home in silence.
“I’ll do it later.”
“You know what I mean. A… pregnancy doctor.”
“I’ve not been honest.” John put a hand to his stomach. Pressing the fabric against himself, Sherlock could see the curve of him better, and it made him feel very strange. “I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.”
Sherlock nodded. They collected their things, and walked around to the bike sheds. John got his bike out, and Sherlock got on the back, on the seat, hanging onto the saddle’s edge as John pedalled them away from school.
“Oh fuckkkk,” John breathed, gripping Sherlock’s shirt tight. “Sherlock – Sherlock, this is a public dressing room – someone could pull back the curtain – oh
“Wants to make sure you’re safe.”
“No,” Sherlock almost smiled. “Just stay here. Talk to me?”
Tabitha cleared her throat. “And where is home, John?”
Sherlock looked right at John, and John looked back.
“A clerical error, perhaps?”
“Girls aren’t always omegas, though,” Molly said.
It wasn’t the smartest idea, John knew. He wasn’t stupid. This could go very sour very quickly. But, with any luck, he’d be out of the place in a few weeks, and somewhere... else. If anyone would have him. Really, his options were to live alone, or to try his sister. And she wasn’t exactly the sort of person John would choose to live with.
John smiled, sadly.
The nurse hesitated.
“I will find you another doctor.”
Mycroft’s nostrils flared, and his eyes flicked to John before he nodded, and went out of the room.
“I’m not really interested in the missed lecture,” Sherlock interrupted again. “I hardly think it’s relevant.”
John held it out of reach. “Sherlock – fuck off – I’ll crack this over your head, I mean it –”
“What for?” John pulled him close.
Violet dabbed at her eye with a handkerchief before smiling back down at them. “Apologies. Now… last night, Dr Watson, you said you’d be… happy. To wait for Sherlock to mature.”
Content warning for violence, and a lot of it.
‘It’s not powerful,’ Sherlock said. ‘It’s terrifying. The only thing stopping them proposing me is manners, and the fact I’m with my mother. That’s it.’ He brought John’s hand up, and kissed it. ‘I just want you. And I’d wait for as long as it took.’
They looked at one another, over the table, crumbs and cooling tea between them.
‘It was a mistake, I didn’t think before I acted,’ Sherlock said. ‘It doesn’t matter.’
, as Eurus had once said he would be. He had found it, it seemed, with Sherlock. Sherlock, the alpha with a kind heart, the one who kept John safe, who warmed him at night, who drew pleasure from his body. The alpha who didn’t push him for a family, who had encouraged him to study… but wasn’t willing to make the final step, and let John go, and be what he was – in his mind – born to be.
“I remember saying it,” John said. “I don’t remember meaning it.”
“Yes, if you’d rather Mummy didn’t come.”
John felt the urge to clear his throat. He ignored it, and spoke through the choke, instead. “When can I try eating?” He sounded like an eighty year-old
Sherlock’s kisses were trailing, now, over John’s cheek, hot breath over his ear, and down to his throat…
Sherlock’s mouth snapped shut.
Sherlock reached across the table, and put one of his hands over both of John’s.
“Yeah, well. We’ll get in trouble.”
“Will do.” John let Sherlock out, and followed him, hailing a cab to get to his shift at the walk-in centre.
“Um… bye,” he said. “Have – have a good time?”
John nodded.
“There you have it, then. Get them to look deeper. For tiny bits of shrapnel that don’t add up.” Sherlock shut his eyes. “That’s it. He was meant to die. Remains to be seen if the other man was a bystander. Might not have been. Would take some… investigating. Private life. Stuff.” He was drifting. His fingers were twitching on the sheets.
“A pop quiz, then. Let’s see which blooms you can identify.” He offered his arm.
‘They’ll wonder where we’ve gone,’ John said as they dashed up the stairs to Sherlock’s almost-empty bedroom. ‘They’ll come looking.’
“What?”
John’s eyes shone. “But what’s going to happen?”
“No one can explain Mycroft,” Sherlock smiled, and John had to smile, too. “Are you done with your cards?”
Sherlock’s first heat lasted only two days, but it was two days John wouldn’t forget in a hurry.
“Sherlock, I feel like I need to say sorry,” John said, quickly. “I – I saw, when I was trying to mop you up… I know you wouldn’t have wanted me to see, so I’m sorry.”
“I already have one.”
Jim grinned triumphantly. “Yes.”
“No,” John shook his head. “No, I’m not. I don’t want them to know. But Molly already figured it out, and she’s not the sharpest stick, bless her. She is an omega, though. That should give her an edge. Why have you never gone out with her?”
John took a seat at the breakfast bar.  “It’s hard, ok?” He could still hear water running in the bathroom. “People think we’re a couple all the time. Even right at the start. And they’re going to keep thinking it. And I think… I keep thinking that if it bothered him, he’d say something. He’s not exactly known to mince his words, is he.”
Sherlock went still. “You’re afraid of me.”
“I take an after-heat pill every time,” Sherry shrugged. “I don’t very much care that they mess with my fertility. I have no urge to breed or pass on my genetic makeup. In my opinion, it would be better if the Holmes line dies out completely, but if anyone was going to breed, Sherlock was the safest option,” he looked at John’s stomach. “Sherlock always was the most normal.”
“You know what I mean… everyone is stupid. I find that if I adopt certain characteristics, people stop trying to scent me, or stare me into somehow presenting. Depending on the circumstances, and the gender of the opposite party, it can work rather well.”
“No,” Sherlock panted. “Just  - just go slow. I can…” he winced, gripping the pillow under his head in two hands. “Ow.”
“He probably knows. And if he doesn’t, telling him might put him off. I’d rather he just bit me and it at least happened. I’ll have that memory, at least.”
“John –” Sherlock reached for him.
“I don’t,” Sherlock said. “I liked holding hands, but I like you just as a friend. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock looked at him. ‘You know?’
“You can express,” the nurse said, smiling. “We can arrange that straight away.”
“Why don’t I order a selection, and you can try things and find out what you like?”
'Seem to do so, yes. It gets close to a debate and then it gets pushed away again. Someone has too much influence, if you ask me.'
He ran a hand over his body, feeling the softness, the slightly damp and sweaty skin from his fight with the binder.
“Mycroft,’ John said in surprise as he opened the door. “Sherlock isn’t in, sorry, Greg’s taken him out to play.”
And then –
Cam, at least, was ignoring Violet’s discomfort in favour of further questions. “Are there many male omegas in your family, Violet?” He asked, taking her glass from her and topping it up.
And, just like that, John knew that their relationship would, eventually, come to an end. It had been too much to hope for, really, that they would be a family at the end of all this. That John and Sherlock and Baby would make three. No, it would be John and Baby. And Sherlock. Separate. Supportive, no doubt, but apart. Un-associated with the tiny family John would have made. It would not, could not, ever be anything else.
Sherlock nodded. “He’s a beta. We… struck up a friendship…” he looked up, guilt washing through his features. “Oh god, we…”
‘See if you can see a baby’s head,’ John said, putting his hands over his face.
Sherlock took his hand.
John took a shuddering breath. “Siger Holmes scented my neck when I was twelve. He… he put his arms around me, and held me close, and fast. I was only little. He held me so tight, like he wanted to snap me in half, and he scented me, right down my throat. I hadn’t matured, I was still just a kid, and he scented me like you’d scent a lover. And he was the first person to do that to me. My parents never did, because they were betas, and I knew it was special, and I knew Sherlock would do it, one day, but he’d never be my first.” John pressed the heels of his hands into his wet eyes. “And it wasn’t just once. He did it whenever he could. Sometimes I wouldn’t be fast enough getting my shoes on, and he’d…” he looked up, inhaling sharply. “He’d get me at the back of the neck, and push me onto the floor, and scent at my throat with his weight on top of me.”
“At school,” John shrugged. “And when the other omega lads talk about alphas… they don’t sound like you. You don’t sound like them. And I’m glad.”
“I love you,” John thrust his hips up, and Sherlock let out a cry. John snarled possessively, holding Sherlock still as he drove up again, his aching cock stretching Sherlock’s depths and sending fiery pleasure over the both of them.
A sick suspicion bloomed under John’s skin.
“I know what that is.”
John – John! – reached into his own jacket. “Here. Take mine.”
But then, the creature spoke again, making more of the noises that sounded more song-like than speech. It pointed at John with a finger, and said something else as John began to shiver. A growing thought blossomed into John’s mind. Had... had it been keeping him warm? How could he ask?
“Oh god,” John smiled. “Seriously? Didn’t it… hurt?”
On the flight back, John took the sedative Mycroft gave him, and slept the entire way.
John stared. “…yeah. Fine. I heard their heartbeat. The baby’s.”
“Let me help you,” John gently lifted him into a better position and adjusted the cushions. In his arms, Sherlock felt very thin. “Better?”
John nodded, waiting for the inevitable questions.
“It’s not a case of them not wanting to,” John sighed. “They simply aren’t able to process it as wrong. They’ll fight tooth and nail – I’ve seen newly bonded omegas with terrible wounds, and torn bites – right until the bond happens, and then nature forces them to submit. It isn’t something I’ll condone. And nor should you.”
“Oh, for god’s sake… Can we get a DNA done, or something?”
“Because I’m not –”
He found it.
“That’s not an issue,” Greg shrugged, “it would just count towards your hours. You’d be better off, financially. Pension, benefits, that sort of thing?”
His bump pressed against the cold cabinet.
That’s all it could be.
He checked himself in the mirror. He looked the same, but anyone with a nose would know he was a mated man. He had a mate – a stunning, perfect omega, whom he would do anything for. Would die for, if asked. He had loved Sherlock for a long time, but this surpassed love.
Sherlock hummed, and followed John to the changing room. “I’ll give him a date to move out. He’ll be going to his parents’ for Christmas, anyway.”
Tabitha looked at John. “And John? Were you consenting to bond with Sherlock?”
“Not really… I just… I don’t know him very well.”
“Almost as much as I miss you when I have to go home,” John stroked down his chin. “And that’s a lot, by the way.”
Joseph shrugged. ‘It’s just sex, at the end of the day. You don’t have to enjoy it, just get on with it.’
John looked away. “Nothing. I… I brought it on myself.”
Sherlock swallowed a cry that was threatening at his throat. “He…. He’s going to be devastated.”
John was deployed to Afghanistan two weeks later.
“What else would you call this?!” John shouted. Then tried to gather himself. “I’m going to… I don’t know. Can’t sleep, can I?”
Mycroft pursed his lips. “Rules?”
“John –”
“Look after me?”
Guilt wormed around John’s stomach. He liked Greg. Not like
John shook his head. "Hardly any. He barely talks to me, and we work together. But he doesn't ignore them, if they open a conversation. He's not unsociable... Just... Shy."
"Pay?" Sherlock didn't look up.
Lucy saved them by waking up and promptly making a noise like an angry goose.
Sherlock didn’t make the face again, but he thought about it. “A whole week?”
John Watson was no longer that frightened little boy.
Sherlock rolled into his embrace, and assumed the position of the little spoon. John curled around him, holding him close, knees against the backs of knees.
Someone clinked a glass, loudly. “Five minutes, everyone!”
“Was what?” John put his head slightly on one side.
The film’s hero was suddenly different.
“Well… Happy Birthday, John,” Sherlock brought the cake, with sixteen candles on, over so John was close enough to blow. “Make a wish?”
It was clear that the conversation was over.
“I know,” Mycroft said, looking somewhat tense on the doorstep. “It is actually you I wish to speak to.”
“I’m going to miss you,” John said, looking Sherlock in the eyes. “Maybe... if I ever get leave, and you’re not out solving crimes...”
Sherlock stared at the paper, his eyes wide, lips parted slightly. He reached out, and touched the drawing with gentle fingers.
“You implied as much. I love your brother, Mycroft. He’s my mate. He made me happy, back when I had nothing. And he’s chosen someone else, thanks to you. He hates omegas, now. You can see it in his face. He hates me, because of what I am. If you’ve told him that, you’re just as bad as your father.”
“Fuck off,” John held a bowling ball up threateningly. “I’m not here to discuss my personal life.”
He had to say.
Sherlock hesitated.
, to be exact.
“No, but you are an omega,” Sherlock said. “That’s why we’re engaged. Because I’m an alpha.”
“Yes, you did,” John said. “Victor, if we all have to live by the mistakes we made when we were sixteen, the world would be a very grim place.” He shook the alpha’s hand. “Good luck.”
‘Fine, are you?’
Cam returned, looking confused at Mycroft standing. “Office called you away?” he asked.
And fell into Sherlock’s arms.
“Sure.” Sherlock reached into the bedside drawer, and took out a tube squeezed half-empty.
“How would you know?” Sherlock shot back. “You’ve never fucked an omega in heat, have you?”
Sherlock leaned against the wall, breathing hard, chest rising and falling too fast.
“Yes, that’s true. But…” Sherlock turned onto his side, so he and John were face to face. “I don’t want what’s happened to me to stop us being friends.”
Eurus smiled, as if John had showered her with compliments. “You can think,” she said. “You can. Such a shame.” She cocked her head to one side.
“Sherlock?”
“Oh, god!” John parted his legs without thinking about it, feeling another gush of slick pour out of him into the bathwater, mixing and clinging to his soaking clothes. He whined, feeling his insides throb, this time with emptiness, and there was another rush of slick as he cried out.
Sherlock went on. “The truth is... I'll be quite sorry to leave, today. You're one of the few humans I've met who haven't repulsed me. I've enjoyed my time with you. That said, I think it's better if I go. I'm..."
Sherlock’s steps faltered.
Sherlock tightened the suction of his mouth, and pulled off, pressing his lips together as John’s cock slipped wetly from his mouth, and letting it penetrate his mouth again, with enough resistance to make John grip his hair tight at the feeling.
For the first time at John’s touch.
“That I’ll have a heat in the P.E. changing rooms or something, where there’s a load of alpha boys,” Sherlock went red.
It was over way too quickly.
“We won’t,” Sherlock said, taking the key. “Thank you.”
"Why?"
A silence followed for a long few moments. John yawned, before speaking again. "What happened to the woman who betrayed you?"
John, alpha-less and alone, had stripped naked, and dragged the covers off the bed as he bent double, trying to ride out the empty cramping inside himself, eventually giving in to sinking three fingers inside himself, wailing in fright at how loose his entrance felt, how hot his skin was, how wet he was.
be mistaken for a couple. You are even beginning to smell alike due to your proximity. If he wishes for you to be in a relationship, as much as I worry about the idea, it would be a logical and safe conclusion to the matter. To continue to maintain this friendship with no acknowledgement of the scandal…” he stopped.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It’s bigotry,’ John snapped. ‘And that omega rights bill they’ve been on about for years has been pushed back again. It’s like people with their own interests – and they must be sick ones – don’t want omegas to have the same rights as everyone else. Why would you deny someone that? It’s disgusting.’ He stood, and picked his bike up. ‘I’m going home.’
“You want your career,” Sherlock said. “You want to be a doctor, and you made it clear that that was what you wanted the most.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking,” Sherlock said, staring at him, eyes flicking to the unbroken skin on the man’s neck, his ring-less hands, his greying hair. “Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end... would that be a problem?”
“Perhaps it’ll spark something in me,” Sherlock quipped, but there was a tiny tremor in his voice. “There’s time yet.”
“Oi.”
"I said I had a type. Not that you weren't it," Sherlock said lowly. His mouth was practically watering. He really shouldn't indulge. It was such a distraction, and he had already overstepped the mark. But he could control it, if he had to.
Horror ran through his veins.
“We’d have it more often if it didn’t mean a week of sulking, afterwards,” Sherlock rolled his eyes as John settled on top of him, chasing the shape of his cheekbones, nose, lips and mouth with a fingertip. Trying to memorise him.
“Yes. He tried to contact me, several times, afterwards. I refused to see him, fled the city, the country – it was easy to disappear in those days. And I left him. It was incredibly irresponsible of me. He had no one to teach him how to behave, how to stay safe, any of it. I thought there was a good chance he was dead.”
“Let’s get you some photos printed whilst we clean you up…”
‘Ok, so let me ask you this – did you kiss them, or did they kiss you?’
Perhaps it would all be alright, after all.
John frowned, just a touch. “Right. Ok. It’s only for a few weeks, you know? Until I get someone where permanent?” He was making that up. He needed a permanent place. But he didn’t want it to be with an alpha. Omega. Omega afraid.
Sherlock glanced over. “It’s alright, I can let you in.”
Sherlock shook his head. “You don’t need to be sorry. I would never force you to be anything else. Your life is your own, and I’m just grateful you want to share some of it with me. I shan’t be the one to walk away from this, but neither shall I blame you if you are the one to do it.”
“…how?”
Harry shrugged. “More than omegas, that’s for sure.”
“At least tell me he’s pulling his weight with this happy news?”
“I know, it’s ok.” John stood to take his turn. “I get why you asked. Just… trust me, ok? When I say that it’s not the right time.” He picked up the bowling ball. “And Ryan, one of the alphas over there has his eye on you. Watch your back, eh?”
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I can hardly take a twelve year old to university. John is still at school.”
“Hard?” John teased.
John tossed the old dressings into the bin, and glanced at Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock pulled away to swallow and gasp for air, wiping his chin as he looked up at John, who looked shaky yet aroused, his face flushed pink, arms tense.
When the helicopter did arrive, it was turned off for refuelling and John and Sherlock stood facing each other, their eyes meeting.
Cam shrugged. “It’s only money, Sherlock. It can’t buy you happiness, but it can bring you some small pleasures.”
‘Then take me somewhere I can be loud,’ Sherlock scoffed in a murmur. ‘Please,’ he added.
“Eurus said that to me,” he went on, “years ago, when Sherlock first got into uni. She said you’ll never see us more than wombs, and she was right.”
“You look adorable,” John grinned, clicking his phone yet again.
Everyone else was consumed by the fire, the shrapnel, the bursts of leaded death that cut through the dry heat of the desert.
‘Sherlock!’ his parents darted over as John turned his drip up higher. ‘Sherlock, it’s alright…’ His mother took his hand again, and Sherlock shut his eyes, his chest heaving.
Cam snatched at his sleeve. “Think about it,” he said. “You need to be careful, Sherlock. You must remember – they can’t help themselves. But you can stop them. You have to watch your own back.”
“Sherlock… that wasn’t a girl,” John said, carefully. “That was you.”
John dropped his hands, which had been creeping up to Sherlock’s face, back down to the tops of his arms. “What… what for?”
John sat, quiet and sad, as he lowered his arm.
John read the message three times. It made him feel very strange. Sherlock felt lucky to know him? That didn’t make sense. John wasn’t anything special. He was doing nothing but causing trouble for everyone. And what was Sherlock still doing awake?
John looked at the tablecloth. As much as it hurt his omega heart, he knew Mycroft was right. Eurus couldn’t look after a baby.
John couldn’t imagine Sherlock buying it. It seemed completely out of the question.
John adjusted his clothes, managing to smooth over his bump as he did so. “It’s… look, I’m sorry –”
John gasped. “But…” he dropped a hand to his navel. “Sherlock, I could be…”
“I can’t quite fathom that she lives here…” Sherlock put a hand on the gate.
They looked at each other.
“That’s good,” John scratched the hair at the back of his skull. “Sorry, I hope I’ve not made you… nervous.”
“This is your warning. Shoes tomorrow, or you’re on report. Now, copy your timetable down, please.”
John swung the bat.
a nasty voice hissed, in his head.
, John thought.
“Sherlock was
“Yes.”
“You don’t have to –” John started to protest again, but James was already out the door. John sighed, and half sat, half leaned against one of the tall barstools. He
Mr Thorne looked as shocked as if Sherlock had slapped him. ‘Sherlock… I didn’t hurt him. I’m not proud of – of cheating, but I certainly didn’t abuse Joseph in any way.’
“Detective Inspector G. Lestrade,” Sherlock read. Then looked up. “You’re the police.”
‘I don’t know,’ John said. His eyes were shut again. ‘Does it look bad?’
“Oh. Yes…” Sherlock looked at the photos in his lap. “I mean, I don’t mind, if you wanted to…”
“And the gym,” John passed over the fancy cups for the tea.
John gasped as a new sensation washed over him.
They were all gathered in the living room, John next to Sherlock on the sofa, Mycroft leaning on the mantelpiece, Greg Lestrade sitting nervously in one of the armchairs. It was a couple of days after John’s tearful outburst, and though he didn’t feel any better for it, he felt a fraction closer to Sherlock, who hadn’t made an attempt to touch or hug John more than John had initiated. They had continued to text on and off over the few days apart, but now, with Lestrade delivering bad news, John found himself huddling against the alpha, gripping onto his sleeve. Sherlock patted his hand, gently.
There was a nasty silence.
Mycroft looked as though he was rolling the information around his head. ‘Can you tell me
“And,” she was saying, “you and John will be able to –”
A nod.
There was, of course, no guarantee he was pregnant. Heats aside, his fertility could likely be fucked from all the drugs he’d pumped into his system. But if he was fertile… lots of sex during heat…
“You don’t have to kill them,” Sherlock sighed, ignoring the two deaths he had caused that evening. “You really don’t.”
“The problem, Sherlock, is you are a very attractive young man, regardless of your gender. You’re asking alphas to wait for a chance to mate with you, but a lot of them, Greg Lestrade isn’t alone in this, let me assure you, a lot of them just want to be with you because you’re
Sherlock sobbed, again, and grabbed hold of John’s hand.
“You are, though,” John said softly. “You really are.”
“No, he leaves early, but he never says no to cake.” Sherlock plated up the breakfast food, pouring orange juice into a jug and putting butters and jams and marmalade’s he’d presumably bought on the way to the bakery on the table.
Sherlock glowered at him before vanishing.
“I want this,” Sherlock insisted, arching his back. “Please…”
“He escaped, I guess?”
John stood, quickly following him out of the kitchen, up the stairs, to the bathroom, catching the door just before Sherlock turned to slam it.
It hasn’t been so far.
John felt like he was being cross-examined, like on the cop shows his father liked to watch. “I can cook,” he admitted. “Well, bake, I mean. Madam.”
Sherlock put down a violin and bow, and walked over, the lamp-light throwing his face into relief. He was pale, paler than John, and he had a mop of dark hair that John privately thought needed a brush. He wasn’t smiling, either, and it didn’t look like it was something he did very often. He was… different-looking.
Sherlock touched John’s stomach, and the baby pressed against his hand with a foot. “Two, then.”
“Alright,” Victor nodded, and the doctor disappeared. “Shit. Oh, shit.”
“No,” Sherlock closed his eyes. “Doesn’t hurt.” He pulled John’s arm around him. “I’m your omega.”
Sherlock dashed into the bathroom, and John heard him curse the waste of water in the unused bath. It had been a nice thought, but (and John gripped the bedclothes tight as his body pushed without permission) it was too late for that, now.
“You may leave the door open.”
Victor stared for a moment, then laughed, putting an arm around Sherlock and pulling him into a quick sideways hug. “I think you and I’ll get on jus’ fine, Sherlock.”
The two brothers looked over.
“That sounds agreeable,” Sherlock went back to nuzzling John’s throat.
“Yeah, maybe,” John drained his glass. “Maybe one day I will be. On my own terms, with a partner I’ve chosen, not with a stranger who raped me. And don’t start on the whole
John scanned the list of students, holding his yellow highlighter at the ready.
Sherlock traced one of his lower arms over the land-walker's head, learning the size – which was roughly the same as his own - and texture. Its hair was very fine, and starting to dry out. Sherlock assumed it would a lighter colour once dry. He could feel the bite of the blunt ends of each strand on the flesh of his arm, though it was no unpleasant. The creature tensed horribly as the tip of Sherlock's arm touched into the shell of its ear. He thought perhaps they were sensitive, so he moved on to examine the face. The land-walker's skin was soft, though dry - Sherlock's arm left a visible sheen of slick in its path. The animal stayed stone-still as Sherlock carefully lifted an eyelid, touched the rim of a nostril (the creature made a rather amusing face at that), and pulled down its lower lip to see the frankly blunt and unimpressive teeth. A strange dental combination, with no fangs and yet no flat plates for crushing vegetation, either. Its diet had to be varied… perhaps they were scavengers, surviving on whatever they found. He brought another arm up, and pushed the creature’s jaw wide open.
John heard it all, anyway.
Warning: Mentions of past sexual abuse of Eurus and John
He was stunningly protective of Sherlock, now. Even sending him to school put him on edge, because he knew there were alphas there. Including Victor, who called for Sherlock twice a week. They went out who knew where together, though Sherlock always made a point of coming home early, looking demure and apologetic, and then spending time with John on the sofa or in the kitchen, as if he thought he could spread his attentions across two alphas.
Someone else was in his room, someone else was on John’s list to monitor. There was always someone else, in this line of work. An endless procession of dying people, each one desperate not to leave.
“What worries you, specifically?”
“Not at all, young man. You take care.” Cam resumed his seat at the table, and Mycroft led Sherlock and John out to the waiting car.
John ruined the moment entirely, by bursting into tears.
“I’m ok,” John took a drink, focussing on the chocolate taste. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have tried to touch you. My own fault.”
“Fuck,” John groaned, snapping his hips back and forth, his knot sliding over Sherlock’s stretched skin, making him cry out as it bumped back against his prostate. John couldn’t hold back – the scent was too much, the urge was too much –
“Who was he fighting, and
“Just do it,” Sherlock let out a sob. “You might as well do it now… I’m –”
John winced, and pushed Sherlock away. “No need for violence…” he sighed, and glanced guiltily up at the sky. “She lives at 421 Jubilee Drive, not too far from here.”
He sighed, and tried to snuggle back under the covers, but knew sleep would be a long time coming.
He locked the main door to the room, claiming all the silent cubicles for himself before dropping to his knees in front of one, and vomiting spectacularly. Coffee, toast and fruit all came back up, partially digested and disgusting. Sherlock heaved again, bring up more, throwing up for a good five minutes until he was just producing bile, and his stomach hurt. He flushed the toilet, and pulled his scarf off as he staggered to the sinks.
“No!” John glared, hormones controlling the conversation for him. “I don’t need you bloody babying me, alright?”
It still didn’t make sense.
“Just save my damn life,” John reached for him. “Sherlock, please…”
“Why wouldn’t I be interested?”
A pang of guilt shot through Sherlock's tenfold-arms. He didn't want the creature to die, not really. They were simple beasts, and clumsy in the water, they didn't really know what they were doing. The stories all said that once a land-walked got into difficulty in the ocean, they simply gave up and died.
After Sherlock made a passing comment about smelling a pregnant omega in the supermarket, John stopped wanking in the shower, terrified and embarrassed that Sherlock would recognise the scent of alpha semen. Or worse, that the scent alone would send him into a heat he wasn’t prepared for.
The baby opened her eyes, and gave a squawk.
“Really?” Cam looked disbelieving for a moment, then snapped his fingers. “Of course, it’s because he’s immature. Well, that’s a child to me. Age doesn’t come into it – if they’re immature, they’re a child. Even if they’re eighteen, no one should be looking at them.”
boys?”
Sherlock could feel his cheeks prickling. “Um. I…”
He looked like an idiot, but he couldn’t help grinning at himself.
“Here,” John handed him a box of wet wipes. “Sorry, I hope that wasn’t too uncomfortable.”
They glared at each other.
John nodded. “And… the future? What about that?”
“He’s about as attractive as a dead hedgehog,” Sherlock put the papers down. “Do you have to get going?”
“I see.”
John glared.
John passed him a sheet of paper. “Tuck that into the front of your trousers, like an apron. I have to put gel on your skin, and it might stain them.”
Sherlock looked up. "You could have gotten yourself off, you realise."
“It is an act of submission that cannot be denied. For someone to willing open their veins to you… for a vampire there is nothing greater. And to be on the reverse side…” he gestured between them. “It is frightening and thrilling.”
John relaxed visibly, his shoulders dropping. ‘Ok. God, I… I feel like we shouldn’t have. I don’t regret it, but… yikes.’
"Leave your bag here," Robison snapped. "You're going to empty your bladder, not eat your lunch. Go on!"
“Oh my god…”
“But you shouldn’t have to.”
Sherlock hesitated, then did as he was told, unfastening the catches, and lifting the lid.
Doctor Fisher had come in, with Mycroft behind him, and was speaking quietly to Timothy. The man was nodding, and letting Fisher give him information without volunteering any of his own. Mrs Holmes got up and went over to listen, and for a minute, John was alone by Sherlock’s bedside. And he allowed himself to look into Sherlock’s face.
“Yeah?”
“Sherlock? He’s…” John’s mind threw up some choice images. He stamped them down. “As long as you don’t try to use the kitchen half the time, I’ve had worse room-mates.”
John walked away, moving to sit on one of the sofas. The Holmes family rejoiced together, and ignored the single Watson in their midst. Sherlock was going to university, for three years, to live and learn there.
‘No!’
"See you in a minute," John said.
“Yes…” Sherlock smiled back, and John knew he was nervous, despite the earlier bravado.
“Shh,” Victor grabbed a handful of tissues, cleaning his stomach off before being the big spoon to Sherlock’s small frame. “It’s ok…”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “Would you like to?”
‘She’s with her dad, love, it’s alright.’
Sherlock reached across the table, and took his hand.
“Right,” Greg scratched his nose with his pencil, and kept his eyes on his notebook. John couldn’t blame him, the whole situation was appalling. “Let’s see if I’ve got this straight. Siger Holmes, the man who John claimed was abusing him –”
Sherlock mentally filed away this information for later, and went back to estimating the time of death based on cell deterioration. He was learning a lot, and had his first exam in ten days. He was certain he would pass with the necessary credits.
The boys took the food into the lounge, plating up their own meals before switching the TV on, and selecting the right movie from the pre-recorded ones the box had chosen by itself. John grinned as the film started playing, the two of them sat on the floor, backs to the sofa, cushions under them as they balanced plates on their knees.
Sherlock had sent him away. Fucked him, then told him to go.
Sherlock sighed, putting his phone to one side as he leaned forward, and dragged his work over. His breasts brushed against the soft material of his top, making him wince before sitting back and making a start on the work, doing all the calculations in his head, not bothering to show his working.
There was a moment of soft silence.
“Can I come?” John asked, quickly.
‘I’m joking. But he’s weird, isn’t he? Not bonded at his age, and he’s not exactly bottom of the barrel.’
“See you later,” Sherlock smiled, before grabbing his coat, and trotting off down the stairs.
No one tried to comfort him. What would be the point? No one knew what he was going through.
Sherlock closed his laptop without bothering to shut it down properly. Perhaps he was being unreasonable. Lestrade might have been sexually attracted to John before he knew he was an omega, and had been afraid of upsetting their relationship. Or else he thought Sherlock was claiming John…
It was paradise for the two of them, and the only thing that would stop them heading to it was torrential rain.
“What would happen if you did?”
“Yes,” Sherlock called, staring straight at his brother. “Goodbye, then.”
Whether or not Siger deserved it, Eurus had killed him.
“Alright, well, you’re welcome to keep using your room,” the corporal said. “There’s no one on the waiting list.”
“John, he needs to see you –”
Sherlock didn’t pick up the mess, and neither did John. John made himself food, and didn’t even attempt to feed Sherlock, who was dissecting something vile in the kitchen. They didn’t speak for the rest of the evening, and John was still in a foul mood when Sherlock came to bed (thankfully showered) and slipped under the covers.
“One per month, every month, since I was fifteen,” Sherlock said quietly.
John ran his hand over the curls of dark hair on Sherlock’s thighs, caressing and tickling the smoother skin on the insides of his limbs before moving back to his cock. Small, by alpha and beta standards, yet more than enough to let John know that Sherlock was eager. The omega whimpered softly as John thumbed at the hardness through his underwear, flattening his hand to touch more, to feel Sherlock’s cock against his palm.
“Depends. Are you going to do any more drugs and thieving?”
If Sherlock had been in any doubt as to John’s gender up to that point, the view he now had would have confirmed it. John walked over, not confident in his body, but resigned. His thick thighs and muscular legs were off-set by the soft roundness of his belly (that the shirt didn’t quite hide), and his cock, though erect, was small and jutting from above a soft cushion of flesh that served no purpose at all, as John was incapable of fathering children.
John nodded, hooking his fingers over the elastic of Sherlock’s briefs and pulling them down to mid-thigh, exposing his slim cock, which was already rather erect. “Looks like you’re more than ok, to me.”
Mycroft stopped towards Lestrade. “That’s all. I might be a poor excuse for an alpha, but I can at least protect my family. Even from other members of my family.”
The baby inside John started squirming about as its mother’s breakfast got into their shared bloodstream. He looked down and watched his stomach change shape. So gross. He finished his juice, and put the dishes in the sink.
John shrugged. “I don’t know. It would never be yours, though. Sure, at a distance, people might be fooled, but as soon as the wind changed… scents can only change so much.”
The woman looked nonplussed as he slammed his way out of the door, shaking, feeling as though everyone in the word was watching and knew what had happened in that tiny showroom.
“I’d’ve punched you if it wasn’t,” Sherlock said, his eyes right on John’s.
John sat on the edge of the bed. Sherlock noticed he’d stripped it and put the covers in the laundry basket. The bedroom window remained shut. John’s eyes darted towards it now and again, and his nostrils flared.
on the computer. He picked up his own coat on the way out. Though the morning sickness had stopped entirely, it had been replaced with absent-mindedness that annoyed John no end. “Sorry, bit distracted… it’s been a day.”
And suddenly, after the initial movements, it was very different.
don’t deserve to be beaten up in the toilets. You’re my best friend, and I… I’ll always come running. If you want me to.”
“No, that was great,” the therapist said, smiling. “That was better than some of my civilian patients. You’ve been practicing.”
His stomach swooped, a little.
“Ow!” he cried out, gripping the sink as his insides convulsed again, this time with a trickle of something. “Oh…” he hardly knew what to do with himself.
John tensed.
Which couldn't happen, could it?
“Tea, or coffee?”
“I knew it,” John smiled, and putting his hand at the back of his mate’s head, closed the space between them for a kiss.
Maybe actually seductive.
But he was going to come home to John going into heat.
“Fuck,” John’s knees buckled. “Sherlock… I’m going into… You need to…” He was going into rut. Sherlock had done it. He’d finally gotten John to want him, and it was driving him into a painful rut. If he didn’t leave immediately John would fuck him. He wouldn’t be able to control himself.
“I need to come off scenters,” John said. “Let everyone figure it out.”
But, somehow they didn’t.
“Mrs Hudson sent them back, because Sherlock was gone,” Mycroft said. “When he returned… I continued the practice. I had no wish for him to go back to you.”
Almost entirely.
John forced himself to keep still. This… this was new. He was aroused, and because he wanted the
They sat in silence as John wrestled with the clench around his chest, his heart, and tried not to let the drawing feeling pick him up from his chair and make him run across London back to his mate. He knew, even now, that his bond was Sherlock was strong – as strong as it could be, bar the moment of the bite. They were connected by soul, by blood, and by the cluster of cells growing in John’s womb.
John would delay leaving his bedroom until hunger forced him out, and then he would avoid eye contact with everyone and anyone he came across. Eurus would smirk at him every chance she got, whilst Violet tried, at least for the first few weeks, to work out what had turned the orphan omega into such a recluse. On the rare days Mycroft was home, he would offer to drive John into town, or to the library. Although the offers were kind, John refused them all. He hated being in the car. Mycroft also tried, once, to convince John to stay downstairs by putting on a DVD John had mentioned enjoying, once. John did sit in the lounge and start to watch it, but tensed rigidly when Mycroft sat beside him, even though the alpha was only bringing him a cup of juice. John blurted some excuse, and ran to his room. Mycroft’s eyes were full of concern as he watched him go, but John couldn’t stay.
“Want me to come with you?” Lestrade offered.
“Is it possible your friend has taken drugs, or alcohol?”
“Stop it!” Sherlock covered his face with his hands.
John stayed looking out the window. “I think you were too late as soon as that vampire got on the tube,” he said. His voice sounded soft. “I shouldn’t have gone off alone.”
It was very odd, Sherlock thought, blinking back into the present. He couldn’t think of many people he’d allow to do that to him, and he didn’t even like babies as a rule. But he just did things for her, without minding. He changed her and bathed her (oh, what a disaster that was) and carried her about in the days before John got better at walking about the flat, and it just seemed… fine.
It was all so messed up.
“I like the privacy,” he said.
“It’s…” John cringed. He felt as if his chest had a great weight on it. “It’s probably just me being crazy.”
John’s mind had also been taken up with the issue of Sherlock.
John folded his arms. “It’s not fair.”
Sherlock blinked, as if he didn’t understand. “Oh… yes.”
The car started to move.
Sherlock was hunched over his experiment, pretending to take notes on the sample’s progress. When really, he was watching the other students. And their panic. Their disorganisation. Several students were giving up and putting their samples in the sterile chamber already. They would score 2:2s. Sherlock rolled his eyes, and made a tiny note on the development of his own petri dish. The sample bubbled and crusted at the edges, as predicted. Sherlock had run this experiment before, but the results always seemed to depend on –
Mycroft looked out of the window. “We’re almost there. Sherlock, if you could at least try to put a decent face on for Mummy, that would be much appreciated. She’s terribly worried that you haven’t bonded, yet. She’ll hardly recognise you in that suit, besides.”
“Sure, but I mean it.” Greg stood to show John out. “And good luck, yeah? Meet me at the station later, I’m going to go in and pick up a few things. I’ll come and get you, if you need me to.”
“He wanted it. Or, thought he did.”
“Oh god,” Mycroft looked. “Sherlock…”
They’d talked about it, fleetingly, in snatches of conversation, about what Sherlock’s boundaries were. His chest was a no-go, or at least it had been so far – Sherlock was reluctant to even hug John face to face until he could get his binder back on.
The nurse gave him a smile. “Press your buzzer if you need anything, John. There’s a pad and pencil on your lap.” She gathered her things, and let herself out.
‘Oh god, yeah,’ Faye laughed, then half-shut her eyes, opened her mouth slightly and gave a sensual sigh that made Sherlock flinch, and his blood suddenly tingle through his body.
“Not a scruffy tutor in a jumper and a tiny office?”
“What happens now?”
John groaned, and banged his head on the desk, looking up in despair at himself. He should just go out, get an after-heat pill, and draw a line under all this. If he had another heat, he could talk to Sherlock about it. He couldn’t just have a baby out of the blue. Sherlock would think he’d done it deliberately to trap him.
, he thought. He looked back at the box.
Maybe John would never know where Sherlock had been those years. What had changed him from a caring alpha into one John barely recognised. What had made him believe John only cared for him because his instincts told him to.
“Woah, Sherlock, trying for a peek at the ladies?” someone teased.
And he wouldn’t try to tell anyone, ever again.
John swirled his tongue around the swollen head, tasting the pre-come taste that gathered at the back of his throat. He put his lips over the glans and sucked gently, listening to Sherlock’s stifled groans, feeling the tremble of his thigh muscles in his hands.
“You don’t have to rush into anything,” Mycroft set him back on the sofa after a few minutes. “Whatever you feel for John, if anything, will happen in its own time.”
“Sherlock…” John felt disappointment wash through him. “You don’t have to do this. Not now. I’m proud of you, but you don’t need to bond with me.”
Sherlock gave the sore-looking nipple a final kiss before moving back up the bed to kiss John’s mouth again. John responded, gripping Sherlock’s hips suddenly as he felt a hardness not unlike his own press into his thigh. John let out a shaky breath.
“I’ve got a helmet on.” Sherlock steadied himself on the flat ground, and pushed off with purpose.
“I’m not asking you to forgive me, and I won’t. But I’m tell you, John. You have always been special to me. As a person, not just as an omega. As you. And you… you are someone I would never wish my alpha rut upon. You are better than that. You are so much better, and you deserve so much more than what I can offer you, but I…” he lifted John’s chin with a finger. “I am still willing to wait for you. As long as you need me to. I’m not going anywhere.”
“But you’re comfortable being an alpha?” John asked.
John almost grinned. “Well… yeah. Is that so surprising?”
“Stay still,” John quickly passed the baby between Sherlock’s legs, and she immediately began to bawl.
“If you’re about to –”
“Fine,” Sherlock nodded. “I could use the time to think.” He picked up his bag and coat. “Thank you… John. For checking. I… I will be able to make a plan, now.”
“Hey, you. What you doing here?”
“What’s going on?” he asked, softly, padding into the kitchen. Eurus was huddled at one end of the table, wrapped in a blanket, shivering, although she was red in the face. “Are you poorly, Eurus?”
“And I will.”
Sherlock seemed struck speechless, his eyes popping at the sight of a mature alpha cock pressed against his stomach.
“I don’t know if I’ve got a reason to do that,” Mycroft said.
“Is this a confession?”
“Very true,” John grinned.
“Last night. About… eight. Or nine.”
The whole time they were in Mycroft’s home, Sherlock was held on Magnussen’s lap like a ventriloquist’s dummy, Magnussen’s hands on the nape of his neck, his thighs, his wrists, moving slowly and relentlessly. Sherlock tried to blank it out, blushing and being quiet like the child-bride he was to become. The wedding would happen next week (so, Sherlock said, he could send off his Bacca forms in time), and there would be only a few guests. Weddings were what happened when an alpha needed legal ownership of an omega, but their heat wasn’t imminent. Sherlock would become Magnussen’s property, but the tie could (in theory) be severed at any time… until a bite-to-the-neck occurred during a heat.
“…do you?”
John nodded. “Come here, then?”
“Yes. Thank you,” Siger added, as an afterthought.
“Who says I’m afraid?” John said, too quickly.
“I gathered.”
‘Mm, fine,’ Sherlock pushed himself upright, his mouth dry and throat sticking. ‘Thanks for the card, yesterday. And the books.’
Lestrade pushed his fingers into his head as if fighting off a migraine. "Don't tell me that. If you actually kill someone-"
That sparked a fury in James eyes as he clawed at Sherlock's hand, his face going red from a lack of oxygen. Sherlock sniffed, then slowly let the major down, sighing as he coughed, then heaved on the floor, gasping and pulling at his collar to loosen it.
“And I stick to that,” John said. “No money, anyway.” He heaved himself off the sofa. “Uh… Look at the snow.” He went over to the window. “The road’s vanished.” He stared out of the glass.
“What… do you do, exactly?”
“Oh, thanks,” John nodded, going to take a bag by the handles. “Did you want some food, Mycroft?”
“Hopefully not,” John said, saluting before leaving.
John nodded. “Thanks, Sherry, I’ll think about it.”
“Who were you wanting to see?” John shifted his own file under his arm. “I could check if they want a visitor.”
“I wasn’t trying you on for size,” John said softly. “I stopped it because I know what it would mean, for you. You don’t just get me, if we…”
“Oh god, it made you a beta?” John gasped, losing his head completely.
"The coroner will be there anyway," John pointed out. "It's the last time of the day to eat - everyone goes."
The second visitor was Mycroft.
“You’re..?” John probed.
to. John was about to lose his senses. “I’m going to Mycroft’s,” he lied. Any mention of Victor might make John bite him faster than he could blink. He had to move. Get out of the flat. Now.
John didn’t blame him. His alpha instincts were to protect. He couldn’t do anything, here. Neither of them could.
Mycroft was staring at him as though he’d seen a ghost. Or a premonition, maybe. His eyes were goggling, mouth open, croissant in his hand crumbling in his grip as he gawped in a most unattractive manner.
“Sexy talk…” Sherlock shook his head, and followed.
He suddenly felt queasy, and closed his laptop lid, pushing the machine away. He got dressed into his pyjamas, and got into bed, where he rolled around all night, worrying endlessly, and missing Sherlock like he was missing half of himself.
And none of it came.
“Please,” Sherlock nodded. “With hot chocolate?”
“It’s alright,” Sherlock said, his voice soft, like a secret. “It’s alright.”
“But what a fitting punishment, don’t you think?” Sherlock raised his red eyes. “You could argue I deserve it, but you do not. I will find him, the one who caused this.”
But maybe there’s no need to speak.
“Beta parents rarely have omega children, and
– by strangers. They’d wanted him, because he’d smiled at that boy. That boy wanted him.
Not a full-time job, but on-call and locum work that might just get him enough hours in the months he had to buy some baby things. The doctor who spoke to him, Sarah, was thrilled to take on a male omega doctor, and promised to set him up with shifts as of the next week. It was the best John could have hoped for. He could take a few months off after the baby was born, and then look for something full-time.
