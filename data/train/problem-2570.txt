They turned over the page and the contents become less frequent. There’s nothing after Sherlock’s fall for over two years until John and Mary’s wedding. Say what you will about Jonathan Small, he could certainly take a decent picture. Afterwards, the pages are filled with Rosie and of her looking around wide-eyed at the park, or being held by various family members, or of her sleeping in various places. She's only a few months old so there's very little she is able to do that is truly worthy of being photographed. But John does it anyway and plans to fill up the entire album with her over the next few years, capturing all her milestones and memories for later.
They’ve caught their breath enough that they run all the way back to Baker Street, letting the adrenaline make up for their exhaustion. When they get back, they’re fatigued and it’s too late to knock on Mrs Hudson’s door for Rosie. There’s always the morning.
“It’s not like you’re very open for communication at the moment.”
"John, I'm sor-"
Right then, at one in the morning, all the feelings John has been repressing into a backseat for almost half a decade comes rushing back like a tidal wave, so powerful and all-encompassing he can scarcely breathe from the realisation. He sees himself ten, fifteen, twenty years from now, still here, still raising Rosie with him, still on cases -
"Thank you for coming today, John," he says, closing the door behind John.
"So, what did they ask you?" Sherlock asked later as they walked down the library, stopping every so often to grab books.
“...Oh.”
"Oh, that makes things so much better, then!"
"Well, I suppose you should know, Doctor," Sherlock purred, and John couldn't tell if he was more surprised and slightly worried that this stranger knew that about him, or if he was more aroused at the way Sherlock spoke his title, his mouth shaping around the word as though savouring it.
"Sure. Hey, well done for not breaking your leg while dancing. Or mine."
“Yeah, she’s here. Come here and meet her.”
Sherlock
The commentator announced that Janine earned 24 points in total and that the next champion to compete would be John Watson; the audience cheered and applauded threateningly. Again, someone led John to the entrance to the Quidditch field and he entered, his footsteps sinking into the sand until he made his way into the centre. The March wind but through his uniform, so he held his arms against his chest for warmth, an act of protection against his rising anxiety as well as the bitter cold. Then he saw it.
When Sherlock would recall that day later on, he would not remember how he sat tensely watching the maze, with only distant voices and flashes of spells giving any indication of what was happening.
19:31 Don’t you have a fiancee to be having drinks with? SH
He slips through the crowds of people unseen, into the large building - truly remarkable, the feats of architecture humans are now capable of - and makes his way through the building without an aim or plan. No one stops him, or questions why he’s there or why he has Redbeard with him: one of the many benefits of having the powers of the king of the underworld and the ability to repel mortals.
"Merlin, you're dramatic." Sherlock came and sat on the stool, dragging it across until he was sat opposite John.
"Green brings out my eyes, you dick! Besides, that was in year 7. Anyway, Sherlock, I don't think there's anything you can say here that we haven't already told each other. Go on, do your worst."
"Nah. You're her godfather, I think you're important enough to be in this. Here." He picks Rosie up, who cries a little in protest of her play being interrupted then calms down once placed in Sherlock's arms. John gets out his phone and opens up the camera.
"And you're the first person I've ever liked enough to call you a friend."
At least John didn't think Sherlock is completely and utterly in love with him.
"I'm glad."
John rolls his eyes with a grin, turning back to the coffee machine. “I have a living to earn, you know. Discounts won’t pay for my textbooks. And it’s not like you’re short of money - “
I agree that the story is a bit stupid. I think it’s just their way of saying that no one really knows how it works. Except maybe a secret society that hides in caves and kills anyone who dares to try and discover the secret science behind soulmates. Who knows.
"Ha-ha." John rolled his eyes, "I meant, what is it about?"
"Redbeard. I know, it's a stupid name. I went through a bit of a pirate phase when I was younger and the name stuck."-
“Pleasure.”
Watson softens at this, his lips parting as he exhales shakily. Holmes is not by nature a verbally sentimental man - he is a man who shows his love through glances and subtle caresses in the back of carriages, through praises and ‘conductor don lights’. To hear it so explicitly is not something Watson will ever tire of. “You’ve turned sentimental, old man,” He croaks out.
The silence lulls him to sleep, a taunting reminder of the lack of silence to come.
It isn't long before the distance between them shrinks, inching closer and closer, until John's arm has slipped from the back of the sofa to Sherlock's shoulders (later, he will blame it on the slipperiness of the leather), and Sherlock's head is resting on John's shoulders, his curls tickling his cheek (exhaustion and still in recovery is John's excuse for Sherlock's casual physical affection.) Sherlock's breaths become steady, slowing and slowing, until John is certain that his plan worked and Sherlock is finally asleep.
FLUFF
Sherlock walked over to John and stood in front of him, "Well, I would very much like it," Sherlock said quietly, "if you could stay in my work, and my life, for as long as possible after we leave."
Sherlock makes the call and even goes downstairs to get it when it arrives. He’s changed so much since John last lived here, not counting the months before Christmas - he’s kinder, more considerate, more weary, so much so it sometimes terrifies John that his years abroad - almost literally - beat him into submission. But then again, the old Sherlock is still there, all the snark and stubbornness and sharp wit.
“I mean - yeah I’ve mentioned him sometimes, like when he corrects a professor in a way that’s quite funny, or when I see him at a cafe or something, but it’s not like I’m obsessed or anything,” John says, then adds, somewhat bitterly, “We’ve never even spoken to one another.”
"John, what - "
"Yes."
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.
He wiped his eyes dry of moisture threatening to make himself known, then looked around the room. The familiarity of the Ravenclaw dorm room was somewhat a reassurance
John tries to pay attention to the ballet. He truly does. It does look interesting for a tiny bit - a beautiful woman dancing around a man in a kilt sleeping on a chair. And he knows how important this is for Sherlock But then his attention averts to other things - how long can they stay there? What will they do at the interval? What should they eat for dinner? He turns to look at Sherlock to wonder if he is enjoying it any more than John is, and he smiles when he sees the look on Sherlock's face.
“Promise you’ll stay safe.” Sherlock murmured in John’s ear.
“Nothing a bit of soap and water can’t fix afterwards.” John kissed his husband of four years softly, yet allowing for enough teasing movements and touches to promise for more and send a thrill down Sherlock's spine, then pulled away and walked towards the bathroom. Sherlock’s heart rate had increased immensely, and he felt tangibly the loss of John’s body heat. Two can play at that game, the detective thought to himself smugly as he waited a few minutes, knowing John would be getting impatient soon too.
"What are we supposed to do otherwise?"
"Oh. Oh, Sherlock. I'm sorry."
Harry: How dare you accuse me of such a thing. When have I ever done something for you to believe me capable of such treachery
Sherlock nodded, his lips pressed in a tight line. "Thank you." His words came out hoarsely. That, at least, John was able to understand. He came up beside Sherlock and took his hand in his while addressing Janine in broken French that he had learnt in primary school. "Au revoir, Janine."
Sherlock's breathing sped up in a panic, just within the boundary of control.
Tuesday came surprisingly slowly.
“Anything we can do for you, Mrs Hudson?”
John grins. "Oh yeah?"
"You're working on it, though."
"Your smallness."
He rolls his eyes. “She’s fine. Besides, what’s a couple of broken stitches compared to this?” He kisses the top of Rosie’s head. “This is the first time I’ve seen Rosie in two weeks. I’ve missed her.”
John exhaled. “It’s back to square one. Drinking every morning while she sits struggling at her typewriter, with a temper that could scare the Queen.”
"How kind of you," Sherlock mutters, just loud enough for John to hear over the blare of the TV.
"He was working for someone who wants my attention.
Mary’s eyes hardened, with fear or determination. “Moriarty’s dead.”
“No one! I swear it! I’m just a jogger! I have a route, you know,” John spluttered out, his heart beating wildly as he wondered what the hell had happened in the last few months to make Sherlock like this. (And also, if it was weird that he was turned on a little bit.)
"I don't think so. But the doubt was enough to prevent an attempt at finding Moriarty. The Minister said that there is no point wasting resources and time on a man that leaves no evidence of existing. Not until he emerges again."
"Mary?!" John all but yelled. "Wait, as in Mary Morstan? Mary, my ex Mary?"
"Oh."
"You've been in my house, Sherlock. The only life lessons I ever really got were  a large variety of swear words, mainly from Harry."
"I don't care. I just don't see the point. You're a doctor." Sherlock said firmly.
“Nope.”
John tried his luck as he gave a snort. "Seems rather ironic."
John closed the door slightly, but left it ajar enough to hear the rustle of paper and a muttered: “oh, that’s when I come in”. He gave a satisfied grin before going off to look for the props department. It turned out that the person in charge of the swords was at home in bed with the stomach flu, so John took it upon himself to move them just before the play started.
"He predicted a week."
I wanted to put in a scene with John's friends being kind and supportive, but I couldn't quite find a way to fit it into the chapter (without also adding an extra 2000 words which frankly I was too lazy to have in the same chapter) so maybe we'll get to meet them at a later date.
"What 'he'?" It's Sherlock's turn to be intrigued.
Sherlock froze into absolute stillness without moving a muscle, doing everything in his power to not betray his feelings as John entered the room because this morning of all mornings John looked absolutely lovely.
"When did you have these made?"
It's raining corpses and John should have expected it.
Even after a little bit longer, Sherlock refuses to move.
He felt Sherlock's shoulders shrug, his hands falling to the tucked edge of John's precariously low towel, teasing his thumbnail along the muscled ridge that shadowed John's hip. "Immaterial. I really only required the viscoelastic polymers from the other plants to conduct my experiment with, this one merely filled out the order to get free shipping."
"Of course I will dear. But do please zip up your jacket at least. You should have bundled up a bit more in your condition."
"I did." Sherlock breathed, confused by the utter adoration that had overtaken John with such a simple tool. Did peasants not know of--?
"Be quiet." The High Steward interrupted. "You were required to stay in the Prince's company and yet you decided to abandon him for the sake of some fool's errand which caused the Prince to fall into a depression. Which, luckily for you, does not look too deep to come back from.
"You made this?" John asked in even more amazement, his eyes pouring over the object again like he couldn't believe it. Like it was a treasure.
"It was not unbearable." Sherlock lies.
"And I want to apologize for your wall. You can take it out of my rent. I don't mind." He adds quickly and with a last genuine smile, zips up his Haversack and leaves.
"Is it?" Sherlock looked utterly bewildered.
"Then just stay like that." Sherlock said, glancing over at him with a crinkled smile. He opened John's top drawer filled with socks and underwear.
They both looked up simultaneously into the mirror to find Sherlock standing stiffly behind them, his body turned possessively towards John. "Are you ready to leave? I'm finished here." Sherlock was ghostly pale and glistening with sweat, though his shirt magically bore no perspiration stains.
But it was quite a feat.
John places a hand on Sherlock's head and smiles when the man leans up into it like a cat. It's been almost a month since he's gotten his cast off and John can't seem to stop touching Sherlock at every available opportunity. Good thing Sherlock doesn't seem to mind at all. "Divide and conquer hm?" John hums. He threads his fingers through soft curls before taking a bit of a handful. "You will get dressed though, yeah? Before wandering out to the sitting room? The man /was/ witness to a murder after all - well heard one anyway - which you said ranked at about a six, so that at least earns him some trousers wen you get around to it."
Now that there are no more monsters waiting in the dark to eat them.
And he couldn't help himself if he admired the way he caught John nonchalantly checking the bottom third of the door handle as they came in.
And John would so sooner die a thousand and one deaths before he would ever let a treacle-colored hair be touched on William's dear head.
At her other hip hung her broadsword, as good as another appendage, with how well she wielded it. Across her chest, her cuirass writhed with the basalisk. All her plate armor cleaned and shined until it looked practically new. Glowing as if it were still burning from the fires it had been forged in. Much like her.
Charles released his finger immediately, letting Sherlock's hand slide from his. It thumped deadweight against Sherlock's thigh.
Throwing his head even higher back on his neck, giving him one more frigid rasp of his eyes, the King turned his horse wordlessly and rode back into Baker Town.
"Like this is fine." John said as he brought his fingers around to gently take the full tumescence into his grasp. The head mushroomed out above the ring of his small fist. Sherlock swallowed.
"It's impossible," Sherlock said decisively. "Every person in the Kingdom would be on the lookout for us once word got out and my brother employs the best trackers and hunters in the land, they would find us sooner or later. And when we got caught, I'd be locked back up here and you'd be hanged. I couldn't bear that."
"Ah, that." Ushering him, Sherlock brought John over to the glistening lab equipment and uncovered a wooden plate of food that held the missing slice of bread, the cheese, and a whole withered pear. "You see, radix pedis diaboli when dried, pulverized and set to open flame creates a smoke that, when inhaled, drives the individual stark raving mad. Possibly to the point of death, though limited exposures have only ever been tested."
Sherlock hummed agreeably and took another bite. "Oh most definitely. You heard what Lestrade said: I battered his career by solving the Carl Powers' case. He'll do something ostentatious to try and save face."
But she had thanked him with a good tea time and celebrated his victory with a delicious home-made supper and sent him finally back upstairs with leftovers and an affectionate peck on his cheek in thanks.
"Sherlock?" He rapped at Sherlock's bedroom door. "Mind telling me what that was all about?"
"Well of course I would...but John?"
He made to disappear, then thought better of it. "Or, better yet, volunteer yourself as an outlet for John so that he may discuss his football ...fixation with someone. God knows why he would require something so tedious in his life when he's got me, but it would be better than him talking AT ME about it whenever he feels it necessary. Do that instead." There was a smear of blood on his goggles from where he'd absently pushed back his hair, his eyes as bright as hellfire. "But nevermind that now. Come inside the both of you. There's something you need to see."
Either way.
"Just fire the woman and be done with it." Sherlock's statement seemingly came out of nowhere, yet struck bullseye just as they always seemed to. John never could quite get used to it.
For the next three days he had shut himself inside his house to stay, refusing to go out. Even going so far as to plug up the holes in the walls that they were obliged to call windows with mud and straw just to keep the paranoia of being seen again at bay.
Speaking of indignity; John was a panting mess beneath him. Most of his torso was slick with saliva, which was already evaporating quickly into the cool bedroom air, leaving tiny prickles of goose flesh dancing out across his skin. His mouth was open while his eyes remained shut, adrift in the constellation of his own awakened nerve endings. His hair stood up at the back, spraying up like silver feathers.
"Happy housewarming idiot." Harry crooned on her return in the doorway, grinning ear to ear.
John is so utterly confused. "Sh'lck?"
Last night was the first night since coming back from Afghanistan that anyone had seen him shirtless. John, himself, didn't dwell much on his own torso nowadays. He avoided looking at it in the mirror as much as he could, dressing perfunctorily for his day and went on with his life like it wasn't even there at all.
He looked up, following the pale white runway of Sherlock's torso straight up into a pair of sheltered eyes where he was sure he could see the tiniest wash of disappointment before they turned away. John moved his wet hand back up to Sherlock's hip, unwilling to let failure get the better of him, "any recommendations you wanna give me? Constructive criticism?" He tried to make it sound casual, but felt like he'd failed. "I'm all ears."
He was helping him now.
"So, hang on a minute." John interjected. "You were rich as a kid, yeah? Went to a private school?"
"Octopi bear no internal nor external skeletal structure and can therefore reduce themselves to the size of their beak." Sherlock informed him. "Specimens in labs have shown a remarkable level of intelligence by opening jars and escaping from containers. Mr. Asano's particular pet seems to have utilized just such abilities."
Between one blink and the next, John became alarmed by his forehead bumping the medicine cabinet, completely unaware that he'd lost all faculties in his neck muscles and hoped that he hadn't just made that small whine that he'd very positively heard just happen.
"No, John. YOU have."
Sherlock swallowed. "This case is important to me, John. It comes first."
And it took only a split second for Sherlock to convince himself to execute a plan to keep this man in his life until it became the end of one of them.
"Yes my Lord." John answered and watched as the High Steward's feather-wrung head disappeared down the steps.
The bouncer hesitates for a moment.
"Is the man best suited to act in my stead. Since you've left me no other option. I'll not have you second-guessing my decisions. . ."
Until the utter silence was shattered by a wailing moan.
Or he would have objected, had he been in the right state of mind at all.
However, that boy wasn’t gone enough to not make John at least try and voice his concerns.
While it was still true that they’d only met just that morning, it suddenly didn’t seem so ridiculous to think that John could get lost in the entity that was Sherlock Holmes.
“I-“ John stammered.
John felt another surge of warmth. His heart quickened at the sight of the pale moonlight softly illuminating Sherlock’s profile.
John looked down and saw the number scrawled messily onto his hand.
Well, John thought drily, no point in trying to keep anything from this genius. “Yes, he called me.”
Under normal circumstances, John might’ve thought it strange that he was watching a boy break into the Scotland Yard crime database on his computer. Then again, there was nothing normal about Sherlock Holmes.
Still Sherlock wouldn’t take it. “I prefer to add it in myself.”
“—it is,” Sherlock interrupted.
Irene cocked her head and smirked, “I don’t think I’d mind if he walked in.”
He wasn’t sure where the piano ended up.
And that hit too close to home. Because all of this, studying like a maniac for subjects he didn’t care about, playing and tackling and running until he fell onto his bunk at night so exhausted and sore that he could hardly move, just to do it all again the next day. Just so that there wasn’t a single second where he could stop and think about how much it still hurts, and today, he knew in a month he’d get to spend a whole week in Edinburgh with Sherlock Holmes, the one person he loved more than anything else in the world, and who utterly despised him. Right. He was fine.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, this narrows the field considerably. The killer was intelligent enough to realize his mistake in the first place, and then he had enough medical knowledge to know that bruising can still appear post-mortem. Think about it John, this is not the work of a common criminal.”
John shot him a evil look.
c) Degree of digestion of stomach contents
“Mr. Watson, it says on the file that you wish to become a doctor?”
“You have no right to tell me who or who not to be friends with.”
“No, no" John shook his head, “well, you are quite extraordinary.”
“Security will be posted on both sides of the dorms to ensure that boys do not enter the girls dormitory and vice versa.”
(Sat 2:05am)
“I’m John, but you already knew that.”
It’s hard having a genius for a best friend sometimes. JW
Sherlock brightened instantly.
“Why are we breaking into Scotland Yard?”
“You don’t have to say anything,” Molly said, her expression softening. “Just think about it.”
Thanks a lot. JW
John shook his head again. “I’ve delayed it two weeks already.”
On the last day of school, John was ecstatic. After he gave a quick hug to all his friends, he made his way over to Sherlock.
“I’ll give you five minutes to find a partner.”
“Maybe later.”
I don’t just let you ‘drag’ me around. I truly enjoy doing these things with you. JW
“When she married my father and had Mycroft and I, she gave up on her studies so he could raise us. If she hadn’t stopped, I’m sure she could’ve won the Nobel prize for physics.”
John’s eyes snapped up to Sherlock’s face, and for a moment he just stared at Sherlock.
“You want to be a doctor.”
More or less. I don’t actually want you ruining all my chances of having a romantic relationship. JW
“Please remember that curfew is nine and you are allowed to go anywhere on this campus. If you wish to go off campus anytime during the week, you must receive a special slip from me giving you permission to do so. Breakfast is held in the mess hall and it starts at six and ends at seven. Your first period promptly starts at 7:30”
Sherlock looked well-put together as always, not looking at all like he just ran through half of London.
“What’s your name?” His voice was low, as to not alert the teacher he was talking.
. “So why are you calling me?” John asked.
John was once again shocked into silence. It took him a moment to process that, all the while Sherlock was still pacing and rattling curses about Mycroft. “Wait,” John said slowly. “What does that have to do with anything?”
"And...we appreciate you getting us in in such short notice." John fumbled to add, trying to act a part that he was actually not having to act at all.
Condom brands of all varying sizes, reasons, and lubrications were hanging before him. All touting their wares and benefits. He felt his cheeks and ears flush red immediately.
"You. Get out."
And soon Sherlock is locked up on his knees, hand moving deftly to spread the lube over himself before reaching down to get at John's entrance.
Did Sherlock suffer from something? Erectile dysfunction maybe? If so, it was something they could deal with together. There were pills Sherlock could take. But John wouldn't pressure him. That was his choice to make. Of course.
It was cold enough to see his breath as he stepped out of the taxi and John pulled his collar up against it. Sherlock was already a dark smudge off the side of the bridge and nearing the river, flapping around in his exaggerated manner. He had bolted from the taxi almost before it'd come to a complete stop.
Sherlock was facing the window as John reached the doorway, his bow stabbing out across his shoulder as the music flowed forth.
"But you /can/ confirm that he was laying horizontally on the street when the bus ran him over?" Sherlock's hands were clipped behind his back.
It climbed to where the air grew wild. Where the atmosphere wasn't so ordered. Where the clouds threatened to break upon your face like waves and the world appeared far more vast and miniature below.
As they ushered themselves out, the first of the servants returned, between their hands a fresh swath of linen and that strange wooden object was handed back to the High Steward. There was a shuffle of fabric and a stone of white hot rage dropped bright into John's stomach at the pathetic sound Sherlock made at whatever was happening down there.
Putting the ceremony immediately from his mind, John had worked to make himself well only for the benefit of being able to walk up to the Lord of the Manor and pay Harry and Clara's debts himself. And if he collapsed on the step and died of exhaustion being carried on the way back, he cared not.
Those sinister lips opened, then closed and John waited patiently for it to come. Like fate, just as he finally found his voice, the ignorant cabbie announced '221B' right over the top of his "John, I--".
John's job in this moment was to sit here and watch.
Sherlock made sure to keep his hands against John's legs as he leant back down, giving him a gauge as to where he was currently positioned, not wanting to startle him too badly.
John blinked at the trepidation in his friend's voice, but dared not to interrupt. Swearing that he could just make out a slight tremble to go along with that low, aching timbre. He wanted very much to touch him. Soothe the worry out of those long, blonde bones.
John's shoulders slumped, something inside him twinging badly at the idea that Sherlock had had to take it upon himself to try and give himself medical aid. "You could have woken me up."
"So I'm going to say this now and I'm going to say this to you as often as you need to hear it to get it through that idiot, genius brain of yours: I love you Sherlock."
Sherlock palmed the left cheek of John's arse and slid his hand up until it met the crook of his knee, pushing his leg back against his belly. John resisted him for a moment, in his last throes of disbelief, before allowing Sherlock to fold it up against his torso, taking the hand tangled in his hair to hold it in place and then did the same with the other.
His back was tilted partially towards the camera with his arm wrapped around John's neck, revealing the dark, striated half of an irezumi body suit tattooed from his neck clear down to his ankle. The menacing icon of a Bhuddist guardian deity was quick to spark Sherlock's esoteric recognition. The icon on the man's back was recognizable by its mismatched fangs and flaming sword.
John was about to protest his own merits of sleep when a large yawn caught him off guard and had him showing Sherlock his tonsils. He huffed out a laugh and dropped himself back down into his pillow, reclaiming the warm space where Sherlock had just vacated and couldn't help but let out little growly noises in his contentment.
Rolling his eyes in exasperation, Sherlock came to a hasty decision.
Sherlock's mouth quivered. "Will you tell me?"
"If you would."
Though, if he were to be truly honest with himsef; it was to avoid having to go to the village as well. He had, in essence, become a recluse since the last day he had gone and was mobbed by the other villagers.
He sat up carefully and let her scamper away, feeling the new skin on his back pull warningly.
John had been tilting his torso over the edge when he'd found it, delighted that his new home provided him a beach access. Of sorts.
"Is that what the two thousand quid was for then?" John asked, remembering their bank account.
And then the body above him no longer belongs to Bill because the tattoos are disappearing. Blanching white and seeping away like milk overtaking a picture. And now the six foot stretch of Sherlock is writhing above him with a rictus stretched across his beautiful face, pinioned by John's cock and trying desperately to control a situation that was well beyond his control. New words pushing through that pouty red mouth:
CHAPTER THIRTEEN - The Adventures of the Enlightened Man
It was the unfinished portion that had trapped his attention. And, with a subtle glance to the High Steward, apparently also the cause of the obsessive stroking of his breastbone.
"Thusly, I considered that the issue was even more deeply engrained than that. One which was on a subconscious level. Which seems to be the most likely reason so far.
The King offered no greeting as they brought their horses to a stop. The only thing he gave was a cursory glance at William, before letting his flat, lifeless eyes rake up and across the entire breadth of John.
"Perhaps." Sherlock concedes.
When his body stopped curling, he was as small as he could get with his head buried between his knees and his face smashed into his hands, the muscles of his shoulders and arms rippled beneath his skin. On the verge of imploding. "I didn't get to say...anything. Not a fucking /thing/! I mean...Jesus!...I should have fucking been there /at least/ to save him. To say what I needed to before he went...he wasn't--I couldn't save...aw fuck! Sherlock." His name as John said it was barely more than a devastating cry, his hands reaching up to fist his own hair in desperation.
"It's quite alright Mr. Watson. You'll be totally conscious the entire time, you just simply won't have a care in the world. If you'll take a seat here." John took off his coat and handed it to Sherlock before sitting in the offered dental chair, looking over the tray of equipment skeptically before Ygritte clipped a paper bib across his chest. "So it says here that we're fixing a chipped tooth? Your second premolar on the left side?"
His brain was suddenly on rapid-fire. "The incision..." John blinked as his observations coalesced. "That's why the appendectomy wasn't performed laparoscopically; because it wasn't an appendectomy at all. It was a nephrectomy. Oh my God." The Hippocratic Oath he'd chosen to take before graduating flared to the forefront of his mind, its outright violation making his guts turn cold. /I shall not cut for stone/.
And both of them knew that John would not deny him anything now.
"Don't even bother." John growled immediately, not willing to listen to whatever empty platitude he was about to say. He didn't need protecting or reminding of just exactly what threat lay outside 221B and despite all of Sherlock's past comments to the contrary, he wasn't an idiot. "I, unlike /some/ people, have a little thing called self-restraint and won't go haring off at a moment's fucking notice to get myself OR somebody else killed just because some stupid letter comes to our door. Yeah?
"No."
John tips his neck up and back, seeing the man he loves standing upside-down at the far end of the long long table.
Alarmed, John took him firmly by the chin, desperately wishing that he would look at him. "How? How could I not love you?"
"Of course you do." William had stepped forward then, his long arms encircling John and pulling him close, careful not to upset the wounds still tender on his back. Unable to maintain a distance.
He only has one shot at this.
He watched until he was nothing more than a silhouette walking among the clutter of tombstones.
Eyes on the bartender, John spoke, "so..."
An idea of the Sherlock before John was coming together for him now, bits and pieces from Lestrade's, Mrs. Hudson's, and Mycroft's first-hand accounts coalescing to reveal more and more of what he had suspected all along: that Sherlock was, and had always been, a beautifully strange man with a spectacular brain lost in a world that didn't understand him.
"Eight hours."
"So?" John could feel the vibration of his dark voice this close between them. Silver eye watching him from the corner of his turned face.
The wiry hairs peppering John's scrotum were an odd texture against Sherlock's papillae, long and coarse and unable to be kept flat, even with the application of extra saliva. The sac itself was loose and droopy like cloth and he used the tip of his tongue to burrow in and used the breadth to move it around. John couldn't catch all the sounds he was making and let out a series of breathy gasps.
"That's because /I/ haven't looked at it. E-mail it to me." Sherlock said stiffly.
Suddenly, a strange tickle came fluttering into Sherlock's stomach, and he turned to look at John's back, taking in particularly his hands. So innocent, they looked, curled together like that, but Sherlock knew full well that those hands were the hands of a knight, a farmer, a killer, a lover, and they had seen more and touched more and done more than Sherlock could ever hope to experience.
Sherlock crashes backward onto the table top, off balance with the scrambling weight atop his chest and can barely do anything but throw up his arms up to protect his face.
Prince Sherlock circled him once. Twice. Like a wolf deciding the best angle of attack for its caught prey.
It took only a moment to locate that place on John's rudimentary mental map of London. When he figured it out, his  hands stopped moving. "Are you serious?"
Sherlock welcomed the tangent easily. "It's to test my theory on the longevity of electrolytes after death. Although, it would be preferable to use a brain at the exact moment of death." He produced a small LED on a solderless puck and connected one end to his crude circuitry. "But this is going to have to suffice."
"Hm?" He didn't look up, /couldn't/ look up, focusing intently on the crosshatches depicting shadows within the cavern that was the right atrium. His throat was suddenly unbearably dry.
Since John didn't drive, he found that his fake card looked identical to the military identification card he carried with him in his wallet and if he hadn't known damn well that it was currently tucked away on his person, he could have sworn this had been it. It was a replica made so well that it even bore the identical stagnantly smiling visage of John pre-Afghanistan that he currently had on his real one. The only difference was that in place of 'WATSON, JOHN H.', it read: 'BURKE, DAVID P.'.
"Alright! I want this scene packed up!" Lestrade's pinked hands were working in a helicopter motion. "You've got twenty minutes! I want the body gone over with a fine toothed comb. Find me everything. Anderson! Don't just stand there sulking. Bag him up!"
"We have to leave now John." Sherlock says. He's looking around the empty hallway, almost as though he's expecting company at any time. "But you'll have to walk. Ambulances can't be seen anywhere near this property, they'll raise too many questions with the press. There's a car waiting for us in the underground car park, but we just need to get there. Can you walk?"
And despite the way he tried to hold onto it, each time he stopped, each time he was declined, the hope in John's chest that he would be able to accomplish this impossible task wicked away as quickly as the rain stole the heat from his body.
"However, I can tell you for a fact, John, that she is terribly unconcerned with your well-being. Her cheques arrive from the Veterans' Mental Health NHS Trust like clockwork and therefore she is totally indifferent to your showing up or not. Were you even aware that she was in the middle of writing a book about you and other repatriated veterans under her care? Her sole intention was to profit off your sacrifice, not heal you." Sherlock's face was wrecked with disgust.
And without so much as a by-your-leave, Sherlock was turning in the icy mud and tromping up the bank, up the footpath, and clear up onto the bridge at a determined pace. Leaving John standing blinking in surprise and confusion as he watched the great detective hail and duck into a passing cab before disappearing from view without looking back.
"Partially." Sherlock smirked. "While you were dithering about getting coffee orders I cross-referenced all dentists located between the places of death of both victims. Balance of probability being that he would not have strayed far from his familiar location. Only suspect to fit the description with such ostentatious hair and meet all other criteria  was HIM." Sherlock held up his Blackberry, displaying the webpage of the very office who's waiting room they were currently sitting in. A Mr. Sterling Sipe DDS in a white dress shirt sporting a shock of vivid red hair was smiling kindly back at them.
And the traitorous staircase that only spiraled right ever only revealed more blank, curving stone as it drove them up and up and up.
John said nothing, but smiled into his scent and listened as Sherlock's soft footsteps took a walk around his bed. He let his eyes shut to the new sounds of domesticity. But instead of the sound of the door, he heard the slide of a drawer and the shuffle of cloth, before he opened his eyes and realized what he was listening to. "What are you doing? Please don't touch that."
"Yes." Sherlock breathes. Putting a hand to himself and giving his cock one gentle stroke. With only that, his hips stutter. The arm that's holding him up nearly collapses beneath him and the moan escapes him that punches John straight in the groin.
"But when I was recovering in Birmingham, something else happened, something... strange.
it's been two months already? yikes! i'm sorry. have two chapters! thanks for sticking around :}
"Did you find what you were looking for?" John asked hopefully, turning on his stool to actually face him.
He had the irrational urge to flee, but there was no where to run. So John simply turned back to the diamond-patched window and tried not to die on the spot.
John nodded enthusiastically. "Of course. Yes. Sherlock, please."
A servant - who had been as silent as a ghost - slipped into the room to receive what John glimpsed to be an odd but familiarly shaped wooden object before it was immediately covered with linen and carried out.
"Fourteen minutes."
Sherlock paused completely in his work, having pushed the last of the double nails into each slice, giving them all a Frankenstein-esque quality. The alligator clips hung limply from his fingers. "There was an admitted level of uncertainty, I'll concede." He said. "But I do believe that I began with the upper hand."
And the third, god help him, was completely dry and looked nigh unbearable. John had had to tuck Sherlock's face into the crook of his neck to keep that grimace from stopping his aching hips completely.
"You are! You're bloody jealous!" John let out a sharp bark of laughter. "Of /that/ guy? Oh that is--"
He was still as beautiful as John remembered him, in fact, since having been married into a higher social class and now able to eat regular and substantial meals, he had grown even more handsome. The entire breadth of his bones had been laid over with enough flesh and muscle to make him look healthy. Virile. Gorgeous.
Sherlock let it settle like a layer of fresh snow between them, got himself and John another drink each and retook his place in his chair. He felt a small release in telling his story, having kept it bottled up and hidden in the oft forgotten passage in his brain.
John made a noise meant to be exasperation at filching other doctors' lunches when Sherlock cut him off: "Oh do relax. I left a tenner taped to the door handle. Their next lunch will be on you."
When it became clear that John still wasn't getting it, that there was possibly too much blood taking precedence in other places rather than his brain, the nibbling of Sherlock's fingers stopped and he began to direct the proceedings. "Move forward. Slowly."
John's heart restarted in his chest as he tentatively lifted his arm and waved back. His bleeding thumb making its way to his mouth.
"Yes. Now. John. I need this now." He assured, as if it wasn't clear enough. His voice was raked over coals. But something was wrong, he was slurring a bit as if he wasn't all there in his faculties yet and with /such pain/ so potent in his face it was confusing.
John immediately recited what he'd spoken about before with Sherlock. He kept the anatomical terms to a minimum, substituting in general descriptions where he could and talking around others, if only it to keep Anderson in the loop. He showed them the strangely clean underside of the skull, proving the meticulousness of the job by how the culprit even went so far as to remove the nerves and connective tissues out of the various foramina with tweezers.
"Why should THAT be interesting?" Anderson continued hottily.
"Yes, John." Then he added, just as vaguely, "Sabastopol."
Giving John a small smile, Sherlock stepped back. "I'm afraid that I was unable to properly thank you yesterday for what you did for me, John." He said. "And I feel that this is something I need to rectify."
"From there, I guess Sherlock finally left him alone. He disappeared for a while, I think he went off to college by then, but it definitely put Gregson off him for the rest of his career.
"Ap-pologize? To /Anderson/!" Lestrade was finally able to spit out.
Again, as it had been trained, it knocked twice in quick succession and finally a sharp intake of breath was its reply.
"Then flash forward to now, twenty years later, and we get that pink phone sent into the office and Sherlock solves the cold case, just like he does. Oh, Gregson went off in an aggro. Took it as a spit in the face. He gets worked up whenever anyone even /mentions/ Sherlock's name. So if he even gets a breath of him being here, he'll have my head."
The practiced ritual of making coffee for two did wonders to temper John's giddiness and settle out his nerves.
"Sherlock! John? Damnit. Where /specifically/ are you running off to? You have to tell me. Fuck! I KNEW this was going to happen!" Lestrade was clutching the sides of his head in disbelief, tufts of silver hair spiking out through his fingers as he watched their backs recede. "I asked you to keep your bloody heads down! What the hell did I expect? Ah Jesus!"
"Twenty seven hours." Sherlock had replied, fiddling with the cuff of his long blue robe. His inky hair had been a dark starburst atop his gaunt face. His long body tilted against the doorframe, perfectly at ease. He had been wearing loose pajama bottoms and an inside-out tee shirt and John was always baffled as to how he could walk around barefoot so much. His piercing eyes had been trained fixedly on John, reading him like a book.
The fire that had once roared in the large hearth opposite the bed from last night had burnt itself down to ash and embers a long time previous, leaving only the tiniest glitterings of orange to struggle up and murmur warmth.
"Yes, but you've slept with women."
"I would say that I am quite agreeable." Sherlock says back, smiling.
Without a word John took to dividing up the food, both men aware that he was putting larger and more of the portions onto Sherlock's side of the plate, but neither of them deigned to make comment.
The cow on his left lowered her head and let out a great moan, flicking her ears in displeasure as he pulled on the handles to slow her. The shadows of her ribs rippled in the light. Her hipbones cutting into the air like axe blades, swaying to and fro as she trundled forward in her yoke before reaching the edge of arable land, marked by unploughed turf.
And as if he'd found the key, the right combination; John's most private area began to unfurl before him.
It felt wrong to keep a secret from Sherlock, especially when his twilight eyes seemed to soak up every word he said and only ask silently for more.
But it was none of this that had caught John's eye.
John laughs a bit. "Mm. No. Chianti, I think. More fitting." He doesn't expect Sherlock to get The Silence of the Lambs reference and is more than a little surprised when Sherlock lifts his head and pulls back far enough to reveal a concentrated frown.
Sherlock fell into a placating roll that was just enough not /him/ to be fake. His shoulders lowering and looseness coming about his spine. "Do you mind if I come along? My boyfriend doesn't like things about his face. Previous trauma I'm afraid."
"You know you have made that impossible." Sherlock bit out from between his teeth. He had not heard from his brother directly in the four years since he had been incarcerated here. Cut off from all of the world he once knew. Only allowed out on very exceptional occasions and only to the Throne Room where he was to serve his royal duty to witness ceremonies. And always under the constant vigilance of the High Steward's armed guards.
And then he kissed him. Deeply, roughly, backing off only when John squirmed from lack of oxygen. He left him dazed in his chair, head spinning, and dropped a decimating bombshell as he pulled a small tube of lubricant from his pocket and watched John's eyebrows crumple.
After all, Afghanistan had been at the bottom of an ocean millions of years ago. Change was bound to happen.
But it did little to encourage him, for what he saw boiling around the high needle of Sherlock's tower, were pregnant thunderclouds that looked like they wanted to do nothing more than drown the earth.
"Jesus Johnny." Harry had gasped but hadn't drunk in so long her eyes had stayed dry.
He moved back to form, keeping their gazes locked. The notes flying suddenly high and tight. They ducked and weaved and fluttered and swam. They were thrown from punishing rakes that split the horsehairs (which only proved to accentuate the bounce and flash of bow) as Sherlock's face grew more and more pinched as the notes grew more and more frantic. Then the tidal music softened, slowed and his features did the same.
And William's look in return had spoken of a hope that John would find a way to forgive himself.
He could feel the exaggerated bulge of Charles' overly stuffed codpiece pressing into the back of his thigh and knew of the firm flesh that was beginning to grow inside. He could always tell by the way Charles' breathing pattern changed. Became more throaty.
The light squeeze to his root made him stop. Allowed to revel in the feeling of being anchored to that touch, yet allowed enough lead to go where he wanted. Getting a feel for being tethered.
"Still up for some coffee?" Asked John, turning back to the worktop in time with the swoop in his stomach. He heard Sherlock give a noise in agreement and slide into his chair, the distinctive snapping of a slide being replaced on the microscope's stand.
Sherlock growled at his incompetence. "The force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes. Do you get it now?"
"Highly doubtful." Sherlock sneered as John finally zipped up his jacket and breached the doorway. "As you'll be incarcerated by then. Come along John. Quick as you can."
But what about the lies? The deciets? The unworded apologies that had left John naked on the floor and regretting what they had just done together? Only to regret it more when he learned WHY it was that it had even been allowed to happen at all.
The detective only blinked in numb surprise.
"Then you shall have another. Whether you need it or not." Charles put out his hand to usher Sherlock behind the triptych screen of the wardrobe, obscuring him from the eyes of the busy servants. Before following.
Sherlock found his place in recounting and leant back to the crush of his chair. "There's hardly more to tell. Eric was a good companion. He treated me well and saw to it that I was properly cared for. Though his mollycoddling could be oppressive at times, the way yours is." He feigned ignorance to John's arching eyebrows. "It was during my time with him that I began creating my Mind Palace."
He put a hand over his eyes as he resumed his place on the couch, tucking his gown around him with the other and pointedly ignored John's disappearance into the bathroom.
"I know. I know. Just until the rain lets up." John sighed, patting her softly. The course hairs on her nose tickling his palm while her lips nibbled hopefully for more apple. "Or at first light. Whichever comes first. We'll move then."
After thorough perusal, he brushed his fingertips decidedly over the bottle of eighteen year old Chivas Regal Scotch whiskey Sherlock had received from a client as a gift long before John had lived here. He took it up and cracked the seal with a heavy sense of satisfaction. It would do nicely.
He was grateful. Eternally grateful.
"There's no point thinking about things that could have happened."
“’course I will,” John said back in surprise. “What’s the worse that can happen.”
Dear Sherlock,
"John?"
Sherlock paled in realisation. "I don't think Moriarty was particularly forgiving with her."
With gritted teeth, he wrenched the taps over full right and as the water plunged into an icy coldness so he could rinse himself off, immediately ridding him of the last of his arousal, he held proudly to the fact that he had not yelped. But only just.
Sherlock felt the hatred curl low in his belly at the smear of this reflection in the window. At the man who kept him prisoner here. But steadfastly kept his eyes upon the glass. Finding the morbid display outside to be far less foul to look upon.
"Yeah." John said, but it was an open reply, one that didn't really answer anything.
"Jesus. That's not--" John tried.
John and Miles turned back to look at each other, John giving an apologetic shrug as he got up. "Long night." Was his defense. "I'd better be off."
"I see your new garments fit you well." Sherlock said, pleased, as he gave John a once-over. "Hopefully they are to your liking."
The stretch of it stings dully. The pressure of initial resistance before the head pops in makes John's hips curl up and his knees rise into his periphery. "Sher--hmn. Sherlock." Sherlock's hands are curled around his hips and he doesn't stop his pressing until he's all the way inside.
"Ah good! Your powers of observation still have some hope yet." Sherlock said, looking pleased. "I find that it does tend to soften your regard when I've managed to upset you in some way."
Charles turned, his voice coy. "And how would you know without looking at him?"
Sherlock used the tip of his tongue first. A firm stroke up towards his scrotum and John shifted around a noise in his throat that couldn't make it past tightly bitten lips. John's body, despite its defenseless curl, tried to rock away, before it came back through sheer determination.
From its resting place, the bird could not see the rivers the castle shouldered; it could only see the breaks of their crashing waterfalls as they poured from the cliff side before it, like tears down cragged cheeks to land upon the bailey below.
The knuckles of his gauntlet flared as his hand tightened around the parcel he was to give to Prince Sherlock. This strange and simple task that had been given to him.
John chuckled, despite himself. "Sherlock, it's like zero degrees out."
It had been so long since he'd been touched like this. Full body contact. It was /glorious/.
John met his eyes again, not at all surprised by his obstinancy. "That shite cabbie with the pills."
He stared at it, utterly mesmerized. Slowly rotating the little opaque glass in his long fingers as though it were the most interesting thing in the world. He seemed to forget about John.
And brushing a hand through her soft warm fur, he closed his eyes and fell asleep with a smile on his lips. Thinking on the beauty he had truly been blessed to see.
Overcome, John's mouth is moving to Sherlock's temple and Sherlock is pushing his face back against it. John kisses  his cheek next, his lips against the wet track of his fear, then they're sliding over and across to catch Sherlock's lips which are pouted and searching and suddenly it's a raw push to see which one of them can bury themselves more deeply inside the other's passion.
Harry: You thought WRONG
Holmes nods, turning his head to kiss Watson’s palm, then leaves for the bathroom. Watson can’t help but exhale a sigh - it’s disconcerting to see a man, who had spent over two decades surrounded by corpses and crime scenes and the very scum of humanity, so shaken. In his chronicles, he will write that he had never seen Holmes so affected, seen such a depth of love in the other man’s countenance. In truth, he sees it every single time he is endangered, but it’s never been quite as bad as this.
“I love you too.”
When the orchestra arrived with their instruments, Sherlock instructed them to queue in an orderly fashion. "We're just checking for the quality of your instrument, how well you've been taking care of it, that kind of thing," he said, putting on his phoniest smile, baring his teeth, not quite reaching his eyes. "We need tonight's performance to be extra brilliant, and we just want to make sure there will be no bumps along the way."
“The puppy-dog face. The fake-innocent voice.
John is woken up the next morning by Rosie’s crying. This is nothing unusual. What is unusual is the fact that the crying continues, without sound of Mary getting up to quieten her, since it's her turn that morning .
"I'm in the consulting business. Like you!"
"Most people find it disconcerting."
Sherlock, John noticed, was copying John's actions - tilting his head, moving his jaw ever so slightly, using only the barest hint of tongue as they shared breaths (Sherlock tasted of coffee and mint toothpaste; John could only hope he didn't taste too hideous.) Soon he was kissing back expertly and independently, as though he'd been doing it for years, not minutes. John felt dizzy and held onto Sherlock tighter until Sherlock had come completely off his stool and was practically sitting in John's lap.
John grins. “Alright. Let’s go.” He puts on his coat then picks Rosie up. “Want to go out for a walk, Rosie?” He says in a soft, playful voice. “Are you going to cry and make a ruckus as soon as we enter? Annoy some posh old Tories like your daddy did when he first got in the club?” The smile she gives is nothing short of mischievous and it fills John with affection. He kisses her forehead. “That’s my girl.”
"Would it, indeed."
John sighs, praying that Sherlock won't go back home just yet and that he will forgive him, while he curses this stupid job with its stupid tables and stupid customers and stupid salary -
“Sherlock, it’s 2 am, what the hell do you want?”
"Is now a good time to say 'I told you so'?" John hisses to Sherlock.
"Only good things I hope," John smiles. "You have a lovely home, by the way."
"You did lots. More than you know, really," John replies sincerely, and then when he feels the air becoming sombre, his feelings sitting in his chest and ready to burst out, he chuckles and adds, "At least now I'm no longer limping everywhere you can experiment on what an absence of caffeine and sleep does to my physical abilities."
"Just Mary. Sorry, I'll put it down."
"Why? You love her don't you?"
Eight months of brief, scarce emails skimming over confidential details and the horrors John is witnessing. Eight months of accidentally pouring two cups of tea in the morning. Eight months of grainy skype calls, of touching his hand to John’s face on the screen, as though it would magically cure him of how utterly touch starved he had become. Funny, how quickly one became accustomed to a luxury such as touch; a kiss on the cheek in the morning, a hand on the lower back at crime scenes, an entire body to hold and press against in the now too empty, too large bed.
"Do you - do you want to talk about it?"
"You just ran all the way from Ravenclaw to Gryffindor's common room?"
"The ministry will be here shortly to take you away," Mycroft said calmly, utterly lacking in any signs of fear: the hand holding his wand was still, his voice was steady and low, he stared Moriarty straight in the eye as he then added, "you and your two cronies are under arrest for murders of multiple persons and attempted murder on a student. You can't escape now."
"You mean Mary?" Janine's tear stained face contorted into a scowl and she sniffed. "Couldn't care less about her. Her parents were Death Eaters and she's gone to work for a criminal. I'd rather just forget about her."
Sherlock gave a small smile. "Good luck." Then he left, and John was left alone in the tent with the other contestants. He went back to his sitting.
"I've come with a warning."
"What?"
"Yes. Absolutely. As long as you promise to keep my ability a secret so I won't end up abducted and experimented on by government agents?"
He knocks on the door to the building, expecting for Sherlock to open it with, hopefully, an apology for disturbing his post-shift sleep - though as far as John could tell, he didn't seem like the apologetic type. From what John could tell from their conversations last night and this morning, the man is utterly shameless, rude when he stops making the effort to be charming, and quite possibly the most interesting thing that has happened to John in months. The door soon opens, but not by Sherlock, by an older woman instead, who smiles happily and greets him, "Hello! Are you here about the flatshare?"
Sherlock shrugged. "Ravenclaw. I enjoy learning."
John nods breathlessly and all but collapses as he sits on the sofa, his head leaning back against the back of the sofa and staring at the ceiling. “She’s gone,” he says out loud to no one in particular as he lets the words sink in. “She’s gone, and now I’m here. With Rosie. And my job at the clinic.” For a moment he feels bitterness feed into his anxiety, the hatred and anger that Mary would leave him without a second thought to just how difficult the next few months or even years will be.
(See the end of the chapter for
On the final day, Sherlock and John said goodbye to Molly and Greg on the platform. Molly hugged everyone fiercely, made them promise to write to her "Especially you, Greg. You have a new job now and I want to hear all about it." Greg looked considerably less tired and ill than he did when John had first seen him in the infirmary room, but he still seemed in no mood to be working. Still, a job was a job and he had had it available for months now, as he had reasoned when his new bosses had visited him to offer him time off.
Tiana went on to describe the necklace- a blue and purple charm on a black string - and that she last had it two days ago in the Forbidden Forest, having worn it during a Magical Creatures lesson. Sherlock nodded then left for the forest, John by his side, assuring the girl he would have it by the next morning.
"When."
Yours sincerely
Sherlock complied and crossed his legs as he sat up. John sat down in front of him and took out the antibacterial wipes from his kit. "This may sting a little." He said, as he applied the wipes to Sherlock's cut. The boy barely winced. Maybe it was a high tolerance to pain. Maybe the alcohol had numbed his nerves.
“But - “ But what about me, John almost asks petulantly.
"Calm down, he's outside somewhere."
"...No."
I've decided to split what was going to be a super long chapter in two. Chapter 4 should hopefully be up soon!
"Dad, not now," John cuts in, discreetly pressing his hand against Sherlock.
John managed to sneak into the backstage area (and by sneak in, he actually played the ‘brother of the playwright card’ so he could walk in backstage with the guard’s willing permission), making his way down corridors until he found the dressing room with Mark’s name on it. He knocked on the door.
Out of the corner of Sherlock's eye, as he sat slumped against the wall, rasping out breaths and pressing the palms of his hands against his forehead, three spiders exited the castle and made their way out into the darkness.
"No, we knew before then."
“He’s shit at it, but at least he does it for free. So yeah, there’s nothing more we can do until the actual party." John held his hand out for Sherlock to take when he stood up. "Let's go home and change."
“I hear that’s a universal experience among fathers, about how they feel about becoming one. ‘Women become mothers when they find out they're pregnant, men become fathers when they see their child for the first time.’”
to our daughter, are looking pretty fucking in the present to me."
"Oh, of course, how could I be so stupid, that automatically redeems you of breaking school rules."
"I know. If you don't watch out you're going to be replaced." John joked.
I haven't been too bad here in France. Yes, it is sunnier here than in Scotland. Shocking. Mummy has been trying to get me to 'enjoy the sunshine' and not 'lock myself away in my room'. What she doesn't realise is that I've been 'locking myself away' for my own health and safety. I burn very easily, and who knows the kind of impact that has on my health? Not to mention the vast number of times my being outdoors has led to scrapes and fights and all sorts. (Though that was more to do with my general personality than being outdoors.) But surely, as a mother, she should care about the well-being of her son???)
He quickly adjusts Sherlock's pillows, pulls the duvet up to cover his exposed chest, feeling himself be watched curiously as he did so, then leaves the room before the conversation can delve deeper into the dangerous subject of
"Yeah." Janine sat in thought for a second. "Are you worried about John?"
Janine shrugged and smirked, which Sherlock decided to ignore. "Where is he? This boy?"
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock, what are you trying to say?" John's voice cracked nervously. "Are you breaking up with me?"
Thank you all for all your comments/kudos!
Checking John's pulse had become all too familiar to him by this point, as had the relief at the steady thrum of life pumping slowly through John's wrist. He was comatose still, now that he no longer had any curses holding him up and opening his eyes.
that you've decided to date boys."
Moriarty cackled. "Oh, I forget how young you are! I think we need to talk."
The eagle's eye shined brighter and seemed to glare right through John, analytical, judgemental. Like Sherlock, he thought to himself. Despite the feeling of discomfort and self-consciousnesses in his throat, John clenched his fist and kept eye contact with the door knocker. Eventually the door opened, and John breathed a sigh of relief. "Thanks." He said
"My friend was the one who wrote an article about him. He's very clever. A little rude, she said, but very intelligent. And interesting. You must feel a little insecure - hanging around him, being in his shadow all the time - "
"Come on, John, my readers don't pay five knuts per paper to read about medical school. Use your imagination."
Something got caught in Mary's throat. She swallowed it down before replying, sounding braver than she felt, "You must be mistaking me for someone else. I'm not Miss Adams. I'm - "
“Goodnight, John.”
“Yes, I am aware. But why is that an issue? You can go out with babies. Or we could leave her with Mrs Hudson.”
"What? Oh, I don't know. Probably a healer in the wizarding world but my mum wants me to take a muggle course in basic medical care..."
Sherlock visits, occasionally. He says hello to John and Mary, if she’s home from work, then to Rosie, who is always pleasant in his company (a small victory over Mary, whose friends cause Rosie to scream and wail in protest whenever they hold her.) Sherlock gives vague answers to John’s questions about cases: it’s the quiet season, only fours and fives, bank robberies and adulteries, but hey ho, needs must when one is in need of some more money.
John scoffs bitterly, recalling his optimism on the morning of that day. "I know the feeling."
“‘Lawyer’,” Sherlock repeated with a scoff. “No. I don’t have a name for what I do yet, but essentially I’m a detective.”
John lay starfished on the bed, snoring softly, wearing nothing but his red briefs and dog tags. Sherlock observed him, made random, dizzying deductions that fled as quickly as they came: jet-lagged, sleep-deprived, has been travelling since early this morning. Frequent exercise out in the sun in full uniform - in the light from the bathroom, his face was sun-beaten, tanned, while his chest, arms and legs remained as pale as when he had been living in London, though much, much more muscle hardened. All this didn’t even matter - John was
"Alissia, be a dear would you?"
"I - I don't know. I've never actually..."
“Now there’s the sarcastic John Watson we know and love," Bill chuckled. "It’s good, it shows you’re recovering.”
“Yes.” John’s voice came out low and rough. “Very much awake.”
“You wouldn’t have.”
"Oh, because that's the most ridiculous part of this conversation!"
"Why on earth would I do that?"
John's face softened and smiled. "Really?"
"That was before Sherlock. Before I got my journal. Besides, Tilly was from when I was
Go easy on your older brother though. Us older siblings have a lot of shit to deal with and we've been sort of forced into the older brother/third parent role. He probably got a lot of 'you need to set a good example' and 'you're too old to be *insert perfectly acceptable behaviour here that the younger sibling would totally get away with at the same age*' over the years. I know this because I have a younger sister called Harry, but you could probably already tell that, smart thing like you.
"Do you?"
“It’s not the same, though. After two months of seeing you nearly every day and practically moving into your room, it’s a big change. It’s weird.”
John seems vaguely impressed by even this simple bit of deception. Then again, being surrounded by incompetent humans for millenia, who think it’s a talent to rub their stomachs and pat their heads simultaneously, must put these things into perspective. “God of the underworld, right?”
Violet eyes met turquoise, and all John could think, as he offered his phone was,
The fifth. "Alex Laurens. 3 miles."
"Absolutely." Slughorn wrote something down on his notepad, then moved to the front of the classroom to address the class. John looked over at Sherlock, to find he was staring at him and grinning. John matched his expression. "Well, class, the majority of you did very well indeed. I have very high hopes for your NEWTS next year. Your grades will be sent to you at breakfast on Friday. You are dismissed."
Slumped in their seats, was Yanovich, his wife, and his two children, each with a dart in their neck.
"Freak here isn't the only one with deduction skills. And I deduce," Donovan smirked, "You two were off in some dark corner somewhere, snogging."
“Yes, But so are you.”
Sherlock nodded slowly.
A sharp punch to the cheekbone.
Sherlock is still asleep, curled up, practically contorted in his chair in a position that makes John wince in sympathy. He imagines that he has been here all night, or for however long he has been asleep for, pacing the waiting room floor then claiming his territory in the chair next to John, refusing to move.
Irene: Long story short, we’re going to co-direct the Only Valid™ production of Twelfth Night, and we want you to be in it as Antonio
"Research? Hearing?" John winced. "Sorry, I shouldn't ask so many questions."
“Two pounds ten, please.”
"He talks a lot to me. Or writes, even. Well, that is apart from recently."
John: I thought Twelfth Night was a comedy???
"Really?"
"Is John Mary's boyfriend?" Sherlock tried to conceal the waver in his voice as he spoke. "Are they... Going out?"
"Phillip? Phillip Anderson?"
The bed is hot and stuffy with the temperature of the two bodies, and John is sometimes woken up by an elbow nudging against his skin or the weight of a limb on his stomach or the tickle of curls against his nose, but each time he wakes up, he smiles and settles down to sleep with one thought in his head.
Previous summers had been...lonely at best. Each year, for two weeks, they hired out the same villa in the South of France, next to a beach and with a swimming pool. Sherlock was not interested in swimming, and the beach was too full of irritating tourists and Mr Holmes insisting on throwing a ball at him, as though any sane human would derive pleasure from catching and throwing balls. From the ages of one to eleven, Sherlock had had Mycroft for company, either to play games with - mostly Pirates - or to help with experiments (or, in one memorable summer, to be the subject of experimentation, particularly on the reaction of the human digestive system to the consumption of seawater. The results were messy and Mrs Holmes had banned experimenting on family members thenceforth. Sherlock hadn't dared to argue but it was well worth it. Particularly as a suitable punishment for Mycroft abandoning Sherlock for university in Oxford the following autumn.) After Mycroft stopped going on family holidays to focus on work, Sherlock had only his books and boredom. That was until he had his soulmate journal to talk to John with. And now, this year, John was here himself, not just as words on a page or a voice in a phone.
"Didn't he?" Lestrade asked. "He's a nice guy, and all, but someone must have had reason to hurt him."
"You know what."
"No. But they're your friends, and comparatively speaking, your evening has been a lot worse than mine. You like them, and you often go to them when you're in a bad mood or when you need support. I'm guessing that has been rather frequent due to issues at home. And I think, if they're good enough for you to trust them enough to do that, they're good enough for me."
“Runs in the family. Father to son. Y chromosome.”
"Yes. I'm just thinking...I owe you a lot of compliments now."
"You're okay." He whispered. "John. You're going to be fine." He didn't get a response. Not even a twitch of the finger.
"I was mostly locked in my room reading. My choice."
They part ways, both grinning, and it’s only when Sherlock gets to his room that he realises he forgot to ask for John’s number.
Sherlock watched John's face morph as he skim-read through the article - from fear to neutral to disgust to anger. "I did not say that!" He shouted eventually.
"I don't sulk." Sherlock frowned stubbornly.
"Not...not exactly. People actually have to be there. For hugs and sympathetic smiles and all that."
John there. He needed his voice to ground him, his hand on his shoulder, his dark eyes to spot something obvious that Sherlock had looked over when searching for the smaller details. But a part of him predicted that meeting Mary would be dangerous, that she'd be defensive, incalculable in her behaviour, though he never thought she'd be actively seeking harm. Anger was usually the best way to get John to safety.
"Just forget all about it." Mary shrugged (her hand was still on John's and Sherlock was still uncomfortable), "I believe in fresh starts. And I think it will be nice for us," her voice changed and Sherlock's fist clenched at the added seduction and sweetness in her voice, "To renew everything."
"Are you jealous?"
John shakes his head. "And I went and brought you into it. And Harry too. God, I should have just done this on my own. I did nothing but make you both feel super uncomfortable." John sighs. "I'm a crap brother and a crap boyfriend."
Moran is the most probable person to have stabbed John.
"Just a job," she shrugs. "A little after Sherlock's return from exile, I got a very good offer from an old friend of mine that I couldn't refuse. Sherlock's head, delivered to his front door, for thirty million. That's more than you can possibly dream of, John. You can't judge, we were both getting a little bit bored of each other by the end." He has to agree. "But I couldn't just leave. Despite what you think, I do care about you and what you think of me."
“So what do you think?” Hopkins came into the room finally, John behind her. Sherlock finally approached and crouched beside the dead body.
Sherlock has disappeared into his room to call Mycroft, leaving John with a shell-shocked Joseph. He has no idea how to proceed, whether he should tell Joseph the truth or just send him on his merry way.
“Really? Oh, so he has. Didn’t realise.” Liar, Sherlock thinks with amusement. “Best stitch him up just in case.” And just to confirm Sherlock’s suspicions, the doctor looks up with dark blue eyes that widen in recognition as they look straight. At. Sherlock.
"Mary taught me in the summer. Pretty impressive, right?"
"Not to me! I don't forget things accidentally! I'm not like you ordinary people where information flies over my head. Especially not chemistry. I like chemistry. I'm good at it. But then I went and fucking forgot the metal that produces a lilac flame like an idiot."
The heartbroken people are the second most common faction of the people John finds in the coffee shop; the ones kicked out of the flat in the middle of the night, or avoiding their girlfriends as they contemplate whether to break up with them while they drink their latte (or a Whole Latte Love, as the drink is ironically named). The women crying into their phones as they pick at a chocolate muffin, conflicted and upset and with stories gradually less interesting to eavesdrop on as the evening wears on. It gets tiresome listening to sobbing for hours on end, and it gets to a point where John couldn't help but glance at the clock, silently begging it to go faster so he can go back to the flat and sleep for a little while.
Dear Sherlock
When he reached his dorm room, he was the only one there. He suspected every one else was off celebrating.
“Any person. Of any kind.”
In reality, John was the one who couldn’t express his feelings, hiding them away and bottling it all up until he felt like he was burning inside. Sherlock made himself clear and was willing to fight for whatever they had. But, John was absolutely terrified, and he pushed him away.
You constantly need distractions and experiments to occupy that brilliant mind of yours. I don’t fool myself into thinking that I am somehow a permanent part of your life. My novelty will eventually fade and I’ll be left to pick up the pieces when you realize that. JW
When John walked up to Sherlock, he turned around and looked at John excitedly. “This is the actual letter,” Sherlock pointed to the faded, scrawled writing. The letter that Jack the Ripper allegedly wrote.”
Her name was Anna. Big green eyes with long blonde hair. John liked everything about her, she was kind, funny, smart, and she always supported him. They’d been dating for two years now.
John stared. “Excuse me? What about you?,” his voice was rising, “I’m not the one who abandoned you Sherlock, you were the one who stopped talking to me.”
John’s smile grew. “You’re welcome.”
3.	He was scared shitless.
“He’s just irritating,” John said, trying to compose himself and not say anything stupid. This was not the time.
Greg and Mike were in rugby as well, so he said that Sherlock would finally be coming to this match.
b) Ernest T Bass
“Same as always?” The barista asked across the shop.
The strangest thing was, during the summer, John’s life almost went back to normal. Of course he still thought about his mad roommate far more than what’s healthy, but John felt that maybe things were sliding back to what they were before Sherlock.
John swallowed, a mild shiver going down his spine.
“Oh right,” Sherlock scoffed, standing up and fully facing John. “You tried so hard that you couldn’t even look me in the eyes after what happened in the garden.”
John looked up and saw Irene. He forced down his tidal wave of emotions and smiled at her. “I’m waiting for my mom to get here.”
Sherlock’s 16
“What store?”
“Yes,” John replied warily. The voice over the phone was calculated and sharp.
“Now, you guys will pair up and start the project that’s due the end of this week. You can choose any case that involved modern day forensics and make a presentation that covers the biological aspects and a case study of the crime.”
He smirked. “I am far more intelligent then the Neanderthals at the station. I’ve already cracked over thirty police cases.”
Sherlock finally looked at John and his eyes were wide with fear. “How is it fine?” Sherlock hissed. John was reminded of a feral dog snapping when people got too close. “You’ve made it abundantly clear that you’re not gay.”
Seeing that Sherlock was about to do something stupid like phone his counselor saying John had small pox, John sat up and tried to distract him up by asking about the case.
He could hardly believe the boy who was currently laughing so hard he couldn’t speak was the same boy he’d first met in the morning. Already, Sherlock seemed to be a study in contrasts.
John thought about the hundreds of late night conversations they’ve had on his bed, sometimes they were thoughtful, other times utterly pointless.
Wrapped up in his worries, he doesn’t notice the cupid statue in front of him.
(Sat 3:13am)
You think my type is people with strange fascinations with dead things? JW
Then he felt his stomach lurch again, and he barely made it to the bin before he vomited up the alcohol and the one sandwich he ate the day before. After he stopped gagging, he leant back and wiped the perspiration off his face. He felt no better. Actually, it was fair to say he felt like complete shit.
Sherlock snorted. "Your pillow talk leaves rather a lot to be desired, John."
He looked at the clock next to him and saw that students would still be in their classrooms, learning whatever the hell John had missed (what had he missed? How long was he in a coma for?). Even so, there was normally a low hum of life that spread from the classrooms through the echoey halls, gossip and laughter and discussions and debates creating a buzz that spread throughout the old castle. But today, the first day John had been present for several days, it was silent, like the castle was thinking, contemplating, mourning.
"Okay, thank you, Harry! We'll be in my room if you need us."
Oh, God.
The other side of her reminded the other that this is not just about the boy. This could be an escape from the everyday mundaneness of France and Beuxbatons and its restrictions. This could be a chance to learn things her school wouldn't dare teach, improve her potential in the things she had learnt in her days working for her parents.
He steps in with a sigh, tactfully ignoring the weird smells of the street and the hopefully dead rat lying in the gutter outside. When John asks for Sherlock’s room number, or rather, William Sigerson’s, the man at the desk barely glances away from the tv screen except to look at the list of names, not even asking John why he’s there or who he is. Security is lacking, but given the circumstances, that’s probably for the best. It’s difficult to protect someone several floors away stuck in reception or kicked out onto the streets.
"It's John. John Watson?"
Thirty-five, thirty-four, thirty-three...
shoot you."
"Did people actually believe that?" John asked incredulously. Sherlock shook his head.
"Victor turns out to be a complete /connard/ and your feelings for John remains strong and unrequited."
“No, it’s alright.” John shrugs. “I don’t mind.”
Your friend,
Comforted, John does his best to settle the nervous twisting of his stomach, and focuses instead on the comforting weight of Sherlock's hand on him, his body heat bleeding through his shirt, Sherlock's eyes on him, and only him. They sway for the next song, and the next one, and the next one, until the room felt like it was spinning, as though they had been turning. They are pressed closer together now, practically chest to chest as Sherlock's thumb strokes smooth circles into John's skin, a soft caress.
"Hello Sherlock. Lovely to see you." She pressed.
John's legs ratcheted up from beneath them automatically, knowing without asking. Strong thighs skittering up lean flanks. Black pupils blooming across blue until they were the only color to be seen under half sunk eyelids. Desperately needy for absolution. "It's not your fault."
Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow at the obvious redirection. "I have."
But still.
"Mm. Excellent." John steals one last kiss before pushing himself up and holding there.
John takes his time to admire the strong yoke of his shoulders, the wild crown of his black hair, the kiss of his swollen lips and the kaleidoscope eyes that make John never want to leave this bed ever again in his life. And he feels a bit of pride radiate through him that /he/, of all people, gets to be the sole collector of such beauty.
Eyebrows knitted in confusion, Sherlock tips his head towards John and breaks out into a smile when John lifts his chin to gently kiss the supernova on his forehead. He lets his lips linger there, breathing in his scent.
"No." He let Sherlock guide his hand back up to slide his fingers through his hair again, burying his mouth against John's to stem any possible follow up. When John's eyebrows didn't unknit, Sherlock broke off. "I'm fine. You know the rules."
John also had the sneaking suspicion that Sherlock was considering himself untenable now that his body had revealed its apathy towards sex. As if it were some broken thing that he merely got on with. And with a sinking feeling, John guessed that this was the first time he'd ever let someone willingly see it. That he'd /allowed/ someone to see it.
"There's nothing further I can think of for us to do." Sherlock said with an upset breath. "We've no choice but to wait and observe. However loathsome that plan of inaction. That dealer had no information of any value, the club itself was a dead end, and tonight, overall, has been a waste of time." He grumbled. "I had Lestrade send us copies of all pertinent information regarding the two previous shoving victims and anything else they had on Sterling Sipe that may be of use to us. I'm missing something. I know it. I just don't know WHAT. It's aggravating."
Sherlock surfaced with a pained gasp, breathing panickally from the shocking cold. "Stay clear! There's something down here!" He twisted this way and that, flinging wild sprays of water from his hands and hair. He slogged a few paces forward, dropped to his knees with a horrible squelch, and shuffled like a raccoon with searching hands beneath the brown water. Great puffs of hoary breath clouded out from his mouth. "Here! There's a body!" He held his hand stiffly beneath the water, marking the place as the first of the reluctant officers stepped into the frigid water at Lestrade's pointed nod in that direction.
He's addressing the lump that's currently curled up in enough bedsheets to only leave the wild splash of hair peaking out.
John shuts he telly off and sighs. A sense of finality settling over him and he lets a smile flash onto his lips before melting away. He pushes up from his chair. "If you'll excuse me, I'll be just a minute." He says, getting only wide eyes and a heavy nod as he heads back towards the kitchen with two empty mugs to put in the sink.
"You look tired." Sherlock corrected and got down upon his knees in all his fine clothes next to a pitcher and small scrap of cloth that had been purposefully left upon the floor. "As if you have been for a very long time, perhaps since you were born."
He looked over the flat while standing at the bottom of the stairs. At the brocade wallpaper, the tilting pile of vinyl records, the bison skull, and the mad genius working trails into the soft hardwood floors, letting it fill him.
Sweet molten arousal burst anew through John's loins. His mouth finding purchase in the swirling depths of Sherlock's hair once again. He scraped his teeth against Sherlock's scalp. Sherlock had been planning this almost all day. "How else? Did you do anything else? Tell me."
"John." Sherlock addresses John's knees, his free hand tightening into a fist. His voice is a firm whisper. He's too distracted by the anger he harbours for himself to acknowledge the compliment. "I would not have done it if I'd had any other choice. Please believe me. All possibilities-- if there had only been some other way--it was the only way I could--"
As he waited for a reply to his text, the radio bled into his ears.
Like his head was a ball of slime, oozing out of every orifice. His nose was plugged, his eyes were weepy, and his ears rang constantly. He had two spears of tissue shoved deep into his nostrils to stem the outflow, balls of used toilet paper crumpled about him on the floor like snowballs. He was unable to do anything but breathe raggedly out of his mouth now.
"He was living and working at a house in Camden, which served as a distribution center for narcotics. He did lifting, loading, and unloading. And although he was hired for his muscle; he was patently useless in fistfights. I had just voluntarily released myself from the latest rehabilitation clinic Mycroft had checked me into and immediately went to ground to find my next high. If you're going to keep making that face at me John, I'd prefer to stop speaking about it."
The bird had learned to trust him enough to come within touching distance now; but it was still clearly far too skittish to feed from his hand. More experiments would have to be carried out. But it appeared that perhaps by Summer's end, hand feeding could be achieved.
Warm regards.'
It was John's turn to laugh inappropriately now. Entirely without humor. The noise that came out was loud and shocking, like a flock of birds suddenly bursting out into the sky. "Ehm, no. Nooo. We're stopping." He said, not even considering it with a shake of his head.
"No." Sherlock's voice was soft when he spoke again, his head bobbing in a nod as he came to his own decision. His fingers pressed back against his chin solemnly. "You shall address me as Sherlock from now on Sir John. That is my name, after all. In the presence of others you may call me 'your Highness' but when it is just you and I alone as I foresee it will be for a long while, you will call me by my name. Do you understand?"
Sherlock's tongue stayed in place, his hands coming up to hold John's hips still as his intentions gave way to kissing and suckling. Immediately, John tried to touch himself, wanting to disrupt the rawness of it all, the total realization that this was really happening and it might be more than he could handle, but he was met with long thin fingers gently squeezing his wrist and guiding them away.
“Really?”
"Sebby here has been a great help to me." Moriarty explained to Alissia, "smuggling me into the castle, giving me food and drink, helping me with my plan."
“Come on, be a little optimistic. Has Mycroft told you anything?”
“No. She doesn’t even know. No one does outside of the family. And you.”
"Just water, please. Can't stand alcohol. Vile stuff."
Looking through the recent list of the dead and their pictures in their files, Sherlock fails to find anything appealing about the modern style. All plain and repetitive and mass produced, with ugly logos stuck to the corner of every shirt. The business men in their suits, though polar opposite to this style, remind him of Mycroft too much to want to mimic. However, after a couple of hours of rummaging through files, he finds a male model, 32, dead by drug abuse, in a fetching purple shirt and trousers that aren’t completely hideous. His robes immediately transform at will, and suddenly there was no logical barrier keeping him from taking the holiday Mycroft had ordered.
"And I'm - "
"How original -
“Alright then. What did we watch last Thursday? The one with the archeologist and the boulder and the nazis.”
"John!" Mary beamed,  "Sit down. You too, Sherlock."
“As long as Mycroft continues to hog the library for his stupid video conferences with the stupid prime minister, I’ll say what I want. What about you? How’s your family?”
“Bye-bye!” Sherlock shuts the door then sighs and collapses back onto the sofa.
John’s head lifted up immediately at that voice - God, that voice. Could it be?
He can feel it in the way he leans on Holmes for support as he climbs up the seventeen steps to 221b, each one feeling like a mountain in of itself. He feels it in how all his limbs ache and his eyelids fall heavy, drained of adrenaline until he is fuelled only by his own pride -because, damn it Holmes, he's not some child or blushing bride to be carried. He feels it in how although it is barely one in the morning, in the aftermath of a case, with all the tenants of Baker Street asleep, he feels no lust, no urgency to rid himself and Holmes of their clothes, no need for an energetic and passionate night to remind themselves that they are here and alive. Instead, he is simply tired.
Sherlock begrudgingly took a chicken drumstick and nibbled at it. 'I don't enjoy this part of our dynamic.'
He wanted to wake John up, talk to him for hours and hours until his throat ached about the case and Afghanistan and just how much he’d missed him. He wanted to curse him for leaving and beg him to stay, to not even leave this room or this bed ever again. He wanted to kiss him and strip him down and tease him until he was a pleading, writhing mess beneath him, incapable of leaving his side. He wanted to embrace him and never let go and whisper in his ear over and over -
"You fucking what?"
"There was a serial killer near where Sherlock lives over the summer." John explained to Mary, "Stabbings."
“Well, maybe eventually.”
"Did John mention me?" Sherlock asked, surprised.
“Oh, really - “
“Stop that, you know I don’t like it when you mimic my voice.”
John let go of the bed frame, then slowly, slowly took a step forward. That went well, so he took another. At this point he collapsed, his knee buckling as his arm shot out to the bed frame to keep himself upright. “Fuck!”
"Oh. That's...nice."
“Sherlock? You ok?”
"Well, sleeping won't help. I've tried it. I don't exactly forget what's happened."
“Yeah. I know.” John sniffs and grins. “Christ, I’m exhausted. It’s been a long day. Sorry, it’s making me a bit - y’know.”
“It’s going at a surprisingly cheap rate. The damp apparently. It will free up my bedroom for your use and Rosie can have your old room. It might take a couple of months so hopefully you wouldn’t mind sharing a room with your baby - “
"Have you been busy solving crimes?" Samantha asks curiously.
"I will."
"But - "
“We’ve done nothing but talk since we got here. Can you just take my word for it that I’ve wanted to do that for quite some time and the fact that you’ve kept remarkable abilities successfully hidden from me has only augmented my attraction to you, so we can get to the more interesting part?”
We haven't visited any museums but father is keen on seeing a cathedral nearby. I can't remember what he said was so interesting about it and nor do I want to. I've found that if he wants to start talking history I have no choice but to block it from my mind, for the sake of my will to live. But so far on holiday, we've done little except stay near the villa. I'm perfectly content to stay here for as long as possible, and not go to any historic towns or cathedrals or anything else outside. And no, I don't plan on eating any snails. Father has tried to convince me to try one and get over my 'fussy eating'. Frankly, I don't see anything abnormally fussy about not wanting to eat garlic covered slime.
As they eat together in silence and the hangover is elevated, John finally is able to think, all his thoughts rushing back at once as he freezes mid-bite on a gingerbread man's arm.
Sherlock took the tie hanging around John's neck and started to tie it, while saying instructions as he did it. John probably should have taken notice - for future reference - but currently, his mind could only focus on how close they were standing and the baritone tones of Sherlock's voice. Then when Sherlock's finger's skimmed the base of John's neck, very lightly, he flinched.
"It's hardly grave, Holmes," Watson grits out, his teeth clenched as the graze on his leg protests. "I'm fine."
Thanks so much everyone for all the positive feedback!
"Then why haven't you been replying to my letters?"
"Whatever it is it can't be that bad - "
like you. I just...had to warm up to you a bit. And now I have."
"Caring, Sherlock," a sing-song voice sighed, Mycroft in the room now. A reminder. "You need to focus. Besides, the knife went quite deep into him, did it not?"
You're Brewtiful
"My mum is an important Minister."
"Worse."
"Yes, well, I only have a landlady and a detective inspector who only tolerates my presence because I do his job for him without taking credit, though he insists otherwise."
I've been practicing my deductions now to try and pass the time and calm my thoughts. The woman across from me is having her cat neutered, has 3 children and is expecting a 4th, ate a bacon sandwich for breakfast this morning and is unhappily married. The man she keeps trying to make eye contact with is actually very much happily married, an editor at a company, and is here because he's getting the puppy he's buying for his soulmate checked up. There's a young girl whose parents are both at work concerned about her guinea pig's lack of appetite.
Sherlock blinks owlishly. "Sorry?"
“I have a hangover. I get a free pass.”
"Molly?" He looked up at her.
"Gosh, you know just what to say to make a guy feel special."
Janine whispered in Mary's ear, and she laughed. "Janine just said that you're avoiding the question because you can't admit that she'll probably beat you."
The Milverssen, stood stoic and still in front of him, was, as John had suspected from the photograph, colourless and greasy, like an old man's hair after several weeks without it being washed. It seemed much, much bigger up close, though it was still only five foot. And as ever, its eyes were grey and piercing, except now up close, it was more shark-like than human-like. John couldn't bear to keep looking, but he didn't have the guts to tear his eyes away, like he was frozen, jinxed in place.
"Opening the letter was one thing."
"Can I get the - ugh," he grimaces, now noticing the names of the drinks on the board. John can't blame his reaction, but he chuckles anyway in the sadistic way most people do at the knowledge that someone else hates a bad joke. "The espresso, please."
"I don't know how your therapy goes, but normally thinking about hypothetical scenarios is not something most people advise."
I’ve been on this train for half an hour and already I miss you like crazy. I don’t know how we’re going to survive being in desperate countries for weeks on end. It seems dramatic, because surely we should be used to this by now, but at least at sixth form we could see each other almost every other weekend. I have no idea what the work load will be like and...
"Come on, even you have to admit there's something romantic about that," John points out. "They were obsessed with each other for two years. And even then it took them a whole month of writing to realise who it was they were writing to."
"Mmh, I can tell by the appalling sense of humour. Go get a coffee before you collapse."
Irene: Harry and I have a very specific vision for the play so we’d be interested to hear your takes
John grinned. "Come on, we can't stay in this tent forever. People will be wondering where we are."
“Yes. How did you know?”
"Yeah. All four of them. They're lucky, though. It seems to me like it was a quick, painless death. Whoever did this, they left no potential for survival. Or witnesses." Except me, John thought to himself bitterly. He should have seen this. How could he have missed the darts flying towards them? It should have been as obvious as anything.
"Not everything."
“You imbecile! You complete and utter imbecile!”
"He's an Irish red settler. Hence the name. He's smart. Loyal. Loves going on adventures. We used to explore the nearby woods and fields together looking for treasure. Or we'd just talk. I'd talk, even. He can't talk. He was my only friend - John how is this helping, this has only exacerbated my emotional state."
"On what?"
"How dramatic."
John pauses in thought then nods. "Fine. Let's do this." He picks up the scalpel in one hand, then grins at Sherlock. "You're going down, Holmes."
"Oh."
"It's fine." Sherlock didn't look up from the intestines.
Or was his attacker still in the castle, still stalking the halls and striking at his prey?
"Assuming that Moran doesn't." Sherlock added.
“Of course, you’re wonderful company, Redbeard. The only person I can talk to around here who isn’t obligated to respect me just because I rule over them. You don’t complain. You don’t cry about your wasted lifetime and your mortal regrets. You don’t beg to be reunited with your long-lost love who isn’t even dead yet. But still, sometimes I wonder…”
"Oh, don't worry, I have a translation potion with me. Come on, Miss, this way." Janine stood up from her chair and followed Kiara out of the room with no sign of nervousness.

Harry: That’s precisely what Sebastian thinks.
"Mmh-hm. Sure, Sally." Molly scoffed.
"What about it?" Sherlock replies casually without looking up from his plate. It makes John want to scream with frustration.
"Sherlock, hi. It's me." John's voice said softly, barely above a whisper.
John joining Sherlock on the Family Holiday meant that the two of them had two whole weeks - weeks! Not days! - of each others' company. Two weeks of waking up with John, having breakfast with John, swimming with John, walking with John, sleeping with John. Sherlock’s life was thoroughly consumed. And somehow, in that time, they didn’t fall out even once. Sherlock had expected to become irritated by something at some point - John's gentle snoring which he adamantly denied, his early-bird behaviour every single morning, any reason at all - but it never occurred. John, meanwhile never stopped grinning adoringly at him, even when Sherlock brought back dead crabs and starfish from the beach in a bucket to dissect, and then made their hotel room smell of fish for the next 48 hours.
"Rich?"
"I wasn't. You're the first."
John laughs then presses his lips to Sherlock's in a lingering kiss, long and loving and indulgent as he had wanted to the entire evening, no one there but the two of them - until the door opens suddenly, and the boys leap apart, as though the other is on fire. Mrs Watson stands by the door, looking as equally bashful as the two boys.
“Not the Prime Minister?”
I miss you.
"Yeah." There are several moments of awkward silence, with just the sound of Mrs Watson fiddling with her lighter, Sherlock and John stood apart with their lips burning, John's stomach twisting in shame. He clears his throat. "So, we'll be getting back in - "
"Slight change of plan," Sherlock explains. "I need my coat."
“Is there anything about uni you miss that is not to do with me?”
"Who d'you get?"
Sherlock groaned in protest but rolled over onto the bit of mattress next to him, lying on his side and facing John, a pink blush high on his cheeks from exertion. He looked younger, and John fancied he could see a kind of glow on him. “You know, if I hadn't strolled up to a crime scene high as a kite one day, I wouldn't have met Lestrade or become a consulting detective. And if I didn't go to rehab, I wouldn't have improved on my deduction skills so quickly to cope with the boredom."
"Yes, I know. Your name appears on the screen when you call, you know."
“But that’s the only reason?”
19:42 Sorry. SH
