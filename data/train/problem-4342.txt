“Cas, it’s a corporate party. Yeah, there’ll be some prudes here and there, but I’m sure-”
While on the way to Dean’s room, Sam’s attention was pulled towards the only ajar bedroom door — Castiel’s, left open in his haste, no doubt, to follow Dean out of the bunker that morning. With Dean’s folded letter pulling him forwards like some sort of homing device, Sam entered Cas’s room. He was met, as expected, by nothing.
Your closure
“Alright, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Sam tossed one of the bars into the back seat for Cas. It was, according to the wrapper, birthday cake flavoured. Castiel placed it to the side and leaned forwards to watch Dean biting into his. The expression on Dean’s face turned from happy anticipation to disappointment as soon as the ice cream touched his tongue.
The last bits of daylight withdrew slowly through the white curtains across the window, casting the two beds deeper into darkness. Sam, on his bed against the far wall, remained motionless. He'd fallen into an unmoving sleep shortly after his head hit the pillow, and Cas was certain that he would awake well rested. Dean, however, continued to move. He would toss his arm onto the pillow over his head, stay still for a few breaths, then turn over to lie the other way. His legs tangled in the blankets, then untangled and disappeared beneath them once more. His breaths were uneven.
Written as a follow-up for chapter 4 of this fic.
With the ice-cream bars hugged against his chest, Castiel leaned against the side wall, his eyes fluttering nearly closed. The ray of sunlight had stretched, fallen across his toes. Dean’s light words filtered like honey through the air. The cars outside made low noises like the tide lapping on the shore. The door opened, a bell tinkling with the motion.
The other option, though, was even worse.
“I’m-” Cas mumbled. He’d been caught, and like the idiot that he was, he hadn’t thought to come up with any excuse. “I didn’t mean to wake you.” Cas pulled his hand away from beneath Deans, and it hurt like an angel blade to the heart. He started to push himself off the bed.
“He doesn’t love you, you know,” Castiel told himself.
“Castiel,” Dean placed one palm on Cas’s cheek, his hand warm and gentle and calloused. Cas leaned into it. All he wanted was to stay here, to really be a part of the family. To never be asked to leave again. To have a real home.
Dean’s expression had opened up into something like shock: his lips were parted and his eyes wide. His hand continued wiping at his demon knife, although the rag was coated and at this point he was mostly just smearing the blood back and forth.
Cas leaned forwards farther towards the impala’s windshield. He wanted to watch the road disappear beneath the front tires. One of his legs was moving up to get underneath him, to push him further forwards, when he felt pressure against his shoulder.
He wants what's only yours
The crashing of breaking glass alerted Dean to movement behind him. A vamp had climbed up onto the table, knocking over one of the white vases. It showed its eerie teeth and poised to leap at Dean. Dean held his blade up in front of himself, and dug his heel into the ground, ready.

They’d chosen to stay in a hotel for once, because the only motel in town was all booked. Their hotel room had two beds, even though Cas didn’t sleep, and even though they’d left Sam back at the bunker. Because Cas didn’t sleep, only one of the beds was touched -- Dean’s, with the blankets pulled back, the pillows pushed down, his leather jacket shucked and thrown at the foot of it. One sleeve hung down, touching the carpeted floor. Dean kicked it with the toe of his boot. He watched it swing back and force, once, then settle back against the floor.

The bite of pain in his forehead hadn’t faded all day. It was a numbing, tedious thing which made Dean want to close his eyes and rub at his temple. He shook a cigarette out of the box, lit it with a flick of his lighter, hoping that the nicotine would give him some relief. The lighter he’d pulled from his back pocket happened to be the black one that Charlie had drawn a shaky pentagram onto with white nail polish.
But at the same time, that didn’t mean that Dean wanted Cas to be gone forever. Dean hadn’t been able to give Cas a reason to stay. That didn’t mean that there wasn’t one. The problem was that, while all of the reasons for Cas’s leaving were easy to list, the reasons why Dean wanted him to stay revolved more around some deep pulling deep inside of him. He didn’t want Cas to go because he just didn’t.
“No,” Sam cut in. “No it’s not.”

“Thanks, guys,” Victor says fondly. “It means a lot. I’m really excited to get started.”
Dean freezes.
“Dean, are you hurt?”
“Let me go,
“Am I your boyfriend?”
Dean shrugs. “It’s easy,” he says flatly.
“And you thought you could just ignore the rest of your responsibilities?” Dean opens his mouth to continue but his dad cuts across him and honestly he doesn’t know what he had planned to say anyway. “We had an agreement, Dean, you were to come right back here and help me out because I’ve got somewhere to be. I was counting on you, and instead you’re off playing mechanic in Bobby’s fucking junk yard - ”
“That’s for sure gonna wash off immediately,” Dean mutters to himself with a shake of his head, and Cas chuckles beside him.
After changing into his suit, and a silent ride in the Impala with Cas, the two arrived downtown. At least, Dean was pretty sure that he’d taken the right turns to get them down town. The street seemed to have transformed into a million tiny, colourful lights and decorations. Dean had to alternate watching the road and resting his eyes on Baby’s dark steering wheel so that he didn’t get dizzy as they parked.
Castiel frantically drew himself up off of the ground, stumbling onto his feet. His whole body protested the movement, aching and tired. Through the moonlight, he pushed forwards, fighting against himself, fighting to stay awake. He listened for the voice, but it didn’t come again. He moved towards where he’d watched Dean go down, heart spiking in fearful anticipation.
“Wait here.” Cas rushed through the bus, stopping once he’d reached the driver’s chair. The driver’s head was bowed forwards over the steering wheel, but his pulse was strong. Cas’s grace lit his hands up gold, and he held them forwards.
With the Impala’s engine roaring, the car vibrating around him, and Zeppelin blasting through the speakers, Dean was almost alright. He kept his gaze straight ahead, watching the steering wheel turn in his hands and the road stretch out in front of him. He couldn’t let his attention drift to the passenger side, not without picturing Cas beside him, window down, hair tousling gently in the wind, mouth wide as he sang along to the music.
The words hurt worse than the sting of reapplying the washcloth to his open wounds. The words, though, were a necessary pain. What would happen if Castiel allowed himself to believe, for only a second, that his relationship with Dean was anything like that?
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
Thank you so much for reading! I hope that you have a lovely rest of your day <3
In a hunt gone wrong, Castiel is knocked off of a cliff. He struggles to climb back up, worried that he won't be able to do so fast enough to save the only thing he's always fought for.
Dean tapped his fingers against the counter, then, seemingly unsatisfied, slammed his fist down instead. His plate shook with a metallic clink.
“We were gettin’ torn to bits out there, Cas. After they used the sigil to blow you away, Sam and I hardly got out,” Dean cut in. He’d managed to regain control of his expression, although the worry line in the center of his brown had yet to smooth out. “How’d you make it through? You were pretty bloodied up.”
“Gonna leave me so soon?”
“I cleared it from their memories,” Cas supplied, noticing Dean’s surprise. “Everything is back how it should be.”
They stopped beside a potted tree, the young plant only about three feet tall. The needles, beginning green closest to the stem, were faded to a dull brown at their tips. Castiel let his fingers fall to touch the tree, and the green slowly seeped up to cover all of each needle. Dean moved in beside him, their arms touching all along one side. He waited, breathing softly, hovering, patience ebbing.
Hope to see you there!
“That was less than a year after we met.”
“How was the cake tasting, or making the guest list? Was it hard to know where to seat all the guests?” Castiel asked as he paced towards the dresser. “Oh, wait.” He turned back to speak directly to Dean. “You had Lisa do all of that alone.”
“If I tell you, you have to promise to not tell anyone else,” Cas said. The girl nodded sharply. “Alright, then,” Cas slid one arm into his coat, pulling it back on. “I’m an angel of the Lord.”
Dean raised his eyes only to glare at Cas. He seemed to be saying
Cas closed his eyes, gauging the respective loyalties inside of him, and trying to sense if he could commit himself fully to Heaven. Overwhelmingly, all he could think of was Dean. His soul, which illuminated his side of the room, shone on unhelpfully.
“Dean,” Cas mumbled against him. Cas. Cas was still here. Why was Cas still here, if Dean was dead?
“Jack’s dead. Chuck’s gone. You and Sam have each other.” Cas turned his head first, let his body follow. He brought his gaze level with Dean’s for a second, then looked to the ground instead, as if looking at Dean was too much for him. As if it was Dean who was standing there with betrayal on his tongue. Dean held his breath, waiting for the final blow. Cas spoke to the ground as he finished.
Song 3: gold rush
Alt/hbo Supernatural AU. I've seen some great fanart and ideas for what Supernatural could have been if it had been aired on a different, less censored network. Here is my take on that idea.
“Hey, what happened, guys? Did Cas’s powers come back?” Sam swung himself around the kitchen door, voice bouncing off the walls loudly in the charged silence. Dean pulled away roughly, his hand trying to leave Cas’s face so quickly that it ended up hitting Cas’s thigh on the way down.
“Are going to go in there, chop some heads off of some vamps, and laugh about it over drinks tonight.”
“You need to lift your hand a little higher, or the ornaments are going to slide off.” Cas used his elbow to lift Dean’s arm to a height at which the ornaments would stay in place. He’d used his elbow as his hands were busing untangling a twisted string of lights.
“Alright, buddy,” Dean said after a moment. “Let’s sit you up.” He used the hand under Cas’s head to lift him forwards, ensured that Cas could rest back comfortably against the wall, and slid himself over so they sat together. Dean folded his knees awkwardly in front of himself.
Happy New Year, everyone!
“What? What, did I-” He replayed his own words back, realizing what he’d said. “Oh.” He waved his hand to the side. “Come on, man, that’s not fair! I told you I love you and I didn’t even do it on purpose!” Dean dropped his head back to look at the ceiling. “And I just did it again!”
“Now, what did you want?” Cas asked as he used one finger to adjust the lights looped around Dean’s shoulders.
The alleyway had exploded into light, illuminated by the glowing, changing form. Even the trash bags and litter scattered and wet against the concrete shone as if they were holy. The grimy walls reflected a white glow, as if they were at once clean. The puddles in the pavement glittered like white gold, and the raindrops transformed into jewels as they fell through the air.
The fog was turning to a mist thick enough to dampen Dean’s clothes. He stepped back under the overhang, pressing his back to the rough wall. From this close to the building, the light coming through the windows was too much for him to see through the darkness. The movement would come and he would miss it, but that was okay. The movement would be looking for him too.
Dean can’t breathe. There are fathomless blue eyes and a glowing light and nothing else, and Dean is drowning.
“Hmm,” Sam says, and his tone is speculative and knowing and just lofty enough that Dean can’t ignore it.
“Dean, it’s okay. Bud, come on - ”
“They’re wonderful,” Castiel beams. “They’re very comfortable.”
Out of habit, he peeks into Sam’s room on his way past but the kid is fast asleep.
Spotting a piece that had fallen under the table, Dean reaches for it and snags it from the carpet. He passes it to Cas, who takes it with a smile.
“Uh, yeah. Yeah, things are good.”
Dean turns to face him, and Cas scrutinizes him. That damn concerned crease between his eyebrows.
“You seen Dad?” Dean asks. Sam shakes his head.
“Who is that?” Cas whispers.
“Can we get food?” Sam asks as Dean looks from his ticket to the sign on the wall for some direction as to finding their seats.
Cas gasps, mouth going wide, and his hands tighten around Dean.
Dean swallows. “What does that mean?”
Dean thinks about that, about letting Jody keep him there until he sobers up, letting John take a bus back to his truck in the morning. He thinks about what Jody isn’t saying - like hell would leaving John there do the man any good, other than piss him off - but then Dean wouldn’t have to deal with him, and that was her whole point.
Dean stares at her. Finally, he shakes his head. “Uh, no. I’m not - I’m staying around here, I’m not - going to school.”
“I guess we’re both cowards, huh, Cas?”
to Bones? You speak
Turning back to the shelf, Dean’s eyes scan quickly, looking for what he needs. Jesus, why are there so many brands?
Sorry for the wait - these chapters just keep getting longer and longer, I hope you guys don't mind!
Dean reaches with both hands towards Cas’s sides and only gets one or two good prods in before Cas jolts away, slapping at Dean’s hands. They scuffle, Dean trying to muffle his laughter as he tries to tickle Cas just as hard as Cas is trying to avoid it, but eventually Cas catches Dean’s wrists in each hand.
He waits, and for a second he thinks Sam’s going to ignore him.
They run across the small backyard, and follow Ash and Andy and the others who were outside smoking as they make for the alley behind the row of townhouses. No one is discreet, everyone hollering and laughing as they run, and Dean looks to his left to see Cas grinning.
Dean shakes his head. “It’s okay. I’ll go get the key to room one. You can wait here.”
Cas edges forward on Dean’s other side, and Dean feels his hand brush low on his back, just briefly.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Sam doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”
“It was really cool,” he says with a full mouth. He swallows, winces at the brain freeze and takes a moment to recover. “They do it every year to monitor the easterm oysters. We were s’posed to compare what we found with the kids from last year.”
“I’m confused.” Cas leaned to the side to look at Dean. Dean’s head was turned stiffly forwards, his profile to Cas. He was studying the ground with a great interest.
The smile lines on the outside of Dean’s eyes deepened. He took the box from Cas’s hand and waved it to the cashier, “perfect fit for an angel, don’t you think?” He called to her, causing her to blush once more and nod her head. She would think, Cas assumed, that Dean was referencing her. He and Dean, however, both knew that when Dean said “angel,” there was only one person he was talking about.
“That’s it?”
Song 12: long story short
Cas’s arms were back around him, nearly too tight, and their lips met imperfectly together. Dean hadn’t expected Cas to kiss him so gently, and perhaps Cas hadn’t expected Dean to go in with such vigour. It took a moment to adjust, to figure out what went where.
“I want to be with you.”
“Yes,” Cas answered simply. He looped his arm around Dean’s and pulled them forwards towards where the woman was holding open a glass door. He pressed his body close to Dean’s, like a sideways hug. The woman watched them warmly.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean said softly. He ran his knuckles up and down Castiel’s back, bumping them gently along his spine. “Take it easy? Ok? Let me do the heavy lifting, huh?”
“I’m just so happy that you-” Castiel took a breath, “that you were able to make it.”
“We do what we always do. We figure it out.” Sam took a step back, away from Dean’s attempts to snatch back the remote. “I don’t think that’s all this is about, though.”
“Is your family here on earth?”
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
Something inside of Dean, some repressed hope, shattered. It fell like broken glass around them, mixing with the fallen snow. Dean tried to ignore it. Of course Cas hadn’t meant it.
Song 1: willow
“Let’s go outside, Cas.”
Sam hadn’t answered, and while Cas also couldn’t come up with any reason why they’d need ice in the morning, he grabbed hold of the metal bucket and slipped out the door with the intention of filling it up. Anything to put some space between him and everything that he couldn’t do.
“Uh,” Cas looked down to watch his feet as he stepped up the stairs into the bus. He held the fifty dollar bill out to the driver.
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Motion from the side caused Cas to turn suddenly, readying his angel blade to take out one of the monsters he’d been imagining. The preparation had been for nothing, it turned out; the movement was only a family of deer, a mother and two young fawns. They padded carefully out from between the trees, their large dark eyes catching in the streetlights.
“I didn’t waste my life.” Castiel sounded taken-aback.
“But you didn’t get to be with anyone, Cas! You were alone and it was my fault and now-” he waved one hand to Castiel’s form on the bed. “Now-” Dean’s voice broke.
Cas tentatively moved his hand away from where he’d almost touched Dean’s fingers, and stilled it in front of Dean’s face, instead. He let the power seep through his palm weakly, to ensure that the golden light didn’t become bright enough to awake either human. With the help of his grace, Cas pushed everything calm and peaceful that he could imagine towards Dean. He pictured long, empty highways and Dean’s beloved Impala; he thought of lazy days spent watching old western movies. When Cas ran out of things that Dean would like, he imagined his own peace, and pressed that into Dean as well.
The figure that Dean had seen had vanished. Either that, or it had walked deeper into the alley. Dean took his phone out of his back pocket and turned on its flashlight. The thin stream of light that the phone produced hardly managed to light a foot ahead of him. Dean shook his head, tried to laugh at the absurdity of what he was doing. He began into the alley.
‘That can’t be a thing.” Dean grumbled as he pulled the Impala out of the parking lot. He continued complaining, seemingly set to do so for the rest of the drive. But when his eyes landed on Cas in the rear view mirror, sliding up to the cowboy hat that Cas hadn’t removed, Dean’s lips stretched into a grin and stilled. He didn’t speak again for the rest of the drive, only humming pleasantly along to the music. Cas caught his eyes flicking across the rear-view mirror plenty more times, and if he wasn't certain Dean could drive while somewhat distracted (as he'd done it many times before), Cas would have told him to pay more attention to the road.
You're a cowboy like me
The weariness of Dean’s arms and the rush of air in and out of his lungs as he worked nearly clouded his mind. He nearly forgot how much he hated himself for allowing this to happen to Cas, when Cas and Sam had found a solution for Dean’s plan to lock himself in the box. With the effort of moving the Ma’lak box into place, he nearly saw himself as a person again, instead of this worthless, incapable failed thing which was letting Cas give up on himself.
“No, it does. 't was just nice t' have something of yours.”  In the grey light, Cas's blue eyes shone like visions of crystal waters. Their clarity, although beautiful, was guarded. Dean couldn’t tell if Cas had heard the way his voice had shaken.
He didn’t bother to look at the box he was holding until he’d taken a few steps away from the freezer and had stopped before a row of colourful candy bars. The brand name was terribly ironic, and Castiel couldn’t bring himself to return the box to the freezer even though the chill from the cardboard had begun to fade.
Dean turned, facing towards the open room, towards Cas. The shelves of books and boxes cast lines of shadow onto his dusty shoulders. “Cas, about what you said-” Dean started.
Dean placed a knee onto the bed, leaning forwards, until he could see the dark world through the window. He blinked, squinted his eyes. All he saw was the faint outline of where the parking lot met the cement fence. He’d parked the Impala directly under the window. If someone had- If somehow- “Is Baby-?” Dean was three steps towards the door when he was stopped by Cas’s palm against his chest.
“And you’re happy?”
To Cas’s side, the woman leaned herself over the bar. She placed a shot glass of something caramel-coloured before Dean, and crossed her arms over her chest to watch him drink it.
You had a speech, you're speechless
The heavy coarse material of his trench coat, with the added weight from the sea spray, was nearly dragging him down on its own. Castiel shook one hand away from the rocks, moving his shoulder around in an attempt to remove the sleeve. He used the rock wall to brush against, forcing the coat off of his one side. He had to push hard to force the material off of him, it being sticky and wet. He shoved his shoulder against the rocks until he was sure they would leave red marks.
- Taylor Swift, tolerate it
All of these things that I’ve never experienced to their full extent, or that I’ve never allowed myself to consider. How important
“Not a very good one,” Cas admitted. He smiled at the ground.
“Oh, uh,” once again, the barista seemed to have just remembered Cas’s existence. “Two nights ago? Maybe three? She lives with our mom a town over.” By the end of her speaking, the barista had turned back towards Dean.
Dean groaned and waved Sam’s worry away with his hand. He pulled the cereal box back towards him, flipping it around to look at the back. “Hey, did you know they still put jokes on these things? Listen to this-”
Dean and Cas had solved the case and killed the monster by the next day. They made a crack team. When they returned, Sam stopped himself from making jokes at their expense the best he could. He stopped himself from laughing when a waitress mistook them for a couple, and he didn’t say anything when Dean fell asleep with his head on Cas’s shoulder in the Dean Cave.
Love slipped beyond your reaches
“No, the issue was with me.” Cas wrung his hands in his lap as he spoke, his gaze pointed out his window. “I used to be so sure of my role in everything. Now, sometimes, I don’t even know who I am.”
This is Cas's side of the aftermath of the breakup in ep 15x03. Like ch.2, this one contains SPOILERS for the episode.
But the only conclusion Castiel could come to on his own was that Dean would be distracted because he'd have to worry about putting himself in danger to protect Cas, which was all the more reason for Cas to leave now.
Cas set his elbow on the arm rest, and bent his head so that his fingers could run easily through his own hair. He watched Dean, unblinking. He made himself breath at the same rhythm as the rise and fall of Dean’s chest. He pulled his hand from his hair, tracing it down his neck and onto his own collarbone atop his clothing. He imagined Dean’s skin beneath his hand, how it would be warm and smooth.
Forever, it happened, was ended rather quickly by the horn of the Impala blaring. Dean broke away, yelling at his brother across the parking lot, something about the car being a lady. Cas settled the hat down farther onto his head and followed after him.
The first ring he retrieved was the silver one, its thick band cool against his skin. He brushed the pad of his thumb over its texture—feathers, carved with delicate lines into a pair of wings. Dean held Castiel’s hand flat as he slipped the ring onto his middle finger.
You're so much older and wiser, and I
Climbed right back up the cliff
And if I didn't know better
By the time Cas realized that he wasn’t entirely certain how he was meant to get ice for the bucket, he’d run into a large white machine with multiple large labels marking it as “ICE.” Some humans must not know where to get ice from, either, then. The motel had decided they would need to make it as easy to spot as possible.
In the morning, once the sun had risen and the snow had become nothing but icy brown patches at the edges of the road, they wouldn’t talk about this. Dean would put on the same leather jacket and lace up the same heavy boots, and maybe he’d have to look away from water on the floor if snow had melted off of them, but they wouldn’t talk about it. They would never bring it up. Cas would sit even farther to the edge of his seat in the Impala. Dean would pointedly avoid his gaze for days.
He’s only gone a few steps when there is a
He feels like he can’t take a breath. “Yes, sir,” he gasps.
“A job? Why?”
“Oh, I was looking through some of your things,” Castiel says simply. He holds up a sock. "What are these?"
Patting the front pocket of his jeans, Cas nods.
Dean sits completely still. He has his lips pressed together firmly and he resolutely ignores the sting in the back of his eyes.
It’s not that he
While he’s awed by the guy’s guts, Dean can’t help but be a little confused. “It took some balls, then, for you to be here,” he says. “What made you choose to come on land, though?”
“You’re restless,” Cas observes.
They try a few other games, and find that Castiel, while not good at games that require any use of a toggle or a gun, has quite good reflexes. He finds the whack-a-mole absolutely hilarious, and Dean thinks he’d be rather good at it if he’d concentrate more, rather than stop and laugh every time he hits one.
“The bus?” Sam asks incredulously, bending down and tugging on his sneakers. “Dean, let’s just drive, come on.”
. I saw that it is. Dean.”
“Woah,” Dean says softly, and he looks up with wide eyes and catches Castiel’s gaze. He swallows, a little breathless. The color of Castiel’s eyes matches his tail. They’re deep, and perplexing, and remind Dean of the smell of sea breeze and something else that makes the hair on his arms prickle. The ocean. “That was…. Thanks.”
Dean and Sam stare at him a moment, before sharing a glance between them.
Cas huffs his breath out quietly and looks away, and Dean lets himself grin. Reaching out, he hooks a finger through one of the belt loops at the front of Cas’s jeans. He tugs him close.
“You know what,” Dean says quietly. "Maybe you should leave, Cas."
“The nerve of that kid,” Dean says with a shake of his head. “I swear.”
“I’ll think about it,” Dean says finally, and she beams. “I said I’ll
Dean thought Sam would be pissed, to be honest, when he found out Cas was gone. He thought that Sam would bitch at him for driving Cas away, for not getting him to stay. Instead, Sam reacted much like Jo did - with a sympathetic twist of his mouth and a soft look, and Dean found that was infinitely worse. He hasn’t been able to look straight at the kid since, because he can’t stand to see the pity in his eyes.
“You do?”
Dean shrugs. “I’m here to work on the car.”
“ - called hamsters, I think, and there are mice, too, but I don’t think those are as cute - ”
Dean glances down at him and shakes his head. “Not
“Dude, you scared the shit out of me.” Dean can’t even find it in himself to be angry at the guy yet, as relieved as he is that he didn’t just get eaten by a deep sea creature. He carefully picks himself off the ground and makes his way back towards the pool. “What the hell are you doing? Pool hopping is like, illegal, and I could totally call the cops on you right now, man.”
There’s a moment of pause, a held breath. Dean stays very still.
It’s obvious Cas is having a hard time containing himself, his hips jerking beneath Dean’s hands, and Dean has to pull off an inch or so when Cas’s cock hits the back of his throat and he almost chokes. He recovers, though, and sinks down as far as his gag reflex will let him, swirling his tongue and sucking hard, and he looks up at Cas’s face through his lashes. Castiel is staring down at him with his eyes wide and mouth open, and as soon as they make eye contact Cas’s fingernails scrape Dean’s scalp as his hands tighten in his hair and he comes.
Dean swallows.
“Sorry, I’m - I’m helping my dad with storm windows tomorrow.” Dean shoulders past people to the door as it swings open with a pneumatic sigh.
“No, I’m not - ”
He squints at the bright screen, trying to get it in focus. Who the hell is calling at this time? Blinking hard, he opens his eyes wide as he tries to read the caller ID - Ocean City Police Department.
“Dean, are you sure you’re alright?” Cas frowns, still worried.
“There are six,” says Cas, who clambers up from the sand to stand by Sam.
Dean shakes his head at that, smiling. “That’s probably true.”
“I told you that my mom died,” Dean finally says. He hears Cas nod against the pillows beside him, his eyes trained on the ceiling. The shadows shift, faintly, as a car passes on Coastal Highway. “But I never told you how, huh?”
He turns, and finds himself looking up at Speed of Light.
Dean hesitates. They are sort of adorable. The way they nudge at Cas’s fingers, and how they’re taking an interest in Sam now, too, is rather endearing. He bites his lip for a moment, but then steps up against the glass.
“Are you alright?” He asks, and his voice is hard.
“He didn’t,” Dean says with a shake of his head. “He nicked me, on the back of my neck, but that’s all - ”
“You really should,” Dean says with a chuckle, skating his fingers through the hair at the back of Cas’s head. “It’s been a few days.”
From where he stands by his truck, John flags Dean down as he comes out of the lobby at the front of the motel. Dean heads for him.
want to go. They usually have a lot of fun, and he hasn’t hung out with all those guys in a while. It’s just, they also usually end up getting into some kind of trouble. Not to mention, as fun as it is to get high at Jolly Rogers, weed sometimes sort of messes with him. It either chills him out really well or makes him nervous and unsettled. He’s never sure which it’s gonna be when he smokes, which is why he doesn’t do it very often.
Cas gazes down at him and Dean can feel his smile fading from his face as he all but melts into the mattress, heat pooling again low in his belly. Dean tries not to squirm and he knows that Cas notices because he sees his eyes darken and he’s definitely just as turned on as Dean is.
“Yeah, I’ll leave Shelly here.”
“You’re agitated.”
“Closer.”
Bobby pushes himself up from his chair and leaves the room before Dean can even gather his thoughts. He’s still sitting at the table, dumbfounded, when Bobby returns with some papers. He sets them down in front of Dean.
Castiel wraps a hand around Dean’s bicep and tugs hard, and Dean finally crawls back up his body, still jerking himself. With a hand around the back of his neck, Cas pulls Dean down into a kiss but Dean can hardly concentrate on kissing back, he’s so turned on and ready to come.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean says. “Yeah, that’s - fuck, that’s good - ”
He watches Cas for a minute longer before rolling away and getting out of bed.
And Dean crawls onto his mattress, sliding under the covers and burrowing down on the side closest to the wall. He lies with his back facing Cas, and just listens. A long moment passes before Cas finally follows, getting into bed without a word and taking a minute to get settled.
really good at this game. He’s fast, and intuned, and has impressive hand-eye coordination that he didn’t demonstrate as well in any of the other games. The machine counts the number of buttons you hit, and only allows three misses before you lose, but Cas is already at over a hundred and hasn’t missed one.
Trying to tamp down his disappointment, Dean walks Castiel out and says goodbye to him. It’s not like they have to spend every waking moment together. Cas wants to explore the town, and Dean’s sure he’ll come back later. And if he doesn’t, so what, the guy can do what he wants.
to him, in place of his legs.
“Well,” Cas says. “We do spend a fair amount of time in shallow waters.”
“This okay?” Dean murmurs as he starts to stroke him, and Cas can only nod, apparently unable to speak.
Castiel jerks his head in an approximation of a shrug, but it comes off sharp in a way that makes Dean hurt for him, dully. “It was a very long time ago, that he went away. I was young. It just - it made me realize… No one else can do what he did. Naomi and Zachariah, they…” He shakes his head. “No one else could do it.”
“How many other merpeople do you live with? A lot?”
With one last scan of the water with his eyes, Dean forces himself to continue with his task, keeping his gaze firmly on what he’s doing as he scoops debris from the water.
Dean listens to the two of them and can’t help but smile. He likes hearing them talk back and forth like this. He likes that Cas can make Sam smile, broadly and self-assured.
Dean stirs. He doesn’t know why he’s being woken for school. He graduated. Didn’t he?
Reluctantly, he turns. Cassie’s at the checkout behind him, and she waves him over.
“Are you okay?” Dean asks. Sam nods wordlessly. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there to pick you up today.”
“Uh, Cassie, this is my friend… Cas.” Dean winces. To her credit, the only change in Cassie’s expression is a slight quirk of her eyebrows, and she glances between them. Dean’s suddenly aware of how Cas is standing just a bit too close behind him.
Dean and Cas discuss Dean's habit of digging his fingers into his ribs, and Dean explains that it makes him feel better when his stomach aches with anxiety. Cas mentions bruises he notices along Dean's ribcage, a result of his habit.
Cas is built like a swimmer, which Dean supposes makes sense - all long limbs, strong looking but lean. A bit more so than Dean, who’s a little stockier in the shoulder and arms.
He jogs ahead of them constantly as they walk through the fort, pointing out old cannons mounted on steps and ramparts that he thinks may be original, and rattling off every fact he knows about the place. He moves on to the next thing that catches his eye before Dean and Cas can even catch up.
“I recall a few of your ribs cracking, that’s for sure,” Alastair calls over the heads of people that come between them as Cas and Jo usher Dean towards the door. “Have they healed since?”
Dean stares at him for a couple beats. “I’m not being weird about it.”
“What are you doing?” Dean kicks his shoes off into the corner.
“That dreamcatcher of yours. It only works if you hang it up.”
“But she
“Oh,” Cas still looks puzzled.
Cas picks Dean’s hand up, bending his arm at the elbow. He turns his wrist to slide his hand into Dean’s, matching their fingers so they’re palm-to-palm. Turning his head, Dean squints his eyes open. His palm is slightly larger but Cas’s fingers are longer, stretching just a bit past Dean’s.
“Guys, I’ve got somethin’ I wanna tell you,” Victor says, and they all turn to him. He’s got a smile on his face as he glances between them all. “I’m afraid this is gonna be my last boardwalk blaze.”
A shiver like ice water rushes from the top of Dean’s head to the very end of his spine. He stares at Gabriel, frozen where he stands.
“You just puked up all that water!” Dean’s heart is pounding in his chest as he stands over Cas, not knowing what to do.
“I was,” John insists, brow pulled low in visible discomfort. “I’ve been a coward, I admit that. I’ve tried to have this conversation before - ”
“Alright, Cas, c’mon.”
Well, too late to be a little bitch now.
“Hey, Dean.”
Dean rounds on him, incredulous. “What the hell are you laughing for?”
“Boring, but it was fine. I’m glad the weekend’s over.”
And he’s not even embarrassed by the desperation in his own voice, so overcome with a sudden and debilitating terror as he strains to get a glimpse of the crashing ocean below them. Crowded against the railing, Alastair’s chest to his back and his voice in his ear, Dean starts to panic.
Cas smiles at that.
Cas watches intently, curious, as Dean digs out the little bottle from the grocery store. He looks at it, heart thudding, and holds it up for Cas to see. Cas doesn’t seem like he knows what it is.
Jo exclaims.
“I like it.”
“Is there… anything else you need?” Dean asks cautiously.
He upturns the bottle and squirts some over Cas’s fingers. It’s wet and glistening, and just seeing Cas rub it over his fingertips, intrigued, has Dean’s heart racing.
They drive, and a thought comes to Dean that makes his breath come up short because he realizes how irrevocably true it is, as soon as it cross his mind. They drive, and he reaches out to take Cas’s hand, and he thinks about how Cas would make it bearable, staying around. He could do what his dad wants, he could stick around to help run the Bunker, if he had Cas here with him. Castiel would make it bearable.
“Yeah, whatever,” he says, unable to come up with a better response with the way Cas’s long fingers trail across his collar bone. Cas touches his throat briefly before following the leather cord that rests around Dean’s neck with a finger, raising goosebumps in his wake.
Sam gasps. “You
The ferris wheel is just finishing when Cas reaches out and tries to take Dean’s hand.
“Nothing,” Cas says, and John’s dark eyebrows quirk. “I mean - I’m staying with my family,” he corrects. “They want me to stay. I have a lot of siblings.”
But Cas just looks at him with wide eyes. His mouth moves wordlessly on a few aborted attempts before he says, “Nothing.”
, he thinks as he makes his way through the lobby to the apartment.
“Is… everything alright?”
to do with this?” Naomi repeats, her eyebrows arcing high, and it seems that surprise more than anything is what stops her in her tracks. “But he has everything to do with this, doesn’t he, Castiel?”
“Hm,” Sam says, and he returns to his cereal.
Gabriel keeps his eyes ahead. “I knew what to look for.”
Dean swallows. He’s been trying to keep this whole thing to the back of his mind since Cas announced it. There’s been something rising in him, beneath the aching in his gut, something that’s close to bubbling up and it feels dangerous, it feels deadly, and it feels a lot like hope.
Cas gently pulls his fingers from Dean’s ass, who winces at the strange feeling. They look at one another, the both of them with hooded eyes and flushed faces.
“Bobby - ”
10:17am
Dean blinks. “What?”
“Listen, Dean.” Bobby’s voice is quiet. “It wasn’t any of my business.”
“The exhaust needs replacing, that’s for sure. I’ll probably start there.”
“Yeah,” Dean croaks. Clearing his throat, he tries again. “Yeah, I’m - I’m fine.”
“Anyway, Dean, I’ve got somethin’ came in the mail for you in the house. If you wanna take a look,” Bobby says.
Dean shakes his head. “Uh, no.” He tries to smile, but it’s brittle and not believable.
They’d driven about an hour further north after the Orioles game, to the very top of the bay where they’d decided to stay for the night. Havre de Grace is a small port town surrounded by water, making it a perfect place for Cas to stay the night, with a cheap motel nearby for Dean and Sam.
John’s cell phone rings, cutting him off. He holds up a finger and digs it from his pocket. As Dean watches, John gets a look at the caller ID on the front and pushes off from where he was leaning against the counter, shoulders curved down towards the phone.
Alrighty, next chapter will be an AU which I am SO excited to share with you! No more hints bc idk how to describe it more w/o giving it away. Thanks for reading!
Dean lunged forwards, the star toppling from his head with a clash. He pulled his own knife free as he ran forwards. The vampires were easy to spot, now, having released their fangs; Dean’s quick count spotted five of them, six including the vamp that Cas had already killed.
“I haven’t found anything yet,” Dean bit into his clasped hands. Other than praying updates to Cas and drinking unrecommended amounts of liquor, the only thing Dean had been able to do was research. He doubted he’d ever read so much in his life; he was digesting books and articles faster than even Sam. The possibility of bringing Cas back, it had attached to him like a vice, squeezing him with need and desperation that drove him to devote hour upon hour to the search.
: Cas rides a bus and talks to a stranger while running away from the bunker. Angst/fluff. CC.
“I said, how long have you known?”
“You staying around a little longer wouldn’t be unnecessary. Sam’s in the bunker right now, looking through the lore. Just give us a bit longer to find a different solution.” Dean's heavy boot brushed against the loosened ground as he took a step forward. “Please.”
“We don’t,” Cas said simply. He’d stood as well, and was making his way towards the open door. He began clearing the smudged sigil off of the door panel.
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean grumbled. He brushed his hands together and stalked out of the room.
Next chapter, Sam finds a way that he might be able to help push Cas and Dean towards an understanding.
Castiel shook his head slightly. “I can’t let myself put you in unnecessary danger. I care too much about you.”
I don’t know how to do this. C’mon, Dean, just write it down. I
Forever is the sweetest con
Movement from the other bed caught Cas’s attention. Sam had turned over, and was rubbing at his eyes with one hand. He appeared to be waking up. Cas pulled his hand from Dean’s grasp and took a step back. There was no way Dean would want Sam to see that they were so close. In the morning, Dean would be better off to not remember, and to not have anyone else remember, either.
He came across a piece of information rather quickly, and without thinking, read it out loud. In the empty bunker, only Sam’s own voice reflected back to him. He rolled his eyes at himself before flicking his phone from his pocket and texting the tip to Cas. He didn’t want to encourage Dean’s habit of texting and driving.
The cassette tape inside the Walkman was an updated version of the Zeppelin playlist Dean had made for Cas. It had all of the same songs, with some additions that he hoped Castiel would enjoy. Some songs that they’d listened to together, or sung along to on the radio, and some that he didn’t think Cas had ever heard before. Some songs to remind Cas of the world, of things they had done, and others, selfishly, that Dean hoped would remind Cas of him.
against the metal. That was the last apology he would give. It wasn’t his responsibility to apologize for the same thing a hundred times, and not his fault that it kept falling on deaf ears.
“Tell me-”
My house of stone, your ivy grows
“Good, he’s got the just of it.” Dean opened his hands to his sides, turning to face Sam. Sam narrowed his eyes. “Fine.” Dean tightened his jaw and pointed his gaze back towards Castiel. “The party, uh, it’s difficult to get an invitation to, so...”
Cas’s fingers at the base of Dean’s neck surprised him. Dean paused, found Cas’s face through the snowy air. Cas’s skin shone a pale, sunken white. The snow falling behind him seemed to circle him in a halo. Specks of water shone in the tips of his hair.
You're alive, you're alive in my head
“Alright. Is that all you had to tell me?”
Something about Cas’s hand felt just a little off, though. It took Dean a second to remember what it was, as if his mind was working through the same thick fog that their bodies walked through.
Sam held the letter between his fingers as he walked the distance between the library and Dean’s bedroom. He meant to return the letter to Dean, both to save his brother from having someone else find his despairing ramblings, and to give himself the opportunity to make fun of Dean to his face about it. If Dean and Cas were going to put Sam in the middle of their unspoken feelings, then the most Sam could do was create some amusement for himself from it. He wasn’t allowed to
“Dean? Is it ready?” Castiel’s low voice from where he still held himself against a tree. He was fighting the urges of the mark, trying to stay in control. Dean remembered that feeling, and how badly he’d wanted to give into it.
Takes one to know one
“I’m sorry.”
Inside of the book, tucked half-way into the binding, was a piece of lined paper. Its edges were uneven, as if it had been ripped away hastily from somewhere else. Judging from the crumpled bit of the paper that Sam could see, it was too white to have been left there by the Men of Letters, not darkened by the time that it would have had.
“Dean?” He called, and his voice sounded like cracking electricity. He coughed towards the ground, and tried again. “Dean?”
“The pie!” Dean grinned, catching Cas by the hand as he walked on towards the table. ‘Now, tell me which one you were going to get me, and I’ll tell you how poor your taste is.”
Did you have a favourite? Or one that surprised you? Any other comments? I would so so love to hear from you guys :)
“Help me!” Castiel called into the abyss of night around them. He leaned back again and repeated his plea to the sky: “Help me save Dean Winchester!”
Dean’s free hand slipped into his jeans pocket. Pressed tight against his skin, secure and hidden, Dean had kept Castiel’s rings safe for him while he’d been gone. He pulled at Cas towards him, turning them to face each other, then dropped the contact.
At the end of the day, Dean forced himself to remember as he closed his eyes and curled himself onto his side, leaving or staying was ultimately Cas’s decision. If he had wanted to stay with Dean, Cas would still be here. Obviously, he did not.
“Oh.” Dean raised his gaze towards Sam and scanned his face for the signs of excitement or anticipation that usually showed when he’d found them a case. “Did you find something?”
Dean tightened his grasp on the edge of the table at either side of him. He closed his eyes and turned his head as if shielding himself from a blow. Cas’s footsteps paused, like he was giving Dean one more chance to call him back. Dean dropped his shoulders in defeat; from the top of the stairs, he heard the bunker’s door scrape open and a moment later thump against the doorframe as it closed back into place. Without Cas, the bunker immediately fell in on itself, trapping Dean in layers of rubble and debris.
“All-” Dean started. His voice caught and he had to steady himself before he tried again. “Alright, Cas. It’s ready.” He pulled himself out of the grave, let his eyes find Cas across the grass, and nearly broke down. Castiel’s eyes were closed, his mouth pressed into a thin line, his head tilted back against the bark of the tree. He looked ethereal, untouchable in the sallow moon light. He looked like trapping him deep underground as his mind was taken over from within would be the gravest sin one could commit.
The question pounds my head
Dean copes with (read: represses) his feelings after Cas's goodbye.
He grunted as he heaved the Ma’lak box from the trailer bed and across the grassy ground, letting its back end drag. If the thing was built to contain something as strong as an archangel, surely it could withstand some rough handling.
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
“I may be biased,” the barista sipped at her drink, eyes trained on Dean’s, “but yeah, I’d say so. Only thing better than the booze in this place is the patrons.”
If they’d been a normal family, with mundane tasks and commitments, perhaps they would be on their way to the mountains for vacation. What would Cas, as a human stopping between stretches of driving, be doing? Looking around, probably. Humans seemed to enjoy browsing. Castiel took in Dean’s beautiful back once more before moving himself on deeper into the little store; he could only take four paces away from the chip bags before he reached the back wall.
“So we’re all good to go, then?” Dean finished wiping his knife clean, and quickly concealed it before any of the party goers noticed.
“They had a history.” Cas said, emphasizing each word breathily. “If it were me in Sam’s position, I would have wanted a chance to see her.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said. He flicked his chin in the direction of the table. “Psst!”
But there was one prize I'd cheat to win
So that was five dead… Dean took a step back, swiveling his head around. He spotted the last vamp across the room, trying to escape out the door. Many of the ornaments still clung to Dean’s arms; he slid one off, rolling it between his fingers before beaming it at the vamp’s head. The impact only stopped the thing for a moment, but it was enough time for Dean to reach it and introduce it to his knife.
I hope you enjoy!
“I can’t,” Dean said. “I can’t say that, okay?” He let his head fall forwards, resting it in the crook of Castiel’s neck. The veil tickled against his ear. “But I have to do this anyways.”
“Yeah, yeah. ‘Tis the season and all that.” Dean arrived beside Cas and his hands moved on to pull the tan material of Cas’s coat properly over his shoulders. What was the point of dressing up like some sort of an accountant if you weren’t gonna keep yourself presentable? “Still, though. The city could’a chosen some lights that don’t hurt your eyes when you look at them.”
“Yeah,” Dean says with a nod, and he kicks his legs gently in the water as if to prove his point. “I’m good.”
He swallows mouthful after mouthful of salt water, every time he tries to scream. The surface remains out of reach no matter how much he flails, the ocean all around him, dragging at his clothes and pulling him down by the ankles. Each time he inhales, his lungs fill with sea water, and his chest is lead-heavy and he feels himself sinking. His throat burns, from the salt or the panic or the attempts to scream he doesn’t know, but every time he tries to make a sound nothing comes out.
“Want you, Dean,” Cas murmurs into Dean’s palm.
“Good,” John nods in his peripheral vision. “You doin’ okay on groceries still?”
Cas places the solo cup on the desk. “What’s the Hulk?”
They stick to back roads, since the car isn’t registered and isn’t technically street legal, but there’s no shortage of winding, empty two-lanes around here. The wind blows through the car and the radio plays, and back here with trees and farms and grass it barely even smells like the ocean and it feels like freedom. Dean can’t keep himself from glancing over at Castiel in his passenger seat every once in a while, looking content with an arm out the window and his t-shirt rustling. He’s jolted, just a little, when Cas turns to meet his gaze because his eyes are so impossibly blue in the slanting light of the afternoon and Dean is hopeless.
“It’s gonna be so great - I’m gonna come visit you all the time, and then when I go to college you can tell me all about how to do it - cuz if you’re going, Dad
“No,” he says.
“Uh, hello?” He heads down the short hall, at the end of which are the ice and soda machines.
Friday, you’re leaving for College Park?”
“Right,” Bobby says, and Dean doesn’t have to see his face to note the disapproval in his voice. “Big weekend, huh?”
It’s strange, the way the ocean breeze seems to take his words from him. No echo, just gone over the water, nearly drowned out by the sound of the crashing waves. Still, they come from within him, untangling from beneath his sternum, and that’s what matters.
But Dean’s breath is coming faster now, is sticking in his chest more and more each time he tries to draw in air. He drags the heel of his hand over his sternum distractedly.
“How was the tub?”
Cas was going to walk Dean out here, past where Sam and Jo and Ellen can hear them, and he was going to tell him that he’s leaving.
“Can I feel your tail?” Dean asks before he can stop himself, and he’s about to feel embarrassed but Castiel smiles and nods.
Sam and Dean look into the water at the same time, and both gasp.
“I want to have your support on this,” he says. “I do. But I don’t need it. I hope you can understand that.”
nerdy.”
“If I have to drain that fucking pool tomorrow, I’m gonna be pissed.”
Bobby hesitates at that, and though Dean doesn’t look at his face, his silence feels a bit bewildered at Dean’s tone. Wanting nothing less than to elaborate on that, Dean flashes Bobby a cheap and unconvincing smile.
When the first joint is down to about the last third, Jo pulls out another and passes it along with the lighter to Dean. Dean sparks it up, inhaling deep. He’s definitely starting to feel his eyelids getting heavy, and a dull tingling in his legs.
“ - but I know you’ll prob’ly spend it on your brother, anyway, so I don’t wanna hear it.” Bobby glares at him, but it isn’t very convincing. “Treat yourself, too, and your boy Cas there to some ice cream or somethin’, alright?”
“Sure, yeah,” Dean clears his throat, pushing off from where he was leaning on the door. “Cas, I’m gonna - ”
“Sorry,” Cas whispers. “They do seem to get very cold.” His breath tickles Dean’s ear with his proximity, raising goosebumps on the back of his neck.
pool?”
Not to mention the storm. It had come out of nowhere late last night, the forecast only giving Dean and his dad an hour to get the pool covered and the chairs away before it hit. Dean didn’t look at the pool as they’d dragged the cover over it, and he didn’t think about Cas. He had sat up late watching TV to try and drown out the sound of the blowing wind and violent thunder, and he didn’t think about the fury Cas was no doubt facing from his family. He didn’t wonder what kind of punishments they were doling out. It’s a miracle Dean got any sleep at all.
“I’m sorry about Gabriel,” he murmurs into the dark.
“I won’t be gone long.”
The inquisition continues until they finish their ice cream and stand to throw out their trash. As much as Dean thinks the questions are getting a bit exhausting, he’s interested to learn so much about Castiel. It makes him realize how little he really knows about the guy. And how much Cas knows about him, in comparison.
“Is this like marijuana?” He asks, and Dean shakes his head.
“That’s enough,” Cas says, and this time his voice is just commanding enough to get Jo to back down with a shake of her head. Cas turns to him. “Dean, are you alright?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Dean says. “She just needed a little tune-up, is all.”
“So, you’ve noticed the noise?” John asks, and he comes over to lean into the open driver’s side doorway.
John surveys him as he takes a swig of his beer. “What, you into marine biology, too?”
“Leave me - the fuck - alone - ”
“You should’ve just ignored him, Dean,” Jo says. She’s still pissed, but at least she’s stopped yelling.
Cas nods, his smile widening.
Dean nods to the cigarette in his hand. The guy looks him up and down, slowly and with superiority, and Dean’s teeth are squeaking they’re clenched so tightly, his blood boiling. Finally, before Dean can snap, the guy pulls the pack out of his pocket.
“Can you speak whale?”
Dean meets his eyes again, sheepishly.
“No. I am.”
It’s all coming out like a flood, now, and Dean doesn’t try to mitigate it. It flows from him, undammed - his vision swims, and still he keeps going.
are complete. The sun painted behind the letters is a little chipped, but nothing terrible.
Dean cracks up.
“So,” Naomi interrupts, doing a haughty sweep of Dean from head to toe with narrowed eyes. “This is the human, is it?”
Dean shakes his head, still trying to will his blush to fade. He refuses to look in Sam’s direction.
“So, what’s the next stop on our road trip?” Cas asks. Dean’s heart sinks.
. He hardly ever knows.
“Yes,” Cas nods.
Cas grumbles, but returns the popsicle to his mouth.
“Sweet,” Dean grins. “I’ll text him.”
“Nah,” Bobby shakes his head with a smile. “I’m sure it’ll do fine. You did good work on it, kid.”
“You’ve always thought of yourself as special, that’s nothing new. This, however, is more than we thought you had the nerve for.”
“Yeah,” Sam opens the fridge and starts digging through it.
“Is… he around?” Jo asks carefully. Her expression is imploring, just on this side of worried, and Dean knows she can see right through him. He avoids her eyes, jaw clenched.
Cas smiles lazily.
The kiss is unhurried but it’s deep, tongues sliding and teeth clicking. They step in close until they’re flush chest to hips, Cas’s arms around Dean tight and Dean’s hands in Cas’s hair. The rain patters on the roof and the faucet runs loudly.
Flustered, Dean turns away from Cas and loudly clears his throat.
“Told me what?”
Past the blood and bruise
“Cas.” Dean’s reply, short and low, was enough to point Castiel in the right direction. He found Dean sitting, rubbing at the back of his head.
He closed the door softly behind himself. Outside, a sharp gust of wind cut through him, rushing like a current under the motel’s awning. Surely, this kind of wind would make a human cold. He would need to make sure that Dean wore his coat when they left in the morning.
Sam glanced sideways at Dean. “You know, I could-” He rubbed his palms up and down his thighs. “I could go with Cas. He and I aren’t as close, so it might be easier to-”
No matter how long and hard the day’s hunt had been, no matter what new monsters they’d have to face tomorrow, Dean would never let Cas help him like that. It wasn’t what Cas was there for, not really. He could heal their battle wounds when it was the difference between life or death, but something like this, something that was more for pleasure than necessity, there was no way Dean would allow it.
“Does your own not do the same?” Cas asked. Dean’s ring, on his left ring finger, belonged to no one. It couldn’t, for it did not truly exist. It was made of celestial energy, although it had been made to look like a simple gold band. It reminded him of Castiel so badly that sometimes he couldn’t even look at it--he was terrified that the ring would outlive its reason for existing.
Oh, I can't
“So, just love from one side, that isn’t enough.” Cas meant to say it as a question. It came out as more of a plea for her to disagree.
Power thrummed through Castiel’s body, awoken by the lightning. He lifted his hands, held them an inch from Dean’s chest, and spread his fingers wide. He called for his grace, and golden light exploded from his palms. It began towards Dean’s chest, and quickly spread through his whole body, winding and twisting like a growing vine. Dean’s form glowed from within, his features blurring until he was a beam of light, until the air around him, the drops of water, the rocky ground, were all a beam of light.
Family that you gave up on as soon as they were no longer proving their worth.
Chapter 7.
This letter, then, was from around when they’d found Cas again, had helped him regain his memories, and had very promptly left him to be watched by the demon Meg in a mental hospital. Not a great way to treat a friend, looking back on it.
“I love you,” Cas continued, and Dean’s heart stopped. He shook his head to one side. He must have heard wrong, because this- this was not how it ended. He and Cas, this was not how they ended, some half-completed thing, unreciprocated. Dean’s mouth wouldn’t work, he couldn’t think, couldn’t get his lips to make the words that would return Cas’s confession. But he wanted to. In a different moment, Dean would have been able to. This wasn’t how they were supposed to end.
“I hope so. Anyone here know Kacy Baker?”
And I'm never gonna love again
Dean clung to Cas’s arm at the last moment, causing them both to topple sideways with the momentum that Cas had meant for just Dean. They crashed against the wall, Dean’s back hitting the bricks and his hip digging into the cement floor. He hardly felt the contact. His only thought was on protecting Cas.
“No, I’m not. I’m sorry that I didn’t reassure you sooner, Dean. I was unaware that you were under that impression. It must have been quite a burden.”
Cas's side of this is now posted in ch.6 :)
“We leave in two hours,” Sam said by way of goodbye.
“What good'll that do?” Dean fell to the side, sitting down against the wall of the diner. “The deed’s already done, Cas.” A car lumbered by on the road, its yellow headlights filtering through the fog. The low rumble of a baseline shook the air as it passed.
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Sam closed the envelope and hid it back under the pillow, ensuring that everything was as he’d found it before leaving Cas’s room.
Her eyes had flown open, and she looked to Cas with an expression of terror, but she wasn’t going to get hurt. Cas had grabbed her in time to keep her from being flung off of her seat. The movement only lasted for a few more seconds before it came to a jolting halt.
“Shit, Cas. How'd this happen?” Dean doubled over, his hands on his knees. His headache had returned, and his head felt like it was about to spit in two. Beside him, Cas knelt to the ground. Dean followed his eyeline to the splotches of dark blood in a line down the sidewalk.
“But you’re not at that point yet, Cas. You’re still too… ‘you.’”
“It’s ok, Cas. We’ll talk about it later.” He nodded his head dismissively before turning back towards the barista.
It cut deep to know ya
Pushed from the precipice
The body that had been pushed out of the door nearly fell, catching themselves against the wall. The diner cook spat at the ground. The bells hanging at the top of the door rang, cutting off abruptly as the door shut once more.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean threw his body overtop of Castiel’s, blocking him the best he could from the oozing tendrils of the Empty. Cas thrashed underneath him, trying to push Dean off, to do the valiant thing and sacrifice himself. Dean pushed all of his weight down, trapping Cas against the floor.
“It needs more sunlight.” Castiel muttered. “It’s hard for the sun to reach it here.”
“I’m fine to drive, Cas,” Dean said indignantly. He tugged at the blankets of the bed, trying to straighten them across the mattress. He only managed to pull one of the bottom corners forwards. He left it how it was.
“Sh.” Cas said. His focus was undividedly on attempting to balance something on top of Dean’s head. “Stop moving. I’m giving you your star.”
He loved Dean Winchester.
Cas slid his hand off of his face, and tried to smile at the girl. He held his coat up, nodding a thanks for the return.
“You said that it would be bad if the vampires suspected to be hunters before we identified them.”
“I think so,” Cas repositioned his angel blade back into his coat sleeve how he liked it. “Although we are currently in a disagreement.”
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He’s just about there when Cas’s head snaps up, but it’s not to look in Dean’s direction. Cas looks up sharply, but he’s staring out to Dean’s right, past where Dean can see what he’s looking at, and Dean freezes. He stops before he reaches the doorway, at an angle out of view from the outside. He watches Cas straighten, and the color drain from his face, and his stomach pitches.
Blinking his eyes open, he takes a deep breath. He lies there a minute, taking stock. He breathes, and lets the pieces fall back into place in his mind.
“A Bay Cove kid, huh?” She asks, referring to the trailer park across the street.
Cas’s eyes search his face, and there’s a soft sadness in them that makes Dean’s chest feel tight. Rolling to his side, Cas slides his hand up Dean’s neck to rest under his jaw. Gently, he brushes his thumb across Dean’s lower lip, his eyes following the movement before meeting Dean’s gaze.
Everyone goes nuts at that, hooting and shouting, but Dean only gets the satisfaction of seeing the absolutely murderous expression on Alastair’s face for a second before Jo and Cas shove him out the door and onto the patio.
Dean puffs out his breath.
Here's a long one for you guys. I'd love to know what you think of it  <3
“Alright, come on,” Dean politely keeps his eyes averted as he turns back to Cas and helps him up, leading him to the tub. “In,” he instructs.
“What?”
Dean smacks at his shin. “Scoot over.”
“I wish I’d been the one to tell you that the first time.”
“The twerp who doesn’t rinse off before getting in the pool? And practically drools when he’s in the same room as Jo?”
“No, I didn’t - ” Cassie’s shaking her head.
Cas regards him quietly, and Dean is grateful he doesn’t ask something like “
“I thought so,” Dean finally says, voice quiet now, and though he feels like he’s known this for a long time, the weight of the confirmation still sits heavy on his shoulders.
“Yeah, it’s cool,” Dean says. He steps over and takes Cas’s empty glass, refills it for himself. “My dad’s gonna be back Friday.”
Dean shrugs. “Yeah. But it’s not as much of a thing for my school because all of us live around here all the time. Besides,” Dean smirks ruefully. “I’ve kind of participated since I was fifteen.”
just kids, but in reality the last time something weird was happening in the pool, there was an honest to god fucking
“Hm. Where’s Dad?”
, please - ”
Dean frowns. “It was bad? Drying out?”
“I remember inhaling water. And sinking. It felt like it lasted forever. And I remember how scared I was, how panicked, and then - ” Dean swallows. “And then I was on shore.”
“You’re cute,” he says. “In, like… a sexier way.”
“Okay?”
Sneaking a glance at his dad, Dean doesn’t answer for a moment. He clears his throat.
“You’ve gotta be hungry. You want some chili?” Obviously not actually looking for an answer, Bobby pulls a bowl out of a cabinet. He continues talking as he spoons it full. “Had a feeling you were gonna sleep a while. Looks like you needed it.” When Bobby finally turns to him again, Dean is still standing in the doorway. “You want some cheese to sprinkle on it?”
“Okay. Call me when you need to be picked up.”
These first few weeks of July have been admittedly stifling. While Dean doesn’t like to give in to Cas’s whining about the temperature, he has to admit that it’s been pretty awful. The rain has been doing nothing to cool the days off, and instead has just made it oppressively muggy. The humidity is sticky and stuffy and Dean can feel it in his lungs.
The days are getting noticeably shorter. It’s no less hot during the day, but the evenings come sooner and are a bit cooler as it gets into the second half of August.
, and you didn’t - ”
“That ain’t the first one I got, kid. I think they’re lookin’ for a response from you.”
“Yeah, I hear,” Dean says. He can’t say he’s much of a cat person, but he finds himself smiling and he has to admit, she is beautiful. “She’s fat.”
“No, I’m not.”
“Shit.”
“Excuse me - ”
“Hmm…?”
“Hey,” Dean says to Jo before he heads out. “I was thinking about getting Ash to hook me up for tomorrow night. You wanna come with us?”
The sun is low behind him but it’s not quite set, casting the beach in a hazy sort of light that seems to blur the edges of things. There are a few herring gulls coasting overhead but even they are quiet, and Dean settles in the sand.
“And you?” Castiel asks quietly, his eyes shadowed and searching.
“How do you - ” Two more dorsal fins breach, a little ways behind the others. “Oh, I see them. Nice eyes, Cas.”
“Dean.”
John’s throat works and he swallows, his gaze flitting from one of Dean’s eyes to the other, maybe unfamiliar with what he sees glaring back at him. His voice is gruff when he speaks.
It’s not quite cold out by any means. The sun still shines down warmly, but the air doesn’t feel much like summer. It seemed to happen overnight - the Earth had been making its way towards fall for weeks, but it’s like everything else had just realized it, and rushed to catch up. There’s an edge to the air, a crisp that threatens to move in in the coming weeks, but for now the sun is still giving as much as it can. Enough that the sand is still warm beneath Dean’s bare feet.
Cas nods in understanding. “That’s okay.”
“C’mere,” Jody says, tipping her head towards the front desk. “You can sign out his possessions, and you’re good to go. You’re eighteen, now, right?”
“No.”
Tugging the door open, Cas slides in with a huff.
He smooths his own hand up Cas’s back, his skin soft, and he pretends that Cas doesn’t have to leave, eventually.
Dean swallows. His face feels hot and he’s not sure what to say so he just nods.
Sammy reaches for him again, and Dean offers up one of his fingers for him to hold. No crib here, so Sammy’s sleeping with Dean in the big bed, surrounded by pillows on all sides so he can’t roll off. It’s the biggest bed Dean has ever slept in. The sheets smell like dusty books and coffee and he finds it comforting so he focuses on that and on Sammy’s baby smile, and he doesn’t think about the sound of his echoing breath.
Dean has no idea the last time he talked about this out loud. In fact, he doesn’t think he’s ever talked about this out loud, to anyone. He focuses on keeping his breathing steady.
Maybe he can clean up a little bit now. If he at least gets the seaweed out of the water and picks up around the deck, it won’t look nearly as bad when his dad gets home in the morning.
“Nothing,” Sam says, but the way he shrugs says otherwise.
Suddenly Cas is behind him, and sliding his hand over Dean’s wrist. It’s only then that he realizes he’s leaning over the sink, the water on full blast, holding the wet paper towel loosely in one hand. His other hand is busy digging his knuckles sharply into his side.
Dean feels himself flush. “This is ridiculous,” he mutters. “You’re turning me soft, Cas.”
The rain that was called for in the forecast comes later than expected, but it does indeed come. It starts on Friday and continues through the weekend, with little indication of stopping before the following week. Many renters who came for the holiday leave earlier than they had scheduled because of the weather, something John is immediately grumpy about when he gets back.
Sam’s somewhere else in the grocery store, sent off by Dean to grab some things, so he only has a few minutes until he comes looking for him again. Hopefully the ‘Personal Care’ aisle isn’t the first place his kid brother will look. Dean’s face flushes.
“Hello?”
Dean’s heart thuds in his chest. He squeezes his hands into fists, trying to keep his nerves down. Anxious, he glances furtively over his shoulder to make sure there’s no one else in the aisle.
“They get dirty after a day.”
“Okay. C’mon, Cas,” Sam says as they walk away. “You wanna pick out one of the chips?”
“Hmm?”
Dean stares. His eyes flick to Castiel’s lips, the glint of his tongue behind his teeth. Without his permission, his arm raises and Cas leans forward to wrap his lips around the spoon and take the bite of macaroni.
Dean shakes his head. “I’m not taking my baby down to the inlet, Sammy. Not with the way nutjobs drive on a holiday weekend.”
“You’re only saying this because you were angry I got away from you.” The venom that Dean hears suddenly in Cas’s voice surprises him. “You couldn’t stand - ”
They go their separate ways in the hall, Sam heading off to his room with one more comment about Dean being a jerk, and “at least Cas is on my side.”
Dean grins at her and swallows. “How’s it going?”
“Check it out!”
“Yeah!”
Dean swallows. He’s never understood how Sam could talk about this stuff so easily, and he kind of envies him for it. He turns back to the eggs.
“Yeah, I - I see them. Listen, man, we gotta get you outta here, okay?” Dean starts rummaging for something that Castiel can cover himself with. “My dad can’t see you. Especially not - like that.”
“Can I help you?”
“You have many visitors recently?” he asks her, listening to her purr in response. “Hmm?”
Dean shrugs with one shoulder. “Maybe a week.”
“I’ll miss you tonight,” Cas murmurs, stepping in close to Dean’s back.
“We’ve let it go on longer than we should have,” she says. “You’ve disgraced us long enough - no more cavorting around with the legged. You’re finished here, Castiel.”
“Yeah,” Dean says sarcastically, but he can tell the look he levels at Cas is soft and it’s affectionate. “I’ve got a half-fish pain in the ass for a boyfriend, but at least my car doesn’t leak.”
Dean flicks his eyes over Cas’s face, from his pink lips, to the water dripping from his chin, to the droplets caught in his eyelashes.
She scoffs. “Okay, yeah, that sucked, but it won’t this time. No pool hopping, I promise.”
“No, I know how, I just don’t - like to. I don’t like the water.” Dean feels his cheeks heat, which just makes him feel more embarrassed. “It’s a long story.”
He scrapes his fingers through his hair and then puts his hands on his hips, stopping his pacing to stare warily at the pool from a few yards away. He can’t get the image of giant blue eyes peering up at him out of his head.
Dean presses his lips together and doesn’t look at her when he responds. “I dunno, maybe.”
“I just realized, senior week starts this weekend.”
With a shrug and almost bashful smile, Dean says, “Yeah, I guess so.”
He finds both Sam and Jo behind the front desk.
“Bruised one of my ribs,” Dean insists, and downs the rest of his drink. “He looked worse than me, though.”
Bobby’s quiet for a beat. “So, you busy tomorrow?”
“Yeah, kid. Get outta here.”
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “Go back to your bed.”
The living room is dark but for the TV, which plays some late-night infomercial with the sound down low. Across the room, the glow from the screen is just bright enough for Dean to discern a figure curled up in the armchair. Too big to be Sam.
Picking at the paper around his cone, Cas avoids Dean’s scrutiny and he shakes his head. “No, um - Frank, he said I didn’t have to come in.”
“I know you’re gonna bitch about it either way, so I’ll just tell you now I put a little extra on there this week - ”
Cas nods in understanding.
“Stay,” Dean repeats with a look. “Please.”
He feels his heart beating behind his sternum and his dad’s gaze on him as they regard one another across the room.
The alarm must show on Dean’s face because Cas frowns across the space between them, suddenly concerned. He turns away from the girl and makes towards Dean just as Alastair points at his turned back and says something to Azazel, who nods.
Brief warning regarding creepy, sort-of-sexual violence/implications (not between Dean and Cas)
“Wait, why?” Dean asks, tapping ash off the end of the joint.
“I named the cat.”
Watching Cas avoid his eyes, Dean mulls that over.
Dean elbows him. “It’s supposed to be
With that, John steps into the room. A single pang of nerves twists Dean’s stomach for the split moment his dad stands over him, towering, but it’s quickly overtaken by bewilderment when John turns and lowers himself onto the mattress to sit beside him.
“No, it’s not - that’s not - ”
Dean also gets a solid amount of work done on the Roadrunner, and it’s Thursday afternoon when he gets her to start for the first time.
In bed, Dean listens to Cas breathe. The guy’s asleep almost immediately, his hand loosely tangled in the hem of Dean’s t-shirt.
“Nothing.”
“Aren’t you?”
“My tail.”
Cas’s frown deepens. “Cassie is short for Castiel, too?”
Sam’s mouth twists and Dean feels guilty.
There’s water in Dean’s lungs and he’s going to die. His eyes sting as he strains to see towards the surface, towards the light, but the light is coming from everywhere and he doesn’t know which way is up and he is drowning.
His heart pounding in his ears, Dean’s hardly listening to his father - instead he’s thinking about sitting with Sam in the dark, convincing his brother their dad’ll be home any day; he thinks of made-up stories about a fearless monster-slayer that just make him sick, now; he thinks of the smell of mildew on an old loveseat in an abandoned shed and of fear in his gut and desperation in his throat and of a pair of Minnesota Twins tickets tucked carefully into John’s wallet -
Gnawing the inside of his cheek, Dean presses a thumb up under his sternum. They pull into the parking lot of Northside Park.
They kiss, Dean’s hand splayed wide across Cas’s bare chest, until they separate again so Dean can pull his own shirt over his head. Both naked from the waist up, they come back together, desperate. When Dean angles his pelvis down into Cas’s again it’s to find, with satisfaction, that Cas is hardening in his pants. He grinds down into him and Cas reciprocates, canting his hips up to meet Dean’s. They rut against each other until they work up a rhythm, surrounded by rain on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere.
Dropping his hand from his face, Dean turns his back on his dad. He stomps to the apartment and has to use all of his self control not to slam the door behind him. He locks it, indifferent to whether or not John has a key. If he wants to sleep in the car, fucking let him.
Sam turns from across the kitchen to watch the interaction happening at the table, a wet bowl and a towel in his hands. Dean catches his eye and tries to ask for help with a look, but Sam just shrugs, as helpless as Dean feels.
“Because then you’ll get attached to her. And then when she gets adopted you’ll be even more sad to see her leave.”
He doesn’t remember hitting the water, or even falling.
“Put your seatbelt on,” Dean says.
“Shit, boy,” he draws the curse out long, pronouncing it in two syllables -
Cassie smiles, and it’s warm and genuine and Dean feels a little caught off guard but he and Cas follow the girls back towards the house.
The buildings rise over the horizon and get taller, and Dean recognizes the skyline. He hasn’t been to Baltimore since a school field trip his sophomore year, but he finds it hard to forget. He doesn’t think Sammy’s ever been, unless they all went as a family when he was just a baby. Dean doesn’t remember.
But he’s not that lucky. Just as Dean opens his mouth to say goodbye, he hears the door to the motel room shutting at the same time that Cas’s eyes flick to the doorway and a mortified expression comes over his face.
“Ignore her,” Dean mutters. “She’s a bitch.”
“Oh. But why are you still here? How come you didn’t go back home?”
“Hm.”
Waves crash, reach, and pull away.
Stunned, Dean stills. His heartbeat echos in his ears, and the tide crashes a few meters to his right but it sounds distant. He stares at Cas, blinks.
“Okay?”
“What, no - I mean, I know, I know that Cas, he - ” Dean swallows hard, tries to ignore how his stomach churns like the water does below them, the sound of the waves far-off in his ears. “Cas pulled me out, he told me that - I mean, I remember, I remember him. He said he recognized me - ”
“We’re not rushing, but I told Cas I’d get him from work before going to Bobby’s.”
Dean agrees, and they head that way. They hand over the last of their tickets and climb on, Dean getting on the seat across from Sam and Castiel. The dolphin’s allowed on this one, so Cas holds it happily in his lap.
“Ouch,” Cas says, rubbing his chest.
He’s back in the Impala with the engine running before he even knows he’s gotten off the ground.
“Thank you,” Cas murmurs. “You still feeling okay?”
“Yes. They know.”
It looks like half the ocean had washed up into it. The water is murky and sandy and full of seaweed, and he can’t even see the bottom of it.
“Not for too much longer,” Dean says as he places a stack of plates in the cupboard.
“Dean,” he gestures over his shoulder. “And this is Cas.”
He falters, being practically showered in tickets as the machine flashes and makes noise, and he finally misses his third button. Sam and Dean immediately jump forward and grab him, shaking him by the shoulders and cracking up.
“It was an accident!” Cas insists, waving his popsicle.
“Give them to me,” Cas demands, and Dean grumbles.
“A kid from the wrong side of the highway,” she smirks. “You and your bad boys, Dean.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, voice sticking. He fiddles with the spoon in the chili in front of him, but doesn’t take a bite.
“He’s fine,” Dean says. “Just had a little too much to drink.”
The water’s up to his waist and it’s slowing him down and his lungs are seizing and it’s all he can think about, leaning a palm against the wall and trying to draw in air.
in my pool, and it sassed me, and it splashed water on me, and I think I’m losing it.” No matter how many times Dean blinks and shakes his head, it’s still there. Lounging in the shallow end, staring at him.
Groaning, Dean grabs a few paper towels and runs them under the sink.
, it’s - it’s an ‘exciting exploration of our local watershed!’ It says it right here, it’s great for those interested in a future in marine biology.”
“Dean.”
was cheating.”
“Dishes are done,” Sam announces, and he hangs the dish towel over the handle of the oven.
are we going?” Sam whines as he, Dean, Cas and Jo pile in the Impala, the sun just setting on the other side of Coastal Highway. “We’re gonna miss fireworks.”
It’s the most noise he’s made in nearly a month, and it seems to take his dad by surprise, startle him. Dean shrieks, clawing at his dad to pick him back up as the monster’s long, slender fingers stretch out for his shoulder. Alarmed at Dean’s panic, his dad scoops him back into his arms, away from the monster, and Dean dissolves into tears.
Together, they get the tickets organized enough to carry them to the counter to cash them in.
“Is that, uh - I mean, are you good here by yourself?”
Dean glances at the clock hanging crookedly on the wall. “I’ve gotta work the night shift at the front desk tonight, and it starts soon. I’ll check and make sure that room one’s still open, and I’ll give you the key and you can let yourself in. You think you can figure out the faucet and stuff for the tub?”
Cas didn’t get washed up because of that storm those months ago.
Castiel looks up as Dean barges in.
“You need any help with anything?” He ultimately asks.
“Thank you,” Dean whispers. “Will you grab my pants?”
, either?” When Castiel shakes his head, Sam looks at Dean in disbelief.
“Fuck you,” Dean spits, unable to care whether or not John can hear or is even listening, and it’s the first time he’s ever said that aloud to his father.
“Oo-kay,” Sam says slowly. He looks Dean up and down, who glances away in irritation. “Is everything cool?”
Cas’s fingertips skim from Dean’s wrist to his hand, where they play over the lines of his palm -
“Watch it, Cas,” Dean grabs him and pulls him out of the way.
He turns to put the food in front of Sam, who squints up at him. Dean tries to hold his gaze, prove his innocence, but can’t for long. He feels strangely brittle.
“Let me explain - ”
“I saw
Dean tips his crab back into the bucket, where it scurries back underneath the sand, and brushes his hands together. Sam does the same.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean replies quietly, and with one more kiss to his temple, Cas pulls away.
Stupid weed. This is why he doesn’t smoke very often.  It makes him twitchy.
“Dad?” He says softly.
Cas nods. He’s stretched across the bench on his back, an arm folded under his head and his legs splayed distractingly. His shoes have been kicked off into the footwell.
“You’re talking about the ponies on the island, aren’t you?” Cas asks, and Sam nods. “They swim from one island to another every year.”
“Oh,” Victor says, getting the hint that Dean would rather sink through the bottom of his seat than talk about this. “Yeah, man, that’s cool.”
Voice soft with wonder, Cas says, “It looks like the ocean.”
“Okay, okay,” Dean waves a hand at him. “I believe you, now don’t drip that thing all over my sheets.”
“A little.”
Now that Cas says it, Dean realizes that he didn’t see his heavy green blanket incorporated into the ceiling of their fort. He didn’t realize that Cas had noticed it was his favorite.
Dean swallows. He and Cas definitely shared the last one the other night. “I dunno.”
“ - I’m goin’ out of town for a little. I’ll be leaving tonight.”
“You can go, Sam, but stay close,” Dean says, and his brother nods at him before dropping his shoes with Dean and Cas and tromping down to the shore. “You wanna sit?” Dean asks a little awkwardly.
Dean hoots, grinning. “Cas, you
With fistfulls of his shirt and the knife to the back of Dean’s neck, Alastair heaves Dean off his feet. The people around them panic and Dean thrashes - “stop, STOP,
“It’s a fort,” he says, as if his father is an imbecile. He stands, and joins them to look over Cas’s shoulder. “Stir fry!”
“In and out, Dean. You can do this, I know. You’re okay. You’re gonna be okay.”
Blinking at a spot over his dad’s shoulder, Dean shakes his head. “No, sir. I’m not. I was just trying to help.”
It’s because Dean’s been avoiding his room that it isn’t until that third morning that he finds them. They must’ve been there this whole time, but he hadn’t done more than glance at his bed in three nights. He’d come back from taking a shower after leaving his dad in the kitchen with his coffee and is pulling on a pair of jeans when he spots them. Dean frowns.
On the mornings after he does stay the night with Dean, Castiel picks up a habit of going on early walks. More times than not, after a night that Cas slept in his bed, Dean will wake up to find him gone. Cas always returns mid-morning, never later than nine-thirty or so, strolling up through the parking lot with his hands in his pockets.
“Okay.”
“Dean - ”
“What street did we live on?”
“What does it mean?”
“You’re nervous now?”
“You guys, Kiss Cam!”
“You did it!” Sam says. “That was amazing!”
At a loss for words, Dean continues to gape at him. Bobby meets his look with his own somewhat guarded expression.
“Answer me, Dean,” John says, loudly, and all of a sudden he’s in Dean’s space and Dean’s being crowded across the hall until his back hits the wall. John’s got a fistful of the collar of Dean’s shirt, and he gets in his face.
“Oh,” he clears his throat. “Hey, Cassie.”
Cas gasps.
“But what if he says no?” Dean chokes out, voice croaking on the fresh worry that he didn’t want to admit.
Dean nods again. “Okay.”
was cheating!”
The sun fell closer and closer towards the horizon as Cas walked. It moved behind a line of trees and cast long shadows over the road, as if the forest was folding in on itself. The moving shadows were reminiscent of how the sky had opened up above the crevice to Hell, after God had ripped open the earth.
“I said no more shots. The rest is up to you.” She winked over her shoulder as she turned to get a drink for someone else.
Dean.
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
Dean pointedly lifted the half-full bottle to his lips and took a long sip. When Sam didn’t leave, and only stared at him harder, Dean groaned, “I’ll think about it.”
Next chapter will be a human!Castiel AU that I actually wrote a while back when I had the urge to write something fluffy. It turned, unsurprisingly, into more angst than fluff. Talk to you then!
Of course, Cas had said yes anyways. It wasn’t often that he got to ride shotgun in the Impala. The width of the car was easier to notice from the front seat than it was from the back. This close to the windshield, Cas could see the whole road out in front of them; he could see the darkening skyline as if it were being painted with deeper and deeper shades before his eyes. The road whipped like a cement snake underneath them.
Relieved to finally be alone again, Dean flicked the TV back on. His eyes kept straying, for whatever reason, towards Cas’s picture on his ID card. Dean flipped the card over. He forced himself to pay attention to the TV. If the first person he thought of when the jokes made him laugh was the same person whose ID badge he was steadfastly ignoring, that was only a coincidence.
Magnificently cursed
“Look at me, Dean”
“What the Hell happened?” Dean asked roughly. His heart fired double time inside his chest.
Cas kicked his foot against the pavement, hitting a pebble and sending it scurrying sideways. The pebble came to a bouncing stop against the base of a thin metallic pole. A bus stop sign, Cas realized as his eyes followed it upwards. He’d found a bus stop.
“Castiel!” Dean called once again, and his voice bounced against the tight walls, coming back to his ears distorted and thin. His footfalls, the raindrops, and the wind rattling between it all covered any other sounds that he may have heard, like the swishing of Cas’s coat as he walked or his breathing. With the darkness thick all around him, and the weather drowning out his hearing, Dean felt he was running out of options. “Cas, buddy. Are you there?”
Dean dropped his head down, both hands coming to clutch at his ears. He hardly registered his phone falling to the ground, skitting against the concrete. He yelled out loud, just to drown out a tiny portion of the screeching with something of his own. The wind knocked Dean onto his knees, the ground wet and hard. His hands clutched his face, his fingers scratching against his skin. His eyes, squeezed shut, felt like they were dripping. He told himself that it was just rain water lapping over his skin.
“Do you remember, in the kitchen?” Castiel asked quietly.
“... What… fire?” Cas started, then shook his head slightly, figuring that he’d missed some unimportant joke, and delved into what he really had to say. “Thank you for allowing me to rest here. I’ll be on my way now.”
