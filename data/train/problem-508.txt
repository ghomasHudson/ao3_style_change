It had taken John a solid week to convince Sherlock Holmes that they should decorate every square inch of the flat they could with Christmas lights and decorations this year, and another two days to convince him to
A smartly dressed doorman let them inside, and they approached the reception desk, both taking in the vaulted ceiling and massive chandelier sending glints of light around the chic vintage themed foyer.
He came hard between their bellies with a guttural cry, pulse after pulse of pearly white seed spurting from him until he collapsed limply against the bed beneath John. The sensation of his muscles contracting and squeezing around him was all it took for John to find his own release, screaming Sherlock’s name as he filled him up, his vision fading out for a moment.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he turned back around, but quickened his pace nonetheless. Despite his pride, he knew from past experience that it was unwise to mess with John Watson when he was cold, hungry, and tired.
John slowly made his way down the grassy bank, stopping short at the water’s edge. He felt the slow-moving water lap at the toes of his trainers as he eyed the pile of Sherlock’s discarded clothes. Unsure what to do, he cleared his throat loudly. Sherlock heard him and sank back down into the water to swim over to him, smiling.
John turned his head, wondering if perhaps he might find a suitable, unattached person in which to have a crafty snog and try to work out some of the building sexual tension which seemed to be almost at a rolling, boiling point inside him.
John shrugged and nodded, giving Sherlock non-verbal permission, so he informed the driver of the change of destination and they headed off in the direction of the closest restaurant.
and the younger man could do nothing but throw his head back and grind his hips, starting a stuttering rhythm whilst his hands supported him on John’s chest.
When they reached the bathroom John pushed Sherlock inside the shower and backed him up against the cold wall, viciously recapturing his swollen mouth with a renewed vigor. John started to trail his hands up and down the other man’s body in long strokes as they kissed, and Sherlock followed his lead.
After all he doubted his own expression was much better at that moment, and Sherlock Holmes never missed a detail.
“I’m not sure I’ll be the best judge…” Sherlock admitted, toes clenching in the duvet at the bottom of the bed, “But I’m sure I will enjoy it nonetheless.”
John sighed as they finally entered the room and pulled the door shut, tossing their luggage onto the rack at the foot of the bed.
John kissed it away tenderly, and then they were both crying softly, holding each other so tightly in the darkness no force on heaven or earth could ever tear them apart.
He only allowed the whole thing to last a couple of minutes, not wanting things to be over before they began, slipping off with an indecent pop.
Before John could speak, Sherlock spun on his heels and disappeared, his departure punctuated by his bedroom door slamming so hard the china rattled in the cupboards.
He gently slid out of Sherlock, both men stopping a moment to take in the evidence of their lovemaking trickling out of him.
John I’m going to…I can’t…” Sherlock gasped out as his orgasm took him, painting hot stripes between their bellies.
Greg had sunk down a few inches in his seat, looking as though he would quite like to hide under the table. John would happily join him.
They found themselves still huddled around the warm fire long after their dinner had been consumed, toasting the marshmallows that John had insisted on bringing, making easy conversation as they stared up at the glittering canopy of stars.
! To admit that there was a chance and John would call it all off, tell Mycroft to bugger off and get out of their business. If only Sherlock would say something, then John could put this all behind them…
"Have you...please tell me you haven't been sitting in that same spot the entire bloody day" John remarked, lips curving into a vaguely amused smile.
Sherlock made quick work of ridding him of his trousers, lust blown pupils locking with John’s as he took hold of the last piece of clothing standing between them and total, delicious nakedness.
“Ladies and Gentlemen,” the announcer said into the microphone which was attached to a stand in front of a large, live band, “Please put your hands together for Mr and Mr Lestrade-Holmes!”
John sighed, and kissed him tenderly on the tip of his nose. Sherlock wasn’t wrong, part of him ached fiercely with sadness and regret that they had danced around each other for so bloody
“Changed my mind, darlin’” Greg smiled as he began to gently sway as his daughter began to sing “Fly Me to the moon” in a soft, jazzy style.
Taking a deep breath he unzipped his sleeping bag and climbed inside. Sherlock was already asleep, or pretending to be, eyes tightly closed and hands clasped together on his chest.
John gasped, an electric shiver running down his spine seeing Sherlock like this. The sight was so erotic, so tantalising that John had to bite his lip in order to stave off his orgasm.
He reached for his own shirt, removing it in a manner that deliberately mirrored John’s earlier action. Was this heading where John thought it was?
Everything went white and static around him as he shuddered, repeating Sherlock's name over and over like a sacred prayer.
An hour later, John had finally finished securing the last tent pole. He stood back to admire his hard work, only to go stiff when it finally dawned on him that Sherlock still had not returned with the firewood.
Without warning tears welled up in Sherlock's eyes, spilling over to streak down his face before he could stop them, and he put a hand to his mouth to stifle a sob.
"Sherlock, you know you can tell me anything, don't you? After all we've been through, there's nothing you could say to me right now that I won't be able to handle."
John was all too happy to oblige, driving blow after blow directly into the detective’s sweet spot, Sherlock wrapping his legs around John and holding on for dear life as he cried out his name over and over.
“The hearts! Honestly, John, it isn’t as though I asked you to do anything diffic-....” he trailed off, staring at the older man’s wound, and John became aware of the feeling of a small amount of warm blood trickling down his leg.
“Am I dying?” Sherlock whispered in a panic, eyes wide and slightly filled with terror, “My heart is pounding and my mouth is dry and -- and -- my stomach feels like there are swarms of bees in there!”
Looking at the ground, he strode over to the tree, waiting to make sure Sherlock had his back turned before he made quick work of changing. When he returned, Sherlock had resumed floating. Wincing, John dipped one foot into the water but was relieved to find it to be just as pleasant as Sherlock had promised.
John leaned in, attempting to kiss Sherlock only to be stopped when the detective pulled back, turning his head and avoiding John’s lips which made something deep in John’s belly clench.
John felt his cock twitch in excitement at the mere thought of what Sherlock was asking him to do, the idea of being the first to
John frowned as he pressed the listening device to Sherlock’s chest, moving it around and then humming softly “Sounds clear, heart is racing but not anything to worry about unless you are in pain?”
“I…” John started, falling silent when Mycroft slowly leaned across the table until they were eye to eye, mere inches between their lips.
"It came to my attention just now how much I've been letting you down, John. You've been working longer hours, Rosie has been so difficult lately that you're so sleep deprived you should probably be dead, dishes and laundry piling up everywhere...and I've done
“It’s called being caring, Sherlock. It also happens to be quite important to maintain a little thing called
“Says who?” Sherlock replied, staring at John in challenge, “Who says I do not enjoy, crave and covet
Just when he was about to give up hope and go sprinting into the woods in the dark after his infuriating partner, the sound of approaching footsteps made him jump.
But, as great as the moment was, John knew that if he was to truly have any kind of honest relationship with Sherlock Holmes he was going to have to tell him the truth and bring their current happy state crashing down around them. He could only hope that their bond was strong enough to put the pieces back together.
Sherlock gasped, clearly just as aware of the matching hardness now pressing against his own as John was.
With shaky hands, Sherlock took hold of the material and slowly pulled them down John’s legs.  His long cock sprang free to rest against his belly, precome dripping from it. Sherlock gulped and wrapped his fist around it, and awkwardly attempted to stroke it a few times. John huffed out a shaky laugh and closed his hand around Sherlock’s, guiding his movements to show him how he liked it. John moaned as the other man picked up the pace, his head lolling back in pleasure.
It was quite late. He realized upon glancing at his watch that clearly Sherlock had gotten them lost at some point.
He wanted the passion and the romance, the frustration and struggle but he just wanted to be loved unconditionally.
“No I don’t!” John protested as he took the bottle back, “Just b’cos I like sex! Just… Just because you don’t!”
John took a deep breath to try and slow his thundering heart and began fishing through his backpack in the near dark for his phone.
They were going to have to have a serious conversation about his misusing their kitchen as a lab later, John decided.
Sherlock's cock was thin and long, much like the man himself and John felt the urgent need to see it, to taste it and touch it. To smear the wetness across himself and use his own against Sherlock to mark them in a primal, feverish desire.
Sherlock jumped to his feet, which was a poor decision because he lost his balance and immediately faceplanted into the floor with considerable force.
It was true that they had been through a lot together and grown much closer after Sherlock's 'death' and Mary's murder.
John watched as Sherlock’s cock gave a few thickening pulses, twitching as Sherlock fought against the urge to ejaculate. It was incredibly erotic to watch as Sherlock battled with himself internally, trying to get control.
I’m about to…” John managed to choke out in warning when he felt his pleasure reaching its highest point, and braced himself against the wall.
Sherlock did not hesitate to bid him entrance, and in a fraction of a moment they were exploring each other's mouths in a whole new way.
He began pacing back and forth across the length of the small room, his chest beginning to tighten in the familiar beginnings of an anxiety attack.
"Here you go. I'm not leaving until I've seen you eat it" John said when he returned a few minutes later holding a plate of buttered toast, startling Sherlock out of his pondering.
Swallowing Sherlock’s come wasn’t something John had lusted over - but now he was in the middle of it he felt incredibly aroused. He chased the taste, licking around Sherlock’s foreskin to catch the last drops and then leaned back against the pillow with a cheeky smile. The smile was soon wiped from his face when Sherlock immediately moved for a deep and passionate kiss, moaning against John’s tongue as he tasted himself. His cock gave another throb where it was resting on John’s collarbone but Sherlock knew neither of them would be able to go for a second round.
John made a beeline for the bathroom, showering and brushing his teeth faster than he had in his entire life.
“Fucking hell…!” John hissed, thrusting up once, twice and then he came with a grunted curse and Sherlock’s name, filling the younger man deeply.
“It meant nothing…” John promised, pulling Sherlock up so they could look at one another tenderly, John’s hand coming to cup Sherlock’s cheek, “I hoped… I wanted… God, I was thinking of you the entire time.”
“John, I want you to fuck me” Sherlock whispered huskily into John’s ear as they moved, making his cock twitch.
"Do come along, John, I've examined corpses more lively than you" Sherlock called over his shoulder in the dark as he trudged toward the hotel with long purposeful strides, his suitcase bumping along the pavement aggressively behind him.
“I know…” Sherlock smiled weakly, still unable to meet John’s eyes. “That is why - If I am to do this… to indulge my carnal side which has been repressed for so long, it could only be you. It has to be you, John.”
When the urge had passed, Sherlock slumped against the bed and cracked open his eyes, smiling shyly “The image was a little -- too provocative.”
Very gently, John licked at the seam of Sherlock’s lips, surprised when the detective immediately bid him entrance.
"Not so much anymore. He's really not a bad guy sometimes, your brother. You really should give him a chance, Sherlock."
John nodded, snaking his hand between their bodies so that he could carefully stroke Sherlock’s cock which had flagged significantly and was now mostly soft, leaking pre-come across John’s hand from the wrinkled skin of his foreskin.
"Thank you," he said with a curt nod as he accepted the small piece of plastic from her, and the pair began heading for the lift.
“Sherlock Holmes! Jesus Christ!” John yelled, choking on his water and breaking into a coughing fit.
John smirked, Sherlock obviously had a much higher opinion of John’s sex life than was strictly true.
John nipped and sucked at the other man’s throat as they worked their way up into a fast rhythm, intent on marking him. Sherlock grabbed John’s free hand roughly and closed it around his cock, which had been bouncing neglected against his stomach as they rocked. John happily obliged, pumping the flushed organ in his closed fist as he thrust into him. The doctor paused a moment to adjust his angle, and the very next roll of his hips drove him straight into Sherlock’s prostate.
Sherlock’s head lolled back, and he grasped awkwardly at the shower wall behind him for purchase as he moaned and whined, seemingly unsure what to do with his hands.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sighed as they paid the driver and got out of the car. "No, he does not. I often daydream about having someone tattoo 'Attention Seeker' across his forehead. That or 'Princess', I haven't decided."
Conversation turned to the story of how the proposal came about as Greg explained how John had helped him with everything from picking out the ring, to selecting the restaurant, and even planning the proposal itself. The couple then shared stories with John and Sherlock of their time dating.
After a moment of brief deliberation, he donned a simple pair of pyjama pants and an old comfortable t-shirt, before returning to the living room. He had considered making a grand entrance sans clothing, but feared he would spook Sherlock, so decided against it.
The conversation John had held with the eldest Holmes brother suddenly came flooding back, filling in the hazy gap in his memory and made his stomach swoop so dramatically that for a moment John had to gulp in a few breaths, pushing the nausea down rapidly.
His hormone flooded brain suddenly reminded him of Sherlock’s virginity, and he made a mental note to exercise some self-restraint, rather than turn into a sex-crazed maniac and scare him off. There was no way in
John smiled and slowly slid them down Sherlock’s legs, inch by inch, until his impressively large cock sprang up to his belly, flushed and hard.
Sherlock scowled, refusing to meet his eyes. “Don’t patronise me, John. I’m well aware of how pathetic it is that I could manage to ruin something so simple in such
Neither man spoke and awkwardness grew in the stretched silence between them before John sighed and turned, grasping Sherlock’s cheek and pressing a slow and soft kiss to those plush lips which had been in his dreams for so long. Sherlock stiffened, nervous and skittish before he relaxed and let his lips fall slack enough for John to caress with his own.
“Fine! Bloody hell. I don’t see why I need to do this! It’s -- ridiculous! It’s torturous! You don’t understand, John… You don’t see what I see!” Sherlock whined low, “I can read every activity on Mycroft’s terrible body. I know exactly what Geoff and him are up to in that sordid little hovel of their bedroom!”
“You must be joking, Sherlock,” he said incredulously, gesturing vaguely at his current fully clothed state.
Sherlock hissed, obviously unable to hide the grimace of pain and discomfort as he was stretched wider than he ever had been before. John stilled his hips, holding steady even though his entire body ached with the overwhelming desire to just
John frowned. “How long what?” he asked distractedly,  far more interested in pressing another kiss to Sherlock’s soft mouth.
“Yes, an arachnid! Known for their web building!” Sherlock hissed, “Now kindly leave me alone, I need to clean myself…” he said looking down at the come, which was dribbling down his chest to rest back on the softening cock nestled in his wet pubic hair.
“The last time you were ‘bored’ you shot holes in the walls, and this is considerably less destructive, so if you really want to play doctor I won’t stop you I suppose.”
“Really?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow, “Muffled like the other day in the shower? I didn’t hear what you said but I heard the noises. I heard your moans of orgasm.”
John had never heard Sherlock swear, not once in their year of cohabitation and hearing the words come from that posh mouth shocked and surprised him for a second until he collected himself and responded.
Sherlock wasn't sitting by the remains of the fire as he was expecting. Instead, John caught sight of a note stuck to the log flapping in the wind.
Suddenly remembering something very important that they had neglected to talk about, he rummaged through his drawer again and held up a condom in his hand.
John wasted no time throwing off his clothes before stepping into the shower, sighing as the scalding hot water lashed down his back.
They sat in the back of a taxi ten minutes later, John gingerly examining Sherlock's hand. "Well it isn't as bad as it looks, thank god. Only the tip has gone in."
The room fell quiet except the soft moans of their lovemaking and the noise of London outside the windows. Somewhere a dog barked and a car alarm went off but neither man noticed, too happy to maintain the eye contact which connected them almost as much as their groins did. It didn’t take long for John to feel the rising of his climax, knowing that it would be intense due to the earlier teasing. He held Sherlock’s hip tighter, tight enough to bruise, and gasped out a warning “I’m close… Oh god, it’s too good”
His arms were now thoroughly tangled into the mess of lights, and he slumped back down into his chair, defeated.
Sherlock bit his lip and slid the dial-up several notches. John jumped in his seat and bit his own hand to stifle a moan.
Trying to put the awful argument with Sherlock to the back of his mind, John raced through the shower and shaved, almost nicking himself twice in his haste.
, Sherlock. If you want to stop here, I am not going to judge you, there is no shame in wanting to take it slow. I want your first time to be as
John put out a hand, and when Sherlock helped him to his feet the doctor clasped it and started leading him out of Sherlock’s bedroom.
"Quite a significant sum, which did seem a little odd at the time. Not to worry though John, I used your card" he smiled helpfully.
Sherlock gave him his best impression of puppy dog eyes, which only served to make him look like he was having a seizure.
“I take it you didn’t find the mushrooms?’ John asked lamely, unable to conjure any other less embarrassing, coherent sentences on such short notice. He figured he could hardly be blamed, not when the same man for whom he had harbored feelings for several years was swimming practically naked a few feet away from him.
“I’m sorry…” John whispered as he pulled back for air, pushing their foreheads together by pulling Sherlock’s neck down, “I’m so sorry. I was a dickhead. I shouldn’t have reacted like that…”
Without warning Sherlock leaned over the top of him, dislodging John from his badly balanced stance causing them both to go crashing down into the half-filled tub of water, suits and all.
When dessert arrived some time later, John’s eyes slid to Greg, who sat up straighter in his chair as Mycroft stared at the cloche that was placed before him instead of his order. Sherlock frowned from where he sat beside John, just as confused.
Casting a furtive glance at the younger man, John observed Sherlock's arms folded across his chest, his brows knit into a frown that he couldn't quite decipher, but he tried not to dwell on it.
“Do enjoy Paris.” Sherlock responded, “Since you can no longer afford a chauffeur, I hear the public bus routes are not as bad as they seem.”
Sherlock couldn't help but grin impishly at the words despite himself, enjoying the revelation that he still had that effect on his husband.
When they approached their table, they were met with Mycroft’s irritated glare, and a very amused Gregory Lestrade.
. You might have read about that word somewhere in one of your books?” John grinned, kicking it up a notch when the chorus hit again and laughing at Sherlock’s expressions as he danced in a circle around him, with no intention of stopping.
“What other brother would have stayed awake to escort their demanding baby brother onto the garden lawn with a sleeping bag and a flask of tea to watch Halley's Comet pass by in 1986?” Sherlock said as his lower lip wobbled. “You were my best friend. Until John, you were my
“Oh yes, an absolute blast” John played along through chattering teeth, his small smile matching Sherlocks. Before he could stop himself, his eyes began to slowly trail down the length of the younger man’s body, stopping to stare a moment too long at the way the see-through shirt that clung to his body was revealing his cold-stiffened nipples. He caught himself a moment too late; when his eyes came back up they met Sherlock’s, and that same amused smile from the lake was back.
Not offering to be the one to get up to Rosie in the middle of the night even though John had work in the morning, cluttering the house with his experiments right after John had finished cleaning- there were a hundred little ways that he could have made his husband's life easier.
When they finally jumped out of the taxi and sprinted into the restaurant to get out of the rain, they were ten minutes late and John was already seriously regretting the idea of having to follow through on his promise to withhold sex.
John snorted and joined him in walking the long hedge-lined path to the entrance of their lodgings for the night.
“We are so incredibly happy for you both!” he smiled at the happy couple, running a soothing hand up Sherlock’s leg under the table when he noticed his boyfriend's mouth still hanging open, until he felt him relax beneath his touch.
John knew that Sherlock would be grumpy. A day when he couldn’t make it all about himself and had to put aside his constant need for attention in order to allow the happy couple to enjoy and finally unashamedly show their love to the world.
Sherlock pulled his eyes from the microscope to give John a look from top to bottom before sighing sadly.
Sherlock nodded, the movement minuscule as he could barely move his head with John’s hands around his cheeks.
A few moments later they were interrupted by Sherlock's phone vibrating on the edge of the tub. John caught it just before it fell into the water and passed it to him. The younger man took one look at the caller ID and rolled his eyes.
John's heart swelled as he nodded and brought Sherlock's hand up to his mouth to kiss before beginning to kiss up Sherlock's neck and shoulders, over his chest and then back up to his lips which he kissed with passion, dipping his tongue into Sherlock's mouth and groaning as his hands explored across the soft, perfect skin of Sherlock's abdomen. Sherlock's breathing hitched when John brushed against his nipples which were swollen and taut against John's fingers. Smiling devilishly, John massaged the nubs with his fingertips, rolling them and pinching them gently as he kissed and licked with desire.
The receptionist nodded, smiling up at them after consulting her computer, "How lovely, we haven't had the pleasure of guests in that room for far too long!" Here is your keycard. Suite 4, level 2."
Realising that it was no use lying to Sherlock, who would be able to see right through him, John gave a half shrug
There was a much bigger reason behind John’s urgency to have the younger man make up with Mycroft, and he wished he could explain it to Sherlock, but he had promised Greg he wouldn’t let the surprise slip.
Mycroft surged to his feet, and they shared a tender kiss, foreheads pressed together as the whole restaurant clapped and cheered, John clapped along, and turned to watch as Sherlock sat open mouthed and shocked. John touched his lovers chin with a smile and watched as he closed it with a snap.
The crowd clapped as a beaming Greg and a clearly shy Mycroft got into position, their hands clasped together in one hand with Greg’s other hand on Myc’s waist and Mycroft’s hand on Greg’s shoulder. The announcer had stepped away, allowing a young woman to step up to the mic and smile at them, giving Greg a happy but teary-eyed smile.
After remaining ignored for several moments, John cleared his throat loudly and the woman, who's clothes were covered in cat fur, John noticed, jumped almost comically high in the air.
“And if you’re lucky, there’s something else we haven’t done yet that we might try in the morning. I’ll let you make your deductions. I’m sure it won’t take you long at all to crack this particular case” he whispered into his lover’s ear.
Moaning loudly Sherlock twisted his wrist and felt his eyes roll back in his head at the tingling which ran down to his toes. His hips were already moving by themselves, fucking up into the clasp of his hand as his mind created the most deprived images of John spread out on Sherlock’s high thread count sheets, out of his mind with pleasure and desperately asking for more. The thought of John whining and seductively wriggling for more contact brought Sherlock to the edge so quickly that he felt momentarily dizzy. The rolling pleasure of his orgasm washed over him with such intensity that Sherlock had to use the hand in his mouth to grab onto the sheets, needing something to steady himself as he came hard in thick pulses from belly to chest. Sherlock gasped, holding his breath before barking out “John!” as he came, stroking himself through the climax.
Rather than answering, Sherlock snatched it from his hand and threw it across the room, making John cackle in surprise.
“Alright, if we head another kilometer or so in this direction, there’s supposed to be an old hunting cabin” he yelled out.
“M’rning.” John grunted as he poured himself a cup of extremely strong coffee, leaning back against the kitchen cabinets.
Dripping a trail of water after him, John set off to explore the few tiny rooms in the hope of finding blankets they could use to warm themselves up. Finding nothing but a bathroom and a small bedroom containing nothing more than a chest of drawers and two small fold-out beds, he gave in. Upon returning to the living area, Sherlock had clearly been far more successful in finding a means to warm their freezing bodies. The younger man was crouched on a large woolen rug in front of the stone fireplace that John had failed to notice, feeding kindling into a fire that was already building to a roar.
He didn’t miss the way that the younger man fleetingly wet his lips when he thought John wasn’t looking, the way he turned his gaze to the floor shyly.
“Sherlock…” John whispered, suddenly sad at putting Sherlock through this emotional whirlwind, “I don’t want him… I want
John moaned as Sherlock practically forced his tongue through John’s lips to seek out his own, and slid his hands into the detective’s dark curls as they hungrily devoured each other's warm mouths.
“I wish to see if Citocybe Rivulosa, or ‘Fools Cap’ mushrooms, grow in this area so that we can determine if the murderer from the Sampson case could potentially have used them to create the poison Molly identified in the lab.”
or worse, speak with my parents.” Sherlock complained, “Mummy has barely stopped crying all day. She’s gone through three packs of tissues, two handkerchiefs and is now working on going through the linen from dinner.”
Keeping his eyes trained on Sherlock the whole time he very slowly began to trace the puckered skin over and over.
“We have plenty of time to explore more when you’re ready. But for now, let’s just cuddle” he said softly, pressing a short peck to the detective’s red and swollen lips.
Sherlock looked nervous, incredibly twitchy as his large hands gripped at John’s back in an awkward attempt at a hug. It was obvious that the other man had no idea what to do with his hands, or any part of his body really. He was basically just holding onto John for dear life.
With one hand around the throbbing member, John began to lick blazing trails up it from base to tip, pausing to dip his tongue into the bead of precum gathering at the slit.
“Not quite,” Sherlock smirked and pressed the remote which set off the vibrations again, feeling the buzzing and tickling in his nose as he began to carefully bob his head and suck as much as he could. Sherlock hadn’t quite managed to fit half of John inside his mouth yet, but he was learning to relax his throat and expected to pick it up in no time.
Sherlock’s lower lip wobbled and his eyes were filled with tears as he nodded “I want that too.” he confessed, before hesitating “John… I… that is… I’ve never said…”
Sherlock was married to his work after all. John was all too aware that any move he made would only end in a ruined friendship and an end to the small sliver of ill-advised hope he carried with him that one day things would change.
John grumbled and swayed with a sluggish, tipsy blink as he motioned to the bored-looking bar staff to refill his pint, having downed the last swirling dregs from the bottom of the glass. The heat of the room was almost overwhelming, with summer well on its way and an evening full of excited work parties and chattering friend groups meeting around him. John slumped further into his seat and sighed sadly.
His mouth slipped from Sherlock's lips to suck at the side of his elegant neck, eliciting a deep moan and another shiver.
John cried out, accidentally flinging his knife across the table, which landed in the top of Sherlock's left hand.
“That includes waiting. I would wait until the end of time and beyond for you.” John promised, leaning in to kiss Sherlock’s forehead tenderly, “And if you’re not ready for sex yet - then you’re not ready. I’m certainly not going to agree for our first time to be whilst we’re pissed up in your brother's sex suite.” he giggled, watching Sherlock’s cheeks blush and a thin smile appear on those lush lips, “I don’t want our first time to be rushed, or interrupted by alcohol. I want to show you how much you mean to me - at home - in
“No, I didn’t. Now, will you please let me through so I can go clean and dress this before it becomes infected?” John asked, jaw clenched in frustration.
“Please don’t feel pressured into anything, Sherlock. I’m not going anywhere” he said softly in the small space between them, stroking one of the younger man’s sharp cheekbones reverently.
For the most part, they worked in silence, but after an hour of accidentally brushing against each other John felt like he was going to implode, and put on the radio. Sherlock didn’t believe in trivial ‘boring people’ things like Spotify.
"I spent hours trying to find the right way to say this, grappling for the right words. But in the end, perhaps the best method is the simplest one."
Sherlock groaned, taking another deep drag of his cigarette before flicking it away where it landed among the perfectly cultivated roses. Sherlock pushed past John, both of them heading inside where the heat of the room rushed over them, making John’s shirt stick unpleasantly to his skin. John noticed Sherlock pointedly ignoring his mother who had once again begun to cry as she watched her eldest child head to the dancefloor, hand in hand with his new groom.
There was a moment of odd silence which stretched out between them, only the low hum of the water jets around them making noise before John inhaled deeply and, in a quiet voice, whispered “Do you?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around them both and they lay that way for a while, the only sound in the room their ragged breaths and racing hearts as the world slowly came back into focus.
The next morning John suggested that they finally give the box of toys they had dragged home with them a proper look, and Sherlock had been more than eager.
Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes for a moment to regain composure before he uttered the four words that had the power to determine whether the rest of his life would still include the man sitting beside him.
With a grin, John climbed up to straddle the detective's lap, and Sherlock crashed his lips to his without a second's hesitation.
He had become so hard it was painful, his cock pressing against the front of his jeans in a desperate bid to be set free, but he was determined to go slow so as not to spook Sherlock again. His hand slid up under Sherlock’s shirt, stroking over his chest and belly. Sherlock emitted an appreciative hum at the touch, encouraging John into finally rolling his hips down into him in earnest. His wandering fingers scraped a hard nipple, and Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath before digging his nails into John’s back painfully for purchase. The doctor hurriedly shoved a hand into Sherlock’s pants to pull out his notably large and thick cock, just in time for him to come in hot spurts all over John’s hand and his own belly with a keening cry.
John held him through the aftershocks of his orgasm, gently stroking his arms until he relaxed, going boneless against the sheets.
“What’s going on?” John asked, puzzled as he put a hand on Sherlock’s forehead only to be slapped away dramatically.
Sherlock grasped at the hem of John's shirt, hastily pulling it over his head when he raised his arms. Despite having no idea what he was doing, Sherlock began to press sloppy kisses to the other man's chest, working his way down. John finally registered that despite his feigned confidence, Sherlock was trembling.
Slowly Sherlock dragged his eyes up to meet John's. Be the outcome good or bad, he wanted to be able to remember the look on John's face later, to tuck away in his mind palace to either reflect upon or lock away and throw away the key.
Speaking of posh people, John headed outside into the extensive grounds of the hotel, breathing in the summer air which was so fresh and rejuvenating after living in London for so long. They were barely two hours away from London but it seemed to be a different country entirely, soft candles burning and the beautiful birdsong as dusk approached.
Sherlock grabbed John’s shirt and pulled him close enough to lavish a long, tender kiss upon his lips.
earlier that night and was now sleeping peacefully. Starting up the stairs, John considered how weird his evening had been, Mycroft hadn’t been anything like he had expected, he had actually been
“I… I thought we could use it to frot against each other? Like… rubbing?” John blushed, but the thought of taking Sherlock was incredibly arousing and his cock twitched against Sherlock’s leg at the thought, something which the detective noticed straight away and moaned at.
The doctor tried very hard not to notice the way the fading orange light that filtered through the trees danced across Sherlock’s handsome figure as he walked, but it was proving difficult.
John awoke the next morning with a groan, thanks to a very persistent bird that insisted on announcing its presence. He rolled over only to find Sherlock already gone, his sleeping bag and clothes from the day before messily discarded.
Had he imagined it, or had there been the slightest hint of a smirk tugging at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth as he spoke?
The doctor rolled his eyes, already disappearing in the direction of the backlit marble bar, then leaping up onto one of the leather stools twirling around on it like a small child, while Sherlock went behind it to start pawing at the shelves.
John's hands had found their way into Sherlock's unruly curls, and he let out a soft moan when the other man's hands slid slowly up the length of his bare back. Sherlock could feel himself starting to get hard, and he gulped again.
John kicked off his shoes and joined him, spreading out his supplies on the table. Once the area was sterilised and Sherlock's hand anaesthetised, John set to work, concluding that they had been very lucky and a hospital visit was not required, the knife having missed anything important.
“How many other Mycroft’s are there in London?” John attempted to bite back, but his hips were already desperately seeking out the heat from Sherlock, urging them to touch.
But front and centre on a little platform was the bed, an obnoxiously large wooden four poster affair complete with silk canopy.
John only became aware of just how close they were when Sherlock leaned over him even further to apply a dressing. His scent wafted straight into John, an odd mix of coffee and chemicals that should have been awful, but somehow was anything but.  John's skin now felt like it was on fire everywhere they touched, especially in the spot where Sherlock's free hand cluelessly rested on his upper thigh as he fussed over the correct position to adhere the dressing to his knee.  They were so close, too bloody
The bees that had inhabited him until now had fled, chased from their hive by an all-consuming smoke.
“I’ve not seen you this excited for one of your dreary dates before,” Sherlock practically snarled from his prone position on the sofa, “Tell me, what’s special about her?”
“So, Gregory, how long have you been degrading yourself by throwing your sausage into that huge, pale pastry?”
Sherlock's hands found John's bare chest as they kissed, long cold fingers trailing down his chest, tangling in the patch of slightly grey hair there.
“Seemingly.” John smiled but felt his heart throb with adoration. This silly bloody man that he loved.
Sherlock looked over at them and rolled his eyes before joining the trio, silently staring at his brother before looking away. John knew something had passed between them, they often spoke without words and only in glances, but John had no idea what was going on.
From this proximity, John could smell the other man’s spicy cologne, a total parallel to anything Sherlock had ever worn on the few occasions when he had actually bothered to wear any.
You cannot seriously expect me to keep faith in plans made during a lack of blood flow to the brain. It’s foolish.” Sherlock grouched, peeping his eye from under the pillow to see if his complaints had worked. They hadn’t.
But before he could act on it Sherlock took over, leaning up to place wet, open mouthed kisses to his own, slowly working his way down John's body until his lips met the trail of hair that disappeared beneath his trousers.
"I didn't. But you are renowned for being too kind for you own good, so I figured if I made a whole show of being cold the chances were pretty high."
“No. Go away.” John heard Sherlock say and turned to look, watching Sherlock leaning against the wall, one foot flat on the bricks and the curls of his hair pushed into the wall. He was fussing with his mobile with one hand, the other was holding a lit cigarette which he brought up to his mouth, took a long drag and then began to blow smoke rings into the night air.
John gently lifted the blanket up and over both of their cold bodies. It was quite thin, but still better than nothing.
John’s heart clenched and a wave of anger flared up inside him at Mycroft putting that pressure onto Sherlock. He rubbed his thumbs across Sherlock’s cheekbones, “You know I'd do anything for you, yeah?” he asked.
Dutifully he trudged through the trees as he followed marker after marker, the sound of leaves and twigs snapping under his feet echoing through the near-silent forest. John had forgotten how much he loved it, being far enough away from civilization to experience true quiet with only his own thoughts for company.
“I love you too, you dickhead.” John laughed, pushing their foreheads together and then leaning down to press a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
John was unsure why he had ever thought that taking up jogging to work was a good idea, but as he sat on the footpath swearing and clutching a raw and badly grazed knee, he realised that it was possibly one of the worst ideas he’d had in a long while. It was of course the one and only Sherlock Holmes that had been responsible for his fall. He had taken his eyes off the path in front of him to check his phone for one moment when it beeped, finding a text from Sherlock wanting him to pick up lamb hearts on his way home, and tripped. Thankfully he wasn’t far from the flat, so the distance he had to travel hobbling like an old man was minimal. Regardless, he cursed Sherlock all the way home, right up until the moment he reached the familiar door of 221B.
“Fuck! Just like that John, don’t stop!” Sherlock cried out, hips flying off the bed once again. John continued his movements, hitting the sweet spot inside of him over and over.
“Have you been drinking non-decaf coffee again?” John sighed, reaching for his medical bag and putting on his stethoscope, “Because you know what that does to you.”
John chuckled, and began working on the buttons of Sherlock's shirt. Just as he was about to toss it to the floor, crying began from behind them.
Their strange staring competition had gone on for several moments before they went their separate ways to change.
not when said man had water dripping down the length of his lightly toned body, and he raised a hand to brush limp, black curls out of eyes that almost matched the colour of the water he was currently treading.
Sherlock didn't need to be told twice, and within minutes he had amassed a considerable pile of fancy bottles with names John wouldn't have had a chance in hell of pronouncing sober, let alone in his current tipsy state.
Wasting no time, the doctor made quick work of undoing the annoying piece of clothing, tossing it out onto the floor.
Reaching for the lube, he pressed a little kiss to the inside of Sherlock’s thigh and slicked up his painfully hard prick. He slid up Sherlock’s long body to position himself and gently touched the head of his cock to the other man’s entrance.
"No, that is definitely the room selection listed on your booking, and I'm afraid we have no other available rooms tonight."
Kissing Sherlock was a whole world away from kissing Mycroft, John thought as they clung to each other desperately in the moonlight, and he immediately knew he was where he belonged.
Before either man had a chance to react, the can tipped on its side, its entire contents raining down to drench them both in the paint. Both men stood silently for a moment, stunned.
Sherlock gasped loudly as John began to slowly slide his finger in and out of his warm channel, making the concerned doctor immediately stop in his tracks.
He had been given the important job of carrying Rosie because John had insisted he make himself useful "
It was cozy, with exquisite vintage furniture and arched windows that looked out over the countryside, two armchairs nestled into a nook on the opposite wall.
“I get tested regularly, and we know you’re clean because you haven’t been exposed to anything since we tested you after the...drug incident, so I’ll leave the choice up to you” he whispered, smiling softly.
“Are you sure it’s supposed to feel like this?” Sherlock asked softly, “Because it's overwhelming and terrifying. I feel like my heart is going to explode!.”
"Well this is...inconvenient" he finally muttered; brows knitted together as he took in the scented candles lit on every available surface.
"I...love...you...John...Hamish...Watson" he whispered fiercely, punctuating the space between each word with another kiss.
“Make sure to make my brother aware of our little arrangement, Dr Watson. Talk up how excited you are to spend time with me, and make it believable. You know Sherlock and his little deductions.”
Greg had sunk down a few inches in his seat, looking as though he would quite like to hide under the table. John would happily join him.
A comfortable silence stretched out between them for a time, John absentmindedly raking his fingers through Sherlock’s hair to comb out the knots.
When he finally forced himself to meet the detective’s gaze, he was shocked to find that Sherlock was grinning.
With nowhere else to look their gazes locked, the candlelight dancing across their faces, an impossibly loud silence stretching out into infinity between them.
Sherlock sighed impatiently ahead of him, his breath coming out in clouds. The sun was slowly setting, and with it, the temperature was plummeting. If the stubborn younger man didn’t decide on a spot to set up camp soon, John was going to shoot him. He had brought his gun just in case he needed it, anyway.
“Jesus John, I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to! I should never have even…” he trailed off, turning away from him.
“Anyway, I’ve left a mop and bucket in the kitchen, and if all that blasted paint isn’t gone by tomorrow I’m adding it to your rent. Not your housekeeper, boys” she smiled sweetly, before turning to plod back down the hallway.
Every point where their bodies made contact buzzed like a thousand bees within him, and he did his best to ignore it, but it was hard.
Knowing better than to push the issue any further when John was in a bad mood, Sherlock moved aside to allow the doctor inside and then disappeared deeper into the flat. John wasn’t sure where he had gone, but he was too tired and cranky after his bad day to care. He plodded to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and half jumped out of his skin when he turned back around to find Sherlock standing in front of him holding a first aid kit.
“I’ve never been with a man… definitely not in love with a man! Probably never been in love with anyone really. Not truly. But the feelings that I have for you were scaring me to death. To hear you say the words first was just a bit overwhelming… I got scared and reacted badly and I’m sorry” John rambled nudging their noses together “I thought id really fucked it up.”
“What if I suggested that we didn’t use them?” Sherlock asked, leg moving to shift between John’s to get closer, “Obviously I have never had any sexual contact, and I was tested last time I went to rehab. I know you’re clean because you’re insanely fastidious about getting tested even though you’ve never had unprotected sex…” he rocked his hips and moaned when their cocks brushed together, “Please? I want to feel it fully. I want to experience what it's like…”
“There, good as new” Sherlock mumbled. He stood, eyes flicking once to John’s as he turned and started to walk away.
With a wicked grin, John crooked his fingers just right to stroke and press at Sherlock’s sweet spot, finding it instantly thanks to many years of conducting prostate exams.
funny? I mean just the expression on your face alone…" he wheezed, pressing a fist to his mouth to prevent more laughter from escaping.
A warm feeling washed over John at the words, at the thought that Sherlock trusted him so implicitly with something that he had struggled with for so long. Perhaps Mycroft really had been right, after all.
The other man didn’t waste a single moment, bringing his lips down to crash eagerly against John’s so fast the older man barely had enough time to close his eyes. John didn’t hesitate, his lips effortlessly finding their home between Sherlock’s. As the moments passed, what started out as a slow and gentle kiss grew faster, more urgent. John’s hand came up to tangle in Sherlock’s curls and the detective moaned, biting the other man’s bottom lip lightly. Whimpering, John swept his tongue against the seam of Sherlock’s lips, which instantly parted for him. Both men groaned into each other’s warm mouths as their tongues made contact, and in an impressive show of strength, Sherlock grabbed John’s hips and pulled him onto his lap.
John smiled and curled in tight to him next to the warm fire, burying his face against the side of Sherlock’s neck.
more than I’ve ever needed anything in my entire life. I refuse to wait another moment when we’ve already lost so much time.”
A long silence stretched between them, and John busied himself with adding more wood to the dying fire.
Not for the first time, he found himself briefly wondering whether the whole thing was just a brutal scheme Mycroft had designed to screw with his younger brother and hurt John all at the same time, just for kicks. He was a Holmes, after all.
He slid down to the floor of the shower, wrapping his arms around his knees and silently sobbing as the water beat down on his head.
"Thank you, John, I am feeling much better already. You may leave now" he announced as soon as he had swallowed the last bite, urging the other man away from the sofa and back towards the kitchen.
The older man sat on the edge of the sofa beside him, and his close proximity brought back the same scent which had gotten him into his current predicament, a scent that was so uniquely
It was then that John noticed the resemblance. Something about the eye shape, or possibly the eye colour which suddenly made John realise that the singer of the band was Greg’s daughter from his first marriage. Katie was at university studying music, and John remembered that Greg had spoken often and excitedly about Katie’s band and how she was travelling the world. Apparently, she had come back especially to perform for her dad.
John reached out and took both of their throbbing cocks in hand, turning on the shower and using a combination of the water and his own spit to create slickness as he began to stroke them both in unison. Both men moaned deeply at the sensation as John pumped them both languidly with his closed fist.
All eyes went to the plate as Mycroft slowly lifted off the lid, revealing a small velvet box sitting atop a pile of red rose petals.
“I thought…” John began, only for Sherlock to interrupt “I can’t kiss you. Not until you brush your teeth. I cannot have -- You need to wash away the taste of him. The scent of him. I want to delete the entire thing and start fresh.”
Sherlock stilled, and with a keening cry his cock pulsed once before releasing spurt after spurt of hot come that flowed down and over John’s hand. John held him through the aftershocks, enraptured by the sheer ecstasy on his lover’s face as his climax ripped through him. A few more rough thrusts were all it took for John to follow Sherlock over the edge, the strongest orgasm he had ever experienced turning his vision black for a moment as he filled Sherlock with his own release.
. I'm your husband, and supporting each other is what married people are supposed to do! You deserve someone who supports you John, not
Sherlock claimed John’s lips between his as the doctor began to slowly rock back and forth inside him, coaxing his tongue into dancing with his.
Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if the only thing that had ended his shopping spree was the fact that if he purchased anything else, it wouldn't have fit into the cab he had just hailed. John shot him a glare as they climbed into the mercifully warm vehicle, and he began securing Rosie with one eyebrow raised.
Hearing Mrs Hudson leaving, Sherlock put all of his inner strength into surviving the conversation without falling into a dead faint. He refused to beg, refused to plead for John not to leave him.
With his eyes locked on John's he closed the tiny gap between them and brought his lips down to meet his.
“Gregory, does my brother still make that high pitched squeal like a straining tennis player in bed, the one that you can hear from the other side of the house?”
"Dear god John!" Sherlock moaned as the older man pressed hot, open mouthed kisses to his barely clothed cock, his pale hips bucking wildly off the bed with every touch.
“I have no sympathy,” came the deep voice from below. Sherlock was obviously awake.  “You were incredibly intoxicated last night. It was annoying.”
His hands found Sherlock’s bony hips as they kissed, which were at the perfect level due to their height difference.
“Remind me again what exactly it is we are here for, Sherlock?” he questioned, hissing out a curse when he tripped over a tree root and almost dove face-first into the ground.
. I was getting ready to lock you two in a broom closet or something” she sighed as she took in the sight of the two blushing men in bed together.
After blowing out the candles and banishing all the rose petals and champagne, John turned down the huge bed and climbed in, passing down some pillows and a spare blanket that Sherlock then used to create a makeshift bed on the floor.
Sherlock frowned at him. “If I wasn’t, why would I have asked for this in the first place? That would be quite ridiculous.”
“Now let's see, it’s been a while, but…” John trailed off, changing position slightly to readjust his angle. His very next deep thrust hit Sherlock directly in the prostate, and the man beneath him screamed out a series of colourful curses, hands twisting in the sheets.
John allowed himself to indulge in imagining that rather than his own hand, it was Sherlock’s mouth he was rutting into desperately, those full lips wrapped around him as he fucked into his warm mouth, the younger man taking him deeper and deeper as he licked and sucked.
“Sherlock and I would like to thank you both very much for your part in getting us together. I don’t know if we would have ever made that leap without the push” John smiled, entwining his hand with Sherlock’s on the table.
John didn’t want to confess that Mycroft had told him as much, so he listened in silence as Sherlock attempted to explain his history.
When the need for oxygen finally forced their lips apart, John rolled them over and sighed as he lay his head on Sherlock's broad chest. The sound of the younger man's steady heart beating beneath him was a soothing lullaby that was in serious danger of putting him to sleep. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's back, holding him as close as he could manage.
Sherlock pulled John into his lap, and both of them moaned when their matching erections made contact through their trousers.
John didn’t seem to mind though and his hands tangled into Sherlock’s dark curls, setting a counter rhythm to the frantic buzz against his testicles and perineum which only brought more pleasure. He was losing himself in the bliss, moaning and letting his head fall backwards until Sherlock pulled away, wiping his mouth with his good hand and then looking up at John with arousal blown pupils.
“You’re annoying!” John grumbled under his breath, as he tried to sit up without wincing from the headache currently battering his skull.
“John…. John pull off… I can’t… Oh John I can’t hold it!” Sherlock rambled, grabbing for John’s hair to pull him away but John refused and continued his ministrations until Sherlock stiffened, spine tense as he shuddered and came with a loud and filthy moan.
Sherlock’s large hands came to rest in John’s short hair, adding even more paint to it. He tugged at it gently as they tried their best to consume one another, making him groan and the bulge in his pants grow bigger.
This meant nothing to Mycroft, he reminded himself. It was merely an arrangement that benefited them both, a means to an end.
All his focus was now diverted to thinking unappealing thoughts, in a desperate effort to prevent his arousal from becoming obvious between his legs.
An hour later, John had decided he couldn’t take another moment of stuffy heat, loud music and small talk.  He and Sherlock hastily completed their round of polite farewells to the room of posh strangers, and then they were in a cab and on the road.
"That's why you did all this, isn't it? To make a point, to find yet another way to prove that you are better than me."
“I was hot, and it was here. You should join me, John. The water is nice, and you look like you could use a chance to cool down” he said casually, watching him.
Sherlock had already informed him that he wished for them to go on a long trek the next morning in search of the ever-elusive mushrooms.
“Get up right this second, you lazy arse bastard.” John smirked as he jumped down and began to kiss and tickle Sherlock, tormenting him until Sherlock whined low and pushed John away,
They only finally changed and made the long trek back to camp when the sun started to set and an unpleasant chill began blowing over the water. By the time they returned to camp, both men were exhausted, and an agreement was made to skip dinner and go straight to sleep. This time around, John was far too tired to be distracted by Sherlock’s closeness. As soon as they were tucked into their sleeping bags John switched off their lantern, and within moments Sherlock was snoring and he was not far behind, drifting into the welcoming embrace of sleep and dreaming of a particular detective floating on a crystal blue lake.
“Here. You missed a spot” Sherlock said slowly, pointing at a splotch of purple on his earlobe that John knew had to have been a guess. There was no way he could have known it was there without the help of a mirror.
With a shaky hand, John reached out to reverently brush a wet curl out of Sherlock’s eyes. He closed his eyes for a moment at John’s touch, smiling.
“Shit!” Sherlock gasped, grabbing John’s arms with white knuckles, but within moments of John slowly working his finger in and out the gasp turned to moans.
“I don’t know, there has to be somewhere we can take shelter. We are sitting ducks if we stay here!” Sherlock shouted, trying to make himself heard over the roar of the rain.
A horrified waitress scurried over, almost fainting when she set eyes on the source of the commotion.
“Would you like some help, perhaps? Before the flat ends up looking like the scene of Barney the Dinosaur’s murder?”
Mercilessly Sherlock had apparently decided his work was done, and he removed the hand that was burning a hole in John's thigh. The spot still tingled long after.
John tried not to let himself dwell for too long on the realization that Sherlock had pawed through his things, or the fact that he would have had to dig past his underwear in order to find them. He knew that he had two choices. EIther make up some lame excuse and run for the hills or get out of his own head and join him in the water.
He had forgotten how heavy the baby had gotten, and gained a newfound respect for John after holding her for three hours.
"And I you, John.  If you promise to actually tell this clueless idiot when you want help, I promise to do better in the future."
The few days which followed the awkward-wanking-incident as John was starting to mentally call it, were fairly quiet. John went to work and returned home to Sherlock where they ate their meals in companionable quiet, sharing rooms but barely having any conversation that wasn’t small talk. Sherlock seemed to be watching John more intently, and John ensured that he peppered in small details about his upcoming date.
John positioned himself over Sherlock’s body, gently nudging his legs apart a little further to line the head of his hard prick up with his entrance.
"Hello, I will have the mushroom past-aaaah!" John yelled out, his eyes round as saucers and face beet red with embarrassment. The server looked at him like he belonged in a mental institution, and multiple diners went silent and turned to stare in their direction.
He could scarcely believe that something that had remained nothing more than a product of his greatest fantasies for so long was actually happening. The desire to pinch himself and make sure that he wasn’t dreaming was
“No -- Yes -- No” Sherlock muttered, before clearing his throat. “I have -- There has never --” he paused to rub at his curls until they were a frizzy mess, “I have never been a sexual person. It has never interested me…”
Suddenly John was overwhelmed with a feeling of loneliness. He saw the love between Greg and Mycroft as they smiled at one another, eyes only for each other as they danced and then pressed their foreheads together as the song began to wind down.
“Of course. I’m sorry, I didn’t even think” Sherlock mumbled as he disentangled his long body from John’s, unable to hide the flash of disappointment that passed over his features.
“I forbid it.” Sherlock said, eyes as small and dangerous as his cheeks were flushed. He looked every inch the dangerous madman that John had been warned about.
Seemingly unwilling to continue a conversation, John watched Sherlock for another long moment.  He dumped his half empty coffee cup into the sink, before downing some ibuprofen for his head and trudging off towards the bathroom.
“We are so glad you were able to join us, gentlemen” Greg welcomed them with a smile when Mycroft failed to speak.
John couldn’t believe that Sherlock was talking like this. John didn’t even know Sherlock was aware of cottaging or wanking. He expected that once he entered his bedroom, Sherlock shut down like a robot and only re-engaged when he had to annoy John a bit more.
Where Mycroft’s caresses had felt comforting and safe, kissing Sherlock Holmes was like an instant contact high. His lips were a drug, drawing him into an addiction he never wanted to break.
They spent a few more minutes simply kissing and caressing one another, letting the tension simmer rather than boil over before John pulled back, stroking Sherlock’s hair back lovingly
“Did we really spend that much? I mean… I know he sent them to us as a joke but I’m not returning the sex toys.” John insisted.
“Well, that was fun” Sherlock finally said as he sat back, attempting to wring the water out of his soaking wet shirt.
Suddenly they became aware of the sound of very familiar footsteps coming towards the room, and John
Relieved, John unceremoniously dropped the bundle of bags and camping equipment he had been carrying to the ground, wincing as he shook out his cramping arms. He might have carried his fair share of heavy loads in his time, but he wasn’t as fit-or young- as he had once been.
"I therefore propose that we get thoroughly plastered, so as to exact revenge on my brother for this situation he has put us in. Money may be no object to him, but it's
When their meals arrived, and Sherlock was sure the doctor was distracted by his food, he turned the underwear back on, this time sliding the dial as high as it would go in one hit.
John raised a shaky hand to cover Sherlock's where it still rested on his flushed cheek, and began to return the caress of his lips.
“Mycroft Holmes, the past two years have been the happiest of my life. You have made me a better man, taught me what it feels like to be truly loved. I want to be by your side for the rest of my life. Would you do me the incredible honour of marrying me?”
Sherlock raised a brow, and John tried to close his own gaping mouth. They continued toward an adjoining room, Sherlock flicking on the light switch as they entered.
John was unable to answer for a moment. Sleeping together was one thing, but admitting to feeling that four-letter word was a whole different thing.
Hi guys, its Chrissy here! On behalf of Kittie and I, I would like to say a big thank you for all the support and comments we have received from day one, when this fic was nothing more than an exciting idea in our heads.
“Oh, what a shame.” Sherlock drawled, inhaling on the cigarette and meeting John’s gaze with a smirk, “Perhaps you overspent? Too many French pastries, mon frère?”
Determined to rescue the evening, when the food arrived John started small talk between the four of them about the latest case he and Sherlock  had solved while they all ate. The earlier hostility that had hung thick in the air was now gone, and the doctor could tell he wasn’t the only one relieved by the change in atmosphere.
