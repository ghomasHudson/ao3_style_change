He couldn’t imagine what that man was feeling right now.

“God yes, please yes,” Tony begged, parting his legs, arching his back. “

“I’m just sorry.” He sighed, and he threw himself into Steve, knocking him off of his feet and sending them both stumbling somewhat gracelessly into the couch behind him. He felt Steve huff out a shocked little breath, as Tony repositioned himself so that he was sitting in Steve’s lap, his legs straddling his waist –
“But nothing else?”
And then his face twisted into something else completely. A sheer
But he just was
So, there was

to like him as much as that. It was one thing to think that Steve wanted him, that he really wasn’t disgusted by him, that Steve might even have developed a crush on him… and, to be honest, all of that was overwhelming enough.
To be perfectly honest - now, he just wanted to get this over with.
And he
He could wish Steve and Bucky luck, and let them walk away with no plans to return
Because, with that one, Steve
This was about what he

, to think that Tony got this. That he’d felt it too.
“Okay, so, you know when a man has a heart attack, he sometimes gets a pain in his left arm?” Tony began, waiting for Bucky to nod before he carried on, “Well, the reason that happens isn’t that there’s anything wrong with the guy’s arm, obviously. Actually, it’s because the pain receptors in your heart and the pain receptors in your arm send signals to the same part of the brain  – so, when they get there, your brain has no idea which part sent it, and therefore which part to make ‘hurt’. It’s called referred pain… But the point is, there isn’t anything ‘wrong’ with your brain then, either. It’s just that it’s the brain that is making it happen…”
But it took one glance for Tony to be completely sure… He knew exactly how Steve was feeling. He’d been there. That uneasiness in his own skin, the shapeless, irrational shame that he couldn’t find to talk himself out of. And that strange paranoia, knowing other people had memories of him that he didn’t have for himself – the unnatural feeling, having to ask someone else what
Now, as that soft, warm breeze rolled over his skin, Steve found himself thinking of the rest of the sentence.

And, he reminded himself, he would

He heard Steve’s breath hitch again. He felt the kick in Steve’s chest, the immediate reaction to that sentiment, specifically. Tony knew how hard
None of those anxieties had gone away. If anything, this place should have made every one of those issues worse – not to mention all the additional fears that should’ve kept him awake. It made literally no sense for him to have slept as well or as deeply as he had.

That was-

“Well, not right now, no, because you’re more scared of

“I know” Vanessa answered quickly, and then caught herself “I mean, I know I’m not supposed to know – first names only and all that, but, you know I know, right? I mean, I didn’t know you two were…” And she gestured between them.
In an instant, there was no resistance in Tony’s body. It was like every muscle, every

“Personal?” Bucky repeated, clearly unconvinced.
Tony giggled then – mainly at the genuine, conversational way Steve had said it. The fact that it wasn’t how he was expecting him to finish the sentence.

And, God, Tony
“Well, we might have another chance to investigate” Tony blurted, because it was
“…So, a lot of these rooms are rather…
He knew they wouldn’t give him any longer than that.
And he just couldn’t tell him.
He felt it swelling up in his head, and his chest; a physical pressure that made it hard to breathe.
regret was roping the others into this. Poor Rhodey, who obviously wished he’d never had the idea, and clearly had no personal investment in it whatsoever, had nonetheless allowed Steve to run with it, rather than make the situation even more awkward. Steve was embarrassed about that now.
God, Tony wasn’t sure he’d
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, averting his eyes. He heard Steve take a small, trembling breath, and his stomach clenched. A little voice whispered,
And then pursed his lips, an unspoken question creasing his forehead,
Was that right…? No, really, he needed to know.
No shady interments of innocent people without trial, I assume?”
And then, as he’d grown closer to Steve, that conflict had changed. Now, Tony wanted to know more about him because he was interested. The temptation to explore these new and wonderful ideas was so much stronger, now that there
Everyone looked up in unison, as Shuri stumbled outside, obviously
Tony groaned, low in his chest, as Steve pushed a second finger into him - which then broke into a pleading whine, as Steve twisted his hand and pushed in deeper.
Something he thought he’d never get the chance to do - because, even if he had eventually followed that urge to learn more about himself, Steve never in a million years dreamed that SHIELD would give him the actual files…
Then he fell quiet for a few moments, while he removed one of the panels from Bucky’s shoulder, and began untangling the chaos of wires beneath. There was the tricky task of replacing some of them, and then the even more delicate task of wiring the tiny little circuit board into the system. But even while Tony was so focused on what he was doing, he was still aware of Steve standing behind him… being sad…
“Best birthday ever,” Steve slurred, falling under even as he said it.
it was a bad idea to find Steve. He didn’t really have a conscious reason to think it would be - his mind was too frazzled by now to come up with any.
That made it so much easier to keep looking. Suddenly it seemed
“Who were these guys?” Tony smiled. “I mean, if they have you weighing up escape strategies…”
But, oh, the ideas that suddenly flooded his head
Although, she didn’t sound too sure of that.
Steve felt a smile warm through his chest – because he knew how important all of that was
“And why are you here?” Tony asked, sounding more dazed than defensive. “What, because you knew my dad, or… Wait, SHIELD found you? When?”
Steve wasn’t ready
Okay, but the idea of Tony ever finding out those
…Then he remembered that he was

… Even though there was something inherently sad about how very pretty Tony was.
...something that went right out of his head, the moment he saw the expression on Tony’s face. A wide-eyed amazement, and the hint of an astonished smile, and, already, the flicker of thoughts building up behind it all…
Tony saying,
“Well, wait, hang on” Tony smiled – and Steve paused. “The thing is Steve, I actually
Steve began kissing his way back down along Tony’s chest, quicker and messier and more urgently than before. He heard Tony whine softly when he had to move his hand, so that he could tug Tony’s clothes down over his legs, undressing him as he was still kissing his stomach. And then Steve lifted his head…
But his attention just kept getting dragged back over to Rogers image.
“Yeah, Steve just said that,” Rhodey reminded her.
to say.
“It’s Loki.”
And then he felt the dull press of Tony’s thumb rolling over his rim - an abundance of friction and sensation after that soft teasing touch-
“Uh, these are a new species of Teo Torriatte,” she smiled. “I don’t know how much we know about Torriatte flowers?”
Eventually he felt Steve collapse away from him.
“From who?” She asked, glancing around the room as though to illustrate her point. Tony felt his cheeks warming.
“Yeah, Sam, lots of times - when I first woke up in the 21st Century, and a nurse told me I was in a recovery room in New York, it never

Tony thought, happily.

“So why didn’t you?” Tony asked, before he could think to stop himself.
And Tony knew he should panic about the fact that Steve was coming back tonight… But he just…
He still flooded by the adrenaline that had kicked in at the thought of anything happening to

a physical desperation to this – but it didn’t reduce Tony down to his physical urges.
And Bucky remembers that too.
“And today is the Avengers report.”
Bucky narrows his eyes at him.
The petulant little spikes of need every time Tony pulled away, growing louder and more demanding with every passing second.
By the time they reached the bedroom, Tony already felt different.
Eventually, he glanced up at Sam and pictured saying it out loud.
“Yes,” Steve assured him, easily. “I just don’t want to do something thoughtless or dangerous. I never thought this was going to happen. I haven’t thought about any of this. Basically, the
awful, the
“How are you feeling?” Tony asked, his palm still stroking affectionately over Steve’s skin.
And then he blinked, and shook his head.
He looked over at Bucky, who had clearly seen it too.
Of course, the CEO and the politico were more than happy to bid Steve a good night. Tony waited until they had both scurried out of view before he cocked an inquisitive eyebrow.
“So… who’s running your company?”
The sketch of what might’ve been a man’s ring, although it was really too degraded to tell…
And then he saw Tony soften just slightly, his head dropping gently as he smiled his acceptance. The tiniest gesture, the faintest little sound, but Steve felt it cut right to the core of him. His body tensed upwards involuntarily, his heart kicking hard against his ribs, his cock throbbing painfully against his stomach.

” Tony hissed, jerking against him, sending another sharp stab of pleasure along Steve’s spine.
It rushed up along his back, pulling a friction up from low in his hips, his neck and shoulders throbbing in time with his racing heart. He could feel the blood rushing through his veins, hot and electric, teasing to the tip of every limb, touching every part of him.
“Do you know if they’re doing all of this from here?” Tony asked, already listing the details he needed to do this equation.

He tried to take a steadying breath… But it was like he could actually smell the damp concrete of that bunker, like he could feel that slightly acidic frost clawing at the back of his throat-
something… Which was probably the only reason he didn’t think to make an off colour joke about how long Steve could hold his breath.
But Steve had always been the one to run.
He hadn’t meant to. Some part of him managed to feel bad for it, even now. It was one thing to go to Bucky, as a friend, to satisfy a physical need that they both understood. But fucking Bucky while he thought of someone else –
And Steve let his eyes run over Tony’s body… the marks he’d left on Tony’s neck, the fingertip bruises on Tony’s chest – which Steve could only see because he’d torn so many of the buttons from the front of Tony’s shirt…
And then a nakedly
Tony dropped Steve’s wrist, and took a step back, and tried to kick start his brain again.
But no, there was
that cloud of animal lust growing denser, the connection between his head and his body becoming shorter and more impulsive.

“We don’t know anything, about anything, at all,” Pepper replied bluntly, which set Nat off on another fit of the giggles.

All at the same time.

It was just… looking at how few options that he had to weigh up. Realising that ninety per cent of his clothing qualified as loungewear – and why wouldn’t it? Why would he bother replacing the t-shirts that got stained or scorched? Who would know?
Tony heard a door slam three floors above him, the moment he walked into the hallway. And then the flutter of heels at the top of the landing-
Tony found himself just following his feet. It wasn’t that he’d decided this was a good idea so much as he’d forgotten the question. The only conscious consideration left in his head was whether he’d reach the lobby before Steve left it, and how he’d go about finding him in that case…
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck. He’d actually said

But tonight, just for once, Steve had actually let his guard down.

And Steve nodded, even though he didn’t have a clue what Tony had just said. Just because he was
“Hang on a minute Steve,” Nat panted, still grinning. And only then did Steve bother to think about why everyone was laughing… and what he’d just done…
He thought of that afternoon – Tony

To suggest every idea that he thought Steve might like, without worrying what it would mean in the long run.
“Hey, how’re you feeling?” Tony asked, brightly – looking at Bucky.
And, Jesus Christ, he could hardly bring himself to ask the question, it was going to hurt so much to hope that hard…
“Thank you,” Steve whispered, a hint of a blush darkening across his cheekbones.
“It’s fine, really.” He grinned, “Are you okay?”

sort of such a thing as a truth serum on earth, kinda. I mean, it’s not exactly, but- well, basically it is. And… okay, so…” He traced his fingers over the lines on the screen, trying to think how to word this idea – to himself, before he tried to explain it to Steve. “So, looking at the research files, from the third-floor party – they’re all just plain ol’ human research files, so they’re easy to read… And it looks as though this is how they record it, when they’re adapting a Varian drug, see?”
He glanced at his watch, an intricate designer timepiece that he had to squint to read… 11:40, or thereabouts. He let go of a slow breath and reassured himself,
“Seven,” Steve sighed.
She slipped into a spiteful mocking tone – clearly getting carried away with her own monologue again.
And only then did Tony recognise that he’d walked right up to the front door.
“Right,” Bucky interrupted, pointedly – and Steve just exhaled, impatiently.
Tony felt his ribs loosen as he looked at them. As strange and extraordinary as all of that was, it was so much better to have it laid out in front of him like this.
And now they spent their days being civil with one another… Which probably meant they
And Steve did know that, when he left this room and came face to face with Tony, that scene would happen. There would be no fast-forwarding it, or erasing it after the fact. And Steve didn’t know what the fuck he was going to say, and he knew it was going to be awful.
“What was that for?” Tony smiled, breathlessly, his fingertips pressing into Steve’s arms.

want from Tony. As far as Steve knew, he’d always been a team mate to Tony. Not a friend like Rhodey was a friend, or Happy, or Pepper. He hoped he’d eventually become someone Tony liked well enough. Someone he’d be nice to – mostly, because he was nice. Someone he would die to protect… because Tony Stark would die to protect a total stranger. Someone who, unbeknownst to Tony, watched longingly from the back of the room while he worked, sometimes…

Maybe Pepper had a point.
Steve and Rhodey shared a wry smile, before they nodded their thanks and shuffled away.
No one could ask him why he hadn’t said the obvious thing.

Bucky shrugged, and pulled his phone out of his pocket, and swiped his finger across the screen. The music cut out to an instant silence, and Steve sighed again – this time out of relief.
Of course it was shallow and disrespectful to be meandering around the palace with a vague sense of interest. It was self-centred to have forgotten all about it, even for a moment…

Or even the guard who’d shot him.
Someone who really knew him for who he was, who loved him for what he was.
And he pulled Steve close, and… he felt Steve melt into his neck…

“I love you,” he smiled, just because he liked saying it so much. And because he loved the way Tony smiled when he did.
Often, Bucky didn’t know which mood he was in until the choice presented itself-
And his,
“Do you have anywhere to go?” Tony asked, with a softer edge on his voice.

… I love you for the fact that you
Steve just laughed, and melted back into Tony’s lap, and the general warmth of his happiness, and the comfort of impending sleep.
He looked to Bucky again, and saw a similar confused dread rise up in his eyes-
‘I am hurt’… and he might not have realised that, at the time.
“So, yeah, that, plus everything else, tells me that it can only really work one way,” Tony said - again. “They

But he

“What’s wrong?” He asked - with none of the defensiveness or subtle accusation that Tony was used to hearing. With such genuine, gentle care for him… It was enough to make Tony smile, in spite of what he had to say.

There was a serious impulse to snatch it back, to snap that if Steve was going to be so ridiculous about it, he couldn’t have it-

It built to a peak, a state of absolute and perfect bliss-
“Yeah,” Tony whispered.
“This is nice,” Tony murmured into Steve’s shoulder.
He took a moment to look out over the landscape, searching for any sign of where her body had fallen… It seemed especially sad to him that her final resting place warranted no sign of it’s importance. But in the end he had no choice but to whisper his goodbye to Natasha into the air, and to suffer that bitter sadness at losing her, just for a moment, as a way to mark her passing.
And it turned out that Steve
Steve swallowed hard, and braced himself, and reminded himself to
“Where are Pepper, Nat and Bruce?” Tony asked, suddenly.
“Yup - and let’s pay special attention to anything they’ve labelled
And then he saw Steve part his lips, like he was about to say something – and
“A change in plans for this evening, sir?” JARVIS enquired, causally. Tony let go of another startled little laugh.
But Steve just
But Tony just smiled again, and
“Depends,” Tony mused - not even realising that he was no longer awkward or anxious about this topic, at least for as long as Steve was actually there. Not recognising just how much mental pressure had simply evaporated the second he heard Steve’s voice. “I mean, if I ate
now that it was simply an uncontrollable, feral desire to protect Steve – just that.
we find Bucky?” Tony questioned, more gently.
If he just accepted the support that was already there for him, he was sure he could do damn near anything.
Tony’s low groaning was cut into a jagged, stuttered cry, breaking every time Steve pushed into him, moving higher in his chest as that pressure built again-
So, powered by a blinding stab of pure adrenaline, Tony scrambled after the instinct to get the hell out of this situation before something much worse happened.
Oh, God, it couldn’t go on. He was just going to snap under the weight of this, his heart was going to give out, he was going to suffocate, he-
any of that, or what it would look like, but he knew he couldn’t even begin to think about it until he’d answered-

been inside for twenty years?” Sam blurted, to no one in particular. But Tony didn’t waste time asking himself whether it was a real question or not – his head was already a minute ahead of his body, and still stuck in that dismissive, auto-respond mode.
“So, I know that this fight had a huge cost…” Scott began nervously, glancing between Steve and Wanda before he carried on, “but I really think that Tony and Vision - and Nat - would be so proud that we won it.”
want to shape the entire world to suit your needs”
He grabbed one of the pillows and threw it over his face. He thought back to the comedy farce movies that the troops watched in the forties, the hopeless hero making an ever-bigger mess as he tried to deal with a catastrophe of his own making… Steve had never liked those movies. They irritated him. And now he found himself trapped in a farce of his own making, increasingly desperate to repair the escalating damage he was causing, apparently unable to

Triggering a physical need unlike anything he’d ever felt before.
Tony just looked at Rhodey a moment longer, trying to ignore that vulnerable little feeling in his chest.
“So, do you have any ideas about whose fantasy you’d like to-”
He wasn’t entirely sure if he’d even

Within a second and a half, Steve and Bucky were in a room with three unconscious bodies.
And that sense of clarity carried on growing and expanding, far beyond its own parameters. The realisation of who he really was, and how he would naturally respond, and how he really saw things, suddenly helped him to see things beyond himself.
Which was on top of the fizzing, electric sensitivity, running all the way to the tips of his fingers now-
It was almost nostalgic.
Bucky already knew that it was likely to start them bickering, that there wasn’t really anything to be
He needed this more. More than anything-

“No, it doesn’t,” Bucky corrected him. “This thing where you think about him all the time, and get nervous about seeing him, or whatever, is not ‘anxious’ – that’s just being a normal person, for once. It’s nothing like the constant, global-scale over-thinking you do the rest of the time – that

Tony thought, petulantly. Even putting himself in Steve’s position like that hadn’t led him to empathise with
And then he heard a familiar voice… Thor.
If he’d done one thing, taken one single step in the right direction before he went-
It had never occurred to him, before The Facility. Perhaps it was simply that, on Earth, it was a far more awkward and complicated prospect. Steve was too well known on Earth, his identity carried too much baggage – there were too many reasons never to make himself vulnerable like that, in a public place. The idea of doing anything like that
He was in bed with Tony.

his Captain America stories” Tony commented, joylessly.
But still, Tony had tried to smile as he checked them both in. He’d tried to act like one half of a happy couple at the start of a vacation, while he scanned the lobby for anything that might ambush them or brainwash them or eat them… He’d tried to ignore Steve, and the attitude radiating off of him. And then a smiling blonde woman had appeared beside them, and introduced herself as their representative, and offered to give them the grand tour of the building – and Tony had thought,
happy. They have already attained a peace and a contentment – the satisfaction I wrongly believed that material gain could bring me, because of what I had been taught… I found myself, honestly and completely at peace, for the first time in my life. All because of the effect of this world and the perspective it offered. And, as a result of this new perspective, I realised… I wanted to share this thing. Not for profit, not for gain of any kind… I wanted everyone to feel what I felt. I changed. I stopped researching what would make me rich, and I started looking into what would make the world better… If Earth had the same eco system as Anni Vara, Earth would be better. You know that.”
. Sometimes you could be so different. There was this whole other side to you I couldn’t work out… And I’ve just realised, it’s not a whole other side to you at all.” And he paused, and looked right at Steve, those beautiful dark eyes so wide and full of feeling “It’s just
That caught his attention in a more immediate way.
And still, Steve had been sure he was at the beginning of something.
And Steve was surprised at how difficult a question that was. At how much resistance he felt.
Tony leapt to his feet and bounded for the door, his anxieties temporarily forgotten in the sheer relief of having Steve home.
And now he heard Tony talking to him like a co-worker, and he thought maybe it wasn’t a start at all… maybe it was an ending. Maybe there had been more hope back when Tony was giving him the silent treatment and cold responses – back when Tony was showing him that he was hurt. And Tony had shown him, and shown him, and to make it all worse, Steve
his skin was… and then curled his fingers around the length of Steve’s cock, and felt him, thick and full against his palm.
After three days crammed into safehouses with too many SHIELD agents, Steve was at last alone in his own room-
the answers were yes. Tony just wanted Steve. Anything. Everything. This was the first time he’d even allowed himself to want, in twenty years, and it was like a dam had burst. Suddenly, Tony wanted so much it was dizzying. He felt every moment of loneliness, every frustrated desire, every buried trauma for the last two decades – how
being in love with Steve, and all he’d wanted was any reason to keep doing that… Tony realised how he’d pushed that line back so many times, negotiated himself down and down on what he could accept as an acknowledgement or a reason… How he’d
“Tony…” He begged, his voice high and whiney as he teetered on the edge again, some of the tension returning to his wrecked muscles as he tried to push against it. And then he felt the slightest stutter in that brutal rhythm, Tony’s fingers flexing around Steve’s cock as his thrusts became sharper and shallower…
And then a thought occurred to him - something he would have been too guarded to say before now...
Except that Steve carried on talking.
he liked Steve so much. He wasn’t sure what he was hoping would happen, the next time they met. He couldn’t think of one actual reason it was a good idea to see him again. But, apparently, the answers to those questions didn’t really matter. Tony wanted to see him again anyway.
And he still wasn’t sure if it had really hit him yet.
Try again.
“Hi,” Tony sang brightly, as he appeared next to Steve, as though by magic.
That maybe he was about to come face to face with whatever wordless quality it was that always made his blood run cold...
. So I guess it wasn’t so incredible when I called the weapons company a mistake, seeing as no one even
“It’s okay.” Tony soothed. And then he grinned, thinking how important it was that he could finally say these words,
And then there was nothing but the almost-painful intensity of Tony hitting that sweet spot again, and again, the sensation cutting deeper into the core of him now that his body had turned to water around him. He felt Tony’s hands grip his hips tighter, pulling Steve into to meet his thrusts, harder and rougher, until at last something
Tony giggled, flexing his hands. “Not yet, anyway. And I tested this earlier – it was

it was 3:42am, because he’d checked his phone once every thirty seconds since Tony left.
But he couldn’t quite work out what that post-it made his blood run cold… He found himself trying to remember how long this FOCUS stuff was meant to last – and, when he couldn’t, he concluded that it was probably wearing off. And there was still just about enough of it left for him to consider

Until Steve actually walked in. Then all bets were off.
“I don’t even mean drunk, I just mean…” Tony blushed, trying to think how he could rescue this “I don’t know. We never got to talk all that much, I guess is all I mean.”
“It’s okay sweetheart, take a minute,” Tony grinned. “…We’ve got time.”

He could feel Steve’s heart beating against his own ribs-
Ha. Well, that figured.
And Steve had absolutely no idea what was going on.

Or if that had been the problem all along…

On which note - yes, there is smut. One and a half whole scenes of smut - and for anyone a little disappointed that the second scene fades to black, this is only because a) story flow means some of the details end up in the next chapter and b) they get to explore these ideas in a similar and more graphic scene later on. 😏
His entire body had entered a sort of sensory tunnel vision. Now, he could hear every echo and footfall and electric whirr in that building – and nothing else. He froze, like a tiger watching its prey, cataloguing every minuscule detail before he pounced.
A life like that was worth a lot of sacrifices.

What if Steve had come to different conclusions on it now?
… Or if, maybe, part of it was him trying to give Steve a hint.
Steve had wanted to tell himself that it wasn’t his fault, but he’d felt too guilty for even trying-

He tried to whisper Tony’s name, managing a weak little mewing sound. Tony smiled.
“Oh, absolutely,” Tony nodded enthusiastically. “If you’d like to google any cliché, rich-brat teen drama from the eighties, you’ll have a pretty accurate representation.”
It still upset him to think of Steve being hurt or lonely, and he did feel that little swell of pleasure when he imagined making Steve happy…
And an urgent demand from his own body,

“...I’m not entirely sure,” Steve admitted with a smile. “But I am glad I went. So.”
“Clint will be waiting for you.”
“Which is why falling in love with him in the first place was such a bad move,” Tony went on. “I mean, if I’d just
The theme was…
that there was something significant about it, that there was something that should’ve occurred to him. He knew there was something…different, about the strength of Tony’s grip or how quickly he could move. Steve knew he should think more of it than the things that had immediately occurred to him-

that it was right.
...How would he talk to Steve in general, after this.
He set his shoulders instinctively, mentally preparing himself for further interrogation-
“Jesus Tony,” Steve whispered, breathless and shaky and emotional. Tony lifted his head, one hand stroking up to cup Steve’s face, guiding Steve to look at him.
It was like that first night in the army, when he’d been so full of desperation to succeed that he could barely sit still.
“Uh, that way, maybe?” Bucky pointed vaguely to his left.

“Honestly, it is
That was just great.
“Oh, it’s like… he’s already decided he wants to be played by Tyrone Powers, or something.”
That it was okay if collars and cuffs excited him and the thought of ball gags made him uncomfortable - that he didn’t have to explain it to anyone, not even to himself.
“JARVIS, what time is it?” He groaned.
He didn’t even know which previous enlightenment he’d let himself down over. He didn’t know whether he should be angry at himself for still trying to plan things, or angry that he’d lost sight of all his promises for the future so quickly…
“Whoever is behind this,” Steve shrugged. “Maybe they’re just doing this to wind us up, make us fight.”
It was all still there, just as sharp and just as awful… but not moving so quickly, somehow. His heart was still racing and there were still tears sliding down his face, and there was still that bitter, metallic taste of fear… but the frantic thoughts had quieted, just for a moment.
“This seems pretty serious. Phil seems pretty shaken,” Pepper answered.
sorry for the things I did. I am sorry that I was so unhelpful when we were discussing the Sokovia Accords, and I am sorry for the ridiculous, reckless way that I helped Bucky, and I am sorry I fell into a trap, as it turns out… But I can’t say I’m sorry I didn’t sign the Accords and I can’t say I’m sorry I helped Bucky and I can’t say I wouldn’t try to stop a threat like that. And…Maybe that’s another reason the letter was so bad… And, I don’t know, maybe all of that means we can’t get past this and you can’t forgive me, but-”
I pin you down and make you tell me what the hell is up with you, it’s not because I feel left out. And it’s not because I feel taken for granted, and it’s really not because I think you owe me an explanation. It’s just because I’m not going to stand here and watch you drown.”
Tony couldn’t help but smile at that. How well Rhodey knew him…

came out in one rush of air, swallowed by a strangled cry as Tony thrust into him hard.
Too late, Steve looked up in an attempt to get his bearings. He found that he and Tony were moving slowly through what looked like the players tunnel on the way into a stadium - except with far more people… just a sea of strangers, fenced in on either side by featureless concrete walls-

And then Tony took his hand away.
And then he caressed his fingertips into Steve’s muscle, before slowly stroking his palm up, over his shoulder, as he leant into him again. He brought his hand to the side of Steve’s face as he kissed him – deeper, slower kisses now, his other arm wrapping tight around Steve’s waist in a way that was more giving than grasping.

Tony didn’t actually know what catastrophic outcome he was scared of, much less whether it was reasonable.
He stopped to sigh, glancing up at Tony... and finding a look of aghast sympathy in his eyes.

“Because… I thought maybe you’d be good for him,” Pepper shrugged. And Tony felt an immediate spike of confusion, a subversion of his most basic expectations.
Steve smiled, and set aside the page of notes he’d been looking at - knowing full well that this question might have nothing to do with what they were just talking about.
“Uh huh. It’s got nothing to do with you being painfully horny, right now?”

kind of infuriating that you’re going this hard to sabotage yourself, which is the only reason I’m not trying to shut him up… Well, that and I’ve had a lot of water…”
Tony looked up at Steve, more concerned than confused. It was the tone Steve had used… the specific sadness of it… And the way his eyes momentarily drifted to somewhere in the middle distance…
“Come here,” Tony smiled, curling an arm around Steve’s waist and all but lifting him, so that he could lie Steve out on his back. A delighted giggle bubbled over Steve’s lips, as his weight sank into the softness of the blankets. He spread his arms out, letting his head fall back, enjoying the simple novelty of being sprawled out on the floor like this. He could hear Tony standing, and moving over to the cabinet, a distant background noise to the happy mindlessness he’d fallen into. He let his eyes slip shut, and focused on the pleasant pulsing in the small of his back…
“…I don’t really know how I feel about everything that just happened,” Tony admitted. “And I also don’t really know what I

It wasn’t about any of the disagreements they’d ever had, or any of the things they’d done to each other.
, corporal reaction tensing every muscle in anger.
At this very moment, a warm smile and a professional nod was about as much as Tony could’ve managed for anyone… but he hoped he’d seen a little flicker of recognition in her eyes, before she smiled back. She could always read him as well as anyone.
Or stay, and be there with him when he watched it, if he wanted to...
“What?” They asked, together. Tony pointed to the left side of the ‘parking lot’, where, concealed in what little shadow there was beside the tower, there was an untidy row of industrial dumpsters.
And as much as Steve was immediately resistant to the idea of Tony going away, for however long… he was

“-Through the security system, under the lasers,” Tony carried on anyway, clinging onto his composure for just long enough to finish “oh, damn, he fell into the ball pit.”
A fierce, searing pleasure rushed up through him, a wave of relief surging up from the small of his back, thousands of white-hot sparks shattering through his hips. Steve lost himself for a second, the world disappearing into the blinding intensity of this sensation-
“I’m good, I’m sorry” She answered quickly, slurring slightly. “Sorry, I swear we’ve not started this early in the morning – this is still last night.” She explained, holding out her hand for her partner. Slowly, and without an obvious comprehension, he took it, and let her pull herself up.
And Steve didn’t want to answer that question – so he checked his phone again.
– and Steve felt every bit as guilty, acknowledging this – maybe Tony being here to irritate him with holograms was another reason that Steve liked these missions. Because these missions were the only ones that Tony seemed to bother with. Because it took an official summons and the potential end of the world to drag Tony out of his own life and into a setting where Steve might possibly bump into him…

Well, maybe it wasn’t that things looked different, exactly - but it

The burn of metal melding with flesh-
he was going to see Tony Stark again. Why Bucky couldn’t just go on his own. Even if she didn’t ask him, she’d want to know… And Steve felt uncomfortable with that question being out there at all.
It was the pleading tone he’d slipped into right at the end. The way Steve’s eyes widened as that little edge of desperation finally cut through.
“Yeah, I’m ready.” Steve answered, having to force the words over a sudden clenching in his heart. He tried to feel reassured by the pleasant, natural tone that Tony was using now. He tried reminding himself that it was exactly what he’d been working to earn back, for the last six months. He tried telling himself,

Those were just lines in his head, phrases he ran through like a bored child reciting the Lords Prayer for the ten thousandth time – not even bothering to think about what it meant.
“That doesn’t mean it is,” Rhodey assured, warmly. “And I know it’s hard to think about what Obie said, and I get that it’s going to be really hard to ask yourself if it’s true – but I absolutely know that you’re going to get to the end of it and realise it wasn’t.

“So, you’re not done with them yet?” Rhodey interrupted him.
“Oh Steve…” he breathed, running a finger over the barely-visible bullet wound he’d helped to bind just a week ago… He knew how quickly Steve healed. How badly he must’ve been hurt, for there to be any evidence of it now.
All of which suggested that they were actually on a completely different path to the one his day-time head was desperately trying to push towards, that they were both already changed far more than Tony had realised, that there
all this – but Steve knew he did. And he couldn’t stop it, he couldn’t fix this-
Steve just had a
In fact, for the first time since he was a teenager, Steve didn’t bully himself out of bed. He actually pulled the duvet back up over his head, and closed his eyes again - and let himself be sad…
But, Jesus, the thought of Tony drinking anyone else’s blood had turned Steve’s entire body to ice. Instantly.
Tony knew that was intentional.
He squeezed his eyes shut, and gave his head a shake, and warned himself to concentrate. When he looked back at the tower, his vision was obscured by purple shadows, but still, he finally managed to pick out the shapes of at least two people standing by the entrance. They were both wearing dark grey uniforms - completely removed from the florid, fleshy aesthetic of the city centre - and standing in a posture that was instantly recognisable as ‘bored security guy’.
He slid his hand into Steve’s, and felt the gentle strength of Steve’s grip warm all the way along his arm…
“Well, it could have been worse,” Tony muttered, pinching his lips together in a performative smile. And then he glanced away again, before he added, very carefully, “at least I’m not actually attracted to Clint. That would’ve been more awkward…”
“And I don’t even mean – why can’t everyone
As he trudged through to his little living area he glanced up at the clock, willing it to be later than he already knew it was-
And Tony suddenly realised just how
You, oh-”
Those were things that Steve hadn’t wanted to confess
Steve stayed standing, still trying to get his breathing under control, still reciting reassurances and reminders in his head…
He’d lost his temper with that before sunrise, and decided to just get up for the day instead. He’d showered, and dressed, and briefly considered going for a run, just for something to do with all this pent up energy-
That’s

Captain America,” he shrugged, a playful look in his eye. “And I just thought - seeing as punching my way to you isn’t an option this time, maybe I’d just... plan it,” And then he took a step back, breaking their embrace so that he could take both of Tony’s hands in his, held close to his chest as he carried on, “I promise, no one is going to know I was here. There won’t be any surveillance footage, any record of me - I honestly think I put more thought into this than I did breaking out of the raft, just so that I could see you… Because I miss you. So much.”
There had been thoughts. He knew that. Oddly distant, surprisingly unemotional thoughts… observations that occurred to him, simply and entirely at random.
And then Tony had to break away to gasp for air, and Steve looked up at him…
“Because… You know, we actually have a blood donor shortage in this country. A lot of places do. There aren’t enough people who donate blood anyway, and then a lot of
He didn’t really know why he was questioning it, other than he was confused and insecure and Tony still felt like a safe haven somehow, even as he was so scared of losing him. The desperation to keep all of this hidden from him couldn’t quite overcome the instinct to run to him - not now that he’d hit a crisis this huge.
It was that mentality that he’d fallen back into last night. A hard stop on the noise in his head, a plain refusal to think about the doubt and the guilt and the things that weren’t helpful. He would

That he’d thought Tony was beautiful, and he’d liked something Tony said, and then he’d… just…
Steve felt himself being overwhelmed in a far more comprehensive way. This wasn’t the gentle bending of his moods that he’d been inhaling for days. This wasn’t a case of individual symptoms welling up. It was nothing like the slip into intoxication that he remembered from his nights drinking in Brooklyn. This felt more like a fog closing in around him. Something that was soaking into him, changing

And Tony had forgotten whatever sense that made, and remembered that such things were a very big deal, usually…
“Uh… Honestly, nothing I can think of,” Steve shrugged. “I mean, I’ve been very well provided for, so far…”

“I should… go…” Steve accepted sadly, having to drop his eyes before he could get the words out. He felt Tony exhale heavily.

Steve had watched the blush running up Tony’s neck, the whole time he’d been talking. He’d seen the rapidly increasing effort it took for Tony to maintain eye contact. And now he saw Tony swallow hard, and open his mouth for words he hadn’t actually found yet, and Steve was more sure than ever that he was right.
“That mission in Germany,” Steve realised aloud, his eyes brightening as he found it-
“Get out of the building,” Steve confirmed, only slightly breathless. “Contact the team – well, if they aren’t already here,” he commented, glancing at the guards. “We don’t know why the cameras went out.”

If you would like more details, please get in touch via the methods listed above. If you are uncomfortable with these themes and would still like to continue with the story, I'd be happy to provide a summary without the details - these issues are not discussed again in anywhere near this much depth again.
Something in his brain told him to go back, that there was an element here they hadn’t prepared for… but his legs overruled him. They just followed Tony down the stairs. They came out at the corner of a small, low ceilinged basement, lit with naked florescent bars. The whole room was made of concrete, and contained four mismatched old office desks, on which eight top-of-the-line computers were sitting idle. There was another door at the back of the room, and Steve could just about make out the sounds of people behind it… a low murmur of industry, like the ammunitions factories at home.
And it occurred to him to wonder whether Quill blew it in
Tony took a sharp intake of breath, throwing his head away from Steve and standing up from the couch, as though he’d been pulled by the force of that movement.
that feeling, about wishing that epiphanies were cleaner, like that… I remember when I had palladium poisoning, and everything was turning to shit - and
That was the only explanation that Tony could think of for his sudden, ludicrous change of heart. That he’d simply lost his head for a second…
“Okay,” he muttered, looking away again. “If you want to, then, thank you, I guess… I mean, I’m not mad at you anyway, so, I don’t know if it’s ‘I forgive you’, or… whatever… But, it’s fine…”
Which wasn’t the real answer, obviously. Tony hadn’t bothered to think of the

But Steve was already reaching up for him, tensing

“Right, yeah, JARVIS, unlock all the workshop cabinets,” Tony said, dismissively.
Tony looked at him, his hair still damp from the shower, his bag dangling from his shoulder… for all his commanding strength and despite everything he’d been through, there was something so pure and innocent about Steve. A simple goodness that couldn’t be complicated by anything. He had the same nervous optimism about him now as a kid leaving home for the first time…
“…She called the team after you hung up on her,” Pepper continued, somewhat awkwardly. “She’d already tried to contact Captain Rogers by the time I called back, no answer. I passed on the details I had – she said they’d send a response right away.”
A desperate, guttural
Tony had come to think that was what love meant. That whatever his hypothetical perfect relationship was - and however unlikely that he’d really find it - it would have to begin with someone who wouldn’t try to rescue him. That would have to be built into the very foundations…
“This,” Steve conceded, with a grin. He heard the dull gasp of the refrigerator door being pulled open, the muted banging of Bucky grabbing several water bottles from the bottom shelf.
… there was such an overwhelming sense of relief.
Until, eventually, Tony’s entire body was weakened by it, his sides aching sharply with the effort of it, his face streaked with tears. By the time it
“You’re
And then at last, Steve was dressed and ready, looking like himself again. A quick time check told him he was still ahead of schedule-

When he really got to thinking about it - and with more than a little help from Tony - Steve realised that submission didn’t have to mean degradation and pain, if that wasn’t what interested him about it.
…And into his lap.
He gave the papers one final, purely performative glance, before he fell into the couch with a happy sigh.
“No, actually,” Tony answered. “In fact, I don’t think the problem is in your arm at all.”
It was, therefore, about ten minutes after sunset when Steve rapped authoritatively on Wesley’s door.
Which was usually the start of other, less focused thoughts… Sometimes, at that point, Steve would just go from ‘pinned naked to a bed’ and proceed to lose endless minutes reliving tiny little details of that night. Sometimes he’d think back to that first time, in Tony’s workshop – getting to see it all anew, now that he had all this hope and excitement to apply to it. Sometimes Steve would start daydreaming about nights they
for both of them –
Steve’s arms folded tight around him, pulling Tony so hard against him that he almost pulled him off his feet. Immediately, Steve was flooded by a wave of euphoria, a wordless joy and overwhelming physical relief that rolled up through his body until it swallowed him completely - until there was nothing but the smell of Tony’s hair and the warmth of his skin and the dizzying happiness of being allowed to touch him…
That’s where.
or whatever you want to call them, and, yeah, maybe I’ll have to put up with that. But, I’m not worried about it this time.”
He put his hand to the side of Steve face, running his thumb along Steve’s jaw as he tiled his head to kiss him deeper. He felt Steve’s arms pull tighter around him, pulling him closer. There was a shock of pleasure as Steve bucked up against him, a delicious friction that left a deep, aching need in its wake. Tony pulled Steve’s bottom lip between his teeth, and Steve shivered, and Tony

Steve allowed a more genuine smile for that - before he glanced down at the briefcase, and remembered his bad mood.
So, instead of doing either, Tony let his head fall back onto Steve’s chest, and quietly wondered…
– there was no need to spiral into hours of analysis of that one throwaway comment.
“Oh! An excellent choice!” Rousseau assured them. “You know, there’s a rumour that Dr Dale Arden has developed an entirely new species of-”
The discovery that the vampire blood samples had been split into ‘families’ would probably have unnerved him at one point, and brought to mind some dramatic, gothic myth… But now Steve simply accepted them as medical terms, no different to the Latin names for flowers.

But Tony pulled his arm back anyway, in respect to all those safeguards and assumptions he’d spent two decades building.
The second appointment was the first time Bucky had to be put under a general anaesthetic – and Steve was more nervous about it than he was.
“It’s okay,” Tony repeated, with a smile. “Come and sit down, and we’ll talk about it.”
And now Tony realised, he
He really did try to do the right thing - to check himself, to think about how to be mature and realistic and fair…
That snide little whisper that Obie had planted in his head… or, who knew, maybe it was there even before that. Cultivated and nurtured by so many betrayals, and so many years of shame and isolation…
Tony could hardly believe he hadn’t felt this sympathy for him an hour ago. It seemed so obvious now.
Beneath the electric thrill running through his veins and the inexpressible urgency pulsing in his muscles, there was only one word in Tony’s head.
Everyone was sitting too stiffly, the conversation was stilted and awkward… The air was thick.

“So, in conclusion,” Tony announced, theatrically. “Since you went on your last trip, I have fallen in love with a man I can never have, had sex with him knowing full well it can’t go anywhere, and I’m already doubting my ability to not lead him on. And I broke all the rules I’ve had for the last twenty years, and now I can’t remember why they were rules. And I’m not sure if I’m actually less of a monster than I thought I was, or way more of a monster than I ever imagined. And it’s possible I just wasted the last twenty years of my life, because I never needed to do any of this,
He saw Steve’s breath catch, the hint of a smile behind his shock.

And there was a beat.

Tony paused for a moment so that he could get his bearings. He ran his eyes over the alien landscape without any real care, oblivious to how strange he’d found it a few days earlier, until eventually he caught sight of the bar again. It was nearer than he’d expected it to be, but still mostly obscured from view by the crowd - he still couldn’t make out many of the details. From here, he could only say that it looked like the pop-up bars you see along promenades in tourist season. Tony could see the denser crowd packed tight around the edge of it as people bustled for service, and then the more casual people who hovered at the side-lines, taking a moment out of the festival to enjoy their drinks. He couldn’t see Steve... but then, he wouldn’t expect to. From this distance, he couldn’t make out much of anything. So, calmly, Tony fixed his gaze on his destination and started walking towards it.
I’m not saying it isn’t uncomfortable, or that I wouldn’t trade my entire personal fortune not to have this whole thing go away, or anything… But, in the grand scheme of things, thinking of what’s at stake here… the, uh,

“So, Zan was lying about that too, it wasn’t the humans who turned these drugs against them”

Which only added to the rage coursing under Steve’s skin.
He recognised the heavy stickiness dripping down his neck… the little bead of come that was slowly working its way under the collar…
And then Tony made himself look up.
When Pepper had texted him the first time, to ask if he’d be making an appearance at his own New Year’s party, the idea was just deeply unappealing. By the third text it had seemed philosophically impossible. It was just… all too far away from where he was.

He blinked his eyes open in time to watch Tony free his other hand, Tony’s fingers working in that same clever, fluid way even now that they were trembling slightly. Steve surrendered his arm to gravity, letting it fall into the same happy stupor as the rest of him, his eyes still lazily fixed on Tony…
Steve nodded. And then there was an awkward silence. And then Tony sighed again.
… And there was a shimmering haze suspended in the air above it, that Steve immediately recognised as a cloud of pollen.
After all, it wasn’t as though Tony had to plot different ways to bump into him anymore, or worry about every little interaction they had - he knew that Steve would race to be with him the moment his meeting ended, and that Tony would be able to share absolutely anything with him...
“Okay, Tony,” Pepper tried again more softly, stepping over to him so that she could put a gentle hand to his arm,

Steve was thinking of the raid at Helen Cho’s lab, the fact that Wanda and Peitro had helped Ultron to take her hostage.
Meeting Tony had offered him an alternative to being lost and lonely, made him believe that there might be something
But he carried on.
He wouldn’t make personal comments about Steve’s sleeping habits, except maybe to gently mock them. Not in an earnest attempt to build some common ground between them, certainly.
Steve felt himself step back into the room. His self-interested obsession was set aside, along with everything else, as he remembered all the things he was usually focused on from the outset. The things he knew Bucky was afraid of. The things they always had to argue about. They’d avoided all of that so far, because Tony had let Bucky lead the conversation – but Steve knew there was no way that Tony would just accept this one. No one did. Most people took it for granted that Bucky would want to be numbed, some even went as far as administering things without telling him – and every single one of them argued, when Bucky said he didn’t want it. They all made him struggle to explain his resistance, they always made him feel ridiculous for his objections, and most of the time they ended up getting their own way. Steve could see the entire conversation unfolding in front of him. He knew every beat off by heart-
In some ways, it was impossible to

“You are just

And he caught himself, and took a little breath, and made himself slow down.
And then Steve stirred softly against him, his eyes fluttering gently before he settled back into Tony’s chest – and Tony had to take a second to let that overwhelming affection surge through him.
But, of course, the light bulb had already lit up in Tony’s brain - and Steve’s too, if the way he tensed was any indication.
Tony was certain that Steve was having difficulty
That was-
It was such an overwhelming experience. Tony was gripped by a bottomless, physical horror. A level of terror that he’d never conceived of,

“Okay Steve, I know this probably isn’t the right time, but we’ve gone way past the right time so many times that you’re running out of time,” Bucky began, impatiently - all of which went right over Steve’s head. “So, I’m sorry if this comes out all wrong or if you find it hard to listen to me, but you

I mean, I know everyone can’t believe we didn’t know that the strike team were Hydra, because they ‘looked evil’ or whatever, but all jokes aside – we went out for drinks with Rumlow. Do you remember Ali, who had the baby with the breathing problem, and you paid for an operation and his wife made you cookies?
Somewhere in amongst all this he had the vague impression they’d walked along several corridors… and through a few rooms he didn’t remember…

There was the answer.
Tony looked over at Steve again – and Steve just threw his hands up in surrender.
And then that general contentment began to form into something more like conscious thought… He became aware that this feeling of security and happiness had a form, a reason, a face, a name.

“Oh, hey,” Bucky greeted him, in that rushed tone of someone just on their way out the door. “I was going to call you-”
“Hey, guys.” Rhodey’s voice snapped them both out of what might’ve been a bottomless moment. They just had time to catch the stoic nod that came from the Varian adults, before they turned to face him. “How’re you feeling? You ready to go?”
“…I don’t really know

To the point where he felt as though he’d lost all hold on his long-term plans, but not the toxic reliance on them. To the point where he felt bad about where he was, no matter from which angle he looked at it.

“We can’t wait together?” Steve asked, and Janine flashed an apologetic smile.

what Tony was talking about.
“Hi,” Steve breathed, already walking towards Tony with a dazed smile on his face.
There was a pleasant little ache in Tony’s legs as he finally took the weight off of them. Nowhere near what it should have been, seeing as it had been ten hours since he last sat down… But then, Tony was starting to forget how tired he was ‘supposed’ to feel, at any given point. Already, he was starting to get used to this level of endurance, taking it for granted even. He’d tried going to bed

The things that don’t change anything when you leave the room, the things where you don’t even want to think about the background – the things you just want to
“Would you prefer if Captain Rogers was here, if you were under a general anaesthetic?” Tony guessed. It wasn’t until he saw Bucky’s eyes widen optimistically that it dawned on him…
“Well, you know one place that’s been a Hydra base since the early nineties,” Tony interrupted casually, not even bothering to open his eyes.
Tony had no idea how much time had passed, if time was even still passing, or if everything had just
“Duly noted, sir,” JARVIS answered.
And then he looked up at Steve, who was so obviously lost inside his own head…
“It’s always going to be like this, now,” Tony promised. Wanting to reassure Steve that all the games were over with, that he’d
He could walk away from Steve now.
He felt Tony pull out of him, but Steve couldn’t open his eyes, or couldn’t focus his vision… he couldn’t tell which.

That pure, painful hatred still pulsed through Tony’s veins. A
Steve let his forehead rest against the blankets, spreading his legs, bodily begging Tony to touch him again. The next few seconds stretched to the very limit of possibility-
He felt Tony flinch back to stare at him. He saw Janine’s eyes widen just slightly at the severity of both of their responses.
As one minute stretched into two, and then three, Steve’s mind became preoccupied by all the things he was trying
He was just so shocked by how familiar that image felt, even though he knew he’d never seen it before - how quickly and completely he understood what he was looking at.
Tony grinned, and took a sip of his coffee. He had learned better than to try and control these trains of thought; he knew now that he could only roll with what occurred to him. So, that made it a pleasant discovery, to find that there were at least some warm, happy thoughts to see him through this interlude…

a familiar face.
Tony almost smiled at himself then, an amused sort of embarrassment at catching himself out. Recognising only too well that he’d spent the whole week fighting a permanent temptation to call Steve – and that, whatever he tried to tell himself in the moment, it was never actually because he had an important question, or a notable breakthrough, or… whatever excuses he’d invented.
He liked to think of Steve looking at him now,

There was an endless, bottomless moment, in which Tony was just holding onto Steve’s wrist – and Steve was just

“She said it was like a school assembly” Tony sighed, falling into the couch. “Latest news, upcoming events, blah, blah, blah. Might give us some background on the place…”

Well, who knew.

Falling in love with Tony had given Steve’s life a meaning. It had given him something for himself; it had helped him to find himself again.
That made it sound like Pepper was uncomfortable to be around, like she’d been doing something wrong… Tony thought back to the way his mother used to look forward to his father’s business trips, the way she longed for a reprieve from Howard’s pettiness and temper and the atmosphere he created, and immediately Tony felt horrible for ever using the same

This was the first time since they’d started this thing that Tony didn’t feel completely lost.

“Go on then smart guy, like what?” Sam challenged. And Bucky felt a hot prickle of conflict - sharp and uncomfortable and somehow compelling - as he recognised that he couldn’t actually think of anything. “See, I thought not,” Sam told him, when the pause had dragged on long enough to make his point. “And, anyway, this is pretty rich coming from Mr ‘Also Spartacus’.” He gestured accusingly to the bed-sheet togas that Bucky and Tony were still wearing.
A low growl rolled from Steve’s chest as Tony’s cock pushed past his rim, a pleasant heat flooding up in his loosened muscles as Tony slowly filled him up. And then Tony caressed one hand up to Steve’s shoulder, grinding into him and he leaned down over him, his chest finally pressing against him as he took Steve’s mouth in a possessive kiss-

He stopped in front of the car and turned to face Steve, and found a look of such honest feral hunger that his entire body froze under the force of it - like a rabbit caught in the gaze of a predator…
So, overwhelmed by bloodlust though he undeniably was, Tony sucked Steve’s fingers very gently, letting one hand come to rest softly against Steve’s ribs. He could feel Steve’s determination to stay still, the way his torso trembled under Tony’s palm, the way his muscles tensed into him. And then Tony ran the tip of his tongue directly over the cut, letting the last of that taste spread slowly through his mouth, waiting until the latest wave of euphoria had rolled through his head before he finally relaxed his lips and moved Steve’s hand away.

Every mission comes in difference phases. They both knew this. And, without having to say a word, they both knew they were about to start a different stage of this thing.
“Well, I can go and wait with Bucky,” he suggested, reluctantly. “If you want to… fix it now, I mean.”
All as high end as any other room they’d been in – the effect of which was starting to wear off the more Steve got used to it, and what does that tell you about human nature? Now that he looked, there were a few couples getting especially friendly on the couches at the very back of the room… so apparently they were getting on for that time of the day… Behind him, somewhere far off to the left, Steve just about caught the movement of someone coming out from behind the bar he was leaning on.
Until, slowly, he became aware that he
He’d never considered that someone might want to take on all the chaos of his life, and not see it as a burden. He’d certainly never considered that they’d be delighted to do it. He’d never once thought that someone might try to save him from everything

And then, at last, he finished soldering the final panel back into place. He put down his tools and looked over at Bucky’s monitor, checking all of his vital signs. And, as Tony satisfied himself that everything was correct and complete and as it should be, he felt that tension running up his back again…

He’d taken three of them down before Tony had a chance to move - still radiating that cold authority, so certain and deliberate in his movements…

And with that, he threw his head back, and then covered his face with his hands, and groaned.

...Even without the strange state of euphoria, he’d know that
“What’s Tabula Rasa?” Steve squinted, spotting it again on another screen.
But Tony told himself not to think about that – smiling all the while. He told himself that it was nice enough that Steve was on his way over.
“He's called Loki. He's... not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.”
This time he thought he’d try just shutting up and letting Steve think.
That he didn’t know how much grip or force or extension to use, or something… that he’d have to be careful, not to miss, or smash the glass…

And Tony let his head fall back, one hand moving to grab the back of Steve’s head – the other slipping under Steve’s underwear, groping him harder. Steve let one of his hands slide down over Tony’s chest, until he could run it roughly over the outline of Tony’s cock. Tony’s whole body jerked, and he tugged sharply at Steve’s hair, and smiled, close to his ear.

“No…” Tony repeated, realising a lot of this as he was saying it. “No, I understand making a mistake, or digging yourself into a hole. Better than most people, actually. If you’d have said
to do. He’d found himself talking to Tony about politics, and his childhood, and his pet hates – all things that were too personal and too controversial to be comfortable, usually. Topics that Steve would instinctively shy away from were suddenly just… things that came to mind.
That the desire would still be there – that it would hurt them both too much to try and ignore it.
Had he really just said that?
Tony really thought he was just going to step forward and kiss Steve. Seeing the world as it actually was, it seemed such an obvious thing to do – so obviously what
going horribly wrong was still there, and still terrifying, and of a different thing entirely to his harmless anxieties about whether or not Tony liked him…
Tony very nearly laughed.
“So, what’s wrong with that asshole?” Bucky asked, carelessly.
The point was, even if this list of mistakes wasn’t quite the monster under the bed that it had been… It was still pretty bad. And Steve owed Tony a better apology for it-
Steve would never even know…
Except nothing was okay now. For Tony at least, nothing had really changed since Steve had rammed his shield into his heart. Since the day Steve had explained that he’d

He wrapped an arm tight across Tony’s hips, taking his weight completely as he shuffled back towards a nearby sun lounger that was standing at the edge of the pool – thinking only of getting to the nearest soft surface. He sat down on the end of it with a somewhat graceless bump, Tony still held in his lap.

“And, I, just… really, really wish I’d said some of this earlier” Tony sighed, giving his head a little shake at his own silliness – still smiling.
That seemed like the right level of busy work. Something that wasn’t technically necessary to the plan as it stood, something that wasn’t officially on the list of tasks he and Steve had to tackle together - but something that still

But he could feel Steve looking at him.

“Are you really?” Steve snapped back, with such force that everyone at the table sat upright in unison. Even Wanda’s expression flickered at what was clearly a most unexpected reaction-
“Okay,” Tony replied, his voice flat.
That one specific photo of Steve on the desk in his fathers office, the one that Howard had always refused to look directly at, and yet never moved…
Steve managed a thin smile. Actually,
For an hour they just sat there and talked, enjoying the incidental touches that they missed so much the rest of the time, taking in the little details of one another and smiling. Every so often Steve would pull the robe tighter, and the silk-cotton blend would drag over his skin, sparking an electric shiver that was part pleasure, part anticipation. A few times, Tony had slipped into that dark tone of voice, or flashed that authoritative smile, and Steve had become very aware of how naked he was under this thin layer of fabric… But, for the most part, that first hour had been like any of the conversations they indulged in when they finally got a chance to be together.

going to hate it every time you could get hurt. That’s just the way it is, whether we’re together or not, whether I say it out loud or not. And I am always going to prefer the option where you can’t get hurt - and I’m always going to look for that option, every time. But that’s not the same as thinking you’re never going to do anything risky. That’s not me trying to stop you. That’s

Steve was sure this shouldn’t feel good - that he certainly shouldn’t be getting carried away with how good it felt, when he had so many things to think about…
Or, to be honest, while he willed himself to focus on the issues.
He wanted to
He may not know how to fix any of this - but coffee always made everything a little bit better.
Peirce breathed an obliging laugh.
fuck Steve – if that was all it was, if he’d even been able to separate that part of it out, then he probably would’ve just run with it the other night in the lounge, or gone straight to this when Steve got to this room. But it had never been that. He would never have wanted this if Steve didn’t… but it was more than that. He’d only ever wanted this
Going back to that moment had always been one of Steve’s three magic wishes - the sort of thing that wasn’t even a dream, it was so far outside the realms of reality. He’d asked himself how this would feel, entirely hypothetically, so many times-

that was never what their fight was about. Even though he knew that Steve had never really chosen anything over him, and it had been unfair and immature and irrational to ever think of things that way… Still, it mattered. It was the upside of all those emotional, painful nights before Tony knew all that - there would always be a deeper emotional reaction to moments like this.

But before he could even work out why, Tony had glanced away to take a steading breath and put his mask back up. When he looked back at Steve there was a fragile sort of courage in his eyes.
“But yeah, I wouldn’t have said it quite like that, if I’d known – and I should’ve known, that…” Tony sighed, and tried to order this in his head. “Well, for a start, I want to apologise for how… unfairly done, all that was, and… for the fact that I only did it that way because I assumed you didn’t care about any of it, which is kinda what I’m trying to apologise for in general”
And now Natasha looked completely different to him, as quickly as that.
Steve gave his head a self-conscious little shake, and decided to carry on up to the breakroom. It seemed as good a place as any to sit down for a few minutes, and… well, carry on thinking about Tony.

And Tony threw his head back and moaned, primal and wanton and loud enough that it must’ve echoed all down the hallway.
“Please Tony, please, please,” came easier now that Steve had found his voice… and felt so much better than he’d been expecting. He didn’t even know if he remembered the right meaning of the words… he just knew it felt good to say them. That Tony liked it when he said them. “Please Tony, please, I want you, I want-

Which was the first time it occurred to Tony that Rhodey was, quite obviously, very stoned…
In terms of fair warning, I should let you know that this particular scene is a fade to black, and the next update will start 'the morning after' - although there IS more smut in the next update, if that helps to compensate :-D
He hadn’t expected to feel that again, watching himself from just a few weeks earlier
An impulse that came directly from this new and unique bond he had to Steve – something that was simply a part of him now, that he would always feel, that he’d always have to take into consideration, from the point on-
Steve was so used to enduring these events with a sense of loss and longing and inadequacy. Watching Tony shine so brightly, torn by the conflict of loving Tony so much but hating how that made him feel. Simply taking for granted that he couldn’t have any part of him. Never sure if he longed to be close to Tony, or if he wanted to run from the pain of never being close enough.
Two long strides and he would’ve been there, between Steve and any danger-
…And then, as they were still walking, he felt the world come slightly back towards focus. At least compared to the all-encompassing wave that had hit him when they first walked in
And all the while that warmth kept building, bubbling up into a pleasant sort of excitement now that he’d allowed it.

The sting and shock of it jarred him out of his thoughts. A sharp hiss broke out of his chest as he put the frame down on the counter, thinking he’d immediately look at the cut-

And yet Tony knew so well what Steve didn’t even know himself…

If he’d already let something slip…
Or, rather, he recognised how surreal it was to be sitting here, rather than just dreaming about it. Steve had seen these four walls so many times, over so many years. He’d heard the rhythm of this exact radio broadcast in the background of so many nightmares…
But out here in the courtyard everything was slow, and comfortable, and calm.
Perhaps it was just that he’d grown desensitised to these fears. After all, there were only so many times he could ask himself what was normal before it started to feel normal to ask. There was only so much anxiety he could generate for the same memory, once he’d watched it a thousand times. Even if the thoughts were as horrible as they’d ever been, there was only so horrible he could feel about it.
But, fuck it, this was good-
He was still an undead, inhuman monster, who couldn’t go out in the daytime and had to drink blood
And God, Steve loved him.
It wasn’t that Steve had dismissed all his previous mistakes as having ‘happened for a reason’.

Of course, Steve was always sure to stomp those thoughts down - he

Tony hated that he did that to Rhodey, and to Pepper. He didn’t want to do it to anyone else.
That any dreams he’d had about marriage and kids and a future together might have been rendered irrelevant - laughable, even.
All he had to do was keep his head, remember all the things he’d learned, and stick with the plan that was so far making his every wish come true…

He knew exactly when and how his window of opportunity was going to come about. He knew exactly how to use it.
of Steve, that wonderful sense of satisfaction that had washed over Tony as he watched Steve snuggle softly into sleep… Was that because Tony loved him?
By the time Steve had made the journey from New York the sun was setting over the ocean, the brightest stars lying on the horizon like a decorative glitter. The deep red of the darkening sky was reflected on the water, the dying sunlight catching on the waves like a gold trim - which struck Steve as especially poignant. Exactly as he would have painted it.
“Okay…so, I’ll see you tomorrow, and then we’ll go alien hunting.” Steve concluded, weakly, already walking passed him.
And then he went to take that first ungainly stride towards the patio - and realised that he hadn’t been standing on the floor of the pool, as he’d assumed. The layer of plastic balls he was actually standing on rolled away from him the moment he moved, and Steve found himself sinking a foot deeper with a surprised huff. There was another delighted giggle from Tony, as Steve tried to wriggle upwards, to get his head above the surface.
For them all to know how beautiful Tony was, that Tony was

smooth since about the sixth grade…
Tony was waiting anxiously for Steve to get home.
No, no, that wasn’t…
And then he looked back at Steve - in time to catch the way his face had fallen, before he bravely rearranged himself into that stoic posture.
“Because the state we’re in now, I don’t trust either of us not to sneeze into it or something” Tony grinned – and
“...Yes,” Steve realised, the smile growing as he the true potential of this gift unfolded in his mind…
“Yeah, sounds like a plan…” He muttered, and then, in pure desperation, he added, “I’m sorry, I’m just suddenly really tired.”
A little bloom of hope, deep in his chest, as he realised – that
!” Steve exhaled, throwing his arms open in a gesture of victory.
He barely even heard it when the security guard let go of that oh-so-familiar sigh, and uttered a phrase that Tony had heard a thousand times - and always in that same weary, superior tone of voice.
He still had to think about all his vulnerabilities, all those risks – and for Pepper, and Rhodey, not to mention the company and the Avengers and all the people who relied on them…

something more, for vampires. An additional level of closeness and commitment and trust. Another layer of attraction and desire, on top of all the others… something that affected his mind and his body, his thoughts and his emotions, just like every other part of it.
“So I see,” Peirce smiled, strolling around his desk and sitting down - glancing at the chair on the opposite side, in a silent invitation to do the same.
And he was beyond processing it, obviously… but, maybe, as it turned out, there was just a little part of him that begrudged the fact that Tony had seen all of this for himself, so easily and so readily. That Tony had apologised before Steve could say any of this. Even if more of him was relieved and grateful for the understanding they had come to – maybe a very basic, primal little part of him had felt cheated of something…
“Oh, Tony…” he breathed, caressing his arms over Tony’s back again, pulling him in.

“Why?” Steve asked, belatedly.
But Steve didn’t dare look away from the trolley – the row of syringes, glinting ominously under the strip lighting.
And Tony did think… or
Oh, that was… bad…
“You know what, Nick? Tony was kidnapped by terrorists, who wired a car battery into his chest and ordered him to make weapons for them - and he built a robot suit out of discarded missile pieces, and not only did he escape, he took down the terrorist organisation for good measure. And rather than thinking that was an astounding feat of bravery and brilliance, and thinking how lucky you’d be to work with someone like that, you decided to emotionally torture him. Really

find it easier to concentrate when Tony was close. He was certainly more focused, more observant… less irritable and clumsy. Even so, he couldn’t kid himself that he’d be studying harder if Tony was in the Tower right now-
this brilliance and bravery and joy and kindness and strength. Just to know you were real… There is nothing I wouldn’t give, nothing I wouldn’t do, for the chance to touch you like this… I wouldn’t take any of it back. I wouldn’t risk changing a single thing that brought me to this…” Steve paused with a smile when Tony’s voice cracked, his fingertips pressing against Tony’s skin in a quiet reassurance. Tony swallowed hard - only trying to contain it so that he wouldn’t stop Steve from speaking. Steve waited until Tony had settled into his breathing again, making sure to keep his gaze as he carried on, “
part of things was about Steve - that Steve was the one who was going to be really hurt by this, and that it was for Steve to decide what they were going to do…
Without much background knowledge and no frame of reference and no one to talk to about it, Steve had simply absorbed one particular meaning of these words. Ideas like
Instinctively, he knew he’d have more luck snapping himself out of this if he thought of Siberia than if he thought of Anni-Vara. Which was horrible, obviously, and probably meant that he was a shallow, self-interested asshole – but those were the facts he was dealing with. The plight of a whole alien race probably wouldn’t be enough to tear him out of this moment… if it had been real. But remembering it wasn’t… remembering that moment, when he asked Steve
Maybe that didn’t make sense, after a couple of hours of shallow chit-chat… but over the course of those insubstantial conversations, Tony felt like he’d

The guy who thinks it’s his job to sit there and absorb all his boyfriends negative emotions and find a way to fix everything for them. The guy the world blames for not being able to save someone they never put in danger, who they really
And maybe it was the effects of the drugs, or maybe he’d been paying more attention than he realised to Bucky’s rant… But, quite out of nowhere, things started falling into place.
“You want to break into a mysterious tower?” Steve summarised, sceptically.
The fact that Steve was now part way into
Exhausted though he was, Tony was now sober enough to recognise every nuance in Rhodey’s voice. Tony knew exactly what level of ball-ache this clean up was shaping up to be… probably light to middling, in the grand scheme of things – but pretty damned frustrating, in the immediate.  He could tell that the team had dealt with the vast majority of issues in the few hours that they’d been here; and, naturally, Rhodey was focussing on the elements that were going to be complicated and uncooperative and awkward, further down the line.
…And more.

His head swam, briefly, like it was struggling to get up. His eyes burned, like they’d only just realised they were open.

Feelings he didn’t run from, feelings he stood up to, time and time again-
his blood turning to ice. He felt his spine straighten, and his muscles tense up, as the cold began to soak through him… And then, somehow,
Steve made the hottest little whimpering sound as Tony took his hand away, unconsciously trying to shuffle closer as Tony unfastened his belt.

He just took a deep breath, and stepped into the elevator.

“No, it’ll have to be sooner than that,” Tony answered, easily – because, hey, he knew that one. That was the whole reason Bucky had to call him right away and report this symptom. Tony knew, if he acted quickly enough, he could use that pain to locate the problem. If he waited, the ‘bad connection’ would just find another inefficient way to mask its own issues, and possibly infect all the work Tony had done so far.

See, what did that make him smile? Just because he’d said it to Steve?
And then, just as Tony thought he might actually break down into desperate sobbing, Steve sat

Which, incidentally, was how men were told to deal with their mistakes when Steve was a kid. You accepted you’d fucked up, you vowed not to do it again, you didn’t whine about the fact that you’d lost that job or that opportunity or that friendship. An apology was simply that, in the forties –
Steve felt as though he was outside of his own body, floating high above himself, watching himself make the faltering journey down to Tony’s workshop, like he was watching someone else...
Steve’s fingers flexed gently at his sides. His gaze dropped to Tony’s lips-
And he was glad.
Steve felt himself break out into a grin, his thoughts briefly overwhelmed by a burst of bright, shiny happiness-
“But you think maybe you can do to Zan what Scott did to Sonny?” Steve brought his focus back to the issue. And Tony looked back at his screen.

And Tony preferred the route that started in
Well, if there was, then it was going to take Steve more than a few minutes to figure it out - and Tony was waiting for an answer now.
“C’mere.” He mumbled, tugging Steve’s arm –
“What?” Tony asked them with an exasperated sigh - which only made them laugh even harder.
This could’ve been minutes or hours after Tony collapsed onto Steve’s chest, panting and whimpering and pleading. He had no idea how long he’d whited out for, or how long it’d been since he’d come around, cradled tightly in Steve’s arms. And, for
And all the while there was still that constant pressure against his throat; that reassuring caress that moved in time with his racing heartbeat.
“With what?” Steve asked, all enthusiastic and interested and… adorable…
But he found that there was another page nestled between those two sections - with several words manually blacked out.

“And what exactly is this evening?” Tony asked – because he was still trying to remember what questions he’d prepared, before his little meltdown. What it was okay for him to be curious about, and what he was supposed to know already, and that uncomfortably broad category of topics where he couldn’t be sure either way. “The woman who told us about it called it an assembly.” Dev laughed, good naturedly, at that.

And then he began to recognise the outburst he’d just had…
He didn’t even bother to watch as she scrambled for the stairs.
“Nothing, I’m - I’m sorry, that was a stupid thing to say, and I don’t know why I said it,” Nick stammered, already backing his way out of the room. “I’ll… I’ll tell the others you’re-”
“I can’t think about this right now. This is… just… a lot, and I can’t just answer you… right away, like this.”
It might even have been a comfort, somehow.
Once again, he found that actually talking to people was no where near as terrifying as the very thought of it.
Tony felt his balls tighten, his spine jarring straight.

Tony laughed gently – trying not to get too carried away with the little stirring of happiness in his stomach.
Steve wasn’t sure how much of his story Tony had believed - but he knew for sure that Tony had been intrigued by it. Steve had seen his determination to define the problem, his impatience to understand it, his frustration of not being able to find the questions quick enough to keep up with his theories-
long ago…
Already, this felt more significant, more
Steve gulped a ragged breath, clawing at the sheets as that burning pleasure crawled its way up his spine. Tony dug his fingertips into Steve’s hips just a little harder, pulling Steve into him at that same careful, measured pace. fucking him open, filling him up.

There was a dull cheer from the room, and a sudden uniform motion. He recognised everyone raising their glass to the air… so he did the same…
Those were the ones he was avoiding.

“Tell you what,” Tony suggested, putting his notes aside with a flourish. “Why don’t I make us more coffee, and we can talk about superhero ethics for a while instead - I’m bored of intelligent virus design for one night.”
