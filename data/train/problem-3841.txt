“Two—two weeks?” Dean asked, glancing at Sam, whose pinched expression confirmed it. “I was in heaven for...maybe two minutes? Five, tops.”
Then Sam visiting Eileen turned into Eileen visiting Sam. And then it was Sam standing shiftily in Dean’s bedroom doorway, asking in a painfully roundabout way if it would be alright for Eileen to live in the bunker, maybe go on a few hunts with them. To which Dean rolled his eyes.
Castiel's records are growing out of control- he carries a string of small notebooks, looped together at their spines by a piece of twine. They are filled with thousands of small passages, like “Butte Montana, 2007, June 6, 5:00 pm—no” and “Black Rock, New York, 2007, October 18, 8:30 pm—yes”.
“Cas, what—” his voice came out ragged and hoarse. Cas shook him slightly as he spoke, and whatever Dean had intended to say slipped out of his mind as he stared wide-eyed at Cas’s still-steady, unwavering gaze.
“Goodnight,” Dean said, shutting Charlie’s door behind her. Even though she’d moved out, she still had a real room of her own with some left-behind decor and trappings of comfort. Sometimes, when nobody came by for a while, Dean would go in there just to sit and try to see if he could feel her lingering presence. He never could.
“I don’t—” Dean gritted his teeth. The talking part was hard. “I never just wanted—that. I mean, don’t get me wrong, that part—that part’s great, but it’s you. It’s just you. It’s
, waiting for a hand to press down on his shoulder as he spat toothpaste into the sink. Waiting for life to start. It wasn’t fair to rush it. Cas had shit to do. Jack would be struggling, and Cas was the one who could be there for him. Guide him.
Castiel slips out of his “creepy” trench coat and adjusts his suit. Dean hadn't said anything about the suit.
“You can’t just show up after ten years and act like you didn’t do anything wrong!” Sam exclaimed, shaking out his hand. “And—talking in his ear and stringing him along.”
“Cas,” he said finally, talking at the ground. “I know I told you to fuck off. But...I hope you’re listening. I assume you are, you’ve never...never ignored my prayers when I needed you to listen. Well, I guess you have, but you always thought it was for my own good.”
. With his head lowered slightly, his dark blue eyes half-obscured by eyelashes and shadow, he looked—he looked almost like he had back when he was still
“Hey, Cas,” he breathed finally, the words slipping out of him so easily it was like he’d never stopped praying. “I hope you got your ears on."
Dean found himself shoving Cas with both hands. He wasn’t sure how they got to this point. They’d been arguing about...something. Something important, probably. It’s not like they just...argued about stupid shit all the time or anything. It was definitely something important, but at the moment, Dean wasn’t thinking so much as just
“Be right back,” he said, and pulled open the door. The hotel AC washed away and the dry desert heat buffeted his face as he stepped outside. It would get cold soon, once the sun dipped below the horizon and the warmth leached out of the air with no moisture to hold it there.
Dean lifted a hand and smoothed it over his cheek. He didn’t feel any different, although his knee didn’t have that horrible ache he’d started tuning out years ago.
“Why didn’t you come?” Dean asked. Even though his dream-self spoke calmly, much calmer than the racing thoughts in Dean’s mind, he cringed at the wounded, open vulnerability that he could feel creeping out of him.
So Dean shoved him again; the thud of Cas’s skull against the wall echoing in the pit of Dean’s stomach.
His life became confusing at that moment, when his empty heart suddenly was pierced by this stranger's green eyes. It took him six thousand visits to Biggerson's to find the man again, and has been to four thousand more moments in Biggerson's since then. He's kept a log of the visits, a fat notebook in his coat pocket, bulging with the records of Castiel's whole life's purpose. He did not know where he was when he first found the man, but he does know where he found the man the second time- but he doesn't know the
Sam sighed even heavier, and he tugged a sheet of paper out from between the pages of the spell book. His own writing covered the page, a mix of what looked like transcribed details and notes and suggestions of his own.
that he just had to do the bare minimum and he’d have someone in his bed that night. But the woman kept talking—she was an EMT, apparently—and he kept drinking, and smiling, and he was increasingly feeling like he might vomit.
“You know, Cas,” Dean said as he halfheartedly made his bed. Miracle would muss up the covers anyway. “Just because you’re on prayer speed-dial now doesn’t mean you can’t drop by a dream or two once in a while.”
The thin, gauzy layer holding Dean back from the dream split apart and he was really in his dream self, not swimming through his form like some indigent little creature. He was leaping to his feet, the fishing rod clattering as it hit the deck and rolled off into the lake. Cas frowned as it slipped away, but Dean didn’t turn to look.
“What is it you want to feel, Dean?” Cas said, and his hand slid from Dean’s hair to the side of his face, his palm brushing at his cheek. Dean leaned into it breathlessly, his head tipping towards the dry warmth.
It's a rare event, but every once in a while Castiel finds an urge to physically wander the Earth, feel the smooth flex of his tireless legs under him, watch the humans work to do the same. He finds himself in some sort of centralized civilization after a particularly long stretch of Biggerson's visits. There are small buildings all around him, strangling a flood of humanity in a small channel between shops. There is an abundance of women with small bags looped around their waist, dangling in front of their stomach paunches. There are children scampering- there's no other word for it- and a few tired looking business men are slouching to their cars.
“You’ll have to debrief me sometime,” Charlie said. “We’ll decide then if you need just an intervention or something more severe.”
man, and he's smiling hugely, and his eyes aren't the same as the pictures, they're better- they're a olive toned, bright green, much better than the grassy color they take on in the photographs.
“You been reading my mind?” Dean scoffed. Cas’s hand slid up slightly, pushed a little harder, his fingertips pushing gently on Dean’s throat, and Dean’s breath hitched.
,” Cas said, and he grabbed Dean and flipped him hard, leaving him panting into the mattress. “That was always your weak point, wasn’t it, Dean? Obeying?”
And the phone wouldn’t stop ringing. People were vanishing—not just Cas—but what was the point of caring? At best, Dean could offer a pitiful mimicry of grief if Sam was calling with bad news—
“No,” Dean said. “I don’t...let’s stop. I don’t want to think about it. This is heaven, right? We can just pretend the last ten years never happened. We should’ve died together that day, we can pretend we did.”
Castiel strides into the building she referred him to, finding a large desk in the middle of an entrance room.
The image of wide blue eyes in his head was as good as a hand gripping at Dean’s throat. He stared down at the counter, waiting for the feeling to pass.
They sat around talking about nothing for a while—some old knife Sam was restoring; some bullshit political news Dean didn’t particularly want to talk about but was at least a better topic than talking about himself. Dean was starting to think that maybe Sam was planning to spend the night; reprise his role as the resident of the room down the hall, but then Sam was sighing and shrugging on his jacket and walking out the door.
Dean toed off his shoes and dug into his duffel bag for his toothbrush, locking himself in the bathroom before Cas could say anything more. In the mirror above the soap scum sink, his cheeks were mottled red. It almost blended in with his sunburn—the blood in his cheeks. Thankfully.
Cas glanced at the pull-out couch, and back at Dean with a breathless, self-amused smile. “Go on,” he said, nodding at the stained, pathetic bed.
It was never very rational, Dean’s fear of Sam knowing the truth about him. The truth that sometimes he would lay in bed at night and imagine a version of himself that could be with a man without a wriggling feeling of guilt in the back of his mind. That he’d been imagining that for as long as he could remember. The fear was mostly in the way Sam’s eyes crinkled at the corners just like their father’s; the way sometimes when Sam was upset, the way he moved and the way his voice steadily raised was uncannily, exactly, undeniably like the way John acted when he was angry.
But he couldn’t not feel the tight panic that was working its way out of his chest and up his neck and clutching at his jaw and cheeks, standing in the middle of the bunker staring up at his brother.
“Can you at least put a blessing on her or something?” Dean asked frantically, earning him a sidelong glance from a nurse.
“I don’t have to,” Cas said. Dean’s hand drifted up of its own accord; curling around Cas’s wrist at his throat, and he realized his hands were shaking.
“Strike out?” the bartender asked. He plucked Dean’s empty glass away and paused there, his heavy black eyebrows raised.
“To deny yourself what you want?” Cas said, and he eased back again, and his hand released and slid lower until the dry pad of one of his fingers pressed at Dean’s hole. The heat, the friction, the pull—Dean’s hands tensed sweatily against the headboard.
“You don’t...want him back?” Charlie asked. “Did something happen? Or is this like a blaming-yourself-for-his-death situation and you think you deserve to live without your best friend, because it’s not just you that gets hurt by that, and—”
“Morning,” Dean said, nudging Benny with his shoulder where the man stood staring into the fridge. “You remembering how to be human?”
“Just go back to the bunker, please,” Charlie said. “You can’t just isolate yourself and drink yourself to death in freaking Nebraska.”
The call bleeped its end and Dean gritted his teeth as he dug the motel key out of his pocket. He opened the motel room door and grabbed his duffel where it was lying open next to the door. Maybe it was a good thing that he was always in the habit of never settling down when he was in this type of place, always keeping everything in a ready-to-go sort of set up.
Cas was sprawled across most of the bed, laid out on his stomach, holding a worn-out laminated brochure with a photo of a burger splashed across the front. His fingers of one hand braced the brochure open, the other hand busy propping his head up under his chin. His fingers played absently at the corner of the brochure where the lamination curled away from the paper and the soft, pulpy inside of the thick paper was torn, the paper split in two, pulled in both directions by the divided layers of lamination. His shirt was rucked up in the back; two dimples at the bottom of his spine standing out in the yellow motel room light; his spine a shadow carving up and under his shirt.
“I’m...human,” Cas said. He raised his arms slightly, gesturing at himself. “I, uh. I realized that Jack can probably handle things on his own.”
Castiel takes only a moment in each one that he visits, long enough to take a breath and a picture. It's something of an obsession of his, the only thing that he can think about anymore. He's careful- very careful, of course, as he has cultivated himself to be- and he has not yet been noticed. After twenty visits, he changes clothes, parts his hair differently, and begins to place himself in a new position during his visits. It's easiest to start in the broom cupboard: dark, private, and
He drove with some degree of a calm mind this time, actually looking where he was going properly and watching the miles slide by. But then he was in Kansas—and stopping at a diner for a while, to eat and just let the annoyance at himself marinate—and it was getting towards evening, and he was rapidly spiraling from tired and mildly frustrated to practically bursting at the seams. He was so stupid. What was he doing, sitting around with his thumb up his ass waiting for someone who pretended to love him but was perfectly happy to let him rot his life away?
Then teeth dug hard into the meat of Dean’s shoulder, sharp and unyielding, and Dean cried out as sparks flickered behind his eyelids and pleasure punched through him.
Sam and Eileen were already sitting at the table when Dean headed over with a small breakfast. Eileen smiled as he approached, but pressed a hand to Sam’s arm and left as soon as Dean settled into his chair.
He shook his head and yanked open the bathroom door, sticking his toothbrush back where it belonged. Cas followed his lead, disappearing into the bathroom silently, and Dean shucked off his layers, replaced his henley with a t-shirt and stared down at his legs, bare under his boxers.
The skin at the back of Dean’s neck prickled as he anticipated the conversation with the clerk. He didn’t like arguing with customer service folks. Give him the wrong type of fries, fine. Forget to split a check, whatever. They were busy people. But he couldn’t—he couldn’t sleep in that bed. It wasn’t even a king or a queen, it was barely a full. It didn’t even take up much of the room. The couch might as well be on the moon. And Cas was—Cas was all knees and elbows. Sharp. He probably was the type to thrash in his sleep. And that close, Dean wouldn’t—
“Hmm?” Dean said, lifting his head. Garth stood in the doorway with his hands on his hips, and Dean grinned. “Nothing. Thought I dropped something.”
Dean swallowed, frozen in the doorway, his limbs stiff. Cas practically looked naked, and he was still wearing almost an entire suit. As soon as he was barefoot, Cas looked up at Dean, his gaze quickly going from neutral to some warm, squinted...demeaning stare.
There was...there was planning. Sam did most of it. Always was the brains of the operation. Dean was nearly mute, words echoing in his head. Things he said. Things he didn’t say. Things Cas said. After all this time…
“He told me he loves me,” Dean said faintly. Charlie trailed off, and part of him thought, no way she heard that. It came out lighter than a breath, the first time he’d let himself say it. But she was staring at him with the wide, fallen face of someone who suddenly understood.
Cas started to reach for the couch; he stuck a hand into the gap between the cushions, and Dean found himself standing again. Cas paused, looking over at Dean again, his hand braced against the couch.
Someone brushed up against him and he turned his head just enough to see them. The woman’s curling brown hair was long enough to trail against the bartop and flirt at the bare skin at his elbow. There was a big gap beside him—three barstools unoccupied. Plenty of room to not come anywhere near him to get to the bar.
The experience is overwhelming for Castiel, and he feels disoriented. His suit is cut open from Dean's assault, but his skin is smooth underneath. He considers going back to the Biggerson's to check and make sure that Dean and Sam are alright. But he restrains himself, understanding that Dean seems to be afraid of him.
And Benny was quiet most of the time. Not overwhelming. Easy company. Sam had shifted awkwardly the first time he swung by the bunker and Dean had to tell him that Benny was back from the dead and human this time. Old tensions died hard, Dean figured. Even if Benny and Sam had mostly worked past the stiffness in the end, it wasn’t like running into an old friend with the two of them. But it didn’t matter, it wasn’t like Sam was living in the bunker anymore, and from the way he gave Dean an overly-serious half-smile as he left the bunker that day, Dean could tell his brother was relieved someone was around full-time.
“Cas,” he said as he shut the door to his bedroom behind him. “If you and Jack are hands-off, wanna tell me how Benny is back from the dead?”
Dean sighed in relief and prodded one of the heads with his toe. It slid away a little too easily, the ground beneath it soaked in blood.
Castiel knew that despite Dean's protests, he wanted the coat, because it was incredibly cold. The temperature didn't bother Castiel, but he could tell that for a human, it was too cold for comfort.
Cas pulled back slightly, and Dean felt himself lean forward, chasing after him for the hundredth time. His eyes snapped open, a flash of worry striking through him just at the feeling of Cas tugging away.
As Cas spoke in Dean’s mind, the image and feeling and smell and sound of every time they’d lost each other and found each other again rushed through Dean, carried like dust motes in the sunbeam that was Cas, and Dean sank to his knees at the feeling. Someday.
His lungs were starting to burn, and he breathed in deeply, dragging in air through some sort of barrier. He shifted his head and felt his skin move against something rough, some kind of fabric.
The door jingles and Castiel drops behind the counter, wondering why he feels hungry. He never feels hungry, only ever occasionally bored enough to eat. A tray full of ground beef, waiting to be cooked, beckons from the counter and Castiel slides it down to himself, quietly gorging himself. He ought to leave, of course, but he's so hungry...and curious. There are quiet footsteps behind Castiel, in the kitchen, and he hears several thumps and a gun's click before two of the suited men walk by, dragging a third men into the main area.
Sam nodded slowly, clearly not believing Dean, like now that he knew one more thing about Dean he was now an expert on all things Dean.
“Sure,” Dean said, already pulling out his wallet for the hand-written check she’d dropped on the table. Cas sat quietly as the waitress walked over to the counter and back with a styrofoam box in her hands, and as Dean handed her a few bills, folded over, definitely too much for the meal, and said “Keep the change.”
“No,” Dean said. He glanced over his shoulder towards the hallway Sam had gone down. He needed to tell Sam not to bother, not to worry over that when it was already fixed.
“Uh, a criminal?” the women says. “I saw the news this morning, that kid and his brother held up a bank and killed twenty people this morning.”
“The last time you insisted on sleeping on the floor, you complained about it for three days,” Cas said. His fingers curled around the hem of his hoodie—Dean hated the thing, it was this baggy, pilling blue monstrosity that Cas had seen at a Goodwill and had palmed with this slow, cautious warmth he’d never given to the jeans Dean had helped him pick out or the flannels Dean had lent him in those first days of Cas’s complete and utter humanity. His hands lingered at the hem of it now, his thumbs rubbing into the fabric absentmindedly as he surveyed the bed.
He finds it impossible to travel more than a few years at a time- he didn't realize the shortcoming at first, but after many small jumps forward, humans began to publish newspapers with the year noted on them, and realized that if he stretched himself he could only move two years forward or back at a time. He'd tried moving fifty years without any pauses once, and found that he required sleep at the end of the exertion. The only times he needs the strange unconsciousness is after long travels of time. He finds the limitation to be simple, scarcely a weakness at all. He does not care so much about traveling far in time- his true love was going to far away places, at least until he started the hunt.
“It won’t be,” Cas said, and he pinched the straw paper off his shirt and dropped it on the table before picking up his own straw, ripping it off, and blowing the rest at Dean. It flew through the air breezily, right over Dean’s shoulder, and Cas bit his lip. Dean swallowed, wanted to—
Dean tended to only have dreams late in the night, in the early hours of the morning just before he started to get restless and sleep only fitfully in small, light bursts before throwing himself out of bed. Usually, once he managed to sleep, it was just darkness and incoherent thoughts—ideas he thought he would remember tomorrow even if he didn’t write them down (but never did remember).
The young man sits him down in front of a screen similar to the TVs. Castiel vaguely understands computers- he recalls a time in the 90s that he stumbled into a strange lab full of people working at bulky contraptions called computers to perform tasks. This thing in front of him is much sleeker and smaller, similar to the laptops he's seen people using at Biggerson's, but hadn't made the connection between those and computers. He frowns, wondering if his assumption is correct.
Cas slowly leaned forward, one knee bracing onto the bed beside Dean’s waist, and he reached for Dean’s jaw, grasping it tightly in hand.
Cas reached under the couch cushion now and Dean ran a hand over his mouth. This was not going the way he’d—the way he’d pictured. Fine, sue him, he’d pictured it. Just—just being close, the brushing of arm against arm. Even Cas’s inevitably cold feet, icy even across the bed, icier when they’d accidentally touch Dean’s calves.
Thomas got up and reached for his shirt where it was crumpled on the ground. “Yeah,” he said. “I hope you figure it out some time, man. Life is short.”
Dean smiled. Benny almost looked...nervous, looking up at Dean’s slightly-manic grin. He didn’t know what he was in for.
“You freaked out when I—I said ‘Jesus Christ.’ I’ve been down that road before; guys who had a little too much Bible thumping in their youth to ever get out of their head.”
He did once arrive in a broom cupboard with one of the waitstaff, but fortunately they were snorting cocaine and didn't exactly feel inclined to tell anyone what they'd seen, or what they thought they'd seen. Once in a blue moon Castiel would arrive in a bathroom, always going for the first stall of the men's restroom- the one nobody ever used because a) nobody wants to use a Biggerson's toilet, and b) if worst came to worst and a man had to use a toilet, they'd use the last one just by psychological urge to be less ostentatious.
He couldn’t bear to—couldn’t write out anything else. Couldn’t explain. That wasn’t what he was good at, clearly. Saying what he needed to.
“This is—this is where you left,” Dean said, recognizing the room. “That’s where it—where it came for you.”
“Oh,” the librarian says, frowning deeply. “Well, I'm Sam...it was nice meeting you. It was interesting.”
And he slept, and ate, and watched shitty daytime television, and then he was back at Porky’s. Another glass in his hand. And then he was at the motel, alone again; another woman lured in and pushed away. What was
“We will,” Cas said, and Sam let out a choked laugh at the 'we' before going back down the hallway, his footsteps thumping loudly.
“Cas,” he said softly. His head turned slightly more; tipping up until he could see the angel’s face.
His system is flawed, of course. His obsession with this stranger combined with his desire to remain separated from humanity leaves him in a strange limbo- he does not simply want to snap pictures and leave, he wants to
“I was thinking of...things I want to do, that I don’t want to miss out on because of a stupid hunt,” Sam said. “Big things.”
Things were different, for Sam and Eileen. For the bunker. Dean wondered if it had ever housed an infant before. More than that, he wondered how long this would last. At what point did raising a child in a bunker go from ‘safe and affordable housing’ to ‘child endangerment and isolation?’
Dean gritted his teeth and yanked open the door to the dingy, ammonia-scented motel office. The clerk, a heavily pregnant red-headed woman with bags under her eyes, glanced up at him and straight back down to where she was carefully painting her nails a dark purple. Once Dean was close enough, he could smell that, too.
So he didn’t get to break the news to Cas. Big whoop. He’d have the pleasure of grinning wildly at Sam’s bitch face when Dean managed to blurt out the news to Garth, Jody, Donna,
Castiel suddenly feels full, and he pushes away the nearly empty tray. The movement makes a light screech, and Castiel knows that he should leave, in case any one there decides to look for the noise's source. But he doesn't.
Dean realized their faces were closer together than...than he really got with anyone. This was like, borderline
The drive was long, and by the time he was in the right state and the right town, staring up at the house they’d pinpointed as the next target, it was late afternoon. He slumped down in his seat and shut his eyes. Nobody from the bunker could catch up in time, even if they realized what Dean was going to do as soon as they woke up. If they drove pedal to the metal they’d get here a couple hours after it was already done.
Dean laughed, and Cas shushed him immediately. “Your aim’s been getting better lately, man, but that was something,” Dean said, shaking his head. He picked up his water and took a gulp—one thing Sam had been harping about, that Dean actually reluctantly would admit was reasonable, was that the both of them drank far too little water. He’d actually said
“Can we—” Dean’s voice came out hoarse, and he cleared his throat. He’d never seen Cas stare at him quite like this before. It wasn’t the salacious hunger he’d seen in 2014, or the cold curiosity or disdain from those early days, or the fondly inquisitive stare Dean had grown accustomed to. It was something else, and Dean’s chest was full with it, warm and dizzying.
The voices weren’t murmuring anymore; someone was yelling, someone was screaming. He couldn’t see; cloth was still wrapped over his eyes, and he pulled at it and tried to sit up, a rope digging into his stomach.
“If I’d realized,” Cas said, leaning closer, his other hand suddenly searing heat into Dean’s hip, “I could’ve saved you the difficulty of trying to argue with me
“What’s wrong with the spell?” Charlie asked. “There’s something you’re not telling us, isn’t there?”
But really talk. Ask him how he was supposed to keep going and pretending like he could make a life on Earth when the life he wanted was—elsewhere. Increasingly, he didn’t want to explain it to Sam. Didn’t want him to think that the longing Dean was always batting away was something to do with not wanting to live. It was hard to wrap his own mind around—the idea that when he finally was getting the kind of life he’d always wanted, completely ordinary and simple, he couldn’t help but want out because it wasn’t quite everything he wanted. And he wanted to tell Cas the same, but...
Cas squinted at him, and Dean was back to feeling the glass of the microscope slide, pinning him in place. Finally, Cas shrugged and took a bite of his meatloaf. As he chewed, a smile curled his mouth—one that he seemed to try to hide, looking out at the rest of the diner so he wasn’t facing Dean.
His dreams were empty that night. Maybe some of his thoughts had leaked through to Cas, some of what he couldn’t help but cry out within the confines of his own mind. Maybe Cas thought he needed space, when he needed anything but that. He needed something real, something tangible, something to hold and to live for.
Cas stood there stiffly, watching Dean heave for breath. He looked exactly like he had the day he died. Unchanged.
His tongue tasted like maraschino cherries, and Dean almost smiled into the kiss, imagining the bartender popping the bright red little things into his mouth as he worked. They stumbled towards the bed, and Dean felt the bed against the back of his knees before he was falling backwards and thumping down to the bed.
“That’s wasteful.” Cas took another sip and Dean looked up at the ceiling. It was water stained and yellowed, large rectangular, pockmarked white sheets.
“I look ridiculous,” Dean said. He was standing in front of a mirror, tugging at the cuffs of an overly-fancy suit. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been to a wedding. Had he ever been?
“I had to tell him, Dean!” Charlie said. “He noticed something was weird on his own, anyway, it’s not like you were subtle, always drifting off into corners to talk to yourself for a few years there.”
By the time they were back at the bunker, trying on the feeling of normal, Dean could feel the creeping feeling of something missing. Sure, there was a dog there now, and he could focus on hunts and cars and things that were simple, but...there was still a gaping space.
Dean’s mouth was dry. Sometimes, human Cas reminded him so much of the Cas he’d seen in the future. The Cas that didn’t care. The Cas that, if Dean wasn’t a total idiot (which was also possible), had all but invited Dean to join in an orgy with him. He’d given Dean this knowing smirk and said
Castiel blinked a few times at the offer and glanced over at Dean, who was practically swaying on his feet from exhaustion. He nodded, following them into the motel room and planting himself on the couch. Both of the Winchesters went to their respective beds almost immediately, Dean barely sparing time to kick off his shoes whereas Sam showered and changed into sweatpants first.
“Huh,” he said. His stomach turned. Cas. That bastard—did he really think that the solution to Dean’s anger was to give him the ten years back, make him relive it? Tack on an extra few years to his life span and see if Dean could figure it out this time around?
The last word was so low it was almost a growl, and an odd, high noise hitched out of Dean’s throat as he fisted his hands into the sheets above his head.
He fights the temptation to punch a wall, and instead moves to another Biggerson's, another time. He follows his instinct, hoping that some God would smile on him, guide him to the man.
He takes a few more steps and treads on something soft. Looking down, expecting to see a lost stuffed bear, he sees a human, their stomach bulging out. They seem with child, but in the wrong place- the bulge sticks out from below the person's ribs, and a raw onion with a bite taken out of it rolls from the person's grasp.  He sees an old man sitting in the center of the room, ringed by three men in suits. Castiel backs around the corner again.
“Harrond,” the bartender said. He grinned, his cheek dimpling under his scruff. “Want me to call you a cab?”
Dean’s feet stumbled into motion under him, chasing after Cas as he walked oh-so-casually through the bunker, towards the bedrooms. Dean’s own bedroom door hung open as he staggered into the hall after Cas, and when he reached the doorway he found Cas sitting at the edge of the bed, pulling off his shoes, his coat and jacket already draped over a chair.
He swung the impala into the gravel by the bunker forcefully, coming to a quick and hard stop. He clutched at the dark, furious fire burning in his chest. It was enough to keep himself going, he knew it was. He burst into the bunker, half-breathless just from keeping himself from coming apart at the seams as he barreled down the stairs.
“Fuck off,” Dean said. He forced himself to move and reached for Benny, grabbing him by his broad, heavy shoulders and pulling him back to him. He pulled with too much force, and he stumbled back, pulling Benny along with him until his back hit a wall. It was—it wasn’t quite—something wasn’t right, but something heavy and magnetic was sinking down in his chest, pulling at him, tugging, settling in.
Castiel arrives in an Indiana Biggerson's, only a few months' time after the last incident with Dean Winchester, and raises his notebook-heavy right hand as he walks to the main area to take a picture. As he snaps it he realizes that in the farthest corner of the restaurant, Dean is sitting, talking to Sam as he chews a mouthful of fries. Castiel backs slightly around the corner and snaps more photos, barely waiting for each picture's Polaroid to print before taking another.
Dean choked, the dry edges of the crust catching in his throat. “What?” he said, reaching for a glass of water. “What do you mean, me?”
The streetlights overhead clicked on as it turned to dusk, and Dean’s stomach growled. He was too nauseous to eat, maybe because he hadn’t eaten, maybe because he knew he was going to die.
Then Sam took a deep breath and his frown deepened slightly, and he punched Cas in the face with a guttural crunch.
“I can’t read your mind, Dean,” Cas said, and it felt as though a heavy, grey cloud pulled downwards at Dean, his stomach twisted, and he started to lean back, away from Cas—he couldn’t put it into words, Cas had to
“Around,” Dean said. He trooped down the stairs and gestured for Benny to follow him to the kitchen. “You drink beer now that you’re a real boy?”
“I’ve touched every cell in your body,” Cas said, running a hand along Dean’s ribs. “I stitched you together. And you’ve hidden yourself from me ever since. And for what?”
“You are,” he said, and his hands were back—trailing along Dean’s thighs, gradually growing firmer through the denim. “Do you know how it’s pained me to not be able to touch you?”
Dean watched him head for the garage. Part of him wanted to rush after him, tell him which ones were off limits, but it wasn’t like he’d ever drive them. He had the impala. They were nice cars; beautiful cars, tempting cars, cars he’d never driven but maybe would’ve liked to. But they weren’t the impala.
Cas smiled slightly. The sun wasn’t as bright as him; it sank into his skin and clung there like it didn’t know how to act around something like Cas.
Cas glanced over his shoulder at the wall. “It is,” he said. “I don’t know why...I needed to see that it was just a room, just a wall.”
Dean typed back. What kind of guy on a vacation with his girlfriend texted back his brother in thirty seconds?
And he leaned forward slightly, opening his mouth and pulling Cas’s thumb into his mouth with a slow, deliberate motion.
“Cas,” Dean said. He loosened his tie slightly, finding it hard to get a full breath of air. “Someday…”
“As much as I appreciate this whole—” Dean waved his hands indistinctly. “Whole...protective parent routine, I’m the one who gets to be mad, not you. And I am. And I also think I get to decide for myself whether or not I forgive Cas.”
Dean lunges for Castiel and drives a knife into his chest. Castiel startles, trying to yank away from Dean, but the man has his hand gripping Castiel's shoulder, holding him there. Castiel struggles, flinching away, and Dean stumbles backwards, shoved by Castiel's small movement.
"I'm not going to drop it, I told you, I'm curious!" Castiel exclaimed. "I don't understand why you won't tell me why you're angr-"
Dean blinked fast, staring up at the ceiling until Cas took a slow breath and his hand loosened slightly, and Dean’s gaze lowered to meet Cas’s again.
“Someone told me once that it’s creepy to watch people sleep,” Cas said sleepily, his eyes already closing again.
With a sigh Castiel shifts into a Biggerson's restaurant. Santa Fe, Denver, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Tucson, Lincoln, Reno, Bangor, Portland, Hartford, Medford, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Palm Bay flicked by, and he collects those images. He pauses in Palm Bay, labeling all twelve of those new photographs before he could forget. The man is not in any of them, of course- Castiel had been looking around each restaurant, so that if the man were there he could have taken more pictures, and taken a chance to really stare into the man's eyes, see if the photographs had exaggerated the grassy green of his eyes.
The guy sure hadn't been lying, it needed a ton of work. Normally information like this would have Dean rubbing his hands at the prospect of being paid to basically have fun.
Feeling the familiar buzz in his stomach, Dean took a moment to himself. The buzz was nothing new only the intensity was growing, he really wanted to kiss Cas aided somewhat by the man's (very tight) jeans. Moving again Dean entered the large bathroom, the floor was a black and white checkerboard tile with teal walls, surprisingly it worked.
"Is Charlie here today in an official capacity?" asked Sam looking around at the vast conference rooms of the Hotel.
"Oh, Dean, why are you knocking?" shrugging his shoulders Dean went through the door to find Baby's hood up. "She's fine Son." reassured his Dad, Dean nodded knowing that sometimes his Dad missed her, it was something they both shared.
Fuck, it was so good, the burger was succulent and cooked to perfection. Dam Ellen for not sharing her secrets. One day dammit he'd find out the truth behind this miracle.
"Hey! I did my throwing up before I went to sleep," protested Dean dipping a slice of bread in his egg before continuing, "Gabriel is just so cunning, like all the time."
"Right, so you had a good day?" asked Cas showing of that small cute smile has Dean breaking, because truthfully he wants this more than anything and he doesn't want to monitor himself every second.
"Okay, I'll bring something to cheer Cas up and a hug." Dean felt his heart tug and his eyes water a little.
Throughout this whole plan Dean had tried his hardest to avoid Cas as much as possible (no thanks to interfering friends and brothers) but being like this he realized how much he'd missed him.
“I was looking at Schools for engineering,” stated Dean talking mostly to the worktop, Charlie and Sam were the first to break out the encouragements.
Catching sight of the others Dean headed over to the picnic bench under a tree, passing a load of Firefly and Maniac (impressive, have you seen that show?) cosplayers.
Fuck! Gabriel knew, but Sam couldn't show this side of himself. Growing up he'd always had to be strong, to know when to shut up and not cry or face the wrath of his father.
Sam comes in just as their order is ready, walking over snagging his coffee before taking the nearest free table he finds. Dean follows sitting across from him, allowing a perfect view of the entrance.
"Can I grab another jello for Dean?" asked Cas motioning at Dean as if proof were needed he wasn't attempting to cheat the system.
Quickly taking a couple of snaps (Gabriel had taught him well) Cas headed to the bathroom, once finished he happily followed his nose to the kitchen remaining quiet so he could spy a little on Dean, currently busy turning the bacon over before placing the grill back.
"Kiss! What the hell Gabe, we're just friends." it was the truth apart from an ill-advised attempt of the classic friends with benefits arrangement: which had been disastrous.
He returned with a bag of donuts a while later to find Dean still asleep and still intertwined with Castiel, so he averted his gaze and dropped the bag on a small table, taking food for himself and sitting on the couch rather awkwardly.
The door creaked open, and Dean half-lifted his head enough to be sure it wasn’t a stranger creeping in while his guard was down. But it was just Cas, backing through the door with his duffle bag cradled in his arms like a bride. As he turned, lifting up the bag like he was about to toss it down on the nearest bed, he froze, his hands going tighter on the fabric of the bag, the skin at the edges of his fingers and fingernails bleaching pale.
Castiel has never lived a human life, but for the first time, as he stands in an inconsequential hotel room, he wants to. If he had been obsessed
Dean woke up, back screaming with stiffness, to the gray light of early morning. His mouth was chalky and dry, and he tried to conjure some spit to swallow.
“Do you think you deserve to be punished?” Cas asked, and his hand carded through Dean’s hair, palming up along the back of Dean’s scalp. Suddenly, his hand went tight, grabbing at Dean’s hair and pulling, hard enough that Dean’s head tipped back into the force, his neck stretching long as a gasp wrenched out of him. “Or is it...nostalgia? You just want to see me as I once was?”
Dean couldn’t say exactly what was different that let him get past the barstool for once. Maybe it didn’t feel as real; felt more like a strange and over-heated dream. But in the motel room, locking the door and turning, feeling the doorknob at his lower back, it felt very, very real.
. Dean picked up his burger and took as big of a bite as he could, almost gagging as he chewed. He couldn’t look at Cas right now. He wanted to ask if—if he meant what Dean thought he might. But maybe Cas was just being Cas, and he meant—the robe in the bunker, or something.
“Dean?” Cas said, and the bag relaxed, sinking down in a lower hold until Dean couldn’t even see his hands anymore. When Dean looked back up at Cas’s face, there was a soft frown on his forehead, just creasing the skin there. “There’s only one bed.”
Benny shook his head slow. “You’re roundin’ on fifty,” he said. “Could be a good time to do other things.”
“We don’t have to…” Thomas trailed off, fidgeting uncomfortably. He leaned back stiffly. “You know, you remind me of me.”
Sam’s eyes immediately darted over to Charlie, who was standing with a hand pressed over her mouth off slightly to the side. They held each other’s gaze for a second before Sam’s eyes dropped to the ground. Dean tried to catch Charlie’s gaze with a frown, but she looked innocently up towards the night sky.
he signed, wearily smiling and taking his toast on the move. She nodded to him, but her gaze quickly flickered to Sam with a soft sort of ‘what’s up with him’ written all over her.
“If you...if you loved me,” Dean said, his words coming out syrupy and heavy, from deep in his chest, filtering into the dream and drifting around him and Cas like low-hanging clouds. His throat was thick; he took a deep breath to steady his voice, a breath he knew he was taking in real life, in his bed, filling his lungs. “If you love me, why did you leave? How—how did you leave so easily?”
Dean tugged Cas towards the nearest table and sat him at it before retrieving a frozen bag of mystery leftovers from the freezer for his cheek. Cas held it to his face miserably, his eyes flicking up to where Sam and Charlie stood.
He tugged at Dean’s hair again, hard, downwards, and Dean’s knees faltered; at the pressure he was suddenly sinking, suddenly hitting the ground, kneeling at Cas’s feet, staring up at him.
Cas faced Dean. It was too much; Dean almost ached with it, but he couldn’t give it up, either. When Cas closed his eyes and shuffled around, settling into the mattress, Dean reluctantly let his own tired eyes finally slip closed. He counted his breaths. He tensed his arms and legs and toes; let them relax one by one.
Cas smiled doing his best to ignore the shivers up his spine and frenzied butterflies in his stomach. "Cas, I hope you hungry." greeted Dean.
"That's even better," smiled Sam sending him a wink, oh God forget being demure it was on, soon, hopefully, Gabriel would be climbing Sam like a tree. Only now it was raining on his parade as Gabriel suddenly spotted Dean heading over and Gabriel squashing the urge to grab Sam's hand to make a break for it.
"Yes, I know the Novaks, due to..." Charlie trailed off her eyes becoming wide much to the bated breath of both Sam and Dean. "Uh actually that's not important, why don't you guys head off and mingle and I'll meet you for lunch."
Beaten but not down, Dean waits for re-enforcements, luckily for him, Charlie is on her way. Only first he has to explain what's going on. Quickly placing his empty cup on a neighboring table (for appearance's sake) it was just in time too as Charlie came around the corner.
Cas had the sense he was being toyed with, on waking he found only his parents getting ready for work, Gabriel was oddly absent when normal practice was Cas having to be real inventive in getting him out of bed, he'd learned not to get too close after a hit to the face.
Cas couldn't tear his eyes away from Dean, the guy was in his element ever since they had gotten out of Baby and went through the doors of the Car show. His expression like a kid at Christmas, pure delight.
Cas returned to look out the window before continuing, "I love seeing you with Henry but at the same time, it hurts some, its sort of bittersweet. You're such a good father Dean."
His crush was already way out of control, if he believed this was Dean wouldn't he be setting himself up for more hurt. Cas shook his head hoping to rid himself of these thoughts knowing it wouldn't help in the long run, Gabriel would just tell him to shut up and enjoy it.
While they'd been together for a couple of months Sam didn't feel ready for the heavier stuff yet. Gabriel was always conscious of it, even making Sam slow down when he got carried away.
"Cool, so did you even come to School today?" asked Dean, his curiosity getting the better of him, it was obvious everyone tucking into breadsticks right now was in on today.
I decided to leave the bigger discussion and sexy times for the next chapter: Date Night. Since I haven't posted in ages I just want this to go up.
She watched them having a silent conversation once it appeared over she readied herself for whatever they were going to say only they didn’t, instead Gabriel approached the counter placing a white box atop of it, one she was all too familiar with already.
"Dean it's his birthday, besides I really care about Henry, about both of you." Dean was suddenly glad this was a phone conversation so there were no witnesses to his blushing.
Here is chapter 6, I really want to start posting more regularly only writing is hard and I'm really slow. Hope you enjoy.
"Yeah, these were her favorites," Dean broke into his easiest smile in days from the pure joy of remembering his Mom's favorite flower.
"Gabriel, this is Dean my boyfriend." said Cas taking over proceedings with an efficiency Dean found sexy, "Dean my older brother, Gabriel." with the man's attention off his candy and zeroing in on Dean he had the sudden feeling at being leered at.
"Nah, it's not all for us," Cas looked at him in confusion. "We're having an impromptu sleepover at La Casa Winchester, the regular crowd. Others will be in later no doubt, we're all bringing something." oh, it was times like this Cas hated his job, only then he felt bad for complaining.
"Yeah, he asked Gabriel for a clue, it got him baking," smiled Cas. "I was playing delivery boy, I hadn't realized how much Gabriel trusts Sam. It seems he did from the beginning."
"Uh, yeah," Cas' voice sounded weird like he was holding something back, Dean felt he didn't want to examine that too closely.
Once outside they mourned the loss of air-conditioning and were instantly hit by the high Sioux Falls sun, Cas had been smart enough to put some bottled water in the car, granted it would probably be warm but still wet at least.
"Hey, Gabriel invited me over for a food test," said Sam having explained his deal with Gabriel a few days ago. He didn't really know what to make of it but had definitely seen the changes in Sam, his brother was falling for the Novak baker.
"What and miss the show, come on I can't wait to see what he's got in store." frowning at his brother's antics Cas hurried after Bal to their first lesson.
Wow, Dean pulled back before moving again, this time he kissed Cas a little more intensely, he tasted so good and felt even better in Dean's arms.
“Can’t say I wasn’t curious about those chocolates but I figured it was Dean,”  Cas looked at her in surprise, “I have eyes Cas, the guy's a walking closet case luckily he found the way out. Truthfully and I don’t want to get all mushy but I missed you,” Meg avoided eye contact under the guise of gathering ingredients.
"That won't work okay, Gabriel he'll do things." things? what the... Oh My God, was he talking about sex things? No, no, no Dean was not having this conversation because, yuk.
"Cas, what the hell is going on?" he asks pushing the guy away, staying in the middle shielding Cas from view.
"Oh my God, it's not that you got rejected. It's that you actually like this girl, you want more than a quick fumble in the janitor's closet." put like that he sounded like a jerk, but he was always respectful. Sam was right though, he definitely wanted more than that with Cas.
"Dean, why are you sorry? We accepted Sam, why would you be any different ?" asks his Mom, her eyes filled with hurt.
Taking a breath Dean throws caution to the wind along with his towel chucking it on his laundry hamper. Stepping into the underwear is the first step and its fine quickly telling himself he's okay and he isn't doing anything wrong.
Sam was nervous, telling Dean about the bakery had always seemed so far away. Only it can't be avoided any longer, Cas' words of encouragement - the damn gardener was scary-  may have moved him along a little faster but there's another reason too.
Sammy jumped as he slammed his big book of plants that Cas had given him on the table, "You should have asked sooner." God, he had to fix everything around here. "Not flowers, plants because they grow, doesn't Gabriel like candy?"
Having enough of hanging back, Gabriel walked with zing (thank you gummy worms) in his step, new confidence born from his newfound secret keeping abilities towards Sam. It was important he didn't come across too strong, the purpose was to entice Sam not scare him off.
Since then Dean felt a little protective of him because he was shy and Dean was apparently extra in his big brother role. According to Sam, who pointed out that Cas had his own brother to look after him.
"My brother's arranged for us to go to the cinema," that was news to Dean, "Oh surprise, Dean," added Cas.
"Okay, let's find one." once through the automatic doors, it became evident the place was busy. Henry who was in front stayed close which Sam was thankful for, watching him it was obvious he was looking solely for the man who had become so important to him. Sam wished he was privy to their interaction the day of Henry's trip. "Henry, he may not be working today." he didn't want the boy's hopes to be dashed.
Whatever was happening he felt too old for. He was too much John Winchester' son for this. His son in a way that Sam never was.
“Fine, I’ll take a banana caramel muffin, a flapjack, a slice of pecan for Dean, a slice of honey and pear tart for Cas and whatever you’ll have,”
"Right pie's up everyone and hey Cas what did you say these were again?" he shouts scanning the garden for the man in question finding him stood next to Benny. They look cozy, standing close and smiling at each other.
"The other night?" queried Cas before understanding, "When we went to the movies? Nothing happened, it was fun." they had even enjoyed the movie which wasn't normally the case, their tastes were on opposite sides of the spectrum.
"Excellent, because plants can have some really weird names, here look." Henry pointed to the page showing the Chocolate Daisy. This time Sam's smile was exactly right.
"Yeah, Sammy's really keen to hear all about Alfie's date, I think he just needed some tlc," answered Gabriel.
"I hope it makes you feel better, I've had some ideas for the kids day." Henry smiled looking hopeful, which had Cas smiling since these were questions he could and wanted to answer.
“Charlie,” Dean said warningly. He adjusted his arms around Cas, who had one hand gripped to his cheek. “You didn’t…”
Castiel leaned down slightly and whispered something to Dean, finally waking him. Dean sat up slowly, drawing away from Castiel with a yawn. He rolled off the bed with a loud thump and stumbled over to the donuts. Castiel moved to sit at the end of the bed instead, and nobody said a word for a long time.
Dean could see the moment Cas felt the metal edge of the pull-out. His whole posture changed. Everything stiffened. He looked over at Dean again, his mouth parted around a half-spoken word.
Thomas’s fingers trailed at the sliver of skin between Dean’s shirt and the top of his pants, and Dean shivered, grasping at Thomas’s arms.
Cas reached towards the bag, and Dean let out another tense breath. Did he have anything weird in the bag that Cas could find and blame all this on? Probably. He probably had condoms in there, not that he’d found any occasions to use any in years. Probably expired. He could pretend to be embarrassed about that.
The first night back in the real world, Dean found that he couldn't sleep. It was strange, to be unable to sleep in a warm, safe bed in a motel away from monsters. After trying to sleep for an hour, Dean got out of bed and left the motel room, glancing at Sam, who was sleeping in the other bed.
Birds were chirping. The sun was warm across Dean’s face, and bright enough that the first thing he saw was the lurid red of his own eyelids. He let out a sigh. The grass he was lying on was the perfect texture, not scratchy or damp or slimy.
He forced himself to walk slowly as he made his way through the bunker, systematically peering into every room he passed. His stomach was starting to curl into knots; he took deep breaths through his nose, trying not to think too much.
Dean crossed his own arms, shifting his weight between his feet. All the times he’d idly imagined Cas returning to earth, he’d never pictured the reunion being taken up by an interrogation and an airing of all his dirty laundry.
Sam’s face went through the five stages of grief, and Dean bit his lip, fighting a smile. He probably oughtn’t to keep gaslighting Sammy and making him think he was either imagining things or make him think he was quickly losing his brother to complete insanity.
The first time Dean woke up to find himself curled up beneath the coat, he sighed and stood up with the coat, returning to Castiel wordlessly. The next time Dean had a chance to sleep, he would again insist that he didn't need the coat and end up waking up underneath it.
“What if he didn’t even mean it?” Dean said. “What if he just meant...friendly love? And I freaked him out?”
“Cas, can we stop with the third degree?” Dean sighed. They rounded the far corner to their room and Dean stuck the key in the lock and turned, letting them into the cool, cave-like space with a wave of that slightly moldy-smelling AC air.
“If something goes wrong, you’ll fix it, right?” he said the night of the birth. He’d said the same thing a million times, every time Eileen so much as sighed. And every time, Cas said the same thing.
“Supposed to?” Dean laughed. “Supposed to what? Obey heaven’s orders? Go find a wife? Pop out a few kids, retire and cook steaks on a grill in a Michigan backyard?”
He pushed himself away and walked to his bedroom. He pulled off his clothes—comfortable, simple stuff he was inclined to wear when he wasn’t even leaving the bunker for the day. He pulled on jeans, sighing at the way the button was only barely able to close. He didn’t particularly care how his body was shifting and changing in response to his home-cooked diet and the increasing infrequency of hunts, but it was a pain in the ass to go and find new clothes every few years instead of just sticking to the same stuff until holes wore through them.
Cas rose in a quick, fluid motion and stood in front of Dean. With Cas’s shoes off and Dean still in his boots, he had to look down slightly to Cas, but the stiff heat in his spine insistently said
“No,” Dean said. His fingers twitched at his side, and he dropped his hand from the gun at the small of his back.
“Your corpse was disgusting, by the way,” Claire said. Dean bit his lip. Even if she was fully an adult now, with all the years that had passed, sometimes she still made comments that made it feel like she was still a snarky teenager.
“Regardless,” Charlie said. “You can’t just drop the L-bomb and vanish into another dimension, never to be heard from again. That’s just bad etiquette.”
“It’s too much,” Cas said, his hand curving along Dean’s jaw. “You have to be in control all the time, don’t you? That much pressure on your shoulders? Is it enough to feel helpless? Or is it something else you want?”
entire families dying. It always left one of the kids. Every single one of the kids they’d tracked down so far had been too terrified and traumatized to even talk about what had happened to them. Or, maybe, Dean couldn’t help but wonder, the thing was doing something to the children and had left them alive for a reason. Something like what had happened to Sam, way back when.
Cas nodded. “I told Jack he has to visit often and update me on what he’s doing, to make sure he’s not ‘losing one of his marbles,’ as you might say.” Cas’s fingers quirked through air-quotes, and Dean's breath caught in his throat. “And I know it doesn’t count for much, after leaving for so long, but…”
Dean spun the nearly-empty beer bottle back and forth between his two palms. It wasn’t…it wasn’t completely unbelievable. But…
Before he could talk himself into a corner Cas grasped his face and pulled Dean back to him, coaxing Dean’s mouth open and making a small, satisfied whine into the kiss.
The monotony of thumbing through Biggerson's restaurants soothes the sense of fear growing in Castiel's subconscious. Seeing one after another, group after group of hideously obese Americans, makes him feel less and less panicked. After a solid six thousand visits, Castiel has filled an entire binder- he has thirty already that he keeps with his clothes, and he has to go and retrieve a new one from a store. He gets film yet again- he has to load up every hundred photos or so, get another five rolls.
Cas nodded and shifted again so he was sat on the edge of the bed, his legs off the side. He was always moving now—adjusting, fidgeting. Effortlessly human, but still a little overly aware of his body, his skin.
But they were on their feet again, fighting again—and Dean prodded at the strange feeling he’d gotten alongside the adrenaline surge as he’d stared up at certain death for the millionth time. The last vamp shoved and snarled at him as he tried to untangle the snarled burst of thoughts and emotions he’d felt. Fear—he wasn’t sure what it was that awaited him after death. Disappointment, maybe—he’d accepted the idea of normalcy, of living for a while and dying with years of plaque in his arteries. But also, something darker and meaner. Hope. Whatever came after life, it was somewhere away from Earth. Somewhere he could have what he’d always imagined alongside normalcy.
Cas was warm, and soft, and Dean couldn’t help but hold tighter, to make the split second of this one inimitable moment linger a moment longer.
“You remind me of me, like ten years ago,” Thomas said. “I was thirty, trying to pretend like I wasn’t going to end up just running the bar. Trying to pretend like I wanted to marry my fiancee even though I knew I didn’t love her. It’s poison, man.”
“Hey, Jack,” Dean said. His tongue was woolly and cumbersome, like he hadn’t spoken in days. Jack turned, his eyebrows raised, face placid. That was the other uncanny part. Jack felt like a puppet now, even if Dean knew it was nothing but Jack’s own power and knowledge tugging him along.
, Dean,” Cas said, shoving Dean hard enough that he stumbled back. He smacked against something hard, but the feeling of it was bright and pungent in his nerves, like cinnamon and cardamom and not like real pain. He glanced down and saw the shiny black surface of the impala holding him up.
Benny shrugged. “You’ve saved a lot of people already,” he said. “I’ve seen more hunters come through this place in a month than I’ve seen my whole life. You ever think about hanging it up, letting some of the younger ones do it?”
It wasn’t the first time he’d kissed a man, but he was pretty sure it was the first time he’d been practically sober for it. Every other time had been when he was so drunk that his vision blurred at the edges and he could almost forget that it wasn’t something he usually did. He was pretty sure he’d even had sex with a guy some time in his mid twenties, but he’d been nearly blacked out, everything all hazy and hard to distinguish from a dream. And he’d woken up alone. That was before he went and pulled Sam away from his college and his dreams, before he’d been thrown into life as
Dean sighed, his eyelids fluttering open. He rolled his eyes skyward. A new way to cook steak. That’s what he decided to bring up?
“It’s a big enough bed,” Cas said, and he shrugged, cracked his neck, and peeled off his sweatshirt. The t-shirt underneath—which Dean knew was his, even though it was a generic, dark green tee very obviously one of a million just like it, because his had vanished from the dryer weeks ago and never returned—dragged up along with the hoodie before finally slipping and falling back into place over exposed stomach. When the hoodie was finally off, Cas tossed it on top of his bag and cracked his neck the other way, lifting one hand to tilt his head enough for a triple
“Double, my ass,” he muttered, but sank down onto the end of the bed anyway, his eyes gritty and warm with hours of driving sunk into them. He groaned, leaning back until his muscles gave way and he flopped onto his back on the mattress. That damn clerk. The credit card sure as hell would register this room as a double even if they’d most definitely given him a single. And, alright, it wasn’t like they ever paid off their cards with their own hard-earned money, but it was the principle of the thing.
“I’ve tried, Cas,” he said hoarsely. “I know you wanted me to just live like I wasn’t waiting for something, but I can’t forget that I am. It’s all I think about. It’s all I’ve got. No matter who I find here, no matter what happens, even if someday I...get my head out of my ass and can at least get somewhere close to what you want for me...nothing’s gonna change, Cas.
“We’re not going to be able to just forget the last ten years,” Charlie said. Dean shot her a glance, and she shrugged. “It’s been hard, watching you try and fail to move on. Sam and I—”
He's holding out his hand like an idiot, words still failing him. He can feel Henry poking his leg, a second later everything's back, quick as hitting a switch. He smiles before attempting to speak. "I'm Dean Winchester, Mr Bumble I presume." the man smiles at him causing his eyes to twinkle, the sight causes a sort of flood to flow through his body. He has no idea what it means, only it suddenly feels like he's standing on a precipice. A reward waiting for him, if he's brave enough to fall.
"Jeez Cas chill," joked Meg "Don't you dare move, let him come to you, Gabriel knows to lock the door."
Yeah, Dean was definitely heading to the kitchen if that was going to be in his line of sight, he was meant to be keeping his stomach. Jerking his head at Cas he passed Charlie the controller as they snuck away, Dean was happy to find Sam had brewed a whole pot of coffee rather than just one cup.
Waiting until Cas' eyes were shut, giving an extra few seconds to make sure, Dean pulled a key from his pocket (it was big, heavy and very uncomfortable) to quickly unlock the gate.
"He was abusive, physically and emotionally sometimes he didn't even need the drink to be like that. It got worse when he found out about me, I don't even know how he found out, sometimes I think he just sensed it. For John Winchester having a gay son was the worst thing to ever happen to him second to losing his wife."
"Oh Dean, he did actually but the only charms my brother is interested in are yours. Cassie is a real catch, he won't be available forever. That's my piece said for the moment, now continue."
"I didn't mean that, you know what never mind." Dean wasn't going to fall for that backtrack, he'd be having a conversation with Gabriel later. "Anyway I'm sure Dad would love to see everything Dean, he's in the garage." Oh, that was a little much or too soon perhaps both not that he was trying to avoid his Dad he just felt like he was letting him down which was stupid.
"Wow Dean, that was quite the welcome, I'd think being away for half a year would at least qualify for a hug." she scolded.
"No!" declares Dean it takes more than a little redhead to scare him and he's sticking by it. Moving to follow her she puts her hand out for the books unnecessarily oohing and aahing over them.
"Hey Cas," he greets holding his hand out for the cooler feeling glad when Cas accepts the help, Ellen would have a fit to see a guest lifting anything other than drink or food. "What did you guys bring?" he asks holding the door open for them making sure to take Kevin's small load too.
"I'll remember that the next time you want some pie." Dean jokes as Henry looks at him in horror, Henry's love for pie is as strong as his father's. "Can I drop you guys off somewhere?" he asks as they head outside.
"Then you should go for it, I haven't met the guy hell I've got second and third-hand information from two gossips but I think this could be good for you." Bobby gives him a smile finally taking a slice for himself.
"I heard the Impala, Daddy's coming back isn't he?" he watches something flash in his Uncle's eyes before he closes them taking a breath.
After rubbing his neck and deciding on what he wanted to say Dean began talking fearing he'd been silent and lost in his head to too long. "Yeah, I had the idea to redo the front garden at home, it's basically a load of weeds currently. Henry really loves Hive and I want to encourage that, he seemed taken with the idea this morning." after their little chat Dean was even more keen to move forward with the idea. Wanting to reassure Henry that his interests were okay and not something he had to hide or change for anybody. He would not make the same mistakes as John.
"Keep telling yourself that Dean, like you ever go inside such an establishment." a giggle comes from Henry, causing Dean to look at his son in mock annoyance.
"Which one's he?" at Cas' question several things happened: Charlie made some weird animal noise, there was an audible groan from the others except Kevin and even Dean couldn't stop his eyebrows meeting his hairline. Cas didn't know Star Wars. "Did I say something wrong?"
"It's coming along," replied Benny all smirk, yeah he knew exactly what he was doing. "Well until we meet again, Cas."
"Talk about oblivious," muttered Gabriel under his breath just loud enough for everyone to here, luckily Sam pulled him down to the sofa his hand over his mouth.
"Um, no after your last gift, which is so pretty, I wanted to give something back to you. Luckily Gabriel helped and Mary was more than happy to allow me to take over the kitchen." smiled Cas.
"Dude, give me some credit, I didn't tell him it was yours until he started blowing up my phone. And another thing I'm rooming with him and last night he arrived completely smitten, rambling about a stunning guy with green eyes he'd been lucky enough to sit next to," she smirked her enjoyment clear.
"Bacon," said Sam shit-eating grin in full display as he showed Dean the relevant tab, a color picture of little sausages wrapped in bacon cooked to perfection, “Oh and dessert is usually pie,”
The secret Santa gift could be fancy candy, the other, oh wait, could he perhaps take Gabriel at his word and get something sexy. Once this tree was decorated Sam had more research to do.
Hours later Dean is finally done, coming through the shop Dean finds Cas and Henry where, until now he had avoided: The home of gnomes and fairy statues. He couldn't fault the display it was a little off to the side in the corner stood a teardrop chair big enough for two (currently occupied by Cas and Henry); decorated with fairy lights and the aforementioned statues.
"It's silly," he says in an attempt to brush it off only to be met with Dean's glare. "Fine, I suffer a little from anxiety. Places like this are hard for me, along with meeting new people." Dean can't help but raise his eyebrows, having witnessed Cas so confident and graceful this new information seems oddly at war with the man in front of him. Taking a while to think about it some more has him coming to the conclusion that those were Cas places, his domain.
"Oh, we are?" teased Dean, Cas nodded reaching to take Dean's hand, smiling Dean said, "I suppose I should give you my final gift,"
Sam's wish came to fruition the following day. Being Dean's day off he was predictably under Baby's hood when it happened.
A moan came out of Dean on the first taste, what the hell had Cas put in this pie! The apples were soft and spiced to perfection, the pastry was flaky and sweet.
And Cas, that lying little terror! He'd looked Dean straight in the eye and told him his brother was some weird health freak who owned a salad bar. Dean would be having words with him later.
"It's my day off so I always have a cooked breakfast." Cas stops his chopping coming around the worktop until he's right in front of Dean. "I learned how to cook to provide my brother with food other than sugar, it was born out of necessity. I'm not inventive like you Dean, I know how much you love it because your flair is unmistakable."
"Take one and say thank you," he tells him making Henry freeze as if Dean doesn't know all of his tricks.
"I should be strong, a friend said I was too big to be a bottom, that I would be depriving real bottoms of my endowment," embarrassed Sam coved his face with his hand,  he'd never told that to anyone, the guy in question quickly became an ex-friend.
"You wound me Cas," Dean laughed feeling happy and light, Cas always made him feel good, "Look I've got to get to work, talk later?"
"All relationships come with risk, Dean. The secret is communication, you guys just need to talk to each other,"
"I'm sorry Dean, that couldn't have been easy, but Henry's such a happy curious little boy. You should be proud." Cas' eyes never look away as if to make sure Dean knows he's speaking the truth.
Weight falling on the bed pulled Sam from his memories as Gabriel lay down next to him, though nervous Sam immediately moved closer until Gabriel wrapped his arm around him pulling closer.
He hadn't contacted Gabriel, wanting to leave him to his dreams. Simply knowing he would be there in an instant was enough for now and something he would get chewed out over. His brother had always been there for him whether wading through the social waters of high school or just being his normal exasperating self.
"You head that way and I'll take the library if we don't find anything we'll meet at the bottom of the stairs."
"He's not hard work Gabriel, he's lovely. Don't talk about him like that." Dean was special, hell he made the time to befriend Cas.
“I know, but it was a pivotal moment in your own life too,” she reasons. “So, you guys re-connecting on a bench parallels the first time you connected on Earth on one."
“Don’t worry, dork. I lived to eighty-three,” she interrupts. “But the grey hair didn’t really suit me, and it looks like heaven agrees.”
“You spent your whole life when John was alive trying to please your father. I don’t want your afterlife to be spent doing the same.”
“Cas summoned the Empty by telling me he loved me,” Dean says, and there’s that twist of his heart again. His hand instinctually goes to grip his shoulder, even though there’s no hand bracing him or no longer print left behind there. He winces at the weight of the absence, staring back out at the lake. “The Empty said it would take him when he finally let himself be happy. I guess telling me that was all that it took.”
“I believe he’s trying to give you space,” Jack says to them, but he looks at Dean directly while he says it.
“Everyone in my life that I love is going to be at the Roadhouse. Well, Ketch, I just tolerate, but everyone else I love,” he says and puts a hand on Cas’s cheek. “But even with all those people, that room would feel pretty damn empty without you in it.”
He thinks of the word home and looks around him. He thought this exact spot would be his home, at a house that his parents both share. But Dean realizes the definition of the word has shifted in meaning over the years.
That fact that Cas built Dean back together piece by piece still scares him sometimes. How could Cas look at his craftsmen ship when he was done and not want to tear his work apart with his bare hands?
“If you lost your way a little on earth. Fine,” John sighs, rubbing at his forehead. “But you can have any girl you want here.”
“They’re so green, like trees that stand tall in the woods. Making me feel a little lost, but also making me feel like you could circle them forever and be content,” Cas explains, smiling softly at him. “Your love for humanity. Your grumpiness in the morning. Your ugly flannels.”
Cas feels like there’s a joke he’s not in on, which is becoming a running theme. Jack has so much knowledge with his new cosmic abilities that Cas will never be able to comprehend.
“But what I can say now is that we’ll figure it out—whatever thing is getting in the way of you seeing me, we’ll work through it. Because, what’s the alternative, spending eternity avoiding each other? That ain’t going to work. Not being in each other’s lives has never worked. We’ve always found a way back to one another. So, we can do it one last time.” Dean slowly opens his eyes, looking out at the water. The sun’s just setting, creating a bright flash as it meets the horizon. “I believe in us, Cas. Do you?”
“Nothing, nothing,” Sam says, biting back a smile. “It’s just, out of all the times I imagined of this conversation happening, I never pictured it going down when we’re both dead.”
“So, you guys just living happily ever after now?” Jack asks, looking pleased with the return of events he probably saw coming.
Or, Cas thinks, perhaps Dean’s realized that emotion was misplaced, finding something better to aim that look at than himself.
Jo watches him suspiciously, and Dean doesn’t back down, his arms crossed over his chest and eyes begging her to leave.
Dean doesn’t want to waste what little time he has left with Jack before he has to go and do his godly duties. So, Dean steps forward, holding Jack’s shoulder firmly.
“It was really awkward at first, but Cas is very different than the one I knew. He apologized and seemed so sincere and full of life in a way he wasn’t before. It was hard not to forgive him.”
But Cas can't stop thinking about the emotion in Dean’s eyes that he couldn’t place at the time. He wonders if it’s still there or if the light has blown out.
He starts to pick at the wrapper on the bottle, unable to make his fingers stay still. There’s a restlessness about him that he can’t seem to shake. It’s been there ever since he watched Cas get covered in that black goo.
“What do you mean?" Dean asks, his brows furrowing. "This is heaven, isn’t it sort of an angel’s hometown.”
Cas lowers his head, his mouth brushing against Dean’s gently, as if Dean’s something priceless he’s afraid of breaking. Dean deepens the kiss, making it clear that Cas can break him in any way he wants. It makes Cas think that being broken isn’t actually a bad thing like he once thought.
“No,” Dean says, embarrassed at how pathetic he manages to sound saying one syllable. “What the hell is his problem?”
The lake house isn’t big and grandiose enough to make him feel uncomfortable. But it’s also not too small to make him feel cramped or remind him of one of those musty motel rooms.
Dean claps his hand on Cas’s back. “Alright, Mr. Chrysler Building, you should at least eat something before you get all smitey.”
They’re at a pizza place in town called “Little Slice of Heaven” that serves you any kind of pizza you want. Dean went for just a normal pepperoni, but it ended up tasting like the one he ate at a great pizza parlor in Colorado that he could never manage to find again.
“Making a list of why I love you,” Cas says, his thumb outlining Dean’s chin, studying the contours of his face. “We have eternity. I could go on and on.”
It’s very strange having angels who once regarded him as an enemy come to him for instructions. Jack put him in charge once he rescued him from the Empty. While Cas tried dissuading him of the idea, Jack had put his foot down. He reasoned that Cas was the only angel who really understood what it meant to love humans, and therefore, could make the angels understand how to as well. It took a bit of time, but the angels who were left came around, especially when they saw the results he and Jack brought to heaven.
He doesn’t—he can’t. He doesn’t want to see pity in them. But Dean grabs his shoulders, forcing him to turn around and meet his eyes.
“Now that that’s done with,” Balthazar starts to say, and Cas prepares himself when he notices there’s a dangerous glint in his brother’s eyes. “I heard the man in the leather jacket who’s in love with you is looking for you.”
It feels like the lapping of waves, the water gentle by the time it arrives at the shoreline but determined as it makes a mark on the sand, letting it know that it will always return.
Cas lets go of John’s hand, but his stare is unrelenting on him as he says, “I don’t need to eat food.”
Dean takes a few moments, unfurling his fists on the table, taking measured breaths to calm himself.
“It’s so good to see you,” Cas takes a step forward instinctually but flinches back a step. “But probably not too good to see me…Samandriel, I’m so sorry.”
Cas looks at her and thinks that she looks just the same as he last saw her. Jean jacket, wild blonde curls, and eyes that could melt your heart or chill your blood depending on her mood.
“Cas, ever since you pulled me out of hell, my life has just been more,” Dean states concretely. “You made me want something more out of my life than just living to die for someone else. When I started to think about what that more was, it always came back to you. You were the more I wanted—the more that I still want.”
“I don’t think giving him hell is in the cards here, but no, I didn’t,” Mary smiles. “I trust him. He looked after you when you guys had no one else.”
Cas nods, and Jack leads them towards their chairs. They sit down, getting back to the business they left off on before the interruption of Dean’s entrance into heaven.
“You think when he’s in my body, he wears it better,” Jimmy asserts, crossing his arms with a smug smile. “Don’t you?”
“Cas is here, somewhere,” Sam says, his lips forming a hopeful smile that Dean cannot echo. “You can tell him.”
“I didn’t deserve any of that shit you put on me,” Dean mutters after a while, meeting his father’s confused eyes. “I don’t regret taking care of Sammy, but you shouldn’t have felt like it’s all that gave me worth. For my birthdays, you gave me a gun or sent me on a hunt.”
They go back into the house, and Mary stops him from leaving the kitchen once they’re done doing dishes.
“I’m not that guy he described,” Dean cuts Charlie off. “I’m not worth all the love he gave me. He deserves better.”
“I’d like to hear more about the begging Dean probably did,” Claire starts to say from a booth in the corner, smirking. “But it’s your deathday, so I’ll cut you some slack.”
“Yeah,” Dean answers, resting his forehead on Cas's, his breath coming to him easier than it ever has before. “I am.”
“It’s a bit unfair. You got to beat up my neglectful father,” Cas points out, sounding a bit childish.
Dean hands gripping the back of Cas’s head, pulling him closer. “You’re friggin irresistible messy hair. Your raggedy coat. Your kindness, your smile, your voice.” Dean’s face hovers close to Cas's, his lips mere inches away from his as he whispers, “You.”
“What am I supposed to do with all the feelings I have left for him?” Dean mumbles under his breath. “Because if I let myself think about him, it’s a pain worse than I’ve felt on any hunt that’s gone south.”
“We’re not getting older anymore, so there’s no point in celebrating birthdays,” Dean explains. “We thought we’d celebrate death days, to celebrate another year in paradise.”
Claire gives him a kind smile, and despite everything, it makes him smile too. Maybe that means something. Or maybe, it’s just an effect Claire has on him.
Kelly shakes her head, leading him around a curve. She walks them towards the section of the garden dedicated to sunflowers.
As he finishes the burgers, Mary comes out to say hello to them and help set the picnic table outside. No one mentions John or the lack of him, but his presence is heavy once he finally makes an appearance.
Dean could finally be free in heaven, really free. To be with the people he cares for without spending every ounce of his being trying to protect them.
He turns, seeing Cas standing behind the bench. There’s a small smile on his face, and his hands fidget awkwardly into his trench coat pockets.
“Alright,” Cas nods, looking a bit befuddled by the prospect but understanding it all the same. “I’ll come if you want me there.”
“No,” Cas finally answers Jack, forcing his eyes open. “He should have time to adjust. He doesn’t want to see me yet.”
“Yeah, but it’s not the same,” Dean says, pulling Jack in for a hug of his own once Sam lets go of him. “It’s good to see you, buddy.”
But silence is starting to be a dangerous thing. When all is quiet, Cas feels a sting of longing. Except it’s different from his own—it’s a longing which is projected onto him. It’s paired with the sound of Dean’s voice, which is reaching out to him in prayer.
Dean refrains from rolling his eyes at the lack of enthusiasm. He takes a step back, lowering his head with closed eyes.
“So, in a sense, them being afraid of losing the sun’s light actually makes them get less of it,” Kelly states, picking a petal from one of the sunflowers. “And they’re moving back and forth when they’re already in the place they should be.”
He doesn’t like the look in his father’s eyes. The look that conveys the statement isn’t a question but a command.
“Jack, what you’ve done for us, what you’ve done for humanity, rebuilding heaven... you’ve done good,” Dean tells him.
He watches as Cas’s eyes remain trained on their hands as if trying to tell if this is some sort of illusion. Dean squeezes his palm, causing Cas to look back up at him with a searching expression.
She walks towards him and then pulls him into a hug. Cas stands still for a moment before hugging her back.
“I almost forgot my—Cas!” Jo exclaims, blinking in surprise at Cas, who’s now standing in the living room. “Well, not my Cas. I guess, your Cas,” she stutters, turning towards Dean and then wincing. “I mean, he’s an independent man or man-angel. He doesn’t belong to anybody. Although, that hickey says otherwise.”
“Me too,” Dean nods but looks around, breathing in the clean air and somehow feeling the sunlight hitting his face despite the sun already disappearing behind the skyline. “But it’s nice here.”
“I ain’t no writer,” Dean says in distaste, thinking of Chuck. “We got held up at the house, and on the drive over here, we were listening to a mixtape and wanted to get to the end of it.”
Dean rubs at his eyes, feeling the sting of something wet there that burns. “The avoiding me and ignoring my prayers—is it because all that stuff you said before the Empty took you isn’t true anymore?”
“You look,” Dean stands up, his words drifting as he scans him, an affectionate smile etching on his face. “Wow.”
“I know,” Cas commiserates, playing along with Jo, a smile hinting at his face. “He didn’t even open the door for me when I came here.”
“Actually, I think I’ll stick around here,” Balthazar answers, taking a pretzel from the display case. His coat sways a little as he moves. There’s no wind, so he’s probably making it do it himself, for the pure dramatics of it. “The new angels you’ve created need to be whipped into shape.”
Jack’s eyes hold nothing but love, and he looks at Dean like he always wished his father would look at him.
He feels like he’s falling to Earth for a second time, his wings getting torn to shreds as he sinks through the air.
Dean sits on his front porch with a beer in his hands. Despite the weather, the drink doesn’t warm. Droplets of condensation still fester on the bottle. He supposes it’s a perk of the whole heaven thing—that everything here is just as it should be.
He takes a step towards Jimmy after looking around to make sure no one else hears how pathetic he’s about to sound.
“Yeah, Dean, I’m a guest,” she repeats, crossing her arms proudly. “You should offer me something to drink.”
“Maybe it’s not about needing him to hear you, but letting yourself feel it,” Sam says. “I mean, how can you tell him something you’re too scared to even think about?”
Cas tries refocusing on the discussion at hand. When he does, he realizes that Jack is no longer talking. He’s frowning, looking off into the distance. Cas guesses that Jack’s trying to focus on one image out of the millions he sees at once.
Dean seems to feel the same, his hands gripping his hip and pulling his body flush against his. Cas’s breath hitches, and his hands fumble underneath Dean’s shirt.
“How long have you felt this way?” Cas asks. “You said you’ve wanted to tell me before that night, years before.”
“I saved a lot of people, made some mistakes—a lot, but also has Jody and my family to lean on at the end of the day,” Claire answers, looking more relaxed than he’s ever seen her. “I ended up becoming a social worker while still hunting on the side, of course.”
Cas’s hand on Dean’s shoulder was like a pen hitting a page, marking the beginning of something, not an end.
“He used to," Dean mutters. "But Maybe he finally wised up, got a new number that I can’t reach him at."
Dean eventually catches up with him and grabs him by the shoulders. Cas jumps in surprise, making his earbuds fall out of his ears. Dean frowns in confusion at the earbuds which land on the sidewalk.
Dean doesn't think he's ever moved faster in his life than he does at that moment. He jolts up, pulling Cas towards him.
“Oh yes,” Cas starts to say, stepping next to Dean, giving John that smile that’s not a smile at all. The one dean’s seen him use before telling off an enemy and ripping them to shreds. “I’ve read as much through your journal.”
He’s in no way making apologies for that man. But, he does feel pity for him. John lives not comprehending who Dean entirely is because he’s stuck seeing him as the kid who carried his brother out of that burning house.
“That was before I knew you were off gallivanting with Cas without even considering telling me about it!”
“You know what? I don’t blame him,” Dean says, kicking the leg of the table. “Not after all the shit that I’ve put him through. Not after years of not making sure he knew how much I cared. Not after he died in front of me with a fucking smile on his face, and I just stood there like an asshole.”
“Something I’ve learned about you is that you often think the right thing involves taking yourself out of the picture,” Claire says. “But too bad, all these humans care about you now, so you’ve got to deal with being in the picture.”
“Because you wanted to understand. I don’t know if he does, but I think he’s trying to want to if that makes sense.”
When he’s feeling social, he can even head to the Roadhouse. It’s within a few minutes of his place, and he can have a drink with Ellen or Jo or any of the family he’s made along the way.
Cas frowns as his thoughts turn to the eldest Winchester, as they often do. He shakes his head, trying to banish the last memory he has of Dean from his mind.
“I’m great, thanks to you,” Bobby says. He then sits up, turning towards Cas seriously. “You know, I saw Sam and Dean as my own, and I was thankful when you came along. They deserved someone to look out for them, and you deserved people to look out for you.”
Cas fidgets in front of the mirror, rolling up the sleeves of the blue flannel. He’s wearing a pair of jeans for the first time since he was human, and the material scratches his skin awkwardly.
“I know this probably doesn’t mean anything to you,” Dean begins to say, the corner of his lips uncontrollably tugging upwards. “But I know when you said yes, it definitely did some good for me.”
“I already told you, I don’t need your blessing,” Dean says thinly. “You got to understand that. I’m my own person. I don’t have to do what you say.”
Everything around them goes silent. Dean swears that whatever loop sounds Jack has going to create, heaven’s ambiance starts malfunctioning, as he can only hear a ringing in his ears.
“I didn’t want it to be perfect. Humans spend their entire lives striving for it, but it’s often hollow. You take so much away to gain it,” Cas reasons. “Imperfection feels much more real. There is a genuine beauty in it, appreciating something with all its complications and flaws. Imperfection gives life meaning and worth.”
Cas keeps the petal in his palm, wondering if he has the strength to make his own roots. And if he does stay put, would the waiting he’s done through many moons finally earn him a steady sun?
Jimmy turns his head up to the sky. “How did anyone here put up with you Winchester’s?” he asks in pure bafflement. “I honestly don’t get the appeal, even after Claire explained it to me.”
“When he stops the car, he’ll be reunited with Sam, as if only hours had passed instead of fifty years.” Jack turns to Cas, and there's a hopeful glint in his eyes. “But you could fly over and make him take a detour.”
In heaven, he thought he wouldn’t feel the panic like this—the kind that creates knots in his stomach and tightens his throat, making it harder to breathe.
When Dean closed his eyes and took his last breath, he was standing in heaven without the ache in his back. But those unsaid words didn’t vanish like the wound from the rebar. Instead, it was like heaven re-lit the flame, making the words burn even more brightly than before.
He frowns at Cas, looking more like the Jack he knows—a little bit lost and a little too much heart to be contained in his body.
“Yes, but not for the reasons you’re probably thinking. It informed me on how bad of a father you are, maybe even worse than mine—which is saying something.”
“Maybe it’s best we didn’t. It would’ve been far too distracting. We might’ve slipped up trying to save the world one of the many times we had to.”
Dean grins, and never—not even after they killed Chuck or when he came to heaven, has he ever felt so free.
Dean’s in the kitchen, just finishing making a sandwich. He knows he could get one instantly with the snap of his fingers, but he has the time—an infinite amount of it, in fact, so he tries his best to fill it.
Dean goes to the lake a few yards from his house but forgoes bringing his fishing pole. He sits on a bench a few feet away from the water.
They all looked at him like something broken that came off the production line flawed, beyond fixing.
Angels don’t need to nap or eat cereal, but Jack says the office shouldn't only be a place where business gets done. It’s also a home base for the angels. They can gather here and work as a team, developing ways to serve humanity in heaven and Earth.
But Dean also knows that Cas isn’t one to skip out on doing the work. After all, he put Dean’s body back together himself after getting him out of hell.
“You’re a part of my family too,” Bobby insists firmly. Cas opens his mouth to give his gratitude, but Bobby continues, “Which is why I feel like I can tell you that you’re an idjit.”
That one person is the same son of a bitch Dean can’t manage to reach, despite every prayer and every thought he’s aimed towards the guy over the past week.
He sees Ash, Ellen, and Jo when he visits the Roadhouse. Ellen never lets him leave without eating something, saying he spent too much of his life not enjoying food, and now that he can taste in the new heaven, he has to start making up for it.
Dean abruptly pushes off everything on the counter in one fell swoop, sending food and utensils crashing onto the floor.
“I honestly can’t think of anything that’s not in this vicinity,” he says, pointing at Cas below him.
“He didn’t have to tell us. I talked to Dean on earth once,” Samandriel says. “I could tell that he loves you deeply.”
Cas sighs. “I thought you wouldn’t want to see me after how we left things. When I said all of that, I never expected to see you again. But now, with both of us in heaven, I didn’t know where we stood.”
When Dean looks up at him, there’s a desperation in his eyes, something so fragile, as if his whole being could shatter within seconds.
“It’s not so much about the forgiveness as it is about the understanding. Even though Sam pissed him off, he got him. I don’t think he ever really got me, not really.”
“I couldn’t face things changing, of ruining what we had because I felt something you could never feel.”
Dean grounds his jaw, his fingers digging against the wrapper of his beer, which is in shreds at this point.
“Look, I don’t know how to phrase things as well as you...but you’re it, man,” Dean says resolutely, his eyes glowing with something Cas can now clearly define. “You’re it for me.”
“I had to sit through you staring at Cas when I was tethered to him, and he stared back through my eyes. I heard that didn’t stop after I left,” Jimmy smiles, but it’s the kind of smile a teacher has when explaining a math problem that they’ve already gone over with you five times before. “Trust me. He’s into you.”
Dean guides her back towards the door, quickening his pace as he hears Cas’s footsteps approaching from behind them.
“How could I look at you and not love you?” Cas returns smoothly—like it was the simplest question that he’s ever been asked.
It’s a sunny afternoon, quite the perfect day for a barbecue. Dean’s almost disappointed, as if wanting the rain so he’d have a reason to postpone the dinner with his parents.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” she says sincerely. “I talked to him about all this before you came over. I thought he understood.”
“But saying all that stuff makes me also feel like I got punched in the stomach a few times,” Dean chuckles lowly.
“Well...good,” Dean exhales, shifting his feet nervously. “We should be here doing this. Right? I mean, it’s what we’re supposed to do, mend fences or whatever.”
There’s the metallic smell of his blood dripping from his cut hand. The steady sound of pounding on the door creates a harrowing rhythm, reminding them of the imminent threat that looms outside the room. All the chaos of the world around them blurs, leaving Dean in pure focus.
Dean feels a sense of resolve go through him, reaching forward and grabbing Cas’s hand before he can second guess it. His breath begins to steady as he looks at their intertwined hands. It’s almost as if someone’s foot has leaned off his throat.
Ash loves talking to Cas about the systems heaven uses and advises him on how to strengthen them. Cas listens patiently, even though most of it goes over his head.
“Of course, you matter. What we have matters,” Cas emphasizes. “That’s why I didn’t want to see the mess I made of it.”
He takes a moment to breathe in and out as his father silently fumes, trying to remember the reason for showing up at his parents’ door.
Cas shifts up on the bed, leaning against the bedframe. Dean groans as he gets off of him. He walks out of the bedroom and towards the front of the house.
A silence then settles between them. Dean listens to the sound of the wind as it rustles the trees. But Sam’s annoyingly clearing his throat, making it hard to focus.
“No,” Dean laughs and reaches for Cas’s hand that sits between them on the cement. “But I love you for wanting to.”
Another place he frequents for the company is Jody’s house. There, he visits Jody and Donna, eager to hear what they know about the girl’s lives that he missed out on after he got taken by the Empty.
“It’s not fair,” Cas adds bitterly. “After everything he did for the world, he should live a life that he wants.”
In the distance, Cas hears the bell above the store’s entrance door chime. Cas quickly steps behind the corner they’re near, putting his back against the wall to remain out of sight.
Jimmy nods, and Dean feels something akin to butterflies in his stomach, but he would never call them butterflies, no matter how much the bastards are fluttering right now.
When Cas appears suddenly on Bobby’s porch, he doesn’t seem surprised to see him. It’s almost as if Bobby was expecting his arrival, even though Cas didn’t decide until seconds ago that he was coming to visit him. But it’s not too strange, as Cas always thought Bobby had a sixth sense, seeing things on the horizon before others.
But before Dean can reply or ask anything more, he hears the sound rustling wings again, and Jack’s gone.
But they couldn’t keep the lights on in heaven without more angels, so Jack started creating new angels with Cas’s assistance. Those angels are more readily accepting of their new mission. They know nothing but a God who’s present, believe in free will, and view Cas’s past actions on Earth with admiration.
“And you didn’t think to tell me?” Dean interrupts with a harsh voice, causing Sam to flinch. “That even though I’ve been praying to him every day, looking for him everywhere, you stumble into him and don’t bother to let me know?”
“You don’t have to worry about that,” Jack says abruptly, bringing Cas back to reality and away from that moment which happened all those months—or he guesses now, years, ago.
“Yet you managed to talk to practically everyone but me,” Dean points out, causing Cas to flinch. He steps back, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Man, avoiding me has always been easy for you, hasn’t it?”
“You will see him eventually. I saved him because he’s my father and because I owe him everything, but also because he’s part of your family.” Jack looks around him at the beautiful space his powers created. But instead of beaming at it with pride, there’s a flicker of dissatisfaction in his expression. “It’s not your heaven without him, though, is it?”
He starts to kiss him again, and he thinks he’s made Cas forget about the knocking entirely, but the knocking starts up again.
He should tell Cas to ease off, that they’re in heaven together, so they might as well make this work.
He lets himself enjoy this. He’s not used to having someone like Cas around John, someone who has no history with him and doesn’t put up with his bullshit from the get-go.
“It’s like I dived into an ocean I made for the fish,” Cas explains, glancing down at his feet, moving around specs of dirt that he probably placed there with his shoe. “Instead of swimming to the surface or sinking like I’m supposed to, my body acclimates to the environment. It’s like I’m holding water with weighted wings.”
“Your eyes, they’re so goddamn blue it’s not even fair,” Dean murmurs, his mouth drifting near the corners of his eyes. “Your bravery and your courage to stand by someone’s side even when you know the battle is a lost cause,” he adds and kisses him again, his tongue grazing against his. Cas melts into his touch, but Dean keeps pulling back to speak. “Your compassion to help everyone. Your dorky humor. Your obliviousness.”
Even though Dean just praised his eloquent phrasing, he can’t for the life of him think of anything to say.
They’re on the bench sometime later. Cas doesn’t really know how long has passed. Keeping track of time here is difficult, but it’s even more of a challenge when Dean’s hands are running down his back, and his tongue is skimming his bottom lip.
But it had been a while since he’d seen them, his mother stopped by at the end of the party, but his father was visibly missing. He knew enough was enough and couldn’t keep putting this off forever.
