"I told you not to call me that Dean. I'm not even your Alpha yet." Michael explained but Dean shook his head
Dean let out a startled yip as suddenly something was put over his eyes and a blindfold was tied behind his head. The burning smell of the Alpha was so close and Dean had to fight the urge to lean towards it, instead a rather undignified whimper clawed out of his throat as the scent and heat of Alistair moved away from behind him.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Michael was pulled from his thoughts by clammy trembling hands gripping his own, blinking the angel gave Dean's trembling hands a gentle squeeze
He was going to get married.
He had started his natural heat a month ago, and during that they kept giving him these shots, Dean didn't know what they were but they kept him in heat the entire time. Kept him ready to be used even though he tried to fight it, his Omega biology screamed otherwise and the Prince /hated/ it with a passion. He was nothing but a ready body that could be overpowered with enough force.
Lucifer soon joined at his side and the demons outside were soon gargling blood and dead at their feet.
It was very delicate considering the Seraph had painted it when he was 8 years old.
"Alpha, I'm ready when you are." Dean's voice rang out, the Winchester stood beside his steed, Baby shuffled and stamped her hooves impatient to get running as Dean held her reigns and kept his eyes on the ground
Lucifer smiled at the beautiful woman on his arm as he led her to his car
"Good morning everyone." He gave everyone a small smile, Michael and Gabriel returned the gesture and Raphael glared hatefully at Dean.
Adam stood, eyes down at his feet, wringing his hands with a frown
Michael gave Dean a raised brow look as Lilith pulled out a tape measure.
The demon didn't want to answer and snapped his mouth shut.
A heavy hand rested on his shoulder suddenly, making the Winchester flinch and move away. Green eyes looked up meeting his father's face
"Stop babying me. I'm fine."
"You're telling me... Dad wanted to join us for cake tasting. Any excuse for sweets really." Dean frowned shifting in his seat as more cake was shoved at them, only making him feel more sick to the stomach
Michael frowned again as Lucifer's eyes met his.
Dean only nodded, keeping one hand on Castiel's chest, the other still gripping the demon blood soaked dagger. The freckled and blood splattered Prince simply hummed his response, eyes traveling back to thw demanding Omega Witch that held the entire room in enraptured silence.
Dean pulled the tie strings of his robe a little tighter, and looked around at all the shattered glass and splintered wood.
The demon growled and grabbed Dean's hair
"I know this is a lot for you. You were used and abused and it's horrible. But if you're pregnant..."
"I would like to see my brother. Is he awake?"
"Oh. Uh food." Michael thrusted it towards Lucifer's face. He gave the blond a cheesy grin that reminded Lucifer a lot of Gabriel before continuing
He had seen Castiel and Dean on the shore in the early morning hours, he and Lucifer's relationship was finally nearly at a snapping point. This Abaddon character made him uncomfortable and her sudden ascension to the Throne of Hell was incredibly alarming. Not to mention she wanted Dean as a mate? Why? He was a child compared to him, and definitely a child compared to a demon like Abaddon.
"I didn't tell her shit because the little fuckers attacked me! I'd rather go toe to toe with Lucifer again than have the birds and bees discussion with a 4 year old little girl."
Lucifer waited with the horses for a few moments watching as the men prepared to move out.
"If you are challenging him, Raphael than say it and it shall be done. If not take a seat and respect your future King, and your brother." Chuck finally said as he set his fork down as he shot a glare at Raphael
Dean put a hand over his heart as he felt the organ want to burst from his chest. Taking deep breaths he began to calm down and finally would be making his way down to his brothers and step mother for breakfast.
Dean blinked a few times and looked at the young gaurd
"Not as heavy as my heart." Michael muttered taking the towel and patting his face dry with a sniff, his nose caught whiff of the maid and it clicked in his mind. The way her scent was, with a constant undertone of Lucifer, and something else. It made his heavy heart drop lower, the words and moments he and Lucifer had shared, had they meant nothing to the general? When they had meant the world to Michael? The Alpha didn't realize that a few fresh tears had filled his eyes and slipped down his cheeks until Kelly made a noise
Lucifer rode up along side him and nodded a little.
Sam ignored the way his brother's breath hitched, and the way he closed his eyes and bit the inside of his cheek as Sam cupped Dean's face in his hands
Now that Michael actually thought about it he was sure that Raphael had been gunning for the crown for years. He was always trying to find something about Michael that would discredit him entirely. Now that Michael really thought about it, Raphael never seemed to want to be a part of the family and that stung.
"Good." She chuckled with a swish of her hips as she walked away, she paused and looked over her shoulder "The hip swish was not for you your Majesty." She tossed him a wink and scurried off to clean Dean's chambers.
"It's alright. If you feel the need to call the wedding off, my Father will still keep peace with Heaven. If not I certainly will when I'm King."
"I said, get the fuck out!" Dean spun around to face Castiel, hands clenched into tight fists, knuckles bruised and scraped open.
Castiel had greatly embarrassed his eldest brother and threatened a guest of the King. This was a horrible nightmare and the Angel Prince just wanted to wake up.
Dean turned around at the sharp smell of his Father and the sweet smell of his step Mother. With a sweet delicate smiled Kate pulled Dean into a tight loving hug.
He finished getting dressed and opened the door a little. The maids were nice, very nice, they treated him like a Prince, like a person.
"Now now pet. I'm going to have some fun with this." He moved a tray of various sharp objects off to the side and crouched in front of Dean, hand resting on his knee.
Michael blinked a few times in surprise at the teens jolly demeanor but horrid threat.
"Cas? Hey, wake up I need to know you're alive" his voice came in a desperate rasp "Cas? Baby you need to wake up, groan, twitch something! Come on Angel" Dean shook the bloodied angel a bit trying to get a response from his blood and grace covered husband. But upon no response he whirled to look at the dark version of his husband.
"What for? We only have mugs and it's a little to warm for coffee or cocoa."
"Don't talk back whore. We haven't even begun to deal with you yet!"
"Kiss dollface for me would ya?" Gabe laughed, making a kissy face.
The war had come to an end.
"Okay Daddy. See you ok Friday!"
Dean bit his lip and looked at his hands, resting on the Alpha's chest, the steady and strong heart beat under his fingertips like a drum. It called to him and he couldn't run to it.
After He and Lisa had decided to be friends and co-parent Ben that way, he hadn't had much luck or time dating. Seemed every lady loved the idea of a single Dad, but not the idea that their were 2 kids with 2 women that were still around.
He spun around uselessly searching the room to no avail. He had lost Dean, again. Anger filled the angel as he destroyed anything his hands could reach, the chairs were smashed against the floor or wall, the mini fridge torn out and thrown through the window, the sink was pulled from the bathroom wall, with one punch the little table splintered and without any effort both beds were flipped, the door thrown off its hinges as Castiel stalked into the parking lot.
Almost an entire minute after he knocked of silence until the door opened and Chuck peeked out his tired face
â€œAnyway-" Dean cleared his throat and looked up at Michael, setting the file down and twisting his watch to check the time, "I'm uh, well acquainted, with a few dames there, they might know something. We got time to spare, could head over early, grab a bite and ask around before the late night flappers and dead Hoofers get there."
"Hello Lucifer. I do believe we had the same idea of coming here and clearing our heads."
"I banished you Witch!" He roared spinning around to face the red haired witch, everyone, demon, angel, human and otherwise were frozen as the Angel King fumed
"Dean is missing."
"Not that. I /won't/ get rid of the baby. Even if it is a piece of /him/ I just... I couldn't." Dean tried to explain with a frown
Still he sat straight and tried to look as fine, and as regal as he could when wrapped in an old blanket with mud and blood stains, while shirtless and uncomfortably in heat, with his smell filling the air and turning heads, he tried to look royal even through his lips were cut, his face was bruised and his face was filthy with blood and dirt.
Perhaps he was overthinking... Afterall overthinking was very much a Dean thing and it only made him want to drown in himself.
"Hello Lucifer, what do you need? Do we have a casualty count? Are the bodies accounted for? What of the injured?" Michael turned from the small mirror to face the blonde Alpha. He to was an Archangel but held no royal blood, he stood just a tad taller then the Prince and was full of rebellion and anger.
Charlie approached the tall Omega cautiously before putting her hand on his shoulder
Gabriel shook his head, running a hand through his slicked-back hair. "Nah Luc, France is aces, he left Anna in charge over there. Balty just wanted to let us know, as he does, that there's this new flatfoot taking your case. Apparently he doesn't give up easily either and that may cause an issue."
Dean came in after Sam, looking around before he began to speak
"Trust me Dean. He has it under control." The Beta smiled widely before taking Dean's hands and hoisting him to his feet. "Until then, let's get you in the nice hot bath I prepared for you yeah?" Dean nodded and pushed Charlie out of the bathroom
So many thoughts swirled in the ex Angel's mind, clawing at him, hissing from the darkest corners of his memories. The remaining damage from the Leviathans, from Lucifer, hissed and growled at him all the time, the voices of his fallen brothers and sisters, screamed at him. The drugs made it better, made it quiet. Much like Dean had.
Michael turned the corner as a panicked looking Dean came at him full force, colliding right with his shoulder, closely followed by Castiel and Gabriel whom looked just as confused as Michael felt.
"But you're pregnant." Michael frowned. The words hurt to say. Had Lucifer been exaggerating his words and devotion? The Love he had described? Michael supposed fhe other Alpha had never used the word love, but the way he spoke, of how he would wish he was standing at the alter with him in Dean's place, how he would steal the stars if asked, take in the world, surely that was love.
"We have the most marvelous library that you've not had the chance to see." Gabriel explained not looking at the slightly taller younger Prince
Dean knelt on the cool tile of the bathroom, throwing up his insides, on the morning of his wedding to the man he wanted nothing more than friendship for, the thought of what Castiel's face would look like as Michael and Dean were officially announced Mates and Married made Dean gag again.
Pulling out the letter he began to read and his wings drooped slightly before positioning back to a normal relaxed but ready state.
But none of it was okay. When the gunfire stopped, and Castiel had found that garden, Lucifer was gone, and Dean lie in the grass, neck snapped and face blank.
"Oh yeah! I forget that kid is related sometimes."
It was quite a lot of Alpha for one room and the Omega Prince had to swallow hard at all the dominating scents in the room.
Silence overtook the two Alpha's again when Sam shifted his weight and finally spoke
"If you don't wanna hurt me, if you actually love me, do this for me."
Finally Castiel's eyelids grew heavy and a yawn escaped him.
There was no way.
"I promise Gabriel. I'll find the Prince for you, for Michael." He said softly with a slight smile, a hand on the shorter Alpha's shoulder "Go take care of Michael and make sure the dumbass sleeps. I will find his Omega."
"I just wanted a moment with my father! Is that so hard to ask?" Dean asked pacing back and forth in one of the gardens. Being spring it was atill rather chilly, and Dean not being used to it had on a fluffy long coat, the grass was starting to turn green and flower buds were color bulbs on the trees and bushes.
The Angel had bloody and bruised knuckles and a scowl on his face, the way his wings were fluffed and raised slightly along with his scent was nothing but hostile and aggressive.
For an Omega raised as an Alpha, Dean was kind and motherly, like an Omega, but built and stubborn like an Alpha.
Dean laid in bed with an ache in his heart and a longing in his gut, as if he had just discovered that missing piece to his life, and that missing piece was ripped from his soul in an instant.
"Not for another two weeks Father... What is this about?"
"Excuse me Sam, I know you wanted time to yourself, but I needed to look at these maps" Gabriel hurriedly explained as he burst into the library startling the younger Alpha
"Shut up. Whatever rumors you may have heard are false, I've come to you about a myth."
As the squad pulled in on their horses the people in the market stopped and whispered among themselves wondering why the royal gaurd, an Archangel and one of the Prince's included, would be riding into a small insignificant town such as their's.
Michael simply nodded and sighed
One last glance at his reflection and now satisfied Dean closed the heavy wood door behind him and headed to his Father's study.
'Gunsel' it was slang for a young homosexual, with a double meaning as a gunman.
"Dean, Sam practically already knows and Jack has asked me about us. Just sleep." Cas whispered Into Dean's hair, rubbing soothing circles into the hunter's back as Dean's breath evened out into sleep.
Dean looked up from where he was still straddling the bloody remains of the once powerful Alpha Queen of Hell.
A devilish smirk found Dean's lips
"Hey, it'll be alright. Your father assured me that Gabriel has it under control."
"Michael?"
"Really now? What part doesn't sit right with you? The age gap? The arrangement? The expectancy for the two to fall in love?"
The freckled Prince pulled a face and sighed "I will head to breakfast, but I may not eat. I'm afraid I may be unwell." He grumbled as he grabbed his clothes for the day and headed behind his changing curtain.
Dean gasped and released the demon's hand from his mouth, the tang of warm blood on his tongue and he couldn't give a shit.
"I'm going to order pizza!" Cas nearly shouted and pushed passed Dean to get out of the tent. Effectively knocking the old hunter over onto the pillows that lined the floor of the tent.
Michael's wings tensed
Kellie pulled her robe tighter around her as she blinked her tired eyes up at the Alpha
The last 5 or 6 years Raphael had slipped away from them all, and now he was gone.
"Cassie, I do believe one of the gentlemen in the back corner by our eldest brother dear own that beauty of a car out there. No no, don't make eye contact the one with the dark hair is letting off cop vibes while the other seems right at home. To the table on the opposite side of them will do, stay close to the door and we will order drinks and I will greet Luci dear and Kelly." He spoke easily as he led them to the table he had before mentioned
With a smile he looked at Michael, but the sad look in the Crowned Prince's eyes made that smile slip into a frown
Dean felt John pull put of the hug, hands gripping his son's shoulders tightly, not painfully so but enough to know he wouldn't be let go, John's thumbs rubbed the Prince's shoulders, eyes scanning the Omega's face
The door opened to a sleepy and fuzzy headed Alpha, blood and pink colored wings in a fluffed mess and a scowl on his face
The Crowned Prince didn't want the Throne if this was the price.
Michael paused outside the door and his feathers rippled in nervous or excited waves.
"Unfortunately the gift isn't the world, yet." Lucifer's shoulders moved as he laughed, the tension from everything going on seemed to disappear as he spent time with his girl, /His/ girl. It was nice, a bit of normalcy for the man that never knew what that was. For a man that took his first life at 13, that had more blood on his hands than water in the Pacific.
Michael got to know Sam a bit better and the kid was a good kid for sure, and he always spoke about Dean with such a high respect, which honestly was strange and refreshing to see from an Alpha.
Michael dismounted and pulled both Seraphs into a tight hug.
Crowley leaned back in his seat looking at the two other Alpha's. Waiting for a response of which he knew Chuck was not happy. Both Chuck and John's scents were sour with rage. Chuck raised his wings in a show of aggression as the Enochian King stood to his feet, John may be taller, but with Chuck's wings up and out he was the much bigger threat
"Thank you." Michael smiled giving Kelly's hand a gentle squeeze. He felt a little lighter having talked to her, though he didn't get a chance to reflect much as the second she was gone Sam blurted out
Nope.
Technically each chapter is 2 chapters combined.
"I'll leave you two to talk."
Dean struggled in his ropes more as he kept his worried gaze on the grumbled angel that sat against the wall away from him. He needed to get out, they needed to get this guy gone. Dead, or booted out of this world, or back to his timeline, something anything to get this broken version of Castiel gone and away from him.
"Come on in boy what do you need?" The King added making room for his third eldest to enter
He had to take what he wanted growing up, had to fight and kill for it.
Still Dean had not left the Castle's property, but it wouldn't be to much longer before Michael took him to meet the people of the capital.
Michael frowned as he thought about everything going on.
It hurt, it hurt so much and Michael felt a piece of him chip away. Everything going on was just so heavy on the angel. With a heavy sigh Michael exited his chambers. As he strode down the hallway he was silently met with Gabriel at his right hand, Balthazar to his left and Slightly behind him, and Castiel completing the diamond shape the four princes solemnly walked in. Each with wings held stiffly behind their backs, adorned in black with crowns upon their heads,chins held high as the four line Alpha Princes of Heaven, stepped out of the confines of the palace walls, to meet the people of their Kingdom.
Benny nodded and turned to knock lightly, when there was no answer he shrugged at the King.
Of course he had decided to leave some things for when he visited home... Which he hoped his future husband would allow of course.
"Don't apologize Dean." Castiel spoke so gently and sincere that Dean had to fight back another wave of tears. He felt so weak and vulnerable right now and it scared him.
Dean smiled slightly and looked at Michael as he crossed his arms
The next morning a maid came and knocked on Dean's door.
Dean looked at Cas and frowned before taking a deep breath, his tongue between his teeth as he debated over what to say before tears pricked his eyes for the millionth time this month
The whole entire day went by and was rather boring. Lilith was the only one of the people to arrive today, as scheduled, the florists would be arriving the next day along with the bakers.
Michael made the one mistake that had been trained out of him when he was younger, he took his eyes off his attacker for only a second, his icy eyes flicking upward to see Lucifer had moved closer to the railing, his wings stiff in anticipation.
Michael was a great guy, a nice Alpha, he would be a good ruler, he genuinely cared about Dean, and things couldn't be that bad right?
"Gabriel promised? The dude that's been sick for two days? That Gabriel?" Dean wiped his mouth and shot a glare to the red haired maid "Chuck has already made it loud and clear that he will cause issues if I don't go through with this, the whole reason we're doing this damned marriage is because some bitchy Queen said it was that or war. So what is Gabriel, of all people supposed to do to fix this!" Dean cried out from where he was seated on the bathroom tile
"I will return in time for the wedding, don't worry." Lucifer added with a roll of his eyes
"Hello Dean."
And soon Michael stood alone. The rain coming down almost suddenly as his knees hit the wet graveside grass. The carriages and companies of friends and family riding off towards the palace where they would share stories and eat their fill of food.
Gabriel kept his four wings folded and shrugged
That alone sent raw instinct that Castiel had never needed to deal with through his body.
"It was nothing like that Charlie. As I told you, it isn't anything like the mess you were thinking." The Prince huffed out his face darkening slightly with a blush of embarrassment
"My King, my Princes." He spoke formally and with such a lack of emotion it was unsettling for Michael "I leave in the morning to ensure the removal of a threat to the throne and the being responsible for the kidnapping and torture of Omega Prince Dean Winchester. Their removal shall be permanent."
"Wow Michael. Quiet a blush for a fierce King."
Was it her lack of a natural and real scent?
With a mumbled good night Michael turned to head down to his own room, he paused outside Castiel's door and felt as if he should knock, but didn't for fear of not wanting to wake him.
The kind and actually rather small Alpha king smiled at him and stood.
"You're kidding? Is that even gonna be right? How the hell do you even make a damn slushie?"
"Do tell John, what's the matter with the wedding? Dean and Michael have done a splendid job with planning. It's a beautiful mix of Human and Enochian marital customs." Chuck added eyeing John almost suspiciously
Dean growled and frankly it sounded more like a wounded whimper and he mentally slapped himself over and over for sounding weak
Take a drag.
Dean shook his head, he wiggled his wrists trying to escape
"Milady," Alistair cut in as the hand slipped away from Dean's face "We do have a couple other loyalists to deal with."
The Crowned Prince turned a shade if pink and his wings twitched before folding neatly to his back.
Michael still hugged the lifeless Archangel in his arms and was actually crying. The three brothers looked between eachother before they gathered around Michael. The dark haired angel was mumbling apologies and begging forgiveness from not only bis fallen brother, but the three brothers surrounding him.
Crowley tilted his head as Gabriel came to a slowing stop before him
Michael headed towards his room and fell deep into thought. He had found it odd that Dean had requested to be by himself and did not want dinner, with everyone elsebut rather alone in his room.
Unfortunately for them this would need to end in blood.
Adam opened his mouth to speak when his mother's voice rang out calling for him
Castiel bristled at that comment. The great battles during the four year war with Hell that Michael had led, and killing his own brother is what made their father proud of the older Novak?
As they exited the building into the warm humidity of the New Orleans evening air Dean pointed to the sleek black car, the Winchester beamed a proud flashy smile as Michael halted gaping at the sight of Dean's car.
"Is Dean alright?" Castiel asked looking from Gabriel, who had been sent to locate the Winchester, and Sam, who was last seen with the freckled Prince.
Sam's shoulders relaxed and a smile was heard on his voice
"Angel-Cas? Where the fu-" Dean came to a halt in the doorway of his living room. His living room that had been very much rearranged.
"You already know what I'm going to ask."
Upon entering the guest quarters for King Crowley Gabriel suddenly was a bit nervous. Crowley had been king of Hell for a while and made the Prince a tad uncomfortable. Though it seemed the demon Alpha made everyone uncomfortable...
Michael moved his sword, the fire extinguishing. He didnâ€™t bother wiping the tears from his face, no need when more would surely be shed tonight.
As the large gates to the castle opened Dean rubbed the sleep from his eyes and peered out the window.
It was refreshing for Michael to see the two of them again. He noticed how Castiels wings had darkened further in the last two years while Balthazars were still a beige color.
As Dean entered the dining room his brothers and step mother, Kate, were already seated.
"I'm so happy you're safe and alright!" She nearly burst into tears as she spoke, a little gasp came out as she hugged him tight
"Jeez Uncle Bobby why'd ya do a thing like that?" Dean frowned, turning his head to glare at his uncle. Bobby raised an eyebrow before he spoke, turning his wheelchair to face the boys better.
John nodded clapping a hand to Dean's shoulder
Now Dean didn't expect love at first sight. It wasn't how these things worked. His father had told him countless times that after you get to know them, they're scent will be like home and that no one else will ever be able to replace them. That Dean would eventually fall in love with the Alpha...
"Feeling well Michael?" Castiel greeted with a bow
"No need Dean." Castiel kept his hand on Dean's cheek and wiped his thumb over a tear that slipped down the other man's cheek "You don't need to say anything at all." The Alpha spoke softly and his eyes watered a little.
Michael's wings lowered and he ran his hands through his stilk damp dark hair
"That's some of it. I'll get it looked at this afternoon when I'm done tuning up another car."
"I'm very happy for you, brother. Though, if Kali messes up, she'll have a whole other problem to deal with, we are confident, she won't let us down here. I wouldn't mind some coffee coloured nieces and nephews." Cas teased with a sly grin - obviously Gabe's doing.
Everyone had lost friends, or even family in this bloody war
"Yes." He stood rather abruptly, practically shoving the clipboard into Dean's outstretched hand "My contact number is there, if you cannot reach me Michaelâ€™s number is listed as my secondary contact. Insurance should cover a portion of the repair expenses." Castiel added with an almost flustered look on his face
On either side of the large fireplace were two giant windows overlooking none other then the Western Crystal sea of Heaven.
"I'm alright. Promise. Just a bad dream." He slipped his feet into his slippers frowning and he left the warmth of his nest, his bed rather.
Only cracked it.
After Dean closed and locked his bedroom door, he let out a gasped sob and leaned his head against the door.
"How." Michael asked, well more like stated as his wings lifted slightly, despite the dull throb in two of them
"You have my permission to instruct and oversee the search parties. Take Castiel with you as his garrison will serve as help. I will inform my father of these developments and will discuss pushing the wedding out further. Gabriel, I want you to do what you do best, find the breach in our security. These things should have never happened again." He said with a simple frown that made all four Alpha's look to the ground at the memories.
Lucifer kissed the top of Michael's hand and patted it a little
The Alpha laughed and shook his head
This was very bad.
Dean mentally lectured himself for having been so careless when he was younger.
Loving Lucifer hurt.
Granted, Michael hadn't expected a reaction from him, he didn't expect him to drop everything and help look for the missing Prince. In fact he supposed he got the reaction that was most logical.
"Adam, sometimes grown ups hide why they're sad to protect the people they care about. Your parents and brothers just don't want you to be worried."
The most Dean knew of the Crown Prince Michael was he was a valiant warrior and kind hearted towards his people.
Michael did not correct Dean now twice on referring to him as Alpha, as it seemed he was doing it more out of fun then the feeling of obligation.
"Still dunno why you married a dude named Lucifer. And after all the shit he put you through when y'all were in school." Dean wiped his hands on his pants and smiled at Jack again
"If you're sure than I will get a few men and personally locate the Prince." Lucifer said as he grabbed the long smooth silver blade he owned and his boots. Sitting down he began to shove his boots back on as he looked up at Gabriel "Where was the last you saw him?"
He would keep fighting, and he would do it alone. Perhaps someone would have mercy on him when he finally bit the dust and allow him to be with Dean when the time came. Death was a bitch but even she couldn't be that cruel could she?
"Am I alright?" A bitter chuckle slipped passed Dean's lips "I'm so suck of everyone asking that. I do not grieve over the traitor Raphael. I grieve fro his brothers and the horror he forced them through. If I had been in Michael's position I would have rather fallen upon my own sword than take the life of my brother."
Michael nodded as the party of winged Alphas made there way into the Castle after handing the horses over to a stable boy.
"Sure, Lucifer, I will." he sighed, headed back to his desk to do as he was told.
Michael swiftly took a step back, his sword swinging with a mighty cry.
The whole room was warm and cozy, intimate even...
"Michael, I am loyal to you and you alone. I have followed you to the ends if the world, and I will continue to do so, if you asked me to quench the light of the sun into the Sea I will do it. If you request the moon, I will bring it, I will lay down my life for you Michael. I know I can't change the fact you are to Marry Dean, I know I cannot stop the challenge for the crown that was set before you, but know I will lay my life down before I serve another. You own me Michael, my Prince, and my King. You own my life, my soul, and my heart."
"Cas." Dean opened his eyes, moving to look into seas of glowing blue
"If you're sure Dean." Castiel whispered low, warm strong hand still resting on rhe Omega's lower back, wing still stretched behind him
Shooting a raised eyebrow glance at Dean Cas tilted his head
John pulled out of the hug with a small smile. Gave Castiel a firm shoulder squeeze, and followed his wife and sons from the room.
"You wouldn't understand. You aren't a parent, or a King." Chuck continued "Besides I thought you humans didn't care about waiting for the perfect mate anyway?"
The Archangel gave the Omega a soft small smile to which Dean did not return. His expression was blank and his eyes seemed empty. His face was covered in bruises and scrapes, one eye nearly swollen shut, his lips were chapped and split. He wore boots and an outfit like that of the soliders, but with no armor, and Castile's blood stained tan trenchcoat. It broke Michael's heart to see someone in such a state, Michael didn't want to fathom what the rest of the Omega looked like right now.
Sam offered a hand and helped Dean off the ground.
Part of him secretly wanted to picture dark feathers like the night sky. Shaking his head Dean pulled his hands back as a low rumble startled him, glancing at Michael he chuckled a little.
"No. Lydia was already here yo tell me I'm late, whine I about Emma's hair, glare a bit and the usual accusing me of picking favorites." Dean huffed jabbing a thumb over his shoulder "The usual shit. So Emma is already with her Mother"
"It's alright Sam. They aren't very public, but are more common than you'd think."
Charlie gave the Prince a raised brow
Gabriel let out a low whistle before fixing his whiskey gaze on the ever-tired Castiel, "Luci's not wrong, but he ain't right either."
Michael tore his mind from the pain of his wound, it wasn't even bad. But the steady slow drip of warm thick blood through his sleeve was very distracting.
"I will see you at breakfast father." Gabriel gave his father and King a bow before hurriedly leaving
"Release him Abaddon!" He roared his injured wing protesting Slightly as he raised them out in a threatening manner
Before he reached his own however, his older brother Gabriel's door opened and the golden four winged angel frowned and tilted his head
As she finished handing out plates, and pouring drinks, the door opened again, slower this time. Michael stepped in first, followed by a slow walking Lucifer. The General had bandages around his head and neck, his arms, hands, his wings were splinted, bald patches of burned skin littered the once beautiful bloody red and pink hues.
"Heal him!" Dean hissed, his grip on the fragile wing bone tightening
Gone.
Sam turned back to the blond as they entered Gabe's chambers, the door was then closed and the Archangel let out a sigh
Both laughing the whole way. Dean made it to the bedroom door as Castiel slammed it in his face with a cackling laugh
The Crowned Prince Michael was to be heading home now, it would take a while to lead what was left of the army back into the territory of Heaven, but it would be worth it.
As Dean and both his precious children belted out the some song about a stuffed manatee, Dean pulled into the parking lot of 'Singer Auto and Repair' a creaky garage and chop shop his uncle Bobby owned, and the place Dean worked full time except for most Saturdays and Sundays when he had the kids
"Either attack me or lay down your sword Michael. You're a coward." Raphael hissed as he tried to catch his breath
"I'm glad you had time. How was your meeting yesterday? I was really close to calling your boss. It's whacky how long he's making you work." she sighed, shaking her head in discontent.
Dean bit his lip to stifle yet another sad whimper that clawed at his throat.
Michael said nothing for a moment, only stared at Lucifer for a long while.
"I was going to ask if you were alright?"
Dean straightened up as he felt several pairs of eyes on him. Ignoring the feeling of looking down in submission he lofted his chin as an Alpha would and looked down the table making eye contact with Chuck.
"Could you show me to the balcony? I didn't get a chance to see much of the sea when we were here last."
He would be a good Alpha and a good husband, he would rule this kingdom fairly how he had been taught and Earth was quickly becoming a powerful ally.
"What Deano? I know how to have fun. Mikey needs to be reminded that sometimes"
He had won, but at the cost of his brother's life.
"No you're not and you never will be! Heal him now you son of a bitch before I shove this blade so far up your ass you'll be caughing up shrapnel!" Dean's eyes filled with tears as he yelled at the other angel. He wanted Cas to be alright, but between blood and grace loss he could die. He wouldn't have Cas died because some fucked up version of himself came in and ruined everything
"Gabriel went where?" Michael asked blinking a few times to process what Sam had just blurted
Castiel seemed to be always in the corner of his mind. With every shade of blue Dean saw Castiel. With every Angel he met he silently and deep down compared their wings to Castiel's.
"This better be fucking- Your Highness." He paused with a slight bow as he saw one of the Princes before him "To what do I owe the pleasure Gabriel?" Lucifer's face softened as he looked at the younger Prince. Honestly Lucifer really liked Gabriel, he was a troublemaking kid and Lucifer found it hilarious. He had taught the blond Prince many tricks as the boy grew up and it was in fact a treat to see him, though a bit concerning at such a late hour
Luckily Michael grabbed Dean's armband hoisted him back up onto his feet.
"Just off to speak with my father. Good morning Crowley." Gabriel's wings twitched in unease as he smiled at the demon
Dean paused a moment. He wasn't sure what his favorite color was... He had reasons for liking all kinds of colors, but one color seemed to be front and center in his mind.
Kate raised an eyebrow. The Beta Queen already knew, but she thought John would inform all the boys
"He can be, but he's still kinder then most people I know. You should of seen how red he turned when Lilith was taking his measurements today, and how flustered he was at the suggestion of him wearing a traditional Omega wedding gown!" Michael laughed with a shake of his head and flexed his wings "But in all seriousness, I don't know if I'm ready for this..."
"Don't you 'Barbie Boy' me Mr." Dean shook his head but held the flashlight as Cas examined the contents of the blender "It's mostly crushed I think..." He explained as he poured the mostly slushie looking concoction into two coffee mugs and grabbed a couple of plastic spoons from the drainage rack by the sink
"No clue. But Gabriel always told me, there are only two appropriate things to experiment with. Food in the kitchen, and your lover in bed." Cas chuckled and shook his head as he put the lid on "He's a fucking idiot."
Dean kept his eyes trained on where his hand rested on the doo handle to the vast library. His ears felt on fire and he hated it, his stomach twisted with the negative self deprecating thoughts that clawed at the edges of his mind.
Dean just nodded, his arms tightening a little around his middle
"The deul is being prepared. Your presence is required as this holds the treaty along with the throne. You are permitted to give your best to whomever you hope to win, and a reserved seat is set for you beside King Chuck and his other sons."
Dean protested rather loudly and pulled his arm away
The Ministers wings were trembling as he shook, stepping forward he cleared his throat, going through the official coronation ritual.
Castiel straightened up and lifted his chin, wings stiff behind him and steady as he effortlessly steadied his steed.
Dean was so deep in thought about all of this as he headed down the hallway.
Take a swig.
Dean then gave his 'See you laters' and hugs to his two dear brothers and got into the rather plain looking carriage.
Or Omega.
"I'm so sorry." Dean gasped and wiped his tears away avoiding eye contact with Castiel.
Dean spun around and looked at the blond little girl, her hair in a rough looking ponytail he knew her mother would frown at, but he was trying and the 6 year old rarely held still for him anyway
"No!" Chuck's gaze was dark and threatening as the Alpha lifted his chin "We do not bring /her/ into this. Your mother stays out of this also. Michael is to marry the Omega Prince provided Abaddon didn't taint him to badly. He is never to be with another Alpha Regardless of what your mother can reveal. Red Strings mean nothing in politics. Love means nothing in withholding Peace."
For as large as the black mare was, she easily zigzagged between trees, over logs, and even through a creek with no problem. Michael's horse had been to war and didn't have much of an issue, though his mount was used to more open spaces, or at least trails.
Castiel held the picture up carefully, he was sickened by the thought that Dean, his perfect Dean, was actually married to that alternate reality knock off of himself.
Michael reached forward and placed a warm hand on Lucifer's cold cheek, the moon rising high and the stars twinkled
Dean opened his mouth to speak, at the same time Castiel opened his and both ended up muttering whatever random apology came to their lips.
"Who!?"
"You are under arrest, by the Royal Gaurd of Heaven, under the suspicion if assisting the kidnapping of his Royal Highness, the Omega Prince Dean of Earth. Whom, is to be wed to the future Enochian King, Crowned Prince Michael the Archangel of Heaven." Lucifer held the demons arms behind him with one hand and with his other slammed his face into the wall. There was a crack as one of the demons curled horns cracked but Lucifer didn't care.
"Well you're nice also." Castiel added as he looked dowm at the boy. There was a beat of silence before Castiel asked Adam a question
Hugging her father back, Emma then hugged Ben with a smile
As soon as theÂ  pizza arrived, everyone got into their pajamas and piled back into the fort. After a squabble with what movie to watch, and Mary Ellen nearly spilling fruit punch on the pillows, everyone settled in to eat dinner. Of course Miracle pouted, huffed, and whined outside the fort the entire time. Grumpy he wasn't allowed in until everyone had finished. The kids fell asleep half way through 'Meet the Robinsons' so Castiel cleaned up dinner and Dean scooped them up and carried them to Mary Ellen's room and tucked them in.
"I know." Kelly responded moving to dish the Prince some leftovers from dinner
The Alpha and Omega thundered through the woods, Deam seemed very much in his element, as did his dear Baby, who Michael had learned her name was actually Impala, but responded when Dean called her Baby as well.
The blonde knight's frown only deepened and Dean hated this guys smug but furious looking face. The Angel's wings twitched and flexed a few times before he crossed his arms over his armored chest.
Castiel fidgeted and his wings flinched out of Gabriel's hands
"Listen doll," He leaned over her desk as she sat back down "I just wanna talk to the big man. Not interested in talking to this Cohen guy right now." Dean spoke in a hushed tone glancing over his shoulder at the other man that Charlie had pointed out "Say, how about you let me slip in while Singer's on the phone, then maybe afterwards you and I can show you this great clip joint* I know of." Dean tilted his head, still leaning on her desk to which Charlie frowned.
Michael sent a silent prayer that he had misheard the challenge so bluntly declared. He could not be serious. Raphael knew what a challenge fir the Crown meant, one of them would walk away, the other would be buried.
Again Adam nodded in agreement at Sam's statement only making Deam frown and Gabriel laugh rather loudly.
"A witch. I need to know where I can find the Witch Rowena, the one that can see soulmates." Gabriel finally spit out, whiskey eyes flicking up to meet Crowley's intimidating red.
"My King."
"Have I led you to believe that Dean? The last thing I wanted was for you to be ashamed of who you are, the unchangeable parts of you, I never wanted you to be ashamed of that." The Alpha Human's voice cracked as he spoke to his son, heartbroken.
Spinning again Gabriel flopped back in one of the cushioned armchairs facing Castiel's desk indulging Castiel in his change of subject "My girl's a real doll. Her name's Kali, this gorgeous filthy rich Indian woman I met in Rome. Real gold digger." Gabe winked and leaned back, rubbing at the leather of the armrests of the chair, his eyes flicking up to look at Castiel as he wet his lips "We're both a couple of gold digging cons. But, there may be something more. Under the flirting, chasing, competition, sex, I think something's brewing and not just in me."
Should he be feeling this way?
That was when he noticed the butterfly bandage and scrape along Castiel's cheekbone, the cast around his what Dean assumed was his none dominant right wrist, as he was writing very neatly with his left "Dog would've done less damage. But I'm glad you didn't kill anything. Yourself included, telephone poles can be a bitch."
Balthazar didn't say anything other than simply shaking his head
"I've got him! Get Dean!" Sam shouted over the chaos and bloodshed.
"She had the audacity to introduce herself to Michael. The demon was responsible for Dean's kidnapping though she claims she was not a part of it." Cas frowned his wings lowered slightly as he ran a hand over his face
It was a lot and he was confused. His head pounded but he just kept running. The Omega's bowed legs carried him around a corner and his nose collided right with Michael's shoulder, making the Prince fall, almost, on his ass.
"Come here Dean." Castiel's voice was soft as he stood up, tossing the book he had onto the coffee table he held a single hand out as Dean shuffled heavy further into the room.
Dean was unable to get the Young Alpha Prince put of his head! His future husband didn't even stay in his head like Castiel did.
"I couldn't stand my Kingdom being the bad guys any longer. I wish for peace between the four realms, not war."
Dean's eyes slipped half closed and he would never admit that he may have had a little pout on his lips. The horrid events of the last hunt slipped to the back of his mind as he focused on the steady beating of the Angel's heart. Dean blinked slowly as Castiel ran his fingers through Dean's hair, the Winchester felt the familiar warm tug of grace wrap around him, the aching in his knuckles, and head started to ebb as Castiel took this moment to heal him.
Cas raised and eyebrow
Lucifer looked all night long, and upon the sun rising the next morning, around the halls quickly and spotted the young knight named Inias from Castiel's garrison.
Finally though he allowed the blond demon, or Lilith, as her passport stated, passage and with a flick of the reigns she pulled through the gates.
"OH! Michael Barnes! He's your brother in law?" Dean laughed motioning for Castiel to follow him into the garage
Alistair grinned and licked his lips before glancing at Abaddon.
Something wasn't settling in Sam's gut. His father called it the 'Winchester Intuition' and it wasn't something to be ignored. Shaking his head to clear it Sam took in a deep breath through his nose, inhaling the salty cold scent of the Enochian Sea. The distinct smell of neutral Alpha that the guards gave off, and then Gabriel's lingering scent that had something about it Sam couldnâ€™t pin down. All he knew was it calmed him, and didn't feel Alpha, Sam pushed the thoughts from his head, the wind whipping his cloak around his legs, hair brushing his face as he turned back towards the Castle.
"Okay okay I shouldn't of started it."
"After you Dean."
Something flickered in the Angel's eyes, his eyes flicked between Dean and the unconscious fading angel behind him. The rain seemed to lighten, but the thunder boomed with the shattering of Dean's heart
"It is under control, so deep breaths, you look nice Son." John whispered back as the double doors were swung open by guards, everyone stood, and the music began.
What did Lilith mean 'there are bigger plans for you' and why did she give off such an unsettling vibe?
It was a reaction Castiel had not expected, his feelings were strange, muddled, he didn't know what he was feeling, but while they didn't feel wrong exactly they still didn't feel right and it made him feel guilty in Michael's presence.
"What? You think I wanted you two to fight? You think I wanted to lose another child? Clearly you are delusional past your attraction to Lucifer!"
Castiel blinked several times behind his thick black glasses that reminded Dean of your stereotypical nerd type.
"I won't knot you Dean. Not until you're ready. The agreement says we have two years before an heir has to he conceived." Michael explained trying to swallow the nervous lump
"I can play with Uncle Sammy?" He asked pointing in the window of Bobbyâ€™s shop where his uncle Sam was talking
Kellie was so taken aback that she actually punched his arm with her free hand until he moved a step back from her.
He wasn't in love with Dean. But he did consider himself to be Dean's friend at least, the Omega was something else for sure, he wasn't shy, he would fight anyone if the need arose, even Alphas. He was sarcastic and brash. He was the opposite of any Omega that Michael had ever met.
He watched as Cas dug around in their catch all drawers and pulled out candles of various scents, brands, shapes, and sizes before he set them over the counter and little island they had, he them carefully lit all of them with a look of total and complete concentration.
"Listen Michael. Abaddon tried to have me killed due to a scandal. The blackmailing failed you could say. She wanted the throne and I faked her assassination attempt as successful so that I could lay low. Hell is in Chaos with her at the throne. Not a ounce of civility among them!" Crowley hit his fist on the armrest of his chair and shifted to lean his chin on his hand "Help me get back on the throne, and by gones can be bygones. /Besides/" Crowley cooed pretending to look at his fingernails before only his eyes flicked back to Michael "I know someone with a bit of magic to help assist with the struggles you're facing."
The day had started as any other, a quick meeting with his future father in law, checking on troops,settling affairs of citizens.Â  Why a werewolf family and a human family couldn't just build a fence was beyond him, he didn't understand how such a simple solution needed to involve the King...
With a groan Dean tried to roll his shoulders, only to discover that his hands were bound. So were his feet, something else was tied around his chest, and he was in a chair. When his emerald gaze finally cleared he focused on the room aroung him it appeared to be a typical barren room with peeling wall paper, carpet under his feet, stained and musty smelling, a bed was tucked in the corner with what looked like fresh sheets and blankets, two lamps stood proudly opposite eachother in corners of the room, a small tv nestled on some stand or desk stacked against the wall, it was on but quiet.
Chuck had tried to cheer his sons up, but it hadn't worked. They had all averted eye contact and went on in silence.
"Benny was it?"
Dean nodded in agreement
"It does not matter." The Prince replied simply to which Lucifer growled
Michael pushed his words out of his mind and took a deep breath, exhaling the Crowned Prince opened his eyes, they seemed to glow a calm icy blue. His wings shifted, one foot slid back, he spun his sword before addressing Raphael
"I'm not okay Sam."
"This one did." Dean muttered quietly
Lucifer caughed as the chains fell from him, his wings popping out from their bent position into what would be considered almost the resting position of wings.
Neither Winchester said anything, but the look they exchanged said it all. Everything stood on whether or not Michael would win, or lose.
"You don't mean that. Y-you don't actually mean that Dean. I'm the one, I'm the one you're supposed to love!"
"That's my line Dean. You're the assbutt."
"Let's face it. We're going to be sharing a bed anyway." He pushed the dark wood door open and stepped inside.
"Watch your mouth boy!" The demon, as Dean could now see raised her hand and slapped the opposite cheek "You are not to speak to your Master like that."
Castiel rolled his eyes with a huff
"I am."
Dean burst into the office, happy to be in a place with moving cool air, nothing like the humidity of the late summer New Orleans air outside. The Winchester gave a little nod, wink and tipped his hat to the lady secretary at the front desk, she giggled and hid her lipstick smile behind a delicately manicured hand before turning back to the large phone on her desk. Strutting through, Dean didn't bother to pay anyone else mind. He just wanted to know why the hell his uncle was giving him a partner. So his last one had quit, said Dean was too overbearing and while he solved the cases he was given, was too immature to be paired with the older man. Dean couldn't give less shit. The guy he had been paired with, just didn't like the crowd Dean danced with, and didn't like that Dean got all the attention from the dames in any joint they swung into.
"Where is King Winchester? I'd like to speak to him." Michael piped up as Dean gave the Alpha an odd questioning look
"Your Prince asked you a question. He expects an answer." Lucifer growled his wings fluffed, all six blood red and pink tinted wings twitched in aggression
"I'm so sorry your Majesty, I will stop the flirting, and the joking, I do get my work done I promise. Lord Roman was just jesting when he said I was impossible. I promise just-"
"It's Castiel. Not Alpha, I'm not your Alpha Dean." Castiel's voice was soft, deep and calm like rolling waves.
The Alpha gaurd followed with out a word as Dean made it to his room, Dean didn't talk to the gaurd, and the tall burly gaurd, a human that his father had sent, said nothing in return.
Dean stood still and put his arms up or down when requested. He did not like how artificial and sweet the Beta demons scent was, it tickled his nose and made him uncomfortable. Then there was her fake ass dark red smile and her clicky red nails. At one point during the early afternoon Michael had to leave for an appointment and that left Lilith and Dean along... Dean secretly wanted the Alpha to come back and stay, but he would never admit it to anyone.
Still not edited I hope the flow of the chpater is OK
Gabriel paused outside a set of beautifully carved light wood, marble and silver doors, as was the theme of most of the castle.
Dean cracked his eyes open and lifted his head slowly, he didn't want a repeat of the sudden pain and nausea caused by him whipping his head around.
If his fiance decided to keep the child, Michael would help him raise it, if he decided to carry the child and hand it over for adoption, Michael would ensure that the best possible family took the child in, if he decided it was to much and he couldn't do it and abortion washers right way to go, Michael would be with him through the process.
"You're an assbutt."
"Please!" The woman squeaked and Lycifer immediately let go of the Omega woman and began to Apologize
Castiel relaxed slightly and avoided his brother's whiskey gaze. He should have better control of his emotions, he always generally was good at keeping his emotions in check, not letting them leak into his scent...
Breath out.
"Why would either of you say that though?" Sam frowned. He was so extremely confused about why Gabriel's brother would be so cruel and say something that was considered highly offensive.
"I simply wanted to congratulate the victor of the duel." The tall esteemed looking woman purred as she stepped in. Her eyes flicked black as she held her head up, horns poking from her neatly done updo in a regal way "I am-"
"We have tea, and go riding, every Saturday that I am home. Though right now she and her father are on holiday in the cooler regions." Sam explained as Dean tapped his shoulder signaling his little braided crown was finished. The Alpha now had a braid on either side of his head, connecting at the back of his head and held by a loose ribbon Dean had had with him.
Dean paused outside his room again, took a deep breath and entered. Setting the water on the table stand by his bed the Omega removed Castiel's coat and his shirt, examining himself in the mirror. He supposed for being barely fed for four months he wasn't totally skin and bones, there was a slight bit of pudge to his stomach.
"It's possible Dean. You were in heat, forced to stay that way for months... And you know that Omega's are more susceptible to pregnancy when in heat. That's the entire purpose of heats." Sam kept his voice calm, kept his scent calm. Dean was already stressed and in enough pain that Sam didn't want to make anything worse
Just time to feel normal. To forget the last month, to forget what was said to him, done to him.
"Thank god the calvary!" Dean groaned at the sound of his Castiel's voice vibrated what felt like off the very walls of the dingy motel.
He exited her room and took a deep breath. He needed to think, he was sure Dean had been taken, afterall the mingled scents of sudden fear and Alpha anger had been all over the hallway.
Michael and Dean ended up both laying side by side in the long warm grass of the little forest clearing, staring up at the clouds and blue of the sky.
"Come with me my King." Lucifer finally spoke and pulled Michael away from the horses and behind the stable building
Dean was fbe last Winchester to leave the room, and if John noticed the mouthed 'thank you' directed at the Alpha angel, and finger twitch from Dean's hand he didn't say anything.
Forcing his wings to shake and flex he let out a sigh as his wing woke up.
"Leave. Castiel go to your chambers and wait. You will not be participating in the search party, and you will wait for further command. You are a Prince of Heaven and you have acted rudely, and disgracefully in the presence of a guest." Michael's tone was flat and his head was held high.
Seeing Lucifer in pain hurt.
"Perhaps. But I thought Enochians were proud creatures that cannot stand to lose."
Upon opening the door to the bedroom Michael frowned and became worried as all that he found was a neatly made bed and dark room.
But he couldn't help who he was stuck as.
"Your Highness, please calm down, fear is in your scent and people are going to notice." Lucifer looked around and his eyes caught Sam's "Do you want your brother?"
Gabriel paused, his hands smoothing gently over the feathers slowed to a halt.
A child that would carry and birth Michael's children, be there for Michael at the end of a long day, have the title of Michael's mate and husband.
"Is that true?" Despite the anger that filled Michael, his voice came out that of a scared young boy, a whispered question through the answer rang clear in the Witche's loud announcement and thick Scottish accent.
"I want you to help me, kill Abaddon and return to the throne. Preferably /not/ in a full blown war, as we haven't even been eight months of peace yet." Crowley swirled his wine glass as his red eyes met Michael's icy ones "I want Lucifer to help. He's highly capable."
"Brother, Lucifer, listen- we have our hands in the bank system already. Let the talking die down," he pleaded, sighing deeply as he saw Gabriel leaning in the doorway.
"I think it's a Wichester attraction to Novaks. Afterall, Adam did finally ask to Date Samandriel. Though Alfie was a bit insecure about it at first."
Balthazar's wings twitched impatiently and the moment the doctor finished the poor beta man was pushed out the door by the sandy blond Prince.
He knew this day would come eventually. He had only prayed to whatever force was out there that it wouldn't be this soon.
It felt like a sharp rock made it's way down Dean's throat as the young Human swallowed. A sense of dread and fear settled in the pit of his stomach in the existence of a little life.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
None of this was actually. Sure it was hot. The power went out, and the AC didn't work. But it was nice. Just Dean and him against the world.
Dean let out a startled yell as his chair hit the floor and his head bounced off the concrete.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Gabriel patted Michael on the shoulder, his gold wings twitched and he gave a curt nod.
Whatever it wasn Michael really just wanted to talk to Dean some more. The Omega was, well he was fascinating, besides, he wanted to get to know Dean as a person, before they were married. He already knew the Omega had a fascination with the color blue, had a MAJOR sweet tooth, well he loved pie, and took beautiful care of his pure black horse, Baby, whom the King of Earth brought withÂ  them upon their arrival in Heaven.
He wanted to wake up from this, to wake up from all of it and be in his room at home. Not tied to a chair, in heat, blindfolded, being startled by every noise wondering when that wretched Alpha was going to take him against his will. The stress was horrible!
Cas mentally lectured himself about how wrong he was to have such feelings for someone promised to another, for someone promised to his brother and his future King, It was wrong and he disgusted himself at the very thought. This wasn't some teen romance novel about some wealthy young Alpha scooping away the beautiful Omega and living happily ever after, this was real life. No fantasy about any of it.
Dean, knowing Michael's feelings more now, knew that it must be hard for him to not haveucifer nearby for this. Details as to the General's mission were not given to him, other than that it was for revenge of the crown.
Before the world went dark he saw Alistair, white eyes dangerous and holding a syringe
Dean was standing in front of the window staring out at the open and rolling dark winter water of the beautiful sea.
The Young Prince could feel the heat radiating from the Alpha and his wings.
Crowley gave a curt nod in acceptance, the family was seated, Sam as well but Dean was a no show.
Dean had moved over to stand beside his brother. A hand over his mouth as he stared down into the little battlefield. There was blood everywhere, the smell of it made his stomach churn and he swore he would be sick.
"I don't know if I.can /do this/... Maybe ome day but. I don't even /know/ my options." Dean whined beginning to sweep again a bit aggressively
Yes, Michael was attractive and Dean got along with him...
"This, brother this I cannot share with you. It's-it's to much and I can't." Castiel looked down at the ground as his wings shuffled and he straightened up. A scowl graced his face and his scent was more aggressive then what Michael was used to smelling coming off of his rather peaceful baby brother.
Castiel smirked as he leaned a hand on the back of the chair over Alistair's shoulder, he smirked a little more when the demon flinched. He was understanding why Lucifer enjoyed this.
"Dean you need to calm down!" Sam finally raised his voice slightly, it vibrated off the walls and in Dean's mind making him freeze and stare at his brother. Green eyes wet and wide with so many conflicting emotions "This isn't something you can hide forever. Castiel, Michael, Dad? No one is going to be mad and upset. No one is going to look at you differently, I certainly don't. What's going to happen is everyone is going to understand what happened, understand that you had no control over what happened to you, and they're going to /help/ you." Sam's voice remained firm as his determined gaze locked with Dean's, hands gripping his brother's shoulders tightly as if Dean would disappear if he let go.
Moments like this made Michael want to leave it all and go live how he wanted, mated to whomever he pleased in a wood cottage. Safe and carefree of Kingly duties for the rest of his long life.
Here's why, on Wattpad due to the age average of my readers I keep the chapters between 1,200 and 1,500 words.
"Sorry. Sorry I just-just"
"It's fine. Just never direct a growl at me and we'll be alright... Also stand straight. You're a Prince and future King afterall." Dean noted as his younger brother stopped his slouching.
So why take the Prince?
"You're hogging the pillow!"
"My, my, Winchester, you do know how to party, don't ya." Mike laughed, shaking the previous thought off as he usually did. It was not at all new to the grey eyed detective to be part of homophobic humor since that was just the way to go, even gays went along to not cause any drama. "Ain't nothing wrong with a little acting here and there." he smiled, grabbing his hat.
"Already the bond between Alpha and Omega is blooming! Keep it up boys and I may be an uncle before the wedding!" Gabriel cheered
How could his own brother say that? How could an Archangel that he had grown up with, helped care for, helped raise, say such a horrible thing?
"Only if I can gave your ass for dessert!"
"So girls are easier to potty train?"
Abaddon's smile fell and her fake sympathy vanished
Sam pulled Dean into his chest and ran his fingers through his big brother's hair. Dean had used to do the same when he would have nightmares, and when Adam would get scared, and with Dean moved here to get married Sam would do this to help Adam to calm down.
"Michael? I know a few Michaelâ€™s, which one?"
For Michael and Lucifer the entire world seemed to stop in a single moment. That kiss behind the stables, as their hearts beat insync to eachother would forever be in their minds and very souls.
Dean bit back a whimper as he heard the door scrape open and the sound of heels clack up and stop in front of him.
"Your Majesty." She bowed at first, then frowned and gave a curtsey and small nervous smile
"I'm sure you can find time to talk to him tonight." Benny added keeping himself alert, scanning the bushes, paths and trees for any potential threat
"Gabriel," Sam took the other Alpha's hand and examined the immediately bruising and swelling knuckles "Come on, Let's get you some ice?" It came out as more of a question as Sam looked around unsure of where the kitchen had disappeared to in the maze of hallways
"Grab two cups out would ya?"
"How did you know it had to do with the wedding?"
Gurgling around blood, tears in her eyes, red hair a fiery mess around her face, the black faded from her eyes as she looked up at Dean.
"Me? Does it matter what I think?" Adam shifted enough to look up at Castiel before facing forward, staring intently at the wings that enveloped the two Princes "He doesn't seem happy about getting married and... He has this coat in his room that smells like you, he though he hid it but I found it. He talks about you a lot to Sam also. He said that Michael is his friend, but he doesn't want to marry him. I guess I Don't want Dean to marry an old guy he doesn't love."
"I know. But for once I thought maybe you would tell me what to do. I have many options and I don't know which one is right." The freckled prince chewed his bottom lip as further worry set in "I will have the decision made by the wedding... I promise."
Lucifer growled and glared at her which made the Omega squeak and take a step back.
The Young Alpha turned to the Beta Werewolf woman that was standing and shaking off to the side, the prostitute was obviously terrified, as her client was shoved into a wall by an Archangel and a Prince of Heaven
Sam shrugged before his eyes widened and his head whipped to look at Dean. Even though the Omega's back was to him, their eyes locked in the mirror
His eyelids felt so heavy and suddenly his chest plate and arm guards were gone, than the armor over the arch of his wings was gone.
"It doesn't matter. You are the ruler of my life already."
Sam would make them beg for Death. He would make them wish they never laid a hand on his brother, and Sam wasn't stupid, his brother was an Omega, he figured out a portion of what most likely happened. The person responsible would pay dearly for ever messing with his family.
Michael sat on the table, hands in his lap staring at them intently. He was shirtless and bandaged, silent as his icy eyes avoided his brother's
Gabriel's wings moved a little bit as he tilted his head and looked back up at the painting as he resumed standing
Right.
Michael flexed his messy pure white wings, flecks of blood and dirt covered the wings but he knew it was fine. He would spend the time to wash all six of them when he returned home.
"You're married to him." The angel ground out between clenched teeth. Suddenly one of his hands slammed into the back of the chair beside Dean's head and the hunter got the first glance at the chain dangling around the Angel's neck, it was a leather blood stained necklace, with a familiar amulet and a silver men's ring, not silver, angel blade metal. The same as the one that both Dean and his Angel wore. Dean could almost feel the phantom weight of that necklace around his neck, the leather against his neck, and amulet resting against his chest.
"Come now." Castiel whispered as his wings moved from Dean and flapped slightly before settling behind his back. The Prince lifted the slightly taller Omega to his feet and smiled sadly "I can fly you up to your room, or I can walk with you."
No response. Dean listened closely hearing hushed whispering and the jingle of his dog's collar
"It's beautiful really." Dean gave the Alpha a small smile. Really marrying Michael couldn't be so bad right? They had already shared a somewhat intimate moment, what was a lifetime of them?
Adam scrunched his eyebrows together, obviously not believing Dean, but saying nothing outloud. Though Dean was sure he could hear the wheels turning in his baby brother's head.
The note was sent three days ago. They would be arriving tonight.
"Ah! Miranda my dear! Let the cooks and Pops know that Castiel and I will be out for dinner on business, we will be back late or not at all until morning."
This wasn't how his brother acted.
"We shall see you in a month Dean."
All cor seemed to be drained from the Omega's bruised and cut face
The maid bit her lip and Dean knew she was biting back a laugh. Amusement poured from her scent and it only made him upset. Of course she would laugh at him. He was clueless in a castle and kingdom he had barely seen any of, and she'd been there during one of his hearts. He hated those horrid weeks that happened every month. It only made him feel like a needy whore.
The moment the screams of pain halted Castiel turned to the door and raised and eyebrow at Lucifer, his wings automatically raising slightly in challenge to the other Alpha's threatening pheromones.
"It's because of me is it not? Because they assume you, an Alpha Archangel and Prince, may or may not have feelings for a-a rude, arrogant, selfish Alpha General that was raised in Hell. I am nothing. Whomever challenged you should know that-" Lucifer paused and in a quick instinct that was embedded in his very bones said something irrational and hasty "He should know that the only thing between us is professionalism. If this means I cannot be a friend to you, so be it." Lucifer narrowed his eyes "I hope they know the only feelings I have for you, are Platonic." The words hurt like knives as they left Lucifer's lips.
"He loves someone else and Michael does as well. Chuck can't you see that or are you really that blind?" John growled slammed a fist down on the table to get the Angel to look at him "I have a feeling you know why that is the case already."
That is just what he wanted.
"Ah your Highness." Benny bowed moving from where he had placed himself between Dean and the angel
"Good night brother." He straightened up and headed down the hall to his room with his chin up and a sliver of anger in his harsh scent.
Lucifer's horse was gone, as was the horses armor.
"Oh? Yes sorry Father I-I'm alright." Dean stammered his tongue felt so thick in his mouth and his throat ran drier then the fields of Hell.
Dean looked up with wide eyes as he noticed Michael's presence.
"All of this. All of this for some heavy ass gold to wear? For an uncomfortable chair to sit in? To hold the lives of countless beings in the palms of your hands? All of this, to hold the word on why and when and where to go to war? To put more people's lives in the dirt? For a little bit of land? More heavy gold? To prove that you can? It all seemed so unlike you brother. You were a man of the people once. What changed?"
"Red String" has been a fantastic part of the lady 2 years, and I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed reading it. It's been an adventure for sure, especially if you've been with me since the very beginning. You've endured my inconsistent update schedule and writers block, but also my chapter spam weeks, and on a roll times. We've been through a lot together.
Castiel raised his hand and left four hard and loud, demanding knocks on the door.
"You're a son of a bitch you know that?"
Cas did move away and wiped the sweat from his brow with a smirk
Michael looked stunned for just a second, a look of terror came over Balthazar, Gabriel shrank back biting back a laugh. Michael made eye contact across the table at Dean, smirked and took a handful of grabs and cheese cubes and hurled it right at the Omega.
"This is Jack. My husband's little demon spawn but I love him just the same. He just turned one." Michael chuckled as Castiel was suddenly beside him and taking Jack from his arms as the little boy squealed fot his uncle
"You want what I hope will turn into a slushie?"
He had been dreadfully wrong
"I have my reasons and they're private."
Dean chuckled and hit his brother in the shoulder
"Yes."
Michael's features and wings relaxed and his scent calmed.
The Winchester wasted job time sliding into the hole, trying not to injure himself, angel blade clutched in his fist a lifeline of sorts.
"Dean you gonna come in or stare off into space all night?" Sam's voice rang out tinged with laughter and something else Dean didn't feel like examining.
Sam barely moved out of the way as the marble let out a dull thud and loud crack in the quiet hallway.
"Is that a fondness in your eyes I see? A caring softness to your voice?" Charlie sang with a small little laugh "You care highly for him?"
"Cas I-"
Lucifer already knew that he would never have Michael so why fight it?
"Why are you looking for her?"
"Don't call me that shortie." Lucifer laughed
Michael nodded, tried to smile. But he didn't know for sure if he was right. He had no idea if everything was /actually/ going to he ok or not, he didn't know if Dean would ever fully be ok.
Michael looked back where Raphael had halted his assualt. Chest heaving and eyes rimmed with furious Alpha red
But Michael had to admit, for as nervous as Dean smelled, he looked calm and, rather Alpha like. He even spoke like an Alpha.
"Fine. I knew. That storming night when the Witch was summoned, when she revealed my Red String of Fate, I didn't just see mine, I saw everyone's. Gabriel had none, Balthazar's reached far away, Raphael's was broken, and yours!? Yours was the hardest to swallow! Yours strung across the room, clear as day to where your friend and our newest knight stood watch at the door. Surely, Surely; I thought the real True Mate of my Alpha son, the real True Mate for the Future of Heaven had to be passed that door, she had to be. But it wasn't. It was tied to THAT THING!" Chuck swung an accusing finger across the room behind Michael to where Lucifer was sitting, barely conscious, trying to stay awake. Limbs limp at his sides, wings on the floor, the General's head lulled to one side causing Gabriel and Sam to try and keep the Alpha awake
Nothing.
A sorrowful smile came on Michael's face as he looked over what was left of his army. Almost a third of the thousands were left standing.
In fact maybe he had been expecting an unexpected kind of reaction such as he had received from Castiel.
Castiel did not seem amused as he furrowed his eyebrows with a tilt of his head
Dean simply stood beside the Archangel and followed as he led them down the marble hallway and up a carpeted set of stairs. The stairs curved and led them up as Dean counted Twenty-five of them before they reached a small hallway leading to a door.
"Take a breather, Cohen, you make me rethink my decision to let you carry iron in public." Bobby replied, unfazed by his detective's temper tantrum at all. "Go for a smoke, Mike. And once you're done, sit your ass back in that chair and find out a way to get me the Devil. Don't make me send you back to your old police department."
With Love -
"Behold little Prince, the room known as the Queen's Study." He pushed open the doors wide as he folded his four large wings close to his body and smiled widely.
Castiel's eyes darted around trying to find them. He had spent to long since coming to this world trying to locate the hunter, finding odd deaths that could've been supernatural, hitting dead ends, running into other hunters on the cases. He needed Dean, and he needed a location.
It all ended to soon.
One thing he knew he wouldn't like about this kingdom was it was colder then what he was used to, he was tanned and freckled from days in the sun and summers in the woods. In the winter it rained, never snowed, here it was Spring time and he was shivering.
Gabriel stared at Crowley for a few moments trying to wrap his head around how easily the Fallen King had told him where this Rowena the Witch was. Feeling it unwise to press the Alpha on his true intentions for supposedly righting wrongs, the golden feathers Archangel bowed with a small thank you and hurried off.
The cellar door was ripped from its latches and thrown to the side. Castiel glared at the steps leading below and quickly entered, angel blade ready and wings perked in readiness.
"Enough out of you." She sighed, rolling her brightly decorated eyes "The King will decide what to do with you. As I'm sure everyone present, including Foreign Royalty may agree you are unfit to continue to rule." The Witch snapped when the angel tried to speak "Restrain him!" Her accented voice thundered through the room making Angel Gaurds do as they were ordered
"Marry me."
Both Alphas headed down different hallways to their rooms.
Dean and Castiel held hands, staring over the ocean a couple of weeks after the failed wedding of Michael and Dean. They weren't married yet, but would be very soon. They decided they would wait until Lucifer was well enough to leave his bed and attend.
"Alright Cas. We'll see you at Dinner." Dean forced a tiny soft smile to tug the corners of his mouth
Once everything Officially sunk in, Michael would be furious. Dean was sure of it.
Dean shook his head as he stood still chest to chest with Castiel. He needed to move, but he didn't wantÂ  to move at all.
Lucifer hurried to the library without hesitation. He wasn't waiting long before Gabriel, Michael and Castiel quickly came in.
"Prince? What's wrong?" Lucifer asked scanning the boy's face. The Archangel hoped it was simply fear for Michael's predicament
"Benny-" Dean's voice tampered into a whisper, lulling the necklace out he gripped the smooth pendant in his hand, pressing a kiss to it as a tear slipped down his cheek "I can't go through with this.I thought I could pretend. I thought I could force myself to go through with the wedding, with ensuring peace, but it hurts. It fucking hurts so damn much, it's hurting Me, it's hurting Castiel, it's destroying Michael, and Lucifer when he's here can barely stand to look at me. We need to stop this."
Lucifer smiled his own eyes watering as he leaned into the Crowned Prince's touch with closed eyes and a hum
"No. It's for my brother, Castiel."
Michael didn't know what to say to that. It was true, the headstrong, speak your mind, fight the world Dean he had grown to care about wasn't the scared, submissive and frightened person he had just talked to.
His tan wings ruffled as he straightened up and he shot a smile at Dean
"No."
"Good morning." Sam spoke to the gaurd as he set his shoulders and met the other human's eyes. Sam was a mere inch or two shorter than the burly man, but he felt in his knees that would be changing soon
Crowley's red eyes narrowed before he leaned back more looking to Michael
Still Dean didn't immediately see anyone and that concerned him greatly.
Mike sighed deeply as he seemingly weighed Dean's suggestion. "I'm not aware of any women in this story. Far as we know this family's sealed shut completely. But, if we find out which bar they own we might find out a little more about the barkeeper's boss." Mike suggested promptly after Dean tossed the pile of paper on their shared desk.
Michael still bid the others goodnight and tried to hold himself high as he exited the dining room to head to bed. All the while with a heavy heart.
"Oh I-I'm so sorry Gabriel I-"
He had his arms crossed over his chest and groaned internally at how careless they seemed to be about his belongings.
"No, no books this time, even though Lieutenant Singer might hate us for it, I won't let some old detective gum our work just so we did our job the way chapter 59 suggests." he smiled, trying to subtly change the topic. Dean looked a slight bit upset by Singer's comment - but that relationship was to be asked about at a later time.
Michael looked back up ever so slightly at Lucifer.
Michael was about to speak when suddenly Castiel snapped.
The Omega kept thinking perhaps there was a chance here, maybe it wouldn't be horrible to marry him.
Omegas don't rule anything.
"Are you alright? You're crying."
Frankly Lucifer couldn't care less. Omegas were just well, Omegas. He had always been taught they are to been seen, not heard, and were mainly for status and sex uses. Really that was it.
"Dean?"
"Hey guys." Gabriel smirked eyes flicking between their intertwined hands before slipping back to the Enochian of his book.
"You're tired. Why I was challenged doesn't matter."
The air was so incredibly thick, no one dared to breath. Everyone waited with baited breath as Dean made his appearance. For a majority of the Kingdom, this was the first time they had seem their future Queen, Dean was still bruised to Hell, but the swelling around his eye had gone done today. The purple had begun it's transition into green and yellow.
"I am going to check the guards and knights. Check over the list of wedding planners arriving tomorrow and inform the gate guards to check for credentials before allowing anyone in." The young Alpha straightened up and nodded to his two older brothers before turning the corner and hurrying away.
Michael's head snapped up to gaze at Sam. His cheeks burning with a blush but Sam just smiled sadly
With the library door in sight, they were almost there when Castiel turned a corner, meeting Dean and Adam in the middle of the hallway.
"Cassie!" He knocked on the roof of his car "Remind me to get one of those, maybe a red one." He laughed
"Yes sir!" Dean grinned at Bobby before turning back to the old coffee stained file Michael had slid over to him. Dean raised an eyebrow as he looked at the man's photo. This Loki character had a sly grin, shifty eyes and long golden hair, slicked back, framing a smug face.
Michael frowned and placed a hand on Dean's shoulder, hating the flinch he saw "Dean, it's ok. I promise."
"Join us for dinner Crowley. I am open to your proposal." The Archangel Prince finally said with an authority that had Lucifer quickly Excuse himself, feeling the need to blow of steam of any kind really.
"I apologize I couldn't come to you sooner Michael." Chuck spoke with a deep sigh, worry seemed permanent on the King's face
"Come in!" Dean called as the door slowly opened and a Beta maid peeked her head in.
Dean's face flushed with embarrassment, body shifting from foot to foot as his eyes dropped to his father's shined and polished shoes
The two kings and queen exited the room and Michael stood.
"But uhm, take me the long way so I'm not seen mkay? Mkay come on." Dean spoke quickly as he slipped out and headed down the hall, Benny close behind.
Dean would never admit he liked forward kisses, and the he didn't mind who they came from. Michael seemed to real in his words that part of Dean wanted to believe him, wanted to believe that the Archangel could raise another man's child, but the rest of Dean continued to say that deep down, all Alpha's were the same and Michael would make him get rid of the baby... Dean wanted to keep the baby, at least he thought he did. He really didn't know. Having the baby would be a constant reminder of what had happened to him, the child would even carry aspects of its father's scent, and Dean found himself knowing that wouldn't be good for his own mental state. But if he didn't keep the baby, gave it up for adoption, he would live life wondering if the child was happy, loved, taken care of. If he got an abortion he didn't know how he would feel.
"Was I not invited?!" Her voice rang out filled with bitter hate, horns glinting in the light of the chandelier, red hair atop her head in a curled bun, loose curls framing her pale face, lips painted red as her black eyes fixed themselves on Dean and Michael at the Alter across the room "No one invited the Queen of Hell? To a Royal wedding? How incredibly rude!" Laughter bubbled like acid from her painted lips, a smile stretching her mouth wide and sinister as the Alpha Woman stepped into the room. Long black dress kissing the long petal covered carpet with its brush of death.
"As you all know there is a law, an ancient law placed by the beginning of time, a True Mates Law!" She announced making her way up the couple of stairs to stand before everyone on the alter. Long purple gown barely brushing the floor as rhe Omega Witch held the attention of every person there, wedding goers and demon soldiers. "Witches are blessed with Magic, something angels and demons can almost possess, and Humans think they can." She continued even though she was a human herself. "Years ago, having a Witch Reveal Ones True Mate was normal, encouraged."
He spoke blinking a few times his voice quiet
"I'm a strange Omega alright." He paused "What about you?"
"I said don't!" Dean yelled standing up straighter and jerking away from Sam
"Prince Dean," Lucifer spoke quietly and softly as he didn't want to frighten him
The young Prince's nostrils were flared, his pupils dilated with fear, trained on a face across the arena.
"You, are now going to tell me where the Omega is, or I'm gonna have some fun." Lucifer smirked in such a way that made Alistair's body begin to shake and his scent fill with fear as Lucifer's eyes seemed to glow a deadly red
The young Alpha cleared his throat and went about laying old and new maps out
Also like before mentioned I know squat shit about New Orleans, I'm from Indiana. My writing partner is from Switzerland and my editor is from Singapore... Enjoy this chapter
"Is everything alright?" Michael added as he walked alongside Castiel. He remembered what had happened with Gabriel the other day and was very curious about what they had been speaking about.
This could just be fake. Michael would change his mind, Dean was sure of it.
They had been drifting for a while, but now he was gone
"Good morning little angel." Crowley smiled "In a hurry?"
"Come on guys. Emma your Mom is gonna be pissed and then Grandpa Bobby is gonna give Daddy a fucking earful for being late to work"
Shaking the naughty thoughts that came up from his filthy mind and fishing it from the gutter he jumped up to see what Cas was up to.
Michael didn't respond to his father's words, but they did cut deeply. His father had been Doubting his ability to lead. Because that was what Michael needed to hear right now...
"I said. Get. The fuck. Out." Dean ground out, green eyes filled with pain that Castiel just wanted to take away.
"You need to take a deep breath Brother."
Lucifer narrowed her eyes at her and immediately hated how her horns curled around and under her ears, how her leathery wings twitched with impatience, and how she kept tapping her long red painted nails on her knee.
Dean nodded in a jerky movement and closed his eyes as a tear fell down his jaw
"Regardless you are in succession to be King. It is only polite to bow to you young Winchester." Castiel continued as he shifted his weight, his arms at his sides awkwardly
"You done filling out all your information?"
"I'm sorry Lucifer. It's just, I'm 28. I will be King soon, my marriage is arranged, the date is set... My future husband is only 18... He is practically still a child and I just..."
"I'm fine." Dean cut Michael off. Finally tearing his forest gaze from the treeline to meet the warm ice of Michael's eyes "I will be fine to still marry you."
"I told you I got lost in this dumbass castle. Now, if you'll just point me in the direction I need, then I will not need to put up with you, or anyone, any further." Dean snapped back crossing his arms as well. No way was some Alpha with wings the color of Blood with pink hues going to scare him off.
No words were needed. Dean could see the look on Michael's face. He didn't want to hurt his brother, but he could not let his people, or Dean be governed by such a cruel angel.
Michael chuckled, wings shuffling behind his back, he leaned to his side to whisper to Dean
"Your Majesty, your Highness, my Princes." The human rambled off with an out of breath bow before thrusting her hand out to Michael.
Sam gripped his cup a little tighter and couldn't suppress the growl that rumbled his chest.
His eyes widened slightly and he cleared his throat as a hand went to nervously rub the back of his neck "Forget it I got carried away..."
Michael relaxed slightly and yawned before shaking his head for the millionth time that day.
It had to be some sick joke, the angel felt his chest tighten and his eyes were wet, his vision was blurred with anger and a sorrow so deeply rooted in his face he couldn't stand it. Burning him from the inside, mocking at his pain. He blinked out of his rage at the sound of cracked wood accompanied by the soft crack of glass. Blinking the fury from his eyes he glared down at the photo, he had broken the frame in his hands causing the glass to crack.
The only noise was the trembling shuffle of Lucifer's feathers, and the light hiccups coming from Michael
If a guy like Dean was to approach, well, anyoneâ€¦ people would stop what they were doing and help, talk, greet him, watch. However, it was obvious Dean knew exactly how good he looked- another little problem Michael tried very hard to hide. The raven-haired man with his fair skin and captivatingly light eyes wasn't just a very devoted, dutiful, rational detective with no time to flirt or sleep around. He simply couldn't bring himself to like the physical company of a woman. And God forbid if this ever got to anyone's attention Mike would lose his badge, his gun and probably anything else he owned.
And it felt like absolute shit.
"Hey!" He exclaimed turning a glare to Sam.
Charlie raised and eyebrow before closing her mouth and shaking her head
Dean immediately looked away from Michael and shifted his weight.
Dean let out a funny 'whoop' and Baby took off thundering out of the gates with a laugh from Dean
The second the door closed with a click Alistair looked to the Archangel with wide eyes as he realized what the Prince had just given permission for.
Really he felt a lot better. The Prince swung his legs over the side of the bed his feet hitting the fluffy rug. Castiel let out a startled gasp as a harsh needle like sensation ripped through his left wing
Without her makeup she looked a little less intimidating, her lips weren't actually the color of blood but a rather delicate pink, her eyes even whiter without the black eyeliner around them and her lashes were long and light.
Lucifer smiled a little wider, he felt so light, as if everything weighing him down everyday was gone for just a few moments, those moments with Kelly.
Bartered and traded for peace or wealth.
Michael nodded. It didn't even seem to cross his mind that his brother was up and about at such a late hour of the night, in fact he could care less. All he knew is his brother had centered him again
Dean moved to sit in an armchair, Castiel in the armchair beside them, hands still being held between them
"Hey Charlie." He grumbled as he hugged the sobbing maid to his chest and kissed the top of her head.
"I'm allergic enough."
"We know it has to be scary for you Dean."
"No actually I-I hate attention." He squeaked feeling all resolve fall away as his body protested otherwise. His scent filled the room with need and heat and if he wasn't trying to control himself before he was really fighting it now.
