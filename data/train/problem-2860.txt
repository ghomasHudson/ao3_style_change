That’s when Cas zapped back to reality, and for a moment he didn’t even realize that he was trembling and that tears were running down his face, or that Dean had startled awake at the worst part of his nightmare and was now staring at Cas with groggy eyes as he processed what he’d woken up to.
He looked back up at Cas with a somewhat shy expression which puzzled the angel for a moment, but then he remembered what Dean had said earlier in the hotel:
Finally Dean turned to look at him with a bemused expression. “You know, Cas, I’ve never met anyone as good at being as uncomfortably honest as you.”
Horrible memories started plaguing Castiel’s vision: Dean’s broken and pleading voice when Naomi had nearly forced Cas to kill him.
“It’s funny, isn’t it?” Sabrini asked rhetorically, ignoring Cas's pleas. "How things change. Certain events happen that change the essence of who one is, forever. For the last seventy years I went through such an event… similar to you, Castiel. Why, your experience with this hunter, this
seriously
’ He prayed again. ‘
.” It wasn’t only Dean’s heartbreak that Cas felt, but also his own guilt and regret because he remembered saying those exact words to the real Dean years ago.
Dean opened his mouth to argue but thankfully Sam cut in. “Dude, he’s a freaking
Cas remained completely serious when he replied, “Every day that I get to spend with you and Sam makes me incredibly thankful, Dean.”
Cas gripped the haft with a trembling hand and pulled the blade out, causing Sam to let out mangled, wet heaves and start to choke on his own blood. Cas threw the stained metal aside and placed his hand on Sam’s bloody stomach, willing any possible scrap of grace inside him to come forward through his fingertips.
Suddenly two hands were shaking his shoulders. “Cas! What’s wrong? What happened?” Dean’s concerned green eyes bore into Castiel’s teary ones, the nightmare obviously vanished from his mind as soon as he returned to consciousness and saw Cas in his current state.
Dean restrained him, the veins in his arms bulging from the tremendous effort. “Hurry up, Sam!”
Cas could hear the scuffle of fighting, but everything was becoming slurred and discombobulated around him and he couldn’t keep track of anything. “Shit!” Dean yelled, and then he was gone, out of Castiel’s view and jumping into the fight. Cas couldn’t judge how long this went on, as time seemed to move more strangely when one was on the verge of death. He heard Sam continue his chant in broken, winded streams as he dodged Sabrini’s relentless attacks. “Das keenu mann…. Abs altok exo!”
“Sammy!” Dean called. “We’re coming!”
A few moments passed as Cas decided what to say, because he needed Dean to understand that he
He desperately tried to move his limbs but found that he was chained up against a vertically standing metal board, the silver restraints laced with warding that made it impossible for him to break free. Cas jerked his head from side to side with wild eyes as he struggled, and he saw Sabrini's tall, lanky vessel to his left, his hands fiddling with a sickeningly familiar metal contraption… the same thing used by Naomi to erase Castiel’s memories, the same thing Crowley had used to dig his way into Sam’s skull and get to Gadreel. Intense fear overtook Cas at the prospect of what was coming.
Cas's eyes widened from shock as the screw lodged in his heart started to jerk randomly up and down, side to side, until Cas was sure his entire chest was going to explode. Sabrini’s eyes remained focused on the machine, skittering from left to right as he read whatever the monitor was conveying. No more sound was coming from Cas, for the pain was too great for a mere scream to do it any justice.
Why was this happening? Why did Sabrini, an angel that Cas hadn’t spoken to in four hundred years- or so he’d thought- want to hurt him? What did Cas unknowingly do that drove Sabrini to this point of evil insanity? “Don’t do this, Sabrini. Please,” Cas said again, in a tone as defeated as he felt.
Castiel!” Sabrini spat, his gray eyes blazing like a flashing thunderstorm. “You don’t realize how powerful we could have been! You were my brother. We could have ruled
Dean’s voice interrupted his ponderings. “You actually look like an angel for once.”
There was a crashing sound as the creaky door flew off its hinges and shards of wood flew everywhere.
Cas didn’t even want to know what he meant by that. What had happened to Sabrini and why he despised Castiel’s existence, he hadn’t the slightest clue, but this was not the same angel that Cas had fought beside centuries ago. The Sabrini in front of him had been tainted with something dark. His once pure and bright aura was now slithering with black, wormy shadows that left evil in their wake. “What happened… to you?” he asked faintly, perhaps as a distraction from the gripping fear of the unknown effects of the Hell that he was being put through, and a distraction from the pain, of course.
Finally Sam jerked to a sitting position with an incredible gasp, his hands going instinctively to where the blade had been plunged into his gut and where there was no longer any wound. He looked at Cas with bewildered eyes. Cas smiled weakly in satisfaction, and turned his head to meet Dean’s eyes.
Anyway, back to Castiel’s stupid mistake: there was an unexpected demon near the vampire nest last night, and since it had the element of surprise on it’s side, Cas only narrowly escaped an angel blade to the back. Luckily he turned around just in time. He quickly burned the abomination's  eyes out and took flight, and it was then that he stopped paying attention. For no more than five seconds he hovered in the hotel room, unseen by the brothers, who were each pouring themselves a shot of whiskey- he had kept himself hidden without even realizing it.
Another resounding
Dean smirked slightly. “Using my own words against me, huh? You know, you’re getting pretty good at this ‘human’ thing. It’s a little scary.”
going to die for the time being, he gratefully fell into a pain-free, narcotic-induced slumber.
The silence that followed this little speech was suffocating. Dean just looked at Cas through the mirror, slightly opened-mouthed, and Cas realized that once again his truthfulness had made Dean uncomfortable… Dean had said that honesty was always the best option, but perhaps it was different with certain situations such as this. Suddenly Dean turned around and walked over to stand squarely in front of him with such determination in his stance that Cas couldn’t bring himself to move. He steeled himself and tried to look Dean in the eyes with as much courage as he could scrap together, unsure of what was coming.
There was now blood seeping from Rowena’s nose in her trying battle to keep Cas's heart beating. The sparkling crystal started to vibrate and emit a tiny whining sound. She took two deep breaths and murmured in a distant voice, “It was close, boys.

Dean walked over to him, grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the bed. He sat down and forcefully tugged the angel’s hand to make him sit down beside him. Cas obeyed wordlessly and stared at Dean’s hand in his, floored at how an act so simple could feel so intimately terrifying. His heart sped up as he looked at Dean with wide, curious eyes, and Dean was biting his lip in that way that Cas always found unreasonably fascinating. Dean’s gaze was focused just over Castiel’s shoulder, far away and lost in thoughts that Cas wished he had the privilege to know, but after tonight Cas would work ten times harder to make sure he never,
Some part of him registered the fact that Sabrini was now detaching the screws from his body, still streaming invective but Cas couldn’t begin to tell you what was said. More and more grace swirled out of his body, and he felt closer to death at every escaped sliver.
.” And that was the scope of his ability to explain any further right now. He finally noticed how badly his body was shaking. Another symptom of the panic attack, he presumed, and wondered when this awful feeling would finally end.
This was when Cas decided to show himself, already feeling guilty about accidentally eavesdropping, and upon his sudden appearance Dean jumped and almost dropped his glass. “Dammit, Cas!”
superior
Cas's body then crumpled onto the ground and landed in a pool of his own blood. He didn’t have energy to move or even to make a sound, so he stayed in that unnatural and cramped heap while everything started going dark, and honestly it wasn’t awful. The pain started to ebb away until it was nothing but a background detail, and Cas looked forward to blacking out completely at this point, whether it be unconsciousness or death, he didn’t care anymore. In every way he was broken, and beyond ready to be done with
During the two-second flight, Cas felt a pinch in his neck and then passed out shortly after, falling into a dreamless, sort-of unconscious state that was difficult to describe. All he saw was pitch blackness, but he was also aware and alert of his body being thrown to the ground like a rag doll and vague metallic noises all around him, and then being whipped up and chained against a hard, cold surface. Castiel was there, but also not. The darkness enveloped him like black, icy water, and everything happening to his physical body felt like it was leagues away, closer to the surface of the murky sea while Cas
Without a second thought the angel leaped off of the thousand-foot building, and less than a second later he was bolting down the stairs of the bunker, mentally cursing the warding that kept him from getting straight to Dean.
“Cas!”
Cas was rendered speechless. He simply looked at the man before him in awe. Why Cas was the lucky enough angel to have this mysterious glitch inside him, to meet Dean and experience all of this, he’ll never know. Cas just knew how incredibly grateful he was that Dean Winchester, the righteous man with the most amazing soul Cas had ever seen, considered Cas a friend and was selfless enough to forgive Castiel’s endless wrong-doings, his long list of mistakes that had hurt Dean so deeply. At this point even more tears were rolling down Castiel’s cheeks, but he hardly noticed anymore.
to be abandoned and left to die. “No!” Cas moaned and  attempted to climb to his hands and knees, but it was as if gravity was working against him. “Dean! I’m coming!” he rasped and desperately tried to crawl his way across the concrete, but then Sam and the demon came back into focus and everything resumed at normal speed. Cas heard the sickening crack of Sam’s neck and curled into the fetal position from the overwhelming grief that it caused Dean. Cas tried yelling again, “No!” but nothing came out except a strangled breath…
Dean rolled his eyes at Castiel’s use of air quotes and replied, “I said, let’s head back to the bunker. It’s only a two hour drive and I don’t want to sleep in this hotel.”
“Don’t!” he yelled again. The chains started digging into the skin on his wrists and ankles with how hard he was trying to escape, red and purple circles of raw, bloody flesh.

sorry for being an asshole about it, ok? I’m sorry I made you want to leave.”
He actually flinched a little when Dean gently wiped a fallen tear. Cas opened his eyes to see Dean looking straight at him, his warm hand still on the angel’s cheek. Cas said in a quietly desperate tone, “After everything I’ve done to you, Dean, can you please just allow me to give you one night of peaceful sleep?”
A freezing wind gusted around Cas as he perched upon a random New York City skyscraper. Why he’d chosen this place to clear his head he didn’t know, but the terrible weather seemed fitting considering the situation. Castiel almost wished he could go back to the days when he was but a mere soldier with no emotions. Follow orders. Wait for more. Repeat. Such a simple existence.
“Rowena!” Dean snapped. “Why isn’t it working?”
This must be what being possessed felt like. Cas could see Sabrini right in front of him on that bloody beach. He could feel his own mouth talking and could even smell the rotten decay of the hundreds of corpses, but he had absolutely no control over what he said or did, because this was a memory, or perhaps a series of, and Cas had no choice but to sit back in his own head and watch them play out. He'd already tried to yell at his past self, “It’s

There was the same vertical, steel table with the warded chains, the same rickety shelf next to it containing numerous foreboding utensils, and the very drill that was lodging it’s screws into Cas's flesh at this very moment.
pieces
It was barely a graze of their lips, a feather-light touch that made Castiel’s insides burn with the longing he’d been pushing down ever since he’d saved Dean’s soul. Dean’s lips were rough and soft at the same time, and Cas could smell the faint odor of whiskey on them…
was sinking to the bottom. When Cas tried to scream it got caught in his throat, like a painful air bubble was blocking any sound from escaping. Cas could have been in this strange limbo for minutes, hours, days… Time seemed much more fluid here, where ever ‘here' was, and it gave Cas time to get well and truly frightened at his current situation, as well as confused at why this was happening.
… and apparently that was when Cas had reached his limit in terms of absolute, unbearable agony, because he closed his eyes, fell to his face with a
Cas turned back to Dean with a heavy heart and cleared his throat before saying, “This ‘human thing,’ as you say… I must admit that it’s quite overwhelming, even after these past years of experiencing it. For instance, a mere photograph can stir up an entire range of emotions in less than two seconds… remarkable." Cas sighed before setting the picture back in it’s place.
“It won’t be long now,” Sabrini’s voice from somewhere above him was drenched in bloodlust, drowning in the twisted pleasure of revenge. “Soon you will cease to exist, and then I will track down this Dean and torture him for the rest of his natural life, and there won’t be a damned thing you can do about it! Your precious
Sam muttered under his breath, “He’s always been different than other angels.”
“No, Dean, no!” Cas yelled into his neck, frustrated because everything that Dean just said was entirely inaccurate. “F-for

Cas shook his head. That was something he couldn’t do, not when Dean’s pain was so fresh in his mind, in his heart. He gently grabbed Dean’s hands and removed them from his shoulders. “You should be sleeping,” Cas said as he saw how bloodshot the hunter’s eyes were. Dean should have been resting peacefully, not trying to comfort Cas at four in the morning over something that was his own fault.
Do you hear me? I don’t care what my stupid brain conjures up when I sleep because that’s all bullshit. Fuck dream psychology and Freud and whatever else! Just… just know that
An hour later they arrived at the bunker. Dean didn’t say a word the entire drive, nor did he make a peep as they unloaded their luggage and headed inside. Sam must have picked up on the awkward atmosphere, because when Dean grunted “’Night,” and went straight for his room, Sam looked at Cas and asked, “What’s up with him?”
. All in good time.”
Dean just kept sobbing, anguish laced in every choking gasp that escaped his lips. Although Cas could no longer feel any physical pain, the sight of Dean so vulnerable and broken still caused a deeply profound ache in him, no matter what plane of existence he was on, no matter what body or vessel he had or didn’t have. Cas wished he could reach over and assure Dean that he was right here with him, floating as some sort of non-being right in front of him. But did it really matter? How long would Cas hover here until he was completely and utterly
wrong. This Castiel’s eyes were hard and distant, his mouth in a sharp line, and he walked agonizingly slowly despite the dire situation. Dream Cas stood before Dean, looking down on him as if he were a mere piece of dirt, his stare as cold as ice… A chill ran through the real Castiel’s spine when he realized that the expression was identical to the one that he’d worn when he was beating the life out of Dean under Naomi's command… when he was nothing but an animal trained to kill.
There was a blinding light, and even as Sabrini’s eyes were being burned from their sockets, he managed one final, evil act. In one swift motion he shoved the angel blade clean through Sam’s gut, and the bloody point protruded from Sam’s tailbone with a metallic
Eventually he spoke again, as if he felt like he was being rude to a dinner guest by not engaging in friendly conversation. “The more I think about it, I’m actually quite glad that the demon I sent to kill you was unsuccessful. I hadn’t thought about torture before, but, you know, when an opportunity comes calling… I have been looking forward to this for nearly seventy years, after all, so I figured, why
“Dean!” Sam chided his brother for his bluntness.
Sabrini’s knees started to shake, and he became enraged. “You abominable whore! How dare you!” He threw himself at Rowena with flailing arms, slashing the air randomly with the angel blade, but Rowena, eyes now shut in concentration, raised a hand and stopped him in his tracks.
Cas had said those hateful things to Dean so long ago and yet they were apparently engrained into the hunter's psyche, forever haunting him and Cas both- of course, any time that Cas had caused the Winchesters pain would plague the angel forever, but now he knew that Dean was suffering the same post-traumatic fear and it broke his heart.
Slowly but surely, Cas was growing accustomed to the complicated spectrum of human emotions. He only had one problem with it, and that problem was the reason that Cas had chosen this random location to sit and think for hours. That problem was Dean- well, the way Cas
Cas wasn’t even occupying his body, why on earth would he need morph-

worry from Dean’s mind. “What happened, then? What’s wrong?”
I did a quick little scan of your noggin, you see, and what I found was very intriguing. Not only did I find that Naomi had erased your memory of what you did to me- which makes this all the more enjoyable, I assure you- but, I also discovered that my dear old Cas, my brother in arms whom I used to trust so entirely, has fallen completely off the rails! That the great Castiel, always the best and most obedient soldier, has fallen in
“For what?!” Dean exclaimed desperately. “For that kiss? It’s fine, Cas.
; killing Dean over and over in that wretched simulation, watching him beg for mercy but draining the life out of him anyway, time and again; the hurt of betrayal in Dean’s eyes when he found out that Cas had lied straight to his face about working with Crowley to access purgatory… The list of his past wrongs seemed endless, it was no wonder Dean didn’t trust him. Cas felt as if he was going to combust from the guilt and sadness coursing through him.
“How you feel?” Dean wondered aloud.
and succumbed to the inviting darkness.

Dean slammed his shot glass on the table and gulped the burning liquid down. “Sam, like you said before, he’s a freaking angel. They don’t feel these kind of things like we do, so just drop it.”
Cas gave the tiniest of jumps. “What?”
“But I
Sabrini started to whistle a happy tune. He grabbed a helmet-type metal loop and shoved it unceremoniously onto Castiel’s head. Then, with much more delicate movements, he grabbed one screw after another and carefully placed them into their designated holes. Cas felt the various, tiny points of pressure where the cold ends of the screws met his skin. Two on his forehead, one on each temple, four scattered haphazardly across the back of his head, all vibrating as they waited for the mechanical command to start digging through bone. Similar to Sabrini, who was basically vibrating and buzzing with anticipation as he worked and whistled away.
It wasn’t the first time that Castiel had witnessed these kind of night terrors, but the sight of Dean gripping his sheets so tightly that  the whites of his knuckles were visible still caused sorrow to fill the angel's chest. He instinctively went to press two fingers to Dean’s forehead, but then- ‘
did Dean really think that Cas could possibly feel nothing after all they had been through? Did he truly believe that Cas didn’t genuinely care about him and his brother? Is that why he looked so crestfallen a moment ago when Cas reminded him that he was, indeed, an angel?
, Cas. For everything.”

“Your nightmare is what woke you up, but I apologize that you had to wake to see me like this.”
Castiel knew that he had wronged the Winchesters many times in the past… he should have known it would take a long time to rebuild that trust, but this was a promise that Castiel knew he would keep: As long as Dean Winchester allowed Cas to be in his life, that is exactly where he would stay. Unfortunately, he was now unsure if Dean wanted him around at all, and it was all his fault.
Once again Cas felt like he was being squeezed to death as the image of Heaven’s Court faded into bright, flashing lights. The pressure around him increased to an unbearable weight, and then he slowly came back to himself in the present, back to Sabrini’s hateful, twisted features right in front of him, and the agony had returned in full force as well. He felt incredibly weak, barely able to keep his eyes open as the pain kept eating him away. The screeching machine finally fell silent next to him but the haunting sound echoed in his ears, ringing so loudly that he could barely tell that Rowena was still there, her voice faintly reaching his consciousness.
Again Cas's eyes popped open, and he didn’t know when they had shut. Now Cas hadn’t the faintest recollection of why he was so easily giving in to death just seconds before that door crashed open. How could he be so content with leaving Dean? How could he let the pain get him to that point, when Dean was worth fighting any amount of agony for? But, Cas realized sadly, it didn’t matter at this point, regardless. The chances of Rowena saving him in time were

It had been years since he had rescued Dean from Hell, yet he still could not explain in words what he felt for the man, and he couldn’t begin to articulate how it was Dean himself that made Cas able to feel

Everything around Cas started to spin. Or maybe he himself, whatever he
Cas looked down, the empathy in Dean’s green stare too much for him to take. “Your nightmare-“ he began, but his throat closed up again as he remembered Dean’s agony.
Sam put his arm around his brother, looking at Cas's tortured body with a mix of sorrow and disgust.
out of hotel rooms, right? Or the hundreds of times we slept in the car?”
Eventually Dean broke the silence. “So, what are your plans after we get back? Planning on making any trips upstairs or anything?” His voice was casual but Cas could sense the underlying urgency in his tone, because the simple fact was that Dean felt more at ease when Cas and Sam were with him, in his line of sight so he knew they were safe. Always the protector.

yet he was somehow consciously aware of himself floating above his broken corpse, and though he had no eyes as far as he could tell, he could still see Dean’s panic stricken face as he lifted the upper half of Cas's lifeless body onto his lap and said over and over, “No, no, no,
Cas nodded dutifully. “Of course.”
“Oh, me and the boys are here in the bunker, trying to save your ass. Once again, I had to come and save the day. Now, we haven’t much time, dear, so kindly tell me where the hell you are so we can get this over with, yes? A magnificent witch such as myself has more important things to do after this.”
Sometimes Cas wished he could sleep just to pass the monotonous hours, especially tonight.  If only he could lay his head down and escape his thoughts and wake up feeling refreshed. Instead, he passed the time silently sitting in the bedroom he chose, hoping beyond hope that, come morning, everything will have blown over. Perhaps he and Dean could just pretend nothing happened and go back to normal, whatever ‘normal' was in this life.
A boyish laugh escaped Dean’s lips- one of Castiel’s favorite sounds- before he said, “Well for starters, why don’t we stop with the air quotes? And you don’t have to be sorry for being honest, Cas. The truth may make people uncomfortable, but it’s always the best option.” A troubled look crossed Dean’s features for a fleeting second, perhaps because he, as well as everyone, was guilty of lying in the past.
A twisted grin spread across Sabrini's face, and Cas noticed that even the vessel he had chosen had a natural, maniacal look in his hollowed, gray eyes, and a gaunt, narrow face with a graying beard and a sinister quirk to his thin mouth. “Now,” he continued in a businesslike manner, “Let me see how far along we are…”
it, Dean. In your mind I felt your pain as if it was my own, and- and to hear you say that’s it’s forgotten and that I should let it go… I don’t know how to do that while your anguish is still coursing through me.”
Dean waved his hand. “I can sleep later. Just… are you ok?”
- heart sped up as Dean sat slowly next to him, radiating heat into the angel’s side. Cas took a deep breath to try to calm his bodily reactions. The power of touch was an odd and addicting human phenomenon, one that Castiel had only discovered since meeting Dean (again, it always comes back to him). Something Cas had learned was that it never seemed to be enough- a shoulder pat, an accidental brushing of their arms, a hug… he was always left craving more, as if a part of him went missing the second that the contact ended. This didn’t happen with Sam or any other human that Cas had become close to. Just Dean, and Cas wondered if it had something to do with the fact that he had literally touched Dean’s soul, or did all humans experience this when physically close to someone they love?
About an hour into the drive Dean pulled into a rest area to use the bathroom. Cas decided to get out to stretch his legs and get some fresh air- not that he
At first Cas thought he had been spotted, but he then realized that Dean was looking in the opposite direction. Cas followed his gaze and saw a silhouette of himself in the foggy distance, and as this dream version of him got closer he knew immediately that something was
Dean appraised him for a second, and Cas noticed the way the moonlight affected the green in his eyes. Simply mesmerizing…
“Dean,” he interrupted, trying to hide his smile at how flustered Dean was getting. Was it possible that Dean experienced the same light-headedness when it came to physical contact? Because right now Castiel’s whole left side felt like it was on fire, a very pleasant fire. “Of course I’ll stay with you. As long as you wish.”
Dean gulped and continued, “We have, uh, extra rooms. I mean, I know- I know you don’t sleep, but-“
, that was nothing compared to the spasms of agony that were jolting through his entire being
The space around the street was filled with vague images of buildings, and beyond those buildings was nothing but a suffocating, smoky blackness. Cas quickly stepped behind something resembling a dumpster so that he would not be seen.
Cas tilted his head. “I make you uncomfortable? My apologies… I have been trying to work on my ‘social skills,’ but I suppose I still have much to learn.”
With the accent there was no denying who it was. “Rowena! I hear you. Where are you?”
The rather frazzled-looking witch, who was barely coming back to her senses after the draining task of killing Sabrini, sat up and crawled clumsily over to Dean and Cas.  “Alright, Winchester! Calm your testosterone!” she said hoarsely before she reached into an inconspicuous pocket on her long, emerald, velvet evening dress and pulled out a rainbow crystal the size of a baseball. It had a wide, jagged base and then narrowed to a dull point. Rowena placed it in the middle of Castiel’s chest with the dull head facing up, and the vibrant colors started to illuminate, brighter and brighter until the dazzling prisms of refracted light bounced and danced off of the slimey walls. Once again she closed her eyes in concentration, and began mumbling a stream of indiscernible words under her breath.
being the operative word because Cas knew that, given the choice, he would choose to save Dean from Hell again in an instant, and not just because it was an order.

Castiel's heart sank. Why would Dean think that he wouldn’t stay with him? Could he really not see how much Cas needed him, how much Cas
Sam’s tall form emerged at the far end of the hallway. He spotted Dean and Cas and began running toward them, also armed with his own assortment of weapons. Suddenly Cas felt something tightly grip his legs and send him sprawling to the ground. He let out a surprised yell as he scrambled to his knees and whipped around to see who or what caused his fall.
“’Night, Cas.”
… Why did Cas have to want more? Why couldn’t he be content with simply having Dean in his life at all? And, for the love of all that is holy, why did Cas have to lose control of his senses and kiss him? Who was he kidding, he knew why he had done it, after all this time of secret pining and reigning in his urges. He did it because of what he had overheard between the brothers earlier.
“I’m… uncertain.”
, has changed who you are immensely, hasn’t it? Fascinating, indeed, how things work out.”
“Sam,

“Cas, please. You can’t leave me!” Dean sobbed in a hushed tone. “Stay with me. I
that Cas could feel himself start to shake, for there was no worse feeling of personal violation than when one discovers that their own memories have been erased or tampered with. Castiel shuddered to think of how much of his own history he failed to recall.
“Yes. How I feel… emotions. Sadness, fear, peace, happiness, anger… Everything.” Cas couldn’t bring himself to say ‘love,’ although that’s what he was feeling in that moment. In all moments with Dean, actually. “When my grace was gone, I discovered the true range of human emotion… I
It had been an accident. A silly accident that Castiel could very well have prevented if he hadn’t been so side-tracked. After all, he had made a promise to both himself and the Winchesters long ago that he would respect their privacy: no dreamwalking, no going back in time to see something they don’t want him to know, and no “floating up in here all invisible and spying on us like some angelic peeping Tom,” as Dean had so eloquently stated, and Castiel had made good on that promise until last night:
’ Dean’s panicked voice pierced through Castiel’s ears.
life, and I shouldn’t have said what I said.”
Yet another sharp slice, this time horizontally across Cas’s chest, the fresh blood mixing with the darker, coagulated clots that were seeping from the hole in his heart.
“Now, Sam!” Rowena commanded through gritted teeth as she focused on her unseen forces, her eyes glowing yellow.
No, those details went unnoticed because all he could focus on was Dean’s despair. The angel’s body and ‘soul,’ for lack of a better word, was still drowning in Dean’s fear and grief. How Dean had lived with nightmares almost his entire life and still managed to get any decent sleep, Cas couldn’t begin to fathom.
slim… but he would try his damdest to stay breathing, for Dean…
indulge in my revenge a little bit? And then…” A disturbed, demented, and unnatural sound that no one would ever associate with an angel escaped Sabrini’s mouth. “And
Cas knew that this dry attempt at humor was Dean’s way of saying everything was ok, so he stepped away from the hunter to try and alleviate some of the intense air around them. Cas took slow steps around the room, getting lost in looking at Dean’s possessions- the numerous posters of cars on the wall, his gun and sword collection on the dresser… Cas paused and delicately picked up the tattered photo of a four-year-old Dean and his parents. A strange hollowness made it’s way through Castiel’s chest as he stared at Dean’s innocent face. This photo was taken shortly before Sam was born, Cas surmised, and those happy, blissfully ignorant green eyes had no clue what horrors his future held. Horrors that would begin only months after this candid snapshot was taken.
Sam continued, “mato exodine abhun, da nah bihro…”
Another searing slice into Cas's side, another desperate scream from his chest.
Sabrini. An old acquaintance from Castiel’s time on Earth during the Renaissance era, and the last person he expected to see towering over him. “Castiel, my old comrade! Do you know how long I’ve been looking for you?” Sabrini taunted from above Cas with a cold gaze.
Sabrini looked at Dean with delight. “In the flesh! What is so special about
“Not to worry, Castiel. I won’t hurt your little pets,” Sabrini said as he looked at Sam’s and Dean’s still bodies with disdain. He brought his hard eyes back to Cas. “I’m only here for you, old friend.”
It calmed him down enough to be able to stand up and get away from the comfort he didn’t deserve.
, was being slashed apart and squeezed and mutilated, and Castiel had no idea how Sabrini was doing it, or what it meant, or if he would survive it. Scream upon scream escaped his lips, mainly unheard over the mechanical sounds and Sabrini’s manic laughter. When the unbearable agony subsided the slightest bit,  Cas lolled his head to the side, sweaty and panting and feeling like he was broken into a million pieces. With closed eyes Cas heaved, “Sabrini… why… are you doing… this?”
It was a memory. Cas was about to relive a forgotten piece of his past, because the last time he recalled being with Sabrini, guns and tanks had not yet been invented. Whatever he was about to see took place long after the Renaissance.
Once again, the power of physical touch proved it had abilities far beyond Castiel’s understanding, because the longer that Dean held him the easier it became for Cas to think a bit more clearly, the repetitive motion on his back somehow grounding him just enough to match Dean’s breathing and stop trembling.
“Stop!” Cas yelled and tried to rise from the ground, but then realized that Sabrini was telekinetically restraining him with his other hand.
To his surprise Dean let out a dark chuckle. “Of course something inside my fucked up head would spook a goddamn
“Dean, I-“ That’s all Cas managed to get out before his throat painfully closed up and an involuntary choking sound escaped his lips, more fresh tears draining from his eyes. Crying was a curious act indeed, one that Castiel did not like one bit.
Cas started yelling at his past-self again, this time telling him to get the hell out of there,
Rowena's voice sounded so faint, like she was standing a mile away and her voice was being carried to him by a light wind. Cas tried to think back to the memory of following Sabrini here, to recall the exact words for the spell but it felt like trying to swim against a tide. He was getting weaker and he couldn’t think straight. For a moment he couldn’t even remember what he was supposed to be remembering.
“AAAAAHHHH! MAKE IT STOP! AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!” Cas wailed. If he thought that the pain was bad
, a dark, dingy, underground room started to come into focus and the pressure around him began to release. Cas gasped in a precious breath and smelt mildew and the overall scent of rotting decay.
Sam was mid-sentence when Cas arrived, “-might feel the same way. In fact, I think he does.”
The image of Sabrini hurting Dean or Sam in any way caused a rage in Cas so profound that he managed to roar, “NO!!” and proceeded to struggle against the chains with a newfound determination, part of him even hoping that he would fight so hard that the chains would simply cut off his hands and feet so he could escape, get off this metal sheet and kill Sabrini and go make sure the Winchesters were safe, and Cas would tell Dean he loved him and kiss him until they couldn’t breathe anymore because so much time for them to be together has already been wasted. Classic regrets of lost chances at love when someone knows they might die. Cas fought even harder, pieces of bloody flesh now falling from his wrists and ankles where the chains hadn’t budged at all.
“Oh. Well, you’re welcome to stay at the bunker.” At this point Dean turned back to him and seemed to just notice how close they were. Cas heard his breath catch and would swear he was… No, it must have been these human eyes playing tricks on him.
Cas's eye’s glowed bright blue. He clenched his teeth in his effort to use every last drop of grace he could muster. And the pain, God, the
in the first place, but he knew this to be true: the moment he laid his hand on Dean Winchester's soul, something was sparked at the very core of his being, and since then whatever that spark had contained had spread through Cas like a drug spreads through one’s bloodstream. He had been consumed by humanity and all of the incomprehensible emotions that came with it, all because of one human… how was that possible?
. With a satisfied smirk on his dying lips, Sabrini collapsed into a smoking heap on the ground, his sockets hollowed and blackened. Rowena let out a strangled breath and fell to the floor from the force of the magic she had just used, and Sam looked down at his bleeding gut with wide, shocked eyes before stumbling to the ground, as well.
“Not bad at all,” Sabrini concluded. “About a quarter of the way there… your grace is being depleted at a slow enough rate so that you won’t die during this part, but don’t fret. After some consideration I decided that I fully intend to put you out of your misery after I’ve had my fun. Now…”
“Sorry, sorry!” Sam fumbled with the multiple syringes in his hands.
. The drills in Castiel’s head picked up their pace and caused his head to vibrate uncontrollably, the room shaking in his vision as he let out strangled yelps.
Cas heard soft footsteps and could feel Dean’s eyes watching him, and then his vessel's- no,
Rowena yelled over the howling crystal. “Sam, get the morphine ready!”
his insides were shattered, he was getting cold from all of the blood loss, and his head felt like it just got put through a meat grinder, but he pushed through all of it with unexplainable will power.
Oddly, Cas was suddenly overtaken with an urge to laugh, because of course Dean would end up apologizing in a situation where he’d done absolutely nothing wrong. He didn’t laugh, though- Cas was at least savvy enough in the human social arena to know how inappropriate
Sabrini’s eyes landed on Sam and Dean, both armed and ready and about to strike. With a wistful smile Sabrini snapped his fingers and the boys fell to the ground into a forced slumber.
“You will soon find out,” Sabrini growled. “Now enough questions. I need to see something.”
know what it’s like, having saved your precious
After a pause Dean looked down shamefully and mumbled, “And I’m sorry for what I said earlier about not keeping your promises… you know that I trust you, right Cas? I trust you with Sammy's life, with
that.” Dean started pacing around his small bedroom. He brought his hand up to his chin and began roughly stroking his stubble, something Cas knew he did when he was deeply unsettled. Cas could see his troubled features in the mirror above Dean’s dresser, and a part of him was tempted to just overpower Dean and force him to go back to sleep so that Cas could wallow in self-pity in peace.
A prayer.
At the sound of his voice Cas found the strength to lift his head a fraction of an inch. Dean, Sam, and Rowena came bursting through the doorway like a stampede of the most peculiar search-and-rescue team you’ve ever seen.
BE DESTROYED BY AN UNNATURAL PIECE OF FILTH AS YOU, YOU VIAL WITCH! OR
Because Dean was dying, and Cas was feeling every agonizing second of his death along with him. Because Dean was dying, and Cas swore he saw a hint of a smile on the face of his dream counterpart, a tiny sliver of arrogant glee in those inhuman blue eyes as they watched Dean suffer.
“I see,” was all Cas said. Then they both stared straight ahead for a couple more minutes, enjoying the humid night’s tranquil effects and each lost in their own thoughts.
Dean grinded his teeth together, Castiel’s stubbornness apparently wearing on his last nerve. The warm hand left his tear-strained cheek as Dean raked his hands through his matted hair with a frustrated sigh. “I don’t know what you’re talking about! We’ve all fucked up and made mistakes, Cas! Whatever it is that’s bothering you now, it's in the past. It’s forgotten, alright? Apparently not by my subconscious, but I can’t
He almost wish he would have died rather than go through this. “AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!”
To this Sabrini gave a frightening hoot of laughter and said with sarcastic fondness, “Oh, all in good time,
But it was pointless. All pointless. None of those words penetrated the blond, balding vessel’s brain. The Cas from decades ago still flew away with Sabrini, and the Cas that was trapped just underneath the surface could do nothing about it but watch, and listen, and fear what he was about to learn.
Castiel’s heart was now beating in his throat. It was like the world consisted of only him, Dean, and this tiny charged bubble around them. As if just realizing that he said those words out loud, Dean’s eyes widened and Cas knew he was about to get up and leave and pop this intoxicating bubble, so he timidly placed his hand on top of Dean’s (

Cas mused.
Dean shook him harder. “Cas! Are you hurt?” His voice was rising with panic, so Cas vehemently shook his head to alleviate at least
: “I learned my lesson while I was away, Dean. I serve Heaven, not man, and I certainly don’t serve
Dean stared into the distance, subconsciously biting his lip as he thought about this. Castiel tracked the movement with his eyes and found it quite distracting, and without realizing it he leaned his face just a bit closer to Dean’s. Keeping his eyes forward, Dean asked slowly, “What about now? I mean, now that you’ve got your mojo back did these emotions… lessen again?”
Both Sam and Rowena shoved needles into each of Castiel’s wrists and injected the morphine, and Dean added his own dose to Cas's bicep for good measure, all while Cas continued his mind-numbing screams. After a few moments the wild jerks of Cas's body slowly decreased to faint twitches and his screams slowly lessened in volume. Cas's eyes became heavier as the drug pulsed through him, and after determining that he probably
The whirring and metallic clacks of the machine grew louder next to Castiel’s ear. His heart raced with fear. He only had time to let out a weak “No-!” before the unforgiving metal thrust through his skin as easy as if Cas were made of melting wax. Scarlet blood spewed in all directions, and Cas could feel the warm wetness dripping down his face, could taste the coppery liquid pooling in his mouth because he had bitten his tongue in his effort not to scream. Blood spattered from Castiel’s chest right into Sabrini’s left eye, dripping slowly down his cheek. Sabrini let out a dark chuckle as he amusedly wiped the blood with back of his hand, looked at it with delighted humor, and then wiped it on his grimy, gray t-shirt. He reached his stained hand to somewhere unseen and there was a click of a flipping switch, and Cas had to finally let out a gut-wrenching scream as the drill roughly grinded even deeper into his brain, the excruciating vibrations rattling all the way down his spine and back up again.
Tendrils of Castiel’s grace escaping him and swirling away, slightly illuminating the otherwise dingy space.
Here’s the thing about dream walking: not only do you see what the dreamer sees, but you can also tune in to what the dreamer is feeling, and Castiel was hit with a feeling of dread and doom so fierce that it brought him to his knees. It was the feeling of knowing you’re about to die. Dean knew that he and Sam were about to be killed by this morphing monster and that there was no way to stop it. The demon reached for Sam’s neck with a blurry arm, but then everything slowed down and the scene in the street became nothing but background noise as Dean called out, “Cas! Help us!”
“For sure Sam. Just admit you like him, it’s so obvious you guys like each other.” Dean smirks and laughs. “Do it tonight and I’ll let you drive Baby down the road. But! You have to do it in front of me, I need to see this iconic moment, after all y’all did see me and Cas get together.” Dean says almost cringing, not really believing what he’s just said, he cherishes that car and never lets anyone drive her, not even Cas, well he has let him drive Baby but only with Dean literally on top of the blue eyed boy.
“Ha, yea Sam hasn’t stopped talking about Gabe either, he keeps calling me and texting me about him and stuff, he’s head over heels for him.” Dean retorts as he sits up slightly as their principal, Donna Hanscum walks up the stairs of the raised platform that sits on the edge of the football field they currently reside on. The friend group and the other kids sitting around them start to quiet down and start settling in their seats as Mrs.Hanscum moves some papers around on the pedestal and makes sure the microphone is at the right level as well as making sure it works by tapping on it, it making a loud ringing noise and she moves her hand over it too quickly stop the obnoxious noise.
A day after moving in, Dean spots a newspaper article, while sitting at the library at his free period at school, looking for someone to come work on cars for a good price of 25 dollars an hour and it’s not too far away as well, just about 15 minutes from their apartment and 20 minutes from the school. “This is great, Cas will be so happy and school is almost over so this is awesome. Well, guess I’ll give the guy a call.”
Once Dean knows Cas is sleeping, he moves his body enough to get to his bag and digs through it, not worrying about the noise and movements too much since Cas is such a deep sleeper, and pulls out a bottle of whisky. Looking down at Cas he frowns and furrows his brows as he rethinks what he’s about to do. Why is he doing this? What is he getting out of this? Why is he still hurting himself? Why is he still hurting Cas, the love of his life, that he’d do anything for, that isn’t even aware of what he’s doing? He ponders it for a moment but then he takes a look at the bottle and it all gets drowned away by the whisky making its way down Dean’s throat. Burning and crisp, settling warmly in his gut. Although his gut doesn’t feel warm with what he’s doing. It all feels numb. Dean feels nothing when he drinks, and that’s exactly how he likes it. So he drinks and drinks, and drinks.
“Well now I’m going to worry even more, five days?! You said this is only a three day thing.” Cas says as he adjusts his things and they make their way towards the mountain, half tripping over rocks along the way, catching up to Dean.
“That’s not how that works Dean.” Cas shakes his head and smiles as he drinks some of his juice, looking at Dean’s goofy grin as he watches Cas eat the rest of his food.
“Work was slightly stressful but now I’m with you.” He says as Dean gets up, walking to stand in front of Castiel, runs his hands up Cas’ frame and pulls his jacket off. “Hmm, did you just get out of the shower?” Cas runs a hand through Dean’s damp hair and pulls him in for an open mouthed kiss when his hand reaches the back of his neck.
“You have to leave.” Mary says quietly and Dean’s face stills as his mother’s words filter through his brain. “Get your stuff and leave. You’re not welcome here anymore.” She says and lets go off Dean’s arm, it flopping down as Dean feels limp, hurt and like he’s been stabbed in the back, tears still streaming slowly from his mossy green eyes, now red from the crying.
“Yea we can do that, I wanted to get some snacks anyway. Where we going, Walmart?” Dean replies and Cas hums in agreement, them both making their way to Dean’s Baby, a black 67 Chevy Impala that his dad gave to him once he turned 16 and Dean has treated the car like his own child ever since, he loves that car almost as much as he loves Castiel.
“I’m stopping for gas and some snacks for the rest of the ride there, you want anything?” Dean asks as he parks the car next to a pump at a self-serve, a scrawny young man running out to pump the gas for them as Dean pulls out a 20 bill and hands it to the man with a little thanks.
“Oh lighten up dude! Besides, movie night, and you know who is gonna be there…” Lucifer says cheerfully, making sure to whisper the last part since both Dean and Castiel are closeted about their sexuality and relationship, having not told their parents yet. Dean’s dad would probably disown him or kill him, and his mum would probably just be super disappointed and maybe kick him out or something, and well Cas’ dad is very religious and does not approve that stuff in any way. Cas sorta smiles at the slight mention of Dean and shrugs halfheartedly at his older brother's statement.
“Oh um, you had a fly on you.” Sam dead pans with a stupid answer making Charlie giggle, hand over her mouth, next to Sam who now glares at her. Lucifer laughs and starts to say something incriminating and Sam gives him a ‘I will kill you.’ look and Lucifer stops mid sentence.
Dean and Castiel spend a few nights in the Impala in abandoned lots as they search for cheap apartments and a job for Dean, as well as a good college and maybe one with a scholarship since Castiel is doing so well in school.
“A cactus? I was thinking more like an actual animal, a fish or something? But yea a cactus is fine too, whatever you want is fine with me.” Dean says as he finally finishes his food and goes to grab more.
“Can you hold me as I go up there, I’m kinda scared to do this.” Cas blushes as he speaks into Dean’s ear.
“Dean, are you two still…” She pauses looking for the words, disgust evident on her face making Dean’s stomach churn in a sick and almost guilty way, even though he knows he has no reason to feel guilt, it’s his life and he can be with who ever he wants to be with, he can be gay if he wants to, it’s his self and he’s not going to be someone who he’s not, even for his mother’s sake. “Together?” She finally gets out as she shoves the photo back into the inside pocket of Cas’ beige trench coat.
“Oh Dean I’m so you did, you look so gorgeous.” Cas says with lust lacing his voice and he goes to make out with Dean and push his growing erection into Dean’s own, them both moaning into the kiss at the first touch of friction. “Up.” Cas demands with a slap on his husband's ass and Dean jumps to cling around Cas’ waist and kiss more as they make their way to the bedroom down the hall.
“Yea, thanks.” Cas says looking at his Dunkin’ Donuts espresso iced coffee, smiling that Dean remembered what kind he likes.
Dean shakes out of his recall from the past and looks back to his mother and the polaroid instead of the carpet beneath his feet that covers the dark hard wood that is partially worn out from his as Sam’s rough housing over the years, having owned the house since Mary and John were a few months pregnant with Sammy.
“Yea yea, what a shocker… I didn’t want to offer it, but I couldn’t think of anything else to offer for Sam to do something like that, ya know?” Dean explains his out of character actions as he moves his hand in the air as he talks.
“Dean…” Cas whispers to Dean as they wait for Cas’ turn on the beginners wall for the indoor rock climbing.
Sam sighed dramatically. “Fine, but I’m taking the back seat. I need some shut eye.”
feel things before then, but I suppose being human must have amplified those emotions.”
“What? I don’t…” Dean trailed off. “I was dreaming but… I can’t remember… wait, were you in my head?”
Cas had long ago ruled out the possibility of it being fate or destiny, for he had met with an angel of fate himself and asked her if meeting Dean was somehow in the cards all along, but she said no and had no further answers to offer. So, the only fuzzy explanation Cas could come up with was that there had to be something wrong with him. Perhaps Cas had always been some kind of cosmic mistake or, to put it in more human-relatable terms, perhaps there was some sort of malfunction when Cas was created that caused a glitch in him, an incredibly miniscule glitch that could only be activated by a particular human soul that it had taken Cas millennia to find. That was the angel’s most plausible theory, but Cas had long since accepted that he would never really know for sure.
During this exchange Dean had run over and threw himself to his knees next to Cas with a panicked cry. “Cas!” he said brokenly as he delicately hoisted Cas up by the shoulders. “Cas, open your eyes!”
Sam chimed in after swallowing another shot, “I swear, Dean, the bunker has made you so spoiled. You do remember that we used to
“I believe I will be rooming here for the foreseeable future. I don’t think I would be very welcome in Heaven right now.”
The unfortunate occupant of this room in the 1940s was Demetrion, the very commander that Sabrini had told Cas was reassigned more than a month ago, in the previous memory…
“Not at all,” Cas replied with no hesitation. “For example, right now I feel at peace, being surrounded by nature… and thankful, I suppose.”
Cas had to concentrate insanely hard to send her a mental image of the Enochian 'danger' symbol. He was finding it increasingly difficult to think coherently, but with all of his effort he summoned up images of the symbol, the clearing in the forest, the stones between the trees, the snapping of his fingers when the symbol was spinning fast enough…
Unfortunately that’s not how it panned out. The awkward tension was palpable as Sam and Dean drank their coffee and Cas sat nearby pretending to be looking for a case on the computer. Poor Sam tried his hardest to get a conversation flowing, but Dean’s avoidance of Castiel’s gaze and short answers to his brother eventually made him give up.
Dean let out a sarcastic laugh. “Thankful for what? This shitty rest area?”
being put through right now! Ah, I do love irony in death. Quite poetic, wouldn’t you say?”
Cas was floating, he was sure of it.
Dean stood up with a sigh and put his hands on the angel’s shoulders. “Stop apologizing, Cas. Just… tell me what happened.”
Dean seemed to understand his current inability to speak because he started moving his hands up and down Castiel’s back with soothing pressure as he repeated in his ear over and over, “Just breathe. Everything’s ok, Cas. Breathe with me. Everything’s ok.”
“Too late for that,” Dean scoffed. “Cas, please… what’s wrong?”
Castiel’s hand froze in front of Dean’s troubled face. Maybe he could peek into Dean’s head just this once… because why would he be dreaming that Cas would leave him when he needed help?
“Cas, I don’t even remember what the hell I was dreaming about! So whatever it was just let it go.”
Unsettled
Cas wiped the tears from his face and looked at the wetness on his hands with a curious expression. Dean stayed sitting but watched him with worried eyes, and Cas supposed he owed at least a little bit of explanation for this rude awakening. His voice still strained, he said lowly, “You prayed to me.”
Cas watched all of this with an amused expression and followed them wordlessly to the car. Within a few minutes Sam was snoring, leaving Cas and Dean in a content silence save for the soft sounds of The Beatles coming from the speakers and the road passing beneath them. When ‘Hey, Jude' came on Cas enjoyed the sound of Dean’s quiet humming, and his heart warmed up every time he saw Dean glance to the back seat to make sure he wasn’t disturbing his brother while he slept. This was one of those moments that Cas felt truly happy. The angel knew that if he was given the option to spend an eternity in this car with them, listening to classic rock and seeing Dean’s smile as he sang his lungs out and listening to their endless brotherly bickering, Cas would choose that life in an instant. He looked over at Dean’s profile and smiled, unnoticed by the hunter.
mourn
“Now it’s time for you to get some clarity, Castiel. Time for you to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation you have found yourself in. You asked what happened to me and why I am doing this. Well, time to show you.”
Sabrini chuckled softly. “Well, well, what do we have here?” He shoved Cas's body aside with his foot as he stalked toward them. “A witch, huh? My, my Castiel, the company you keep these days! And
.” At some point Sabrini had picked up an angel blade, and as he said that last word with reverence he cleanly sliced one of Castiel’s wrists. A shallow
The image of the battlefield faded away and was instantly replaced by a different, yet equally grotesque and disturbing, setting in which the next memory would play out.
Somehow their faces were now mere inches apart, and a thrilling electricity made its way through Castiel's body. He could feel Dean’s breath on his lips, could smell Dean’s shampoo, could see the flecks of brown in his green eyes. Cas was being suffocated by everything
Sam chuckled at Dean’s expense before turning to Cas. “So, how did it go?”
Sabrini must have sensed Castiel’s rising terror. He turned around with an evil glint in his eyes. “Ah, you recognize this, do you? Splendid!” With a buoyant energy he lifted the contraption and set it on a shelf on the right, out of range of Castiel’s peripheral vision but so solidly and surely
Finally Dean focused on him again, and Cas realized he was still staring at Dean’s mouth and he wanted to punch himself. This was another thing that Cas had learned about love- it made one do foolish things outside of their control, as if the body disconnects from the mind and follows it’s own unreasonable commands, just like what had happened the previous night that had started this entire mess! But this time was different, because Dean wasn’t pulling away. Clearly he had noticed where Castiel’s eyes had been. Clearly he noticed how Cas was now squeezing his hand harder because he was feeling so overwhelmed and uncertain, and Cas was growing tired of feeling those things tonight. And he had to notice Castiel’s breathing become shallow and his cheeks turn red… but still Dean didn’t pull away. In fact Cas was quite sure he was leaning in, and he had about a half a second of excited anticipation before a deafening bang made them both jump up. The ground shook beneath their feet as they heard a series of rumbles in the walls.
will suffer at the hands of a crazed, blood-thirsty angel, and I’ll make sure to tell him that it’s all your fault, Castiel. Every piece of cut flesh, every drop of blood spilled, every single broken bone- and mark my words, there will be
and he didn’t plan on pulling himself away.
With a condescending tisk of his tongue, Sabrini chided, “Now, now, Castiel, stop fussing. It is completely futile and, frankly, quite irritating and childish. Besides-“ Sabrini wrapped a cold hand around Castiel’s neck and squeezed, savoring the sounds of the gags and chokes that resulted. Icy, grayish green eyes were then right in front of Cas’s face, eyes that were void of all remorse, void of anything, really, much like Castiel’s own in Dean’s nightmare. They stared straight through Cas and chilled his bones. Sabrini continued, “I don’t plan on erasing any memories, but rather on restoring some rather significant ones. At least, significant in regards to
. Sometimes Cas wondered if he should just start calling himself that. Aside from his grace or ‘mojo,’ as Dean called it, Cas was human in every other way, down to the body that was all his own. Cas still failed to understand how he ended up this way, but the one thing he knew was that it somehow all circled back to Dean. It always does.
an angel, Dean.”
Cas opened his eyes and looked at Dean curiously. “What do you mean?”
Cas sighed and ran a hand through his hair, yet another human gesture. “Don’t worry about me, Dean.”
Although Cas had been through this particular scenario before, it made the grief of losing his grace no less great, for he was again losing an integral part of himself, and so shortly after getting it back. It made him feel naked and hollowed out and used and worthless. If only he could rip apart these damned chains! At the rate his grace was escaping, he still had at least ten minutes until it was gone completely…
“It wasn’t you, Dean. It was
Eventually a muffled voice reached his ears. “Come on, Castiel, time to rise and shine…” it was so faint that Cas wondered if he’d imagined it, but a second later it returned, a bit clearer: “Come on, now. I’ve waited long enough for this. Up and at ‘em, old friend!”
Cas thought deliriously,
I wonder… I’m so glad you came so that I didn’t have to come collect you myself.” Sabrini raised the blade and began charging at the invading trio.
Dean and Sam were busy with a werewolf hunt in Chicago, so Cas had offered to go take care of a vampire nest he believed to be in a small town nearby. Of course Dean didn’t like the idea: “You’re not going hunting by yourself, not on my watch. Just come gank this wolf with us and we can all go to the nest tomorrow.”
“No, I don’t plan on returning to heaven any time soon. I doubt I am very well liked at the moment, and I consider myself lucky that they have let me keep my grace. It’s better not to push my limits.”
