“He was here, Greg.  The guy who’s been sending the texts came to the shop!”  It’s impossible to keep the note of hysteria out of my voice.
is, in my head at least, an epic period film with a nearly lyrical script, lots of moody shots of the architecture in Prague by night, and a musical score that sweeps you away.  There’s a romance between Sherlock’s character Petr and Irene’s character Evka.  It won loads of Baftas and other awards and was nominated at the Oscars as well.
Thankfully, he doesn’t appear to be angry -- about the coffee or my rambling.  The now-empty paper cup is at his feet and I scramble to pick it up and toss it in the bin, if only to occupy my hands.  A blush is creeping up the back of my neck, my skin feeling warm to the touch as I scrub my hand over it roughly.
I know they’re not going to let me get away with that and I’m proven right when I’m met with five identical expressions of ‘and?’ plus Sherlock’s look of barely controlled amusement.  “Fine, and then we met when I spilled coffee on him by accident, and Sherlock was so taken by my bumbling attempts to apologise that he turned up at the shop today to ask me out.  And, of course, I already had plans and tried to let him down gently, but instead of being put off, he just invited himself along.  See, couldn’t keep him away!”
Sherlock risked a glance over at the other man and noted that a small smile had appeared on John’s face.
“Fine,” Lestrade gritted out with a glare aimed at Sherlock, before he turned his attention to John. “I may not be able to give Sherlock orders, but I can command you, Captain. You will deliver Sherlock to the barracks as quickly as possible. Is that understood?”
With each step closer to Trafalgar Square, I feel disappointment settle within me.  We’re going to part ways and what, shake hands like colleagues or a briefly hug as mates?  That just sounds awkward and completely unsatisfying.
I chuckle.  “Perhaps.”
Ste nodded and said, “Looks like your night’s goin’ even further downhill, Benton.  First, the Curzon Club, and now Cheekbones.  No tail for you!”
~~five o’clock in the morning~~
Sherlock waits on the pavement, hunched and turned towards the window, hiding his face, while I lock the door and the security gate.  As we walk through the streets of Notting hill towards my flat, he follows closely at my elbow.  It’s a bit surreal to have him next to me again, but the circumstances are so vastly different from before that I feel on edge.
I cannot for the life of me figure out what Sherlock stepped on to get up the fence, nothing appears to be a sturdy foothold.  There’s a bit of a decorative swirl on one of the bars so I place my foot on that and push myself up.  Halfway up, I can feel my foot slipping -- no tread on these shoes because I did not intend to be scaling fences and trespassing tonight! -- and I fall in an ungainly fashion back to the pavement below.  “Whoopsie daisy!”
The man’s - Sherlock Holmes’ - eyes narrow and it’s like a shutter comes down between us. Gone is the reserved but charming man and in his place is this cold and distant stranger. I want to shrink back from him at the change, but Anderson is seemingly oblivious. “Could I get an autograph?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s laughter is warm and inviting and I find myself smiling along with him, the atmosphere in the room lifting, allowing me to breathe easily again.
After receiving the go-ahead from whichever BBC producer he’d had his silent conversation with, Charlie falls back on his professionalism and replies, “With the rise in mental health issues in this country, especially among young people, that is perhaps a good reminder of how far we still have to go in the industry to ensure the safety and health of everyone involved.”  Which sounds like a perfect politician answer to me.  On the television, Sherlock simply inclines his head slightly.
“Much appreciated, Sir. Thank you,” Lestrade said with a nod.
“It must be difficult to manage such a boy.”
“Oh, do shut up, Mycroft,” he shouted and then turned to John again, “John, please. The situation was...complicated.”
“I slept on the sofa, as you are well aware from the stack of pillows and blankets,” he spits out, a flash of embarrassment crossing his face.
He shakes his head again, curls falling across his forehead, and then shoves his hands into the pockets of his coat.  I realise then that he’s still wearing it, all buttoned up, like he never intended to stay.
“We were in the area so I thought I’d pop in to check that we were still on for drinks later.”
John snorted. “Oh, stop with that look, Sherlock. You are anything but innocent. You’re a menace.”
“You’re putting us to shame, mate!” Mike says, laughing.
.  Sherlock plays a doctor, living on the Devon coast at the turn of the century, who believes he is being stalked.  Angelo does appear in a scene in the pub and Sherlock’s performance is amazing.
Without looking at me, Sherlock says, “It’s not a big deal, John.  A minor issue was dealt with and now we have food.  Just eat.”  He sounds increasingly irritated.  What started out as light banter has descended into something more like an argument.
It’s quarter to seven, meaning I either have to text Greg to say I’m not coming tonight or head out the door.  While it seems rude to leave Sherlock on his own when he’s clearly upset, I also don’t know if I can stay in the same room as him for another moment.  The atmosphere is tense and uncomfortable, and if he’s not going to talk about what’s going on with him, then I anticipate the evening continuing in much the same manner.  I don’t have the social grace to handle this situation with any degree of understanding and sensitivity.
“Would you like to see the gardens?”
John snorted. “I don’t think your brother or parents would approve of that.”
“Yes and no,” Sherlock said finally, offering nothing else to answer his father’s question.
Once they were safely hidden in the shadows of the trees, Sherlock stopped and John gratefully came to rest beside him.  His posture, doubled over with his hands on his knees, in contrast to Sherlock’s elegant frame leaning back against one of the tall trunks.
Now on the road, far away from the palace and any prying eyes, Sherlock stepped on the accelerator as they moved from the more congested areas of central London to Blackheath and beyond. The wind whipped around them and John removed his hat and placed it securely in his lap.
Worry over Sherlock’s situation continues to niggle at me for the rest of the day, seeping into my head so that as I go about my work, my attention is divided between the task at hand and the man currently hiding out in my flat.  As we begin preparing to close up for the night, my phone pings with a text alert.
And yet it did.  I met Sherlock Holmes and I think he rather liked me.
- I apologise to anyone who uses proper grammar and spelling when texting, Harry clearly doesn’t.  This mainly goes out to @zigster-ao3 for putting her through Harry’s terrible texting multiple times.  I also wanted to include an eggplant and a peach emoji in one of her texts but they didn't translate to AO3.  Boo.
⟪Sherlock’s fine and hasn’t received any texts.  He doesn’t seem to think it’s a big deal.  Being a complete git, actually.⟫
Laughing, he said, “You’re an absolute menace on the roads!”
My stomach gives a soft growl.  Now I wish I’d grabbed one of those chocolate croissants on my way out of the shop instead of dashing out to get away from Anderson.  If I go back for it, I’d feel guilty leaving again and would just spend the rest of the day annoyed and hiding in my office, worrying over the books.
Sherlock takes the proffered package of biscuits, studies them for a moment, and then looks at me, eyes glinting with mischief.  “Can ‘Hobnob’ be a euphemism this time?”
- There are a number of moments I wanted to explore in more detail (including what Sherlock and John got up to that night), but I just didn’t have room to do it in this chapter.  I may write a few one-shots that take place in this universe after the fic is complete.  We shall see.
“How much?” he asked.
It's a sincere compliment and I suspect those are hard to earn from Sherlock, so I suddenly feel like I've been knocked off balance.  His hand finds mine and squeezes my fingers.
They just stare at me for a few seconds, Greg looking like he’s desperately holding in a cheeky response and Molly waiting patiently for me to continue.  When I don’t, she prompts me again.
His complimentary words make me feel warm and I grin.  “It is pretty amazing, I must admit.”
“Was it?  I didn’t notice.”
Sherlock glared at him.  “Regardless, you will look entirely out of place next to me.  I demand you change at once.”
Their eyes met and John felt a shock of familiar electricity run through him. While he his face had matured and his long limbs had gained muscle and grace, Sherlock’s eyes were exactly the same. Grey and searching, seeming to peer into John’s mind, to all the thoughts he tried to keep hidden. Grief still lingered in their depths, the recognition of which made John’s heart ache.
“No, Sherlock. Sorry, I didn’t mean…” John drew a breath and tried again. “I wasn’t mocking you. I just doubt that anyone would ever consider you ordinary, not you because, well, you’re brilliant. Even so, you still could have told me the truth.”
I think back, trying to remember the oddly formal wording of that first text from the unknown number.  “Something like ‘It’s come to my attention that you’ve met Sherlock Holmes.  I suggest you stop seeing him immediately.’”
“That being said, I do still like you, Sherlock, despite everything, and I'd like to be your friend, especially with all this going on in the press.  Okay?”
“No? So what do I call you? My Prince? Prince William?”
“Count yourself lucky -- for awhile it seemed like every woman on the Tube was reading that book, 50 Shades of Grey, and once I knew what it was about, I would avoid anyone holding it out of sheer secondhand embarrassment.”
One afternoon, my phone buzzes in my pocket just as I’m waving a customer away after she’s purchased a guidebook for the Pacific Coast Trail -- there’s been increased interest in that trek since the film
He shifts against me, a look of apprehension flickering across his features.  “John, I know I’ve made a mess of things previously, but I do hope you can trust me again.”
“Well, besides being one of the most beautiful people on the planet, Sherlock, you’re also intellectually appealing, you know?  Like most people could never remotely comprehend what’s going on in that amazing brain of yours.  It’s incredibly sexy.”  It’s out before I can stop it -- wine clearly gone to my head.
After passing over a cup of tea, John seats himself at the other end of the sofa, near Sherlock’s chair, and they bicker lightheartedly about the biscuits. Seeing them together, it’s easy to recognise the bond that they have, one solidified over 54 years of shared laughter, heartache, and commitment. For all that John might seem like the more unassuming of the pair, there is a strength to him that is undeniable. His soft voice commands attention, from me and, clearly, from Sherlock, whose grey eyes focus on John with attentiveness and adoration whenever he speaks.
“Oh, hello!” I say in surprise, setting my pencil down and standing up from the stool.
“Not really.  I mean, the fact that he turned up at my door seems to be an indication that things are very much not all right.  It’s just not something I would have pictured him doing, hiding out, I mean.  He’s quieter and drawn in on himself.”
Releasing the gear stick, Sherlock raised his left hand to wave in reply, before taking the turn that blocked John from his view.
I hope that doesn’t come across too needy or over-the-top, but fuck it, it’s been a stressful day.  As I wait for his reply, I play with a wooden puzzle cube that’s found its way onto the desk at some point.  I fiddle with it absentmindedly, not remotely attempting to put it together correctly.  There’s not enough space in my brain for that kind of focus.
“What?”
“Hey, Mols.”  I lean in to kiss her cheek and then step to the side so I can introduce him.  “This is Sherlock.”
“Hmm.  While technically true, perhaps a little context might be helpful,” Sherlock says.  Everyone is staring at me.
I quickly wipe my hands off, just in case it’s the former and my services are actually needed, before looking up to offer a greeting.
I can feel a headache coming on. “I’m sure his lawyers would love that. I don’t have enough money for lunch, let alone for legal fees.”
I’ve started to sweat, but I push down my anxiety and stride ahead as if everything is perfectly fine.  We continue in silence until we reach my street door.  It’s kelly green in colour, once vibrant and glossy but now chipped and faded, and the metal number on the door is slightly crooked.  The stairwell seems dimmer than usual as we climb the stairs to the second floor, Sherlock Holmes’s fine leather shoes scuffing softly with each step behind me.  It’s silly the things you notice when you’re a ball of nerves and trying to impress.
Beside him, Sherlock felt John’s arm bumping his and glanced over at him, wondering if attempting to flee was a poor decision, one that might have consequences for John later, but John met his eye, and with a wild grin, whispered, “Run!”
Apologies for the long time between updates - I was in London last week and took a wee break from writing, but we're back to our regularly scheduled programme, so hopefully it'll be smooth sailing from here until the end.  I hated this chapter at first, and then I loved it.  I hope it is as satisfying to read as it was to write in the end, and worth the wait!  Thank you so much to all of you reading along - your comments and enthusiasm keep me going!
I cringe.  “Please, for the love of god, don’t talk about me in relation to your love life.”
I feel like I can’t breathe.
In his peripheral vision, he saw that Sherlock had been hurt. Somehow in the chaos, he’d earned himself a bloody nose. The sight of blood on Sherlock’s face made his own run hot once more.
Well. That’s not at all what I expected him to say, so I tell him, “That’s not at all what I expected you to say.”
He holds my gaze, eyes communicating deep emotions similar to the ones that are running through me.  “I’m glad you’re here, John,” he says, quietly.
“A concerned party,” he replies smoothly.
Sherlock gave him a shrug in response. He was more interested in hearing about John's aspirations in this land of make believe, so he asked, “And what about you? What would you do?”
I chuckle at that.  “Quite rude to tell someone that there will be dinner waiting for them when they get home and then eat it all before they arrive!”
It’s still early yet.  The lunchtime crowds haven’t started to descend on Portobello Market so I’m able to make my way through the stalls at a leisurely pace, a novelty, to be sure.  No cotton tote bags full of organic vegetables hitting my legs as people squeeze through the crowd; no army of mums pushing squalling babies in prams the size of small vehicles; no crowds of American tourists refusing to queue properly.  It’s just me and a few old ladies with their shopping trolleys.
Climbing onto my bed, I settle against the pillows to read it through, something I haven’t done since we started this project.  I turn the pages gently, lingering over the combination of my words and Harry’s drawings.  It’s breathtaking -- in a raw and beautiful way.
Helloooooo -- so sorry for the long time between chapters! We're nearing the end so I hope to get these final chapters out in a more timely fashion.  As always, thank you so much for reading, commenting and cheering me on through this story -- I love your response to this fic so much!
To his great relief, John’s face softened into a brilliant smile, his eyes positively twinkling.  Although Sherlock was usually loath to employ such poetic language, in this instance it was simply the truth.  Sherlock felt himself grinning in return.
“So what’s your conclusion, detective?”
“Unless?”
He broke the silence to ask, “So, I’m assuming Major Lestrade is the officer chasing you, but do you actually know General Erskine?”
“No, I will not be purchasing anything from you today.”  His gaze rakes over me, pausing at my shoulder.  “Perhaps you should sit, Mr. Watson, your old war injuries must be causing you some pain in this weather.”
“Sherlock, we’ve been through this.  You are due back home immediately.”
In response, Sherlock scrunched his nose up and gave it an adorable little wiggle. John smothered a giggle at the sight and Sherlock grinned up at him, pleased.
That would be absurd, I know, but I’m still tempted.  Nothing like this ever happens to me.
Thank you so much for all your comments on this fic so far - they are really keeping me going!!!  You are the best! x
I nod my thanks and he settles happily behind the counter, digging into his lunch before I’ve even made it to the office.
✢ROUGH AND TUMBLE✢
Sherlock snorted.  “You would not be saying that if you knew him.”
Ever since Saturday night, I’ve wanted to keep Sherlock close by, and now that he’s off in a part of his celebrity world that I don’t have access to, I feel positively fidgety with unease.  Moving through the familiar routine of tea-making, I settle at the table with the steaming cup between my hands and begin calculating how long it’ll take them to leave the BBC studios and drive the two miles back to my flat.  Sally had said there was nothing else lined up for Sherlock today, so I assume he’ll be coming straight back here, and so I wait impatiently.
While he undoubtedly had a full schedule for the day, meetings and events that required the entire royal family, Sherlock shrugged as though driving John was not the slightest inconvenience. “Of course. I love any excuse to drive.”
(and it probably cost more than three months of my mortgage payments).
At my footsteps, he opens his eyes briefly, his gaze sweeping over me before settling back into the sofa again.  After a second, he rumbles, “Hello,” but then says no more.
people,” he says.
I stop in the doorway, reluctant to enter fully.  The comic book is resting on Sherlock's lap and he's reclining against the headboard, eyes closed with hands steepled below his chin.  I lean my shoulder against the doorframe and watch him for a second, enjoying the opportunity to observe a Sherlock at rest, all long lines and smooth skin.
Sherlock followed his brother, speaking to various lords and ladies and accepting their well-wishes and attempts at flattery.  He responded as necessary, but seeing as this required little of his attention, he began cataloguing the room.  With Lestrade outside, he would need to devise a plan to exit the Ritz without being noticed.
I shrug against him.  “Sorry, sorry.  I mean I’ll actually be attending a gallery opening at the V&A.”
PRINCE William himself answers the door, which is unexpected when one is visiting Kensington Palace, but he seems remarkably disinterested in participating in any of the pomp and circumstance that usually surrounds the royal family. So, on a rainy afternoon in January, I find myself being ushered into an eclectically-decorated but cozy drawing room to meet his other half and, unbeknownst to me, to spend the next four hours being altogether charmed by these two men.
“Thanks, Mrs Hudson, I think I will.”
“So, travel?” I prod, trying to get this conversation back on track.
“Failure to properly salute a superior officer, attempting to force entrance into an exclusive club, conduct unbecoming of a Captain of the British Army.  Take your pick, Captain.”
A day passes, and then another and another.
Armon looks momentarily surprised, before he shakes his head and sticks out a hip, “I know I didn’t spend hours finding the perfect look for tonight only to have you flounce outta this flat in that hideous bathrobe.”
I think back over Sherlock’s IMDB page, which I am overly familiar with by now, and I can see the point he’s talking about.  “After
As always, I have to thank my wonderful betas @zigster-ao3, @88thparallel and @eternaljohnlock for their encouragement, patience and notes of inspiration. You're all amazing!
It was John who had made the night memorable, and Sherlock would cherish it always.
The taller soldier butted in, eyes glinting, “You gotta admit that you were proper cheesed, Benton!”
“And you invaded Afghanistan.”
“Food is important!”
Sherlock tried to roll his eyes, but John was pleased to note that he doesn’t quite manage it. “Just push it all onto the floor, John. It’s hardly important.”
This is like watching a tennis match.  I’m surprised that Sherlock is silent -- it seems like he should be continuing the argument I walked in on earlier, but he’s frozen on the sofa next to me, looking unlikely to jump in if this escalates.  In response, I find myself on high alert, like I’m ready to spring into action if Mycroft and Sally descend into a brawl, coffee cup and dressing gown be damned.
“Anthea has managed to track down a list of employees who were at the clinic while you were there.  She’s looking into their backgrounds to see if anyone has potential motive for leaking it to the press.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes in return, and appears to be formulating his next sharp comment, perhaps continuing the argument they were having before I entered the room.  The idea that they are going to carry on sniping at each other and ignore the fact that I was threatened, multiple times, by this man pisses me off.
⟪Sherlock, the nutter sending the texts came into my shop today.  Can I see you?  So I can fill you in and make sure you’re okay?⟫
And thanks to @zigster-ao3 and @eternaljohnlock for helping me get this raggedy chapter into some semblance of order! x
I cringe slightly at his assumption, but it's not completely surprising, I've only been with women since Greg's known me -- first Mary and then a few girlfriends, none of whom lasted longer than two months.
“Mmm.  Probably.”  I feel bloody awful, too, not so much for me but for Sherlock.  What a shit way to start our date.  He catches my eye and we exchange a look that conveys a million things at once --
Before the women could progress any further in their assessment of his failings of duty and comportment, he decided to confirm their assumptions and swiftly stepped around the decor to join the pair.
I’m glad I’m not the only one gaping at him following this statement.  I’ve barely got English down, plus a few random phrases in Pashto and Dari from my Army days.  Not nearly the same as the multilingual marvel sitting next to me.  “Amazing!”
“That was. . .”
I push my shoes off, curl my left leg under me and pull my plate into my lap, leaning back on the arm of the sofa.  Sherlock glances over at me and I offer him a smile, and he frowns in response.
“Do I know what the news story is?  No, I don’t.”
“You must. Okay, you can pour, I’ll grab the milk.”
Mycroft watched him for a moment, shuffled the newspapers into some semblance of order and stood gracefully from his chair.  “I will speak with the King and Queen about your request.  However, I will consider this as a favour to you and the next time you neglect your princely duties, I shall not hesitate to use it to keep you in line.  Are we clear, dear brother?”
As they rocked together to find a shared rhythm (led by Sherlock, of course), John released his grip on Sherlock’s biceps to slide his hands up and over his shoulders, feeling how the shirt slipped along the smooth skin beneath it. His arms crossed behind Sherlock’s neck and his left hand rested lightly over his shoulder, revelling in how the muscles shifted beneath his fingertips as they danced.
No taxis in sight, they ended up crossing back over Chelsea Bridge on foot, the sky beginning to lighten as sunrise drew nearer. Eventually, they flagged down a cab near Grosvenor Road.
“Because you were practically obscene while eating it.  Christ, your mouth and the way you licked your fork.”  I want to moan just remembering it.
It’s the first time I’ve heard from him all day.  After his comments this morning, I expected him to be texting every ten minutes.  Thinking about his prolonged silence makes me wonder if he did make good on his other threat of snooping through my things.  I push that thought aside and reply to his message.
“Just. . . you came into my shop, so I thought you might be looking to travel?  Seems to be why most people visit.  Well, except for those odd few who ignore the shop’s name and come in searching for the latest novel by E. L. James, if you can call it that.  Novel seems like too grand a title for those books. . .”
With a jerky nod, I force myself to walk down the corridor to Sherlock’s bedroom where he’s currently being dressed by Armon.  I knock and stick my head around the door.  Armon is aggressively de-linting a tuxedo jacket that’s hanging on the wardrobe door and Sherlock is staring out the window, hands on his hips.  “Everything okay?”
It’s like the air is punched out of John’s lungs. “Well, it’s good to be accurate.”
“So what, are you just going to live your life, isolated and alone?”
I step out of the car next to him and there is a split-second pause in the screaming, like the throngs of people gathered outside the theatre take a collective gasp as they register what is happening -- that Sherlock Holmes, critically acclaimed and newly out actor, has brought a date to the BAFTAs -- and then the screaming intensifies, louder than before.
Their hands met solidly in the vast space between them and Sherlock held on, clinging to the last few seconds of John’s presence. John allowed this for a moment, but then, when the handshake began to drag on too long, especially in view of the soldiers out front of the hospital, he gave Sherlock’s hand one final squeeze and pulled away.
“Hi,” I say, tentatively.  Sherlock’s eyes are roaming over my body and I know he’s judging my outfit.  Damnit.  He looks fantastic, of course -- grey suit, simple and expertly tailored, white shirt open at the neck, same boots as earlier in the day and one of those pocket squares that I've never been able to pull off.  And he’s holding a bouquet of gorgeous sunflowers.
“Give us a minute, yeah?” I say to Armon and wait until he departs, closing the door with a soft click behind him, before approaching Sherlock.  His shirt is pristinely white and I’m afraid to touch it, so instead I settle my hands on his hips, just below his own, and rest my forehead against the back of his neck.  At the touch, he exhales deeply, and we stand like that for a moment, my breath synching with his.
“It can be rather grim, you realise, how us commoners live. Death, disease, poverty, worrying about how you’re going to get through each day.” John paused and then hastily added, “I don’t mean to mock your dream, don’t get me wrong. I just mean it isn’t some grand adventure, Sherlock.”
Mycroft gave him a curt nod and departed the room.  Sherlock waited until the door had been closed once more before slouching in his chair and grumbling into his teacup about the offensive nature of siblings.  Taking a sip, he quickly discarded the cup of lukewarm tea on the table and levered himself out of the chair and onto the sofa nearest the windows.
The woman put her hands on her hips, scolding Sherlock.  “The King is trying jolly hard to offer words of encouragement and if you don’t want to hear him, then you can just piss off!”
If he wasn’t so out of breath, with a niggling sense of concern over his conduct back at the Curzon Club, then he would have laughed at how this evening had panned out so far.  He’d transformed from being a grouchy invalid to galavanting through the city with this madman by his side.  His Army mates wouldn’t believe the change; he could scarcely believe it himself.
“Why two o’clock?” John asked suddenly. “It won’t take more than twenty minutes to get to the barracks.”
⟪That is atrocious grammar.  What does that even mean? SH⟫
⟪John, that’s not something to joke about.  I will be on that flight regardless of whatever nonsense I’m forced to participate in beforehand. SH⟫
John snorted.  “It does if they’re being arseholes to you.”
Silence settled between them for a moment.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock was nervous upon entering his own home.
I begin ringing up his purchases, which include a historical linguistic book on Polynesian languages, one about colonialism in Papua New Guinea, another about tā moko, the traditional tattooing practices of the Maori, and I’m just about to ring up the Kon Tiki Expedition by Thor Heyerdahl, when Sherlock says “oh, one more” and darts off across the shop again.
I hum in acknowledgement, toss my empty coffee cup in a bin along the path, and shove my hands in my pockets to protect them from the chill.  We keep walking and I kick at some leaves stuck to the pavement.  “I showed it to Sherlock this morning,” I say, finally, glancing at Greg out of the corner of my eye.  Part of me worries that he’ll be hurt that I didn’t show him first.  After all, I never speak about my Army days with him, but now I’m showing my story to someone I’ve only known a few months.
Ahead of him, there was about twenty metres of grass before he reached the pavement along Piccadilly, the edge of the street dotted with trees in that overly planned way of modern cities.  Above the leaves, the Wellington Arch loomed in the centre of the roundabout ahead.  As he neared the pavement, he realised with a jolt that there was a fence barring his path.  He considered veering left or right to find an opening, but the Major, ten years his senior though he may be, was clearly in good shape, so he needed to lose him as quickly as possible and he was too out in the open in this part of London.
This gets my attention.  Agents?  Just who the fuck is Mycroft?  At this point I have more questions than answers and I just want to make everyone stop and explain what the hell is going on.
Thanks so much to @eternaljohnlock for beta-ing this chapter - your reaction comments made me giggle and spurred me on during the editing process! :)
“Right.  Sherlock.”
Received 13/5/2018 10:10
Prince William was at his shoulder now. With a disbelieving shake of his head, John kept walking, but spit out, “Not much to explain. Just a bit of a lark, wasn’t it?”
Papa nodded. “We do not keep much here, but I shall do a whip-round the footmen.”
“Understandable,” Sherlock says and I can feel him thinking as he rests against me.  “So how does it work, you write and Harry illustrates?”
I miss him.
I suddenly feel bad for being a snarky ass.  Sherlock was trying to be sweet and make up for the last few weeks of busy-ness, separation, and rushed visits, and I had to be an insecure jerk about the whole thing.
“How did you -”
“Come on, you nutter.”
At that, the man finally turned around and only then seemed to register that he was not alone in the backseat of the taxi.  His eyes opening comically wide for a brief second as he took in John’s presence.  The man was much younger than John had expected; he was all smooth skin, dark curls, and steely eyes.
“That’s something, I suppose.”
A waiter emerged from the door on the right, carrying a tray of decorated cakes and sweets to a table laden with food along the opposite wall.  Kitchens, then, Sherlock noted.  It would be possible for him to get out that way.  However, he was unfamiliar with the layout of the lower level of the hotel and the staff might question his presence, especially dressed in his tweeds.  The door on the left stayed stubbornly closed, giving Sherlock no greater insight into what lay beyond it.
“Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead once famously exclaimed that parks are ‘the lungs of the city’ -- I can’t disagree with him.  Despite still being able to hear the traffic from the main road and knowing that there are a multitude of families going about their business in houses not 20 metres from here, green spaces still give the illusion of being in an urban oasis of fresh air and organic matter.”
In the space between the crowd of dancers around him, amidst swishing skirts and flying arms, Sherlock suddenly had a clear view across the hall, as though the curtains had been pulled back across a stage, allowing him to see a familiar officer speaking with two other soldiers in red hats and pointing in their direction.
Sherlock leaned down so his mouth was once again near John’s ear and that sinful voice whispered, “Dance with me, John.”
Dear John,
He makes me ramble.  Greg is always complaining that he can’t pull more than three words from me and here I am talking absolute floods of nonsense to Sherlock Holmes.  I’ve spent this morning alternating between dread and embarrassment in a way I haven’t done since secondary school.
The paths of Kensington Gardens veering off in different directions are scattered with wet leaves and grey clouds hang in the sky, but even their threat of rain can’t dampen my spirits today.  I feel lighter than I have in a long time, as if opening up to one person has lifted a weight from my shoulders.  It makes me think I should be more truthful with the other people in my life.
On Sunday, I wake up groggy and out of sorts after a poor night’s sleep.  It’s tempting to stay in bed all day, but that would achieve nothing.  I’d just lay there stewing in my confusion, hurt, and anger from the last week.  Huffing out a long sigh, I heave myself out of my bed, shuffle into the loo to take a piss and then make my way to the kitchen for a cup of tea.
The fact that Sherlock is so open about his affection still catches me off guard, even after being surrounded by it for weeks.  After a brief internal freakout, the likes of which are becoming less frequent,  I finally get my fingers to tap out a reply.  ⟪I miss you, too.  Text me when you’re at the airport.⟫
Sherlock smiles at that and I feel like I’ve accomplished something.  “Tea would be nice.”
Which only serves to make me laugh harder.  I gasp, “People will talk.”
Jesus.  That line was a bit much, wasn’t it?  John shuddered, warmth pooling at the base of his spine.  Maybe he had time to wank before Sherlock reappeared in the flat.  Not that his presence ever stopped John from masturbating, but there was something freeing about having the flat to himself.  He enjoyed not having to force himself to be as quiet as possible or to rub one out in the shower.  (Despite his attempts to hide it, Sherlock always seemed to know and would either roll his eyes or give him a knowing smirk when John reappeared.  The latter John could never think about too closely.)
The silence was unbearable. Occasionally, the clink of teacups being set down on saucers broke it, joined by the sounds of the footmen laying the table for breakfast at the other end of the room.
“I think I quoted Linus.”
“I think it’s their job to get you ready for your big night, Sherlock.  Not that it takes much effort because you’re bloody gorgeous even like this,” I say, gesturing to his current ensemble of ratty pyjamas and dressing gown.
John had been gazing out the window lost in thought as he watched the streets of London roll by outside, but he startled out of his reverie at the driver’s question.
John stepped closer to Sherlock and raised his chin so he could look him in the eye.  “That’s all well and good, Sherlock, and you are free to think whatever you want, but people have struggled and faced tremendous loss over the last five years and they just might find the King’s words comforting, tonight especially.  I know I do, so maybe you can just shut it, yeah?”
“Hey, now, it’s not my fault - it’s just some strong whisky.”  Still laughing, John raised the flask again.  “Not much of a drinker, are you?  Was it worse than the lager?”  At Sherlock’s nod, he said, “Go slow.  Take small sips.”
“Sorry, mate.  Traffic’s ‘orrible tonight.  Not in a ‘urry, are ya?”
As the kettle boils, I retrieve The Guardian from where it’s dropped just inside the front door.  I flip through the pages as I potter about the kitchen, taking in a headline here and there.   I linger over my cup of tea, cradling it in my hands as I read a depressing story of yet another mass shooting in America.  How many more of those are they going to let happen before they actually do something?
Sherlock is once again curled up in my chair with a book in hand.  “Hi,” he says, too tentatively.
“Not to me.”
Major Lestrade gave him a precise salute and exited the room.
The brothers stared at each other for a few seconds, communicating in minute expressions that only they could interpret. John glanced back and forth between them attempting to understand, but it all happened too quickly.
“Yes, the question is this: if this unpleasant revelation about my past wasn’t in the press, or perhaps more accurately, despite this unpleasant revelation about my past being in the press, and the fact that I behaved so badly before, I was wondering if you might let me see you a bit or a lot maybe, if perhaps you could. . . like me again?”
“Isn’t he wonderful?” Mrs Hudson asked, gazing fondly at John. “Always willing to lend a helping hand. You are lucky to count him as a friend, young man.”
Sherlock smiles and it’s when he opens his mouth to reply, perhaps to suggest a restaurant, that I suddenly remember that, of course, this is the one evening this week when I actually have plans.
“When is Sally getting here?”
“Yes, of course,” he said finally with a soft sigh. “But then, it seems that we are all stuck in one cage or another, yours is just more gilded than most. What would you do then, if you were truly free to do whatever you wanted?”
He sighed.  “Where are you going in this taxicab?” he asked again, very slowly as if John couldn’t understand English.
Run-in with Sherlock Holmes aside, the future of my shop is up in the air.  I’ve put off thinking about it for months now, but I think it’s time to admit that we’re a sinking ship and we’re going down quickly.  Not that it’s too surprising, really, with me and the world’s worst shop assistant at the helm.  But if we fold, which is looking more likely, I have no bloody clue what to do with my life.  The future is just a grey mist on the horizon, blurring any and all potential plans beyond recognition.
Sherlock turns back to me, highly unimpressed.  “We’re not going to cause any damage.  We’re simply going to take a walk through the gardens.”  He narrows his eyes, “Are you always such a stickler for the rules?”  I can practically hear the eyeroll that accompanies that last word.
“Your Highness, I will wait just outside if you need anything.  I hope you enjoy your evening.”  This last statement grated on Sherlock’s nerves - how was he supposed to enjoy himself surrounded by aging nobles and his brother whilst accompanied by a chaperone?  He turned to fix his eyes on the Major to his right, taking in small details about the man.
In the taxi, Prince Henry rubbed his temple in frustration. John could imagine Sherlock being a nightmare of a younger brother and Prince Henry had probably put up with a lot over the years. He smothered a grin at the thought.
My updates have been completely erratic and I imagine they will continue to be that way.  So...hope you like random surprise updates!
- The text Sherlock sends “The unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased to deserve the name” is a quote taken from one of ACD’s other works, the Stark Munro Letters, which I’ve taken out of context and repurposed to fit here.
Sherlock and his manager may be used to having the details of his life discussed by the press in this manner, but it feels all a bit too much for me.  And if this is how the BBC are reporting on it, then I can only imagine how awful the Daily Mail and their like are being to him.  It’s invasive and cruel, yet seemingly commonplace for someone with the level of fame that Sherlock has.
My stomach rumbles again, which causes us both to laugh, and we dig in, heaping our plates full of food.  Sherlock pours red wine for us both and we settle in to eat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock didn’t reply immediately, but then said, “Nor mine.”
This drew a startled laugh from John. He shook his head and stared hard at his teacup, anywhere but at Sherlock.
“You texted yourself,” I say.  It’s supposed to come out like an accusation, but it sounds like breathless wonder.  I can’t stop the grin that’s spreading across my face.
His mind reeled at the possibilities, but there was one thing that called to him like a siren. The city lived and breathed around him and yet he only flitted across the surface, seeing the sparkling halls of the grandest buildings. There was so much more to London that he had yet to learn, and the little glimpse he had tonight of this other London, an underworld beneath the city he usually saw, only made him yearn for more.
It’s then that I notice everyone in the room watching us with unrestrained interest.  It’s probably the first time any of them have seen Sherlock relaxed and playful, instead of his usual whirlwind of sharp words and disinterest.  I hug him a little closer at the thought.
Both Mike and Nicola seem completely unfazed by Sherlock’s celebrity status and Nicola is currently in the middle of a story about one of her Year 5 pupil’s increasingly ridiculous excuses for not having her homework completed.  Mike is watching her adoringly as she talks, gesturing for emphasis.  Sherlock’s is laughing politely and asking questions that keep her chatting.
Blood thrumming in his veins, John paused briefly before nodding his agreement and was promptly released.  Turning around in the tight space, he found himself face to face with the curly-haired man from the taxi.  He was focused, eyes and ears, on the alley beyond them, his thin frame radiating nervous energy.  John’s mind was reeling with questions: What was going on?  From what was the man running?  Who was chasing them?  Had he, John, lost his mind?
Sherlock grinned. “Correct. I have made irritating Mycroft my lifelong mission.”
The rest of my evening is occupied by doing the washing up, sorting through the stack of post that’s piled up over the last few days, and continuing my binge-watch of season two of
Greg makes a frustrated noise and I can picture him pinching the bridge of his nose.  “Why didn’t you tell me before now, like right after you got that first text?”  He’s struggling to keep his voice down -- Molly is probably asleep next to him -- but I can hear the exasperation, nonetheless.
And, as ever, thanks to my lovely betas @zigster-ao3 and @eternaljohnlock for looking this one over! <3
“Well, he’s got me,” I say stubbornly.
⟪I'm not gossiping with you while I'm at work.  Aren't you supposed to be out keeping London safe?⟫
“Don’t tell anyone -- wouldn’t want to ruin my reputation as most hated man in Hollywood.”
“John, what’s happened?  You’re clearly upset.”
The tall captain stepped into John’s office and removed his hat. “I’ve settled Meyers and Stryuk in Ward 1 as instructed, Sir, and the rest have been placed in Ward 4 to convalesce. Meyers awoke as we transferred him but he was coherent and understood his new circumstances, asking if we’d update his mother. I will ensure a telegram is sent later today. Sryuk, however, is slipping in and out of consciousness. He’s talking but not making much sense. I suggested the nurses keep a close eye on him over the next forty-eight hours.”
John glanced up at Sherlock, who stood over them, his eyes surveying the supine soldier. “Yes, very.”
“John, it’s so late!”
Hustling along the street, I fire off a text to both Greg and Mike to inform them that I’ll be a little late and continue to speed walk the twenty minutes to the pub, the physical exertion helping to mute the jumble of thoughts tumbling through my mind.
Sherlock blanches.  “No, I didn't mean.  .  . John, it's not you who is the liability.  It's me, my behaviour, my recklessness.”
“Well, good night, then.”
It couldn’t have been more perfect if it was the plot of a film.
The silence reigns until Armon, looking from Sherlock to the others in the room, as if challenging any of them to object to the command, says “Time to get you in that fabulous suit.”
Finding it alongside Mycroft’s on the second rack along the wall, Sherlock threw it around his shoulders and walked towards the door across from him.  Best make this a quick escape.  Pressing his ear to the carved oak, Sherlock couldn’t make out any sounds on the other side, but was not certain it wouldn’t deposit him in another reception room. It seemed quiet, however, and a better option than returning to the dull party behind him or staying in this cloakroom.
He contemplates the shirt and then reaches a hand out to take it from me before retreating behind the door.  Exhaling deeply, I head back to the kitchen and pop the kettle on out of habit.  It’s just about boiled when I hear the bathroom door open again.
“I know,” replied Sherlock.
“He won’t,” Mycroft says with finality.
One of the women made a soft noise and he dragged his attention back to the pair.  They were now inconsequential and he walked away swiftly, eyes darting between the door in the corner and Mycroft, who, thankfully, was still engaged in conversation with a small group of nobles and Army officers across the room.
Sherlock shook her off and glanced over his shoulder, only to discover that the Colonel and his entourage were moving towards them around the edge of the dancefloor, pushing revellers aside in their haste. He had to reach John first.
Sherlock didn’t release him however, so he had the challenge of shifting piles of post, academic journals and various experiment accoutrements with a limited range of motion.
“Write what?” he queried, and Sherlock was pleased to note John’s discomfort at the question as he squirmed in his seat.
He finally meets my eye and there’s a flash of something I can’t quite place in his.  “Hello,” he says.  “For your sister.”  He gives a slight shrug to indicate the flowers.
The temperature dropped as the sun sank lower in the sky and John shivered. Of course, it didn’t escape Sherlock’s keen, observational eye and he turned them back towards the french doors. John reached out to open them, but Sherlock beat him to it in a bizarre reversal of roles. He smiled shyly at John and gestured him forward into the welcoming warmth of the foyer.
After ringing off with Greg, the rest of the afternoon passes with me trying to pretend like nothing is wrong, which is made harder when two police officers turn up for my statement.  Thankfully, there aren’t any customers in the shop when they arrive and I escort them into the office, ignoring Anderson’s shocked face.
I brace myself.  It’s impossible to predict what Harry is going to come out with, especially after a few drinks.
“Get out o’ the way, ya lunatic! What the hell are you doing, standin’ in the street?  I coulda hit you,” the driver ranted, gesturing wildly. “Still might if you don’t shift it!”
With that, I am curious to learn more about how this fairy tale romance started. The royal announcement about their ceremony last year only stated that they had been together for over five decades and gave no clues as to how they met or shared any details of their life together. In speaking with them this afternoon, I feel honoured that they have chosen to open up their home and so bravely share their story with me and the world.
.  The film already had good early reviews, but it received a major boost following the interview in which Sherlock came out to a very surprised reporter just before Christmas.
I nod.  “I really am.  Forgive me?”
“Yeah, it was good.  Good but embarrassing -- really can’t trust my friends to behave.  Total menaces, that lot!  You coped remarkably well.”
John smiled. “No, that’s okay. I can figure it out.”
Now, all those feelings he’d thought he had buried were bubbling up to the surface again. That night with Sherlock was one of the happiest of his life, and he would be lying if he said that he hadn’t sought other people and situations that would mimic, even to the slightest degree, that feeling of running through the streets of London with Sherlock. Nothing compared, however, so he contented himself with simpler aspirations, a life shaped by the sharp routines of an army hospital.
That wasn’t a very reassuring message.  I glance at the clock -- it’s nearly quarter past five and I decide to close up early for the day.  I send Anderson home with a promise he’ll still be paid for his full hours and then flick over the sign to ‘closed’ to keep away any potential customers.
Frown deepening and enunciation precise, Papa replied, “Interesting choice of phrasing, Sherlock. For as Mycroft tells it, your parting was more of an escape.”
John snorted.  “That’s putting it mildly.”
“There are three key pieces of information that will provide some context for my seemingly disrespectful and mercurial behaviour towards you previously.  Things you couldn’t have known or I didn’t let you know while we were. . . together. . . before,” he says, looking up as though to gauge my reaction before continuing his explanation.  I raise an eyebrow.  He nods and takes a deep breath.
I splutter, “But we’re not allowed.”
After awhile, the conversation is interrupted by the doorbell.  I rise to answer it so they can keep chatting.  It’s Mike and his wife Nicola and I receive hugs from them both as they enter.
Sherlock appeared unimpressed by this answer and he walked away, returning to the site of the soldier’s fall. John watched him pace about, studying the ground with a slight frown. After a moment, Sherlock stood upright and turned back to him, an excited grin lighting up his face. “John! A second set of footprints!”
(See the end of the chapter for
I tilt my head back so I can better slot my mouth against his and deepen the kiss, my hands going to the lapels of his suit jacket, envelope still clutched awkwardly in my right hand.  Sherlock makes a soft ‘mmm’ -- I shiver at the sound -- and then again when his hands come to rest on my hips.
Despite knowing John for less than a day, and accepting that their connection was only ever going to be temporary, Sherlock was surprised by the intensity of his feelings for this man. The surge of sentimentality, something he had not thought himself capable, nearly overwhelmed him. It was horrible yet he would not change a single moment. Out of all the possibilities, meeting John was the only thing of consequence that could have happened on his evening of freedom. Had their paths not crossed, he would have trundled about London, awkward and alone and thoroughly disillusioned.
He’s dressed to ward off the chill of the evening -- long grey coat, collar pulled up around his ears, a blue cashmere scarf wrapped around his neck, hands in his pocket.  His eyes look haunted and his shoulders are slumped, the effect startles me, it’s so unlike his usual demeanor.
And a huge thank you to my wonderful betas @zigster-ao3 and @eternaljohnlock - I could not have completed this fic without you both! xx
“I don’t think that’ll be necessary.” After a moment, he added, “Your Highness.”
“Erm. . .”  I’m not sure what to say as I stand in my pants, holding the takeaway coffees.  I wish Sherlock would hurry up and get out here to deal with her so I can get dressed properly.  When he does emerge, he’s simply wrapped in the bedsheet, which does not help the situation in the slightest.
Sherlock nods and appears to rethink his approach.  I wait for him to begin.
“Yes, well, he’s got quite a nasty gash on the back of his head, Sherlock.  I’m not surprised there’s blood!”
He stands tall and handsome in his tuxedo, the night sky and lights from the theatre casting a blue glow around him as camera flashes sparkle in the background.  The red carpet is a streak of colour to the right of him, guiding us into the theatre.  For a moment, I’m reminded of a painting I saw once on a rare trip the Tate.  A Chagall, I think.  The colours.  The feeling.
John groaned and unenthusiastically rolled himself out of his chair. “Fine. But this will be embarrassing, just so you know.”
“Oh, Sherlock.”  I trace my thumb over his brow and then pull his face to mine, pressing a firm, brief kiss to his lips.  “I do trust you, I do.”
When I get home, the scent of curry tempts me up the stairs and my stomach rumbles in anticipation.  Clearly Sherlock, or Sally, rather, had indeed sorted it out, although that still leaves me feeling uncomfortable.
The corner of his mouth hints at a smile and he begins browsing the bookshelves again. “Nothing worse than being predictable.”
Gathering all his courage, John looked over at Sherlock and was met by a piercing gaze. They stared at each other for a second, John reading a flurry of emotion in Sherlock’s eyes before the other man schooled his expression and turned to the redhats, ignoring the Colonel, red-faced and fuming, completely.
“I had thought as much.”
The doorman looked doubtful.  “Perhaps I can phone Army Headquarters -”
The personal struggle of addiction is difficult for anyone, I know -- memories of my father’s long descent into alcoholism stick with me still -- but I imagine it’s even more complicated when you’re a public figure.  It can’t be pleasant for the darker parts of your life to be picked apart by the world.
It was pitched low, one syllable stretched out infinitely to curl through the air and dance along his skin.  He said nothing but John’s name, and it sounded like a command, but there was a neediness behind it that caused John’s blood to run hot in his veins.  Fuck.
Today, with Anderson stationed at the till, I meander through the shop, checking on the customers who are browsing, answering questions and making suggestions when requested.  One man has a million questions about New Zealand, and while I’ve never been, I’ve read enough to bullshit my way through my recommendations and he saunters off to pay for three books about the islands.
“Sherlock, hello.” John was impressed with how calm he sounded. “It’s good to see you.”
After receiving a few elbows to the kidneys as he pushed his way through the throng of people, Sherlock finally re-emerged at the foot of the lion statue to see John leaning against it, feet crossed at the ankle, flag held loosely in his left hand, and one eyebrow raised, clearly waiting for him.  Not that Sherlock thought that John would have disappeared, but the fact that he was still here made Sherlock inexplicably happy.
“John --” Sherlock says, hand out as though trying to gentle me as one would a horse.  His eyes track my movement but he doesn’t come any closer.  We stare at each other, forgetting for a moment that there’s someone else in the room, and then there’s a knock at the flat door.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Anderson.” I decide to ignore my embarrassment and focus on Anderson as a target for my outrage. If nothing else, I’m exceptionally attached to my stereotypically British ability to stifle my emotions and carry on regardless.
As they slipped into the darkness within a narrow alcove behind one of the grand houses, Sherlock’s nerves ratcheted up, his palms sweating and his mouth going dry. The space was just wide enough for them to slip into sideways, chests nearly pressed together. Sherlock was reminded of a moment earlier in the evening when they had found themselves in a similar position, and if someone had asked him then, he would never had he imagined that his night would have taken this turn. But here he was, full of nervous anticipation as the most interesting man he had ever met stood mere centimeters from him, eyes dark and beguiling as they gazed at each other in the dim light.
“Mmhmm -- Oh, wait, I got something for dessert!”  I pull away, throwing Sherlock a cheeky grin as I rummage through the bag on the counter and pull out a packet of Hobnobs.  “For old times’ sake?”
An arm descends around my shoulders, startling me back to reality.  “Hey, Johnny,” Greg beams at me, before pulling me into an uncomfortable hug.  He’s in his uniform, his helmet making him appear taller and the neon yellow of his jacket blinding in the dimmer light of the shop.
He took a step closer to Sherlock’s side and asked, voice flat, “What’s going on?”
He shrugged. “Mycroft and Papa make it so easy.”
“What is it?” Sherlock asks.
Winston Churchill
He wanted to disagree, but he realised he couldn’t.  John had enjoyed himself - the evening had taken a turn when Sherlock attempted to commandeer his cab.  Following him had been stupid and impulsive and positively thrilling.  John felt a grin curling at his lips and he let out a laugh.
The Colonel took two steps up so he was even with Sherlock and clasped his hands behind his back.  He was standing so close that Sherlock could smell the alcohol and tobacco on him, underpinned by the tang of sweat.  “Watch your tone, young man.”
I catch Sherlock’s eye briefly and that only serves to set us both off again.  Finally, with a great effort, I pull myself together, taking deep breaths and wiping tears from my eyes.
“Mmmhmm, just never had anyone to dance with before,” Sherlock said, his arms tightening fractionally around John’s waist.
John’s fury was met with a pair of unimpressed dark eyes staring down at him.
Sally whistles and the others shout comments at him, so clearly I’m not the only one who thinks he looks good.  Sherlock seems slightly bashful at the attention, but he hides it well under a layer of bored indifference.
. Had he ever had a friend before? Besides Mycroft and various courtiers who sought greater position with the royal family, Sherlock could not think of one, at least not since childhood when the son of one of the palace gardeners had befriended him, but even that had not lasted. Mummy deemed it inappropriate for him to be spending time with Victor and had put a stop to it, leaving Sherlock on his own once more. The thought of having John's friendship made him feel warm, but a wave of guilt quickly eclipsed this feeling. Lying to John was detestable but necessary. He wished they could truly be friends, without this big secret laying between them. It seemed that Sherlock would have to settle for having this one night only. While he wished it did not have to end, if that all he was to have of John’s friendship, then he would consider himself lucky.
I look at them both, grateful for their understanding.  “Cheers.  I, um, I’ll text you later, okay?”
“I am not going anywhere with you.”
A bang echoes down the street and Sherlock and I pull apart in surprise.  The moment is broken.
Beneath his fingers, Sherlock’s skin was pale, smooth and beautiful; John’s hands looked unusually tanned in comparison. He watched in fascination as his fingers travelled across Sherlock’s face, examination long over. Sherlock sat, silent, letting him explore, a soft flush spreading across his cheeks.
John cleared his throat. “Yes, that’s me.”
He jogs out of the shop, following his partner Dimmock back onto the street.
She shrugs.  “It’s true.  Anyway, I’m actually glad you’re here because Sherlock’s been a nightmare all day and he tends to go a bit soppy when you’re around.  Makes my job easier.”
Molly and Harry disappear into the kitchen to put the flowers in water, Molly calling over her shoulder that dinner will be ready soon.  Greg jumps to attention and herds the rest of us towards the dining table, where he leaves us in order to help Molly in the kitchen.
With a final glance at the map on my phone, I set off towards Northumberland Street, and then am held up by a traffic light.  Instead of normal green men, the crossings in this part of the city now have LGBT+ pride symbols -- the green light guiding me across the road at the moment are the figures of two men holding hands, forming a heart in the space between their bodies.  I take it as a good luck charm for the evening ahead.
After this speech, I feel the intensity of three sets of eyes staring at me, waiting.
He must have the encyclopedia memorised -- he just pulls these random facts from nowhere.  He’s amazing.
After a quick wash and shave, John threw together a measly breakfast of toast and two rashers of bacon. He brought his cup of tea back through to the bedroom, and began to pull on his full dress uniform, the navy fabric stiff from lack of wear. Fitting the silk sash about his waist, John sought out his shoes and gave them one last buff so that they would shine as brilliantly as possible on this gloomy day. The King had been a kind man and John wanted to look his best to honour him.
. . . armed or unarmed, men and women, you have fought, striven, and endured to your utmost.  No one knows that better than I do; and as your King. . .
“I bet it does,” he says, waggling his eyebrows at me.  “Let’s get a coffee and you can tell me all about it. . .  Well, some of it.  Maybe keep the more risqué details to yourself.”  Greg claps me on the shoulder and steers me to the counter, loudly proclaiming to the barista, “Whatever he  wants, it’s on me!”
“What is it, boss?” Anderson’s greasy head pops round the doorframe.
Sherlock freezes under me, a look of wariness flitting across his features.
At the top, they were joined by Lestrade.
“Wait, what?  How is that possible?”
Caught up in my musings, I’ve forgotten my coffee and now, of course, it’s gone cold.  Spotting a bin on the street corner, I wind around a couple walking the opposite way on the pavement and  reach out my cup to toss it in the bin and --
“Well, I had to!” Sherlock exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air, blood-stained  handkerchief fluttering brightly in the dim light. “In case you have not noticed, I live my life in a bubble. I have never made a cup of blooming tea for myself, let alone been out on my own. Not once, not properly. I am always chaperoned, hence Major Lestrade’s presence. I am aware that it might sound ridiculous, but I needed to be away from it all, to know how the people were celebrating, and tonight nobody gave a damn who I was. If I had not ended up in your taxi, I would never have had the opportunity to just be...ordinary, on the most extraordinary night of my life.”
“Yes, sir.” Lestrade said at the same time as Sherlock screeched, “The Ritz!”  He looked at Mycroft, whose mouth was twisted into a smug line, and realised the restrictions of their outing were not a surprise to his brother.  Now his choice of attire made sense.
“I just don’t respect those who threaten me or my friends.”
“Hi,” I breathe out, looking up at his face, trying to channel his skills and assess what’s going on with him.  “Thanks for coming.”
“Well, weren't you, Mac?  You saw the way he looked at us, like we wasn’t worthy of setting foot in the place.  We won this bloody war, the least they could do was let us celebrate the end of it in style!”
Sherlock seems to deflate a bit and he nods.  “This film is a reflection of me and. . . and I was asked so many times during interviews about the experience of playing a gay character and I couldn't answer honestly.”  He leans back against me and grabs my hands to pull them around his middle.  “I need it to do well, not just for my continued career but because it’s the first time I’ve truly felt like me on screen.”
John smiled around his forkful of eggs.
Instead of answering, the man fixed him with a glare, turned his shoulder and stepped into the alley.  Annoyed at being ignored and left behind – again! – John followed, hands in fists at his sides, muttering under his breath.
“As I stated, I needed to get away from a misunderstanding and your taxi, as you insist on calling it, though I did not know it was occupied when I flagged it down, was the most logical and expedient way to do so,” the man sneered back at him.  “It is not as though you were en route to a destination of significant importance.  It was a perfectly reasonable suggestion to drive me to Trafalgar Square as it would not have -”
“Shit.  We’re not supposed to be in here!”  I whisper urgently to Sherlock.
⟪Just thought you might not want to piss anyone off before being stuck on an international flight with them.⟫
“Just let me get a picture for Instagram,” Armon says, pulling out his phone and nudging Sherlock towards the bookshelves that line one end of the room.
Jesus.
“Shut up, Greg,” I murmur, lifting my head from my hands.  Turning to Sherlock, I plead, “Can we please leave so I can escape any further humiliation from these absolute horrors?”
The Major stared at him, unblinking and silent.
The next hour or so passes without incident -- and without customers.  I collapse the now-empty boxes, books mostly out on their correct shelves, and I bind them with twine before setting them outside the shop to be collected by the binmen.  I have a list of a few titles to re-order, which I leave by my computer in the office to be ordered at some future time when I can be bothered logging onto the system.
“No need to worry about me -- I’ve got security measures in place.”
With a final half-smile, Papa turned and walked out of the Morning Room. With his departure, the four remaining diners lapsed into silence once again. Mycroft still seemed rather irked about the events of the previous night and had only spoken in clipped sentences with an occasional glare thrown Sherlock’s way throughout the morning. Lestrade was focused on his food, perhaps thinking that the sooner he completed his meal, the sooner he could be away from them all. Sherlock did not blame him.
