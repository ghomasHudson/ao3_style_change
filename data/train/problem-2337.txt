Everyone from the day shift had gone home already, and a vacuum was echoing its approach from down the corridor.
‘Alright, alright, John listen to me,’ Greg urged. ‘You’ve got to help us with this. You’ve started to,’ he pulled John’s face up, ‘listen, listen to me.’
‘I don’t want to do this with Sherlock!’ John could feel an instant reaction from Sherlock at his words.
‘John, stop. He’ll be back. Please stay put.’ Sherlock placed the blanket between himself and John as a barrier.
‘John, no sit up. Get up, John,’ instructed Lestrade. Greg looked to Sherlock and gestured that Sherlock should get back into the bed.
John cried, but Sherlock petted at John's face as he lay in front of John on his side. 'Greg, are you going to bite him? Should I?' He continued to squeeze John's hand.
Greg put a hand on John's shoulder 'Not necessarily. The meds have been known to fail some after many years of use. I'm must glad that we could help, and that it happened when I could take break form work,' he chuckled as he tried to lighten the mood.
Greg had been trying to keep his distance since he’d assisted Sherlock’s successful knotting.  He stood at a distance from Sherlock’s bed and had allowed the coupling to continue naturally without any more of his ‘God damned interference’ as Sherlock had phrased it while John was passed out beneath him.
John squeezed his hand in Lestrade's. 'Mmm, this is certainly new.' He took several deep breaths. He did what he could to account the sensations Sherlock was giving him as a necessary medical procedure, no different than the countless pelvic exams he'd performed in his career as a GP. 'I feel sort of, um, swollen, I guess. Definitely getting more blood flow.' John worried about working up to an erection. He consciously pushed away thoughts on how his anatomy had changed in this universe. 'Ah! Ow!' John winched and jerked forward to stop Sherlock from pushing further. 'Stop! Don't push anymore.'
'I know you're hungry, John,' Greg said as he returned to the sink to wash utensils for them all, 'but try to keep it light. If you have too much in you, you're likely to cramp or lose your dinner.'
‘No doubt, but none of us are going to get much rest. He is old for his first heat. This may take longer than the average. Just go and sit with him. I need to make a few calls.’ Lestrade reached to pat Sherlock on the shoulder, realized that he was still shirtless, and thought better of it. His hand hung in the air for a moment and then dropped awkwardly. He then started off toward the kitchen.
'Oy, Sherlock! Be sure to use as little of the perfumed soaps as possible while you're in there,' added Greg. Too much variation in smells was never recommended for an omega in John's state, nor for anyone involved in the heat. Hearing the shower down the hall from the bedroom, Lestrade sighed heavily in relief. He looked down at John's relaxed face and wondered how much longer John would need assistance. He likely wasn't even at the half way point and that was a concern him for both John and Sherlock. Greg wasn't sure how much John could endure mentally and physically, and Sherlock was quite obviously leaning toward a permanent bond with his flat-mate and side-kick. From what Greg knew of John, he wasn't sure if John would tolerate such a change in the relationship. John had proven that he would risk his life for Sherlock, but a future with Sherlock was in question every time he requested their presence on a case. Sherlock grated at John's patience and it always showed.
Sherlock and John were left entangled on the rug while Lestrade fetched a wet cloth from the kitchen. He returned and knelled back down at his spot next to John’s head. He brushed the cloth across John’s brow and neck.
Sherlock’s breathing canted, and he pulled John flush against him. ‘Jo – ah!’ Finally Sherlock released inside of John.
Sherlock jerked John’s hip back and pinned his very firm erection against John’s backside. One hand kept a tight grip at John’s hip bone as another hand swept down between John’s cheeks. Fingers swirled and penetrated.
The smaller man groaned and growled in frustration. 'You're not in right, ah! Ow, ow, please wait!' He thrashed.
Hands positioned John’s hips, and the firm rod of flesh pressed against John’s opening.  It remained there, as though hesitant, and John bent forward against Greg submissively. The motionless press of Sherlock’s member against his hole was maddening.
He wavered against Sherlock for an interminable moment as Sherlock seemed to consider if he should touch him or not.
John screamed. His previously lax body contorted in a sudden spasm of undirected muscle contractions, and though Sherlock struggled to maintain the press of their bodies, John pulled away from the knot and cried out at the rude pain at his backside.
'Work on your breathing. Just focus on breathing and staying as relaxed as possible. Okay, Sherlock ease in along my finger as gently as you can. As you feel it, I'm going to move my finger out. Beautiful, John, just keep your breathing slow and even.' Lestrade sounded almost gleeful. 'You're doing so great.'
John whined and lifted his knees higher to angle the thrusts deeper. John's breathing slowed noticeably, and both of his hands grabbed at the clenching buttocks of the hips thrusting into him and pulled lightly, struggling to get the head of the member inside of him to strike against his cervix just right. His head tipped back and his eye lashes fluttered, and the internal orgasm crashed over him like a wave. He sighed and moaned as his body sang with an all encompassing nirvana. His fingers and toes tingled with an electric charge from muscle contractions in the center of his pelvis. Wave after intense, clenching wave ravaged John, and his channel squeezed around the member inside of him, and it only intensified the sensation as his body tried to pull the twitching member deeper inside. As the orgasm slowly ebbed, John relaxed his muscles in his stomach and legs.
His hands reached for Sherlock. One found the back of Sherlock’s head and it pulled Sherlock deeper into his neck. The other found the sharp point of Sherlock’s hip bone.
It was after this wrestling with his confusion that John decided to fully participate. He may not know what was happening or what to do, but he would accept the care that his friends were offering.
Lestrade pushed his face between John’s shoulder and chin and found the sore spot on John’s neck from where he’d bitten him before. This time he nipped and sucked at the bruise, and John hushed a little.
Rather than argue with John, who was clearly delusional, Lestrade stood and indicated to Sherlock with a look that he wanted to speak in private. ‘I’m going to have a quick word with Sherlock, John. Drink that water in the meantime. We are going to be in the hall.’
Greg was left with John staring at him. ‘Best we leave him to it,’ Lestrade whispered. At John’s still dubious stare, he elaborated, ‘Instincts to protect and provide and all. You’ve got to remember that this is his first frenzy as well.’
John shuddered, and blood quickly drained from his head to his arousal. The sensation of Sherlock filling him, all be it against his express wishes, and being held so intimately in his hand . . . to feel and smell his hot breath on his neck . . .
John clawed at Greg’s shoulders as he kept pushing him. He was slick but Sherlock couldn’t penetrate him entirely. The swell of flesh at Sherlock’s base was too thick to slip inside of John.
'We both are,' Lestrade answered. 'However there are ways to lessen the severity and permanence. The less, well, the more aware you are, John, the better. The less you can appear to be a crying and desperate omega - no that sounds - what I mean to say - '
'But if you're progressing as I hope, we can move onto the more, um, fun parts of  your heat. Do you remember how you were feeling last night?' Greg continued.
Sherlock succeeded in unlocking the final padlock and gave Lestrade a harsh look. ‘John is my dearest friend, and I do not trust anyone else with his well-being. I quite comprehend the consequences, and if he were to bond with anyone, I would prefer it to be you.’
John bucked his hips back to Lestrade and groaned. 'Please, please.' His voice was a near whisper as they man-handled him into a new position. He reached behind himself to reach out for Greg. Greg took his hand, and John had each of his hands held by either friend. He grasped at them as if he were falling into an abyss. 'Please, please. Bite me. Anything.' A pillow was planted under the right side of his face.
‘John was adamant. He did not want a bond mate, and he did not want to experience a heat. If I were to find an alpha for him – ‘
‘Fuck, Greg, please just you, kay? Please? I’ll do this. I’ll do this all you want, but just you, Greg. Greg?’ pleaded Watson.
John was also frustrated that the member inside of him was missing the possible pleasure zones. He cried out and tried to push his way into a more comfortable position on the inflated penis. The teeth on the back of his neck let go and sent another shock of pain through him as the pressure on the nerves there was released. He screamed.
'If I don't do them, then they only get done when Sherlock and I are out on a case, and Mrs. Hudson does them. I guess with me locked in the flat, Sherlock never - oh, Sherlock, you're awake. Sorry, did we wake you? You must be famished. I know I am,' continued John. he was dressed in a PJ top and bottom that Sherlock recalled as being a Christmas gift from John's sister last year.
of course John thought. He also thought that Letrade was dragging this out more than necessary. He squeezed Lestrade’s arm.
‘What’s – what are you?’ Sherlock dropped his mobile to the bedroom floor with a clatter and rushed to John’s side. He was back in time to witness Lestrade removing the phallus that was holding his release inside of his mate.
Sherlock’s erection was still in question, and John tried to ease onto it. It wasn’t easy to work in a limp dick, and John had no experience to draw upon.
Lestrade slipped away and padded all the way down the bare-wood staircase. He shook his head at Sherlock’s elaborate set of locks and latches, and it took him several minutes before he was able to open the door. He was hit by a burst of cool fresh air if the air in London could be called fresh. He breathed deeply and felt energized by the clearing of his senses.
‘No, no, Sher, that is exactly what he needs right now. We’ve got him through the hardest part, and now he needs time to sort this out without us telling him what to do.’ Greg rummaged through the wreck of tossed furniture, books and pillows and found his discarded shirt.
Between Greg and Sherlock’s touch, John was overwhelmed with sensation, and he couldn’t bare the counter instincts to pull away from Sherlock’s intrusion and push away Greg’s urging hands for him to stay still for Sherlock. He cried out.
Sherlock finally knelt with his long white limbs surrounding John. ‘Should – should we wake him first?’
John turned away and pinched the bridge of his nose. 'I want to apologize to you both. I honestly don't know exactly what's going on, but his was within my power to prevent.'
‘There you are, there you are,’ Lestrade soothed. He removed his hand from John’s bottom and brushed the back of his fingers against John’s cheek.
Lestrade held his arms and reassured him, ‘Relax, relax. Just give him a moment, John. He’s got to check to see if there are any tears or bruising.’
John’s pleads pulled at Greg’s heart, but he could not allow himself to bond with John. He knew from a lifetime of experience that John was feeling desperate to cement their blooming bond, but Greg could not allow it no matter how perfect John’s scent seemed, not if he wanted to respect John’s free will.
‘I’ve got a fever. I know that. Sherlock says it’s a “heat”, like I’m some kind of dog or something. He showed me a prescription, hormones with my name on them. He says I should have been taking them every day. I’ve never seen them before. I don’t take hormones; I don’t need to! I – I don’t know what he’s on about, but I need to see a doctor. It’s getting worse.’
‘Alright, alright. Everybody calm down. Sherlock, leave him be,’ ordered Lestrade. Sherlock gave Lestrade an untrustworthy look, and Lestrade insisted, ‘Come on now, leave him be. Lestrade held up the yellow plug and began unwrapping it from its sealed container.
The water was too cool, so John stood and took the offered towel. His legs were still weak, but they held.
Any muscle control John was able to muster disappeared as both men gripped him. He growled into Greg’s shoulder and he started to pant. He lost control of his legs and wobbled.
John very much did not like the idea of being with Sherlock. He was boney, he didn’t smell right, he was too tall, his hair was wrong, his voice was wrong. He wanted Greg. Broad shouldered, larger than life, silver-haired Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade. He ached to have Greg between his legs again, and Sherlock kept touching him with that cold, wet cloth,
'Hold him! Hold him!' Greg ordered Sherlock. He let go of John to reach of a nearby hand-towel on the bed. Through the screams, Greg placed the towel between John's teeth. 'John, I know, I know. Bite down. Try and breathe through this. Try and be still. I'm trying to give you what you need.' As John screamed through the gag, Greg continued, 'I'm trying. I'm nearly there. Please try. Try, John, i know you're in pain, but I'm not going to be able to come if you're screaming like this. Please.'
'Ow, ow!' John wailed as the knot grew inside of him. The member bore deeply inside of his anus, completely missing the newly discovered vaginal passage. John ached for it to be breached again and alternatively burned at the stretch of the knot.
John balked at this. ‘Mating! You mean the treatment is to have sex. I’m a doctor. Never have I come across sex as the cure for a bloody fever!’ He stood and paced the living room. He tired quickly and leaned forward on the fireplace.
John did his best to drag his feet against the floor in protest. ‘No, no. I can’t. I need to shower first, please.’
Greg smiled down at him. He used one hand to wipe wet hairs from John's forehead and had stopped thrusting shortly after John began his orgasm. 'I'm glad you enjoyed that,' Greg said and laughed. 'God, you feel amazing. Oh, John!' he praised. He patted John's leg and pulled back. 'I'm going to pull out now,' he warned before leaning further back until his full erection slipped out easily.
Ever the paragon of physical control, Sherlock was trembling violently even as he held John in a fierce grip. His respirations were far too rapid to be effective, and the banging of Sherlock’s heartbeat against John’s back was damned unhealthy.
Lestrade stopped abruptly, and John thought that he had climaxed, so he surprised John when he reached under John’s legs and positioned them onto his shoulders. He pressed back in and folded John in half as he pushed deeper than before, deeper than John thought Lestrade was long. If he wasn’t careful, he might puncture John’s lung. It was the least comfortable of all the positions for John, and the ligaments and muscles in his legs and hips were pushed to their limits.
John’s renewed distress put a definite end to his distance. He rushed to John and knelt at the side of the bed. ‘Hey, hey, John relax! Relax! Breath, John, calm down. Easy now,’ he urged and continued a litany of calming words. He took the other hand that Sherlock was not desperately squeezing and pressed at John’s shoulder. ‘Come on now. Just, you know what? Just take a deep breath. Come on, take a big deep breath in . . . ’
‘The cab’s waiting outside.’ Sherlock made an about-face and used his long legs to bound across the office.
‘Sorry, sorry. It’s going down; I can feel it. I’m going to bite you again, and that should help until then.’ Sherlock pulled John close to his hips and buried his teeth in John’s neck.
John was a medical doctor and a soldier. He didn’t put much credence to quantum mechanics or the supernatural as his mind was not trained to look at the theoretical or unproven. The chill of the water around him helped him to think, and right now he was thinking that maybe he wasn’t in Kansas anymore. Something had happened when he fell on Fielding’s machine.
Sherlock explored him with two fingers before pulling his digits out and wiping the fluids from John with his wet cloth.
Sherlock moved closer to John in his chair. 'John, I've never cared for someone in the way that I care for you.' He reached for John , and John embraced Sherlock in a hug. John wrapped his free arm around Greg and hugged them both fiercely.
John shook his hand out of Sherlock's and dropped his head to the pillow. John had dried to distance himself from his body. He had tried to ignore the sensations of both of his friends touching his anus and genitalia. he had tried to push away the feeling aroused as both men performed anal sex on him. Try as he might, he was too concerned and confused now to not think how this body housed a functioning vagina and hymen. He panted and nodded. 'Do it. Get it over with, Greg.' He turned to Sherlock. 'Don't you dare bite me. Not unless I say so.'
Keening and moaning from the other room stopped Lestrade from rummaging further through Mycroft’s box of party favors. He took the yellow plug and went back to Sherlock’s bedroom.
'I can't say that I know what this will feel like,' said Lestrade, 'but brace yourself. I'll do everything I can to make it fast. Just tell me when you're ready.'
‘Stop it, John! You’re knotted together. You have to wait for the swelling to go down before – No! Hold still, John!’ tried Lestrade again. ‘I know this is uncomfortable, but you need to be still.’ Lestrade gathered John’s wrists again, and he finally stopped thrashing.
He felt for his scar on his left shoulder. The skin was smooth and it did not hurt to push at the tissue. His right shoulder, on the other hand was tight as he reached. His right shoulder contained the purple flecks and scaring similar to scars he’d seen of healed shrapnel wounds after an explosion or grenade. He distinctly remembered the moment he leaned over PFC Patterson to protect him from enemy fire as he put pressure over the oozing, sucking chest wound of the young soldier when the enemy bullet tore through his left shoulder. He knew that Patterson did not make it, but John had no memory of a grenade exploding shrapnel into his right shoulder. He remembered the bullet wound with graphic detail, but now that hallmark scar was gone and replaced by another.
When Sherlock didn’t elaborate further, Lestrade agreed, ‘Yeah. He’s a good man. I’m glad I could help him.’
John panted. Any arousal that Sherlock had encouraged was quickly being replaced by more rational thoughts.  This was his friend, flat mate, the irritating prat who refused to pick up milk or tea. He was putting his dick into John. ‘Greg, Greg, please! I can’t do this!’
Greg stopped Sherlock from continuing. He grabbed his arm to finally pull Sherlock's gaze from John to Greg. 'I need - no, John needs something else right now. John is finally able to care for himself. That means that we've countered a lot of the toxins in his blood stream for now. We've balanced his bonding instinct enough to keep him mentally stable and un-bonded. I don't think, Sherlock, that you realize how vulnerable you've left yourself, which is exactly what John has also been trying to help you avoid.' Greg sighed happily when Sherlock took a sip from the white Scotland Yard mug. Greg was starting to worry that he was sound to Sherlock like a parent lecturing him like the perpetual teenager that he always seemed to act like. 'You've spent a week inhaling John's pheromones. You've finally knotted him twice, and I know you've not experienced that before. You're so focused on him that you've stopped focusing on what your own body is going through.' Greg instantly regretted having this conversation in front of John.
It hurt, so John grabbed Greg’s hand to slow him down. He held the other arm that kept pushing him onto Sherlock.
, his lips fluttering over the sensitive flesh, the more he found that his hips were pressing back into Sherlock’s, and his head turned even more to invite Sherlock’s embrace.
John’s diaphragm worked hard to pump his lungs with the air for which his body was desperate. Nerves screamed from his muscles, up his spinal column and to his brain. The sudden movement of his legs made John feel as though fire were burning through his hips. His fatigued muscles trembled as John tried to keep his legs from flopping to the floor.
Lestrade took John’s exposed neck as an offer and bit and sucked at a sizable piece of flesh above his clavicle.
John registered the change in his vision before the pain made its presence known to his brain. Sherlock had jerked behind him, dark speckles danced in front of John’s eyes, and he realized that something felt very wrong in his backside.  The pressure from Sherlock’s knot entering him was so intense that John was only able to acknowledge that something larger than he could accommodate had been forced passed his sphincter before the spots of darkness enveloped him entirely.
Sherlock’s eyes shined in the dark and focused directly on John Watson. ‘Are you alright? Are you feeling alright, John?’
with how you were feeling. I bring it up because that's how you'd be feeling with your alpha once your biology had processed the unique chemistry of the enzymes I had left inside of you.'  Lestrade stealthily spread John's buttock cheeks and gently pulled at the plug with a light twist of his wrist.
‘Greg!’ John was obviously trying to shout, but his voice didn’t have any strength. He continued to pull himself across the bed toward the door.
John’s stomach fluttered and his head swirled with dizzying arousal. His ass actively sought Sherlock’s crotch.  It found indistinguishable skin, which retreated from him as soon as he pressed against it.
'Ah, better obviously, but um, I don't know. When I woke up, I felt more myself than the past few days. I'm sore. Still pretty exhausted. More than anything I wanted some fried food more than I've craved anything in a long time. Like after a binder but ten fold,' replied the doctor. I wanted proteins and salts. I ordered the take out. I noticed that your brother has been sending supplies, but something about energy snacks turned me off. I needed real food.'
Sherlock grabbed John's hand. 'I'm here. I can bite your through it, so you won't be in that much pain.'
The knot hurt at his ring of too-stretched muscle, and John gasped and squeezed hands and arse reflexively.
Once John regained his composure, and his face had returned from green to red, Lestrade suggested, 'How about a lay down?'
'Sherlock, come here, I need you to know where this is. It's not always easy to find even when it's presenting,' Greg said with a slight grin.
John whimpered, ‘Greg? Wait, don’t go.’ He rolled onto his stomach and attempted to slide off of the bed.
'Hold his legs! Keep his hips still, and I'll bite him,' shouted Lestrade. He struggled to keep hold John into position to prevent either of them getting injured.
John nodded and wrung his hands. ‘What exactly,’ he swallowed and looked up at Sherlock, ‘would you . . ?’ he blinked rapidly. ‘You’d be having sex with me?’ No one made an answer. ‘Not just touching penises kind of sex, is it?’ he asked with a forced laugh. His breath hitched, and he was close to breaking down. He wiped at his face.
Greg did not appear to understand and continued to force John back and down onto an unwavering protuberance. ‘Sherlock, push! Now!’
Lestrade jerked and came a second time, and John twitched at the distinct pulse of heat deep inside of him.
John was looking distant as though he did not believe what Lestrade was explaining was true. ‘You said there were two options.’
Sherlock spun around the room looking at everything and nothing. ‘You’ve been talking to Mycroft. You only call me “Sher” when Mycroft’s been sniffing around.’
Greg shifted on the bed upsetting John’s balance again. He pressed John’s knees slightly apart, and Sherlock filled in the space between John’s legs with his own.
When John had bought the magazine, the feature article across David Beckem’s chest was ‘The new non-treatment for prostate cancer’. Now the article read, ‘The ten best ways to induce your omega’s heat’. Someone had gone to an inordinate effort to change the papers. The news. The television. His friends. Him.
The pain in his legs was second to the unnatural pressure inside of him, which seemed to continue to grow. ‘Ow, ouch, ow, Greg! Ow!’ He writhed to escape the unforgiving pressure inside his body just above his tailbone. ‘Stop it! Please!’
John was silent and carried a look of dejection. Not looking anywhere particular he asked, ‘Lestrade, I’m going to think of you as the neutral party here.’ He blinked, and tears fell down his cheeks. ‘What do you think I should do?’
A box wrapped in brown paper sat on the first step. He read the small white card attached to it aloud, ‘221B Baker St. Best Wishes – M’.
'Not as good as the Thai place, but as hungry as I am, this may be the best meal I've ever had,' noted John to the table.
Lestrade said quietly, ‘You need to stay in there with him. I’ve seen too many omegas try and kill themselves rather than submit in a heat.’
Lestrade took the empty glass from John and set it on the table next to the lamp. He felt John’s forehead with his inner wrist. ‘John, do you think you can stay siting up?’
‘I heard what Lestrade said!’ John shouted. Then he tucked his face into his knees. ‘Really, Sherlock, I’m hurting and I really don’t want to be in the same room with you.’
Lestrade turned his attention toward shouting down the street. Two of Mycroft’s men had a yelling man pressed down onto the street, surely a desperate suitor who’d become overwhelmed by John’s scent.
John felt wet and sticky all over, and he could feel Sherlock’s said (copious) fluids slowly sliding between his ass checks to the pillow. It was damned unnatural to produce so much semen, and he considered it yet more evidence that he was in surrounds that were
John knew what he was taught in medical school about the many discomforts a woman would endure, but all that went out of the figurative window now that he had to experience it.
Sherlock seemed to accept Greg's argument and pulled the sheet back and laid next to John's right side. The queen sized mattress was a tight fit for the three men, but as the two leaned into John's body, the intimacy was quite comfortable. John's breathing lulled both of them into a quiet and relaxed state until the three were asleep.
take care of you, but if you know of someone else you’d like to do this with, you need to tell us right now. You’re very short on time.’
The kitchen light was bright, and Sherlock squinted to see John and Lestrade chattering away over bags and containers of Chinese take out.
Greg understood John’s quest for privacy and independence and ushered Sherlock from the bedroom with promises to John that they’d bring back food and tea.
‘Stop, stop, stop! No, leave it, stop, please, just don’t!’ John protested with an utterly hoarse voice.
‘Your body has made itself ready to take a mate, John,’ Sherlock explained. He paced to the fireplace and stared at the skull on the mantle.
‘ . . . fucking heavy,’ he continued and then much more clearly, ‘Get off, Sherlock! Off!’ With his hands free, John pushed hard at Sherlock’s shoulders as his mind recovered some of its clarity. He pressed at Sherlock’s hips with his feet.
John blushed visibly. He sighed and said, 'You mean when I was with Sherlock?' John recalled the intense wash of orgasm when he was stuck to Sherlock by his engorged, mutant penis.
‘The final decision is up to John, though,’ Lestrade said. They both looked down at John. ‘Any time you want to see a doctor, John, just say so. I’ve got the car. I’ll drive you there myself.’
I notice small errors here and there every time I look at the story, but if anyone has an interest in beta'ing, I'd be grateful for another pair of eyes.
Lestrade tried to sooth John as best he could and his petted at John’s hair. ‘Shh, shh, it’s just pressure. Just try and relax. Easy, easy, easy, now, John. You’re doing great.’
‘What does John need with boiling water?’ Sherlock did not look up from the quietly rumbling kettle but took the offered bottle.
He didn’t want to listen to Sherlock’s bizarre talk of heats and hormone therapy. Then three days ago, he’d stopped having an appetite, had the biggest, most cleansing dump of his life, and then he started to excrete mucus. Gobs of it at first, but as his temperature increased, the mucus turned into a viscous fluid not unlike the fluid his girlfriends produced when he used his fingers to pleasure them.
Greg said gently, 'John let me know when you feel up to, well, when you feel well enough for me to remove your plug. I need to check you for a few things.'
John kept his frown but rolled slowly away from Greg and Sherlock. Lestrade eased John’s top leg forward at the knee before he pressed the tip of the inoffensive phallus into John’s shining, wet anus. He whined minutely but bore against the press of the silicon as Lestrade pushed. A quick ‘ah’ and Greg waited for John to sigh his readiness and pressed again and again, slowly until John was able to take the plug passed the flared base.
‘Shh, just bear it, John. Come on, now the hard part is over. Shh, you’re fine.’ Greg pressed his lips to John’s cheek and the unmarred part of his neck under his chin.
Lestrade was huffing loudly in John’s ear, and it was distracting to the other sensations. He turned his head.
Lestrade handed the slick yellow phallus to Sherlock. Sherlock left with it to presumably wash it in the bathroom without prompting. Lestrade had just enough time to grab a dry towel from the floor and tapped John's hips to indicate that he should lift them again. Whitish, clear liquid slipped from John's hole but landed on the towel. Lestrade spread John's knees gently apart again. 'Now that your body has had time to judge Sherlock and me for out virility.' Lestrade's middle digit pressed at John's hot hole. 'This shouldn't hurt, okay?' Lestrade pushed his finger inside. 'Now you should be presenting your reproductive channel for us.' Lesrade watched Sherlock return and sit on John's right side on the bed.
‘Alright, John. Sherlock and I have discussed this, and you have a choice in your treatment. We can take you somewhere where they can care for you.’
‘The second is perhaps the lesser of the two evils,’ Sherlock said. He was looking intently at the smiling yellow face painted onto the wallpaper with his hands squeezing one another behind his back. ‘A multitude of beta volunteers would take you for days until your heat was over. You’re unlikely to bond with one of them, so once your fever was over, you’d still have control over your life.’
Sherlock finally eased each finger one at a time from John’s hole and untangled himself from John’s leg. He made sure that John was laying with his pelvis elevated on the pillow before inching away from him.
Sherlock blinked with realization and took in a deep breath and turned off the heat as the kettle began to rattle with a rolling boil.
John had not thought much of the papers or the news about omegas and alphas and all. He had assumed that it was part of some marketing campaign for some fad or movie like the ‘Vote Harvey Dent’ stickers all over the Underground when the Batman movie came out a few years back.
Sherlock remained knotted inside John even after a quarter of an hour by the clock in Sherlock’s bedroom. John was the calmest Lestrade had seen him since his heat, bugger that; this was the calmest he’d ever seen the ex-military man.
'Mmm, Sherlock! Please, God!' As John's instincts kicked in, the hands holding up his legs let go. He was left with the fullness between his legs that entered him over and over and punched a swelling white heat of pure pleasure deeper and deeper into him.
Sherlock was breathless as he replied, ‘No, no, he is too tight. He can’t, Greg, please. Don’t, don’t push him.’
At John’s apparent reluctance, Lestrate kneeled on the bed and explained, ‘It will really help to stretch you. You’re too tight for the knot, even Sherlock’s fledgling knot.’
He shouldn’t be able to, but John was so super sensitive that he could feel the jet of fluid being ejected into his bowels.
This time it felt more like a spasm and not a strong ejaculation to John. He could feel Lestrade’s pubic hairs dig into his backside; the inspector was pressed so deeply into him. He could also feel the knot waning as his inner walls felt the decrease in pressure. John panted and clenched at Lestrade’s member instinctively with the change.
John’s scent was intoxicating, and it certainly urged on Sherlock’s arousal as he positioned himself between his legs. Sherlock swallowed and rested his head on John’s collar bone.
‘I don’t trust anyone else, and you have experience with heats. You can help me keep him from bonding. Please, Lestrade, I’ve never asked you for a personal favor before.’ Sherlock gave him a desperate look. There was no mask of ego, not the usual smug self-satisfaction on his face.
‘Sherlock, on his other side now, help me get him to the loo,’ urged Greg. He could tell that John was nervous and becoming more so with Sherlock’s pacing. He surprised Greg by reaching a hand out to Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded at Lestrade’s words, but his arms shook under his weight. He looked down John’s white chest and the valleys of lightly colored hair. Slowly he moved his hand down past Lestrade’s line of vision down to the source of John’s scent. His fingers made slick, wet noises as they explored the place where both men would eventually take John.
I was getting bloody pissed that my favorite stories weren’t being updated or finished. I was blinking funny and refreshing my webpage compulsively until I realized that folks had been going out of their way to remind me to update this fic. I’d rather be reading fic! Let someone else sacrifice computer games and petting the puppy to write porn. I killed the puppy with a stupidly long walk, so here is the fic typed out with letters from BOTH sides of the keyboard.
‘Have you ever mated, Sherlock?’ It was an extremely personal question, and Lestrade would never have asked it except in this very circumstance.
Euphoria penetrated John's body and mind, and he breathed deeply and calmly. He had the sense that his body was floating an inch above the bed. He moaned just to see if he still had control over his body. He felt the moan in his nose and throat, but the sound was still distant from his senses. He closed his eyes to stop the dizziness that his vision was giving him. The blackness of his closed eye lids flashed to deep green, to lime green, to blinding white. His stomach lurched with the vertigo of it all. The bulging knot in his rectum did not help his attempt to ground himself with the change of his blood chemistry.
With his gentle witness-interrogation tone, Lestrade said, ‘John, can I ask you something? I know you’re covered in sweat, but are you wet? Is there a lot of fluid, ah, between your legs?’
The sensitivity of his body quickly returned to arousal and he reached for the form above him and opened his eyes.
John shut his eyes tight. Lestrade’s member was pressing at his backside searching for entrance, and John panted when it found his opening. He was surprisingly receptive to the push at the ring of muscle as Lestrade penetrated him.
The look Sherlock gave him made Lestrade think of himself at the age of nineteen when his girlfriend, and later his wife, told him that she was in heat and needed him. It was a look of pure youth and inexperience.
Sherlock had made a pallet of sheets and pillows on the floor. There was only one reason Sherlock would put out bedding.
'Shh,' said Sherlock close to John's face. He pulled John's forehead into his neck in an embrace. 'John? Will you let me?' Sherlock used one hand to draw a path from John's shoulder to his chest and belly and finally to his inner thigh.
‘Certainly. I think we should let him sleep on a bed, though. His body needs as little extra stress as possible. You too, Sherlock,’ ordered Lestrade.
John resisted their hold and pushed at them. Greg pushed his left hand to brace John's forehead before he secured his mouth in a strong bite at the back of John's neck.
Greg returned to the bed on John's left side and pushed John onto his right side. 'John, I'm here.' He removed the pillow from under John's hips. 'I don't think that either of us could comfortably knot in that position now, okay? I'm here, I'm here. On your side now. Sherlock, turn him now. Higher on the bed.'
‘Our encounter with Fielding seems to be the origin of John’s behavior. The machine was destroyed, so I have no way of studying it. Perhaps it did work, and this is a John from a parallel universe.’
‘John, you must let us help you,’ urged Greg. He frowned as he watched John, flushed and shaking, tried to push himself up off of the floor. ‘You must understand,’ he put his hand on John’s shoulder, ‘your body is focusing all of its resources on your heat. Your muscles are too weak. John, you cannot walk on your own.’
Greg pushed John back and away until he lost his balance and was forced to lean into Sherlock’s chest to remain upright.
It was enough of a shock to convince Sherlock to do as Lestrade told him. He grabbed John hard and bit at his neck. His hips started again as John moaned and swat weakly at Sherlock’s big head.
‘Shut it, and help me move the furniture out of the way.’ Chairs and books were pushed haphazardly to the walls. Lestrade kicked off his shoes as to not step harshly on John accidently. ‘Alright, we need to get him undressed.’ Carefully Lestrade pulled John’s damp t-shirt up and over his head.
He sniffed at a lingering wetness in his nose and reached for the bar of soap; Sherlock’s favored brand. He clutched it to his chest and fought back the tide of emotion.
John waved Greg's response away. 'No, of course. The bed will be fine. Uh, I just need to get my head on a pillow.'
Finally hands surrounded his shoulders, dipped down over his chest and down.  The tickle of an inhaling nose and slightly stubbled chin made John turn his head away. His neck exposed, Sherlock pressed his face into the curve of white skin.
John nodded and wiped at his eyes, 'Sherlock, please tell me what you're thinking.' Something about John's vulnerable tone finally engaged a response from Sherlock.
Sherlock stared at John for a moment longer before turning. He paused and said, ‘You are the closest friend I’ve ever had. I don’t like seeing you suffer. You may not wish to continue our relationship after this, but at least I’ll know that you are safe.’ He left the bathroom door open when he left.
Greg was saying something, but John really didn’t give a shit. He was focusing on Sherlock’s heart beating against his spine. As Sherlock exhaled, John breathed it into his mouth and tried to taste hours old scent of the cup of black tea that was the last thing Sherlock had to drink or eat.
‘I – I can’t. I need this out.’ John rolled and lay on his side. He reached back for the silicone at his backside.
‘John, I really recommend that you leave it in for as long as you can. The heat will take you sooner if you – ’
Tall and dramatic as ever with his coat collar and scarf pulled tight around his neck, self-titled consultant detective Sherlock Holmes glared at Lestrade. ‘I need you need to answer my questions directly and quickly. You’re a beta correct? And your wife is an omega?’
Sherlock moaned again. After this third orgasm, his member began to loosen its hold inside John’s body. He also reached to touch John’s cheek. ‘John, are you alright? I know that it hurt.’
Lestrade spread his fingers before squeezing the flesh of John’s backside. He pushed and pulled, and John continued to squeeze at Sherlock’s knot instinctively.
Past exhaustion, John fell onto his back and panted. His voice cracked as he said, ‘I could’ve told you that. Just leave it.’
John shuddered. ‘Oh, fuck!’ He panted. Their hands on his arms were like buzzing, live wires. He could feel both of their heart beats through their palms. His heart by comparison was beating insanely fast. He could smell them both.
John squeezed it and used the long, violinist fingers to anchor himself to Sherlock’s room surrounding him. Sherlock’s bed beneath him. Sherlock’s hand squeezing back at his. Sherlock’s breath heavy at the back of his head. Sherlock’s sweaty body pressed so hard against his back. Sherlock’s penis mutated into a form that swelled at the base and locked inside his body.
In this world, John's friends were offering the most generous, self-sacrificing care that they could offer. Greg was saying that Sherlock was risking the same bond that this universe's John had avoided his entire life. He was risking his future happiness for John. He'd already admitted to himself that he'd enjoyed parts of their 'assistance,' but was that his mind trying to justify their assault?
Sherlock growled a warning at Lestrade’s dangerous proximity, and the deep sound reverberated down John’s spine.
Alone with John in such an intimate position Lestrade made his attempt at small talk. ‘When you took your bath . . .’
Lestrade smelled like faded aftershave and a long day in an office building. Printer toner, pencil shavings and a nostalgic trace of gun oil.
‘He needs water. I’ll be back,’ Greg said and stood from the bed as well. He disappeared out of the room, and John was left naked and alone on the bed.
‘He’s right, John. If you keep his release inside, you’re symptoms won’t be near so strong. Here, now this will help with the pain of the knots and keep the fluids where they need to be.’ Lestrade held the plug for John’s viewing.
Inspector Lestrade closed a manila file and pushed his chair under his desk. He cleared his throat and scanned the office.
‘Fine, but you should know that he’ll be more likely to bond with one of us. The more people, the less likely that will happen. It would be safer with one more person. Maybe your brother could – ’
John pressed his naked body into the warmth and perfect scent and discovered that Greg was also wearing boxers. He whimpered and pushed the fabric every which way.
John's body was relaxed enough that his sphincter put up little resistance as the widest part of the plug exited easily. John still winced at the feeling of the warm silicon passing out of him. It had started to feel like an extension of his body and he missed it like he missed his watch on his wrist after a shower.
'And that's that,' started Greg, but he sighed. 'I'm so sorry that your first time is so ... overwhelming.' Greg wiped his fingers on the towel under John's hips.
‘Right,’ agreed John. ‘We were on a cab home, and there was an advert in the cab. It was an alpha-omega dating service. Ever since then, everyone has been on about alphas, omegas, and heats. Sherlock’s gone mad. He kept asking who my alpha is; who my bond-mate is. I broke up with my girlfriend last month. I don’t know what he means.’
John pressed the heel of his hand to his eyes and wiped away tears before they could fall. He did not answer Lestrade’s question.
Once inside, Sherlock proceeded to barricade them behind another set of padlocks. The air inside was stale and thick with John’s scent. ‘Christ, how long has he been in heat?’
Sherlock avoided Lestrade’s gaze. ‘That is why I asked you here. I never expected to mate with an omega. I’m a beta, so the contingency plan never crossed my mind. It would have been superfluous. Lestrade, I need you to help me with this. To help John.’
Blessedly John was able to keep down two cups of fortified tea with his usual cream and double sugars as well as three-quarters of a chocolate protein drink from Mycroft's supplies. He remained calm in Sherlock's bed until closing his eyes. His breathing settled until he was obviously deeply asleep.
He watched as Sherlock leaned down and poked his head between his legs. ‘God, give it a rest! Please don’t,’ he pleaded, but Sherlock did not touch him again. He simply kept his head down between his legs.
John winced and sighed. He made a mental note not to finger anymore girlfriends so gently and creepily with cold lube.
John growled, Lestrade growled, and Sherlock howled at the obscenity. He placed his hand over his mouth and held John’s other shoulder in his effort to comfort him.
‘Right. I’ll follow your lead. Whatever you say, as long as it is what is best for John,’ Sherlock agreed.
Lestrade released his hold on John’s arms. ‘Sherlock?’ asked Lestrade as if he knew there was more Sherlock was not saying.
That was exactly what Sherlock appeared to do. His breathing became rapid and he paced around the bed.
John, protested, ‘No! . . . can walk . . . and,’ he swallowed, ‘. . . no.’ He pushed himself off of the floor with his arms and attempted to roll onto his stomach.
Suddenly self-conscious at the intense, studying gaze of his flat-mate, Watson pulled a sheet over his hips in an attempt to hide his genitals. ‘Be nice to get clean.’
In the time that it took John to sit on the toilet until he came to the realization that he wasn't going to do more than urinate, Mycroft had delivered another package. Sherlock tore through it frantically and remade John a proper cup of tea. He and Greg positioned John back into the bed and replaced the plug. John had lost a signification amount of ejaculate when he had sat on the toilet, but the plug was still necessary to help John to keep his anus properly stretched for the next time he would be knotted.
Lestrade wiped sweat from his brow with his wrist and nodded. ‘Good. That’s excellent. We’re getting somewhere then.’
‘I’m not making tea at a time like this,’ grumbled Sherlock and he wretched his elbow from Greg’s grasp. ‘He needs one of us in there; you said so yourself. He shouldn’t be alone.’
The very warm body lying next to John was a great comfort, but Lestrade was wearing a shirt, and the material grated on John’s skin. He pushed up at the front of the shirt.
After the initial sharp pain of Sherlock pulling out of him, John felt immediate throbbing at the abused ring of flesh. His muscles spasmed at the sensation of emptiness after being thoroughly stretched. His arms, legs and stomach ached from unreleased lactic acid. His mind, on the other hand, could not get passed his confusion. The two men he trusted the most in the world had just raped him.  ‘Please let go now, Lestrade.’ He tested at Lestrade’s hold on his hands.
Sherlock stiffened and looked away making it obvious that he did not want John to pick that as his option.
Lestrade could hear Mycroft’s smile over the phone, and they ended the call. He set the coffee table back on its legs and retrieved his pants. Next to his shirt he spotted a string of keys spilling out of Sherlock’s coat. Apparently Sherlock kept them in a secret compartment inside the lining, and Greg retrieved them before he peaked in on John and Sherlock.
John stopped screaming and started to growl. Grasping and squeezing his friends' hands he writhed as much as he could in their hold. The pain was too intense for him. and not only did his skin burn and ache, but his bones and joints felt like a thousand needles were jabbing through him. Both Sherlock and Greg had strong, sharp bites tearing deeply into his neck muscles, and any promised pain-relief they had said that this would offer was only to serve as a distraction to the searing pain in his rectum. The intense growing pressure tested the limits of his innards to the point that he was sure that he was torn if not about to tear. The base of the knot pressed against his internal vaginal opening and left John in a state of near pleasure through all of the pain.
‘Stop! Please?’ Sherlock’s voice shuddered. ‘God, it’s too late. I’ve already started to knot. I can’t, Greg, don’t!’
John's face broke as he began to cry, and Greg squeezed his shoulder to comfort the poor man. 'You're condition is very serious, and I'm glad we're both here to minimize the ah, hard parts.'
John whined. He swallowed before he could choke on his saliva. 'What are you...?' John couldn't finish his sentence.
There was a lot of moaning, and John didn’t realize that it was him until Lestrade shushed him, and he heard Sherlock say, ‘John, let go, you’re going to hurt him.’
Dry hands pulled awkwardly at John’s member. He gasped and continued to try and push away the arms holding him into place. He was nearly falling onto Sherlock, and Greg kept pushing.
Sherlock’s hands continued down John’s abdomen to his belly and hips. The right hand snaked further and grasped his inner thigh.
Frustrated at the arousal he was experiencing at a cock that was not Greg’s, John moaned, ‘Fuck me.’ Once he said it, John instantly heard it as the invitation that Sherlock must have interpreted it as.
Sherlock reposition himself above John and propped himself up on his elbows. ‘John, I think I can move now, but you need to stay still. Just let me pull out.’
Lestrade moved to give Sherlock space between John's legs. 'Alright, take your longest finger and run it inside along my finger.
Greg raised his eyebrows. So the pair of them had already discussed the prospect of becoming more to each other than friends? This was a surprise to Greg. In the way that they bickered and risked their lives for each other, Greg had thought that a bond was inevitable. Perhaps it would take several years before they got over themselves, but it still seemed inevitable. They were a duo. Dr. Watson and Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes. What had transpired between them for them to agree not to pursue more than a friendly partnership?
It was driving Lestrade to irritation and he loudly declared to John, ‘Okay, on your back. You shouldn’t need to be taken again so soon. It’ll keep you prepped for the next time.’
Greg finally lifted his head off of John’s neck, which sent another shock of pain though John’s senses as the flesh between Lestrade’s teeth was released.
Last night was a bit of a mystery for John. He recalled Sherlock attempting to calm him through the pain of his expanding knot as they lay on their sides. 'I must have been asleep. I admit that I've had a lot of, um, erotic dreams.'
Sherlock moved his face to John's neck and said through his own emotional break down, 'I don't know how I would handle waiting for you in the waiting room at Bart's. I know that I'd hate you're new alpha,' he joked.
John waved Sherlock's hand away. 'I don't have a fever. I'm fine. Now, I'm starved. Greg where are the forks? Please?' he added as he nearly forgot the politeness of an Englishman. 'Sherlock sit down. You can have this bowl of egg drop.'
Greg grabbed the tea towel from the counter next to the sink and ran it under cold water. 'Here,' he said and held the cool, wet cloth to John's forehead. 'You've eaten too much too fast. Tell me if you might throw up. Sherlock, grab the waste basket. I'm sorry, John, it's my fault. Chinese was probably a bad idea.'
John was laying supine, as much as he could with Sherlock between his legs, and was digging his head and face into the sheets and moaning, ‘Let it be. It hurts!’
As Sherlock continued his shower, Lestrade tided the room as best he could. He took what linens he could and tossed them down the stairs. With a text message Mrs. Hudson would keep fresh bedding ready. He cracked the window in Sherlock's room with the hopes that fresh, cool air would do them all better. This was the first time that Greg realized the time. The sun was low in the sky. He checked his watch to confirm that it was after 3 pm. This allowed him to acknowledge how tired he'd felt. He yawned and stretched. He grabbed the previously discarded down comforter and laid himself next to John's left side.
Greg swallowed and continued, 'What I am saying is that you're in a good place now. What Sherlock needs to do is distance himself from you. Your drive, John, is extremely powerful for an omega. This is not the usual. I suspect that you've been on replacement hormones and suppressants for many years. That's been known to ramp up the eventual condition that you're going through now. As long as I've been on the force, I've only seen his a handful of times.'
Greg was genuinely surprised that Sherlock was able to speak so eloquently everything considering. Greg had been fairly certain that Sherlock had fallen into the well-known type of psychosis that alphas during ruts experienced. The common symptoms were already obvious in Sherlock's behavior. There was the quiet but obsessive focus on John's sleeping form, and Sherlock's inability to voluntarily leave leave John's side. Then there was the near complete inability to eat or drink, or even verbalize answers to Greg's prodding requests.
There was a rustling sound from above, and then John made his appearance at the top of the stairs. ‘Sherlock, you’re back! Oh, Lestrade, thank God! Lestrade, you have to help!’ John leaned heavily on the wall and rail. ‘Sherlock’s gone mad!’
As Sherlock removed his hand, John furrowed his brow and rested his head back onto the pillow. 'No,' he groaned. 'You did go too deep. You can't put ... you can't ... that's as far as I can take it,' said John as he stumbled on his words to explain how he felt when Sherlock had hit a final wall in his channel.
'This is the very best time for you to wash up. It'll be good for your sore muscles. It'll give you a clearer head. Come on now, Sherlock. Please get in the shower,' urged Greg.
‘Right. He mentioned that he preferred not to commit to a relationship. I assumed he was taking hormone treatments.’
He tore off the paper and removed the lid from the box. Inside was another paper card that read ‘I thought I’d provide one of each to help him work his way up, as it were.’ Beneath the card was another wrapped package. Lestrade opened it and found that it contained several plugs and knotting dildos of various lengths, widths, and colors. He instantly picked the small, yellow plug that looked the least intimidating for John. There was a small, unassuming gel dildo with a snow-flake symbol on the package, and he made a note to freeze it for later use.
Greg’s pushing did little but upset John’s balance again. He could feel that Sherlock was regaining some rigidity, but he was in as far as their bodies would allow.
Greg returned to the table with wet spoons and knives. He noticed that John's hands had a slight tremor as he used his chop sticks to shovel a nugget of orange chicken to his mouth.
Lestrade reached out and felt John’s skin on his arm and cheek. ‘What is Sherlock saying that isn’t making sense?’ He crouched to level his face with John’s.
Sherlock turned sharply and looked down at John. ‘But you’d have your life back. If you bond now, even out of desperation, you’d be linked to that person forever.’
Finally he sat up and looked to Lestrade above John’s head. ‘I,’ he sighed, ‘I don’t think it’s right. He still smells the same. I don’t think that he’s been receptive to me.’
As Lestrade made three cups of strong brew sans milk and sugar, he told Sherlock, ‘You’ve got very good alpha instincts. You’re attentive and protective. All apt traits, but John needs us to keep our distance. You’ve got to remember that we aren’t trying to get him to make a permanent bond. He’s going to be fairly clear between cycles. You on the other hand seem distracted. Are you with me, Sher?’
‘John, listen, listen.’ Lestrade held him around his shoulders. ‘Just listen now. Your temperature is up again. We need to help you - ’
Sherlock was back quickly and went to his knees next to John again. ‘Here, Lestrade. There is plenty, and I’ll run out and get more if we need it. Probably best if you use a lot.’
‘Bloody move already. He’s not going to burst into spontaneous combustion if you aren’t in the room. Go, Sherlock. And bring a couple of wet and dry towels while you’re at it,’ Greg continued.
All said and done, the bits where his friends held him down and shoved their mutant penises into his anus might in fact have been worth what John was feeling right now. Like morphine and cocaine and leaving the pub at closing time with a beautiful, intelligent woman with her arms wrapped around him.
‘You have to act as though you’re his alpha. You have to take him. He’s your omega now. Bite him, mark him. Let him know that he’s yours, Sherlock. It’s just like in the movies.’ Lestrade allowed one of John’s arms to slip free.
John panted. There was almost an instant improvement in his color and temperature. He slumped in Sherlock’s grasp, and the tension in his arm relaxed against Lestrade’s pressure. ‘ . . . bloody hurts . . . ’ John moaned among a few other grumbles that neither Lestrade nor Sherlock could make out.
Tears mingled with the sheen of sweat on John's face, and Sherlock did what he could to wipe the moisture from his flushed face.
Lestrade reached for one of John’s men’s health magazines next to the toilet. ‘Yeah. Not how I thought I’d spend my weekend either.’
Beside that package was a cooler with fruit, fortified energy drinks and calorie replacement shakes. He opened a shake and drank it immediately; he hadn’t realized how starved he felt until the cool liquid lined his stomach.
Sherlock started a light, rhythmic pressure, and John instinctively squeezed his sphincter and second channel around the digit. Sherlock attempted to sooth John by rubbing his free hand up and down John's lower leg.
He whispered so low in John’s ear that John was sure that Lestrade couldn’t hear. ‘John, I’m so sorry for this.’
‘Ow, John, no, no, don’t. Don’t squeeze. Be still, relax. Relax, now. Oh, John, easy. I know it hurts, but you have to relax. Ease up now.’ Lestrade panted.
John was still taut and tense on the blankets with no sense of how long his ordeal had lasted. He felt alone and exposed. He held back a cry.
Sherlock hadn’t washed and he still smelled like sex and sweat under his fresh clothes. Dust and formaldehyde and Mrs. Hudson’s fabric softener.
John frowned at the squeeze of pain Sherlock’s teeth caused, but his hips drew back towards Sherlock seemingly of their own volition. He squeezed both Sherlock’s and Lestrade’s hands. He moaned and realized that Lestrade was saying something again.
The soft noises of John eating had stopped. Greg turned and saw that the man was a shade paler. he also noticed that John had tried to hide the tremor in his hands by putting them under the table.
Greg pushed his face against John’s check and whispered, ‘Come on now, John, you can do this. You can do this. Relax.’ He swept both hands to press firmly at John’s hips. ‘Open your hips for him and relax.’
‘Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah, but I’ll have to get to it later. I’ve definitely got to take off for Monday and Tuesday. Alright, just leave it on my voicemail. Yeah, bye,’ Lestrade finished his phone call as he replaced Sherlock in the bathroom. He took his sentry post next to John by sitting on the loo. He sighed as he watched John. ‘You probably don’t want to hear anything from me, but you have been very brave. It is not often that people go into heat so unprepared.’
It wasn’t like Sherlock to reference religious words, John thought. He involuntarily squeezed hard around Sherlock’s member.  He felt rather than heard Sherlock wince and hold his breath at John’s pressure.
‘Just try and breathe, John,’ Sherlock advised. ‘Come now, you’ve had worse in the army. Greg, bite him. Do something. It’s too much for him.’
Greg took John’s clawing hands into his own and squeezed them back.  He gave a slight smile that utterly confused John.
This wasn’t his world. Not his bathroom. Not his magazine. Not his Sherlock’s bar of soap. Since when did Sherlock’s penis, anyone’s penis for that matter, form a knot. Maybe it was because it was not his Sherlock.
‘My room,’ John added. He couldn’t believe that he’d just volunteered that, but there you have it. He said it. He might as well have begged for Lestrade’s cock.
As long as there was a little movement from Greg pushing or pulling away, John's anus only panged with a dull but tolerable ache. He might have imagined the sensation of fluid flowing into his channel before, but this time he <i>definitely</i> felt an unsettling cramp as if liquid was pouring deep into his rectum. Involuntarily he clenched deep internal muscles around Greg's member.
John pressed his skin into Lestrade’s warm flesh. Once he’d heard Sherlock’s voice, he realized that he and Greg were not alone in the bed. He turned and kept his back flushed to Lestrade, which availed him to look at who was on the other side of the bed.
It would have felt comforting if it were under different circumstances. Lestrade was broad and heavy. As a smaller man, John had tried to date women who were his size or smaller, and he was usually on top. It was a different feeling all together to be under a man nearly twice his size. He felt secure and claustrophobic at once. He winced at the feeling of Lestrade’s erection at his inner thighs.
Noticing this, Lestrade pulled out a chair and used his physical prowess to intimidate Sherlock to sit next to John. Greg realized that Sherlock was far enough gone that he only listened to physical commands if not verbal ones, even if they had come from John.
John went rigid and cried. The strong hands holding him in place burned on his skin. The bite only added to the pain and didn't seem to alleviate the stretching of his rectum. He cried and yelled, 'I'm splitting open, God! It's too much, I'm tearing!'
John perked up to listen to the conversation. They were both mad, but maybe they were finally willing to let him go.
Sherlock noticed John's fast rate of breathing and slid John's right hand into his. His fear for John's comfort eased when John squeezed his hand.
Lestrade reached for him and felt his forehead. ‘Come on. Dry off and come with me.’ Lestrade ushered him back into the living room.
‘No. He was wrong. All his machine was doing was killing people,’ corrected Sherlock. ‘They slowly died from radiation poisoning, and he quickly ran out of volunteers. We were investigating the mysterious illnesses and deaths when we encountered him and his machine. And it wasn’t a time machine; it was a dimension jumping machine.’
Greg wrapped his left hand around John's waist and pulled himself closer to John's body. 'Just breathe, John, Breathe.' Greg sounded out of breath himself. 'God, I'm sorry. John pulled at John's hip to minutely press deeper over and over in the shortest possible thrust allowed by his overly swollen knot inside of John.
John sighed and took a smaller bite from his wonton than the last bite. He slowed his chewing and looked down at his box of Chinese food with sadness. Food was his first pleasure in the whole week of being tortured by his alien biology. 'Sherlock, eat your soup.' He handed the Styrofoam container to Sherlock and made a glare for Sherlock to open it and begin to eat. 'Get what you can in. I'm counting on you, remember?' John asked humbly.
What John could process of what Greg was saying, he considered the request but screamed around the towel again in earnest. He was however thankful to have something to bite down on, but he had to slow his breathing as he now had to inhale through only his nose. He cried into the towel and squeezed Sherlock's hand and shoulder.
Sherlock answered, ‘You will be taken immediately by any alpha who can keep you for more than two minutes. Even if you were a hundred miles from anyone, you would eventually weaken so severally that you would slip into unconsciousness.’
‘Are you all the way in? Shit! Shit! John, get on him, now!’ ordered Greg. He pushed at John’s hips.
'Sherlock, can you shake down the sheets and pillows for us?' asked Greg. Noticing Sherlock's possessive posture above John, Greg pushed, 'Sherlock, it'll do you good to be away from John's side for a minute. Get the room all set for us, will you?'
‘I know how anal plugs work,’ John said, thoroughly irritated. He eased onto his back and tried to stretch out on the bed. The bed linens were in various stages of wet, wrinkled, and sticky. He wanted nothing more than to pass out into a deep sleep, but the soiled bedding was distracting and uncomfortable. ‘’m so tired.’ His eye lids felt like they were weighted down with lead, but he writhed to the far side of the bed in an attempt to find a dry spot. His own musky scent mixed with Sherlock’s in the sheets was overpowering.
Greg opened the door for Sherlock whose hands were otherwise full. John was sitting up in the fresh bed with a clean sheet pulled up to his belly and a wide towel under his bum. He was keeping his weight off his bottom by leaning back on the head of the bed
‘Correct on all counts, but for some reason he has not taken any of his medication for four weeks. When I saw the signs, I confronted him.’
John’s backside was incredibly slick, and Sherlock slide into him unimpeded. John furiously grasped at Greg’s chest.
John shuddered but he forced himself to remain still as not to be rebuffed by Sherlock’s spidery hands.  He tried to keep his eyes focused on Greg, but every time Sherlock inhaled and licked at his flesh, his eyelids fluttered closed and his pelvis swirled with a stronger arousal than he thought humanly possible. The wetness between his checks actively spread. He ached. He bloody
After realizing that he was still utterly nude, Holmes finally found his lounging pants and put them on. Then Lestrade and Holmes quickly fitted the bed with clean linens, and John insisted that he was capable of cleaning himself with a moist towel.
John was first aware of his struggle to draw a deep breath with his diaphragm pushing deeply into his gut. This also made him aware of the pressure at his lower gut.
A very short time later, Lestrade pulled in front of 221 Baker Street. He noticed several large men in suits loitering on the sidewalks. An odd occurrence in this neighborhood, he thought, and then remembered that Mycroft Holmes was providing security. The moment the car door opened, and they both stepped out, Lestrade was hit with the overwhelming scent of an omega deep in the throes of an unsatisfied heat. Even as a beta, Lestrade felt an instant and heady arousal. He was suddenly very concerned that there were not enough of Mycroft’s men to protect John.
‘They are both doing better each time. Bit of a hiccup earlier, but Sherlock is doing splendid right now. I need supplies.’ Greg searched the wreck of the living room for his trousers if not his underwear.
‘Are you at least feeling better? Are you okay with Sherlock and I helping?’ Lestrade circled the bed and pulled each sheet corner from the mattress in anticipation of Sherlock’s return with fresh linens.
'Oh, John!' Greg beamed. 'You're doing so great. You feel where my finger is inside of you?' He briefly curled the first knuckle inside of John. At John's wincing nod, Lesrade explained, 'You're really tight. We're going to have to work you open, but that's your channel. That's where you need to knot to help you break the cycles of your heat. The pheromones coming from here are what helps a beta to "pop his knot."' He continued to stroke over and shallowly into the hole that John never would have known existed inside of himself.
Sherlock’s deep inhale pulled at the tiny hairs of John’s neck.  He shuddered and nearly collapsed into Sherlock.
Conversely Sherlock paced and fretted. Lestrade had never felt more the irritated nurse maid than following after Sherlock's wondering and trying to maintain his personal care. Sherlock left his tea to cool until it was unpalatable. He practically had to remind Sherlock to chew and swallow his meal bar. Sherlock's attention was obviously focused on John, despite John's final state of relaxed sleep.
‘There is plenty for all of us, and you need it just as much as he does.’ Greg watched as Sherlock stared at the drink without any intention of consuming it. ‘Go on, for John. Drink up.’
John was sitting up and appeared to move forward under his own strength. ‘Sherlock, I never thought I’d have to ask you to help me make it to the toilet.’
John panted and seemed to give up the fight. Sherlock stiffened above him again and grunted. John raised his eyebrows as he realized that Sherlock had just ejaculated for a second time. ‘Oh God, that just happened. Lestrade!’ he hollered loud enough to be heard in the next room.
'When you woke in the middle of the night, you were very interested in removing my briefs,' reminded Lestrade.
Lestrade had made it his top priority to not see Sherlock’s penis through this whole ordeal, but he was clutching himself and that drew Lestrade’s attention.
Any self-restraint John previously possessed was now forgotten. He whined with each thrust and leveraged with his legs to meet Greg. John bit his lip and squeezed his hands at Sherlock and Greg. Greg was hitting every bundle of pleasure nerves, and it was stripping John of every sense but the raw intensity of the ecstasy. Moaning, his had fell back and his lips parted. He wanted to bury his face in someone's neck and press their skin against his lips and nose. He wanted to kiss and suck and pinch flesh between his teeth. 'Go, ah, ah, faster, please.'
Sherlock shook his head. ‘No, no. I can’t risk him. I won’t. This isn’t working, and we’re going to end up getting him killed. We need to get him to hospital.’
He was left with no medical reference for his symptoms and a friend who insisted he tell him who his alpha was. The irony was that he could be the first known man to traverse dimensions only to jump into the body of a biologically sexual submissive version of Dr. John Watson.
John cleared his throat and nodded his head, a tale-tell betrayal of his nervous discomfort. 'No, ah. No, I'm a doctor and your friend. I appreciate your candor.' He licked his lips and pushed his orange chicken box away from him. 'So Sherlock is going through some, ah, biological responses as a result of my condition?'
Greg continued, ‘You’ve begun to bond with me. That’s supposed to happen. That’s what we want, but you have to help us start that process with Sherlock too. We are trying to help you keep from bonding to an individual. That means you have to start that connection with Sherlock too. When your heat breaks, you won’t be imprinted to either of us if you can just help us.’
John cringed. 'Uh, I'm sorry. Can I go to the couch? The room, it - well, like you said, my sense of smell. It's just that it reminds me too much of ... things.'
‘Stop, stop! John, just stay there.’ Finally Sherlock was forced to push John at his shoulder. ‘Greg?!’ he shouted.
Greg swallowed down a bite of egg roll to respond. 'Your senses, including taste, are going to be heightened.' Again Greg admonished that, as a physician, John should have known common symptoms of an omega in heat. 'Listen, John, I know that you're feeling better and you have your appetite back, but it is best when possible to, um, attend to you before you begin feeling desperate and feverish.' Lestrade had a double motive in discussing his condition in this forward manner.  Of course it would be best to have a willing Dr. Watson in this delicate condition. It would be be physically, mentally, and emotionally beneficial to not tax the poor fellow any further than he had been. His improved condition, talking, walking, and feeding himself was a welcome surprising turn, but it would be wise to be cautious with a man so far into an uncontrolled heat. Greg's new, more pressing concern was to sway what ever was happening in his favorite savant, consulting detective's mind and body. If Greg had control of anything in the addled hormonal states of his friends, it was to mate with John willingly and in full view of the fledgling Sherlock's bond status. Greg was interrupted from his thoughts when Sherlock asked John how he was feeling.
Seeing Sherlock without clothes was not something he’d really taken into consideration. Too late for thoughts of modesty, Lestrade swallowed and took a position at John’s head.
God, Sherlock was so hard inside of him. All of the blood vessels inside of John’s pelvis seemed to swell. He was quickly losing any sensations of pain as adrenaline and endorphins coursed through his frantic nervous system. He grew a sympathetic erection; rather he convinced himself that his hardening penis was due to the stimulation rather than bloody arousal. He moaned. His heart beat pounded into every inch of his fevered flesh, and Sherlock thrust with the pacing of the second hand on the wall of Sherlock’s bedroom. ‘Please’
‘In this case, that is the only treatment. Sherlock has you locked up because if he were to let you out onto the street, any and every alpha would fight for you and take you. I’ve seen what happens when an omega is taken in a mating frenzy like that. They usually end up traumatized with perforated organs, or dead if they are lucky.’
Sherlock went back into the bathroom and saw John behind the clear curtain sitting in the tub with his hands wrapped around his legs. He reached in and turned off the flow of water.
No longer gently exploring with his hand, Sherlock gathered one of John’s thighs to his hip and held him firmly.
Lestrade was not slow. He held John with one hand at the hip and the other holding John’s knee high up on his ribs. He kept his thrusts deep and short, and it hurt each bloody time!
John was not just squeezing Sherlock’s hand. He couldn’t help the reflex to clench around Lestrade’s painfully thick knot. Lestrade’s member twitched, and John clenched again but he tried to remain conscious of it and relax. He endured what he could but he cried out. His eyes watered. One leg thrashed.
John ignored Greg’s stupid attempts to talk him down. ‘Stop! I want to stop! Please, please, please. Bollox!’ He burned everywhere.
‘No, John needs you,’ objected Lestrade. ‘If he’s been receptive to me, he’ll need you next. If I’m with him consecutively, he’s more likely to bond with me. John is going to need you in a few hours, and it’s critical that I’m not the only scent he smells while he sleeps.’
Swiftly John was pulled up into Lestrade’s arms as he held him. John knew he was small, but this was undignified. He tried to protest and push against Lestrade, but he ended up just holding his neck. He heard the water splashing as Sherlock filled the bathtub.
He felt Sherlock grip is hand, which John had clawing into Lestrade’s bicep. Once he realized how hard he was squeezing, he let Sherlock take his hand. The skin at Lestrade’s arm was red and formed the perfect impression of John’s fingers.
It was a good thing Lestrade did not have anything planned for the next week. He could take a few personal days that he had coming to help John Watson through his difficult time.
The water was becoming intolerably cool, but the thought of the queen again went to John’s head. And his penis. His breathing picked up, and he felt his pores open to put out a sweat.
'You'll be a room away. I know. I've got Greg here. And you've heard him. It's good for you to spend some some time apart.' As John said that, he came to the realization that it would be Greg 'assisting' him next. John's anus squeezed around the plug at his rectum and a wave of nausea over came him again. He noted that it would be a very long time before he ordered Chinese take-out. As sweat washed over him, he worried that it was already 'the time.' 'Sherlock, please? I want to lay down.'
