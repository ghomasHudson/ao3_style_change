"Sir, I hate to interrupt," Jarvis said, interrupting all the same. "There's an urgent call from Mr Hogan."
"Sir, I scanned the young lady as she entered the building. Firstly, she is fully human and not a Life Model Decoy. She is wearing no more than minimal make up and she shows no micro scarring from surgery."
"Naturally not," Tony told him, punching Bruce rather too hard on the shoulder. "Stop molesting Steve."
His head hit a cushion that wasn't as hard as it looked. In fact, his head sank into comfort. The blankets looked rough but were as soft as angora. He'd just... rest... for a... little while...
An arm caught him around the waist, steadying and lifting him through the air. A deep voice asked, "Man of Iron, you are well?"
"Jan's found the parachutes' location," Danvers' voice said in his ear. "But I'll have to take us down into a little more atmosphere. We'll have to depressurise if you're gonna open a hatch."
"Should have made the cod-piece bigger," Steve said, grinning, as his heartbeat picked up again. He felt vaguely light-headed from relief.
Tony strode into the conference room, ignoring residual pain and an incipient headache and made his way to the head of the table – or what passed for the head of an oval table.
"The Air Force Office of Special Intelligence," Jarvis's voice said. "Colonel Danvers may know a lot more than we do about that."
Steve chuckled. "So you replaced it in red." Encouraged by these confidences, he said, "You've mentioned an 'Obie' before. I presume that was Obadiah Stane. He was your father's partner, wasn't he? Died in an air crash around the time you were creating Iron Man?"
Tony recognised, within that blaze of light, a terrifyingly familiar shape. His eyes sought his father's and saw a similar recognition.
"Let's hope so," Steve said repressively. "Meanwhile what did you find so funny about asking Fury to produce my... Captain America's DNA?"
Steve smiled reassuringly. "Though you may have to get your hotshot lawyers to stop Fury thinking he owns me," he admitted. "Things between us are a little tense right now. I still haven't forgiven him for Phase Two. Or for that prison built for the Hulk. Or for the information he gave me about you."
As a child, Steve had found sleeping difficult, lying awake on his narrow bed, forcing himself to breathe, afraid that if he didn't concentrate on the movement of his chest, his lungs might give up the fight and he might never wake up again.
"Fuck it, no!" He took a deep breath. "But you did know that the previous will left the whole of the company and its voting shares to you, and that left you – and the Avengers – vulnerable. Did you tell Fury that?"
"Like hell you weren't! I realise you don't like it here, but if you're that keen to escape from the twenty-first century I'll give you a damn gun – at least it'll be clean!"
They crashed down through the trees, taking branches with them, but still hit the ground hard. Tony, clutched against Steve's chest, had the breath knocked out of him by the impact. Locked together, they slithered down the slope, bouncing off the rocks and the odd tree, a small landslip accompanying them, until they were brought to an abrupt halt by a live oak. Steve's grip slackened abruptly, and Tony rolled on for a few yards before he could bring himself to a stop.
"What do you want me to say, Stark? Sorry? Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I was wrong about Bucky, though I'm damn well not sorry that he's still alive. I'm sorry I messed up your plans to cripple the Avengers—"
"Which is why we aren't 'marching to Fury's fife' any longer." Steve smiled reminiscently at Tony, who nodded.
"Out of harm's way," Tony said dismissively, but there was apprehension behind his next question. "Does Pepper know that Rushman called?"
"You'd rattle like a forty-year old Trabant*," Tony replied. He was only just beginning to realise how strange her presence here was. The delay was another effect of shock, he decided, surprised that he was still functioning in anything resembling a  vaguely normal fashion. He couldn't even guess at what Jan's costume was made of, but if Hank could not only master the art of shrinking humans and had somehow got Jan to grow wings during the process, then the material was likely to have some amazing properties.
The – Mandarin? – raised his left hand, where the black-stoned ring had settled in the midst of four others, all with their separate gems.
Pepper's face fell. "I thought— What, something came up? What am I, chopped liver? You talked to Dad
When Steve had finished the chocolate and PowerBars, and drunk a large carton of juice, he began carefully folding and stacking the wrapping papers. That task completed, he took a breath, set his jaw, and looked up at Tony from under insufferably long lashes, "Thank you."
"I don't suppose that even one second – correct that, one nano-second – of your time is ever wasted Nat, even if you're only keeping Barton in line."
Steve's face set into expressionlessness as he tried to conceal the hurt. He had bared his own heart to Tony but his lover had just shut him out. By time Tony turned to look at him, dark eyes huge and only a faint flush visible on the planes of his cheekbones, Steve's best poker face was in place.
"Probably not. And I do not wish to be. We are now drifting in a current that will take us... to our destination."
He had been silent too long. Tony's hand gripped his bicep, and Steve did not resist the pull which brought them face to face. And Tony's face was too close. His eyes, darker than the shadows beyond the lake, only a few inches from Steve's own, were shrewd and assessing, the eyebrows above them drawn together and high forehead lined in a frown. "Steve? You okay?"
It was dark, save for the tiny flecks of luminescence in the rock and the reflected glow of the firebox. Of course, no daylight could penetrate this far underground, and he had no watch, so he had no idea how long he had slept.
"Tony, are you—? God, what happened? Are you all right?" Even as he spoke Howard was kneeling at his son's side.
Pepper was too angry to notice. "Oh, I should have realised sooner, remembered that you always saw your women as disposable – after all, I threw enough of them out of the Malibu house. Men, though— You flirt with them as well as women and I always wondered about how close you were to Jim—"
"Can he?" That was Steve, who had arrived a short time ago and somehow managed to make his way through to this consulting room without creating a scene.
I stopped making weapons – and why I allowed him to have the armour, despite that. Well, I won't make that mistake again." He took another step forward. Steve didn't move, stayed leaning casually against the lab bench, arms folded. If Tony took a swing at him, he could avoid it easily enough, but if it went that far, it was over, and he was on his own again.
"Fuck," Tony said. If he'd been awake he could have warned Steve the instant he opened the crack in the rock. Now they were both trapped.
Pepper was staring at him with an odd expression and, oh, fuck it, the truth gas or whatever it was must still be affecting him, and had he said that aloud?
Four small metal crates lay close to the portal, which was only just visible as a blue-white shimmer in the air, barely brighter than the artificial light.
Steve had spent the last six months or so terrified for Tony on his own behalf: he didn't need this new terror on behalf of, well, the rest of the world.
Behind him, he heard the boot jets fire up. Then, suddenly, the room blazed with blinding light as the unibeam fired over his head, striking Yogthulu on its opened mouth.
"Sir, there is an unknown and dangerous force building—" Jarvis began. Then the clouds exploded into a dark tunnel laced with rainbows.
"Okay, okay. Stay here if you like. There's a mattress and some blankets in the alcove over there. It's where I crash when I'm working."
Stark seemed taken aback for a few seconds. "No, no. I mean, I know your rep, obviously and it's one hell of a rep. You'd better brace yourself, Cap, because this will come as a shock. The war was over close to seventy years ago." He paused, plainly expecting a reaction. "Don't you believe me?"
"If you had been human," he elaborated, "I could have hurt you badly when you woke me just now. Maybe even killed you.”
"She isn't currently a redhead," Marilyn was continuing, quite oblivious of his confusion, "or employed by us, of course, but she contacted me when I was in Washington, took me to lunch, actually. Lots of girl talk – and gave me something to pass on to you."
Steve scrambled upstream, fighting his way through the overhanging branches, until he was in water just a few inches deep. Only then did he let himself fall forward, then rolled onto his back. The relief brought by the cold water almost turned him dizzy.
Carter was smiling to herself, plainly feeling that Jarvis had scored her some points. Ignoring Tony, she turned to Steve: "Captain, this conversation might be easier without Mr Stark's intervention."
"Maybe that's the fault of modern day physics," Tony retorted. "You want me to upgrade your weapons, Rhodey? Just leave the suit in the Tower workshop—"
"Power's out all over the building but Jarvis says there's some sort of knockout  gas being fed through the air conditioning so you'd better be— whoa!"
"They aren't after my tech," Tony said. "Or information about... well, anything in particular. Which is damned insulting."
The arc reactor was flickering. Steve's heart skipped in sympathy – and fear. Then "EMP," Iron Man's distorted voice said. "Just glanced... shoulder plate." There was a moment's pause, presumably as Tony gathered breath. "Christ, that was powerful. Thanks for putting him down."
"What am I gonna do, Steve?" he asked after a while. "Pepper's gone, and for nothing. The Avengers are falling apart before they've even come together."
Steve, Tony realised belatedly, was beaded with water, though the taped down dressing that covered most of his back was still dry.
"But the letter might not be," Tony angled the pliers better to see the front of the envelope. "Well, it's a British stamp, at least, and it's franked, though that's so smudged you can't read any of it." He turned the envelope over. "Same false return address." Putting down envelope and pliers he snapped on the gloves and extracted the letter itself.
"Why?" Natasha asked. "She's Margaret Carter's great-niece, one of SHIELD's most effective agents and—"
"Ulysses," Steve said promptly. "My parents had a Civil War thing, y'know." It had seemed appropriate when he had discussed it with Howard, what seemed like a lifetime ago. Ulysses, the wanderer, who had finally come home. Howard had said he would fix it: Steve hadn't been sure how and hadn't cared much – then.
. We were taking some film and testing this," Jan went on, waving a casual hand towards Hank's helmeted head, "when we heard your report on the radio and if we can confirm that sighting, with photos— I guess you'll be glad to have your names in the papers when we write the story?"
A compromise candidate after the two front-runners for her party's Presidential nomination had cut each other's throats by digging too much dirt on each other, she had, to everyone's surprise including her own, been elected by a small majority in the Electoral College (though her majority in the popular vote had been larger.)
"Bruce, how has Tony has gotten this reputation as a ladies' man?" Steve asked, and Tony could see the flash of white as he grinned, despite the dimness of the room.
He did not remark on these facts to Steve, primarily because he suspected their conversations were being recorded. Steve seemed to have the same suspicion because he, also, had kept the conversation to trivialities.
He was rewarded with smothered laughter, and felt all the tension drain out of him. Suddenly, he very much wanted to sit down.
Tony couldn't argue with that, much as he wanted to. Instead, he moved on. "Even if Jarvis can get an indication of where they were keeping the War Machine armour it doesn't mean that Rhodey's there, or even that he's still alive," he said. He shook his head. "I want to go looking for him, Steve."
Tony shrugged, though his shoulders were stiff with tension. "Jarvis monitors everyone in the Tower; you know that, or you should – you ask him where I am, often enough."
But, there was a downside and Rhodey had just voiced it; that the military and the politicians would assume that Erskine's formula had been re-created, heralding a new army of super-soldiers to do their bidding. Apparently they'd forgotten that Steve Rogers hadn't been all that amenable to orders from above. And wasn't now.
Steadying himself on the boot-thrusters, Tony wiped blood from the eye-slit sensors and looked down at the scattered and splattered newspeople with a certain amount of satisfaction.
"Jesus." Steve was beginning to realise just how deeply Tony had been betrayed in the past. Pepper's was probably the final straw. It would be amazing if he had any capacity for trust left.
"Or what?" Tony felt a hand on his shoulder, and knew it was Bruce. He shook it off angrily. "Invade Stark Tower? Or was it the government who just tried that? And failed."
An eyebrow went up in scepticism, though Tony neither spoke nor relinquished his grip on Steve's arm, just held his gaze. He was so close Steve could feel the brush of breath against his skin.
The Panther rounded on Tony, "No! He... escaped. Ordered those loyal to him not to fight back and went into hiding."
Steve's modified bike. Tony bit back an angry comment: Steve would not have objected. "But how did you know—?" His eyes went to Jan. "Traitor."
"None of you can do anything right now. A lot of the equipment still isn't working and the computers aren't on line," Tony said. "That's because of you, Rogers. I need to get to work on it right away."
"Was Heimdall joshing us?" Steve asked, as he and Thor trudged through the water-heavy sand towards the rocks at the base of the cliff.
"And aren't you ... er... supposed to be at a board meeting in ..." Bruce looked at his watch. "Forty-five minutes."
Tony shrugged elaborately. "Almost certainly SHIELD." He hoped he sounded confident and untroubled, but Steve was frowning at him. No doubt there would be questions to answer from him. "And SHIELD, while not our enemies, are not allies or friends, either. The Avengers have broken their links with the organisation."
that armour and stuck fucking Hammer guns on it, which failed just like I knew they were going to at the wrong moment. Never buy Hammer tech, Rogers, it'll let you down every fucking time.
"Not completely. There's something bugging you. At first I thought it was that Colonel Rhodes hasn't contacted you, but Jarvis says you've located him."
"Wait!" Thor caught hold of Iron Man's arm and held him against the strength of the repulsors. "If the winds and the lightning do not destroy you, our enemies may."
"Sure I can," Steve said. "In the military there are times when it's not just legal but mandatory to disobey orders. This was one. Besides, Rhodes is your friend, and no one but a fool would send a friend to kill you."
"Who designed the backyard rocket that killed all of them," Tony said. "Brilliant theoretical scientist, Richards, but no engineer."
Seconds later, he was alone and cold again, huddling on himself, trying to ignore all the things Tony had said and failing, as he had failed so many times to justify his actions to himself over the last few months.
And, right now, Tony was cuddled against his chest, arm around his waist, face pressed into the curve between Steve's neck and shoulders, beard prickling his skin.
"Ms Potts has been attempting to call Captain Rogers on his cell since she left the building," Jarvis said, and the room was suddenly quiet. "It is, of course, going straight to voice mail. She has left both a message and a text asking him to call her urgently."
"Shit," Tony said, even as Steve dropped his hand and started running towards the explosion. "Someone's taken over my gig." He sounded as if he was right on Steve's tail, but there was no time to check, because the door was a stride away.
"Possibly the most exclusive restaurant in the world. Nearly-as-rich-as-me guy I know hired a five Michelin starred chef and most of her staff to cook for him personally, but she only came on condition that she was allowed to keep her sous chefs and apprentices, and to run a small exclusive restaurant for them to keep their hands in. Rich guy lives up top, the restaurant's below. There are also four private dining rooms that were leased to friends of the owner. Mine is available to other people – at a huge cost – if I'm not in California. But if I am here, I have priority, whether someone else has tried to reserve it or not. I rang Miranda this morning and told her we'd be here around two. And we're on time." Tony steered the Ferrari down a short tunnel and into a cleft in hillside which had been roofed in some transparent material and park in a wide space with a discreet plaque marked AES. "Come along. Miranda hates for the food to be kept waiting."
"Let me worry about that. You do your job, Agent." That last word was, he supposed, a risk, but he calculated the odds of her not being an agent of SHIELD as vanishingly small.
"And crash," he went on blithely, saving the 'interesting' email and following up the sender. "Dad and I saw it from the house. I came to help but all I could do was fish a few live people and a lot of dead bodies out of Long Island Sound." He spread his hands. "That's all."
He had no doubt that Shuri would use her weapon if necessary: Peggy had always been more ruthless than he was. And Natasha. Not to mention Hill...
"Hey, that was a classic," Tony protested, but it was half hearted, because he was throbbing with desire...
Tony took the wheel and they left the airport with only a perfunctory check of their papers. And then it was Tony who broke the silence, picking up almost exactly where he had left off hours before. "So, you and Pepper. You got on okay?"
Tony rose slowly from the deck, hovering on the repulsors. He liked the height advantage. "Are you sure? Because I have an exact GPS location on the pterathopter and I have to tell you that you're not within two hundred yards. With all that mud down there it might as well by two hundred miles. You're going to spend so much time looking you'll find yourself arguing over jurisdiction with Homeland Security, the Coast Guard and the police Harbour Unit . Well, at least it'll give me time to get clear in case Cap's right about those spheres being bombs and you set them off accidentally."
The steps clanged under his feet, the noise echoing madly around the chamber, but they were solid enough and there wasn't anyone to hear. They led into a circular chamber, with smooth concrete walls covering what was presumably rock. There was no sign of a way in or out, other than the stairway.
According to the President's schedule, she had returned to the White House about four hours ago. Despite the late hour she was probably still working.
For a moment he panicked, thinking he might be facing the time-contemporary Natasha, but he reminded himself sharply that this was not how she had looked during the Battle of New York.
The tension inside Tony eased a little. "So you were going to pretend you were Peggy?" he said to Carter.
"Yes," Hogun said, as he waxed his fingers, then pulled Steve's short untidy beard into a semblance of Fandral's. "He could even send you on to Valhalla, on the basis that you died here."
Slowly, the woman who had challenged him laid her gun on the ground and, one by one, the other SHIELD agents followed her lead. The Wakandans moved in to collect their weapons, and Tony's interpreter steered his vehicle in close and spoke quietly.
Tony put down his fork and eyed Natasha suspiciously. "Why the Attorney General's office? I mean, apart from the obvious: that the Justice Department is advising the White House and the Pentagon on their legal disputes."
He wanted a partnership with Sam, but the other man seemed content to follow him without asking too many questions. Unlike Tony... and Thor, Bruce, Natasha and Clint, come to that?
"Yes, definitely, and possibly – that's why Hank wants to talk to you. I don't think he'll object to Steve."
"Hey," Tony said, after giving them both a decent amount of time to enjoy the kiss. He tapped Steve's arms with his fists. "Let go. C'mon, Cappuccino. Sooner we get this done, sooner we can sleep."
"It's the Pym particles that'll win you your Nobel," Jan told him. "And controlling their use will be enough trouble, believe me, Hank, darling. Besides, I thought you were a pacifist?"
Volstagg ('the Voluminous' according to Fandral, whom Steve was not always inclined to believe) turned out to be full of entertaining stories of his own past, of Thor, Sif, Fandral, Hogun and sometimes Loki, though he never spoke that name without contempt. Yet Steve occasionally noticed a hesitation in the practiced flow, as if he was editing someone out of the narrative. He was also, Steve came to realise, as kind as he was large and that the insults he received from Thor, Fandral and Sif were simply affectionate teasing.
"Tony is brilliant and fascinating and self-obsessed and terribly needy; being with him is exhilarating and very, very stressful. I couldn't stay on the rollercoaster, Steve. I still love him, in a way, but it's such a relief being out of his shadow, being free just to be
As the meeting broke up, Natasha drew Tony aside. "You need someone in Washington, Stark. I'm sure you're right about the conspiracy, but we have no idea how far it goes. According to the polls, the nominees are running neck and neck. It's impossible to tell which one, if either, has anything to gain by steering Sandro into the most heavily built-up area in the USA and its financial heart."
"In this case, you will. No science-babble this time, Steve. Betty – my fellow researcher into gamma rays – emailed Jan, or, rather, she emailed Jarvis, who she thinks is a flesh and blood person, for Jan's dropbox. Don't look at me like that – Tony told her Jarvis was head of security for Stark Industries."
"It's designed to affect you, you idiot!" His voice echoed round the building. "Fuck it, speakers off, for God's sake. Jarvis, I need to get downstairs."
Tony had reached the window. The blinds were open but there was no light in the room. His own lights picked out the edges of furniture, reflected off a television screen and a mirror.
The ornithopter lurched sideways as Steve dragged the pilot from his seat – a bicycle seat? – and picked his way through the tangle to the controls.
As it was, she'd insisted on a pristine white shirt to go with his black hand-tailored suit and he hadn't even been able to sneak a coloured tie past her eagle eye. Tony had searched the internet and gotten hold of one in blue with little Captain America shields scattered across it. He'd thought it appropriate, that Coulson would have appreciated it, but Pepper had nixed it the instant she saw it.
Once again, greyness threatened to overcome Steve, but this time it was from that truth... oh god, if that was true... Natasha. His Natasha, who was also who the Natasha listening to this would become, was doomed to worse than death on Vormir...
"Don't be so sure of that," Steve said, and his glance flickered to Tony as he spoke, his lips quirking in a small smile.
Tony had forgotten how much he loved the cabin on the lake. He had mainly come here with his father's butler, Edwin Jarvis, who had, surprisingly, taught him to paddle a canoe, to sail and fish, and later to shoot. Lori had taught him to ride, her father to drive, and those occasions where Howard had joined them had been the happiest of his life. It was only later that he understood how difficult it had been for his father to visit this place where he had spent such happy times with his wife.
"Umm. Good?" Pepper was prettier than any of the SHIELD agents anyway, and he had better booze in the limo. "Maybe we can indulge a few. Tonight."
For a split second there was a coincidental silence – and in it there was a tiny sound, the slither of something soft – perhaps cloth or leather – far above, inaudible, perhaps, to anything but Steve's enhanced senses.
Storm was watching him with amusement. "They aren't telling us fly-boys who built it, either, Mr Stark. It's all on the QT."
Tony grinned. "Well, it may be my only chance to coerce someone into doing something this stupid, considering my track record. Seriously, it can just be a legal fiction, if that's what you want. We can end it easily enough, after a year or so, when you've redeemed yourself in government eyes. I won't stand in your way."
"No. Tell him I'll be there in a few minutes. And he'd better have that coffee ready and waiting!" Damn it, he'd been tortured by terrorists and survived to build the miniature ARC reactor and the first of the Iron Man suits. He'd survived Obie's treachery. And Vanko – though Hammer's involvement had given him better odds there. He could survive anything.
He'd surely waited long enough for anyone watching – and presumably they were watching – to be either shocked or interested or both. Now his right hand was hidden by Steve's body, he could move it to his belt.
And that was Barton, who was seated beside him. Thor was, improbably and uncomfortably, perched on the bench seat opposite, his hammer resting across his knees, a deeply reassuring presence.
The Lady Sif was more enigmatic, and treated Steve with a reserve he put down to his Midgardian status. Her eyes were most often on Thor, whom she regarded with a mixture of exasperation, fondness and respect that reminded Steve uncomfortably of Pepper's attitude to Tony.
Pepper hesitated for a moment, and Steve got the impression she was weighing her words. "He was a good friend and I had a lot to thank him for. My life, and Tony's."
Thor let go, leaving the Iron Man to take the whole weight of the truck, which rocked ominously forward. But Thor whirled with unbelievable speed, and both hands were suddenly braced besides Iron Man's halting the incipient forward movement of the vehicle. His head went down, his muscles flexing and he roared with the effort, almost as loudly as the Hulk would have done.
"What, helping me stay alive isn't of use? Don't answer that! Try this instead: Steve's a New York boy. He made his way back there because that's where he feels most comfortable – and then we just happened to save each other's lives. He watches my back, I watch his."
"More likely after the vibranium. From what we know now, it's probably the reason why the goons behind this Klaw character also tried to kill me."
"Fuck the serum. Don't tell me you aren't in pain," Tony snapped as he rose to his feet. "You stay there. I'll—"
It was a plea for understanding but, as always, it revealed the blind loyalty that provoked a surge of jealousy in Tony. And anger, the anger that never went away. "Sure," he said coldly. "Also, now Peggy Carter's dead, he's your only link to the past that you refuse let go of. Not to mention your guilt trip about the whole falling-off-a-train-and–down-mountain-then-brainwashed thing. Add survivors' guilt on top of that—"
It wasn't difficult to find the case: it was lying on the floor, shredded. It was only as he bent over it that he realised was that it was made of vibranium steel.
"Yes, sir. I have analysed your scans of the funeral parlour documentation, the gravestone and the vegetation around it. I can find no trace of amendment of the documentation or of any interference with the grave or the gravestone."
"Why didn't you tell me?" Steve demanded, striding forward so that he loomed over Tony, who rose to his feet, though he knew that would only decrease the height difference, not eliminate it.
"We don't know. But you are here against his edict – and alive because his son and his wife disobeyed his orders. The sword goes like this. Don't draw it unless you know how to use it." He stood back and looked at Steve assessingly. "Get those boots on and then I'll trim your beard.
T'Challa, still in the White Wolf suit, but with the mask shoved back and his arms bound to his sides, was standing facing another White Wolf – no, think of him as Hunter, otherwise it was too confusing. One of the foreigners, a leader of some kind to judge by his shoulder patches, was standing between them, looking from one to the other with a dark-blond eyebrow raised.
"Mr Stark. How did you get past security?" She did not, though, reach for any of the panic buttons that Tony knew were within easy reach.
Steve's expression didn't change, but he began to redden and there was a significant bulge in the towel.
As soon as T'Challa and Tony had left the parking area, Steve and Okoye slid out from the back of the SUV and into the remains of the planting.
Never mind that. If this time's Tony had taken possession of his temporal device, the Pym particles and the Infinity Stones, he would not rest until he understood them. And if anyone in this time could figure them out it was their very own genius billionaire. After all, he'd done it once already. Except if he tried to pick up one of the Stones...
"And have an eidetic memory," Bruce noted. He took a deep breath. "I vote to destroy it. And I say that as your friend, rather than a scientist. Though I should know just how damn dangerous the super-soldier technology can be."
Bruce frowned. "I thought you'd fried the internal circuits or nervous system of whatever those things had. Hank thinks nervous system, by the way."
"... Captain Rogers, Ms Van Dyne and Colonel Danvers appear to have rescued Lieutenant Storm and his companion. Mr Stark's private jet then took off from Travis with a flight plan filed for New York. However, following reports of evasive action by the jet and bright lights in the sky, both vanished. There has been no contact since," Jarvis finished.
Tony used Extremis to call his own armour, grateful he had left it standing in his bedroom and didn't have to struggle with the backpack.
"Like anything of Tony's, it probably can," Jan retorted. She looked sideways at Steve. "Is he okay? Tony, I mean. He was... distraught... by your apparent death in Wakanda, then there was Pepper... You know he's broken up with Pepper?"
"You okay?" Tony was kneeling at the end of the jetty, looking down at him with a smile on his lips that did not reach the rest of his face. Steve was abruptly reminded that they had parted in anger after last night's shouting match.
Now he thought about it, he'd heard that voice coming from Stark's cell phone, once. "Artificial intelligence? You're a machine? A computer?"
"Steady, steady no need to—" Tony's voice was rising, all his normal insouciance deserting him. "No, stay where you ar— urgh!"
"And he sent Hawkeye and the Widow?" There had to be something more to this. "I can't believe this weather is coincidental. What's SHIELD doing about it?"
He wasn't sure who he was pleading with. Certainly not God, who he didn't believe in, but maybe... would Odin look out for him? At least he knew that Odin actually existed in this time.
"I took my first degree at Oxford. It's a family tradition," the girl added, "and my family is very traditional."
Steve wandered round the room, unable to settle, as Tony called room service, then pressed the control that set screens sliding across the dining alcove, so the work could go ahead out of their sight.
And this was an upmarket hotel in the twenty-first century, in a bed that smelt of sex, and that was Tony sleeping beside him.
"What's in Wakanda, Stark?" Fury asked softly. "Most of the time, all we can see is jungle, ocean and mangrove swamp. And somehow you get turned back whenever you try to enter those."
Tony draw in a deep breath. Not looking at Thor, he said: "He... swallowed some sort of fucking magic potion..." He heard the break in his own voice and tried desperately to steady it. "He s-sacrificed himself..." For me.  Because part of that herb was meant for me. Oh, Christ...
It should have frightened him more than anything else he had ever seen, yet he felt nothing but relief. And a need, not to hide, but to run towards the robot.
Note the change in the rating to 'explicit.' Sorry folks. It isn't, I hope, too-much-detail explicit, but that scene is necessary for both characterisation and plot.  If you need to miss this stuff, it's the two scenes before the last scene.
Steve, however, had slid sideways past Jan and was now striding forward. "Tony, Bruce, what's wrong?"
Within an hour, when the Panther lifted the cloak, there was almost no change in the light levels, and the sky was uniformly dark. It seemed to be the signal for him to send the flier racing across the billowing surface of the forest trees.
"Of course I'm staring. Bruce never said he'd been engaged to a reincarnation of Helen of Troy. And forgive me, Dr Ross, but I'm damn sure you're used to that reaction."
Steve didn't see what happened next for he was running back across the roof to leap into the light well. He landed between the paws of an all too lifelike statue of a giant panther. He paused a moment to catch his breath , then spun and raced towards the light, to the temple entrance, where he could see Okoye struggling with the soldiers while the Hatut Zeraze were split between guarding Tony and Hunter. She had, he hoped, drawn their attention for just long enough.
Tony wasn't sure whether this was true – though it did sound plausible – or an evasion. Certainly he had not seen anyone use a cell, nor had they found one on White Wolf or his men. "There go the property values around here."
"Then you had better think up a damn good excuse that isn't going to cost you your friends," Howard snapped back. "Meanwhile, ring Agent Potts."
"Because he doesn’t have any," Tony said. "Nor any records. And if Hank Pym has destroyed the last sample, that's it. Finito."
Iron Man's shoulder plates lifted, and spheres of repulsor energy scattered, honing in one by one on the sources of the energy beams and whatever stood behind them. The resulting explosions surprised him with their strength, though the Jericho, on which they were based, had been his most powerful weapon.
"And it seemed to complete the parallel," Tony continued. "You know, between you and me. We'd both been remade into superheroes and both sort of died and Rhodey hadn't given up on me and Dad never gave up on you. You'd flown that abomination of a plane straight down into the Arctic Ocean, saving New York and God knows how many other cities, all alone, knowing you were going to die – and right then I was flying towards my death too, and not exactly alone because, well, I had JARVIS, but I'm not sure he counts..." He lifted his eyes to meet Steve's. "Did you have problems figuring out what to say to your girlfriend? While dying heroically, I mean." He pulled a face. "I can't believe you had the nerve to date Margaret Carter, though from her wartime photos, I can hardly blame you for trying. Boy, was she
"We had an attempted mugging," Tony explained, but Pepper's snort of exasperation stopped him in his tracks.
With that example to spur him on, Steve had attempted to put his foot down. Finally, he had been allowed, a tad grudgingly, to design and decorate his own quarters. It had been even more difficult to persuade Tony to make the other suites a blank canvas that the appropriate Avenger could tweak to their own requirements, but he and Pepper had managed it between them.
Steve didn't think he could make it back to his own bedroom, believed the only thing keeping him on his feet was Tony's grip, though it was that that was softening his muscles, melting his bones.
As they had been talking, more Wakandans began to emerge from the shadows, though Hank's appearance had once again sent them into retreat. Okoye waved and called out to them in Wakandan, though this innocent gesture seemed to cause intense confusion.
It was enough, though. The vehicle cleared the roofless walls and rubble by a totally adequate three inches, allowing Tony to turn it in a wide circle. He scanned the compound-turned-battlefield thanking (problematic) deities for the white suit that identified Steve in the gloom. To Tony's profound relief, he was still on his feet and fighting.
Steve edged along the ridge, trying to quash the uneasiness that had nothing to do with a fear of heights. He ought to be watching his feet but couldn't take his eyes off Tony, ready to leap forward if he slipped.
"No," Thor said. "But I may be able to turn it aside. Why was I not informed that this was happening?" he added sharply.
Steve took a deep breath. Tony had levelled with him. He could not, in all conscience, keep his own reasoning from him. "I stole this body, Tony, whether that device put me here or not. I can't keep it, not if there's a chance of giving it back to its rightful owner."
"My contacts are better," Natasha said. "And SHIELD might help, particularly since Thor saved the east coast from hurricane Sandro."
"That wasn't lying down on the wire, fuck it, that was standing in no man's land with a searchlight on you while holding up a notice saying 'Shoot Me' and a big target replacing the star on your chest.
"Coffee, bagels, doughnuts, sandwiches, whatever, just keep it simple," Tony snapped. "And you aren't Thor's keeper, Jarvis, any more than you are mine."
No way could killing Tony Stark or causing Bruce to Hulk out have been hushed up. With no time to dismantle the booby trap, the agents on the ground would've used the LMD as an attempt at distraction without revealing their presence.
Clea picked up the artefact from where it lay on the floor and examined it critically. "This is... Where did this come from?"
Steve had a hand up, signalling to Tony to stay back as he flung himself through the hole and into a shoulder roll across the hard packed earth. Coming to a crouch, he signalled to Tony to follow him.
"No!" Tony exclaimed, then, in response the Natasha's quizzical eyebrow: "For one thing, we can't produce a body. So Captain Rogers will have to disappear as mysteriously as he arrived. I have no intention of handing over the shield and, for the sake of Steve's reputation; I'm also continuing the lawsuits over the Captain America name."
A hand reached past him to pick up the whisky glass, and a warm body settled besides him, a brush of shoulder and arm that sent familiar heat coiling in stomach and groin.
What? Pepper wasn't talking about today, but about that period when he had been wandering randomly across America trying to find... he didn't know. Except that he hadn't found it.
"I've gotten a secret message from Natasha. It's what I came to tell you. Let's get changed and we'll view it down in the shop."
Tony didn't pretend not to know what he meant. "I know where they are. Approximately. Always assuming that Thor is still in Asgard."
"Communications were bad in the wake of Sandros," Natasha said. "So when we first lost contact with Cap we didn't worry. He'd said that he would be heading back East, eventually, but there was something he and the Wasp had to do first. But there's been nothing since that first call from California."
Tony still had not returned but assuming that, when he did, he and Pepper would want some time alone, Steve excused himself and went back to his suite. For a while he watched the news on TV, then, disgusted, switched on his tablet and checked the news sites on the net. They were worse.
she is. It's not as if she doesn't have an apartment a few minutes walk away and a house out on Fire Island."
"Pep, you look great," Tony said, putting more emotion than he felt into his voice, though the Martini had given him a faint buzz that was helpful. He was still vaguely detached from what was happening around him, had been ever since he had fallen in the workshop.
The first thing that struck Steve was how young Storm looked, though he was older by a couple of years than Steve himself had been when he joined the army. The woman at his side was even younger, probably no more than eighteen – just a girl, really – but she moved with the instinctive balance of a dancer or a fighter: not a soldier but a warrior.
The out-of-left-field mention of Cap rang loud alarm bells. Tony remembered his earlier conversation with Rhodey on that subject all too well. "I don't keep track of his whereabouts," he lied. From Rhodes's snort and Steve's expression neither of them believed him.
"Natasha," Steve interrupted, "you're forgetting that Tony and I have been working as partners for months. If either you or Clint had known your partner was dead, then found they were alive after all, wouldn't you want a little time to work things out?"
"At least someone made you the offer. No one gave me the choice of being a warrior. I had to fight for it, though Frigga and Thor and— Eventually they supported me, if reluctantly. Frigga herself taught me to wield a sword."
"That is so weird," Storm said. "No. I can't. I mean, Mom thought her boyfriend a tad obsessive, and too old for her, I know that, but he's dead too. In fact, he was the one who killed her – though I guess  if I'd been older I'd have been piloting that spacecraft, not Ben Grimm."
Running his hands up and down the rough concrete, he found five small indentations, and a much larger one lying below and half-enclosed by them.
"Which is odd, because you and Jean have not met before today. Your image of her is strange and troubling. I am imposing my mental image of myself here, but she is merely observing. I find it... interesting."
Bruce took off his glasses and pocketed them, better to glare at Tony. "You are not helping," he told him. "Do I have to call out the Other Guy to knock some sense into both of you?"
Now it was Tony's turn to stare out to sea as the sun rose behind them and laid yellow light on rock and sand.
There were bright lights flashing through the fog above him. Steve lifted himself out of the stream on his elbows, ready to fight if this turned out to be the enemy, whoever the enemy might be.
"SSR bigwig, but that was after Steve took his icy dip, of course. Previous to that, his ... girlfriend? Sweetheart?" Tony wriggled his eyebrows questioningly at Steve, hoping to make him laugh.
The sergeant raised his own pewter cup in a half-ironic salute. "Can't make up their darn minds if this is a military funeral or a PR exercise," he growled. "Phil wouldn't've wanted a fuss, but he'd be honoured to have you here, Mr Stark."
Tony mentally agreed with the decision not to try to land; it would have been a close run thing even in the Ambrose channel where the helicarrier would have been almost in the Atlantic and way too far from the crash site. All the same, if SHIELD had ever hoped to keep their extraordinary craft a secret, those hopes had just been destroyed by a guy in an ornithopter.
"We were about to retreat," Clint said, "when something whispered in my ear that there was going to be a diversion and that would be a good time to head to the Tower. Then the Hulk appeared – only you say it wasn't the Hulk."
"Indeed. Thor took to lurking in the Observatory. He was there when Heimdall announced that the magic was gone and that he could see not only Anthony Stark and yourself, but a representative of old enemies whom Odin had banished back to their own dimension.
Steve swallowed against the sudden rush of emotion. "You left a lot out when you told me what you were without the suit," he said, as lightly as he could.
The President snorted. "Our – now ex – member of the WSC spun us a yarn that, according to Director Fury, he was the original Captain America frozen in Arctic ice for seventy years. Every scientist I've consulted says that's impossible, even for a super-soldier. No one has told the new delegate anything at all. Fury says that all the information on that subject has been wiped from his computer systems. As he can't prove anything, he's not making any statements, one way or another. Which seems damn suspicious, Stark."
"Not possible," Shuri replied, equally flatly. "I fed it to him in his soup after I cut it out of my arm. Now get out of our way."
Tony swore, but sat down, removed his sneakers and socks, rolled up his jeans, and waded out. The water was cold, soothing to his feet, but the concrete was covered in some sort of slime which was not just unpleasant but slippery. It was all Tony could do to stay upright, particularly as he was carrying his shoes and socks in one hand.
Happy unlocked the trunk, extracted a familiar case and tossed it to Steve, who caught it one handed. Making sure that the limo shielded him from Pepper, Hill and Tony – for vastly different reasons he had no interest in examining too closely – he shed his jacket and shirt just as Happy came to join him carrying a boot case and a large box marked with a red cross.
"Let's take a look at the closed circuit footage," Tony suggested, folding the Iron Man into a chair, which he wheeled close to the nearest console. Without taking off the gauntlets, he began to type.
Yogthulu. The creature-from-another-dimension that Doom had summoned in order to trade three pure souls, three lives – Tony, Howard and Gene – for Doom's own dead loved ones. Yogthulu, who had rejected the offering because Gene was not pure, in whatever definition of 'pure' the extraterrestrial – extra-dimensional – being was using. The creature that had swallowed Doom.
"Captain." And that was Howard, not Tony. "Time to eat. You must be starving again with that high metabolism."
Even as Tony raised his arms in what he was certain would be a vain attempt to protect his head, Steve's left arm curled about his waist while the right wrenched the seat belt from its socket. Then Tony was hauled out of his seat and, still in Steve's grip, he was tumbling through the air; red sky pierced with green, brown and ochre spinning past.
Steve rubbed a towel over his hair, grateful for the new cut that required little further attention, and then considered the limited amount of clothing he had brought with him, laid out on the bed. He wasn't going to wear the same black suit he'd worn to the cemetery and, while he was sure Tony wouldn't even blink if he wandered in wearing running gear, after the emotions that had almost overwhelmed him a couple of hours ago he wanted to insert some formality between them.
The intensity of the feeling, of passion in the kiss shocked him even as he answered it, his tired body reacting with surprising speed. He hooked his right hand into Tony's hair, holding their mouths together because, though there was a small voice in his head telling him they shouldn't be doing this, he never wanted the kisses to end.
The TV comedies and dramas turning out to be mainly incomprehensible, he was wondering if there were any real books in the penthouse when Jarvis spoke, making him jump:" Mr Stark is in the workshop, Captain. He requests that you join him there." That was, in Steve's opinion, a Jarvis translation of, "Get Rogers down here, pronto."
Jan, meanwhile, marched up to Iron Man and hammered her fists against the chest plate. "You – said – he – was – dead," she repeated, emphasising each word with a hard bang.
Tony dropped into a crouch, aiming the captured gun at the nearest group of warriors and pulling the trigger. But the gun failed to fire. Swearing, Tony reached behind him for the gun tucked into his belt – the gun T'Challa had passed to him; White Wolf's gun – even as a Hatut Zeraze warrior loomed over him, spear drawn back. Tony discharged the gun directly in his face.
Hogun shrugged again. "I am obeying my liege lord," he said and held out a hand to haul Steve to his feet.
Another of the gunmen lashed out at her with the butt of his rifle – an M-2 carbine, Tony noticed absently – but Jan had vanished before it made contact. Instead, the gun butt crashed into the side of the head of the man she had been fighting.
"I was never more serious." Tony told him. "Do I also need to give you a lecture about condom use? Stop that! I'm – I'm not... not ticklish. Steve! Stop it!"
When the bright mists cleared he was still clasping Thor's arm, but the angle was different – wrong. He was lying flat on his back, propped on huge, soft pillows—
"You wouldn't believe me if I told you. And I'd rather Fury didn't know, at least for the moment, that I'm back. Will you do that for me?"
Danvers nodded. "So, let's make it clear, you're defying a legitimate order from an authorised Air Force officer on an Air Force base."
"Yeah," and that was Tony's voice, not Iron Man's, over the communicators. "I'm calling the emergency services now." The timbre of his voice changed to the Iron Man synthesiser, but now Steve was included in those hearing him. "This is Iron Man. I have Captain America with me. You look like you could use some help down there. May we assist? Over."
"I am under instruction not to record any conversations in the penthouse or the Avengers floors unless you give me specific instructions, sir."
"The Allspeak is what allows Asgardians and non-Asgardians to speak to each other as if both were talking the same language. Unfortunately, when either uses a word or a concept the other language does not have, the translation can become problematic."
"When you said 'vibranium' I knew it was a purple-tinted silver metal with some unique properties, and when you said, 'Wakanda'..." He hesitated. "I take it that's a country, but... it scares me and reassures me all at once."
"I was... I was searching for... something. Somethings. I think at the end everything came together and, just for a moment, I knew I'd succeeded, that I'd found it. I was... well, whole. Then I wasn't. When I woke up in the workshop only seconds had passed. And I had a splitting headache. Which you do not want."
He only about two strides behind when the assassin reached the edge of the hangar roof. Even as Steve yelled, "Stop!" the assassin threw himself over the edge. Instantly, there was a flash of blue light, and the assassin vanished. Without thought, Steve leaped after him – and was instantly tumbling towards the concrete several hundred feet below.
"I can't do anything about Peggy. Dates, yeah, maybe. That's up to you. But I can give you a home, Steve. I always intended to."
"Sure you are," Storm said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Way I heard it, the Avengers disbanded. Vanished. Except for Stark and that fake Captain America."
"I have also overstepped my brief in one thing, sir. Despite your instructions not to enquire into Ms Carter's past, I ventured to look for her death certificate. May I say that I have located records in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and the date of death is consistent with that in local records and on her tombstone."
"If you had, I'd'a billed your boss," a unknown voice mocked, "because your insurance wouldn't pay out. If you'd got it right you'd have got clean away, and I coulda dealt with this scum."
He wished he'd thought harder about agreeing when Tony had proposed this hike to a stone outcrop he had sworn was called the Devil's Ironing Board. Steve was not sure he believed that, any more than he believed that Tony did not have some ulterior motive. Tony knew he enjoyed walking, and being together, and, all too possibly, that he didn't like Tony going off on his own. He needed to be there to protect him.
Even through the filters on the armour, Tony could smell the burned flesh. What it was like for Steve he could not imagine.
Tony grinned at her, showing all his teeth. "Maybe the world needs insane. Who am I to judge? I never had a chance to be normal."
"It's certainly above your pay grade," Danvers admitted. "Above mine, as it happens. I should report this to the Secretary."
Tony's eyes swept on over him and lighted on Colonel Danvers. "Have you crashed my plane, Danvers?" he demanded.
The spectral funnel built again. Then, in an explosion of rainbow light, it vanished, Thor – and Steve – along with it. The rain, though, was still falling, bouncing from the Iron Man armour, erasing the strange sigil in its flood, and washing the tears from Tony's cheeks.
"And me and my own team. Which, considering who they are, means that I need to get to the Tower right now and find myself some clean underwear."
"If that just means you're going to play around in your workshop, you can attend the meeting with the Trade Undersecretary at eleven—"
"Depressurising," Danvers informed them. "I'll free the locks on the main hatch when you give the word."
"So this seduction is a spur of the moment thing," Steve said, wondering if, in that case, he should, indeed, back out.
Not that he'd ever mean what Bucky Barnes had to Steve, but that wouldn't stop his friend from coming after him.
Steve and Okoye had been waiting at the rendezvous point for exactly thirty-three minutes now – not that Steve had been checking the time more than once every two minutes, of course. Their orders from T'Challa had been to head back to the jungle house after twenty if he and Tony failed to join them, though neither of them had made any move to leave.
"It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr Rogers." N'kendi actually sounded sincere as he shook Steve's hand.
There was no movement, no light from the portal, no sign of any of the installations, though, as there was no daylight, the doors were must be intact.
"Sorry, sweetheart." Steve did not sound in the least sorry. "But really, do you want Jan to come in here looking for you right now?"
But, far too soon, Steve's legs had begun to feel tired and now, reluctantly, he was re-tracing his steps home.
"The grandkids are at Disney World, Tony. I think Sandro's going to miss Florida, but we can't be sure."
Tony's plans are in motion, but there is no peace for him on the West coast.  Meanwhile, Asgard is not a safe a haven as it might appear.
That certainly changed Tony's expression. "You're kiddin'—" he protested. "I wouldn't be seen dead... You aren't kidding?"
"Heart rate falling, sir, and his temperature is still a several degrees above normal, if I presumed to know what is normal for him. He is, however, close to consciousness."
"It's just a bruise," Steve told him, reaching casually for a towel. "Got a bit of a knock from a chunk of concrete."
"His name hasn't come up," Natasha replied. "The same can't be said of the Air Force Chief of Staff: he's part of the Pentagon cabal who're out to take you down and get their hands on Steve."
Half an hour later, they were zigzagging up the side of a mountain, keeping closer to the rock face than seemed possible.
When he raised his head to look at his reflection in the mirrored wall he realised his face was tear-stained.
The mattress crackled uncomfortably under him, and exploration revealed Steve's letter. Tony growled and looked round for a trash can. Unable to locate one, he settled for laying the letter carefully on the bedside table, telling himself that it was, after all, a curiosity. And he'd get rid of it later.
Inside Stark Tower, Steve's adjustment to life in the twenty-first century continued apace. True to his word, Tony had managed to persuade, or more probably bribe, two standout teachers of hand-to-hand combat, including disciplines of which Steve hadn't even heard, to come to the tower to tutor them both. Also, and this really surprised Steve, he managed to clear enough of his schedule to attend each class, though it was Steve who invited Pepper and Happy.
Steve thought wildly, wondering how he could regain control of the conversation. "Well, it came off worse against his defences," he said. "As you will, Colonel, if you take on any of us. We aren't your enemies; we're just Tony Stark's friends."
His eyes fixed on Steve's, Tony unbuckled his belt while toeing off his shoes, then pulled down pants and boxers in a single movement and stepped free. Breaking eye contact, he turned, leaned his hands against the wall, and spread his legs.
Steve felt his heart sink. Tony knew. But how? He couldn't believe that Fury had told Tony, of all people, and he'd done his best to keep his problems secret...
The woman seated in an expensive and modern executive chair that was so out of place behind the huge Victorian mahogany desk had no such difficulty in maintaining her dignity as she took off her reading glasses and frowned at them both.
"No?" Gene's eyebrows were raised. "What did Yogthulu want you, me and Howard for but to eat our souls?"
Steve stepped up to the door and knocked. When that didn't work, he rapped hard on the metal shutters protecting the gatehouse's interrogation hatch.
Steve reminded himself even as Jan, finally seeing the threat, vanished into insect size. He could have taken the pilot's gun away then, but he had a feeling that words would be more effective in this case. And Betty held control of the situation.
"No. I'll let you know as soon as I do. Meanwhile, what's your opinion on Coulson's old grandpappy?"
It was no use trying to sleep now; the sun was rising. Tony had still been working on his tablet when Steve had retired the night before, so was likely to sleep late. Steve could get rid of his inconvenient erection with a cold shower and Tony would be none the wiser. He pulled on a towelling robe as he headed for the bathroom.
"Let's blow this joint, Cap" he whispered in Steve's ear, as he teased the buckle open, unclipped it from the belt, then hooked a fingernail into the catch on the edge, pulling the hair-thin wire free. "Close your eyes."
"It wasn't," Danvers said. "Your abductors weren't Air Force, though they had all the right papers, which means traitors in the command structure." She raised her head to stare back at Tony, her jaw set as hard as his, her expression as cold. "I wasn't entirely honest when I met you the first time, Stark. Jim is my good friend, but I'm an agent of the Secretary of the Air Force, who wanted to know why his one and only superhero had vanished."
"Slow down, would you, Steve? Something's disturbed the ants in this area," Hank reported from the back seat as they rolled downhill towards what Jan's map told them was Oliver's Plot.
