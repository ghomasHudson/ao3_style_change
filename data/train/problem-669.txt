“Don’t talk with your mouth full, kiddo,” Greg said to Bunny as he walked into the living room to ruffle Sherlock’s hair and say good morning to the boy.
“Don't like it,” he said, rubbing fingers against his tongue.
“I’m not mad, princess,” Greg said, needing to assure Bunny first and foremost.  “But I am a little confused.  Daddy asked you to use the potty before you left Baker Street.”
“No,” Sherlock said with a sign, turning the laptop toward John to show a failed tetris board.  “Just bored.”
“Want to see the ducks,” John had whispered, and Mycroft smiled at John’s simple request.
“Do you remember what happened to Bunny last night?”
Greg had to stop himself from smiling.  It really was amazing, the lengths to which the Holmes brothers could go to turn even normal concerns into large-scale emotional productions.  Yes, Mycroft’s worries were a bit more dire than Sherlock’s at the moment, but it was almost as if the concept of simply asking for help was inherently lost to them; they could solve other people’s problems with their eyes closed, but every personal issue became something insurmountable.
He yanked John towards the door while the second tech helped a shouting, put-upon Anderson to his feet, then dragged John out of the motel room by a firm grip on his upper arm.  They were in the parking lot a moment later, John swearing and fighting to pull away from Greg’s grasp.
one.  The liquid spilled off the seat and began to drip into the footwell.
Greg ran a hand along the back of his neck as Mycroft waited for him to explain.
“Come on,” Greg said with a smirk, wrapping an arm around John’s shoulders.  “You’re too cute for your own good.”
“Mycroft?” John asked once he’d stood from the bed himself.
“As for making fun, you can be assured that if my big brother starts any of that, my mum will have him in the corner faster that you can say ‘time out.’”
Bunny paused in the washing of his hands and shook his head.
“Do you want to tell me what happened?” Mycroft asked, “What you've been worrying about?”
Hi, loves! I apologize for keeping you all waiting--this chapter took a while to settle into itself, which means it took many more hours to complete and edit than I'd originally expected!  I'm still not 100% confident with this chapter as it stands, so feel free to chime in if you see any areas for improvement!
Bunny let his head fall back against the back panel of the desk.  It had been a rough day, and he was still feeling the effects of not sleeping well coupled with his cold, which only seemed to be getting worse.  Bunny hadn’t meant to misbehave so much throughout the day, but he didn’t feel like himself, hadn’t felt like himself since slipping down into his most recent headspace.
Later note: edited slightly for continuity after "Little John and Uncle Greg" was posted :)
Sherlock sighed; Mycroft knew that, even regressed, Sherlock knew when he was being manipulated into doing something he didn't necessarily want to do, but this time he did not argue.  He pushed down his pants and pull-up and, sitting down, peed in the toilet.
You're all the best!  Your comments make me very happy and definitely inspire me to keep this story going!
John tried to accept Lestrade’s words as truth.  It was something he’d been working on with Mycroft, not second guessing the motives behind someone’s statements.  And, in that moment, exhausted and feeling vulnerable, the memory of Mycroft’s assurances in the back of his mind, he allowed himself to let go.
“Use your words,” Mycroft said, gently guiding Sherlock away from him so he could look him in the eye.  “I can’t help if I don’t know what’s wrong.”
Mycroft knew they’d gone too long.  Even Greg had worried about Sherlock being able to stay adult in Mycroft’s presence during the trip, having seen some telling warning signs over the ending days of their last case that generally signalled the man was in the early stages of slipping.
To his credit, Bunny did not cry or whine.  He only nodded, as if he’d been prepared for the possibility of a spanking all along.
“Very,” John said, shifting his hips just enough to gain friction against Sherlock’s palm.
The day had been draining.  John was feeling the effects of the emotional ups and downs, particularly given his breakdown up in the attic earlier that afternoon.  Being young comforted and calmed him, but there was a different kind of comfort in coming up for air every once in awhile to process his thoughts as an adult.  John needed moments of adulthood between long sessions in headspace or he was prone to pulling himself out of headspace with overthinking.  At that moment, sitting sentinel over a sleeping Sherlock as Mycroft and Greg settled to sleep down the hallway, John was glad for the quiet moment to process the day’s events in his adult mind.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he sat up, took his thumb out of his mouth, and shook his head emphatically.
"I can help," he said.  "We'll talk later about where you were.  Just tell me what's wrong, Sherlock."
This seemed to be new information to Sherlock, who turned down the corners of his mouth and shrugged, then sighed in annoyance.
Bunny was sobbing, wet and sad and needy, but he reached his arms out towards Mycroft when the man appeared.
not usually like that.”
John appeared to think for a moment before shrugging.  Mycroft hummed.
“You’re protecting him,” Greg said, obviously sensing Mycroft’s unease and remembering the conversation they’d had back at his flat.
John ran a hand across his eyes.  He shouldn’t let himself slip, shouldn’t acknowledge the tight neediness in the center of his chest begging for him to let go.  But there was only so much strength and stoicism he could sustain, particularly when his Daddy was listening, was simply waiting for him to admit to what he needed.  John sighed.
--growing more comfortable with the idea that his little side was simply a part of everyday life.  Hell, the man had taken the time to pack pull-ups and pacifiers even while knowing he would be going to his sister’s house to meet her new girlfriend.  It was all Greg could do not to smother the boy in kisses and call Mycroft immediately to inform him.
Daddy nodded and Bunny blinked back a fresh wave of tears that threatened to spill down his cheeks.  He clutched Willa the rabbit and pressed himself beneath Daddy’s arm.  Papa must have noticed Bunny’s continued distress, because he leaned down close and kissed him once more, this time on the cheek.
“Keep your chair on the ground, Sherlock,” Daddy said, voice as stern as his eyes.  “You’re dangerously close to a time-out.”
“‘Lock, we’ve talked about this,” Mycroft began, shifting to look him in the eye.  “Some families don’t follow the rules, and that’s okay.”
John pushed the door closed all the way before dressing as quickly as he could.  He didn’t want anyone walking in on him and, when he heard the doorbell ring, he had the irrational fear that somehow the takeaway delivery man would sense that he was yanking a pull-up over his thighs.
Mycroft didn't respond, but he didn’t argue either.  And when a slight bit of tension seemed to leave Mycroft’s body, Greg craned his neck to kiss Mycroft on the temple, counting it as a win.
“Yeah, I can see that,” Sherlock said, smirking, glancing down to asses the puddle.
Sherlock shook his head as John wiped tears from his cheeks with his thumbs.
“Listen to me, kiddo,” Greg said, walking back into the room and setting Bunny down on the end of the bed so that he could sit beside him and ensure he knew Greg was serious about his choice of words.  “It’s important that you pay attention to how you’re feeling.  Are you feeling like Papa and Daddy’s little girl, right now?”
is some time away from you!” Sherlock sneered, reaching to unbuckle his seatbelt and climbing into the backseat, his long limbs jostling Mycroft as he kneeled on the center console to throw himself as far from Mycroft as was possible in the car.
“I didn’t push him,” Sherlock said, fists clenched at his sides as he stopped where Mycroft was pointing.  “He’s a little lying crybaby.”
Bunny’s eyes were filling with tears once more--the kid's fear of failing authority figures was just one more sign of his abandonment issues--but the kid nodded.
Bunny’s eyes widened and Mycroft thought he saw a hint of a smile in the corner of the kid’s mouth.
Bunny nodded immediately, cheeks reddening.  Uncle Greg seemed to catch on to what the others already knew, clucking his tongue in understanding.
“One more question, bud,” he said.  “Did you fib just now when you told me you went potty? Because, if I’m not mistaken, you’re wearing a rather full pull-up right now.”
“We’ll see, little one,” Greg said as he doled out toothpaste to first Bunny and then Sherlock’s toothbrush.  “Clean your teeth.”
He guessed that Sherlock had been asleep for roughly forty-five minutes by the time he heard movement in the lake house which signaled Greg and John had returned from the store.  Because the porch slider behind him was open, Mycroft could hear the front door open and then quick, heavy footsteps on the wooden staircase leading to the second floor.  He craned his neck, curious as to who was running in the house, and saw a flustered Greg, arms laden with shopping bags, walking into the kitchen.
He was wiggling about frantically, too focused on pushing Papa away and rutting into his wet diaper in his attempt to hold in his wee to realize he would be in big trouble for hitting and kicking.
Sherlock shrugged and turned his face against Mycroft’s shoulder.
And  because they were no longer young, because they needed each other in that moment for a different type of comfort, John’s lips were on Sherlock’s and Sherlock’s hand had found its way onto John’s inner thigh.
“Sherlock, bud, how would you feel if I were Bunny’s Daddy?” Mycroft asked.
“John took Mycroft,” Sherlock mumbled, fresh tears brought up as Greg rubbed his back.
Mycroft made his way to Sherlock’s bedroom off the kitchen, his brother trailing behind.  The room was dimly lit, only the bedside table illuminating the small space, but Mycroft could make out the form of Bunny huddled just inside the closet on the far side of the bed.  He placed his bag onto the end of the bed and stepped closer.
Greg nodded, understanding the kid’s fears.
While his eyes were closed it was easy enough to envision himself sitting on the loo at home while he peed, but the spreading warmth in his briefs and jeans kept him from forgetting that he was in Papa’s car, and a blush spread to his cheeks as liquid began spreading.
“It’s not best to come out with it all?” Greg asked, skeptical.  “Be upfront? He’s not actually a child, anymore, Mycroft.”
“Bun, let me help you,” he said.
Greg had gotten Bunny to bed and asleep after little more than a sippy cup of warm milk and a storybook.  He sat on the edge of the boy’s bed for a few moments after he’d dozed off, knowing the boy wasn’t feeling well and rubbing his back to ensure he fell into a deep, lasting sleep before standing from the bed.  He left the boy alone, leaving the door cracked open and flicking on the moon-shaped nightlight.
John moved into damage-control mode, explaining to Sherlock each step of what they were going to do in the same way he might had he met an injured man in Afghanistan during battle.
Mycroft glanced down at his kid with what, for Mycroft, qualified as over-exaggerated shock.
Thankfully, Bunny did not protest against being cleaned up with wipes and dressed in a fresh pull-up and nightgown.  The new nightgown was long-sleeved with ruffled shoulders, a blue flannel covered in stars that Greg hoped would keep the boy warm enough.  He carried the boy to the bathroom, where he sat him on the edge of the sink and poured out a new dose of medication which the boy drank down without any fuss.
Sherlock straightened his arms by his sides and gripped the seat of his chair.
“Mycroft?” he asked.
Bunny sighed, but relented.
“John,” Greg said, stepping close to place a hand on the man’s shoulder.  “Why don't you stay?  We can talk later, once the pirate's gone up to bed.  Mycroft will explain, and we'll make a plan.”
Bunny giggled and nodded as Mycroft handed Greg the new flannel nightgown--yellow with a fuzzy bunny on the chest.  He was grateful the boy was too tired to question the pull-up Mycroft helped him into, and things felt a bit back to normal once they had a clean, sleepy kiddo in his nightgown lifted back into a smiling Greg’s arms.
“Let’s get your teeth cleaned, kiddo,” Greg said, reaching down to lift Sherlock from Mycroft in an attempt to give the man a bit of a break.
It wasn’t fair.  Mycroft and Papa hadn’t told him that girl Bunny would be different from boy Bunny.  They hadn’t explained that there was more to accepting girl Bunny than just being nice and not teasing her if she wanted to wear sparkly clothes or play with mermaids.
“Hey, hey,” John said, reaching forward to pull Sherlock’s arms down towards his body before he could destroy the other puzzles he'd completed as well.  “That's enough, love.  Calm down.”
The rocking motion was soothing, causing Sherlock to feel sleepy and content, farther away from his doubts and self-inflicted shame.  Maybe he could be smaller; it would certainly be nice to be taken care of while he was feeling so congested and achy.  He felt less on-edge when he thought about slipping down further, less frustrated and liable to lash out.
He wasn’t sure Sherlock would go for it, wasn’t sure he would even be able to follow his own suggestion, but the day had been emotional enough that John was desperate to cut himself and Sherlock a bit of slack.  They’d fucked up, but tomorrow was another day.
Sherlock focused on the melody his brother was humming, letting it slowly calm him as he followed its notes.  Eventually, he no longer felt such a heavy weight on his chest, and he could breathe normally once more.  He slipped his thumb into his mouth and rested his ear against Mycroft’s, feeling the vibrations of his chest as he continued to hum.
“I don’t owe him anything,” Sherlock said with a shrug.
Sherlock tended to glare and even become angry when Mycroft used pet names.  He’d grown to put up with “buddy,” “kiddo,” or “‘Lock,” when they were ageplaying, the terms Mycroft had used even when they were children, but, unlike John, who could not get enough of cutesy names, Sherlock’s desire to be a big kid kept him from accepting anything he deemed too babyish.  When he sunk this little, however, Sherlock was too wrapped up in his desire for comfort to worry about what he was called, and Mycroft could not help but take advantage of the opportunity to coddle and love.  It was generally the only time Sherlock accepted affection.  Mycroft had called Sherlock "string bean" when they were kids as a form of teasing, especially during the boy's most awkward growth-spurts.  But, over the years, it had become an endearment.
“You’re blushing,” Sherlock teased, one corner of his mouth turned up in a pleased-with-himself smirk.
“Want some juice or a snack?” Greg asked as if the idea had just occurred to him.
Mycroft patted Sherlock’s rear.  “Go use the loo and then let’s sit down and have some lunch before John has to go to work and we put you down for a nap, okay, bud?”
All told, John was most confused about the statements Mycroft had made about Sherlock’s wetting, the way in which he spoke so nonchalantly about Sherlock’s frequent accidents, the way in which he seemed perplexed that John hadn’t already seen it happen to Sherlock when the man was out of headspace.
Sherlock was too absorbed in building and listening to the telly in the background to do anything more than hum a response.  But Mycroft had too much experience to categorize the noise as acknowledgement.
John went about his day with one eye trained on Sherlock.  The consulting detective had not moved from his spot curled in his armchair since Mycroft had left.  He vacillated between bursts of activity whereby he typed furiously on his mobile and muttered to himself over what he felt to be idiotic suggestions from imbecilic simpletons and long stretches of time when he sat, still and silent, staring off into the distance.  John had let him be, not feeling it was his place to question Sherlock's actions unless they became injurious in some way; he wasn’t exactly an expert at coping mechanisms, himself, as Mycroft had so underhandedly pointed out that morning.
John sighed as he tugged a t-shirt over his head, then, once fully dressed, crossed the room to close the bedroom door.
"Is Sherlock the little brother, today, Daddy?" Bunny whispered, having approached.
“I’m not a baby,” Bunny whispered.
“That is not an inaccurate statement,” Mycroft relented, proceeding with bluntness as a way to meet Sherlock’s half-adult mind.  “There were matters which drew my attention away from you for a time, yes.”
“I didn’t like that she wasn’t letting me be better and letting me choose the games like usual,” he said.
“We get to swim?” Sherlock asked, Bunny close behind.
His mum wiped her hands on a dishtowel before stepping close.  She reached to place a hand on top of Greg's, which were folded and resting on the countertop.
“Don’t pretend you don’t love it,” he said, and Sherlock hummed noncommittally.
“Yes, sweet boy.  Remember how we talked about your brother feeling very little today?  He’s just a bit too little to remember to use the potty, so I asked Uncle Greg to buy him some diapers.”
John could not help but blush at being spoken to like a child, but his smaller side was not far away, and it was as grateful for the praise as his adult side was embarrassed.
“Of course, lady bug,” he said.  “We’ll plan for another weekend just as soon as we can, okay?”
Sherlock pouted and dissolved into a tearful coughing fit.
There was a moment of quiet that Greg worried Mycroft would break by asking him to leave the lake house altogether, a moment when Greg worried his mistake would cause a tear in their relationship too large to mend without extensive time.  Greg had always known Sherlock came first.  It was one of the reasons he loved Mycroft; the detached, seemingly cold-hearted man would do anything for his little brother.  But he had never thought about what might happen were Mycroft to be forced to choose between him and Sherlock.
Sending you all love--be kind to yourselves!
“Okay, kiddo, let’s get you sorted,” he said as he turned off the car and took the key out of the ignition.  He pulled on his jacket—he’d shrugged it off when he was too warm from the heat he’d cranked up for the boy—then stepped out of the car and pulled open the back door.  Bunny had a hand pressed between his legs, which he pulled away when Greg was in view.
John nodded, squirming in the wet spot he had made and wiping at his eyes with the backs of his hands.  He had not yet started to cry, but he felt as if he might.  “Want to talk to him,” he said.
“It’s for girls,” he mumbled, turning away.
He ran a hand over his eyes as he fell back against the pillow.  They were just dreams.  Even his childhood nightmares of monsters and goblins had been easier to get over than the dreams spurred on by his PTSD.  Why did they have to make him feel so shaken, so frightened?  Why did they always make him long to be little?
Official warnings: omorashi, holding/wetting, mutual masturbation, praise kink
John chuckled, and reached out to cup Sherlock’s cheek.  At least the boy was being honest and expressing his feelings.  John could not help but be bolstered in his self-confident little girl side as Sherlock’s biases against not being the alpha were laid out.  A little challenge might be good for Sherlock, may allow him to realize that he was not always going to be in charge.
Sherlock had known for quite some time that there were some days when Bunny just wanted to be a little girl.  Now, Bunny had finally been honest and brave, and Mycroft and Uncle Greg had listened.  They were going to make him their princess.
"Okay," Greg said, vowing to speak with Mycroft about what he might have heard and find the correct way to bring up the issue with their Bunny.
John took a breath, allowing himself to seriously consider the question for the first time since Greg had ushered him away from the crime scene.
“I need you to go back to Baker street,” Sherlock had said when the plane landed.  “I’ll text with further instructions when you’re there.”
“Should I get Mycroft?” Sherlock asked.
But Bunny yanked his hand from Greg’s grasp and crossed his arms over his chest.
Mycroft was seated on the edge of the bed, and John tried not to focus on the awkwardness he felt now that the morning was shedding light on the events of the night before.  He had fallen out of headspace but had still allowed himself to be bathed and brought to bed by Mycroft.  He had fallen out of headspace but had still asked to be dressed in a--thankfully, still dry--pull-up.  Mycroft had seen him have a panic attack, and John had let him rub his back until he’d fallen back to sleep.  John was slowly learning not to be embarrassed by what happened during ageplay sessions, but there was no way he could forgive himself for the childish behavior he’d exhibited while fully adult.
Sending bunny kisses :)
have an accident, he was
“Okay," Mycroft said, voice light, obviously humoring Sherlock as it seemed to be entertaining both him and Uncle Greg.  "Who should Uncle Greg be if not Uncle Greg?”
“What do you say we get you home?” Mycroft asked after some time.
“I...I can’t…” John was flustered.
“Bunny,” Daddy warned, and he wrapped a hand around Bunny’s arm to pull him gently back into a seated position.
By the time Greg got the boy settled into a full bathtub, he was so impressed with Sherlock’s compliance that he conceded and retrieved a few plastic shark toys from beneath the sink.
Mycroft put down his newspaper and exchanged a look with Greg, who was finishing up the French toast and scrambled eggs in the kitchen, before turning to address his brother.  John was at the kitchen table as well, and he dropped his head into his hands.  It was not only becoming clear that John had most likely had his own Sherlock concerns to deal with the night before, but that he was currently nursing a horrible headache.
“I’m not sure they have that one in your size,” he said, nodding towards the nightgown in the girls’ section, “But let’s say we see what they have that would fit, okay?”
“My brothers built it when I was seven,” Greg said, leaning into the treehouse from where he stood with both hands on the door frame, startling John from the close attention he had been paying to some old school textbooks and records--waterlogged and falling apart--that he’d found in the far corner.
“Close your eyes,” Papa said, and Bunny giggled but obeyed.  “Hold out your hands.”
Mycroft ruffled his hair and then patted his cheek, smiling down at him.
When an hour and a half had passed and the next train let off eager riders who were quickly ushered into another string of waiting cars, John called Harry for the third time, and again received no answer.  He should have let precedent guide him and asked Harry to send along her new address; at least then he could have found a cab instead of waiting, helplessly.
“I think you know what you did wrong, Bunny,” Mycroft said.  “It was very wrong of you to wander away from Uncle Greg when you were in the store and to disobey him.  You scared Uncle Greg very much and you put yourself in danger by breaking the rules.”
"Mycroft is John's daddy?" he breathed.
“I’m sorry you’ve had such a tough morning, Bun,” he said.  “Can Daddy help make it better?”
“How’s my little princess this morning?” Papa asked.
Greg backed away and seemed a bit surprised by John’s outburst, but he smiled, obviously trying to hide his confusion over the reaction.
Papa’s voice was shocked and frustrated.  A far cry from Mycroft’s most degrading tones, but at least well removed from his own generally calm, supportive demeanor.
“Not a problem,” Greg said, smiling in encouragement.  “Would you like to be Papa and Daddy’s princess tonight?”
“You think, or you know?” he asked, raising an eyebrows as he glanced down at the boy’s upturned face.
“Want to put them down here?” Greg asked, voice low as Bunny’s rested his head on his shoulder and Greg rested his hand on the back of Bunny’s head.  “Or take them back to yours?”
“Okay,” John nodded, and Sherlock, pouting, sighed and agreed.
Mycroft was concerned.  While Sherlock often wet himself--in bed, while playing, at the dinner table, for fun or for spite, even when he was not in headspace--John never had.  Although he was clearly younger in head space than Sherlock, the younger brother every time, he had never had the type of toileting troubles that had always been a pattern and a problem for Sherlock.
In mere moments, the kids were tucked into their beds with stuffies and baby blankets and pacifiers, night lights were lit, and foreheads were kissed.  It had been a long, tiresome day, and Greg took Mycroft’s hand to lead him down the hallway to their bedroom.
“Tired, Papa,” Sherlock mumbled, eyes blinking open when Greg was nearly finished.
Hope everyone is doing well :)
“You don’t have to take anything out of it if you don’t want to,” Greg explained, remaining as calm as possible as he turned onto the road, contrasting John’s building frustration in a tactic he generally reserved for the more volatile Sherlock.  “It’s there just in case.”
Sherlock huffed, then pushed his stuffed alligator between his legs.  He always had to wee badly when he woke up, and he knew he should get out of bed and use the potty like a big boy.  But gyrating on the plush toy and the bulk of his already-wet diaper made his tummy feel fluttery in a good way, and he wasn’t exactly in the mood to behave like a cooperating, easy kid that morning.
It was a relief that some of the tension had left Sherlock’s neck and shoulders over the course of the meal, but as John stood to clear the dishes, he could sense that the man’s now unoccupied mind was racing once more.  Sherlock was playing along with John’s current whim, acknowledging the roles they sometimes shifted into.  But he was still more adult than anything, and clearly a bit unmoored.  John needed to give him direction, reassurances that he would not be left to his own devices, if he wanted to help the man settle down in age.
Mycroft shook his head and began fishing in his pocket for his house keys.
“There’s a chart for each of you,” Papa was explaining.  Each was labelled with times of the day: morning, afternoon, dinnertime, bedtime, and nighttime   “You’ll get to choose a sticker every time you use the potty like big boys.”
“Do you need the loo, lad?” he asked, standing to approach John.
You've all been so kind with your comments and kudos--I really appreciate them!
“There’s always more,” Mycroft said,  “where family is concerned.”
John nodded, a bit too over-eager for Mycroft not to notice something off.
Bunny no longer seemed as upbeat as he had a moment ago.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, smiling crookedly.  “Maybe I’ll write a blog on the subject.”
He'd never planned to let himself go this far, had always been able to retain a sense of his rational adult self.  Now, after only a short time of ageplaying, he’d taken things to the extreme by shifting genders while in headspace, causing pandemonium not only for himself as he attempted to swallow the shame his adult mind--still under the effects of his father--could not help but feel.  But, what was worse, he'd uprooted the ageplay dynamics for Sherlock and Mycroft, who were now forced to reconcile themselves to the fact that John was uncovering a new identity.
“Bunny.  He’s a meanie.”
Sherlock blushed but nodded, leaning into his Mycroft’s warm touch.
“Yes, you were aged up at the time, kiddo,” Daddy said, eyes softening a bit.  “But that doesn’t excuse the behavior.  Not only did you choose to self-soothe by over-consuming alcohol, but you placed yourself into a rather reckless situation.  You’re lucky you weren’t seriously injured.”
“Yeah-huh,” John sniffled.  “He’s taking good care of me.”
Mycroft and Sherlock arrived home as Greg flipped absentmindedly through the channels on the telly in the living room, yawning.  He was exhausted; it had been a long day and a particularly busy few weeks.  But he had not wanted to go to sleep after Mycroft had texted to let him know he was on his way with Sherlock.  He would wait up and make sure all was well first.
"Sherlock," Mycroft warned.
Sherlock obeyed, but turned his face into Mycroft’s lap with a whine.
17 hours, 25 minutes and 22 seconds.
Sherlock nodded and blinked his eyes open once more.
He stood and cleared his throat, crossing out of the bathroom and across the main room to the opened doorway.  He needed fresh air.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tell me what you need now,” Mycroft said, prompting the boy.
“I know, kid,” Mycroft said, reaching and gently guiding John, who was too emotionally drained to do anything but comply, back towards him.  “That doesn’t matter.”
Sherlock found himself settling once the front door had closed and he was alone with his big brother.  As comfortable as he had grown ageplaying with Bunny and Papa, there was nothing like the history and comfort found in the quiet moments he shared with Mycroft.  Greg had gotten skilled at understanding Sherlock, at finding ways to allow him to accept care and attention, and John had learned to support him whether small or big, but it was Mycroft who read Sherlock’s needs at his most difficult.
“Papa?” he asked, and Greg hummed to signal that he was listening.
Bunny woke with a gasp, the swirling remnants of a nightmare casting a haze of fallen men, flashing lights glinting on sharp objects, and muddy, trampled fields into the darkness of his bedroom.  He could hear rain through the half-opened bedroom window, and fumbled beneath the sheets until he found Willa and pulled her into his arms.  The bedroom was dark and claustrophobic—Papa and Daddy has forgotten to turn on the nightlight by the door, and his heart beat fast in his throat as he gasped and willed away the heaviness in his chest.  His breath was ragged with uncertainty as his eyes filled with tears and blurred the still-looming images of a battlefield thick with blood.
“It was nothing more than jealousy,” Sherlock said again, voice stern, and John smiled in relief.
“I’m proud of you, Sherlock,” Mycroft said once Mycroft had given his driver instructions to take him home and he and Sherlock were snuggled together in the back seat, comfortably on their way across the city.
“Little bunny’s got a paci,” Sherlock said, clearly confused, and Mycroft could see John tense up in anticipation of negative namecalling from Sherlock.
Greg chuckled at the boy’s earnestness, but had been thinking just a moment before that the boy really had made strides in playing well with others and allowing others to be themselves over the course of the weekend.  Sherlock’s growing desire to be a good big brother was endearing.
This chapter is a bit different from previous ones because it does explore the sexual relationship between Sherlock and John, but it felt necessary given some of the issues they're still working through after Weekend.  Hope you like it!
“John, we have to go,” Greg called as he grabbed his mobile from the bureau and stepped into the hallway.
All of that said, the sexual elements of the story are rather minor in my mind (you could probably miss them if you weren't looking for them), so hopefully they don't keep anyone from reading.   I'll be interested to hear what you all think and will use your thoughts to inform the direction John's character will take in future updates.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said.
“I assume here is where you advise I go talk to Mycroft,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock nodded.
while passing out presents, well, no one had to know.
“Still a big boy,” he mumbled around the plastic nipple.
“Feeling a bit non-verbal, then?” he asked, and John shrugged again.
“It was a tough day for him,” Mycroft explained.  “But he’s okay now.”
“Come on, ladybug,” Greg said, voice a bit louder now in an effort to rouse John more awake.  “Let’s get you into the car so we can get you to my brother’s for a proper night’s sleep.”
“Everything with Anderson settled, then?” Mycroft asked from his spot behind the counter as he passed Greg a wine glass and began to pour.
“Bunny was screaming,” Sherlock said.  “I woke up too fast and got scared.”
“Thanks,” Mycroft said.  “I’ve got it from here.”
“You need to realize how your behavior impacts those around you,” Mycroft said, pausing for a moment while Sherlock twisted his neck to glance up at him.
“Would you like to talk about it now or later, bud?” Greg asked.  “Because a conversation is over due.”
Greg could not help but be taken aback.  He paused, watching as she continued moving around the kitchen as if it were a normal occurrence to send a grown man to nap.
“Hey, buddy, don’t cry,” Greg said, reaching to place a hand on Sherlock’s cheek.  “Tell Papa what’s wrong.”
“Oh, princess,” Papa said, coming around the table to squat down next to where Bunny sat.  “You need to stay here to get over that cold of yours.  Besides, I’m sure your Daddy could use some help from a big kid like you to take care of Sherlock today.”
He knew he should be quiet, knew that Sherlock was a light sleeper.  But he also knew that he was tired of being alone and tired of being big, and at the moment that seemed more important than his fear of potentially being yelled at by Sherlock for wetting his bed.  If he couldn’t have his Daddy, at least he might be able to have his big brother.
Sherlock sniffled and rubbed his eyes against his forearm.
“I’ve been wondering what impact the weekend will have on their relationship,” he said, and Mycroft nodded, reaching for Greg’s hand in a rare initiation of contact.
John started to cry, something somewhat rare for John while in headspace and admittedly usually tied to embarrassment.  He said nothing but he did nod as he squeezed his legs together and reached down to press against the front of his pull-up, feeling another spurt of wetness escape him.
Mycroft sighed, but was the one who went to Sherlock.
“It doesn’t work that way, love,” John said.  “If you love Bunny, you have to accept her for who she is, no matter what.”
Sending you all holiday wishes and Snow Bunny kisses.  Love to those of you who have family to celebrate the holidays with but especially to those who don't--please know you're not alone and I for one am sending you positive vibes!
“Meaning it’s not the presence of a woman but the presence of a...a young girl that he somehow believes dangerous.” he said, nodding.
Bunny gave a slight, barely perceptible nod.
Greg stopped tickling and stepped aside to let the little one hurry to the toilet.  He helped Bunny down with his pajamas and dry pull-up, and the boy took a seat and began to pee.
“I can do it myself, though,” he said, as vehemently independent as he had been all day.  “I don’t want Papa to come in with me.”
“They’ve planned something,” Mycroft said, voice low to keep Sherlock, around the corner in the kitchen, from overhearing.  “John’s pretending to be young.”
They glanced to the doorway to find Sherlock standing in his undersized pajamas, clutching Dimitri the dinosaur beneath one arm and knuckling at his eyes.
And so it was no surprise that Sherlock, rather than admit to Mycroft that he felt betrayed by learning of his new role as John’s Daddy, rather than hold up his half of the adult conversation he assumed Mycroft wanted to have, had fallen stubbornly into headspace by the time Mycroft entered the kitchen.
He sighed, knowing he may very well have Mycroft to answer to later if things went south.
“Just thinking about how silly your Daddy is, sometimes, love,” he said.
The chapters of this story are, as I said earlier, primarily already written, but I am doing some brief edits while I go.  So, if you have anything you'd like to see while Lestrade babysits the little Bunny, let me know!  This chapter features a new development to the John/Mycroft dynamic that I'm anticipating might have a polarizing effect--I'm interested to hear your thoughts.
“Okay, we have a few decisions to make,” Mycroft began.  “First, you need to decide if you’d like to be little for Christmas.”
Sherlock’s face fell when he looked up at John.
Sherlock scoffed.
It was Greg who noticed him first, glancing up from his corner of the puzzle on the far side of the kitchen table when Sherlock entered the room.  Mycroft noticed Greg’s shift in attention and turned around in his chair to face his brother.  Both men were clearly contemplating Sherlock, gauging his current state of mind.  Sherlock, now adult, could not help but feel a bit embarrassed by his earlier behavior--tantrums and all.
“Go home, My?” Sherlock asked, and once again Mycroft could see that this was not all little Sherlock; there was the hint of the adult here, well-aware at his attempts at manipulation.
It's been so long, loves! I apologize!  I was travelling, which was wonderful, but didn't give me any time to write.  Hopefully I can make up for that over the next few weeks.
“What do you say, Uncle Greg?” Mycroft asked, smiling.  “Do you think our boy has been punished enough?”
“Good,” John said when Sherlock slurped the last of the soup from John’s bowl, and Sherlock--not nearly young enough to put up with John’s praise--rolled his eyes, squirming in his seat.
Sherlock shook his head.
It's been a tough week and a particularly tough day.  I needed the cuteness, and I hope the fluff in this chapter can bring some smiles and happiness to all of you lovelies, as well.  Thank you all for your kind, kind comments--they mean so much.
Mycroft nodded, not bothering to mask the fact that he was scanning to read John’s body language.  John tried to stand up taller, tried to keep eye contact for longer than fleeting seconds.
“I was afraid you wouldn’t like it,” John said quietly, unable to be anything except fully honest in the moment.  “I was afraid you would want me to stop being your little brother.”
“Yes, sweetheart.  You and I are going to head back to Baker street, just the two of us.  Papa will make some dinner and we can watch movies and maybe even bake cupcakes for dessert.  Would you like that?”
He didn't want it to be Christmas anymore.  He just wanted to go home.
He nodded and began sucking his thumb.  He could be little without Sherlock; Mycroft may not be close by, but he had made sure his little Bunny would be safe.
John released the breath he’d been holding, chest suddenly heaving as he took in air and attempted to steady his racing heartbeat.  He let himself fall back against the pillows, scrubbing a hand down his face to ground himself.
“Come here, kid,” he said, taking a seat on the edge of the bed, which he was not looking forward to changing the sheets on.  “We need to have a bit of a chat.”
“It was a matter of national importance,” he argued, resentful of Greg’s implications given that the man had also chosen work over their scheduled ageplay weekend.  “There was nothing to be done.”
An anxiety Greg hadn’t realized he was clinging to at long last began to settle.  Not only was Sherlock cleaned up and supervised, but Bunny was resting after the ordeals of his morning at the crime scene, and he had both boys in his arms.  There were questions to be answered about what was going on in the mind of each boy, solutions to find for problems Greg did not yet fully understand, and conversations to be had with the boys and with Mycroft.  For the moment, however, he knew they were safe, and that was paramount.
"And it developed from there?"
When Uncle Greg peeked into the bedroom and called to the boys, Sherlock’s first impulse was to whisper to Bunny to hide and to pull the sheets up over their heads.  Bunny seemed surprised and then giddy, and they clapped hands to their mouths to keep Uncle Greg from hearing their giggles.
Mycroft and Greg were downstairs in the kitchen of the lake house.  They were completing a jigsaw puzzle, and Sherlock had to bite his tongue against the little old lady quips he was tempted to make.
But John was intent on injuring, suddenly defending not the nameless family of the corpse on the bathroom floor, but his own family.  Anderson knew nothing about it; alcoholism was complicated, it couldn't be categorized in aphorisms.  His knuckles made contact with Anderson's cheekbone.  Anderson tried to fight back, throwing a punch which grazed John’s ear, but it was clear the man had never needed to defend himself physically before, and John soon sent the wiry man stumbling backwards with a pleasing crack as his head hit against the plaster.  He took pleasure in bloodying Anderson's nose with the next punch, and even more pleasure in the sight of the man cowering at the base of the wall, arms over his head for protection.
And finally, in the safety of the space and in the comfort of Papa, he cried.  He cried for his sister's thoughtlessness and for the stress of travelling.  He cried for nightmares of Mycroft and Sherlock and for the shame of his wet pants.  He cried for the warm family Greg had contrasting to the distant relations John barely knew any longer.  He cried because he'd never known the type of Christmas Greg's mother had given to them all and because of the guilt he felt over wishing he'd been raised in the Lestrade household.  But most of all, he cried because he wanted to be home, because there were too many worries to process at once.
And then:
“I’m sorry, Daddy,” Bunny said as Mycroft helped him into the dry purple and pink pull-up.
“Please My?” Sherlock asked, acting sweet and compliant either to atone for his naughtiness earlier in the day or to keep from being punished further for it.
Hi, loves!
Greg understood Sherlock’s need for some time, knew the boy was teetering closer to a younger headspace and would likely be yanked older if he was forced to process and explain.  A conversation would be had, but it could wait, if only for an hour or two.
By the time Mycroft had lifted Sherlock off of his lap and carried him into the bathroom to begin running a bath and stripping Sherlock of his wet things, Sherlock was all out of tears.  His head hurt, and his eyes stung, and he felt, more than anything, empty.  It was all too easy to sit back and let Mycroft bathe him, and he was too emotionally spent to care just how much he was being babied, even when Mycroft lay him down on the end of the bed in the master bedroom and taped him into a diaper.
Mycroft left to get what he needed downstairs, and Bunny began shifting from foot to foot as he waited for his Daddy to get back.
“Careful,” Greg said before John could crawl into the wet spot on the sheets.
John’s face fell.
He hesitated, wanting Papa more than anything but afraid of Papa’s big brother, who was taller even than Daddy and Sherlock and who had big, square shoulders and strong arms.  What if he didn’t like that John was small right now?  What if he teased or yelled or noticed that Bunny had wet his pants a little?
John shrugged, then nodded.  “It's the pull-ups,” he said.  “And my head hurts.  Didn’t get much sleep.”
“Okay, honey bun,” Mycroft said.  “You go climb into bed and Daddy will go get Willa and your blanket from upstairs.”
“—Dinosaurs, Papa,” Sherlock said.
He found the searched-for disc in a mismatched case and boorishly shoved it into the console.  He fished a controller out from a mess of tangled wires he’d neglected to put away neatly last time, then reached to turn on the telly.  He'd settled on an adventure quest, and sat cross-legged on the carpet as he waited for the home screen to load.  He took a certain pleasure in sitting closer to the telly than Mycroft or Papa liked.
“Would you prefer a pull-up or briefs?” Mycroft asked as he opened the top drawer of the bureau after gathering the other items of clothing.
Bunny could see that Daddy had also noticed how much bigger Sherlock was than last night.  He raised an eyebrow as Sherlock spoke, then glanced over at Bunny with a smile meant to encourage despite the negativity Sherlock was already bringing to their wake-up call.
Greg leaned over and kissed him on the forehead.
It was half an hour before John had settled Sherlock enough to be able to coax him to stand and allow himself to be led down the hall for what John hoped would be a calming bath.  The man’s tears had abated, but he continued to glance off into the distance as if the events of his childhood were playing on a screen just behind John’s shoulder, distracted and upset.  He continued to mumble to himself as he was bathed, telling half-comprehensible details from a time once believed forgotten.
He held his plush alligator beneath one arm and his plush dinosaur beneath the other as he ventured into the hallway and to the master bedroom.  Halfway there he shifted the alligator to the same arm as his Dino in order to leave a hand free so he could suck his thumb.  Mycroft had first seen Sherlock suck his thumb on a night he had gone to him to explain that his sheets were wet, and it had become part of the pattern: clean up, fresh clothes, and his thumb to comfort him while Mycroft rubbed his back.
“I need you to tell me why you were in timeout, kiddo,” Daddy said when Bunny was close.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide and although Bunny tried to stop him, he sat up in bed and threw the sheets away.
“Go away, Mycroft,” Sherlock spat, “We’re not young enough to deal with your tedious nit-picking.”  Mycroft ignored his brother’s snark and began busying himself around the room, tossing a bath towel to Sherlock and telling him to take a shower while he found his brother’s canvas overnight bag and placed it on the foot of the bed.
Greg sighed.  In the future he would make sure that he had not only back-up toys and comfort items for both boys in his car but also spare pull-ups.  However, at the moment there was nothing in the boot of his car but a spare tire and an emergency kit.
“I’d be blissfully unaware,” he said.  “And I wouldn’t have a bathroom cabinet full of pink diapers.”
But Bunny stopped him as he was turning toward the door.
John shrugged, and hugged Mycroft close.
The crying man pulled himself out from beneath the sheets, immediately sitting up, pulling his thumb from his mouth, and scrubbing at his tear-streaked face.
Mycroft sighed on the other end of the phone.
“Mycroft?” Sherlock called tentatively, but his voice was little more than a whisper, and the two men slept on.
“Little boys need some extra help, sometimes, and that’s okay.”  It was Greg’s way of reminding John that he’d just stated his desire to be little, his way of reinforcing what John already knew to be true: pull-ups could only help John to age down.
Years ago, his father had hit John when he found his sister’s dolls hidden under his bed.  They had been an old birthday present to his sister, but Harry hadn’t been the slightest bit interested in them, and they remained perched in the corner of her bedroom for months, untouched and unloved.  John took them.  He didn’t play with them, just hid them under his bed and sometimes lay on his stomach on the floor to look at them and whisper his secrets.
John's role in bringing such memories and potentially harmful ploys to fruition caused a low burn of guilt in his gut, and he sighed, regretting that he did not have the words to address Sherlock’s methods of avoidance or the clear-cut evidence to suggest to the man that Mycroft had not told them all that he knew.
“Ready for movie night, champ?” Greg asked, holding out a hand for Bunny.
“I guess he’s too naughty to have any of the grape juice I bought for him at the grocery, then,” Mycroft said, voice raised, catching a smirking John’s eye.  “And I guess he doesn’t want to solve the new puzzle I brought or play games this afternoon while I’m looking after him.”
Sherlock’s head was ducked as he traced the outlines of the treasure map on his duvet cover, but John could tell that he was processing, and thinking how to answer the question posed to him.
Mycroft lifted Sherlock from the bed and carried him through the doorway leading to Bunny’s room, where he sat in a rocking chair which had been placed in the corner.  Sherlock whined, arguing against being rocked like a baby, but Mycroft had a tight grip on him, and soon Sherlock was pressed against his brother’s chest as he rocked them back and forth again and again.
Sherlock fell against the back of his chair and clapped a hand over his smiling mouth, genuinely trying to stifle his giggles but not being entirely successful.  Mycroft glanced towards the staircase to ensure Bunny hadn’t been woken by Sherlock’s joyful outburst, but when it seemed they’d escaped waking her up, he looked back to his brother with a grin.
“But now John’s mad at me, too,” Sherlock said, jumbling all of his worries into one long stream-of-consciousness explanation.  “And you think I’m a bad boy, and so does Santa, and Papa will when you tell him how I acted, and even Dimitri’s never going to talk to me ever ever again!”
“Doing okay?” Greg asked when they found themselves alone in a quiet corner.
Sherlock slunk back down onto his pillow, head aching.
“Not a baby,” Sherlock repeated, quieter this time given the surprised glances he’d received after his little outburst.
“I want these ones, Papa,” the boy said, holding up a fistful of plasters.
Papa smiled down when they’d finished packing.
“I’m sorry,” he said with a sigh.  “That was uncalled for.”
“Let’s get you out of that yucky pull-up, sweetheart,” Mycroft said, pulling Bunny by the arm a bit closer to where he was kneeling in front of the tub.  Mycroft had rolled his shirtsleeves up past his elbows before turning on the faucet.
“Are you sure?” he asked, and he could have kicked himself for how young he sounded.
Mycroft was not surprised that John was once again reverting to sweetness and apologies; headspace gave the man a reprieve from the anger he was susceptible to when adult.  It must have been not only draining, but rather confusing, for the man to have been feeling reverberations of that anger throughout the morning.
Greg wet a towel in the bathroom and wandered back into Bunny’s room to scrub drying medication from the floorboards and to mop up urine from the puddle Bunny had left next to the dresser.  He stripped the boy’s bed quickly and deposited the wet sheets  into the laundry hamper.  He would re-make the bed with clean sheets and run both Sherlock and Bunny's wet sheets through the laundry tomorrow morning.  For now, he wanted nothing more than to get back to his own bed for some much-needed sleep.
“You just wet my bed,” Sherlock said, mirth bright in his eyes and in his flushed cheeks.
“Good choice, princess,” Greg said, and he could see his wide smile settled Bunny a bit.
“That’s enough, now,” he said, taking a breath and shifting to lift Sherlock’s head towards him, hands on either side of the man’s face.  “None of that was your fault.  You didn’t take him away, did you?  Didn’t lock him up?”
Baker street might also mean a chance for a bit of time to himself.  He had been becoming progressively emotionally drained as the case continued, a nasty case involving a serial killer and gruesome murders which they had been unable to stay ahead of.  John, caught up alongside the local law enforcement in the frenetic pace of the events as they unfolded, was left feeling helpless with little time to process his thoughts.  He also couldn’t help but notice that, within the past day or so, the helplessness had a secondary effect: he had caught himself feeling a bit young.  He’d been shoving the feeling aside because he knew he couldn’t slip until the case was completed.  Even then, Mycroft would still be abroad and not available for some time.
“Serves you right,” Sherlock said without glancing up from the newspaper spread over the table in front of him, obviously having deduced John’s plight.
John could not help but notice how small and vulnerable Sherlock looked in his child-like pajamas.  They were too short in the arms and legs for his long-limbed frame, which had the effect of making him look even more like a small child who had recently been through a growth spurt but still had an attachment to his now-too-small favorite pajamas.  Mycroft gave his brother a moment to finish the tears, and then gently guided him away from his chest so he could look at his tear-stained face.
“I have to go potty,” Bunny whispered around the pacifier.
Sherlock was standing in the kitchen when Mycroft turned, empty sippy cup in one hand and plush alligator in the other.  He looked confused, glancing back and forth between Mycroft and the chart in his hand.
Mycroft was forced to regain his footing, nearly knocked over by Bunny’s shifting weight.  He turned away from the wet bed and took the boy out of the room.
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow in turn and collapsed into the kitchen chair at the head of the table.  He picked up a puzzle piece and began half-heartedly attempting to place it in the correct spot.
Bunny was sent into a squealing excitement.  The younger boy dragged Sherlock out of his chair and to the fridge.  Then, thrusting the chosen sheet of stickers into his hands, told him to put his sticker on his chart.  Sherlock obeyed hesitantly, all too aware of the disheartened looks he was receiving from Mycroft and Papa, glances he was attempting to ignore as he peeled the sticker from its sheet and placed it off-centered in the first box of his chart.
Sherlock blinked up at Bunny with little understanding, but when he held out a fistful of colorful plastic animals, Bunny knew he was forgiven, and he helped Sherlock build walls and towers on top of which Bunny balanced lions and tigers and llamas.
Oh, also, I'll be responding to comments hopefully before the night is out, but don't have time immediately.
“So I’m not in trouble?” he asked, pulling at his bottom lip, voice a bit uncertain.
Sherlock hid it well, but Mycroft could see that drawing attention to his brother’s bladder had put the man on edge.  He hunched farther in his chair and began typing more rapidly on his phone.
“I might need some help slipping down again,” he said, and Mycroft took a seat back on the bed.
“I said get outta here,” the man barked, nodding down the street as he took a menacing step towards John.
“All right there, John?” Greg asked when he and Sherlock had covered what they needed to.  He caught John’s eye in the rearview mirror.
“That's good, smart boy,” Mycroft said, reaching to click off the bedside lamp at long last.
As Mycroft rocked them in the swing, he allowed himself to settle into the peacefulness of the environment around them.  The air was nice and the lake still, and even Mycroft himself was calmed by the gentle back and forth of the porch swing.  He ran his fingers along Sherlock’s back, and hummed, grateful that his kid’s tears had at last settled into steady breathing as Sherlock suckled on his pacifier.
Update: Edited 5/11 for what seemed a bit too harsh of a response from Mycroft initially.
“For you as well,” John said.  “I’d never want your relationship with Mycroft to suffer because of me.”
Daddy turned to Bunny and then to Sherlock, as if assessing which of the two should have the chance to choose.  Bunny pouted and looked up at his Daddy with his best pleading eyes.
Mycroft paused.  It was true Sherlock currently had a sister napping upstairs, not a brother, but the prospect of telling that to his younger brother suddenly caused a pit in his stomach.  His body stilled, and the smile was quickly dropped from his face.
Greg was more used to reading bedtime stories than he was used to coming up with stories on the spot, but he knew they were close to sleep, and a few drawn-out sentences would likely settle them.
Sherlock looked ready to cry once more, as if unable to fully process his emotions in the moment, but Mycroft could see that, on some level, the idea pleased the boy.  Sherlock nodded, even as a fresh wave of tears slid down his cheeks.  Mycroft hoped a change of scene might quell the kid’s teariness.  At any rate, fresh air and some sunshine couldn’t hurt.
“Perfectly understandable,” Mycroft said to encourage the man.  “Elaborate, please.”
Bunny knuckled at an eye and began twisting one of Willa’s soft ears between his fingers.
The tears were fat and fast, and he soon found himself not just crying, but blubbering, making guttural sounds in his throat as he threw his head back and sobbed.
Mycroft began to argue, but Greg held up a hand to silence him.
“I don’t think Sherlock has anything to worry about,” Greg said.  “Anderson’s too much of a Momma’s boy to be looking for a pair of grizzled Daddies.”
Mycroft poured juice which he diluted with water--Greg was always joking that they were not real children and thus did not need their sugar intake monitored quite so closely, but Mycroft would hear none of it--into two sippy cups as Greg took the chicken from the oven and began slicing it into small pieces for the boys.  He passed the teal sippy cup to John, who held onto it but did not remove his pacifier to drink from it.  Mycroft knew the boy liked having things to hold, that it somehow comforted him, and that they might have a fussy boy when they tried to remove his pacifier and ask him to eat dinner.  Giving John the sippy cup early served to prepare the boy for having to remove his paci when dinner began.
Sherlock nodded, then pointed to the chart, which he made clear he wanted Mycroft to hang back up on the fridge.  Mycroft did so, albeit a bit reluctantly.
New update!  Thanks for your kudos and comments--they really do keep me inspired to write.  Let me know what you'd like to see during the weekend at the lake in the comments below!
Sherlock tore off the diaper he had been wearing--still dry, which Greg found interesting.  Maybe the boy was not feeling as young as he and Mycroft had assumed.  On the other hand, as soon as Greg pulled Bunny’s sweatpants down, he could clearly see the boy had wet his pull-up.  Bunny blushed and held his hands over his crotch as if trying to hide the sagging pull-up.  Greg saw his eyes glance to make sure Sherlock wasn’t peeking.  Luckily, the boy was busy pulling on his own swim suit.
Mycroft finished up cleaning the rug and stood from his kneeling position, knees cracking as he commented about being an old man, which made John giggle.
“Not exactly,” John said with a smile.  “You need to listen to her ideas and respect her opinions, but what do you think you could do if you don’t want to do what Bunny wants to do?”
But Sherlock was never easily swayed toward discussing his emotions.
“None of that, now,” John said, soothing Sherlock by running a hand through the curls on the back of his head. “You did all you could.  No one is cleverer than you.”
“You ignored me,” Sherlock said after Greg had led John out of the bedroom.
Hi Loves!  Thank you for all of your support and love!
Although they had been together all afternoon, they hadn’t had a spare moment for Greg to catch Mycroft up on the steps he’d taken towards mediating the situation that had occurred at the crime scene.  Greg had spent the afternoon texting Anderson and Donovan on behalf of John, popping in to help Mycroft keep the boys distracted and cared for whenever he had a spare moment.  He’d been taking calls from Anderson--and one from the chief inspector, who gratefully had not heard the exact details of John’s lashing out and was easily placated--to Mycroft's office.  Neither he nor Mycroft wanted to upset their little bunny back into the stress of the morning.
Mycroft rubbed his hand over Bunny’s hunched back, and, after sitting quietly for some time, was rewarded for his patience.  The boy turned beneath the blankets and poked his nose and one eye out from under the sheet to look up at Mycroft.  His face was a red-streaked mess of tears, and Mycroft could tell the boy was sucking his thumb.
He was placed back into nappies before long, his father insisting Sherlock clearly needed to decide for himself when the time was right, and thus began an on-again-off-again pattern of Sherlock alternating between pants and nappies until it became easiest just to leave him in pull-ups full-time.  Sherlock would use the loo when it was convenient for him and use his pull-ups when it wasn’t, and it simply became a known fact that the Holmes’ headstrong youngest son wore training nappies until far past the time it was deemed acceptable.
Below is a quick chapter that finally gives the beginnings of resolution to the angst our boy Sherlock has been feeling!
Bunny must have nodded, because Mycroft called him a good boy and then Bunny gasped and ran back upstairs.  His pattering footsteps returned only a moment later, and Sherlock heard voices once more.
“Take your plate to the sink, big boy,” Mycroft said with an amused laugh and a wink, and Bunny pushed his chair back from the table to do as he was told.
Greg raised his chin in realization, suddenly understanding exactly what had been going on in their littlest kiddo’s head since that morning.  The spanking had threatened his headspace, had challenged his ability to stay little.  Unlike Sherlock, for whom spankings led to lower headspaces, John had been pulled out of his little self by the harsh punishment.
“Carry me, too, Uncle Greg,” he said, and Sherlock liked the idea so much that he echoed Bunny’s request.
“But is that what happened?” he asked, wanting to establish a disconnect between the kid’s fears and the reality of the situation.  “Did they make fun?”
Sherlock looked back up to Greg for approval once more.  Mycroft was impressed.  It was clear Greg had had a very productive conversation with Sherlock, that he had gotten Sherlock to process the events of the afternoon in a way even Mycroft was unsure he would have been able to.
“My bag’s packed upstairs, Mycroft,” he said, running his forearm across his face.  He was currently big as well, then, and although affected by the alcohol, not nearly as irritable as Sherlock.
“No!” he shouted, voice loud and screeching, trying to reach for the remote in Daddy’s hand.  “Dinos now! Now!”
John tried to explain that he was sorry, tried to put to words all that he wanted Greg to know and all that he was still trying to process.  But words were hard, and he knew he would not be able to present himself as adult for much longer.  He needed to get out of view of the others, he needed to get away from the dead body in the bathroom that looked so much like his drunken father.
I'll be posting the beginning of a new story in this series soon.  The one I'll post is mainly focused on little John (who I'm recently obsessed with), but I know a lot of you are just as (if not moreso) interested in seeing Little Sherlock, so I'll do my best to have the next one I add focused on little 'Lock.
Greg smiled down at the boys, nodding.  He and Mycroft had been planning to let the boys swim as early as the first day they’d arrived at the beach house.  Chances to swim, canoe, and kayak were few and far between in the hustle of city-life, and they had chosen this particular lake house specifically for the convenience of its private lake access.  But bad weather, moody children, and unexpected situations requiring full attention had kept them from actually acting on their plans until now.  Mycroft hadn’t seemed particularly concerned, but Greg was determined to get the boys in the water before they left the lake house that evening.  With any luck, they could tire the boys out and get them to sleep on the ride back to London.
“No,” Bunny said as he felt his feet fall out from under him and found himself reaching to clutch the edge of the bathtub beside the toilet in order to stabilize himself, bare bottom exposed over his Daddy’s lap and tears falling even before the first smack.
His new Papa let him go, but reached forward to ruffle his hair.  Sherlock ducked his head but was unable to escape; it was only after whining that Mycroft rescued him by pulling him back into his lap.
“I’m going to earn more stars on the training chart than you,” Sherlock said with a wink.
He settled himself into his armchair, pulling out his mobile and beginning to type away.  Mycroft and John shared a look.
It was Mycroft who sent Greg and John downstairs to get started on breakfast, urging them away while he kept a keen watch on his misbehaving brother, whose nose was currently buried in the corner.  Sherlock was clearly at the beginning of what would be a long time-out, and Mycroft was settling down to take him in hand.
“Good boy,” he said.  “Go choose the next sticker you want for your chart, okay?”
“Are you sure you're okay with this, Bunny?” Mycroft asked. He knew very well that John was in an adult headspace at the moment, but he needed the jaded cynic that tended to characterize John to be dampened for a moment.
It was no secret that Mycroft had been feeling a fierce protectiveness over John since he’d been slipping down into his little Bunny headspace, a protectiveness spurred by the phone call he had received the night Greg had babysat John and built up by the conversation he had had with John the following morning.  His feelings for little John were of a different color than his feelings of brotherly love and of confident responsibility while caring for Sherlock.  John’s little space seemed to reveal a vulnerability within the doctor of the type Mycroft had not seen before, and he was endeared by the fact that John had begun calling him Daddy when they were alone.  John was just as fragile as Sherlock, but John had never had a protector in the way Sherlock always had in Mycroft; he needed care and looking after, but, more than anything, he needed healing.
Hopefully I'll have time to add a new chapter to Weekend at the Lake soon as well.  For now, hopefully this update will tide you all over!
“The big-shot London Detective Inspector returns!” A man who could only have been Greg’s father shouted, stepping from the crowd with his arms held out to both sides, commanding the entire room with his presence.
“I think so,” Bunny said, nodding.  She could not help but let her thumb slip into her mouth, feeling a bit younger and more unsure than she had a moment before.
The truth of the matter was that he’d been wanting to wet his new pull-up since Uncle Greg had first put it on him.  His original thought as he sat down at the lunch table was that he’d wait until he’d been put down for a nap, and then he’d wet it and pretend it had happened while he slept, as it often did to Sherlock.  But then he’d gotten upset and had run away from the table, and now he’d gone and asked his Daddy if he could wet himself, and he wanted more than anything to follow through.  He wanted to wet his butterfly pull-up while dressed in his Little Mermaid night shirt, like a real little girl or boy.
Sherlock had found himself embarrassingly enamored with the films, the little boy Mycroft had allowed him to be for most of the car ride not far from the surface as night settled around them in the living room.  If it hadn’t been for Mycroft’s well-timed clearing of the throat after Sherlock had actually giggled at a magical turn of events in the film, Sherlock may have failed completely in his desire to hide his little self from his parents.
“Donovan, it’s my day off,” Greg sighed, clearly exasperated before pausing to listen.  “Well, what about Dimmock?”
He’d wanted a bath, clean clothes, and to be allowed to go back to bed, where he could suck his pacifier and forget about the chaos of the morning and the seemingly endless tantrum Sherlock was throwing in the other room.  But Daddy did not run a bath, clearly having another plan for Bunny’s morning.
“What is it now, kiddo?” Mycroft asked, eyebrows raised.
Greg wrestled his nephews off of him by finding a few well-placed ticklish spots, then stood with a smirk, holding his hands out to either side of him as they tried to approach once more.
He fell into bed the moment they arrived at the master bedroom, and he was asleep before Mycroft had even turned out the lights.
“Uncle Greg, are you a monster?” He asked, and was glad when the man did not laugh.
“Alright there, princess?” Papa asked, tilting his head and catching John’s eye in the rear view mirror.
Also, I promise I haven't abandoned A Little Training.  I will get back to that story eventually--just having a lot of fun writing this one at the moment.
Hope you're all doing well--thank you greatly for your kudos and comments.  They keep me going :)
John resented Mycroft’s attempt to turn John’s betrayal into something admirable.  He hadn’t been protecting Sherlock; he’d been protecting himself, protecting the little Bunny within who was desperate for attention.
Mycroft hummed, lips pursed, but allowed John to lead him upstairs, for the moment turning his attention away from his disappointed frustration over John’s choice of coping mechanism in order to prepare himself for the conversation he needed to have with Sherlock.  It was rare Mycroft Holmes doubted, but when it came to his younger brother, he was particularly susceptible to second guessing.
“A little spoiling from time to time never hurt anyone,” his mum said, passing Greg a plate for the biscuit.
“It’s fine,” John said again.
Sherlock turned onto his other side, shifting so he was now facing Bunny.
John blushed beet red, and Sherlock leaned in closer to speak softly.
But now was not the time.  Sherlock was right.  Mycroft needed to keep himself from Daddy-mode.  He reached to turn up the radio and focused on the drive.
“Will you let me draw you a bath?” Mycroft asked.
“Promise you’ll be a good boy?” Mycroft asked, teasing the man as he figured anyone in comparison to Sherlock’s naughtiness would rank as ‘good.’
Mycroft sighed, knowing that Sherlock did not need the added pressure of worrying about keeping his pull-up dry on one of his down days but also knowing that denying the boy the chance had the possibility to send him into a further downward spiral in his beliefs of inadequacy.  Mycroft’s best course of action was to agree but keep a close eye on Sherlock to ensure the boy didn’t face the hit to his self-confidence that would inevitably come should an accident occur.
John had tried to be helpful at the crime scene, taking notes and posing questions.  But now that his bladder had made itself known, it continued to plague him while he worked, and his fear that he might piss himself made him irritable, prone to snapping at Sherlock and even Greg when he’d asked if he was alright.  John didn’t need Greg’s babying, and he certainly didn’t need Sherlock’s underhanded teasing regarding the coffee he’d had midday to keep himself alert.
“I’m going to wait right here, buddy,” Papa said, his voice close enough that Sherlock assumed he’d taken a seat on the ground close by.  “When you’re ready to come out, I’ll be here.”
Mycroft tore the sides of Sherlock’s wet pull-up and balled it up to dispose of it.
Soft light spilled beneath the base of the closet door, and Bunny could hear the man climb out of bed, floorboards squeaking as he walked towards his hiding place.  Sherlock’s voice was quieter when he next spoke, closer to the boy’s level, as if he were crouched down in front of the closet door.
He sighed, running a hand down his face in a show of exasperation.
“I’m not a baby!” Bunny said when he caught Daddy’s eye, face crumbling as he gave into the building tears.  “I just couldn’t hold it,” he mumbled.
Mycroft sat at the kitchen table with the bottle of sunscreen in hand and waited for Sherlock to come near.  The day had warmed significantly from that morning, which had earlier all the signs of a cool, cloudy day.  Now, there was sun shining through the windows, and although it was not exceedingly strong, Mycroft was cautious, had warned Greg that Sherlock sunburned easily when Greg suggested the boys spend the day in the lake.  Sherlock sighed dramatically.
Mycroft waited.  Sherlock, testing the boundaries, opened the sliding glass door a fraction of an inch, then glanced back towards Mycroft, who said nothing but raised an eyebrow.  Sherlock let his arms fall away from the door handle and down to his sides as he whined in the back of his throat and dragged his feet towards Mycroft, ever reluctant.
“Stay right there,” Mycroft instructed, and Bunny nodded.
“Tell me what you know,” Sherlock said once the tea had boiled and John had settled himself next to Sherlock at the table.
“With glitter stickers,” Bunny said, just realizing that maybe he’d have the chance to pick out the colors and the styles and the shapes.
John curled his hands into fists to hide the reddened, scabbing scrapes at the base of his palms, then raised one hand in surrender before crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair.
“Try to close your eyes and see if you can rest a bit,” Mycroft suggested.
“About what?” Mycroft prompted.
Bunny hesitated, then gave a small, miserable “okay” that was little more than a drawn-out sob.  Mycroft could not help but wonder if they had ever had a day full of so many breakdowns for both Sherlock and John.  It was rare both boys were so emotionally off at the same time.  Then again, this was the longest stretch of uninterrupted ageplay they had had in quite some time, and it was bound to lead to new emotions and conflicts for the boys.  He was distressed to see Bunny so upset, but there was also the relief that, over the course of the weekend at the lake, Bunny had become far less hesitant towards expressing his emotions.  Mycroft had seen John cry more often in the past three days than he had during months of ageplay previously.
“It is?” he asked.
“I don't have to wear them?” Bunny asked, and Mycroft grinned at the boy’s need to clarify once more.
Bunny blushed as Sherlock continued.
“I forgive you, champ,” he said, coming around to crouch down beside John for a hug.
It was as he climbed to his feet that he realized he’d wet himself, pull-up heavy and the seat of his pants wet from where it had leaked.  His face warmed.  He hadn’t even realized he’d needed to go.  Usually Mycroft reminded him.
Bunny sighed and lay his head on Mycroft’s shoulder once more.
Sherlock breathed hard through his nose, yanked his thumb out of his mouth, and turned to gather up his game controller once more.  He would forget about Mycroft and the old memories, forget about the bright gleam in Papa’s eye when he introduced the training chart, forget about the fear that Bunny would be better than him at the whole ordeal.  And he would forget about the squirmy feeling he’d been feeling at the base of his stomach, the feeling which meant his bladder was full.
Mycroft felt pained to hear that John had been crying but pleased that Sherlock had felt comfortable providing emotional comfort in his own way. John must have been more conflicted and upset by the day’s events than he had originally thought.
Whether Sherlock decided he was too hungover to be up for the task of caring for his regressed boyfriend in the middle of the night or whether he sensed that the boy needed his Daddy,  Bunny didn’t care.  All that mattered was that Sherlock stood, reached around the back of the closet door and into the pocket of his dressing gown, and pulled out his mobile.
“You think that’s funny, kid?” Mycroft asked, grabbing John by the side to tickle him.
“You’d never been to a sleepover before,” Mycroft said, sipping from a cup of tea he’d made for himself.  “I could tell you were nervous before leaving.”
“Do you think you’re ready to give a pacifier a try?”
Daddy thought it was best if the telly stayed off for the time being, so Bunny sat next to Sherlock on the floor, where the younger boy had returned to his earlier activity of building with colorful wooden blocks.  Sherlock glanced up at Bunny when he sat down, pirate pacifier lodged firmly into his mouth.
He rolled his eyes and sat back up in order to kick off the blankets, his cheeks flushed and his movements jerky, signalling his frustration.  Sherlock was far from an accommodating person even when he was feeling healthy; it was clear he would not be softening his approach now that he was sick.
It was only once he was out of 221b that Mycroft allowed himself to drop the facade of nonchalance.  Even then, he worried that his brother may notice his walk away through the window, so he allowed himself only a small moment of mourning for the particular piece of innocence he feared was lost from Sherlock forever, straightened his cuffs, opened his umbrella against the light drizzle, and stepped away with his shoulders held back.
“Okay, big boy,” Mycroft said.  “Is it okay if you put Uncle Greg on the phone so I can talk to him for a moment, love?  I’ll talk to you again after I speak with him, okay?”
Sherlock turned his face against the mattress while he came into the sopping pull-up with a shout.  John rubbed him through it, drawing mewling moans from the extended stimulation.  Sherlock at last collapsed against John, breathing heavy.
Mycroft nodded.
He forced himself to cross to the body, which was in the bathroom of the motel room, then crouched onto the dirty tiles to begin a cursory examination.
John cleared his throat and sat up straighter.  It was clear he was pulling himself back.
Sherlock groaned, and John stood gaping as he once more bent over, as if injured.  But this time one of Sherlock's hands found its way into his crotch, and he pressed down, like a child caught short waiting for the loo.
Greg paused again, then sighed and looked towards John, who had given up pretending he wasn’t listening.
He ignored rational thoughts that his friends were simply concerned about him and instead began to plan how he would tell Lestrade to leave, the words he would use to tell him to fuck off and stop interfering in his life.  John’s anger needed an outlet, and Lestrade was the only one available at the moment.
Bunny shrugged again, and new tears filled their eyes before they shook their head.
But Bunny grasped at Daddy’s arms when he was set on the floor, yelling unintelligibly about the creature, whom he anticipated was about to shoot a bony hand to grab him from beneath the bed.  He tried to scramble-climb up Daddy, but he held him back so he could look into his eyes with worry and continue to tell him to breathe and not to worry, clearly concerned.
“Good boy, 'Lock?” Mycroft said when he was alone in the kitchen with Sherlock.
His Daddy guided him away from his chest in order to lay a hand on his forehead and then against his cheek.
The man was aloof throughout the ride, on his mobile but otherwise still.  Greg knew John Watson, could read the worry in the man’s silence, the discomfort in the way he held himself.  If John was anything, he was an overthinker, particularly when it came to what he perceived as failings on his part.  There was no doubt in Greg’s mind that the kid had spent the better part of the drive re-playing the events of the past few days, cycling through the moments he perceived to be signs of weakness: calling Greg to pick him up from the train station, being put down for a nap by Greg’s mother, and especially finding himself face to face with Greg’s older brother, after a nightmare and near accident.
John turned back over his shoulder with eyebrows raised, but Sherlock was rolling his eyes towards the screen, unconscious of John’s attention.
Sherlock could feel the blush spreading across his cheeks when the attention was turned towards him.  Was Papa teasing him? Had he found out Sherlock had wet himself?  And why did he feel like crying when he was suddenly forced to remember the way his wee had puddled beneath him on the carpet?
“I can look peaceful and be adult,” John said, defensive.
“Let’s chat for a moment, shall we?”
“I need someone to help me pick out a little surprise for Sherlock to cheer him up today.  Do you think you could help me out with that?”
Sherlock was not fully young, not yet.  But the thought of Mycroft calling up Greg to relay Sherlock’s poor choices had his heart pounding and his eyes watering.  John and Mycroft were already annoyed with him; he didn’t want Papa to be, too.
“G’morning, champ,” Papa said, angling his head towards Sherlock, who was glaring up at him, face half-covered by a sheet.  Papa had lied to him.
Sherlock slumped a bit deeper against the pillows, and John shifted until his shoulder became a pillow for the taller man.  Although they’d been intimate since starting their relationship, age regression had made them comfortable with the type of casual touch neither had previously been used to; this sort of comfort in closeness was new, and welcome.
The blocks surrounding Baker Street were crowded, and John did his best to keep from stumbling into passing couples and groups.  His mind was muddled from the beer, and he had a hard time even recalling what day it was.  It must be the weekend, given the number of people out and about around the pubs.
Sherlock made a face but did not argue.  He did, however, bound out of the room and down the hallway, alligator clutched in his hand and pacifier bobbing in his mouth.  He knew he should probably have a plastic sheet on the bed, but that didn’t mean he had to help Uncle Greg put it on or be there to watch him place the babyish sheet on the bed.  He’d rather just pretend to be a big boy who didn’t need that.  He settled himself down in the living room, where he upended the bag of Legos Uncle Greg had brought in from the car and began building a pirate ship, one with lots of space for big boy pirates who fought and stole and went on adventures.
The moody kid he had been earlier that morning would have thrown a fit over Mycroft’s ministrations, but Sherlock no longer felt on edge or interested in causing trouble.   He was comforted by being back at his big brother’s flat, and the anger of the morning had dissipated.  The stressors of Baker Street and even the conversations he’d had with Mycroft regarding Red Beard had been left behind, at least for the moment, and Sherlock felt, more than anything, calm and content.
“You’ve called me nothing but ‘Mycroft’ all day,” he said, shifting back into confident caretaker.  “Do we need to discuss?”
“Okay, silly boy,” John said, reaching to tickle Sherlock’s sides and causing the boy to wriggle about his lap as he dissolved into giggles.  “I’ll tell her.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and groaned, but snatched the juice and granola bar from Papa’s hands before stomping towards the staircase in a dramatic show of displeasure.  He only stopped his stamping feet when Mycroft warned him he was close to losing his screen time privileges.
“Time to sleep,” John said when he finally released Sherlock from his tickling.  “It’s late.”
“Who’s ready to go swimming?” he asked.
Papa reached to pull him closer, shifting Sherlock until his upper body was cradled in Papa’s arms.  He continued to stroke Sherlock’s hair, steady and comforting.
It had been a trying day, and his worries over the potential backlash of Sherlock’s forgotten trauma had not been entirely assuaged.  But, for the moment, it was almost enough to know that those he cared for most in the world, the three men he would protect at any cost from harm and lurking demons and pain, were warm, peaceful, and--although Mycroft may never admit it outside of the world they’d created for themselves--truly, selflessly loved.
He breathed a bit more easily once he was hunched beneath the wooden desk, arms wrapped around the knees pressed to his chest.  He knew he would be found eventually, but his Daddy was currently dealing with Sherlock, and he likely wouldn’t expect Bunny to have wandered into the office; he may have quite a while before he needed to face reality and possible punishment for the little accident on the living room rug.  What was needed most of all was a minute alone to think and to breathe, and, for the moment, Bunny had that.
Mycroft had, with John’s permission, explained to Greg what John had admitted to after wetting himself at the zoo, that there was a part of him that had enjoyed it, that he was interested in exploring more.  It had calmed Greg a bit in the days following the zoo trip; he had been rather distraught over John’s accident at the zoo because he had felt responsible in many ways.  Mycroft had found it endearing how apologetic the man had been.  He had clearly been concerned that Mycroft would be angry, that he would interpret John's accident as a sign that Greg had neglected care for the boys in some way.  It also meant that Greg had been somewhat prepared when John subsequently wet himself the night they were alone and he was babysitting, which had been a plus as it had made for the least amount of stress on John's part.
“I can see why that would be scary,” Mycroft soothed.  “You’re right, buddy.  I should have checked in on you to make sure you were okay.  John was having a tough time, but so were you.  You deserve my attention, too.”
Despite what must have been doubt and worry, Bunny nodded his head.
John rubbed at his eyes, only feeling fully awake from the nap he had taken in the car as Mycroft carried him into a small, brightly colored bedroom and sat him down on the end of the bed which rested against the far wall, beneath windows looking out onto the lake.  He was still sleepy from having just woken up, and felt a bit overwhelmed by suddenly being somewhere new and unknown.
He hurried down a hallway covered in old paintings--Willa the rabbit and his bunny baby blanket clutched in his hand--and pulled open a door to find himself in what must have been Daddy’s office.  The room was large and ominous, with dark wood paneling on the walls and old schematics of airplanes hung on the walls behind shelves covered in antique globes.  An entire wall was covered in bookshelves filled with leather-bound books, many in what looked to be different languages.
