“Okay.” Cas smiled, and Dean thought he might melt into a puddle. It was a genuine, beautiful, smile, and Dean didn’t get to see it much. It was one of his favourite things in the world to look at.
“I’m so sorry, Cas.” He took a few steps closer. “For everything.” Those personal space rules were really thrown out the window now. Their faces were only a few inches apart.
He’d thought that the crush would eventually go away, but it only got worse as time went on and he and Dean became closer and closer. Dean’s just- not like how he wants people to think he is. He acts like this big tough guy all the time, but he’s quite the opposite. He’s scared of needles. And the only reason he has walls up is because he keeps getting his heart broken. The poor man has had way, way too much on his shoulders his whole life, and he has what is probably the worst job in the world, but he just keeps on going and doing the job because he’s him and that’s what he does. And he can be vulnerable, and he can get scared, but he never shows any of it. Cas only knew because he and Dean had been best friends for a long time. Dean probably thinks that if Cas knew everything about him, he wouldn’t like him anymore, but honestly, the more he learned about his best friend, the harder he fell for him.
“Never been surer about anything in my life.” Cas said, pulling Dean in for another kiss. “And that’s saying a lot.”
He looked up and saw Cas watching him speak, looking like he might cry. He went back to staring at his hands.
“Hmm?” Th angel sat up, and when Dean saw the shirt he was wearing, he completely froze for just long enough that the silence was uncomfortable.
Dean tried hard not to crack a smile thinking about that conversation. He cleared his throat loudly. “Charlie, are you here because you found that book I was looking for?”
It was a framed collage of photos of Dean and Cas throughout the time that they’d known each other, with hearts all over it. The frame was white, but it had red lettering on it that read
Later, Dean was in the library reading the paper, when he felt a pair of lips press against his neck. Cas was all touchy-feely today, and Dean liked it. “Hey, baby,” he said softly.
“Within the last five minutes, you managed to somehow get wine, spill it on your shirt, change into my shirt, get the movie set up, and then sit back down and put on a blanket?”
Dean came over to the door to see his brother. “Is something wrong?” He had a beer in one hand, and a throw pillow underneath the other. Behind him, Charlie was lying on his bed, on her stomach. She was leaning on her elbows, with her feet in the air, crossed over each other. She had a beer, too, and a pillow under her chest.
They locked eyes, and they both knew the answer was no. “Alright, I’ll go get us some beers, and I’ll be right back, ‘kay?”
“Yeah, but I ruined my shirt. That’s why I’m wearing this.” Castiel laughed awkwardly and pointed to Dean’s t-shirt.
an angel, but I just- you’re Cas, man. You’re my best friend. And I- I need you to know how I really feel about you, but, unlike you, I
“I’d like that. Do you want to watch that movie you love with the guns and the tuberculosis?” He paused, thinking about the name of the movie. “Tombstone?”
Dean leaned in, and his lips met Cas’. It was really awkward because of the angle, and the way they just grabbed onto each other, but it was so full of emotion, so full of love. Despite the weirdness and awkwardness of the kiss, Dean was certain that it was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was
“Okay.” He turned to Cas. “I’ll be right back, okay? I have to talk to Charlie for like two seconds.”
“Wow, that was one of the least smooth conversations I’ve ever heard in my life,” Charlie giggled, as Dean lay down next to her on his bed. His feet were in her face, but she didn’t really care, and the figured her feet were probably in his face, too.
Dean didn’t look like he believed that that was the only thing going on in Cas’ head, but all he said was, “Yeah, sitting around all day will do that to you.”
The next morning when Dean woke up, he smiled down at the floor next to the bed, where clothes were strewn all over. He picked up an AC-DC t-shirt and grinned at it. Last night had really happened.
he thought. He thought he’d never get rid of the dumb smile plastered across his face. There was a chance that this could work. That Dean could be in an actual, long-term relationship with the man he loves. Yeah, no way that smile was going anywhere.
Dean frowned at the loss of Cas’ touch. “Don’t worry about it. He’s at the store, and even if he comes back soon, my room is soundproof.”
“Where are you thinking?” Charlie asked. Dean looked over to see her taking a bite into an apple and smiling. Dean wondered if she’d been standing in the doorway this entire time.
“Mm, that’s true.” They stumbled towards Dean’s bedroom, not really caring about walking into walls or anything.
“Oh, I was just kidding, man. I thought you knew that. I’m so sorry.” She placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
They just sat there, looking at each other for a while. Cas’ eyes flicked between the hunter’s eyes and lips.
“God, Cas. So, when you were dying last year, and you said-” Dean stood up and started walking towards Cas.
She chuckled. “Fine, I’m just going to the bar. What did you call Valentine’s Day that one time? Unattached drifter Christmas? If I can’t score tonight, I simply cannot score.”
“You are…helpful, yes. It’s always good to have an angel on your side. But, the thing is… I don’t see you as an angel. I haven’t for a long time. I- I mean, like, I know that you
Cas pulled back and looked shocked for a second before smiling and nodding. “Yeah, okay.” He leaned in close so that his face was only a few inches away from Dean’s, but he didn’t kiss him yet. “I can’t promise I’ll stay in my own room too often, though.”
’s shirt, and Cas reached to take it off. When he pulled away to get the shirt off entirely, Dean stepped back for a second to meet his eyes. “Are you sure about this?”
Yeah, their faces were definitely closer than they were before. How, Cas had no idea. He didn’t think either of them had moved, but then again, he wasn’t paying much attention to anything but Dean’s eyes and mouth.
Once he was out of Dean’s sight, he leaned against the wall and sighed. “Ugh, now I actually have to go to the store,” He mumbled to himself.
“Yeah, I know. I really don’t know, Dean. We can just keep praying and keep thinking that everything happens for a reason.”
She left, and Dean was worried to be once again left alone with his thoughts. He walked out to the kitchen, and saw Castiel sitting at the table.
“Although you may be ‘all sorts of messed up’, I don’t think I’ve ever met a man- or anyone, for that matter, who is as good as you are. When I raised you from Hell, I didn’t really know why you needed to be saved, just that you did. But then, I got to know you. I realized how right you were, and how wrong heaven was. And so, I was more on your side. At first, I feared what heaven might do, but to be honest, when I was with you, a lot of the time, heaven was in the back of my mind. You were- you
He quickly got dressed in his clothes from the night before and tried to look as grumpy as he could. Normally, at this time of day, if Dean hadn’t had coffee yet he’d be ready shoot anybody who got between him and the coffee machine, and he wouldn’t say a word ‘til he’d gotten through his cup, but today was different. He felt like he could do freakin’ cartwheels… if he knew how and was much younger.
“I know. And that’s okay, Dean. If you’re not ready yet, I understand. And I’ve said this before. Not being ready yet is completely okay, but if you feel like you might be, I feel like you should go for it. I know I can’t give you perfect advice because nothing like this has ever happened to me before, but for some reason, I feel like this is the perfect time.”
He didn’t hit play. In fact, he didn’t move at all. It seemed like his face had gotten closer to Cas’, but why would that be happening?
Dean looked at him, his eyes full of concern. “Cas, I know that ‘I’m fine’ never actually means ‘I’m fine’.”
“…Maybe. Sorry, I spilled wine on my other shirt, and Sam’s doing laundry today, so I didn’t have anything else.”
He cleared his throat and rubbed his hands over his face. He looked down at his own hands as he fidgeted with them.
“Wh- you know what? Okay,” Dean said, shaking his head and smiling as if to say ‘Whatever you say, man’. He did that with Cas a lot.
“Hey, I’m your family. I’m just trying to do what’s best for you. And you know you wanna go make out with that angel.”
Dean went over to sit down on the bed in the same place as before they were interrupted. “Sorry about that, there was this book on lycanthropy that I lost earlier this week, and she found it and-“
The hunter turned around in his chair to look at Cas and saw his brother standing behind the angel, pretending to look disgusted, but failing miserably. He looked so happy and proud. Dean grinned at him. “Hiya, Sammy.”
Charlie was a good person, and she was normally pretty good about keeping this whole thing to herself. But, there were a few times Dean had caught her trying to trick him into admitting his feelings. She meant well, and she understood that Dean wasn’t ready yet, but she encouraged him to tell his best friend the truth. He could hear her voice in his head from a few months before.
Dean took a deep breath. “Okay, so, here’s the thing, Cas. I can’t stand the thought of you not knowing if I truly care about you or not. I understand why you feel how you do- I mean, I’m all sorts of messed up, and admittedly, there have been people that me and Sa- that
“Dean. I’m not stupid. I overheard you talking to Cas in the kitchen earlier. Do you really think I’m going to mess with you today?”
Dean looked over to see what the book was and laughed when he did. “Twilight? Yeah, trust me man, nobody does. Where did you even get that from?”
“Of course. As my thank you for finally having sex and saving me from those ridiculously awkward staring contests on cases.”
So that's it! I know that it wasn't that great but I'm pretty proud of myself for getting it done and actually posting it. Thanks for reading it!
“Well, it shouldn’t be.” He took the book out of his friend’s hand and put it on the counter, acting like it was disgusting to be touching it.
Cas turned around and glared at Dean.  The hunter was sitting across from him at the table in the front room. Dean was obviously upset about the conversation they’d been having. His eyebrows were furrowed, and his lips were pursed, and he was leaning towards Cas a bit. “And why not?!”
When Dean woke up the next morning, he smiled when he saw Castiel lying next to him. He turned on his side to face the angel. “Did you watch me sleep all night?”
Cas looked freaking incredible. His hair was all messy, and the t-shirt- God, he looked good in a t-shirt. Especially because it was
“Honestly, I don’t know. But I gotta say, Charlie, I see him sometimes and it just makes me feel like I’m gonna throw up. But- like, not in a bad way.” He sighed. “Does that even make sense?”
“Here, man,” Sam said. “Cas asked me to help him make this for you.” He handed his brother a present that looked kind of like a 3-year-old had wrapped it.
Sam thought. Dean and Charlie were obviously talking about a guy. And honestly, THANK GOD! Maybe Dean was finally going to come out.
“No, I actually know. Chuck came to me in a dream last night. It was really weird, he played guitar, and there were alpacas-“ She made a face before continuing. It made Dean wonder what the alpacas had done to her. “Anyway, he told me this whole story about how this was his plan all along and how hard he’s shipped you and Cas all these years.”
He walked over to Dean’s room. He was about to knock on the door, but then he heard something through the cracked door.
By the time Charlie got back with drinks, Dean had washed his face in the bathroom sink and was sitting on his bed loosely hugging a pillow.
Dean sat down next to the angel, after grabbing another blanket from the pile Cas had in the corner of his room (he got cold easy, so Dean had bought him a bunch for Christmas).
Valentine’s Day would be the worst. Dean always felt extra romantic and sappy on Valentine’s Day. He would never let his brother know that, though. Sam thought that all Dean did on Valentine’s Day every year was hook up with some chick, but really, the older Winchester would meet someone (not always a woman) at a bar or something, but he’d take that person out on a real date with food and flowers and stuff. It was always fun and romantic, but he always let the person know that it was probably just gonna be a one-time thing and he’d be out of town soon.
“Did I say you could do that?” Cas tilted his head and looked down at Dean, his hips resting between Dean’s legs without thrusting or rutting the way Dean desperately wanted to, but he waited.  He was waiting.  He was being good.
The man sighed. “So the stingers are still… in me… I remember reading as a kid that you can actually force more venom or whatever out and basically sting yourself again if you take them out wrong. So I thought I’d just let y'all be the ones to deal with that shit show.”
“Dean, Cas doesn’t owe us anything. He didn’t lie or do something behind our back. I don’t understand what your issue is. You’ve been a dick ever since she called yesterday.”
“So fucking beautiful.”  Cas’ warm breath against his balls sent a shiver through Dean, but it was nothing compared to the feeling of Cas’ strong hands on the back of his thighs, pushing him up until he was folded in half.
“If your pain is bad enough, you think there may be a tear or a fissure, you must tell me.  I will never breathe a word of it to Sam, but you cannot let it go untreated.  I’ll find you cream to help with the pain and we will limit you to softer foods for a while. A bath might be nice too.”
He returned the glass to the tray and sat.  He took the remotes out of Dean’s hands and set those down on the table as well, after switching off the screen.  He sat sideways, as close to Dean as he dared get but kept his hands in his lap.
The younger man had his sweatshirt back on but was still in those ugly shorts.  He jogged up next to Castiel with a smile.  “I know normal folks keep the opposite schedule from me and tonight’s a work night, but would you wanna grab a drink tonight?  I appreciate you saving my life back there.”
“Are you gay?” Dean’s eyes shot to Cas, opening wide as he realized what just popped out of his mouth.
“Well, it’s all we’ve got.” Sam nodded, looking hard at Sister Veronica.  “If you think you can buy us some time to get Dean in and out of the library without Cas making too much of a fuss, I say we do it.  All this started with that fucking artifact, so let’s find out whatever we can about it.
Cas dipped down to his neck, licking and kissing, placing gentle suction on his pulse points.  “Delicious,” he whispered against Dean’s skin, stubble leaving behind ripples of sensation.
And her faith proved true over and over. In the black eyes and red shimmer around the man on the corner calling out to her:
It was the most words he’d ever heard Castiel say, even in class, and the most personal information he thought anyone other than maybe Meg had ever gotten about him.  Dean stopped his balance beam act and just looked at him.
“Alright, whatever. So you and the nun have a multiple personality disorder and she prayed for help?” Dean asked.
At the next bell, Dean returned for his last class of the day, but other than sitting in the back of the room and throwing torn up erasers at Victor’s head, he can’t say he did much.
“If you’d like me to get you one of the female nurses, I can, or I can give you a moment alone, but I think we should get these stingers out of you as soon as we can.” Castiel kept his voice calm, despite being crouched in front of Dean with his crotch right in his face.
“An intriguing idea…  I feel like we should get to know each other better, but it’s nice to know what options are on the table.”  He gave an exaggerated wink and started pulling out plates and small bowls for soy sauce.  He had chopsticks for them as well.
—A room with two beds please.- She looks them up and down, and Dean hopes she doesn't make any snide comments, but she just thinks about it, Dean can see until the thought bubble forms the sentence "
Because your happiness will be a long time away, you can wait for The Empty sitting in that goddamn chair! You son of a bitch!- He says angrily pointing to the chair beside them and leaves the room and for dramatic reasons he slams the door angrily, anger that is not hard to fake at the moment, his speech sounds even convincing for Cas who almost jumps at the slam of the door closing, he's never really seen Dean say things as angry as he does today.
—And how do you know?! Huh? How the hell do you know what that creature thinks?! It can come the minute I
When they enter the room, Dean turns on the lights and closes the door behind them and sits on the bed indicating for Cas to do the same. He sits about 20cm away from Dean who slides in bed approaching him, almost sticking his hips side by side. He breathes nervously, looking at his hands and squeezing them together, Cas is confused waiting for Dean to say something, he doesn't have the heart to cut through the dense silence between them, it's almost possible to cut it with a knife.
—You're going to be a lot of work, indeed- he says, chuckling and making Cas cover his face with his hands as he laughs and shyly says.
with you?- Cas's question doesn't sound like a question, it's a statement and Dean knows for sure what he meant now, with no room for another interpretation, but to be honest, there never was one. Dean looks at him again with teary eyes filled with tenderness and swallowing hard. A single tear runs down his right cheek. And Dean hesitates, he thinks about pulling Cas in for a kiss, supports one of his hands firmly on the back of the angel's neck, but he walks away leaving the angel extremely confused.
at you funny!- He says with his back to the angel who just stares at his back sighing. Dean turns angrily to face Cas now, a few tears spilling out of his control. He cups Cas's face in his hands not as gently as he would like and yells in his face -Why?! Why did you have to be so stupid?!-
.- Cas swallows hard as he remembers all the sensations and his gaze becomes cloudy and hot. Dean gets closer, bumping his nose over Cas's and pausing their foreheads together and the angel opens his lips in anticipation, but Dean holds back a little the will he has of his lips on his now and says almost whispering.
When he wakes up 6 hours later the angel is no longer in bed with him, but he smiles as he remembers what happened and smells him on his sheet, subtle evidence that it happened and he was there, he wanted his angel so much there with him, he wanted so much to have the courage to say everything he feel, but everything would have to change and he knows he's not prepared.
—That's totally ok Cas, go ahead!- he responds eagerly encouraging hin to continue and smiles nervously at the ex-angel gently stroking his head, Cas laughs at Dean's reaction and turns to the hard member in his hand, he gently wraps the entire head in his mouth, running his tongue over the slit tasting more of the liquid that was emerging, trying not to bump any teeth, he tries to take it deeper, but finds it's not as easy as it seems and he almost chokes. Dean sighs and caresses Cas' hair lovingly
—Dude! Come on! This isn't high school- Sam presses his lips together impatiently at his brother and responds.
They enter the room and the place is better than they imagined, it smells clean despite the worn furniture, Dean sits on the bed testing the mattress
—But if that's something that makes you uncomfortable and you think that my resignified guilt talk is pure bullshit I'd be happy with vanilla sex, because your vanilla is freaking delicious- Dean laughs a little as he says this and Cas smiles back at he gets lost a little in the green immensity of his eyes and Dean briefly loses himself in the intense blue immensity that flashes briefly in warm light.
—Sorry, I know you said all those things out of anger, but they're still true. I'm really crazy for putting so much weight on your shoulders, it would have been horrible if it had really worked, but you would have been saved would have been worth it.- Cas says seriously looking at Dean who turns his gaze away from Cas and lets out a humorless laugh. His eyes shine stubborn tears.
Since that day, for almost 3 years he can't stop thinking about having the angel again, everything that day was left so unfinished, and after that, they didn't have a day without chaos, he missed it so much and he can feel that angel missed him too because he is attacking him hungrily making a path of licks and bites through his chest and belly sending waves of pleasure to his intimacy that by now is wide awake.
—Being human is sometimes like this... Let's eat something, are you hungry? It's always better after you've eaten something- Cas's stomach growls in response and Dean laughs
When he is about to speed things up and get it over with quickly he hears the door open suddenly, he jumps startled, but soon calms down and Cas quickly closes the door and locks it behind him.
—Some things involve punishment and power play and that worries me a little, are these roots of the time you spent in hell? Sorry for bringing this up, but I have to ask.- Dean gets slightly tense along with Cas and looks away from him, closes his eyes and says.
Dean's whole body shakes hard and he can feel it getting closer, he clings to the angel's back digging nails there which rips a hoarse moan from Cas's throat, he growls in pleasure as he intensifies his movements, Cas sobs Dean's name and kisses him panting open-mouthed breathing hard against him and Dean smiles pleasantly, and then one last smack against his sensitive spot and enough to bring him to the edge of pleasure, he comes, his cock totally neglected, but he comes, hard and intense. He laughs and moans when he notices this, Cas still inside him working his own orgasm kisses him and says breathing hard.
—What if Cas is human? The Empty is only for angels and demons, isn't it?- Jack says with a smile and a bright, hopeful youthful look on his face, but Cas still in misery says worriedly.
5 hours later Dean wakes up, Cas is no longer close to his chest and he blindly runs his hand over the sheet, nothing, he is no longer there, so he lazily opens his heavy eyes and finds the ex-angel sleeping in the other bed.
—Human! It's not like the last time I didn't have my grace and it felt like there was something missing, I just feel...Fine.- He completes smiles on both of their faces, Jack pulls Cas into a hug and the boy whispers
—That was so hot…- He says swallowing hard and closing his eyes, delight stamped on his face. They are now trying to really focus on the shower as they lather up each other, teasing and laughter enveloping the moment.
Dean just breathes heavily and moans hoarsely throwing his head back when he feels the angel wrap his mouth around his throbbing intimacy and take him without hesitation. He swallows hard and stares at the angel who watches Dean's every reaction with his eyes glowing blue, his eyes are lit with an intensity he's never seen before, it's hot the way Cas stares at him, literally hot. Dean is speechless, it's overwhelming and intense, his mind sails away as he stares at the angel, he's speechless, he's confused, he's never experienced anything close to this.
Dean, the more he thought of Cas in heaven, the more he could feel the pain, she wanted to hit the surface, and it hit him like a well-placed punch in the pit of the stomach. Memories start to emerge, it's confusing at first, it's intense, erotic, painful…
—That's one way of looking at things, I find my satisfaction in making your mind explode with intense orgasms...and here, I don't risk killing you in the process.- Cas says sincerely and Dean can feel the truth in his angel words -And Dean, you blow my mind in a lot more significant ways than whit sex, our relationship is much more intense than that. I never needed to do this with you to love you intensely, and when we did it brought you more suffering than pleasure...Here it's different, however, it's much lighter, you're much lighter...I can feel your
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said, stealing himself for the sharp snap as his brother reset his nose.  It hurt, but Dean barely felt it.  It all happened through a fog.
“You know why. Focus on Meg. Come on.”  Dean’s hands drifted down and settled on Cas’s shoulders, squeezing them and trying to soothe the angry beast.  Cas audibly growled in Crowley’s direction who only smiled and waved.
Dean shrugged and looked around the cozy kitchen, eating area, living room that took over the front of the cabin.
He locked up the Impala and headed to the rowhouse Castiel lived in. He was on the first floor with his own door in a beautiful old brick building.  It was older, remodeled but not completely remade, maintaining the original facade of the structure, which Dean preferred.  He liked seeing the bones of things.
They spent the next few hours pouring through Bobby’s books, searching for entities that didn’t kill or feed or maim.  Along the way, they discovered that Castiel spoke fluent Russian and could read ancient Babylonian, which was a fucking trip, but they didn’t get any closer to figuring out Cas’s deal.
Instead, Evangelical minister Reverend Michael Saber had an opening for a youth minister and junior pastor.  Bringing Castiel out to the middle of nowhere to serve god’s purpose.  At mile eight, with a backpack, suitcase, and computer bag, God’s purpose was requiring a whole lot of faith, though.  He was exhausted.  The flight and train had been long enough. He was ready to sleep.  But first, he had to find his way to some cabin in the woods, willing to rent a room to him at a price he could afford on his pittance of a salary.
Dean clapped him on the shoulder and stood.  “You should take the couch.  You’ve been through a lot.  You have a couple of years to catch up on.” He began cleaning all the take-out and then stopping when Cas snapped his fingers, and it all disappeared.
Before Dean could reply, Cas pressed his tongue, flat and wide against Dean’s opening.  His body spasmed with pleasure he’d forgotten.  Cas tightened his grip on Dean’s ass and licked over Dean’s hole and perineum, hard and wet, over and over, moaning as he pressed his face deeper into Dean’s body until finally, his tongue began working Dean’s rim.  He pressed his tongue around Dean’s hole, licking circles closer and closer to the relief Dean needed.
The man headed straight to the free weights, dropped his bag in the corner, and stripped off his overshirt to reveal a plain, black tank top underneath.
“God, you’re beautiful,” Dean said and pulled him up to kiss him.  Awkwardly, messily, clutching at each other.  Dean pulled Cas close, pulling him against his chest, not caring about his cock or coming because all that mattered was that he be as close to Cas as possible.  “How are you real?” He whispered against a stubbled cheek before kissing him again.
People were everywhere, jumping in the pool fully clothed, streaking through the property in the back, making out in the corners.  There wasn’t a single room that wasn’t packed full of dancing, laughing, drunken teenagers.  This was the fucking party of the year.
Also, Baz has my absolute favorite lines in this chapter, what do you think of Cassie's best friend?
“Oh, you have no idea.” Dean leaned closer, bringing his lips to Castiel’s ear and breathing out warmth as he spoke.  “I had to jack off twice last night after you left and again this morning in the shower, just to be able to pay attention at work.  And even now, all I can think about is what we might get up to later.”
Now and then, she’d glimpse another one, but she never approached. She never spoke to the beautiful angels. They passed in and out of her life, fleeting moments of divine presence. But they never knew who she was. Until Castiel: The Shield of God.
Cas let out a small squeak.  “How?  I was never good to you the way I should have been.  The way I wanted to be.”  His hands gripped Dean tighter.
Dean pulled his keys out of his pocket and left the party, relaxing when the door closed and the noise dulled a little.  He ran the little ways down the street to where he’d parked the Impala, jumped in, and started it.  He was mostly sober now. The adrenaline of the stand-off with Crowley and Cas looking like he was going to make the whole room spontaneously combust had that effect.  He pulled around to the side of the house and texted Cas.
“No… Fuck…” Meg muttered, turning into him, body freezing except for the nails that were now definitely digging into the skin of his chest and arm.
Dean ran his fingers through Cas’ sweaty hair, watching as the black mess began to curl up of its own volition.  Cas had never been able to tame his hair.  It was a joy to see it still the same.  Just like them.  Somethings can never change,
Dean leaned back against the brick wall and took in some deep breaths before pulling out another cigarette with a shaking hand.  What the fuck had just happened?  Krushnic was weird, yeah, but there was something in his interaction with Meg—who he’d always thought was the dude’s girlfriend—that made no sense.  He’d been firm and tender and so fucking hot with that voice too deep for a 17-year-old.
“Good to know,” Castiel said, working his way down Dean's thighs. His bowed legs made it easy to see and remove the few stingers there, but the smell of him, the dark musky scent of sawdust mixed with the freshness of the lake water, did things to Cas. Things he shouldn’t feel at work.
wasn’t enough to even begin to cover it, but he didn’t have the words right now.  His vocabulary was full of ways to show his fury, his disgust, his hatred, his despair.  He didn’t have enough ways to say how grateful he was.
It was the least he could do really, after making him all soggy. Not a single ulterior motive there - he'd even close his eyes while Cas changed. He was being practically saintly.
"They'd killed themselves because they were gay and in love, and that wasn't allowed. The pain of it, the guilt, the judgement, never being able to be happy together - they couldn't live like that. I nearly
Dean ran his hand over the scratchy, rather unkempt hair on his chin that had crossed the line from stubble to beard around four weeks ago. This was so fucking hard. Hearing Cas's voice had made it almost bearable at first, but lately it had just been adding to the increasingly heavy ache of loneliness in the pit of his stomach.
"I think Jack knew I needed this," Dean murmured, looking out at the reflection of the sky on the still lake. "Our day here was awesome, and he knew I'd love this house."
"How will you know I'm actually asleep and not just playing dead in the desperate hope that you'll stop talking about cowboy films?"
Cas felt like he couldn't breathe, holding his breath, waiting for Dean to say it. Because he hadn't known. Cas
Cas rolled his eyes and then let himself drop forward onto his hands, his nose almost touching Dean's.
. I will always choose to save you, whatever the sacrifice. I would fall from Heaven a hundred times over, cast it aside and live an eternity of torture in Hell if it meant saving you.”
Pressing their little fingers against each other, they twisted them together, like a tiny parody of holding hands. Cas' heart fluttered with nerves and he wondered at how something so small could reduce him to such a mess.
The realisation hit Dean like a freight train. He hadn't even considered that Kate might want him, he'd been so blinded by his jealousy that she might want Cas. He'd be
Without waiting for a reaction, he pulled back so quickly that he stumbled, almost falling. Then he turned on his heel and for the second and last time in his life, he ran out of the bunker as if Hell Hounds were on his heels.
The third episode had finished twenty minutes ago and Dean knew he should probably sleep. Cas should either go home or go back to the room he had here - either way, they should go their separate ways for the night. But Dean didn't want that, so he was stalling.
"You know, you really need some clothes that flatter you more. You hide under coats and baggy sweaters all the time and-"
Before she'd arrived, they'd all gathered to discuss how they would keep the monster talk to a minimum. They'd agreed that they would just talk about other things. That wouldn't be too hard, would it? Cas was sure it would be easy—he’d been explaining the unexplainable to Kate since he'd first met her and she seemed to be inclined towards not believing in anything that couldn’t be explained by science. A fallen Angel of the Lord? Not easily explained by science. A woman brought back from the dead in a bath of tepid water? Definitely not easily explained by science.
His head felt like red hot knives were piercing his skull over and over again. His mouth tasted like crap and he had a vague but horrifying memory of having ugly-cried while holding on to Sam's leg.
Dean looked down at Cas in the darkness, trying to work out what the Angel could possibly be so embarrassed about that he couldn't speak in coherent sentences. Oh.
"Don't be so negative," Jody reprimanded, her words slurring a little, but she was pretty steady otherwise. She pulled up a chair across from Cas and put an arm around Donna. "Remember that double date we went on? That wasn't so bad."
Cas reached Dean, stopping when only an inch separated their bodies. Those beautiful wings were within touching distance now. Part of Cas, but unfamiliar - Dean felt like he'd got to the last page of a book, only to discover it was part of a trilogy and he was expected not to open the next book. He was so achingly familiar, but here, like this, he was also something new, something powerful and dangerous.
The button finally popped free, and Cas’ hands dove down the front of Dean’s jeans with indecent haste.
Cas swore and Dean held the phone tighter, like he could pretend he was somehow clinging to Cas instead.
Dean started grinding back against Cas, lifting his ass to try to wiggle into the right position so Cas would fuck him. The teasing was unbearable, driving him higher and higher, but at the same time making him want to beg and sob with desperation. He wanted Cas inside him. He
"I've thought about it, but it actually uses only precise, small amounts of Grace when compared to healing. I'd be better going into a hospital and using it to heal someone if the only goal was to get rid of it."
Distracted from Cas by the prospect of sampling that same delicious food, Dean padded back into the kitchen, mercifully before any of it burned. He opened the refrigerator door to grab a carton of orange juice and Cas' eyes widened as he caught sight of the formerly depressingly bare shelves, now stacked high with food.
“I heard enough. It’s okay, Dean. It’s none of dad’s business who you date. I’ll make sure he doesn’t give you a single moment of hassle about it.”
Cas could only hope that Sam, who had been similarly deserted, would be looking after Kate and finishing their game with her, because the look of fury on her face had been a little bit scary, and this didn't seem like it was going to be a two minute makeout session and then back inside again.
"Dean?" Cas murmured, a question in his eyes. Was this long enough? Had they been sociable long enough to be able to leave now?
There were hugs, and suspiciously dewy eyes from Donna, and when Dean got up to get some champagne to toast them with, Claire came back over to Cas and leaned on his shoulder.
"I can handle him like this, I promise." Dean looked up from unbuttoning his overshirt. He pulled it off and helped Cas into it, smudging his paint and ruining his shirt. "It's cold outside, man. You'll need this."
I've had so many Kudos and lovely reviews since I posted my last chapter, and I just wanted to say that I appreciate every single one more than you could possibly know 💙💚
"We're fine like this," Dean muttered defensively. He hated using his phone for the million different things everyone seemed to need them for these days. Phones were meant for calling, texting, and in a real emergency when his laptop was playing up, watching porn.
“Living in limbo must be really confusing. I'd be tempted go to a bar and spend it all on a weekend of sex and debauchery."
With a thrust so deep that both Dean and Cas cried out together, Cas’ arms fell from where they had wound tightly around Dean's neck, and instead Cas tangled his fingers in his soft bedsheets, gripping them tightly in his fist as if it would anchor him as each drive of Dean’s hips drove him higher and higher.
"I can always see you." He was so deadly serious and Dean tried to swallow past the lump in his throat.
He missed the shot entirely, the white ball bouncing uselessly off the side and hitting nothing at all. Sam laughed.
"You never would have?" The tone he used was so accusing and cold that Cas flinched from it. Dean's mouth was set in a hard, straight line and Cas felt panic start to rise in his throat, prickle at his palms. He could face down Demons, Gods and armies of warrior angels, but not Dean, not like this.
It had taken a lot longer to sort than Dean had predicted, so when Dean limped tiredly into the Bunker and straight into a hot shower, Sam had hammered on the bathroom door, demanding answers.
Cas bent down over Dean, and as he did, he brought his ass lower, so there was just a brief moment of friction that made Dean suck in a breath of air and hold it. His hands came up, gripping Cas' hips, trembling at the thought of pulling Cas down onto him, hard, repeatedly, fucking through their clothes.
Cas nodded and shrugged, obviously not picking up on the romance of the situation at all. Dean wondered what he'd have to do if he really wanted to romance the Angel and have him actually notice.
Dean wandered over to the fridge and poured himself a glass of orange juice, then glancing over at Cas, got down a second glass to fill.
"It's beautiful," he breathed, forgetting that he wasn't really talking to Dean, as the fucker had broken his heart 40 minutes earlier.
"How come he can say your name just fine, but not mine?" Cas muttered in Dean's ear as he passed the unwieldy child over to him. "It's literally his name too!"
Dean who went purgatory for an entire year, just to save him when he didn’t deserve saving. Dean who came back for him time and time again, never giving up. Except for the last time.
Dean shrugged. Sure - why not? Cas could have said anything at that point and Dean would have been agreeing with it.
that fucked you up, Dean. Do you think I didn't know that you'd sit there, drinking and watching the security tapes, watching him die over and over again?"
Cas—and he was giving himself to Dean with eager abandon in a way that Dean hadn’t been able to capture in even his most detailed of fantasies.
"I used to do it all the time - it was what I wanted to do with my life, alongside hunting. That, and fixing up old cars; true works of art, like Baby. But my dad thought music was a distraction. Gotta be honest though, it's not the biggest thing my dad will be pissed at me for when he sees me again.”
“It’s not your fault. I made that deal with The Empty because it was the only way to save Jack. The timing of my death might have been different if I hadn't been trying to save you too, but the outcome was always going to be the same. I was on borrowed time.”
Cas quickly glanced around to check for people. It was cold, and while Dean didn't feel the cold after a few drinks, Cas very much still did, and that limited what Cas was prepared to do and how long he wanted to be out there for. No, this needed to be quick.
Claire and Kaia tended to keep to themselves for the most part, possibly because it always looked like one would be dragging the other somewhere private at any moment to do things Cas definitely didn't want to think about them doing. But today they were somehow even more joined at the hip than usual and Cas suspected that it might have something to do with the new ring he'd spotted on Kaia's finger in the few seconds she'd forgotten to hide it away under her sweater sleeve. Whatever reason they had for hiding it, Cas respected their right to privacy—however much he wanted to congratulate them both.
“I don’t know. I just always have.” He said it so simply, like not loving Dean had never been an option. His eyes were wide, shining brightly with unhindered candour, the vulnerability behind them bewitching Dean so completely that the feelings it stirred up inside him made him feel dizzy. He wanted to wrap Cas in his arms and never let go; he wanted to protect him from anything that existed that could ever hurt him.
And now he was thinking about Cas being topless in the sun, his skin glowing warmly, heat sinking into him, so that when Dean would slide his hands down his chest, it would feel almost hot to the touch. Then he'd bend his head and-
it's too soon?" It was. It was much too soon after they’d broken up. But then in other ways it wasn’t too soon at all. They’d been dancing around this since the first day they had met.
"I was never a teenager, Sam," Cas frowned, dropping his hands reluctantly from Dean's waist and turning to inspect the items sitting on the shelves behind him. A dog with only one ear, a miniature plane with a broken tail, a China doll with blank and staring eyes, a clown that looked like it would come to life and kill you while you slept—Cas could see why this place was putting Dean on edge.
Cas' hands were already lifting the hem of the t-shirt, pulling it up in what Dean could have sworn was soft porn slow-motion.
Dean felt a pang of sadness. He liked being able to pray to Cas. It let him say things he couldn't bring himself to say to his friend’s face.
"They're freaking adorable, Cas," Dean said, looking at him fondly. "But I've gotta say, I prefer you with less clothes on."
"You're gonna need clean clothes," Dean said, throwing a t-shirt, Jeans, boxers and socks on the bed. He didn't mention the streaks of mud on the legs of Cas' discarded jeans, nor the socks that looked suspiciously like Cas had been trekking through the woods in them, but gave him a pointed look when Cas looked like he was going to argue the point.
"It was only supposed to be a short term thing. A bit of fun," Dean defended. "We were being ridiculous.
—Is everything alright?- Dean notices the confused expression on the face of the ex-angel lying down breathing heavily
Dean lightly bites the former angel's lower lip, both panting from the kiss, they quickly look at each other before Dean invades Cas's neck with mouth, teeth and tongue pulling a guttural moan from the ex-angel, at this moment Dean's eyes stay clouded with pleasure and he smirks at Cas's raw reactions, he's so sensitive to Dean's touch it's like he's yearned for it for centuries or millennia.
—What was that Cas?! W-what does that mean?! Does all this mean what I t-think it means?!- They look at each other now astonished. Cas is speechless, he can only stare at Dean with shame now, shame isn't quite the word, but he didn't expect to have to deal with the consequences of declaring himself to Dean, he was so happy, he thought he was going to be dead by now. Empty still hangs over his shoulder, it could come at any moment, and the thought gives him chills and suffocating nausea.
He hears the shower turn on and he can't shake the mental image that forms of Cas letting the water wash over his naked body, he closes his eyes and squeezes his aching erection through his pants. Moved by impulse and insane courage, he undresses leave only his underwear and goes towards the bathroom, he stops in front of the shower box, blurred by the hot water and opens it slowly, Cas had his eyes closed, when he hears Dean sliding the door he opens eyes surprised, they exchange an intense look.
He feels Cas slip one of his hands inside his shirt as he leans in for a shy kiss. Dean deepens the kiss, turning it into an erotic dance, almost rude, so passionate and excited is his urge for Castiel. He feels the ex-angel eagerly slide his hand into his sweatpants and boxers and grab his balls urgently and a little fumbling. Dean slides his pants up to his knee a little too eagerly, which pulls a warm smile from Cas's mouth that interrupts the kiss to enjoy the view. Dean is so beautiful. Cas pulls Dean's shirt up and the hunter helps him finish taking it all off.
—Yes...Um, there's a place near the Gas-N-Sip that serves a very good coffee- He suggests helpfully offering a friendly smile
- He says slowly emphasizing each word in his final sentence making Dean no longer hold back the tears he was trying to hold, he gives a smile through his tears, clean them with his free hand and say.
—Cas...Can I come in your face angel? Please…- He was about to do it without asking, but gathered up the last of the dignity that still existed in him at that moment and pleaded moaning. Cas stopped what he was doing with his mouth and started pounding with his fist.
“Please,” Dean finally managed to croak. “Cas, please, please, I need you.  I always need you.  Please.”
“Just tell me.” Sam straightened up and narrowed his eyes, looking a surprising amount like their father.
Cas laid his hand on the side of Dean’s face pressing him into the mattress and holding him in places. His hips continued to fuck frantically.  An alien growl escaped him and the pace increased.  Dean wanted to scream or struggle, but the pressure against his face felt like his head might pop.  The pressure made his ears ring and the pain in his skull raged.
“Besides, if Sister Veronica called you in herself, she must have great faith in you.” Her voice filled with a kind of awe every time she said Cas’s new vessel’s name. Dean itched to ask about her, what made this Sister so special, what made her someone Cas would ditch his life so completely for. What made her more important than… Whoah there. Dean focused on his brother’s back, forcing himself to stop thinking. Instead, he kept his ears open, listening to their voices bouncing off the rocks, and thought about what a nightmare of reverse engineering putting these lights in must have been.
“Use those pretty lips,” Cas whispered and Dean wrapped them around Cas’ fingers, sucking them into his mouth like he was feverish like he was in the desert and Cas his only source of water.  He needed to do something, to give back, but he didn’t know how when Cas was so completely in control.  Dean thanked him for telling him what he wanted by sucking and licking his fingers with all of the need building in his heart.
Thank you for all the wonderful comments on the last chapter!  I LOVE hearing your feedback.  It inspired me to work extra hard to bring you this chapter early.
There was a pause while Dean fished his keys out of his pocket and pulled on his jacket before heading out to the Impala.  It was cold and rainy and even with the car on the windows fogged up as he sat there, waiting, feeling more and more like an idiot.
The fire raged around her but she held still, waiting for the angel to take the bread and honey from her.  She pulled her arm out, the flesh red, but not in pain.
“I live in a convent.  You’ve never seen drunk until you see a bunch of old nuns after a successful bake sale. And you don’t have to call me Sister Veronica.  Just Sister is fine.” She walked out in front of them and then stopped and turned back. “Where’s the kitchen?” She asked with such surprise the brothers couldn’t help but laugh.
“Meg is smoking hot.  A bitch, yeah, but if that doesn’t bother you, I think you’re crazy not to be hitting that.”
Dean laughed again and gestured for Castiel to take a seat at the wooden picnic table.  He placed the plate of cheeseburgers next to a bowl of mixed greens and started piling food on his plate.
“That’s them.  There’s 7 of us total.  When our father left to try and preach and bring people to his faith, I was two.  I don’t even remember what he looked like.  Our uncle Ishram stepped in, taking over parenting us, and took care of my mother.  They never married, but he was the only real father I ever knew.”
“Yes, or you can call me Nurse Novak if you prefer. Most everyone just calls me Castiel. Can I get you some clothes?” Castiel could offer a gown or even some scrubs to help save the guy’s dignity.
He changed quickly, shucking his sweaty clothes and pulling on his outer clothes from earlier before grabbing his bag and heading out toward the exit.  He preferred to shower alone at home, especially these days when he had fresh mental footage of the beautiful stranger—of
Dean nodded, wide eyes still not looking at Castiel’s face. “I don’t think that’s the problem, but okay, if I’m not making you uncomfortable…”
I know you guys have been getting nervous about when the angst was going to show up.  Well, here you go.  Strap in kiddos.
Castiel scuttled to his room, where his suitcase, computer bag, and backpack all sat.  The mud had been mostly wiped off of them and lined up along the wall of the little room.  He had a twin-sized bed, a small dresser, a desk, and a closet.  The desk sat under a window looking out into what had to have once been a garden, or maybe it was just intended to be one and no one ever got to it.  The area was cordoned off and had once been tilled, but now looked more like a weed farm than a garden.
Cas shook his head. “Yes, she knows everything. That was one of the many conditions she and I agreed to before...” Castiel gestured vaguely to the body he inhabited, only drawing more attention to the long legs and shroud-defying hips.
“Yeah, but there’ll be beer,” Ruby smirked, snaking her arm around Gordon and snuggling into his side. “He’s got some stepbrother or something who helps him out and provides quality libations for his parties. Probably knows that’s the only way anyone will talk to the kid.”
“What exactly do you think you’re doing, Crowley.” A familiar voice rose above the crowd, it vibrated through Dean’s body, like a sonic aftershock.  Dean turned and found Cas pushing his way through a crowd that suddenly was more than willing to get out of the way.  “I told you Meg was off limits.”
, and that was so long ago, sorry Cas.- Cas just hugs Dean back and pulls back briefly to capture his lips briefly.
—Oh...Dean...I'm gonna come!- He watches the blonde taste the jets as they exchange a sly look, Cas shivers in Dean's hands, overwhelmed by the waves of his orgasm hitting.
He forgives Dean, the minute he regrets saying those words. While Cas has these thoughts Dean pushes deep against the angel and kisses madly on his neck, enjoying every minute of it before it turns into a tragedy and pulling Cas's sent deep into his nostrils, trying not to fall in love any more than he already was and realizing that he is, indeed, fucked, Cas have him,
—You're hard work, you know?- He says, turning his eyes to Cas now, resting his elbows on his knees and laughing a little shyly. He's relieved, it seems he's only just realized what they're doing in the room. Dean called him with the intention of sealing the deal, but now he's nervous about it like a virgin on prom night.
—7:30...We really open at 8:00, but I have to prepare some things before...- Cas smiles slightly to the floor and completes -We don't have time to...You know- Dean exchanges a look with him completely baffled and laugh nervously
—Fuck!- Dean exclaims extremely excited with his entrance stretching and relaxing so quickly when he realizes Cas is already on his way to enter him, banging his head on the entrance and he's ready. The angel penetrates him without hesitation, he knows he won't hurt Dean and in his slightly selfish mind, he doesn't want Dean having a chance to think his time about it so he invades him hitting his prostate with a slight help of his grace leaving Dean on the brink of madness tearing a hoarse moan from him.
Dean can't believe he asked Cas to make him forget about the times they made love and he believes even less that Cas did and he really thought they couldn't ever fix it. He was really broken, Cas probably saw how much, will he ever get a chance to fix this? Cas gave up on him forever when he found his happiness? Did that mean that Cas finally broke free of him and ran for the hills and accepted that loving Dean is self-destruction, pointless, aimless madness and pure
—I'm not sure I'm comfortable with you praising that body Dean, it's not my body. I'm fully human in him, but I don't know how to feel about it.- The erection around Dean's hands at this point is slightly softer now. Dean, gently put that aside to pull his lover into a hug.
Dean, then everything came, doubt, love, hate, desire, guilt... Everything formed in him like a snowball and brought him incredible experiences, it was the best years of his life and the most complicated, the most insane ones, but the best because he could feel it.
—Well...Hmm…- He looks so baffled, and Dean teases him a little more by sitting across from him at the table staring at him so mischievously that Cas feels naked, and Dean flashes him a smile and the angel immediately smiles back, his eyes shining with lust, Dean bumps one of his legs against Cas's under the table and at that moment Mary appears in the kitchen attracted by the smell of coffee and witnesses the way they were looking at each other, and she feels like she's caught the boys actually having sex by the way they both almost jump out of their chair when they realize she's entered the room.
Dean sighs in frustration and feels his heart break, he wants Cas close. He feels the urge to snuggling up in bed with him, but pushes that thought away. He reaches for his cell phone to check the time and it's 6:25, he tries to go back to sleep, but he's really not tired anymore, he's got so used to his body to sleep little and to be always alert that when he can sleep more there's no need. A sudden noise coming from Cas' cell phone makes him almost jump out of bed, it's his alarm, he probably has to get to work early.
—I-I don't know- Cas simply says still crying along with Dean who stares at him still supporting his arms together. He doesn't want to let go of him at the moment, his heart is pounding in his chest like it's in his throat ready to leap out. Cas is still here, after telling him he was going to die and he loved him.
—You are so beautiful when you have an orgasm. Damn!- He exclaims the curse so naturally that it pulls another smile from Dean who is still ecstatic feeling the angel inside him, he's so sensitive now, he whimpers at every move of the angel. Cas can sense that for Dean the sensitivity is bordering on pain, but he doesn't ask him to stop. Dean's pleading moans are like music to Cas' ears and he can't take it anymore.
After a few minutes, Sam suggested they go to the infirmary, up a level, and on the other end of the bunker.
The nun held his gaze and the painful, powerful truth of her words was what finally allowed him to crumble against Sam’s embrace, tears streaming down his face.
They continued to banter as they cleaned up and carried everything inside.  Castiel managed to avoid talking about his past while insisting he do the dishes.  It’s only fair since Dean did all the cooking.
Castiel wrapped the towel around his waist, trying to pull it as tight as possible around his already thin frame and fruitlessly looked around to see if maybe there was another towel in here he could wrap around his shoulders.  The walk back to the house drove his heart rate up.  What would Dean think about him just walking in his house half-naked?  What would he think about the burn scars scattered across his body or the small tattoo on his left ribs?  Would he ask?  Would he even notice?
It was slow and sweet.  Dean remembered the feel of it, the tentative first touch of lips against lips and then the sweet taste of Castiel when he licked inside Dean’s mouth.  The first brush of tongues sent relief through his system so profound his knees nearly gave out from it, but Cas’ arms had wrapped around his waist, pulling Dean tightly against his chest.
Dean slammed his hand down on the bed, jostling Cas’s body just enough for one of his arms to fall from its place and dangle off the edge. He reached forward, meaning to just put it back, but the hand--his hand--was warm. Not like a corpse. Like Cas. The room smelled like Cas. He didn’t even realize he knew what Cas smelled like, not consciously.
Did I make you stew in your juices long enough?  Are you properly excited for part II of their date?
Dean let Sam help him up onto the infirmary examination bed and tried not to wince at the pain that shot through him as he sat.  Sam said nothing and looked away but Dean could practically feel the giant puppy-dog eyes filling with water.
“I’m not surprised. We’ll give you something for that once all the stingers are out. Do you want to lay down?”
Dean shivered and nodded in the dark.  Could Cas see him?  Did the angel smile at his willingness to please?
“I didn’t mean hit, I meant—fuck man, you know what I meant, no one is that literal.  I meant have sex with her.”
“Alright, look, we’re just going outside,” Dean said to the dude blocking their path.  His accent was off, British or Scottish. Dean tried to maneuver Meg away from him but he just kept casually slipping in the way.
“I was hoping some of the stingers would pull out with the clothes, you know, like stick in the fabric instead of me, and then I jumped in the lake.”
Dean crouched down in the garage, leaning his back against Baby. The driver’s side door offered him comfort and stability while his mind raced. What he really needed was a drink. He should have stored some in here. Put that on the to-do list. But even a long draw of Jack wasn’t worth having to talk to Sam right now. Sometimes a man just needed to be left alone with his thoughts. Even if his thoughts were racing too fast to make any sense of. Even if some part of his thoughts were about how he felt betrayed. Why would he feel betrayed? It was just a damn vessel. Not like he didn’t know Castiel had been a woman before.
"Not the vessel - you. I've seen Jimmy, and I've seen Emanuel, Lucifer - all with your face. It's you who makes this face beautiful."
"If it helps," came the gruff voice from very close to Dean's left ear, "when he gets old he has hair like Doc Brown's from those Back to the Future films you made me watch with you."
"Let's go," Dean said curtly to Cas, not even waiting for him to reply, and Cas was left trailing after him, only pausing long enough to grab a half-full bottle of whisky to use as a makeshift disinfectant and the first bandages he could see on the shelf.
Sam made a zipping motion with his fingers, and Dean watched as he unveiled what looked like a very generous slice of pecan pie. Dean's mouth watered. Sam barely ever made these for him these days, he was so busy clucking over Eileen.
He should explain to Cas before there were people here. He had to tell Cas what the boundaries were, before it blew up in his face. But how did you even broach that? Did Cas even understand this was a secret? He hadn't said. They hadn't talked about anything, really. They needed to talk.
"He always had the girls fightin’ for his attention, did Dean. Beatin’ them off with a stick all the time. Probably got so many choices he can’t pick just one woman. Maybe I should be doin’ it for him!"
Dean let out a long, slow hiss through his teeth as he fought to stay in control. Cas let Dean's cock pop out of his mouth for long enough to moan against it.
"Beautiful. Just beautiful," Chuck gave a thin, pained smile. "Just one problem - Dean Winchester isn't capable of accepting your love. He'll never be in a happy relationship, never stop hunting to have a family, never allow himself to be at peace, because he doesn't
talking man in front of him, Dean marvelled at the way each compliment, each and every sentimental, beautiful observation made him feel like he had butterflies in his stomach. Other people had made him feel embarrassed and awkward when they’d flattered him like that—it had always seemed empty and forced, designed to manipulate, to get something out of him. But when Cas said these things, Dean believed he meant every single word.
Dean turned to watch as Cas dug around in the kitchen drawers, loudly slamming things shut, not actually seeming to be looking for anything specific. He should probably have hidden his amusement, but fuck, Cas was adorable when he was annoyed with him.
Cas nodded in understanding. Kate and her husband had split amicably two years ago, and her daughters spent three weekends a month with their father. It wasn't ideal, but it meant Kate could study in peace when she wasn't working, and it worked for them.
"Alright." Cas shrugged, unable to see what the big deal was. How could Dean think he'd ever break up with him? He knew how Cas felt about him. "But we do need to talk."
"I think that would be very nice.” Cas took a mouthful of his beer. “It might be even nicer when you have some furniture. I tried to stay overnight the other night, because I’d had too much to drink to drive home. Ended up sleeping in a pile of old painting sheets, which my human back objected strongly to the next morning."
"Dean sounds like a great kid though. And how wouldn't he be with such an awesome name?" Dean's cheery tone was forced, but he was genuinely touched by Sam’s gesture.
“Sam, get off me,” Dean fought against Sam’s grip. “I’m going to give Bruce Almighty here what’s coming to him.”
Chuck put his hands up in mock defence, turning away from them to sit at the table full of food. He turned to Claire, who was standing at the other side of the table next to Kaia.
Kate silently walked to the light switch, then the room was plunged into semi-darkness, lit only by the flickering of the television set.
They held each other for too long; Too long for them to be just friends; too long for them to only be parting for a day; too long for it not to hurt to let go.
“You come to Heaven, Cas is here and he doesn’t come to meet you? What the hell?” Sam was incredulous and Dean knew how he felt. It was all he’d been thinking about as he’d been driving.
If the sudden dazed look in Dean's eyes was anything to go by he was obviously vividly remembering what Cas' Grace had felt like at the restaurant that night.
"Hopefully my little sightseeing trip will be fruitful, and I'll have seen enough of the sights to come home to you again very soon."
"There's an aquarium about an hours drive away," Kate said, peeling the crust off her grilled cheese sandwich and putting it on the edge of her plate piece by piece. "I take the kids every year and you're welcome to come with us next time. There's this tunnel that you can walk under, and all these sharks and stingrays swim over you. I bet you'd love it."
"Yeah," Cas lied, staring out of the window at the lake so as not to give in to his emotions and either cry in front of Dean, or go back on everything he just said and jump on him. Dean really didn't want that, not any more.
"You disappear, worry the crap outta me, won’t tell me where you were or who you were with, and now you want to leave again? That's great. Just great."
"Yeah, I get that. She wants someone to adore her, to choose her, and I can't be that for her. But how do we get Jack back if not by giving her what she wants? Don't tell me you haven't considered it, Cas."
Chuck had been talking while Cas had been distracted, his smug expression remaining calm as if he didn't sense the danger to him at all.
“Cas…” Dean felt the word leave his lips and dissipate into the air like a prayer. His hands were tangled in the trenchcoat that he’d missed so damn much, because if he wasn’t holding on, he knew he wouldn’t be able to keep standing. His knees were weak, everything was trembling and he didn't know if it was a culmination of finally having Cas in front of him like this, or the terror of being brought back to life, sent back to a world where everything was just so horrifically hard. He wasn't sure he could do this again.
Dean felt his face crumpling, his breath coming fast. He was splintering apart, into tiny pieces that no one would be able to put back together again. But even as the panic surged through him like an unstoppable tidal wave, Dean felt Cas' fingers in his hair, stroking, calming, gentle and reassuring.
“Yes,” Cas growled in response, and Dean sucked in a breath. His hips jerked, trying to fuck Cas’ hand where it held him not quite tightly enough inside his jeans. “But your brother is going to be knocking on this door at any moment, and I’ve had my fill of being interrupted for one day.”
Then Dean’s mouth was on Cas’ forehead, pressing, kissing. His lips were on Cas’ cheeks, his nose, his eyelashes, his jaw and then finally,
Cas felt the wetness on the thick material of Dean's shirt before he even realised he was crying too. Once he realised, it was like something broke in him. Pretending to be fine day after day, getting up each morning and plastering a fake smile on his face when all he felt all day every day was this dull ache, this yearning for Dean that he could never assuage, no matter how he tried. He could pretend he was fine, but he wasn't. The only time he truly felt any kind of peace was when he was with Dean.
Dean had finished choking to death on his drink, and he'd wiped his mouth and come to stand next to Cas again.
"Oh, of course," she said, sarcasm dripping from her voice. "I mean, you'd have met them before now, only one of them is the Amazing Spiderman and the other is the Incredible Hulk! They’ve been rather busy in between their jam packed filming schedules and all that crime fighting."
Since his first glimpse of her familiar brown eyes and freckled nose, Dean had seethed. She was Eileen's friend and he'd had to grit his teeth and firmly tell himself that today wasn't about him, wasn't the time for him to make a scene. The seats had each been marked with tiny name labels, and Dean wished he'd had the foresight to sneak in early and switch them, so Kate was sitting right at the back, as far away from Cas as humanly possible.
of our people?” Sam asked hopefully, fixating on one single part of the dialogue with a hopeful look on his face.
“Although tomorrow,” he murmured, “when I’m not feeling like I’m about to vomit into your hair, I’m going to fuck you,
Garth blew kisses, which Dean pretended to catch and eat, then he flicked the light off and backed out of the room, leaving Dean and Cas to handle their first ever joint bedtime.
"When you've been dumped, and this is step one of making it better," she said, throwing a spoon into his lap and offering him the choice between cookie dough and strawberry cheesecake.
After a beat of everyone in the room staring at him, Dean got to his feet, collecting some glasses in his free hand as he realised he was clinging to his phone in his other hand - not that there was any point, he knew Cas wouldn't text or call, but that didn't stop him clinging to it like an idiot. He headed towards the kitchen, Sam close on his heels.
"You can't just sit there, calmly eating that fucking travesty of a meal, and just throw into conversation that you're telling all of our secrets to some-"
Cas couldn't tear his eyes away from Dean. He was trembling, his head shaking slowly from side to side in denial, his eyes wide, dark and terrified. Dean was
“Do you know what I did the night you were taken from me?” he asked, his voice so full of emotion that Cas ached to hear it.
Dean's pupils were big, his eyes a little glazed. He was looking at Cas' lips like he wanted nothing more than to be kissing them. Cas loved kissing Dean, loved the way Dean would lick his way into his mouth. Sometimes he purposely kept his mouth closed, just so Dean would do it. The feel of him teasing his lips, winning him over, pushing into his mouth. Up until this morning Cas would have said that kissing Dean was actually better than sex. Now he supposed he could still say that kissing Dean was better than sex with anyone else, because it was
“I don’t understand,” Sam shouted over the noise of the wind. It was getting louder and louder, to the point where it was hurting his ears, stinging his skin as it whipped past.
"I want that too," Cas admitted. He lifted a trembling hand to Dean's cheek, caressing and stroking. Dean nuzzled into it, pressing a kiss against his wet palm.
“Language, Dean!” Garth reprimanded, covering Gertie’s ears with his hands. He scooped her up out of Cas’ lap. “What has Uncle Potty Mouth been teaching you this time?”
"When you decided to invite Chuck to our home, did you even for a minute think about the effect it would have on Eileen, who was
"Dean, sit and eat this before it becomes inedible. If I have to microwave it, it'll become all chewy," Sam scolded, reminding Dean of what poor Eileen had to put up with on a daily basis. No wonder she was crabby lately.
"I know I've made mistakes," Cas said softly. "The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you. If you want to shout at me, get your anger out, I deserve it. I owe you that." .
He didn't bother to get properly dressed. He was too eager to see Dean, both to make sure things were okay between them, and to find out what Dean was creating in that tiny kitchen of his. Cas pulled on his robe and tied it firmly around his waist.
Drawing it out for another couple of minutes, Dean finally  let Cas pull him to his feet and into the cubicle. In the middle of the shower, Cas pulled Dean in for a long, slow kiss. The shower heads at either end were spraying hot, steaming water down each of their backs and Dean wondered why he'd never done this before. The heat of the water on his shoulders, the heat of Cas pressed against his chest - it was glorious.
"I've gone to a lot of effort to come here to speak with you today. Most of the others wanted to kill you to get you out of the way instead. We had to create a distraction on the other side of the globe to get Her attention away from here so I could talk to you without being seen. Every moment I'm out here with you in the open, I'm putting us at risk."
Cas shook his head in despair as Sam eyed them both suspiciously, but shrugged and let Dean lead him around the corner, into the hallway.
“Do you want to know what I would have said to you that night, if you’d have given me the chance?” Dean asked, his voice so low it seemed to vibrate through Cas as it pinned him in place.
Cas climbed off of Dean with shaking legs and sat crossed legged next to him instead. His hands were still unsteady as they trailed down Dean's chest, sending little shocks of pleasure down his spine. Cas eyed the tented boxers, complete with evident wet patch and looked at Dean almost shyly, his sassiness fading into the background now he wasn't half blinded by lust.
Cas was making sympathetic noises. "She keeps calling me too. She's suspicious that I've gone on holiday all alone and just keeps asking questions. I've had to put my phone on silent, so she doesn't, uh, scare off the wildlife when I'm exploring."
He was so very screwed. He was going to end up with goats living in his bathtub and some poor rescued raccoon sleeping between them in bed. And he'd do it all with a smile, because seeing Cas happy was
Listening to the slow, steady breathing of the three children, and sitting in the near darkness with Dean, warm and safe, Cas had never felt more real, more human. Slowly, carefully, he reached out one hand and placed it on Dean's thigh, unsure if Dean would freak out and push him away. He was terrified Dean would rebuke him and tell him he'd overstepped. He’d be right to - Cas was absolutely overstepping.
"You're biased," Cas informed him, patting him on the knee. It was a touch - casual and platonic, and it didn't help quell anything.
wine, sir," Sam said, presenting the bottle with a flourish and then pouring a little into Dean's glass for him to taste. Dean gulped it down, barely registering whether or not it tasted good. He wasn't much of a wine drinker, but any alcohol would do when it was being handed to him.
"I don't know. Hair products and Celine Dion? Really loud sex when I'm trying to re-watch Game of Thrones? Maybe I could buy a stack of apology cards for his first week in his new neighbourhood? Soundproofing for their neighbours?"
Sam had quickly gone from amusement to bemusement. Unfortunately it only lasted seconds before he was back to grinning at Cas with such delight that Cas was starting to look constantly suspicious.
Dean made quick work of stripping the bed, pulling the cases off the pillows, and rolling it into one nasty ball to be washed or possibly burned at a later date.  The room was clean, Rowena had put away her spell stuff already, and there was nothing left to do.  He sat down on the edge of the bed, running his fingers along the mattress and sighing.  What he wouldn’t give for something to fucking
When Cas returned, he had on a pair of loose jeans and a tight long sleeve t-shirt that he had pushed up the arms of.  It was a deep blue that offset the brilliance of his eyes in a way that couldn’t be an accident.  Claire had trailed behind, never straying far from Cas’ side and now laid down in the corner of the kitchen, out of the way.
“Oh.” Dean ran his hand over his mouth, rubbing absently at his scruff, which has grown in after a few days in the infirmary. “Well, I don’t know what else to do.  I don’t remember well enough to tell you what I need. I have to look around, do the research.  I’ll find it, but I need to get in there.”
He tasted blood.  He tried to look up at his angel but when he moved his head, Cas hit him again before pinning him in place and thrusting deep and hard into Dean.  The lubricating grace Cas had always used with him before faded away, leaving nothing but raw skin as Cas pushed himself deep into Dean’s body.
