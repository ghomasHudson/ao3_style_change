“How do you get women to take off their trousers then?”
“Because it means someone else dressed him.”
John watched her until the door clicked shut. He turned on his heel and walked into the bathroom. Sherlock heard the shower run a moment later.
“If you could keep the clichés confined to your blog…”
“Honestly, I don’t know.”
“Oh, yes! My dilemma. Well, the thing is, you’re early Mr. Holmes. I had a much better surprise planned for you, but it’s not ready yet. This little chance encounter has rather thrown a wrench in the whole thing.”
“I don’t—”
John cringed at the memory. Couldn’t he have waited until Sherlock left the room?
“No. Which probably means we’re on the right track.”
He considered his options. What had Mary done when John’s nightmares woke her? (Of course they would have woken her; John’s nightmares were violent and they shared the same bed.) Probably something like putting her arms around him, cooing comfort, stroking his hair and soothing. Sherlock frowned. This course of action was fraught with problems, the foremost being that Holmeses do not coo, under any circumstances. Plus, John would wake up yelling about not being gay again, and the commotion would probably cause the neurotic old lady in the next room (yes, he knew all about her: the science of deduction) to bang on their door, ironically shouting at them for making a disturbance. So that was out.
But he decided he would let this one go. When dealing with Sherlock Holmes, John had learned to pick his battles. Because if he hadn’t, well, he would have lost his sheep a long time ago.
Sherlock stopped short and swung himself up onto the fence. He scaled it swiftly, climbed over, and dropped down on the other side. John didn’t need to be told to follow. Sherlock pulled a small torch from his pocket and they began to wander among the graves.
“I might be willing to reconsider.”
Sherlock waved his bow once over his shoulder in acknowledgment. And he began to play.
“Erm…”
John grinned. “The first one was a bit plain.”
He had completely forgotten—and he had the work party tomorrow night. He groaned inwardly. He’d promised Sandra, his colleague at the surgery, that he would go. Time moves differently when you’re with Sherlock Holmes. It was easy to forget which month it was, let alone which day.
John froze as Sherlock moved, shifting his hips closer, knee sliding further between his legs. He rested his hand on John's waist and John swallowed hard. But Sherlock settled and resumed the same pattern of steady breathing. Relief uncoiled the muscles that had tensed, prepared to spring back in an instant.
shouldn’t have survived. Anyone with even marginally less strength would have died. He himself had been at death’s door, actually flatlining for six minutes before he had somehow managed to fight his way back. How? Why? It wasn’t fair. A few more minutes and it wouldn’t have been possible. A few more minutes and the doctors would have stopped trying. A few more minutes and right now John would still be in love with her. She would be the doting wife, comforting her husband. And he would have adored her for it, the way he did when they first started dating.
“Mary Morstan,” Sherlock said, emphasising her last name.
His head was spinning but he felt good. He had accomplished what he’d set out to do. He had killed Sebastian Moran—one of Moriarty’s most trusted accomplices. There was now one less dangerous criminal in London trying to kill Sherlock. It was the least he could do for him before he would have to go.
John was walking on soft grass surrounded by thick fog. He couldn’t see more than a metre in front of him. He couldn’t hear his footsteps. For a long time he couldn’t hear anything.
The case had two features of interest: Ricoletti's unsolved suicide and Moriarty’s return, of course. But upon closer inspection there was a third, far more interesting feature, and that was John Watson. He was the conductor of the whole mad escapade, the focal point around which all sides of the dream turned.
Sherlock smirked down into his microscope. “‘Interesting business technique’ might be the best euphemism for illicitly drugging people I’ve heard in a while.” John scuffed his shoe on the rug, torn between pleasure at the compliment and concern that his morally bankrupt flatmate was rubbing off on him.
Hang on. He had almost forgotten. The
“People don’t normally take off their trousers in front of two strange men,” John commented, feeling the need to point out the crux of their problem.
“What I said just now
It was about John. Obvious.
, how had they ended up like this? Granted he had been used to sleeping with another person for the majority of the past three years and he supposed he might have the unconscious muscle memory to cuddle up to a body next to him, but
“John—”
The mention of the name set them off snickering again, and it was only by deep inhales and slow exhales through his nose that John managed to calm himself.
Sherlock did turn now. “Did you think I didn’t?”
Sherlock’s grip was loose and John was able to spin around underneath him so that he was on his stomach. Before Sherlock could put enough pressure on him, John pulled his knees under him, and pushed up and back against Sherlock, throwing him off and standing.
Gently he untangled Sherlock’s hands from the chain. “Can you stand?”
She grinned and stood up. “Both. He is a powerful man.”
fault.
“Of Amy Elliot.”
heard that phrase before. That’s definitely not a phrase.”
"Sherlock, you're cheating."
He felt his airway cut off. He had roughly fifteen seconds left of consciousness. Two minutes until death. He wouldn’t have minded nearly so much if it wasn’t for that persistent problem of desperately wanting to continue to live a life that had John in it.
“I didn’t pay for it,” Sherlock said.
“Do you know any of these men?” Sherlock asked quickly, holding his phone down under the table where they’d placed their empty drink glasses. He swiped through the pictures of David Rodgers, Neil Parker, Brandon Riley, and Tony Bauer. John knew the pictures would be necessary for Alexa to recognise them if the men didn’t use their real names for 'appointments.'
Sherlock gave John a look that suggested he was being unsympathetic. John avoided it by ducking into the kitchen to make tea.
“I don’t have a girlfriend.”
“You cheated.”
"Thank you." John glared.
He looked down at the two pieces of destroyed pillow in his hands, and at Bonkers and Minnie, playing around his feet with the little puffs of cotton that had fallen to the floor.
When John finally dropped down heavily into his bed he was forced to notice that his sheets were not nearly as warm as a detective.
With considerable effort Sherlock dragged his attention back to his laptop. Using Mycroft’s money to buy the chemicals had solved this particular problem, but Mycroft—or more accurately Mycroft’s minions—would be examining his accounts at any moment, and he expected he would be in for a lecture. Sometimes he wished Mycroft were more old-fashioned. Sherlock could tolerate most traditional forms of torture better than he could withstand a lecture about responsibility from his brother.
“Sherlock? Are you all right?”
“Here’s the deal, Mr. Holmes. I’m a very busy man. Loads of evil to do.” He winked at Sherlock. “I’m going to take my associates and my snipers now. But I will leave you with one of my bodyguards here.”
He kicked a pair of handcuffs aside and stepped over a teacup. He was annoyed by the flat’s illogical ability to be oppressively cluttered and yet feel empty at the same time. It was too quiet. He went to the windowsill and unlatched his violin case. The beautiful Stradivarius was easily the most valuable item in the flat.
“I have full faith in your logical faculties,” John said, turning on the tap.
Sherlock turned back to look at the door he had just come through. He was neither gratified nor surprised to see a sniper, gun drawn and ready, now filling the opening.
“Why would someone want to kill her?”
Sherlock laughed. “Maybe a fruit basket stuck through with knives. That seems their style.”
“Because you owe me a favour, Sherlock, and I’m asking you to stop.”
John was hoping for more of an explanation, but Sherlock merely hummed his agreement, tilting his head as he slipped off on another train of thought.
“No,” Sherlock said abruptly, sitting up in his chair.
Sherlock stood still for a moment. It was annoying that John was still angry about the suicide hoax. He thought they had settled that a long time ago. Sherlock had tricked John into forgiving him in a bomb Tube car, hadn’t he? So why had John continued to think about it? He wasn’t supposed to continue to think about it.
Sherlock grunted in response. Leave it to her to point out the one pleasant part of a nightmarish day. The old landlady was surprisingly good at Boggle. He would have to invent an excuse to get her to play it with him again.
“Sherlock,” John said in his best warning tone before looking back up at their landlady. “What can we do for you?”
John sighed and Sherlock felt his chest rise and fall. "I'm going to have to leave soon," he murmured.
Well, this time John wasn’t here. The doctor was safe, miles away at some goldfish party.
He meant to turn and walk away; he was late already. But something about the song… He hadn’t heard this one before. And the way Sherlock was playing… There was a weight to it, an insistence, as though it were crying out to be heard. Was it possible to play a song so that it demanded attention more than another song? John didn’t know anything about the violin, but he felt himself pulled forward and he stepped back into the doorway soundlessly, not wanting to interrupt, not wanting Sherlock to stop playing.
Mary felt her lips tightening. “I don’t know where he is now.”
John threw his coat on. “You’re really incredible, you know?”
“It was lovely to spend the day with you, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson beamed. “Let’s do it again sometime, shall we?”
will prove to be their fatal mistake.”
“What?”
Sherlock looked at him curiously.
“Stay here,” John barked as he flung open the cab door. “Keep the meter running I don’t care.” He ran toward the warehouse the GPS on his phone was indicating.
And in retrospect it
“Yes, it’s fine, sorry to bother you, thank you.”
He’d been so certain when he kissed John that he could handle it. But he had underestimated by far the strength of John’s reaction and the strength of his own. He'd thought he could tolerate the damage, withstand the impact. But upon being confronted with the reality of the destruction—the perfect organisation of his mind palace upended by the chaos of emotion—he couldn’t let it happen.
“That’s because you’re an idiot.”
"A and B died in a car crash on Monday, October eleventh. They were a couple and the families chose to do a joint funeral; I worked on them both. C died on Sunday. There was a break-in at his flat and he was shot, maybe you heard about it."
John grabbed his gun and his blood ran cold as he remembered emptying the bullets. But there was no time to waste on frustration or regret. Every second was vital now, and it took him less than one to form an alternate plan. He flipped the gun in his hand and smashed the window with the pistol. Glass rained down around him as he leapt into the warehouse. The thick soles of his desert combat boots hit the concrete floor and he crouched low to absorb the impact—army drills had made the action automatic, faster than memory.
And, in a déjà vu moment from a restaurant two years ago, John lunged at Sherlock, sending them both crashing to the ground.
"Hypoperfusion,” John cut in. “The organs don’t receive enough oxygen, the body goes into shock and shuts down.”
And then tonight: “I will stay in. I will make pasta. I will eat it.”
He didn’t wait long. Sherlock was striding across the field and stopped just in front of him. Too close. It was always too close. His coat was unbuttoned. He was wearing one of his more flattering suits (as though the wanker owned an unflattering suit) with a grey shirt underneath, deep blue scarf hanging loosely around his neck. He stuffed his gloved hands into his coat pockets. John, in his rugby kit—knee-high black socks, black athletic shorts, and a red and black striped shirt—set his jaw and didn’t step back. He had the spikes on his rugby boots dug into the grass, good traction if he needed to knock Sherlock over. (He really might need to knock Sherlock over.)
Not really an answer.
“No change? What do you mean, ‘no change’? Explain immediately.”
Sherlock’s mouth parted in surprise. He had not anticipated this turn in the conversation. Although it was hardly a pleasant topic, Sherlock couldn't help feeling a twinge of pleasure at receiving further evidence that John was one of the few people he knew well who could continually surprise him.
—” Lestrade started.
This was not a good time. “Hey, just shut up.”
Sherlock glared. “I
It couldn’t be possible and yet it had to be, because Sherlock was lying under him now looking at John like he might want him just as much. But still the idea seemed to jam the gears in his head. He couldn’t believe Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes, the man who scorned all forms of affection, especially physical—could want this, could want this with
It seemed like a year that it was just Mary’s voice. She was telling him she loved him. He wished she would stop. He couldn’t hear the entirety of what she was saying but certain sentences came through clearly.
Mary opened her mouth to protest and then closed it again. It was no use. Looking at the insistence in John’s face—his mind entirely occupied by one track—she could see the truth. Sherlock would always be John’s priority. She and Sherlock had been the two people John loved most in the world, and now that she was out of the running it was only Sherlock. And, if she were being truly honest with herself, it had probably always only been Sherlock. John had only started up with her when he thought Sherlock was dead. And in those years everything John did—his actions, his words, his gestures, his abstracted expressions—everything was shot through with Sherlock’s memory. Even his proposal to her had referenced him: “
Sherlock struggled to sit up. His body didn’t cooperate. The air felt heavy around him, intensified gravity pinning him in place. But the man at the table seemed to sense his wakefulness. He stood and walked to the side of the bed.
She grinned conspiratorially. “It really is wonderful to have you back, John.”
Sherlock turned to give John a scathing look. “I am arguably the best chemist in England and I specialise in poisons. I had an idea what to look for.”
“You may also be interested to know that the girl who died in the car crash—Amy Elliot—has traces of the poison in her blood.”
But Sherlock was quiet.
“The Woman.”
Harriet was five years older. The age gap was too big when they were young. From the day they brought him home his parents had made her the babysitter.
Mycroft smirked with cold eyes. “The respect is mutual, brother dearest.” His voice went dangerously quiet as he added, “Although
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said with unaffected expression. John felt the deep register of his voice resonate in his chest. “I should have told you I was alive.”
socks.”
John had not meant to choose that moment, of all moments, to suddenly decide consulting detectives were for kissing rather than biographing. And now there would be consequences. It would all depend on Sherlock’s behaviour when he got home. John had debated waking him up in the morning, eventually deciding it would be best for both of them to have the day off—a little time to sort themselves before any commentary on last night’s events would have to take place. Maybe, if John was really lucky, Sherlock wouldn’t say anything at all, and they could pretend it never happened.
so much as a blogger. How did bloggers fair with poetry? Sherlock didn’t know.
he would survive your attempted murder. Where’s your medal?”
“You’re an idiot for just walking in like that. The plan was underdeveloped. I’d almost call you a genius for pulling off something as brilliantly stupid as that.”
“Very nice,” John said, looking around. “Not a bad idea, hm?”
Mycroft had thought. It was the hardest lesson to learn.
As he walked back through the stuffy, silent Diogenes Club John thought about how satisfying it would be to bring in an air horn and shock those white toupees right off.
he repeated slowly enough to make the threat implicit.
John turned over, body humming with exhaustion from the long night. As he fell asleep it only vaguely occurred to him that he
of all people. It’s true he could put up with Sherlock’s moods better than most, but he certainly hadn’t been Sherlock’s only option. Molly, for example, had always been an option. And now that Sherlock was internet-famous he had fan clubs worth of options. But he’d never shown the slightest inclination toward anyone else.
“If there’s any way I can repay you, I’m in your debt.”
“Can you just, er, tell Mrs. Hudson I’m ill or something?”
John grinned. “Jasmine rice, yeah I bought it today.”
Pause.
“Shit!” John yelled, jumping back as blood pooled in his hand. “What the motherfuck—”
He couldn’t kill Moriarty; Moriarty was already dead. It had taken Sherlock Holmes to kill him, and it would take Sherlock Holmes to stop the aftershock too—the waves rippling through England that the consulting criminal had put in motion before he died.
“I’m not naked,” John said, feeling his face get hot.
“Clearly,” Lestrade muttered sarcastically.
occasional ‘bloody,’ and one unforgettable ‘arsehole,’ uttered at his
She blushed. “Well, you know, it was for John. I was happy to help.”
Sherlock’s thoughts began to whir. John was right. He could redesign. If he could work his feelings for John into the very structure of his mind palace he could control them.
“Go to whatever asinine event you were going to.”
“Really?” She arched her eyebrow at him.
John’s eyes flashed up at her. He opened his mouth to protest, but bit it back, remembering his promise.
Lestrade wished he could say his relationship with Sherlock had warmed after the incident at the hospital, but really it hadn’t. The only noticeable difference afterward was that Sherlock plainly preferred to work with him, being almost
John gaped. A hundred questions vied for the spot in his mouth but the strongest won out. “Sherlock has another brother? Sister?” Complete disbelief rang in his tone. “There are
Sherlock shoved John back.
“Shut up,” Molly snapped.
He knew what it was, that sense of uneasiness. It was a memory. The memory of the last time Sherlock had agreed to do what John asked too quickly.
John groaned and sat up. He looked at Sherlock directly and said, “The way you did it, the way you ‘committed suicide,’ you made it seem like it was my fault.”
John was jolted out of his revere this time by the realisation that he’d actually torn the pillow in half. He blinked at it, anger slowly draining.
There was John, about five years old, on the beach in Brighton smiling shyly at the camera, parents kneeling on either side of him. John, about ten years old sitting in the grass in a rugby kit, looking up at the camera, the picture taken before he was told to smile. John, about fifteen in a white t-shirt on the front steps of his old house, leaning against the railing, glaring at the camera, etc.
“Sherlock,” Molly said carefully. Was it possible he didn’t know? Had his brother not told him? “You do know John’s been in a coma since they brought him here, don’t you? He’s here. Or at least he was this morning.”
The DI turned toward the door and stopped just before reaching it. “And
“Yes, and?”
When John had walked into the lab the day they met Sherlock had immediately been struck by John's voice.
John sucked in a deep breath. The MIA status was nothing unusual for his intractable flatmate. However, it was more common for Sherlock to disappear without a word than it was for him to bother lying. The fact that he’d lied meant there was something he was hiding. The thought made his stomach want to roll over in protest. Because John’s past experience with Sherlock lying to him—it tended to end spectacularly badly. Semtex and swimming pools and rooftop phone calls.
“Did you see the way he was dressed? His suit wasn’t just nice; it was fashionable. Extremely so. New Zegna from the autumn collection.”
“I didn’t kill him! I knew he’d be all right-”
John had no idea why Sherlock had lied to him tonight, but he knew the detective well enough to know he would have some kind of ridiculous, Sherlogical reason for it. John would do his best to get it out of him tomorrow, and scold him thoroughly for it, but tonight…
Sherlock almost laughed out loud. He'd had no idea. Sherlock Holmes—the detective of detail, the master of minutia—he actually hadn't noticed. He never bothered paying attention to what he ate. Food was at the bottom of his list of interests along with golf and poetry. He closed his eyes and saw clearly the meals he ate reappearing on their table and the meals he didn't failing to do so.
And standing there, holding on to each other in the living room of 221B as though it were just the two of them, as though there weren’t eight million people rushing through the city around them, John knew he had never been happier. His wedding day didn’t come close to this—just this moment, standing here with Sherlock pressed close, and the promise of more, the promise of everything. Everything from the way Sherlock would look when he let John take him to bed and take him apart, to the new cases and clients and gunshots and blog posts: their life. It would be their life as it always had been but now without bars and barriers—enhanced, free to be all it could be: research and experiments and fieldwork and Barts and bickering and the violin and sex. Whenever Sherlock didn’t have a case John fully intended to make his head spin in a different (but he hoped no less enjoyable) way. (He hadn’t earned a reputation over three continents for being just mediocre in bed.)
“Right,” John said, deflating. “I get it.”
"Ok, I'll trade you wheat for wood," John replied patiently.
“And you were?”
She pressed a button and soon there were more nurses in the room followed by John's doctor. Mycroft murmured instructions to one who grudgingly agreed. They were not in a normal hospital, and the staff were required to follow orders by those who outranked them. Mycroft outranked most people.
“Sherlock,” John’s voice broke through. “What’s wrong? Who was that? Sherlock?”
“I wasn’t laughing at you,” he said, knowing this was the unquestioned answer John needed to hear. John looked back at him, waiting. A step in the right direction but it wasn’t enough. He’d already apologised. Apologising again wouldn’t have any further effect. He needed to give John something in return for what he’d told him. It was the only way.
anyone. They had almost a year together before she died.
“The poison interests me,” Sherlock was saying. They were walking toward Hyde Park to catch a cab home from the victim’s neighbourhood. “Whoever murdered David Rodgers didn’t want the police to find it, hence the stabbing. Such an obvious cause of death wouldn’t require an autopsy. Might have worked if they were dealing with the usual idiot circus at Scotland Yard. There’s something about that poison they don’t want the police to see.”
“Hm,” Sherlock said, moving over to his music stand.
John looked down at their hands in surprise. Sherlock didn’t let go.
He was just beginning to wonder if anyone here (especially a certain mad scientist who insisted on getting him into scrapes) had any kind of plan at all, when she was suddenly jerked out of his arms. John’s eyes flew open, shocked to see Sherlock roughly forcing her back. He shook her and John automatically stepped forward to intervene. Sherlock brushed him off, shaking her again. He raised his hand to hit her and John nearly yelled out when he heard her say quietly, “Find the bastard who hurt my Karina. Kill him.”
John was still looking away, preoccupied. “Always,” he said lightly.
Mrs. Avery was terribly polite about John's mistakes.
“I—” John dropped his hand and gripped Sherlock's arms to steady himself as he swayed on his feet.
is fascinating, is it not? You, the man who defies all categories—even inventing your own profession to avoid being labelled anything ordinary—you find yourself irresistibly attracted to the system you reject. What’s more categorised, labelled, more controlled than a soldier?”
obvious. It had been obvious to everyone but the two of them all along. There had never been anyone more important to him than Sherlock Holmes, and hadn’t some part of him always known there never would be?
John reached to feel his neck, to check the extent of the swelling, but with quick reflexes Sherlock caught his hand, giving him a hard look. Severe pain confirmed.
“What?”
“No. Far too many possible side-effects and risk factors. Monroe’s doesn’t want its clients coming back with health complaints. What’s in here”—Sherlock tapped the tube against his palm—“is a variation on the same concept. The pharmacology has been manipulated to make the drug milder, and much safer. There’s an expert chemist somewhere in the works…” Sherlock trailed off, thinking.
“He’ll be fine,” Sherlock replied dismissively. “He’ll have worse happen than getting a picture taken of his legs.”
The finale of the song was a furious whirlwind of ecstatic notes and Sherlock tore through it as though he could tear it apart. When he hit the final note of the concerto he let it ring through the stillness of the room before opening his eyes and lowering his bow.
For anyone else these details wouldn’t amount to much, but in the case of Sherlock Holmes it was ample evidence that the world’s only consulting detective was downright smitten.
John glowered. “Ok, how about Britain’s oil interests in the Middle East? How’s that going?”
was flashing mutely on the telly. John was intensely curious about how Sherlock was going to get them from here to a view of Tony’s bare legs. But Sherlock had been silent during the cab ride, which John knew meant he would (once again) have to find out in real time.
No, this card problem more likely had to do with Sherlock’s inability to recall collecting payment from any of his clients recently—he had just as much difficulty remembering trifling facts as he did unpleasant ones—and if John had done it the cheques must be somewhere in one of these piles that were taking up his worktop space. The thought of rifling through all the papers in 221B to find some old cheques was appalling enough that Sherlock shuddered.
And they hadn’t known each other long enough—a little over a year—for John to have been as utterly destroyed as he was when Sherlock died. How could someone he had never known for twenty-nine years have woven himself so entirely throughout him in such a short time? To the point that John felt himself torn in half when Sherlock was gone? Sherlock was brilliant, unique, unearthly in many ways but it was more than that. His loss had paralysed John completely. It had blown him apart, leaving him an empty shell of himself for years—longer than he'd even
“You’re avoiding me,” Mary said.
“Just because he’s dead doesn’t mean he won’t make the next move.”
“Come on, Sherlock,” he said, knocking his hands away, “lay off; I told you I’ll do that myself later.”
"Do you want breakfast before you leave? No? All right. I have rugby practice this afternoon."
“‘Almost’ being the key word.”
“Thanks,” John said, tucking his gun into his jacket. He knelt down and checked for a pulse: none. He furtively moved the man’s arm, checking for a squash ball (just a nervous habit he’d picked up): none.
(See the end of the chapter for
The silence that had engulfed Sherlock broke. There was roaring in his ears as cascades of Feelings crashed through his mind. He let them sweep him away. He let go and let them carry him. Because the truth was, as tightly controlled as he kept his mind, he liked to let go. He liked to relinquish control and allow himself to be swept along by a current stronger than himself. In the past he had needed drugs for that. Now he needed only John.
John wondered which security guards got the job of watching the women have sex all night.
“It’s incredible,” John marvelled. He had always known Sherlock’s childhood must have been nothing short of extraordinary. “So you think—that night in the street—you think he was speaking Czech?”
It was nice to see him looking cheerful now, the lines of tension in his face smoothed away.
She didn’t respond.
But John spoke immediately, “No, it doesn’t matter. That’s the point. That’s why I didn’t want to—was never going to say anything. Because it’s all so unbelievably stupid. You were never going to kill yourself.” John shook his head. “You didn’t need me to tell you anything. And now that I know I’m glad I didn’t say more, because I would have looked that much stupider.”
where they were. He had searched the entire flat looking for them. Sherlock was in the kitchen in a flash, inspecting the dishwasher door. The cunning woman had known he wouldn’t find it there. Sherlock examined the compartment; he hadn’t known it existed, let alone that it opened. What was it for? Soap? Bleach? A very small dish?
is for the progress of science,” Sherlock replied. “There is nothing scientifically productive about poor hoovering.”
Leaning back against the wall, John absorbed the information with the rain.
Sherlock had watched John’s recovery carefully. He'd been pleased on Sunday that John had felt strong enough to go out, and he’d wasted no time in following him that day, and each one after. He could have asked to walk with John, but he’d already deduced John would interpret the offer as a form of mollycoddling (which he supposed it was) and refuse anyway. On Monday it was clear that John had much of his strength back, and Monday night had been spent in furious internal debate. But he'd come to a decision in the early hours of the morning.
Mary’s eyes welled up with tears. She’d been expecting this for so long, but now that it was happening she felt defenceless, shattered.
Thick, course hair combed back, silvering dark brown: bold confidence excludes the need for hair dye. Successful military career. Ex-colonel. Married. New mistress approximately every four months. Cunning: deep understanding of human behaviour translates to great skill in manipulation. The dangerous kind of amoral. Certainly on the psychopathy scale. Regular brandy drinker and cards player reveals old-fashioned conservatism. Compulsively organised. Fiercely competitive. Devoutly materialistic.
“It’s horrible”—Sherlock glared out into the garden—“I hate it. I want it to go away.”
It had never been for Mary though, had it. Sherlock didn’t care about Mary. It had been for John. Sherlock’s pressure point. In the moment Sherlock shot Magnussen the consulting detective had chosen John over his work. He’d known he would be sent away. He’d known there was a chance he would never be able to work in England again. And he’d done it not even to save John’s life. He’d thrown away his entire career only to prevent John from losing his wife: for John’s happiness.
John couldn’t believe it had taken him this long to understand. This was Sherlock prioritising him. A high-functioning sociopath’s way of proving over and over again that there was nothing more important to him than John. He couldn’t empathise with him, but he could prioritise him.
“Why are you asking me, Mr. Shag-a-Lot Homes?” John returned, referring to one of the many headlines that had come out in the tabloids the week Janine had taken her story to the press.
“I’m retired.
But right now the information was more important. He would have to threaten Billy with more than a sprain some other time.
“I suppose,” Sherlock drawled, “there’s no point in simply telling you to go away.”
John was fascinated by him, and he was fascinating to Sherlock. And suddenly there was a reason to focus again. In John’s eyes the intrigue of the cases was heightened, and in John’s blog there was a better version of himself than had ever existed. Within days John Watson had drowned out the whispering words of his addiction almost completely, and for the first time someone’s praise had resonated in his mind loudly enough to fight back even the worst of the bad thoughts that seeped into his mind in the nights without heroin.
Sherlock lowered the papers and tossed his head back dramatically. "Yes, that's what I said. Why do you go to work?"
John knelt beside him as ant after ant crumpled under the heat.
“Now we have a name: Sebastian Moran.”
John rolled onto his back and spoke incoherently. Although Sherlock couldn’t make out any individual words, the distress in his voice was cutting. Sherlock started to reach out, but pulled his hand back. If he woke him, John would be embarrassed and upset and Sherlock wouldn’t know what to say.
Sherlock hesitated in the doorway. He knew it wasn’t really John. It was only his mind’s image. But still he hadn’t seen him since—since the episode in the kitchen and he found even an incorporeal John caused his throat to tighten, making it difficult to swallow.
"No," John said, unamused. "I mean
Except none of it was Sherlock’s fault, he scoffed inwardly at himself. It was his own fault for
“It’s not Sherlock’s fault. The situation is what it is. You both care for John. Tough tits. You’re going to have to find a way to deal with it that doesn’t involve killing each other.”
Sherlock stared at him blankly. John gave up and held out his right hand. Sherlock grasped it firmly, aware of John’s eyes darting to his face. He took the knife from behind his back and slashed it quickly, shallowly, across John’s palm.
John blinked down in surprise. “Are you saying you love me?”
Sherlock Holmes was in trouble. And not the fun kind either. He paced the living room of 221B Baker Street with his hands clasped behind his back, occasionally throwing dirty looks at his laptop. Normally he liked trouble, sought it out even. It thrilled him to push his luck to the last, relying on the speed of his calculations under pressure... or sometimes relying on John to intervene and shoot someone.
“Dirty trick, Sherlock,” John hissed.
A full sentence: “John, I’m sorry.”
“When I came back to London and I said I didn’t contact you because I thought you’d say something indiscreet.”
were blurring, had always been blurred. With Sherlock it had always been
“Then that means you’re done doing genius things tonight?”
Throwing on his jacket, John stopped on the landing as achingly beautiful notes floated through the door and wrapped themselves around him. He stayed for a minute, listening, and then he quietly pushed the door back open. He could see Sherlock still facing away toward the window—graceful movement of sharp shoulder blades.
He chose not to rise to the bait this time. "Or," he said, "I could get ready for work, which is actually what I need to be doing."
They dissolved into giggles.
him— John cut off the train of thought abruptly, first because he was at work, and second because Sherlock wasn’t like that.
Sherlock was still and John didn’t even bother getting his arms into a grip. “I divorce myself from my emotions by locking them out of my mind palace,” he explained. “My mind is precisely organised and there’s chaos if emotion gets in.”
John would have raised an eyebrow at such a marked lack of the detective’s usual eloquence, but actually it was impressively clear for someone battling the all-consuming haze of heroin. He supposed he shouldn’t be surprised. Sherlock was high-functioning in every sense of the word.
Sherlock’s glare burned, but he didn’t reply.
“It was the quickest, most efficient way to get the information we needed,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock waited and finally John breathed. The deep inhale and long, shaking exhale had something to do with relief, panic, exhaustion, confusion, victory, and defeat.
“What on earth are you on about?” John asked, marvelling at his raving flatmate. And then more forcefully, “And what do you mean ‘should have been?’”
Sherlock was looking away again, preoccupied, and John knew better than to interrupt his thought process. It wasn’t until they stepped out of the cab onto a wide avenue just a few blocks from the park that Sherlock asked, “Did you say something?”
“But, why?” he asked. “I mean, obviously it’s good to save people; I’m not saying you shouldn’t have saved her—” he checked his rambling. He took a breath. “I didn’t know you cared about her so much.” John let his eyes hover on Sherlock’s back, hoping for an answer to the unasked question.
John smiled a bit as he read.
"No, Mrs. Hudson," John said with audible strain in his voice. "I'll give her a call. Thanks."
Sherlock held up his hand. “Listen.”
Sherlock eyes widened just perceptibly. His lips quirked to a small smile as he turned to look out the window.
"You’re sure they weren’t self-inflicted? I’ve seen scarring like this before. The location is right for it, upper-thighs makes it easy to hide—"
Alexa stood in front of John’s chair and reached out her hand. He took it uncertainly and allowed her to pull him to his feet. She gave him a coy smile before stepping forward.
John stepped backward. "What are you doing?"
John abandoned the scar and leaned up, braced on the back of the couch, hovering above Sherlock and looking down hard into his eyes. The detective’s eyes were scintillating: evidence of the ceaseless whirlwind of thoughts behind them, the constant burning energy that animated him, propelled him, allowed him to rush the air from a room merely by stepping in.
“I can read your thoughts before you’ve even entered the flat by your tread on the stairs. Do you think I don’t know when you lie?”
He looked at the time. It was only seven o'clock; his practice wasn't until the afternoon. He could do with a few more hours of sleep.
He shrugged. “If you stand up, they’ll shoot you.”
“And since when do ex-wives count as family?”
There. Cab. It pulled up and Sherlock sprang out of the car, unbuttoned coat flowing dramatically out behind him. Lestrade rolled his eyes. The man may as well cut the pretence and buy himself a superhero cape. John got out of the cab next, paying the driver and negotiating placement of suitcases. So John had been in Ireland too. He supposed Sherlock wouldn’t go anywhere without John if he had a choice. The two of them had been inseparable ever since the ‘Study in Pink’ case when he’d first met John.
“What kind of businesses?” John asked, maintaining partial awareness of the names moving past.
to make people happy.”
“Oh, by the way, Sherlock, do you remember Redbeard?”
John followed, grumbling, “I can do this myself
“Yes, sir.”
He did wish they had a lilo though.
Berlin. Sherlock thought she was still alive.
John swallowed. “Yes, I’m sure. Maybe another time.”
," Sherlock corrected, already walking back up the alley. "They can't resist a row in the street—Knew I'd get one. I have a question she’ll be able to answer.”
"Yes."
“You haven’t seen him?” she asked in utter disbelief.
model on the sideline who’s been watching you for the past ten minutes.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Keep your minions, Mycroft. You can’t control me.”
Sherlock realised his own jaw had tightened in imitation of his sleeping friend and though he consciously relaxed it, his concern increased. He’d been able to cure John’s nightmares the first time, but not the second. When Sherlock returned to London, and John resumed working with him, he assumed the nightmares would subside like they had before. But they hadn’t.
He smiled in disbelief. Sherlock knew his measurements. John had never told him. He’d gone up and down in weight in the last two years, but the suit was precise. John supposed that’s what you get when you live with a snobbishly fashionable consulting detective.
“Jesus, you people are all the same.
“What do you think, Lestrade?”
“I admit nothing. I’m just commenting that boxing is my preferred method of fighting.”
There had never been a good category in his mind for Sherlock. ‘Best friend’ had to do simply because there was nothing else to describe it. But after the age of twelve John had never had a ‘best friend.’ Friends were people like Stamford, or his rugby mates: people to see on occasion, to laugh with over beers. Bizarrely, despite his heterosexuality and their complete lack of physical intimacy, Sherlock had always been more like a lover than anything else. Their cohabitation, their attunement to each other’s rhythms, their jokes, their bickering and their fights, their practically shared finances, their mutual need for each other, the fierce protectiveness and loyalty Sherlock inspired in him, the electricity between them—it was nothing like a friend. Even ‘best friend’ fell short of whatever their connection was.
Sherlock grabbed fistfuls of John’s hoodie in return and shook him once hard. “Did you hear what I said? I did it for
“A front. For most patrons Monroe’s is just a strip club. For those who know better it’s a brothel. I would guess they sell drugs too. The two usually go hand in hand.”
“Or what?” one of the courser boys challenged him. “What are you going to do about it, toff? I’ll fight you!”
“Sherlock was a mistake,” he said.
“But—” Sherlock started.
Sherlock sighed, “Fine.”
John heard his own breath rough and heavy in his ears and was gratified to hear Sherlock panting from the effort as well. It seemed that John Watson, who would never hold a candle to Sherlock’s intellect, was a decent match for him physically.
“Stay here if you like,” Sherlock said, shuffling around the music sheets until he’d found what he was looking for, “but proper attire is no excuse.”
Just want to drop in to thank you for reading! All of your wonderful comments and kudos are validating the frankly shocking number of hours spent on this thing. Really they are (don't say it) truly (don't-) invaluable. :)
“It has nothing to do with ‘turning gay,’” she continued, anticipating his argument. “If you were attracted to him, it wouldn’t mean you suddenly like men when you never have. It would only mean you like
The notes rang out with such clear passion John wondered that anyone, even himself, could ever have thought this man unfeeling. Raw emotion poured from the violin now and John could feel it washing over him.
Sullivan lifted his eyebrows. “Ah, Sherlock Holmes.” He looked over at the dark figure across the field. “Better known as the reason you never come to the pub with us.”
John barely had a chance to get a good look at Sherlock before his flatmate collided with him. He was swept into a bone crushing embrace and John staggered back at the force of it. As soon as his muscles could react he leaned into Sherlock to steady them, wrapping his arms around the detective in turn. He felt Sherlock’s hands gripping the back of his coat in fistfuls—needy, desperate:
Sherlock wasn’t halfway through the sonata when John came clomping back into the living room.
Pause.
“I guess I’m going as well then.” Out of the corner of his eye Sherlock could see him flexing his hands the way he did when he was anxious.
“There was a horrible noise in the alley just a moment ago,” she said, bringing a tray with cups and saucers back from the kitchen.
As a very young child their parents had, for the most part, kept Sherlock close to home. He had private tutors and little interaction with children his own age or even other adults. Because Sherlock managed to offend nearly everyone who was unfortunate enough to cross his path, their parents wanted to reduce his contact with people as much as possible. He called his tutors idiots and his peers dumb and ugly. It did nothing to reduce Sherlock’s ego that he actually was better looking, smarter dressed (even as a small child), and cleverer than all of them. It might have done wonders for Sherlock’s ability to adjust if only he’d had glasses or plain brown eyes or perhaps even thinner hair.
Killing Moran would be the least he could do for Sherlock before he died.
“Wh-what? Who are you talking about?”
Sherlock pressed his palms into his eyes. He couldn’t hold back the floods anymore. He didn’t want to. He’d thought he would simply let go and deal with the consequences accordingly. He had been naïve. But how could he have known? He’d suffered through the disagreeable act of kissing in the past; he’d never experienced anything like what had happened in the kitchen today.
Sherlock regarded John carefully. There was a question he couldn’t ask—an answer he needed. He chose his words with precision. “I asked you to come back.”
“What?”
John raised his eyebrows, startled. “What if he hasn’t got a weapon?”
John didn’t respond.
“Sorry?” John startled at the abrupt change of subject.
When he turned around he found John asleep in the middle of the bedroom floor. He assumed it was because he knew in reality John was sleeping on the floor in the living room, but there was no need for this version to be sleeping on the floor as well. He had a perfectly good, queen-sized bed just a few feet away. Sherlock knelt down and put his hand on John's shoulder. John's eyes fluttered open.
His phone rang. Again blocked number. He swiped to answer it and slowly raised the phone to his ear.
Anticipating trouble on Sherlock’s first day of school Mycroft waited by the schoolyard until his brother inevitably got himself into a fight with about five other boys. Sherlock was irritating, yes, but these imbecilic, inferior children were not worthy of touching him, let alone hitting his (admittedly annoying) face. He didn’t care if it was Sherlock’s fault (he was almost certain it would be). If Sherlock was going to start fights, then the world had better understand that Mycroft was going to finish them.
He wondered how such a place could exist without the police knowing about it. Maybe they did know about it. But John didn’t have time to speculate about the level of corruption at Scotland Yard. They stopped at one of the doors.
“Right.” Lestrade knew this was a polite request for him to leave. He started to turn away but stopped. “Has Sherlock ever…” he trailed off for a moment. “Is this the first time this has happened?”
Sherlock was watching him, sharp, penetrating eyes seeming to read all that was in John’s mind, only waiting for him to come to the conclusion on his own.
John had gone upstairs to change his shirt or whatever goldfish do in preparation for a ‘pub night,’ and Sherlock grabbed his violin. The frustration of being kept from his work by bureaucratic nonsense was compounded by the discovery that he wouldn’t even have John to distract him from it. He needed an outlet. Since John and Mrs. Hudson had been very clear that target practice (involving John’s gun and the living room wall) was not a viable option, he figured the violin would have to do.
Tony looked over at the screen and Sherlock moved in a flash. He stepped closer to John and dropped his hand to John’s hip. John froze as Sherlock moved his hand up underneath his coat and layers until he felt the heat of it against the skin on his lower back.
Sherlock turned away from the living room window, ducking his head as Mycroft’s voice went dangerously soft. “You remember what happened last time?”
“Are you aware that Brandon had an unusual pattern of scarring on his thighs?” Sherlock asked quickly, lest John try to steal another in his line of questioning.
He smiled ruefully. It was comforting to know that Sherlock had such secure pillars of support in place. Between Molly, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and Mycroft, he would be taken care of. He would be ok.
of you? But—I mean, where—”
—to avoid
“If he wasn’t with me now he’d be finding some other way to get shot at,” Sherlock snapped. “At least when he’s with me I know I can die doing my best to protect him.”
John stepped back just enough to put his hand to Sherlock’s jaw, raising his face to meet his eyes.
Sherlock blinked once, and then without warning swept upward, catching the side of John’s face and kissing him firmly. John pulled a sharp breath in surprise, but he reacted quickly, meeting his lips, reaching his left arm around him to support him and twining his fingers into the curls at the back of his head with his right.
John shook his head. “Right, I’m having a shower.” But Sherlock probably didn’t hear him. He was already leaning over the side of the bed and pulling his laptop from his bag, probably to check the news for new murders.
“Sherlock what the HELL? You nearly just impaled me with a chair!”
— But John was here, saying it now, the intensity of his stare boring into Sherlock’s eyes. And he knew it was true the same way he knew John. He wanted to smile. Because he felt the same. Exactly the same. They were two soldiers with an intolerance for peacetime; they were meaningless, purposeless, without the war.
“John, you’re awake! Thank god you’re awake!” Mary gushed, throwing her arms around him.
John leaned on the back of his chair, staring at the message, thinking. Moran had had Sherlock in his grasp the other night at the warehouse. But he hadn’t killed him. Why? Was it possible they had let him go so he could try to save John? Some kind of test? John scoffed inwardly, it was more likely to ensure Sherlock would witness John’s death. That sounded more like Moriarty. Sick mind games.
John nodded and looked toward the window. He was clearly still shaken. Sherlock hesitated, uncertain how to proceed. He could be callous, would be if it were anyone else.
“He probably thinks we’re high.”
“Oh, well—well that’s lovely!” Mrs. Hudson trilled. “Thank you, Sherlock.”
John gave an incredulous laugh. “What?”
John grinned. He snapped a picture of the cup and saucer on the table and sent it to Sherlock with a message:
Sherlock had had the advantage of living with John, when he'd walked around the flat in t-shirts and pyjama trousers, but for others it would be hard to tell the state of John's figure under the nearly comical number of layers he wore. T-shirts under button-ups under jumpers under coats—a Victorian lady in January could hardly wear more clothing. He hadn't seen John wearing just one shirt in a while and it was… agreeable to know he was still in good form.
Their parents, who frankly were too old for a challenge like Sherlock, burned through the local agency’s list of nannies in record time, nearly despairing of finding any help at all when finally one arrived who was surprisingly resistant to Sherlock’s antics, and who Sherlock seemed to tolerate in return. Their parents had given up on disciplining him themselves, preferring to comply with his every whim rather than endure a tantrum when he was younger or try to win an argument with him when he was older. Mycroft was the only one who could win an argument with Sherlock, and Sherlock resented him doubly for it.
John shoved his hands back into his hair. He breathed, trying to ground himself as the oppressive fog threatened to envelop him. There was a light wind rippling the grass beneath his knees. He couldn’t feel it. He couldn’t feel anything. He wasn’t real; he was a shadow of a dream. There was nothing to keep the fog from flowing through him, erasing him. He was numb. He needed something to stabilise him, something that could prove he had solid form: mass and weight—something that could keep him whole even as his skin turned translucent and felt himself disappearing, becoming nothing more than the fog itself.
“Perhaps the boring teacher wasn’t so bad after all.”
Mycroft’s presence at Speedy’s was odd to say the least. He’d given John the file as he stepped out to take a call and John hadn’t decided whether he would tell Sherlock the truth or the lie even as he reached the top of the stairs.
But interestingly Sherlock's brain refused to go forward. John said he would leave. Sherlock hadn't liked it at all. But he would leave, eventually, wouldn't he? Mary was out of the picture now, but surely it was only a matter of time until the new girlfriend arrived. And the day he would move out to live with her.
She took it, blinking back tears. “I’m so sorry, John.”
He considered John’s words. Mycroft had never said it in those terms, but as a nine-year-old boy wasn’t that exactly how he’d interpreted it? Really it didn’t matter. Even as a child Sherlock had never blindly accepted a rule, not even one from Mycroft. He did his own research; he evaluated evidence on his own terms. Redbeard’s death had lent credence to his brother’s words, and with time he had come to see the soundness of the logic for himself. Sherlock had spent most of his childhood learning, rather bitterly, that Mycroft was usually right. And he wasn’t wrong about this either: Love is only weakness.
“So what’s your idea then?” John returned with an edge in his voice that Sherlock felt prickling the back of his neck. He narrowed his eyes.
“I’m not always at his place,” he said, chafing at the insinuation. “I haven’t seen him in weeks.”
“Well, Sherlock’s in Switzerland at the moment, so there’s no danger there.” John turned to leave.
“I’m the one who should be here. He married me for fuck’s sake!” Mary shrieked.
Sherlock’s bright eyes sliced toward him over the edge of the paper. "There are many things I could do. Just as there are many things
Semtex, snipers. The first nightmare had been the next night after the confrontation with Moriarty. But Sherlock didn’t understand it. After Moriarty left John had been fine…
John covered his face with both hands. He was
Quickly John shot the cameras blocking his path to the doors. He moved swiftly, stepping over Moran’s body and punching the button for the lift. It was empty when it arrived and he hit the button for the lobby.
“You almost didn’t survive the
Although he was glad to have revealed a hidden penchant for German classical music in John, he had flatly refused to play Wagner’s
magazine more closely than he resembled ordinary people. And he knew Sherlock made girls like Molly trip over their own feet. (John had gotten some very interesting requests for photographs on his blog from the—he was almost certain—entirely female Sherlock Holmes fan club.) But ‘beautiful’ was an odd word to use for a man. Although, John figured, if there were any man to use the more feminine adjective for, the one swanning around in his unignorably tight shirts, with his high cheekbones, pale skin, and dark eyelashes— John silenced the part of his brain attempting to point out the speed and ease with which he’d just listed Sherlock’s more attractive features. He’d spent the majority of the last five years in Sherlock’s company;
The grey light widened to an image of a darkened hospital room. It blurred into focus. There was a man sitting at a table across from his bed, pale face tinted blue by the glow of a laptop screen.
Sherlock was regarding him thoughtfully. “
Sherlock quirked a brow and Lestrade surmised that ‘options’ were not typically part of the elder Holmes’ plans.
“I’ll get you something for it.” John’s voice was rough from sleep.
“Yes, the flat across the way”—Sherlock pointed out the window indicating their victim’s flat—“Were they moving furniture recently?”
“I don’t want to hit you,” John heard his own voice dangerously low, a natural warning.
Sherlock was silent as John voiced what he’d deduced almost from the very beginning.
“Thank you for your time,” she said to Sherlock.
John had stormed into the flat earlier that evening. "Well, that's it, I'm not getting married."
John said he was wonderful and extraordinary and amazing. If someone like John could believe these things, then perhaps Sherlock’s ideas about himself weren’t entirely true.
“I need to see him.” John was looking around her distractedly, as though expecting Sherlock to appear in the doorway.
Sherlock frowned. “Tonight? No, I’ll have to go to Scotland Yard tomorrow to do research.”
There was a child kneeling in the grass with his back to him. John approached and the boy looked up. John’s breath caught in his chest. It was Sherlock. He couldn’t be more than ten years old, but with his shock of black, curly hair, his pale skin, his thin, wiry frame, and his eyes—there was no mistaking those irises. He was smartly dressed—dark trousers, white collared shirt under dark blue, cashmere jumper. His sleeves were pushed back to his elbows, shirt folded back over the cuffs of the jumper. John tried not to scoff—of course a ten-year-old Sherlock would already have a sense of fashion.
his protector, his saviour, his break in what had been an impenetrable wall of emotional and sexual disinterest
Sherlock didn’t look away from the article. “Clothes. Boring.”
According to the report, John had woken up in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and Tuesday had been spent testing his responses in the fleeting windows of consciousness that were to be expected as part of the recovery. The process of waking up was gradual—only brief periods of awareness in the beginning. But she was delighted to read that he’d been rapidly improving. As of earlier today, he was able to maintain awareness for over an hour, as opposed to the mere minutes he’d been able to manage at first. He’d recovered his motor responses completely, and the initial confusion and transient aphasia had mostly faded. After three days in a coma, with such quick recovery, John’s prognosis was very good.
At the time, he’d counted on John’s anger to distract him from the weakness of his explanation for why he hadn’t contacted him: ‘I thought you’d say something indiscreet.’ A pathetically weak excuse considering Sherlock trusted John with his life; of course he would have trusted him with a secret about his fake death. But he’d taken the risk, and it had worked. John’s anger had been blinding, and he hadn’t questioned Sherlock further about it.
“The lip gloss is then switched back at the end of the night to ensure only the pre-chosen guinea pigs are subjected to the drug. But what if someone else was exposed to the drug accidentally? Our killer had carefully planned his victims. He couldn’t abide a disruption.”
"You completely skipped the Peanut Brittle House!"
“Hm?” he responded, half asleep.
John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s wrist. His right wrist. That goddamn wrist. The one he reached for over and over in his dreams. The one he’d held on the street in front of Barts with his left hand, head spinning from shock and the realisation he couldn’t breathe, waiting for a pulse that never came…
“He says he’s working on it. God knows what that means.”
John stepped off the wall toward his friend, but he stopped. He looked back at the house. “I can’t.”
John raised his eyebrows. “Why do you think she’s dead?”
They were fixed on him now and John realised he was waiting for a response. Only Sherlock would genuinely inquire why he’d made a plan to see his friends. John sighed and turned to pull two mugs down from the cupboard. “Because, Sherlock, that’s what goldfish do.”
It was enough to shut Sherlock up. She hit ‘play’ and a sultry song with deep bass flooded from unseen speakers.
From his position on the dance floor Sherlock watched John closely over Mrs. Hudson's shoulder. He was doing all right, only occasionally fumbling the steps. He had the same stiff posture as he'd had during his wedding dance. Sherlock had
"We got Parker’s body in yesterday,” Hannah said, “and I just—I thought it was odd to see the scars again. Especially since they weren't related to the cause of death in either case.  I've prepped a lot of bodies and I've seen some weird stuff, but never twice, and in two separate cases, on two unconnected people..."
His grip on John’s forearm reflexively tightened.
John blinked at the word, hesitating. Could Sherlock really be asking him to stay… to
“Can I see it?” John indicated the laser pointer.
Sherlock moved from where he'd been watching John to stand beside him. "Watch my feet," he said. "Do what I do."
So, no, they wouldn’t talk about it. They wouldn’t have any conversation that would lead to the inevitable conclusion that John would have to leave. Not if Sherlock could help it.
“Ok…” John said.
He resumed playing. He couldn’t be interrupted right now, especially not by Mrs. Hudson’s prattling. He needed to think about John. He needed to focus. What would John say?
Sherlock had deceived them all into thinking he didn’t need this. But he did. He was human. Flesh and blood. It was so obvious and yet John had never seen it. He had always needed this. Touch. Physical connection. Warmth. Sherlock had always needed to be convinced he was loved. And John could convince him.
“Oh John!” Mrs. Hudson cried, walking up to him and clutching both of his hands in hers. “Sherlock told me you’ve moved back. I’m so sorry to hear you and Mary have separated!”
“Don’t go.”
Mrs. Hudson walked to the door, but she turned on her heel.
He gripped John’s hips, feeling the narrow firmness of them at the band of his jeans. He ran his hands up under his jumper as he kissed him, fingers feeling the sturdy form underneath—a map of flesh and bone Sherlock had memorised long ago—the strength in his elastic muscles. The water was threatening to rise above mid-calf and Sherlock held the sides of John’s face. He paused for a moment, just taking it in. John’s face: so familiar and so pleasing, smooth planes of honey skin, several shades darker than Sherlock's, the mouth that smiled or tightened in accordance with his moods, lips that shouted reprimands at him or pressed firmly against his own. There was nothing he wanted more than John Watson.
There was the ball. Sherlock was dancing. He was at the bar. He met Nathan and they decided it would be a good idea to drink every time they heard someone say something pretentious. The way home was a blur. Getting back into the flat was a blur. He didn’t remember saying goodnight to Mrs. Hudson.
He channelled his anger into his movement, allowing it to push him, strain his muscles aching with the need to fight. Sherlock thought he could do that? Sherlock had kissed
