Refusing to go on any of the thrill rides again, Cas suggests the Ferris wheel which is positioned in the middle of the carnival.
“Wonderful.”
“What I want to ask is this”, he picks up Cas’ hand, bringing it up between them. Warm green eyes look into blue ones and there is no doubt left in his body.
“I would like to see it very much”, Castiel answers with genuine excitement in his voice.
.”, he admitted and pressed his nose even deeper into Cas, breathing in the familiar smell. Fondly, Castiel turned his head ever so lightly and kissed the hazel hair beneath him. “We could move outside.”, he offered but Dean refused. “No, no. I wanna stay.”, and then Dean’s face was on Cas’ neck, planting easy kisses along the curve of his adam’s apple. “Yeah, staying in seems like a plan.”, Cas sighed, bathing in the attention of Dean’s lips, his hand wandering dangerously low down on Cas’ body but before they could pursue anything that would guarantee an offended face from Claire, they were cut short by Jody yelling: “Okay! I am informed that the dinner is ready and y’all had too much booze on too empty stomachs anyway, so, move people. Especially you, Dean”, Jody pointed a warning finger at him and then proceeded to guide the wedding party towards the entrance. “How does that sound?”, Castiel asked booping Dean’s nose with his own. “Perfect.”, Dean whispered, kissing him gently and slow as if they had every time in the world.
Snapping out of his nervous overthinking at the sound of Cas’ voice, Dean almost drops the ring and hastily puts it in his pocket.
(See the end of the chapter for
If Sam and Jack had noticed their behaviour, they didn’t mention it to them. These days, Cas would just come up behind Dean, putting his arms around him, as if it was the most natural thing. They shared looks and nights together. Dean felt like a teenager again. The kissing till you couldn’t breathe, the flushed cheeks, the panting and sweating and lingering thoughts. Dean felt alive, for the first time in a while. When he and Cas were together now, it was like before and vastly different at the same time. Dean’s jokes were the same and so was Cas rolling his eyes at him, but the kiss that would follow was nothing like before. Sitting on the couch, fingers entangled, watching TV together, as if nothing had happened, when so much had changed. Sam smiled at them sometimes, quietly to himself. Jack was glad their dads were finally happy. They had talked to Cas, after the whole ordeal with The Empty. Cas had told Jack parts of what had happened, and Jack didn’t pry. As long as everyone was happy and content, they were happy and content. No questioned asked. Only a tiny thorn bit in their heart. Dean didn’t really talk to them anymore. He didn’t even look at them most of the time. Jack wished they could just talk to Dean, make him understand that they loved him. That it was okay and that the past was the past. They just wanted to be around him like the others. But Dean avoided Jack, thoroughly. Cas had talked to him, Jack knew that. Cas said Dean needed time and that he was sorry. Hurt by his own actions and unable to process them. Jack stood in the living room. Scooby-Doo was on and Dean had nestled himself into Cas’ arm, half asleep. They didn’t want to interrupt them, but it looked so cosy and domestic.
, really see, and feel the world around him. Dean saw the marvel in his face, saw the childlike excitement and he couldn’t waste another thought on anything but that beautiful and incredible man in front of him, pulling him along, eager to see the world. Fine lines formed at his eyes as an askew smirk graced his face. This messy angel was quite something. Almost radiating happiness, Cas turned to him. “Good thing we bought these.”, he jerked at his new parker, rubbing the soft green fabric between his fingers. “Yeah, I know.”, Dean winked, acting grand. “I think I never saw you in anything like it.”, Cas continued, drawing the words long and mustering Dean’s new navy-blue duffle coat, thick wool with a hood and a soft inlet. Dean squinted at him. “Don’t need stuff like that in Kansas.”, he replied. “And since you brought it up, you are the one who has exactly five pieces in his wardrobe.”, Dean raised an eyebrow and Cas rolled his eyes at him again. “Do I have to remind you that that isn’t true? Not anymore.”, he intertwined his fingers with Dean’s more tightly.  Dean grinned. “Should’ve bought you a hat, now that I see the state of your ears, honeybee.”, Cas made an exasperated noise at the pet name, which made Dean laugh even harder. “I just wanted to compliment you, Dean.”, he said sullied, “But you make that abundantly hard.” “Oh, I’m sorry, sweetheart.”, Dean hauled Cas in, putting his arm around his waist as they walked next to the glistening river. Leaves rustling softly in the wind. “So, go on then.”, Dean prompted. “No.”, Cas said, expression somewhere between smiling and sulking. “I’m sorry, I promise not to say a word.”, Dean tried to make googly eyes with mixed results. “I just thought you looked very handsome in the new coat. It suits you. That’s all.”, Cas sighed, but pressed his body closer to Dean. “Thank you.”, Dean’s voice was low and warm and if he weren’t so fricking cold, he would’ve kissed Cas again. Dark blue night sky had made its way all over the horizon, draining out the last lights of the sun and the pink and orange clouds were now a greyish purple. The river glistened from the streetlights and the moon that spilled its ghostly light through the openings in the trees and the buildings around them. Hushed voices floated through the air, coming from the few people still outside. They walked in silence for a bit. A silence that comforted them both. Dean was still in thoughts about the question he had wanted to ask Cas, wanted to ask for quite a while now. Cas looked out into the world, blissful and happy. It seemed that everything he experienced with Dean was special. Even the most mundane things. Even their little fights. Unconsciously, he squeezed Dean’s hand a bit tighter.  The other, noticing the tiny movement, looked at him. “What are you thinking?”, Dean asked gingerly. “Mmh, not much. Just that it’s nice to walk here with you.” Dean couldn’t suppress a smile. “Yea, I think so too.”, he squeezed Cas’ hand back. Laughing and shaking his head, Cas closed his eyes. “Isn’t it crazy? I mean… who would’ve thought that we would ever...”, he stopped midsentence, apparently unable to word his thoughts or feelings. Dean nodded, he understood. “Me neither.”, he answered the question that hovered between them. “But I am glad, that we did.”, he continued, his voice raspy and full of love. “Me, too.”, Cas agreed. They had been strong; they had been honest, and this was their reward. Their time together spent in touches and glances and smiles. Time spent in the knowledge that they were loved in a way that no one ever loved them before. Neither of them could describe how it felt, it was simply overwhelming. “Maybe we should head back, we have to get up early tomorrow.”, Cas said brushing over Dean’s thumb with his own. “Just a little bit longer.”, Dean pleaded, a neediness in his voice, that Cas knew too well and couldn’t refuse. Cas smiled and let his head drop on Dean’s shoulder. He could never be close enough to his little human, he thought, nestling his nose into the scruffy fabric. “I really like that coat.”, he said calmly. “Mmh”, Dean murmured and sank into Cas’ touch. “And I really like you, Dean.”, Dean chuckled at those words. Cas sounded so chaste when he said things like that. “I really like you, too, Cas.”.
Sam spent the week leading up to the visit tiptoeing around Dean, who would roll his eyes and insist it wasn’t a big deal. The day before Cas, Charlie and Kevin were due to arrive, Sam spent the entire day watching Dean carefully, like he was afraid to make sudden movements or Dean would bolt. Eventually Dean went for a beer run just to get away from the Sam weirdness.
“Look, I didn’t want to bring this up when you were in the thick of it but…Cas called me. He’s been calling me. It seems like he really wants to talk to you but he told me he’s ‘respecting your space.’ I don’t know if you’re ready yet, but I wanted to let you know.”
“I believe the scent of burning marshmallows is the more typical scent around fires on a weekend at a cabin.” Dean nodded, his eyes following Castiel as he walked back inside the cabin. His face lit up as Castiel returned, opening a bag to show marshmallows, chocolate bars and graham crackers. “This activity came highly recommended.”
Castiel woke up the next morning, groggy. Dean was already awake, and watching him. “Morning, sunshine! It still blows my mind that you snore.” Dean told him. He sounded pleased that he knew this information.
They stopped at the cat litter section, Castiel liked to purchase a large quantity of it to donate to the local shelter where Trish worked during the day. He picked up the large bags two at a time and placed them on the base of the cart, his shoulders shifting with the effort.
“Hello, Dean. I’m ready to take a break, but I need to work late tonight to screen the print before tomorrow’s shows.” Castiel explained, pulling on his sweater.
“Beats me! I haven’t really done this before. Especially the whole…” Dean made the same gesture he made in the car, waving his hand between himself and Castiel. Castiel squinted at Dean as he wasn’t sure what that meant, and wondered if coffee would help.
“I mean I get it, Dean. Look at Swayze. He didn’t have a whole conversation about defining the relationship, him and Doctor Lady were just together. If action movies are your formative relationship examples, you either have bickering to dramatic kiss moment, or you skip that entirely and it’s a gauzily lit fridged wife. Wait-there’s also usually the homoerotic relationship with the best friend. Or maybe the villain. Ok, I think we’ve just unpacked a lot about you here, let’s take down some notes to review with your therapist.
“Cas, look-“
Dean rubbed a hand down his face, and winced. He turned the music up and tried to not feel Sam’s eyes boring into him.
“As I understand anniversaries are important, I’d like to note our next anniversary will be five years and the typical gift is items made of wood.” Dean suppressed a dirty comment, but then thought better of it, looking over at Cas gleefully, who was already smiling and dryly commented “Yes, I understand wood can also be a term for an erection, I believe I would like to not wait for our anniversary for that present.”
Dean nodded and let out a pent up breath. “That’s good. The books say that’s a good foundation. Aha! People are weird about the stuff they keep around. Any bets that this is human hair? They used to make the creepiest jewelry out of it.” He held up a shadow box with an intricate broach that on closer inspection was woven out of hair. “Not sure how restless this spirit is but-“
I am still getting the hang of the whole writing thing so I am going with shorter chapters. Originally I was thinking this would be two parts but it’s turning into 4.
When he was back in the bunker an in his room, he pulled his phone out and scrolled to his last text chain with Cas. Sam had been right about the lack of friends, he hadn’t talked to Cas in months but there weren’t many more recent message chains. He took a deep breath and tried to think of something to say and landed on ‘Hey’.
“I understand and I am truly sorry. I can get a ride home from Aaron’s uncle.” Dean made a hard shake of his head and began to pack his bags.
A human vacation. He spent his current days off visiting the animal shelter, going for walks, reading books. He thought about Dean’s dream he’d visited once, fishing on a lake. It had seemed pleasant. He obtained Aaron’s uncle’s contact information and made arrangements to spend three days in a small cabin perched on a small lake. He’d assured the owner a lack of internet would not be a problem.
Cas’s eyes crinkled and he tilted his head at Dean, as though the answer was obvious. Dean knew what this was about, but if he had to sit through Cas attempting to dissect the past he would claw his arm off to escape.
He didn’t expect to pull back up to the bunker and see Cas standing outside. They made eye contact through the Impala’s windshield. Dean forced a smile and steeled himself as he got out of the car. It was good to see Cas but he felt suddenly unprepared.
“No. I’m not just leaving you here because I was a dope who thought you would-I’ll take you home.”
He smiled up at him, stood, and leaned over the bed to where Castiel was still sitting, frozen in a level of confusion that he was unwilling to convey to Dean if it might mean his smile would falter. “And just to ‘Align Expectations’ early, I’m going to expect a card at our year anniversary. Fuck, flowers. Balloons. Fireworks. A cake with our faces on it.” He leaned into Castiel, and curled a hand against the nape of his neck, resting their foreheads together.
They ran out of the door, Dean breaking open the picture frame as they got to the fire pit. Dean placed the hair jewelry in the pit and began shaking salt over it as Castiel added gasoline and struck a match.
‘Weird, I always thought this song was Dylan. You know ‘Catch the wind’?’ He texted to Cas. Cas responded he didn’t know it and Dean felt that feeling of connection slip a bit and in that moment he fiercely wanted it back, wanted to pull Cas into what he was experiencing. “Fuck it.” He said out loud, and hit the call button next to Cas’s name. It rang for half a second and Cas picked up.
of pining and hiding, stolen glances and lingering touches how was one supposed to ask the love of their life – and their best friend at that – to marry them? It’s not that Dean wants to make a spectacle of it. But he needs something meaningful. Something that is more than… just more than.
Sorry, this took so long, I was finishing my master thesis and of course, I forgot about what time is and when I wanted to upload. But here you go. I hope you enjoy the last chapter. <3
This was his life, his very real, sappy life that he chose and that he deserved. Not because of anything that he had done. No, just because he was himself and he deserved everything good that this world had to offer. He deserved his angel-boyfriend and his son and his family intact. He deserved to hang up hunting for good because he was done putting his ass on the line. He deserved dates at fairs and long walks on beaches. He deserved the life he always dreamed of with the person he loved and who loved him back for who he truly was and not for who he was supposed to be.
“It would really suit you.”
“What?!”, Dean yelps.
“Luckily,”, Garth was now facing the audience again, “I don’t have to find more words, because the lovely grooms have prepared their vows themselves and I will now leave the floor to them. Castiel, do you want to start?” Castiel flashed Garth a nervous smile and nodded. Dean felt his heart jump in his chest, and his eyes finally landed on Cas.
“This is nice”, Cas mumbles comfortable, sitting cross-legged on the grass.
Shopping for a ring turned out far more complicated than Dean had anticipated. Claire and Cas had left for the case after Cas moped about Dean refusing to come with them.
After a round of burgers and fries were Dean laments the fact,
, Sam would do something embarrassing at his wedding. Naturally. “Sammy,”, he started in his lowest and most older-brother-authority voice, but Sam shook his head, a grin on his face and started to tap at the glass with his knife. “Ok, ok. I don’t want to make any long-ass speeches no one wants to hear at a wedding anyway.” “Then stop!”, came the response from Ed at the other end of the table. Not paying him any mind, Sam went on undeterred: “But I need something off my chest.” Castiel’s head snapped up, anxious about what could follow that statement. “12 years,”, Sam started. “12 long fucking years, did I had to endure the bickering and the fighting and the ‘He is not my boyfriend, Sam’”, Sam deepened his voice to imitate Dean’s, flinging his arms around in exaggeration. “The ‘I am okay, Sam, Castiel didn’t hurt my feelings.’ And the ‘You are wrong, Sam, I am not in love with that angel.’ 12 years, I had to mediate and comfort these two idiots, who clearly were so madly in love with each other, that they risk this world’s fate multiple times – but let's not get into that.”, Sam laughed, mostly to himself. “And I am proud, proud as can be, to finally see them as the happy couple they are today. This took you too fucking long, and I expect reparations for the emotional rollercoaster you two put me on. Here’s to Destiel, or how it would be correctly spelt Deastiel!”, he raised his glass and some wine spilt over and dripped on the tablecloth. Charlie and her girlfriend could hardly suppress their laughter anymore. Seemingly pleased with himself, Sam ended his speech: “Ok, that’s all. Congratulations Dean and I’m sorry, Castiel, he is now yours to take care of. To the happy couple.”, a round of cheers went up and down the table as Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and Cas just awkwardly laughed with the rest of them. After the plates were emptied and the masses appeased, Jack got up straightening their bowtie. “I think its time to open the bar and the dance floor.”, they announced brightly and then decisively turned to Dean and Cas, who blankly stared back. “What?”, Dean asked cluelessly. Was he expected to say something, give his ok for people to get drunk and go wild? Donna turned to him, sensing his irritation and smiled knowingly. “You and Cas have to open with the first dance as newly-weds.”, she laughed as Dean and Cas’ eyes grew wide. When Jack had talked about dancing with him a couple of weeks back, Dean had said that of course there would be dancing, like at all weddings. Finally, the penny dropped as Dean realised what he had forgotten.
.”, she said pointedly and tucked at his sleeve. “Now,
. “What I am trying to say is: I am sorry for what I did. I know I said that already. But I can’t – I don’t know how to go on from here with you. I don’t know how to ever make up for what I did. And Cas, well, Cas said I can only make up for it by being- well, um… by trying to be as good as a parent, as I can be. And I want to. I hope you know, I want to be good to you and that- you know, that you.. I mean, I feel like you are my kid. Not just any kid, my kid.”, Dean paused, he blinked rapidly, trying to stay focused and speak from the heart. Jack didn’t know what to say, their heart was jumping, and a warm feeling spread through their veins. “I am sorry, Jack. I want you in this family. You are my family, part of my family and if I gave you the feeling… that you didn’t belong… I am sorry for that. I hope you know that. And I will try harder. I promise.”, Dean looked up, wearily. Testing the water. Tears formed in his eyes. “Thank you”, Jack took everything in, felt the warm feeling in their stomach and the thorn in their heart shrank. “Thank you, Dean.”, Jack didn’t know what else to say. Dean got up and came up to him, ruffling their hair. “You’re a good kid, Jack.” Jack looked up to him, gleaming with joy. “So, I’m gonna look for Cas now. Make sure he didn’t lock himself in the freezer.” Dean knew Cas had left to give him space, somehow feeling that Dean had finally built up the courage to talk to Jack.
, he begged silently, his hands frantically groping at every tiny bit of skin and muscle they could find. He pressed his eyes shut and concentrated on the feeling of Dean’s cock brushing over his. Dean’s lips were on his neck now, leaving hot kisses on his vein; sucking and nursing their way down to Cas collarbone, it was almost unbearable. “I want you”, Dean whispered leaving traces of saliva on his skin and his voice so low and coarse, aching desire lingering in every word. “Then fucking have me”, Cas was surprised as the words tumbled out of his mouth. He usually wasn’t the one for talking during sex, especially not like this. Dean raised an eyebrow at the cocky words, but a grin flashed over his face shortly after that could only be described as primal.
2 minutes prior
The ring had been a promise then and it would be a promise now.
Cas was lucky that he made it back into his room without anyone noticing. Searching for the little note he had written his vows on, he jerked up as a sharp knock on his door echoed through his room. Without waiting for an answer, Claire waltzed in. “Why are you still in here? Do you want to be too late to your own wedding so bad?”, she walked up to him, a stern look on her face. Cas flinched at her words, she was right. The guests were probably already seated, music playing and everyone waiting for them to go down the aisle. “Is Dean-”, Cas wanted to ask, but Claire cut him off: “Sam dragged his ass already to the entrance.” “Good.”, he answered, searching her eyes for signs if they knew what they had been up to. “Got your vows?”, she asked impatiently, tapping her foot on the wooden floor. But as he nodded hesitantly and held up a tiny piece of paper, her eyes grew warmer. “Nervous?”, her hand squeezed his arm lightly. “Yes.”, Cas admitted, his cheeks blushing. “I guess that’s normal.”, a small smiled tucked at the corner of her mouth and the dark eyeliner under her eyes stretched as the smile reached her eyes. “I am very happy for you. Both of you.”, her voice got a bit shaky and she cleared her throat in an attempt to cover the emotions rising up. “And if you ask me, I don’t think you have to be nervous. I think that this is the only right decision you two ever made in your whole life. Ever.”, she laughed, and it calmed Cas’ breath. “That’s a lot of life you’re talking about.”, he raised his eyebrows, but she just rolled her eyes. “I
Dean propped himself up on his arm and kissed Cas on the cheek. “We should get dressed and you should go back to your room. Before someone notices and we get shot or somethin’.” Dean said Cas shuddered. Claire would do that; he was sure of it. “Just a moment longer.”, Cas asked and held Dean’s arm in place. “No”, Dean answered. “Up. Now.” Cas let out a noise. “No, no complaining, we are getting married in like”, he checked his phone that lay beside them, “15 minutes.
, he signed when they sat down as Dean murmured a
“I think no angel could have ever come up with that idea.”
, but when green eyes met with blue all he could see in Cas’ eyes was love and wonder. This angel would not care how clumsily Dean put this if he would stumble over words or not. When they would watch a film and Dean would trip over his own words because his mind was quicker than his mouth, Cas always waited patiently for him to repeat and put his thoughts in order. Cas would never laugh at him or be annoyed at him for bumbling. He would look at Dean like he did right now, in affectionate puzzlement, eager to know what Dean wanted to tell him but calm enough for him to wait. Some of the anxiety settled in Dean and he threw a small smile to the crowd to charm his way out of his awkwardness.
Castiel makes an approving sound, at what he doesn’t specify. Finding his mouth again, Cas’ sucks and licks hotly at the other man. Eager and desperate to taste as much as he can.
“Nervous?”, Garth asked Sam and nodded towards Dean. “A wreck”, Sam joked, Dean was too consumed with his own thoughts to hear anything the two of them discussed. “Then we just have to wait for the other dapper groom, mh?”, Garth said, and Sam took his place to Dean’s right. They didn’t need to wait long, as footsteps echoed from the hallway only a few minutes later. A solemn silence spread through the room and everyone turned to the entrance again, expectantly. Someone whispered a few words and a slowed down, instrumental version of “Lover” started playing. Dean would have laughed at the song choice, would have shaken his head in amusement because this was one hundred percent Claire trolling him (joke would be on her because he loved the song, not that we would tell anyone that). But Dean didn’t catch the song. He didn’t hear the second wave of gasping and buzzing. Didn’t see the smiles in the crowd. All his senses were pinpointed to one man and one man only who stood in the entrance across the aisle. The breath had been knocked out of his lungs and it was hard to keep his knees from turning to jelly. Cas stood in the doorframe Claire at his side and his eyes full of stars. Nothing mattered anymore, only that perfect face. Dean could tell Cas’ expression even being this far apart. He knew how the pink lips would be agape ever so slightly, how those eyes searched for an anchor in a sea of confusion and overwhelming emotion. He could see the line on his forehead deepen as he caught his sight. Knew the way his breath had changed as he walked in. Dean knew without needing to witness it. With a little nudge from Claire, they began to walk down the aisle and it was as if a spell had been broken. The music and muttering, the smell of the flowers and the light of the sun all flooded Dean’s nerve system again and made his head spin. Castiel walked towards him and his heart felt like it would stop beating like it was holding its breath. Slowly, Dean’s eyes filled with tears as his angel got more defined with every step, less a blurry shape and more the man that he saw walking towards him so many times before. Claire was beaming at him with glassy eyes as they reached them, but Dean could not tear his eyes from Cas. With a shaky breath, he inhaled. His mouth moved as if words were about to spill from it, but nothing came out. Dean was truly and utterly speechless.
The man had studied him thoroughly and Dean had simultaneously bathed in the attention and squirmed beneath it. After a while of staring at some pair of Adidas without even registering what colour they even were, Dean had made his way to the back of the shop and towards the rings sparkling in their velvet rows.
Both look down at the ring and then up to face each other.
12 mins to go.
“Castiel, do you take Dean Winchester as your lawfully wedded husband? Then say I Do.” Castiel squeezed Dean’s hands, his eyes fixed on the golden freckles before him. “I do”, he breathed, the words were so full of love and want that they made Dean blush. Long fingers pushed the band over Castiel’s ring finger and Dean let his touch linger for a moment. “Dean, do you take Castiel as your lawfully wedded husband, then say I Do.” Dean felt the heat in his cheeks and neck, he felt the tears drying on his skin and the hands of the man he loved between his. This was more than he ever dreamed he was allowed to have. This was more than he ever thought he deserved. A family that loved him the way he was. Unconditionally. For a moment the tiny voice in his head rose again trying to convince him that this was not right, but he drowned it with two simple words: “I do.” Castiel’s finger brushed over Dean’s as he slipped the ring on that strong hand that shook beneath his own. A sigh rippled through the crowd behind them and a few people already started to cheer. “With the power vested in me by all 50 states,”, Garth’s voice grew louder with each word to stay audible above all the hoots, “I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may kiss each other.” He had to yell the last three words as the room erupted in sighs, howls, and clapping. Dean didn’t lose any time but leapt forward, grabbing Castiel in the process and pulling him close. With a grin that could almost be described as salacious, he crashed his mouth against Cas’ who matched his excitement and wrapped his arms around Dean in a heartbeat. Not an inch of space between them they kissed, long and feverish. Castiel felt the soft lips on his own and forgot about the room and the people in it. Right now, there was only Dean and him, embraced and full of joy and love. His lips moved over Dean’s, eager to taste and feel as much as possible. Growing gentler, Dean’s hand wandered to the small of his back, lingering there for a moment before he bent him downwards. Surprised by the course this kiss was taking, Castiel froze for a second. Smiling against his lips, Dean guided him even further back and Castiel melted under his touch, letting him bend him back until his leg went up in an attempt to keep himself balanced. Dean got exactly the reaction he wanted to achieve as the cheering and hooting reached unholy levels of volume. Carefully, trying not to make them both tumble, Dean pulled Cas upright again. As soon as Cas felt his foot solid on the ground again he couldn’t suppress raising both of his eyebrows at Dean as he broke away from him.
Frowning at the ring Dean holds up.
“Are you alright, Dean?”, Cas asks wearily with his gravelly voice and Dean eases at the sight and the familiar tone. What was he nervous for?
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is going through your mind?”, Cas asks quietly as the wheel slowly turns to bring them back down. Dean’s head is snug in the crook between Cas’ shoulder and neck and he smirks against the exposed skin.
Cas could barely breathe, though he tried to keep his breath steady to not get dizzy. Dean filled him and it felt like everything fell into place. Like everything made sense and the world stopped being so chaotic. It was just him and Dean, moving, panting, sweating. Cas felt so raw and open, in a literal and metaphorical sense. With every trust, Dean brought him closer to the edge, and Cas sensed he wasn’t lasting for much longer. Longing to come, he bit into his arm. Dean was the only thought in his head. Dean, beautiful, perfect Dean. His Dean. Cas pressed his eyes shut.
Visibly relieved the girl sends them the pictures and makes her goodbye and way back.
“I like the song”, Cas whispered against Dean’s neck and the skin tingled where his breath touched it. “It’s a good song.”, Dean agreed, rubbing his thumbs over Castiel’s back. “I like you more, though.”, Cas continued, and Dean could feel him blushing next to him. “I like you more, too.”, Dean chuckled and kissed his hair. “This dancing is only half as bad, as I expected.”, Cas mused and pressed himself flush to Dean. “Yeah, but they’re still dicks for doing this to us.”, Dean sounded grumpy, but Cas knew he didn’t mean it. The song closed and there was another round of applause and hooting. “Yeah, yeah, yeah”, Dean pulled out of the embrace with Castiel, red in the face and acting annoyed. “Now, get on the fuckin’ floor or get me a drink.” Laughter followed that statement and Garth appeared with two tumblers of whiskey in his hands. “As you wish, big man.”, he winked and placed the drinks in their hands respectively. The music rose louder and soon the floor was filled with couples and lone dancers moving like no one was watching.
. Dean sucked on the nook of Cas’ shoulder, thrusting harder into him. “Oh baby”, he groaned. “Fuck, I’m coming, love.” Cas moaned and touched himself. Dean who had noticed the shift in Cas’ posture, murmured: “Good.” Dean’s arm muscles twitched as he held Cas in place, this one was messy and if Dean didn’t set the pace or hold him tight, he would move all over the place. Fuck, Dean was so hot for him, it wasn’t even fair. “Slower, Dean. Please. Make it last.”, Cas suddenly interrupted. Usually, Cas wanted it faster and harder, to come quickly and messy and to feel Dean’s weight on him afterwards, grounding him. “Ok”, Dean tried to slow down, but it was hard to not fuck Cas’ brain out right now. “Slow”, Cas pleaded again. He wanted to enjoy his boyfriend as a boyfriend for the last time, and tonight he could have him as his husband. Tonight, and forever. Cas panted this one word in his mind,
A strange feeling overcame Castiel as he was walking towards the dark wooden doors that would lead them to the great hall. Everything felt heightened, every sound crystal-clear, every detail sharp, and, still, he felt bizarrely far away from all of it. He could barely feel himself walk and yet every step felt heavy rattled through his bones. His left hand held onto Claire in a desperate try to steady himself, clutching onto reality as he felt that he was losing his nerves by the minute now. Behind his ears, a constant white noise was growing louder and louder. And then, suddenly, they stopped, two looming doors in front of them. “Are you ready?”, Claire asked attentively, squeezing his hand lightly. Cas wanted to answer her, wanted to at least nod or shake his head but his body wouldn’t comply. Thickly, he swallowed and felt his throat close too tight around the fluid that was forcing its way down. It hurt. The white noise in his ear rang loud and shrill. He was going to faint, he thought as panic rose in his gut, crawling its way up his spine and into his mind.
“Wanna stop fighting and shoot some stuff?”, Dean laughs and shuts the door with a thump.
In a sudden burst of confidence, Cas took a step towards Dean, wrapping his arms around his neck, forgetting about standard dance moves, or the correct posture. He laid his head on Dean’s shoulder and started swaying with the music, slowly and tenderly. A smile swept across Dean’s face and he dropped his arms, reaching around Cas, holding him close.
was saved, Dean. You saved me because with you I felt free for the first time and I was able to be myself. I think what I wanted to say is, thank you for saving me. And”, Cas’ breath hitched as he fought down the sob that wanted to crawl up his throat. His hands had begun to shake, and he shook his head slightly so his vision would become clear again as the words started to blur in front of him. But it wasn’t his eyes playing tricks on him. The ink was running from the tears that had started to roll down his cheeks and dripped on the paper. “And”, he started again with his voice scratching from the quiet sobs that he could no longer hold back. “And, I promise to care for you and to love you for all eternity and longer.”, his adam’s apple bobbled painfully in his dry throat and he looked up. Dean was barely keeping it together, tears collecting at the rim of his eyes. Someone in the crowd blew their nose and someone full-on cried somewhere in the back. Cas didn’t dare to look at the people around him, he only looked at Dean through the veil of tears that blurred his vision and his mind. Behind Dean, Sam was pressing the back of his hand against his eye sockets. Even though Dean had steeled himself before because he knew two words of Castiel were enough for him to break, felt his defences melt. His heart was racing, and he wanted nothing more than grabbing Cas and kiss him senseless, but that wasn’t what he was supposed to do right now. He had to be patient. “That was beautiful,”, Garth said, his own voice breathy. “Dean.”, he gestured towards him and Dean’s heart sank with a sudden thump. His turn. Slightly nauseous and with jittery hands he pulled out the note from his pocket. It was crumbled on the edges and worn out on the crease from the many times he had unfolded and folded it again. He cleared his throat, trying to get his voice steady because at his state he wouldn’t put it past him that his voice would just give up on him. “Mh, okay.”, he shook his head, why couldn’t he just read what was on the damn paper. This would be a disaster. He could feel it. He never has been good with words, hence why he put them down. But even with the paper in front of him, his mouth denied him the service. He cleared his voice again and shook out the paper.
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
“After everything that…happened.”, Dean lets out a stuttering breath, “I thought about what I wanted for the first time in… in a long time. And then when Jack got you back and everything settled down, I noticed something. I realised that I already had everything that I wanted. Over the years, without realising, I build a family. I found the love of my life”, he takes Cas’ hand with his free one and squeezes it lightly. The look of curiosity deepens on Cas’ face but he lets Dean talk, patiently like always.
“I am happy to share this life with you. And I want everyone to know how happy we are. And that we belong to each other. That we found each other. Against all odds. Against god himself. So, if you want. Um.”, he shifts to sit on his knees. Theoretically, he can say he kneeled before Cas. In a way. The angel stares at him with wide eyes already caught on with what was about to happen and his eyes water in surprise.
“I love you.”
, she had laughed heartily.
. This must be it, Castiel decided. He never felt this way before, not in battle, not moments before his – multiple – deaths, not ever. Everything inside him was screaming, rioting with dread, his eyes started to water. “Claire, I”, Castiel wanted to tell her that he might faint, that his body was betraying him. His voice was croaky and blunt and full of worry. “Hey, it's ok.”, Claire cut him off. She had felt his body getting wobblier with every step towards the doors, she could tell what was going on behind that frown. “This is just a lil’ stage fright. It's ok, we all feel that way before things like this.”, she whispered encouragingly, her voice laced with sympathy and a smile. “It’s like, I don’t know, a milestone or whatever.”, she nudged him playfully to ease some of the tension, maybe she could punch it out of him. “You’ll be fine. I promise, as soon as you go in, all of this anxiety will go away.” Of course, Claire didn’t know if that would actually be the case, or if Cas would be a nervous wreck until she dragged his ass up the aisle. But in moments like these white lies were acceptable and she would not let Cas’ nerves get the best of him. When it came down to it, she was his best man and she would ensure that two grooms would be up there. End of story. Cas flashed her a look; he didn’t seem convinced. With an audible gulp, he breathed in and straightened his back. “That’s the spirit.”, Claire exclaimed gleefully and tightened her grip on his arm. Castiel could still hear the noise in his head and all of his limbs felt too heavy to move. Without waiting for him to give a go-ahead, Claire pushed the doors open and a flood of quiet conversations, laughter, pressed voices washed over them, draining out everything else. Colours of different flowers and tulle-garlands mixed with the golden light that refracted through the milky glass and fell onto the towering walls of the great hall. The warm air of the afternoon floated lazily in between, embracing each and every guest. The voices were calming down, ebbing away as people turned towards the door, where Cas and Claire stood. Only the creaking of benches and the swishing of clothes filled the air now. Castiel saw the colours and the light, he felt the warmth and heard the moving of bodies to either side of him, but all his thoughts were emptied as his eyes fell on a figure in the far back of the room. All at once, the panic that had threatened to swallow him whole was simmering down leaving only a little tweak in his stomach. The ground grew more steady underneath his feet and breathing became more natural again. Nothing felt displaced or overwhelming, now. He saw Dean and the momentary sensation of dread and worry subdued. Dean was standing there waiting for him, Dean in his suit and the little flower in his breast pocket. Dean with this silly smile on his face, Dean staring back at him across the aisle. Beautiful Dean Winchester. The air rushed out of Castiel’s body as his lips parted, taking in the sight that was his soon to be husband. When before his body wouldn’t move because he was scared, now his body refused to move because he wasn’t done memorising every single detail about this moment. He wanted to keep this forever. This exact moment. Seconds passed and a soft tug at his arm reminded him that this whole ordeal wasn’t over, the main part was yet to come. Almost mechanically his feet set into motion and his body followed suit. Familiar faces appeared at his side, smiling, mouthing words of congratulation, bright eyes and pink cheeks. Castiel didn’t know how his face looked like, probably a mixture of confusion and determinations as always. In reality, he was concentrating. Concentrating on the face that became clearer with every step he took towards it. Eventually, they came to halt and Claire slipped to his left side. He didn’t notice, all his attention was focussed on the freckled nose and copper eyelashes in front of him. Dean looked at him as if thunderstruck, he opened his mouth but said nothing and closed it again. Eyes searching his. Before Castiel could stop himself, he said: “Hello, Dean.”, as if they hadn’t been together less than 15 minutes ago. Dean broke out in a low laugh, his eyes falling to the floor before they made their way back up to look at him. “Hey.”, he said affectionately, a heat in his green eyes that still took Castiel by surprise. The golden spots in his iris were glowing and Cas thought he could forget about the world and only those golden spots would remain. “We all made it here, great.”, came Garth’s cheerful comment, neither Cas nor Dean looked at him, they were still entranced with each other’s eyes, soaking in every second of this moment. After all, it was finally happening, and Garth was right: they made it here.
“Um, excuse me”, a high voice comes from next to them and Dean turns already annoyed at whoever interrupts them on getting home and into bed.
Heartrate slowly dropping again, Dean narrows his eyes.
. He could call Sam, or go see how the preparations went along, even though Claire and Jack had told him several times now to stop checking on them. That everything was just fine and would be ready in time. Turning his face to the sky, he sighed. Blue eyes huge with worry and excitement. Was it normal that he was so worried? Did ‘people’ worry on such a day? Wasn’t he supposed to be as happy as can be? Then again, he was and besides that, he had little to no knowledge of people in general. Exasperated he let his head fall and brought his hands to his hips, an image of cluelessness. He wondered about Dean, he wondered how he felt. Was he worried, too? A stinging pain pierced through him. Everything was going to be ok.
. Dean smoothed over the sleeve of his suit, warm sunlight on his back. The fabric felt nice beneath his touch. He liked the suit. He hated that woman, but he liked the suit. Sam had also made him buy a new shirt and new shoes and Dean had complied. He wanted to look good, not for him, but for Cas. He wondered what Cas was wearing. Clair and Jack had taken Cas shopping and they told both of them, that they weren’t allowed to see each other’s outfits beforehand. Dean shook his head. Since when were they so keen on traditions? Probably they only wanted to wind them up, so they would lose it when they saw each other in the hall later. He checked his watch, 40 minutes to go. Clearing his throat, he thought about what he wanted to say later. Arranging his words again and again in his mind.
The song was playing but none of them was moving. Dean’s fingers were digging into the fabric of Cas’ suit, unsure how to proceed.
“I told you, I almost had it.”, they make their way to the fair bickering the entire time, but it is light-hearted and Dean knows Cas enjoys putting him in his place just as much as he enjoys starting stupid arguments.
Cas turns his head to catch a glimpse of Dean, blue eyes curious and earnest and so full of love Dean has to actively remember how to breathe.
“You asshole! I nearly had a heart attack.”
“Do you know your size?”
They walked on for some time until Cas made Dean turn back, reminding him that they had in fact only a few hours before they had to get up again. “You will be grumpy and annoy Sam all morning when we don’t head back now.”, Cas urged and threw his boyfriend a stern look.  “Yea, yea. Ok. Let’s head back.” Dean conceded, knowing that Cas was right. “But I’m not saying that we’re going to sleep when we are back.”, Dean winked, his tone sleek. “No, you’re right. You will sleep. I don’t have to.”, Cas said exasperatedly. He would not let Dean play his little games, because he knew they would both pay for it the next day. “Oh, come on.”, Dean really pulled out all the registers in his voice to sound sexy and smooth. But Castiel was smarter than that. Well, most of the times at least. “Good, let’s get back and see.”, he shrugged and Dean, certain of his success, let himself be led back to the motel. “Cas.”, Dean drew out the word as Cas locked the door and wiggled out of his parka, dropping it on the chair next to the bed. “No.”, he shook his head defensively. “Castiel.”, Dean crept up from behind him and wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist, slowly kissing the parts of his neck that were exposed by the sweater. “Dean, go to bed.”, Cas insisted. He wouldn’t budge. “I will. But do you know what would help me sleep?”, he hummed against the nook right beneath Cas’ ear. Tiny sparks bloomed were Dean’s breath hit his skin and excitement washed over him. It ran through him like ice-cold water and pooled in his stomach. “Dean.”, his voice started wavering, but he was determined not to falter. Dean continued kissing his neck and started nibbling at his neck ever so often, leaving little red marks on his neck and a trembling Cas between his arms. “Mmh?”, Dean acted innocently, his hands now traced over Cas’ abdomen, making their way further down. “We can do anything you want tomorrow, ok? We have three days, in a lovely Bed and Breakfast, with a … a lovely bed…”, Cas closed his eyes, he couldn’t concentrate. “Oh, we will.”, he felt Dean smile against his neck. “But tonight-”, Cas persisted with the last bit of self-restraint he had left. “Tonight, you have to sleep.”, Dean made a disapproving noise. Cas put his hands on Dean’s, that still massaged their way towards his crotch. Lust flooded through him now, he wanted Dean and he knew that Dean knew. He could feel him getting hard, felt it pressing against him. Damn this Winchester, he wouldn’t get his way. Not playing this unfairly. “Dean, I mean it. Not tonight. It’s almost 2 a.m.”, Cas turned in Dean’s arms and Dean’s hands landed gracefully on Cas’ ass. Their faces now only inches away from each other. He leaned forward and kissed Dean square on the mouth, longing and wet. Dean’s lips were so soft and pillow-like.
. His jacket, his car, his music – as Sam so eloquently pointed out that one time – was his dad’s. But his jewellery,
“Thank you..”, he searched for the name tag but the man didn’t wear one.
Most of the buzzing had died down since Dean and Sam entered the room. Agonising in anticipation for the second groom, the guests only muttered the occasional word to their neighbour, trying to keep the air light. Dean was glad for the little bits of conversation that filled the room like white noise and kept his mind from wandering. His eyes flew over the crowd, which was larger than he had expected when they first talked about the venue. Claire and Jack had taken over soon after Dean’s first breakdown (which involved picking the font for the announcement) and they had only been asked to contribute in giving their opinion ever so often for cake choice or to pick colours for the flowers. Now, that he saw the fruits of all their efforts, it touched him greatly. His eyes landed on Jack, who waved at him a big smile on their face. They wore a teal suit with a matching bowtie and Dean remembered how excited Jack was when they showed him. Waving back, Dean felt fuzziness curl up in his stomach and his heart almost burst with pride.
“Let’s go home”, Cas says, tilting forward and kissing Dean again, open-mouthed and long. The fireworks are forgotten, nothing compares to the feeling they share at this moment. Together.
“I have these as well. They’re solid, but with a twist.”, he had said, opening the box and it produced a collection of silver rings, each band with a different thickness and carved out linework.
Castiel looks at him with dark eyes, full of lust and desire and Dean can’t quite help but get swept up in the knowledge that those eyes were direct at him. Castiel wanted him just as bad as he wanted Cas.
“Um, I don’t… No, just, um, the… men’s jewellery”, he had said with a low voice, feeling stupid.
“I’m glad you asked me”, Cas blushes at this confession, hands curled around Dean’s waist.
. After years, after a
, the lady had exclaimed, but she didn’t sound sorry, just amused.
kind of gay?”, Cas who didn’t understand what Dean was referring to, just looked at him blankly. “What kind of gay?”, he asked sincerely, but Dean just shook his head. “The next thing I know we go antique shopping for lamps or some crap.” “Oh, that sounds nice.”, Cas eyes lit up and Dean couldn’t help but melt at the sight. Cas looked so excited and a tiny part of him warmed up to the idea of going. Another thought formed in his mind. This could be the right spot, after all. In a cute town, surrounded by trees and nice houses. He could ask Cas then. His stomach fluttered. “Jesus”, he said, not allowing himself to show the excitement that grew by the second now. Maybe he could make Cas wear something else but the suit. He could get him one of these knitted sweaters since Cas was complaining about getting cold sometimes, these days. They still hadn’t figured out what was up with his powers. They seemed to weaken and strengthen like the tides came and go. Cas said not to worry about it, and Dean tried not to. At some point, they had made Jack check Cas, search within him with their powers, but it had been futile. Jack didn’t know what was causing the issue but said they couldn’t sense anything wrong with Cas, either. One time, Cas had joked, that maybe he was like Arwen, becoming human now that he had given his heart to a mortal man. It was after Dean had made Cas watch all of
“Let’s go up that hill, I think we’ll have the best view from there”, Dean points to a tiny slope next to the fair, without any ulterior motifs of course.
If perfect moments existed, this was certainly one of them. So, Dean didn’t mind the stifled laughter and the awes and the “cute” he heard from the rest of the party. He lost himself in the song and the sensation of Castiel’s body, his husband’s body, against his own.
. Forcefully Dean rolled onto his back and kicked off his shoes. Rustling noises came from the bag, as Cas searched for their pyjamas, he wouldn’t leave his street clothes on for another night. He put two white cotton shirts on the bed, flicking Dean’s arm to stop him from falling asleep before changing and then proceeded to take off his own clothes. Goosebumps appeared when he was stripped to his boxers, and as he pulled the shirt over his head, he breathed in the clean smell of unworn fabric. Dean had made it into an upright position, tugging at his shirt and lazily dropping everything on the floor. Shooting him an unnerved look Cas collected them and put the clothes neatly on top of their bags. With a click, the lights were turned off and the room went dark. “Scooch”, he commanded an already settled in Dean, who wrapped the sheets around him like a caterpillar its cocoon. Dean obeyed and shuffled closer to the wall, rolling onto his side, getting ready to spoon. Cas nuzzled against Dean and wrapped the covers around them. A quiet smile spread on his face in the dark as he took Dean’s arm and pressed it tighter around him. He wasn’t particularly tired, only faint dizziness settled in his head, but it was not like the heavy, pounding exhaustion from yesterday. Calmly, he snuggled with Dean wrapped around him, in a state of ignorant bliss, somewhere between awake and dreaming.
“Of course”, the man had winked and bent under the counter to retrieve some boxes from below. Dean had faltered for a moment, thinking that he didn’t reach for the rings Dean had seen in the glass counter or the window because he asked for the men’s collection, but then discovered that the box from underneath contained the same rings he saw before.
He remembered the day he bought his ring in an off-brand store in some smalltown at one of his solo hunts. He must have been what, 22? Maybe. John had been gone on a hunting trip with Marty and gave him coordinates in the Midwest to take care of a possible ghoul situation. Dean left immediately and the whole thing didn’t even take more than three days to sort out; after which he decided a few days off wouldn’t hurt and his father probably didn’t expect him to be back soon anyway. So, instead, he had stayed. Checked out the local bars and passed one shop in particular every day he had been in town. The store was tiny with huge shelves offering everything from fake Prada purses to dubious Nike sneakers plastering the walls up to the glass counter where boxes sat, containing an array of metal rings and glittery ear studs.
It was time, Dean thought, his hands shaking more violently than he had anticipated. Sam stood next to him and even he looked tense. Second-hand nervousness, Dean guessed from the forced smile on Sammy’s face. Unconsciously his hand wandered up to his breast pocket again, touching the small flower and its soft petals to calm him down. Still there, everything was going to be fine, they were going to be fine. Hell, he had faced practically every evil thing in existence, he had faced
One month, three weeks and four days earlier.
. These were his favourite mornings when everything was quiet and slow. When the bunker was peaceful, and he could just be. Castiel had no hurry to experience life to its fullest, to see the world with Dean, to go hiking or to the movies, or whatever humans did for fun. Not that he wasn’t keen on his new life, not at all. He wanted to do all these things, but when he was alone with Dean was when he felt true bliss. This was enough. Both of them in bed, flushed together, Dean’s head resting on him, and his arm around his body. Cas loved looking at Dean while he slept. Loved knowing the fact that Dean felt safe and secure in his arms. Loved that those tired green eyes found remedy beside him. Dean slept through the night, most of the time now. Not always, admittingly. Sometimes he would wake in the middle of the night and call out Cas’ name. Sometimes he wouldn’t wake and still call his name, agitated and Cas would hold him till he was still again, till the nightmares were over. Cause that was all they were now, nightmares. Ghosts of the past, that could haunt them, but not hurt them anymore. Dean moved slightly, pushing his nose deeper into Cas’ cotton shirt, mumbling something indistinguishable. Out of instinct, Cas pulled him closer. Lazily Dean threw his arm around Cas, snuggling closer to his angel, his face flushed against Cas’ chest. Worrying, Cas asked himself if he got enough air like this, but Dean tended to just bury his face in his shirts and seemed to breathe just fine, so he didn’t complain. How could he? Slowly waking up, Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, stretching his muscles. “Good morning”, Cas smiled softly at him, bowing down his head to kiss Dean’s head, nuzzling his nose in Dean’s hair. He smelled of sleep and serenity. “Morning, sunshine”, came the answer, Dean’s voice still gravely. Cas kissed his head again, dragging his lips over the crown of Dean’s head. Feeling Dean smile against the cotton, unwilling to get up. “What time is it?”, Dean asked, shaking his head to clear his head. “9 a.m.”, Cas glanced at the little timer on their bedstand. With a groan, Dean let his head sink deeper into Cas’ body, “Too early.” “I think Sam and Eileen are already back from their morning run.”, Castiel laughed, smoothing over Dean’s back. He was beautiful, every inch of him. “Because they’re lunatics.”, he muttered grumpily. “Come on, let’s get some coffee.”, he offered and tucked at Dean’s shirt. “Yeah,”, Dean finally propped himself up on both arms, now being face to face with his boyfriend. A smile washed over his face, he still couldn’t stop himself from grinning like a fool when he looked at Cas, into those blue eyes that were all his. “Good morning, love”, he said again, a cheeky tone in his voice as he leaned forwards and kissed him, mouths dry. He moved closer, reaching up with one hand and cupping Cas’ face. He kissed him until he was out of breath, licked the inside of his mouth and over his lips, hot air between them. “Good morning”, Cas replied, mirroring Dean’s grin. “Coffee?”, he asked again, and Dean nodded, leaning in one last time before they got up.
Needless to say, Dean thought about it a lot and was very much excited to actually propose. The only problem had been the
“Thank you for the coat, Dean. You are very gentlemanly.” Dean choked out a laugh and smiled at the ground. Castiel noted his smile was genuinely happy.
“I don’t think Dean would consider it a road trip, he drives much longer distances for work.” Castiel quickly scanned the candies for a response “and my favorite road trip snack is Sno-Caps.”
“I’ll take the sofa, you ok if I grab one of the pillows?” Dean was arranging his duffel so it was tucked on the floor against the sofa arm.
“We’re not talking about that.” Dean pulled the pillow aside to glare at her. “You agreed.”
He walked home to his apartment. Dean was asleep on the couch, still wearing the clothes he’d driven from Kansas in. Castiel draped a blanket over him. He tucked the jerky he had purchased last grocery trip specifically for this instance in Dean’s jacket pocket so that he would find it on his drive back.
“No, Dean. Because they’re your fourth favorite band to hear while driving on a fall day, and I wanted to work my way up through the list given the time frame of the drive.” Castiel explained.
“Dean. I apologize for the interruption but I have some things I want to say to you that i was waiting to say in person.” Cas squared off directly in front of Dean, and stared into his eyes, lifting an arm to place it on his shoulder. “You are under the misapprehension that you were involved in a one sided relationship for half of last year.” Dean flinched and attempted to talk but Cas continued. “I truly apologize for any pain that caused you. However, the truth is that while I was unaware of the specific nature of that relationship at the time, I have been devoted to you for far longer than last year.” Dean sucked in a breath and met Castiel’s eyes. “The nature of that devotion is hard to explain in human terms. Love would be one word for it, so I’ll use that word. I love you, Dean. I love you in all the ways I know.”
They were laying stretched out in the guest room that she had commandeered and kitted out with a full media center, and watching Roadhouse.
“Holding your soul in my hands was deeply intimate.” Cas explained. They walked in and continued talking, Dean pulling him to his room to show off the record player. It felt comfortable, a mix between the friendship of before and the murky dating era. He didn’t know what he was doing, but neither did Cas. Figuring out how to be in a relationship couldn’t be harder than an apocalypse, and with Cas at his side his odds were pretty damn good.
Castiel thought on this on his walk home down a dark and empty street. He understood Dean’s insistence on visiting to be connected to an apology for asking Castiel to leave the bunker. He knew Dean would feel uncomfortable if Castiel voiced his actual forgiveness, he would reject it. Instead, he would sublimate his guilt into actions rather than voicing an apology. He got home, opening his freezer and deciding on the frozen taquitos that Dean had insisted he buy for his late night dinner. Castiel decided that perhaps inviting Dean on the trip would be an action of forgiveness more easily accepted than words. He tapped out a message to Dean inviting him to meet him at the lake cabin as Aaron’s uncle had offered Castiel a ride.
“So what’s on the agenda for today?” Dean seemed content to continue conversing in bed, closer to Castiel than he usually was, his head propped on his hand as he lay on his side.
“Yeah…I um. I wasn’t sure but good.” Dean didn’t make eye contact but moved his bag into the bedroom. “All good.”
‘Hello, Dean. It’s good to hear from you. I’ve wanted to talk to you, but I didn’t want to press.’ He hadn’t told Sam or Charlie this bit, but Cas had actually called and texted a lot that first week after the trip to the cabin. He’d left messages that Dean couldn’t bring himself to hear so he erased them without listening. He’d done the same with the texts too, carefully making his eyes swim over the words without absorbing them.
As they stood over the burning grave, Dean laughed slightly. “I imagined us around a fire, Cas, I wasn’t expecting it to smell like hair.”
Dean felt an urge to go yell at Sam and instead attempted to keep an even smile on his face. “Any reason I should know about?”
“He’s not kidding. He might be confused between what’s an appropriate birthday party for an off the grid thirty something hunter with barely any friends and an eleven year old’s dream birthday party, but he’s not kidding. He bought cowboy themed birthday plates.”
“If you’d like.” Cas sounded slightly short and they agreed on a few days the following month.
Dean could only stare at him, his mouth falling open.
Cas and Dean talking on the phone became a somewhat regular thing, which Sam was vocally thankful for. Dean would call him from hunting trips, hanging out at night waiting for monsters to wake up. He would call him while grocery shopping, listen to Cas talk about work. It felt different than when they-or at least Dean-had been dating. It felt easier in a way, Dean felt like he wasn’t trying as hard, which itself was a painful but helpful indication that things had turned out for the best. Dean was getting his best friend back, it was worth losing a boyfriend.
“I’d like to kiss you, Dean.” His lips were hovering, close to Dean’s, his eyes shifting between staring at his mouth and looking into his eyes. “A physical relationship is not necessary between us however I believe it would be quite enjoyable if you’re interested.”
Castiel continued to pet Dean. “I’m don’t understand the cultural reference, but happy six months to you as well.”
Sam seemed startled by Dean diving in to cleaning out the guest room he’d been holed up in with Charlie, followed by hauling out pizza boxes and take out containers from his own room.
“Steve, your boyfriend is here.” Aaron called out. He was carefully sorting marquis letters in the lobby, spelling out the words of next week’s show to ensure he had enough prepared.
“I think we should perhaps both review those relationship books you were reading because we may have a lot to learn. I know you love me. However, I believe in human relationships it is important to say it.”
“Fuck. I love you.” He mumbled into Cas’s shoulder. Cas’s fingers curled into the small of Dean’s back. They stood like that for a while, Dean half trying to keep himself from crying. Slowly, Cas dropped his arms from Dean’s back, but then raised them again to the lapels of Dean’s coat.
‘May i call you?’ Cas texted and Dean wasn’t sure how to respond. Texting felt like a return to some bit of them being friends. He thought about what it would feel like to hear his voice.
They pulled up to the cabin. It was small, but looked secure against the cooling weather. Castiel used the key Aaron had passed on to open the front door and began bringing in their bags and leftover snacks. Dean looked around and peered into the bedroom with it’s lone bed.
Dean watched Charlie’s car drive away the next day, his hand held up so she could see him waving in the rear view mirror. He decided to stop wallowing and take a different point of view. Maybe it was good that they hadn’t actually dated. The odds of any given relationship actually working out were low. Dean clearly hadn’t known how to be in a relationship. At least this way, once the awkwardness wore off, he could be Cas’s friend again. Hell, they’d gotten over the the God thing, the Leviathan thing, the Gadreel mess, they’d survived Purgatory together. Cas had sided with him over literal heaven. Bobby had called it years ago, Cas was the best friend he’d ever had and fucking that up by turning it into a relationship that would more likely than not have messily imploded within a year was a terrible idea. In retrospect, it was freaking fantastic that Dean got a do-over to just sweep it all under the rug and have it never happen.
“I’m not sure we could do that and keep my job.” Castiel responded. Dean wordlessly held out a hand and Castiel rooted in his bag and handed him an industrial sized salt shaker he had taken from work. Dean looked at it and made an approving nod. He began sprinkling a layer on the mantel, careful to place a small amount on each of the trinkets on display.
“It’s fine, and we’re not going to talk about it.” Dean attempted to look deeply interested in his laundry. “I’m going to finish sorting this out and then we are going to find a case and continue not talking about it.” He smiled grimly at Sam.
Dean groaned. “For the last time, I’m not doing therapy. I read the relationship books you told me about and they didn’t work and it’s all a crock of shit.”
Dean shifted in his seat. If he told Sam not to pick up the phone, Cas would worry and he didn’t want him to worry. If he called Cas himself, he still wasn’t sure what he would say. “Just ride it out, he’ll back off eventually, he’s course correcting.”
“I gotta go, buddy. I’ll call again soon though. Thanks for…thanks for the music.” He hung up and let the phone slip into the bed. He restarted the album and listened through it beginning to end.
“There’s always some bullshit that pops up in movies from then.” Aimee affected a British accent and rolled her eyes “‘Oh darling, don’t you love the British empire, isn’t it all going smashingly well for us’. But it’s still kind of cool to see a kind of normal looking age-appropriate couple fall in love, you know? Especially for movies back then. And the pining was well done, the ill-fated romance. Did your boyfriend like it?”
He was cut off by the ethereal visage of a woman, flashing in and out of view. His duffel was thrown across the room. Castiel wished very much for his grace as he was shoved bodily against the wall and held there. Dean’s hand flashed out, spraying salt through the ghost. Her face contorted in a noiseless screech and Castiel dropped down to the ground as her attention focused on Dean. Castiel took the opportunity to pull the sawed off shotgun, already loaded with salt shells, and shoot through the ghost. She flickered out of view. Dean rushed over checking for injuries. Cas waved him off and took the matches and gasoline out of Dean’s bag. “Dean, there’s no time. There’s a fire pit in the backyard.”
“You know, we’re going to be busy at the holidays, you should take some time off before we’re in the shit.” Aaron had been explaining his vacation plans to the team cleaning the theater and the conversation had shifted to Castiel never taking vacation. Castiel had the projection booth window open to throw down extra paper towels for a particularly large spill, and nodded rather than try and shout back to them. “My uncle has a lake house, really not much too it but if you wanted he’d rent it to you for the friends and family discount.”
Dean’s hands stilled over folding a shirt. “He’s a good guy. I-Just tell him I’m good. I’m A-OK.” Sam nodded, clearly not believing him but still walking on enough eggshells to not press the matter.
“May I kiss you, Dean?” He asked. Dean’s eyes flew open.
“No, it has to be him, there can only be one person with that car in a hundred mile radius.”
He received a response within minutes. He tried to picture Cas, maybe at work although he didn’t use his phone at work often. If it was a night off, he usually listened to music and read. He decided Cas was in his apartment on his couch, playing something jazzy since he’d been getting into jazz last summer. He probably had his phone perched on the side table by the couch, right at an angle where he’d see it light up with the message. It hurt a bit to know him so well, like the feeling of his ribs twinging where they’d been broken when it got colder.
“I neglected to write an itinerary.” He intended an aura of sarcasm which Dean clearly picked up on, but seemed to find it amusing. “Are there usually schedules for vacations?”
“Dean.”
This fic was my first attempt at writing something longer than one scene! I decided I’ll need one my chapter to close out Cas POV
It was a Thursday the next time Dean drove into town. Castiel had spent the day piecing together reels of film. He enjoyed this work, methodically slicing the pieces and carefully taping them together, choosing which trailers to place at the start. He understood most other movie theaters used digital, that this theater was anachronistic but still drew guests because it played older movies. He liked that humans were comforted seeing films they’d seen before, that they wanted to see movies they might already own on a large screen, staring into space and feeling immersed in a story, alone but sharing an experience with a crowd. His coworkers had waved Dean into the projection booth.
“Apparently I have vacation hours I need to “use or lose” which seems deeply unfair. Many of my coworkers use vacation time to visit family and friends…I’d like to visit you.” Dean’s hand tightened around the phone.
“Dean, I don’t need 50 frozen taquitos and the frozen stuffed shrimp, we have to put one back.” Castiel explained, causing Dean to regretfully tuck the shrimp back in the freezer case. Castiel knew Dean wouldn’t want to talk about why he enjoyed purchasing items in bulk, that it had not been an option as he was growing up or during his young adulthood on the road. He liked having a kitchen to stock, knowing he’d be in one place long enough to purchase paper towels and grocery bags that would last for months. There were many things Castiel knew about Dean from holding his soul in his hands when he pulled him out of purgatory, things he also knew Dean felt uncomfortable talking about or looking to closely at so he refrained from mentioning them.
“There’s Twizzlers as well. My coworkers had quite an argument and I wasn’t sure if all humans felt as intensely about licorice.” Castiel had procured one of each kind of favorite road trip snack his coworkers had recommended. “It’s for the drive. I believe we can also eat them once we’re at the cabin, however the intent is for them to be eaten while driving.”
The trip to a lake cabin goes both much better and much worse than Castiel anticipated.
Dean responded almost immediately. Castiel frowned, Dean wasn’t on a hunt which meant he was up late at the bunker, likely alone as when he was talking with someone he rarely looked at his phone mid-conversation. Dean was amenable, but wanted to pick Castiel up rather than meet him there. Plans set, Castiel ate his food and looked up things to do at a lake cabin.
When they got to the counter, Dean insisted on paying. Although his wages from the movie theater weren’t excessive, he would prefer to pay himself. Dean’s argument was not logically sound as his membership card was fraudulent and he could easily have made one using Castiel’s false name. But Castiel allowed it, it was another small way to ease Dean’s guilt over kicking him out of the bunker those months ago. They drove home, Dean humming and tapping in time to the music. It was a good way to spend a day.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas pulled back from the hug to look at him. “I apologize, there was a small amount of subterfuge. Sam picked me up from the bus station. I wanted to be here today before the others arrived.”
It took a month for Dean to work up the nerve to actually talk to Cas on the phone. His birthday came and went, he managed to talk Cas down over text from a whole big celebration. But he still got an actual gift and birthday card in the mail, a mixed bunch of vinyl that looked like Cas had gotten second hand. He had told Cas earlier that he had dusted off a record player he found in the bunker, and so he spent a weekend texting with Cas through the music he’d sent him. It had included Dean’s usual 70s rock but added in a mix of stuff he wouldn’t have thought to get himself stuff from the 50s into the 80s. It felt good to be able to lay on his bed, listening to a Donovan album, texting Cas.
This conversation had genuinely passed the point that could be solved by caffeine, but Castiel didn’t care in the moment. Castiel carefully traced Dean’s bottom lip with his thumb and Dean’s eyes closed at the touch again. The closeness felt intoxicating, and Castiel understood what Aimee had said about the tension being wonderful, however he felt a need to try the kiss as well to judge if it was in fact better than the tension. Dean may only want the tension, and not the kiss, but surely he would allow Castiel this just once, just to judge.
“I may have not known, but if given the chance, dating you would be my honor.”
‘Hello, Dean. I believe Hurdy Gurdy was an instrument, popular for several centuries. That does not rule out it being a sex reference. Double entendres are quite popular in music.’ There was a pause, and then a cat emoji. This meant Clovis had jumped up on Cas’s lap. It felt comfortable, like they were hanging out. He could picture him so clearly, even hours away, it felt like they were together. Another song came up.
“Hey, Cas. What’s playing?” He smiled, and stood close and held a hand up as though to embrace him, but ended on patting him slightly on the shoulder. In the months since Gadreel’s deceit had surfaced, Dean had often made similar abortive attempts at an embrace during his visits. Castiel had told Dean he forgave him many times, however Dean clearly still feel guilty. They walked to the diner next door for dinner.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel looked him over. Dean looked tired. He had been on a hunt in New Jersey this week and he was moving stiffly as though he had been hurt. Castiel often missed his grace, but never more than when seeing an injury he could no longer heal.
“I thought maybe fishing?” Castiel offered. Dean made a considering face at his suggestion and mimed casting a line. “I didn’t bring any fishing poles, but I believe humans used to use sticks, as we did to roast marshmallows. If you have rope in the car we could construct a net.”
“That’s just-he’s kidding.”
After watching the fire die down, they went back to the cabin, the angry spirit now at rest. Castiel changed into the clothes he brought to sleep in, and laid down on the side closer to the wall. Dean hesitated.
“Ah. That would explain why they call you that.” Castiel nodded.
“You-you didn’t know?” Dean pulled back in horror and began to pace around the room, running his hands through his hair in frustration. “ How-I told your coworkers we were dating! I introduced myself as your boyfriend!”
Something eased in his chest a bit, having this tentative friendship with Cas restored. He turned off his bedside lamp and laid back into bed and fell into a better sleep than he’d had in months.
Charlie attempted to pat Dean’s head without looking and wound up smacking him in the face. “Shhh….let the Swayze soothe you. Huh. Sam Elliot really has just the best hair doesn’t he? Do you ever think about growing out your hair?” She draped some of her hair against Dean’s head. “Ok, maybe not in this shade but I think it could work for you. I’ve definitely made drastic hair decisions post break-up and it has a 75% success rate at either making me feel better or at least making me feel sad about something that isn’t my ex. What are your thoughts on extensions?”
“What like a weepy old war movie?” Dean asked.
Dean cleared his throat and withdrew his arm and Castiel realized that while he was processing his thoughts, he had been staring ahead and frowning slightly, which may not have been the best way to prolong their interaction. He thought through how romantic tension was conveyed in movies, trailing fingers as objects are passed, finding small excuses to touch someone, staring into their eyes. He pressed his arm against Dean’s and stared into his eyes.
