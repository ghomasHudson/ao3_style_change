Everyone turns to him like he just crashed the party. "Wait. Whatcha' mean?" Tony asks with a mouthful.
Steve's lips are on his and he doesn't have the slightest idea what to do or how to cope and before he even gets enough time to gather his remaining brain cells, goddamned Stevie-boy is pulling back.
“I just can't get enough of you,” Steve murmurs against his skin, and they end up arriving very late to the pool party.
Tony realizes he’s in way over his head sometime during the second week of their fake relationship. Sometime during the first week, Steve realizes Tony doesn’t eat breakfast and usually just downs a coffee before class. Steve takes it upon himself to start bringing Tony breakfast every day in the labs early every morning. When Tony tries to tell him he’s fine, he’s used to this, he doesn’t have time for a food break when his projects are waiting and the early bell is going to ring at any moment now, the Sullen Steve Stare is applied until Tony concedes.
Steve’s lips curve up into a slow smirk that makes Tony’s mouth run dry. He shifts on the chaise, and has to bite back a soft gasp to see Steve staring back just as intently. His blue eyes are dark with purpose as he moves through the water quickly, his muscles bunching and shifting underneath sun-alchemized skin as his prowl turns predatory. Tony is reminded of a lion stalking down its prey, all coiled power and deep intensity, golden and huge.
“Drats,” Steve says mildly, not looking the least bit bothered as he picks up another fry and offers it to Tony. “There goes all of my big plans.”
The Thor thing was over a month ago, and sure Loki holds a mean grudge, but even he's not this petty. He would've retaliated long ago, if he was going to do so. Usually Loki’s revenge is swift and harsh, and then Loki forgives Tony and they move on.
“This,” Steve says, gently trailing his hand over the scars on Tony’s collarbone, topographical tales of his sacrifice, “means you got to come home to me. You saved the universe because you were so strong and brave and selfless. You saved us all.”
“May I?” Tony breathes, stroking his finger along the first envelope flap. Curiosity itches at the back of his head as he stares at the letters. His heart sticks in his throat and he may not know the contents of the preciously preserved papers, he knows they're very, very important to his mother. He aches with how tenderly she looks at him when she nods.
Thank every deity ever for Pepper though. Smart, caring, gorgeous, beautiful, wonderful, kind Pepper. She is much too good for him and he loves her so much.
Tony is slightly nauseous by the end of the ride and Steve is looking far too amused the seventh time he has to catch Tony when the violent rocking tips Tony's balance and he has to scramble for support to keep from being tossed bodily onto the floor. He hangs onto the passenger poles and Steve for dear life and he's only mildly embarrassed about falling face first into Steve's chest three times, completely not even on purpose. Halfway into the journey, a seat opens up near them and Steve quickly ushers Tony onto the plastic bench and Steve stands in front of him like a protective sentinel for the remaining duration of the ride.
Morgan heaves a deep dramatic sigh and rolls her eyes, planting her fists on her hips. In that moment, she reminds Tony so much of Steve, obstinate and self-assured. She’s already immune to his threats now, what’s Tony going to do when she’s a teenager?
The subway ride itself is uneventful enough, if not ridiculously long and surprisingly violent. It's only so interesting to look at long stretches of black tunnel as the train barrels through the underground careening sharply around bends and turns in the tracks.
They only pull away when the other team members rush up to surround them, their screams of celebration nearly deafening. Tony gets caught in the mix, still held tight in Steve's arms as his team presses up around them.  He can't keep the happy smile from his face when Steve looks so happy and jubilant in his victory, kiss swollen lips stretched wide in a joyous grin.
It makes Tony irrationally angry, sudden heat flaring from his belly and burns all the way to his heart as his cheeks bloom red with humiliation. He can't stand it. He turns on his heel and runs.
Steve chuckles and kisses his nose. “You’re a menace,” he replies, but his hand is smoothing slow circles on the swell of Tony’s ass.
At home, he digs up the box he keeps full of Steve’s notes, printed photographs, ticket stubs and restaurant business cards from their fake dates. Sentimental paraphernalia Tony was too soft to ever throw out. He contemplates burning the whole thing now but something stops him. He can’t bear to do it. The first note Steve ever wrote him is near the top of the pile, a simple “I hope you’ll have a nice day today,” with a couple of heart doodles. Just seeing that scrap of paper has Tony shaking all over again. He can’t bring himself to destroy the box, but there’s enough rage in him to throw it across the room.
Tony scoffs, wanting nothing more than to get away. He gets up and tries to push past Steve to get out of the lab but Steve is blocking the door and he is not budging. “I don't fucking care, Rogers. It's none of my business. Now get out of my way.”
Luckily, Steve isn't stupidly frozen. “Hey,” he says with a bright smile as he slings an arm across Tony's shoulders to pull him close as though they do this all the time. They start walking. “How was class?”
Tony feels ridiculous and childish. How is he going to get through life if he starts hyperventilating every time his father calls him? He rises reluctantly from next to Steve on the rug and pockets his phone again, trying to arrange his features into a calm expression of nonchalance.
Tony remembers a time when they weren't complete strangers. When things were a little easier between them, a little friendlier, a little less like they were separated by a wall of ice. Tony's heart twists, the bitter taste of regret welling in the back of his throat.
“They kind of remind me of us,” Tony says sleepily when Kirk and Spock finally meet at Starfleet, already feeling as though he's drifting off.
There are people everywhere, and everyone wants a piece of Steve as they try to move through the rooms. Steve's large hand is held tight in Tony's grip as they try to navigate through the well wishers, Steve politely but firmly circumventing any attempts at conversation. Steve uses his bulk to bulldoze through the swarm, pushing past the throngs of people crowding makeshift dance floor of Thor's dining room packed with gyrating bodies.
Who would've thought the star players of their formidable football team play Dungeons and Dragons in their spare time. And they call
, Steve twisting his body to cushion Tony's fall. There's hardly a pause in the kiss as they land, Tony seating himself atop Steve's thighs while long fingers dip beneath the hem of his hoodie and deftly relieve him of his pants and underwear.
Steve doesn’t visit him in the medical wing again. The chair sits empty for the next three days Bruce forces Tony to stay in bed.
“Wow, daddy,” Morgan says as she peers up at him, her dark eyes wide with awe and happiness. She wraps her small arms tight around his shoulders.
Tony has never really celebrated Christmas, not even when his mother was alive and Howard was slightly less of a dick. The holiday season was usually reserved for galas and events and fundraisers, Tony often left home alone with Jarvis and Ana or toted along like an accessory to be shown off.
“That's none of your business,” Tony replies, feeling a spark of agitation igniting in his chest. He doesn't even know why he's still having this conversation. He could be halfway home by now. He’s reaching for his phone to text Happy to come get him when Steve's next question stops him with his hand halfway to his pocket.
Tony hums in agreement, arching slightly to look back at Steve behind him. “You married a futurist and genius, remember?” he replies smugly, heart warming when Steve looks back at him with adoration clear on his face. He leans in for another kiss and then there’s the wet blunt head of Steve’s cock pressing against him. It burns a little as Steve pushes in slowly, Steve’s cock is huge, and it was barely enough preparation but Tony wants it, wants all of him.
Steve shakes his head, but he’s smiling when he says, “you know why. Appearances and all of that good stuff. We have no excuses to not go. You need to get ready,” he says, eying Tony's disheveled hair critically.
They stay friends after the summer ends and for a long time, Janet is one of Tony's only friends, his best friend after Rhodey, and Tony is besotted with her.
“Well that too,” Tony says agreeably, reaching up to touch where Steve had fastened his favorite pin on his lapel. A blue hexagonal diamond set in gold, a replica of Tony's arc reactor in miniature. Another mark of his Steve wears proudly. How did Tony get so lucky?
The enormous house is full by the time they arrive, packed to the rafters with the team and their friends, people from school, and even members of the opposing team. Someone found the controls for the speakers and there's loud music filtering from the sound system with enough bass to make the floors shake. There's a makeshift bar on the dining room table covered from one end to the other with bottles of everything from bourbon and whiskey to beer and soda. Someone tries to push a drink into Tony's hand as they weave through the crowd that's taken over Thor’s cavernous living room.
Tony loves Steve so much, he aches with how intensely everything feels firebright and crystal sharp every time Steve is near him. He cannot possibly lose this because he's being stupid, not again, not when he can finally,
Tony squints at him. “Not one bit.” He wonders a little at Steve’s shift in behavior when just earlier in the day, he seemed cautious about their fake relationship, but Tony ultimately decides not to look the gift stallion in the mouth. He’ll appreciate the (rather thorough) cooperation while he has it.
Peggy sighs softly. “I know a thing or two about demanding parents,” she says, smiling ruefully, not pretending she didn’t hear at least the tail end of his conversation with Howard. “I was originally from London,” she continues. “My mum is very firm about our grades regardless of how many times we moved.”
They’ve all lost people, but out of all of them Clint and Thor feel the grief and regret the heaviest. Clint because he lost his children, something none of them can fathom. Thor because not only has he lost his brother and his people, but because he came
Tony takes a deep breath and steels himself, ready for the deluge of disappointment. Amazingly, it does not come.
Steve finally sees Tony when he reaches the far end of the pool and twists around to make his return trip. Tony knows the exact moment his husband notices him as he kicks off from the wall underneath the water, picking up speed as he races back towards the other side. His smooth strokes cut through the water, leaving heaving waves in his wake.
The day of the big game dawns bright and brisk, a sharp chill in the mid December air. The sky is a bright cornflower blue that dusks down purple and navy as afternoon falls swiftly into evening.
Tony sucks in a sharp breath. A child. Is it his? If it is, why hasn’t Pepper brought them around to see him? Does he have a kid he’s missed nearly four years of their life running around? His head is spinning as he croaks, “how old?”
Tony throws his head back against the pillows, his neck a long smooth column Steve wants to taste. He presses his tongue against the skin there, tracing a wet line up to his jaw, while his fingers thrust shallowly to open Tony up for his cock.
“And the Peggy thing was all you,” Steve continues, barreling on. “I never once said I even wanted to get back together with her. I haven't felt that way about her in a long time, our relationship was over. We always made much better friends than we ever did as anything else and in the back of my mind, there was always you anyways, and no one could ever match up to you.” Steve sighs and shoves a hand through his already disheveled hair.
Tony's heart squeezes painfully in his chest. He blows Steve a kiss before turning back to Nat who is looking at him with open fondness.
“Language,” Steve scolds, but there's no heat behind his reprimand. He's still struggling with the last of his giggles.
This is where Tony knows he's supposed to tell Peggy how much Steve misses her, and how perfect she is for him, and Steve is doing all of this for her, but the words get lodged in his throat and refuse to come out. He can feel them rising like vomit from the back of his throat even as his feet carry him through the door and away down the hall. The words taste like bitter bile when he forcibly swallows them back down again.
There was a time in his past life, in a farmhouse, when Tony realized he could’ve had everything he’d ever wanted. It was splayed in front of him, sprawled starfish across the narrow shared bed, broad chest rising and falling in steady breaths. Tony had watched and ached as the flutter of golden lashes brushed across high cheeks and his fingers itched to reach over and touch.
The same debrief package that had information on Howard’s son, who went by ‘Tony’ and who happened to be the world’s most famous superhero.
"Hello, Deere," Tony says as he goes inside the barn and finds the tractor. "Tell me everything. What ails you?"
It’s him, but it’s not him, he’s something else, something unusual—it has nothing to do with James. So who is he? And who is James?
"Hi. Got company. Sorry, didn't call ahead," Clint apologizes and the woman smiles and gives him a tight hug.
And a week later, when Rhodey’s about to go back to base, Tony shares quite the piece of information: “Oh, I forgot to tell you,” he says as Rhodey’s about to get into his rental car. “Obie is quite positive we might be landing a military contract next month,” he says and Rhodey widens his eyes. “They were a bit doubtful at first because they say I’m no Howard but Obie managed to convince them I’m the real deal,” he adds.
Tony sighs as he draws away. “What did Steve say?” He's too tired to really get annoyed about anything anymore. He's at the stage of sleep deprivation where his eyes are just beginning to cross and Pepper is starting to blur at the edges where she wavers in front of him. As far as he knows, Pepper might be a mirage. She’s way too good to be true.
“You can take it, baby,” Steve murmurs, and Tony nods, yeah he can take it, even though he feels stretched to his limit. “So good,” Steve says encouragingly, his voice rough like jagged gravel, “you feel so good around me. Perfect and so tight and all mine. Just look at you, sweetheart. You’re so gorgeous like this. You take my cock so well. Like you were made for me. I just want to keep you full all day, stuffed full of my cock and my come. I can’t believe you’re mine.”
If this is going to be his last time with Steve, Tony sure as hell is going to enjoy it. He certainly doesn’t have the strength to untangle himself from Steve’s arms to even begin unraveling himself from this mess.
is there, TS for Tony Stark, the letters proudly worn by his husband). The buttons on the shirt go all the way up to his throat and cover the sacred heart that belongs to Tony too.
“That’s right,” Steve says. His tone turns serious when he adds, “Tony, I don’t know how the serum is going to affect my aging process. So far it hasn’t been anything extreme. It’s not like I look twenty-seven fresh out of the ice anymore and I will be there with you through all of the aging milestones, for the rest of our lives. We said til death do us part and I mean that. I will
They pass rows of their friends, some of whom still look gobsmacked, and others smiling through tears when they realize what’s happening. Perhaps it hadn’t been the best idea to have a surprise wedding, but neither Tony nor Steve had wanted to make it a big ostentatious event. They had simply wanted all of their friends and teammates present, and the monthly Avengers assembly was the perfect time. It’s a far cry from Tony’s last wedding, nearly opposite in all ways. This is simple and intimate, without the extravagance and months-long planning and news and tabloid speculation.
,” Tony moans as kisses trail down his jaw to his shoulder and further still to his wrist. Tony had never really given much thought to his hands as erogenous zones but he quickly realizes just how sensitive they are when Steve brushes soft little kisses along his knuckles and drags his lips along the calloused webbing between his fingers. He drops a final kiss to Tony's palm before coming up again to press his mouth against the column of Tony's neck.
“Oh,” Steve says, his cheeks slightly pinked. “Ah, I didn’t make that, sorry. I didn’t think you would want me to cook for you so I’ve been going to that diner we met at? The one in Brooklyn, it’s like twelve blocks from my house. I figured you liked that place since it was your suggestion to meet there and the sandwich I had that time was pretty good and Ben’s deli is too crowded in the mornings so I just go get your—“
Tony doesn’t know what to say to any of that. He feels overwhelmed with everything Steve just told him, and his brain has to rewire itself to even process Steve’s words. He’s still reeling from everything Steve just said, the words washing over him and he’s barely grasping any of it, but that one singular thought keeps repeating in his head.
“This,” Steve says, resting his palm against Tony’s sternum, feeling the bumps and ridges of the scarring beneath his hand, and the steady beat of the heart below his skin, “is
Tony closes his eyes and breathes. Steve waits patiently as Tony mulls over the offer. He watches the rise and fall of Tony’s chest as Steve continues trailing his fingers across Tony’s abdomen, tracing along the sensitive raised scars and inked tattoos in his skin. He can feel Tony shivering in his arms when he finds the sensitive areas, and he lingers at Tony’s waist, drawing slow circles into the crest of his hips.
As he’s about to brush past Peggy to the door, she touches his arm and he stops in his tracks. Her hand falls away as she looks at him. She’s not wearing her usual red lipstick, Tony notices.
Loki doesn't say anything for a long time, and Tony hates the look he sees on his friend’s face. It's one part pity and two parts sadness. “Oh, Stark,” Loki finally sighs, and really, those two words say it all.
Tony leans against his locker and opens the carefully folded note to find it simply says, “I hope you’ll have a nice day today,” surrounded with little doodles of hearts.
Steve smirks and steals Tony's orange soda to wash down his pastrami rye. “If you wanted to see me naked, all you had to do was ask.”
Tony can’t help but find the faint blush dusting Steve’s cheeks absolutely adorable. “Aww gee, thanks,” Steve says, fidgeting where he stands. “He must be what? A sophomore now? I see he’s still taking those amazing photos. Peter is Ben’s nephew,” he tells Tony. “He’s really talented. He takes pictures for the school paper.”
Flurries of paper flutter down around Tony, giant assorted snowflakes. The scrap that lands nearest him is a copy of the school newspaper with him and Steve on the front page and Tony picks it up, holding it listlessly between numb fingers. It's the single piece of publication with him in it he's ever kept, simply because he and Steve had looked so happy in that photo. It was the night they won the state championship and they're standing front and center in the photo with the team surrounding them. Steve's face is turned away from the camera, his features cast in sharp profile as he kisses a smiling Tony's cheek.
Steve Rogers is walking down the hall and he stops at the locker bank right outside the lab. He commands every space he walks through, drawing every eye to him as he walks past. Star quarterback and now newly minted captain of the football team, half of the school worships the ground Steve walks on. Tony can swear a hush falls as he stops in the hall.
Steve smiles and reaches over to wipe away some sauce from the corner of Tony's mouth. He either doesn't notice or pretends he doesn't notice the way Tony freezes with his breath caught in his throat as his thumb strokes over the curve of Tony's jaw.
Steve intimately knows the pain of hating his own reflection. He’s suffered through years of broken disconnect, not seeing the weak sickly boy from Brooklyn in the hulking soldier who stares back at him in the glass. It had taken Tony and ink and no small amount of pain to reclaim the biggest parts of himself and seeing the same ache he once knew in Tony's eyes breaks Steve’s heart.
Tony sighs, already feeling overwhelmed by everything bearing down on him all at once. Good things only last so long for him, and even having a couple of days for a weekend to spend with friends has been a luxury. It’s back to work as soon as they get back to New York the next afternoon and Tony expects he’ll be spending every spare hour in the lab from now until graduation.
Tony stretches, arching his spine off the chair as he raises his arms, the entire curved bow of his body on display. He watches as Steve’s eyes track his every movement like Tony had done to Steve when he was getting out of the pool. Steve’s gaze feels like a liquid hot caress as it slides down from Tony's face to the long lean line of his torso, and further down to where Tony’s legs are splayed open in invitation. A deep curl of satisfaction blooms in Tony's chest when he sees the hungry expression on his husband’s face and he widens the sprawl of his thighs.
Tony bites back a breathless laugh as he settles his cheek against his arm, enjoying the way he knows Steve is staring at him, admiring the tattoo that had once started as a joke. Steve will never admit to liking it, but Tony knows it drives him crazy to see his name on Tony’s skin like this. He can feel Steve’s fingertips trace the letters and follow further down to the dip in his spine and lower still. He gasps when he feels Steve’s large hands settle on his ass, kneading at him and spreading him open. And then there’s the warm gust of Steve’s breath against his skin and the unmistakable wet trail of Steve’s mouth against the tight furl of his hole.
“But,” Steve continues, a hint of humor creeping into his voice, “since I’m dating a celebrity now, I might as well bask in the attention and take advantage,” he says with a wide smile. “Do you think we can get free stuff? Like if I tell people I’m with Tony Stark, do I get to skip lines at the supermarket and get more free cheese samples?”
“God, you're so fucking hot when you do that, you fucking smartass,” Tony breathes, finally managing to pull Steve close for a searing kiss. “I fucking hate it,” he says against Steve's lips.
He takes it gratefully and downs three large gulps of the scalding hot drink before he manages to rasp, “Pepper….”
Despite the rocky start, their fake date ends up being a lot of fun. Tony hadn't expected it, but Steve shows a lot of interest in NASA and the history of space travel with keen excitement for the exhibit bordering on giddiness. They tour the planetarium slowly as Tony babbles at Steve, unloading information on him in a continuous nervous stream and Steve smiles indulgently and lets him ramble about the Hubble telescope and how when they landed Apollo 11 on the moon, all of NASA’s computing power can fit inside of a modern thumb drive. He prompts Tony along with interesting questions, and they spend much of the afternoon circling the space exhibit as they talk.
Steve spots an opening, his whole body twisting as he spirals the ball in a curving helix. The ball barely makes it out of his hand before Steve is tackled to the ground, buried beneath a wave of bodies and Tony leaps to his feet in outrage. He starts forward as though he thinks he can actually run down onto the grass before Pepper pulls him back down into his seat.
He reads the letters again, and his heart crumbles. It breaks for his mother, who had loved Howard so much. It breaks for the man his father might have been once, but will never be again, the wide eyed romantic left to rot at the bottom of a bottle. It breaks for how fervently he wishes he could have known Howard like that too. It breaks for his mother, who still hopes.
“Welcome to the rest of the world,” Steve replies cheerfully. “That's what it's like for us regular folk. We're forever at the mercy of the subway system.”
Tony can tell Steve is barely restraining himself from thrusting up sharply into the heat of his mouth. He starts bobbing his head along the length of Steve’s cock, swallowing and sucking hard with each slide down, his hand wrapping around what he can’t fit in his mouth. He can feel his swollen lips stretched obscenely wide around Steve, and he looks up at his husband through his damp lashes and the fogged lenses of his glasses to see Steve watching him. The blue of his eyes are a thin ring around his wide black pupils.
They seem happy enough to Tony whenever he passes them in the hall, laughing and joking with each other, Steve's arm always casually slung across Peggy's shoulders. They're looking for all the world like they're wildly in love. He tries not to think about the rumors, and how they could've possibly started and ignores them because they're none of his business.
“Rogers,” he says to the front of his locker. The paint peeling at the edge of his locker door is so fascinating, it's shaped just like Maui and with the oncoming winter and cold that's creeping down from further north, maybe he should consider moving to—extended visiting—a tropical island instead of Siberia.
Tony pulls away breathlessly as soon as he realizes what he's doing. He cannot believe he's kissing Steve in front of the whole school and their rival school like this under the bright glare of the Friday night lights but he can't help himself. He ducks down for another kiss, and another, and another. He feels possessed and unable to stop, drawn irrevocably to the feeling of Steve's lips against his own and he's already fucked, he's already addicted.
been actually dating for months. Five months, one week and four days. That's how long we've been dating, and how long it took you to realize it.” His frown melts into a fond smile as he finally allows himself to be tugged forward, his free hand coming up to wreathe long fingers in Tony's hair. “That's okay,” he says gently. “I was—
They should talk about this, they really need to clear everything up and vocalize what this all means—if it means anything at all. Tony knows this logically, knows it’s the right thing to do, but his hands move of their own accord. Before he fully realizes what he’s doing, his fingers are curling into the fabric of Steve’s sweater and dragging him close and Steve is mirroring his motions, large hands sliding beneath Tony's shirt to encircle his waist.
be ashamed of you. Besides,” he says, fondness slipping into his tone, “how can I ever be ashamed to have such a gorgeous silver fox on my arm?” Steve leans down to hook his chin over Tony’s shoulder as they lock eyes in their reflection.
Tony starts spending every waking hour in the labs. Sometimes, Bruce is there with a cup of tea quietly working at his station, mumbling about the possibility of interdimensional travel if they can somehow go down to the subatomic level, there was this study he read once, what’s the name again, Hank something.
“Yeah I heard of you,” Barnes had replied sullenly, but he didn't say anything else about what he might've heard about Tony. He simply gave Steve an unreadable look before turning back to his lunch.
He looks over at Tony snuggled up against his shoulder and knows he’ll need a course of action to prove over and over how deserving Tony is of admiration and love, how much of that he already has. Good thing Steve is nothing if not a man with a plan.
Tony nods and he consciously tries to loosen his fists where they’re curled into the sheets. “T-that’s good,” he says. He doesn’t ask why he still hasn’t seen her, or where she is now.
Tony sighs, dropping his hand on top of hers. His heartbeat beneath both their palms is sluggishly slow despite how fast the thoughts are whirling in his head. “Thanks for coming, but you don’t have to worry about me. I’m not sick or dying or anything. I’ll get over this.”
“Why don't you just ask one of your other friends to do this, Tony?” Steve asks, sounding exasperated. “Wouldn't that be more believable?” He looks tired and slightly defeated and Tony can tell he's almost convinced. He's going to say yes.
“That sounds good, Pep,” Rhodey says. “I’m going to miss you guys,” he adds and it’s all Tony can do to keep the tears in when Rhodey bites his lip like that, as though he’s about to cry too.
“Nice to meet you too, Tony,” Ben replies genially. “Enough of this old man blabbering. You probably have to go back to class soon. What can I get for you? Your usual, Steve?”
“You’re a menace,” Steve repeats, rolling them over to pin Tony underneath him, his hand catching Tony’s to push it down on the pillow above his head. Their cuffs clink together as Steve leans down for a kiss.
It had been over a decade and a lifetime. Through the pain and the joy and the end of the world they’ve found and refound and claimed each other. It had taken far too long for them to reach this happy ending and it had cost everything, but Tony would pay the price an infinite amount of times over because Steve is worth it.
He had been dreading coming back to school all summer, his anxiety skyrocketing after Rhodey left, but he’s eternally grateful he at least has Pepper and their small group of friends.
They had chosen a terrible day to visit the museum. They had not had the foresight to realize weekends are extra crowded and the museum is overrun with children and their parents, all eager to run through the exhibits and exclaim over dinosaur bones and shiny rocks.
Steve tilts his chin up for a kiss. His eyes are glinting with promise when he murmurs, “I definitely will.”
He knows the future set ahead of him. It is unchangeable and unbendable, chosen for him before he was even born. He does not need to be good at writing to build weapons for his father’s company.
They should just work on winning Peggy back as soon as possible so Steve can be with the person he really wants, and so Tony doesn’t have to keep this secret from his friends any longer. One part of him wants to get everything over with and just confess. He can probably beg for Pepper and Rhodey’s forgiveness and they might even forgive him. Eventually. He might even survive the embarrassment of his friends’ shock and pity for going through this elaborate ruse in the first place but another part of him likes Steve’s attention way too much to put an end to the charade so quickly.
Tony might've found the boggled stares funny if they weren't directed at him, and more specifically, at him and Steve as they walk into school together on Monday. Instead, there are butterflies with lead tipped wings fluttering in his belly, their weight heavy and unwelcome. He should be used to being the center of everyone's attention. He's attended galas and events and press conferences for Stark Industries, been the focus of tabloid speculation, had his photo taken unexpectedly in the streets, but this feels different somehow. Strange, and heavy, and brittle, all at the same time.
Afterwards, they fall asleep curled up together with Tony’s head pillowed on Steve’s chest as snow continues to fall outside the huge windows.
It's so very different from the Stark mansion even after the huge house was filled with cheer from his friends. The Rogers house isn't oppressively large and empty, bright where it's cold and drafty, and not inhabited by ghosts that won’t leave. It's cozy and warm and filled with love, and Tony is so grateful to be invited to be there.
Tony barks a laugh, his gut clenching. “Yeah I really fucking do,” he agrees, and Pepper doesn't even know the half of it.
The first email comes from Howard on the Sunday before Thanksgiving. Tony used to wonder if this is how parents normally talk to their children, but watching Steve and Sarah stringing holly on the mantle and singing along to pop songs on the radio, the cold confirmation comes that no, it's not. His and Howard's relationship never has been and never will be normal.
“Oh my god,” Tony groans, finally giving into the urge to cover his face with his hands. He waits until Sarah walks out of earshot before reminding Steve, “bad porno.”
. I broke that promise once, but I never will again. Today, I’m renewing that oath, and I’m promising you
Tony doesn't want it to end, not when it feels so good to be in Steve's arms and to feel his touch and to see the adoration reflected in Steve's eyes, misdirected and misguided as it is.
Steve rolls his eyes and tightens his grip on Tony's hand. Tony watches helplessly as Happy cheerfully waves at them from where he stands by the nice comfy car parked at the side of the street.
“Nothing I do is healthy for me,” Tony mumbles to himself. “And certainly not getting into this mess with Steve,” he sighs. “Whoever sent out those fucking letters can go to hell. That’s what started this whole thing.”
“You have it so bad,” Nat murmurs into his temple, where she presses a soft kiss to the curls there.
He and the team haven't gotten off on the best foot but they're getting there. Steve's best friend in particular wasn't all too taken with Tony at the start.
“You’ve made your point. I demand to be taken to bed now,” Tony rasps, his breath hitching again when Steve pinches the nipple between his fingers. Tony rolls his hips back to press his ass against Steve’s crotch in retaliation, moaning when he feels how hard Steve’s cock already is pressed up along his back.
is yelling. “This idiot, what a dumbas—dummy—Jesus Christ, coming in here to show me some dumb plastic toy—
“I love it when you talk dirty,” Tony says, and Steve laughs as he finally allows himself to be pulled in for a kiss. And a second. And a third. “We would’ve left early anyways. We hate events like these. As much fun as it is to grope you in public under the table, it’s much more fun when it’s just the two of us at home, don’t you think?”
“Good lord, have mercy on me,” Steve gasps, pinching Tony lightly and kissing him to stop him from torturing him more.
“Don't be so dramatic, Tones,” Rhodey sighs, still holding Pepper’s arm. “It's only like four hours away.”
“Hey, Anthony Edward Stark,” Steve begins, the softest of smiles curving his lips. His eyes are bright and blue under the setting evening sun. “I’m so happy to be standing in front of you today, with your hand in mine. I’m so grateful you chose to forgive me and love me even after everything we’ve been through. I don’t always deserve that forgiveness and love, but I work every day to be a better man, so I may one day finally do.
She pulls away with a sigh and reaches over to hug Pepper. “We’re about to head out, James,” she says gently to Rhodey, and heads back to the car while he says his goodbyes.
“Are you sure you're okay?” Steve asks again, ever intuitive. “You know—” he cuts off and swallows audibly before continuing. “You know you can tell me anything, right? If you want to. If it'll help.”
“Um, yeah,” Tony replies. “How is he even real? Maybe he’s a robot or something programmed to infiltrate humanity or like maybe he’s some kind of experiment on how to be the perfect romantic partner—”
It had always been Steve. His first love, his greatest love. This is a love he had spent a lifetime running from, one he could never hope to shake, and one he didn’t think he would get to keep. But impossibly through anger, and pain, and betrayal, and hate, and happiness, and laughter, and healing, and love, they found their way home to each other. This is what the playwrights yearned for, and the poets envied. Somehow Tony gets to have this, gets to keep this, gets to keep Steve. Steve, his husband.
Steve laughs and shakes his head. “Also not Mormon by the way, but thanks, I guess. Glad the disguise is working. They'll never see it coming when I finally reveal my true colors.”
Neither he nor Tony had given much thought to it at the time. Even now, Steve doesn’t think about it for the most part but recently, he sees Tony flinch when he walks past the mirror, scurrying past his own reflection as though something’s nipping at his heels. On occasion, Steve sees Tony pause as he nears the mirror, grimacing into the glass before moving quickly away.
His hands shake as the glow cuts through the darkness of his room. It comforted him when he had to give up his arc reactor to power the ship, and along with it the light he couldn’t sleep without. Now it settles him as he goes through the familiar routine. Flip. Scroll. Voicemail.
Tony watches as Steve scores again, intermittently turning to look back at Tony and completely ignoring the small crowd vying for his attention. His eyes are alight with a glowing smile as he gives Tony and Nat a little wave.
Tony reads through the handful of letters his mother gives him, each one more loving than the last. He almost drops the sheaf of papers after the reading the first page, hit with the cold realization these words were written by Howard. Tony's brain short circuits, trying to reconcile the man in the letters with the cold, angry man who lives at the bottom of a bottle. He wants to give the papers back; he doesn't feel like he should be reading these.
tuts disapprovingly when she sees their leftovers, so they keep eating to make her happy. They laugh and eat and play footsie under the table like teenagers, Tony grinning back at the gentle smile playing at the edge of Steve’s lips.
“Hey, are you free this weekend?” Steve asks suddenly on one such day. It’s a perfect late October afternoon, warm for so late in the year, sunny and golden crisp.
It was only a matter of time anyways, and this end is as good as any. Howard is constantly breathing down his neck, and it’s not worth his father’s ire for a relationship that isn’t even real. This is the only foregone conclusion he and Steve could’ve ever had. It’s
“Well you're going to have to tell him no,” Bucky says. He pauses as Clint signs something to him. “Clint agrees. No new PCs midgame.”
“You still draw?” Tony asks, surprised, turning slightly in Steve's arms to look up at him. He hasn’t seen any of Steve’s actual drawings in years, not since they had detention together and Steve would spend hours working on elaborate pieces to pass the time. Tony had heaped mountains of praise on his work then because it was true. Steve was extremely talented.
They forget to set the alarm and end up sleeping straight past midnight. Tony wakes up in the early hours of morning cuddled with Steve beneath the pillowfort. It's a quarter after two and he is so warm and comfortable, he is loath to get up. He impulsively presses a small kiss to Steve's lips thinking he's still asleep. He doesn't expect Steve's arms to curl tighter around his waist and for Steve to sleepily return the kiss so fervently.
Tony quietly pads over to the balcony doors, uncaring of his nudity, and steps barefoot onto the sun warmed clay of their patio and further out to their private pool overlooking the ocean. There, he sees his husband swimming laps, sluicing through the water in graceful form-perfect strokes.
Tony's mental spiral screeches to a halt when Pepper sits down in front of him and places a venti americano with three extra shots on the table. She arches a brow as she looks at him, her face expressionless and pushes the cup forward.
“I’ve also decided I will write you at least two notes every day,” Steve says. Tony blinks at him blankly. “Peggy always said I wasn’t romantic enough, so I figured I should practice doing things like write love notes,” Steve explains, shrugging, and the slightly uncomfortable look creeps back onto his face.
The memory of her fire often comes to mind though, how brightly she burns, like a star in nova. Janet taught him to be brave, and that year, for the first time, he stands up to Howard. When Howard tells him his internship at SI will be starting soon, Tony remembers the fire in Janet’s eyes and he tells his father
“Right,” Tony nods, staring blankly at the cup Steve places in front of him. “Thanks for that. But anyways. Proposition time. Here's my offer: we pretend we're dating until I can successfully play it off that this whole letter thing was a mistake. And that Pepper’s letter meant absolutely nothing, because obviously, out of all the people who got letters, I ‘chose’ you. I’m not going to get between her and Rhodey. So then we ‘break up’ and Pepper and I can go back to being friends, and everything goes back to normal. I'll of course pay you for your help, just name your price.”
“I woke up this morning without my husband next to me,” Tony says, playing up the pout and throwing in some puppy eyes by staring up at Steve from beneath his lashes for good measure.
Tony drags him down for another kiss, and Steve can taste salt on his lips. He blindly reaches up to wipe the moisture from his husband’s cheek, his thumb a gentle caress along the curve of Tony’s jaw. He’s unsure whose tears they are, but he kisses Tony’s face until the salt is gone, listening to the echo of Tony’s thudding heart pressed against his own.
“Are you ready?” Pepper asks softly as she walks up to them. She looks Tony over with a gentle smile when he rises back to his feet, and brushes her palms down his lapel like Rhodey had done. She helpfully wipes away some of the lipgloss Morgan had smeared outside the line of his lips with her thumb, dabbing at the color to remove some of its brightness.
She understands him differently than his best friend Rhodey does. Where Rhodey sees him as a bright fire that needs containment and soothing, a liquid cool counterpart to where Tony burns out of control, Janet burns just as bright as he does, blazing hot and destructive.
,” Tony breathes, the realization barreling into him like a punch to the gut. He's not usually the last in the room to know something, and the realization that he's missed something as big as this because he's been blinded for so long is humbling. “You actually counted.”
He spends a day feeling sorry for himself before he climbs out of bed and wanders around until he finds Steve and Natasha in the gym. He watches them for several long minutes as they circle gracefully around each other, more dance than fight, both lethal in different ways, perfectly matched, beautiful and deadly.
It makes Tony irrationally angry to see Rhodey tiptoeing around him too. Of all people, he had thought his best friend would be willing to be honest with him.
“Seems to be working fine so far,” Tony says, feeling the heavy weight in his chest dissipate a little.
But Tony doesn't tell Steve how much he hates it, hates how he's been set on the path to be a merchant of death long before he even understood what war means. He doesn't tell Steve about the sleepless nights spent awake thinking about his name printed on weapons deployed to destroy cities and lives. He doesn't tell Steve the screams he hears in his head and the roar of explosions he knows he made. He doesn't tell Steve he can't watch the news anymore, can't stomach any of it. He doesn’t tell Steve he dreams often of Rhodey in a fighter jet getting shot down by a Stark Industries drone. He doesn't tell Steve how sick it made him feel to ever think Steve might've thought of signing up to add his name to the list of men and women dying too young.
Tony looks across the table to see Clint staring at him speculatively. Clint taps at the back of his ear to switch on his hearing aid and says incredulously, “You're dating
Steve's eyes are half lidded when he lifts Tony's hand to brush a kiss against his knuckles. “My dad, he wasn't around often, but he did his best,” he says, likely misreading Tony's stricken expression. “He worked a lot so we would never go hungry. Worked himself into an early grave,” Steve says sadly, his gaze looking far away. “But he always made time during Christmas so we could be together as a family.”
“Are you sure you’re not just imagining the man I was all those years ago?” Tony quips, but there’s a wobbly edge to his voice that twists at Steve’s heart. The edges of Tony’s eyes are pink, and Steve notices distantly that his thumb that had traveled up to stroke along Tony’s cheek is wet.
Tony can hear Steve’s sharp inhale when his eyes land on the tattoo on Tony’s lower back, the “Property of SR” inked in black right above his ass.
And there’s the heavy thought that in a few short years, Rhodey is going to be far away, training for combat to possibly be deployed into an active war zone and he’ll be too far from Tony’s reach to save and what if the weapons he builds for SI aren’t enough to keep their own people safe not enough to keep Rhodey safe what if what if what if—
The noise in the stadium is deafening as the red and blue wave leaps to its feet as one, stomping and cheering.
Tony had been careless then, he had somehow allowed himself to get cornered in an empty hallway one day between classes and he was surrounded in seconds. There were four of them, and they were as big as they were dumb. Tony couldn't help himself. He never could keep his damn mouth shut, as Howard always liked to say.
The trains are often empty at night when Steve rides with Tony to take him home. Tony thinks it's silly for Steve to waste the time bringing him back uptown, but Steve always insists and Sarah insists alongside him. Tony is helpless against two Rogers.
“Hi, Ben,” the smile Steve gives the deli owner is warm and bright like the one he had given Sandra. “How’s the family?”
He runs for six days. For six days, Tony feels sick to his stomach thinking of what Natasha did. His whole body is left feeling cold with betrayal but his chest is redfire agony, and it's more pain than he's ever known.
It feels like an eternity before Steve reaches him even with his quick stride, and Tony feels overheated by the time Steve nears. He swallows, his throat feeling tight. He places his cup down on the ground and settles back against the chair, slowly spreading his legs. He can see the slight falter in his husband's step when he sees Tony fully naked and laid out on the lounge.
Tony tangles his hand in the dog tags hanging from his neck as he watches, and he has a hitch in his breath by the time Steve buttons his shirt all the way up his chest, closing over the ink on his chest (his
Steve doesn’t have anything in mind when he crosses the room quietly and slips behind Tony, only knowing he needs to comfort his husband and erase the sad expression from his face. He loops his arms around Tony’s middle where they fit perfectly at the notch of his waist and it says a lot for both of them that Tony doesn’t startle. He simply sighs again as he melts against Steve’s chest.
“This relationship,” Tony clarifies. “I know it’s been a rough couple of weeks for you, with all of the extra scrutiny.”
- I never wanted Peggy to come off as an antagonist or a bitch. While the role of the ex-girlfriend in the source material was petty and spiteful, I wanted Peggy to be empathetic and kind. Any negative thoughts about her are only Tony’s misconceptions about her relationship with Steve.
“You don't have to kiss me when no ones watching, you know,” Tony says, and immediately hates himself.
“Loving, kind, tenacious, generous, tiny,” Steve continues with a wide grin, as Tony makes a small noise of protest.
Steve's eyes are blown nearly black when he raises his head again to look at Tony, his lips swollen and pink from their kisses. “Have you done this before?” Steve asks, a furrow of concern creasing his brow.
Steve is with him, as though he’s afraid if he so much as raises his voice, Tony will disappear and be gone forever. It’s stupid and ridiculous and Tony hates it. He hates the hollow look in Steve’s eyes. He hates the quiet tone of his voice. He hates the way Steve treats him like fine china, fragile and breakable. But most of all, he hates the way he misses the way they used to fight.
“I'm going to give you the world one day,” Tony promises, tucking the pen behind his ear for safekeeping as he gulps down the rest of his coffee.
Tony laughs, the sound ringing as hollow as he feels. “No choice. It’s never a choice with you, is it?” he asks bitterly.
Tony can feel Steve’s steady pulse beneath his fingertips as he leans up for a proper kiss. Everything melts away as Steve leans in and their lips meet. Tony feels engulfed by his husband from head to toe as Steve bears down on him, pressing them together skin to skin, and he feels protected and safe covered by Steve’s larger body. Steve above him shades him from the morning sun, but Tony doesn’t care. He has little use for sunlight when Steve is so bright.
Steve wants to keep his eyes open so he doesn’t miss a thing: from the flutter of Tony's long lashes against the high crest of his cheeks to the soft inhale as Steve moves one hand from his jaw to the line of Tony's throat and down to his chest. His fingers skirt around the scars that make Tony self-conscious, traveling along the swaths of smooth skin as his husband arches up underneath him, following the heat of his palms. Steve lingers at Tony’s nipples, knowing that’s a favorite sensitive spot, and he’s rewarded with a soft moan.
Steve mouths something against his neck that Tony doesn't catch as he comes, filling him again wet and hot as his hand palms Tony’s cock, stroking him to completion. Steve stays inside him for a long time afterwards, breathing slowly against his neck. Tony curls his legs around Steve’s waist, unwilling to let him go as he draws lazy patterns on Steve's shoulder with his finger, loose looping hearts traced onto skin while his own beats a thrumming
They’re staring at each other in a long stretch of silence while the monitors and machines beep and hiss around them when Bruce walks in.
Steve starts bringing him bagels, breakfast sandwiches, scones, tupperwares of oatmeal and yogurt bowls. Steve starts bringing him his morning coffees too, apparently after consulting with Natasha on how he takes it. At first, he’s shocked at the three extra espresso shots Tony adds to his coffee, but eventually he understands that Tony is so immune to caffeine at this point, he has to drink battery acid to even feel alive in the mornings.
Steve's house sits on the corner of a quiet block, a little two story brick with storybook windows and a cheerful yellow door. It has a small front yard with meticulously trimmed hedges surrounded by a white metal fence.
If their kiss is a greeting, being pressed against Steve as he takes Tony's hand in his large palm to fit the two halves of the gold bangle over his wrist together is a new intimacy. Steve had gifted Tony this bracelet for their first anniversary years ago, a romantic mark Tony would happily wear for all the world to see and never remove if not for his dangerous lab work. Such as it is, it’s a treat to hand over the little screwdriver and put his trust and his love in Steve’s hands, where he knows they’ll be cradled and shielded, cherished and protected. Steve makes quick work of the tiny screws that hold the two halves of the bangle together. The gold gleams on Tony’s wrist, a shout of their commitment, of how Tony belongs to Steve, if anyone happens to miss the diamond and gold on his finger.
Tony notices the slight discomfort in Steve too, probably because the last time they were together in public a few days ago, a new photo of them ended up circulating on Twitter. Tony slides his arm around Steve’s waist and squeezes softly. Steve pauses in his examination of the placard at the foot of the stegosaurus skeleton to give him a small warm smile that sets a flock of butterflies aflutter in Tony’s belly. It’s foolish for Tony to feel this way just because Steve is standing next to him in public on a fake date.
He eagerly returns all the kisses Steve presses to his lips, hands trailing enthusiastically over every inch of skin offered to him. He arches shamelessly up against Steve every time, legs falling open to make a space for him. He fits there perfectly like he fits in Tony's life and mind and heart, Tony doesn't know if he could ever do this with anyone else when it's all over.
“Gorgeous,” Steve murmurs, his own voice sounding breathless. His desire for his husband will never not overwhelm him, regardless of what Tony looks like, and Tony is always beautiful. Steve doesn’t think it’s much of a hardship to spend the rest of their lives reminding Tony of that.
“The two of you were sitting together outside Principal Fury’s office, awaiting your fates, after the fight with that Osborn kid and his little gang. I walked in there to have the parent talk with him and I met your—uncle?”
Tony stares back as he swallows slowly, feeling the jerk of Steve’s cock at the back of his throat as the bitter taste of precome coats his tongue. Soon after, there’s a warning tug in his hair, and before he can stubbornly grip at Steve’s knees to stop him, he’s getting pulled off of Steve’s dick and back into his lap.
Tony heaves a loud sigh. “Fine,” Tony concedes imperiously, tossing the towel to the side as he sits up. His expression softens as he looks back at the small fond smile on Steve’s face.
Tony had often thought of Janet, and how differently her careless rebellion had burned compared to Steve’s bright temerity as they sat for long hours after school in the small classroom, laughing with Steve as he doodled silly drawings for Tony’s amusement.
“You should get some rest, Tony,” Bruce repeats and makes to get up. Tony’s hand on his wrist gives him pause.
“Last year,” Steve says. He's not looking at Tony anymore but staring at the letter in his hand. “You wrote this last year. I can tell, from the things you said, the events you mentioned.”
For a tense moment, it looks like the ball might not make it all the way to the end of the field, the opposing team players leap trying to catch it but it flies through their fingers, until finally,
Tony barely registers Steve’s hands clenching at his back and sliding down over the curve of his ass, and lower still, until his world tilts. With barely a shift to Steve’s stance, Tony is gathered in his arms with Steve’s hands gripping his thighs and getting carried out of the closet to their bedroom. Steve somehow manages to get them to the other room without breaking their kiss, even as Tony tries his damnedest to distract him with tongue and teeth and little nips to his bottom lip. They don’t make the entire journey to the bed, Steve dropping them in the large armchair by their wall of windows.
Tony's brain short circuits and takes an embarrassing amount of time to reboot. “Y-you would like that, wouldn’t you?” he finally manages to gasp. “The rings, and the vows, and the tattoos aren’t enough? You want everyone to see the marks you leave too.”
The grin grows wider and Steve squeezes his shoulders softly. “I know a place,” is all he says as he leads Tony through the halls and up to the front entrance.
“I would love to see your work,” Tony says honestly, pushing the thought of Peggy away for now. He lowers his voice so only Steve hears. The others return to their lunches and bickering, but this feels private somehow, and for whatever reason, he doesn't want Steve's friends to overhear them.
They’ve been through midterms and drunken nights and endless projects. They’ve been together through joy and heartbreak and loss. They had seen each other at their lowest points and at their highest, at their worst and at their best. Whenever Tony had looked, Rhodey had been steadfastly at his side. When he got the news about his parents, and when he refused to cry at their funeral. When he took over Stark Industries too young and too naïve and too unwilling to see Obediah Stane’s betrayal blackening his legacy. When shrapnel ripped his chest apart and he survived the darkness of a cave in Afghanistan to fall to his knees in the desert praying the helicopter in the sky wasn’t a mirage. When he argued with the Senate, when he was dying of palladium poisoning, when the Accords tore the Avengers apart, when they fought aliens and monsters, when his marriage crumbled, when Tony built a new life from scratch all over again. Rhodey held his hand and had his back through all of that.
That's how Pepper and Rhodey find them when they arrive. Pepper’s cheeks are gorgeously pinked from the winter chill and Rhodey has certainly bulked up over the last few months. His shoulders are straining the woolen fabric of his coat, his dark hair cropped shorter than Tony’s ever seen, and his smile is so big, his eyes crinkle at the edges.
Later, Rhodey finds Tony on the football field underneath the bleachers. He takes one look at him and doesn't say anything, simply crawls down to sit next to him on the damp grass. He takes Tony in his arms as he shakes, gulping wet sobs and streaming snot. Tony cries all the tears he hadn’t been able to shed at his mother's funeral. He cries for his mom.
Steve shrugs his dinner jacket on top, Tony watching unblinkingly as the fabric stretches around Steve’s thick arms and chest. Large palms smoothe over the front, brushing along the dark velvet as long fingers carefully straighten the pressed lapel. The gold ring shines on Steve’s hand, catching the light. There are the numbers inked on Steve’s knuckles, 2012, the year Steve came out of the ice and into Tony’s life. A lifetime ago now.
As he's about to leave the kitchen, Jarvis touches his wrist. “Do remember to come up for dinner, Anthony,” he says gently. “You don't eat nearly enough. Mister Rogers and myself as well as your friends worry for you.”
you,” Steve interrupts. His eyes are wide and wild and desperate and painfully, excruciatingly honest. He moves as though to step closer but visibly forces himself to stop. “I fucking
Despite the embarrassed heat in his cheeks, Tony feels elated, his footsteps light and floaty. He hasn't been so happy in—who even knows how long. He likes to think it's mostly because his best friend is home now if only for a brief week, but he also has his new friends to thank, friends he never knew he could have. And they're all because of Steve, who probably makes him happiest out of all.
“Ouch,” Loki says, but there's a smirk of relief lifting the corners of his lips. “Meaningless? So you don't think,” he glances at the letter with a raised brow, “my hair shines like onyx in moonlight and my wit viper swift?”
Rhodey gets along with the team like a house on fire, especially with Steve, even when Rhodey is threatening him with bodily harm should he hurt Tony.
Feeling brave, Tony runs his palms along the length of Steve's torso just to watch him shiver, feeling the bubbling rise of laughter in his throat when Steve mirrors his motions. His heart is pounding away in his chest, loud
“Loki is mad at me,” Tony says dismissively, pocketing his phone. “He's not going to come help me clean when he's still angry about the brother thing.”
Bruce chuckles, a small spark of light jumping back into his dull eyes. He takes the seat Steve vacated and removes his glasses to wipe the lens with his shirt. “You’re recovering well if you’re so dramatic as always. Helen Cho looked over your charts before she left for the night. We had to use the Cradle to regenerate that nasty wound in your side, but aside from some malnutrition and dehydration, you’re doing pretty well after spending so much time in space.”
“Please take care of him,” Rhodey is saying to Pepper. “Make sure he doesn't get into too much trouble.”
“You're missing out,” Steve replies, taking his hand to coax him off the couch. The fort he made is cozy and dark, the light coming from the Christmas tree and candles just enough to allow them to see. Steve has arranged pillows and throws on the rug and Tony finds himself cushioned in blankets when Steve tugs him inside the space created by the strung up quilt.
Pepper and Rhodey had tried earlier in the week before he turned off all notifications to get him to go out for New Year's Eve. He tells Pepper and Rhodey he’s fine, deflects their questions and sure, he’ll take a break and come out for the night. They’ll have a great time, go to one of the parties in the city, or book a hotel room and have their own, drink the last vestiges of the year away. Yeah, of course he'll come out.
He can tell Steve is vibrating with tension next to him and Steve’s hand is clenched around his in a vise grip. He had assumed that as the star quarterback, Steve would be used to this kind of attention, lavish in it and revel in it, but he's wrong because Steve's spine is rigid military straight and his jaw is clenched so tightly, Tony is worried for his molars.
He remembers sitting in one of the corner booths with his mother and Jarvis. This is a place where she had felt comfortable enough to shed her public mask, and settled back into the comfortable skin of Maria Carbonell for a few precious hours before she had to be Maria Stark, public figure, socialite, and wife of Howard Stark of the Stark Industries fortune again.
“I have so much left to do,” Tony sighs, trying to give Steve an out. “I'm not going to be any fun tonight.”
Natasha and Loki pack up most of the electronics Tony doesn't use anymore for donation, despite his protests that they can be cannibalized for parts. They sort through his stacks of books and papers and comes up with boxes of outdated texts for recycling and old textbooks to give to the library. They clear out most of his enormous closet and help sort his clothes and shoes and boxes of miscellaneous crap into piles of Keep, Donate, and Burn.
“It is. But do not forget to also set aside time for Steven. He has never been one to put more stock in what we give him. What he enjoys most is being with you and spending time with you.”
Sarah scoffs. Her son has been head over heels for the young Stark since he brought him home. Their courtship began the day they met. Steven may not be aware of it, and the same goes for Anthony, but Sarah had watched the two of them and she'd known. The look on her son's face when he spoke of Anthony was the same one she'd had for his father.
“Every time I find out more about you Steve, I find myself more in-” He clamps his lips shut and swallows hard before continuing, “impressed, yes, more impressed. You went through so much and you took the place that was the cause of so much and turned it into something better. You turned it into a place that is just like you. Light and open and calm.” The words fade out when Tony spies an easel in the corner behind Steve and looks from it to him and back again. “Steve? Are you an artist?”
Everyone knew about the royal harem. As Prince Steven selected more people, stories spread across the land about how much thought went into every choice and how well they were treated. There were a few who rejected the offer, and Steven took it in stride. From the beginning, he made sure it was clear that there was no obligation to accept. He held no grudges and if there came a time that they needed help, he would be there.
Tony presses into Steve’s touch. “I don’t know., Charming Might be nice having you carry me everywhere.”
Instead, Steve collects the stray bits of honey and lets Tony enjoy his fingers a little longer. The moment Steve’s foot comes between his legs and brushes his cock, though, Tony almost bites down. He manages not to and groans around Steve’s fingers as his foot continues tormenting him through silk.
Feeling braver, Tony told him about his passion for smithing and creating. Steve had smiled so brightly, his eyes seemed to sparkle and he’d very enthusiastically brought him the forge and told him to make it his own. His only request was that Tony be careful and that he take some time to meet the rest of the harem before becoming too engrossed in his work. Eager to earn more of those smiles, Tony had agreed and followed Steve back to the harem quarters. Afterward, Tony was glad Steve had him meet the others. They had taken him in and showed him around, and given Tony what he’d always wanted. A family.
“I already did.” Genuinely confused, Steve wants to know what Bucky is getting at. “I told you that. Remember?”
The words float through the air as Steve is trying to decide which piece to move next. He looks up, knight still in his hand, and tilts his head. “I've enjoyed them too. Coming to my study to find those cookies was a really nice surprise.”
Such a simple endearment shouldn’t make Tony feel as much as he does, but his heart races as he holds tighter onto Steve. His head is on Steve’s chest and he can hear the steady beat of his prince's heart and it’s one of the best sounds he’s ever heard.
“The queen is awfully strict about all of that,” Tony admits. Steve is still holding his hand and he can feel the calluses Steve has from his sword. “I believe you. Promise.”
Steve pulls Tony close again, not quite ready to lose the feel of him. Tony’s heart sings that Steve isn’t letting go and between blinks, he’d swear he catches a glimpse of red and blue strings connecting them both.
“They are.” He kisses the tip of Tony’s finger and starts to lean in to continue what they’ve started. Before they can get far, their stomachs growl and they both snicker. Steve sighs and settles for kissing the corner of Tony’s mouth. “Maybe we should eat.”
“Hush, darling. Don’t wanna wake Peter.” Tony covers Steve’s mouth and arches up into his husband, already desperate for more.
Feeling impatient, Steve holds Tony’s hips and he pulls him down until he’s fully sheathed inside him.
Steven waits for his parents to finish their explanation before saying anything. He can see the hope in their eyes and, while he does not believe he will find the one, it would be nice to have a good group of people around him he can trust. He agrees to give it a try and while his parents will be writing letters to various lords and ladies, Steven decides to travel the kingdom to meet others and choose a few people of his own.
“He never made me feel as though it was wrong for me to enjoy the flowers. Just helped me put them in some water.”
Tony, reluctantly, gets off Steve's lap and stands. He helps Steve stand and they walk over to the blanket. While Steve begins pulling out food, Tony takes a seat and leans back on the cushions, happy to watch. As they eat, they talk and share a few more kisses. Once they finish the main course, Steve reaches into the basket and finds some strawberries. When he picks them up, he gets an idea. He brings one to Tony’s lips and watches as they part to take a bite. A bit of juice slips down his chin and Steve is entranced when Tony’s tongue darts out to catch it.
All the feelings Steve has for Tony are threatening to bubble up and he has to bite his tongue to keep them from spilling out. Ever since the night of Tony’s surprise dinner, Steve has wanted to get on one knee and propose. If he hadn’t needed to wait for the ring to be sized, he probably would have proposed sooner, but the moment he’d seen the ring, he knew the moment needed to be special. Having to wait had also allowed him time to consider just how he wanted to propose. With Bucky's help, they'd come up with a plan and Steve couldn't wait to see it all come to fruition.
Together, they begin planning. A key part of the plan involves Steven insisting that he be allowed to bring his own knights on the trip. Rumlow tries many times to convince him they would not need extra protection, teasing that he would be more than enough, but his objections are ignored. Steven is adamant that his men, Sir Samuel Wilson, and Sir James Bucky Barnes travel with them. When no amount of cajoling will change Steven’s mind, Rumlow is forced to acquiesce. What Rumlow does not know was that Sam and Bucky were also Steven’s closest and most trusted friends.
After that, dinner seems to pass in a whirl. Tony knows he listened to Steve and they talked and ate, but it all seems to come to an end too quickly. Before he’s even aware, Steve is pushing out of his chair and holding out his arm.
Unable to say no to such an offer, Tony tucks himself against Clint’s side and rests his head on his shoulder. “Thanks, Clint.”
Tony rubs at his eyes with the heels of his hands. It's obvious why she’s here. She has some idea what happened earlier. Clint has never been good at keeping secrets, and Tony knows he would have had to told both Bucky and Natasha the moment he saw them.
Having Tony in his lap like this is everything Steve wants. He loves how close they are. How relaxed and content they both feel. He knows, after this, he’s going to take every opportunity he can to just hold Tony like this.
The blush on Steve’s cheeks is the clearest indicator that he’s being modest. Tony starts walking over to the easel and notices the canvases stacked behind it. There are a few blank ones waiting for paint, but most are covered in splashes of color. A tilt of the head is all it takes for Tony to start seeing what Steve has actually painted. The first painting is a landscape of the castle, the canvas behind it is a stunning depiction of the yards, and a third canvas features his forge. Getting closer, he sees a hint of what looks like the queen’s hair and reaches out to touch and stops.
Quickly losing track of time, it’s Clint who notices they’re both getting pruny and nudges Tony with his arm. “Come on, dinner should be soon and we’re all wrinkly. Let’s get out and get dressed.”
Tony continues pacing, not noticing Natasha sitting in the window. His thoughts are quickly becoming consumed with the idea that he’s lost Steve’s friendship forever. “Steve won’t kick me out. He’s promised. He just might not,” Tony pauses, wrapping his arms around his middle. “He might not want to talk to me anymore.”
“I almost asked my father to have it torn down. I wanted to help do it too. Take it apart, stone by stone.” Steve opens the door and leads Tony inside. “But a week after everything with that bastard Rumlow and Pierce, I found myself coming here during the day.” They walk to the stairs and Steve sighs. “I'd go upstairs and sit on the bed where I’d slept for so long and then, one day, my mother found me there.”
Far sooner than Steve expects, he’s standing in front of his door with no memory of actually making the trek there. This wasn’t the first time Steve had walked to his rooms without paying attention, but it was the first time for something like this. His gaze drops to the hand Tony had kissed. There's no evidence of the kiss, but Steve can still feel the gentle press of Tony's lips on his skin. It's all he can think about.
A little flustered, Tony forgets his speech for a moment and has to lean down and kiss Steve. He doesn’t care that everyone is watching, he needs to do this.
Bucky holds a hand up. “Because I convinced her that talking to her Antoshka was more important than coming up here and interrogating you about your intentions.”
Steve laughs from above him. “Use that tongue, sweetheart. You know what I like. I wanna get a finger in you, first.”
“It’s not a bad idea." Tony really is the perfect size to be carried. And he always fit so perfectly against Steve. "Could keep you close always.”
Knowing there’s no avoiding it, Steve looks into his glass and sighs. “I don’t know what came over me, Buck. I was walking him to the baths and next thing I know, I’m kissing the top of his head. It felt so natural. I’ve never felt the urge to do that with anyone else. Hell, I didn’t even realize I’d done it til I was dressing for dinner.” He closes his eyes and leans his head back against the chair. “The purpose of this harem was to give people a place where they could be safe and know they had a home. I never wanted any of them to feel they owed me anything or had to pay me back. I wasn't looking for love or marriage.”
On their return home, the king and queen call in the best doctors to soothe Steven and Sam’s minds that Bucky will be okay. Once Bucky has healed, both he and Sam are awarded titles and land. Steven smiles through the ceremonies as his two closest friends find themselves nobles. They deserve to be lauded like this and Steven is glad to see Bucky on the mend. During the celebrations, the queen notices how her son’s smiles don’t quite reach his eyes. She knows he is happy for his friends, but there is a sadness lingering over him.
“I’m not just saying it.” Steve reaches over the board and pulls Tony’s hands away from his face. “I’ve watched you come up with some of your greatest inventions when you were rambling. It’s,” Steve pauses, stopping himself before he tells Tony how beautiful it is to watch him. “It’s incredible to see. You know how my mother feels about lying, even little fibs, you know I’m not lying to you.”
Steve holds Tony in place and grinds up into him. “You need to come, huh?” He traces the length of Tony’s cock with a finger. “Who said you get to decide what you need? I think I get to do that, don’t you?”
But to see Tony Stark thrown off his element just because Steve very much wants to have sex with him is, so far, Steve’s greatest sexual milestone.
Tony taps on his keyboard and goes: "Well, it's tragic," he finishes. Then he takes out a flash drive from one of the computers and hands it to Rhodey. "There you go," he says, handing it to Rhodey.
Some forty minutes later, they’re leaving the medical room. “There’s a room where you can get cleaned up; there’s a shower and—”
"Mm, Steve?" Tony asks, suddenly and Steve feels like he's done something bad. But Tony grabs his right hand, just lying there hanging onto the mattress for dear life, and puts it on top of his head instead. "I can take it, don't worry."
The flight programs and classes he took during his college years didn’t make him any less excited about the prospects of becoming an Air Force Pilot. Of fulfilling his dream. Of touching the sky.
"He's a blur," Cap replies. "All the new players we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't," he says.
,” he says, his Tony Stark brand smile on his face, but he looks like he wants to die. Rhodey wants to face-palm himself in second-hand embarrassment.
A second later, he was falling asleep to the feeling of Tony breathing evenly on his chest and the smell of Tony’s hair.
Rhodey stumbles back into his stool, putting his hands on his face. “God, I’m—I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that. I’m drunk and I—”
“So you're saying that the Hulk— the other guy, saved my life?” Bruce asks him. “That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?” he adds, a little too defensively.
Steve waves a hand off. "Oh, I know. There's no way you went out with twelve different girls in a single year just 'cause they were models," he says.
Hulk throws him off his body to the side with no delicacy and Thor flips his faceplate open. Steve kneels in front of him like he’s sinking, his hand goes to his chest in a flash and he bends just to check if he’s breathing.
This used to be Tony’s safe place back when he had to do this 24/7. But no matter how amazing or incredible something sounded, Obadiah would always turn it down if it wasn’t something weaponizable.
“…billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I remember,” Steve says, huffing a soft laugh at his mug as he takes another drink.
"So, you're remodeling this whole thing, huh? Does that mean you're getting the gang back together?" Rhodey asks, trying for a casual tone.
“I don’t need your help to get into Harvard, jerk-face,” Jeannette mocks and Tony opens his mouth like he’s offended but then he starts poking her in the gut, trying to tickle her. “Stop it, you idiot,” she says, with a smile as she pushes Tony away. “Congratulations, morons,” she tells them, tenderly.
Pierce lets out a soft breath and takes a stool to sit in front of him. “Your work has been a gift to mankind," he says, in a voice that almost conveys admiration.
It takes him six and a half more days, but he gets it done. He would’ve been happy about it if it wasn’t for the fact that he was kidnapped by a possible terrorist organization, which had somehow got a hold of his tech, right after getting blown up to near death and having pieces of metal trying to reach his heart every second of his life now.
“What did we miss?” Tony wonders once Bruce’s made his way out of the lab after three days working on bringing Ultron to life.
The explosions go off and it’s all too familiar. Tony moves, swirls around and dodges the shots until he doesn’t.
“I am completely misreading this whole exchange, aren’t I?” he asks, rubbing his temple. Rhodey opens and closes his mouth; completely lost on ideas about what to say. “You know what? I’m just –gonna walk out, forget this ever happened—” Álvarez starts to say, embarrassed, putting down his drink and making his way to go but Rhodey stops him on the spot, a clumsy hand clinging to his.
Tony tries to give a shrug in the suit but he fears he fails. “Bad things die hard,” he says and decidedly avoids turning his face towards
"All right, I have a question for you," Natasha says then, after sitting right on her spot. "Which you do not have to answer," she adds, her finger raised. Steve gives her a look, waiting for her to shoot. "I feel like, if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know—"
Tony takes it and turns around. “Oh, I finally met a man called Ho,” he comments and grabs Maya’s hand again.
her,” Tony repeats, his eyes widening comically. Pepper stares at him for a little long and then her mouth falls slightly open. Rhodey’s facepalming himself behind them.
Rhodey lets the water roll down his face to his body, wash all over him and smooth the weird aching in his chest off. He rubs himself with soap, his body, his face. He gives himself a little massage on his head and rubs his eyes one more time, shaking off the sleepiness.
“As a worst-case measure, right?” Tony says. “How about a best case? What if the world was safe? What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?” he offers.
Tony looks at the door she just disappeared to and hums. “You’re right. Maybe I should work on that—”
he was wrong about him. Tony is not a selfish man; he’s just way too good at faking it and Steve was way too dumb to see the mask.
He swallows nervously and Steve adds, “I’d like to be your friend,” with a genuine smile. Tony’s eyes just turn softer before he can do a damn thing about it. “You think that’s something we can try?” Steve asks in a kind tone that warms Tony’s chest.
"All right. Strictly recon," Tony says. "I'll hit the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can," he adds as they make their way out.
Tony sees it. “Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some fairly advanced robotics work,” he shares and Bruce keeps on looking at the gem. “They deep-sixed the data, but— I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door,” Tony adds.
There’s a nauseating feeling deep in his gut all the way up his throat but he's certain it’s the hangover, though he didn't really drink all that much.
Rhodey catches the news on his trip to the base on Laughlin, after he got selected for SUPT for giving “a remarkable academic, military and athletic performance”. He smiled at that one widely, and his father nearly cried with pride after he showed him the letter with his orders.
Steve just looks at him. "I'd never think that you're a bad friend," Steve says and Tony just gives him a helpless smile. "Look, we're here now, I figure that's what matters," he adds.
At that, Tony tries his best not to laugh and frown at the same time. “Well, now my interest is even more piqued,” he simply adds.
“We have group activities tomorrow. You’re gonna make me look bad,” Rhodey mutters, yawning once more.
“No, it—it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things,” Banner says, slightly amused.
Hello! I'm soooo glad this eternal month of January is over. Anyways, hope you enjoy this one, it's very long. Which marks a personal milestone as I've reached over 100K for the first time in my life ever. AND we still got such a long way, yay!
"Holy shit. I cannot believe this," Rhodey cuts in with a laugh. Tony just shakes his head at him and continues to eat his Churros. "Ok, so, how come— or
Maya is in the bathroom, the door halfway open as she washes her face, when Pepper is hit with the realization that she's in the same space as her ‘Maya'.
“Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost,” he tells them, making his way over the edge of the open jet.
“Relax, Rhodes, we just wanna make sure we’re all the same here,” Davis tries. “You sure he’s clear?”
Tony takes the keys of his car out of his jacket pocket and shakes his head with a smile, almost pained it is. "Trust me, it's better for both of us I go," Tony says. "I wanna stay, believe me, but—  I also want us to go right," he goes, his hand rolling down his chest. "And I've done the whole run before walk thing so maybe I need to try walking this time," he says, giving him a little wink before tugging lightly one of the buttons of Steve's shirt, playfully.
