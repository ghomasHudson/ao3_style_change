“Well I found an angel, stronger than anyone I know. He shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share a home.
“Alright.”  Sam shakes his hair away from his face and nods, like he’s made a decision.  Dean tries not to hear the smirk in his voice.  They’ll have a conversation about this later, he knows, and he’s not entirely interested in it.  But, for the moment, he’s glad that Sam is leaving it be.  “We’re heading to bed.  I’m beat.”
But he was frozen.  He couldn't make himself move.  He couldn't make himself stop it. “I love you.”
“Find anything good?”
“Sam--”
But that’s the way of their relationship, isn’t it?  Ten years of this vicious cycle. Self-hatred… unending loyalty… and crushing, soul-deep love.  It’s the signature song and dance of Dean and Cas.
Cas is walking away, and it truly feels like Dean’s heart is being ripped from his chest.  “Where are you going?”  It’s not enough.  It’s not enough, but it’s all he can manage.
Dean leans forward, his elbows resting on his knees. He knows Sammy means well, and it’s more appreciated than he’ll ever know. But, if he’s being honest, those few quiet moments with Cas, whispering their vows to each other before losing themselves between the sheets… it couldn’t have been more perfect if he’d tried.
Dean startles and looks up, finding Sam staring at him, those ever-present worry lines deep in his forehead.  “What?”
“I’m fine, Dean.”
Cas’s eyes search Deans, and he nods slowly.  “Of course, Dean.”
think about it. “We made a vow, Sam,” he confesses. He’s quiet, like a child muttering the rule he’s just broken after he’s been called out.
His stomach lurches, and he can’t see straight.  This can’t be the end.
Dean blinks, and stubborn tears spill over as he meets Cas’s eyes.  Time and time again, Dean’s endured weeks --
“You can’t be too disappointed about that.”  Cas’s hand is on his shoulder.  “Cowboys, Dean.”
Cas is silent for a moment, and he finally tilts his head to press his lips against Dean’s.  It’s soft and warm and everything Dean so desperately needs--
Dean wakes in a panic.  “No, no, no, no!”  His breathing is heavy and labored, the sheets clinging to his sweat-damp skin.  He’s sprawled on his back, and his hand is pressed to his chest as he sits up; his heart racing.  “Cas!”
“All the other beds are full.”
“Why didn’t you ask for help?” his brother asks while picking at the base of his wing where apparently there are at least a dozen burgeoning coverts that are also ingrown.
“Colors on our shirts - it isn’t important,” Castiel growls. “I will punch you, if you keep being so unpleasant, they all here will laugh at you for it too.”
“Does John regularly interrogate you about the contents of your luggage?”
“Your line seems to be on-point tonight, Cas.”
“Awesome.” Dean twitches the right one; he’s gotten a little better at controlling how they move. “How big are they when they’re healthy?”
“Then what did you mean?” Dean demands. He seems angry for some reason. “Huh? C’mon, what’d you mean?”
Until now.
“Uh. Don’t get stuck in a room with only one door. Don’t let him trap you in a corner, either.”
“No, they don’t. However, this is a fluke. It wouldn’t be possible without Dean.”
“No, that’s… thanks, buddy. I’ll bring it up at our next practice, that’s real helpful.”
“Just the way you like it.”
Sam nods. “Yeah, a call from dad would definitely do it.” He takes a breath. “Cas - are you gonna be okay? I know you were in the room when it happened.”
“Hm,” he grunts through a mouthful of egg.
Hands. All he can do is whine, now. There’s no stopping whatever new hurts are sure to come. Cas shivers. It’s the only thing he feels under the agony, that his whole body shakes. He’s going to die. He’s going to die and there’s nothing he can do.
“You should be aware that my presence has already altered things. Nobody will remove your memories of this and the course is already changed. I must see it through. However, your Castiel is likely also aware that we’re having this conversation. I spied on you a number of times, and I managed to convince myself that it wasn’t for malicious reasons. But you humans have an expression for this kind of thing. ‘The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.’ It seems to be a pitfall of mine on a number of occasions, unfortunately.”
“It’s temporary.”
“‘Appreciate’ by eating them and getting healthy,” Dean jokes. “When you feel better again, so will I.”
“Can I be surprised now?” Gabriel asks. “The suspense is killing me over here.”
In Castiel’s opinion, it takes actual
“I was speaking to Anna yesterday, she says you’ve been sick for some time.”
“Gabriel, why are you here?” Castiel asks, also standing.
“Ah, that’s okay, it makes it stand out,” Dean offers.
“What about Heaven?”
I wouldn’t take that chance. Because it wouldn’t help anything, it wouldn’t fix anything, and maybe it’d even hurt people. You gotta understand that loving someone ain’t the same as absolving them of any’a the bad shit they’ve done. And maybe this ain’t what you wanted, but it’s what you got.”
Okay. Wow, hostile. Dean doesn’t say anything else about it because really, it ain’t that important. But also how the fuck has Castiel been playing in the NHL for twelve years if he hates the thumping and bumping of his teammates? It’s just weird. So many god damn things about this guy are weird.
“Because I know you hate it when I do that. Flying in all its forms unsettles you and you like to be in your car.”
“I think I hurt my hand.” Dean’s proud of himself for his voice sounding mostly normal as he offers that massive understatement. “It’s fine.”
“In my case, there is no feather. Impala aside, Dean doesn’t necessarily tend to put much stake in possessions. But he feels bound to protect everyone and provide safety at great expense to himself. So I’m in the process of creating an environment that’s more beneficial to his emotional health. He’s so busy taking care of everyone else, he deserves to be looked after for once in his life. I want him to have stability and safety. Eventually I’d like him to understand that he’s allowed to be loved unconditionally by the people close to him. That’s much more important and permanent than a feather. I’m building him a nest.”
“I don’t, really,” he says, shaking his head. “I have Anna. My father calls once in awhile, but he doesn’t tend to show much interest. I lost contact with Gabriel when I was sent here. And I don’t have a place to live.”
“Okay, uh, so Cas you’ll be getting discharged sometime in the next couple of weeks, so we’re gonna talk about community resources and your support system so that you know what to expect.”
Cas does, groaning slightly in pain while rising from the mattress. Dean shrugs the rest of the way outta his flannel and then puts his hands on Cas’ shoulders, shucking the stupid trenchcoat and the suit jacket off. Then he goes for the tie, and Cas lets him but looks more and more confused about it.
Trigger warnings:
“…yes, and correct me if I’m wrong, but we prefer it that way,” Castiel replies, unsure of the direction this conversation is heading.
“You said I’m not just a serial killer,” Dean tries to joke. It falls so flat he can’t even pretend to laugh at his own words. “And that you wanted something you can’t have, and. Cas, why is it me? Forget the serial killer ham-fisted thug thing for a second, every time anything went wrong I was always mean to you about it even if it wasn’t your fault.”
“How many games have you missed so far?”
“You know what Dean, I don’t understand! Why can’t you even consider the possibility?”
would’ve had more room to maneuver and potentially open up a scoring chance. Instead
“Second four-on-four, go,” John barks at them.
“Yeah, it’s our first home game in January. Don’t worry, I’ll get you the good tickets, I always do,” he promises, then clears his throat. “Hey, uh, can I call you back in like an hour and a half? I’m kinda in the middle of something right now with a teammate.”
“Yes.”
“Dean please don’t look at me like that.” Volatile. Yes, that’s the word he wants. Volatile. That’s how the situation is, or at least how it feels.
“Deano! Is Cassie there with you?”
“WHY? NOBODY CAN HEAR US”
Castiel weakly lands his palm on Dean’s wrist in a final, feeble effort to get through. He has no reason to think it will succeed, not when he can hear the Mark pounding, throbbing in time with Dean’s heartbeat and warping every thought into
“I think it’s only fair that you know,” Cas decides. “I’m technically putting you in danger just by my presence here.”
“The hell’re you goin’ on about over there, boy?” Bobby hollars back as he comes down the stairs.
Castiel shakes his head. He didn’t have a great deal of hope that this ploy would be successful, but even so. “I fell from Heaven because of Dean and ultimately my actions greatly wronged him. You are about to make the same mistakes, even after learning how they end. Know that I will stop you, Castiel. And I’ll do whatever it takes.”
“Headache.” It isn’t a complete lie, the headache
That in no way makes this better.
“Pretty much. And then if you were interested, you’d accept the feather. If you got
“Yes?”
distracting. “Dean, in all honesty, I don’t believe we’ll find anything in these books. We’ll have to wait until it’s closer to the birth and look for signs then.”
He watches the room. Crowley is pestering an increasingly irritated Lee Webb, because there’s nobody on the team that fucker can’t get under the skin of somehow. Victor and Jesse are muttering about something. Max is talking to his mother on the phone. Kevin and Alan are comparing notes about their first six weeks as Islanders, which is always special when you’re an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old draft pick who got scooped up right away by a franchise.
to figure anything out. I don’t even have to spend that much time around them and I’m this close to handcuffing them together in a locked room until they just talk.”
Prior-Castiel accepts the information, processes it. Castiel pulls away and waits for the inevitable rejection. He was too arrogant in 2011, too full of pride and wrath and love for Dean to listen to reason.
“Not bad, Feathers,” Crowley mutters beside him. “Keep this up and you’ll trick me into believing you’re a competent hockey player.”
It’s sudden and horrible and Dean lets out an embarrassing yelp of pain, which gets the attention of the medical trainers. After that it’s all over. They force him to leave the bench and get checked out, which means he gets splinted and they make him change back into his clothes so he can get sent to some unfamiliar hospital for x-rays. Needless to say, Dean already knows he won’t be back on the ice for awhile after tonight.
Benny, whose name Castiel has finally learned with some minor help from Dean, chooses to walk by at this moment and smack their teammate upside the head forcefully enough to create an audible slapping noise. “Knock it off with that, Cole.”
“At least let me blow it off until tomorrow.”
“Lucifer’s wings are silver. But it’s this really horrible silver, it’s like a mirror reflecting the sun right into your eyes. All of him is like that, he’s supposed to be beautiful and at one point he was but after he took the Mark of Cain and was banished to Hell it’s this really unnatural and kinda sickening beauty if that makes any sense. He’s kinda nauseatingly pretty. But Michael’s are more like mine, they’re two different colors. The barbs are crimson and the vanes are a much more tolerable silver, it’s actually pretty stunning.”
He refuses to show how startled he is to be asked that question, especially so directly. “I have a strong emotional attachment to him and to Sam, as well as to Jack. They’re my family.”
Cas thinks briefly. “He already seemed sad, but that’s not unusual for him to begin with. However… shortly before he… there was a phone call from your father that severely upset him. He asked me to give him space. When I came back into the room, he was ill.”
Cas looks like he’s about to say something else, but then it’s
“Yes, it should be fine,” he agrees. “If you want pointers, feel free to ask at any time.”
“Wow, Cas. Are you saying you’re even more girly than Sam?”
“Don’t you know you’re not supposed to out people?”
feel, and how I felt when you made that attempt on your own life. And I’m not the best with empathy but I believe I can safely speculate that Sam and whoever else cares would feel exactly how I did when you forced me to witness the consequences of you critically poisoning yourself. There are no words available to express the amount of fear or anguish that you put me through. Dean-” Cas chokes briefly but finds his voice again. “Dean. Don’t do that again.”
“Well that’s great, Cas, but I don’t like being
The girl smiles at them both. “My boyfriend hates shopping too,” she says, probably directed at Dean because he’s the one she’s looking at. “He’s so cute, if I could just get him to dress
Cas nods slowly. “Alright, if you’re sure.”
“I have no reason to destroy you, Castiel. Despite being a problem, you’re still useful. And besides, you’re as entertaining as you are insufferable. Your inability to adhere to the script is a great annoyance to God. It’s why I raised you at Stull.”
“Cas.” Dean’s voice is a rasp and a whimper at the same time, somehow. “I uh. I haven’t prayed since y-since. Y’know. I guess I didn’t think you can hear me. I gotta say some stuff, if that’s okay.” He wipes his nose on the back of his wrist. “Fuck, Cas, I’m sorry for bein’ such a dick to you all those times, first of all. And when I had the Mark, how I beat the fuck outta you when you were just tryna help me… god, Cas, how can you love me when I’m so awful?” Dean chokes on a sob for a few seconds and gasps before he can talk again. “I just. I never would’a… I never would’a been so shitty to you if I knew we weren’t just friends, and that really says somethin’ about how bad I am to my friends, huh? I know you said all that stuff when Billie was comin’ after us and all… and I’m sorry… but you’re so fuckin’ wrong, Cas, I’m
“Essentially. The souls of living creatures can be formally claimed, either by Heaven or Hell or occasionally an individual such as a god. When that happens there’s a mark left behind. Usually the mark isn’t tangible without accessing the soul, but… sometimes it manifests physically instead,” Cas says slowly.
If you guys wanna take peeks at my current major writing project for Destiel, I actually created an

Gabriel rolls his eyes and gestures pointedly at the balanced tower of clothing on the foot of the bed. “You hate to wash all that, so I did it for you.” He says it extra-slow so that the seemingly exhausted human can keep up this time. Then he materializes a kale salad. “Here, drop all that crap and eat.”
“And… may I ask why you brought me here? It seems very private.”
Raphael watches him in silence for a moment. “Improve by the end of next week or we’re finding a different hospital. You need to be fixed, not eternally baby-sat.”
(See the end of the chapter for
First, he opens his eyes and is surprised that he’s in his bedroom in the bunker and not getting chased through Hell by some greater demon. Second, he’s
Castiel is leaning against the wall, holding his phone and opening FaceTime. After a few seconds Dean can just barely see the face of a little kid appear.
“However, our lives are still at risk because of her.”
Dean has a hunch he knows where this is going if they look this damn pleased with themselves.
“I worry over you.”
“Dean, if I get these shirts, will you stop harassing me about my clothes?”
“Oh, don’t worry about that, I’ve been intercepting the calls for that purpose this afternoon,” Cas explains. “I’ve managed to stop John each time so far. Did you know he gets progressively angrier and more prone to using profanities each time you tell him no?”
They’re on the edge of a brand-new season, all the last minute trades have been finalized across the league, they sewed the C onto Dean’s chest and there’s no going back now. He can never be anything but Winchester, team captain of the New York Islanders, and god dammit his number better get retired in the end too or he’s getting disowned once and for all just like Sammy…
“They have me scheduled for an eight-hour shift tomorrow,” Meg complains.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t end with the ties, because Dean also insists on him finding at least two other shirts as well for absolutely no discernible reason as far as Castiel can tell. They’re quietly bickering about the shirts in question when a clerk approaches them.
Dean doesn’t let go of Cas’ hand even while more drastically repositioning. Cas wonders if they should maybe be standing or at least sitting upright for this given his motion restrictions, it might be easier. He doesn’t suggest any such thing, though, because he has a sense that if he opens his mouth now the moment will break. And Dean’s free hand is now on his unhurt shoulder, and Dean’s head is beside his on the pillow.
“My dad will break my neck if he finds out I’m gay,” is what Dean chooses to reply with.
“Do you really think I’d abandon you, Cassie?”
Dean sits up slightly straighter, opening his eyes and letting his hands fall to his sides as he looks around. Some sense of his has evidently picked up on Castiel’s presence and he now believes himself to be in peril, even though that couldn’t be further from the truth.
Cas looks incredibly guilty, now, which he hates. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Uh. Okay. So… now what?” Sam asks.
“Hello, Dean.”
“They’re bad?”
Oh, right. Jack is a toddler. Even after fighting a war in apocalypse-world, he’s only like a year old. Gabe’s teaching him to fight other archangels but he also likes to watch cartoons and snuggle a teddy bear. It’s such a bizarre combo of behaviors and sometimes Dean feels like he gets whiplash while watching them compete with each other.
“Son, do you know how many times a day you two would stop dead to stare at each other?”
“That’s not what I meant.”
“Dude Cas knows sign language and he overheard me talking to Sammy and now he knows I’m gay so I had to talk to him about it and stop him from talking to anybody else about it,” Dean says instead of hello.
“Your brother’s a dick.”
“Dean, enough. Just go get geared up.”
“Dude, my whole back is fucking sticky. How long until it stops?” he grouses while stalking out of the kitchen and back to his room.
“Because - c’mon, Cas!”
“It really doesn’t,” he grumbles.
Part of Dean is totally on board with this plan - Cas just came back from the dead for like the eighth time, dude can have whatever he wants. On the other hand there’s no way in hell he can actually do that because he knows he doesn’t deserve to get loved by people, especially not Cas, and he doesn’t get how anyone anywhere is dumb enough to give a shit about him (except Sam, usually). And it makes no sense. Cas is a smart guy, a
Naomi scrutinizes Dean. She’s no closer to puzzling it out, but she needs to. If she can find the explanation then when she catches Castiel she may be able to undo their ridiculous bond and take back control of the situation.
“You guys know I can hear you, right?” he snaps, slamming his laptop shut and glaring. He
Or maybe not - Castiel almost doesn’t notice himself falling until he’s already hitting the floor of the hallway. He gasps like a human would in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, struggling to roll onto his side and accidentally sandwiching his right wing between his vessel’s shoulder and the white tile. His grace balls up in his chest, futilely trying to heal around the foreign object lodged there, and he starts to drool blood. The others both stop and watch, hesitant to intervene. He may explode for real this time and they don’t want to touch him. He doesn’t blame them for that.
“Angel magic!” Gabriel’s voice yells out behind him.
“Y’know you’re s’posed to be bad too, Sam. Maybe I should stop you right now,” Dean says.
“Cas, you okay, pal?”
He worries that he might be doing the wrong thing. Once Castiel is back inside his own vessel, Dean will be helpless to stop the night terrors. He’ll return to sweating and twisting and crying out in his sleep, opening his eyes every morning believing he’s in immediate danger.
“Awesome,” the man - Dean Winchester - grumbles. He turns to Cas and glares. “The fuck you staring at? This ain’t the zoo, you sunuva bitch.”
“’Cause I can.”

not beyond saving, okay? I think you should-you should get to leave this place and breathe free air again. So you should try harder at the therapy shit, okay?”
He spins around too quickly and worsens his headache by accident when he hears Dean’s voice.
“You really just let yourself suffer through this alone until now, that seems really unfair.”
Jack apparently fucked off back to Heaven or whatever, because Dean doesn’t see him at all. For whatever’s left of the day Sam and Eileen take turns hanging out in the infirmary, keeping an eye on Dean and especially on Cas, who got fixed with an IV by… somebody. And Dean really hates this. Cas is basically comatose but Dean can’t even sit up long enough to look at him properly.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “This is unnecessary, Dean.”

“I’m not gonna rip your feathers out, Cas,” Dean says eventually, still stroking his fingers through them. He forces himself to stop and gently takes hold of the wing, walking over and manually folding it up against Cas’ back. “But you gotta do better in the future.”
“Yeah, actually.”
“Not immediately, but yes. Be well, Layla.” And he leaps into time again.
“Aw, c’mon, Sammy, you’re always tryna hook me up with your gay friends, maybe you can help him out,” Dean grins.
“He discovered it on his own.”
“My father died when he was possessed by Azazel.”
Trigger warnings:
Whiskey doesn’t work right away, though. And Dean still ends up crying. At least he manages to be quiet about it.
Dean snorts. “I wasn’t gonna say sorry for that. I just… I’m sorry I couldn’t get you out. It should’a been me. I should’a came and got you outta that place.”
The sound alone is almost as bad as the feeling.
“Cas, buddy, there’s no way in hell you would’a had enough feathers yet.”
“They outnumber me, and I’m weighed by the Tablet. My chances aren’t good in that scenario.”
“Is this really necessary?” Cas scowls, limply sweeping his hand at the flames as if Dean could possibly misunderstand what he’s referring to.
“How did you get out of the dungeon?” Gabriel demands half-jokingly while poking his head into the room.
“And your other family?”
Trigger warnings:
from tonight. Angels don’t feel guilt or shame or anything, really, except maybe a type of ridiculously arrogant pride. Why is Cas like this right now? Will it stop eventually?

To make up for the interruption, their head coach punishes all of them for Crowley’s behavior by grilling them extra-hard as power play and penalty kill teams, not even stopping between drills long enough for them to rehydrate. It gets to a point where they’re all overexerted and tripping over each other; naturally, they’re berated for this too, as if it’s somehow their fault that they’re sweating themselves to death under their pads.
“He should’ve been a first round pick instead,” Charlie comments.
” Dean insists.
An eight-hour shift for a nurse is not an eight-hour shift. Nurses are perpetually, critically understaffed, and that means that an eight-hour shift turns into a sixteen-hour shift because the nurse in question is asked to help cover for eight more hours due to the lack of available personnel. It’s much less horrible for Meg to simply work a twelve-hour shift, because after a twelve-hour shift the supervisors are more hesitant to ask her to cover further hours. Unfortunately, even though she has some amount of seniority, she also doesn’t get along with her supervisor so there tends to be a mix of eight- and twelve-hour shifts in her schedule.
Finally, he picks it up, pinching the shaft between his thumb and index finger. Dean sets down his knife and uses the fingertips of his other hand to brush down the barbs - this feather is the softest thing he’s ever touched. He thinks this might be what a cloud feels like. Shrugging, Dean sticks it into his pocket. He’ll ask his geek brother about it later once he figures out a way to explain its presence that doesn’t make him look like a total dumbass for praying to a god he doesn’t even believe in.
The handgun that shot Lucifer is under Dean’s pillow, considerately pointed away from Cas. He doesn’t understand how his friend can sleep with a hard lump of metal there, but he also doesn’t ask questions anymore. By this point he likes to believe he has a reasonably thorough understanding of Dean’s behaviors. And to be perfectly honest, Cas doesn’t mind so long as the gun remains pointed in a different direction. He trusts Dean.
“Dean, are you sad?”
Cas looks at the ground and Dean files it in with the other list of behaviors that are just
Interestingly, Dean doesn’t move until Cas does. Cas goes back to their room with a weight blanket, which he fully intends to take a nap under. Very surprisingly Dean also comes into the room, holding his lunch tray. He sets down another carton of orange juice on the mattress beside Cas’s pillow.
They haven't had a case in almost two weeks. Dean can't remember the last time the world had been so quiet, so forgiving. He still looked for strange deaths or omens on the web daily, and was strangely relieved every time nothing pressing came up. A part of him wanted a case because hunting is his normal, but part of him enjoyed the peace that came with just lazing around the bunker, pulling pranks on Sam, and giving life tips to freshly-human Castiel.
Cas was also a bitter morning person who quickly got addicted to caffeine. He would wake up, slump into the kitchen, and start brewing a pot before Dean or Sam rose for the day. Usually he'd have half of it drunk already before the brothers wandered into the common area. A few times, Dean caught him before he started drinking and he would pinch the bridge of his nose and tell Dean to shut up until he'd finished at least one mug.
Dean feels like he’s shaking, or maybe vibrating, with need. Everything is tilting, moving, wavering around him. The lights could blow and he wouldn't even notice, he’s too wrapped up, too confused about which way is left or right.
"Shhh." Cas leaned in, closer than he ever had before, until their noses were touching, and his eyes fell shut. "I know."
When Cas smiles broadly, Dean sneaks in another picture. The shutter of the lense gives him away, but Cas doesn’t mention it.
He hasn’t even opened his eyes yet and it’s still way too bright for his head to tolerate. He has no idea where he is, but he’s fairly sure he’s naked and laying on a lumpy mattress with rough sheets and a thick comforter covering him just from neck to waist.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat. He hunts for any sort of lie in Cas’s eyes, any indication that he didn’t want it, that he wanted to take it back. But Cas just looks right back at him, waiting, patient.
So he looked back toward the screen and kept his distance.
What the hell
"Morning," Dean echoed, flipping another crepe in the pan. It was meant to be for him, but he decided that now Cas was up and around, Dean would give it to him.
They’ve been friends ever since. They had late night study sessions during their first year when they were only an elevator ride away from each other’s dorm rooms. Their first college summer was mostly spent at the Biggerson’s just off SCAD’s campus where Cas served tables; Dean would come in to bother him, drink coffee, and take advantage of the free WiFi. They found an apartment they could barely afford just south of the metro area and moved in a week before the new school year started. They still have that same apartment.
Dean turns to find Cas’s mirror hung up with his portfolio. Photos are hung, tacked, and taped up from vacations, day trips, school projects, and family holidays. Dean is up there a few times: laughing on the opposite side of the table from Cas at Biggerson’s, a selfie of the two of them under the unflattering flash of a smartphone in a dark movie theater, the only good shot Cas got of Dean that day on the river walk, Dean asleep on the couch with a book folded up in his arms like a teddy bear.
“But Gabriel will be nearby,” he argues.
“You ever. Cas, you ever try to kill yourself?”
“Here.” Cas presses two fingertips to the back of his neck and it disappears instantly.
“Did we . . . last night?”
Dean didn't have anymore nightmares.
Cas must see the uncertainty in Dean’s expression because he continues with, “Come on, Dean, we’re graduating next semester, we’re practically professionals. Are you really going to be embarrassed about a little lipstick when you could be filming HBO sex scenes a year from now?”
Dean, at a loss of jobs and bored out of his mind, started waking up earlier and beginning the coffee for Cas. He didn't have any actual reason to, but it gave him something to look forward to each day he woke up that wasn't just the absence of work. After a few days of that, he started making breakfast too.
A few more days pass, still no jobs. Dean starts to wonder why he even checks anymore. It's like all the monsters had collectively decided to hibernate.
"Please tell me you know what Star Trek is. I'm begging you, Cas. You can't be this ignorant."
Cas didn’t take it so well. Dean had barely spoken to him since he announced their new marriage status and avoided him as much as possible. Even when they got back to the bunker, Dean spent most of his time either chasing anything that smelled even remotely like a hunt or keeping to himself in his room.
Though outwardly, Dean appears frustrated, he fucking missed this.  But something suddenly occurs to him.  “Wait.”  He shakes his head, those lines between his brows growing deeper.  “You really didn’t think I’d have somethin’ to say?  You didn’t think I--”
After waking up from a nightmare, he'd down some whiskey before returning to bed, ensuring that he'd fall asleep without anymore hiccups. After a few days of that routine, he decided it'd be more beneficial to prevent than attempt to cure. So he just drank every night before bed.
There’s movement on the bed. Fuck, of course, he probably found some broad and wanted to get her alone and checked in to some dingy room for the night when he should have been spending time with his brother and . . . best friend. Who he wanted to talk to about not being best friends anymore.
reason why he should be on a lumpy bed with scratchy sheets and listening to an AC cough and whir out half-warm air.
Dean had plans to go home after his three classes of the day to watch Netflix with his hand in his pants and eat pepper jack Cheez-Its until his stomach hurt, but he supposes it wouldn’t hurt to cancel those plans to help out his roommate for a few hours. Dean doesn’t often interrupt plans with himself, especially on a day where he doesn’t have any homework and he doesn’t have to show up for a shift at the salvage yard, but Cas is someone Dean doesn’t mind giving up a  few luxuries for.
“Like your dog just died.”
“Why do you look like that?” Dean finally asks after the sixth kiss, snapping pictures.
When their lips meet, Dean forgets about every single reason he didn’t let himself have this before. Everything in his head melts away until there’s just
He probably didn’t even bang her. He was definitely too drunk last night, there’s no way he could have gotten it up. Not that it would matter if Cas found out. How could he even explain that?
“Here.”
“I realized it was more than just some crush,” Dean finishes lamely.
After Cas downed his first two bottles, he was gone. At first he was all giggles and smiles and Dean taught Cas the fine art of tossing popcorn in the air to catch it in your mouth. Cas was absolutely
And that’s what led Dean to living with the guy for going on three years, to spending entire days dedicated to showing Cas his favorite movies and shows, to picking up dark chocolate Raisinets on his way home from school, to walking into their apartment and calling out Cas’s name just like Ricky Ricardo.
Oh shit.
Dean’s face falls. He pulls his hand away from Cas’s gently and stares at Cas’s shoulder instead of meeting his eyes. “Right. Okay, we can . . . do that.”
eight times in two days?” Cas asks. “That’s because Hannah kept telling me she didn’t want a relationship and ended up leaving me for someone who she got engaged to after five months.”
“It’s fine, Dean.” Cas reaches over with his left hand to remove Dean’s hold on him and stops. Stares at their hands for a long moment. Tilts his head.
Cas looks back at Dean, eyes wide, and holds up his left hand. A thin silver band is attached to his ring finger.
“I remember when that dickhead Balth slept with that web designer. You didn’t leave the house for a week.”
“Fuck,” Dean whispers. He scrubs a hand down his face.
It’s… a tube of lipstick.
Cas catches his eye, but Dean directs his gaze away quickly, suddenly finding the curves of the camera very interesting.
There was pressure on his shoulders and instinctively wanted to pull away from it, but the weight felt too warm and reassuring. He still fought, pushing at the hands on his skin and grabbing his assailant by the scruff of his collar.
"Cas." His voice came out broken and he realized that he was crying. A sob shook him, and Dean ground his teeth through it until it passed. He swayed, unsteady. He was still drunk.
“About what, kissing me? They’re not even real kisses, you just have to pucker up like you're kissing your mom.”
“So, what’s the project?” Dean asks, handing over the box of Raisinets. He curses at himself for forgetting to get a snack of his own while he was out.
“I have one more shot to get.”
“And this time?” Dean asks.
The body next to his rustles around a little more and groans low. Really low. Like, lower than most guys he knows. Something tickles against Dean’s neck.
Fuck, fuck,
He puts on the lipstick, ignoring the photos of himself. It’s definitely not as easy as he thought it would be--staying inside the lines was something he’s improved upon since childhood, but crayons are a lot different from makeup. He manages to swipe the color onto his face, grimacing at the taste of it.
Cas's arms around his torso tightened. "Stay the night?"
at it. And then he got really invested in the movie, not daring to take his eyes off the screen for even a second.
Cas shouts back from the opposite side of the apartment where their bedrooms are. Dean finds Cas in his room, furniture pushed away from one wall and replaced with Cas’s favorite reading chair from the living room (that old, forest-green armchair that Cas found at an antique store on the Savannah River that Dean verbally hated, but secretly used when Cas wasn’t around because it’s about the most comfortable thing in the world), and a camera set up on a tripod facing the chair. Cas is wearing that white button down that looks especially good against the tan he got over the summer, the one that matches Dean’s after they spent several long days on Tybee Island right before their senior year started.
He’s gotta find Cas. Who knows who the hell he hooked up with and whether or not Cas knows about it. He doesn’t want to give him the wrong idea right before confessing to years of repressed pining. He didn’t want to hook up with anyone last night, less it be Cas himself. He remembers the beginning of the night starting out at the casino downstairs from their hotel suite and teaching Cas how to play Texas hold ‘em and laughing at Cas for not understanding what a poker face was and telling Dean that cheating and lying were wrong. Dean moved Cas on to the slots and spent more time staring at his profile from the machine next to him than actually pulling the lever.
Dean was never destined to be a model, but Cas looks just as good in photos as he does in real life. He knows exactly how to position himself, which light to use, how his face should look. He could model, if he ever wanted. Dean asked him if he would star in a short film Dean had to film, but Cas just laughed and said if he wanted to act he would have gone into performing arts.
Maybe he could get used to it. Maybe he could learn to enjoy it without being afraid that Cas might pull away. Maybe he could let himself have this one nice thing.
"Cas..." Dean started, not knowing where he's possibly go with it.
Dean squints his eyes open to the morning light streaming in past the thin curtains and scratches at his neck. It's way too bright and he’s hotter than hell, no doubt sweating out everything he drank last night thanks to the broken AC and the July heat and the heavy as hell blanket over him.
“They were all that bad?”
Sam looked more impressed than shocked. He raised his coffee cup to Dean in a silent toast and gave him an approving smile. "About damn time," he said.
Eventually he relaxed, when Cas started cracking smiles at the jokes and asking questions about the characters. At some point Dean left to make popcorn and grab another six pack and then they really settled in.
Dean catches Cas in the hallway sometime after midnight about two weeks after returning home. Cas is freshly showered, still in a robe and slippers, hair damp.
"Shhh," Cas soothed, running a hand over Dean's back. "It's okay. I'm here."
The worst part wasn’t losing Lisa, it was coming to terms with everything he had been trying to deny since he was seventeen. His attraction to men was something he first noticed when a new kid came to his high school and he fell for the linebacker build and honey-sweet Cajun accent. But after dating women exclusively his whole life, the last thing he wanted was for Cas to feel like some sort of experiment.
Cas pulls himself up and sits at the edge of the bed, his wings folding up and around his body like he’s trying to hide. His wings are massive, no doubt they could take up the entire room if he spread them out. Still, he looks so small and fragile.
Cas didn't go into his room. Instead, he turned to look at Dean, but didn't say anything. He opened his mouth like he wanted to, but shut it just as quickly.
“We should do projects together more often,” Dean concludes humorlessly.
Dean’s grunts turned into actual answers after a few days. He still couldn't hold a whole conversion, but he started meeting Cas’s eyes. Sometimes he would look down at the ring Cas hadn’t taken off yet.
With the lipstick, Dean can’t taste Cas’s skin, but he can smell the face wash where his nose is sticking into Cas’s temple. Like pomegranates.
Dean wondered if hibernating was actually a thing for monsters.
He shouldn’t, but he pulls his hand away from his eyes to peak one open. Lo and behold, Cas is also wearing a birthday suit. Mostly everything is hidden, save for the curve of his ass. He’s a belly sleeper, of course he is.
“You were always there for me, Dean.”
The next day, Dean woke up before Cas and slipped out of bed without waking him. He changed, brushed his teeth, and started breakfast. He whistled while he cooked.
The uneasiness seeped into his dreams. His nightmares came back and soon he was tossing and turning in his bed, waking up with a thin film of sweat across his skin, wishing there was something he could to to take the edge off. His solution, as it always was, was alcohol.
Dean rubs his eyes long and hard, like maybe that will bring back the memories. “That’s what alcohol does, it makes you forget.”
Everything in Dean wanted to lean over, capture Cas's face in his hands, and kiss him breathless. He wanted to make him breakfast every morning. He wanted to drive with Cas in the front seat while he held his hand. Wanted to wrap them up in the blankets and not emerge for days.
movie references? Yes, but that’s beside the point.
Their mouths come together again and the world straightens out on its axis. They slow down, brushing their lips together the way pages of a book slide against one another. They take their time. They learn the way they move with each other.
Cas takes the box with a smile. “Thanks, Dean. This one is based on touch and what emotions it brings out in us, but we can’t have more than one subject in the shot. So, I need you to put this on.” Cas reaches out and drops a small black object into Dean’s palm.
Cas laughs at the memory and Dean captures it with the camera. He looks so much better like this, happy and covered in kisses from someone who actually cares about him. He deserves to be this happy for the rest of his life.
Dean did nothing but nod and kissed him again. At some point that night, they actually opened the door and stepped inside, opting to just drop their jeans instead of changing into pajamas. They kissed some more, until they agreed that they were too tired and fell asleep in each other's arms.
That would make sense, except Sam wanted to splurge on a four star hotel because
Dean’s hand finds Cas’s, and he runs his thumb over the ring. “More like a happy accident.”
so he could travel the world and take pictures of all his favorite creatures. Or it might have to do with his sense of humor--a little dark and always just flirtatious enough to make Dean wonder just how serious he is and whether or not he should laugh or take him up on his offers.
Cas unfurrows his brow and looks up from the floor. “Like what?”
Cas isn’t sure how to respond, so he nods instead. The only thing he’s been confused about is the way Dean distanced himself afterward. His feelings for Dean haven’t changed.
“I, um… I wasn’t very good to her. I was kind of using her to get past a crush I had on someone, but it didn’t go away and she said she couldn’t keep living like that. Like she was competing to be my girlfriend. I don’t blame her one bit, she was right to leave me. I just thought, if it was just a crush, it wouldn’t be a problem once I was with someone else, but when I couldn’t stop liking them…”
The two of them exchanged good mornings and rose to face the day. After brushing their teeth and changing into real pants, they met in the kitchen for coffee and pancakes.
Cas sat himself on the bed and pulled Dean into a tight embrace, tucking Dean's face into his neck. Dean let the emotions come forward then. He hugged Cas back, desperate to feel a body near him that wasn't trying to destroy him.
“Sure, it didn’t happen the way that we wanted and we can’t remember anything, but I’ve been in love with you for years. I was planning on telling you while we were in Vegas so that maybe we could be more than just friends.”
Like today. He was there, coffee brewing, stirring a pan full of eggs while bacon sizzled in the oven, when Cas shuffled in, still wearing his t-shirt and flannel pajama bottoms. His hair was mussed, a little longer than usual, and starting to curl at the nape of his neck. Dean had the sudden urge to twist a lock around his fingers. He gripped the spatula tighter instead.
"Morning," Cas muttered as he walked in.
With his back turned to him, Dean didn't see Sam squint at him. "Did you get laid last night?"
“I think we got married.”
He didn’t want to ask Dean if he wants an annulment but he didn’t want to stay legally married to someone who won’t talk to him. He had waited for the day that he and Dean might become something more, and now that they are way more than Cas ever dreamed of, Dean wants nothing to do with him.
He could make out Cas's features, just barely. He let go of his shirt and felt his cheek, a little scratchy and 100% not a demon.
With a new coat of lipstick, he faces Cas again. He’s standing in the middle of the room, right next to the camera, ready for his last kiss. Dean musters up all his fake confidence and closes the distance between them, standing just a little closer than he had before.
Cas pauses, and then the blanket is pulled up. “Dean, we don’t have any clothes on.”
Dean fits the corner of Cas’s jaw into the center of his palm, runs his thumb across Cas’s cheek. A lipstick kiss smears under the pad of his finger, wiping into nothing but a blur, just like the memory of whichever lover that one was meant to be.
Dean's cheeks burned red. While he hadn't been exactly sure how to tell Sam about him and Cas, he was relieved that he didn't have to, what with Cas having no reservations about their developing relationship. He nervously turned and looked at his little brother over his shoulder.
, Dean would wear lipstick every day if it meant Cas would look at him like that. “Okay, there’s a mirror behind you. It doesn’t have to be perfect, just put some on and lay it on me.”
Every part of him wants to tell Cas. But what would be the point? The two of them will graduate and Cas will become the next most famous
“They certainly weren’t good. After being cheated on, left for someone else, and dumped over text, I don’t exactly have fond memories of most of these people.”
“I was really hoping that when we finally got together, we could actually remember it and it wouldn’t feel like such a mistake.”
Thunder. This time it was gentler, and everything went dark. Dean knew this trick—being blinded so he wouldn't see the next torture that would come to him. He flailed in response.
sunburnt.”
“I think we should skip the projects and just make out,” Cas counters.
That was Cas's voice. Cas was there. Cas, his friend, was pulling him out of Hell again. He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and then opened them, slightly more adjusted to the dark.
Not that Cas didn’t try. They might never know what happened that night in Vegas, but Cas would be damned if they didn’t at least talk about it. Most of his attempts were met with grunts or shakes of the head.
When he pulls away, he knows he’s blushing, but he has no way of hiding it, so he just smiles and says, “That’s a good color for you.”
It wasn't.
Dean steps just a little closer. Cas is about his height, maybe an inch shorter, but it’s not even noticeable when Dean tilts Cas’s face up with a finger and thumb gently pinching his chin. He leans in and--smells Cas’s shampoo, notices the pores on his nose, finds trimmed whiskers along his cheeks--presses his lips right where Cas wanted them.
He turns back to the mirror. He finds the photo of him and Cas in the movie theater again. He can’t remember what movie they saw, but their faces are nearly touching and Dean’s arm is around Cas and he wishes more than anything that he’d taken the chance to kiss him back then. Because, what’s the quote? ‘Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Does it count when Dean is, technically, in love, but just hasn’t voiced it yet?
Cas tilts his head. He was under the impression that ‘happy accidents’ are what people call their unplanned pregnancies.
Or, rather, still being best friends, but more in the
And to top it all off, that black blanket that was tickling his neck is less blanket and more
He lets loose, practically wheezing at the state of Cas’s face. Dean’s must look similar, because Cas erupts into laughter too and they both sink into each other, bodies convulsing in their arms.
Dean’s brain short-circuits. “K-kisses?”
. When Dean and Cas located most of their clothes (Cas was still missing a sock and Dean had lost his watch somewhere along the way) and Cas regained enough composure to put his wings away, they awkwardly made their way back to the hotel room and told Sam the news. Sam had laughed about it for nearly five minutes straight. Dean had gone red in the face and locked himself in his room for the rest of the day.
He had this whole plan. Show Cas a good time on their first night in the city, get drunk and win a little money, and then go to breakfast the next morning for Bloody Mary’s and maybe a long conversation about their relationship. He did
"Morning, Cas," Dean greeted. "Today we have a variety of bacon, coffee, eggs, and I'm about to start making waffles. Did you want any orange juice or frui—"
Tonight was particularly hard. He was there, in the pit, with Alistair carving into him like he was a Thanksgiving turkey. He screamed and cried, but the demon wouldn't let up. And it was just like Hell; when Alistair finished slicing him into thin strips of meat, the thunder would clap and he'd be brand new again and Alistair started again on a fresh new canvass. He skinned him next. Thunder. And then he spooned out his guts with an ice cream scoop. Thunder. And then he covered every single centimeter with thin, razor cuts, until he bled out.
Cas, a little pink himself, scoffs. “Just take the picture, Taylor Swift.”
Dean chuckles low under his breath. “Yeah, I remember. I had to force you into the shower and then we went out for burgers.”
"Dean."
“And when Gadreel drunk texted me all the things he hated about me--”
He pulls away to look at the surprise in Dean’s expression. “I want a divorce. And then I want to marry you all over again.”
“Yeah. I’m using lipstick kisses to represent my past relationships and how I feel about them touching me. Just cheek and forehead kisses. We’re not going to be Frenching or anything.”
Since Dean can’t take a compliment to save his life, he shrugs it off. “I was just trying to be a good friend. You did the same for me when Lisa and I broke up.”
Cas accepted the challenge and took the spot next to Dean on his bed. Dean almost took the offer back, because sitting next to Cas who was all body heat and faded jeans and smelling like his shampoo was too much to tolerate. But he couldn't be rude when he had invited him in moments before. So he sat there, stiff as a board, willing the organ behind his ribs to stop trying to beat its way out of his chest.
Cas doesn’t hold back. He grips Dean’s waist like a life raft in the middle of the ocean, opens his mouth and moans when Dean slips his tongue in. He takes everything Dean gives him. He moves his head aside when Dean trails his mouth along his jaw and down his neck, kissing and sucking and nipping at the skin. Dean pulls him closer, desperate to feel as much of Cas as he possibly can.
Dean scoffed, but his brother wasn't that far off. Sex made him happy, that's for damn sure, but cuddling and kissing and sharing mutual feelings with the person he had emotions for? Way better than sex. "Shut up, gigantor. You want crepes or not?"
Dean flicked off the TV with the remote. He jostled Cas lightly, wanting to wake him, but not wanting to disturb him at the same time. He moaned softly into Dean's shirt.
, and packed up to drive them all the way there. And now, he is filled with nothing but pain and regret.
Which is where Cas found him one night, lounging in his room, beer in hand, Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country on his TV screen. He simply tilted his head in confusion, asked Dean what he was watching, and then squinted his eyes at the answer.
That sort of makes sense. Cas almost looks embarrassed about it.
“Where do you want it?”
Dean chuckled lowly and, without pulling his arm from Cas's grasp, turned off the TV and wiggled into position next to him. They each told each other goodnight and drifted off just like that.
Dean didn’t even know Cas took that last one.
“Here.”
When he looks back at Cas, all he gets is a blank stare and a slight nod. Feeling less than confident with deep red lips, Dean steps up to the plate.
Cas blinks a few times. “I don’t think so. It’s to my knowledge that humans have difficulty maintaining an erection and achieving orgasm while intoxicated. But it looks as if we may have . . . tried.”
One of Cas's hands came to rest on the small of Dean's back and he leaned way too far into Dean's personal space than necessary to inspect his work. Dean shut right the hell up, feeling his heart leap into his throat and simultaneously skip a beat. He looked over his shoulder at his friend with wide eyes.
He’s not sure how to articulate all of that to Dean, so he takes it one step at a time. First order of business: “I want a divorce.”
Cas cracks a small smile. “These kisses represent each of my exes and how I felt about my relationships with them.”
Dean does as he’s told and goes back to Cas to kiss him again. This time it’s just above Cas’s right eyebrow. They go on like this a handful more times, until Cas has lipstick stains across his entire face. Each time feels like the first, and Dean has a harder and harder time removing his lips from Cas’s skin as they progress through the photos. Cas doesn’t seem to be as phased--he sits right down and assumes his pose. In each and every picture, Cas mostly just looks sad.
In the beginning, he didn’t want to ruin their relationship. They worked well together, whether it was study sessions or getting back at exes or picking out mismatching furniture at second-hand stores. He worried about losing his friend. Now he doesn’t want to say anything because he knows he’s going to lose Cas one way or another, and it will hurt less if they don’t get involved with each other any more than they already are.
Dean presses the shutter button three times, hoping at least one of them is a good shot, before diving around the camera to pull Cas into his embrace again.
“That should be enough,” Cas notes, and Dean realizes that he had taken way too many photos while thinking about Cas’s face. He backs away from the camera. “I’ll need a fresh layer for each kiss, so apply some more lipstick.”
“I’m sorry I haven’t been talking to you,” Dean says. “This whole thing has just been really . . . confusing. I just needed time to think.”
Dean took the opportunity (as any other sane human being would) to gaze upon him. Him, with his dark hair and blue yes and five o'clock shadow. Him, holding a piece of popcorn in limbo half way to his mouth as he watched the movie, too absorbed in the events to remember to eat his snack. Him, sipping from his beer, Adam's apple bobbing ever so slightly when he swallowed.
Cas’s eyes widened at the idea. With the way Dean had been acting since their accidental marriage, he figured that Dean regretted the whole ordeal. He figured Dean wanted to undo it and forget it ever happened. There’s a phrase Dean had said to him right when they passed the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign:
his brain supplies him with.
Cas looks hesitant. Maybe he’s finally realizing that he should have chosen someone else to kiss him over and over again. Someone who he wouldn’t have to awkwardly live with afterwards. Someone who wouldn’t have made a straightforward project into something uncomfortable.
. Dean did not want to tell Cas while he was drunk for many reasons, but this one being numero uno. He doesn’t know what he said or how Cas responded or what was decided.
well.
is what he wants. This first kiss, their first date, their first time in bed. He’s sure they did those things in Vegas, or some drunken version of them, but he wants them for real. He knows they did those things, but he wants to experience them for the first time and remember for the rest of his life.
. Sharp yet soft dark feathers that move and breathe with Cas, hot and heavy and huge. He reaches up to run his fingers through the fluff in front of his face.

Dean chews on his lip. Would it be so bad to take advantage of the situation and indulge in something he’s wanted since their second semester together? Shouldn’t he be a good friend and roommate and help Cas with his project, no matter the requirements?
photographer and Dean will be looking for work as a camera holder on low budget movies and shows that may or may not be cancelled halfway through filming. He could always turn to porn as a last resort, but he'll never make it as far as Cas and he’ll never make it
Cas smiles wide and,
More than likely, though, it has to do with how attractive he is, how his smile is so bright it puts the sun to shame, how his laugh makes Dean’s heart swell up like a helium balloon, how he’s intelligent and eloquent, but also absolutely clueless about a lot of stuff Dean considers to be required life knowledge. Does most of that knowledge revolve around
“Uh, Cas? I thought we’ve established that I’m not really much of a model.”
he want? He wants everything. He wants the boyfriend experience and the date nights and the tangle of limbs and the cooking breakfast together. He wants to ask Dean to marry him with a grand gesture that they’ll both tell strangers about for years to come. He wants to marry Dean in a suit with their friends and family and take pictures to hang on the walls of the bunker. He wants to do everything
“Cas?”
Cas sobers up and looks at Dean. His expression is soft, something closer to adoration than anything else. Dean wonders if he’s just amused  by the makeup.
next to him in bed. Angel of the fucking Lord,
It made his nightmares worse, coincidentally, but it kept him asleep. He could deal with the horrifying memories of Hell or watching Sam die, as long as he stayed under all night. It was a small price to pay, he concluded.
As the movie started coming to a close, Cas settled into the third stage of being drunk: sleepiness. Dean didn't notice it at first, being too wrapped up in the plot to realize, but when he felt Cas's weight shift next to him and something coil around his arm, he turned to look at the tired not-angel. He had wrapped hims arms around one of Dean's and was cuddling his face into Dean's shoulder.
“Mission accomplished, I guess,” Dean awkwardly chuckles. He rubs at the back of his neck. “If it were up to me, I’d say let’s just stay married. But that’s just what I want. What do you want, Cas?”
“I shouldn’t’ve taken it out on you.”  He’s surprised with himself, admitting he’s wrong.  Maybe the world really is ending.   “I just… You-- he killed-- he… Mom’s gone.  Again.  And there ain’t no reset button, y’know?”  His voice dips, and he clears his throat to try to hide the shakiness. “All my life, I wanted her back.  ‘N’ I had her.  ‘N’ then I didn’t, ‘n’ I--”
Dean clenches his jaw, but chooses to ignore the dig.  Maybe he’s learning.  This is what Cas wants of him, right?  Taking the high road.  It’s a good comeback, and he makes a mental note to revisit it.  If Cas doesn’t kill him first.  “Cas, please.”  Cas watches him, waiting expectantly.  Dean hesitates, a little too long for Cas’s liking and he’s making to move Dean out of the way of the door.  “I’m sorry!”  It comes out louder and more forceful than Dean intends, but it’s there.  Heavy and soaked in fear, it settles between them, and neither speak.  Their gaze is unwavering.
When Dean needs to breathe, he tilts his mouth away, his forehead pressed against Cas’s.  His eyes remain closed, and an actual fucking smile turns up his lips.  “I shoulda told you a long fuckin’ time ago, Cas.  I shoulda done
“I mean it, Sammy, somethin’s wrong. Off.”
Dean gasps as he startles awake, looking around for a moment, confused.  The bottle of whiskey in his hand had slipped from his fingers and clattered to the floor, rolling against the leg of the drink cart.  He scrubs a hand over his face, and it comes away wet with tears.  His heart is pounding, and he shifts in the chair; the leather creaking underneath him.  “Fuck,” he mutters, leaning forward.
“I’d like nothing more.”  Cas smiles, and Dean feels warmth flooding his chest.  In Cas’s smile, Dean feels content.  He feels like he’s
“About what?”
“Fuck, Cas,” he gasps.  It’s amazing.  It’s been too long; Cas has been gone for far too long, and he’s not going to last long.  He wants more, but he knows there will be time for that later.  Later, he’ll take his time.  He’ll worship Cas, give him everything he needs; everything he wants.  He’ll open him up gently and they’ll make love, slowly, languidly, with soft kisses and quiet gasps.   For now, they reacquaint themselves with each other, with desperate pawing and filthy moans.
