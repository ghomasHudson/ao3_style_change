Castiel just stared at Dean with his head tilted slightly, a quirk Dean noticed he did when he didn't understand something. "Do I really have to spell it out for ya, Cas?"
“Gonna yell at us? Make it seem like you’re tough? Scare the residents?” Dean smirked, clapping Chuck in the back before following him out to the common area by the elevators.
Gabe didn't have the chance to respond before Dean flung the door open, and started rummaging through his pile of dirty clothes on the floor. Cas's attention was instantly draw to Dean, Dean's bare, wet chest, to be exact. Cas bit his lip as he watched Dean triumphantly find his work shirt and throw it over his damp body, the shirt sticking to his back, exposing part of his lower back. The towel around his waist was hoisted up to his knees as Dean attempted to pull his boxers on under the towel before dropping it and straightening out his shirt.
“I saw Cas,” Dean said with a slight crack in his voice, and hoped Gabe was too sleepy to notice it.
“The building’s blueprints have been available all year, I’m apparently the only person who took a close look.”
The rest of Dean’s shift was a complete blur, he couldn’t stop thinking about Cas. What the hell was he going to say to him,
Dean stared at him "It's not what I want you to say. It's what I want to," he said with his voice lowered. He stood up and climbed onto the couch, taking Cas' hand. "Because I want you to know I feel the same."
Gabriel turned his camera around so he was peering into it, “Or something,” he laughed into his camera.
“Wake me up when he gets here,” Dean laid back on his bed with his head on Jo’s lap and she immediately shimmied out from under him.
"Has anyone ever told you you're drop dead gorgeous?" The man leaned in, his lips less than an inch from Castiel's ear. He felt his hot breath on his ear, shivers went down his spine and his breath caught in his throat.
"He was a tool pretty much the whole trip," Dean snorted. Castiel just nodded, agreeing with Dean's statement. "He's such a jerk to Cas, I mean, he's his little brother." Dean shook his head, "Teasing and picking on 'em is one thing," Dean reached over to ruffle Sam's hair, "But the shi- stuff he says to Cas, I don't get it."
“You wanna go too?” Dean asked Castiel, all their friends were leaving and Dean was pretty sure Castiel would prefer to hang out somewhere else a bit more quiet.
“Busy,” Castiel said pointedly, not wanting to divulge into his personal life too much. He didn’t really want Crowley to know too much about him, he thought Crowley knew too much already.
“And you-” John looked up at Dean, who was rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “And your brother lied to me.”
Castiel laughed again, sitting up to lean against the headboard, "Are you going to offer me a drink?"
“Hey, I just made that, so I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mess it up… Yet,” Dean winked at her and she rolled her eyes.
Benny was sent to campus pizza Friday evening to pick up pizza when he was greeted by Dean running the register.
“Yes, it’s the least I can do. Oh, shit you’re bleeding,” Castiel said after he caught sight of the trail of red on the man’s hand. “Come with me,” he grabbed him around the wrist and dragged him through the crowded bar to the men’s room. He shoved past another man standing at the sink to yank a few paper towels out of the dispenser and turned on the sink faucet. He apologized again as he gently dabbed the towel against his skin.
Anna pulled Castiel into a big hug, they only had a few weeks together over break until she drove him to hide out at the Winchesters, she missed him terribly after their first semester apart. “Castiel, how have you been?”
Castiel stood next to Dean and said, “We don’t need to talk about our feelings,” he bumped his shoulder into Dean with a knowing smirk, causing Dean to glance over at him with a curious look in his eyes. “But I just want us to be on the same page, are you sleeping with anyone else?”
Castiel sighed and led him down the hall to his room. “I think my roommate is sleeping,” he said quietly outside his room and pulled out his key. Gabriel nodded and pushed himself into the room after his brother and carefully closed the door. Castiel rummaged through a drawer in his desk while his brother flopped onto the bed, making it creak loudly, earning a glare as Castiel produced a bag of chips. The younger man shrugged, and Castiel realized he hadn’t woken up his roommate.
"I don't pity you, I'm genuinely sorry that happened to you," Castiel said, his blue eyes meeting Dean's, making Dean feel even more vulnerable. “You didn’t deserve it.”
They don't talk about the kiss. Dean Winchester does not talk about his feelings or anyone else's for that matter. Dean and Cas sat across from each other in their booth at dinner, their eyes playfully flitted from the second they sat down. Dean settled on Cas’s lips and licked his own, craving the soft skin more than he was his burger.
“What’s there to talk about?” Dean asked despite knowing exactly what there was to talk about before putting the joint to his lips.
“Us, all of us,” Dean moved his hand in a circular motion to show everyone at the table, “Ash, probably if he gets accepted, Chuck.”
“Can I get a ride home for break?” Jo asked, exasperated, annoyed that she had to ask him multiple times before he actually paid attention.
“Cas, it’s just that-” Dean leaned back in his seat, really wishing he could order a drink. “I’ve been with guys before, just not,” he trailed off but Castiel knew what he was going to say.
“I’ve been very good, Anna. How are things, how are you?” Castiel asked, holding her away at arms length.
“Wanna grab lunch?” Dean asked, turning right onto the sidewalk and heading towards the north campus.
"Shi-shoot it's almost dinner time, gotta go!" Andy exclaimed, now that Mary was home that meant his mother was also likely home and wondering where he was.
After Dean consumed three more beers he was feeling unstoppable, invincible. Dean Winchester could do whatever the fuck he wanted. And he knew exactly what he wanted.
The only reason Dean went to college was because of how close to home his school was. If there wasn’t a university in Lawrence, he probably wouldn’t have gone at all; Bobby would have let him keep working at the shop. Dean gladly would have done that if it wasn't for his father's insistence he follow his footsteps so he could one day take over the firm. He gulped, feeling guilty that he hadn’t seen his brother since August, despite living only a short distance away. “I’ll come home more, I promise,” Dean vowed before pausing, “Mom and dad fighting again?”
Gabriel snorted and gathered the strewn clothes in his arms, “Nah, I look more Luke. Anna looks like the adopted one.”
John drove them home, Sam and Charlie in the backseat, slumped against each other asleep. Dean stared out the window, hyper aware of the sound of helicopters swarming the mountain. He could feel John’s eyes burning holes into the back of his head, but ignored the sensation as he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep like his sibling. Charlie was dropped off at home to Ellen, who cried as she shouted at her when John pulled the Impala away. Sam spent the rest of his vacation curled up in bed after the loss of his girlfriend, only opening up for Mary, who spent hours on end holding him as he cried himself to sleep. Charlie texted Dean later that day when Bobby got back from dropping Benny off at home with news that they hadn’t found Anna or Ruby. He still hadn’t heard from Cas, but obsessively checked his phone, hoping for an update, thinking every little noise was an incoming text. A week later, Dean’s phone was still unbearably dry, Charlie was grounded from using her phone but occasionally called Dean from the landline when her parents were out, just to check on things. She reported they still hadn’t found Anna or Ruby; her and Dean both knew that meant that they never would either, but neither of them said it. He asked about Cas, because he still hadn’t heard from him, but Charlie just reported that him and Jack weren’t at school and when she offered to bring them their work, the guidance counselor reported that wasn’t necessary and wouldn’t provide any further information.
"Spend some time with you without your brother?" Dean laughed, "Fuck yes, Cas." Castiel laughed, placing a soft kiss on Dean's chin.
“Cas, hey!” Dean exclaimed with a smile before letting his smile fall so he didn’t feel too much like a love-struck teenage girl.
Bobby hit the floor as John appeared out from behind an old mine cart wielding a flamethrower, directing it at the monster. The mine shaft was lit up in shades of yellow and orange as the creature shrieked wildly as the flames hit it’s dark, decomposing skin. “I’m sorry,” Bobby repeated over and over under his breath as he shielded his eyes from the bright light of the fire.
"Guys night!" Gabriel exclaimed excitedly before high-fiving Dean, then holding his arm out to his brother, who initially ignored the gesture, but after a pout and the bat of his eyelashes Castiel halfheartedly slapped his hand.
Dean woke up what felt like only minutes later to Sam slamming his door open to greet his brother. “You’re home!” He exclaimed.
"It was great, we had a good time," Dean nudged Cas with his elbow as they all walked into the Italian restaurant.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably, not wanting to seem rude but also not quite feeling ready to come out to someone he just met, after all, Gabriel was the only person here who knew about his sexuality. Well, unfortunately now Meg too.
Michael's face twisted in confusion but decided not to respond and continued to shovel food into his mouth.
Jo found Charlie standing in the sandwich line during lunch on Saturday and encouraged her to join them. Dean took the opportunity to question her about Castiel's whereabouts. Charlie hadn't seen him since their study session Thursday and noted that he called out of work today.
The two breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the lights of the house in the distance, but they were unable to feel safe yet as they still were exposed in the woods.
Dean sighed and took a long drink. “Well things were always okay, they were never great,” Charlie nodded, this was something she was aware of. “And then we both went off to school and we,” he paused, staring at the can, barely cold enough to begin gathering condensation, “drifted apart.”
Three girls approached the guys and the shortest of the group said, “Hi, we’re playing volleyball but we don’t have enough players, do you want to play?” She pointed to a volleyball net behind her, with a few more people standing by it.
about Castiel. He didn’t care about him like he cared about Gabriel, who drove him nuts by repeatedly pranking Dean but he knew he only did it to make Dean laugh. Nor did he care for him the way he does for Sammy, his best friend, the only person Dean would move heaven and hell for- but he would never care for anyone that much. He worried about where Cas was, if he was safe. Dean was as worried- no he was more worried about Castiel these past few days than he was after Lisa was out of school for almost two weeks when her grandfather was ill. He cared for Cas more than the way he cared about Lisa. Lisa who he chased after for years before she agreed to go out with him, the Lisa who Dean bought a stupid promise ring for because he was in love with her.
“Charlie, stay here, you’re too drunk,” she went to argue but closed her mouth. She nodded and he said to Sam, “You two go check down the path towards the ski lift. Jack, you and I will go into the woods with Dean and Castiel.”
“It’s lovely,” Castiel said, turning his attention back to the path after he tripped over a stray rock.
By the time Michael returned from work Dean and Cas had completed the check-list he left for them in preparation of their party, but Castiel had a suspicion that Michael really just didn't want to do the chores their uncle asked them to do while he was gone.
"Jackpot," Dean said with his tongue sticking out, he lifted a bottle out of the bottom drawer in Bobby's desk.
Castiel looked up and squinted his eyes, and slightly tilted his head before saying, “No, I’m a historian.”
“Jo open up!” Gabriel begged, pounding his fist on the door with less effort, he was starting to lose interest in finding Jo.
On their way to lunch Castiel asked Dean what he thinks of his RA. Dean laughed, “Chuck? We’re lucky to have him. What about you?”
Castiel stood up and opened the bread box, pulling out a loaf of whole wheat and placing it on the counter. “What are you making?”
Cas laughed, “Hopefully.” The two stayed on the line in silence for a few moments before Cas said, “I went to see Anna in Chicago.”
“I am not going to that den of iniquity,” Castiel said, deadpan, without taking his eyes off the television.
“Throw rocks at birds, ay?” Dean said with a smirk, getting off the couch, giving in to his brother’s demands. “I’ll go put on my swim trunks.”
Ash immediately dove in and helped himself to a slice, pushing Dean out of his way with his shoulder in the process. “Where’s the beer at?” He asked, plopping down into a chair next to Sam. “I’d have bought but,” he paused, “you know.”
John carried Benny out to the truck, grabbing a toolbox from the back before he returned to the house to take a look at the ski lift while Bobby and Benny drove down the mountain to the nearest county hospital. John and Dean were unsuccessful at fixing the lift, but by the time they made it back to the cabin, the police and park rangers had arrived, the flashing lights on their vehicles lit the snowy wonderland up blue and red. Charlie, Castiel and Sam spoke to the police while Jack sat back quietly, not talking to anyone. Dean overheard an officer say ‘shock’ and ‘post traumatic-something or other’ as he was speaking to Castiel, who was nodding along and looking over at his cousin.
“Jo?” Bobby said, tearing his eyes away from the vision in the flame to look at the creature. “My baby.” The creature stood silently as Bobby processed what he had just seen. “I love you so much, sweetie. Your mom and I love you dearly. You will always be my little girl. I’m going to set you free now.” The monster continued to stand there quietly, but it seemed to bow its head as Bobby called out, “John, now!”
“No, I have a break until two, I don’t mind,” Dean waved at a dark haired girl who called his name. “Do you have class after drawing?”
"Hello, Dean. Is Michael ready?" He gestured to Gabriel's empty bed before Dean stopped what he was doing and crossed the room. Dean closed the door behind Castiel and gingerly pulled the backpack straps off his shoulders.
He shrugged again, “I dunno, it’s a little soon to move in together. We’ve been going steady for what, three months?” Dean turned to face his friend and put his hands in the air, “I cannot believe I just said
“Is this safe?” Castiel asked wearily when Dean beckoned him onto the bridge. His eyes wandered to the planks, in the darkness he couldn’t tell if they were intact.
"I can't believe you would do this shit, even after what's happened with Luke, and Ruby!” Gabriel said, louder.
The Winchester’s entered the Roadhouse, Dean begrudgingly telling his father about his classes for the Spring- he just started break couldn’t the interrogating hold off a couple days? Ellen was wiping the bar with a rag, and greeted them with a smile. “Look who survived another semester!” She exclaimed to Dean, thankfully interrupting his conversation with John.
“Huh, I just always assumed you lived in Lawrence. I think they have a local history section” Dean said, his eyes squinted in thought before walking over to the map on the wall near the door, “Yeah, it’s upstairs,” Dean pointed to the map.
After paying the taxi driver and thanking him for waiting, Castiel nearly collapsed on the couch from exhaustion despite only being awake for a couple hours. He decided to drag himself off the couch and make coffee, then thanked Michael and Zachariah in his head for leaving a couple cups still in the pot. It had long gone cold, but at least he didn’t need to wait around for another cup to brew before getting his well-deserved caffeine fix. He drank the cup quickly and tapped his fingers, trying to decide on his next move while ignoring the stagnant taste.
“Me too,” Dean groaned when he felt Castiel’s finger pressed against him and began pushing inside him. He moaned into the pillow when Cas pushed it all the way in and began to stroke Dean from inside. “More,” Dean ordered after a minute, Cas immediately added a second finger and began to pump his fingers in and out, watching Dean shift his hips to meet Castiel’s pace and let out a low, “Fuck.”
Thankfully they had walked to the pub, so Dean was able to get back to his dorm no problem, but the whole time kept wondering how Ash and Gabe would get out. He figured they wouldn't waste their only phone call and would call someone who could afford to meet their bail- because there was no way in hell Dean could.
“Yes! So you’d have to crash in our room. I stayed at the frat and slept on the floor so you two would have some alone time.”
The two took their time getting on the road the next day. After sleeping in until 10, they kissed lazily until Dean could no longer stand to feel Cas' morning wood pressed up against him. By the time they were out of bed and finished packing Dean's things it was past 12 and they had under 2 hours left in the dorm until the RA's came by and kicked the stragglers out. Instead of testing Chuck's anger, the two started carrying their belongings out to Dean's car to make sure the room was cleared out in time.
The two climbed onto the bed after Dean shed his shirt and soiled swim shorts. He climbed on top of the younger boy and was pulled in for another kiss by Castiel’s hands in his hair.
“I am not looking forward to seeing him. He’s extremely pissed,” Castiel sighed, running his hand through his hair.
Castiel was suspicious- very suspicious of Gabriel. Gabriel had always been a fan of pranks, he was the family trickster after all. First, Gabriel somehow had his keys Halloween night. Castiel still had no idea how that happened, he certainly didn't drop or misplace them. Now, Gabriel, on a number of occasions, would leave the room as soon as Castiel arrived, leaving him and Dean alone. Regardless if he invited Castiel there or not, he would just take off for a while.
The few minutes Castiel was gone felt like an eternity to Dean. He sat on the seat his friend was just in, his leg bounced nervously and he suddenly didn’t know what to do with his hands, so they fumbled in his lap nervously.
A bright light lit up the house, catching the attention of the group, exhausted and trying to pass the time until dawn hit since none of them were willing to try to sleep. The light source grew until it was nearly at the front door of the cabin, when they realized it was headlights to a car. They wondered how briefly until they heard someone calling out their names, Charlie and Sam rushed to the front door and threw it open.
Castiel let out a loud noise when Dean began to fuck him faster and harder, his hand now wrapped around his leaking erection. “I’m so close Dean.”
Bobby set Charlie down once they were all inside and he pulled her into a hug, squeezing her so tight he lifted her off the ground. His large hands were firmly cradling the back of her head. “Charlie, baby, are you okay?” He asked when he finally pulled away.
“I don’t,” Jo said as she leaned against the wood paneling of the house and ran her hands through her hair. “I can’t stand those girls.”
"Yeah, I'm fine," she waved him off, having coffee and a sandwich helped sober her up a bit, but she bit her lip, "okay I'm not fine, but I know how to get there."
Dean had never had sushi before, so when they were going over the menus Cas suggested he try a California roll but when Dean caught sight of a teriyaki chicken roll he couldn’t resist ordering it. Castiel laughed so hard when Dean ordered it that their server had to come back after a few minutes to take his order.
Mary and John offered to take the boys out to dinner when they came to pick up Sam, in the offer Mary made sure to specify that Cas was, of course, welcome. The three boys all piled into the backseat of the Impala as John drove them to Mary's favorite restaurant downtown. The parking lot was adjacent to the Japanese restaurant Dean took Cas to for Valentine's Day and Dean casually mentioned he would like to go back there sometime.
“Nah, thanks man, but I’ve really gotta study,” Dean said, looking sadly at his notes. He would so much rather be doing literally anything other than studying- but at least he had Cas to keep him company.
Dean, Benny, and Gabe eventually made their way back over to the couch where Jo, Hope and Lily were still sitting, giggling at a couple arguing nearby.
Castiel grabbed Dean by the back of his head and slammed his lips against Dean’s, bitter and stinging with chlorine. Dean eagerly pressed his lips against the shorter mans with an urgency that he hadn’t felt since him and Castiel first started sneaking around, the possibility of getting caught excited Dean more than he cared to admit. Dean’s hands wandered south and found themselves wrapped around the back of Cas’ thighs, easily lifting him in the water. Hands running through Deans wet hair began scraping at his scalp, causing an involuntary moan to escape his lips.
Dean nodded as he began flipping through the channels and eventually stopped on Friends and glanced at Cas, who seemed happy with the selection and sighed contently. He tilted his head slightly to rest against Castiel’s and closed his eyes to enjoy the moment of peace.
“Drunk tank- wasn't so bad,” Ash said as if it was no big deal, like he's been arrested a hundred times before.
“I did not!” Dean defended, abandoning his half-scrambled eggs and crossing his arms in front of his chest.
"Anyway," Charlie said, getting back on topic of their job, "Mostly you just sign in guests and chillax. Oh! The guest book!" She exclaimed, remembering she has to show it to him. Charlie snatched the clipboard off the counter and waved it in the air. "Guests put who they're staying with, room number, sign and date it."
“Here it is,” Dean said, stopping in front of the large scale replica of the town when it was founded.
"Should we get you home soon?" Dean looked over for the alarm clock but realized he already packed it. He tried to peer out the window and caught a glimpse of sun, so it wasn't quite evening yet.
He stared at the paperwork, knowing these questions were routine but still felt as if the woman at the desk already knew the answer. He felt himself shrink into the plastic chair, wondering what he got himself into coming here.
“My dad’s car. I figured out who keyed it,” Dean said, turning around to look down the hallway, making sure no one was watching. “Dick Roman,” he whispered.
“It’s not that bad, it’s been worse,” she forced a small smile. “But we’re here to have fun tonight, we will deal with him tomorrow.”
“How hard is it to make cereal?” Dean asked, earning an eye roll from Sam, who turned his attention to looking out the front window for his father. Dean soon joined Charlie in the kitchen as she was pouring water into the coffee maker.
“What’d you mean?” Dean asked, staring at Michael as he waited for an answer, a bottle opener gripped in his hand.
“I guess,” Dean said, “you really find this interesting?” He said as he approached Castiel from behind.
Castiel did not object and hurried over to the twin bed while Dean turned the lock on his door. Cas sat on the edge of the bed, impatiently waiting for Dean. Dean pulled his T-shirt over his head and discarded it while Castiel watched with hunger in his eyes. He carefully eyed Dean’s shirtless chest, not that he hadn’t seen it before- but not in this context.
When the tournament started they were off to a decent start, Gabriel, Dean, and Jo all managed to flip their cup on the first try. Apparently the trio practiced frequently after they lost in the first round of the tournament last year; one of the frat brothers Castiel didn’t recognized was heckling their team about their shameful previous loss. But when they got to Benny the team started slipping, Benny had apparently had too much whiskey. Luckily for them (or for Castiel) one of the girls on their competitor team was also struggling, and was much more flustered about it than Benny was. Her teammates were shouting as her cup continued to land on it’s side, and she groaned loudly with frustration, her arm accidentally knocking her teammate’s cup off the table when she reached for her own.
He could hear rustling through the phone before Dean asked in a deep, hushed voice, "What are you wearing?"
“Want some?” Gabe whispered, holding out the bag to his brother, who hadn’t realized how badly he had the munchies until now.
Dean realized after the door shut he forgot to grab his key, and he also didn’t know which room was Jo’s. Luckily their other RA had put name tags on each door, Dean chuckled, imagining Chuck taking the time to make these tags, but then figured it was more likely they had two RA’s. On the guys doors the nametags were coffee cups and the ladies doors had dainty tea cups. He came to a door that had one teacup labeled Bela, the other must have been ripped off because there was streaks of tape leftover on the door. That door had to be Jo’s so Dean pounded on it and in a second a tall blonde woman answered the door.
Dean’s back was pressed against his bedroom door, cushioned by sweatshirts and towels hanging on the back of the door. His hands were in Castiel’s shaggy hair, tugging slightly, earning a low groan into their mouths. Taking the opportunity, Dean’s tongue slid into Castiel’s open mouth as Cas’s hands moved away from his shoulders to his waist. Fingers gripped tightly into Dean’s soft cotton shirt, desperately pulling it upwards. Dean sucked Cas’s lip into his mouth and nipped, hands slipping down his back, pulling him closer. Castiel bucked his hips into Dean when he felt the nip, then Dean’s hands wandered further to land on denim. His hands squeezed, and pulled him in closer.
“That’s a decent start,” Charlie shrugged before sitting forward with her elbows on her knees. “But I think you should start at
His roommate either understood or didn’t care to press him because he didn’t say anything as Cas attempted to busy himself with the assignment he had abandoned.
“Nobody wants me here? What about you? If it wasn't for you Jo and Ash would be here right now!" Benny shouted as he emerged from the bathroom, and Dean made a sarcastic face in response.
Sensing hesitation, Dean said, “If you want to talk about it that’s, uh, that’s kinda what I’m here for," he rubbed the back of his neck.
Soon the whir of the blender distracted Dean and Castiel from their concerns, now more ready for poolside drinks. And Dean desperately in need of another nap despite sleeping for the entire three hour flight.
"No, thank you," Cas said politely, which earned him a wave and a "See you on Thursday," from his professor. Castiel hurried out of his seat, he was going to be late to his drawing class.
“An accident? What happened?” John and Mary both jumped up from their unofficial seats on the couch. Mary fussed over Dean, checking his body for injured while John stood with his arms crossed, waiting to hear what happened with the car.
“Please do not use our Lord’s name in vain,” Castiel approached the cassette player and turned it off. "What's your problem, Dean?"
After Jo placed the phone back in its receiver, Dean asked, "So where have you been lately? Found cooler friends?"
Dean realized he wanted to tell him family all about Cas, he wanted them to meet him. He wanted Cas to come over for dinner and meet his parents. He wanted to take Cas for a ride in the Impala; maybe out to the campground and they could sit on the hood and look at the stars as he and Sammy did with dad so many times before. Cas could probably point out all the constellations, he would know their origin stories. He wanted so much with Cas. He didn't want that slimy guy Crowley to touch him anymore, he didn't want Cas to go home with random guys at parties. He wanted Cas to himself.
Benny nodded as if he understood, he heard bits and pieces of the story at Dean’s on New Year’s Eve, but hadn’t really heard the whole thing.
“Kings it is!” Dean shouted, pumping his beer into the air before announcing he was going to find a deck of cards.
“Please extend my thanks to your mother, dear,” she said to Dean before turning on her heels back into her home office.
"What's that?" Castiel asked, turning his attention to his friend, thoughts of Ruby pushed to the back of his mind.
“Uh, yeah. Dean?” Gabe asked with a raised eyebrow, hoping Dean would have more of an idea of what was with Cas.
“Don’t stay up too late, you have school in the morning,” she said to Sam when she was halfway up the stairs, despite knowing him and Dean were going to be up until the wee hours of the morning.
“I missed you too,” Castiel felt like his heart was beating out of his chest he was so excited to see his partner. He pulled his head back slightly so he could see Dean’s face and the now content expression on it. Nearly instantly, the two brought their lips together for a long, slow kiss that soon began increasing in passion.
“Jesus, Sammy, what’s with the third degree?” Dean threw his hands in the air for exaggeration.  “And no, I’m not gay.”
Before Castiel had the chance to answer Dean opened the door, "Hey," he nodded to his roommate and sat in the bed next to Cas, who eagerly poured the soda into his cup.
"I just can't fucking stand assholes like him. Who cares who you wanna date, it's none of his business. Everyone's a little gay, anyway!" Dean said with a scoff.
Michael must have called out of work the day following the party because when Dean and Cas awoke they heard him and his buddies talking in the kitchen. Dean practically drank a glass of water in one sip and once Michael saw the shape his brother was in he passed him a freshly brewed cup of coffee. “Coffee?” Michael asked Dean, who nodded and wiped his mouth with his arm.
Sure, it was a pretty easy decision to share a room. They could push their two twin beds together- it would be a bit more comfortable than cramming two men into one twin. There wouldn’t be anymore waiting for one of their roommates to leave so they could have time alone. No more sharing a room with Castiel’s brother who seemed to always be around. It was an easy choice to share a room.
"No," Dean almost laughed. Anna was the chair of the Christian Student Alliance, known for her clinginess to boyfriend's. Dean didn't want to deal with that, especially when her uncle was the principal. He could imagine Principal Alder damn near chasing Dean off campus if he so much as checked her out. Dean liked to flirt with her, but that was the extent of it.
“Should we take this somewhere else then?” Dean asked in a murmur, his lips kissing down Castiel’s jaw.
In the morning Gabriel woke with his head pounding and his left leg hanging off the bed. He sat up and reached for a water bottle sitting on his dresser against the wall, adjacent to his bed. He chugged almost the entire bottle before pulling away, breathing heavily. Gabe wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and saw Dean and Jo still sound asleep and Dean’s bare back facing Gabe’s side of the room. He immediately laid his head back down and rolled over to attempt to sleep off this hangover.
Castiel turned around and Tony was no longer behind him, luckily he was so tall Castiel was able to spot him across the room near the bathroom. Tony was twirling his key ring on his finger.
“You can stay with me. Do you need me to come get you? I can pick you up,” Dean unsuccessfully tried to hide his excitement.
Soon enough everyone had a mug with a hot beverage warming up their cold hands as they sat in silence around the room. Jack stared into the blazing fire, ignoring the hot cocoa Charlie had made him, no one making an attempt to speak with him about his sister. Dean and Castiel had taken over an oversized chair, barely fitting as they squeezed together. Cas was leaned forward over his knees with his mug in his palms and Dean's free hand was gently rubbing his back. If anyone noticed the closeness between the two it remained unspoken.
“I’ll sleep in Gabe’s bed, you can have mine,” Dean said, unhappy with the situation but wanting to make things as comfortable for Sammy as possible. If Gabe hadn’t offered the extra bed Dean was going to take the floor, but he was going to keep that to himself and accept Gabriel’s kind gesture- he knew it could be a while until there was another one.
While their friends were discussing who was going to share rooms Castiel and Dean faced a bit of a predicament. Sharing a room made sense, they wouldn’t have to bother any other people to get time alone, but what if their relationship changed over the course of the year? Dean and Castiel had only been together a few months, were they really ready to make an eight to nine month commitment to their new relationship? Dean wasn’t so sure he was, which is why he made the mistake of asking Benny to be his roommate.
“A suite is like an apartment, RA’s won’t be doing room checks, there’s a ton more space. The building is brand new- you should see the blueprints it’s huge.”
"Family lies to each other, it's what makes them family," Gabe said half-jokingly through a mouthful of chips. “You leave parties with random people all the time,” he pointed out Dean’s hypocrisy.
“You heard him nerds,” Jess said with a giggle and poked Sam in the arm, Sam laughed and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and led her down the stairs, glancing behind him to smile at his brother.
“Dean,” Castiel started to warn but was interrupted by Ruby shouting out, Dean and Castiel nearly bumping into her.
“No idea,” Cas said as he nibbled on a piece of loose skin on his thumb, turning his head to look out the window. Past the tree line he could only barely make out the lanterns that barely lit up the pathway.
“Oh, sure. That’s fine, whenever you’re free,” Dean said, his voice dropping, feeling like maybe he was being too clingy for Cas.
“Except if I fuck up his car,” Dean mumbled, looking out the window at his house, knowing his fate was only a few steps away.
Castiel sighed and closed his book, “I’m upset because you still think I am a child who needs constant supervision.”
"You two are like an old married couple," Dean pointed out, sipping on the can of soda he got with his pizza.
“Okay, so what?” Dean asked, gripping the scotch, Charlie snatched it out of his hands and placed it on the table.
Gabriel, Jo, and Dean knocked on Castiel's door, unsure if he was there or still at the library. There was no answer so they decided to check the library. Unfortunately Castiel was not there either; not even in his secret hiding spot Charlie showed Jo; and the group was beginning to worry.
“Listen, I don’t care about who you’re with. We don’t care about none of that. Family is family. We just want to see you happy, and that Castiel’s a good kid-”
“Do you have plans for New Year's?” Dean asked, unsure what the holidays were like in the Novak-Alder household. He figured Zach had some kind of fancy dinner party, force all the kids to wear formal attire and mingle with Zach's lawyer friends.
“Jack, here’s your never have I ever,” Dean winked to Sam as everyone raised three fingers. “Alright, never have I ever,” he paused to think for a moment, “Been in a three way.”
“Boys, not in front of company,” John said sternly before adding, “yes you can invite friends over too.”
"Very," he said, nodding before sipping his cup. Castiel watched as he licked his lips when he pulled the cup away, his eyes wandering further south. A tuft of dark hair stuck out of the top of his yellow shirt that clung to his chest in all the right places. "My eyes are up here," he joked, Castiel turned bright red and his eyes darted away, they landed on a pair of feet across the deck. "Relax," he said smoothly, placing a hand on Castiel's knee.
Jo shrugged and took another sip, then wiped her mouth. “Are you having any fun? I know it’s crazy here tonight.”
“Juniors only though?” Castiel asked out of curiosity; Ash would technically still be a freshman since he didn’t even complete one semester.
Castiel gulped and held the joint out for his partner, “I think we need to talk about that,” he said softly, he felt uneasy. Cas knew Dean was very adverse to speaking about how he felt, and their relationship in general. Dean preferred to show how he felt, and upon hearing Cas said they needed to talk, he instantly went on the defense. An easy conversation never started with
“How about we make it more interesting then?” He said, shifting to pull out whatever loose change was in his pocket.
Jo emerged from the bathroom with a, “Move,” and pushed Dean out of the way to rummage through her bag. She pulled out a small cosmetic bag, which earned a raised eyebrow from Dean, she then produced a baggie of safety pins and told Dean to hold still.
“Rip it, like this,” Dean said as he tore off a piece and extended it to Cas, who opened his mouth and accepted the dessert. He chewed thoughtfully and swallowed before grinning.
Classes the first week of the semester were always boring, professor Mills let them out a few minutes early after going over the syllabus and her expectations, instructing the students to read the first chapter before their next meeting. Dean arrived to his history class early and got a head start on his architecture assignment until the class began.
By Saturday night and the flip cup tournament came along Castiel was not prepared to play, no matter how many times he practiced with Jo during the week. He knew he was terrible, but he didn’t care, he only agreed to come because he needed some way to shut his brain off for awhile. He just had to be careful not to drink so much he lost all filters, he couldn’t let it slip to Dean or Gabe that he saw Luke at Crowley’s apartment. Castiel made his way to the keg, bringing back a cup for him and Dean; receiving a protest from his brother who asked why he didn’t bring him one.
“He’s not that bad, I swear. He’s actually become quite the stoner,” Gabe sounded like a proud parent.
Dean made a point not to answer that, not wanting to get into the details of his love life, or lack thereof in the group chat. Instead, Charlie texted everyone the details and they began expressing their excitement over continuing their winter holiday tradition, even without the two that started it all.
“Bite me,” Jo tossed one of Deans pillows at the shorter man who cursed her for making him spill his beer.
“It came from that way,” Dean said, pointing to the woods that were smack in the middle of the two paths.
The two sat snacking in silence until the bag was gone. Dean looked into the empty bag then up at Cas, who was now slowly licking the cheese dust off his fingers, he sucked on his index finger and released it with a pop. Dean stared at the cheese on his fingers, and opened his mouth with the desire to ask Cas to lick it off for him. But he didn’t. Instead he asked, “Cas, are you gay?”
“How’s things with Zach?” He asked, trying to keep things neutral when his father was just in the other room.
“He leave his number?” Dean asked, he had Ellen and Bobby's phone number memorized, but he had no idea even what dorm Ash was living in at MIT.
“Me too,” Dean nodded before adding, “so good talk, Cas,” Dean clapped him on the back with a smile before walking away from the art, looking for something more interesting to look at.
“Jack, I’m eager to go look for Anna too,” Castiel said, “but Dean’s right, we need to wait for their help.”
“Even without you’re an excellent candidate for Stanford, I’m sure you will get in,” Castiel assured him, knowing Sam worked incredibly hard for his dream of attending Stanford and becoming a lawyer.
On their way from their architecture class, Benny stopped dead in his tracks. “Did you really just ask me that?”
"I suppose I should go talk to him," Cas sighed, pushing his green beans around on his plate before he gathered the strength a few moments later to get up and pursue Dean.
The brother standing at the head of the table yelled “Party foul! You’re out!” at the team across from Castiel and his friends.
“Of course, man. My mom loves having company. And my dad will just be happy you're not my grandparents,” he snorted, turning to look behind him.
“That’s awesome, Cas!” She exclaimed, eagerly jumping up to give him a hug. He stood still for a moment before bringing a hand up to pat her on the back.
“They’re sweet,” Cas said with a smile, following behind the two teenagers, Dean  put an arm around Castiel’s shoulders and gently knocked their heads together before pulling away despite wanting to linger. Castiel sighed when Dean pulled away, wishing him and Dean would be able to show their affections in public- he knew Dean was not ready for that, but he hoped someday he would be.
"Cas lied to us." Dean was suddenly overwhelmed with anger. Maybe it was the beer, maybe it was jealousy; Dean knew it was both. He was pissed that Cas lied to them-
"You too man, what are you doing tonight?" Benny said, handing over the cash he collected from the girls.
Castiel just shrugged and turned to face Jen who looked sympathetic. "I could use a smoke," Jen said with a nod towards the door and a half shrug. Jen and Castiel followed the three out the front door and when they got outside Jo turned to face Dean and Case, rolled her eyes. Benny was sitting on the stoop, an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips as he animatedly told them some story, "An' then I said not t'day, an' I socked 'im."
Gabriel glared at Dean moments after they reached altitude, he was now drooling on Gabe’s Hawaiian shirt. Castiel watched the two out of the corner of his eye and his lips pulled up into a small smirk as Gabriel hushed, “He’s your boyfriend! He should be cuddling you!”
Castiel grimaced, feeling responsible for the tension at the house he quickly abandoned. “I’m sorry, it was selfish of me to take off and leave you and Gabriel to deal with the mess.”
"It's a new doctor, I haven't seen her before. Besides, I'm here most of the year," he shrugged, trying to act casual about it.
Dean groaned loudly when Sam finished his homework and asked if they could order a pizza before their friends came over. “Dude I work at a pizza shop! We have pizza at least once a week!” He had a tendency to bring home leftover food that was never picked up, or the individual slices abandoned under the heater. After smelling it all shift, eating it was the last thing Dean wanted to do. But when Sam asked and gave Dean his pleading puppy eyes, Dean was unable to say no, and just mumbled under his breath before picking up the phone.
. He opted for sitting front row in his classes and turning to their textbooks when he couldn’t read the chalkboard.
“This museum is beautiful,” Castiel observed, admiring the hand carved details in the banister, and gazing up at the stained glass window above the main entrance.
“Oh, so you just like to fuck?” Castiel asked as they turned onto the sidewalk that ran from central to south campus, where Castiel's dorm is.
“Maybe someday; after you’ve popped your cherry; you’ll get it,” Michael sipped his coffee and (not so) playfully smacked Castiel on the back.
Castiel shrugged and eagerly bit into his pizza after dipping it in the monster pile of ranch dressing he insisted he needed to go with his pizza.
Castiel and Dean’s eyes were level, Cas’s lips were still slightly parted, Dean moved in on them again, this time with more force. More passion. He needed more. He needed Cas. He kissed with such force Castiel bumped into the desk behind him, his ass planted on the table top. Dean gripped the short hairs on the back of Cas’s neck, causing a groan to escape Cas’s lips. Using Cas’s slightly parted lips as an invitation, Dean’s tongue slipped into the younger boys mouth, excitedly exploring. Cas dug his nails into the back of Dean’s t-shirt as his tongue met Dean’s,
“Wouldn’t miss a toga!” Dean shouted as they approached their friend before following him towards the keg set up in the kitchen.
Castiel ventured over to where Dean was standing and snaked his arms around his waist, resting his head on his shoulder. “That was the last movie my family saw all together before my mom died.”
“Because they enforce rules?”  Jo said, rolling her eyes at Dean, knowing that for the most part dorm reception did nothing more than smile at you when you walked in the door.
Dean replied with a middle finger pointed at the camera seconds before they heard a knock on the door. Gabriel readied his camera at the door, “He’s here.”
Cas felt as if he was floating all day at work the following day, he smiled despite a customer attempting to return a thousand dollar armoire against their policy, and he smiled past his supervisor leaving early and trusting Castiel to lock up at closing time. After he finished eating the leftover dinner Michael saved, Cas tidied up his bedroom, ensuring he had an extra pillow, and that his dirty laundry was hidden away in the hamper. He looked around his room, satisfied that it was clean enough; not that Dean cared. He looked at the clock and frowned that it was only 7:40 and he would still have at least another three hours until Dean arrived. A long shower later he was standing in his bedroom, half hard from the anticipation of finally having alone time with Dean when he pulled open his underwear drawer and smirked, remembering he had a surprise for Dean.
“Stay here,” Dean said, putting a hand into a gesture for ‘stay’ as he focused the flashlight on the path. He heard the door closed and wasn’t surprised that a moment later, Castiel, wielding the fire poker was on his heel.
Minutes later Gabriel joined them, his hair messy and desperate for a drink. Instead of opening a new one, Gabriel grabbed the beer out of Dean's hand and drank the rest of it in one go.
“I, um, I'm not sure,” Castiel said shyly, unsure if this was her way of asking him to leave and pushed the potatoes around with his fork.
After a minute of silence and working up the courage Castiel said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to worry you. I should not have disappeared like that. I- I didn’t think. It was really stupid.”
Jo flipped off the camera before Gabriel got the chance to turn it off, their laughter the last thing the camera captured at the moment.
"Hope," she said as she closed the door behind them. Hope took a sip of her hard lemonade and said, "Drinks in the kitchen, and Benny's on the deck."
“Maybe you should consider a career change, Castiel,” Dean said with a small smile, “You make a great doctor.”
Sam shrugged, “They say colleges like to see at least three years of a language,” he passed a controller to Cas before settling in next to him on the couch.
After a couple pitchers of beers Ash wanted to go out to smoke, Gabriel joining him. Dean promised to meet them outside after he used the bathroom.
Gabriel shrugged, "He's a big boy, he can do what he wants with whoever he wants." He reached over and grabbed a bowl of chips sitting next to him.
Charlie looked puzzled then followed Dean as they descended the ladder. When Dean reached the bottom he picked up the axe, knowing Charlie probably couldn’t carry it the whole way back. “Lead the way,” he said, pointing towards the path as Benny neared the bottom of the ladder, only a few yards from the bottom. At that moment they heard the screeching sound again, coming from the woods across the clearing.
“Chuck’s a little weird, but he’s harmless. Like Cassie,” Gabe said with a mouthful, pointing his thumb at his brother, who just glared.
“Little bro. Promised him I’d show him around, show him where to eat. Bring him to the party tonight,” Gabriel grinned and the elevator dinged. They paused and let off the group of girls before they entered the lift.
“If you don’t think there are aliens, you’re out of your mind,” Gabriel said after inhaling from a joint.
Dean thought before he chugged the rest of his beer and belched before crushing the can in his palm and tossing it to the floor.
Dean snorted, “People who date in college are morons. So much easy action, why settle for one person?”
The second time she woke up in the mine, Jo was slightly more alert, and realized she was in big trouble if she couldn’t get out of there. She mustered up some strength to rip her shirt to try to create a makeshift sling for her arm. Without food or water, she would surely die before she could even make a serious attempt to dig herself out.
Now that Dean’s bed was unoccupied he stretched his legs and folded his arms behind his head. The guys sat in silence for a few more minutes save for the sound of Gabriel accidentally knocking their fan out of the window when he turned it around.
“John, Castiel is going to stay with us for a little bit,” Mary said, raising her eyebrows at him, giving him a signal that Dean assumed meant ‘don’t start in front of company’.
"For once we don't have to worry about being interrupted," Dean said, his words muffled because his mouth was placed firmly on Castiel's neck, where he was placing kisses wherever he could reach. Cas squirmed at the sensation and made a high pitched sound, turning around to capture his boyfriend's lips with his own.
"That's my baby bro!" Gabe exclaimed proudly, getting his brother another drink. He then spotted Hope in the other room and clapped his hand on Dean’s shoulder. "Keep an eye on him, will ya."
"Well how can I set you up with someone if I don't know what you like?" Dean asked, stopping in front of the doors.
I got some inspiration from American Pie the Naked Mile on this one- I just had to make some ridiculous Halloween tradition.
“Can’t come soon enough,” Castiel rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder before turning to face Dean’s neck so he could place small kisses along it. Dean groaned at the sensation and wrapped his arms tighter, pulling their bodies closer together.
Castiel pulled out his fingers before rolling the condom down his length and squeezing the lubricant onto himself, making sure he was coated well. Dean pushed his knees and elbows into the mattress to lift his ass in the air more, ready for Castiel. Castiel settled between his legs, lined himself up and he started pushing inside Dean.
"Would you quit buggin' me about it? I don't know!" Gabe said, thoroughly annoyed that his little brother was too awkward to just ask Dean about it. He wasn't here to do everything for his brother, he needed to finally learn to do things for himself after constantly being babied by their family.
“How’s your girlfriend?” Sam asked, not wanting to discuss his relationship (or lack of) with Jess. Sam was crazy about her, and she knew that- or at least Sam thought she did. Sam was always coming up with excuses to spend time with her in and outside of school. He rushed to pick her for his lab partner in chemistry, thankfully before Becky was able to get to him. When Sam noticed Jess’ disappointed sigh after their AP history project, he offered to help her study and since then they have spent every Tuesday afternoon together in the library, laughing in between chapters.
Dean’s eyes followed downward as Castiel’s shirt was lifted up, noticing the dark trail of hair, his eyes couldn’t help but wander a little bit down before he realized he was staring at his best friend’s little brother’s crotch. When Dean’s eyes lifted he noticed Castiel staring at him, and he immediately looked to Gabe who hadn’t noticed any of this as his cheeks started to burn. Castiel did not seem phased by his gaze and slowly smoothed out his shirt.
“You don’t like to party?” Sam asked, surprised, he had assumed since he spent so much time with Dean and Gabriel that he would be into the same scene as them.
“Will you two shut the fuck up about aliens?” Jo exclaimed, rubbing her temples before standing up and carefully taking the joint out of Castiel’s fingers. After she took the last hit off it she shoved it into an empty beer can and kicked the towel out from under the door. Jo waved before the door shut behind her.
By the time he made it across campus to Gabriel and Dean's room his arms were tired from carrying his belongings and wished he had asked one of them to help. He grunted when he set his laundry basket on the floor outside his brothers room and opened the door. Castiel looked around the room with confusion written all over his face. Gabriel's bed was stripped, the closet empty, and not a single personal belonging in sight, not even his lewd posters. Dean's side of the room, on the other hand, still had sheets and blankets messily draped over the mattress. His desk chair had clothes over the back of it, and his textbooks, they had served their purpose, were in a neat pile on the dresser.
Dean's eyes widened, he glanced to his notebook then back to Cas, who was focused once again on the lecture, but had a small smirk in the corner of his lips.
“You’re not, I’m offering. I can come over tomorrow night- I mean if you want me to,” Dean didn’t bother trying to hide how eager he sounded.
Sam shook his head sadly and sat down next to the redhead. Ruby was further behind him, shutting the door loudly behind her. "Hey did you turn the lift off?"
Dean must have eventually fallen asleep because he was woken up by the door slamming, he jumped at the sound and was happy to see Gabe and Ash's faces enter into the room.
Charlie and Castiel spent the next three hours of his shift discussing classes, books and their interests. The two of them were huge book worms, so they got along swimmingly despite their different genre preferences.
"You don't have a last name?" Dean soon realized who he was speaking to and wondered what he had done to deserve a horribly awkward conversation with his boyfriend’s ultra-conservative uncle.
“And I’m just having a good time, getting drunk, layin’ by the pool with my friends,” Dean said casually.
He was snapped out of his thoughts when Dean said, “Careful, Cas.” Castiel looked away from Dean and saw that they were now standing on a natural path, about to step onto a wooden bridge.
“Will someone please explain what the hell is going on here?” Charlie demanded before the two took off as soon as they arrived.
Andy’s mouth dropped open, and Benny just clapped Dean on the shoulder and said, “I’m happy for you, brother.”
"Come here often?" The mystery man said to Castiel casually. His voice was light, and he had an accent Castiel couldn't quiet place.
When Dean re-entered his house he closed the door and sighed before shaking his head. He felt his mom gently squeeze his shoulder when she came back inside for her purse and to say goodbye, the touch lingering for a moment while John put on his coat.
“My brother’s here,” Castiel leaned his face in so close his lips practically touched Dean’s ear, he needed Dean to hear him while he shifted his body in the other direction.
Castiel continued to stare at Dean's ass as he bent over to pick up his jeans from the floor and shove them on, then moving to tie his boots. Cas felt his chest tighten and tingle watching Dean get dressed, then was snapped out of his trance when Dean slammed the door behind him.
When Castiel noticed his brother step outside he nodded in his direction and exhaled the smoke, then extended his arm to offer the joint to him. Behind Gabriel was the dark haired guy who was checking him out earlier. The mystery man lingered in the doorway for a moment, his brown eyes locked with Castiel's. Once again, he felt his cheeks turn pink and licked his lips, partly from his mouth being very dry suddenly, and because he now noticed how handsome this man was. He stepped onto the deck, and excused himself to get past Gabriel.
“Hi sweetie, be safe- but have fun,” Mary called, knowing that Dean would keep Sam safe, before waving with a small smile and driving off to leave her youngest son for his first taste of college.
“Serendipity- it’s a small antique’s shop in town. Zachariah knows the owner,” he trailed off, unable to help but feel a sense of shame that he had to rely on his uncle to get him a summer job.
"Yes, thank you for inviting us, Benny," Cas said with a slight slur, his second drink was nearly empty.
Dean could never resist the sad eyes, so he rolled his eyes and sighed, “I guess it’ll do until another one opens up.”
Gabriel turned around to face his roommate and gave Dean a look with one eyebrow raised, knowing that Dean wasn’t always the most friendly guy.
“Right. Thanks again, Bobby. Dean, I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said, turning to look back at the truck briefly before entering his house.
Dean shook his head and laughed, "Two people called out, I've been stuck on register since I walked in, haven't even gotten the chance to piss."
“No,” Michael scoffed, “you wouldn’t get it, Cassie. Sometimes the next morning, you gotta lie to get her to leave,” he said with a condescending tone, pouring himself a cup of coffee.
His eyes scanned over to a second police car driving out of the parking lot, the dim lights in the lot made it so Dean just barely recognized his roommate sticking his tongue out at him through the window. Dean stood still, his hands locked behind his head, looking bewildered as the police car containing his roommate pulled away.
"Ditching us to study math?" Dean asked, putting a hand on his chest, as if he was offended. "Who are you?"
“Lay off of Cas, Mike. If you just took the time to hang out with him for once you’d see that he’s pretty cool,” Dean took a sip of his beer.
Castiel stopped in his tracks, his eyes slightly squinted and brow furrowed. He recognized that voice.He hadn’t heard it in well over a year, but he still recognized it. He entered the living space and stopped, not wanting to get any closer to his brother who was lounged on Crowley’s couch, his arm lazily draped around the back of the count and his legs crossed at the knee as if he had been hanging out all day.
“You’re okay, and that’s what matters. I’m sorry I ratted on you to Gabe. I didn’t think he would flip like that.”
“Well you’re about t-” Castiel laughed, twirling around once before slamming into a couple people that he was unaware were behind him. He barely even registered Balthazar shout a warning when he felt his shirt soaked and heard the shattering of a glass. His hands went to cover his open mouth, an apology already escaped his lips before even looking at the person he smashed into.
“Missed breakfast, dammit I wanted French toast,” Gabe cursed as Jo entered the room and shut the door behind her.
Castiel shifted and blinked his eyes before sitting up straight, “Ah, I missed the movie,” he said and Dean chuckled. Cas wiped his eyes and blinked a couple more times before he noticed the clock. He yawned and scooted off the bed, “I should head back,” he said with a yawn.
“That trust fund of yours is gonna go dry one of these days,” Dean said, hopping off his bed and tearing open a trash bag that contained his bedding.
Gabriel apparently wasn’t planning on having dinner with his friends that night, which didn’t entirely surprise Dean. Thanksgiving break officially started tomorrow, there were no classes so everyone on campus was buzzing with excitement, talking about the holiday and happy that midterms were mostly over. Gabe was likely out drinking with Chuck.
Sam’s head whipped up to see the Impala, his face pinched, then the blonde girl waved goodbye to him before she turned towards a bike rack. Sam stalked over to the car and got into the passenger seat with a scowl on his face, "We were kind of talking," he said with typical teenager attitude.
“Good for him, I’d hate to see him miss out on his education because of a drunken mistake,” Castiel nodded as he sat on his bed.
“House rules!” The brother exclaimed, folding his hands in front of his chest. “Who’s next?” He shouted, turning to the bracket to see who the next two teams were.
“We're still doing the midnight streak-” He wasn't able to finish his sentence because he was cut off by excited roaring. After a few seconds it quieted down again and he was able to continue speaking. “but this year we're also doing a costume contest with a very special prize. So if you showed up to a Halloween party without a costume you’re shit outta luck- 'cause the prize for the best dressed guy and girl is free admission to all parties for the rest of the year!”
Dean averted his eyes, looking at the floor, ashamed. This was something he wanted to keep secret until the day he died, he promised himself we would never tell another soul. But he had to tell Cas- he had to warn him. "Cas, please. I won't let him hurt you."
Tuesday morning Dean rushed into history, not wanting to be late again, threw his bag down on the floor, squeezed into the small desk and huffed loudly. Cas turned and raised an eyebrow at him. “You're on time today,” he politely observed.
Castiel politely answered all of their questions, including answering a few for Dean when his cheeks were stuffed with bread like a chipmunk.
Castiel rapped his knuckles on Dean and Gabriel’s door at exactly 7 PM like they agreed on and waited a moment for the door to open.
“The bus?” Dean asked, purposely fidgeting with his backpack so he wouldn’t have to look at Cas, his cheeks burning.
“No, Cas, you don’t have to leave because of me,” Sam said as he moved Dean’s pillow back to the head of the bed.
Gabe waved his hand in front of Dean's face, “Hello?” He drew out the 'o’ and started snapping his fingers.
“Want more, Cas,” Dean said, his lips making their way up, meeting Castiel’s. He didn’t need to say any more, Castiel expertly unbuttoned the older boys jeans and pulled the zipper down, making a point to apply pressure to the hardness underneath it. Dean groaned at the pressure, desperately wanting more. He did the same to Castiel, Dean’s fingers working at the zipper, attempting to work his jeans down, but since Castiel was sitting on the desk he gave up quickly. He was far more interested in the way Cas had worked his cock out of his own jeans and how his soft hand was already wrapped around him. Castiel worked himself out of his pants instead of tugging them down,
"I could really use a study buddy, want to get together again?" Garth asked after Castiel glanced at his watch and announced he had to meet a friend for lunch in 20 minutes, not realizing it was almost twelve.
Zachariah stared at his book and a small laugh nearly escaped his lips, his face pulled into a smirk as he settled back in.
On top of his stress about classes, Castiel still couldn’t shake the sensation that Dean was ashamed to be seen publicly as a couple. The two had agreed they would be fine telling their friends about them, but in the first few weeks back to school Castiel still felt like they were hiding from everyone. The topic wasn’t brought up at all around their friends except for Gabriel (who seemed to be ever present when they wanted time alone). Benny even introduced Dean to one of his friends, and while she was outwardly flirting with Dean, Dean didn’t bring up that he was accounted for. Dean of course didn’t flirt with her or lead her to believe they would be having breakfast together in the morning, he just politely excused himself and disappeared to the bathroom. Benny had looked at Cas with a dumbfounded expression, but Castiel just averted his eyes and downed his beer. He had hoped at some point Dean would have told Benny he was seeing someone, but when Dean simply said he “wasn’t interested” Cas felt a pang of shame deep in his gut- Dean didn’t even want to tell one of his closest friends.
so Castiel was stuck at home with Michael while Zachariah was at work and Castiel was beginning to wonder if God was punishing him for something.
Castiel rolled his eyes but promised his brother he wouldn’t see Crowley anymore. He knew Dean also didn’t want him seeing Crowley, but he has been friends with him since he first became friends with Ruby. Crowley was really his last connection to Ruby- he and Balthazar drifted apart and eventually broke up a few months after the death of Bal's step sister. Castiel really did not want all connection to her slip away, he needed something to hold onto that had some of her. Every time he looked into Crowley’s eyes he could see so much of Ruby in him. They had nearly identical laughs, the same sarcastic tone, and you could feel their power radiating. Whenever he saw Crowley it almost felt like he was with her again.
Dean gave a thumbs up in response, Cas also doing the same. Gabriel disappeared back into the crowd again and when Dean thought they were out of his line of sight, he might have inched closer to Castiel once again.
Dean looked up from his textbook, "Downtown? What for?" His face scrunched up slightly at the sudden favor.
After a while Castiel downed the rest of his second drink and leaned in close to Dean, asking him if he wanted another drink, which of course Dean agreed. Castiel promised he would be right back and he was, with a small blonde in tow.
“I’m friends with his brother,” Jen said, nodding towards the direction of the house and dropping her discarded cigarette to the ground. "and he totally had it coming."
"Hawaiian is the perfect combination of sweet and salty," Gabriel argued for probably the hundredth time, advocating for his favorite topping.
For the next three hours, Castiel laid in bed, curled up with a book trying to fight the urge to touch himself before Dean arrived. Every few minutes he glanced at the clock, cursing it for moving so slowly while he was unable to really be absorbed in his book. After what felt like an eternity, Castiel heard the doorbell ring, causing him to jump out of bed and lose his place in the book. He figured that was a problem for later, and adjusted his pants so in case Michael was downstairs he wouldn’t notice his bulging erection. Cas could hear Dean and Michael making small talk by the time he reached the foyer.
“Dean, wait!” Castiel called before running after Dean, his feet burning on the sand, motivating him to run faster through the crowd to catch up with Dean. When he finally caught up Dean was standing triumphantly on cooler land waiting for Castiel. “That wasn’t fair, Dean.” He said with a frown.
drew Castiel to Dean more than usual, wanting to spend more time with him to try to figure it out. Castiel wanted to know more about Dean, he wanted to know everything about him. But the more time Castiel spent with Dean, the more Gabriel seemed to pry, which led to Castiel backing off a bit mostly because he knew how meddling his brother can be. And the last thing he wanted was Gabriel to get involved in his love life, or lack there of.
Once Castiel described the situation with Zachariah Charlie’s jaw dropped, shocked that his own brother would invade his privacy in front of the family.
Michael laughed at her comment, one hand planted firmly on the blonde from the bar’s ass. Gabriel turned around to face Dean and Cas with a grin, "Aren't they?"
“Sorry guys,” Jo said when Dean, Gabe, and Ash protested. “Have fun!” She said as she stood up, her and Cas had finished eating and were ready to meet Charlie.
Michael, Gabriel and the girls walked over to the volleyball net to begin their game. “D’ya want to go for a walk?” Dean asked, leaning up so he was resting on his elbows and put his baseball cap on top his head.
“Hey, what the-” Gabriel said from the other side of the door after turning the handle and to his surprise it wouldn't open. He blinked, staring at the door for a second before he patted his pockets to find his keys. “I don’t remember locking the door,” Gabriel mumbled to himself out loud as he opened the door. He waved in the direction of Dean’s side of the room before pulling a candy bar out of his pocket and flopping onto his bed, picking up where he left off in his magazine.
Suddenly, Dean was interrupted by a loud scream from outside the cabin. It was bloodcurdling, the two both jumped at the sudden noise before they processed what they had heard. After jumping out of Cas’ embrace, Dean sprinted for the flashlight on the table and clicked it on. Castiel flipped the switch for the porch light just before Dean rushed out the door to see what the commotion was. He stopped on the porch and scanned the small yard and the woods surrounding it, he swept the flashlight across the treeline, unable to make out anything in there. He called out “Hello?” for good measure. Down on the path to the main house Dean noticed one of the lights was out a bit further down the path.
"So you'll be rushing?" Charlie asked, taken back, Castiel did not seem like the type to be involved in Greek life.
Castiel chuckled, knowing Dean was not one for talking about his feelings but accepted him for who he is, and wouldn’t change that for the world. He was okay without the discussion about their relationship, he just wanted to make sure they were in agreement that they were exclusively seeing each other, especially as his feelings towards Dean grew. “Is there a section on local history? I’d love to learn more about your hometown.”
Castiel remained waiting, growing more and more impatient by the second as Dean wrapped up his chipmunk burial. “You’re a good man, Dean Winchester,” Cas said sarcastically, shivering.
Mary wished the boys a good night before she went to bed, Castiel was sitting at the kitchen table with Sam, pouring over his industrial revolution project. Dean was lounged in one of the overstuffed chairs in the living room and shouted, “Night mom!” to her before glancing at the clock and noticing it was not even nine yet. He furrowed his brow and when his mom was out of his sight he padded across the room to the kitchen.
"That's what I love about you, Castiel," Crowley said, grabbing Castiel's face and squeezing his cheeks. "Why don't we go into my office?" He said before placing a rough, toothy kiss to Castiel's neck.
Quite possibly the most exciting part of the Spring semester is picking room assignments for the following school year. Part of the excitement was the potential that everything-
If it wasn't for the shots of tequila Castiel took beforehand he would have been incredibly anxious and uncomfortable with a crowd this size, but he felt weightless and carefree with a grin plastered to his face. Charlie looked surprised at the crowd, they told her it would be packed there, but none of them could have prepared her for this level of craziness.
“I wouldn’t know, but it certainly cures the munchies,” Castiel’s nose wrinkled slightly, smelling a hint of bacon as the grill warmed.
Charlie let go of her friends and wiped her nose with the sleeve of her jacket and followed John to the ranger’s truck as Dean gave his brother one last squeeze before they pulled apart. In the truck on their way down, Dean gazed up in awe at the mountain, now aware of the profound effect it could have on a person. He gulped, closing his eyes, vowing to never step foot on this mountain again.
“Had lunch with Cas today, he’s actually a pretty cool dude,” he said, ignoring his roommate’s complaint.
"Ugh! I hate that guy! He's so boring, he just drones on and on," Garth said in a low, monotone voice, imitation the professor. Castiel chuckled, mentioning that Garth’s impression was spot on before turning his attention to his book.
Gabe informed him that Castiel had yet again stood them up for dinner. Dean would never admit to his roommate but he was starting to miss the guy, this was the longest the two had been apart since the semester first started. Castiel really took his studies seriously.
“If she was here don't you think she would have answered the door?” Bela questioned, extremely annoyed they interrupted her painting.
“Is that the one about the guys who hunt monsters?” Dean asked, peering over Sam to look at the comic.
“Cas,” Dean moaned into their kiss when Castiel gently nipped at Dean’s lower lip. He pushed forward, his body flush with Castiel’s, who now wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, pulling him closer.
Charlie said she would turn on the outdoor lights as well to better light their trek to the small cabin that served as a guest house after handing Cas the spare key. Castiel followed Dean, giving his friends a small, sad smile before jogging through the light snow to catch up. It was starting to get dark, Castiel knew if they were by the lift they would be lucky enough to see the sun setting in the distance, but their view was obscured by the dense grove of pine. He was thankful for the lanterns every fifty or so feet to illuminate their path since Dean was too frustrated to use the flashlight. It was unlikely they'd come across one, but both boys knew it wasn't the best idea to walk through the woods as dusk fell because the mountain was home to many animals they wouldn't want to encounter face to face. Castiel shivered and adjusted his hat, trying to push away the memories of the pack of howling wolves they had heard countless times before. He logically knew if they spotted any animals, they were likely more afraid of them than he would be of the animal. And Dean carried a knife. That was a comfort itself. Dean didn't say anything by the time they reached the cabin, and Cas didn't initiate the conversation to allow his friend to cool down.
“I thought you weren't the dancing type,” Castiel laughed as Dean grabbed him by the arm and dragged him towards the dance floor.
“Mom, being gay isn’t a lifestyle, it’s not like one day Cas woke up and decided to be gay,” Dean defended, “And besides, Zachariah doesn’t know.”
Castiel, who was still sitting by the windows jumped up at seeing movement in the trees. “Dean!” He called out without really knowing what he was seeing.
Michael laughed loudly, grabbing at his stomach, nearly falling over on the couch. When he finally gained his composure Michael said, “He’s a good guy. Smart enough to not room with Gabriel for another year.”
“Dean, it’s good to hear your voice,” Cas said in a low tone that made Dean’s chest feel like it dropped into his stomach.
Gabriel woke up at the crack of noon, the girl from the night before in tow as they made their way down to the main living space of the condo. Castiel was preparing lunch in the kitchen when he noticed the two, so he offered to make them something.
“Let’s go find Gabe, he’ll lead us to the beer,” Dean leaned in and shouted to Castiel, who just nodded in response.
After nearly three more hours on the beach the girls were getting ready to head back to their hotel to meet their other friends. While the girls were discussing potential plans for the evening, Michael suggested they throw a party at the condo, which was met with agreement from his brothers and Dean. The girls agreed to come to the party, and that they would bring their friends. So after they packed up at the beach, the guys split up to prepare for a last minute party. Gabriel and Michael, being over 21 went to the liquor store while Dean and Castiel hurried to the closest grocery store to buy snacks, limes and frozen pizzas. When Dean and Cas got back to the condo Gabriel was on the phone and Michael was busy figuring out the speakers on the deck.
Castiel shrugged, "Things are," he paused, "different," he bit his lip, holding back on what was really going on.
“Wait!” Cas exclaimed as he hurried towards the back of the house. He grabbed the flashlight that he and Dean had used earlier that night and when he went to hand it to Dean, Dean’s hand lingered on his, tugging him closer. Dean pulled Castiel into a hug as he told Dean to “please be safe” and the older boy nodded.
“Then buy it from someone else. You could throw a rock on the quad and hit someone who smokes,” Gabe said, throwing his arms in the air for emphasis.
"Hey, it's this guy!" Adam exclaimed and clapped Castiel on the shoulder a bit rougher than he anticipated, the alcohol dulling his senses.
“Dean?” Castiel said, confused why his friend was in his dorm. He slid a flash card into his textbook to mark his place and tilted his head, he opened his mouth to ask what he was doing there before Dean interrupted his thoughts.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Castiel said as he extended his arm to hand Dean the glass of wine.
“Happy to see you,” Cas said, his voice lower with desire as he thrust his hips forward to grind against him.
“Well you boneheads are too damn stubborn to admit it yourselves, I was just giving you a push in the right direction.”
“I don’t, but we have to try,” Dean squeezed his brother's shoulder reassuringly. “You, Charlie and Jack need to stay here- keep trying the phones, look around the house for anything that could help. I mean really turn this place upside down, got it?” Sam nodded sadly before glancing over to Ruby, who was pulling on a hat with a serious look on her face. “We’ve got this? Don’t we, Cas?” Dean said in attempt to reassure his younger brother.
“Yeah, he’s going to apply to UKan for the fall,” Dean grinned excitedly, shimmying off his coat and tossing it over the trench coat draped over the back of Cas’ desk chair.
"I like this sweater. I've never seen it before, is it new?" Cas asked, his hand lingering on Dean's chest a moment.
Castiel placed his mouth over Dean’s again as he felt himself on the verge of an orgasm, they kissed passionately, needy. Dean needed nothing more than Cas, he needed to kiss him, hold him, he needed Cas to be his. Dean moaned Cas’s name loudly as he came, sending Cas over the edge as well.
“So I spent a week with Dean at his house,” Castiel grinned and Charlie closed her mouth, then opened it again in disbelief.
"You spend every night with him voluntarily," Castiel said, making Jo burst out laughing, and Dean scowl.
"I didn't finish," he trailed off, gesturing to the paperwork. He glanced down at the clipboard and realized suddenly the paperwork was the most interesting thing in the world, he had to finish filling it out before they could see him. And if he never finished it...
“Used this suitcase in Miami,” Gabe winked at his friend, holding the thong up, ready to slingshot it across the room.
Castiel and Sam retreated downstairs to play Nintendo, and while Sam was powering it up Castiel asked what classes he was taking for the second half of the year.
“So it’s true?” Charlie gasped, her jaw dropped. “Wait, you really are in love with him? I was just joking because Sam-”
“I'll be right back,” Dean said as he bounded up the stairs, already to the top before Sam could protest more. He hurried to the phone, almost slipping on the linoleum in his socked feet.
Dean sighed when the door shut, relieved him and Cas could finally have some time alone and asked, “What should we do tonight?”
Dean pulled away to unroll the toilet paper and handed Castiel a wad of it before doing the same for himself. Castiel tossed the wet paper into the toilet after his hand and pants were sufficiently cleaned. Then eyed Dean as he gathered more to clean up Castiel’s mess.
Waking up, she was groggy, her head hurt and her vision was blurry. Besides her she could make out the unconscious body of her brother. “Ash,” she called out, shaking him. But his body was flimsy, he moved easily as she shook him. “No, no, no,” she turned him on his back and leaned down by his mouth, she couldn’t feel any breath. She began to wildly pump his chest, attempting CPR, but had to stop because she felt the sharp pain of a broken bone in her left arm. Tears streamed down her face as she looked around, but was in near complete darkness and could not see a way out. She stood up but immediately fell back down, unable to stand on her feet. Jo’s hands reached out and felt desperately at her legs, her ankles were both definitely broken. She used her good arm to drag herself around a bit, unable to find a way out and not strong enough to continue searching. Jo curled up next to her brother’s body, placing her head on his cold chest and sobbed until she fell asleep.
Castiel and Dean tended to spend more time in Dean and Gabriel’s room than Castiel’s. Both Castiel’s roommate and Gabriel were around equally, but Gabriel already knew Dean and Cas were a thing. Not that Castiel’s roommate seemed homophobic, he just felt more comfortable being with Gabriel who he already knew well and they wouldn't have to worry about judgement.
“Okay, okay, but the real question is who gets the single room?” Gabriel asked, attempting to silence the table. Instead of silencing his friends, his question only made them louder.
"I wasn't planning on attending," Castiel shoved his keys into his pocket and adjusted his backpack.
At this moment Dean Winchester realized that maybe it wasn’t such a long shot, and that maybe, he would get a chance with Castiel.
"That would be nice. How about Tuesday and Thursdays at 7?" Cas asked after he mentally pictured his schedule to see when he was free.
“Pass me one, will ya?” Dean asked, extending his palm towards his roommate, not turning away from the mirror mounted on the wall.
“Of course,” he said with a reaffirming smile before she leaned in and placed a kiss on his lips before waving goodbye to him and his brothers. Michael shut the door behind her and sighed with wide eyes, “Finally.”
Castiel frowned, “We’re already in a relationship Dean, I can assure you you won't be wondering if I'll ever call. Why would a date be any different than when we just hang out?”
“Well I’m happy you’re better now,” Dean said, not wanting to push him too much for information when he didn’t sound much like sharing, especially over the phone.
Dean looked up, surprised to see the classroom had mostly filled up, and met eyes with an older guy with a full dark beard. “All yours,” Dean said, sliding his backpack closer to him so there was more leg room. Dean tried not to check out this older guy but Dean apparently had a weakness for blue eyed men. Dean then rubbed his temple, knowing the only other blue eyed guy he had been checking out is Cas. His mind started to race, beginning to think about how the other day Castiel was so distracted watching Dean that he walked into someone.
They quickly reached the address Benny gave Dean, Dean recognized the street name because the apartment was just down the street from Campus Pizza. Cas didn't even have time to finish his joint, so they lingered outside for a few minutes while they smoked the rest of it before going up the stairs to the second floor apartment.  Dean approached the door and knocked loudly on it, before a girl with dark hair opened the door.
“What are you doing?” Dean’s voice startled Cas, he jumped and blushed deep red. “Were you looking at my porn?”
Castiel looked confused for a moment before turning to look at Dean, who looked away from Cas to stare at the floor, he felt like a kid who was about to get in trouble for tattling.
Gabe grinned, turning back to his friends as they crossed off the sidewalk across the yard of the house. “You ready, Cassie?”
Castiel packed the rest of his belongings up when he came back from his last exam of his first year, glancing over at the other half of the room that belonged to his roommate. The bed was stripped and the dresser drawers were pulled out, signaling his roommate departed sometime while Castiel was gone without a goodbye; not that Castiel necessarily cared, the two hadn't spoken much except to discuss matters of their shared space. He slipped his backpack over his shoulders and grabbed the handles of his laundry basket, taking one last quiet moment in his dorm room before he closed the door. He nearly locked the door behind him, but remembered Meg instructed their hall to leave the doors unlocked so maintenance to have easy access. He chose to take the elevator because his hands were quite full and he didn't want to risk dropping his suitcase down a flight of stairs.
Castiel’s hands stopped running up and down Dean’s sides so he could look at him a moment. “You don’t want ‘em to know?”
Castiel leaned against the railing on the porch and quietly said, “What?” to Dean, gesturing to Benny.
“I suppose you’re right, he will get over it. I just don’t understand why Michael started this whole disaster.”
"It's not running? Weren't we the last ones here? Only Charlie has the key," Sam trailed off as he stared out over the mountain, the ski lift stopped in its tracks, through the snow he couldn't see past a couple chairs but it looked like they had been stopped a while based on the few inches of snow built up.
“Okay!” She raised her hands in defense before giving him a stern look and turning around to allow him to finish cleaning.
Gabriel was immediately nowhere to be found in the sea of people (as usual), most likely already chasing after whichever girl was in the skimpiest costume. Jo took a long sip from the flask stashed in the elastic band around her thigh, meant for holding a fake gun to go with her cop outfit. Charlie leaned in close to Jo to say something in her ear, Dean picked up on the words 'plan’ and 'alone’ and was going to ask what their plan was but before he could the cop and Charlie; in a star trek dress; sneaked off into the crowd.
Sam shook his head and hurried up the stairs to get his own swimsuit and towel for their day at the lake.
"Un-fuckin-believable," Dean said, getting up from the table, leaving behind his half eaten plate of ravioli, and storming off.
Charlie and Castiel were hunkered down in the basement of the library, they had increased their study sessions to three times a week as Charlie’s engineering classes became more and more difficult. She pulled the pencil she had been nibbling on out of her mouth and said, “You guys are really ready to live together?”
"Really, how was it?" Mary asked, she had never tried it before and was curious how raw fish could taste good.
“Zachariah doesn’t like company,” Castiel almost snorted, remembering how much he hated when Cas brought Ruby home despite her always being a perfect guest. Her reputation was just that; a reputation; she put up a tough mean face for everyone at school, it was cliche but she was just misunderstood. And Zachariah even liked Ruby, Castiel had no idea what his uncle would think of Dean, and he really didn’t want to find out.
Cas tilted his head slightly when she mentioned Greek Week, not knowing what it is. Luckily Charlie caught on to that and continued, "Founders day for the first frat and sorority are on the same week, so that whole week gets pretty crazy." Castiel nodded, now remembering hearing Gabriel talk about it over the summer.
“Yeah, and I can take a look at the lift when there’s more light, maybe see what caused it to go down.”
After they moved closer to the fire Dean spoke up, “I lead us down the wrong path, Ruby nearly fell off a cliff. She screamed and it must have heard her. We tried to set it on fire like the plan, it hurt it, but it just pissed it off. We were nearly back here when it grabbed her and took off.” Dean stared ahead into the fire, guilt all over his face lit up like the flames in front of him.
"Sorry, uh," Castiel stammered nervously and rubbed the stubble forming on his chin, "I have an appointment."
“Come on!” The guy across the table from Cas shouted, and threw his hands up in frustration at the spilled beer.
“Don’t say it’s not like that, because i know it is exactly like that. You don’t need to hide from me, Cassie. You’re my brother, Dean’s my best friend, I’m happy for you two!” He reached over and shook his brother gently with a goofy grin.
Dean started their journey to the cabin excited, but as he neared the mountain he began chewing on his nails nervously. Sam would have normally called his behavior gross, but he was too busy sharing his iPod with his not-girlfriend Ruby who he practically begged Dean to let him bring. Before they picked Ruby up Dean complained incessantly to Castiel in the passenger seat, who looked over at his best friend sympathetically; he didn’t like the girl anymore than Dean did. Dean didn’t understand why Sam liked her, but he figured it was something to do with the rebellion sixteen year old's were attracted to. Sam and Ruby busied themselves with whatever music teens listened to, Dean made a comment about Mickey Mouse, and Sam bitch-faced while Ruby said, "Modest Mouse, dumbass." Dean and Cas shared a look that could be summed up to
Castiel heard movement inside the van before he saw Andy’s head peering through a window, once he realized it was Cas the door opened and a steady stream of smoke poured out. “Cas! Hey, man! What’s up?”
Dean bit his lip, the one thing he hated about being at home was having to get his parents permission for most things. They didn’t usually care, he came and went as he pleased, but he knew he would have to ask before having someone over other than Ash and Jo- especially at nearly 9 in the evening. Having the freedom he had at school ripped away in an instant was always an adjustment during breaks, and it caused a lot of fights between him and his parents. “Let me check, hang on a sec,” Dean said, dropping the phone and letting it dangle by the cord.
"Shit, no. Oh wait," Dean dug through his bag and found a bag of sunflower seeds, squished, clearly been in his bag a while. Castiel finally got the courage to drink the dark liquor, it seemed they would have to drink their dinner tonight unless they got hungry enough to brave the nighttime single digit temperatures. The drink warmed the two boys from inside, but Dean's fingers were starting to go numb since they had yet to start a fire.
“Shit,” Dean swore as he walked towards a tall cabinet. The door was jammed so he slammed his shoulder into it to no avail.
When Dean looked up Michael was gone and he wiped his forehead with the back of his palm. As much as he enjoyed spending the past week with Castiel he was glad to be heading back to the dorm where they wouldn’t have to hide from Michael anymore.
After Bobby told the story, he’d always announce it was his bed time immediately after, leaving the kids to sit out by the fire, their imaginations running wild until they too turned in for the night.
“I can't be around him right now,” his voice cracked, he sounded like he was about to cry. It completely broke Dean's heart to hear him this way. “I didn't know where else to turn to. Michael always takes his side, and Gabriel can't be bothered to get in the middle of it,” he rushed out in a huff.
“I- uh, I’ll go grab Jo,” Dean stammered after he shoved on his boots, when he stood up his green eyes met Castiel’s for a moment, looking as joyful as they did last night, with almost a twinkle to them. He rushed out the door with it slamming loudly behind him.
Dean saluted their RA, Chuck, as they walked past him on their way to the elevator. He saluted Dean back and lowered his glazed-over gaze, adjusting his backpack over his shoulder. Gabriel smirked, he supplied liquor for Chuck, very, very often. Chuck went through a couple bottles a week, whatever he could get his hands on.
"What?" The two looked at each other for a moment with confusion before Dean asked, "Wait, did you think you weren't going to see me until the fall?"
Castiel laughed loudly and turned on his side to face his partner. “You were the one making it awkward.”
“Oh you guarantee it? You’re giving me the famous Cas guarantee?” Dean teased, pulling the car keys out of his pocket as they neared his father’s car towards the back of the parking lot. Dean learned from his father to always park far back, away from other cars to avoid careless bumps from shopping carts or dings by car doors.
“Dean,” Dean said, slurping dripping ice cream off the cone. “Jo,” he said because her mouth was full and she smiled with her cheeks puffed out.
“Some people care about how they look and don’t just roll out of bed,” Dean teased as he shoved the rest of the first muffin in his mouth and wrapped the second in a napkin, shooting a look to Cas.
“I don’t know, I think I might take my chances with Gabe’s crabs,” Sam said with a disgusted look on his face.
, the finest cuisine the Kansas public school system could produce. He waved to Sam, standing in line at the register, who scowled at his older brother when Jess turned her attention away from Sam for half a second to see who was waving at them. "Bitch," Dean mumbled under his breath, hoping his brother could feel his curse. When Dean sat down at his usual table no one was there yet, slightly bummed, Cas usually got to the cafeteria first and always greeted Dean with his usual toothy grin. Dean wasn't waiting long when Tessa and Charlie showed up, bickering about the latest episode of Buffy.
Sam let out a huff of laughter, relieved that something finally got Dean to stop waiting by the phone, but then quickly furrowed his brow and called after Dean, “I wasn’t serious about throwing rocks at birds you know!”
“Let me show you around,” Dean said, eager to get Castiel away from the stares of his mother and little brother. Dean led him away from the doorway, past the couch and pointed to a door past the stairs. “Bathroom, and kitchen,” he pointed through an entryway. “And basement, that's where the movies and games are,” he led him into the kitchen where the door to the basement was.
Dean laughed and hooked their arms together at the elbows before they started walking down the boardwalk, the smell of fried dough tempting them to come closer. Dean’s mouth began watering at the smell and he asked if Cas also wanted a piece.
Soon enough Dean was pulling into his driveway next to the Impala, sitting pretty and pristine as ever. Dean grinned just seeing her, thinking maybe he could convince dad to let him take her out today. He was really sick of his beater, he missed the feeling of the cool leather beneath his finger tips, the sound of legos rattling when the AC kicked on (Dad still complained every time he heard it, even after all these years).
“Why are you wearing jeans?” He asked with a classic Sam Winchester bitch face. He peered past his brother into the room, Castiel was seated upright in Dean’s bed with a blanket only covering his bottom half. “Uh, nevermind,” he said before turning around and scurrying away down the hall.
"Yeah, dude. I've hooked up with so many guys since I got there, absolutely-" Dean stopped speaking, shutting his mouth, then groaned. "Shit, you're the last person I should be saying that to."
Gabriel had disappeared, and Michael was chatting with a blonde perched on a bar stool. “Want to dance?” Dean asked, taking a large gulp of his whatever it was.
Castiel grinned at his friend, the smile faltering when Dean removed his arm from around his shoulders. “If one does, they will go out of business in a month’s time, I guarantee you.”
When they had nearly finished their hot beverages, Charlie asked, “So how did you know we were here? Did my texts finally go through?” She pulled out her phone, checking but saw that the message had failed to send.
Castiel glanced at his watch, it read 8:24, "The library," Castiel said as he shook beads of coffee off his hand.
“Please tell me you brought weed,” Cas said to his brother, he had insisted Dean ask Gabe to bring Cas’s stash with him, he was desperate for it, he had felt so on edge and tense in a way he had not felt before. It scared him, yesterday he had split his last pill in half to get more time, and now that it was gone Castiel needed something to calm him down.
On their way to work after lunch Charlie and Castiel were discussing books, Charlie was a huge fan of fantasy, where Castiel was more of a nonfiction reader. Their conversation was interrupted by someone shouting, "Hey Cas! Wait up!"
“I asked if Michael was coming, and he told me he wasn’t,” Castiel said, staring angrily at his empty glass after draining it.
“Were you in the car when it happened? Those carts can get pretty fast,” Mary teased and then patted Dean’s cheek lovingly.
Dean scowled and turned away from her and took a long sip of his beer. He stormed off to find a trash can, then opened another beer. A beer can flew through the air and landed in the trash, narrowly missing Dean's arm. Dean turned around quickly to see who threw that and was face to face with Gabriel.
Besides the uncomfortably loud music, sea of sweaty bodies, and hard sofa, it wasn't anywhere near as bad as he expected. Here Castiel was, wishing he had allowed himself to do something fun sooner instead of feeling bad for himself in bed surrounded by half drank cups of coffee and discarded take out boxes from the Chinese restaurant below their apartment that didn't deliver; but then suddenly started delivering to his apartment the day after Meg told him it was over despite Castiel never actually ordering the seemingly endless amount of spring rolls. A shower, a pair of pants that didn't have an elastic waist, and a stomach full of vodka was enough to make Castiel feel human again.
After Gabriel finished his game and chugged another beer Dean told him that he and Jo were going back to the room. Gabriel nodded, understanding. “Cassie, I’ll walk you back,” he put a hand on his brothers shoulder and the two followed Dean and Jo out the door.
“Now I’d love to sit and hear all about your cozy winter getaway in Dean Winchester’s bed,” she said as she began stuffing her things back into her bag, “but it’s quittin’ time and I have a hot date tonight!” Charlie grinned and slung her bag over her shoulder before patting Castiel on the shoulder and saluting him goodbye.
"He doesn't know I'm gay, and I'm pretty sure he's straight," Cas said, looking down and picking at his eraser.
“Your father and I will be gone all night, I don’t want anyone driving, it’s dangerous,” she said, shutting the front door behind them to prevent the cold from seeping inside.
The other man laughed and inspected his hand, there was a small cut where the glass broke skin, but it was surely going to heal quickly. “Dean,” he extended his other hand out to the other man, who shook it after he finished drying his hands.
Dean grabbed his bag in a hurry from where he left it in the den, but not before making sure the bottle of whiskey he had packed was there. It was. “Let’s go, Cas!” He barked as he snatched a flashlight from Charlie’s hand.
“That’s why we’re going to get it to come to us,” Dean said as he began bundling up once again, the ranger jacket pulled on over his own for extra warmth as it neared midnight and the temperatures outside steadily dropped.
“I never thought I’d see the day Dean Winchester shows feeling towards another human being,” Jo snorted.
After Dean got off the phone he was jittery with excitement; he hadn't seen Cas in weeks and now he was coming to see him.
“They were taking name tags off people's doors. I don't understand why, but they thought it was hilarious.”
“You were busy with those sorority chicks,” Dean said sarcastically and Jo snorted, making a twisted face.
Benny, being the designated driver, managed to persuade Jo and Ash to leave just shy of one in the morning on the condition he would stop at a drive thru on their way home for a greasy burger at Ash's request. After finishing their game of flip cup against a couple of Michael's high school friends, Dean and Cas retreated upstairs, leaving Michael and the remainder of his friends to continue playing downstairs.
Benny smiled at Dean and turned away as soon as Professor Mills walked into the room, greeting the class. Dean gently shook his head to himself and blinked a few times, attempting to shake the thoughts of blue eyed men out of his head.
“The most fun is pickin’ on Gabe,” Dean said, laughing, which earned him a punch in the shoulder from his roommate and a smile from Castiel.
“He’ll be here soon,” Gabe lifted the camera and pointed it at Dean. “Why are you so concerned with my brothers whereabouts?”
“He won’t be, it’s nearly seven, he’s probably home on the couch half asleep watching the news,” Castiel said, with good reason too. He had spent enough time at the Winchester’s household to know their routines.
Dean threw a pillow in Ash's general direction, but he did not protest, Ash just accepted the pillow, more than ready for some sleep.
"Go to the psych department, there should be a list in the department office. There will be appointment sign up sheets too," Gabriel instructed his brother, knowing giving him instructions would calm him down.
Gabriel cupped a hand around the end of his cigarette to block the wind while he lit it before he stopped in his tracks. “Guys! It's the van!” He exclaimed with an exhale of smoke. Andy's van was parked on the side of the road adjacent to the street they were walking down.
“That’s no fun,” Gabriel whined, before drinking and putting another finger down. “This is almost over, guys!” Before wagging his remaining finger- his middle one. Castiel, Garth, Anna also took their first drinks. “Alright, I’ve never,” he drew out the ‘r’, “kissed someone of the same sex,” he smirked, knowing he would get his brother and Dean with this one.
“They are,” the girl said without turning around. Quieter she said to Gabriel, “Your brother and his boyfriend are sweet.”
"Cas, I'm just fuckin' with you, you know that right?" Dean said, hoping he didn't offend the kid too much, they didn’t know each other very well and Dean did like hanging out with him. From what he had heard from Gabriel, Castiel was pretty innocent and naive, he didn't want to make him afraid to be around Dean.
“I don’t care if you’re gay, ya know, I just,” Dean went to rub his cheek but stopped when he remembered the cheese dust on his fingers. “You didn’t need to lie. Or at least, you shouldn’t have to feel like you need to,” Dean shrugged.
"Nothing," she shook her head. She paused for a minute before laughing more, "Just glad to see Tony is getting some."
"Yeah, yeah, I'll get him back. Wrap it up," Dean slapped Gabe in the chest before waving his hand in the air trying to get Castiel's attention after he exited the bathroom. Castiel swayed through the living room towards Dean. By the time Castiel made it over to Dean, Gabriel was long gone, the door was already shut behind him.
“Hey, Cas, let’s go!” Dean exclaimed, ushering him away from the door, not even allowing him to step inside.
“Cassie is the winner for biggest slut, or whatever!” Gabriel announced, earning a glare from his youngest brother. “Well that was fun, don’t we all know each other so much better now?”
Gabe shrugged and tossed the can he offered to his brother to Jo, who cracked it open and downed it in one go. “Yeah, he lives there.”
Castiel mumbled something under his breath, causing his brother to shoot him a look and Castiel’s jaw stiffened. Dean and Jo looked at each other, puzzled, but ignored it.
“Hiya Cas,” Dean said smoothly, acting as if he didn't just run up a flight of stairs in a few steps to get to the phone.
Dean and Castiel looked at each other then at Gabe nervously, Dean’s face beet red and Castiel panting slightly. Gabriel didn’t seem to notice, he was too focused on unwrapping the chocolate to care about anything else, not even that his brother and his roommate were under the blanket on Dean’s bed. He clearly didn't notice as Castiel felt around under the covers for his pants and pulled them on under the blanket, zipping them over his painfully hard erection and re-adjusting himself in his pants.
“That’s a good idea, let’s miss the bus,” Dean said with a smile, but followed Cas out the door with Sam hot on their tail.
“Oh yeah?” Dean asked, feeling an overwhelming sense of relief that his boyfriend was out of town, not that he was purposely avoiding him.
The four made it to the dining hall before it was even open for lunch and had to wait at the entrance behind another eager group. When the kitchen staff finally opened the doors Dean made a beeline for the grilling station, his growling stomach patiently waiting for a cheeseburger. Castiel appeared next to him and lightly drummed his fingers on his plate. “Nothing cures a hangover like a burger, eh Cas?” Dean asked.
“Well,” Jo started and took a sip to prepare herself to tell this story; over a year later and she was still bitter about it. “When we were in high school Dean was obsessed with this girl Lisa. She was the girls soccer captain, Dean even joined the soccer team so he could be around her more- he
“Well you- you said you didn’t have lube,” Castiel stammered, shivers went throughout his entire body from contact of Dean’s breath on his face.
Instead of interrupting the boys, Mary turned around and headed back upstairs with a smile on her face,
“I’m positive. I would tell you if you were,” Castiel smiled before stuffing another roll into his mouth.
“I’m the same with Sammy, I get it. I’d be scared shitless if Sammy went missing, even for a couple days.”
A girl with long, dreadlocked hair was inhaling off a large bong. “You sure this guy’s cool? He looks like a cop,” she said as she exhaled, raising an eyebrow at Cas’ trenchcoat.
As soon as she left Dean unscrewed the lid to the bottle of scotch and took a long sip, holding it out to Cas. "Don't you think we should be sober? So we can be fully alert and aware." Castiel said, eyeing Dean uneasily.
"Lot of homework already?" Dean asked as they stood up to put their plates with the pile of other dirty dishes.
"Lunch," Dean laughed. "Hey, I'll see you later okay?" Dean turned around, he had gone in the opposite direction he was walking to catch up with Castiel. He walked a few feet before turning to face Cas and waved at him, his eyes glued to Castiel's.
“It was,” Castiel paused, unsure how to explain the mixed emotions he had experienced over the past month, “strange,” he said with his eyes squinted but with a smile on his face. “How was yours?”
"Whatever, he'll show up. Can we eat?" Dean asked impatiently, they had already waited a while for Cas to show up and Dean was starving, especially after spending hours smelling pizza at work.
“Too late, I’ve already got my slingshot!” Dean called from upstairs, his voice singing with laughter.
"But he lied to you. Doesn't that piss you off? He's your goddamn brother! Don’t you care that he took off with some random dude?" Dean exclaimed then stared at his open can, wanting to crush it beneath his fingers; but he wouldn't waste precious beer like that.
"Alright, Cas and I will go check Bobby's office. Sam, you and Ruby go to the attic. Charlie and Jack you guys go to the basement. There's gotta be something around here that can help," Dean ordered before they all nodded and split up to begin searching for some sort of clue as to what they were up against, or a weapon.
Wow this is it! This is the final chapter! Thank you so much to everyone who read, commented, subscribed, or gave kudos you are all so wonderful! This has been a long journey (long than anticipated) but I still have a lot of ideas for Dean and Castiel's journey through undergrad so there will definitely be more to come. Thank you so much for the support!
