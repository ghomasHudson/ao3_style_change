John wraps his hands around the seatback and shoves himself down, taking the entirety of Sherlock’s large cock in one slide.
Sherlock closes around them and sucks and John emits a small shocked sound, his breath hot on Sherlock’s ear. The bitter taste spreads over Sherlock's taste buds, his mouth flooding with saliva as he runs his tongue up and down the length of John’s blunt fingers.
“Sherlock, if you’ll shut up for a minute, you pompous cock, I was going to suggest that we move this upstairs, considering that it’s…” John looks at his watch. “1:03am.”
Just then his mobile buzzed in his pocket, the screen lit up with a text from Ellen, who had seen his car parked on the hill, inviting him for tea and a game of Hearts. So instead of tearing Oliver Polk a new arsehole, Sherlock found himself at the Edicott kitchen table for the second time in so many days, a steaming mug of lapsang souchong in front of him, venting to Ellen, who nodded sympathetically as she played a game of solitaire across from him.
Sherlock groans in disappointment, soft and low, feeding it directly into John’s ear again, and John feels it spike down his spine to burn low in his belly.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say they should probably reschedule, that he wasn’t much company at the moment, but John hurried on, preempting Sherlock. “I know it’s been a rough week. I know you probably want to cancel, but hear me out.”
He swept the chocolate over my lips once more and I bent to press my mouth to his neck, leaving behind a perfectly shaped kiss on the column of his throat.
John was a skilled kisser, Sherlock realized, as he expertly maneuvered his mouth over Sherlock’s, changing the pressure and the direction, the kiss evolving over time. By the end of it Sherlock, the one who had kissed many men over the course of his life, was the one who felt dazed. This time he was the one slow to open his eyes. When he did he found John smiling at him, his eyes crinkled at their corners.
“I don’t do this either,” he admits. “I don’t know what it was about you, but…” he trails off, pausing to lick his lips. You nod. You know what he means.
You, last night, asking me to seduce that woman. Watching her put her hands on me, wondering how far I'd go.
“I’ve got you,” John says, softly, “you tell me when you’re ready,” and Sherlock grabs his hand to press kisses to John’s fingertips in response.
Your hands are heavy with blood and they fumble the key in the lock. The stars wheel above you and the heavy summer air is velvet on your skin and he’s there beside you, vibrating with the same longing you feel trembling through you, and finally, finally you shove it home and you’re through.
Kind blue eyes gazed back at him. Sherlock’s throat felt tight and hot with gratitude, his tongue thick and mute inside his mouth.
“No, it’s not a girlfriend,” Sherlock murmurs, a look passing between him and John that makes John's heart clench inside his chest.
Sherlock laughs at that, snorting in an endearing way that makes John smile. His cheeks, bruised with happiness.
“Imagine me stepping in close, and pressing a kiss just…” John teases his breath over Sherlock’s jaw. “…here.”
“They make honey from flowers,” Charlie said. Her eyes flared. “And they sting!” John nodded, wincing sheepishly. “That’s about the extent of it, I’m afraid.”
Sherlock pinwheels his hand through the air. “Yes, yes, I’ve heard your objections. They are duly noted. Ok?” He lounges back against the sofa back, louche and at ease, his expensive clothing clashing with the faded brown of the slipcover. John sees the room through Sherlock’s eyes: dowdy and mismatched, like an eclectic rummage sale’s leftovers.
“Does it ever go away?” Whispered as Sherlock trails his lips over John’s stubble stippled cheeks. Brushing. John flashes, wracked by tiny hot shivers. Quicksilver, they dart through him.
I kissed the crown, now revealed, plump and shining. I kissed the shaft, felt his veins flex and throb against my lips. I kissed the base, just above his sac.
“You would have pushed her dress up,” you went on, “all the way up her legs,” and I could see it in my mind, the emerald dress in the crooks of my thumbs, rushing up her soft brown legs like eddying water to gather in satiny ruffled folds at her waist. “She would have on some kind of tiny, ridiculous knickers. The kind you love, John.” I squirmed against the metal, my sweat slick skin gliding, thinking, no, no she wouldn’t have worn any. You said, “She was the fussy type, yes? She would have been bare beneath them, don’t you think?” I shook my head, breathing hard, looking down the length of my body at you, at the icy fire of your eyes. “No?” She would have been trimmed and maintained but she would have kept her bush and when I told you that you blushed a deep, startled crimson and your eyes went absolutely black and you said, “Indeed,” and leaned forward and buried your nose in my pubic hair.
Sherlock’s head jerked comically fast in his direction and John giggled as Sherlock said, deadly seriously, “I will very,
John looks at him with pride, which makes Sherlock smile despite himself, as John holds open the office door for him.
Sherlock’s body brushes against John’s when he has to lean over him, his chest and half-hard cock rubbing against John’s back, slippery and warm. His curls tickling John’s expectant skin, sending tiny lightning bolts striking through John. Scorching. Sizzling.
Because Sherlock knows that it can’t be true. John Watson is hiding something, for the very basic reason that, in Sherlock’s experience,
“And what if I want to be your assistant?” Sherlock’s voice comes out slightly hoarse. He clears his throat and takes a sip of water, feeling uncharacteristically off balance.
Sherlock lets the phone drop face down with a muted clatter and lays his palms flat on the tabletop.
John doesn’t give him a chance to settle, just fucks in deep, shoving Sherlock forward so that John’s pink plastic prick catches against Sherlock’s mouth and drags a sticky line across his cheek.
“Jesus buggering Christ,” he mumbled into the rug, nose smashed into the dog hair which had collected in its fibres.
Sherlock grunts and with one last purposeful roll of his hips, he’s gone. John’s back prickles as the air streams over him.
If John at his most beautiful was when he was giving himself to me, John at his most commanding, his most masterful, was when I was doing the same to him.
Sherlock takes a step forward until his stockinged feet enter John’s field of vision, budging up against the toes of John’s shoes.
“Noor, did you have an objection you’d like to share?” Vivica asked, now that the motion had successfully passed.
Inside the elevator, Sherlock says, “I should go. I should have, already. But, I honestly never expected to—“
You’ve done this before, but usually you’re drunk and usually you’re desperately trying to ignore whatever porn addled prattle your erstwhile bedmate keeps up as you stumble home in the early hours of the morning. Usually you’re not sober and still buzzing on a truly spectacular nicotine high and feeling like you could get on your knees for this man and still feel cherished. You feel transparent with need.
And much to my delight and bewilderment, you wouldn’t let me tidy a thing. There was a system to which even the dust had a purpose and which I was not to disturb. You called me Watson and I called you Holmes and I kept you in slippers and tea and tobacco and fetched for you when you couldn’t be arsed to leave whatever pretty Sisyphean problem you were ruminating on that day. Otherwise, I was left to my own devices.
After having consulted his journal one more time, he grabbed fresh cypress-wood baseboards, his bee smoker and a ball of baling twine and newspaper for tinder, matches, and a large container of sugar syrup that he had mixed up yesterday. He added to this a few new covers, his frame grips, a pry bar, a small upholstery hammer, a bag of nails, and his bee suit. He double checked that the metal lock-box in the corner of his trunk had enough medication to dose all ten hives if necessary and enough alcohol to complete a bee wash to check infestation levels. Varoa mites were the biggest threat to his colonies right now and had carried off nearly half of his hives in his first year of beekeeping. The last thing he added were ten large concrete bricks he would use to ensure that the covers stayed in place over the winter.
Hayley had left for school some indeterminate time earlier. Sherlock had woken to the front door clicking in its jamb just before burying his face in his pillow and falling back asleep. Now the sun was shining fully through the bay window above him. Ten tons of pellucid autumn light poured down on him and made him wince. He needed paracetamol and coffee before he could fully appreciate the day’s beauty.
“I’ll check the hall closet. Have you eaten? You probably haven’t had time to go to the shops, yeah? Feel free to help yourself to anything of mine. I’ll be back in a second.”
John’s heels push under Sherlock’s bottom pillow, toes curling against the cool wood of his headboard.
John pours them each a whiskey and, skirting the edge of the mattress, which is laid out before the hearth and piled with two fluffy duvets and all of their bedroom pillows, John hands one down to the Roman gladiator laid out naked on top of the marshmallow cloud of blankets.
“I have been, but something you said resonated with me and I’m rethinking my approach. If it’d be alright, I’d like to get your perspective.”
“Stay,” Sherlock says softly, shuffling even closer. John can feel Sherlock’s breath brush the edge of his ear. He shivers, shivering-trembling-shivering, all the way down to his toes.
Ella looks surprised at this change in subject for a second, but quickly schools her expression back into one of gentle neutrality. “You’ve never spoken to me about wanting to get married. Has Sherlock brought it up?”
Someone, somewhere, had listened. Sherlock had lived. And once he had made it through the requisite three months of rehabilitation, John had agreed to meet him for coffee.
This chapter was a healing chapter for me to write. I can't stomach angst right now, so it's sappy and the ending was a little bit ridiculous and I hope it made you smile at some point. Thank you so much for following along. Your comments and support literally give me life. <3 <3
His whole body blushes as he catches sight of himself in the mirror out of the corner of his eye. A flash of hot and cold that tingles along his scalp and prickles down his spine.
Sherlock can’t see John’s face around the flared cerulean skirt of the underside of his tentacles, but he can feel that he’s rapidly approaching his first orgasm. Sherlock can always tell when John is about to come. John has told him that the first one lasts the longest. That it prepares his body to take his mate’s seed and can go on for minutes, sometimes as long as a half an hour. His pink hole in the center of his body is pulsing against Sherlock’s lips, contracting around Sherlock as he alternates between plunging in and out and licking. Licking the thick, intoxicating juices that John’s body produces when he’s in heat.
The trees are heavily laden with apples. Red and gold and pink globes pull the boughs down towards the ground. John picks one as he walks.
“—And when I voice one unfavourable opinion, about my sister, mind you, who I fancy I know rather better than you, who’ve never met her—“
John’s hands stilled in the water and Sherlock felt the weight of his gaze settle on him. Sherlock turned back towards him and felt John’s hand, wet and sudsy and very warm, encircle his wrist. His fingers slid down the outside of Sherlock’s hand and squeezed gently. In the yellow light of the kitchen his eyes were muddied, hazel above the green of his jumper and he looked unaccountably sad. “I’m so sorry.”
John doesn’t make him wait any longer. He leans in and tucks into the feast that is Sherlock’s truly glorious arse.
“I have to have you,” John said into my ear as the allegro swelled around us. “I have to have you right now.”
There is no way that John is going to be able to bugger himself against the wall. Even with his heels pressed flush against it, his bum doesn’t quite get close enough to take it deep. And really, that’s the whole point of the damn thing isn’t it? His desk, on the other hand, has four thick, sturdy legs. It’s an antique, according to Mrs.Hudson, something original to the flat. John believes it. He’s tried to budge it before and got nothing but an almost dislocated shoulder for his trouble. It’s a behemoth.
“Dr. Watson,” he said, shaking the man’s hand. “Hello, Charlie.” He nodded to the girl who’s eyes were trained on the gravel drive. John took his hand back from Sherlock and wrapped it around her shoulder, pulling her into his body.
But you were simply contrary, lounging in your armchair with your pipe in one hand and a book in the other and a dreamy far off look in your eyes as you contemplated the mantle. It was a look I would soon learn not to interrupt, but that first time I knew no better and sharply rapped my knuckles to the window pane and brought you startled from it.
“There’s lube.” The slapping sound of flesh on flesh floats back from the front seat. John smiles and then traps it, biting his lip. Sherlock, breathless, “There’s lube in the box. Please retrieve it.”
“You take my cock like such a good boy,” he says, his words slurring slightly. “I love seeing your pink lips stretched out around me. I love watching your throat fill with me. I love how you’re listening to my wish and not touching yourself. Your poor little cock is so hard and pink. I know it’s difficult. You’re doing so, so well.
John undoes the buttons on his shirt so that it can hang open, giving him free reign of his hands. He gets his fingers wet and plucks at Sherlock’s nipples, sending frissons cracking through him and making his cock twitch and bob in the empty air. Sherlock feels his bollocks tighten, squeezing close to his body and he wills himself to calm. It doesn’t work as well as it usually does and Sherlock feels, in the background, a rising, cresting, feeling building.
“That’s a shame,” Zoe said and when John raised his eyebrows she added, “Just that you haven’t anyone here to help take care of your mum.”
Sherlock doesn’t touch him, but it’s as if he does. The words crackle along John’s skin like an electric current. His nerves lit and sparking and endlessly aware of the man standing behind him. It’s that feeling again, of coming gloriously, painfully alive.
“All right. And you must, of course, call me John.” Sherlock inclined his head and let his mind dissect the pair a bit before reining it in. John had clumps of sleep still caught in the corners of his eyes and a day’s worth of stubble shadowing his jaw. His hair was finger combed and mussed and his jumper a tad wrinkled, as if just pulled from a dryer that had sat cold and forgotten for days. A bit rumpled overall compared to the man of military grade coiff that Sherlock had met two days before. He found it compelling for no reason other than that this was useful data when taking the measure of the man.
It had seemed impossible that he would ever be able to forgive Sherlock for leaving him behind. Sherlock being alive was almost as devastating as his death had been.
Once John has completed another reconnaissance sweep of the car with his eyes and squeezes the back of Sherlock’s neck, signalling the ok, Sherlock presses play.
“Like you’re imagining me naked,” he said, raising his hands to his chest to do up the last of his buttons. I sighed. He ruined all my fun.
When John comes back to himself he is lying curled on his side in the fetal position. Come is drying in tacky patches across his chest and stomach and the drumstick is stuck to the inside of his right thigh. He is tender all over, skin pulpy and raw.
“Is he telling you about how he used to be a famous detective?” Zoe said, loud in the quiet that had fallen over the room in the wake of Hayley finishing her story. The others’ cheeks were pink from the hilarity as all heads swiveled to regard Sherlock.
“I appreciate it,” he said, softly, as they stood. “Thank you, Ellen. You and Zoe. I—“ he cut off, unable to continue.
The right thing for his business is to go into the hotel and put on a grateful face, shake hands with donors, and endure their inevitable requests to effect how their money will be spent.
“You’re right you know, you should have been a father. You could have been one, but I was selfish and I knew what I was doing when I asked you to marry me. I wanted you to be mine…”
Sherlock’s eyes slip shut, the corners wrinkling into a wince. He runs two fingertips over his brow.
The flower beds are thick with the decaying roughage of what were once an abundance of summer blooms. John can see evidence of day lilies and iris, peony and the ubiquitous rose.  The clematis vines on the garage are shriveling up.
“Masturbating helped relieve…tension,” Sherlock says carefully, as if he is considering his words and trying to pick the right ones. John smiles, kindly, says, “Yeah, I bet it did,” but Sherlock shakes his head as if John isn’t understanding.
Sherlock looks at him as if he’s trying to decide if John is angry. Slightly skittish, slightly defensive. Unsure.
They had sat, armchairs pulled in tight like elbows, legs extended, toes curling towards the warmth, and chin wagged like girls for hours.
He tucked his tongue inside the rim of my foreskin and ran it around, causing it to retract further and my cock to lengthen and thicken. It hung heavy and full over John’s reddened mouth, the weight of it dragging across his bottom lip. My heart crashed down to beat in my navel at the sight, blood rushing towards my lower extremities, and I felt dizzy, my pulse pounding. He teased the tip of his tongue against my sensitive slit as the dark plummy head was fully revealed, and as I watched, a bead of precome pearled on the pink bed of his tongue.
Sherlock, his heart racing, unaccustomed to the intimacy of such a moment, took his hand back and turned, busying himself with spooning some of the fried rice into a pyrex for John to take with him.
All day long it rests against John’s right foot. Rattling each time John accidentally kicks it. It’s a constant reminder. A torture. A tease.
John’s fist glides, wet and fast, up and down the curving shaft. Cinching tighter at the head. When Sherlock moans John can feel it vibrate inside him.
His plump shiny head appearing each time Sherlock pulls John’s foreskin down and sweeps his thumb over the crown.
You look up at him, through your lashes. Mouth hovering over the tip, arse in the air, back bowed, you present a picture. He watches you from beneath his arm, you can see the flicker of his lashes, the sheen of his eyes. You watch as he sinks his teeth into his lip, bites it until it’s swollen and wet and red. His knees fall out to the side. His hand slips down, out of your hair, brushing your cheek, your jaw. His thumb traces your bottom lip, attention rapt. You open and let the tip touch your tongue. He presses in, curling. You close and suck it deeper, letting your eyes flutter shut. He tastes of soap and skin.
The urge to reach over and lay his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder is overwhelming, but John stops himself. Sherlock wouldn’t appreciate it, he doesn't think. Even if the reason why they were heading down to Sussex was to go over the cottage that Sherlock’s mother had left to him in her will. Even if, six months ago, Sherlock had come home from the reading of the will and asked John if it would be all right—Sherlock still dressed in bespoke black wool, his curls finger-mussed and wild, his eyes distraught—would John like to retire to Sussex with him whenever that time should present itself? And when John had said yes—unthinking, reflexive, reckless,
John eases him out of his shirt and lets it drop to the floor behind him as he kneels and begins to untie Sherlock’s shoes.
The combination of intercontinental travel and the lack of a night’s sleep tug at John’s mind and body and he falls asleep easily.
But the sheer enormity of the task swamps him, paralyzing in its size and transformative force, and when the timer dings a few minutes later he gratefully loses himself in the pleasure of warm, flaky, buttery croissants slathered in the sweet, tangy, seed studded spread of thick blackberry jam. And when John gets up to put the coffee on to perk, to accompany his second croissant, there is Sherlock in the doorway, swaddled in John’s duvet, blinking sleepily at him, and he is a safe distance away from the weight of decisions and choices needed to be made, comfortably enmeshed in the present of here and now.
And because the man is a bonafide genius, Sherlock’s slides two fingers inside and presses down on that tiny bundle of nerves and John bucks and comes.
The two simple words land John back firmly in his skin. He knows how to do this. He is John fucking Watson and it is his job to command and be commanded by his lover in service to their pleasure.
He traced the bow of my upper lip as well with the plump velvety tip and then painted a wet line across my right cheek until I turned my head and caught him once more, taking him deep into my mouth until the fat round head was fitting itself into the back of my throat. I swallowed against him and the resulting moan, incoherent and desperate, was very close to good enough.
“I see what you’re saying, but I still think there’s something to ‘everything in moderation’. If you only ever chase pleasure, won’t it lose the very thing that makes it feel extraordinary?”
“God, it smells delicious in here,” John said, looking at the pile of pink shrimp and scrambled egg sitting in a bowl on the counter before leaning over the hob to peer into the pan.
When his thumbs reach the head, now fully exposed, fat and red and glistening, Sherlock moves them up and down, worrying at John’s frenulum, over and over.
I jumped a little at the deep rumble of his voice as it broke in on my thoughts. At this time of day his Scottish heritage comes out and he slightly burrs his r’s. It makes me shiver down to my toes every time. His eyes had not left the newsprint, but the corner of his mouth was twitching up. I wanted to kiss it.
Taking out his journal, Sherlock made notes about the state of his blackberry hives, and in the back of his mind he kept the questions close at hand. Tonight he would sit down with his fears and give them the floor. Maybe if he could figure out what was holding him back, he’d have an easier time seeing the way forward.
“The answer is no,” John says as he approaches, scrubbing the rest of the lipstick off his cheeks with both hands.
“You’re so quiet,” he murmurs when you tuck your nose into his neck and breathe in the scent of his aftershave. Woodsy and warm, it flushes through you, amber in your chest. “Am I dreaming you?”
Which is code for: addicts, the mentally ill, people of colour, queers, immigrants, sex workers, ex-cons.
The slow, fond smile that spreads across John’s face bursts something hot and sweet beneath Sherlock’s breastbone that melts down to pool in his belly. “Christ, you’re a joy.”
Sherlock’s mouth, wet and parted and sure, pushing itself against John’s. John opens with a small grateful sound, sucks sweetly on his lips, his tongue.
“I just want you to recognise the gravity of what you’re asking me to do. This, trusting you, letting you in, it goes against everything I know about humanity.”
He murmurs, “There’s no rush. We’ve got all night.” He’s trying to soothe you, but it’s not working because now you’re facing each other and with every second that ticks past you’re swaying closer and closer together. It’s too slow, this gentle swaying, this tantalising, torturous almost closeness where you can smell the curling tendrils of whiskey on his breath but you can’t taste them yet. Patience isn’t your strong suite, so you decide to encourage things along. Your knees bend and you lean back against the door for leverage, wrapping your hands around his waist and pulling him snugly between your legs. He doesn’t resist, but he doesn’t give you what you want either. There’re still a few infuriating centimetres of air keeping you apart. Head dipping lower in offering, in supplication, you watch the passing headlights of a car from the street side window sparkle across the tips of his lashes. One of his hands comes up between you to rest against your bare breastbone and you can feel the burning heat of his palm sink down through skin and bone to flush against the thunder boom of your heart.
But awake he is, and bent over at the waist, rummaging for something inside the fridge, in the teeniest,
Sherlock is coming from. Sherlock sits across his knees and drapes his arms around John’s shoulders. He leans down and rests his forehead against John’s and it’s so natural and right that it makes John’s throat hurt.
Sherlock gives him A Look and Lestrade, cheeks growing red, holds up his hands. “What? I’ve got a fifteen year old daughter at home.” He gestures at John. “What’s his excuse?”
"It's like anything else in this world, Sherlock. You have to put in the effort. That's literally all we're asking of you. To put in some effort here. Think of it like you would your bees if it's helpful. If you knew something was causing them harm, you'd research how to fix it, yeah? Do that."
Sherlock’s solar plexus constricts, punching the air from his lungs. He remembers, suddenly, that night...
Once home and with a few hours to spare until the school bus deposited Charlotte home, Sherlock had packed a lunch of leftover chicken and a bunch of green grapes and set off along the cliffside path at the back of his property. Sherlock liked how isolated and quiet it was. The beach wasn’t overrun with tourists in the summer, owing to the fact that it was difficult to access, down a perilous track cut into the cliff face, and at the end of the year it was fairly deserted, aside from the occasional local out walking their dog.
“I—“ but you’re not entirely sure what you wanted to say so you stop. Your knees buckle a little, bending to support yourself, your head falling forward as his left hand slides around your front to press itself to where your heart is thudding, thudding, thudding in the centre of your chest.
“Don’t think so, but I’m also not familiar with most of the things in this room so I reserve the right to change my mind.”
John sat up with a splash. I watched, warily, as his face underwent a series of thunderous progressions. He opened his mouth three times to speak, but stopped himself each time.
Sherlock finished chewing before answering. “I don’t know enough about it yet, but I gather that the naturalists believe we are creating more problems for the bees through our interventions than solutions.”
John looks at him sharply and finds Sherlock looking back at him defiantly, defensively. John takes a deep breath.
John rubs his fingers over his lips. He watches. Closely. John licks them after, slowly, for good measure. His eyes on John's mouth: hot. “Go on then. Convince me to take you on.”
John sees him start to retreat, start to pull away, but he holds Sherlock steady. “No, don’t take it that way. I’m not saying stop. I’m saying we play at a slower pace while I’m getting to know you. While I’m getting to know what you like, what you don’t like. How much you can take and what your boundaries are.” John takes Sherlock’s face between his hands and stares at him with the blue depths of the sea. “My goal is that you never need to use your safe word with me, Sherlock. I take my role very seriously, I want you to know that. I’ll be watching you carefully, but it will take me some time to be able to read you well, and for you to feel comfortable with me in return. So it’s extremely important to me that you use it if you need to and that you communicate to me if I do something that doesn’t feel good or right. I need to know you’ll tell me if I go too far and we can do that by starting out slow. Does that make sense?”
“What do you mean, like electrocution?!” John exclaims, sitting bolt upright in the chair. Sherlock holds onto his feet, holds him steady.
Sherlock straightens after he has this affirmative from John, his shoulders settling into a relaxed line.
“Well, Taylor would like to be, but their wife isn't on board yet, so they compromise with an open relationship.”
So for now he sits in the meetings and makes friendly. This last one before lunch is on the future of med tech and where the company plans to strike ground next. The woman at the front of the room is explaining how Watson Tech fits into their plans. It is all polished, all glossy, all front. Much like Irene herself. Beside him Sherlock is silent, pale, closed off. John doesn't take the amount of courage it had to take for Sherlock to reveal all of that to John lightly. John knows that that level of vulnerability can leave one feeling shaken, especially if it's something they're ashamed about, which Sherlock obviously is.
Gets his elbows underneath him and lifts them just high enough for his cock to slip out from between John’s thighs and hang, heavy and flushed, over the top of John’s lap.
“Oh!” John exclaims, sucking in a short breath as Sherlock drags his hand slowly down the outside of John’s arm.
Sherlock went upstairs after John left and took a shower. Then he laid down on the sofa in the sitting room, intending to take a short nap, and woke up eight hours later.
“Ok. I see that we have you scheduled for next week. Is there anything I can do to support you until then?”
Hot lush skin opens around him as he licks. John’s body flowing down onto Sherlock’s tongue, opening, splitting, plum pink folds swelling with the beat of blood, as Sherlock pushes the tip inside.
The walk took perhaps a half hour. As I crossed over the Prince Albert Road, the London Zoo dark and quiet on my right, my steps quickened, my heart racing in my chest. It began to rain lightly as I walked, collecting in yellow puddles at the base of the lampposts.
John makes a deep, growling noise in the back of his throat and pushes up onto his hands over Sherlock, looking down between them.
Charlie shifted, pulling away from her father and peering around Sherlock’s side, towards the honey shed.
Sherlock, as if sensing John’s desperation, relents and John gets his hands underneath him. Elbows wobbly as he pushes up to kneeling. And, slowly, slowly lowers himself until Sherlock’s face is buried between John’s cheeks.
.” He reaches down to cup John’s face, thumbing across his erection through John’s cheeks. John tightens his hand and pumps Sherlock in time with his mouth. “Ch-christ. I’m going to come soon. I’m going to come, John. If you don’t want me to—“
, follows on its heels as Sherlock bites his lip to keep from shouting at the sizzling, scorching bolts that strike up his spine each time he tightens around the unyielding thickness inside him. John’s hand opens and closes around the nape of Sherlock’s neck, kneading the tight muscle as Sherlock struggles to control himself.
While his tea steeps John peruses the selection of cookbooks that fill the kitchen’s built-in shelves and which had been retired from the library for imperfections or to make room for new releases. Over the years at The Bede John has used his insomnia to teach himself how to cook from the books on the shelves. He picks a recipe each week, buys the ingredients, and if he can’t sleep—which is still more often than not—he makes a few batches until he feels he has the recipe mastered. Last week was Delia Smith’s apple Charlotte while the croissants had been a result of epic fail after epic fail last month until one time it had magically worked out. He had frozen the other half of the batch to enjoy later, drawing out the miracle a little longer. His co-workers, who benefited from John bringing his creations to the library to share, called it The Insomniac’s Cookery School.
He scooted closer to me until our knees were touching and he could cup my face. Sometimes the blue of his eyes is unbearable. It makes my heart do funny things.
“No, I think not,” I manage, somehow, to say, as his sprightly fingers make short work of the buttons on my jeans.
When he pulls away Sherlock’s skin is shiny and soaked and flushed with blood. He watches as Sherlock’s swollen rim pulses slightly and John reaches out to touch it. Sherlock jerks forward, as if electrified, and John puts a steadying hand on his lower back. “All right?”
Sherlock collapses against John, his arm heavy around John’s waist, his nose tucked in against John’s neck.
And just then, just as Sherlock’s cheeks throb and swell and his mind begins to race concocting some lie to tell John about how he wants nothing more than to be a CFO of some Fortune 500 company, he is saved by the crackle of the intercom and Nora telling them to buckle their seat belts and prepare for take off.
Our duvet puddled around his waist, his broad chest bared to the pearl silk light spilling in through our windows. Outside, the grass was tipped in sterling. The frost would crackle beneath my boots if I were to walk the downs, as I was sometimes in the habit of doing if I could not seem to quiet my mind and needed some other distraction so that I don’t, for instance, snipe at the man sitting so innocently beside me in bed.
“Oh?” Sherlock says, affecting indifference, but his chin goes wobbly and his lips are twitching a bit so it’s mostly ruined.
John goes out and shrugs his coat on. Stands for a moment on the landing patting at pockets. Sherlock stands and drifts toward him, the belt of his robe coming untied as he walks forward.
His thighs are warm as they settle across your lap, his weight sinking down into you, arms looped around your neck. He smells so good, so familiar, it makes your throat ache; you bury your face in him.
“—really should know better than to start with a dildo of that size. You’re lucky you didn’t tear anything.” A pause. “You didn’t did you?”
John thinks of the night it all started. When Sherlock was climbing the walls. The night Sherlock had been begging for a blow job, going out of his head. John had said no then, hadn’t he?
He wriggles closer and squeezes your hand. “Mm,” he hums, as if this is old news to him, which, perhaps, it is. You still feel it settle warmly in your chest, the light inside you glowing whiskey gold and radiant when he says, a moment later, “I love you too.”
“Actually I’m meeting with a beekeeper from the Association next week to discuss a different way of keeping bees. I planned on talking to you and Zoe afterwards, to see if I might use my old plot to experiment.”
Sherlock keeps looking down at him and, seeing the remnants of his tears in his wet lashes, John feels a stab of regret and worry and sadness. John keeps his tone nonjudgmental. “Was that how it was? Before? It’s all right if it was. Do you want to be talked to like that?”
You gather the disparate parts of him in your hands and shape him, give him form with your touch. You ground him there with you.
, you nearly burst from the feeling that floods through you. You’re not entirely sure anyone has ever looked at you that way before. Your chest is washed in warmth and it’s
not wrong, Sherlock. It just...it is what it is. We’ll get through it. We always do. What would help?” he asks, winding his arms around him. Sherlock bends down and rests his forehead against John’s.
“For me or for Toby?” I heard Toby shift on his dog bed in the corner, attuned to the sound of his name.
Sherlock blinked, wanting Evan to go away, wanting John to say whatever he had been about to say, wanting John to keep his hand on his arm.
, this chipper in the morning. I think I’d know if you were drunk…ah.” It came out slightly breathless at the end and his hand tightened ever so gently at the nape of my neck, exerting the merest of pressures, urging me down. I pushed the lip of the duvet aside as I happily complied, nuzzling the tip of my nose down into the wiry honey colored curls. He spread his legs wider for me as I pushed myself up and over until I was settled between his bent knees braced on my elbows, the newspaper slipping off his lap and landing on the floor with a quiet rustle.
He bows backward and stills, his cock pulsing, striping his chest and belly with ropes of pearlescent come. The sound that is ripped from him is unreal, a feral, animal cry.
“Harold fucking Stackhurst.” John growled under his breath, having the presence of mind to do up my buttons before he began to put himself to rights.
Sherlock wakes to the somnolent blue hush of a summer storm. The hotel room is quiet but for the sough of rain against the window glass, the room dark around him.
The bar is dark, lit by black light, the dance floor a kaleidoscope blur of bright colours, bodies and faces painted in neon UV paint, white shirts writhing eerily, and teeth flashing like a strobe light as people sing and smile while they dance.
Reality couldn’t be further from what John had imagined. A Christmas tree, a fire, sweets that remind John of his childhood, a bed laid out before the fire.
How you would have met in the bar downstairs, how your eyes would have met with that same shocking sizzle? There is no way you could have waited, could have sat through drinks and small talk. You would have grabbed his hand and pulled him into the corridor and kissed him up against the mosaic wall. How you would have stumbled down the street, weaving through the crowds on the boulevard out for dinner in the fragrant springtime air, to your hotel room? To this bed?
“I probably should have mentioned that I have insomnia, sorry about that,” John says sheepishly. “I haven’t had to worry about it disturbing anyone for a while. My old flatmate had an air purifier which created enough white noise to cancel out the sound of my dead of night activities.”
Thumbs stroking over John’s cheeks, slipping in the moisture there, spreading it out, until the salt dries tight on John’s skin.
His big hands cupping John’s neck, palms flushed with heat, the band, a cool, hard line against the nape of John’s neck.
“What were you looking at so intensely, hmm?” he murmured, continuing to stroke me. Continuing to send frissons of pleasure down my spine. Continuing to placidly read his article as if he weren’t beginning a very different sort of activity altogether with his sure, electrifying touches.
“Get up,” John says, controlling his voice as much as he can. Sherlock obeys him, standing on weak knees. There are deep red impressions in his skin and they make John senseless with rage. He slings Sherlock, pillowed in soft white down, into his arms and carries him into the bedroom where he lays the boy down carefully.
At the end of the hallway he opens the nondescript door to the right of the men’s loo. He steps inside and after a split second spent deciding whether or not to turn on the light (not), Sherlock has joined him.
“I was a right idiot,” John says, shaking his head at the memory. “I was so nervous. I was standing there and a bloke came up and started chatting with me about drumming, asking me all these questions and I was just arsing my way through it, claiming I was in a band and all this utter, utter shite. Just, just trying to get away as quick as I could. I grabbed the first pair I could find and then went to go pay.”
John wakes to the hard slosh of the rain against the glass, the trees outside thrashing in the wind, branches scratching against the sash. His first thought is for the poor duvet, which they hadn’t yet rescued from the elements. The second is the recognition of the hour, maybe 2am, maybe 3, and the ardent wish that he could master the blasted insomnia and fall back asleep. He burrows deeper into the cocoon of the duvet, Sherlock’s body warm and close beneath the covers. John breathes him in and shifts forward on his pillow until his nose is mere centimeters from Sherlock’s bare shoulder.
“Call me naive. Call me a martyr, a fool, insane. Call me whatever you like, Sherlock. I will not change my mind.”
On the cab ride home all he could think of was his boyhood home. He remembers the terrible loneliness. The prickling, livid, seething silence that existed between his parents. An ambivalence broken by fits of fury and broken crockery and the cutting slice of words whet on decades of hate and resentment. Harry and him, bred on it. Boiled into their blood, hardwired in their brains. It was in their bones. The quick fire temper. The inability to communicate. The impulse to repress, restrain, ignore, pretend. Him and Harry, two fists, clenched. Poverty and alcoholism and religion; a bad pick-mix. They didn’t invite friends home. Too embarrassed. Too afraid of everyone finding out. They waited. Waited for the day they could leave it behind.
“You don’t control me, Sherlock. And I don’t control you. This is your decision to make as well as mine.”
“—is that he needs to be more careful.” Ellen slid a sideways glance at her wife before looking back at Sherlock. “This one used to work in a care home, you know. It’s a sensitive subject.”
John imagines Sherlock snort-laughing at that, even though it wasn’t much of a joke, and his smile tugs wider into a proper grin.
“Right, now that’s sorted, I’m off to bed. I’ve had too much wine, and as lovely as you lot are, I’m knackered.” Zoe rose and proceeded to go about the room hugging everyone goodbye.
Pushing back his chair from the table John walks slowly into the shaft of hot buttery sunlight that cuts in. For a moment he just admires Sherlock’s form. The long clean lines of his body, rigid, muscles straining against bespoke clothing that has been tailored to fit Sherlock like a glove. His inky black curls shine in the bright light, sunbeams coiling through the dark strands like liquid gold, his fingers tense against the glass, pads digging in.
“I keep telling her to make an appointment with the doctor. She’s been getting them more regularly lately. But you know Ellen,” Zoe finished with a sigh. Sherlock nodded. He did know Ellen and she was stubborn and self-sufficient as they came. “Anyway, can I help with anything? Hayley’s already driven to school.”
“I received the deed in the mail today,” Sherlock adds a moment later, sounding for all the world as if he is bored, but John can hear the way Sherlock’s voice breaks a bit on the word ‘deed’.
Especially with kiss-bruised lips and his hair a marauded mess and his eyes lust-black and positively ravening.
Harry smells the same, John thinks, as his sister yanks him inside off the stoop and pulls him into a hug.
Sherlock nods, a half smile playing on his lips, as he bends. His curls brush softly against John’s forehead and cheeks as Sherlock gives him a quick peck on the mouth.
“You know, your powers of recollection really are dazzling. Truly. Now please if you will be so kind, shut up and come back down here.”
He is almost on the verge of falling asleep when he feels Sherlock moving, the bed dipping a bit as he shifts beside John.
John, smiling, examining a fork under the light, “Maybe we should ask Mrs. Hudson for her icing recipe.”
You can feel it now, that same frantic energy filling you up to overflowing. You don’t want it soft. You don’t want it gentle. You want him to take you.
, if I hurt you or pushed you past your limit. You have to tell me. I can’t read minds like you can. You have to. Promise me.”
“When we first began our relationship it was on very different terms.” John swallows against the flood of emotion that this statement triggers. “I understand that the type of connection men seek from the club is typically established based on certain criteria, one of them being the wealth and social position of the dons.”
“Don’t you want to be inside me? I’m so open and wet for you.” John guides Sherlock’s cock down to where Sherlock’s fingers are stretching him open. John contracts his muscles again, squeezing. Squeezing.
John squeezes his hand around Sherlock’s warm skin and nuzzles their noses together. “Oh, lovely boy, thank you. I see now, how it was confusing to you. I wasn’t as clear as I thought. I’m sorry.”
His index finger, blunt, lightly calloused, the rough whorls and ridges imprinting on my slapped and smarting skin, tipped my chin up.
As John makes the drive across town to the 24 hour Tesco he thinks about the kind of indulgence Sherlock is suggesting and sits with the way he cringes at the suggestion that he implement the same philosophy into his own life. His knee jerk instinct is to dismiss it. No, not only to dismiss it, but to denigrate it as something not to be taken seriously. Wasn’t it just Sherlock’s addiction talking? Trying to justify itself? Wasn’t it just Sherlock in denial that he had a problem?
I asked for some reader feedback over on Tumblr surrounding whether or not people cared that I don't have the time to devote to really making this as tight plot and editing wise as I would normally. Most people said it was fine to just post what I have as I go. I intend to clean it up later, but for now it's mainly just going to be porn because I just can't seem to get this story out of my head. Have a prompt for me? Something you'd like these two to get up to? I'd always love to hear your head canons and who knows? It might spark something! Let me know in comments or on Tumblr. Thanks for reading and, as always, comments are much appreciated <3 <3 <3
He shifted around until he was looking at me, resting his chin in the center of my chest. “You will get bored of this in minutes,” he said, knowingly.
“Should I untie you? You’re crying rather hard and starting to worry me a little,” Sherlock says, pulling back far enough to look down at John.
Sherlock nods as if this makes sense, and then ruins it with a smirk. “But you ended up helping anyway so…”
“I’d do a lot. For you. But this. This is a hard no for me and I feel like if I get down there with you…”
“You know you didn’t actually answer my question,” John says, as Sherlock kisses him again and again.
“And I don’t measure your worth by the amount in your bank account. You are still everything to me that you were when we first negotiated our way into this. I know you will find yourself again. I’ll wait until then. John, I will always be yours.”
You feel melted. Liquid, you mold yourself against him. The top sheet whispers down your calves as his knee fits itself between your legs. He buries his face in your neck and holds you. You know exactly what he’s going to say before he says it.
“Ok, sure, fine,” Sherlock finally says, though it looks as if he has a sour taste in his mouth. “Best get on with the training then.”
John dips his chip into the translucent vinegar which pools, viscous and oily, on the wax paper beside his strips of freshly fried cod.
“Do you want me to order a takeaway?” Sherlock sounds completely at sea and it makes John smile into his pillow.
You squirm in his lap, restless, swivelling your hips with him buried so deeply inside you, searching for that spot that promises relief.
It lands in a puddle around his bent elbows as you trace your lips across his shoulders and into the hair that grows in a V at the nape of his neck.
He feels full, it's strange. But, at the same time, he feels safe. Loved. Held together by Sherlock's hands.
“Please. Do it.” Hand fisted in his fringe, down on his forearms. He slides his knees wider, as wide as they will go on the seat, back bowed, presenting himself. He has no idea what he’s saying anymore. “Put it in. Just fuck me. I want you to. I want you to. Fuck me. Please.”
John looks to Sherlock for an explanation just as Sherlock surges forward, crushing his mouth to John’s.
Sherlock looks at him in that nonplussed manner once more, as if he cannot fathom what John is saying, before he dives forward, pushing John back to sit on the ground with Sherlock perched over his lap, kissing John with a ferocity that makes John’s knees weak. Makes his spine melt. Makes his blood pound up in an answering roar.
?” I looked up at the waiter and could only blink dumbly back at him. My mouth worked soundlessly, my brain fogged, my body thrumming.
This was the British equivalent of losing one’s honor. He would be expected to fall on his sword when he was done.
“I need to—“ broken off, breathless. A quiet moan, his teeth on the nape of your neck. His left hand on your belly, steadying. “Christ. I need—“
John can smell him. Spice and soap and the slightly metallic scent of rain underneath. John slides his hand up Sherlock’s chest to curl around the back of Sherlock’s neck, his fingers threading themselves in the hair curling at his nape, still damp from the storm.
And so once Sherlock nods at him, ok, relaxing his hold on John’s shoulders, John grips Sherlock’s cock at the base, holds it right over his lips, and says, “Squeeze.”
“My parents stayed married, but they weren’t in love. Not by the time I came along at least. My mother resented us, resented my father, for the loss of her career. She tried to get it back once I was in school, but she had been away too long. My father and her existed in separate rooms. They did not show affection. With Mycroft and I, my mother was more of a teacher. She taught us to reason. The way to please her lay through our brains. Not our hearts. My father was absent at best. He carried on an affair with Mrs. Noor, a widower who lived down the road, for decades until she moved away to be with her grandchildren in New York. My mother, if she had lovers, was more discreet.”
“Would it be ok for me to share a little bit about why I made that decision or are you not looking for that from me during this process?”
“What do you want now?” John asks, rubbing his thumbs across the tops of Sherlock’s creamy white thighs.
“God yes,” John says, dipping the spoon into the carton where the ice cream has begun to melt and turn soupy in consistency. John drizzles some over Sherlock’s left buttock and then leans forward.
He fills the kettle, his thoughts wandering. A cuppa, a book, a bath, and then bed. And hopefully, whenever Sherlock returns home from wherever he’s buggered off to, he’ll have worked the manic energy off.
Straddles Sherlock’s lap and pushes him back until he’s lying on top of John’s old duvet with John on top of him. With a bit of clumsy manoeuvring they get the other duvet pulled over them both. John threads his arms under Sherlock’s shoulders, his face tucked into the velvet folds of Sherlock’s neck as Sherlock’s fingertips knead at the tight muscles of John’s back.
It was the puppy’s owner. A beautiful Moroccan woman in a peacock blue hijab and her son, who it was clear had been crying, were plied with tea and biscuits (Of which I devoured five. John pretended not to be pleased) and the tale was told. The puppy had slipped out of his collar on his first walk in the park and run off. John, who had printed out a hundred notices that he had intended to hang up in the park tomorrow, had also put up an announcement on our website saying that we had found a puppy and a friend had seen it and called them.
“Oh, shut up you. Can’t you see that my little brother is in crisis? This is no time to be settling debts. Now, John. When the fuck did you two even get together? This seems rather a rushed job doesn’t it?”
John rubs his open palm over the raw, stinging skin of Sherlock’s cheeks, before resting it in the small of Sherlock's back. Steadying him for the fall of his hand.
“Their pictures are all over the papers. If you wanted to frame someone for murder they’d be a convenient mark wouldn’t they?”
John is left shaking, trembling, with his head hanging limp on his neck, eyes closed as Sherlock zips John back into his trousers, none the worse for wear, and rises to fetch a wet flannel for his face. He comes back over, and John leans into him, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s chest.
“No. It’s fine,” Sherlock says, and the deep rumble of his voice that fills the cab still sometimes takes John by surprise. It resonates in John’s chest, a faint echoing reverberation. John likes the way it makes him feel, the rock rough scrape of it along his senses, making him clench inside, making him aroused.
I was perfectly primed to do exactly that: worship him. My palms molded themselves to the soft curves of his arse, his thighs falling ever wider, and his eyes darkening, flooding with pupil.
He needed to note the strength of the fall bloom. The aster, the goldenrod, the witch hazel, the ivy. He needed to consult his journals of years past and compare. Statistics needed to be gathered, of rainfall, of pesticide schedules provided by local farmers, of the sickness and prosperity of the beekeeper’s association’s collective hives. He could note the tattered wings of a forager that had alighted on his sleeve last week. The fragile mullioned window panes of them, iridescent and torn and jagged around the edges. It was the sign of a bee who had toiled all summer to build up nectar and pollen stores and who would not survive the winter. She was at the end of her life, but had left her indelible mark on the colony, who would feast on honey produced from her labor through the long, cold months ahead. He could also note the way the fallen beech leaves made a gilded carpet around his hives and how he had gone out to rake them yesterday and had left them out of pure nonsensical whimsy just because he had liked the affect. The gold spread out below, gleaming against the green of the grass, the cerulean boxes burning brightly against the white trunks, and the silvered sky shining above.
In the sitting room, lesbians mingle. Some mill about the dining space near the bank of windows on the opposite side, some sit in front of the fire in the hearth, some perch on stools at the bar picking at the buffet. Some have small children colouring at the dining table and a teenager who sits in a corner bent over her phone. A few are downstairs at the door exchanging goodbye kisses with Clara. John is one of two men in the room. Laurence, the other, cossets a hiccuping newborn, softly cooing and patting, thoroughly engrossed, while his wife gathers food from the buffet. Conversation rises and falls as groups form and disperse. It’s a crowd John knows fairly well. A mix of lawyers and social workers and do-gooder-non-profit types. From law school and the wedding and various anniversaries and birthdays, John knows almost all of the women here. John sits in an armchair next to the fire and sips at his warm, spiced apple juice, watching.
Sherlock had thirty hives in total, spread across the town. Today he would drive out to Cloversweet Hill, Ellen and Zoe Edicott’s farm, and visit the hives he kept there. He would have to check his journal beforehand, but he knew off the top of his head that three of the ten hives needed fresh base boards, one a new telescoping cover, and one or two were in need of sugar syrup supplementing. He would also need to check the hives for mite levels and, if necessary, treat them all with a dose of thymol. Sherlock also made a mental note to bring a case of honey with him, part of the rent he paid to keep his bees on the Edicott’s property and for the use of their farm’s name on his honey bottles. Sherlock liked Ellen and Zoe more than most other humans. Ellen was a tall red-headed woman with an even temperament and a level head. She was also teaching herself to play chess, which was a mark of fine character and intelligence in Sherlock’s book. Zoe was much like her wife, quiet and calm, but shorter, with a head of close-cropped chestnut curls, a dry sense of humour, and a big infectious laugh. She was the mechanic in the family and Sherlock often consulted her help on engineering matters. Their teenage daughter, Hayley, helped Sherlock with the honey harvest during the summer and had made him grudgingly adjust his assessment of teenagers as a lazy vapid lot, by being a bright, responsible young woman who did not balk at hard work.
, kiss to the underside of John’s crown, makes John gasp. His muscles clench, toes and fingers digging into the sheets.
That leaves three more. Sherlock can do it. The one in his mouth is close, he can tell. It’s leaking copiously down his throat now and he drinks it down, bobbing as far as he can go to feel the stretch of his lips and the burn in his lungs. His eyes water as he chokes himself on it, but it’s worth it when he meets John’s eyes.
I did. I held out my hand to you, there in the garage, and you did just as you said, filled my palm with a pool of your spit and my fist was tight and slick around my dick and I groaned, and groaned for you. For the wet of your mouth on my cock and your words in my ears. Erasing Calum and penciling yourself into my past. Rewriting my memories. Rewiring my neural pathways. Leaving only you, you, you.
John turns his head and catches Sherlock’s mouth, distracting him. Soon both of Sherlock’s hands are in John’s hair, mussing it wildly as John sucks on his lips until they’re swollen and red as cherries. It gives John enough time to get his belt undone and his trousers opened. The head of his cock is just peeking out the top of his waistband, shiny and round. He feels hard enough to pound nails, but he slows his breathing. Patience is a skill he’s cultivated over many years of topping. The drawing out of sensation is an art all it’s own. As much as John loves giving pleasure, it always heightens things when his boy wants to reciprocate. It makes John light headed, the way Sherlock looks down at him, like his mouth is watering.
“Thought it might be a bit easier this way. You can let us know when it’s a good day to come by and meet the bees. And then you won't have Watsons showing up on your doorstep unannounced, at all hours.”
John huffs a laugh and puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders, pushing him up to kneeling once more. “Go wash up and take off your clothes. I’ll meet you in bed in five minutes.”
John nudges down, over the sharp curve of his cheek to skate a kiss down Sherlock’s throat. His pulse thuds hard beneath John’s fingertips as John tips his chin back down.
John kisses him. Runs his wet, grateful mouth over Sherlock’s and tastes salt from two tracks of tears that have cut down Sherlock’s cheeks and run into the corner of his mouth. John kisses them away, pressing his lips to Sherlock’s cheeks and eyes and nose before letting him lie down once more.
The affection with which John speaks has a visible impact on Sherlock, who practically glows after the affirmation.
Sherlock buries his face in John’s neck and wraps his arms around him, not wanting him to see whatever flummoxed expression he is wearing at the moment.
“Oh, um, your finger,” John said, and Sherlock stopped, looking out at him through the crack. “Keep it clean. You can remove the plaster and put a new one on tomorrow. It’ll be more of a nuisance than anything; until the nail grows back.”
It was lovely and sweet and hot and perfect and John’s getting hard again just thinking about Sherlock’s slippery crack and how his arse had felt squeezed around his cock, but what if Sherlock doesn’t feel the same way?
A small sizzling jolt runs down Sherlock’s body at the command and he complies quickly, climbing up onto the bed and arranging himself just how John wants him.
“She’d really like that,” John said, smiling again in that uneven way, one half of his mouth tugged up, then paused.
John’s jumper is next, tugged off and over his head, setting his hair on end as the wool crackles statically. Sherlock’s fingers work down John’s chest, laying the placket of his button-down open so that he can slide his broad palms over John’s vest, flushing it against his pectorals and clavicles, up to John’s shoulders, where he urges the shirt down John’s arms.
“I am going to kiss you now because if I don’t we will spend another decade dancing around each other and I don’t particularly fancy that. Do you?”
embarrassed of his halitosis, the slightly saccharine scent of peppermint clinging to him, his breath, his fingertips, and the clatter of them against the metal tin as he shook them in his pocket when he was lost in thought. His inability to fully comprehend Sherlock and his infuriating, tenacious determination to imagine Sherlock a better man than he actually was. Up until the very last.
“I have to go. You will wait for me at the hotel. I’ll be there soon.” John’s voice is thick, some emotion he can’t readily name cinching his throat.
No, you don’t want to fit into the mundanity of their ordinary Thursdays. You’d much rather lurk about the fraying edges of crime scenes and taste the cinder ash of chaos melting on your tongue. You’d much rather annoy that sergeant who calls you freak, all while her partner, the DI, a chain-smoker with a chronically cheating wife, takes you seriously and treats you to Chinese when you’ve helped solve a case. You’d much rather glean livers from the girl in the morgue who’s almost as strange as you and manipulate them to your heart’s content in the privacy of your kitchen. You’d much rather spend your days in the chem labs at the University of London, finishing your dissertation so that you can finally have the bloody degree in hand and your git brother will shut up about your potential. (You owe him that much as least, considering how much he paid for rehab)
John shakes his head like that’s not what he meant and his brows bunch, his gaze falling back to where he’s stroking your scars.
As John drags his electric, neon purple, spitting, sparkling, spark-plug tongue over every inch of Sherlock’s trembling dissintegrating body.
They lie in bed. John on Sherlock’s side, pillow propped against the footrest. Sherlock on John’s side, nearest the door, pillow tucked at the base of the headboard. Between them, on the mattress, lie a bottle of lube with a pump top, the slim pink vibrator of now notorious auto-fellacio fame, for Sherlock, and a stainless steel plug, for John. Next to the bed stands Sherlock’s hardback chair, a long, thick, black dildo attached to the seat with a suction cup.
“Well,” John says, wiping his eyes. “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to match it, but we can certainly try. Fruits are common. Or how about an animal? I had a bloke who chose Dachshund once. He liked how German it sounded. What’s an equally odd one…I dunno, penguin?”
“He…I love him. And he’s been honest with me about his recovery. But, I feel like if I make a wrong step, or, don’t give him what he needs, or if he gets bored with me, if I’m not enough, then he’ll, then he’ll,” John sucks shallowly at the air. The weight of it crashing down on him at once.
“Hello, Blue, how’s it going?” she said, calling him by the moniker he’d earned from his signature blue hives. It had been coined by Zoe herself, a woman given to nicknaming everyone in an affectionate, teasing way that somehow encouraged the person who’d received it to wear it with pride. The bright autumn sunlight caught in her curls and forged them a deep mahogany with red and silver streaked throughout. She was dressed in an oversized green checked flannel shirt and jeans. Her sleeves were rolled up to reveal powerful forearms and there was a dark wet splotch near her stomach. Sherlock wondered if she had been milking the goats not long before he’d arrived.
Sherlock brings his knees up and presses them into John’s hips, his big hands moving over John’s back, fingers scratching through the short hairs at the nape of John’s neck as John moves once more to kiss Sherlock’s mouth, this time licking inside. Sherlock’s cock leaves a sticky mark on John’s stomach as John lowers his hips down, fitting them flush against one another.
“The right time?!” Allison exclaims, shaking her head. “Men! As if we wouldn’t all be absolutely thrilled you two had finally stopped dancing about each other and finally got on with it! We are, you know, thrilled for you both. If you’ll allow it, Marta and I would love to put together a little shower or—”
The inside is butter and cream and dark wood paneling. The cool leather molds itself to him when he sits in the seat across from John, the carpet plush beneath his shoes. Over John’s shoulder he glimpses the door to a room with a bed. A bathroom is tucked into a corner across a narrow hallway. As Sherlock gets his bearings, a red haired woman with a name tag that reads Nora serves them still water with ice.
And I am just beginning to believe that I could possibly, somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, be of the same incomparable value to him.
. Heading out into the unthinkable with no one to cherish him. No one to keep the memory of him. No one to make him feel loved.
The vibrator thuds inside him, a heart heavy beat. It feels like the squeeze of a muscle in torque, a force building behind a dam.
“It’s not ok.” John holds up his hands to prevent Ella from responding. “I know you’re going to tell me it’s normal. That it’s…just thoughts. But I feel sick. I feel wrong. He doesn’t feel things like that. He doesn’t want things like that. I shouldn’t…”
The door swings open to reveal a tall, thin, Asian person of indeterminate gender, dressed in a neon blue houndstooth suit, tailored within an inch of it’s life, and practically painted on their body, electric fuschia brogues on their feet.
Will he tell her how he avoided you, never answering your letters, your calls? How he told you to forget about him? Of the nightmares and the tremor and the phantom pain in his leg and the way he felt himself useless, untethered?
“We really, really can’t,” John says, and steps back, steps away, closing up the placket of his jeans and putting space between them. “No,” John says, when Sherlock takes a staggering step towards him. “Sit down.” He points to the old slipcovered sofa that runs beneath the bank of windows.
“That’s not it.” John’s voice wavers just a bit and he hates himself for it. Hates this weakness. This jangling unsteadiness. “I…I’ve discovered something new about myself this past week.”
Forces the moans from his mouth with each shattering smack of their thighs. Sweeps up the beads of come from his throbbing hot cock.
“Good evening,” she said, unmoving. Her head was shaved and her eyes, thickly lashed, were large and dark in her face.
Because sometimes, on passingly few occasions, life surprises you with a modicum of grace instead of running you over and leaving you for dead, Sherlock starts laughing.
“Open the door, Sherlock,” John says, and feels gratified when Sherlock has to visibly gather his wits about him in order to obey.
“I found this piece of paper in your bedroom on the day I left Baker Street. It was a list. Must have been from the first month I moved in. Do you remember it?”
The words burst out and John can’t be sure where exactly they come from but they feel like they’re torn up from somewhere deep. He thinks of roots, blanched and hairy, ugly, misshapen things that grow in the cold and dark earth. Buried. Secret. The words rasp in his throat. “He wouldn’t hurt himself. He would want to live.”
“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” Mycroft said eventually. He tried to clear the wobble, but it persisted. “It’s that I cannot lose you.”
John’s bollocks are tucked up inside as well and he can feel the dull thump of his heart beating against it.
John means to simply reach across him and open the door, but the heady green scent of Sherlock’s aftershave overwhelms John and he can’t resist sliding his other hand into the soft hair that curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck and tugging him down for a kiss.
He smiled with one half of his mouth, his eyes moving softly over Sherlock’s face, and Sherlock’s heart did an odd back flip inside his chest.
Waits until Sherlock can guide John’s face forward so that John can lick a stripe up the veins that stand out on the dorsal side of Sherlock’s thin, hard cock.
He’s grinning up at you when you’re finished and you can’t help it, you grin back, an ocean of feeling rising in your chest at an alarming rate. You dam it up as best you can, considering the faulty human heart that you’re working with.
It doesn’t take long for him to sort out Mrs. Patterson. With a quick scan of her library card he logs her name on the signup form for their
"Must have been a grand time. Explains the glitter in your fringe," Bobbi says, chucking her chin at his forehead, and John runs a hand through his hair, rifling it self-consciously. The glitter was proving a bitch to wash out.
John takes back his hand slowly, letting Sherlock suckle for just a moment, and then drags it through the hot bath water to detach the rice pellets that are clinging to his fingers. He leaves it there, tips just skimming the skin of the water, with Sherlock’s body laid out below it’s clear surface. The steam rises up and touches John’s cheeks, licking wet and warm against his beard. It makes his hair damp and heavy at its roots and he scratches at it absently.
Just a quick note: I am about to enter a Masters of Social Work program, and as if that wasn't a big enough change and challenge, I am also at the beginning of a divorce and moving out of my house. Updates will therefore be sporadic at best. I appreciate your understanding. And, as always, thank you for being here and supporting this story. It has been such a meaningful experience to connect and interact with all of you in the comments. You're the best <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
“Because as a recovering habitual cocaine user, I am at risk of all kinds of heart conditions. And I knew you would be aware of this and want reassurance that my heart was sound.”
Upstairs he stands just inside his room. Tears burn at the backs of his eyes. John sniffs and blinks them away.
“I surrender, sir,” he whispers, winding his fingers up into John’s hair, as John kisses him deeply in response.
I looked up at him through my lashes, tucking my fingers into his pants, and he moaned softly as I tugged. He shifted, lifting the bowl, lifting his arse, as I worked them down and off.
There will definitely be an epilogue at some point, so if you would like to keep your subscription active you'll know when it posts. :)
“It’s fine,” John says, and strangely, despite feeling vaguely disconcerted by that last point, he means it.
Sherlock sat back down at the desk. It would feel better if he could pinpoint the cause so that he would know what to do differently going forward. He had combined a weak hive with a stronger one in August. This had required killing the queen in the weaker hive and setting the upper hive body on top of its neighbour separated by a sheet of newspaper. Every queen had her own unique chemical scent marker which set each colony apart. Over the course of a few days the bees would eat through the newsprint barrier and by that time the pheromone marker from the old queen would have faded enough for the bees to be accepted into the new hive and marked by their new queen's pheromone. He had also added honey from the old hive into the stronger one to help bolster their stores in preparation for the winter. This might have been where the trouble began. Although he hadn’t found evidence for foulbrood in the weaker hive, he had found evidence of robbing, bees from another hive plundering the honey stores, because the colony’s numbers had been too low to effectively defend their hive. Had the robber bees come from his own hives or from an outside source? Had they been Pollack’s bees? Or wild ones?
“Come here,” John croaks, remorseful. Once Sherlock has lain down next to him, tucked close against him, John kisses the pout of his lips. Sherlock’s hair is a mess. John puts his hands in it, lets the raw silk of it wind and tangle around his fingers. Sherlock pulls up the duvet and covers them. Their limbs slip against each other, leg hair scraping, stubble grating. The edges of John’s mouth spark and sting. Their erections, cupped in the space between their bellies, rub against each other, eager, needy.
Beads of sweat dripped down my spine beneath my vest. Dripped down your chest. My tongue longed for the wet salt taste of it.
John is watching him and Sherlock has never felt so in control. He wants to be used in every way possible by John. He wants to see how far he can go. He wants to test every limit he has.
Pleasure builds beneath Sherlock’s skin, a pressure cresting through him, to string him out tight beneath John and John feels it, feels the tension in Sherlock’s body as he begins to clench around the tentacle dripping lubricant inside him.
When Sherlock’s eyes met his briefly he could see that Sherlock expected it. He had flinched as if struck. He had looked away.
“Imagine me spread out across all that careful charting. Making a mess of it. Imagine my trousers pushed down around my thighs and my arse filling your hands as you pulled me apart and spread me open.”
“I’m sure it’s going to be wonderful,” John soothes, resisting the urge to move and adjust the way the toy is lying inside him.
Sherlock grappled with the wiggling black-and-gold piebald body as Quinn continued to lick him enthusiastically, her tongue managing to somehow enter almost every orifice on his face except for his eyes, which he kept squeezed shut against her attempts.
Sherlock stood for a moment with his eyes closed before the evidence, breathing. Rain rolled off the lip of his hood and onto his cheeks, mimicking tears.
“Don’t worry, love,” John reassures him, “the game is still on and I’ve got big plans for you yet. I’m going to take you home after this and I’m going to remove every stitch of your clothing. I’m going to lay you out on your bed Sherlock and I’m going to touch every beautiful inch of you. I’m going kiss you all over. I want to know everything about you. I want to know what noises you make when I rub your thighs. I want to know what sounds you make when I suck your nipples. I want to know what you feel like inside. I want to know exactly what you look like when you come apart. I’m going to take you apart tonight, Sherlock, and I’m going to do it so slow you’ll be begging me to end it and fuck you.”
“Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Sherlock you look so good with my cock in your mouth. Ffff—“ Incoherent, John closes his eyes and rocks just the tiniest bit forward. Sherlock, jaw relaxing, let’s him slide.
“I don’t think it is.” John takes another sip of water. “I would rather you spend your days pursuing your own interests. I’ll help you any way I can, with any resources I have. I know your parents were eager to see you settled in a stable job, but this doesn’t have to be it.”
He’s standing there, naked, hands loosely clasped behind his back, feet shoulder width apart, when John inserts his key inside the lock.
A rosy blush moves up his torso to burn brightly in his cheeks. His nipples draw up tight and dark and hard, and the pale hair on his chest stands on end. The look on his face is one of deep concentration and complete vulnerability at the same time. His brow knits together but his mouth goes slack, his eyes shut tight against the sight I present. He has told me in the past that if he watches me suck his cock he would be able to last all of two seconds. He claims I look utterly debauched while I’m at it, but it’s him who writhes like a tart, his hips stuttering up as he tries and fails to control himself from burying his cock as deep as it will go. He also keeps up a litany of absolutely filthy language muttered under his breath, which, when pressed later, he can remember nothing of.
Before John could offer the man tea or supper I complained of a migraine, held up Stackhurst’s jacket for him to slip on, and saw him out the back door and on his way.
John tucks his nose behind Sherlock’s ear and breathes them in. The fairy lights glisten in Sherlock's hair and the pine tree lends it's sweet-sharp scent to the cold charcoal smell coming from the grate. They forgot to close the flue the night before and John can feel the breeze tickling the hair on the top of his head. Goosebumps break out on his arms. John pulls the duvet up and folds it over Sherlock's shoulders.
"Mating between a single drone and the queen lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often completed within 1–2 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10–40 m above ground. Since the queen mates with 5–19 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must make the most of his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her. He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queen’s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates. The process of ejaculation is explosive—semen is blasted through the queen’s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a "popping" sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the endophallus is broken off inside of the queen during mating—so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover endophallus remaining in the queen’s vagina is referred to as the “mating sign”. The plug reflects ultraviolet light, and as drone bees can see ultraviolet the plug then works as a beacon to other drones [5]. The plug will not prevent the next drone from mating with the same queen, but may prevent semen from flowing out of the vagina.[6]"
Sherlock’s demand, his voice laced with desperation, fires an instinct in John and he does a quick check-in, his gaze scanning Sherlock for signs of distress.
“Dad! You have to come, you have to come right now. RIGHT. NOW. DAD. COME. ON.” It was Charlotte, out of breath and giddy. She brought the smell of hay and cold night air in with her as she ran to her father and grabbed his hand, pulling with all her might.
John has to smother a smile, Sherlock’s stunning intelligence and flustered confusion at once is adorable and John feels affection burst hot and sweet beneath his breastbone and melt down his navel. He wants to give this man everything.
By the time Sherlock slides the cock ring onto him he’s softened a little, the desperation gone. Replaced now by the pulsating cadence of his blood, thick in his ears.
Smoke did two things to calm and sedate the bees. Bees communicated with one another in two primary ways: “dancing”, a series of patterned movements, and smell. When guard bees believed the hive to be under threat they released pheromones warning the other bees that something was wrong. This pheromone was so strong that it could mark the beekeeper as he worked in other hives as well, singling him out as an intruder. Smoke masked this pheromone so that the alarm couldn’t be spread. Smoke also made the bees think that their hive was in danger of being destroyed by fire. In preparation to abandon their home the bees would eat as much honey as they could to sustain them until they could establish a new hive. Engorged, their bodies became too full to assume the position to sting and became lethargic, as someone after eating a large meal. It made it possible for him to open the bee hives and remove the frames without getting stung or marked as the enemy.
He and Sherlock duck across the car to sit along the seats facing down the mountain. Just as they settle the door clicks shut and the gondola begins to move and only then does John realize they’re not alone.
“Nothing. I just didn’t think CEOs walked with the rest of us plebeians.” The teasing glitter of his pale eyes shining at John from beneath his long dark lashes takes John’s breath away. Affection melts down his navel in a slow warm cascade.
You turn him on his back. When he starts to say, fists rubbing vigorously at his face, his voice garbled and thick, “I’m sorry—“ you shush him soundly.
His clear eyes. His rumpled hair. The streaks of rose painted across his cheekbones. The drag of his tongue over his bottom lip, wet. Red. His ribs, rising and falling with his breath. His belly slick with a cascade of black hair. His cock, sheathed and soft, on top of the heavy, dark weight of his bollocks and a wild thatch of ruddy curls. Nipples peaked and hard. His Adam’s apple rides as he swallows. His clavicles shift and settle. His long toes grip the tile.
“Just put some duct tape on it and we’ll see about replacing the latch,” Zoe called to him, out of breath, a few moments later as she fell into her seat behind the table.
The man raised his hand when he saw Sherlock had noticed him. “Hi,” he called out, speeding up his steps slightly to reach Sherlock.
Clara sighs. “Nothing you can do will ever be enough, John. You can only love them and try to help them, but it’s their decision in the end. You can’t force them, you can’t choose sobriety for them. They have to want it. Do you think Sherlock wants it?”
When they both come to a few minutes later John is dimly aware of a deep groaning sound emanating from somewhere close by.
You groan, far past the point of such practical, rational thought. But. It will buy you time, it will buy you some time to pull yourself together, stitch things up, stop the dissembling. “Yes. Tea.” You cover your face with your hands.
“You’ve made yourself a wonderful support system here,” Mycroft said, pausing in the door frame. “Many people who care for you showed up today to make sure you were ok." Mycroft's dark eyes studied Sherlock. "You’re healing something here, some wound our father tried to pass down to us. I can see it in you, something has shifted. I know it can’t be easy. For what it’s worth, I’m proud of you, Sherlock.”
Moriarty huffs a laugh, cocking his head. “Cute. Very cute. Adorable even.” He looks past John at Sherlock. “I can see why you keep him around. He’s like a guard dog. Dumb, but loyal.” His eyes flare suddenly and he lunges at John, barking. John flinches but doesn’t step back, the muzzle of the gun now pressed against Moriarty’s chest, making an indentation in the rose coloured silk of his tie.
John presses the tip of his finger just inside and watches, mesmerized as Sherlock’s body swallows him up.
“The house is called Blackthorn. It was my mother’s, left to her by my grand-mère. We summered there.”
As Sherlock twists and gets his knees beneath him the camera pans down and John’s cock fills the screen.
“I won’t talk about any new cases,” Sherlock said. “And I won’t talk about the last case I was on. Technique is all I’d be willing to discuss.”
“I know nothing. I can’t trust any of it now. At what point did it become about keeping me clean? Was it from the very beginning?”
Sherlock holds the dildo in his hand and pops off with a wet sound to say, with spit shiny swollen lips, “What you said earlier.”
. “Something fascinating no doubt. Something about…let me guess. Science? No. Ash?” He snaps his fingers, face animated with his teasing. “Oh, I’ve got it. The preservation of dung beetles under glass.”
“You’re amazing, you know that?” John murmurs, kissing Sherlock’s throat. “You’ve somehow managed the impossible. But I’m not even surprised because you’re brilliant. What do you want next?”
John hears the pipes groan in the walls a few minutes later. He picks up his book from where it had fallen beside him on the bed and finds the place he left off, inserting his bookmark, and setting it atop the stack on his bedside table. The clock reads 10:30. John wonders how long Sherlock had waited, searching for the bedding, before deciding to wake John up.
John reaches down and grasps Sherlock’s hand that cups John's hip. Knitting their fingers together, John anchors himself.
“Yes, you do,” Sherlock insists. “The day you moved in you were eating one, green I think, but it’s the yellow ones you’re partial to.” John listens, feeling the familiar feeling of awe he gets when Sherlock is deducing something about John that even John himself is not aware of, fuzzing his brain. “I’ve studied your patterns for years now, John. For instance, you really can’t stand the Red Delicious. And you absolutely detest the Fiji.”
, it was unparalleled in the history of Brittania. Possibly the world. Dare I say the universe? It was entirely within the realm of possibility.
I wanted to create a story who's central tenant was the feeling of being seen and loved and accepted and what that does for a person. I see and love and accept my daughter, but not everyone does. And I think that's at the core of the argument against Trump and his ilk: to recognise our base humanity and what connects us, not what divides us, and that everyone has a right to life and health and dignity and safety. To all of my transgender and gender non-conforming readers, my immigrant readers, my refugee readers, my people of color readers, my LGBTQIA+ readers, and to any readers who stand against bigotry and racism and hate and fear: I see you and you are valid and you are worthy and you are loved.
“She did,” Sherlock said, angry and taking it out on the wrong person. Clearly, since John had proven himself to be, thus far, a better father than Sherlock’s ever was, but still. It rankled. Got under his skin. “She asked me to call her Charlotte today. She said that was her name when she was a boy and that you still called her by it because of that.”
The universe had tilted in that moment. It turned out, that after all this time, John didn’t really know himself at all.
“Show me,” he says. “Show me how.” So you draw his mouth to your ear and he rakes his teeth over the edge, sending sizzling shocks of euphoria skating down your spine, and then, brilliant man, sucks the lobe between his lips. The sandpaper rasp of his breath overwhelms you.
“Easy,” John says, leaning back into Sherlock’s palm, resisting his tug. Sherlock lets his head fall back against the mattress, his hands opening and closing against John’s sides, restless. John leans down and kisses his throat, sucking gently in places, making Sherlock gasp.
Thumbing up the column of John’s neck. Kneading a bit into John’s stiff shoulder, avoiding his scar. John groans, pushing into the touch. It’s been sore all day, a constant nagging ache in the wet weather. Sherlock works at it for a bit before moving on.
Sherlock’s eyes are sharp when they swing back to pin John where he stands. His voice low and grating when he growls, “Get in the back.”
