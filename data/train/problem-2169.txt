“Say it,” John pleaded, his voice nearly urgent.
“Mhm?”
“He’s around here somewhere. He had called it in that you had escaped his attempts of immobilizing you, and then I saw your reflection in the glass door. Thought I play along with it, see how much the detective means to you.”
“I’ve got you, John. Come for me,” Sherlock panted.
Sherlock left without another word. Being alone seemed to help. John slowly took a deep breath, and held it in. His chest ached but he managed to hold it in. He exhaled slowly, and repeated. By the time Sherlock came back, John had gotten his breath back, and was lying down on his side, the blankets still tossed to the side. He glanced up and noticed Sherlock’s face was now only slightly pink, and his nose was lightly bruising. He looked away the second he started to feel sick to the stomach.
Lestrade gave him a nod, and then left. Sherlock turned to Mycroft. He cleared his throat and looked at the ground for a moment before looking at his brother, hardening his face.
“I’m not a hallucination.” He claimed calmly. John slowly looked up and his face began to relax.
Sherlock’s tumble came to a halt, and he lay still on his side, his arms and face already feeling irritated with scrapes. John’s voice entered his ears, and he opened his eyes, not realizing he had closed them.
*            *            *
“I thought you didn’t
Sherlock shook himself from thinking and focused on John. He decided to figure it out once John was more aware. Sherlock didn’t know what to do, but sit by him and comfort him; he had never felt this useless before in his life.
*            *            *
with this nightmare in my head.
Sherlock met his gaze, his eyes shadowing apologetically. “I, um, you were practically out of it for about four days. A lot has happened…”
“Come one John don’t do this…” Sherlock huffed out as he continued with compressions. The doctor stood on the other side of the bed and tried to gently take hold of Sherlock’s arms.
Rosie made a sound again, giggled, and said, “I—.”
Next chapter may be posted next weekend, by March 9th. I'm technically on chapter 10, but I need to do a lot of editing for it to make sense. If I get a lot of comments I'll give chapter 8 to you before then.
John flinched at the sudden rise in Sherlock’s voice and stepped back, clenching his jaw. It was familiar, it all too much. He covered his mouth; afraid that words he didn’t mean would slip out.
“Well, we could run some tests. It’s probably just the concussion, but based off the symptoms several months ago, it’s all right to be cautious. We’ll start with a CAT scan, and go from there. You don’t have any plans?”
Sherlock rubbed his face and slowly sat up. “That’s an accident—.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft immediately laid eyes on them and walked up to them. “Sherlock, John,” he greeted calmly. “There’s an ambulance if you want to get checked up.”
Sherlock sighed. “You always have
“I’m sorry for snapping,” John whispered. That was all that needed to be said, and after a few seconds, Sherlock nodded, and slowly looked at John.
Sherlock furrowed his brows. “I don’t know.”
“Oh not that again.” The detective sighed. “The heavy dullness of this unintelligible world is lightened simply by your presence in my life, even despite your naïve associations with romantic sentiments. You anchor me John, you guide me as a conductor of light, guardian and keeper of my heart.”
Sherlock leaned forward and buried his face between John’s neck and shoulder. They hugged for several hours, falling asleep in each other’s arms. When John awoke the next morning, he was relived that neither of them had moved apart during the night.
Sherlock stepped forward until he was nearly up into John’s space. “Ready to go?”
“Sherlock.”
“Always what?” Sherlock pried.
“Sherlock Watson-Holmes.”
Not much time passed though, when John noticed Rosie was losing interest in the bee, and nearly toppled over for a needed nap. John picked up his daughter and she lay against him, her eyes already closing. John picked up the bee, but on second thought, placed it back by Sherlock’s hand.
Relief flooded him and before he could stop himself, tears escaped his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. “Oh John…”
“So…friends?”
“I know. But you were drugged twice, one from the paracetamol and the second from the injection. You need rest, and food; maybe a good shag, if you behave. You’ll get a case tomorrow.”
“Because I need to do this alone.”
John nodded sadly. “My grandfather. I was just a kid but I saw what it did to my grandmother and my father.”
Sherlock. He wanted so much but this obstacle was holding him back, and he knew he was slipping further into the cracks. It was only a matter of time before he’d lose himself completely.
Sherlock sighed and leaned closer. He wrapped his arm around John’s midriff, and rested his face against John’s shoulder.
“You were shot,” Sherlock said flatly. John flinched, pulling tightly at the suture, causing Sherlock to flinch as well.
Sherlock immediately wrapped his arms around John’s back and helped him sit up. The shower was spraying directly on his neck, and it was still warm.
“And I can tell,” Victor continued. “That John is in love with you. But I don’t see it requited.”
“I mean: you can’t come in.”
“No,” Sherlock interrupted. “Do all of it but that. He doesn’t want that.”
Sherlock glanced down at the man and raised the gun. He held it as steady as he could, but his hand still shook minutely. He looked over his body, his face, but all he saw was John.
John exhaled with relief. “How are you feeling?”
*            *            *
“No, it won’t,” John agreed. “I made an appointment with Willoughby; it’ll be an hour, two at the most. He has a CAT scan there, and everything is set up. Just for me, please.” John looked at him intently.
“S-stop, p-please—,” John stuttered. Sherlock didn’t pull away.
Sherlock glanced into John’s eye and his throat tightened. John’s eyes were glistening, but no tears were falling.
They panted against each other as their orgasms slowly came to an end. John slowly released Sherlock’s back and resting his arms and legs back onto the mattress, going limp. Sherlock shuddered and pulled out. He reached for a cloth and wiped themselves down before climbing over John to his side of the bed and relaxing against the pillow. John turned to his side and snuggled against his chest; Sherlock pulled him closer, sighing contently and catching his breath.
“I think so.”
“You think you can get away, now? John struggled with him and restrained him with ease. The man huffed with defeat and winced as John held his hands behind his back. He pushed him forward, but the man had apparently caught his breath and twisted from John’s grasp.
“Who?”
After several minutes, he was against his pillows and staring up at Sherlock with an apologetic expression.
“Yes, well, thank you. And thank you, for…coming back.” John grinned at him warmly and shook his hand. Jack turned Sherlock and reached for his hand. Sherlock shook it quickly and then let go.
“He started crying when he woke up—panicking too I think. It could be a symptom, but it could also because he needs to be touched. He needs to feel someone and this drug is making him agitated. Now is there something else we can do?”
“What about others? They took the authors name and one fairytale; they may have taken others. What are some others?”
“What do you want to look at? Surveillance? Models?” Shillcott asked. Mary looked around the overly thematic room and whispered to Sherlock, “Why are we here?”
Dr. Bailey sighed, and then stiffly stood up. “I’ll visit tomorrow, to continue this. Take it easy.”
*            *            *
“Enough with the scoffing Sherlock. You’re not a child anymore so stop acting like one.” Mycroft said sternly.
“If he really is part of this, he’d might run off,” Mycroft suggested. Sherlock only nodded, stomping down the unexplainable doubt lurking in the back of his head—he was even ashamed at himself for having thought of them, so he focused on the computer screen, getting to work.
“Can I lead?”
Sherlock finally looked at him. John’s heart clenched at the sight of him; Sherlock’s eyes were soft and his lip was quivering—John could tell Sherlock wanted to say something, but he was just about to break. John leaned forward and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s, feeling him let out a shaky breath against his cheek.
“Do you have a pen?” Sherlock asked.
“Greg has a case. There was a murder by the Thames. Should take only an hour or so,” Sherlock mumbled with a hint of excitement. John grinned and nodded.
John blinked rapidly and briefly looked away.
Mycroft met his gaze steadily and then nodded.
Here it is, the moment you've all been waiting for (or at least I hope so). There's quite a bit of angst and bad language.
“John needs his rests. He’s been through a lot—.”
John cleared off the kitchen table, taking the pile of mail, and headed to the sitting room. Sherlock was at the table, drinking his tea, and staring into space. John set the pile beside him and reached for Sherlock’s empty cup.
Sherlock looked at his plate, but didn’t take a bite. John was staring at him, his own plate clean.
Sherlock opened his eyes immediately and turned to John. “Can you make the tea?” It was a question, but Sherlock didn’t wait for an answer; he walked past John and headed to the sofa where he flopped down, resting his arm over his eyes as if the lights were bothering him.
“Okay.” John left him to it, and hung around as he usually did. Sometimes he would look into the case, except this was still early and primarily depending on advanced chemistry, which was not his forte.
“It’s been a little more than two weeks since your incident. I’ll be having you transferred to a safe house.”
Sherlock sighed. “I don’t know.”
The man took the mask off, and Jack was there, looking at them.
For one thing, there was the kiss at the hospital. Was it a repressed desire of John’s, or was it just simply nothing?
The problem was that Sherlock didn’t know what he needed to do. He had to find Silken and Jacob, but he already had his homeless network looking and they had come up empty. Lestrade was looking as well, and it was no doubt Mycroft had kept an eye out. There was nothing though—no new overdoses, no whispers, nothing. Sherlock couldn’t seem to think straight—whenever he was in the hospital, he wanted to be working on the case—he had to solve it, for John. But whenever he was out, all he wanted was to be with John. So bringing the case files and notes seemed like the only option, except there weren’t any leads!
“Dinner at 7?” Victor spoke up, directing his gaze to Sherlock.
“No, thank you, I don’t think I’ll be here long.”
John’s brows furrowed slightly, and he leaned back. He ran his thumb down Sherlock’s check. “All right?” he murmured.
Sherlock knelt down and took John’s hands into his own; he could feel the tremors shake into his own palms. He squeezed them gently, urging some kind of relief into John. John didn’t pull away, although he was clearly ashamed and embarrassed. His expression was shifting between wanting the comfort and wanting to hide away—he was conflicted, Sherlock realized, and was just about to break down.
John left and cleaned the dishes, and then went back to the room to find Sherlock getting dress.
“Are you sure you’re all right?”
“You can’t stay here.”
“Sh’lock,” John slurred. His throat convulsed and he coughed roughly; he reached for the mask with a shaky hand and pulled it off his face. He licked his lips and closed his eyes for another moment, before focusing back onto Sherlock.
He slowly looked away from John and up at the ceiling. He then turned onto his side, pulling his legs to do the same, and directed his gaze to the couch, his back facing John.
Sherlock hummed in response.
John groaned. His back and legs hurt and he felt a pang of nausea. They had made it to the door, and Sherlock wanted to head to the nurse’s station just in front of them, but John only felt the dizziness worsen as he saw how far it was.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock…” John’s voice trailed off as it became harder to breathe. The pain in his leg increased and Sherlock only cuddled closer to him, and he was nearly lying on top of him, holding him still, and muttering incoherently. John’s heartbeat quickened and he couldn’t breathe deep enough. He could only feel panic and grasp Sherlock’s muttering, noticing the panic in his lover’s voice. Sherlock tried to pin his arms down, causing John to start hyperventilating. Memories flashed in front of him again: him, lying on his back, mostly darkness surrounding him with bits of light overhead in between the rubble; Sherlock looking down at him with fear, Sherlock reaching for a towel and placing it over John’s face, Sherlock’s hands holding his leg still, pain overwhelming John, and then sending him into complete and endless darkness…
Sherlock nodded stiffly, but his eyes remained close.
His residual limb was in so much pain, John had thought at first something was biting him—stinging too—burning—and—
“Can you tell me how this happened?” Vanessa asked firmly.
John hurried through the doors of New Scotland Yard, and sprinted up the stairs to the fifth floor. He hurried down the hall, ignoring the concerned and sympathetic stares, and walked into Lestrade’s office without knocking.
“C’mon John.”
John’s surgery had been a success and now it was just wait-and-see. The surgeon had managed to take the tumor out and yet there still was a chance the tumor could grow back. John was still unconscious and would be groggy for a day or two before he would be fully aware of his surroundings. Harry sat by his bedside, slight worry creasing her brow, and alone.
“No, I’ll wait for you,” Sherlock said. “It shouldn’t take you long to get through that hole. I’ll meet you up there.”
“How long, er, have I been…like this?” John asked softly.
John hummed and leaned upward, pressing his lips gently against Sherlock’s. Sherlock couldn’t resist and kissed him back, angling his head and parting his lips. John deepened the kiss with his tongue, and leaned back on his back, pulling Sherlock on top of him. Sherlock moaned and trailed his hands down John’s sides, finding his hands and pulling them for his head and pinning them against the pillow.
“Sherlock?” John pried gently.
There was that grin again. “Well, it’s true,” he mumbled. “But he wasn’t a very nice one.”
John didn’t reply. He stood up, his back hunched. He ran a hand through his hair—clearly he was anxious about something.
“I was hoping you could tell me.” John murmured. He crumpled forward but Sherlock and Mary caught him before he hit the ground. They led him gently to the sofa and settled him down. He was already having trouble keeping his eyes opened.
“His kidneys are starting to fail, which is a sign of septic. His lungs aren’t looking so good, and eventually, we’ll have to put him on a ventilator.”
“So what? An amateur tried making—.”
“You’re sure it’s him?”
Sherlock scoffed. “I would know if I was losing myself, John.”
Moran raised his eyebrows, his attention drawn to the earpiece again. “Well, well, well,” He said again. “Apparently
A couple of nurses followed him, but didn’t rush him to come back. They followed him closely; John ignored their presence and looked around, turning his head back and forth and then walking in circles, searching for Sherlock. But he wasn’t there anymore. He wasn’t anywhere.
John let out a choked gasp and urged himself to focus on something else. Sherlock was sleeping beside him, yet he was stirring and seemed to be waking up.
“We’ll keep an eye on it,” she said. “That’s all we can do, before we know what kind of infection he’s dealing with. We’ve given him some medication to keep the seizures at bay for now. I’m afraid that’s all we can do,” she repeated. The nurse finished her routine checkup, and then left with a reassuring smile.
Time ticked by, and it was fully dark and nearly midnight when John shifted awake. Sherlock had to leave for a couple of hours, and had come back in fresh plastic attire. He was standing by John’s left side, holding his hand.
The man stirred, taking control of his breathing and noting instantly that his throat was painfully dry. His head ached and he could feel tubes entering his body in various places. He could tell he was facing towards someone—probably Harry, who had been kindly holding his hand before he shifted away. He slowly opened his eyes and found himself with a blurred view of the consulting detective—the one who had jumped of off St. Bart’s less than a year ago—looking (was it worry?) back at him.
“We can’t laugh it’s a crime scene,” John protested with yet another laugh. He managed to control himself as he kept his pace with the detective. “So, where are we headed?”
John gasped. He could feel skin against his. It felt familiar…
John shook his head. “When he has a case, he’s never tired. Eventually he’ll crash and sleep for a day, but that is after, and it doesn’t affect his skills. I don’t know if it’s just this case, if I’m just seeing it everywhere.”
“I didn’t say it was. Nor did I say you have to stay. I’m only saying, it could be dangerous.”
John left the room and was quickly back, tea in hand. He set it on the bedside table and sat on the edge of the bed.
John had barged it, and after accessing the situation, quietly helped him back up, fortunately not saying a word. However Sherlock was fuming at himself and beyond embarrassed that he had shut himself in his room for a few hours after, ignoring John’s nonsense talk as he tried to comfort him from the other side of the door. Then his stomach growled for the umpteenth time, and he silently entered the hallway to find John still there, and was carried down the stairs, both of them not saying a word.
John cringed at the sound of his voice and leaned out of the hug. “It’s fine. Whatever it is, it’ll be on the blood test—.”
“Never, John—,”
“Just shut up Mycroft.”
Only one explanation as to why it sounded like Sherlock finally formed in John’s subconscious.
John nodded slowly. “And the fact that it wouldn’t have a key would be telling enough…and you opened the door just now. It can’t. Obviously.” He muttered the last word and bit his lip. “Are you still going to leave me here?”
“No!”
Go ahead, Sherlock
There was a faint knock on his door, and as it opened, John turned to face them, his hopes rising. Victor appeared through the door, and slowly walked in, his face beaming. John swallowed down the disappointment, and gave him a small grin.
Closing the door behind him, Sherlock stopped in his tracks and glared at Sebastian Moran.
“Spoon,” he corrected himself.
“Sherlock? What the hell are you doing here?” John asked as he scrambled to stand up.
John gaped at him, and swayed on his feet. Sherlock took in his appearance, his deductions flying out of his mouth before he could stop himself.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say. He continued to stare at his confused lover, who remained still against him as they floated in the water. For once, Sherlock Holmes didn’t know what to do. He was lost. He was exhausted with trying to persuade John that he didn’t die, and that he had been right here this whole time. But his lover had seen the act, and it was tragically convincing it seemed it had broken him.
John laughed lightly. “He just turned forty…”
He blinked in shock at his own outburst, and looked up at Sherlock. Sherlock was staring at him, his face crestfallen for a split second before hardening, his lip stiffening and his fists clenching by his side.
They exited the room and closed the door before taking off their masks and facing Sherlock. Margaret appeared beside Sherlock and helped him to his feet.
The room filled with silence as Sherlock’s sobs came to a shuddering end. What seemed like eternity, the medical staff hovered around the two; Mycroft remained in the doorway, all eyes focused on the detective and his blogger.
“Do you have any idea—.”
“Sherlock’s dead,” John said. “Why would I see him?”
Sherlock took him to bed and dressed him in fresh pajamas. John refused to put a shirt on, and instead pulled the sheet over his clad torso. He whimpered from the moment and looked at Sherlock.
“Why?” John interrupted.
Dr. Smith looked at him closely. “There is a difference between grieving and missing someone. You sound sure of yourself.”
“Shhh, it’s alright. I won’t okay?”
“You feeling all right, John?”
“Because I might die.”
Mycroft inhaled sharply. “How long until…”
“Everything all right?” Willoughby asked attentively. “You voiced some concerns last time.”
John’s head snapped up and he looked at Sherlock. Sherlock was looking at him, his eyes flickering with confusion and he brows knitted together. John held his tongue, and waited, keeping his eyes on Sherlock’s expression.
Sherlock straightened up, the familiar face dawning on him.
“We both know it’s a lie.” Sherlock retorted.
Moran ignored him. “Now about our other suspects.” Moran said in annoyance.
He didn’t say a word until they were in the lobby while John was taken into surgery.
it was for the best? There wasn’t anything to tell!” Sherlock exclaimed. “It wouldn’t have changed anything. He doesn’t feel the same way as I do. Why would he? He’s denied it every chance he’s got.” Sherlock was spilling it out before he could stop himself.
“Sherlock?”
“Can I come in to my flat?”
“You never said anything…” John muttered.
He lunged forward, grabbed the closest thing he could get his hands on—an abandoned tire iron—and swung. John ducked, but heard the iron hit a skull, and then a curse followed by a groan, then silence.
Sherlock knew it had been too good to be true, to find a person who accepted his rude personality and befriended him, to find someone that even he actually cared for, still made no sense to him. And now here was the proof. This was why he didn’t form any kind of relationship—it just had never worked out like what he and John had.
*            *            *
There are some parallels and similar quotes to Grey's Anatomy, so if you're a fan, keep an eye out :)
“Why a safe house?” John asked.
“Sherlock Holmes, by the way,” he introduced himself, taking John’s hand in a brief shake, who accepted kindly. “So it’s your brother who’s the alcoholic,” Sherlock stated rather than asked. John peered at him, his lip twitching.
John remained unconscious. Sherlock desperately pressed his fingertips against the man’s neck, and found a pulse—slow but there nonetheless. Wrapping an arm around John’s waist, Sherlock picked him up and took his arm around his neck.
John nodded but didn’t move. He set aside the paper and appeared anxious, even distant, and wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eye. Sherlock was sure of the reason now.
Mary turned on her heal and fled. John watched her carefully run down the tunnel until she disappeared into the darkness.
“I can feel you.” John leaned up and kissed him on the lips. He leaned away just as it threatened to turn passionately.
John chuckled and looked at Sherlock’s watch. “God, what a day.”
John inhaled deeply and then let out a trembling sigh.
(General) Velar Sounds:  K, G, "ng" like ring
Sherlock tensed but kept his face blank.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before the older man could respond, a black SUV sped down the street and crashed into the left end-side. The car spun a 180 and abruptly came to a halt by the curb.
As he took another step, resting his crutches on it and lowering his left leg, pain shot through his leg, startling him. John instinctively reached for the railing on his left, but he misjudged the distance. He hand only grazed it before he fell onto his right side.
John met his eye. “Course I am.”
“He won’t be lucid for a bit. You can leave if you want—.”
“Why have you been—” John waved his hand in between them and around him. Sherlock raised his eyebrows with slightly amusement.
Sirens echoed from afar, and relief flooded Sherlock’s mind.
“You can take your time in deciding. But if you become critical and unable to consent, before signing either form, I’ll have to consider your previous forms, from the first surgery.”
Sherlock’s face scrunched up slightly, and he whispered, “Yes?”
“Not at the top of my brain. Why don’t you just read the stories? They’re not that long?”
Sherlock straightened out his coat and looked around. “Must have left it at home,” he said with a shrug and headed to the door.
John smiled softly and met Sherlock’s eye.
“Er, just wait and see, I guess.”
“He said this is just the beginning and that he will strike again—.” John abruptly coughed roughly, tensing up from the strained movement.
“You only just got this case an hour ago and seek my help this quick. Must be desperate.” Sherlock voice wasn’t mocking, but annoyed, as if he wasn’t the one being desperate.
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and straightened up. “Of course you do. It wouldn’t make any sense if you didn’t. Just accept it already so we can—.”
Sherlock did, and his gaze lingered at the wedding ring.
Sherlock stilled in his seat and glanced up at John, his face unexpressive apart from the tiniest flicker of uncertainty.
Sherlock leaned closer. “John?”
“Remember he…before I went away, the case with the ambassador’s missing children?”
“Not this way, apparently not. I’m still not sure what the purpose of the drug is for, but I’ll figure it out John. And I’ll find the men who started this.” Sherlock was looking at him intently, and John gave him a small smile.
John gasped and took a step back, his vision blurring. He looked from Sherlock, who was looking intently for something on the coffee table, and back to the image. It was Dr. John Willoughby!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who would do that?” John muttered. The sight was still fresh in his mind, and he shivered at the memory.
John huffed and sent him an amusing glare and smirk. “If I am, at least your right behind me.”
John chuckled and lowered his gaze to his menu. “No, it’s not our anniversary. We’ve only been dating since July.”
“And the journals,” John mentioned as he ate his crisps. “What sort of symptoms were there—or not there—that suggested it wasn’t Alzheimer’s?”
He thought oddly. A voice spoke above the rapid noises, grabbing Sherlock’s attention at the sound of his name.
“Well I’m not surprised. He’s a doctor, so—was,” he corrected himself.
“Dr. Grey, a bullet grazed his right thigh but it appears superficial. He has bruising along his abdomen and on his head he has a deep abrasion; may need surgery. And he has a brain tumor.”
“Ellis had been sitting here and writing just before he was killed.”
A rough cough finally escaped his lover’s throat, and his body convulsed; he hurled to his side and coughed up a lungful of water. Sherlock patted his back soothingly as he let out a breath as pure relief flooded his mind.
“I’d like that. When you’re out of here I’ll pepper you with kisses…to catch up.”
Sherlock helped turn John on his side, and then held him still as he placed the towel on the bed. He placed another one against John’s pillow, and then helped John back in place. He removed the blankets and then reached for John’s gown and untied it. Sherlock removed it, and pulled it just down to his hips.
John started to nod, but then a thought cut if off. He blinked and continued to nod, but by the doctor’s face, it wasn’t convincing.
Silken had giggled again. “Very good Holmes. Any one else?”
Sherlock pondered this and then began to walk off, allowing John to follow him. “No, no he wasn’t. An awful cabby too, you should have seen the route he took us to get here.”
John hummed softly but pulled back reluctantly. “Okay, it’s officially been more than twelve hours since I’ve eaten. I need food now, and so do you.”
“I don’t want to.” His voice cried out.
Lestrade narrowed his eyes. Sherlock sighed. “I’ll refrain from being myself. We’ll meet you at Scotland Yard. Come on, John.”
John took a sip of tea and looked at him. He softened his face and tilted his head up, and then offered a small smile.
In the box was a severed leg, cut at the knee, and tightly wrapped up in plastic.
“You didn’t have to come with me.”
She looked at him with firm politeness. “It’s most likely the aneurysm starting to bleed. We’ll clip it and then take the tumor out. First we need to get him to CT now. Did he manage to consent?
“Just…call if you need anything.”
John ran a hand over his face, but then felt the scars, so he stopped. The quiet was too much; it was like when he had first started waking up. He remembered he could hear some sounds, but he couldn’t call back to it.
Sherlock shifted, and sighed. “What people?”
“Wake me up in an hour, then in two, and so on.”
After a few moments, Sherlock felt himself getting hard, and he opened his eyes and glanced down. His cock was peaking out of his pants, and John’s hand was stroking it, his speed picking up. His strokes were nearly right, and he ran his thumb over the top.
John stilled, and gaped for a moment.
“Well? Get on with it.”
John nodded understandably and continued looking at the ground. “I know. It’s all right, I guess. You were just doing it to distract me. To be honest, I’m not surprised—.”
“Sherlock! Oh fuck, yes! Fuck—.”
Sherlock stood up and stepped closer, grazing his nose against the plastic.
Her voice remained calm. “It can act like a sedative, and make him a lot more drowsy then he would like to be. It was a call we made. Hopefully, he won’t have another seizure, and can be taken off the medication after a while. I’ll run it by the doctor, and then we’ll give some to him.”
“You barely ate at the hospital.”
So otherwise, enjoy :)
Lestrade pulled up to the crime scene, a deserted shoreline along the river with police tape surrounding it. Sherlock strutted through the slimy rocks without hesitation. John cautiously took a step at a time, wary of his right leg. It was only his second day, and although he was excited for the case, feeling this normalcy suddenly seemed to exhaust him during the car ride. He eventually made it to the scene, where Sherlock was waiting for him by the tape, his eyes flickering with concern.
John told himself. He rolled his shoulders and loosened his neck, but the tension wasn’t going away. He put Sherlock’s discarded coat away and then lied on the sofa, spooning Sherlock with his chest pressed up to Sherlock’s back.
“So Moran,” John whispered. “He must have had this planned.”
Sherlock stirred, and blinked blearily as he started to wake up. It was still dark outside, and a glance at the clock told him it was almost six. He looked down and found John still asleep, curled up against his chest. Sherlock looked at him fondly, and wrapped his arms around his blogger. John shifted slightly and sighed with content.
Sherlock sighed. “Alright.”
Lestrade left soon after the start of the third hour, insisting Sherlock call him when there was news, and made sure he had answered before he left. As he left, a black car pulled up to the entrance, and Lestrade blocked the curb, keeping the man between him and the car.
“You.”
“I’ll probably be there for a year at the least,” he added. Sherlock kept his gaze directed at the outside world, but all he was seeing was John’s reflection in the window.
Sherlock thought, but allowed him to continue.
“About?”
“Well…” Sherlock looked down briefly before back up. “I’m not now.”
“It is. And I have another one on my phone, not a copy just another recording.”
“Overdose?” John asked.
“John…” Sherlock’s voice was quiet and tinged with a slight shudder. He was as close as he could be against John’s body, with them both lying flat on the bed and their chests heaving against the others.
“You go. I’m busy,” Sherlock snapped.
“No sir. But this call came in for you,” she handed him a mobile phone, and then left.
“For staying,” John continued. “For not leaving me,” he finished with a whisper.
They stared at each other silently, and then Sherlock walked in closer and kept the door opened.
“I’ll get them.” Sherlock quickly left. John hurriedly took his pants off and sat down on the chair just before Sherlock came back. It seemed he had ran into their room for his clothes and ran back in case John needed help. John wasn’t sure how to take that.
“It wasn’t a stranger, your father knew him. We’ll go over any coworkers and keep you updated.” Sherlock looked at Lestrade, who cleared his throat.
“It balances things out. The same medical diagnosis day in and day out can be exhausting, so unwinding with an Austen or a Milton has proved to be quite fulfilling.”
Sherlock sighed and released his hand over his knee, unclenching his fists to relax the cramping. The video was unbearable, but seeing it brought things to light.
Sherlock looked at him expectantly, part of habit, and John relaxed at that. He kneeled down stiffly and rearranged his legs until he was comfortable, and then looked closely. The skin was paler than it would be dry, and after examining the man’s mouth and chest, he leaned away and looked at Sherlock.
“It was just a graze.” Sherlock corrected.
Sherlock leaned back and closed his eyes.
“I don’t want you to come with me,” he said flatly.
Mycroft followed, pulling out his phone and inhaling slightly.
He picked up Sherlock’s phone, and saw Sherlock had missed calls from John, Molly, and even his brother. Feeling uneasy, John dialed Molly’s number.
“You broke your back in the landing.” John met his eyes, and they were indeed glistening, but no tears were falling. “You’re paralyzed. From the waist down. There may be some feeling left, but…”
“Did you…have you…” John bit his lip, afraid of what the answer might be. “Have you taken anything?”
A nurse came up to him one morning and handed him his first dose of medication. He didn’t look familiar, and his nametag said Billy. John figured he was new.
“Hungry?” she asked.
“I don’t belong here! This is just limbo; it’s nowhere.”
“A case. An elderly man fell down the stairs, or so it had seemed.”
“He is too young,” Willoughby assured. “But it’s not unheard of. Watch him, see what he is eating, and if there are any changes in his routine. If his symptoms don’t go away, or increase, bring him in and I could run some tests. I’m afraid there isn’t much to do for something we’re not sure what it is.”
John opened his eyes to darkness again. He was numb; he felt cold and empty within, but the slightest grasp of heat surrounded him, and yet as he tried to bathe into it, it would begin to fade. Hovering in front of him was a hallucination, skin clean of any wounds and face devastatingly poignant.
“No. Of course not,” John said hoarsely. “How could you think that?”
“You solved it,” John whispered hoarsely. Sherlock stared into the oceanic storm before he let out a laugh and nodded.
John had been talking to Mary sporadically over the phone, actually answering her calls this time rather than ignoring them. Usually they would always end with John huffing with annoyance. Fortunately, he never lashed out at Sherlock, and kept to himself as his irritation boiled down until it was practically forgotten about…until the next time he talked to her.
Sherlock continued to step closer, and within reach, he grabbed John’s arms and tried to bring him closer, desperate to prove that he was real. John squirmed in his grasp and twisted away. He pushed Sherlock roughly back, and stumbled from the loss of support. He lost his footing and twisted his ankle, falling sideways, and hitting his head on the desk. He was knocked out cold.
“Good, I’ll have it worked on. Now would you play the interrogation interview? It hasn’t been long since it took place, so I can say it hasn’t been tampered with.”
“Found something over here.” A voice spoke from behind him.
“And what are you going to tell John? Tell him not to worry and everything is done now or that you both are still in danger?”
John’s mind raced over several possibilities, but only came to one he was dreading.
Margaret sighed. “We may have to intubate him.”
“It’s your birthday, Sherlock.”
One week later, Sherlock was in the kitchen, dressing robe falling loosely over one shoulder as he stared at the forgotten syringe lying on the counter, mocking the detective. That was absurd—items don’t mock people.
“Eh.”
“You need to leave, you can—.”
“John, it’s okay I’m fine—.”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock caressed his cheek once more, and then stepped forward. He parted his legs and sat in John’s lap, placing his legs over the chair to the other side and pressing his chest against John’s. Sherlock settled in John’s lap and wrapped his arms around his shoulders.
A sudden ring interrupted the eeriness of the room; Sherlock pulled out his phone and read the recent text.
John swallowed tightly. “That can’t—.”
The next morning, John walked by the bathroom and overheard Sherlock talking to himself. He paused by the door, and froze when he realized what Sherlock was saying.
John’s eyes lit up, and he leaned forward, his lips nearly smirking. He paused right by Sherlock’s ear, and then whispered. Sherlock shivered at his voice, suddenly feeling excitement flow through his body.
“I—I did—I.”
“Please…”
Moran shrugged. “Then arrest whoever sent it. I had no part in it, I’m just following orders.”
“Okay,” John breathed shakily. “Then stay. Just not out of obligation.”
“Perhaps this is just a visit, to see how things are coming along.”
The soldier gasped. Before he could speak, Sherlock rummaged through the table drawer with his long arm and pulled out a bottle of lube. Meanwhile, the man on top of him leaned back and pulled out a condom from his jeans. He applied it over his hardening cock and then took the lube and applied it.
“You sure?”
“I don’t care right now. John needs me, so just do us both a tremendous favor and leave,
“I can still shave for you,” Sherlock whispered from afar.
*            *            *
“You’re here
John scoffed, and felt, with unease, the excitement slowly dying. “Well, did you look in the fridge? Because I know we have bread and milk. Eggs can wait. There should be soap in the bathroom under the sink.”
“Sher-lock,” John said out of breath. “G-get me a mirror.”
“John?”
Mary looked closer at the screen. “Hang on, isn’t that Watson?”
“I’m not, John.”
“No, I need to do something, John.”
“Sure, all right. Take care.”
John furrowed his eyebrow. “Why are we going there? We don’t have any of the Ellis’ food—”
Comments for quicker updates :)
Just as Sherlock proceeded with the next slide, the door creaked open, revealing Mike. Catching a glimpse of him and another trailing closely behind, Sherlock looked away and ignored them without a thought to manners.
Sherlock showered, however slowly, as his muscles were still sore from the lack of movement. As he turned the shower off, he realized that all he had was a towel.
Mycroft pursed his lips and then turned on his heel. “As you wish…"
“I’m not going anywhere.” Sherlock replied as he took John’s hand into his own and gently squeezed it. John gave him another weak smile as his eyes fluttered closed. Soon enough, he was asleep again.
John exhaled softly and looked around. The flat didn’t look messier, just dusty. The window by the desk had even been fixed, John realized. He looked back at Sherlock, who was nearly twirling around the room, subtly putting things away, trying to clean up the place. The image sparked a memory of John’s, and he was suddenly overwhelmed with emotion. Sherlock stilled and looked up at him, his eyes flickering over his body, reading him. John realized he must have inhaled sharply, almost like a gasp, causing Sherlock’s attention to go to him.
John helped Sherlock with his shoes, and retrieved a packed bag from the kitchen.
Memories of the past several hours flooded in Sherlock’s mind, and he crawled back up to face John.
Sherlock looked at the footage, crowds of people moving passed the entrance and a few going down the stairs. A figure drew his attention, and he looked closer.
John managed to sleep for an hour, and then he was gently awoken to a nurse leaving his food on his table.
John shifted his balance, feeling a little uncomfortable. Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows slightly as he wet his hair.
“Sister?”
Sherlock shook his head. “Not import—.”
“Excuse me?” Sherlock said as he finished with the foot.
“Go on, John.” Sherlock suddenly felt nervous but he looked at John fondly, offering a small smile of encouragement. John smiled nervously and reached into his pocket. He pulled out a small box and placed it in front of Sherlock.
John cleared his throat and opened his mouth to speak. He couldn’t form a word just yet so instead he nodded. Harry poured him a cup and held the straw to his mouth. John took a shaking sip before lying back down as more tears escaped his eyes.
Sherlock nodded and turned around. John was wearing his green button up, tucked into his jeans with a brown belt that matched his shoes. He was freshly shaven and smelled—
Mycroft sighed. “Right, get dress. I’ll wait in the car,” he said calmly.
Sherlock remained silent for a split second too long and John continued. “If you have any worries you can tell me. I want to know what you’re thinking.”
“It’ll pass. Just take it slow today. No cases.”
“For God’s sake, he not! Don’t you trust me?” Sherlock said just as Lestrade walked into the sitting room. Turning to him, Sherlock snapped. “You could’ve knocked.”
Another voice echoed in his mind, but it was cold and raspy, like it’s own throat was being constricted from air.
“You’re not my babysitter—.”
John awoke some hours later in the same room. His arm was in his sling while his uninjured arm was softly handcuffed to the railing, as were his feet and a strap lied over his hips.
“Mycroft came to the hospital. Said I wasn’t safe there; whoever shot me had apparently showed up, probably wanted to finish the job, I didn’t see him but Mycroft did—he must have gotten away—but he took me here anyway and then left I suppose. You need to call him, Sherlock. He wouldn’t tell me anything.” John sighed deeply and settled himself against the pillows. Sherlock nodded and stepped away, pulling out his phone.
John sniggered abruptly, and then clamped his mouth shut, taken aback by the sound. The snigger had vibrated through his body. It was familiar and addictive, causing John to smile again, slower but growing.
“It’s called a cheetah sometimes; it’s a flex foot, and so is the other, but that one is more shaped like a foot. It’ll be good for—,”
Sherlock’s head snapped up with a hesitant grin. John chuckled softly and shook his head.
“How convenient,” Sherlock muttered.
John shrugged and ran his hand over his face. He smiled at Molly softly and nodded.
Sherlock met the man’s eyes and inwardly gasp. “You,” was all he could say.
Sherlock pondered for a moment.
“Well, took you long enough.”
John spun around to the man in question.
“So that’s it, then?” John bristled. “Florence Ellis was drugged, but we can’t prove it because the medication is gone.”
And that's that. Stay tuned for the next chapter, don't worry things should be cleared up by the end if they weren't clear here. I'm in the middle of writing chapter 7, and there should be about 10. Chapter 5 will probably be 2 parts, it's quite long.
“If you wake up now, I won’t bother you anymore. I’ll leave, or stay, whatever you want me to do. I’ll leave you forever if you wake the fuck up now! P-Please!”
“How about if I place your left arm on the table, could you hold the pencil?” Mandy asked.
“Do you need any help?”
“Moriarty’s body has been taken care of. I’m sending teams across the continent to locate his network. You will be placed in a safe house after you recover; the public thinks you’re dead so hopefully no one will find out.”
She smiled as John opened his eyes.
Sherlock lifted his chin and straightened his posture. “You’re right. I’m sorry John. I shouldn’t have kept it from you. You deserved to know.” Sherlock’s posture buckled just slightly, and he lowered his chin and gaze. “It won’t happen again.”
that wasn’t the case—but he couldn’t take it back now.
Sherlock bit his lip and looked down.
Sherlock didn’t turn around, and nodded. “I’m fine—.”
Sherlock told himself.
considering it. I haven’t completely given up. I just…when I first found out, I…I felt like I wanted to live but then…I-I don’t know, I guess I-I realized I don’t have much or anything…to live for. I needed hope. But, um, doctor, er, Shepherd scheduled a meeting to go over the plan regarding surgery…and whether there will be one or a few, so…we’ll see.”
John sighed and raised a shaky hand to the yogurt. The trembles had barely stopped in the past few days, and the doctor had said it was just his muscles healing from being atrophied for so long, but it was still considered an improvement.
John nodded honestly. “Good. Everything…is good.” He smiled wide at Sherlock, and his eyes glistened slightly. Sherlock softened his face, and took John’s hand in his. He squeezed it gently, and smiled.
Sherlock weakly stumbled into the room only to stop dead in his tracks of the sight of John. His John. He hadn’t seen him since the graveyard about a month ago. He looked awful then. This time, he looked much worse—sickening even. He was elevated only slightly, enough to lay back and relax, not quite to sit up. Where the surgeon had cut into his brain, only part of his hair had been shaved however it was barely noticeable due to the light bandage. An oxygen tube ran under his nose, and his face was pale, splotchy in color, a slight green tinge was there and the skin around his eyes were darker with exhaustion clearly not just from the operation.
“When…” John whispered.
“Oh so now a broken heart is worse than death.”
John’s hand twitched just slightly underneath Sherlock’s palm. This tiny movement of life eliminated the overwhelming tide of sentiments (for now); it was now the moment of truth.
“I think he’s going through something emotionally and psychologically,” Dr. Bailey suggested. “He seems bothered. And, lonely. Has he had any visitors?”
“Mhm?”
John nodded. “I can feel my ankle. It might be visible on the other side of the hull and debris. Maybe you can click the pin free and my stump will slide out of the prosthetic.”
“That’s my girl, that’s it. You spoke! Can you do it again?” he asked. Molly smiled and bounced Rosie slightly in her arms.
Sherlock grinned and then dropped the other hand abruptly. He turned on his heel and headed down the hallway. Once inside, he turned on the shower, and only one minute passed before he heard the front door close shut.
“But doctor—.”
John opened the door wide and walked in. “
Sherlock leaned back against the blogger’s shoulder. “They only shaved part of it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock went straight to his usual chair, sat down, and then started to read the morning paper he had brought with him. He didn’t speak, and neither did John. After several minutes of silence, John prepared to say something, but then he saw Victor waiting outside in the hall, and all motivation dissipated.
John dropped his chin to his chest and breathed deeply. He sniffed back the leaking tears and then looked back up; only one had escaped and it trailed lonely down his cheek.
“The police consult with me,” Sherlock reminded him.
Sherlock traced his finger up John’s cheek and then caressed it. John’s eyes fluttered slightly and he leaned into the touch. Sherlock cupped his cheek and then leaned forward. He pressed his lips chastely against the crown of John’s head, and then leaned back. John glanced at his face, noticing the flickering emotions and furrowed brows.
“Do you need—”
“Brilliant,” John stated with affection as he stood up, but then his right foot slipped against the rock, and he stumbled backwards, landing in the muddy shore before he could catch his balance. Sherlock was quickly by his side before John realized what happened, and he let out a sharp laugh, catching both he and Sherlock by surprise.
“Clearly.” John ignored Sherlock’s flat tone.
At least Sherlock had the decency to cuff his right hand rather than his left, in case he did need to shoot someone. John tugged against the handcuffs for a good five minutes—or at least that’s how long it felt—but they didn’t budge. It was worth a try though. The desk chair was apparently too heavy to drag with him, realizing this after several attempts of arranging it in order to get it through the door.
I stare at her and don’t know what to think. I absolutely forgot about the blog. But now that I‘ve remembered, I want to erase it. I want to delete the blog and keep all the memories of you to myself.
He held his breath. Not knowing what would happen next wasn't a desirable feeling in the presence of Britain's most powerful man and twelve guards in his back.
But I can’t.
Sherlock nodded.
"I love you", blurted John despite himself. "We didn't say that enough. Thought you should hear it again."
You look at me and I just shake my head. You are too late. You are two years too late. I have Mary now. I like her: she is fantastic. It is not fair of you to come back now and overwhelm me like this. You’ve been gone. I was over you and now you come back as if nothing has happened? That’s not fair. I don’t even live at Baker Street anymore. You can’t do this. What about Mary? She loves me. You cannot make me choose. You are too late.
, I say.
, echoed Sherlock's scolding voice in his head. John turned to the real Sherlock and met an alarmed expression. He knew he should not have done that. He tried to look apologetic. Sherlock turned away  and focused back on Mycroft.
Sherlock got up and joined John on the bed. "I know. I guess you'd say the same if we had done it more regularly, though." He moved and knelt behind John, massaging his shoulders, long fingers slowly wandering to John's collar and opening the first button of his shirt. He bent down to kiss John's neck and jaw, moving John gently onto his back. He hovered above him and kissed with lips salty from a few tears.
"The last case that went wrong because yo-"
After what felt like hours they came to a halt and the door opened. John absentmindedly wondered why they were changing cars as he was led into a new vehicle.
"I'm sorry Mr. Watson. We need to blindfold you so that you won't know where we going. We can't risk you leaving hints for Mr. Holmes."
killed for him several times already. He was reckless and dangerous when it came to Sherlock.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes."
"Sherlock?" His heart started beating faster and he leaned into the general direction from where the voice came.
"I hope you understand that we needed evidence for the nature and depth of your relationship to determine just how dangerous you actually are."
Sherlock's eyes grew wide. "Every case since I met John?" he asked in disbelieve.
John didn't know the person talking to him. He just looked at her and shrugged. Too tired and heartbroken to do anything other than obey. He was blindfolded and guided into a car. The blindfold had to remain on until they reached their destination.
Mycroft paused, “This was a month after John moved in. I never knew how hard you fell for him. And so soon. The pages after you came back from the dead were bad.”
"John?"
I know that you’re keeping her phone in that drawer. I know you saw it when I took it and tried to unlock it.
Your brother pressured me to go and see my therapist again, after your decease. I refused in the beginning: I didn’t leave the flat. I sat in your chair for a whole day and cried silent tears. Only when I was too weak to feel anything anymore, I gave in to Mycroft’s demand. And now I’m sitting here and can’t say a word. I promised you to never say it again. But you’re dead. Can you even hear it then?
"Solved cases. Happy endings. Less criminals."
Mycroft went through many pages and stopped when he found what he was looking for. "This is interesting. 'I can't bear to be so close to him. I can't possibly be his best man and not feel like he is slipping away from me. It hurts so much. This is not what I had planned. Everything was so neatly planned but nothing worked out.' I hate how you relapsed and started taking drugs again. You could've come to me, Sherlock."
John trembled and grabbed hold of the mantle above the fireplace. He breathed deeply through his nose and slowly breathed out of his mouth. Sherlock stayed still where he was, unsure of what to do. He wanted to hold John and prove to him he was really there but he didn’t want to scare him off.
John hummed and then began pushing Sherlock in the direction toward their room, stumbling slightly over the rug and the chairs in the kitchen. Finally in the room, Sherlock collapsed backwards on the bed, and John ran his hands down his sides as he sucked a love bite on Sherlock’s pale neck.
He hesitantly raised his hands and peeled John off of him. The man was asleep, his face red and blotchy from the tears and sweat. His eyes twitched underneath his lids but he didn’t awaken. Sherlock gently laid him down back in the covers and laid the duvet back over his body, not too tightly but enough to keep him warm through the rest of the morning. Sherlock stood, and headed to the doorway. He paused and looked at John’s sleeping form, and then left, closing the door only part away, leaving enough space for anyone sound to come through, just in case.
“Dammit Sherlock where the fuck have you been?” John whispered in Sherlock’s ear, sending a warm shiver down the detective’s spine. Sherlock let out a shudder and tightened his grip. He didn’t respond to the question; he would have time to explain later. Right now Sherlock wanted to enjoy the moment. He was finally with John. He was home.
“Marry me.” John whispered.
“You don’t believe that,” John protested quietly. “You didn’t want to hurt me.”
John looked at Sherlock’s arm, and suddenly found his eyes were filling up again. He inhaled deeply and blinked a few times, clearing up his vision.
~Erin
“But he’s right. I mean,” John cleared his throat as everyone turned their eyes to look at him. “The powder looks like cocaine, but slightly different, almost like snow rather than powder, and those symptoms would have happened in any kind of overdose. It’s not hard to claim that that’s what happened.”
“No John you need to leave. I can walk, I’ll be up in a minute—.”
in a long time. John slowly smiled affectionately, and stretched up to graze Sherlock’s lips with his own. “Alright, okay then. Let’s do it.”
“Shit—I mean, pardon me. Could you wait here for a moment?” she asked John.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped, his face flushing and his voice becoming less stable without his permission. The only word he could form was, “Watson?”
*            *            *
“I’m sorry. But I’m fine now.”
“John,” he greeted flatly. He prepared to take another step, but then stopped himself and turned back to face John, his eyes widening.
“CCTV cameras caught sight of a man matching Moran’s description, however his face is once again out of sight. He was spotted just around the corner a few days ago, and other places surrounding, possibly to get a feel of the place. Intel also shares that Moran may be attempting to reconnect with others to reinstate Moriarty's network.”
Sherlock sighed. “He wants to rub it in that I had asked for something from him this quickly in the case.”
“Just wanted to make sure you were okay. Form what he heard, that man’s a creep,” Lestrade said.
“I—(clears throat)—I was just worried, you were thrashing about, crying, and appeared to be in pain——.”
“You should get that cut checked.” Mycroft pointed out.
“Who would marry me?”
This is quite short, so I might update Chapter 4 in a few days or perhaps on Thursday instead of Friday. We'll see :)
Silken had reached in his pocket and pulled out a glass bottle of clear fluid.
“Well they’re from me. I’m the head director of CTU, I have a warrant signed by the President—.”
night, and although I too found that night to be quite successful, I’m really not looking for any—”
Sherlock stepped back and began to pace, placing his fingers under his chin. “John and I worked on a case a few years ago, before the Reichenbach Case. There was a drug that was used to stimulate fear; it distorted reality and made the intoxicated person fear whatever they saw or heard. This drug is being made to torture people, just like that one, but it’s different. It can easily fool an ordinary person as simple cocaine, but it won’t be sold in the streets. It’s only for manipulation. Then why would Silken go through all that trouble? Why have apples on the boxes. Why have the bullets—?”
John looked at him with a sad gleam in his eyes, and leaned forward, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders.
John heard Sherlock step closer. He opened his eyes slightly, but then the tears came quickly, and then he was sobbing. The stitches tightened uncomfortably in his forehead, and the tears stung his eyes and itched his skin. He raised his hands and attempted to cover his face, when gentle hands wrapped around his wrists and pulled them away.
“They’re sisters. If you look at them in the same room, you’ll see the connection.”
“It’s been one month and three days since we’ve had sex—actually had it. Before your…accident.”
“Is John all right?” She demanded.
“Right, thanks.”
John furrowed his brows, and then slowly shook his head. Dr. Bailey seemed to leave it at that for now.
“Then why did you tag along?”
Sherlock looked back at the paper, and looked over each one, deciding on which would be easy to try first. He glanced up at John, who was still blushing.
“So Moriarty’s still dead though?”
John stuttered, much to Sherlock’s amusement. “We, yes, we will be needing two,” he said, his gaze drifting to the couch and then flickering to Sherlock. He blushed deeper when Sherlock met his gaze with a smirk.
“Good. How about ‘be’?”
John furrowed his eyebrows and tried to catch his balance. He wasn’t up for a grocery store run and he really wanted to see Sherlock’s reaction. He pressed back against Sherlock and stopped them just above the stairs.
“Mhm.” John groaned but kept his head towards Sherlock. Gradually, his eyes peeked open.
Sherlock seemed taken aback by the question, but slowly nodded. “All right.”
John let out a shaky breath. “Because…
“What’s that?”
Sherlock’s movements came to a halt and he slide down onto his knees. He held John by the hips and breathed heavily as he bowed his head and rested it against John’s abdomen.
Sherlock widened his eyes with a very quizzical look in his gaze. He also looked bothered, as if something else was still on his mind.
“No.”
“You better have an explanation for this. And expect a punch to the face when you come back.” John swore.
Four days later, they were sent to the safe house. John wanted to stay longer at the hospital, because Sherlock still had difficulty in sitting up on his own, but Mycroft was insistent.
”—tormented John during the night, he couldn’t imagine what it must have done to Sherlock.
“Well why else would you be here?”
Thank you for waiting <3 I have new fic ideas hopefully coming soon, and with all the angst!
“Did you want to rest? I can help you to bed—”
“If I don’t hear from you in an hour, I will meet you there at the crime scene. It should still be taped off,” Lestrade said firmly.
“I—I” John stammered, a loss for words.
*            *            *
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, no, I’m fine,” John insisted. He was really getting tired of that word, but couldn’t think of anything else appropriate.
Sherlock couldn’t help but see the slight disappointment in John’s eyes.
John pulled back and looked at him, hardening his gaze.
“Hm?”
“Good, Mr. Holmes. What did you do last Christmas?”
The medical facts and protocols have been exaggerated for strictly fiction uses.
“What?”
John nodded. “Yeah…not so bad. You don’t look so good yourself. Is there, er, good news?”
“It’s normal. It’ll get better.”
“What are you doing here?” He asked again but then cut himself off when he immediately realized the answer. “Oh, Mycroft told you didn’t he?”
There were murmurs on MI6’s side; CTU remained stoic.
“It’s John.”
Sherlock nodded, and closed his eyes, ignoring John’s offer to hold his hand. The nurse pushed the switch and the bed began to move upwards. It only moved an inch, and pain shot through Sherlock’s chest and back, vanishing at his waist. He clenched his jaw, muffling his groaning as the bed shifted again, two more inches, and then a pause. He breathed in deeply, ignoring the tears leaking out of the corner of his eyes. He was already breaking out into a sweat. He refused to look at John, but grabbed the offered hand before it was out of reach.
Moran led him to the upper floor, a large one-room space with columns spread out. In the center were five men, and the man who had taken John was standing behind them. Sherlock inhaled sharply as he was brought in front of them. All men had their hands tied behind their back, and each had a bullet wound to the thigh. They all looked like John Watson, their hair the same shades of brown and blond with wisps of grey in the front and on the sides. Their eyes were lowered except a few looked up at him, their eyes glistening with plea.
“Good,” John lied. “I want to leave.” He cleared his throat and caught her gaze. “Please. I’ll sign anything.”
Sherlock’s mouth twitched into a grin before settling back down. He leaned closer; John could feel warmth surround him.
Footsteps squeaked against the wet floor behind Sherlock, and the detective turned around to see Sven heading towards them, gun in hand.
The person fell quiet, and then squeezed his shoulder gently as she went around his bed and headed out the door. As the door closed, John’s vision slowly started to come into focus. He was lying nearly flat on his back in a bed, and he could see glimpses of wires, tubes, and metal railings around him.
The medical staff stared and remained silent, stunned.
John huffed with annoyance and shot Sherlock a look. Sherlock refused to meet his eye and instead glared at his brother. “We’ve been a little busy.” He snapped.
“I know, we just got here, but Sherlock is asleep, and I don’t know if he’ll wake up today.”
“—And his momentary forgetfulness could be explained by exhaustion or stress. I’d recommend a nice vacation.” Willoughby smiled at them, his expression honest and clear.
“John? Can you hear me?”
“I’ll come by later, John,” Sherlock said assuringly. John didn’t respond, and squeezed his eyes closed as they started to sting. He heard Sherlock walk away, and then the door closed behind him.
John let out a shaky sigh and shook his head. Sherlock looked at him, and creased his forehead.
Long fingers wrapped around John’s wrist, and he glanced around, meeting Sherlock’s open eyes instantly. They were greenish blue, glistening against the lights, and clear. John inhaled softly and leaned closer.
“Is there something else you want to ask?” John carefully pried.
“Nobody could be that clever.”
“Ready to stand?” the physical therapist, Alex, asked.
“I need you to tell me,” he continued, hesitantly. “What you want me to do.”
“Mary Morstan, 2472, here with John Watson, his statement for his whereabouts of the 5
The third time John woke up, it was to the sound of someone moving beside him. He flickered his eyes open, but his vision remained blurry. The figure beside him moved closer, and then there was noise. John blinked and focused his vision, and parted his mouth to speak up, but he couldn’t form a word. As he listened closely, the person was speaking to him, but he couldn’t understand exactly what they were saying.
“Can you take a step?” Mandy asked. John nodded and took one, but then lost his stamina. Sherlock held him up, and tried to hold him in place, but John continued forward. He managed two more full steps by dragging his feet slightly, and then he paused, breathing heavily.
Sherlock hummed in response, and John could sense Sherlock didn’t care so much about fictional text. He smirked to himself, and settled in his seat behind Sherlock.
Sherlock inhaled deeply and paused his lips by John’s overturned wrist.
John lost track for how long he wept. His body shuddered and trembled and ached with exhaustion, despite not having done much at all. He was embarrassed and disgusted with himself; how he could be this weak and selfish was beyond pitiful.
Sherlock smiled. “Besides,” he started his voice becoming more like his usual, deep baritone self. “We haven’t had sex in a month, and need to—.”
In front of Sherlock, John’s body began to jerk uncontrollably. His eyes fluttered shut and his head lolled to the side. He choked and groaned, and scrunched his face up in pain. Sherlock quickly pressed the nurse’s call button. He lowered the bed completely and then turned John onto his side.
Mary gasped. John inhaled sharply but remained standing in the corner. Sherlock’s eyes widened and lifted another cushion up. He looked up to John and Mary.
Sherlock wasn’t listening anymore, as his reflection in the mirror that was meant for shaving stared at him. He was paler, thinner, and half of his body was covered with fading bruises.
John chuckled lightly and looked up at Sherlock. “I’ll see you later, yeah?”
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows—again—and looked from John to Lestrade. “We just got here—oh.” He looked at John. “I am fine,” he said seriously.
John pushed the body off of him and crawled away. He stayed in equal distance from Moran’s body and Sherlock’s. The tears had stopped; the sudden acceptance lurked its way into John’s mind, but he blocked it out. He couldn’t accept it, not now.
Abruptly John climbed out of bed, made his way past the figure, and headed towards the bathroom.
Mary steadied her grip. “I will shoot him. You may not want to see this.”
First responders surrounded the pair, and quickly placed John on a stretcher and taking him to the ambulance. One of them helped Sherlock into a wheelchair, and loaded him into the truck. Mycroft was inside, his face masked with simple concern, but Sherlock could tell he was troubled.
“Lie down?”
“Think. I need to think, there must be somewhere…” Sherlock mumbled, looking around. The hallway was wide with doors leading to various rooms, and led straight on until it turned a corner. Windows lied on one side, and doors on the other. Some doors led to downstairs but none lead up to the deck. A dark red caught John’s eye, drawing it to Sherlock’s side as the detective scanned the hallway for any exits.
“Do you want to try the lab at Bart’s instead? Molly said you could use that new microscope. Top of the line. Would it help?”
John’s eyes went wide, blood flooding to color his cheeks. He was absolutely breathtaking.
He tossed aside the dagger and flipped Sherlock over, sliding easily into his abused hole. One edge of the blindfold had slipped up, but John could see Sherlock’s eyes were screwed shut in concentration, trying to be good, trying to keep from spilling before he was allowed.
Though never one to doubt what my senses and intellect together could detect, it was too much to be believed. In all our time together I never would have suspected such a predilection. I’m sure the shock of it showed on my face. “You’re suggesting…”
Then he’d left Lestrade messages with solutions to a half dozen cold cases, which he’d been ignoring in a dusty old box in the corner for ages.
Sherlock stiffened in his arms. “John?”
John let go, tasting iron and salt. He should feel bad for drawing blood, but John couldn’t regret it. The result was too spectacular, ribbons of white spilling across Sherlock’s stomach and the dripping slickness from where their bodies joined together. With a wicked gleam in his eye, he ran his fingers through the mess and licked them clean.
It didn’t take long before he gave them just what they needed. Sherlock asked a few questions, some answered and some dodged, but, the killer gave himself away when he called the victim’s dog by name, proving they’d known each other before.
“Don’t apologize for the most beautiful thing I’ve ever see.”
“Who says they can’t be?” John went to him, sweeping him into his arms and kissing him, tentatively at first. Could this really what Sherlock wanted?
John’s cock twitched and he drew a ragged breath. “Come here?”
“Beautiful,” Sherlock breathed.
The Captain, now fully nude and gloriously hard, sized him up. “Spread your legs, boy.”
John glanced at the door then back at Sherlock, running over what Sherlock had just said. Did he really mean…
Clearly realising what was in John’s hands, Sherlock’s eyes flashed and he launched himself off the sofa faster than John had ever seen him move, which was saying something.
John felt hope swell within his chest, but he needed to hear Sherlock say it. “Now, what?”
His voice turned stern and commanding, “I’ll be the judge of that, Holmes,” and I was helpless at that. Helpless and hopelessly aroused. My skin felt like fire everywhere he’d touched me, though they were the most innocent of touches, merely to my forehead, my arm.
He swallowed hard.
Their last time, Sherlock had been on his hands and knees, arse high, whispering “fuck me” over and over into the pillows, a mantra, a prayer a plea. John wouldn’t deny him. As he took him hard and fast, Sherlock cried out with pleasure, moving back against him to meet every thrust. Sherlock milked his cock, as though trying to wring every last drop of come from him and John did come, growling out his climax through clenched teeth to stave off biting, every instinct telling him to breed and bond his omega. His... even though Sherlock isn’t, he couldn’t be...
He pushed Sherlock to his knees, then drew the flogger again. “Twenty strokes for stealing passage, and another twenty for any supplies you’ve stolen. Count them out for me.”
Sherlock hummed acknowledgement as he jotted down his results in a small notebook.
John drew the scabbard of the dagger down Sherlock’s back. He cried out, so far gone he couldn’t tell it was sheathed.
I will admit I was startled by the speed and grace with which he moved to the door, slipping the bolt in place and returning to my bedside.
“Well, then?”
“Enjoying yourselves, me hearties?” Captain Watson cried out.
“Good to know.”
He shivered slightly at the delusion of “his” omega, but at least for this moment it was true.
The stowaway’s eyes widened for a moment and his voice trembled just so, as he asked, “Am I to be whipped, sir?”
Their lips met in a fierce kiss, fueled by their long-suppressed desire. After that, neither was aware of anything but hands and lips, the press of their bodies together for long moments. Sherlock straddled John’s lap, their cocks throbbing at the closeness.
come to think of John that way, but certainly hadn’t meant to bring it up aloud, especially in front of a stranger, and on a case no less. Leaving off the odd ‘by default’ would have made more sense if he was trying to further disarm him by implying that that they were gay too.
Quarantine. The whole city was basically on lockdown. No doubt it was a dreadful business for anyone and everyone, (except possibly manufacturers of disinfectants). But for Sherlock Holmes? Intolerable.
Every time John closed his eyes he could see Sherlock’s beautiful face contorted with pleasure or the way his eyes looked wide with desire. So vulnerable, too, in a way Sherlock never let himself be seen. He had let John in. To have had that, tasted that trust and peace and then to go back to this? Barely more than flatmates? It was unbearable. John ached for him.
“You prepared our nest.”
John simulated orgasm again with the toy in Sherlock’s arse, then pulled him off the cock at the headboard and spun him around so he could mount it.
“A successful experiment deserves repetition, and those results are certainly worth replicating,“ Sherlock said with a wink.
By the time they opened the door to leave, Lestrade’s team had surrounded the house. The arrest was a short business. Though their suspect did try to do a runner, John was on him before he got more than a few feet from the porch, tackling him to the ground in a move that was more rugby than military. Magnificent. Watching him set Sherlock’s heart hammering. It didn’t take long for the team to get their man cuffed and into the waiting car. Sherlock answered a few questions for Lestrade, then hailed a cab to take them back to Baker Street.
But not with him.
“Fuck,” Sherlock bit out, followed by a groan that neared a growl.
“Go away,” I shouted. He was no stranger to my moods and surely he had learned when to leave me to my own devices. Alas, he did not give up so easily today.
“Oh, John. Only you.” Sherlock’s voice was deeper even than his usual baritone and the way he said John’s name filled him with warmth. It spread through him, radiating like the comfort of a hot cup of cocoa in the chill of a winter morning. “It’s only ever been you.”
“Yes, but not terribly sexy, I’m afraid.”
“I can’t stop thinking about you. I thought I could get it out of my system if I just knew what it was like, but it’s been so much worse.”
“Like to be prepared. I don’t without-”
“I don’t ever plan to stop kissing you. Come here, you. Tomorrow I want you tell me everything. Everything. Tonight I just need to hold you.”
Sherlock flushed, “John, I’m sorry, I-”
“I’m ready for more,” John panted.
“Morning, love.” John padded into the kitchen.
, John thought. After a few minutes, he added, “You loved it, did you? At the mercy of a whole crew. Positively filthy,” John said fondly, somehow elevating that word to a kind of blessing.
All in all it had gone rather well, Sherlock thought, despite his odd introduction of John. Perhaps, he was going to let that slip past. But as his eyes drifted to the flatmate sitting beside him in the cab, that seemed unlikely. He looked tense, his posture rigid and fist clenching reflexively, as it so frequently did when he was agitated. Sherlock watched as John drew a deep quiet breath and held it a moment before speaking.
Watson laughed. “Or lunch.”
Sherlock moaned softly. The Captain gave it a tug, then pushed it back in hard, making him cry out.
Sherlock bent down and kissed him deeply, savoring the feel of being joined together. John was right; it felt completely different from this side of things, but wonderful.
John paused beside Sherlock, nervously traced circles in the tabletop. “I wondered if you’d like to come back to bed.
“Not something I’m going to want every day, but sometimes, if that’s okay?”
John fisted a hand in Sherlock’s curls and drew him upright by his hair, quickly bound Sherlock’s forearms together in front of him and marched him into the living room. “We have ourselves a stowaway!” the Captain announced gleefully, as though to his crew.
Sherlock blinked and took the room in as if seeing it for the first time. There were fresh sheets and a stack of towels on the chair. John hadn’t gone. John had prepared. He was staying. Sherlock could feel the prickling well of tears in the corners of his eyes. He hated this, hated the near hysteria that seized him, making him honestly weep.
“Yes, I’m really here. I’m home.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around John as though he’d found a lifeboat after days and days of treading water.
John pulled a bottle of slick from the bedside table and let his towel drop to the floor. He coated his fingers and lay back on the bed.
John nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck, breathing in the scent of him. “Oh, I’ll certainly do that,” he said as his hand palmed Sherlock’s cock. He took another steadying breath. “You truly want this? With me?”
John walked away to the bedroom. He set the dagger on the dresser, retrieved lube, and set out a series of insertables of various sizes. He planned to let the rest of the crew have a go with Sherlock until he begged for mercy or John’s arm gave out, and that required a bit of variety for believability.
In his mind’s eye, John could almost make the bedding into barrels and flour sacks. There was a quick movement and he cried out, “Hey, there! What’s this? A stowaway?” John reached in and tugged Sherlock’s hair roughly until he knelt on the bed. “Not on my vessel. Out three weeks to sea already. You’ve clearly been stealing our stores to have lasted this long-- even if you do look a bit skin and bones. You ought to be thrown overboard for your thievery.”
John emerged and went through his usual routine of getting comfortable: setting aside shoes, hanging up his coat. He cleared his throat and looked at Sherlock, uncertainty clouding his features. “You know, I’ve never done this before.”
The Captain smiled wickedly. “I think I will, but I claim the right of rank and I’ll have you first.” He picked up the dagger again, and held it to the stowaway’s throat. “You heard me. Wasn’t a request, laddie. I’ll not be asking you again.”
It felt better than good. Perhaps bordering on miraculous.. Amazing enough that he wasn’t even embarrassed about the little moans and whimpers he was making into John’s mouth as they kissed, enjoying the warmth and friction, John’s cock heavy and hard against him. If it was this good still fully clothed he could hardly wait to feel John skin to skin.
Sherlock’s cock was leaking onto the sheets below. His legs began to tremble and he clamped down. Heat pooled in John’s groin as his own cock began to thicken. He could usually make Sherlock come at least once before he was hard again, but he wasn’t so sure today.
Sherlock touched the wound on his shoulder shivering at the heady mix of pain and pleasure that even the brush of his own fingertips brought. John had marked him. Marked, yes, but he hadn’t claimed, not truly.
“Holmes, I-- I’m sorry. I should have listened when you said you wished to be alone. I was worried about you. I thought you were ill. Although...” He paused, peeking over his shoulder at me, his countenance at once sly and wary. “If you still wanted help…”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John exclaimed, burying his free hand in Sherlock’s curls.
John leaned forward and reached down to grip Sherlock’s throbbing cock loosely, then didn’t move, making Sherlock work for it. For several long minutes, Sherlock teased himself, filling his own mouth, his arse, and now masturbating in John’s hand, not quite tight enough for him to get off, until his eyes brimmed with tears. His groans vibrated along John’s cock. He was so beautiful when he was this used. Wrung out and desperate, Sherlock whimpered in frustration, loving the attention, but trying to communicate how much he needed to come.
Sherlock looked up, alarmed.
Sherlock wriggled against him, “So full, John,” he moaned, stroking a hand over his slightly distended belly.
Everything about Sherlock’s body language shut John out. It hurt, but he had no real choice but to honor his wishes. He kept trying not to think of it, blocking out the specifics of what Sherlock had said, but that did nothing to alleviate the dull ache left in their wake.
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
It had simply happened. And things were going exceedingly well.
I must confess I looked up at him then, as shy as any bride, but nodded slightly.
“Greedy for it, are you?” John laughed.
He curled forward onto John’s chest groaning out his name.
He undressed quickly, slipped into bed beside me and did not hesitate to take me in hand. I drew in a shuddering breath and groaned at the warmth of his touch, his breath on my neck, the heady knowledge that Watson himself was touching me.
It wasn’t exactly a denial. He didn’t sound offended. Curious perhaps, as to what gave it away? That was all right, then. “You glance at my lips more than you do with other people, you stand closer to me than you do to others as well. You describe attractive men as floridly as you do women on your blog. I saw you checking out our waiter’s arse the other night, which is barely worth noting as it isn’t actually an unusual occurrence regardless of their gender. But mostly,” Sherlock paused,  “I can hear you through the vent.”
John cleared his throat. “And, um, what makes you sure that I am?”
They were really doing this, though if pressed, Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to say precisely what “this” was.
“You have me, Watson,” I panted, “ I am yours.”
Sherlock whimpered and tried to push back, but he was held firmly in place.
John hummed appreciation and stroked him again. “I think we should keep that mouth of his busy too.” He grabbed a large silicone cock with a suction cup base and mounted it against the headboard before dragging Sherlock over to it.
John’s cock throbbed harder at Sherlock’s words. “Yes, Sherlock. All of it, yes.”
“Good lad,” the Captain praised. He pulled the plug out and slicked a mid sized dildo, and tucked the bottle under his arm to warm. He’d need a bit of recovery time, but there was no reason to let Sherlock cool down. He held the toy at the right angle and pushed it in slowly.
There were those who argued that omegas should be sequestered the week before their cycle. Lawyers who would talk down the sentences of anyone who leapt on them at the first whiff of heat. ‘What were they thinking going out smelling like that’ and the like. It was demeaning and controlling and John had gotten into more than one fistfight over omega rights. Besides, what alpha (who wasn’t a complete barbarian) went out without a little vial of menthol or camphor or some special blend of oils they fancied for the job. There wasn’t a pheromone in existence that couldn’t be drowned out with one of those. Cleared the sinuses nicely, too.
“Lovely,” Captain Watson breathed, barely audibly, and Sherlock relaxed, sighing and arching up into the touch.
“You weren’t here. I woke up and you…”
Sherlock blinked up at him, “But you haven’t…”
Watson looked at me, a question in his eyes and I nodded, though to what I was agreeing I truly couldn’t have said. I hadn’t even attempted to deduce it, just along for whatever my dear Watson had in mind.
My pleasure built as I watched him, the warmth of his body beside me, the weight of his gaze on me and the memory of his hands spurred me on. At last, with the thought that he was
Sherlock stopped laughing and looked at John. “But what about all those little homemaker omegas you pursued? I know Sarah couldn’t wait to have a brood. The next alpha she dated had her bonded and bred in a cycle.”
He whirled around, thinking he’d have to apologise for shouting and instead stopped stock still, just staring.
“There, there. Almost done now. Take your captain one more time.”
“Holmes, are you ill? Let me help you.”
When the swollen knot finally receded enough to allow them to separate, John watched in rapt fascination as Sherlock’s gaping hole fluttered closed, an obscene trickle of white running out onto the sheets. He reached out, instinct guiding him to push as much as possible back into his omega’s arse.
Sherlock’s eyes shone bright with emotion in the dim light of the room. “I love you too. I tried to say it that day on the roof, but I couldn’t. Not knowing I had to jump. I wasn’t sure I’d ever make it back to you. Of the ninety most likely scenarios there were only nine in which you loved me back and in seven of those you were much more likely to punch me in the face than to kiss me when I returned. I’m glad you kissed me, John.”
Some days he couldn’t believe he’d stayed at Baker Street, but he needed familiarity, even if it would never quite felt like home again. He took off his shoes and hung his jacket, shivering slightly. It had generally been a mild winter, but he should light a fire in a bit. Even that little effort sounded exhausting. Tea first.
Sherlock glanced up from his experiment, taking in John’s damp tousled hair and the towel, low slung about his hips.
John chuckled. “Think you’ve worn me out for anything else already. I’m not twenty anymore.”
“It’s more intense with you watching me.” John looked at him through lowered lashes and, taking in Sherlock’s questioning expression and added, “It’s better.”
Sherlock was no fool. He wasn’t domestic, wasn’t likely to feed John up, clean the flat, make a decent nest. He had no interest in being bred and never had. Well, outside of that hormone addled heat state where it always sounded good and right and possibly even necessary. Was that it? The omegas John had seen before wanted all that. So John must too.
“Like that idea?” John chuckled darkly. “So do I,” he murmured, taking the plug and sliding it in place.
“Holmes, I am your friend and your doctor. If I do not attend you, who would? You do not seem well, my dear fellow. Please.” He clasped my shoulder with a gentle shake. “What’s gotten into you?”
“God, that’s perfect.”
“Oh?” Sherlock cocked a brow at him. Clearly there was more to this or John would just have started kissing and steered them back to the bedroom. It wouldn’t have been the first time by far.
He lay down on the couch, propped up on one elbow with a kind of forced casualness, belied by the racing of his heart, as he waiting for John to ascend the last few stairs.
John smiled. “I hope it’s alright.”
There was something wrong, but Sherlock was adamant. He was fine. He just needed rest.
Sherlock texted Lestrade under the table as he strung the killer along further in conversation, buying time for the arrest.
Nor, John noticed with delight, had his erection flagged.
Despite the awkwardness, they were invited in. The suspect offered them tea, which they declined saying they would only be a moment as they had a few more leads to check on. Of course they weren’t going to drink anything he served them, given that he had absolutely been the one to poison the deceased.
When his orgasm subsided, John stared fondly down at Sherlock. His eyes were watering, but as his breathing returned to normal, he smiled shyly and licked his lips.
Sherlock hummed contented acknowledgement. They should clean up, but for now it was enough to lie here, in John’s arms “Love you, too,” he murmured dreamily as John stroked his hair.
“What was that back there, hmm?”
“Oh God, love. I’m so sorry. You were so peaceful and I knew we’d need a few things, so I-”
John’s eyes widened fractionally more before he sighed in relief and leaned in. He cupped the back of Sherlock’s head, pulling him in for a deep kiss that left them both breathless. As the cab pulled up to the kerb, they reluctantly parted.
Sherlock felt lightheaded. Giddy, even. When he had dared think of such things at all, (and there was no sense lying about it, that had been rather often) he had come up with at least sixteen scenarios where John huffily went for some air or even stayed a few nights with Harry while he adjusted. There was one, however unlikely to occur, in which he flat-out left, which was too horrifying to contemplate for more than a minute altogether. In seven further scenarios, he simply went to his room and the next morning carried on as normal that day and thereafter, but never spoke of it again. Sherlock had barely let himself think on the (thirteen) ways things played out more positively and certainly hadn’t had the conscious intention to attempt any of them today.
Sherlock whimpered and shivered, but Captain Watson only chuckled darkly and nudged Sherlock’s legs apart and began his next series of blows to Sherlock’s arse and thighs.
They kissed again, slow and languid. It was heaven.
He wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s throat lightly, not choking really, but fueling the sense of menace and danger. God, he could feel his cock through Sherlock’s throat, the flesh pressing up against his palm as he thrust deep. It was too much. He held him in place and came hard as Sherlock sputtered and flailed.
“Just shaken up. Did he—did he tell you about…” He hesitated. “About the tumor…coming back?”
“I’ll go to the starboard side—the right—and meet you at the bow—the front. Fletcher should be at the wheel in the back.”
Nothing happens.
“Ready to start again John?” she asked gently. She sat down and restarted the recorder.
Sherlock gasped. He looked at John, but he was already asleep. He rushed forward and pressed his masked mouth over John’s hand in a hard kiss, and then turned on his heel and left, discarding the plastic gown, gloves, and mask as he headed back to Scotland Yard.
“Really?” John stepped forward, but then stopped. His voice was more stable but slow, as if he was thinking carefully what to say. “Because you seem distant.”
“Sherlock…” John’s voice was strained, and Sherlock paled from the sound of his tone; he shouldn’t be sounding scared.
“John…” Sherlock voice was deeper and his eyes were glistening slightly. His chin trembled slightly, and he moved his hand up slowly before resting on top of John’s.
Several minutes passed and turned into excruciating moments of uncertainty.
John retched again, and leaned heavily against Sherlock’s shoulder. Margaret removed the broken IV tube, and then reattached the line to the new one in his hand. She then placed a stethoscope in her ears and placed the end on John’s back. Regina fell silent, and Sherlock held John still has he breathed in ragged breathes.
After another pull, the mask slipped off, revealing another unknown man.
“Lestrade’s sending the employee list,” Sherlock reported. John hummed in response and finished with the dishes. He walked back into the sitting room to find Sherlocks starring at the screen unblinking.
Liev shrugged. “I think his first name is Jacob. I’ve heard people refer to him by nicknames, like Gold, or M.M.”
Sherlock smiled softly and leaned the rest of the way to meet John’s lips. Sherlock kissed him and picked up the pace after a moment, and then he pushed forward until John was lying back down on his back. Sherlock lay on top of him and restarted the kiss, trailing from his lips to his jaw and neck.
John nodded his gratitude but furrowed his brows. He looked at Sherlock, and parted his mouth, but he quickly realized he couldn’t remember the word. He hummed with annoyance and furrowed his eyebrows tighter. Sherlock looked at him sympathetically, but didn’t say anything right way, giving John time to prepare his thoughts and actions, and therefore not making the situation anymore embarrassing than it was for John.
“Do you need—,”
“I’ll clean myself up. Do you need me to stay?” he asked carefully.
John winced awake, and noticed he was in a different room. His bed was on the right side of the room, the door on his left. The room was larger, with a small window on his right, and a closet. The bathroom was in front of him, and there was only one reclining chair in the corner.
Sven shoved John against the pillar before the army doctor could speak, and knocked his head hard against it. He was knocked out cold.
Harry let out a shaky breath and then spoke. “Please…” She hesitated, looking for the right words. “Promise me you’ll make sure he doesn’t get hurt.”
John chuckled and stood behind the detective. He leaned forward and pressed his nose into Sherlock’s hair, only to stop and lean back.
The army doctor stood up suddenly and charged at Sherlock, splashing water in his wake, but only to be painfully halted by his cuffed hand. He glared at Sherlock. “If you don’t care for me at all, then uncuff me and let me go. It won’t matter if I get myself killed. It seems you don’t have any use of me anyway.” He looked down, breathing deeply to control his frustration.
John tilted his head up and looked at Sherlock. “Apparently it’s rubbing off on you.”
Mycroft eyed him with pity. “So now what? Wait until you get back? Perhaps you should think that through—.”
[Harry’s a nurse in this universe]
“Wait, has he woken up?”
Sherlock glanced up, catching a sudden blush rising on John’s cheek.
“I’m trying on a prosthetic tomorrow,” John said.
“Sorry, I—,” Sherlock stuttered.
“I managed to hit my head against Stan, knocking him out, and escape. The binding ties weren’t exactly made by a professional…I headed upstairs and heard voices talking. Now that I think about it, I heard Moran’s voice. I snuck past them, and then just ran. I decided to go to Sumatra Road, because I hoped Sherlock would be there, and I figured there was something there, since the doppelganger told me to. And so that’s where I found Sherlock and Mary, but Stan must have made it there before me, cause he was unconscious in the corner.”
John flinched; Sherlock seemed offended by the offer. John wasn’t sure why he would feel that way. He fiddled himself this time, focusing on the unraveling bits of the alabaster blanket
“Don’t need it yet. I’ll just hum.”
Victor smiled, and John started to realize it was a little bit of a sad one. “The nurse, Vanessa, is my sister. She told me you saw the visitor log and made an assumption—a hasty one, mind you. I can explain,” Victor paused. John processed everything so far, and then gave him a slight nod for him to continue.
He hung up and then Sherlock put his phone away. He stared at the darkened street; the crowds of passerby’s increasing further down the street. He got lost in though, recalling on the past few months, and broke out of his reverie when he felt strong hands encircle around his waist.
“I love you, too.”
John nodded. “Alright. And you?”
John peaked his eyes open. They were glazed over with unshed tears, and begging.
John’s face transformed from utter loss to a canvas of sentiment Sherlock could not, for the first time, fathom into a word.
“And I’m just a man in a pub,” the man repeated, grinning flirtatiously. Sherlock looked down his form from head to toe. He was short, toned, not over weight or skinny but average. This man was just average. But something caught the detective’s eye. The man’s eyes were radiating in the center, but a tired dullness creased the edges of his pupils. The brown and green glimmered together, with blue around the center. He was confident, but desperate for something Sherlock couldn’t place a name to. It was like he was taking one last attempt, looking for something—or someone—to make him feel alive again, even just for one night. Sherlock decided to bring him to his flat for the night, and told himself that this was just for one night. He didn’t usually care for anyone’s problems—he still doesn’t, but this man in front of him seemed to be an expectation. Just for the night, though.
“He’s dead, stop lying to me!” John scrambled out of bed and walked to the wall until he was face to face with Sherlock.
“No.”
Sherlock nodded. John squeezed his hand and in return Sherlock squeezed back. Just then, Sherlock’s phone rang. Rolling his eyes, the detective answered.
John scoffed. “I don’t feel like it.”
John’s heart rate slowly rose, but it was there nonetheless. Sherlock stilled and looked up. He rushed forwards and stood closer to John’s side.
“Do something!” Sherlock commanded, his voice not sounding like him at all.
“Sherlock—”
“So you’re alive.”
John’s eyes prickled with hurt and he blinked rapidly to clear them away. He shouldn’t feel disappointed in Sherlock’s reaction; he had gotten the prosthetic for himself anyway. Hadn’t he? Now John wasn’t entirely sure. Sherlock wanted him to go on cases again, so why was he being shut out?
“You jumped. For me? And now you’re—”
Sherlock sat up and lifted himself into his chair before leaving to go to the bathroom. Upon entering the hallway, he stopped in his tracks to find John slouched over by Sherlock’s door, a book opened in his lap and his head lolling to the side. His eyes were closed, and he was breathing slow and deeply, completely asleep on the floor.
“You fell asleep while I kissed you. Not really sure where your charming nickname comes from.”
“I’m…asking you, because I’m…” He glanced up and quickly looked away. “Concerned about you.”
“I’ll wake you up with a kiss,” Sherlock promised.
“I had a thought that…what if you...began to miss it. What if it’s not me you love but the hallucin—.”
“Oh, hi! How can I help you?”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Oh. Hm…”
The allusion huffed out a laugh. “What? Are you just going to ignore me—?”
gravesite, pretending to be a ghost—I-I didn’t realize you knew that I was seeing things before then. You showed up and I wanted to know why but you knew it would work because you saw me—oh my god, you knew! You were right there, watching me and didn’t come back to me sooner! When I needed you the most! Is that what you were talking about? What you hadn’t told me? What else haven’t you told me?” John threw questions at the detective, his eyes glaring.
“I’ve missed you…” he started.
“He doesn’t need to know.”
“Body washed up on shore,” Sherlock said as he started to walk around the body, without giving Lestrade a chance to speak. “Clothes soaked, skin wrinkled enough, I’d say he’d been in the water for at least twenty-four hours. The leg is missing, but there isn’t any more blood coming out, so cause of death could be he bleed to death, or he drowned first, but John?”
“—Hang on, Sherlock—.” John’s cheeks burned and he lowered his head, directing his gaze to their feet. His right leg started to feel sore, and a familiar phantom pain was tingling beneath his skin. He hadn’t felt that since the boat accident, and feeling it now just before the wedding disappointed John. He had thought he had moved on almost completely.
John lifted himself higher just as the water rose over his chest. He spluttered some of it and looked at Sherlock, who was looking at him with wide eyes.
“I’m fine. It’s just a cut,” John rasped, his eyes wide as he stared at Sherlock.
“You have a case, Sherlock,” John started. Sherlock turned to him, furrowed his eyebrows slightly before relaxing his face. John tensed; Sherlock’s face was unemotional, and the way he looked at John was like the way he had looked at him when they first met—although it seemed colder now.
“Well it’d be nice to meet some who haven’t committed treason,” Mycroft said sternly. To his dismay, Jack chuckled.
Sherlock scoffed lightly and snuggled closer to John. John wrapped his arms around him and kissed the point of skin where his neck met his collar.
“We can take it to go,” he said as he handed his to him.
A few moments passed before John realized he was holding something. He looked down and saw Sherlock’s gloved hand in his own. He looked up and saw Sherlock’s mouth moving, but it took him a few more moments to hear what he was saying.
“You’re going to be fine.” Sherlock murmured, more to himself than to John. He lifted their intertwined hands and pressed a soft kissed onto John’s. John squeezed back and slowly gained his voice back.
John nodded. “He…I think he was being drugged. Did Lestrade explain it all?”
Sherlock bit his lip, hesitantly, and then he snapped. “I don’t.”
“Well, of course you may hit an obstacle…I have a sniper hiding out somewhere, awaiting my orders. And you have to get to him before he does, then maybe we can talk. Besides, the game hasn’t ended yet.” He had said, grinning maliciously.
“Well I have a question, er, not to do with the case itself, really. Is that all right?”
“Sherlock, look at me.”
“Yes you go do that,” he muttered.
One more chapter after this, sort of an epilogue. :)
John paced around the room, nearly pulling his hair out as he called Sherlock for the umpteenth time. Upon reaching his voicemail, he slammed the phone shut and banged his fists into the table.
Sherlock blinked and focused on John’s face more intently. John squirmed underneath his gaze, feeling his arousal increase again. He wasn’t sure just how long it would take to have a second round, but the feeling wasn’t unwarranted. Sherlock licked his lips, lowered himself over John’s body, and then slowly made his way down—not kissing but merely grazing his skin. He came to a pause by John’s leg, and then wrapped his hand around John’s stump. John felt a pang of nervousness, but he allowed Sherlock to life his leg up and placed it over his shoulder.
Sherlock paused, sensing John inhaling sharply, coming to the conclusion himself.
Swiftly John stood up and nudged himself into Sherlock’s arms. The detective settled his arms around John’s waist and back. They stayed intertwined for several seconds.
! Is that it? Because of this tumor happening, you can’t talk to me anymore?”
Mycroft stepped around him, and nodded. “Only checking in. Good morning Inspector.”
“John—!” Sherlock gasped and picked up his pace. He breathed in large gulps against John’s neck. “Come like this, okay? Is this okay?”
By the time they arrived, it was nearly dark, and Sherlock headed straight to the stairs, but stopped in his tracks when John spoke.
comments are gold, and I am Smaug :)
Sherlock knew deep down—very deep down—it was bound to happen but had almost hoped it wouldn’t, that maybe John would turn out to be like everyone else and declare him a freak.
John swallowed tightly, and looked at his husband. “We need to talk.”
“Pants,” Sherlock said for him. John nodded.
“Sherlock?” John murmured. All his energy was drained from his body, he could barely think of anything else except Sherlock’s wellbeing. He was exhausted physically and emotionally, but he managed to inch closer to Sherlock until he could reach him without straining himself. John lowered his forehead to Sherlock’s shoulder blade and held it there. Sherlock shivered beneath him.
“Do you not…want this?” John asked gently.
“It has some snacks. And a blanket,” John said with a shrug.
“Alright,” John said. “Let’s get you dressed and then fed, mhm?”
“I need to see him—see James, he-he,” John choked and gagged; he coughed up a little bit of vomit, but he didn’t seem to care, or even notice that it had dribbled down his chin. Sherlock wiped it away with a cloth. John grimaced as he tried to sit up; he was too weak he couldn’t even lift his head from the slanted angle of the bed. Sherlock didn’t even have to hold him down. John slouched against the pillow and flickered his eyes around the room frantically.
A yell rang around him as John Watson sat upright in his bed, tangled in his bed sheets. His eyes were wide as he stared out into blackness; they were glazed over and distant for a moment longer before a wave of consciousness hurled over him, softening the hardness of his face just a fraction. The doctor’s breathing quickened its pace as his heart thudded with realization: it was just a dream—a horrendous repeat of the previous night, and the one before that, and the others that came every time he closed his eyes for the past six months.
John’s heart panged and he tightened his hold around Sherlock. He didn’t know what to say, but he knew he wanted to be as close with Sherlock as possible, and knew Sherlock wanted that too.
He really wanted to believe Sherlock—hell, he hoped he was an idiot in this case; it would be far better than the alternative. He just wanted to get this over with.
John furrowed his eyebrows in thought. “You’ve never met though.”
“To a payphone,” she responded. “We have surveillance footage of Stan using the phone, and the records show Watson’s cell number, and vice versa.”
“I am a little warm, yes,” John said. “That’s why I’m nearly stark naked in bed. Don’t get any ideas.” He offered a grin, but Sherlock didn’t fall for it.
“What’s the plan?” John asked.
Harry flinched and looked in front of them. Looking back to John, she continued. “Do you…talk to each other?”
“What, you want to have me all to yourself?” John smiled teasingly.
John gasped as Sherlock wrapped his mouth around the tip of John’s cock, his hand shooting to clutch at Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock began swirling his tongue around his cock, tasting John. As John’s whimpers began growing more frantic, Sherlock placed his tongue at the base of John’s cock, licking upwards in one swift motion. As he placed his right hand underneath John’s balls, cradling them, he placed his left hand on John’s thigh, slightly stroking it. And in one swift motion, Sherlock swallowed down on John’s cock, resulting in a hefty groan from the man. Sherlock sucked, licking his tongue upwards until his reddened lips were at the tip.
John nodded. “It’s just that Sherlock has been forgetting things, still. It’s just small things, except for the case he overlooked something he wouldn’t have missed.”
John lunged forward and hit the door with his shoulder just as it was flung opened. He stumbled inside and fell into Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock clutched his arms and pushed him back upright; John took a moment to gain his balance, holding himself up by clutching the doorframe. He met Sherlock’s eyes, but when he did, the glare directed at him sent a shiver down his spine.
“Yes, you can.”
Sherlock didn’t respond and continued looking around. The room looked like a laboratory, with stainless-steal tables and benches, and pristine tools and chemistry sets. The bags were lined against the brick wall, beside empty wooden boxes with an image of a black apple on the side.
Sherlock blinked up at him, startled. How on earth was he supposed to do that? The wheels of his chair wouldn’t move against the sand, and it’d just be pointless to even try.
“Sherlock…” John trailed off.
Sherlock looked at John in the eye, although he kept his face emotionless.
Sherlock dressed in fresh pajamas, since he was wearing the same ones since yesterday. The only light on was the one on his bedside table, and he flicked it off before lying down.
“You’ve only be unconscious for a few hours,” Sherlock said softly. He continued to trail his fingers through John’s hair, and as he processed this, the touch became comforting.
“Sherlock, it’s under control. No one was serious hurt, but a few had to be taken to the hospital. The left side interrogation rooms received the most of it.”
Sherlock looked up at Moran and hardened his face. “What evidence do you have?”
Before John could lean in for another kiss, there was a knock on the door. They both turned to greet their guest, who sauntered into the room, her face beaming.
After he had left John to research the fairytales, he had realized the connection to Moriarty. It didn’t seem like it had anything to do with burning his heart, like the consulting criminal had planned, but whatever Silken’s motive was, he had connections to Moriarty, and a odd obsession over fairytales—so much to even change his and his recruits’ names.
Dr. Shepherd nodded and remained silent for a moment before speaking. “It’s none of my business, but I had a friend a while back and he said…he said to tell the one you love that you love them.” The doctor smiled to John, his eyes glistening with nostalgia. “He said you tell them, even if you’re scared that it’s not the right thing. Even if it could cause problems. Even if you’re scared that it will burn your life to the ground, you say it, out loud, and then go from there.”
“Can’t deduce that?” John teased. He leaned further, rocking his hips intentionally against Sherlock’s. The detective gasped softly.
John exhaled slowly against Sherlock’s neck, and he basked in this greatly missed affection. He felt like he was falling in love all over again. He was relieved beyond anything else, and felt nearly the most loved than he ever had before—excluding the moments with Sherlock cutting of his leg. John counted that, although he wouldn’t tell Sherlock. He was loved so much by the detective; enough to be held onto too despite the pain he had to go through afterwards. Looking back, it was all worth it—all of it, if it meant he would be in Sherlock’s arms now, and forevermore afterwards.
“We can still go.”
Doctor Grey looked at him with sympathy. “We did everything we could.”
Sherlock cringed slightly. “John,” he started slowly. “You have a fever. You’re in the hospital.”
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “We both know this tumor was going to kill me. It was j-just a m-matter of time. So let me go, all right? I’ll see you when…I’ll see you after. And you’ll be real. It’ll be Sherlock, not
John sat down in front of the desk and looked at the doctor. “No, that case is just about finished. That’s not why I’m here…”
Victor seemed to ponder for a moment, and then smiled. “For being patient with him. For never leaving him. And, for forgiving him. I know some things he’s done, and that is what I admire about you, John. That after all this time, you still want him.”
“35 degrees.”
A figure appeared at the foot of the stairs, and raced up. Sherlock immediately knew it wasn’t John, and hurried to his bedroom. He slammed the door and locked it, and then rushed to the window. The smoke was thick in his room, and he tried to open the window, but couldn’t reach the lock.
Sherlock straightened up, raising his hands onto the plastic as if willing them to move. “John. John, look at me.”
“What are we looking at so far?” A doctor inquired to the others.
John shrugged. “It doesn’t hurt to branch out. Besides, the new one is more expensive.”
Sherlock swallowed tightly, and reached for the railing, as if he was going to stand up and walk up the stairs.
The man grimaced but kept his gaze on the detective. “Out of all the places in London and I run into you on my first day of work.”
“Sorry, sorry, I’m—,” Sherlock started.
Sherlock shrugged. “You know this day is only important to me because it is to you. You had to work, I didn’t mind.”
“I can’t wait.”
“Dr. Watson, can you tell me who you were talking to?” The man asked.
get involved; sentiment gets in the way—the need to
“They lost sight of you when the explosion blocked their view. They’re scouting the area now.”
John sighed again, feeling a tingle of boredom starting to grow. He didn’t want to sleep more than he needed to. His breakfast wouldn’t arrive for an hour at least, but even by then, John doubted he would be hungry.
Sherlock wheeled to see it closer. “Where does it lead to?”
John furrowed his eyebrows for a second. “Dashwood? The doctor who’s missing?”
“I think,” He continued slowly. “That you don’t love
Sherlock stared at John. “I just—.”
“How can it be?” Sherlock asked harshly. “I did this—,”
Other than that, here you go!
“Why don’t you just let him take me?” John asked, ignoring the appalled eyes Sherlock shot at him for saying that.
Sherlock huffed in response. “Clearly to someone, it is.”
“Damn. Bag him, start compressions, and begin a central line of warm fluids. He can’t have surgery until his heart beats on its own and he is warm.”
He stood in front of the door and didn’t move. John raised an eyebrow.
John started to protest. “You didn’t hurt me—”
“You’ve been sick. No wonder you haven’t visited,” Sherlock said, surprised at himself that his voice hadn’t cracked.
Sherlock blinked and focused on John. “I’m fine, yes. Will you just open it already.”
“Nah, you barely know me.” The confidence was back, developing in a charming grin on the man’s face.
The door opened and Mary stepped in, her face serious and withdrawn.
Sherlock pulled the dinghy up against the large boat and quickly shut off the engine just as John grabbed hold of the railing. He quickly stood and pulled himself up as the sailboat pulled the dinghy along with it. John pulled himself and managed to place his feet on the small walkway that bordered the sailboat. Still in the dinghy, Sherlock drifted away and then disappeared around the other side. John quickly and quietly headed to the front, wary of the slippery ground.
“You should have stayed one more day,” Sherlock pointed out. John shook his head, dismissing his comment.
“Tomato. John how’s your head?”
John laughed weakly and nodded. He lifted himself out of the chair and took a step before he could stabilize the crutches on the floor, and before Sherlock could grasp his belt. His leg crumbled beneath him and he fell onto the floor, catching himself on his knees and with his palms.
Sherlock nodded. He was seated in his armchair, cup of tea in hand. It had been a rough morning, but everything seemed to have calmed down for now. John sat in front of him in his own chair, reading the paper, and looking bothered by something. Sherlock didn’t want to ask until he figured it out himself. It was a decent distraction.
John inhaled a ragged breath and held it, but exhaled too soon and the breathing returned to its too rapid pace. Sherlock stood and settled on John’s bed. Before he could suggest trying it again, John practically lunged at him and clutched at his dress shirt tightly in his fists. He buried his face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck. A couple of minutes passed and John’s breathing was returning back to normal, slow but improving.
“It’s fine. I’ll take that as answer,” Willoughby kindly said. “Finally, the words I told you to remember?”
“Well there’s not much left to go on is there? Besides, I barely got a good look of him. He could easily wear a disguise. How did you find him?”
John smiled weakly at Sherlock’s offer. He raised his hand and trailed his finger along Sherlock’s cheek, only for Sherlock to flinch away. Sherlock covered it up by settling back in his chair, but by the way he was avoiding John’s gaze, something was wrong.
“John Watson?” The man spoke up. Sherlock eyed him carefully, realizing his face was eerily familiar.
“Of course not—.”
John nodded absently, distracted by his concern for Sherlock. Just as the doctor left, his nausea worsened, and he was shivering. Sherlock laid out another blanket and fiddled with it until John stopped shivering, and then hovered by his bed, holding a bucket, but remained silent the entire time.
Mary grinned. “And you must be Sherlock Holmes, the man who’s been fucking my husband.”
“Just like that?”
John sighed with obvious relief and stood up. Mary narrowed her eyes. “So it’s really him?”
John clutched at Sherlock, tugging at the detective scarf. His breathing was ragged with settle gurgling sounds.
John paused and the anger dissipated. He started to grin, and looked at Rosie.
“Sherlock,” John groaned. “Touch me.”
“I can’t.” John moaned. “Unless…I leave—.”
“Kingston is barely involved. He wants a deal, and he’ll locate this Jacob Gold, who’s like Silken’s puppet. We find Jacob, we’ll find Silken.”
They held each other, for several hours, and when they got home hours later, they held on for a many more, falling back into their unexpected routine, loving each other more than ever.
.” Mycroft repeated sternly.
Sherlock bowed his head, but he kept his eyes on John.
Mycroft left, leaving Sherlock holding the incriminating photographs. He clenched his fist and inhaled deeply. John was no way involved in this. After all this time, he would not lie to Sherlock. There must be an explanation. There has to be.
“How’s your arm feeling?” the nurse asked gently.
“John?”
“You all right?”
John sat still in the uncomfortable plastic chair. His new therapist, Dr. Smith, was in front of him, keeping his eyes on John. It had been almost an hour already, and like every session John had had in the past two weeks at this place, he remained quiet.
