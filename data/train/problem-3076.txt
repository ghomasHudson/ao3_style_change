“Your house isn’t my home,” Dean said. “We’re getting a divorce. This dump is my father’s house, which is where an Omega goes when he’s getting a divorce.”
When they got back to the old house, Bobby dropped by, bringing them a few necessary groceries. He also handed Dean a gun. It was a sawn off shot gun, far more serious firepower than Castiel would have expected coming from the kindly old man.
“Oh,” Sam said, shaking his shoulders and lowering his fists, settling down just like he ought to. He held a hand out to Castiel. “No offense. Dean gets hassled more than he should. An Alpha ought to respect an Omega’s wish not to be importuned or courted.”
“I’m worried about Hannah, Brother,” Amelia said. “I thinks she harbors resentment against Dean.”
“St. Carver’s?” Castiel asked. That was exactly the school that he was going to recommend that Sam try for. If Sam could do well there, it would allow him to write his own ticket to nearly any university in the country, even the Ivies. It was impressive he won a scholarship as they did not offer many.
Chuck, his father and their pack Alpha, had been weak ever since Raphael’s coup and not fit for leadership anymore. He had started talking about retirement rather than waiting for his death for leadership to change. It should have been the right time for a smooth transition to Michael as the pack Alpha. But Michael had been. Castiel could hardly dare think it. He had been corrupted. He had been suborned by one of the Grigori. He had become one of them, just as any Alpha could. He had become one who fed on souls. Seven of the weaker pack members had died before he’d been caught. Chuck wasn’t able to put him down, but had rallied enough of his council around him to drive Michael off and out of the main village of the pack lands. Michael still lingered though, on the fringes. That was why Castiel was returning home. As the oldest Alpha son still on the pack rolls, he was now the heir, something he had never expected, what with how many older brothers he had.
Dean took the seat opposite his Alpha.
Dean got up, pulled the sling off the hanger. It was faded, a little stale, but the sling still smelled of her, his sweet baby. He held it to his face and sniffed deeply, feeling a little comforted. He pulled his pack woven blanket over him, lying down, hugging that stupid baby carrier, made for him by his brother. He was suddenly aware of missing not just his Clairebear, but Sam and maybe even everything about being back on pack lands. He missed Bobby and Ellen and even little Jo. Bobby’s comfortable house all packed full of old books. Was it even possible to be homesick when you were at home? At home in your own bedroom?
“The morning after the full moon, I’d asked you about Dean’s things, that went missing. I haven’t heard that they’ve been found. They were put into your care and they went missing. Then I specifically tasked you with finding them and they haven’t been. It’s very disappointing, Hannah.”
“I watched meat on a grill a few minutes. Dean did everything else,” Jimmy said. As he put the platter on the table with the other food, Castiel and Amelia took chairs around the table. Jimmy held out his hands for the blessing over the food. This time, they were silent in their communion with the bountiful Goddess who provided for them. There was a fresh tomato salad and a mashed sweet potato dish and even freshly made rolls, along with a mushroom sauce to be served over the venison. The food was amazing, as if made by someone who truly loved to eat, who loved good food.
“Bean! Bean! Bean!” She cried happily as she exploded through the kitchen door. “Where you been, Bean?”
Dean opened his mouth and closed down. A stream of warm, nutty, sweet milk flowed in. Dean swallowed deeply wanting more. Without words, Cas showed him how to suckle effectively, taking more of the tit than just the nipple in, compressing the tit to make the flow fast and deep. It was the best thing he'd ever remembered feeling. He was content, rested, full and happy. At this moment, he wanted for nothing. No one was asking anything of him other than to take something that was freely given. It felt like, he hardly dared think it, much less say it- love.
Dean fell asleep still on top of Cas, still mounted on him, still tied up. He woke in bright morning light, which was a bit of a shock. He’d yet to be in his bedroom when it was mid-morning like this. Normally, he was up before the crack of dawn and moving while it was still dark. That was just the life.
Nothing else in the world mattered at that moment. With the nurse’s help, he was able to hold her, his heart melting as he looked into her strangely wise little face, damp, dark curls covering her head. There could be no doubt that this was Castiel’s child- she had his cleft chin and prominent cheekbones and even just minutes old, she smelled of him, an overlay of that forest and thunderstorm scent that was so perfect. Dean looked at Castiel and saw that the Alpha was staring with rapt attention at them both, love, adoration clear on his face. Castiel’s hand was laid lightly on the baby’s back. Dean’s fingers were just touching Castiel’s.
Dean thought he’d fall asleep right away. He was exhausted after the long night drive, even though he’d slept quite a big. Car hours of sleep only count as half hours, really, Dean thought. He didn’t fall asleep though. He stared at his phone. It wasn’t much use to him here. They really were far from the city. He didn’t get so much as a single bar of reception. He stared at the lit up screen, looking at the last words from the woman who now had Castiel’s phone number. U ok? No, he never would be okay again. He’d been abandoned by the Alpha that should have been his mate.
Dean shouldn’t have let anger control him but he did. He pulled the trigger on the big gun, shocked at how loud it was, how strong the kickback. Not that he hadn’t fired the Colt before but it was different standing in a pasture shooting at a fence post, calm, ready and prepared. If he’d been more in control of himself, maybe the shot wouldn’t have gone off so wide, but it did. It just winged Azazel, scraping a flesh wound on the man’s upper arm that bled great drops of blood down his arm, but didn’t really seem to hurt him that much. Far from a killing blow. Seconds later, while the boom was still ringing in Dean’s ears, hoof beats came up from behind.
“I wish the circumstances were not what they are,” he said, thinking mostly of the traumas all around him that would have to be healed, the wounds to be bandaged as best they could.
He worried about Charlie, at home alone now, probably thinking about the Alpha that had abused her with calming pheromones. She’d seemed okay when he’d dropped her at home, but Dean wouldn’t have been okay with the situation that she’d described. It was one thing to ask an Alpha to calm you, but Charlie’s situation was something else entirely. He felt more in awe of her than ever, that she’d had the ability to reach out and be there for him after all she’d gone through.
“I’m okay,” Dean said. “Just want to get out of here.”
Inside of him, his little one was starting to dance again, delicate little taps. “She’s moving again,” Dean said and thought he’d done it half a hundred times already that day and every day, Castiel put his hand on the stretched wool knit fabric of Dean’s bathing costume and he felt Dean’s belly. In turn, the life inside Dean moved so that he was being kicked from the inside right where Castiel touched him.
Dean was stunned silent as he followed Castiel to the elevator lobby, then up to their room, which was right at the top of the public floors of the hotel and must have been pretty close to the top of the building. The suite was cool and dimly lit, with sheer curtains over floor to ceiling windows on two sides. They walked into a living room area with a couch and chairs, a desk that looked like it was set up for someone to plug a laptop in and go to work and a wet bar to the side, complete with one of those little wine refrigerators. Through an open door into the next room, Dean could see a big bed piled high with fluffy white comforters and pillows. Castiel stepped up to the windows and pulled back the curtains a little. The skyline of the city sparkled and glittered, it seemed, lights bright in the velvet darkness.
“Ain’t taking no Omega over to the Territories on his own,” the Ferry man said.
“Hey, not that I object, but is something up?” Dean asked.
Despite everything, despite his best intentions, despite not wanting to enjoy this, Castiel couldn’t help himself. He started moving inside Dean and it was a rush of pleasure, a shock of electricity building in him faster than it ever had before. Only a few minutes of it and his body was tensing, then spasming as he came, pouring come into Dean’s receptive places. His knot was growing, filling, something he didn’t notice until he tried to pull out but couldn’t. It was more blessed relief and release of tension than ecstasy, but the deed was done. There had been something like pleasure but no joy in the act. They had consummated and whatever came next, no one could take Dean away from him except Dean himself.
“I thought I was doing the right thing. I didn’t realize.”
She smiled at Dean, then punched the mullet dude in the upper arm, “You are such a softy, Ash. You can’t pick up every stray along the highway.”
“There isn’t any question of that,” Castiel said. “Of course I claim her as my child and if Dean will let me, I hope I can win him back and win his trust and the trust of your family.”
They stared at each other a moment. They stared until the point where it was uncomfortable, like Novak’s blue eyes were boring wells down deep into Dean’s soul. The man didn’t even seem to blink. Then Dean held out his hand. “We have a deal then? Be ready to ride. We’ll leave first light.”
Castiel weighed the risks of letting him go for the moment. Jimmy and Amelia had assured him many times that this Charlie was not just a suitable friend for Dean, but one who had provided Dean with much help and comfort. He felt only just barely capable of keeping a lid on his own emotions, of shoving his inner Alpha into the container labeled ‘civilized human being.’ On the other hand, he gauged the risk that the Men of Letters pack would steal Dean off the streets, kidnapping him, on the idea that possession being so many points of the law and that if Dean was allowed to run wild, he was not properly mated. He decided that they would not dare. If they had dared such a thing, they wouldn’t have bothered with the court system, they would have just taken Dean. Doing such would be as good as an open declaration of war. If they dared that, he would not be standing in the hallway of the county courthouse. He would be readying himself for battle. He almost wished they would. He definitely wanted to kill something. He wanted an excuse to let go, to let slip his inner Alpha.
“I’m sorry. I have to go. I wanted to stay with you, I really did, but duty calls. I’m sorry to leave you like this. I know it’s cowardly of me to take my leave with a note, but I don’t know how to say goodbye to you.
When he was done with everything and cleaned up as best he could, he wandered back into the big room, fully intending to go back to Castiel’s bed. Jody was at her post, as expected. The room wasn’t fully dark now that his eyes had adjusted, but was warmly and softly lit by the golden glow of the wards at the roofline. Garth had the watch over the smoke hole right now. It was funny. You wouldn’t think an awkward, skinny as a bean pole dude like him would be trusted like that. He looked like a stiff breeze would knock him over, but everyone spoke of him as if he was one of the most bad ass of the Alphas in the pack, perhaps second only to the Alphas on the council.
“Yes, quite a lot of it,” Castiel said. “Sometimes we have to make agreements to be friendly even if would rather not, for the sake of peace between our packs. The MacLeod’s pack lands abut ours to the west and south. We need good terms between us.”
“Yes, that’s right,” Castiel answered. Dean opened his mouth in surprise, then shut it again. He knew that’s how things worked, but he wasn’t quite ready for feeling like they were talking about him as if he wasn’t even there.
“I’m an Omega. He’s my Alpha. We’re mated. Of course we’re having sex if he wants it. It’s not like I get a vote.”
“I’ve never wanted anything else like I’ve wanted you,” Dean said. “You’re it for me. I was gone the minute I saw you in that bar, even before you opened your mouth.”
“I doubt that,” Novak said, reaching to untie his Pinto. The horse was tough looking, big boned but wiry, as if built for long rides, but it had a gentle eye and a soft look to his mouth. It was a horse Dean liked the look of, would have bought it for the ranch if he could. The Marshal asked, “I see no horse. How are you going to ride out, if you have no horse?”
“Hey, Red,” he said. “My guy and me are going riding. Can you saddle up my best girl for me and Orion for Cas?”
She was gentle as she helped him lie back on the table and spread his legs. She pulled a pair of socks out of a cabinet and helped him pull them on. She gave him a medical gown- the first kind of clothing he'd had in hours. And as she finally got down to examining him, she explained everything in a soft, deep voice as she touched him here and there. She tugged and pulled out the plug from him. She dropped it into the trash.
Before this movie, he’d started earning a little more money with the films, a little more money from the shows. It still hadn’t seemed enough to support an Omega, so he had kept putting off going back to find Dean and court him. In fact, he hadn’t known what exactly would feel like he could offer enough.
They were negotiating the purchase, wearing and eventual sale of a pearl and lace thong panty when Castiel suddenly saw it- the slight roundedness of Dean’s belly, the faint darker line down the middle of it, the way that Dean’s nipples seemed darker.
He’d introduced Dean with the Pack leader honorific. Just a few words difference but all the difference in the world. He’d been called Dean of Novak Pack. Castiel could have introduced him as just Dean Novak. Or Dean from Novak Pack. Or just “Dean, my Omega”.  But he hadn’t. Castiel had picked the “Of Novak Pack” honorific and that meant a lot.
So they each could have the life they wanted, really. Dean could have his freedom. It was a bitter, cold freedom, but it was his. His life was his own and that was what mattered.
“And nearly forcing me into St. Misha’s when I have no wish to go is in my best interest?”
St. Jensen's Academy was a nice looking place. There were big green lawns dotted with iyy covered brick buildings, more like a college campus than the place of Dean's worst fears.
“He objected verbally to the coldness and size of the speculum she used, no more,” Castiel said. Dean had been far, far more docile at the treatment that he received than Castiel would have been at far less.
In return, Castiel smiled back, remembering that in most of the animal kingdom, but especially in the werewolves that were their distant ancestors, the smile was not to convey friendly expressions, but the baring of teeth. You did not threaten an Omega’s true mate without repercussions. Castiel did not open the folder to look inside but he pulled it towards him for later examination. He’d give it to his personal secretary Balthazar for safekeeping.
Sometimes, that wasn’t the exact wording, but it resulted in the same meaning. As time went on, the messages got longer, the hand writing better, as if the sender could barely write at first, but was making deliberate efforts to do better. He wondered about that. Cas had seemed like an educated man and supposedly he’d been meant to be a minister before taking to being a Marshal, but Dean had run across ministers that read no books besides their Bibles and their Shurley Gospels and even then, didn’t so much read them as have bits and pieces memorized. The point was, it seemed like Cas was trying.
That was it. They were mated. Dean could hardly breathe. It was too late to back out, even if that had ever been an option.
They were soon there and at the fence rail to a nice, well maintained paddock. Standing on the far side of the paddock, grazing quietly, a bit apart from the other horses, was a black mare and a brown and white pinto stallion. He remembered only then how Castiel said that Cabrón was not dead and that Impala had been brought home by Meg.
“He doesn’t even want me though,” Dean said, even knowing that was not the whole truth. “Things are fine when we’re here. When we’re alone, but he. Tonight.”
Eventually, though, everything was taken care of and they were on them road, the setting sun at their back. Both Sam and Dean slipping first into quiet, then into sleep. Understandable. Both of them had just had an exhausting confrontation with their Alpha father. Castiel still didn’t understand what exactly it was that Dean had done, what combination of scent, posturing and eye flare had weakened the older Alpha, but Dean had definitely done something to affect him. You should never underestimate an Omega when a pup’s safety was on the line, Castiel thought.
So, he drove Baby there to the gates of the country club and waited for Michael.
“Well, we can always hope that it sticks this time,” Meg said, uncocking her revolver and slipping it back to its holster on her hip. “Who’s the cupcake? I wouldn’t think you were the sort of Alpha who’s so whipped he drags his Omega everywhere.”
“Keep buying my panties,” Dean said. “I’m building up a stash so I can get away. He can’t make me kill my baby.”
“Oh. These. Jack gave them to me. They’re quite comfortable. They’re called Crocs.”
“I am fine,” he said.
“I don’t see what could be considered scandalous about myself embracing the man I’ve loved for many years just hours before we mated. Dean certainly didn’t mind it at the time. Or are you concerned about your own reputation? That it might affect your reputation as you are his family Alpha.”
Cas takes a closer look at Dean and realizes that the boy was far smaller than he thought, based on his impressions of the video chat. Also, the boy must have been sleeping rough. He was dirty, smudges on his face, his hands. Overlaid on that wonderful scent of him was a sourness and stink of grime, exhaustion and residual terror. Dean has had a rougher week than either himself or Sam. And hunger. The boy smelled of hunger. He knew that he’d given Dean quite a bit of money for his panties, but what if Dean’s father had thrown him out without allowing Dean access to that or anything else?
It wasn’t that Bobby didn’t like Sam, because he did, but he figured Sam was going to have life handed to him on a silver platter compared to Dean. All he had to do was grow up, get married or mated, and the biggest ranch in Yell County would be handed to him, free, clear and profitable. Improved, even, over the way John had left it on his departure from this world.
Castiel swallowed hard and surrendered his revolver, then let the man take the other one, then pat him down all over. The man found and seized a long, silvery knife, more of a dagger really, a derringer and a second, smaller knife. Other men, about five of them, shimmered into existence, coming out from behind buildings, piles of rubble and from the scrub ringing the compound. One of the men was Azazel, still wearing the same bloody shirt, hole in the sleeve clearly visible. Meg was nowhere to be seen, disappeared somewhere. Maybe she’d betrayed them. That was exactly what an evil bitch like her would do.
Then Dean saw it, smoke rising from a chimney. It was just barely visible in the pelting, freezing gale, but the scent of smoke was unmistakably the same resinous pine that they’d burned last night. They trotted a little closer and into hollow that blocked the worse of the snow and the wind. The cabin came into clearer view. It was a broke down little shack of a cabin, built right into the rock wall of the mountain hollow for shelter. Part of the roof had fallen in or off or something, but someone had dragged pine branches over it, a primitive kind of thatching, Dean supposed. There was a window that looked like it might have actual glass left in it. If they approached from the left, they might be able to see who was inside without alerting anyone to their presence.
Sam stared across the room, not sure why he felt such rage seething through him. He knew, intellectually, it wasn’t right to feel that. He loved his brother. It wasn’t that he wanted to be where that baby was at the moment, right on Dean’s lap. The baby was more of a toddler these days. If anything, Sam found Dean’s company to be smothering at times, like he was drowning in this vast ocean of Dean’s attention and affection. While he still wanted that attention, even craved it, it was like he had to run away from it too.
They rolled into the bunker at about three in the morning. It would have been a sensible afternoon return time if Dean hadn’t insisted on packing up the motel room right after they finished the case and driving straight through. It wasn’t that Castiel himself needed a night’s sleep, but he worried about Sam and Dean. Especially Dean because he refused to give up the wheel unless he was outright incapacitated or literally falling asleep at the wheel. Even though there were two other possible drivers in the car. Three if you counted Jack, who was being given driving lessons now. It didn’t matter, because no one but Dean drove the car, except, on rare occasions, Sam.
“It’s going to hurt. I know that. It’s okay. Just get it over with.”
“It’s not a true mating unless it is so for both,” Jimmy said, as if reading Castiel’s mind. “I know you’ve been hesitant to tell him how you feel. Maybe you need to tell him you wanted to court him last year but were refused.”
“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel said, offering a hand out to Dean. He looked like he’d not slept very much, but offered a brief smile to Dean. “Did you sleep well?”
“Thank you,” Dean said with a smile. He tucked the bill away with the rest in his shorts pocket and asked, “Any last thing I can get you?”
But their customs and laws forbade certain drinks. Olaf Lawbringer, centuries ago, had proclaimed that his people should not use intoxicating or stimulating drinks. So they hadn’t since then. No coffee, no black tea, no alcohol were allowed on pack lands. There were a few exceptions. Back in the day, water wasn’t reliably safe to drink, so everyone made and drank beer, so the low alcohol content beer they made themselves was allowed, so was cider, because you couldn’t store cider without it turning itself into hard cider, so that was considered to be the Goddess’s will and allowable. Generally, Folsom town pack lived pretty soberly as well, but Castiel was beyond grateful that Jimmy was a rebel. Just another little rebellion. It was understood that so long as you were quiet about it, if it wasn’t on the pack lands, no one would say anything about it. At least as far as coffee. Even Jimmy didn’t have so much as a single bottle of hard liquor in the house.
There was something stirred in Dean as he said this, like another one of those invisible strings inside his chest was woven in. Castiel had used the ritual words again to reassert the kinship of pack. They’d been spoken to him before on his first full moon out of the hospital, when he’d been written into the pack rolls, but hearing them again doubled the knot, tied it more secure.
Cas was already at the door of the compartment, but he did pause.
“He’s your brother?” Dean asked.
It kind of burned going in. Dean wasn’t entirely sure Michael had gotten the right hole. Everything was dry and tight and kind of painful.
Yell County had its share of Temperance Clubs and Leagues, usually one at each church. It wasn’t that Dean ever listened to their preaching and lecturing, but one thing he knew for certain was that with this woman sharing the shelter with them, he wanted to keep a clear head tonight. It wasn’t that he was opposed to liquor, though he’d seen the damage it could do. Perhaps Azazel might never have found the gumption to shoot John Winchester except with the poison of the bottle inside of him.
“I’ll think about it,” Dean said. He wasn’t sure though. Even assuming that Sammy could be taken care of in a good way, one that would set him up for life, Dean wasn’t sure he could give Cas everything he would want out of a mate. He could see, had always known really, just how much more Cas had than Dean ever would. Cas was on a different level altogether. He wouldn’t want shoddy, trashy Dean as a mate, even if he said he did. You could tell just by the way he acted to the snooty desk clerk, how he just entered this massive hotel suite as if it belonged to him, that he had real money. Probably way more than Dean ever dreamed of. The way he talked about sending Sammy off to an academic academy like it wasn’t any thing.
“Might be some lean years there. With ranching, some years, you lose money insteada’ making it. There’s drought years. Or you hear of some that lose the whole herd to Foot and Mouth Disease or God forbid, Anthrax. Or it’s such a good year that the price per head drops down low,” Bobby said. “Ain’t easy work or ever a sure thing.”
“They’re fine for slippers,” Dean said. “But what if you need to run or something. They’d fly right off your feet.”
“Uh, you know that’s not what that means,” Sam said. “Never mind. I thought we were going to the farmer’s market.”
Honestly, this whole get up made him dryer than the Sahara down there, but he put it on anyway. It was all for show. No one was supposed to touch him. He knew he had a body that the Alphas just about wanted to eat up and it was about the only thing he had going for him at the moment. Otherwise, he was a high school drop out with a drunk weighing him down and a kid brother completely dependent on him. He figured, he had about ten good years to take advantage of his sole asset before it started depreciating and maybe try and leverage himself out of the jam he was in. He always told himself it wasn’t so bad. At least he wasn’t stripping.
“Oh, it’s big.”
About nine months after he left it the first time, Castiel brought a small cardboard box of personal items into his office at the Lawrence, Kansas branch of Milton, Milligan and Morgan, LLP, the biggest company of tax advisors and consultants in the country. Little, if anything, seemed to have changed. It was nearly Christmas time again. He had met Dean at a Christmas party given by his older brother Sam. Maybe he would be invited to this year’s party and could reconnect with Dean then. In any case, the office had been decorated with such festivity as suited it- a tree in the lobby with white lights, gold ornaments and somber burgundy ribbons, a few tasteful wreathes and garlands here and there. Just like last year.
But Thursday nights were pretty quiet. Dean liked to catch a little down time after his shift at the garage before he had to go back home to Sammy and the kids. They weren’t his kids, no sir. Dean wasn’t that kind of Alpha, even though it could be kind of tough, sharing a house with a fertile, wonderful smelling Omega that was strictly off limits. Sammy had run into a little trouble when he went away to college and had come home a year short of graduation with twins in his belly and an absolute refusal to say who the father was. So, Dean stepped up and supported his brother and the twins. The kids were five now, getting into everything and being a total pain in the ass. Well loved pains in the ass, but even so.  Dean’s need to blow off a little steam was getting stronger and stronger all the time. He drank his beer and wondered if anything might come along that would allow him to let a little loose.
“You know that Gadreel came to me this morning, told me there’s a faction that does not support me mating Dean. They believe he’s too weak. He wouldn’t betray the Pack though. I know him. It would be anathema to him.”
He was there, waiting close by but not crowding Dean. He was waiting for a signal, Dean realized. An invitation. While the confrontation had been happening, Dean had been wildly aware of Cas, who had remained almost preternaturally calm and not wolfed out in the slightest. That was crazy. When you had a couple of Alphas wolfing out at each other like Sam and Dad had been, any other Alphas in the area kind of picked it up, just as a defense mechanism. Two Alphas about to struggle for dominance with each turned in Alpha melee pretty easily if there were any others in the vicinity. For Cas to stay removed from that wasn’t a weakness. It spoke to an Alpha strength that Dean could hardly imagine. More than the calm, it seemed that Cas had been exquisitely aware of all the currents of what was happening and poised on intervention, but reading his every cue from Dean. He would have followed Dean’s lead. Dean wasn’t sure how he was sure of this, but he knew it in his bones.
Still, he could see that he would have to walk more carefully with Hannah now and ask her to take the stool or the seat to his left, like any other Council member would. Hannah could teach some of her tasks to Dean, like an apprenticeship. They could teach Dean what he needed to know gradually.
“You weren’t there then, Cassie. It was a long time before you rolled off that assembly line with the crack in your chassis,” Gabriel said. “First age of man. Real prequel to the Old Testament stuff. So, like I said, it was always getting in the way. Not practical at all. Especially as women were reproducing by parthenogenesis. It was always one baby at a time or maybe two. No need for a third breast.”
“Yes,” Dean said. “For God’s sake, yes already. Get inside me.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I’ve got it covered. Assuming Walt and Roy don’t decide to act up again and decide they’re in charge since they’re Alpha and I’m not. Going to fire their asses if they pull that again.”
“Yes! Dean, your Cas from way back is Castiel Novak, the Marshal. He’s the biggest name in Westerns.”
“Yeah, just let me get my stuff,” Dean said. He was the one that had opened that particular can of worms, but he was looking forward to cramming the lid back on again and ignoring it all for a while.
And yes, there was the kissing scene that little Dean had complained about. There was no close up, and what must have been fancy work from the camera angles, because you could hardly tell the moment when the dark haired Marshall was no longer Cas but the other man. Dean could tell. It was the way the man held his shoulders, a shape to the hands. He could tell his Alpha from any distance. The movie ended after that, fading to dark, suggesting that mating was in the offing rather than showing it. Then a list of the actors and the parts they played started to scroll down the screen.
“I understand from Ellen that she gave you Dean’s things to get to Dean, but they never reached him.”
“Isn’t that one state park on the way back home? The one we went to that first time you drank my milk. Maybe we could park and spend the night in the van and see the sunrise.”
He couldn’t help but remember the full moon nights before coming to the pack. Sometimes, there were the crowded, awful public shelters. Yeah, they were safe, but full of people. They smelled of armpits and farts and people who didn’t wash enough. He knew now that a lot of those unwashed people had been homeless but then he had just thought it was rude and awful of them not to wash. Worse than the shelter full moon nights were the full moon nights spent alone with only salt and silver and Dean to protect him, spending the night in the middle of a big circle of rock salt, Dean armed with a silver knife, hoping like hell that nothing could break through. That had happened only a few times, but it was a sleepless night every time.
When he got Ma settled at Sam and Eileen’s, he wasn’t sure what to do with himself. He could go do the usual, but honestly, he’d found it a lot harder to drive himself and work himself to the bone now. It just seemed like there was so many better things to do. There wasn’t his sorrow and loneliness to bury in work. He found himself wanting to pass more and more of it off to others. He’d always prided himself on not asking his hands to do work he wasn’t willing to take on himself, but now? He’d be glad to be shut of the work. He thought about heading out to the barn, maybe hassling Charlie about something.
Castiel looked upset about something. He frowned and said, “It’s been nearly ten days since the birth. You were in a medically induced coma for several days and very slow to come out of it.”
He, Castiel and Bobby sat up for a while, keeping their own kind of watch with Garth and Jody. Castiel talked about the traditional buildings he’d had seen, on the islands and in parts of Europe at the various places he’d been during the war. Bobby had visited too, years ago, before his accident. Bobby talked about the translation he was working on, one of their oldest journals left by a Pack Alpha. Dean mostly kept quiet and listened, just happy to be around Bobby again, somehow feeling, not entirely happy, but happy about the fact that he got to enjoy this at least. It was quiet and Dean might have dozed off a little right at the table for a while.
“Good plan,” Cas said. “I’ll stay.”
“We’ll have to change that.”
He came downstairs to a completely empty house. Castiel had left him alone, gone away, no hint where he was going.
“And you don’t have Alpha brothers? I never knew an Omega without them.”
Dean mostly didn’t pay attention to their talk. They seemed to have a history and spoke in spare, minimal anecdotes and kept the details to themselves. Meg had produced a tattered deck of cards from her pack and the two Alphas played at cards, trading little slips of paper for their betting. They mostly ignored Dean, but that wasn’t any kind of surprise when Alphas talked among themselves. A wise Omega shut his mouth and listened when Alphas talked. Not because that Omega did what he was told, but because if you let yourself fade into the background, people said things they wouldn’t say around a mouthy, gossiping Omega.
This Bobby, cranky as he was, cracked a grin and said, “You can’t tell Dean no. Well, you could, but it’s no damn use. The boy just plain won’t listen to no. He’s a firecracker for sure. He could start a fight in an empty house.”
It occurred to him later that he never had been given any advice on what would happen during the mating. Dean had the basic ideas down. He knew what a knot was. He knew how babies were made. He knew that Castiel would have to put his cock inside Dean and he would have to come inside Dean. Otherwise, it wasn’t a valid mating. His scent wouldn’t change without Castiel coming inside Dean. The scent bond wouldn’t happen.
“I should go. I’ll try and catch an even earlier shuttle home than the five o’clock. I know I haven’t been as timely as I said I would be.”
“You’re Dean Novak, formerly Dean Winchester?” She asked. Dean nodded.
She had no more been a loving, warm mother to him than this lonely, echoing palace had been a home. She had always been abstentious of her affections, even frugal with kind words and praise. She had, however, always done her best for Eden, Castiel recognized. She did not unjustly enrich herself by it as she could have, she was not a power monger. She valued tradition and propriety over kindness and love. Even now, she gave little outward signs of anger, but sat up ramrod straight at her desk, dressed in a tailored black pantsuit even early in the morning as it was. He thought that he had not seen her in anything but a black pantsuit that he could remember, even at her elevation to the regency and his own coronation, those many years ago.
“Then you had best go study with Charlie. But perhaps tomorrow night, you could come dine in the Hall with me? I don’t have anywhere suitable where you could spend the night, but if I request it, they will run a late shuttle for us back to Folsom.”
He walked over to the cluster of young Alphas nearest to Dean and said, “Pups, have you forgotten your duties? This is your home and yet an honored guest is laboring in your place.”
“You don’t need to call me by my title,” Castiel said. “We’re mates. You might call me Cassie, if you like.”
Their pack custom was to not give mating gifts as a matter of course, but if a young couple needed help it getting started in their life together, they would find themselves being offered things- a set of dishes someone ‘wasn’t using anyway’ or ‘my GrandOm’s second best Dutch oven, he’d want to know it was being used’ or ‘we really do have too many blankets, you’d be doing me a favor to take a couple.’
Cas? Then Dean remembered his introduction to the man yesterday. His first name was the somewhat unlikely moniker of Castiel. Folks around Fort Smith went in not just for Biblical names, but for the names of Angels and demons as well, as revealed in the Shurley Gospels, which were said to be the genuine word of God. Dean didn’t buy that, not for a minute, but having them as part of Scripture sure spiced up the pick of names used. He was glad his mother and father had gone in for simple, family names like Sam and Dean.
Luckily, Castiel did not have to stand long on the front porch debating about the etiquette of letting himself into a house that he technically owned. A drift of scent- food being cooked, delicious grilled meat, came from the back yard, and if he listened, he could hear sounds from the backyard, Claire mostly, her high pitched voice screaming in delight the way children did when playing. So Castiel called over the fence and got an invitation from his brother to come around back.
“You’d better not break his heart again,” Sam said after several minutes of wrenching, hardly bearable silence.
“Dean, I’m not angry.”
Dean looked down at his feet. It was sort of a funny thing at all, him owning slippers. Like a robe, they were the sort of thing that didn’t make the cut when you were traveling light, out on the road. His first pair had been dead guy slippers, found with the robe, but he’d bought his own pair a lot like them. This pair was his third pair.
Jimmy would be Dean’s first choice as a mate, Dean thought, but that was impossible. He was already taken. Gadreel had started stepping out with Hester. That really only left Meg. Dean wasn’t sure it wouldn’t be worse mated to Meg than to just take pot luck with the Men of Letters pack, no matter how bad it would be. Anyway, from what he’d seen, Meg only made time with Betas, never Omegas. There were a few older widowers, like Cain, though Cain seemed disinclined to mate again, given he’d had many  opportunities. Dean would prefer not to be some widower’s second mate. Dean couldn’t think of any other likely bachelor Alphas in the pack.
“Don’t worry, Mother,” he said. “The family coffers will continue to fill at much the same rate. Yes, I thought the Christmas address to the nation would be a good time. There is one more thing. The main business offices of Grace Industries will be relocating, as will I.”
At this moment, he didn’t care that he was Omega and Dean was Omega and that their parts didn’t match up and that society and the Church forbid it.
One of their lawyers spoke up, “Until the matter of the superseding Pack is settled by the courts, Dean is on Novak Pack rolls and Novak Law, Tradition and Custom applies.”
If only Dean could be convinced to become that mate.
“We do well enough,” Dean admitted. He hated to ever say more than that out of a fear he’d jinx things somehow. Besides, a man never bragged about things like that.
“You’re not making it any better,” Sam snapped as they finally wedged the shutter into its place over the hole, lining up the latches. He whacked the one closest to him into place in lieu of his fist on Cole’s face.
The Marshal’s eyes widened a little and then he swallowed hard. Before Dean could get another word out, the man turned his Pinto around and set out on the last stretch to the trading post.
Castiel- he was exciting. But not just that. It was also harder to see, but he could be kind, like Jimmy was. Maybe not quite the same way, but still kind. Maybe not gentle but Dean knew from Bobby that genuine kindness sometimes wasn’t. Sometimes kindness came wrapped in a gruff package.
Obviously, Cas had not heard all of the conditions. Dean had always assumed Bobby had given him the full scoop. Apparently he hadn’t.
“They’re practical. And a gift from Jack,” Dean said, defensively. “They’re great for wet work.”
“I highly doubt that,” Castiel said. “You are the most caring, loving person I have ever known and that has brought me to life. You bring me joy. You just need to give yourself the time to find it for yourself. Now, for our honeymoon, is there any place else you want to see besides the Grand Canyon? I understand Las Vegas is not far from there.”
“It wasn’t a fight, but yes, we won,” Castiel affirmed. Somehow, with these words, it was easier for Dean to stand tall again, to feel the weakness leave his knees. The submission reflex which had been threatening again slowly seeped away, leaving him feeling okay. Maybe better than okay.
“True enough,” Gadreel said. “There’s other skills than carving he could practice. Though you’re also better than him at embroidery too.”
Dean tucked the condom back into his jacket pocket. He was, after all, known to do a lot of stupid things and it was too late now. He folded up the rest of his clothes, and Angel’s and brought them inside the cabin. He grabbed the blankets, turned off the fireplace, turned on the one indoors. He turned on some of the lamps, set the piles of clothes on the table. Then the shower in the bathroom turned on and Angel poked his head out of the bathroom.
“We are, but Cas was still asleep,” Dean said, swiping the soapy sponge all over Baby’s windshield, scrubbing a bit to get off the splattered bugs, because driving through the country was great, but the country was full of bugs. Especially around the corn fields. Sometimes you’re the windshield, sometimes you’re the bug, Dean thought.
“Let me,” Castiel said and though it felt almost a physical pain to lose body contact with Dean again, he got out of bed and tugged each of Dean’s boots off his feet, pulled his own boots off and divested himself of his suit jacket before he returned to bed. Freed of his boots, Dean hurried to get out of his own suit. He’d already thrown off his jacket and was stripped down to his red brocade waistcoat and was yanking off his cravat with little care.
“The speculum. It shouldn’t be that uncomfortable. You’re quite obviously not a virgin,” she said, holding up a funny metal object that looked way too big to be going inside Dean’s junk.
“Yes, that one.”
Castiel chuckled a little, eyes crinkled up. He pushed the Angel Blade back into full hiding under Dean’s pillow. “You don’t need to explain, Dean. I feel better knowing you have it close to hand. Honestly, I wish you could carry it everywhere, but society seems to frown on open blade carry these days. I always slept with it under my pillow before I gave it to you.”
Castiel looked doubtful for a moment, as if wavering, but then his jaw set hard and he got an angry look, eyes just about flashing. “If he wasn’t before, he certainly will be by now. I made sure to tape him up good and tight. I thought we agreed that Michael had to die.”
It was something he would have to work on, keeping a hold of his moods and his scents like that. It wasn’t like he couldn’t. He’d done it for many years, an essential skill for a military career in so many ways. He’d come home though, and been able to let it go. On the pack lands, if his scents bothered someone, he could just go off for a run in the woods. In some ways, it was expected that his scenting would be more dominant, more in people’s faces. But in the town, in the modern world in general, an Alpha was expected to have control over himself.
At Dean’s silence, Cas added, “With a knife. Her name was April and she stabbed me when I found out she was a murderer with a writ out on her. I was lucky not to die. You have your own scars with their own stories.”
“Hello, I’ve heard you’re certified to work on Grace Engines at this shop,” he said, as if he were some kind of stranger, as if he hadn’t been in the most intimate of positions with Dean already.
It was elusive under the hospital odors- bleach and other cleaners were pungent, purposefully meant to cut human odors, then the odors of sick people and just many people in general, but he thought he caught a delicate whiff of Dean’s scent, just a hint of it, so he followed it. He strode out of the clinic, starting to run as he caught a better trace of Dean in the parking lot, once he was away from the cleaning products. Dean was in distress, he could tell. And running. Dean moved fast, a lot faster than Castiel thought was possible. They were nearly a mile down the road from the clinic by the time Castiel had caught up with him. Dean was heading for the highway, as if he was planning to walk back to his own house. Maybe he was planning to hitchhike which was an even more terrifying prospect to Castiel.
On a whim, Cas scooped Dean up into his arms, one under Dean’s knees, the other around his shoulders. Dean’s eyes opened a little in surprise, but he grinned, as if he hadn’t realized that Cas would be able to lift him so easily. He carried Dean across the threshold. Dean seemed to think that Cas would set him down in the living room, but Cas continued onward to his bedroom, a room Dean hadn’t been in yet.
“Yeah,” Dean said, about ready to rest his head on his arms and sleep right there at the kitchen table. “Oh, hey, you still got your usual overnight volunteer gig tomorrow night? Need me to be here for the kids.”
When Sam got back to the Hall after three hours of toting firewood, wanting nothing more than to escape to the bathhouse, he groaned, remembering it was full moon and that meant cleaning the Hall, making it ready for the pack to assemble tonight. When he got to his work assignment, the bucket he was expecting wasn’t pushed into his hands, but Cole was there, with a ladder.
“No, you’ve helped me way too much already. I don’t know how to thank you enough,” Dean said.
The first spurt of come had caught him by surprise, but he was able to get it together enough to grab the collection jar and position it correctly, gathering all the rest, hand wrapped tightly around his knot to simulate an Omega’s internal grip. He filled the jar to the minimum required level and a good bit more before he softened and the come no longer pulsed out.
“It is though. Who you mate affects us all. And you can’t make a decision that important just to save one Omega who probably shouldn’t have been brought into the pack in the first place. His brother’s a good kid, a good fit for our pack, but you should just let Dean go back to his father’s people if they’re willing to take him on.”
Then Sam held out his phone to Castiel, who stared at it, not quite comprehending what he was supposed to do, feeling strangely numb and stupid.
“Nah, I’ll be on my way. Let you folks get on with your morning,” Bobby said. “Dean, maybe you should take a few days. A week. To rest up. Marshal, about time you finally came around.”
He put the Impala in park and looked around at what seemed like acres and acres of old cars of every kind of make and model you could think of, all in various states of disassembly and decrepitude. There were racks of tires and a couple of sheds just as decrepit as the rest. An old guy walked out of one of the sheds and walked over to Dean. He wore a trucker cap on his head and a couple of layers flannel shirts.
Michael groaned.
“It’s a surprise,” Dean said, tugging the bag away, but then offering Castiel his money clip back. it looked visibly depleted and of that, Castiel was glad.
“I have a reward of a thousand dollars to the man that sees him hanged,” Dean said fiercely.
“You don’t want me as a mate,” Dean said. “I’m a good lay. No more than that. I’m not mate worthy. I can barely cook. I don’t want kids. I can’t keep a house. I’m no one’s best option for a mate.”
Castiel had finally, for the first time that evening, looked at Dean approvingly when he was talking about the damn traditional clothes, the finery he’d borrowed from Amelia for this evening. His own Smokkr and tunic hadn’t shown up yet. When the Pack Alpha asked you specially to dine with him in the Hall, you were supposed to dress up. That was pretty much understood.
Castiel rode out of town to the North alone, not even stopping to find Meg, nor wish Dean goodbye. There was a circuit court up in Omaha where a Marshal could find writs to serve on criminals. He didn’t think he’d be likely to run into Dean again there. He wouldn’t know the routes through the Territories up there, nor have connections, but routes could be learned and connections could be made. There was little to keep Castiel here, now that the last string of his criminal brother Lucifer had been cut. He should go. It would be better for Dean if he just disappeared. Meg would catch up with him when she decided to.
Dean moaned at the thought of slender, tiny Castiel impaled on the impossibly huge knot of the burly sex ed teacher he'd only met once so far. He wondered if he'd ever get to see that. Then he realized that something was stretching him, filling him. Cas had used the moment of distraction to slide the knot into Dean's pussy. Then he started moving it, pumping it in and out, brushing that spot inside of Dean harder and harder each time.
“To who?”
“Oh, Dean, Amelia and I are so proud of you. I know Cassie will be too,” he said, smiling. “School hasn’t been easy for you, but you’ve done so well. Let’s go home.”
“Look, you didn’t embarrass anyone, especially not me,” Jimmy said. “You did nothing wrong. Everyone was on the edge and emotional last night. With the situation and with the storm going on. This morning is hard on everyone. It’s like a bomb went off. I think seeing our father’s cabin destroyed like that was harder on Cassie than he’ll ever admit. Everyone got damaged somehow but we will pull through like we always do.”
Castiel shows up for dinner after all. Dean and Charlie order pizza and risk getting smited.  Betas love to nest too, so nesting and movies it is.
Of course they would be looking for him. Dean couldn’t remember ever sleeping this late, he thought, looking at the alarm clock. Seven. He’d slept until seven. He tried to pull himself out of bed, but Castiel had woken or was at least not as asleep as he was pretending, because Dean found himself clasped tight in the man’s arms, embraced as if he was never going to be let go of again. He thought it might be like being in an octopuses tentacles, Cas was so clingy. Not that Dean had ever even seen such a creature, but Sammy’s pups had one of those encyclopedias of animals for the young. Dean had seen a picture of the eight armed being when one of the pups pushed the open book under his nose.
“No!”
Dean was watching television late Christmas afternoon up in his bedroom. Dean was flipping channels as he’d gotten bored with football, having watched his fill of it in the afternoon. The downstairs was still a wreck, filled up with torn apart wrapping paper and toy packaging. Sam and the boys were watching cheesy Christmas movies downstairs in the family room among all the post unwrapping wreckage. His belly was full of Christmas dinner and he had a comfortable finger or two of whisky in his belly but he hadn’t been drinking, not really.
“Promise me something, Dean,” Castiel said. “Promise me that you’ll do your best not to use those kind of words again, because you’re saying them about someone I care for a great deal.”
Castiel thought. “The redhead? She’s packless. Was it wise for you to allow Dean to spend time with a packless Beta?”
“A long time,” Cas agreed. “The years have agreed with you far better than they have with me.”
“I am aware,” Cas said. “But only if we get caught. You should sleep.”
“You make these things?” Dean asked, whispering. Behind them, some person shushed him, so he kept his peace and his trap shut. Castiel just squeezed his hand silently and smiled. Soon, the short film was over and there was another up on the screen.
He’d gotten the coffee maker going by the time he heard feet on steps and most of the ingredients he’d need for a simple omelet out on the counter by the time Castiel entered the kitchen. What would Castiel like on his eggs? Was Castiel a bacon kind of guy? Should he see if Castiel had time for that? Cheese? Everyone liked cheese on their eggs, right?
“One, I’m serious. Any dishonor to you is a dishonor to my Alpha, so yeah, Imma bust his chops. Two, you let them talk to you like you’re a bitch and they start treating you like one. Three, it’s literally my job to bust his chops. If it wasn’t that, I’d find something,” she said, before stomping off, probably to find another person to make their life hell too.
“The milkshake was definitely worth it,” Dean protested. “It brought all the Alphas to the yard.”
Dean had a bucket and rag, scrubbing the shelves clean. Cas was in the other aisle, stocking some already cleaned shelves with jars of jellies and pickles, that kind of thing. “I don’t see why we have to sell strawberry jam. I find jam unsettling,” Cas said.
He didn’t go though. He stood there as if waiting for Dean to tell him something. Dean was about to open up his mouth and say something about how Bobby needn’t tarry, but then behind him, the bedroom door opened. Behind Dean, there was the sound of boots on the hallway floor, then the stairs. In a few short minutes, Cas had pulled himself out of bed and fully dressed in his dark suit minus his bolo tie. He stood behind Dean, put his hands on Dean’s waist, a subtle claim, but not one Dean’s Omega minded at all. He could feel himself all but purr at the feeling of the Alpha pressed to his back.
“I’ve never met a horse I couldn’t charm,” Dean said, stepping a little closer, thinking to move the tie up away from the middle of the lean to, so as to make room for all three of the beasts. The gray horse didn’t give a warning sound, but there was that flash in her eye and suddenly her ears were pinned back. Dean stepped away quick. A second later, her hoof occupied the spot he’d been standing, striking against the wall of the lean to with a hard thud.
“So why is it any different for some Alpha or his kid to demand to use your uterus for nine months?”
“Can I see your tattoos again?” Dean asked, a question that Castiel did not expect. “Light’s better in here than in the box bed back in the Hall or in the shower.”
“Dean, you can’t go away with Dad. I still need you,” Sam whispered. He thought maybe he felt something. He wasn’t sure. He’d been told this was how Dean would get better though, being around those he loved. Scenting them. Being with them. He wanted to crawl into bed with Dean, like they used to when they were little kids still, left alone in some room somewhere, just them. He didn’t dare though. There were tubes and hoses to dislodge. He could just hold Dean’s hand and that’s what he did for the longest time.
“Fair enough, Alpha,” she said. “Let’s get your Omega examined. Do I have your permission to speak to him?”
“Are you well? Do you need to see a doctor?” Castiel asked, not sure why it didn’t seem like a good idea to straight out ask Dean if he were pregnant. It seemed an oddly intrusive question, especially considering that he could be the only possible candidate for the father. Considering how intimate he had been with Dean. Castiel decided he would let the question rest for a while. If Dean were pregnant, he’d start to scent of it in a month or so and there would be no questions about that.
Dean looked worried for a moment but then came the easy smile that Bobby knew hid a lot. “I’ll saddle up,” he said. “You want Brazos?”
Dean couldn’t believe what he had done. He had sassed an Alpha. Not just any Alpha. The Pack Alpha. The Pack Alpha and his mate, his brain supplied, not so helpfully. He was lucky that the man hadn’t swatted him down. He deserved it. He had not been a well behaved Omega. There had been no sitting down, no shutting up, no doing what he’d been told. Just demanding something that he would have been given before if it was something that truly was rightfully his and not just a some kind of legal tactic they were using to keep the Grigori sword.
“Yeah, but I’ve never had metal in there,” Dean said. “And fuck, do you keep that thing in the freezer? It’s like ice.”
“Yeah, I’d do anything for Jimmy too,” Dean said when Castiel’s voice had trailed off, unable to say anything further. “There. That place?”
“I told John he never should have sold her. Near broke Dean’s heart to lose her, but John up and decided Dean’s place was in the kitchen with his Ma after letting him have the run of the ranch his whole life. He forbade Dean any horse, any job outside.”
Dean was dressed up, for once, in traditional clothes, though they looked like they didn’t quite fit, like they’d been borrowed. The Smokkr was too long for an Omega, properly. Something about the particular cut of them seemed familiar and he realized they’d been borrowed from Amelia. That was right. Dean had complained about how his personal items from Bobby’s house had gone missing. He had asked Hannah about it yet nothing had happened, which was unlike her. A full set of traditional clothes was not easy to replace. They were hand sewn with needle and thread and depending on how much embroidery and trim, could take weeks or even months to make. Dean wasn’t sitting or eating. He was gathering up used, dirty crockery into a basket to be hauled back to the kitchens. Making himself useful.
He wondered what it would feel like if he let himself relax into it. It would probably help a lot if they alone, just the two of them. The thought that there were so many people awake just on the other side of the thin wood walls of the box bed had been nerve wracking in itself. But if they were alone in their bed together. Maybe with Jimmy and Amelia out of the house. That would be easier. If Castiel would just give him another chance to learn to like it.
“You’re little Cassie’s pretty friend, aren’t you?” Michael asked. “The one who gave me a bloody nose when we were all just little pups.”
“May I get you something?” Cas asked.
“You are, as any adult pack member is, welcome to split from the pack, bringing along any followers you might convince to join you. You could challenge me for Pack Alpha, if you think you could. But until you do either of those things, you will be reminded that you live in my house and eat at my table.”
Dean sealed up the last of the padded envelopes after his last check the the right items were in each one. He liked to get all of the work for Castiel’s Etsy store done and out the door each day before his Dad woke up. That way, John Winchester would have no idea actually just how much business it was. That way, he wouldn’t look into it. Dean sort of let him believe that it was just a small thing, something he was helping Cas out with for a little bit of pocket money. John had no reason to think it was something that grossed four, five thousands worth of sales in a month. Of course, that was just the gross. There were expenses. No way did Castiel’s hives produce enough honey and beeswax to make all of those lotion bars, so Dean had to buy that along with all of the almond oil and scents and such. Castiel insisted on top quality ingredients, so they were expensive.
“It’s perfect!” They all agreed, so Dean paid Garth off and they bundled up the tree and somehow, he managed to drag it home.
“Are you really my Grandmother?” He asked.
Before Dean could finish wrestling with the uncomfortable feelings, the shower stopped and a few moments later, Angel reappeared in the main room of the cabin, wearing only a towel around his waist. His lovely little breasts were very much on display, nipples perked up and hard. Dean found himself wondering if they would grow when the Omega got pregnant. They often did and stayed that way.
“And Pup?” She said, raising an eyebrow. “Even if he weren’t mated to the Alpha to us all, you should be ashamed of yourself, speaking to an Omega that way. You’re intolerably rude and a little asshole with no respect for those who deserve it the most. You’re on dish duty, all meals, for a week and extra patrols too. And I’ll think something else that fits the offense later. Get back to work.”
“Okay, we’ll go,” Dean said, wishing he had a silver blade on him. Then he realized he had better than that if he needed. He’d taken to carrying the angel blade around with him, in a makeshift sheathe in his back pack. He wasn’t about to admit to Castiel that he carried such a precious, valuable piece of property around with him where anyone could take it. Just as Castiel had a need to patrol their borders, so Dean had a need to carry the blade around with him. He just hoped Castiel wouldn’t mind it wasn’t in the display case at Jimmy’s house. It wasn’t that Dean was much good. He wasn’t a hunter like his Dad had been, but Dean could probably hold his own, mostly, with a blade as powerful as the Angel blade.
“Perhaps you’d like to come inside and clean up?” Crowley asked when the police were gone and the small crowd had dispersed. Castiel looked at himself and his bloodied hands. There were some stains on his shirt as well. He could not go home to Dean looking like this, so he followed Crowley inside.
They didn’t have a lot of stuff left from their Dad. Obviously, Baby couldn’t be kept on the pack lands, but Dean had been assured that she was stored safely. Same with all of the weapons that lived in her trunk. As for Dad’s clothes, Dean would never grow tall enough to wear them. He’d tucked away an olive green flannel and Dad’s leather jacket into his closet. They still smelled like Dad for now. There was one other thing he’d been given for safe keeping and he went an got it now. It wasn’t really something the Omega son should have gotten anyway. It rightfully should go to Sammy.
"No, I don't want her," Dean said. She was nice, kind, but Dean just liked Cas better than anyone else he'd met at St. Jensen's. "Can you. Maybe with a toy knot?"
Cas says many things to Dean, most not particularly helpful.
“I’ve seen her here and there,” Castiel said. “But we do not, as you say, knock boots anymore and haven’t since that night in the cabin. I have been alone and I will stay alone. There is one Omega who was meant for me but I know I could never have him. It would be in his own worst interest to be with me. I am happy to just know that I love him.”
Castiel’s heart soared as they kissed again, tugging each other closer, Castiel gripping the waist of Dean’s jeans, Dean’s hands buried in the collar of Castiel’s borrowed flannel.
Surprisingly, Cas didn’t tell him he shouldn’t say things like that or that they would figure out a non-violent way to get Dean free. Instead, he reached out, took Dean’s hand. Dean had woken from his drugged sleep to find Castiel had his hand gripped tight while sleeping slumped over in the bedside chair. It had kept Dean calm somehow. Cas was here. Cas had come back from California and it wasn’t for some planned family holiday either. He had obviously heard and he had just come.
Revulsion roiled through Castiel, nausea at the thought of it. Oh, incest was a grand old tradition among the Princes and Princesses of Eden, as it was in most royal families, usually not so close as half siblings. Conserve the bloodlines and such and of course, the only suitable mate for a royal Omega was an Alpha from a royal bloodline. Castiel could think of about seven or eight first cousin pairings down his family tree. There were a couple of sibling pairs in there, and once, two hundred-ish years ago, the second Princess Consort Evander mated to his father Prince Oswald.
Honestly, Castiel was confused but both weary and wary. Michael was in jail and Naomi was upset about that. Well, her upset was understood. Michael was the son she had always wanted, not Castiel. Michael was her favorite son, for all that he wasn’t her son at all. Castiel hated to be reminded that yet again, he was not as loved or cherished as Michael. It was just tiring to have it happen again. But the ‘no good friend’ could only have been Dean. How could Dean possibly have put Michael into prison? Castiel had dragged a confession of abuse from Dean, who would never, not in a million years, admit it to anyone else.
Sorry. I’m not feeling up for comments right now. I get weird about them sometimes. Kudos appreciated, of course. Thank you for reading.
“A few small ones, like the Roadhouse, are tolerated, so long as they’re useful and respectful. Much like the presence of the Marshals is tolerated, so long as we are only here to retrieve our own fugitives,” Novak said, eye straight ahead to the rapidly approaching buildings. “We walk lightly here and with respect.”
Dean had known just how fine a marksman Castiel was. He’d seen the trick with the cards back on the trail and proved to himself just how near impossible it was to do, but trick after trick shot, Castiel made them all. Some tricks, he used the rifle, some his revolvers. Gabriel threw six dimes into the air one after another and when Castiel had shot off six times, Gabriel invited a handful of audience members into the ring. At his direction, six dimes were searched for and found. All six had bullet sized holes blasted through them. Castiel blew out a series of candles using only bullets. Castiel used a mirror and held his one of his revolvers in each hand over his shoulder. He buried bullets in the dead center of the target bullseye. Then shot again and again, in a pattern, forming a Valentine’s heart.
He also had three sections of honey still in the comb. His honey glowed amber of varying shades, the clover light and pure, the buckwheat deep and rich, in the overhead light. His heart lifted to see the fancy purple and gold rosette of the grand champion ribbon stuck to his exhibit. He went further down the aisle where he’d also done his honey business plan display. He’d created sample products and packaging, proposed marketing plans. He’d even, secretly, started the steps he’d need to make it into an actual business as soon as he was eighteen and could do it legally on his own.
He didn’t linger long in the shower, just long enough so that he didn’t feel gross down there any more. Then he put on some of his normal clothes, just a fresh pair of jeans and a plaid flannel over a t-shirt, the kind of thing he wore to classes in Folsom. He had traditional clothes for the days when he was here at the village, the wide legged draped pants and blouse with a short apron over it like Omegas wore, but nothing in this world could get him to wear those things when was heading out into the normal world. Some of the pack just wore traditional clothes all the time and you would see them around Folsom, conducting their business while looking like they’d stepped away from a living history museum or from another time. That was fine, but it wasn’t Dean.
They picked their way slowly on the trail that wove down the bluff to the river trail. It was a little like the river trail they’d taken in the Territories, but more lush, the trees were cottonwoods, willows, that kind of thing, not the scrubby pines. It truly was another country though it wasn’t so far away from here.
It wasn’t long before Dean, feeling a little better or at least clean, was heading downstairs where his brother had cooked dinner and their kids were waiting. He grabbed one nibling in each arm and twirled them around, giving them a hair tousle as he sat them down, his heart warmed up a little by their happy cries of “Uncle Dean! Uncle Dean!”
Castiel ached to hear that. He wanted Dean to know that someone found him beautiful, just as he was.
They stopped in front of a group of people. Castiel vaguely recognized a tall man as that gangly pup of a brother who had thought he was defending Dean from an offending Alpha once. There was a delicate looking blond woman in a bobbed hair-do that had the same eyes as Dean did and a short, dark woman who seemed attached to the tall brother, as well as several small children.
“As amusing as this flirtation is, perhaps we could go inside out of the storm to continue it,” Castiel said, dryly.
“It says in,” Ishim started, no doubt planning to quote from his holy books.
They pulled in about fifteen minutes later, not even having seen another car on the road. Bobby had the gate open for them and pulled it shut after them.
“You ain’t half bad yourself,” Dean said. “Charlie tells me you’ve got half the Omegas in the country swooning for you and most of the beta women to boot.”
That was one thing Castiel knew Jimmy and Amelia had been very clear on when Dean had moved in. Dean was not there to become their maid or house Omega. He did chores, but only because he was a member of the household. Everyone did their part. Castiel wondered if he should become a more formal part of their chore roster, because apparently he would be here at least the honeymoon month, possibly a lot longer. Now was not the time to talk about that though.
“You know, we have never forgotten that you did not let his betrothed Anna take even a token.”
They’d bought the old U-Pick Orchard on the highway that ran out of town and towards the interstate. Everyone going to or from the interstate had to pass their roadside stand. Cas was setting up some more hives in the furthest corner of the orchard. They’d move them closer to the trees in a few weeks when they were due to blossom. They probably wouldn’t get a good crop this year. The U-Pick place had been closed for a couple years and the trees hadn’t been pruned properly in a while. They’d do what they could though.
“I know you must not trust me, Dean,” Angel said. “But if you follow my lead, I know the dance.”
That didn’t seem right, but he could scent it on the Omega and felt Dean’s small, hard cock against his body. Could he hope that it was actually him that Dean wanted? And not himself as a proxy for his twin? He should have carried Dean over to the family room sofa. They could scent together there, innocently. He was selfish though. He wanted. They were mates, after all. He could take Dean to a bed. He wouldn’t importune, wouldn’t even suggest they get undressed together, but they could lie together in a bed, their bodies seeking closeness and maybe see what happened.
The Lexus was eventually found in long term parking at the Omaha airport, along with a handful of good looking but ultimately fake passports for a lot of different identities. Dean asked how Bobby had managed that, but Bobby had just shrugged and said, “I got friends in low places.”
“Why don’t you ever wear the traditional clothing?” Dean asked.
“This warding is for when one receives a wound that otherwise might be corrupting. Like from a Grigori or a werewolf.”
“Wedding clothes?”
Six months later, Dean was sitting on the beach, sand in his toes, but no fruity rum drink in his hand. Both Rowena and Missouri Mosley had cautioned him off hard liquor of any kind while he carried. Not that it mattered. The pup didn’t like so much as the smell of hard liquor, even on another’s breath, so that meant at least Dean was not alone in his required temperance.  Castiel could not imbibe either. Because Dean said so.
Sam just smirked and said, “And which one of us is sitting here in a plain ass tunic with a blow out elbow and cinder burns?”
There was even a little bit of embroidery along the front edge, neat and even stitching, just a few basic runes of protection but Dean was touched. He’d never had Sam make him a gift before. Yes, Sam had given Dean the amulet Dean wore habitually, but he hadn’t made that, just was passing it on from finding it at a garage sale.
Dean laughed a little at Castiel’s eagerness. “Maybe later tonight? I should go now. Sammy’s bus is gonna be here soon.”
“Did you make any promises to him?”
“You don’t have to tell my Alpha yet, do you?”
“Not going to forget about that,” Dean said, uncomfortably. He felt like he almost didn’t even need to take the test to know. Now that it had occurred to him that it was possible, it seemed almost inevitable that he was pregnant. That was a worry that he was going to put off and not think about for a bit. It was a disaster, but a disaster for later.
The wind shifted and for a moment, Castiel thought he scented wolf-sign, but no, that acrid, smoky miasma of odor was too close and it was coming from his brother. Jimmy had gone beyond anger to fury and was the verge of a killing rage. He had never seen Jimmy like this. Not even when that strange Alpha had attempted to harm Amelia.  Then Castiel understood the particular scent, the source of it. That was an Alpha parent’s rage. Someone was harming Jimmy’s child. It was sobering to realize it was him. He was the one causing harm to Dean.
So, he found himself calling home. Jo had brought out a telephone from behind the bar. It was an old model, heavy enough that it landed on the bar top with a substantial crash and a slight ring from the metal inside the heavy plastic. At least it wasn’t one of those rotary dial ones, but looked like from about the same era, like they would have still been making those when they made this one. The handset was still connected to the phone with one of those stretchy, spiral cords. He picked it up, and started pushing the buttons, dialing in the long familiar number of home.
Dean rode him, rode him hard and it was the most wonderful, beautiful thing that had ever happened to him. There were some who would say that because Dean and himself were so old, that all passion would have been spent, faded without the fires being fed. It wasn’t, not at all. Passion bloomed fresh, like desert plants bloomed almost instantly after a rain.
Cas stirred a little. He opened his big, blue eyes. Like chunks of sky, those eyes. Like sapphires. He kissed the top of Dean’s head, then smiled. He wasn’t like, being a pest with it, rubbing it on Dean or anything, but his cock was very hard and he looked to be wanting another round. Not that Dean didn’t want that too, but not with Bobby downstairs in his hallway, sounding like he just might climb the stairs in a few seconds.
Castiel came home from California for Christmas that year, the first time in seven years. He’d graduated Sum Laude from his fancy college, landed a prestigious internship that turned into a full time position with a big name company in what they called “cosmeceuticals.” For him, it was a stepping stone to his own line of organic honey-based products, an expansion from what he and Dean were doing with their Etsy shop.
“Dean, you are not slicking at the moment. I would scent it if you were. You are scared and I understand. You have not been courted as you should have been, as any Omega should be. This is so sudden. You will not let me touch you in anyway that would make you aroused and I respect your boundaries. But if we engage in intercourse with you as dry as you are, it will hurt. Both of us, but you more than me.”
“Yeah, it’s kind of not,” Dean said, checking his watch. “It’s past eight already. You said you were going to catch the morning shuttle out to the pack lands today.”
Regardless, this was the midsummer full moon, so it was not just a gathering together but a celebration. The summer, the time of plenty, had come again. Their shared meal was always particularly elaborate and festive, even if there wasn’t a mating planned. There would be fresh strawberries tonight, Castiel had seen, and new peas. They had slaughtered a lamb.
Dean’s real family wasn’t even there at the wedding. Such as there was left of it had shattered in the time Castiel had been away. Sam, Dean’s little brother, had gotten into an actual Ivy League university on a scholarship. Not one of the sibling schools like Castiel had. So John had, according to Dean, accused Sam of being an unnatural Omega and all kinds of things and had told him to get out and never come back. Then apparently soon after, John had taken his last nosedive down into the bottle. He’d been involved in what they were euphemistically calling an accident and been sent down for vehicular homicide.
“You’ll be needing to work today,” Castiel said, sitting up in bed.
“Go on,” Dean said. “I don’t think I could come again.”
“Dardanelle,” Dean said. “The ranch is just outside of Dardanelle. Don’t be a stranger. Come see my spread. That big, dumbass horse of yours is still alive, eating up my feed, not doing a damn bit of work.”
“I have given Ames flowers every single Tuesday since that first Tuesday. I learned to fold those origami flowers so I could do it in the winter when I couldn’t afford to buy flowers. What I’m trying to say is that I have courted Amelia each and every day since I met her and I have no intention of stopping until I’m pile of ashes on the remains of a pyre,” Jimmy said. “You’ve always made much of the fact that we’re true mates, but the fact is, each and every day, we decide to remain mated to each other. You know we’ve had our issues and that despite what people think, it’s not a fairytale romance. I’m not telling you to go buy Dean some flowers, but you have the whole rest of your life to court him and win him over. Have you even told him how you feel?”
“Cas! Wait!”
“No one should be there,” Castiel said. “We should approach cautiously. Dismount and we’ll go forward on foot.”
It was only then that Dean realized that none, not one of the stories that Jimmy had told mentioned a mother of any kind. No Beta woman, not an Omega mate. She or he had died in childbirth from the sound of it, giving birth to Jimmy. If Dean had to guess, he’d have said Omega, since they had worse childbirth fatality rates. He wondered how Castiel seemed not to have earned his father’s wrath, despite being part of the same birth. Jimmy had said I, not we, and the thing about Jimmy was how constantly ‘we’ was on his lips. You couldn’t ask that kind of question though. Dean wondered, if that was why Jimmy was a different kind of Alpha, that his father had written him off when he was still a baby, for something that couldn’t have possibly been his fault.
“I want us to be real mates to each other,” Dean said. That was about as explicit as he could make himself get. “Do mate stuff.”
That wasn’t Josie Sands talking but one of her dozen all but nearly identical Alphas, one with his hair brushed smooth off his forehead. Castiel answered, pushing a packet of paper forward to the man.
Well, shit, Angel was definitely, officially, his problem now. It wasn’t like he could take an adult Omega back to his family if he didn’t want to go. Even if he could force the Omega, Sam would kill him. Shit, Sam was going to kill him anyway. Sam knew not to hold dinner for Dean on Thursdays, but he had to check in if he was going to be out past bedtime and he hadn’t. Dean checked his phone. No message but just a single surly, text, —Dean, where are you?—
When the Impala had rolled up to the Roadhouse, Dean had already said his goodbyes to Ash and Bobby, Joe and Ellen and everyone else and thanked them as best he could. He knew that he never had a chance to re-pay their kindness. He’d wept a little bit at the thought of loosing this new pseudo family, but Ash had done something to Dean’s phone, so it got signal at the roadhouse and everywhere else, and added everyone’s phone numbers at the same time. “You need us to come get you, just call,” Ash had said. “One of us will come get you. Drop everything.”
“No. We’re talking about this now. I need to talk to Castiel.”
The not much of a house turned out to be a five story townhouse in the downtown of the nearest city. It had a well tended little garden out front and a small elevator. It was like the kind of place you saw only in old movies, with sweeping staircases and polished hardwood floors with huge oriental rugs. And marble floors in the foyer. No Christmas tree, but there were garlands and lights and candles.
“Charlie’s coming to baby sit. Did you forget? It’s the annual Christmas Charity Ball for Safe Harbor. You said you’d take me. Tell me you didn’t forget?”
He should have been devastated. His ten year marriage had not withstood the shattering blow it received the night he first laid his eyes on Dean Winchester and decided that he didn’t care if it was a sin or that he was breaking his vows. Yes, there had been nearly a year where the empty shell of the marriage had stood up, not yet fallen apart, as he had frantically tried to apply glue. But now the pieces were falling down and all he could feel was relief.
The doctor and the nurse shared a look. The nurse even rolled her eyes. Even so, the doctor said, “Dean, if you could lie back and put your feet up in the stirrups just so. Scoot down. That’s right.”
“No, he won’t. I don’t know when the next check is coming,” Dean said. If it came at all. It hadn’t come for several months. Dad had a new family now. He’d met and won over a pretty Beta woman and started a family with her complete with a new baby Beta brother. A family that couldn’t include Sam and Dean. Couldn’t include Sam because no Beta woman would have a teenage Alpha stepson in the house with her Beta boy. It was just too dangerous.  Dean, by extension, because the family couldn’t include Sam. No way would Dean let Dad ship Sam off to one of those pre-military academies for unwanted Alpha kids. An older Omega like Dean would have been okay but only as unpaid nanny to the stepmom’s children. Dean had put his foot down at that. He was already raising some Beta woman’s child.
Cas felt a welling up of guilt. It was. It had turned him on so much, Dean’s bare pussy. He knew that modern Alphas were supposed to be against that kind of thing though. It was cruel if done against the will of the Omega, of course, but Dean had given no sign that it had caused him distress. Many Omegas even sought castration out, that they felt better in their bodies when it was done, more feminine which was more how they saw themselves. A male Omega was much less likely to get pregnant ever, unless he was castrated or had hormone treatment.
“And you’re here to obtain birth control for your Omega. Might I ask why? He seems healthy, no prior births and within an ideal age range for pregnancy. I’m surprised you’re not trying to stick a bun in that cute little oven.”
“Why would the actions of another affect my feelings for you?” Castiel asked.
“These are very comfortable and practical. They were a gift from my son and I like them. Whatever vestige of toxic masculinity is making you upset about my footwear choice, I recommend you getting over it.”
“I know what little Dean has admitted to is what I would call abuse. I suspect there was worse we’ll never hear. Bobby and I are trusting him with you, because you’re the best Alpha we know. But if you don’t think you are what he needs, I’ve talked with Bobby and Ellen,” Jimmy said. He really did not deserve his brother, for understanding these things and sharing the hard conversations. “They’re willing to take Dean and go. Become packless, so long as Jo can come back when she’s grown. We could support them distantly.”
“Dean is your brother?” Cas asked, trying to keep his voice as level and innocent sounding as possible.
Dean kept glaring at Cas while they waited. He kept eating at a slower pace. That was good, he thought. Dean was no longer hungry at least. His mate would be taken care of. Cas tamped down any stray thoughts about that. His inner Alpha knew Dean was his, but Cas had spent his lifetime pushing that son of a bitch down and taking control of himself. He should never have let himself get so far gone in the first place as to do what he’d been doing. Sam was there before too long, banging on the industrial metal door of the loft style condo like thunder. Like an apocalypse was at his door. Maybe it was.
“I was scared. I made him calm me with the pheromones, like Alphas can,” Dean admitted. “I cried but it was better when he calmed me.”
Other full moon nights, Castiel would have made sure to leave time for a quick shower after patrol before heading into the long house for the night. Tonight though, the hard run was deliberate. He wanted his scent to be as intense as possible, better to mark his Omega with. In any case, the bath house would be busy as the mated Omegas were preparing Dean for the mating. He and Jimmy continued on to the long house directly, only to be confronted with Amelia.
“It’s pointless,” Dean said. “Omegas don’t graduate high school.”
The sandwich, it was good. It filled up that empty hole inside of him that he recognized again as hunger. All kind of empty places inside of him were filling up, a hole in his heart filling with a certain kind of love he hadn’t even known he still needed. It was like one of those trick pictures in puzzle books. One minute you’re looking at a picture of a young woman wearing a hat. The next minute, the picture seems to change on you and it’s an old woman’s face. The same picture, same eyes, same mind, and yet, a snap second and your whole understanding changes. You see something completely differently. It wasn’t that he loved Jimmy any less. It was just that he could see that love was never what he thought it was.
Dean's first knot came and went in a blaze of meh.
“I’m fine, Alpha,” Dean said.
“Heya, Sammy, whatcha working on?” Dean asked when he got close.
She smiled and said, “Well, let Aunt Charlie show you how to make Excel pivot tables your little bitch. Oh. Fuck. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to say that. Way to stick your foot in it again, Bradbury.”
“If my Dad hadn’t decided to take another deep dive back into the bottle, you probably never would have met Dean. They’d be mated already. I don’t know if that’s what’s best for Dean but it was what he really wanted. I don’t know. Maybe my Dad would have turned abusive without the drink. The way Dean tells it, the panties were just an excuse for you to give him cash to get out.”
Not even knowing what to make of that, he put her down as gently as he could, a bit of a tall order given how she was acting like a barn cat someone was trying to give a bath to. She immediately ran for Amelia once she hit the ground. What the hell happened? His shower that morning had been quick but it was thorough. His clothes were fresh. He hadn’t gotten any throw up on his shirt from earlier. There was no reason why she would have taken poorly to his scent.
“Dean must be devastated,” Castiel said, resting his head in his hands. Dean treated Claire like she was his own child. When he pictured Dean in his mind’s eye, it was with Claire held on one hip. It seemed at times that Dean had the care of Claire even more often than Amelia or Jimmy. Claire was following Amelia like a little duckling now, as she came out of the house with another place setting for the outside table.
Castiel did not reach for the money, though the well of his finances was running a little dry at the moment, especially if Meg couldn’t be persuaded to split the reward for the Devils. “As you pointed out, you didn’t need me. I didn’t bring him back to be hung.”
Dean and Castiel stared at each other several long seconds, until Samuel, the brother, gave Dean a subtle kick to the leg and whispered, “Dean, ask him to dance. This is the big donor I told you about.”
Castiel stopped by the pack offices in Folsom, a thing that had just been opened when he was planning to leave. The office space had expanded, he noticed, seemed almost busy. The radio station was a big portion of their income, but it was not the only part. People on the pack lands were starting to market their hand made goods, furniture, leather goods and the like. That all went through the office, with outsiders hired to run the e-commerce sites. Jimmy had explained it all, how they’d patched together enough income for the pack from outside sources that that no one would go hungry, even if the crops failed. He was glad Jimmy had called him back, but the more he heard about what Jimmy had done during their father’s illness, the less Castiel felt like he would have been truly needed.
“Put a little less delicately than I might, but essentially, yes. I would not want to impregnate you unless we were actively trying for children we both wanted.”
“I’m not going back,” Dean said. “I told you before. You being here is to make it all legal like, but I’m getting my man myself.”
“People expected a lot from me,” Castiel said. “I didn’t always know how to meet their expectations. And Joseph, the Hall Alpha at the time, was even more eager to assign chores than Meg is. Did you like eggs? I could make you eggs and toast.”
Dean knew the bra was beautiful on him, if only because the woman at the shop had exclaimed about how perfect it was. The lace was just the right amount of fancy detail, sheer, but with a lining that matched his skin tone pretty well, so it appeared to be a lot more sheer than it really was. There was a pretty satin bow right between his breasts. The woman at the shop had said it was the perfect balance of sexy and sweet. Dean, for once in his life, felt as beautiful was Cas was always telling him he was.”
“Home test was positive,” Dean said.
“Dean, I heard the ranch isn’t really yours. People at the high school were talking about our family. That when I get married and have kids, it’s mine and you get nothing,” Sam said. He sounded confused. It didn’t sound like he was trying to rub it in or gloat in anyway. No one had really talked to Sam yet about this. He’d been way too young when Dad died to have that conversation. He was probably way too young for it now, but it seemed Dean didn’t have a choice at the moment.
“There’s a reward,” Dean said, confidently. He knew exactly how much could be spared from the family coffers and it would be worth every penny if he could exact justice on the man that killed his father. “What I need you to tell me is which marshal do I send? Who’s the toughest? I need to find a marshal with true grit.”
When the credits rolled, and the computer screen started to queue up the next episode, Charlie asked, “So, you have to catch the shuttle out to Valhalla tonight? I could drop you off and you could stay for another episode.”
They climbed back in through his window. Sam did that bitch thing he did when he thought Dean was spoiling the boys, but he didn’t say anything as he helped Dean haul all the loot out of the closet and downstairs. They worked with colorful paper and tape and those little stick on bows and soon, the tree in the living room was starting to look like it was Christmas for real, with the piles of packages growing bigger and bigger, looking more and more festive.
He hustled, getting the place closed down for the winter and maybe for always, so he could get home in time to pick the kids up from kindergarten. Friday was his day with them. He always took Friday off so he could take the Saturday hours that no one wanted at the garage.
