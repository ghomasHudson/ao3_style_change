from him.
“No, it’s perfect love” John smiles and Sherlock smiles back at him.
“Yeah… I’m sorry...”
Well what do you think I did with those chips?’’
“You really want that life? Because if you’re staying out of a sense of duty, I would prefer you to leave… I don’t want to force you…”
No indeed you aren’t, I believe you fall in the bisexual spectrum,
After a while, Sherlock falls asleep and John watches him contently, not quite believing his luck to be able to have this wonderful man back in his life. John is not really the best religious man but in this moment, he wants to thank god for this because if he knows what the definition of a miracle is, then this is truly one.
“I… John is not my place to say but your wedding has really disturbed him.”
“What question, Sherlock?”
“Don’t get your hopes up. This is the only expression that I remember from my French class at school and that I actually know how to use. Don’t expect any more from me.” John chuckles.
“Though I think it should be Emily Hope Watson Holmes…” Sherlock says looking once again at John
“John… when I was…” he looks down “...away… I realised something...I… discovered what my… feelings” he spits trying to pretend he was still offended by the word itself, Mycroft’s doing probably, thinks John. “I… I don’t know how to explain it John….”

himself, enough suffering for this man.
“I still am. He’s the best thing that ever happened to me, no offence.”
He can sense the panic and the anger flowing in his entire body, he can’t look at him. ‘Don’t look at him, he is not real…’
“W S S H, what does it means?” John asks himself and suddenly he kicks himself as he realises “William Sherlock Scott Holmes, that’s the whole of it… if you’re looking for baby names” he hears Sherlock says in his memory. And he suddenly wants to cry as he realises he is looking at Sherlock’s crib, the very crib that has seen Sherlock grow up from a baby to a toddler…

Suddenly Sherlock shifts in his sleep and John worries he made too much noise and woke him though he doesn’t know how, because it seems like he was standing in the doorway for several minutes without moving. But Sherlock, who has turned himself towards the door, still has his eyes closed and seems fast asleep.
“Yeah right fine!” John whispered to himself taking the champagne list to have a look.
I need to see your brother.’’
Sherlock opens it and looks more closely
“I need to put Willow in her crib.”
He slips the letter under Sherlock’s door, and left the album in the bathroom, so Sherlock could look at it without going out in the corridor if it doesn’t want to.

another of his sons.
“He doesn’t want you to know, any of this, but especially where he is or what he’s doing.”
“Is it because of John’s wedding?” Molly could sense that Sherlock was going to deny it and was preparing a lie “Don’t lie to me. You know you don’t have to pretend with me. I saw the look on your face just before you left the reception and you were sad for the few weeks after and then you suddenly disappear.”
“Goodbye darling!” says John leaving a kiss on the cheek of his daughter “Goodbye Mrs Hudson!”
After some more kissing, both almost out of breath, Sherlock whispers:

“Yes, the last mission did not really go smoothly at all to say the least, he was captured and tortured for a couple of weeks, then he tried to escape and contact me to send help, as the last part was bigger than he expected, but they retraced his phone call and captured him again. They tortured him a bit more harshly to punish him for his escape until I was able to get him out.”
“You shouldn’t apologise for wanting to protect yourself and our child especially when we know the circumstances in which you were in but you should not push them away now for fear of what might happen. These people are our friends Sherlock, they only want to see us happy and know that you’re alright ok? They will understand the distance that you put between them and you once you will have explained.”

of his early days
When the door closes behind him, John takes a deep breath and thinks to himself that maybe Mrs Hudson is right, maybe it’s time for things to change, maybe it’s time to let himself be happy. He decides that tonight, he’ll talk with Mary.
“I can see that your mind is started to go restless and staying inside is starting to drive you crazy.”
Sherlock distances himself from John.
“I would take that as a yes… I guess…”
“Together? You mean as a...”
“I didn’t know what to do! I panicked! God I left him there crying with his heart in his hands for me to take after his confession and I had just run away…”
“No it’s ok, I’m not even angry for that as you probably saved me from a wedding I didn’t want and which probably would have ended up in a messy divorce. No, I was angry because you lied to me even if I understand now that you had my best interest at heart. But I’m definitely glad you came back I promise.”
It hasn’t really changed except for the added crib, he hadn’t realised was here, he thought he had seen one in Mrs Hudson flat… or maybe Sherlock had bought one for when he’s taking care of Emily? Although it seems a bit old to have been bought recently… He decides to take a closer look to the wooden crib and… then he sees some initials on the headboard… W.S.S.H.

TBH I was really surprised by the reactions to this fic as I hesitating a long time before deciding to post it.
“That’s what you think.”
“Well I know it’s a lot of changes but honestly you and I, they have seen it coming so it shouldn’t come as a shock, though I agree that Willow might be a nice surprise.” he chuckles.
“I… please don’t hate me but I had thought… maybe because dehydration or malnourishment or something else made me delirious but...”
“Ok, so your plan B is moving to the countryside to keep bees?”

“So I wasn’t wrong on everything?”
“What are these complications exactly? Is the baby in danger?”
John looks at the ring box in his hand, it’s not how he imagined it moments ago when he was thinking about proposing to Sherlock, and the inside definitely brings him back to reality as this is not a man's ring but a woman’s and he is not about to ask Sherlock to marry him simply because the man had decided to take his own life in front of John's eyes 2 years ago.

John thinks he actually freezes Sherlock, like he
“Sherlock you aren’t cursed; neither is your family… I see your parents… they seem like such ordinary nice people… and while I’m not quite sure about my sentiments towards your brother… I do know that I love you and you aren’t damned, on the contrary you’re an angel, you’re the best and the wisest human being I have ever known…” John says small tears forming in his eyes…
“Love Mycroft, they simply love each other very much. That's how he keeps him around as you said. Speaking of love, have you told your detective yet?”
‘’I enter this room.’’
“Well I don’t know… You aren’t here often… so it’s probably at your flat!” Sherlock said sounding ruder than he intends to.
Sherlock puts the letter on his bed and goes to the bathroom. He sees sitting on the little shelf next to the sink a green
“Emily! John! She the most beautiful thing in the world, the best thing that could have ever happened to you! You deserve it! You should have had that beautiful yet normal life, you always wanted, a wife, children, maybe a dog, boring work at the clinic…” John shut him up by placing a finger on his mouth.

And Sherlock actually feels the tears coming up again.

But she replies too quickly: “No I’m good with water thanks.”
“Are you sure it’s not too late?”

“Yes, bees! They are fascinating John! They are what holds the universe together! They may be small but they accomplished so much! I want to study them and write more papers about them so people can understand their importance!”
“Mycroft wait.” Sherlock, sensing his brother's distress and sincerity, interrupts him as he puts his hand on the handle “I believe that we may need your help.”
“Yes… it’s alright… Sherlock…”
“A date?”
“Then what?”
It’s been a week now that Mary has been dead, a week
when the wave hit us, going back w
“I know dear, but you know how is Sherlock and how he has troubles dealing with his emotions.”
Sherlock’s powerful movements made John come without any other stimulation, exclaiming into Sherlock’s open mouth.
John knew Sherlock was fascinated with bees, but he still didn’t quite understand why Sherlock was telling him this. Nonetheless, he followed Sherlock inside the shack, when the other started making way towards it.
“Today’s not about you, Sherlock.”
“Would you like some tea?” His voice thankfully remained stable.
“Clever,” Sherlock commented with heavy breath.
John knew that the euphoria he felt was the same response the brain had when there was a crescendo in a song. His heart was fluttering wildly and there was nothing else than this movement, their bodies swirling around, Sherlock’s eyes looking into his.
John still couldn’t believe what happened. He sat on the impossibly comfortable hotel couch with no clue how this was his life now.
“That wouldn’t be the strangest date we had.”
“Shit, it’s Lestrade. We must get ready, Sherlock.”
At least, Sherlock allowed this with an infuriatingly benevolent expression.
“I hope you feel at least a bit punished,” he said to Sherlock with resignation.
“I wasn’t doing it alone.”
Of course, Sherlock had it all planned out. A moment later John heard the echo of violin music coming from a restaurant on land. It was quiet but enough to give them a rhythm.
“No, he is dead.”
The right moment for what exactly? What’s that all about? Why
“Not quite. Molly a lot of things have changed since I’ve been away and you might want to sit down to hear what I’m about to tell you. Do not worry though I’m alright, I’m quite well actually.” he says smiling.
as if that would be possible
“And what was this theory?”
the sofa, drinking their tea, when John
“NO! NO! NO! Sherlock you stop it now! You will listen to me! … Are you listening to me?”
A moment passes, John gets up from the bed, and even though Sherlock still seems angry, he also looks hurt, and John can’t stand it. He doesn’t want to hurt him anymore, he can see it in his face, in his eyes, in his demeanour, in everything that he is already a broken man, and that he had endured far worse than just the absence of his best friend by his side, during this two years. He walks to the end of the bed. And the angry facade of Sherlock seems to deteriorate with every step it takes being replaced by sadness, and then it occurs to him that Sherlock probably thinks he is leaving, what he promised not to do just a few minutes ago, and Sherlock hasn’t even told him the big thing he wants to say yet. He stops and looks directly into Sherlock's eyes, and he can see him brace himself for whatever thing John is going to say.
I am open to suggestions so if you have some ideas that you would like me to explore with this story feel free to share them with me in the comments section 😉
John continued to read his book dispassionately. To make everything worse there was a power shortage. He had to light actual candles, it was already so dark outside, despite it being only four p.m.
He pushed Sherlock’s face harshly away and left him on the floor of the living room without another word.
“See that man over there, John?”
“Open your legs, John.”
“Sherlock?”
“I don’t know what to do.”
Sherlock smiled and leaned down to give him another sweet kiss followed by many others. John expected to see his more domineering qualities when they moved to the bed, but Sherlock was nothing if not loving and tender to him that day.
John wanted to go see Naples, and Sherlock agreed without much coercing. To John’s surprise they had a lovely evening of leisure strolls, seeing tourist attractions and eating what was probably the best pizza in the world. John managed to completely ignore the fact Sherlock was paying for everything. Of course, they just had to go by a clothes store. John just had to notice a shirt that said ‘keep cool and listen to daddy’. God, the fates hated him.
John was trying to breathe like a normal human again when Sherlock raised to once again rest against his forehead. He had a wide smile on and looked at John in a satisfied manner, that made John reciprocate his smile.
Sherlock should, no, he deserves to know that John just made an amazing discovery.
Sherlock’s hand was very suddenly off him, as if he was burned. John felt the tension of his body behind him and it made him press on with glee.
“Yeah, very good.”
“You really had to do it this way, huh?”
John didn’t question how much anything cost. Neither of them came from rich families and they could enjoy all kinds of entertainment, so a lot of their week was just exploring Thailand, eating street food, doing little shopping at the Amphawa Floating market, bathing in the sea. The places they visited contrasted with each other, from busy Bangkok streets to quiet smaller islands, where they could try a number of water activities and see the breathtaking underwater world while diving. He supposed the transport cost quite a bit, as helicopter flights were generally pretty costly, as did their evenings in incredible restaurants. Sherlock had some interest in other cultures so he took them to historical sites, let John see Chiang Mai’s temples and hear about the history of the place without being overly annoying by being bored. John was heavy from all the Braised Beef Fire Pots, spicy pad thai, sweet khanom bueang with egg yolk topping, flavorful gaeng tai pla, and countless seafood dishes, everything washed down with vacation-appropriate amounts of alcohol.
John had to close his eyes. It was embarrassing how quickly he could get hard like this.
“This is where I will keep my bees,” Sherlock told him, gesturing to an empty patch of land.
The fingers inside him moved harshly and the smile was wiped from his face.
What Sherlock mostly did was giving John what he needed. Not in the way he did before, by buying him presents and making him go crazy with lust, but by anticipating John’s needs. It just so happened that what John mostly needed was Sherlock’s company and he received that in abundance.
By march, John had a wholly functional kitchen, with gas pipes in their places and other extravagancies such as heating and electricity. John didn’t help much in the process, but it took him a lot of motorcycle trips to Eastbourne. He wanted to use a clean, renewable energy source, and a mix of solar and wind energy had been advised to him, with the region being both one of the sunniest in Britain and hit by strong ocean gales. John didn’t fully understand how it all worked, but he paid a considerable amount for it. Clean energy wasn’t for poor people, but since Sherlock left him a truly ridiculous inheritance, he hoped in the future it would turn out to be a more economic and self-reliant option. In the meantime, he took up simple woodwork, constructing shutters, a table with two chairs, and a few shelves. They weren’t perfect, but he was proud of his efforts and it gave the house a quaint air.
John couldn’t talk. His throat wasn’t able to produce sounds. Sherlock seemed to figure it out, and he moved back, extending his hand for John to take.
“Don’t stop looking,” Sherlock growled into his ear, tightening the grip in John’s hair in threat before loosening it.
“Where did you even get money for that?”
“Your ears are red, John.” He heard Sherlock’s deep voice.
Of course Irene would have friends in such places. John wasn’t even surprised.
I am so sorry you had to see this monstrosity of mistakes and teasing.
He stopped, however, when it came to the Rolex still on his hand. He looked at it and then at the other things. Fine, so the Rolex was expensive, but it’s not like the other things were. He can throw them out and sell the watch on eBay. That sounded sensible.
“They were fine with Mrs Pot.”
“I have no idea. He likes to surprise me.”
Mycroft must have realized talking with John in this state would result in nothing, so he started gathering his things.
“John, think about it. Once you agree, I won’t let you back out.”
John was not going to allow Sherlock to make him embarrassed.
When he reached down to Sherlock’s bulge, Sherlock’s hand caught his wrist. The hold almost hurt.
“Hm?” John wasn’t quite sure what Sherlock meant, but he was ready to do whatever he wanted if it meant Sherlock’s perfect lips would finally encircle his dick.
Sherlock drew back to look into his eyes. John was weak against the desire he could see there, he was weak against Sherlock’s inhuman focus.
“Fine. You clearly intend to keep me here for some time, we might as well chat.”
“It would look weird to just leave you without touching first.”
But Sherlock stopped. John was already at the point of forgetting the game and allowing him anything, but his words reminded him of what they were doing.
He reached up with both of his hands to garb Sherlock’s hand, making it slide down to John’s neck and squeezing it around his throat. He didn’t think Sherlock would comply with the silent request, not with the tremor that ran through his arm, loosening his hold. He was surprised when it tightened again with a steadiness that made John’s instinct kick in, his hands clawing at Sherlock’s arm, his mouth opening wide to catch the breath he was suddenly deprived of. But Sherlock didn’t let go, only making his fingers inside John move faster, harder, and John couldn’t even sob like this. His body trashed and Sherlock tightened the hold around his neck, forcing John back against him and up, lifting John up by his neck to a point he had to stand on his toes, cutting his breath flow completely off. It was only a moment but John felt like he was drowning in sensation, his body panicking from the lack of breath, crazed by the feeling of being penetrated with quick and deep thrusts. It was completely dark before his eyes when his orgasm hit, uncontrollable and painful. He would have shouted if he could. Sherlock did loosen the hold around his neck first, letting John catch desperate breaths while he was still coming, the fingers in him still moving.
John’s fingers began to shake. Seeing this, Mycroft took the box from his hands and put it on the coffee table.
“You didn’t deserve it,” Sherlock’s voice is dark and John almost feels as if it was said against his ear, “good boys get rewards. Bad ones get punishments, John, and I promise, you will get one for disobeying me.”
John: What country are you in?
John realized with sudden clarity that it was not a deduction. Sherlock knew that the cameras weren’t working because he had turned them off. John was now very aware of the danger he found himself in.
This situation wasn’t normal for John. Firstly, because Sherlock was a man, and whatever people assumed, John was not gay. Secondly, this did not resemble any of John’s previous relationships, or courtships, or anything that John went through, really.
“The problem is that I have never been with a man before and now I am suddenly in a very unclear situation with a man that is my roommate, a self-proclaimed sociopath and ‘married to his work’.”
When he returned to the flat he found Sherlock in the kitchen.
“Dare.”
“Because I want this.” Sherlock smiled at this. “Because I’m asking you to. Please.”
“Of course not. If you wish to buy groceries with it, I will not object. It was only a suggestion.”
“You want to gag me? Gag me with these.” He took three of Sherlock’s fingers into his mouth and sucked. He imitated the movement on his member and by Sherlock’s sounds, he was doing a pretty good job.
John’s balls tighten and he shivers.
Sherlock laughed right into his ear.
“We are in a hotel, Sherlock. Couldn’t you have just paid for a room?”
“Is that what you wanted to hear, John?” He said accusingly.
He’s the one testing you
It was not excitement John felt in that moment. It was pure joy.
Sherlock took the hand off, not letting it go.
The guy turned to him without smiling. He had grey eyes, inquisitive and observant, and he blinked when John raised the corner of his mouth in a half-friendly half-flirtatious manner.
“It’s nothing,” John answered with an exhausted smile. His face had that strange twist that it did when he wanted to cry.
“There, done.” Sherlock stepped back, looking pleased with his handiwork.
“I feel like I should warn you. I’m going to kiss you tomorrow.”
“You don’t need to be so on the edge, John. I’m sure you took showers right next to other man in the army and at school.”
“Spit it out, Sherlock.”
Only few people were there and John quickly noticed him.
Sherlock pinned him to the bed, swallowing his protest and John didn’t bite him only because he didn’t want his groom’s lips bleeding at the wedding. But when the phone rang, he used Sherlock’s distraction to wrestle him off, pinning the hand that tried to stop him to the bed with his leg, making Sherlock hiss.
He goes down slowly to touch his cock and that feels good. He closes his eyes and gives it a few strokes, not thinking about anyone’s else hand on him, just lost in this familiar feeling. He always liked masturbating and he felt a particular lack of it these past few weeks when Sherlock was too occupied with cases to take care of him. But the deprivation makes it so much better now, he almost moans from the relief. He half-opens his eyes and sees Sherlock’s commotion, his pupils blown wide and his mouth slightly open. When their eyes meet he can see Sherlock swallow heavily and it makes him smile with mad joy.
“Daddy’s acting spoiled again,” John said with a lascivious smile but kept Sherlock at a distance with his leg.
“And I played along.”
“Precisely, John.”
His worries accompanied him until he fell asleep. When he woke up he forgot where he was, but a pair of startling blue eyes reminded him.
Sherlock smiled up at him, “where would be the fun in that?”
“Once you’re mine I will make sure to give it to you whenever you want,” Sherlock started, his voice coaxing.
“Because you will punish me? Let’s see what you will come up with this time,” his confidence is mostly alcohol talking.
John wasn’t stupid. Sherlock could deduce very well what John was doing there, he probably knew all of John’s masturbatory routines. But John saw no sense in asking about it.
There were things that John disliked about Sherlock but they could never outbalance those that he liked. Sherlock was too singular not to appreciate.
At first, John was at peace. The wind, the sun and the sights were as if taken straight out of a movie. Even Sherlock and his stupid cabrio looked as if from some film.
The thing is, when small things happen you tend not to notice until you look back and connect the dots. John had no right to see it right away.
“What do you mean, like choose clothes for me?”
“Than you don’t have to be nervous about this, do you?” Sherlock answered with a smile.
“Sherlock!”
“No.”
“This is the land I received from my aunt Augusta in her will,” Sherlock explained, starting to walk towards the outskirts of the land next to a forest.
Before John could say anything more, there were lips kissing the back of his neck. John tried not to move, but every time Sherlock bit him, he jumped a little further, which caused Sherlock to put his hand on his throat to stop him. Which caused John to want to die. His mantra became ‘don’t get hard’ and even the cold water wasn’t helping him much.
Sherlock was minimizing skin to skin contact as much as he could. John could see this, as normally there was no way to avoid touching someone if you were putting their shirt on them. When Sherlock put it on, he stood before him and started buttoning it, not even looking at John. Somehow his whole focus remained on the buttons. His breath was calm, regular. John tried to keep his breath the same way. Sherlock would notice the smallest change.
John approached him with a sushi piece and Sherlock opened his mouth obediently, though his face was still conveying the sense of incredulity.
“Well, most girls and boys in his group disliked him for his talent. But there were a few who recognized it as their own fault and were instead taken in with it. Of course, he had many methods of driving those of them that did away.” The man laughed with a face of someone remembering their youth.
I made myself sad with this, ups.
Sherlock’s lips were sweet and bitter at the same time. They tasted of tea and honey. John used his tongue to try to get more of this sweetness and Sherlock opened his lips wider for him, smiling against John.
“John,” the voice was softer this time, the words pronounced right against his ear, “are you all right?”
John was laying on his bed, unable to sleep when suddenly he heard a phone. It was a generic ringtone, and it took him a moment to realize it was the phone he found next to his bed before. He didn’t have time to ask Sherlock about it in the end. He wasn’t sure he should pick it up, but in the end curiosity won.
“Stop,” his voice was low. The warning in it was clear.
He was seriously beyond being able to take more of it for long. Whatever Sherlock wanted him to do, he better make it quick.
“Hold on tight, John.”
If Sherlock thought he was going to comply with his perversions, he was … he was completely right. Especially when he curled his fingers inside John, making John’s jaw drop and repeated the command in a low voice.
John reached down to tip Sherlock’s chin upward and gave him a kiss. He had no chance to stop his own desire when he felt Sherlock’s hardness against him, so moving it along faster was a better idea if they wanted to make it in time for the ceremony.
“I had to do it. It was for your protection.”
“Why not?”
Sherlock had a look in his eyes that made John shiver. He wasn’t sure what made Sherlock look so wild, but the force of his gaze made John put his arms around his shoulders and open his mouth instantly to accommodate Sherlock’s tongue.
John swore those insects were the biggest threat when it came to Sherlock’s attention. He could imagine Mrs Pot irritation when Sherlock returned asking tons of questions about them.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice is stern now, and John would laugh if he was any less embarrassed.
Throughout summer and fall he found plenty of activities that filled his days, whether in his house or garden, or helping Bernard with crops. He knew all the directions the little road running from his house could take him, the forest paths, where you could eat well in Eastbourne. He was getting better at cooking, he gained more skill in planting vegetables and fruits. Whenever someone asked him about the ring on his finger he answered he was a widower, and he got used to the sympathy on people’s faces. John didn’t allow himself to fall into the static depressive state he lived in after leaving the army and before meeting Sherlock, and he managed to be almost content, but he felt anxious about the coming of winter, though he never would have suspected what the cold winds would bring.
He took the gun with him to the bedroom. Sherlock could easily force the locks open, he might even have the keys from Mrs Hudson. If he tried anything, John had to be prepared.
“John.”
No, he had to stop these thoughts.
John looked at him. No sign of giving up.
The possibility made John strangely jealous.
He managed to not talk to Sherlock at all, up to the moment they were leaving the hotel. He suspected Sherlock made himself easy to avoid.
The first thing John did when he was able to think again was laugh.
Sherlock was not doing anything telling in particular, but it took Tom one look at him to ask John, with a subtle rise of the corner of his lip: “Boyfriend?”
“Well, then, do that.”
“Sherlock, god,” he drives his fingers deeper, scratches against his prostate making his hips jump up, “this feels so good. This feels so –“ he’s head hits the wall when he picks up the rhythm, “- full. How could you not have done this to me?”
“You really didn’t have to-“
can have my fun.”
John sobbed.
John didn’t quite get how it was a punishment, but he was sure Sherlock was going to torture him in some way. In fact, he was close to begging for him to start. He met Sherlock’s eyes in the mirror and gave him a slight nod. Sherlock smirked and kissed his cheek with approval.
“Still off-limits? Fine.
It had already been three days since the funeral and John still jumped up with desperate hope anytime someone came to visit him.
John didn’t wait for him to process the situation, he caught Sherlock’s chin and made him look up, in a forceful, restraining way Sherlock sometimes used with him when he wanted to be dominating.
“She’s in a stable condition,” Sherlock threw back bitterly, “And the bullet just grazed me. The murderer was stopped, that’s what’s important.”
Because only his wrists were bound, John could catch Sherlock’s hand in his and raise it to his face.
This time it was Mycroft. John didn’t expect to see him after the last time they talked, but the man claimed he was here on official business.
“Good,” Sherlock’s voice lost the softness from the moment before, “don’t get distracted.”
life because you couldn’t have waited fifteen fucking minutes?”
And the reality was that he was living with Sherlock, was also sort of working with him, was his best friend for some reason, and really, losing Sherlock over confusing holiday emotions was not an option. The revelation that John was not as straight as he thought he was, did not mean he should experiment on it with the one person who was actually compatible enough to live with him long term. He didn’t care how many times Irene called him ‘denial boy’ because of it.
He realized he was wrong from the first number. The sudden burst of energy that was the first piece, left his heart beating frantically to the rhythm and the people around him seemed to disappear, all his other thoughts were unimportant, the only important thing was the mesmerizing performance of these two people who seemed to make impossible things with music.
John hid his face in his hands. This was exhausting.
John didn’t try to hurry while he fed them both, Sherlock eating and drinking when John made him. Strangely, he felt like the one in control, but not completely. Sherlock’s body had relaxed but his eyes were still sharp, not like a trapped animal at all.
John’s real hand travelled to his cock. There was no harm in this, he rationalized. He had much worse sexual fantasies.
(See the end of the chapter for
https://www.superbuy.my/shop/odegard-mens-winter-gloves-bl-s-2/p/322909
Sherlock had the audacity to smirk at him.
“Fine. Let’s say … how about ‘snow’?”
Of course, he was wrong.
“You clearly do, John. You don’t have to worry about your reactions, John, it’s simply physical. And we have little to no chance to run back into the people who were there, except for the murderer.”
That made John come back to reality, a thing Sherlock was quickly trying to undo by starting to move his hand.
Sherlock laughed. “I don’t believe that for a second.”
It was calm in the room but John’s heartbeat was getting faster. He separated them and laid down on Sherlock’s pillow, close within reach.
“Where are you going, John?”
John was not going to admit it wasn’t pain he felt.
“You could at least have send me a massage we don’t have food. I could have bought it on my way.”
Sherlock licked along the underside of his cock but the contact disappeared right away and Sherlock stood up, towering over John with an expression that made him shudder with anticipation. Sherlock backed him up again, taking off John’s jacket, and John could feel the chill of the mirror behind him. Sherlock held his chin, lifted it up to kiss John in a deceptively sensuous manner. John knew by the way he was being held, by the rigidness of Sherlock’s posture, this was not one of those nice and gentle times.
“Are you going to fuck me?” John’s voice broke on the word.
“Get. Out.”
“John!”
was exactly the kind of shit Sherlock would pull.
John: Some Swiss cheese for that might be nice
“Hello, John. So nice to hear you, at last.”
John sighed.
“Your brother! That’s why you went to France? But why would you go so far?”
“Sugar daddy, actually.”
He was also becoming quite aware that the people inside the bar could see them. That made his blush so hard it seemed to break Sherlock’s focus a little.
“To check on the bees, obviously.”
“Do you think it’s not?”
John had the time of his life being unhurriedly and thoroughly worshipped in the bath. He was going to let Sherlock adore him, he would take everything from him, everything that Sherlock was willing to give before he got bored of John. Before he realized John was never that special.
“There’s no point in looking at me like that. Unless you want to substitute yourself with the toy? Because that could work.”
John didn’t even think to question that command. He sat on it and Sherlock once again kneeled before him. He took John’s ankle, and John felt the warmth of it, even through the trousers. He proceeded to put a sock on his foot and John couldn’t bring himself to look away. It had its own tempo, this dress-up session, an the only word he could find for it was languid.
“John,” Sherlock said in a tight tone, “You won’t shoot me.”

Fine, John is not completely blameless and he knows exactly what Sherlock is referring to, but it does not give Sherlock a right to aggravate him like this. Even if he was particularly mean and he does regret it.
“He only likes to steal people. I was giving you an easy way out.”
Sherlock looked as if he was sorry. John noticed he was also still hard in his pants, visible even through his blurry vision.
“Relax.” He urged John, his hand travelling back up slowly, his touches tender. The sponge didn’t return, his other arm was lathered and washed by Sherlock’s hand. So was his throat, and John had particular problems with this image. To wash his chest, Sherlock used both hands, imprisoning John between his arms, forcing him back. His chin was almost on John’s shoulder. He took his time with this part, sweeping over John’s nipples, delineating John’s ribs, his sternum.
“No, thank you. I’m quite alright as it is.”
He slept the whole three-hour car ride to the Downs. Mrs Hudson was hesitant to leave him there alone, and asked him, repeatedly, to go spend the night in an Inn in Friston, instead of the tent, but he declined and she gave up, promising to bring him breakfast in the morning, as well as buying a few necessities they didn’t bring with them. The weather was warm, so sleeping in a tent wasn’t a problem and he spent the night holding onto Gladstone, though he couldn’t sleep most of it. The only thing that could make him sleep for a sensible time these past few weeks was Sherlock’s elixir, though it had its side-effects and John was also running low on it.
John was observing the waves reflecting the lights form the party. Their sound made him a bit calmer.
“And a collar is going to help with that how?”
“Fine, ‘master’. What are we doing here?”
John washed up with cold water and went out in a bathrobe. Sherlock had manic energy about him, and John soon saw what made him so.
Though Mrs Hudson was certainly against the idea, and while their cases increased and life became even more complicated, she was often the one the playful pup stayed with.
He blames Sherlock for this, and Adler in part, because otherwise, he might have never gotten the idea. He never tried to pick up a guy before, he never particularly wanted to, and the only reason he did was because he was, he admits, a bit jealous.
“It was made for you.”
“You’re welcome, John.”
He approached the bed, stopping before John, extending his hand. John realized then, that Irene was right. He didn’t have to take it. Nothing was keeping him here.
“Your techniques not helping you now?” John goaded.
Sherlock was texting all the time in the taxi and completely ignoring all of John’s questions, so John found out at the airport they were apparently going to Italy.
John hardly registered the words. Sherlock could pitch his voice so low that anything he said sounded like an invitation. John could feel himself being enveloped by this velvety sound to the point he couldn’t even react when Sherlock finished reading and approached John again, taking his chin in his hand.
“Only my shirt,” Sherlock added after a dramatic pause.
“If not you, than who?”
Sherlock: Good. SH
“Your turn. Truth or dare?”
Obviously, John did actually masturbate when Sherlock was away on his government-related jobs. Firstly, Sherlock was not the boss of him, and secondly, he would never know about it. Or so John thought. He sometimes forgot that half of the time, Sherlock was able to tell if John was lying.
Sometimes, when you live with a crazy person long enough, you forget they are, in fact, not right in the head. If John could get used to body parts in the fridge than he could get used to anything Sherlock might come up with.
“I’m very sorry I can’t attend the wedding.”
“Well, if you’re asking for my opinion I think you’re pretty into him. Why not try it out?”
The key was on the bedside table and he reached it from his place on the chair, leaning into Sherlock to see behind him. He managed to open the handcuffs only to have the full coiled strength off Sherlock’s body freed to lift him suddenly up, the dildo sliding out of him uncomfortably.
Something had gone very wrong and he found himself calling out familiar names.
Sherlock’s eyes darted to him for the first time since he came through the door, before quickly moving back to his book, which John just realized was on the American serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Before Sherlock could even voice it, John knew what the man was going to say. He was going to comment on—
John released an airy laugh. It was the same surname name Dreln was complaining about.
Lestrade turned to John, who had also appeared to relax somewhat out of the eldest Holmes’ presence. “Have you gotten word?” he asked, to which John’s shoulders dropped as he shook his head. “Least that explains why the cavalry arrived so fast,” he commented in regard to the eldest Holmes, garnering a small snicker.
Lestrade furrowed his brows, now understanding why there was no secondary vehicle at the scene. The Square was roughly three miles from the flat on Baker Street, and it was rarely empty, and even if it were, it was unlikely the bar across the street would have been. It could have very well meant that a passer-by had been a witness to the young genius being transferred from one vehicle to another without ever realizing what they had seen. Either that or—
“Oh, we actually have very little interest in you, Sherlock Holmes. But you see,” he held up his phone to face Sherlock. “Your brother, Mycroft, has been a thorn in our side, as of late and we – do smile pretty, won’t you? – never do like people intervening with our affairs.” The flash from the camera went off as Sherlock gave a sardonic smile. He brought the phone down and continued texting.
”—he caught himself as the pole began rolling across the floor—“of doing this myself.”
“—bored.”
John said nothing, only nodded as Sherlock raised the fork again.
Had some stuff go down in my personal life and have kinda been put on hold.
The next is in the works! (^ v ^)
A whimper escaped when another digit entered, which he muffled by biting the inside of his mouth.
After manoeuvring the body into the back seat, the person who had climbed out of the back of the van approached the driver of the blue people carrier. There was another verbal exchange before they got into the driver’s seat of the smaller vehicle. The vehicle started up and drove off, turning right at the intersection out front of the sports pub; meanwhile, the other two returned to the front of the van, the man with the tank top getting into the driver’s seat. Leaving the Square, they made a right along with the other, heading towards the river.
“We managed to retrace the GPS on Freak’s phone,” Donovan said as she handed the clipped papers to Lestrade, who had returned to the precinct after the scene had been cleared and evidence had been sent off. His eyes scanned the first page right as Donovan pulled the second page over. “There was a ninety-second stop near Ebury Square before they started travelling again, losing signal about where it was recovered this morning.”
John was next to him, hand on his shoulder as he shook him.
Donovan adverted her eyes to the female, whose expression was filled with anxiety and concern.
It only took a few seconds without oxygen before his only good arm tried to fight back out of survival. It was easily halted as Dreln grabbed his already broken wrist and pinned it to the ground, leaning forward with his face mere inches from his own. With his blood pounding in his ears, he only caught the words “damn” and “beautiful” before the sensation of Dreln’s mouth on his own.
“What’s wrong?” He maintained his light-hearted tone, not wanting his mate to slip away in a feeling of mistrust. It took a moment for Sherlock to reply, but when he did, John failed to understand.
Seeing Mycroft’s indifferent expression, John had to fight every fibre of his being wishing to treat the eldest Holmes as he deemed fit.
“We’re already on it,” he cut John short, handing John back the slip. “Going by the footage, they’re held up in the direction of the river.”
Sherlock nodded, his gaze still distant. John smiled and leaned forward, brushing their lips together. The action had drawn Sherlock out from whatever hole he had managed to crawl into and his hand reached up to grab John’s. There was a moment’s pause between them as they stared into each other before Sherlock shut his eyes and reinitiated the kiss. It was awkward and unfocused, but, for next minute, they took solace in the comfort they had not realised they had become so accustomed to throughout the years.
He set his hand on Sherlock’s, giving it a light squeeze.
The nurse – Frank – fell silent as Donovan took the lead and approached him. The sergeant grabbed the man’s shoulder and pulled him forward, away from the wall. The man allowed her behind him to grab his wrists and meet them to his back, all the while focused on Lestrade and the weapon drawn on him. He locked eyes with him as Donovan cuffed him, expression showing nothing but contempt as his mouth formed a tight line. Once the handcuffs were in place, Lestrade sheathed his weapon. He and his co-worker exchanged glances. Donovan placed him in a modified escort hold before Lestrade grabbed the man’s upper arm, pulling and jerking him towards the door, moving passed the small crowd of nurses and patients they were not even aware had gathered.
The only qualm was not knowing where to begin.
Even against his will, he found himself back in Mycroft’s office, curled into the foetal position on the office floor. With his fear breaking around him, the office morphed along with him. The painting of the Queen had deteriorated with the oils running down the portrait, the desk had rotted, the lamp had rusted along with the chairs – nothing seemed right. He lifted his head off the floor when the silence echoed around him.
Once again silence encompassed them.
Subconsciously, he found himself reaching out and touching the young man’s shoulder.
“Oh, daddy’s mad,” Dreln snickered as he glanced to other, who shoved his phone back in his pocket and zipped his suit back.
The sound of sirens echoed as Donovan pulled up the patrol car to the front of the building, before she shut them off, ensuring Lestrade’s attention. The impatience exuded from the car, leaving Lestrade to sigh while John appeared on the edge of breaking.
His last print on the earth would be of him being beaten and violated by multiple men, his limbs scattered throughout various places around the country. The only thing he found himself hoping was that he would already be dead before they began the dismemberment, though judging by the Irishman’s actions, it was unlikely.
“So incessant, John,” he said as he shut his book and sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the couch. “I could do with some nutrients, I suppose.”
It was apparent the man was on immediate edge, but given John’s nonchalant tone and demeanour, he took another drag before nodding. “Sure,” he responded as he held his cigarette in his mouth and pulled his pack out. Offering one to John, the Army doctor gave it a once-over before putting the end in his mouth. He acted to search his pockets, then gave an exaggerated sigh. “Need a light, then?” The man reached into the pocket of his brown hooded sweatshirt, pulling out his lighter and offering it.
He could feel his nasal passages burn when he saw the confused expression written on his younger brother’s features, something he had not seen since they were younger; and something that made his own guilt sink to his chest. He took the few steps to stand next to the bed, his hand reaching out subconsciously to touch his brother’s face. The moment his fingers made contact with Sherlock’s cheek, the young detective flinched. Even with Sherlock’s typically stoic features, there was a fear of ambiguity behind his eyes at his brother’s uncharacteristic behaviour.
Right as Sherlock gasped through the cloth, the man began pouring water over it.
The psychological damage may be more than anyone expected.
But at least that means I get to work on this while I save up for a laptop to actually take with me while I'm gone for weeks at a time.
Sherlock’s jaw clenched as his face creased, his throat and eyes begging to release an unfamiliar emotion.
“Thank you,” John said as he left the room.
John scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Francis said he’d let you know I was coming.” The man eyed him suspiciously, questioning whether or not to take his word. When John saw the man’s arm relax, though not direct the gun away from him, he raised his brows. “Said I could have some fun with the piece of shit downstairs.”
“Finally decided to fist-fuck the bitch?”
John directed his attention to Sherlock, watching as the man’s chest rose and fell, his breathing even. Even with the commotion and his near loss of life, the younger man failed to stir. Donovan was watching the doctor, her gaze stern and almost empathetic.
If you do, I can't finish. (> v <)
“I don’t believe that to be in your best interest,” he spoke calmly, which set the man on edge.
There was a pause before Sherlock’s eyes glazed and he responded in a soft response, “John.” John nodded again, though Sherlock was still unfocused, his eyes appearing to shake. “I’m sorry,” Sherlock trailed out, his voice distant as he finally met John’s gaze.
“Well, while you’re contemplating, zoom in on this,” he said as he managed to push in half of his forearm, gaining a gasp and yell as a response. “Fuck…I don’t think I can fit anymore. Feel like the circulation’s being cut off from my arm.”
John frowned.
“Members of Scotland Yard? You don’t say,” Sherlock interjected as he finally brought a piece of the chicken to his lips. John’s brows were furrowed into curiosity while Lestrade’s look was sympathetic. Before anyone could ask how or why, Sherlock continued, “The knowledge they had of standard protocol and shift work, there had to have been at least one person involved in the internal affairs. I may have been incapacitated, but don’t doubt me for even a moment. Perhaps if you gave me more information, I could assist your investigation further.”
The man smiled, his expression dark. “I’ve read your blog – the way you and your boyfriend meander about London solving crimes. Well let me give you a good old-fashioned mystery, Sherlock Holmes.” He brought his face close to the detective’s. “London’s most famous detective goes missing; his lover and government brother try to find him, but they don’t realize the harder they try, the more the detective suffers. All it would take to end it is the detective’s important brother to drop his own investigation. Now I ask you, Mr. Holmes: how would this mystery end in the mind of the famous detective?”
The last time he recalled being scared, he was under the influence of a drug on Dartmoor in Devon. Prior to that was when while he was still with his parents, Mycroft had returned home from University and his brother had—
For the first time, his hands were shaking as he reached down to Sherlock’s carotid artery, feeling for a pulse. Sherlock’s face was bloodied and swollen, dried semen clinging to his hair and cheeks, his lips tinted a light shade of blue. When he failed to pick up a pulse, John could feel his eyes burning.
Sherlock tried using the pole the fluids hung from to support himself as he finally was able to get both feet on the tiled floor. “They’re out their right mind if they think for a second I’m using that,” he said in reference to the bed pan the nurse had set next to the bed earlier that evening.
“You know, I really do like you, Sherlock Holmes. Which is more than I can say for most people we’ve had visit.” He released an airy breath. “I may actually feel remorse later on down the road.”
“You can’t leave me, Sherlock Holmes. I won’t let you,” John said quietly before he pulled his head up to peer at Sherlock’s face. “Do you have any leads?” he asked Mycroft, who sighed.
He crossed the room to the entryway lacking any form of barrier.
The physical change in him was apparent, evidenced by his ever-creasing brow line and dangerously still hands. “And why didn’t you ask for Sherlock’s help?” John’s voice was starting to rise, his anxiety and frustration coming to the surface as he managed to look away from the photos and pull his attention back to Mycroft.
And with John’s smell all around him, he can actually imagine that he is still here with him

Sherlock looks up a bit but not quite looking at John yet.
“Oh my god!” John takes a big breath as it hits him.
“I suggest a yellow outfit instead of the red, though they may keep the black hat, it will go well with the bee theme of the nursery!” replies Sherlock joining John on the joke and the two of them starts laughing, Mycroft looking at them confused to what just happened.

“Yeah whatever you wish to call it but you were definitely in love with him.”
Sherlock is a bit surprised at first and does not know quite how to react at first but then imagine that the best thing to do should be to return the hug so that’s what he does.
“This is why you didn’t tell me you loved me before? Because you were afraid of what you father would sa

The doctors and the nurses are rushing Sherlock in the back of the ambulance when John hears Mary ask, behind him. God, he almost forgot that she was there.
“I asked Mrs Hudson this morning, but she didn’t seem to know… have you seen my grey jumper lately?... It’s been quite a while since I have seen it…”
Mycroft told you? Eh?” Sherlock turns around his face furious despite the tears in his eyes.
Sherlock continues to read the letter, with the album next to him.
And the only thing Sherlock can do between hiccups caused by the tears is muttering John’s name.
He had Doctor Watson, he had, I’m coming to this.
“I know. No worries I got over it now Sherlock. I met someone actually, nothing serious yet but I like him.”

“John, you have the right to be happy. We all make mistakes. You have the right to want out of this wedding if you feel miserable, believe me, I know from experience, that it doesn’t matter if we said yes at a precise moment at the altar and believe that we had made the right decision, we still get the right to change our mind too! That’s why divorce exist! And believe me, it’s easier than to get your husband executed to free yourself from an abusive relationship!”

You act like a father, putting her and her safety first and foremost, and I agree that this is our jobs as parents, but my role as a partner is to remind you to take care of yourself too, don’t forget your needs in the midst of it all.”

As Sherlock has not arrived yet, John wants to take advantage of his absence to check if what Mycroft said about the file is true. So he goes to Sherlock’s bedroom and opens the drawer of his bedside table and indeed there is the file right here.
“Harry?”
I hope you'll enjoy it !
John decides to search for his jumper some more but he ends up finding another secret that Sherlock seems to hide.
After a while when both of their tears have stopped falling, and John is lying in Sherlock’s hospital bed, with curly hair tickling his neck, Sherlock speaks again, remembering suddenly the conversation they had before he fell asleep “John?”
Sherlock composed himself, he decides to face John.

“No!!!!!!!!!!!...No!!!!!!!!!!...” he yells and moves violently in his bed, grasping his sheet his knuckles turning white. John takes a few steps closer, standing next to the bed without knowing what to do.
“It’s just that… please don’t be angry John… I just wanted to…”
“Sort of, but what really kept me going on was the fact that I promised myself to come back to him because I needed to tell him something.”
“Sorry? For what?”
, Sherlock, anything.” says Angelo with a big smile on his face. ‘Finally!’ he thinks to himself.
“Later?”
“You’re a good friend Molly and I do love you just not that way.”
“I have been thinking of reducing my hour at the clinic, working part-time so I have more time for you and Willow.”
Maybe if you don’t believe me, you’ll believe the facts…’’

“Hello Mrs Hudson!” answers John giving Emily to her “I’m sorry I’m running a bit late, have been searching for one of my jumpers for almost half an hour this morning! By the way, if you find it tell me maybe I left it here, it’s the grey one.”
“Hello John! Hello sweetie!” says Mrs Hudson as she opens the door.
Oh and one more thing, I want this day to be the last one you apologise for what you’ve done, I said I’d forgive you before, for leaving me for two years, and I meant it, I don’t want you to spend you entire life apologising for this, ok? I want us to move on from this, ok?’’
“So he is dead, right? He didn’t disappear as we heard on the TV.”
“You’re sure?”

He almost runs to John, takes the file from him and puts it back in his bedside table drawer.

some ideas about all the things concerning John’s life so it’s only fair that John knows these things about him too if they want to be equal.
“He still isn’t answering any of my calls or texts, I don’t understand, I am really worried Mrs H.”
“I wasn't expecting this anyway...” says Sherlock smiling.
“We were...” says John looking at the floor with sadness in his eyes.
“But you love working at the clinic, I don’t want you to make such sacrifice either!”
“What? Why?”

“Right.” Time to be brave then, it’s a good thing, it’s moving on, that’s good.

“Well… I did what you’re supposed to do to make a child fall asleep I assume… reading her a children story while rubbing her back using clockwise circular movement...” Sherlock isn’t sure if he did the right thing by looking at the puzzling look on John face “…That’s not what you do?

Sherlock cries a bit louder now…
“I was counting on some more detail,” Sherlock’s hands were playing with the skin on his stomach and chest.
“Do I have to be naked?”
“You said,” John opens the bathrobe to free his hardening nipples, “You want to know things about me,” he licks the tips of his fingers, looking straight into the camera, “let me show you,” he brings the hand down slowly, exploring his chest, “how I want to be touched.”
“Indeed. I phoned earlier.”
He meant to say something in return, but Sherlock turned his attention back to watching a girl in a bunny costume getting naughty with one in a wolf costume.
John switches the setting higher and he has to stop talking for a moment because the feeling is too intense. He can only open his mouth with a wordless moan.
He stood still as a statue when Sherlock encircled him in his arms, his hand caressing John’s back soothingly. John blinked against the material of his shirt as Sherlock kissed his temple as if he was a child in need of assurance.
“Are you alright, John?”
The detective didn’t even look up from his microscope.
John didn’t quite expect it when the lift stopped moving but he was not too worried when Sherlock took hold of his body and kissed him. Even when he was backed into the mirrored wall, he didn’t think much about it. Making out in an elevator was hardly anything unwanted, and they were just returning from dealing with a case, so they were not in any hurry.
He reached into the shopping bag once again and fished out dark grey gloves. John could put these on by himself, but Sherlock seemed to have a different idea. The moment John took his hand out of his pocket Sherlock grabbed it, not hard, but purposefully, and proceeded to put on the glove. When he passed to John’s other hand John noticed the police were staring at them. Only then he realized that there was something inexplicably intimate in dressing someone, even if those were only winter clothes.
The winters were the worst, as he had less to do and couldn’t walk as much. He finally decided to have the Internet installed and buy a laptop. The first thing he did was buy online lessons on beekeeping and learning everything on the subject before he started looking for trustable vendors to buy the hive, the tools and the bees. He installed everything in the spring, anxiously waiting when he let the bees inside, fearing for the queen while the bees ate through the candy to free her from her cage. Fortunately, the bees seemed to adjust well to their new home and so, aside from two dogs and a dozen chickens, he had ten thousand small creatures under his care.
