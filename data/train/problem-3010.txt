“I know. I’ll make it this time, I promise. I think I’m just…” He shifts on the bench. “I jacked up my shoulder, so I’d probably better take a little time off before I end up having to see a doctor.”
Jack nods and walks back to where the ambulance is still parked with its lights flashing. Garth stands nearby at the fire engine, stripping off his gloves.
"Well about all ya do is get on my ass about stuff," Dean says, spreading his arms. "I'm just—" he's cut off by a sudden cough. He coughs up blood into the crook of his elbow, then winces. "I'm doing what I do, Cas," he finishes. "You can't make me into something I'm not."
"I was going to have her kill you, but I realized you weren't at fault." He eyes Sam for a moment. "I thought you might have been the reason Dean left."
“Do you?” Dean feels tears well in his eyes and mix with the blood on his lashes. “Because it seems like all you ever did was try to get out.”
He slides his pistol into the holster clipped to the back of his waistband, tucked neatly into his jeans and easily covered by the Carhart jacket he puts on last. Then he stuffs everything into his duffle bag and heads out to his car. He throws the bag into the passenger seat—he’s gotten used to setting things there again—and runs a hand over the Impala’s hood as he walks to the driver’s side.
Cas stifles another sob and strokes Dean's cheek with his thumb. "I'm going to miss you, Dean Winchester."
"Are you? I haven't seen much of you for the past few days and I wanted to…ensure you haven't been coughing up blood again."
Without saying anything, Cas kneels beside him and reaches out to touch his forehead. Dean's left arm snaps up and he locks his hand around Cas's wrist.
He looks over at him for what feels like a long time. Dean seems to be persistently ignoring him, turned away from him as he smokes and watches the sky.
Cas's eyebrows knit up on his forehead. Of course he hates this idea. He can't stand the thought of Dean choosing to die, but how is it different, really, than what he's been doing this whole time?
He doesn't know how long it takes before he feels like he can breathe again. He's still stroking Dean's hair, even many minutes later.
Sam is quiet for a while. Dean tilts the bourbon bottle to see the light reflect off the copper coloring on the label.
"Yes, and that reason was Dean. Well, he's out of the picture. You need help, Crowley, I don't doubt it. You have this kingdom set up so that you need a second, a right-hand man." He spreads his arms and smiles. "I'm right here."
"Look at how human you've become!" Alastair says. "You can't even heal. That'll be the last mistake you ever make."
Probie: probationary firefighter. Someone in their first year with the department. The one who gets stuck doing the dishes, mopping the floors, and washing the ambulance.
The snarling stops and he hears footsteps backing away. After a couple seconds, Sam uncurls and rolls onto his back, clutching his side. Standing above him with a contemplative but unreadable expression is Crowley.
He’s still trying to come up with why Cas’s claim feels wrong to him when the curtain opens and Jack returns. Cas quickly stands from the bed
"This stuff works wonders," Alastair says, looking at the mix of deep red blood and purple poison on his blade. "Wherever did Crowley come up with it?"
The last tattoo Cas observes is the first he ever noticed; it's the black silhouette of a dead, gnarled tree that starts between Dean's neck and shoulder and reaches up to curl around the back of his left ear and disappear into his close-cropped hair.
"I don't even know what's me and what's the Mark," Dean admits, turning his head toward Cas but not fully looking at him. "I've been a demon for so long, I…I don't really know who I am as a human."
A woman lies on the floor. She's probably only a been dead a few minutes. She has a horrible, bloody gash from the middle of her chest to her stomach, so neatly straight and so deep that it must've been done slowly, very slowly. A knife sits upright, dug into the carpet, beside her.
"Why him?" He shrugs. "It was convenient. Don't forget though, I saved his life. You'd never have seen him again if it weren't for me."
There’s a horrible cracking noise above them, loud enough Jack hears it even over the fire and the hose and the sucking of his respirator. He hears someone start to shout over the radio—it’s Rufus’s voice, but he can’t tell what he’s saying.
He's here to kill the king of hell, and his sidekick as a bonus. They've done some things that the angels will not forgive—disrupted the natural order enough to warrant attention from heaven. But this is not the scene he imagined. The two men in the bar appear to be having a normal conversation, complete with annoyed glances, laughs, and even a nudge on the arm from one to the other.
"No no no no no," Sam says, probably too many times. He's starting to feel lightheaded. "You're gonna…you're gonna tell me what the hell's going on."
“Your shift partners speak highly of you,” she says with a smile, “though they wouldn’t want me to tell you that.”
"I don't know," Dean sighs, and it's probably the most honest three words Cas has heard out of him yet.
Across the room, in the doorway to the bathroom, Dean is on his knees, doubled over as he vomits blood onto the tile. The rest of the hotel room is a disaster; the television is smashed on the floor, the standing lamp has been knocked over and its light bulb shattered, the paintings that were on the walls are scattered across the carpet, and a single knife is embedded in the wall.
"Hold on," he says before the angels start flying away. "I just—I need to know. Dean's soul, did it make it to heaven?"
He puts on his helmet and revs the motorcycle. When he peels out of the parking lot, he's headed for the first location on the map.
He steps aside and says, "Don't forget what I've done for you. If you can set aside all those pent-up human emotions for a moment, you may have a different idea about who's in debt to whom."
Crowley stands up. "But I pulled you out of that car, Dean," he says, raising his voice but not yet reaching a shout. "You wouldn't
"I know. You like to say I did most of it. And I appreciate it," he added quickly before the angel could speak, "but don't make me out to be a hero, Cas. I'm way too far gone for that."
"I don't know. It would have made sense for me to find out about him. I mean, if he died, he should have gone to heaven, even if his soul was so young."
"Good lord," Dean laughs. Cas has never seen him look so emotional. "I never thought my younger brother would be taller than me."
"Nice, isn't it?" Alastair says. "Borrowed some of that from Crowley. I believe Dean here has used it before."
“I think there are demons picking off hunters on purpose, Dean. It sounded like she got attacked right before the call dropped.”
But for all their gusto and all the time they spend talking about how to get at Lilith, they’ve made very little progress. Tracking Lilith isn’t inherently difficult—Cas usually knows where she is—the problem is that she moves often, and fast. Cas can’t just take Dean to her, because Heaven would know about it, and by the time Dean catches up to where she’d been, she’s usually gone, leaving a trail of bodies or traumatized survivors behind. Cas says he’ll kill Lilith himself if he has to, but it’s a one-shot deal; once he makes an attempt, the Host will know about his treason, and he won’t get another. But even an angel can’t take out five to seven extremely powerful demons alone, and Lilith is cautious. Timing is crucial.
He doesn’t bother driving back to his motel, just drives until he finds the parking lot of a long-since-closed gas station and stops, shutting off the car and digging a bottle of tequila out of the trunk.
“Okay. I’ll lead. If you can’t see me, make sure you can still hear me or touch me, okay? If you get disoriented, remember you can follow the hose back out.”
Dean shakes his head. “I should’ve done it the moment I turned eighteen. I just spent so long thinking he was some kind of hero and I was the one who was fucked up, I—”
"Yes," Dean says tightly. "We've got it taken care of." He doesn't understand why these people care.
"Then go. If there's one thing that I figured out about you, it's that you're a goddamn nerd. You're brilliant, Sam. Go do what you want to do with your life."
Anger flashes in Alastair's eyes, but he smiles. "Don't worry, little abomination." This sounds like an old name Dean is used to hearing, but Cas can see it still strikes a chord with him by the tightness in his jaw. "I've come prepared."
"No," Dean says, almost too quickly. "Just stupid stuff. Uh, how are you? What'd you do last night?"
Dean glances back at the demon, still sneering. "Collateral." He pulls out a knife. The demon struggles, but there's a devil's trap painted onto the wall behind it and it can't smoke out.
He should've known this long before he selected Amelia Richardson as a target. He should've chosen a different day, or injured Sam so he had to go home and he and Dean would never be in the same place together. But Dean was already suspicious. As long as Crowley didn't do any more to arouse that feeling, they'd be fine.
When he stops the car in the inn’s parking lot, he tries to find words, but he keeps coming up short. Despite everything Sam had said after their dad died—about hunting, about doing the job like they always had—Dean had believed him when he said he wanted to go back to Stanford and see it through. He’s imagined Sam returning to hunting, plenty of times. But never very seriously, and never like this.
Dean scoffs a little. "For everything. I've been either a dick or a burden to you from the moment we met. But for some goddamn reason, you're still here. I can't begin to apologize for what happened. You have every right to just leave me here, but you don't. I don't know why and I don't think I'd understand if you told me." He shakes his head and looks down at Cas's tie instead of his face. "You've given me the only life I've really had, Angel. I owe you everything."
Dean nods. "Good." He pats the bed next to him and Cas sits. "I hope you've…taken that to heart. I know heaven's all messed up with exiling you, but…you did a good thing."
“You need to shut that bullshit down. You think too much. You’re a basic EMT, it’s not your job to think. It’s your job to follow instructions. Legally, I’m responsible for that patient anyway. If you’re going to freak out every time you don’t know exactly what to do, you’re in the wrong damn job.”
"Oh, good," Sam says vaguely. "An angel. But why did you care? You were gonna kill me on a hunch, plus you're a demon. Doesn't that mean you're, like, evil?"
"Thanks, Crowley," Dean says, rubbing Julius's head before shooing him back toward the king of hell. "Take care of him for me, will you?"
“Castiel. I don’t know where you are, or what’s happening to you right now, but if you can hear me… I know you wanted to help me. I know you want to save humanity, I know you do. So, help me. Please. I don’t want to die. I don’t want my brother to die. We can stop this, I swear, we can kill Lilith before Sam does, but I need your help. I need you, Cas.”
“Yeah.” Jack doesn’t remember telling him that, but it doesn’t seem impossible, either. “He said he almost didn’t tell me about it because of that. And even though he’s okay now, and I’m okay now, it just reminded me of that loss, because it’s always there. And now that girl is without her mother so she has to deal with that too, and I just—I hate that this is the way things are.”
“Molecules? That’s the best you—give me that back.” He snatches his pie and fork back. “God, it must suck to be an angel.”
"They say it takes a long time to bleed out from the stomach," Dean says, though he moves his blood-covered hand away from the wound and pulls his jacket to the side.
In the morning, the station smells of coffee and Pine-Sol, and people’s bags are in the hallway as they trade rooms at shift change. Jack leaves his bag outside the door of the room they said would be his and wanders to the common area. There are two coffee mugs on the logo-engraved table and a sweatshirt slung over a chair, but no one is around. The fluttering in his gut gets a little more frantic, and he starts to wonder if he came in at the wrong time, or if he’s about to be the subject of a prank.
“Bobby and Ellen were on me,” Dean says forcefully. “And I’ll go to my grave with that guilt, but that’s not—”
Cas is trying to meet his eyes, but Dean stubbornly looks back up at the stars. “It’s not what you’re thinking.” When Dean doesn’t respond, Cas looks down at his hands, turning them over as if examining his human form. “You humans burn so brightly, and for such a very short time.”
Dean blinks. Cas. He has Cas pinned to the bed and he's leaning over him with the blade of his knife at his throat. Cas is apprehensively glancing from the hand Dean uses to hold the knife and the sharp pendent swinging just an inch or two from his face.
But now…he doesn't know what to do. He can't go back to heaven. He knows they'll have been watching him. They'll know about this…affair? Is that the right word? They don't understand or care that Dean isn't really a demon, or how they both gave up everything to commit to curing him. (If, Cas reminds himself, it's even possible.) To the angels, the greater good here would be killing Dean. He's a demon to them, so there is no problem of wasting life, and he's wrought so much destruction upon the world that it simply makes sense.
“I’m sorry, Dean. It’s just… I’ve had a moment to think now, and I realized this is a bad idea. For me. For you, too, I think.”
With Carol in the care of the ED staff, Dean steps outside and finds Jack cleaning the gurney, looking troubled.
It takes a moment for Dean to respond. Then he nods slowly. "Yeah. I suppose I am. What else is there to do?"
“I still hear flames from somewhere else,” Dean says, turning off his hose but still needing to shout to be heard. “Can you tell where it’s coming from?”
The first demon almost looks like he's going to make a move, but he just spits at Cas's feet. "Come on," he growls to the others, and they leave.
Dean puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder and steers him away a few steps. “You want to go sit in the ambulance? I’ll be there in a few minutes.”
Garth and Jack help Dean stand and sit on the gurney. He’s doing what they ask him to, but he seems dazed. He hasn’t spoken since they got him out, and every movement seems to hurt him.
He flips the phone shut and paces the width of his car once more before stopping. Cas. He needs to talk to Cas. He swore he wouldn’t keep drinking himself to sleep, but if there’s a time to do it, it’s now.
Dean hasn’t told Sam about Castiel. He’s not sure why. Maybe it’s that “So, there’s this angel who visits me in my dreams” is a whack-job way to start a conversation, or maybe it’s that Sam has a different relationship with faith than Dean does, or maybe Dean just doesn’t want to bring it up until he has hard proof that Castiel exists and that he is what he says he is.
The demon, whom Dean unsurprisingly doesn't recognize, doesn't speak, but the girl gasps. It must have been the eye trick.
Cas hears the bathroom door open. Dean hesitates, then withdraws, keeping one hand around Cas’s shaft.
He’s at Bobby’s. The air is cold—Bobby’s house is usually cold at night—and the film of sweat he worked up during the dream pulls the heat from his body, almost enough to make him shiver. He tucks the gun back under the couch cushion, then tugs the quilt up to his chin, exposing his feet to the cold in the process.
The most eye-catching is the wolf's head at the center of his chest; half of it is its snarling face and the other half is its skull. An image of a night sky filled with clouds surrounds the wolf and spreads across Dean's pectoral muscles, almost reaching his collarbone. It's all done in shades of white, gray, and black except the wolf's eye, which is a bright, icy blue.
Crowley rolls his eyes. "No, you daft heap of flannel. Dean and I were never romantic partners, we were companions. A team. I suppose you could say…friends. And now I'm going to lose him. We're going to lose him."
"We knew this would happen," Dean says, snatching the knife from the floor and rising. "Once a demon, always a demon."
Cas looks down in surprise. He'd never seen a demon move so fast yet so elegantly. It was like brutal grace.
Sam hesitates. "Sometimes. There’s only been one that sounded convincing, so I called Bobby about it. He found a hunter from Oregon to take care of it. To be honest, I do my best
"Because of Dad, Dean, because of the job. Not you. You were the one thing I could count on, even when I was an ungrateful shit. You still are."
"No, it did," the angel says, his arm falling back to his side. "Or nearly." He frowns and cocks his head slightly. "I've never been unconscious before, much less for an entire day. I had no idea what had happened until someone found that—" he nods to the necklace, "—in my leg. Impressive, I'll give you that. But no, it didn't kill me."
When they appear back at the motel, Dean turns away from Cas immediately and heads for the bathroom. Cas noticed he looks paler than usual.
"I know," Dean says. "But I'm not so sure this is possible anymore, Angel. I mean, being human is so…so emotional, isn't it? How am I ever gonna get there if this happens every time I feel freakin' butterflies in my chest? Not to mention the whole puking up blood thing and the wanting to kill people—"
He’s feeling short of breath again and it’s making it harder to keep his thoughts straight. He picks the oxygen tubing up and fumbles to get it back in place, hands shaking. Cas reaches over and helps him tuck it behind his ears.
Cas sighs. He can't read Dean's expression, but he senses that he should give him a break. "I can heal that wound, you know."
"Sam," Dean says, taking his brother's shoulders. "Look at me. Somewhere in the back of your head, I must look familiar to you. And stop telling yourself you're insane. You're not."
Crowley shrugs. "Your choice. I suspect you couldn't deny the reality of all this if you went. If you still think you're insane in a few days…your bad."
“I was about to ask you the same thing. Usually when I find people sleeping in their cars on the side of the road, there’s a problem.”
available. I've kept myself busy over the past sixteen years, but I would be willing to—you know—resume my old position."
"Maybe it didn't work all the way," Cas says thoughtfully. "Maybe that's why you're still able to feel human—he didn't curse you to the spell's full extent."
Dean's black eyes settle on themselves in the mirror. Just for a moment, he remembers the color green. Hazel-green. It's a faint memory, but he knows that was the color his eyes used to be before he became a demon.
Dean nods and opens the file. He sees a few words, something about liquefied brains, then closes it again and looks over at her. “You still sure this is what you want to do?”
Then Dean shoves him away violently, knocking him back to the floor. "It's too late, Angel," he snarls. Anger. He'd been shaking from rage.
After that, they move on to a new target and a new city. Crowley returns to hell, as he was supposed to before, and Dean decides not to ask any questions about why he'd been a little off. Crowley doesn't always tell him everything and it's never meant much yet.
Alastair has taken a new meatsuit, though one still typical to his choices; a middle-aged man with hard features and dark gray hair. He wears a business suit that Crowley notes must have been expensive, so whoever the human was, he was probably quite successful.
"Like I said, long story. But I am a demon after all, and the King of Hell at that. I have resources."
Dean's jaw tightens and his insides flip. He was hoping Cas wouldn't remember about that. "I—no—I mean, why?"
Dean tosses a tourniquet in his lap. “No. You didn’t. Put that on your leg, and get it tight.” He kneels beside the younger man and checks his pulse. It’s present, but fast and weak. “Shit,” he says under his breath, pressing a bandage to the wound. He doesn’t have the time or resources to help him—he can only hope the ambulance gets here in time.
It’s not often Cas decides against going into the Espresso Hive in the morning—he needs to get another batch of coffee roasting—but it’s pleasant and cool out and it’s almost too late in the year to plant peas and snapdragons.
The second unit has arrived, and Jack watches helpless as they go inside to search for Dean. Now that he’s outside, he can see the damage: the back half of the roof collapsed, and the flames have roared up higher now than when he first got here. Garth is inside with the search team while Rufus and a firefighter from the second truck aim hoses in the windows, trying to keep the fire at bay, keep it from spreading.
The angel narrows his eyes slightly and shakes his head. "I'll never understand your kind." He sneers. "Fortunately I'll never have to."
He leaves the dazed man behind to place another tourniquet on the woman as she begins to stir. Then he tosses his pistol and the holy water fire extinguisher back into his bag and jogs outside.
Still, the first time a large vehicle passes him on the undivided road, he starts to feel nervous. A moment later, he gets a brief, though overwhelming flashback and he yanks the Impala to the side of the road, stopping halfway in a ditch.
Castiel enters the bar, casting a subtle glance around to check the other visitors here. One woman sitting by herself, a pair of men who look very intoxicated and are in the process of kissing very passionately. That was it.
Cas cocks his head and takes a moment to really look at the images and patterns now that he feels like he has permission. "How are they done?"
It takes longer than he expected, but the water is making a difference. The flames are persistent, but they’re dying. As the light from the fire dims and the room fills with steam and smoke, he can only see Dean by the reflective material on his turnouts.
Cas doesn’t like pulling dandelions, because it seems so arbitrary that he should prefer some other plant to a perfectly hardy, sunny-yellow flower like a dandelion, but it’s necessary. As a compromise, he keeps a corner of the yard dedicated to the so-called weeds and clips the seeding heads as they come to keep them from taking over the whole garden.
They sit in silence for a few moments. Silence is comfortable with Cas. It hasn't always been, but by now the two know how to coexist, and coexisting feels nice.
Dean's eyes snap open. "I got angry." He looks around the room indifferently, though his jaw is slightly tightened. "This is what emotions are to me, Cas."
He hears the clink of a martini glass on the bar and he opens his eyes as the bartender leaves the drink in front of him.
Riot turns and bolts for the back door, whimpering and scratching at the screen. Sam stands up, now confused and slightly anxious, and follows him. He opens the door and Riot limps inside, his tail tucked between his legs. Sam goes inside and shuts the door, still hearing the growling from the lawn. He looks out, but sees nothing. Is this some kind of stupid prank? Who would prank him?
“And their hearts were delicious,” it says in a distorted version of the man’s voice it had in human form. “Drenched in cholesterol and alcohol.”
Dean flares his nostrils and exhales smoke through his nose, then puts the cigarette out in his palm, which heals instantly from the burn.
He stops at the crossroads he expects everything to happen—it's a guess, but an educated one—and looks down the road running north to south. He sees a light flick on several hundred feet away.
Jordan smirks. “Technically, I called Bobby Singer. Nah, man, I’m just checkin’. Hunter to hunter, you know? Those demons banged us both up pretty good.”
"Hi," he says rather flatly. He's wearing his leather jacket and holds his motorcycle helmet under his arm.
"I've changed your entire existence," he says, looking down at the dark hair matted in blood on the boy's forehead. "Corrupted it, most would say. You could've just died and gone to heaven. One more life ended early." He brushes the hair off Dean's forehead, easing it away from the drying blood. "But I need someone like you. I've always been alone, you know, and I've been fine with that. It does get lonely, though, this whole king of hell thing. Everyone fears me, and that's exactly where I want them. But I need a single person—a single demon—who doesn't fear me. That's who you are, Dean. You'll be the one I can trust. You'll be the one whom I understand fully, because I will know everything you are. I'll have made everything you are." He shifts positions and looks around at the tiny snowflakes floating like dust from the sky. "This is a risk for me to do this. I could lose a lot of respect bringing someone as pure and human as you back with me to hell. But they'll learn, and you'll learn. You'll be a killer. Your existence will depend on murder, but by the time it matters, you won't care. You'll live for it." He sighs. "I would be sorry, but…I'm not. I'm giving you a second chance. Wake up, Dean Winchester. Open your eyes."
Sam shakes his head. “You’re lucky the only addiction you carried out of adolescence was to nicotine.”
“Oh. Right. That makes sense.” Why was his first thought that Cas might be here just to see him? “It sounds like Jack’s doing okay?”
He pulls out his cell phone, which thankfully has some service even in this abandoned building, and calls Bobby. It takes him a moment to answer, and he sounds like he just woke up.
It takes him a long time to recover from this round. Even when he can finally stand, he feels weak, like he could pass out at any moment. It's so much more than the alcohol.
“To me, as a pilot, ‘Winchester’ meant ‘out of ammunition.’ Which is how I felt when I first met you. And often still how I feel when I’m around you. Dean Winchester.” He glances at Dean, then says, “I hope you have a short recovery. I’m sure we’ll see each other again soon.”
"I'm sorry, Cas," he says again. He turns to him and a few stray tears streak down his face. "I don't—I don't know how…." He gaze slips from Cas and he looks to the floor.
The newcomer, a man in his early fifties with dark hair and a salt-and-pepper beard, tucks his hands into the pockets of his long black dress coat. He coughs as Dean's cigarette smoke drifts into his face, and he waves it away. "That's disgusting, do you have to?"
Cas tilts his head to one side. “You know, if this were the military, you would get a purple heart for what happened today. Maybe you made a mistake, maybe your superior did, or maybe you had no way to guess what was going to happen. You still sacrificed your health to protect the property and livelihood of others. Just something to consider.”
Demons step out from all around them—across the street, inside buildings, out of parked cars—six or seven of them. Cas gets a tightness in his gut when he recognizes four of them as "Crowley's" demons from before. His blade slips into his hand.
“Well, he doesn’t have to come in if you don’t want him to. But we drove together. I took a Norco for my ankle earlier, so I can’t drive. He dropped me off while he went to park the car.”
Dean falls quiet. He decides he’s done with the nasal cannula and yanks the tubing off his face and out from behind his ears.
When he thinks he's collected enough, he returns to the boy on the road and carefully pours the blood around him, making symbols he has to recall from memory and can only hope are correct. He kneels next to the dying child and draws the knife again. Then, without hesitation, he takes the boy's right arm and digs a deep cut into the soft skin, a symbol like the number seven with two fangs. Then he slices the blade into his own skin, across his palm, and puts his hand over the symbol he just made.
He sits at one end of the bar. He doesn’t drink often enough anymore to have a go-to, so he orders something off the house menu—their take on a cosmopolitan. He drinks it a little too fast as he tries not to slide backward into his own mind.
Jack shakes his head. “How do you cope with all that during a call like this… and still find room inside yourself to comfort someone else?”
He chucks the other boot into the corner with the first and exhales, letting himself fall back onto the motel bed. He smells of smoke, sweat, dirt, and lighter fluid, but he’s too tired and too sore to change clothes and shower. He strips down to his t-shirt and boxers and crawls under the sheets.
"Right," Crowley says, and he finishes his drink. He stands. "What's your name?" he asks, though of course, he already knows.
"Everything. Dean's a demon, like me, but not exactly like me. I'm a demon because I died as a human, was sent to hell, and had my soul warped and corrupted until I became a demon." He glances at Sam's horrified expression and adds, "That's normal. Dean, on the other hand, rather had…demonness…forced upon him. He's more volatile, more susceptible to emotions. He started acting different right after we visited your bar, and once you spoke about him as though you knew him—despite my efforts to ensure you two didn't have a meaningful conversation—I became certain you were the reason he'd changed."
As if prepared for the question, Crowley lifts a vial of a dark purple, viscous liquid between his thumb and index finger. "This worked last time, yes? The trench coat angel got away, but you said you stabbed him with your pendant before then. Since we haven't seen him again, I'd like to assume he's dead, or at least learned not to mess with us. Put this on your knife and you should be fine."
Dean’s phone rings as he’s driving west out of Amarillo, Texas, headed toward a collection of demon signs in New Mexico. He almost doesn’t hear the ringtone over the Def Leppard song he’s playing loudly in the car. When he checks the caller ID, he’s surprised to see it’s his brother.
He pauses briefly to consider this conversation he’s having with his car, then shakes his head and starts the engine.
Sam looks into the room. There's a table with straps, some suspicious spiky protrusions from the ceiling above it, and a cart full of tools, the uses of which he can barely fathom.
"Dean!" he hears Cas call from a few yards down the street. He jogs up to them, slowing for a second to look at the damage to Dean's motorcycle. Then he comes up to them and kneels beside Dean. "Are you alright? What happened? Why are you not healing?"
"The way he tells it, you made him into some kind of monster. You made my brother murder people, Crowley."
“Cas?” Max calls from behind the counter. “I saved the cinnamon rolls, but the oven’s being weird again.”
Dean's smile becomes more amused. Crowley always finds it delightful to watch people squirm under some of Dean's expressions, and this particular one he dubbed the 'wolf smile.'
"I'm fine. Really, I am. You're right, I've got a lot to think about, but….I mean, the other day I met my brother, who I haven't seen since I was eleven. That's one of the best things I could ask for. Plus I've got a sweet car, and an angel who, for some reason, seems to like hanging around me. I've been worse."
“A town about forty-five minutes from here has been having some weird deaths, bodies drained of blood. Sounds maybe more like a djinn than a vampire, but either way, maybe our—your kind of thing.”
It lasts only a couple seconds before Cas pulls away. Dean's eyes open more slowly and Cas can see none of the buried violence he usually finds in the demon's expression. And unless Cas is imagining it, he can see tiny hints of green in Dean's irises.
“No offense, you just don’t strike me as a military type. What branch? If you say Navy, I take back everything I said about mysterious.”
"You owe me nothing, Dean," Cas says, tipping Dean's chin up so he looks at him. "I chose this. With or without heaven, I could've done anything, but I wanted to do this."
"Sure." Dean revs the engine and swings the motorcycle in a tight arc to face the way he must have come. Then he turns his head slightly back to look toward Cas. "Anything else to say, Angel?"
Dean turns and takes Cas's hand in his. He uses his other hand to run his fingers down the front of Cas's chest, looking at this instead of Cas's face. "Let's be done talking about this. We need something else for a little while. You shouldn't have to clean up my whole mess anyway. I've been…ridiculously self-centered lately—I mean, always—and I'm…I'm sorry for that. You're so damn patient and I have no idea how I'm going to make this up to you."
"I don't think they're looking for me," Cas says quickly. "It wasn't that bad. Anyway, I get the feeling you know how to blend in as a human. More than I do."
Without hesitation, Crowley slashes a cut into Cas's upper arm. Cas grunts in pain and the wound glows blue.
Sam loves Stanford’s libraries and cafés, but being in the same place to study day and in and day out is driving him crazy. He packs up his backpack and rides his bike out to the nearest public library instead. The change of scenery, maybe, will help get his mind off hunting.
The king of hell is angry. Three demons felt the force of his frustration back in hell and now no longer exist. But now that he's back topside and sitting at a bar, his primary emotion—if one could say he has them—is confusion.
“You should have saved her,” she says, whirling on Jack, who’s nearest her. “Why couldn’t you save her? She was healthy, she was fine this morning—what is all this shit for if you can’t keep her alive?” She gestures widely to their equipment spread across the yard.
Sam stops pacing and gives Dean a hard but hurting look. His gaze flicks down Dean's face, lower than his eyes. "You're bleeding—your nose—"
Cas's concerned frown gives Dean a mix of feelings; some combination of annoyance and appreciation. "I thought you didn't remember much of it."
"I know it's not a typical date, exactly, but you know I have a hard time with human things like restaurants or—"
Dean jerks awake and grabs onto whoever's holding his shoulder, yanking them down and pulling out the knife from under his pillow.
Dean gasps for breath and curls into a fetal position around his pain. His chest feels as though it's collapsing and the side of his leg burns where it must have gotten caught on the motorcycle. His mouth is filling with blood from the inside of his cheek. The warm, suffocating liquid chokes him as he tries to regain his breath.
Dean gives a slow nod, then strides over to a closet labeled EMS SUPPLY and leans inside long enough to tear a page off the wall and bring it back. He hands it to Jack. The list is extensive, organized by each compartment of the ambulance, and includes the quantity of each item that should be stocked.
Sam gives a solid but gentle handshake. "Funny you should ask on your fifth trip here," he says in good nature.
Dean has to remind himself that Cas doesn't have a reason to understand what this means to him. He shakes his head. "Well, I don't think so, but given that I've never done it before—I don't know. Okay." He takes a breath and shifts the car to drive. It's not the actual act of driving he's concerned about—he's pretty sure he can figure that part out.
Dean teases his boot laces out of their double-knot and tugs on the tongue of the shoe enough to slip it off and toss it in the corner. He does the same on the other side, noticing idly that the leather is horribly stained and creased, the sole coming apart from the heel. These boots have been dragged back and forth across the country, seen a lifetime’s worth abandoned floors and graveyard dirt. He’s had them about three years now.
Cas smiles briefly. “Army. I was an Apache helicopter pilot for two tours of Iraq. It was a long time ago.”
"Right. Of course not. But…but why didn't you tell me where this was going, Dean? Even the first day, or the hours we talked on the phone after that. Don't you think that would've been nice to mention?"
"But I think we've just had a misunderstanding. Yes, I'm the King of Hell, but more than anything I'm a business man. I just keep things running in an organized manner down there."
“I wish I could believe that. I do. But… I say his psychic stuff doesn’t scare me, because I can’t stand to tell him anything else. But I’ve seen him when he gets angry. He’s too much like Dad, of course he scares me.”
It's a hard adjustment for Cas to stay grounded and in a hotel room. He's used to being busy, in heaven, and it isn't long before he's restless.
“You got a place you’re staying in town?” Dean asks, tossing the duffel bag in the backseat and starting the engine.
"Don't you get it? First of all, that is me. Second, I'm not giving up on that. You think I could possibly live with letting myself go back to being a demon after all this? No. But from here on, I have to go it alone."
"No, Dean, you can't. I just found out you were still alive. What, I'm going to only get to know my brother for a few months? How is that…" His voice fades. "Fair?" he finishes weakly.
Crowley crosses his arms and leans back against the counter. "You're asking for justification. Humans love to justify things. If you do something, particularly something 'bad,' you like to have a reason. An excuse." He scoffs softly. "That's not how things work for us. I never told you because you didn't need to know, and I never told Dean because he couldn't be motivated to leave hell. That's it."
Dean shakes his head and looks down to pull a cigarette from the box and place it between his lips. “Whatever, man. I’m fine.”
"Why are we here?" Sam asks. He's sweating, and he's not sure if it's from the heat or the fact that he's suddenly nervous.
Sam has exactly one day off every week. He's been told time and time again to make the most of it; go out to eat or drink, hang out with friends, go to this event or that. He rarely does anything of the sort. Instead, he's sitting on the lawn of the tiny backyard behind his apartment. He has no chair, so he sits on the grass with an iced latte sitting beside him. Riot is stretched out on his side next to him, a bandage laced around his shoulder. Sam has a hand on the dog's side and uses the other to hold the book he's about halfway through.
He shakes his head and looks down. "I wanted to think Crowley was wrong. I wanted someone to stay optimistic."
"Okay. We've got all the obvious pieces: engine, coolant, radiator, battery, oil reservoir and dipstick….Um. This is brake fluid. These are the spark plugs. The carburetor is under there, kind of. This one? Is AC, right?"
The church doors fly open. Sam looks up, Dean turns. Lilith stands at the top of the stairs, her fury ill-disguised.
" Dean roars, looking up with a snarl before he has to lean over again to vomit up blood. "I could rip your throat out," he growls more quietly, but his demeanor is less threatening; he sets his forehead down on the faucet and stares at the bottom of the sink.
It doesn't really matter. As long as he doesn't talk too much to Sam, all is well in Crowley's book.
Cas shakes his head. “You’ve done plenty of working lately. You should have a real day off. Max is off today, maybe you two should see a movie or something when she gets out of school.”
They spend the better part of the afternoon sitting outside and talking. A few times, Cas sees through Dean’s carefully crafted exterior and is introduced to the man underneath—someone who loves cooking, whose whole face lights up when he smiles or laughs, who raised his brother practically as his own and who cares deeply about his community. There aren’t a lot of things Dean says outright about himself as much as he implies them in other ways, usually through anecdotes he purportedly tells for a different reason.
"Dean," the king of hell says as he strides up to them. He sounds annoyed, not surprised. "Didn't you already kill someone today?"
“We’re cheap, okay? And we have absolutely no taste in finer things.” He raises the mug. “How much for this?”
“This was never about them, Cas. It was about you. I wanted your help.” Cas’s gaze falls to the floor, and Dean steps closer to recapture it. “Somethin’ changed after you gave me Lilith’s location, didn’t it? Something about you.”
"I admit I wasn't certain I was incapable of feeling powerful emotions, but to be fair, I had never felt them before. Not…not like this." Cas finally moves his hand from Dean's heart, wrapping it around his back and pressing the two of them together.
"Maybe it's been coming for a while. I'm just spitballing here, I don't know your situation, but…maybe something just tipped him over the edge finally. I mean, he seemed like a free spirit."
“Of course. I haven’t had any of it, I swear. No headaches, no predicting the future, no… telekinesis or whatever.”
But finally, Sam hears something. It's a growl, but he can tell it isn't Riot's; it's far more powerful and much deeper.
“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Dean says, his voice hoarse from coughing. “That was my bad. I almost got you killed.”
"Hi, is this Cas?" the young woman asks. Dean finally gets a chance to actually look at her and he realizes she's beautiful. Long, curly blonde hair, warm brown eyes, and a slender build. She has a narrow face, but soft features.
"Start with money. I usually run credit card scams. You can do whatever, just don't get caught doing anything that'll make the news. It's about that easy."
Dean pulls both arms away from Cas and turns away, and suddenly their intimacy is gone. "You keep saying things like that, as if I've actually done any good."
Sam’s conflicted—Dean can see it on his face. He’s thinking about changing his mind, he may not be unreachable…
The things he learns to value perhaps above all are the dinners. For the first several shifts, he brought his own meals, until one day Dean looked at Jack’s food, then at Jack, and said, “Dinner is part of the culture here, kid. Either you’re in or you’re out.”
was the cause of Dean's change of attitude? It doesn't seem logical, but what other explanation is there? Crowley knows well enough how the Mark of Cain works. It wouldn't let Dean give up killing of his own accord.
“That,” Dean says with a smile, “is exactly why I’m here. I work in… public service, let’s say, so I come here when I want to avoid seeing anyone I know.”
Slowly setting down the book, Sam looks around. The lawns of the apartments are empty as far as he can see and there's nothing across the road. He tries to follow where Riot's gaze—hearing, more like—is fixated on, but he can't find anything.
"Well technically," Dean smirks, spreading his arms, "I'm already dead. It may be no life, but it's one hell of a way to spend your death."
Cas looks up and goes quiet for a moment, his frown evaporating. “You’re right. It’s been a long time since I saw the stars from Earth.”
It doesn't make sense. Dean had done—something, something powerful—to heal him, only to stab him again. But that's how the Mark works, isn't it? Everything comes in waves.
Cas can feel Dean smile. Dean puts his hand over Cas's and pulls it down to his neck, uncovering his mouth. "You damn liar, Angel."
He sees himself standing before a dark brick building, hand outstretched toward a woman on the steps of the building above him. She’s thin and blonde and she looks furious, and as the Sam of the dream makes a fist, she begins to exude black smoke—demon smoke—from her face.
“Okay,” Dean says, looking back up. “That was smooth, I’ll give you that. So, what do you actually do for a living?”
The figure emerges, and Dean half-pulls the trigger before releasing it quickly and turning the gun away.
Station life is unlike anything he’s ever been a part of. It’s raucous and vulgar yet heartwarming and loving all in the same. Jack looks forward to the banter, the movie nights, the wild tales the more experienced firefighters tell. He geeks out with Garth over old comics, gets an enlightening lecture about whiskey from Rufus, and laughs at the look on Dean’s face when it’s 2 AM and they get a call for something that isn’t really an emergency.
He heads to his room to take a shower before he goes to sleep. His routine is normal, but his emotions are a little skewed.
He debates calling Bobby, but it’s past midnight in Sioux Falls and he figures he might as well let the man sleep. This creature, whatever it actually is, doesn’t seem to be killing people, so there’s no real rush.
"So about Sam." He removes the cigarette from his lips. "Obviously there's a reason I told you to come here. Let's find him. We can start with the bar."
“Look, I know you were raised in the life, and that ain’t easy. I can’t understand it, not fully. But you’re more than just a hunter, Dean, and there’s more to your family than hunting. The thing that killed your mom is dead. You can take a break once in a while.”
Its demonic face flickers underneath the human one, then it goes limp. Dean sighs and looks at the name tag the demon’s waiter vessel had been wearing.
“I’ve been busy. I still have to go in this afternoon to start roasting, or they’re going to run out next week.”
The man sitting up doesn’t look like he knows how to put the tourniquet on, so Dean does it for him, twisting the handle until the flow of blood out of the wound slows, then strapping it in place.
Dean shrugs and shuts the trunk of his car. "Sure. It doesn't matter to me, I just want to spend some time with you. That's what this is all about, right?"
Max hands a waiting customer their latte, and Cas briefly touches her shoulder. “Can you keep an eye on the oven for me? There’s a batch of cinnamon rolls that should be done soon.” She nods, and Cas glances at Jack before picking up a mug and pumping white chocolate and caramel syrup into it. “You look like you didn’t sleep.”
"We'll make it through this, Dean. I'm an angel, I can fix you—I'll find a way. You'll have time to make this up to yourself." He steps forward and hesitantly traces the demon wings on Dean's back with his finger. "You're not a bad person. I've already said that, but I mean it."
“There aren’t words in English for it. Or Hebrew, or any human language. Perhaps the Greeks came the closest with
Amidst the chaos, Dean walks into the Hive. Cas is both relieved that Dean’s here so he might get a break and exasperated that everything went to shit just before he arrived.
"No," he says, cutting Cas off. "You need help. But it isn't something I can provide." He turns away and takes a few steps toward the door. "They'll be looking for you if you stay here," he adds over his shoulder. "It's up to you whether or not you want to get caught."
She narrows her eyes at him. "I mean, I didn't know you could be healed that fast." She looks to Cas. "I've never encountered angels before."
Cas stiffens and lowers his head slightly, but still makes eye contact with Balthazar. "It's not like I'm dating him. You know nothing about him, anyway."
Cas's stomach sinks and it takes him a long time before he pulls it out. He looks at the screen, which displays a number—Dean hadn't yet shown him how to make contacts—but he knows who it is. He shoves the phone away again.
He slips his bike lock key into his pocket and offers a handshake. “I’m Sam. Sorry we got off on the wrong foot there. I didn’t mean to creep you out.”
Dean is across the apparatus bay, talking to Garth. He gives Jack a nod of acknowledgement, then exchanges an amused expression with Garth before walking over.
"Ow, Jesus." He can hear Dean's muffled voice through his helmet as they stop at a sign. "You don't have to grope me. Put your arms around my waist, not my chest."
"Well, we're here. So come on," Cas says, grabbing Dean's arm and pulling him toward the walkway to the apartment door.
He shuts up immediately when Cas steps up to him, takes Dean's face in his hands, and presses their lips together.
As she turns to go, Dean leans against the side of the ambulance and calls, “Yeah, get out of here, Deputy Mills. We don’t like cops in our fire station.”
He can't stay in heaven. That's what it means. But he has no idea where to go or what to do if he doesn't stay here. He doesn't know how to live in the human world, but what other option does he have?
“But now…” Sam shakes his head. “Those two years—looking for Dad, hunting the demon—I mean, they sucked, but I realized there were things I liked about the job, too. Things I missed. It’s been harder to ignore possible cases, it’s harder to talk to people who don’t understand the life. I had to come up with all these lies about what I’d been doing just to be re-admitted to the program. And… being back there, I missed Jess. More than I thought I would.”
“Okay, okay,” it says in a rush, struggling against the ropes tying it to the chair. Dean pulls the stake out of its leg. “There’s one demon, he runs all the crossroads deals now that Lilith is moving up the food chain. He’s worked with Lilith before, but since she got serious about the sixty-six seals, they—I guess they had a falling out. He probably knows her plans, whether your brother is involved or not, and he might be willing to talk.”
“How many demons are at the convent? You think we have any chance of taking them and Lilith out before Sam can?”
black demon smoke erupts from the three vessels and disappears into the ground. The humans collapse, momentarily unconscious.
Cas tries not to look amused and, in a moment, they're at the location of Sam Winchester's apartment.
“I know… I haven’t done this in a while. But I’m just… not really sure what to do, or really what I’m feeling here, so.” He sighs. Praying doesn’t come as easily as it used to. “I don’t want to sound ungrateful about what I have right now—I’ve been here for nine months and I haven’t had anyone look for me. No FBI, no demons, nothing. I just want to know if I’m doing the right thing. Am I a coward for leaving, or am I protecting people better this way? I haven’t felt anything psychic since the Devil’s Gate, but I’m still… I’m still scared of… what I could do.” He looks up to the ceiling, its texture barely visible as his eyes adjust to the dark. “If You could give me some guidance, a sign, anything—I could use Your help right now. And hey, just… keep my brother safe, maybe?” He sits back on his heels and unclasps his hands, then adds “amen” as an afterthought.
“If I’m being a dick, just call me out on it. That’s what Krissy Chambers used to do—she was on this shift before you, and I trained her, too. She would not take my shit, believe me. I couldn’t count how many times I heard her say, ‘Winchester, you’re being a fucking dick again, snap out of it.’ One time she straight-up walked away from me when I was talking.”
Now Crowley has his proof. He hadn't bothered to visit the cell until now, but after one of the demons told him there'd been a message left for him, he thought it was worth his time.
“Now, normally,” Jody says to Jack, “Garth and the gal you’re replacing run on the ambulance, but she was an advanced EMT and you’re not, which makes Dean the senior medical provider until Garth gets his certification finished. So, Dean, Jack, you two will be on the ambulance and Garth will take firefighter duty.”
“Sam, you gotta listen to me,” he starts on his voicemail. “I know you’re pissed or whatever, but just listen. You can’t go after Lilith, and I know for sure this time. She’s the final seal. If you kill her, you’ll release Lucifer. I know you think you’re doin’ the right thing, but they’re lying to you. Heaven, or whoever, they’re lying. Just—call me. We can talk about it, I swear, but we’re almost out of time.”
"I've been restless," Dean sighs. "I've been trying to hide it, ignore it, whatever. But I'm used to being busy. Hunting down people and…killing them—but anyway, I usually have stuff to do. I think sitting around is making my urge to kill something worse."
Crowley steps forward and puts a hand on Sam's shoulder, and instantly they're somewhere else. Whatever happened makes him dizzy and he puts a hand to the side of his head with a wince.
"Because I'm done killing for you, Crowley," Dean says evenly. He leans against a pillar and pulls a cigarette out of the pack in his pocket.
Sam glances down at his hands, both of which are bloody, then chooses his left because it isn't injured. He winces as he stands, sucking air through his teeth.
The glasses slide in front of his eyes and Sam jumps again. This time, he gives a strangled yell and presses himself back against the bed frame, pulling his knees toward his chest to get as far away from what he sees as possible.
“I’m a businessman,” the demon says, pouring whiskey into a glass. “And at its best, Armageddon is bad for business. At its worst, it’s the end of every demon that exists. Lucifer may have created demons, but only to spite God. He’ll still want to kill us all once we stop being useful to him. So, you ask why I’m helping? Survival.”
“Anyone else, are you kiddin’ me? There’s no one better. Who else is not only capable of taking out multiple demons on his own, but willing to drop everything to pull your ass out of the fire?”
The sword drops to the mud, its light extinguished. Cas steps back, pulling his hand away from Dean, his expression morphing from bewildered to horrified. His image ripples, his wings flickering into existence, then away.
Dean swings his feet off the table and stands up, grabbing his mug and finishing whatever was left in it before he goes over to the sink. Cas wonders if he was making him uncomfortable by looking at him for so long. He doubts it, but maybe Dean does have insecurities, for as much as he acts otherwise.
“It’s not.” Dean grabs Sam’s shirt with his uninjured hand. “If you want to do something for me, then leave with me. Get out of here together, find some other way. You and me.”
"No," Cas says flatly. "Neither of them." He unbuttons his shirt and pulls it halfway off so he can get at the wound just below his shoulder.
Sometimes, the loneliness is like drowning. Sam, Dad, Bobby, Ellen, Jo—people he’s hunted with, people he’s loved. All came and went. One way or another, he always ends up alone, and he knows it’s better that way, if he could just remember to keep it that way….
Dean can't hide his shock as he turns to see a familiar man in a trench coat approaching him. He lowers his cigarette. "Winchester? I—I haven't been called that in years. Not since…since I was a kid," he says slowly with a small frown. He's momentarily forgotten to be threatening.
"Of course I'm going to hell. I think I've already mentioned this—no soul is as high on the naughty list as mine. When I die, I have a one-way ticket downstairs. You can't be surprised."
"I am Castiel. As I said, I'm an angel. There are resources in heaven that allowed me to learn of your past. A small section of it, anyway."
“On me,” Cas says. “You fixed my oven. And I was going to cover it anyway, because you bought my drinks.”
Dean tosses her an annoyed look. “I’m just sayin’. By the time you realize what you left behind, it might be too late to get it back. Nobody gets out of this job once they really start it, you know that.”
Dean sighs and gets out of the car. He grabs his first-aid kit and helps Sam into the inn, avoiding the startled gaze of the receptionist as they go by the desk.
And then, of course, there's Amelia. He never really knew her very well—they kissed twice, but does that really mean anything?—but he misses her all the same. She needed to move back with her husband, he gets that. But he wishes they could've had more of a chance together.
"I know." Dean's fist clenches around the beer bottle until his knuckles are white. "For some goddamn reason, I chose this way out."
“Hi, Jody. I was here a while ago, I just… didn’t know if I should come in. I didn’t want to wake anyone up.”
Dean fixes him with a hard gaze for several seconds. Cas holds it evenly, though with a hint of plea. Finally, Dean blinks slowly as he looks away, his expression admitting that Cas might be right and he believes him. Still, he says nothing, instead digging a cigarette out of his pocket and lighting it.
“You don’t. It will heal in a few hours.” He gets to his feet, and Dean swears he pales with the effort. “I’ll still be able to fly.” He flicks the largest pair of wings, the air movement ruffling Dean’s hair.
"Because. You're a freakin' angel and I'm a demon with anger management issues and—we already decided neither of us can feel emotions, not real ones, so why the hell are we doing this?"
They're kissing again and Cas can feel Dean start to unbutton Cas's shirt. He runs his hands down Cas's sides and leaves his left at Cas's waist while he slips the other under the waistband of his pants to rest against his hip.
"Ah yes, Sam. I knew you couldn't resist giving me a ring, could you?" Crowley answers in a flirtatious tone.
He’s referring, of course, to the Florian cross tattooed on the left side of Dean’s chest, part of a larger design that blends into the sleeve on his arm. Dean remembers Cas’s own tattoo of a gray angel wing wrapping over his shoulder and halfway down his arm.
As Dean falls asleep that night, some time between one and two in the morning, he repeats to himself,
He braces his brother’s scapula with one hand and takes his elbow with the other. “Deep breath, on three, okay?”
"And I forgive you. You gave me a second shot at…existing. Otherwise, I wouldn't have ever seen Sam again or met Cas. You may have given me the Mark, but you…you took care of me, too. For better or worse, you're family."
Life goes on as normal—or rather, the new normal that Jack has become accustomed to. He and Dean don’t speak again about the conversation they had after that call, or Jack’s breakdown in the ambulance bay. But he’s starting to see the weight Dean carries in the little ways it presents itself, whether through the things he says, or the flashes of expressions on his face, or the way he absentmindedly runs a finger along the scar on his temple. Jack has sensed he shouldn’t ask about it, but he has a feeling that, like the tattoo, he may find out its story in time.
Life had been rough and chaotic after his parents died. He'd been too young to fully understand anything or do anything other than what the adults around him decided. It hadn't been too long before he'd gotten stuck in foster care, which is where he would be until he died. But he'd stayed with a half dozen families within those seven years; even as Sam got older, Dean would've been hard to find, and who was there to look?
"My king," Alastair says dramatically, bowing even though he's being held on either side. "Long time no see."
Dean scans as much of the convent grounds as he can see out the windshield. “I don’t see a one. I’m guessin’ they’re all inside, waiting. If there are any. It’s hard to tell what’s a demonic omen and what’s regular apocalypse shit at this point, but it’s not like they’re trying to stop him. Did you get any other hunters on board? I could barely get anyone to pick up.”
Crowley slowly lets go of the boy's arm. He wipes the mixed blood on his palm across his pants and sits down hard, suddenly drained. He senses the boy's soul leave him. But it doesn't go to heaven, where it had been reaching before.
"Hey, Cas," he starts, going over to where the angel sits on the bed. He takes Cas's hand and pulls him to his feet, then laces their fingers together. "I don't even know how to begin to thank you."
Dean shrugs. As a demon, he doesn't technically have to sleep, but sometimes once he does he can sleep for about twelve hours. "What can I say? Gotta catch up sometime."
"I believe you," Cas says slowly. He lowers his blade as the car drives away. "But I don't believe that's the only way you feel."
Vision obscured by blood and dark spots, Dean gets to his hands and knees. “Sammy,” he says, “we gotta get Jo up and leave. Before the hellhounds get here.”
He shakes his head and digs around in his bag for a pack of cigarettes, which he finds in the pocket of his torn-up leather jacket. "A demon who happens to hate me a lot is looking for me. He's trying to win back his position as Crowley's second-in-command." He pulls out a cigarette and his lighter and looks up to see Cas's frown. "Alastair was the me before me. Crowley never liked him as much, which is why he kicked him out of his position as soon as he felt I was ready. Alastair hated me before, but he really loathed me after that. He tried to kill me within a year of my promotion, which is when Crowley told him to get out of sight. Apparently he wants his old position back."
"Stop holding me back, Angel," Dean snarls, yanking away, and in his deadly, now drunk anger, he looks just like he did when they first met—full demon.
"Well, I'm not your fairy godmother," the demon says, bored. Dean decides he needs to figure out her name. "This comes at a price, you didn't know that? Ten years from today, a hellhound comes and kills you." She smiles. "But you can have a hell of a time before then."
He picked up this case thinking it was a rogue reaper, but these people aren’t dying out of turn the way they were in Nebraska. They’re dying violently, but always by human causes—murders, car crashes, workplace accidents. And yet, there are multiple reports of a humanoid figure appearing after the violent deaths, leaning over the dead bodies before disappearing into thin air. But no reaper would let itself be seen by the living, would it? And the claim some witnesses made that the cloaked figure was feeding on the bodies… it doesn’t fit.
Then someone steps out onto the crosswalk in front of him as he's traveling about thirty miles an hour and he has less than a second to react.
Dean gets out of the ambulance and walks around to the driver’s side. He opens Jack’s door and beckons him out. “Come on.”
"Cas. Need I remind you that it isn't normal for people to appear out of nowhere?" he asks in an undertone. "We're fine, but he could have seen us. It would make my lie a lot harder to sell."
“I think I’m going to dig out my old textbooks. There are some forced entry protocols I can’t quite remember, and some physiology, too.”
He rolls to his side and props himself up on his elbow. He sees a demon walk over to Jo and turn her over with its foot. It kneels and grabs her hair with one hand, the other gripping her jaw, ready to snap her neck.
The demon doesn't exactly answer. He starts leading Sam down the hall, saying, "This is where your brother grew up. What goes on in this place is beyond anything your human mind could imagine." He opens a door to the right. "This is one of many places a soul can be tortured. Only the worst come here, of course. If they need…special treatment."
He looks up at him. "I've slept a number of times as a demon—never because I was tired, since I never got tired—but I've never had a dream. I haven't had dreams since I was a kid, and I didn't remember what it was like. Damn, I never knew they could be so unpleasant."
He shakes his head and can't seem to look Cas in the eyes. His fists clench, making blood leak out from between his fingers. "I was angry, I was dying, I—I don't know, Cas. I don't know."
"I'm not 'just done.' I'm not giving up. I've thought about this for days. Nothing but me and my car and my thoughts for hours while I drove back to the hospital, and then here. It's a calculated decision, not surrender."
The pendant was infused with the poison, and it works much faster on demons than on angels. He knows the exact moment the demon—and vessel—die, and he feels a rush of strength and bloodlust.
“I would ditch you at that shitty pizza restaurant to go get high for hours and nearly forget to pick you up again.”
His phone buzzes. He pulls it out—the screen seems glaringly bright in the darkness of late evening—and sees it's Dean. Of course. Who else would know this number?
“I’m alright, I’m good.” Sam flicks the newspaper to get it to stand up in his hand. “I was just, uh. Looking at a newspaper today and I found something a little weird.”
Dean spends about fifteen minutes pacing back and forth in his motel room, which he's had to book for another few nights. He can go through the motions of this whole 'not killing' thing, but he's going to have to find motivation for it somewhere.
“I don’t? She killed Bobby and Ellen.” Sam’s anger rises, then simmers. “You know the nightmare I have more often than any other? Even more than seeing Jess on the ceiling, or you dying after the car crash, or Dad on the hospital room floor, or any of that.”
Crowley sighs and pulls a kitchen chair out behind Sam, who instantly collapses into it. He can't tell if he's feeling more effects from the wound, or from the experience.
Sam grins as they take their seats in the car. “Do you remember that time in Texas? We put a dead vampire in the trunk and forgot about it for three days.”
Dean laughs, a kind of empty sound, like he's never actually laughed out of happiness before. "You think a
The werewolf lunges, and he swings the machete. He catches it in the shoulder instead of the neck, and its full weight hits him a split-second later, knocking him to the ground. Its claws rake across his face and dig into his arm as he struggles to keep its snapping jaw away with the machete.
Toned out: dispatched to a call. "Tones" are a unique sound that plays before the dispatcher starts talking. Tones for a fire call and tones for an EMS call are typically different, so you know immediately which one you're getting dispatched to.
Dean cocks an eyebrow, chuckling dismissively. “We were just in there talking for an hour and a half, did you miss it?”
Dean is silent for a long time, and Cas is at a loss for words. The Mark isn't going to let them forget what's going to happen; that much seems clear.
“Oh, yes, the oven is having problems. I’m surprised you noticed it with all the windows open and the pastry and coffee smells. I suppose if it gets too bad, I’ll have to ask everyone to leave until we get it fixed.”
Thinking back on it, Dean never heard Jack get out of the ambulance. “Oh, Jesus,” he says, standing up. “I’m going to have to have a heart-to-heart with this kid or something.”
Then the wolf freezes, and Dean feels a wet warmth spill onto his chest. The creature collapses on top of him, and he quickly shoves it off, rolling to his hands and knees. The front of his shirt is soaked by blood and sticking to his skin, and a wave of nausea comes and goes.
Alastair catches him off guard by appearing suddenly to his right, sinking his own poisoned blade into Dean's side. Dean turns and slashes open Alastair's forearm, causing him to grunt in pain and back away, leaving his knife in Dean's side. Dean snarls and pulls the weapon out of himself, holding it in his broken but now healing hand. He doesn't even look behind him as he catches a demon in the gut with the blade before he can attack. He pulls it out and lets the body fall.
Dean nods—about what, Cas doesn't know, or maybe Dean's just convincing himself that he's actually going to do it—and lifts the blade to his chest. He sets the tip below his ribs, aimed up toward his heart. He takes a deep breath. Then another.
"They're more of representations than actual pictures…" Seeing the expression on Dean's face, he says, "So maybe spotting constellations isn't going to be your future hobby, but you have to admit the sky is beautiful."
A couple of Facebook pages show up and Dean selects the first. Sam Winchester, age 33. Lives in Kermit, Texas. Born in Lawrence, Kansas. He was last active eight hours ago.
and Dean drops to elbows to cover his ears. Even then, he hears the unearthly sound like a chorus of hundreds of Tibetan singing bowls—it’s somehow horrifyingly eerie and celestially beautiful at the same time.
"I think it is," Dean whispers as he pushes the angel blade between Cas's ribs. The angel gasps and chokes from the pain. "It's the only thing I know."
He glances to either side to make certain no one is coming down the hall, then makes himself appear on the other side of the door.
“Maybe that’s the problem. You don’t think you deserve it.” Cas has that same soft expression on his face Dean saw at the fire station and labeled pity. Now, he thinks it’s something more like understanding. “Dean, the reason I left the church five years ago is because it made me hate myself. The misinterpretation of Leviticus, to start. ‘You shall not lie with a male as with a woman.’ They told me my love was an abomination—love, the thing faith is supposed to be built on.”
There isn’t much time to process. They call the coroner’s office to retrieve the body, and a police officer comes to take a report. The woman’s daughter, who must be about Jack’s age, goes from horrified to furious.
Jack turns the emergency lights off as Dean sits down. He starts driving without saying a word, because nothing seems relevant enough to say. Even if he were to try, he has a feeling he might break down.
One by one, the angels disappear, but Cas doesn't yet follow. Hannah stays behind, seeing him hesitate.
“That makes one of us.” He leans back against the building, resting his head against it and looking up at the sky. It’s too overcast to see the stars.
He's vaguely aware of the beep before he's fully awake. He feels heavy, and his head feels stuffed with cotton.
"You gonna say somethin', Angel?" Dean asks, not turning back to Cas. He seems tense all of a sudden, like he had that night by the motorcycle.
Dean shakes his head. "You have—nothing to be sorry for." He reaches up, slightly uncoordinated, and wipes a tear from Cas's face. Cas realizes Dean's eyes are now a brilliant shade of green. Their true color. "It's okay."
Then Dean gives Cas a sly sideways look. "So. Castiel. We have some time to kill until we see what we came for."
Hours have gone by since their phone call. It's early, early in the morning now and Cas wonders how far away Dean is by this time.
“I’m workin’ on it. Believe me, the first time you get a call with a cute kiddo who’s all excited about the ambulance, I’ll be sad I’m here.”
The next day, Dean isn't there when Cas wakes up in their motel room. The night before, he'd mentioned intending to do something with Sam, so Cas didn't think much of it. It was instead a perfect opportunity for him to carry out his plan.
“Mark and Kayla Hayes were in the area yesterday,” Bobby says. “I can see if they’re still around to take it.”
Castiel appears in front of the car. Eyes wide, he looks at Lilith, then at Sam. Then his eyes meet Dean’s.
With a frown, he stands and turns around. There's a group of people, three men and one woman, at the top of the steps. It doesn't take him but a moment to see they're demons.
Cas really does look just like a human, one in a rumpled business suit and outdated coat at that, but the power contained in that form is unmistakable. It’s the warmth he recognizes from his dreams, but it’s mixed with a raw, almost terrible strength he must’ve been trying to hide. Dean begins to understand how, in so many scriptural angel encounters he’s read about, the beholder falls to their knees before them.
AEMT: advanced EMT. A step above EMT, a step below paramedic. They have broader medical skills than a basic EMT and will typically be the one in the back with the patient, while the basic EMT drives.
"You must be here for something," Sam says, leaning against his kitchen counter, across from where Crowley sat, looking distastefully at the wine in front of him—the only alcohol Sam had to offer other than beer. "You're clearly not here for the alcohol, or you would've already left."
Dean is tense but he keeps his expression still, a small smirk on his face. "Why do you think it was me?"
Come evening, Jack is holed up in his room with his textbooks, as promised. Cas tells him he’s going to have drinks with Anna, even though it’s a lie. He did text her, but she wasn’t free tonight. So, he’s going alone, which is so unlike him he couldn’t find it in himself to tell Jack. He never lies to his son unless he thinks it’s unquestionably for the best—which is rare—but ever since he saw Bartholomew at the Espresso Hive, he’s felt
“No, it’s not that. I guess Dean and I just don’t have that much in common without hunting, you know? He doesn’t understand or care about what I study in school. He doesn’t know what it’s like to live in an apartment, or study with people, or do a week’s worth of grocery shopping—I wish he’d do something else, but he won’t.”
"You snore slightly," Cas says as if this is supposed to make everything better. "It's very quiet and nice to listen to."
Jack watches in abject dread as Dean pulls his turnouts, boots, and helmet from the fire engine and moves them to a side compartment of the ambulance.
Dean looks up and takes a deep breath, regaining his composure. "Well, I figure I've got some healing back, since, you know. But according to Crowley, your angel blade should still work."
He nods. "I mean, I don't really know. I was four. But goddamn if it doesn't look exactly right." He makes a circle around the car, peering in the windows, then looks up resolutely once he reaches Cas again. "I'm buying it."
He drops his hand and sits back on his heels. “How do I… help you? I mean, treat it, bandage it, whatever?”
He sighs. "I never expected this to happen, Dean. I knew there might be…complications to using the Mark of Cain, but I didn't foresee this. I thought the two of use could go on ruling hell forever."
Dean slows down after about ten or fifteen minutes and pulls over to the side of the road overlooking the canyon. "How ya doin', Angel?"
"Okay, Cas," Dean says, and he sounds amused. "Button it, then." Cas does so as Dean continues. "You have two jobs riding pillion—as a passenger: one, when I lean to turn, don't resist it, just go with me; and two, don't fall off. Good?" He pulls his helmet on and revs the bike's engine, probably just for fun.
Just then, the demon gasps, stiffening, and an orange light seems to flicker inside her, illuminating her skeleton before she collapses.
He feels bad sending the kid on a wild goose chase for a nonexistent nurse, but he needs him out of the room. The timing is narrow, too—the moment the curtain swings shut behind Jack, Dean breaks into tears.
Jack sighs in relief. It’s Jody, the person who first gave him a tour of the station and the only one he knows for certain is approachable. If he can, he’s going to try to stick to her like glue.
The man shakes his head and, curious, goes to the other car. He looks through the warped gap that used to be the driver's side window and can see the man sitting behind the tattered airbags, pieces of the car's engine burning through his lap. His eyes are still half open, staring blankly at the floor of the car, seeing nothing. He's only been truly dead for a matter of seconds.
Between glances at the road, Dean watches his brother. It’s been less than two years since they killed the Yellow-Eyed Demon, but it feels like it’s been a lifetime since he had Sam in the passenger seat.
Dean's kneeling in front of the toilet, having just finished heaving into it. He flushes it and turns back to look at Cas. "Yeah."
"Here you go," Sam says, setting the drink in front of him and returning to his position leaning on the counter.
“I know. It’s just… I’m not proud of a lot of the things we did to get to the demon—what happened to Meg Masters and some of the other demon vessels, nearly getting that family in Salvation killed, getting Ash killed and the original Roadhouse burned down. Hell, losing Dad, too. But at least… I don’t know if the ends justify the means, but at least there was an end. I was willing to give up everything to kill the Yellow-Eyed Demon. Everything. I’d do the same to kill Lilith.”
"Hm," Crowley scoffs, staring after her. Hellhounds are brilliant creatures and he's terribly fond of working with them, but just this once, he wishes they weren't so brutal.
"I can tell you…what I know about them," Cas offers. "I learned a bit when I looked you up after you poisoned me."
He follows Cas to a table outside. He’s the first to take a seat, and Cas hesitates before sitting across from him.
Dean gets to his feet, the sinking dread growing in his chest. He turns to the church steps and begins to climb them.
“Are you sure it’s not just that you can’t stand the thought of him putting himself in danger without you there to protect him?”
"No. No, I'm going to do it. I want to take you somewhere. Not somewhere in particular, just—anywhere. Let's go. I'll get over it."
"Dean," Cas says, putting a hand on Dean's shoulder to stop him. "I'm glad you decided to find him. I am. But are you…ready? You had a lot of reservations about it just a few minutes ago."
“Uh-huh.” As usual, Bobby is buying none of Dean’s bullshit. “Have you talked to Sam anytime recently?”
Dean grabs Jack’s arm, pulling him out of his thoughts, and Jack removes the stethoscope from his ears.
“I’m in,” Sam says quietly. “I mean, it’s the apocalypse. I can’t just turn the other cheek, can I?”
Cas has little choice but to watch it all unfold in misery. He tells himself that there's a way back from this, that Dean can still be human, but after hours at eccentric libraries across the world, he knows there are only two ends to this story. Either Dean abandons this life to return to being a demon, or the Mark wastes him away to nothing.
He redresses himself and soon after finds himself sitting cross-legged on the floor up against the side of the bed. He's staring out the window and wondering.
"Dean, no—" He grunts as he catches Dean's attempted blow. He twists Dean's arm until he drops the knife and holds his wrist in an iron grip. For a moment, he thinks Dean will try to swing at him with the other arm, but he doesn't. He stops struggling and instead grits his teeth and turns away. Cas lets go.
This makes Dean snort in amusement, though Cas didn't really feel like it had been a joke. "You've got a one-up on most, then."
Sam frowns as he twists a saline syringe onto Dean’s IV to flush it. “It might be a while for ‘normal,’ but yeah, eventually. I mean, there probably is some damage to your lungs that may not go away, but you’d have to ask the doctor about that, that’s above my pay grade.”
Dean glances over at his brother from the driver’s seat. Repeatedly clicking the pen he accidentally stole from the inn, Sam turns over his options as if he’s mentally solving a Rubik’s cube. Dean can’t imagine how this is decision requires so much consideration, but he can’t imagine going to law school, either. Maybe there are things about his little brother he will never understand.
Sam raises the bottle toward his lips, then changes his mind and sets it down on the table. His expression looks something like guilt. He seems like he’s about to speak, but he doesn’t. Dean debates telling him about Lilith, about how whatever kind of war they’re fighting will be a hundred times worse soon, but he doesn’t.
He leaves his room and goes down to Dean's. Even with his celestial hearing, he can't hear anything inside the door. With a sigh, he knocks three times.
"Well hello, Dean," the demon says, feigning surprise. "What a coincidence I would run into Crowley's little favorite."
Cas responds by pulling off his trench coat, then his suit coat, and starting to unbutton his dress shirt. "I had the idea a while back. I thought it…it meant something to me and it would probably mean something to you, so I just went with it…."
He finds the first bathroom he comes across and enters it with a troubled frown. He feels sick to his stomach, which is something he hasn't felt in years. He turns on the old faucet and rinses the blood off his blade before setting it aside and washing his hands of the dead woman's blood.
"Why Dean?" Sam asks, shaking his head in disbelief. "You changed…you changed everything for both of us, and I didn't even know you existed."
Jack gets to know the people who aren’t on his shift as well—namely Lieutenant LaFitte, a large Louisiana man with a smoky voice and a unique chemistry with Dean. Jack encounters Chief Singer again for the first time since he was hired, and he often sees Jody at shift change.
"I swear nothing changed," Crowley continues, and now he chooses his words carefully and keeps looking at Sam to judge his thoughts. "I did the same things I always did, yet suddenly he turned on me and said he no longer wanted anything to do with me. I don't…blame him for it, not really, but it doesn't make sense."
He kneels by the door to scratch and hug them before going to the kitchen and pulling out a beer. He turns on the TV, but he can’t seem to pay attention to it. This is nothing new—he’s been feeling oddly distanced from his own life for weeks—but it seems to be getting worse. He only seems to feel alive at work, and even then, he can tell he’s not quite acting himself. He thinks Garth and Rufus can sense it, but neither of them has said anything.
Dean is in the middle of the room, slamming a man—a demon—against the wall with his forearm at the demon's neck.
Sam sighs. “He’s fine. We convinced him to stay to get checked out. I think once the adrenaline wore off, he realized he wasn’t feeling so great. But he’ll be alright.”
"I don't know what I want." He shakes his head as he works on buttoning his flannel. "I can't—I can't imagine what I'd say. 'Hi, I'm your brother you thought died years ago! I'm a demon or something and I've killed lots of people. How are you today?'"
"So did you." He sighs and doesn't look at Cas. "I don't know what the hell this is. I mean, I barely know you and I sure as hell don't know...you know, love. I'd be crap at it, anyway. Case in point," he says, gesturing to the room.
About an hour out of town, Dean starts to follow the road up a small hill—the most one can find in Texas. The top is bare, with nothing but some asphalt and a cell phone tower. He pulls in and parks.
“Dean… I know it’s not an easy thing to do—to even imagine doing, but we’ve talked about this, and you’ve promised me—”
“It’s kinda true,” Jody says. “He’s not too bad once you figure him out. Now, Rufus? Rufus is always bad.”
They make their way outside to where Sam parked Bobby’s car behind the school. Sam leans against the car while Dean faces him.
“Yeah, well. That’s the life, ain’t it? By the way, what do you think they were talking about, a new leader? I didn’t think the demons had a leader after my brother and I killed that yellow-eyed son of a bitch.”
He looks up at the sound of the hushed whisper and sees Dean at the window, pushing it open and climbing inside with the ease of someone who had snuck through a lot of windows before.
Dean doesn’t know if the question is directed at him or someone else entirely. Still on his knees, he falls to his uninjured elbow, holding his broken arm to his chest.
She swings for his head. She’s too strong for him to block, so he deflects over his shoulder, throwing her off balance, and dives for his bag. He grabs a fire extinguisher out of it and pulls the pin, turning and squeezing the lever just in time to spray holy water into the demon’s face. She screams, flesh sizzling, and stumbles backward, giving Dean a chance to retrieve his pistol. As soon as she’s recovered from the holy water, he puts a bullet in her leg.
Sam steps out of his car and sticks the key back in the lock to lock it. He's had a lot on his mind lately and even though it's 2:30 am, his mind is wide awake with thoughts.
Then two demons enter, holding a third between them. It takes Crowley just a moment to recognize the intruder, who holds his head high and has a smirk on his face.
Cas glances at Dean, who's lost most of the color from his face. "Yes," Cas says after a moment's hesitation.
He's kept all of this from Dean so that he can surprise him when it's done. Maybe if he hadn't been distracted with the whole idea, he would've noticed the spattering of blood on the floor by the window, or the crushed box of cigarettes. Maybe if he'd truly been able to sleep instead of shut down the way angels do, he would've awoken when Dean left early, early in the morning, long before he would've agreed to meet with his brother.
“I fuckin’ hate him for ever saying that to me.” His hand tightens on the steering wheel, the smooth leather pressing reassuringly into his palm. “My whole life, you know, it’s been my number-one job to protect you from—the world, and the better I followed Dad’s orders, the better I could do that. To have his dying request be to protect the world from you? If I could take that back, if I could’ve never heard him say that… I wish to God he’d just left it at ‘I’m proud of you,’ and ‘don’t be scared.’ That’s what dads are supposed to say.”
"No," Cas says firmly. "If I wanted him dead, he'd be dead already. Is that the only wound you got?"
Dean rubs a hand over his face and pivots to lie back on the bench. “I’m fine. It’s just… different, hunting without Sam or Dad. I guess got used to having my brother with me again.”
"No, Cas…" Dean's not even trying to stop the tears that are starting run down his face. He puts a hand on the back of Cas's head as he lowers him to the ground. He uses his left hand to cover the wound just below and to the side of Cas's heart while he digs Cas's phone out of his trench coat with the other. He dials 911 and tells them exactly two things: where he is and to bring an ambulance. Then he slips the phone back into Cas's pocket.
Cas smiles. “Probably not.” He steps out from behind the counter and points to one of the tables against the wall. “Come on.”
He gets up from the couch and beckons the dogs to come outside with him. He crosses the parking lot to his garage, which isn’t where he parks his blue 2016 Impala, but instead where he keeps an old, bittersweet relic of his turbulent childhood.
He watches Dean stand and exchange final words with the woman’s daughter. She nods and he sees her say “thank you.” Dean puts a hand briefly on her upper arm, then walks to the ambulance.
Cas lowers his head, turns it slightly toward Dean. “No. I don’t consider Heaven a home. But I suppose… I don’t really know what one would feel like if I had it.”
"Okay," Cas answers stiffly, suddenly wondering why he'd agreed to this. Technically, he hadn't, but—
"There's a point in life where you learn not to ask questions you don't want to know the answer to. It seems you haven't reached that point yet."
Crowley continues calmly. “It’s what Azazel was working toward for years—making the right little minion to release Lucifer. A human who can kill a demon with their bare hands, and who, in the process, becomes a demon themselves. Reversal of the natural order and such.”
It had been a few weeks ago that he spontaneously decided to get a tattoo. He hadn't thought much about it, but he knew immediately what he would get. He'd read that tattoos take a long time to finish if they're large—and this one definitely was—but that was often because humans had to heal between, and that wasn't exactly a problem for him. So he'd called a parlor and made an appointment for the entire day in order for it to be done before they inevitably moved to a different town.
“Well—I never stay in one place long, and usually I’m the one hunting the demons, not the other way around.”
The penultimate chapter, AKA: you didn't think I was going to plant that Chekhov's gun without firing it, did you?
Dean shakes his head and runs a hand over his face. He's still looking at his beer bottle instead of at Cas. "I don't know, Cas."
As Sam nods and turns to get another drink, Crowley shakes his head. What is he doing here, talking to his best friend's brother?
“I’ll worry about him,” Cas says, “but I was doing that anyway. It’s a dangerous job. He knew that when he applied, and so did I.” He leans forward on the railing of Dean’s bed. “You never told me how you’re doing.”
"I—I know a lot of the souls in heaven. I know about them the same way I knew all of this. It's not like angels get to interact with human souls in their individual heavens—not only is it frowned upon, but specific souls can be nearly impossible to find. But I can find out who's there."
Dean straightens slightly and says nothing. His heart is still pounding and he's focused on the angel he almost got to kill, wishing he could sink his knife into his chest.
Dean moves to catch Cas, but Alastair's shiny black shoe collides with his stomach, shoving him backward and into the chain-link fence behind him.
"That was ridiculous," Dean complains. "What's so bad about paying for it in cash? I had enough. Screw their monthly payments."
The angel stands a few yards from the bottom of the steps, his face lowered. He holds a long, narrow sword with an Enochian inscription on the blade that flickers orange like embers.
"Yes, of course," Sam manages, though he still doesn't look convinced. He shakes his head. "But your eyes are wrong….He had light eyes. Green." He laughs humorlessly. "Not to mention, Dean, you're dead. I went to your funeral."
“You bet they do. They don’t understand how you haven’t starting using nicotine or dropping the word ‘fuck’ into every sentence, though.”
“I just keep thinking,” Jack says, “maybe if we had done something differently, if we had gotten there earlier or if I had done better chest compressions or if…” He sniffles and wipes his eyes again.
It seems strange to think of Dean as his best friend. There had always been a hierarchy about their relationship; Crowley found something for Dean to do, Dean did it. It was simple. But it's undeniable as well that the two had some great times together.
“Honestly? I don’t. I don’t cope with it. I never figured out how. But I learned how to shove it all down. I had to do it to take care of my brother, because my dad wouldn’t, and it’s the same thing I do for patients and their families. That’s the closest I come to dealing with my trauma, I guess. Helping other people deal with theirs.”
Dean yanks Cas to the side by the collar of his coat just as a truck speeds by, blaring its horn at them.
Cas narrows his eyes and takes it, holding it between his finger and thumb. Dean watches with amusement as Cas puts it between his lips, wrinkling his nose. As soon as he inhales, he chokes and coughs, glaring at Dean, who chuckles. Cas drops the cigarette and steps on it, extinguishing it.
"No, Cas, I don't think you're gonna like it." He crosses the room, casting a wary glance at the door, and sits down in the seat near Cas's bed. "Sit down, Angel, you look like you're in pain."
Cas pauses. His grip on his blade tightens. "Babysitter? Is that really all you think of me? I risk everything for you, put up with your constant ups and downs, and you think I'm just your babysitter?"
Jo scoffs. “Bartending for my mom, getting hit on by drunk assholes every week? Yeah, I sure want to preserve
The king isn't convinced. He's kept the hellhound Ophelia from killing Sam for a couple weeks now—which made the hellhound restless, clearly—but he has to wonder if that was a wise move. What if
"Thank you, that's very helpful. Crowley," he says as the demon looks like he's going to leave again. "You tried to kill me, but you also saved my ass, so no one's indebted to anyone. But for my own sake, is there…is there a way I can contact you if I run into any of this stuff again?"
“You couldn’t have picked somewhere with rooms that opened to the parking lot?” Dean grumbles as they make their way down the hall.
But that’s not his problem anymore. If Dean doesn’t want to talk to him now that he’s not hunting, so be it. That’s the sacrifice he made to get out.
Cas frowns, and it occurs to him. Maybe Dean left. Maybe he checked out early and left Cas to fend for himself.
"I can't," he says sharply. Then he takes a breath and explains in a shaking voice, "I can't trust myself, Cas. Not after what I did to you. I have to stay away from…anyone, or I think I'm going to snap."
“Oh, she’ll be fine now. Once they get her some steroids, get a chest x-ray, all that—she’ll be fine.”
Dean turns back with an amused scoff, one corner of his mouth turning up. Julius is one of the few hellhounds who doesn't hate Dean. Most of them were vicious when Dean first arrived in hell as an eleven-year-old boy, probably still reeking of human. Julius, however, had been born to Juliet when Dean was about fourteen. They'd grown up together, in a way, and Julius liked Dean even more than he liked Crowley.
Cas smiles slightly at the demon's utter confusion and steps to the other side of the motorcycle, behind him. He points out the constellation again from over Dean's shoulder. "There are three stars, two brighter than the others, all close together right there."
"You must be the king of hell's second-in-command," the angel says in a British accent. "I've heard about you."
Dean snatches the knife from his boot and hurls it across the room, catching the demon in the lower back. It’s a regular knife, nothing that could really hurt it, but it’s a distraction.
"Dean," he says, standing. Even though he'd known this was coming as soon as he saw the text, he's still surprised to see him. "Wh—why are you here? You sounded like—you made it sound like you'd never come back."
"You don't want to mess with me," Dean says, and Cas is almost disturbed by how easily he takes on the threatening demon facade. "I've beaten you before—I could do it again."
Sam takes a moment to process this and find where it fits with what he already knows. The stakes are higher than he expected, but does it change anything?
"Shut up," Dean chuckles. Then he sighs. "I need some time to think about all this." He gives the angel a quick kiss on the lips and steps away from him. "I'm going for a ride, I'll be back in an hour, maybe."
Cas nods, frowning. He lets a silence fall before saying, "I don't want it to end like this." He looks at the floor. "I've looked through everything I can about the Mark of Cain and I can't find anything about a cure."
“You know what you’re doing?” Dean asks Jack, his voice crackling through the speaker of the respirator mask. “You feel comfortable with this?”
“Or,” she says, gesturing with her beer bottle, “everything up until now has been a way of testing him to see if he’s up for this." She sees him scowling. "Hey, I’m just playing devil’s advocate here.”
Any personal problems the brothers might be having always disappear when they’re at work. They haven’t spoken since the restaurant parking lot, but their frustrations always come second to their patients.
Then the noise stops, and the light fades. Cautiously, Dean lowers his hands and lifts his head. For a moment, he sees the flicker of a sort of afterimage—a vaguely humanoid form, metallic bronze and covered in glowing eyes, seemingly faceless, with six burning wings and three crystalline wheels encircling it like rings around a planet. He must see for half a second or less, but for that time, it’s overwhelming. It pushes every thought from his mind, fills him with an inexplicable awe and desperation, and weakens him to the point he nearly collapses.
But Cas is faster and uses his other hand instead. He can sense that the inner lining of the demon's stomach is torn up and other parts of his vital organs are damaged in ways Cas can't quite identify. He tries to heal them as best he can, but he can't fix all of it, like something's blocking his power.
In his periphery, he sees Bart stare at him for a moment. “What, so I didn’t do any good over there, either? We’re just all a bunch of senseless killers?”
"Maybe it just takes a while, or maybe we can find some kind of spell to counter it. Maybe Crowley's lying—"
Crowley shifts in his throne so he can face Dean. "A little birdy told me that an angel has been icing my crossroads demons. I don't know why and I don't know how, but I don't particularly care. I want him dead." He pulls a folded piece of a map from inside his suit coat. "I've marked the places the angel's been seen recently on here, but it's the best I've got. You'll have to track him down from there."
“Good news is,” Dean says dryly, a smirk in his voice, “now you’re familiar with the back of the ambulance.”
Dean scowls. He's never talked about this in his life and now the angel wants details. "No, I didn't really know what'd happened. I was vaguely aware of some pain, but I wasn't paying attention when we crashed and I went unconscious immediately. I was technically still too young to ride in the front seat of a car; it's amazing I didn't die right away. But when I woke up…again, no. Honestly, I didn't know I was a demon. I didn't think I should still be alive, but for a while—a few days, actually—I felt just as human as I'd ever been."
Annoyingly, Sam was right. Dean felt emotionally volatile all day yesterday, and he would’ve hated to let Jack see how much the accident had affected him. If there’s one thing he’s noticed about the kid, it’s that he takes Dean’s cues, and he worried that Jack knowing how shaken he was about it would make Jack’s own experience worse. Seeing how spirited Jack is now, his concern seems unwarranted. Of course, when Dean was that age, he would’ve bounced back a lot easier, too.
Dean kneels, reaching out slowly and putting his hand under the wound, letting the glowing grace flow over his palm. Compared to the heat from the wing, it feels pleasantly cool. As it swirls in eddies around his hand, he
Alastair smirks. "I have resources, Crowley. I'm not the outcast you assume I am. Your little pet has run away."
"Dean…" Cas starts, stepping toward him. If he could just put a hand on Dean's shoulder, they'd be able to get out of here.
"Might as well do it before I change my mind," he figures, trying not to think about it too hard. He knows it's probably the right thing to do, but though part of him is excited about the thought of meeting his brother, the other part of him dreads it.
Alastair raises his eyebrows. "Oh he will, will he? What makes you so sure? Do you know what he's been doing?"
Cas steps over and kneels beside him, putting his hands on Dean's shoulders and forcing him to face him. "Why did you do it? What happened?"
Cas smiles slightly as he shifts back to lean on the railing again. “I’m glad you’re still with us, Dean. For Jack’s sake, and for the community’s.”
“We don’t have time for me to explain, the fire department’s probably already here.” Sam wavers on his feet and Dean puts a hand out to steady him.
“You wanna talk about no secrets?” Sam bursts out. “How about the fact that you’ve been talking to a fucking angel? He could’ve helped us, Dean, he could’ve saved Bobby and Ellen if you had just told us about him. So, you’re too damn proud to pray? Fine. I would’ve done it.”
There’s The Colonel, a German Shepherd that used to be part of a K-9 unit for the local PD, until he lost a front leg and was retired. His handler, a friend of Dean’s, had intended to adopt the dog himself, until The Colonel attacked one of his young kids and it became obvious that was an impossibility. He had offered him to Dean instead. Even after getting bitten twice and having multiple people tell him The Colonel should be put down, Dean persisted in rehabilitating him. He still tells visitors not to touch The Colonel unless the dog approaches them first, but no one has been bitten in almost three years.
"Wow," Sam says with a frown. "I shouldn't have made you go first." He's just spent the last hour listening to Dean talk about everything that's happened since the car crash and he can hardly believe it. It sounds miserable, for starters, but the whole demon thing also makes him intensely uncomfortable. Though he tried to avoid the topic numerous times, Dean admitted to having committed murder, which was both terrifying and very difficult to believe. Except for the look in his eyes when he said it—that was something Sam feels he will never forget. There was never a number disclosed on this topic, but though Dean made it sound as though he hadn't killed very many, the discomfort in Castiel's expression said something different.
"I had a very distinct idea of how I wanted to be," Dean says, still not turning around, which Cas finds odd. "I got most of these to say who I was for me, because I felt like I wasn't meeting my own expectations. I don't regret getting them, but I sure as hell don't need them to show what kind of…person…I am."
He remembers Dean's words and repeats them to himself quietly as he feels around. Eventually, he finds one of the lines on the ground. He keeps one hand on it and crawls alongside it, past the fires and the debris raining down from the ceiling. He makes it far enough out to see the glow of the open doorway and a silhouette appears inside it.
He pulls the stake out and flicks blood off of it, then turns to gather his gear. He comes face-to-face with Castiel.
Dean shrugs and pulls out a box of cigarettes and a lighter. “I don’t know, man, I’m just tired. You’re getting all Freudian on me again. You should’ve been a psych nurse instead of an ER nurse, I swear.”
When it’s five to eight, he gets out of the car, swings his backpack over his shoulder, and heads in toward the station.
The first big structure fire Jack fights happens in late morning on a seemingly normal May day. It’s the kind of abrupt change that he’s come to expect in this job—one minute, he’s sitting in the shift office finishing a report from the day before, and less than ten minutes later, he’s in full turnouts with an oxygen tank on his back and a respirator mask under his arm, staring down the roaring blaze of a fire bursting out the corner of an old single-story house, the smoke billowing out so thickly it darkens the sky above him.
Rufus nods. “You go in with Kline. I’ll post Fitz by your egress in case visibility changes. Our priority is to keep it from jumping to the house next door.”
Cas opens his eyes. He stares at the white, oddly textured ceiling for a few seconds, then frowns. He sits up and glances around, which reminds him of what he was doing.
Dean pulls the knives out of him and lets his body fall to the pavement. He turns, and as soon as he lays eyes on the last two demons, they smoke out.
The demon undoes the boy's seat belt and pulls him out of the seat, lifting him into his arms. He carries him to the back of the car, then sits on the vehicle's trunk and just holds him.
As if he could hear him, Dean stirs weakly. The wound on his head heals over. His brow furrows in confusion and discomfort, as if he knew he was supposed to die and now he's not sure what's happening. His eyes open, and his irises are pure black.
She smiles and shakes her head. “I like doing this. I’m good at it, and I can help people. I think I’ll try to find this Men of Letters headquarters now that I’m not preoccupied with the banshee.”
Kill sixty-six kids. It’s not like he could’ve expected the seals of Hell to be rainbows and sunflowers, but this takes the cake for horrible.
Dean releases him a steps away before he can finish. Cas straightens and looks up at him, still defensive.
"Cas, it's okay. We'll get there." Dean gives him a tired smile and a pat on the shoulder. "Let's go home. Or—wherever. We'll spend the night and tomorrow I'll…I'll make sure I talk to everyone. Then we can talk about feelings." He chuckles. "Not too much at one time."
He'd only gone unconscious for a few minutes back in his apartment, but when he'd woken up, the man from the bar was nowhere to be found and he could hear sirens outside. So Crowley had called 911 instead of just driving Sam to the hospital, which was only a few minutes away.
Dean winces involuntarily as she slaughters the Latin pronunciation. As he gets closer, he can see that there is another road running through the north/south one, though it's smaller and less noticeable than the one he'd been at. The woman standing there is more of a girl, actually, probably between eighteen and twenty. College kid, like he expected.
"Exactly," Cas sighs. "I don't know what's causing you to be a demon, but it's connected to murder."
Cas's vision starts to swim and he blinks several times in confusion. "It was something about Crowley's second-in-command, he…took me off guard…." He's seeing dark spots now and his hearing starts to fade out. "Balthazar…what's happening…?"
“You asshole.” Sam shakes his head, fidgeting with his hospital badge. “I just about panicked when I heard Garth give that patch. Thirty-nine-year-old male firefighter injured in building collapse? Fuck that.”
“Yes. But he apologized for it. I don’t know what it is, he just makes me nervous. Everyone else on the shift seems to understand how to get along with him, but… I don’t know. I guess it’s just me.”
Pain tears him out of the dream instantly. Searing pain throughout his whole body, a horrible roar, complete darkness. He’s not even certain he’s still in the motel until he finds the knife under his pillow. But there’s nothing to stab, nothing to see.
"Cas," Dean answers before he starts to cough. At first he assumes it's something from the crash, but he hadn't been coughing up blood before.
"Anyway, he just crashed his motorcycle and he looks pretty torn up. I think he needs medical help but he won't let me call an ambulance. We're at the corner of Eleventh and Cleveland—he wants you to get here, but…discreetly? Whatever that means. …who am I? I'm the one he nearly hit and, right now, the only one helping him. Can you just head over? I'm kinda worried about him."
The demon flinches as the stake starts to draw blood. “She has—yes, she has a few demons she works closely with, but I don’t know where they are.”
Cas notices that Dean's hands are gripping the counter on either side of the sink so tightly his knuckles have gone white. He convulses once as if heaving or giving a silent cough and he lowers his head over the sink.
"Cas, I—" He looks around at the demons he killed so effortlessly, and the dead vessels he hadn't spared a thought to. "I messed up."
