Cas closed the door to his bedroom, cursing its lack of a working lock. Dean had added locks to his and Sam’s doors, but not bothered with the other rooms. He turned the light off and lay on the bed, fully clothed. The darkness didn’t comfort him, but if anyone tried to open the door there was a chance they would assume he was sleeping and would leave him alone. They wouldn't know that his grace was still enough for him not to need to sleep. He just couldn’t cope with any more today.
"I'll regret it if I don't do this."
"Grumpy, but you love me, apparently."
"The friend I screwed things up with? It's his favourite place to go."
Dean let out a long, slow hiss through his teeth as he fought to stay in control. Cas let Dean's cock pop out of his mouth for long enough to moan against it.
"Good morning, Sunshine!" he greeted Cas with far more cheer than was warranted considering his extreme lack of coffee and the God-awful situation he was walking into.
Dean groaned. Cas was wet with his own pre-cum and
"I know you're lonely. Hell, aren't we all? But Jack's a child - he's not even four years old, whatever he looks like on the outside. He's innocent in all this."
Cas took his uninjured, dry hand and using his thumb and forefinger, he found the right spot and squeezed hard.
Cas held out the slightly less filled cup of coffee and Dean unfolded his arms to take it without a thanks, placing it unceremoniously on the table by the door.
Dean had closed his eyes and Cas' attention was drawn to Dean's knee, where his hand was still resting, and where Dean's own hand was inching closer to his, tiny movement by tiny movement. Dean didn't dare to put his hand over Cas', but finally, after Cas had watched Dean's progress for three or four minutes, barely daring to breathe, their hands finally touched.
"We've gotta get up soon," Dean groaned. He didn't want to. He wasn't sure he could face today.
"Yes," Dean agreed, helpless to do anything else. He knew at the very first touch of Cas' lips on his skin that this would be his ruin. He wouldn't come back from this,
"Nothing that you'd count," he hedged, "and never that snuggling on the sofa, sharing worries at 3am sort of relationship."
That will never change, Dean. All I'm asking is that you trust me. Please trust me."
First came the dark grey t-shirt, proclaiming
"See that, Sammy? Luck seems to be on Chuck's side. I wonder why that is? Any idea, Chuck?"
"Will Sammy be okay?" his words were in an undertone, but Cas heard them and nodded his head almost imperceptibly.
It was the least he could do really, after making him all soggy. Not a single ulterior motive there - he'd even close his eyes while Cas changed. He was being practically saintly.
kid and having him back would make us a family."
Dean bent to kiss him. “You’re mine, Cas. Say it.” he demanded gruffly, licking and sucking at his throat.
"I want to use you for sex, Cas," Dean bit out. "Do you understand that? You're okay with that, right? An Angel of the Lord, used for a quick fuck. That okay with you?"
"I don't think this is a good idea." His head didn't, but his hand was already moving slowly up and down the length of his cock, not wanting to give in to frustration and rush it, but not wanting to resist it any longer. Having Cas on the other end of the line was doing things to him that made his entire body tingle.
Dean stared at her, uncomprehending.
"In some ways I think Bobby was more of a father to you than your dad was."
When Cas had bribed Gertie into silence by offering her Sam's precious giant strawberries from the refrigerator, he briefly wondered how he'd ever thought he had decent parenting skills. He'd let Jack and Claire down and now it turned out that bribery was his go-to parenting solution. He voiced this to Bess.
. I can see everything you've done and I love you, Dean."
Thank you all so much for your support ❤️ You're all awesome and I'm sorry for torturing you with yet another cliffhanger (although not sorry enough not to do it).
Cas fiddled with the radio stations until he found a station playing soft rock. He smiled at Dean's nod of approval.
Dean nodded in silence, at least acknowledging him if nothing else. They'd reached a river and he wound his window down to hear the roaring of a mini-waterfall just to the right of them, so close Dean could almost reach the water with his fingers.
"Twice today. You're not going to be able to sit down tomorrow." The thought of that shouldn't have sent a bolt of pleasure straight to his cock, but it did.
"But did you get it in writing?" Cas teased, more light hearted than Dean remembered ever having seen him.
Chuck leaned over the table and scooped his finger through the mound of rapidly cooling mashed potato, bringing some to his mouth to taste. He looked up at Dean, reading his momentarily unguarded expression of shame correctly and his eyes widened in understanding.
“Excellent idea,” Dean said, throwing some money on the table and getting to his feet. He turned to Kate, eyeing Cas' hand on her shoulder before lifting his gaze to meet hers.
Dean wanted to lean into Cas, to close the gap and draw comfort from him. But he couldn't. He didn't deserve to.
"Buddy?"
"A rock I had to step on gave way."
This Cas reminded him much more of the Castiel he had met in the barn that night. Powerful, emotionless - no, that wasn't right. There were waves of emotion coming from the man,
"Enough of my failings, Castiel," Chuck interrupted. He groaned as he wrapped an arm around his side and tried to move, before giving up and collapsing back to the floor. "If you're going to lecture me you can just bring Dean back to finish the job now.
"Yeah. And for the record, that's saying something."
either, Dean. There is no 'greater good' that takes you away from me. Do you hear me? I can't lose you."
"Yes," Dean bit out, uncaring of how needy he sounded. "You can do anything you want to me. Just… do
Dean sighed and reluctantly let go of Cas' hand. They both got to their feet, took one last fond look at the sleeping children and stepped out of the room, blinking at the bright light of the hallway. Just before they stepped back out into the library, Dean caught Cas' arm and held him back.
This isn't a possession." But it was. In almost every way imaginable it was.
Leaning over and in an undertone, so that Kate couldn't hear what he was saying, Cas whispered, "You do realise that Claire did all this because she thinks we're hiding a secret relationship and she wants us to feel we can announce it?"
Dean reached to the side to flick off the pretty green lamp that Cas always put on for them to watch TV and snuggle by, and then he craned his neck to look at Kate.
Freezing and watching the stairs expectantly, they both breathed a sigh of relief when Donna appeared at the bottom, closely followed by Alex and Patience, both carrying bowls of food and what looked very much like pie. Dean's eyes lit up.
Dean's pupils were big, his eyes a little glazed. He was looking at Cas' lips like he wanted nothing more than to be kissing them. Cas loved kissing Dean, loved the way Dean would lick his way into his mouth. Sometimes he purposely kept his mouth closed, just so Dean would do it. The feel of him teasing his lips, winning him over, pushing into his mouth. Up until this morning Cas would have said that kissing Dean was actually better than sex. Now he supposed he could still say that kissing Dean was better than sex with anyone else, because it was
Forcing the pancakes down really hadn't helped the nervous rolling of his stomach and Cas's feet seemed to drag more and more the closer he got to Dean's bedroom door. He didn't want to fight anymore, but with Dean so obviously angry and resentful towards him, Cas wasn't sure how to avoid it. Last time he became human Dean had pushed him away entirely and this time they were hardly on a good footing to start with. He fought his every instinct to turn back and avoid conflict, and knocked.
"Can I have a moment before you kill him?" he asked. Dean shrugged, not even turning his head to meet Cas' eyes. He was shut down now, not feeling anything in that moment, the torturer from Hell persona entirely in place. Cas hated it, hated that once again Dean was like that and it was because he'd asked for it.
So why was no one here to protect him? Where was the Cavalry? If they were right, if
"Dean," Cas' voice cracked. "I don't want to lose you."
"Yeah? You alright?"
Dean felt the smile spreading across his face and was utterly helpless to stop it.
Kate snorted, then quickly turned it into a cough when Dean turned his glare on her.
With every brush of Cas' thumb, every time he heard the rumble of his voice, or sensed him shifting in his seat, Dean ached to be closer to him. He got through the rest of the film by sheer, stubborn determination alone, but that was all the rest of them were getting. He would spend time with his brother later, maybe in a week when he finally let Cas out of his bed, but certainly not before.
"I see. Then I'm even more sorry. Shall we go to bed now?"
Despite the time, despite the ridiculousness of his brother bursting in to save him brandishing a freakin' shoe, Dean grinned at him. Even Sam's insanity was amusing him tonight.
“Cas, you’re killing me,” Dean choked out. Tears were stinging his eyes and he couldn’t understand why. He watched Cas’ dark head moving slowly up his body, stopping to trace every freckle, every mole, every scar as he went. He looked so absorbed, so lost in what he was doing, as if every individual cell of Dean's body was a wonder. No one had ever treated Dean like this, worshipped his body, loved him with every touch like this. It was incredible and perfect, and it made Dean’s heart ache and flutter in his chest. When a tear escaped from the corner of his eye, Dean bit his lip, holding his breath in case Cas noticed.
is pure. He is pure and good and fucking precious and tonight, someone hurt him.”
"Do you hear me?” Dean growled. “Never! Whatever the situation - you make sure you come back to me. You got that?"
"I'm feeling good. Great, even." Dean smiled at him, his eyes burning with a warmth that Cas tried so hard not to get lost in. When Cas didn't reply, Dean leaned into him, so close that if they let their arms join in, they'd be cuddling.
"Do you really sing to Nigel?"
"You're forgetting why we're here."
Maybe Cas wasn't the right person to approach him? For a moment last night, when Dean had held him in his arms, it had felt so close to coming home that he could have wept from the sheer relief of it. But as always with Dean Winchester, the happy moments were fleeting and inconsistent, like the moment Dean became aware of their very existence he banished them away, never allowing himself more than a moment of happiness. Last night, just minutes after pulling him close, Dean had barely been able to look at him without trembling in anger. In contrast, Dean's regard of his brother was unwavering and constant - he needed to get Sam on board.
you slip through? What makes you different to every other Castiel?" Chuck asked him. "How did I make you
Putting the remains of the pie on the bedside table, Dean propped himself up on his elbow and slowly trailed his fingers over Cas' jaw, gazing down at him like he was his absolute everything—and he is.
Dean looked down at his feet and it was blatantly obvious which one he was choosing to do before he even spoke. Sam didn't even bother to ask Cas, apparently assuming that where one went, the other would go too.
"Saying my name doesn't
Dean looked at him. What he really wanted to do was put his coffee down and yank Cas into his arms and show him exactly how he could help him to feel better. But in the cold light of day, it felt like he didn’t have the right to do it. Were they at the point now where he could kiss Cas whenever he fancied it, or was this more a ‘during hook-ups only’ sort of situation? He’d had those before and they’d been pretty simple, but at no point in the past had he been confronted with quite this much temptation.
Dean’s hand snaked down between their bodies, cupping Cas’ cock through his jeans. He didn’t have the coordination to undo Cas’ jeans and belt while he was being touched like this. It felt like his fingers had grown thick and numb, rendering them useless for anything other than blindly clawing and grabbing at Cas through his clothes. How did Cas do this to him?
Cas nuzzled into his neck, letting his legs entwine with Dean's.
"It's nothing I can't handle."
"Are you going to be one of these people who thinks they're in charge, even when they're naked, bound and gagged?" Dean asked breathlessly.
"You would have followed orders just like every other Dean did," Chuck scoffed, "if it wasn't for this second rate, ungrateful Angel rejecting every gift he was given, just so he could assist you in throwing spanner after spanner in the works."
"There's a note here," Cas called, unfolding the page of bright green paper. "It's in really awful Spanish. This is actually the worst attempt at the language I've ever seen."
“I’ve barely seen you today,” he said, his teeth worrying his lip, like they often did when Dean had something to say that he was too scared to speak out loud. “I’ve been talking about you instead of to you, and I just felt like… like I needed to see you. Alone.”
The love that Cas had once hidden was shining from him. He was so used to hiding it that for weeks it had been second nature, but right now it was there for everyone to see, a declaration in the heat in his eyes, in the quirk of his lips, in his complete and utter undivided attention.
"—but she believes you do, and forcing your hand with Jack won't be what she wants."
“Yeah. Fucking
“You reading my mind again, Cas?” he said, clearing his throat as the words came out thick and wrong.
Dean had heard enough rants about 'unsolicited dick pics' from disgruntled friends over the years to know that people weren't actually as appreciative of photos of cocks as half the male population seemed to think, but this wasn't unsolicited—Cas wanted to see him and just the thought of that was hot enough to have his hand speeding up.
Cas groaned, his hips jerking as Dean demanded an answer.
"I'm trying." Dean could hear himself, his voice a broken, pleading croak, forcing its way through his pain and his tears.
Cas nodded and shrugged, obviously not picking up on the romance of the situation at all. Dean wondered what he'd have to do if he really wanted to romance the Angel and have him actually notice.
"Don't need it," Cas replied breathlessly.
"If I let your hands go, are you going to stop lashing out?" Cas asked.
"Not just any part of you!" she sniggered.
Dean fixed her with a hard stare. “Anything could have happened to him, Kate. Not to mention the fact that whoever did this, did it entirely without Cas’ knowledge or consent. It’s not fucking okay—alright?”
Dean forced himself to loosen his death-grip on the sheets. He reached down and hooked his thumbs in Cas' waistband, sitting up so he could drag them down Cas' legs. Cas lifted his hips, then his knees, shoving his pyjama pants down impatiently, before even more impatiently pulling at Dean's.
"Dean!"
"If I'd wanted you all dead I would have done it a long time ago." She looked over at Dean, her expression softening.
"Let's go and build a fucking snowman," he said, putting an arm around both Cas and Kate's shoulders, the pointy carrot now worryingly close to Cas' eyeball. "Sam's just texted to say he and Eileen are on their way over, and it's been years since I've hit him in the face with a snowball. We can talk later, Cas."
"I can come over more, if you like? This is much less awkward than I thought it would be and I've missed just hanging out, as you'd say."
At his jerky nod she placed the package on the ground again. "There is his wallet, with his credit card, ID, photos of Claire, Jack and you inside; the stuffed toy bee that you gave him for Christmas; a cellphone that has no charge left; and it's all wrapped up in a t-shirt of yours that he had borrowed. That's all they have returned of his. I can't tell you what they did with his body."
"Is that meant to be some revelation? You've
"You'll sleep far better in that cloud bed of yours than you will in mine at the bunker. Or, you know, any of the beds at the bunker at all," he added hastily, backtracking on how presumptuous he sounded. "I'm not saying you would want to sleep in my bed, but us, uh, being close… that worked pretty well last night. For your sleeping."
"Fine," Cas sighed. "I'd have intercourse with Rowena, marry Jodie and kill Crowley." He paused, glaring at Dean for even making him think about it. "I don't see the point of this game. Surely if you marry someone, you would be having intercourse with them on a regular basis. In which case, I would rather marry Rowena. Not that there's anything wrong with Jodie, although there
Fuck. Cas was pissed with him. That hadn't been the point of this at all.
"We were going to adopt. Waited two years, then we were weeks away from getting this beautiful baby girl, when it all fell through. I mean we were happy, but it always felt like something was missing, you know?"
"Don't," Dean warned.
"Is it supposed to stick in your teeth like this?" Cas pulled a face.
“Actually, I was going to say I'm not going to do anything you don't want.”
"I wish I could prove it to you, but that's going to take time." Cas sighed, reaching his other hand across to Dean's knee and squeezing it reassuringly. It was a poor substitute for a hug, but it could almost count as being platonic, so Cas was going with it.
He had no business wanting more - this was perfect. Cas was perfect.
"Besides, you being Graceless shouldn't be a reason for you not to help us. Your fighting was always sub-par - it was your mind that made you an excellent commander."
“Do you know why I'll always save you?” Cas asked, his words gentle, his hand still cupping Dean's face. Dean shook his head almost imperceptibly as Cas let his thumb trace over Dean’s cheek to wipe away the tears he found there.
books knew that Dean was bisexual. But it was only a few weeks ago that Dean had been in denial about that—not entirely to himself, but very much so to anyone around him who ever pressed him on it. Unlabelled was fine, but Dean deciding to embrace a label enough to claim it, that was a huge deal for him.
With a scowl she and Kaia had finally gone and Cas would have congratulated himself if it didn't feel like his world was ending.
here and it could well be permanent. We have to deal with that, even if… if the consequences might not be what we might have hoped for."
“Your son? Yours and Deans?” Kate’s eyebrows were raised.
"Look, Dean! Look! I'm bioluminescent!" Cas seemed to float towards them through a sea of dancing teenagers who automatically parted to make way for him, as he thanked each and every one of them like he was some sort of royalty.
Cas pulled Dean's back to his chest and murmured encouraging noises in his ear. One of his arms wrapped around his chest, holding Dean up and his other hand reached around to grip Dean's cock. He moved his hand in the same stuttering rhythm that his hips had changed to. He was losing control and Dean felt the exact moment that Cas went over the edge, the frantic snap of his hips against him was so hard that Dean had to brace himself against the wall. He was sure his moans could have been heard all over the Bunker.
"I’m warm."
"You promised me you wouldn't let me go, and now I need you to promise me that
being was his friend. Not just his friend, but he'd been willing to sacrifice his long and precious life on so many different occasions, all for Dean's short insignificant life. Dean's moment in time was nothing compared to the life Castiel had before he'd sacrificed it all for him.
"Dean, we're banned from ever going back. We're lucky he didn't press charges!"
"You don't have to explain, Dean. You did what you did to survive."
I've had messages and reviews that genuinely made me burst into happy tears. I love you guys so much.
"I know it doesn't sound good, Cas. I know what it makes me sound like and I'm so fucking sorry. I'm not trying to use you."
"You're drunk," Cas observed, as if that explained everything.
Cas felt the now familiar mix of relief at saying the words out loud, and the all consuming ache that he assumed came with all unrequited love.
"We're fine like this," Dean muttered defensively. He hated using his phone for the million different things everyone seemed to need them for these days. Phones were meant for calling, texting, and in a real emergency when his laptop was playing up, watching porn.
"Am I squashing you?" Cas asked. Was there an etiquette to this? Should he have Googled to see if there were rules?
https://youtu.be/H25ORRgLxdA
say it out loud.
"... I'm in bed."
Cas tipped his head to the side in the way that Dean had once told him made him look like an Alsatian who didn't quite understand what his owner was saying. Cas hadn't appreciated the comparison nor its implications.
"Can we not? I'm tired."
“Morning Cas. Morning Dickhead. Your food is cold!”
"I'll stay while Cas tells you one more story, okay?" Dean sat on the end of the unoccupied bed and patted the patterned blanket next to him for Cas to sit down next to him.
"Oh there'll be tears alright," Dean growled.
Dean had realised how badly he'd screwed up when he'd tried to call Cas the next day and it had gone straight to voicemail. Cas had replied half an hour later with a terse text, and Dean wasn't stupid, he knew why. But what else could he say? Messing around with guys once in a blue moon didn't make him gay, bi or anything else. People could fuck off with their labels. He liked sex was all. He was good at it, enjoyed it in all its forms.
Holding securely to toddler Cas’ legs, he trotted them out of the room, with the much, much older and far more weary Cas following closely behind. When they arrived at the room that had been set up with travel cots and beds, Garth was already reading a story to the remaining two children.
"Have things ended?" Cas asked, deliberately casual. His heart pounded in his chest as he forced the words out, terrified of the answer.
"Sam was just telling me about you guys hunting together with your dad when you were young,” she said, leaning back in her chair and stretching, her t-shirt riding up to expose her bare midriff. “I’m sorry you lost him—he’d be so proud of you, though, and how far you’ve come.” She smiled, seemingly unaware of the way Dean had tensed, his expression becoming blank on his face.
Cas frowned, his forehead wrinkling. "Is that innuendo?"
As Chuck echoed Eileen's words from earlier, Cas' eyes shot to Dean's face. Was it true? Had Dean loved him back then? If he still loved him, maybe there was a chance they could weather this storm too? All hope of that left Cas the moment he caught sight of Dean's face, distorted in anger.
"But then if you knew every bad thing I'd done, you wouldn't have told me… you wouldn't have said the things you did when the Empty took you. You wouldn't still be looking at me the way that you do."
"It's not about whether or not I want to, Cas. Just play the frickin' game!"
"What's wrong?" Cas' voice had an edge of urgency about it that would have made Dean feel guilty if he wasn't fairly drunk. As it was he just found it adorable that Cas cared enough to worry.
Cas. I sobbed your name until the sun came up, until I could finally pull myself together enough to stand up to go and find Sammy.”
"I haven't known you use people for sex for years. And even before that, it seemed to be quite mutual. I'm not judging you for your sexuality Dean, whatever it is that you define it as, or not - the people you have sex with are all consenting adults."
Seemingly oblivious to Cas shattering in front of him, Dean carried on. "You don't need to kill yourself explaining it to me. I've not lost any sleep over it."
The sound of Cas' laughter ringing in his ears made him momentarily forget how lost he felt, how sad, how lonely. Cas was going to come back to him, and if he could hold onto that he could get through anything.
"Gonna be looking at you like this forever, Cas. I… we need to talk about that. I want to run something by you—not now though. I'm gonna freeze my dick off if we don't get back inside."
Cas looked helplessly over at him.
"I'm going to fuck your mouth," Cas said firmly and decisively, and the words had Dean close to panting. His heart was racing, his cock was throbbing with need, feeling perilously close to release without having even been touched. He'd made all these plans for Cas' first blowjob and it had involved hours of teasing, edging, toys and every fucking trick in the book, but Dean would throw all his plans out of the window just to have Cas fucking his mouth however the fuck he wanted to. Dean's mouth
"Is that Enochian?" Dean asked, his voice still rough.
"You're a freakin' ice cube—no circulation at all. And for the record, in bed your feet are like fucking blocks of ice."
"Mmm," Dean said noncommittally, pulling Cas against his chest. "Come leech my heat."
"I've always tried to be what he wanted, but I've fucked up, Cas. And I'm going to get to Heaven and he's gonna know. And I'll spend Eternity up there with him, being the Dean Winchester I was when we hunted together. And that's not me anymore."
"As hilarious as this is," Sam put his hand up to interrupt them, "Can we maybe talk about Patience's vision? Because I'm feeling really out of the loop here, guys."
"Will you be okay?" Cas looked worried and Dean hated it.
Claire made a disbelieving noise before going back to where Kaia, Alex and Patience were exclaiming over the pretty silver ring on Kaia's finger.
"I've not broken up with anyone. We weren't… how do you even know anything happened?"
Cas picked up the soft, cuddly toy bee and lifted it to his cheek. The fluffy material felt soft and luxurious against his skin. He’d never owned anything like this before—something that had no other purpose except to make him happy. Even Nigel, as loved as he was, had other purposes in life. This toy was beautifully pointless and he was going to cherish it forever.
"Great. Why not?" Dean muttered. "I just love testing out 'might not be pleasant' things. It's my favourite pastime."
*hides*
"I'm sorry, did you say Kate came here yesterday?" Cas shook his head to clear it. "Christmas day, yesterday?"
Cas and he'd just pushed him away, possibly forever. He hadn't eaten anything in hours, but he felt bile rising up in his throat.
what I want?" Cas challenged.
"Pizza and porn?"
"We'll be here for a while, while we recruit and strategize," Balthazar offered with a sigh. "Any time you need a break, you know you're welcome. We've missed you, Castiel."
"Dean, you're grieving—"
“It’s okay. It’s not ideal, and the landlord is really crappy about fixing things. Hence the finger maiming.”
"Yes. But it was a foolish idea. We have far too little sense when it comes to… to that."
What he really should have done was spend a few minutes more in the bathroom to jerk off before getting into bed. But it was too late now, and Dean had a job to do. He was going to soothe Cas to sleep if it damn well killed him. And in all honesty, it just might.
Kate was sitting at the table with several large, leather-bound tomes spread out in front of her, Sam patiently sitting opposite her, answering her questions. In retrospect, it was probably how they should have handled telling Kate earlier, rather than Cas hurling information at her like some demented discus thrower in between flirting with Dean.
Cas' gave him a small smile.
I'm done. That isn't something I get to have now."
"Cas?"
“Like what?”
“Chuck?” suggested Dean through gritted teeth. His knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel tightly while the wind whipped and buffeted Baby. The storm around them had got worse far more quickly than any normal earthly storm ever would have and thunder had started, rolling like an angry God in the skies. Dean swallowed hard. The lightning in the air was making the hair on his arms stand up as it crackled around them.
"Yep," agreed Dean with a nod, his beautiful face passive, entirely expressionless. It gave nothing at all away to Cas, who was desperately scanning his face for any sort of clue to how he felt.
Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away from Cas’. Despite his calm regard, his hands were nervously tearing at his napkin, fingers trembling slightly.
For a single moment Dean was hit by the thought that this couldn't be real, couldn't be happening. He'd thought about this, pictured it so often that the fantasies had become imprinted in his mind, and they'd come to him automatically whenever he was close to coming for
"Dean," Cas moaned, obviously feeling the same way. "I can't… I'm so close."
they were wrong. Cas couldn't have left the area, and would never have allowed himself to be taken by wild beasts. He had to be with the angels he'd been searching for, and they had to be here. What clue was he missing? How could he approach this from another direction, a fresh perspective?
"I never said
"You're going to be very uncomfortable if you're going to be watching it from there."
"You're not an idiot."
The song Dean tried to sing:
“Fancy seeing you here,” Dean drawled in greeting.
Sam's hand was reassuring on his shoulder, but it didn't help refocus his mind. A chant of
, Cas. I'm a monster."
The rising panic in Dean's chest had risen up to his throat and it was choking him. His hands clenched on the steering wheel and he fought for control. He should pull over, he wasn't safe driving like this. But if he did, Cas would know and Cas being Cas, he'd comfort him, when it wasn't Dean who should be being comforted. He didn't deserve that from him.
At that moment Dean's phone buzzed and Sam's name flashed up on the screen.
“Let me?” Cas asked again, his voice barely above a whisper. "Let me put things right."
Sam glared. "I'll get one and use it on you if you don't hand me the blade!"
"You shouldn't have healed me, man," Dean muttered against his hair. Pressing a kiss into it. "That wasn't clever. Do you still have some Grace left?"
"There you are!" Kate gushed. "Dean was missing you!"
He ran past shops, restaurants, women walking their dogs, children on their way to school. He was passing a brightly coloured ice cream parlour when he heard his name being gasped behind him.
Kate didn't seem at all placated. "I did wonder why you never wanted me to meet your family."
Dean smiled goofily at his phone, glad Sam wasn't around to comment on the sappy look on his face. Cas had sent him a brief message the day before but hadn't been able to call him, so Dean had been like a bear with a sore head all day. Eventually Sam had told him he could sit and grump at 'that fucking plant' instead, and stormed home to Eileen.
"You don't want to," Dean told her helpfully. "Trust me."
"Yeah," Dean whispered, swallowing down the lump in his throat. "I remember." Christ, how he remembered.
"Yeah, I know,” he acknowledged anyway. “But I know it would be perfect, Cas."
"Anyhoo, now all the Angels are sitting around in Heaven twiddling their thumbs, or finding creative ways to murder each other over and over again. They need a leader, a purpose,
His voice was trembling now to join in with the rest of him. He was such a fucking mess.
"Dean is not a possession," Cas snarled. "He belongs to
“Sorry, just stretching,” Dean said casually, in direct contrast to the much more intense look in his eyes.
He was screwing some woman in the back of Baby and half way through he opened his eyes and she was actually a corpse, her skin grey and cold. Dream Dean was scrabbling away frantically as she stumbled after him screaming at him, demanding to know why everything he touches turns to ashes.
"So I was meant to fake order lasagne?" Dean asked Cas, dropping into the chair heavily, his phone in his hand.
"It's a very funny series, Dean."
"Well, I don't know if he said it, but thank you," Sam said, watching him chew. "He's been taking a lot of risks…"
"Do you think you'd have me pinned to this wall right now if I didn't trust you? But can you blame me for worrying? This feels really fucking familiar, Cas. If you're going to kill me, then I wish you'd get it over with. I won't even fight it this time."
"Giving me something I can whack you over the head with doesn't sound like your most well thought out idea, little brother."
"Got it?" he asked, feeling oddly embarrassed, despite Cas having seen him naked hundreds of times before.
"And you're overdressed." Dean indicated to Cas' pyjama bottoms like they were a personal affront to him.
"Yes, Dean," Cas agreed darkly. "I'm going to take you so high, you'll be begging to belong to me."
Then Cas’ hand was sliding into the gap in his jeans, touching him with urgent fingers, making Dean swear under his breath. But it wasn’t enough, and Dean lifted his hips, trying to shove his jeans and boxers down his legs in one go, Cas’ body on top of him hindering his progress, until eventually Cas growled and pushed himself up on his knees.
Dean took one last longing look at his boyfriend, wishing Cas would just trust that he wasn't going to leave him, then he moved off through the crowd towards the stage.
Cas tensed, ready to stretch and sit up, to make some comment about how the others would think they'd fallen asleep and they should get back to them.
"Amara!"
"I was integral to Dean and Sam's story at the time. It wasn’t for any kind of personal value that I have myself.” It should have hurt to say it, but Cas was long past thinking he had any value to his creator, beyond being the side character in the twisted story that Chuck had scripted for the Winchester brothers. He was important to the people who mattered, and he was coming to realise that their opinions of him meant far more to him than a ‘father’s’ approval ever would.
There was a silence and Dean rubbed his eyes. He was tired, but he didn't want to sleep.
Cas looked up and their eyes met and held. The pull towards Cas felt like it was actually physical. Cas wet his dry lips and Dean felt the air leave his lungs in a puff of air in response.
Dean’s throat seemed to be closing, his eyes stinging and he let out a shaky breath as he fought against surge after surge of emotion. Cas’ fingers slid through his hair and down his back.
"I'll call you tomorrow."
The laughter faded from Cas’ eyes and Dean frowned, trying to read Cas' face. What had he said wrong?
Claire's sharp eyes narrowed as she watched him.
"Another time."
"This isn't going to be weird, okay?" Dean didn't think he could stand it if Cas went cold on him now.
“She wasn’t evil,” Cas shrugged. “I could see she wasn’t evil when I met her.”
"Open your eyes," he whispered, and Dean immediately obeyed. Cas was on the knife edge, about to tip over and for whatever reason he was stopping himself, just like he did with his sleeping. His Angel needed to learn how to let go.
was the one who had hurt Cas, not the other way around.
who has fought by your side on more occasions than I can remember. I am the
"She keeps touching him!" Dean growled. Cas had repeatedly denied that Kate was trying to get into his pants, and now she was standing, stretching, purposely exposing her midriff in a move so obvious it would have been laughable, if Dean wasn't feeling quite so murderous about it. "She so fucking wants him."
"What about you, Dean? Do you miss that?" Kate asked, licking frosting off her thumb. "The intimacy? The companionship? The romance? The sex?"
Cas' breathing was unsteady, Dean could hear it down the phone. Was he touching himself? The idea turned Dean on so much that he pushed his boxers down his legs, kicking them off and letting his cock spring free.
"I'd really like to." Kate looked genuinely shocked. "That wasn't where I left him. When I went to get you, he was letting some girl paint his face with body paint."
"'And touch me… hold me close don't ever let me go.'"
“Just go with it, Sam. You know there’s no point arguing with him when he gets like this.”
"What? You've seen how I sleep in company a thousand times before. I can't sleep in jeans. I'm sure you'll be able to resist my bare and sexy man legs."
, he told himself, shaking off the melancholy feelings with a physical shake of his head.
“Dean,” Sam said, dawning horror spreading overtaking his features, horror and recrimination evident in his voice. “You… you meant to die? You meant to leave me?”
Sam opened his mouth to speak, but Dean held his hand up to silence him. Staring at Cas like he'd just grown an extra head, he said, “Therapy? You’re getting your head shrunk?”
Cas shook his head. He didn't know. They'd failed. They'd been wrong. Jack really
"And I want a cat," Cas said firmly. "If I don’t kill Nigel, Sam is getting me one."
"Oh, you will, will you?" Dean grinned.
"You didn't leave."
"I've got an electric blanket," Cas said, then blushed hotly. "Not that I… I mean, it's how I stay warm. I'm not suggesting…" He looked helplessly at Dean, willing him to understand that this wasn't some horribly lame and obvious come-on. Not that Dean ever would have objected to a lame and obvious come-on, those were often the best kinds.
For a long moment they just stared at each other, jaws set, fury and pain flashing in their eyes. Clouds gathered overhead, thick, angry, and grey, blocking out the warmth from the sun.
'Ah, yes—the strange, serious man with the very blue eyes. He liked my wine, and my wife liked him! She wouldn't stop telling me how handsome he was! Are you Dean?' The short, bearded man had eyes that twinkled, and Dean had immediately sensed his kind nature.
"Eileen being disgustingly romantic?"
"Yeah, thanks Sammy." Dean shot him a grateful look.
He dug through Cas' underwear drawer again and gratefully pulled a clean pair of boxers over his hips. He got back into bed and waited for Cas to return.
Dean stepped towards Cas, lifting his arms and then he stopped, laughing nervously again.
"They were bad people, Kate," Cas told her gravely. "Using God's name—my name at the time—to persecute people just for loving each other."
"Yeah, yeah. We've talked about this - it's not for me." Dean was tired of explaining. He'd tried with Lisa and it hadn't worked. If it hadn't worked with her it wasn't going to work with anyone.
When they could finally stand up, bend, and move without vomiting, they had played some of the new board games that Eileen had bought for Sam, while the kids played with their presents and lapped up being the centre of attention of so many doting adults. It turned out that Christmas was a hundred times better when there were young people around to be excited over every little thing.
"Why would I bring you back just to kill you weeks down the line?"
"What Eileen and I have," Sam said, his voice shaking in tightly coiled, barely suppressed anger, "is
family." Amara sounded less conciliatory now—not murderous and angry like he wanted her, but definitely closer to it. If Amara took him out, would his soul cease to exist? Would this pain finally be over and done with? He didn't want eternity anymore. Eternity without Cas would be hell, wherever he lived it out.
“You’re late, Rainbow Bright,” he said with false bravado that rang hollow even to his own ears. “Did you lose track of time? Sam tells me I’ve been here for half a century. Really thought you might have dropped in for a visit before now.”
like you were doing it for me. Then you fell from Heaven and lost Jack and your wings. You sacrificed everything
Dean's hands had found their way down the back of Cas' pyjama bottoms and he was pulling Cas hard against him, kneading, massaging, committing the feel of Cas' taut ass in his palms to memory.
"Stop," Dean snapped. "You can shut up or you can get out. Those are your two options."
Dean smelled of freshly applied aftershave and the familiar cedar smelling body wash he’d used ever since Cas had first met him all these years ago. The subtle scent that was so very Dean surrounded Cas and even with his diminished senses, it was doing things to him that no mere smell should.
Maybe after a quick fuck, they'd both have agreed to watch The Witcher with him - he was only on the second episode. He could start over. Maybe he should just have screwed James there and then, on that sofa that had seen more than a little action over the years. What were the chances of anyone finding out, really? He needed to take the edge off this thing he had for Cas and maybe that was the way?
"I'm your son," Jack said simply, and Dean saw a flash in his eyes that was hard and unmoving. The three year old Nephlim that Dean had worried about handling all this, it seemed that Dean didn't need to have worried, this wasn't the same gentle, awkward kid they'd raised. This wasn't the kid who needed velcro shoes because he couldn't tie laces. This was God, and his word was absolute on this.
"I don't think that's it, Cas," Sam argued as kindly as he could. "Why don't you go and talk to him?"
"Not to up the 'gay' in the room even more," Claire announced a few seconds later, "but we wanted to let everyone know that Kaia and I… we're engaged."
"She doesn't trust us," Balthazar explained. "She thinks dear old dad made us overpowered and-"
"I want you inside me, Cas. I want you to fuck me. I
Sam's quizzical look, tinged with concern, was enough to make Dean try to shake it off, the way his soul felt like it was reaching across the room. He tried to quieten the way he wanted,
"This isn't working."
"He always thought he didn't deserve a happily ever after, because he was raised to believe his purpose was to hunt, to protect me and to die a hunter's death. And it's taken a long time, but Dean… he knows he can have that happiness now. His ending could be every bit as nauseatingly happy as mine, and he deserves that, because there is no one as unselfish, kind and brave as my big brother."
"You do know how ridiculous you sound?" Cas asked, exasperated but not sounding angry, which Dean figured was a positive.
"If that's what
“Every day just feels empty,” Dean finally said, his voice thick with tears and muffled by the material of Cas’ coat and jumper. “I can handle pain, I’m used to it. But not this emptiness all the time."
"It was only supposed to be a short term thing. A bit of fun," Dean defended. "We were being ridiculous.
"Sam and Eileen finding each other—my brother finding someone so damn perfect, that was a freakin' miracle. I've never seen him so nervous to go out on a date, or spend quite so long on his hair. What's it called, Sammy? Deep Conditioning?"
we're doing this again!" Dean looked up at Cas, feeling guilt stabbing at his chest. He'd made Cas feel like this and he needed to fix it. He wriggled.
“Well…”
"Will you give Jack back to me?" he croaked suddenly. After all this, she could give him Jack back and they could mourn Cas together. It was the least she could do.
“What is this?” Cas asked, frowning.
"What non-ass related topic would you like to talk about instead?"
life for myself,” Dean growled. “I didn’t think I’d still fucking be alive by this point, so if you’re trying to say this isn’t the life I imagined for myself, Kate, then you're right—no, it isn’t. Because before Cas told me he loved me, I didn’t think I’d have any sort of future at all. And now I want to
"Dean, is it a Poughkeepsie thing?"
Sam threw Dean a pained look. “Alright. Yeah. I’m sorry, Dean. I just need you to know that I’m grateful, okay? It’s not enough. I know it isn’t enough, but I am.”
For some reason this made Dean bristle and he took a steadying breath. He couldn't keep getting pissed every time she mentioned Cas, or Cas was going to get sick of his shit real quick.
"You've probably had too much to drink to drive anyway," Dean observed. “I’ll get you an Uber.”
Cas sighed. "You're right, it isn't. I'm just finding it difficult going from whatever it was we were doing to being -
Cas in Dean's own clothes was probably the sexist thing he'd ever seen, and he'd seen a great many appealing things in his lifetime. Dean knew he was a little possessive over Cas at times - he hated it when Meg, Crowley, waitresses and, well, anyone at all had flirted with his Angel. He wasn't sure what the deal with Kate was, but he disliked her for the possibility that there even was a deal to be had there. But the look of Cas in Dean's clothes, with his just fucked hair, his chin and jaw that were sporting some seriously sexy stubble and Dean's shirt clinging to a body that Dean just wanted to debauch - that was off the scale. Dean's previously flagging boner was back to being fully interested in the situation.
“Turns out my recovery time is zero when you’re naked and on top of me,” Dean shrugged unapologetically. "Go figure."
Under other circumstances, he'd have spent last night drinking in the library with Dean, exchanging stories, relaxed and happy, alcohol warming their bellies.
"Kissing you is like a damn addiction," Dean growled against Cas' mouth, pulling back to yank at his t-shirt, pulling it over Cas' head as Cas raised his arms automatically. "I swear I've thought of nothing else since the very first one. You're such a fucking distraction."
Cas let his hand slide up from Dean's hip, stroking his skin with his thumb, trying to reassure him with each calming stroke.
"Yeah. Okay. That's… that's good."
"Hello Dean. Sam."
"Space," Dean repeated, as if it was everything he'd feared coming true.
“Got it.”
Dean smiled at his phone and pressed the call button.
Now Dean understood at least some of what the issue was, he seemed to be throwing himself into his role with much more enthusiasm than Cas had expected. He was bending closer and closer to Cas' mouth and Cas began to panic that he'd actually gone a step beyond understanding and was now going much too far the other way. This wasn't some sort of 'make out against the lamppost until the police have gone past' type of situation. All he needed Dean to do was shut up about his brief disappearance.
"Assbutt," Cas corrected.
Dean held him for another ten seconds, then loosened his grip. Still not letting go, he guided Cas back to his seat at the table, which Cas was grateful for, as he was feeling very much like he'd just woken up after a very long sleep. Groggy, limbs heavy, he didn't even think about it when Dean reached for his hand under the table and held on tightly.
Dean fucking hated that they had to talk in code, but they'd discussed it the morning Cas had been getting ready to leave, and they'd agreed that there was no way Amara wasn't watching them. Half of Heaven's angels were missing, completely off the grid, and Cas suddenly going on a world tour without Dean—well, she wasn't stupid.
"Dean… have you forgotten we're in a fancy restaurant? What would the staff say?"
Cas squeezed the stripy toothpaste onto his toothbrush and his eyes flicked up to Dean's innocently.
Cas stared at him blankly.
Dean was sitting on his bed, phone in hand, eyebrows raised, his look challenging. He was the most frustrating, infuriating human being that Cas had ever met, and Cas loved him completely.
"No," Dean groaned as Cas' hands slid down his sides, grabbing hold of his hips and pulling them firmly against his own. "But I'll take what I can get."
"Thanks." The towel disappeared for a moment, then was shoved back out of the gap again, a glimpse of Cas' long, thick thigh and the curve of his perfectly rounded ass visible through the gap.
"If only you meant it!"
"Suffocated," Dean finished for him, laughing at the nod he could feel against his chin.
Cas swallowed hard. "I've
"What does Sam actually like?"
isn’t something you have to do? Don’t do this for my sake. It’s not something I need.”
what Cas was doing and it was like an intricate form of torture—he could feel the ridge of Dean's cock hard against his ass, pressing into him with every tiny movement. Cas was hard too, and the chances were that Kate already knew—with the way she was dancing so closely, how could she have missed it? This was far too public a place for Dean to be doing this, and there was no way he couldn't know. There was
He took the bag, trying not to notice how his fingers brushed Dean's as they slid through the little woven rope handle.
Dean's hand slid down to Cas' hip, and he very deliberately slid one single finger underneath Cas' t-shirt to find the bare skin there, just above the waistband of his jeans. Glancing around the room and happy that no one could tell what he was doing, Dean stroked his finger back and forth, barely moving at all, while still moving just enough to make Cas want to groan out loud.
Their hands found each other, and they intertwined, tangled, locked—whatever it was, they weren't coming undone any time soon. Cas clung to him. If this was all he could have, he would hold on to it. He'd never let go.
Just the sound of Cas’ voice had woken up the butterflies in his stomach.
"Yeah?"
At Sam's words, Dean looked over at his brother, panic in his eyes. Who would have guessed that Dean Winchester of all people would be feeling claustrophobic? Cas wondered if it had happened after or because of the creation of the horrific reinforced box he had planned on sinking himself to the bottom of the ocean in. He'd admitted later that he'd had nightmares about that in the past, and who could blame him?
"Why would I be scared?" Cas scoffed, hating the waver in his voice that only served to give him away completely
"He's in a better mood this morning," came the quiet murmur against Dean’s throat.
"Are you saying that my love is cheap and tacky?!" Eileen clutched at her chest dramatically. "How could you?!"
Cas shook his head mutely and Dean sighed.
The pain was worth it. Cas absolutely didn't want to know the answer to Kate's question. Last week? Last month? It didn't matter because Cas didn't have the right to care. Dean had always slept with women, and sometimes men too. Cas knew this and he had accepted it a long time ago. He couldn't have Dean's body as just his to touch, but their connection, their friendship, that wasn't so easily replicated with others for Dean. Their friendship was something between them that Cas could be a little possessive over.
"Really?" he asked in disbelief, taking the clean dish towel that Cas had handed him, dabbing his face and neck with it.
He tried to think through the panic - he couldn't go to his room, that was too close to Dean. He couldn't go to the kitchen to find Sam, Eileen was there and he didn't know her well enough to let her see him like this. He didn't know what he needed, he just wanted this feeling to go away. It was crawling under his skin like something living, rising up inside him until he felt like he was being eaten alive by it. Hot tears were spilling down his cheeks and he burst out of the bunker into the daylight and kept running.
Eileen immediately pulled Kate aside, concern showing on her face, and fell back to talk away from the others.
"Then don't." Dean's voice had cracked, raw and vulnerable. His plea was so full of pain that Cas opened his tired eyes to look at him.
Dean held Cas' hand over the bowl of warm water as had brought over, and using the swabs, he gently cleaned the jagged cut, conscious of Cas watching him as he worked.
"I'll take your coat," Dean found himself saying, playing along despite himself.
"I just feel useless and weak, Cas," Dean confessed, lowering his voice but fully aware that Sam could still hear him. "I'm sittin' around day after day, while you and my parents are doing all this shit, and I'm just waiting here like some fucking delicate flower."
"Do you fancy coming over and watching The Witcher with me?"
of them. There was no shame in who he loved, but even just having his father in the same room as Cas made Dean tense and on edge. Cas was a grown man, and he knew how to handle himself—he didn't need Dean to worry about him and protect him from his father. This wasn't the past, he wasn't a teenager in the throws of his first serious crush. Cas was the man he was going to ask to marry him.
hungry all at the same time?
"I… neither. I'm Sindy, and I don't need to have my future made for me like I'm one half of a moulded plastic pair."
"He said there were no hard feelings!"
Cas understood what Dean wasn't saying, what the elephant in the room was when Dean talked about just the three of them, and as a recent believer in things needing to be said rather than avoided (thanks Doctor Graham), Cas took his turn to clear
"Thank you! Thank you! You're just so kind!"
“Do you truly think so little of me? So little of yourself? Do you think I don’t care about you?” Dean staring at Cas helplessly, looking like he wanted to come over to comfort him, but not quite daring.
The hope, the desperate feeling that he'd been clinging to in his barely awake state dissipated completely. The sun was shining through the tear in the top of his tent, blindingly bright in his eyes, the discomfort grounding him. After thirteen weeks of constant use,  there seemed to be more holes than actual canvas, and only the good weather had stopped him needing to turn back again days ago. As it was, he was almost out of food anyway. He could maybe make it stretch out for another 48 hours, if he could stomach more fish. He was so very tired of eating goddamned fish all the time.
"What is it?" Dean asked tiredly, his voice throaty and deep from lack of sleep. Cas swallowed down the stab of want that had rushed to the surface at the sound of it.
make a mistake.”
"Don't answer," Dean whispered urgently against the material of Cas' shirt, surprising him. "C'mon man, we were just getting somewhere."
"Look, how about later we go for a drive - you, me, and Cas, and we talk?" Dean offered.
do that to me again!" Dean snapped, his eyes flashing. He gripped Cas' shoulders, holding him at arm's length. "Where the
Dean grinned and tipped Cas' face up for a sleepy, slow kiss that had them both smiling against each other's mouths by the end.
of surprise at the sudden force of all of Dean Winchester in his arms at once. His hands cupped Cas’ face, and he gazed at him in wonder as Cas steadied him. All the time Dean had known him, Cas had hidden this from him, tried to disguise how he felt, tried to hide it behind friendship. Now his feelings were laid bare for Dean to see. He was exposed, raw and vulnerable, and just looking at that took Dean’s breath away.
He'd been so tense. Cas had been so tense. They'd both needed this. And when Dean had righted himself, wiping tears from his eyes, Cas's hand was still on his shoulder. Cas seemed to realise at the same time Dean did, and he squeezed once before letting go, and they smiled into each other's eyes for far longer than they should have.
(See the end of the chapter for
Confused, Cas got unsteadily to his feet, leaving the three women to talk alone.
"Shut it, Sam."
Cas didn’t point out that some of his hunting trips weren’t very far off doing just that. Dean already knew and mentioning it wouldn’t help.
Cas immediately stepped back from Dean, lifting his hand to cover his face while he fought to get himself back under control.
Cas didn't answer for a second and then, "You won't be making that offer when you discover that I drool in my sleep. Or snore."
had been what he'd come looking for.
"No, Cas. Don't argue with me - I'm using up my last shred of decency here and if you push I'm going to give in. Just… Get ready for bed and hold me for a bit, yeah?"
"Kate didn't stay. We watched a movie and then I sent her home." Dean took a bite of the egg smothered toast and took a moment to savour it on his tongue. "Then I… uh… got back into bed with you."
you. You told Sam you couldn’t stay sad, thinking about us, that you had to live your life.”
“Nice?” Sam asked, so hopefully that Cas didn't have the heart to be honest with him.
Her eyes widened for a fraction of a second, and then she was gone. Dean fell to the ground like he was a puppet and somebody had cut his strings with one swipe of a blade. The wounded cries of pain that came from his body sounded inhuman, and for several minutes Dean kept thinking over and over that it couldn't have been him, couldn't
"C'mon Cas. This is me, I'm not going to be able to give up hunting entirely. Next time I won't go alone, okay?"
"I'm here for you," Cas promised, leaning close enough that his hot breath tickled Dean's ear and made him shudder involuntarily. "I want to make your life better, not harder. So any choices you make are okay, Dean. I'll understand and support you whatever you need to do, even if that means me stepping back."
Sam shook his head. "Dean won't talk about it."
"This is ridiculous." He cleared his throat and didn't quite meet Cas' eyes. "Stay with me tonight?"
The look in Dean's eyes suggested it was rather more than good citizenship, but Cas dropped his hands and allowed Dean to unbuckle his belt, watching Dean pull it free of his jeans and drop it on top of his sweater.
He dropped another kiss onto Cas’ mouth. Then another. He brought unsteady hands up to Cas' face, holding his cheeks gently as he kissed him again.
"I can direct you to where I bought everything, so you can make up your bed at the Lake House just like this," he offered. "We can add them to the list of things to buy when we go furniture shopping."
"You're the best thing that ever happened to me too. Although to be fair, I don't have entire sports teams to compare you to."
to see any of this. Cas shoved both of his unsteady hands deep into the pockets of his coat.
"I feel like today, I'm more the
Cas looked at him and his lips quirked. "I'm obviously not very sensible then."
"Really?" Cas asked again, the disbelief even more evident now. Dean just knew Cas' eyebrow was raised, his pretty pink lips pouting, those beautiful blue eyes narrowed in suspicion.
Except for that time you were with me." Protectiveness warred with arousal, and Dean experienced an odd mix of wanting to wrap Cas up, making him feel safe and warm, and wanting to press him up against that tiled shower wall and fuck him into next week.
"No, but I'm here to listen if you want to talk about it," came the gentle voice of the Angel who never judged him, who always supported him. If he could talk to anyone, it would be Cas wouldn't it?
Cas’ hands were sliding up Dean’s neck, moving to cup his cheeks, to hold his face gently in both of his hands. Dean wondered if Cas would kiss him, right here, on a road to nowhere with his brother watching, with the world frozen around them. Would Dean let him? Would he kiss him back? Would kissing Cas bring him back to life?
"I know." Dean pressed a kiss to the tip of his finger and then moved on to the next one, this time sliding it further into his hot, wet mouth until Cas' knees buckled and Dean was pressing him into the door to hold him up with his hips.
“I don’t understand,” Sam shouted over the noise of the wind. It was getting louder and louder, to the point where it was hurting his ears, stinging his skin as it whipped past.
"Not even as part of the build up to the main event?"
"Everything go okay?" Jody asked, meeting his eyes across the table. "Sam told us what he could, and you know we'll be there if there's anything at all we can do."
"No. Fuck no, Cas." His voice was hoarse as he hurried to reassure him.  "But if
What the fuck was he doing? His dad hadn’t changed at all. No end-of-life clarity. No remorse. Dean frowned, why had he even thought that would be the case? This was John Winchester he was dealing with. Even death couldn’t change him and he’d been a fucking idiot to think otherwise. Of course he’d be trying to control the narrative of his eldest son’s life behind his back, safe in his narcissistic conviction that he knew better than Dean himself what was good for him. He turned back in disgust, aimed more at himself than his father, for being such a fool as to believe change had even been possible for their family.
Dean looked at the raised, painful looking blisters on Cas' palm. "It's great that Jack can communicate, but I wouldn't want to have an entire conversation with him like that."
Dean ignored that, hating how his heart leapt at the mere mention of Cas' name.
Cas made a pleased sound and Dean smiled.
“Unfortunately all I can do is keep feeding you coffee to get you through it.”
forget what it was like to be inside you-"
"Hey, it wasn't me who thought right now would be a good time to play an impromptu session of truth or dare." Dean leaned back against the counter, pouring himself a glass of wine, as Cas hadn't bothered to get one for him. It actually turned out that before lunch was a perfectly acceptable time to drink wine. Who knew? "I was all for going out and building us a Jack Frost."
"Jesus Christ, Cas."
"Oh, but he's not an angel any more, is he? He's human—or rather, he was—now he's not even that."
Dean choked on the mouthful of beer he'd just taken. He wiped his mouth on his sleeve.
"Yes. But I'm okay, Dean. It's barely bleeding at all now."
Kate hadn't actually been invited, but when she'd texted to ask what they were up to and had invited herself, Cas had given him this pleading look that Dean had realised that however hard he tried, he couldn't resist it. If Cas ever figured out this weakness, Dean knew he would be eternally screwed.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, feeling almost shy about it now. This was ridiculous - he was a grown man. He got out of bed, conscious of what he was concerned might become a permanent boner if Cas kept pulling this sort of shit. He went to the little sink in the corner of his room to brush his teeth.
Dean put out a hand and ran it along the now oil-slicked tiled floor.
Cas picked up on the sixth ring.
Dean lifted his head and took in the girls wine glasses, both almost full to the brim still, condensation collecting in tiny beads on the outside.
to be done.
Four minutes into his self imposed exile, his problems followed him. Literally. Giggling and dragging Dean by the hand, Kate practically dragged Dean into the kitchen, and Cas' eyes narrowed. Was she dragging him in here to kiss him?
"I'll walk you out," Dean said stiffly, following him towards the exit. Cas didn't bother to argue.
The snow ploughs had been busy, all the roads icy, but clear. Paths were salted and slushy, greying as old snow mixed in with the dirt on the ground. While Cas had slept the hours away, the world had been busy, carrying on around them while they were held in a state of stasis in Cas' little apartment.
"I didn't think you were really the score settling type these days, Dean?"
"I'll certainly try not to." His words were squeezed past the lump in his throat.
Only when Cas’s entire body was trembling and thrusting back against his fingers with little helpless jerks, did Dean finally stop, removing his fingers and wiping them heedlessly on his discarded t-shirt, before gently encouraging Cas onto his back again. Dean pulled him up to kiss him thoroughly, noting how different Cas’ kisses were now—languid, messy, nothing held back at all, his mouth opening instantly and so easily under Dean’s that it felt almost like a surrender.
"Do you think Amara can screw with the radio?"
“You’re awake!” He beamed at Cas with such warmth that all Cas’ worries, that heavy feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach, instantly disappeared. Cas grinned back, relief and happiness flooding his body, lifting him up.
"Cas," he groaned quietly, his desperation so evident now that Cas wondered how everyone else in the Bunker didn't feel it. The air pulsed with it. "We… We have to go and find somewhere. Now. No one would notice if we were quick."
"Cas," Dean murmured, affection in his tone for all the words he struggled to actually say. He pulled him in for a hug, wrapping his arms tightly around him, ignoring Kate's none too surreptitious gagging sound nearby.
"That doesn't mean we can't go on a date. Look, tomorrow, assuming I'm back at the motel as normal, we'll meet at 7 your time."
it was heavenly first thing in the morning. For someone who hadn't had a home for most of his childhood, Dean really knew how to create one of his own as an adult. The rapidly changing Lake House was testament to that.
“I think that would be nice,” Cas agreed, and Dean could hear his smile in his voice. “I’ve never experienced any sort of celebration, unless victory celebrations after a battle count."
"Hey." Dean smiled up at Cas. God, he was incredible. Sometimes Dean couldn't believe that this man, this Angel even deigned to speak to him, let alone wanted any part of him.
He pulled out his phone, scrolling for the right number and then waited for the dispatcher to pick up. Kate was going home and if he had his way she would be staying the hell away from them both until she'd got a fucking grip.
"I've done so many things," he said, ignoring the tightness and trying to take in a deep breath. He felt sick. He couldn't do this.
"I’m really glad you called."
The comparison that Dean just made wasn't lost on anyone. Sam's face had broken into the same sort of gooey smile as it did when adverts with tiny kittens in them came on the TV. Dean's expression turned sour.
“We could buy a couple of Waffles to go…”
of real food.”
“He’s my son—our son,” Cas said, refusing to let his voice waver. Talking about Jack was one thing that was never going to hurt less, however much he did it.
wanted for myself?" Like this, Cas sounded almost sober, almost himself, and his words made Dean's heart beat so hard in his chest that he wondered if Kate could hear it from where she sat next to the woefully neglected fruit bowl that held one single, wrinkled pear.
"You'd think that she'd have better things to do, what with running the freaking universe," Dean muttered.
"I know how you feel, buddy," he sighed.
"Yeah," Dean agreed, his breaths coming hard before he'd even started. "Absolutely."
"We can always do this again - we don't have to fit everything into one night." Cas sounded unsure for the first time since they'd started this, insecure even though he was on top of Dean, pinning him down, in control.
Dean deliberately looked down at the guitar in his hands instead of out into the crowd to see his parents reaction. Sam needed to do this, and Dean would deal with whatever consequences came from it, and if needs be, he would protect Sam from them too, in every way possible.
"With interference."
"You know…" Dean started.
Dean swore, helpless to stop the shudder of desperate need that shot through him.
Dean nodded as if this could well be true, and then peered at the newspaper adjacent to Cas' elbow, opened at the job section with various ones circled.
"The tall one? You like him, don't you?"
"He's babysitting me. I've begged him to go, but he keeps changing the date and putting it off, because he seems to think I'm going to fall apart the moment I'm alone."
“Fuck, Dean,” Cas groaned. Dean’s hips had taken up a rhythm of their own, pressing Cas into the bed over and over again, their cocks grinding hard together through denim. They were already intoxicated from Dean’s confessions, lost in each other and barely able to hold themselves together in front of their friends and family—now that they were alone, there was no reason to hold back.
Should he have taken five minutes to shower? Would Cas be interested in doing anything that would need him to be daisy fresh? Probably not, and after the last week without Cas by his side, Dean was pretty sure he was okay with doing nothing more than holding him all night again if that was what Cas wanted. Anything to be close enough so that he could feel Cas' warm body next to his while he fell asleep again. He'd been craving it like some sort of newfound drug.
to me."
"You needed new saucepans anyway."
When Dean came back to himself, Cas was still holding him, still inside him. He was kissing the back of his neck murmuring barely coherent words. Dean caught,
"You don't get it," Dean said, plunging his hands into too hot water to wash the dishes, appreciating the distraction of the sting the water caused as it reached the split skin of his knuckles. "I don't get a happily ever after. I don't get to fall in love and have babies and grow old with… with
"Why are you doing nice things?" Dean sniffed the air suspiciously, trying to decipher the smells he could detect coming from the kitchen.
"Is this why you called me?" came the incredulous tone. "Do you know what time it is?"
Cas choked—on what he wasn't sure. He wasn't eating or drinking anything, but suddenly his own saliva was trying to kill him. He bent over, hands on his knees, coughing and spluttering.
"So you'll come?"
"I should help Alex with setting the table," Cas said. If he stayed, something was going to happen. And if everyone found out about them, in the cold light of day Dean
Cas' lips twitched. "... bare and sexy man legs?"
Why was he terrified?
“She likes you.” Dean observed, hating the jealousy that coursed through him. Kate
"I didn't say…"
“And for Kate. Family in England, kids with the ex.”
"No shit, Sherlock," Dean muttered just a little bitterly.
"I'm surprised Sam hasn't exploded," Cas mused. "Does John mind his words more around him?"
Dean looked at his watch. "Fuck!"
Dean stroked Cas' hair soothingly, before twisting his head to look back at Kate.
"I'm not one for labels, but if you're insisting on one, bisexual pretty much covers it."
creepy, it is to see you in this barely lit bedroom. I mean it's tame when compared to some of the things Gabriel has dragged me into lately, but I truly didn't expect it of you. You don't normally like to share, Cassie."
Another song followed that one and judging by the fact that the lyrics weren't telling him to fuck off, Cas figured that a certain obsessive deity wasn't currently playing DJ. Maybe she was having a celebration of her own up in Heaven as she held Jack hostage up there.
something. This was why he needed to hunt
"Me too, Cas."
. "It’s Dean. This is Dean. He's my family. He's
Cas looked up warily, the dark circles under his eyes more pronounced than they ever had been before. He looked exhausted. "Yes?"
"Cas, chill. It was all a long time ago."
He looked at Dean, who was watching him intently.
"If we get him back-"
"That was the television you heard," Cas said slowly and clearly, willing Dean to understand what he
Dean closed his eyes. "I'm so sorry."
Sam choked.
"Hey Cas," Sam called towards Dean's phone where it lay abandoned on the coffee table. "I'm here in record time, and the food is still warm!"
"Just how kinky do you think I am?" Dean asked with a snort.
They'd stayed longer than the rescue teams had, friendship and duty pushing them to fight against the despondency, to keep searching even when they'd run out of new ideas. But even they had come up empty handed, not able to find a single trace of the magic that Cas had insisted was so powerful that it could cover the signature of an army of angelic insurgents. When witches wanted something to remain hidden, it seemed no one would be able to find it.
"No. Even if he could love me the same way I love him, he's worried about what his parents, and the world in general would say - he was brought up by a homophobic dick of a father. And then there's the issue that he feels like the direction our relationship would go in is already predestined and will end in misery, and he doesn't need more of that."
Cas touching him. Cas moving his hand up and down the length of him, his mouth pressed to his neck, breath coming fast.
"Anything for the jolly green giant?" Dean asked Cas, indicating to his bright green jumper.
Cas ignored him pointedly, shuffling and adjusting his shoulders to get comfortable against the corner of the pillows, as he balanced on the very edge of the bed.
He turned to Cas. "So you were right? It was Amara?"
"Oh we're just dandy," Dean said with a fake half smile. "I'd like a coffee please. Strong. And I wouldn't object if you put a shot or three of whisky in there too."
"But I feel more alive now I'm human than I ever did when I had my wings. My life is short, but I'm determined to make it beautiful, to do things to help people. And… one way or another, once I've got Jack back, I like the idea of having more children, having a family."
"Oh, really? We could test that."
The sky was covered in large, grey-yellow clouds, heavy with snow. Flakes were starting to scatter again, filling up their earlier footprints, erasing them as if they'd never been there at all. This time there was no time to enjoy the view, to look at the blanketed world around them. They walked fast, hand in hand, not speaking, never meeting another person—it was too late, too cold, too snowy for anyone else to be out. Christmas done, they were all tucked up warm in their beds.
"I know, Dean," Cas murmured against his knuckles. "I promise, I know."
He'd have laughed at Cas' impatience if he wasn't feeling exactly the same way. He was almost angry that he had to take valuable seconds wriggling free, but the moment Cas was back on top of him, devouring his mouth, Dean didn't care about anything else.
In the dim orangey glow of the streetlights, nothing remained of the Dominant except the faint impression of shadowy wings burned onto the stone facia of one of the buildings that lined the Alley and, perhaps, a trace of ash on the cobbles although the faint night breeze was already swirling the grey powder away.
“Why are you here?” he asked them.
Despite his tail twitching and flicking with sufficient agitation to make the water swirl in the cave like a miniature whirlpool.
Ash had offered him a Realm Port again, to enable him to simply rejoin the game at a location of his choosing, but Dean had turned him down.  Ash was already helping him more than enough without wasting valuable Ports unnecessarily.  Besides, he figured he could kill a few more of the Mastadoons on his return journey which would give him useful XP towards his next level up.
Dean snorted and rolled his eyes. “God help me from Alphas with ‘man flu’.”
Nick was furious.
And then there were the cartels, such as the Columbians of course, who were as difficult to eradicate as cockroaches. A cartel was like a hydra because for every head cut off, two seemed to appear in its place.
Sam waited until Blake unlocked the door for him and had walked away completely out of sight down the long gloomily lit corridor leading back to the front desk, before muttering under his breath, “I’m not a cat.”
“I do not wish to be lemonade,” Castiel announced, his brow furrowed.
Go now, the stone said.
Which, now he thought about it was insane anyway. The kind of sexual marathons described in the books - the type that he and Dey’n were performing daily for real - weren’t even physically possible for normal physiologies.
His mother had said to him she had always believed him solitary by choice.
“Then would you at least accept an opportunity to get to know the real Dean? Come to dinner with me and Sam and I’ll invite Dean too. Not as an actual blind date. No pressure at all. Just four friends sharing a meal together. Worse case scenario you get a free home cooked meal and some pleasant company.”
“Clearly not,” Castiel agreed disapprovingly, but took the hint and changed the subject entirely.
Charging across the field, directly towards him, was a huge black animal that resembled a cross between a horse, a rampant stag and an armadillo.  The beast had a definite horse-like head and neck, with a lustrous mane, yet it had huge antlers that protruded from the top of its skull, and its body was thick-set like a rhino and plated with thick armour.
She shrugged nonchalantly. “I’ll take the deal,” she said. “Whether or not I help you, well, I’ll see how I feel when a situation arises.” She raised an eyebrow in challenge.
“South of here, down by the Ciscona trench,” the guard replied.
“If you were wearing the hat, you’d get a set bonus,” Loki pointed out archly. “You’re missing out on 10% overall HP.”
Morgue, he spat at himself impatiently. Say it how it is. You’re in a fucking morgue.
incorporate new ideas that were formally inconceivable.”
Piotr and Gabriel exchanged glances and snorted with amusement, then Gabriel proceeded to tell them how everything had gone down.
It couldn’t be possible because at any given time of the day there were at least forty or fifty thousand people online playing Moondoor these days. It was one of the most popular, lucrative games in the world.
”I’m calling Singer myself,” Gabriel said, retrieving his own cell from a pocket and dialling the Galla’s number. “Maybe we can resolve any misunderstandings before they get even worse.”  He let the phone ring out an annoying amount of times before giving up. “No answer.  Fuck. He’s not picking up and the damned thing isn’t even going to voice mail.”
“Bring it on,” Dean retorted, reaching for his own blade.
# The current scenario, though, of FP being required if a Knight wishes to utilize the power of the seeded V.I.’s means that it is unlikely that any Knight other than Dean The Righteous will collect FP at all. Therefore, the maximum power of any current Knight will be 1000, even if they reach Rank 10.#
“Okay,” he said. “Tell me what the fuck you’re talking about.”
Carolus wasn’t even sure which of them he was acting to protect in that moment. His son or his son’s mate.
And his nose, the most important sense of all for a Wolfkin, was filled with the overwhelming scent of petrichor and blood, and silver.
Sam blinked at her uncertainly for a moment, his mind struggling to compute why, if the building was on fire, she looked like she’d just gone for a swim with her clothes on.
“A big enough forfeit to make murder a viable alternative?”

“No. He’s not my
Sam chewed his lower lip. He
”I just wanted to get out of there,” Dean said.  “My wolf was feeling far too tempted to choose door number two.”
“And so I killed him,” Castiel said.
“That would make no fundamental difference, would it?  The current digital individuals would still be ‘dead’ even if their original iterations were recreated. Besides, I believe that ship has sailed, Master Winchester. No human player would wish to play in what they would perceive as a huge step backward in development. Better perhaps to concentrate RRE’s future efforts towards launching its new game Oz.”
“And then you stabbed Dean in the back two minutes later,” Charlie snarled.
“It’s not like that. I merely need to know he’s safe. I find his well being to be my primary motivator at this time.”
”Exactly,” Castiel beamed. “Isn’t it wonderful?”
Sam thought about that, then nodded his acceptance of her point. “Dean has spend his whole life forgiving me the unforgivable,” he agreed, then, realising how bad that sounded, he added some clarification. “Though usually that involves me opening my mouth and inserting my feet rather than any deliberate act on my part.”

“I was told you never answer the door,” the man explained with an amiable smile.
So was a large, shaggy, russet-colored dog of uncertain pedigree. Some mix of retriever and collie he thought, given its thin, long face, though he didn’t know a lot about dogs. Could have been a wolf, for all he knew, though it definitely had more of a Lassie vibe than a Whitefang one. The dog looked pretty young, he thought. It lacked any grey on its muzzle, and its lush coat was surprisingly glossy and unknotted for what was, effectively, a stray.  He felt a fresh surge of irritation at whoever now owned Wethersfield.  These animals, whilst understandably cautious of him as a complete stranger, were clearly not
Sam raised a paw and wiggled it in welcome. “Um, hi, Dean,” he offered weakly.
“What part of he doesn’t answer his door didn’t you understand?”

And adding to that pressure, for the last few months the moon had finally begun to pull upon him. The silvery shine of its pregnant roundness singing a song that thrummed through his veins every month like a thousand hot needles that pierced his flesh and ignited his blood like lava. When the moon was full, his skin itched as though termites were crawling all over him. As though it
“Nice to meet you,” Cain said, offering his hand to Cas. “You’re the one interested in bees, I hear.”
Dexter watched her departure with a soft, fond look on his face. “Little things,” he told Castiel.
trust you, Jimmy, so that’s why it’s cool with me that you need time and it’s also cool if you come tomorrow and just say whatever this was wasn’t ‘true’ after all.”
Still, on a positive note, he had levelled up as a result of the XP gained. At level six, his base HP was 50 points higher and stood now at 600, which meant his 9% reduction represented 54HP, which meant he was actually only 4 points lower in HP than before he fought the first Mastadoon.  And that meant, effectively, that he hadn’t been negatively affected by the fighting at all.
The Oubliette, like the American Alpha-of-All himself, turned out to be all bark and no bite.
He needed to get the hell away from this house and never come back.

“From Bobby?” Dean asked, climbing into the car and seating himself behind the steering wheel before reaching across the dash to retrieve the paper.
,” Dean replied. “
He had just paused in the act of accepting Sam back into his own arms long enough to squeeze Castiel’s left bicep with his right hand; just a brief but significant touch that somehow said more than any mere words could have possibly said.
Even Dey’n seemed to enjoy the nightly spectacle. Castiel suspected the Mariposa welcomed the opportunity to expend a little of the fury built up over more than a decade of repression, the chance to make various Doms pay, if just a little, for the indignities he’d suffered. Dey’n never really hurt the stupid ‘kids’. The odd bruise, now and then an actual broken bone, a couple of times a wound from a smashed bottle.  Dey’n fought swift and dirty and settled the ‘assaults’ with rarely more than a punch or two.
Castiel’s wolf seemed to agree, given the way it started yipping with excitement.
“I always imagined getting naked in this car with you,” Cas quipped. “But this wasn’t exactly the scenario I had in mind.”
Nick had a point, Cain knew.  He probably should have kept his host more interested in staying in-game by porting to kill a Knight or two to pass the time, maybe, but it would have been an otherwise pointless exercise since the Knights still all had multiple lives to waste
“So what exactly do you mean by ‘genuine’ Subplex?” Dean queried.
wall was falling too, and then another and another, falling like dominoes as the wolves scrambled and leaped and fled through a deadly rain of jagged rock shards.
Disregarding his blushing, stammering embarrassment, the primary outcome of those conversations was the discovery that he was the only person who had experienced a ‘glitch’ when using the Gen 9 immersion rig.  He was, however, the only person in the trial who was using a bespoke avatar rather than a generic one. That at least made sense since he doubted they’d had access to the finances to procure one.
“As it is above, so it is below,” Castiel intoned. “Since our minds have merged, we now exist together in whichever reality we are occupying. However, my communication with you in my world is problematic at the moment. Hence the need to converse with you now.”
As he swam eastwards, and the waters became even shallower and warmer, he sometimes even ventured far closer to shore where he could scoop up crabs and mussels and even oysters on occasion.
Despite Missouri’s blunt statement that the Hunters were intent on moving him regardless of whether or not he was well enough to travel, it was very quickly obvious that the decision hadn’t been taken lightly because all the Mer were as careful as possible to ensure his comfort for the journey. There appeared to be no malice in any of them and all seemed genuinely regretful that their insistence on moving him might cause him some unavoidable suffering. The two Mer appointed to pull him through the water, one on each side of him to keep him steady on the pallet a Mer named Ash had constructed, were polite and cheerful, even if their speech was a little rough around the edges, and both assured him they had willingly volunteered for the task.
“Oops,” he said, reaching for the handkerchief in his lapel pocket and using it to wipe the gore off his face.

was the direct fruit of Thatcher’s loins or, more precisely, her 1980 Right To Buy legislation.
So instead of trying to drown out the voice that was telling Nick that life wasn’t worth living, that he’d be better off if he never woke again, that his wife and son were waiting for him to join them, that he was probably out of a job now he had attacked his boss in-game, that the dealer he’d bought his coke off was already threatening to break both his legs for an outstanding debt and would definitely do the job if Nick found himself unemployed and broke, Cain jumped into position next to the voice and added his voice to the chorus.
It’s all do this, do that, like I’m some kind of trained monkey.”
Which was, belatedly, the moment he remembered that ‘red’ was the color that indicated ‘okay’ on Tsaluna.
"And memories," Dean said quietly. "Bad, BAD memories. For both of us," and he wasn't talking about Sam.
Dean and Sam both turned guiltily to face Castiel, who had followed them out of the door.
Still, he could hear the sound of a
But the file…
“Looks like a good day to die,” he muttered, and cast the spell to conceal Castiel and his troops from immediate view.
The pain was agonizing.
“Like a violin,” Ash agreed.
"Analogies are imprecise tools," the Archivist said, "but imagine that Loki is a weed, with ephemeral roots, able to just blow away in a strong storm. Castiel has planted himself like a flower, his roots reaching just deeply enough to anchor into your body to work the miracle of his healing. But were he to merge with you
digital. It’s less of a hero complex and more of a messianic one, really.”
But he was no longer the bondmate of the Subplex named Dey’n.
So now Samuel’s heir, Sam, was also in the infirmary.
“Can I?” Castiel said, the words sharp, biting, forced through clenched teeth so they emerged more angry than polite as he reached towards the volume button.
But, thanks to her inferior rig, not totally debilitating.
“And that’s a big fat no,” Sam snorted. “Sure you can use my 19 levels remotely, but what about the rest of me? I’ll still be a level 172 fighter at your back. You'll probably need all the help you can get.”
“Not surprised,” Sam muttered, making a deliberate retching motion at the thought of ‘Emmett’ dressed up as Frank-N-Furter.
“And now?” Cas interrupts, managing to shake off his shock for a moment.
Cas picks up his angel blade, stashing it in his coat. “Let’s go.”
Dad nods, avoiding my gaze. “You two seem...close...”
“Really?” I ask cautiously.
“Dean,” Gabriel greets. “Are you alright?”
“Hey Cas?”
"What do you mean I can't be there?" Sam asks.
Dean steps aside to let him into the apartment, and Cas nearly tackles him to the ground, throwing his arms around Dean’s neck and holding on tightly as he sobs into Dean’s chest. “I’m sorry too,” Dean answers, starting to wrap his arms around him and freezing when he sees the bright red streaks staining the entire back of his shirt. His heart clenches when he realizes that it’s blood, and a lot of it. “Jesus Cas, what happened?”
Dean chuckles. “Well let’s get you a break then. I’m sort of fond of your eyes being in your head.”
“I love you.”
Dean stares at him for a long moment, then starts to laugh. “You have some timing, you know that?” he gets out through his giggles.
“It seems you’ve decided that for yourself,” Castiel answered, unable to keep the venom out of his voice.
“That was never it,” Dean said softly. “The problem was...I loved you. I loved you probably more than I’ve ever loved anyone, and I...I don’t deserve you. I was scared, and trying to protect myself...and I didn’t even realize how much I was hurting you in the process. I know you don’t have any reason to forgive me, or even believe me, after the way I’ve treated you... but I...I can show you. Read my mind, and I’ll prove to you that I’m not lying.”
Cas nods thoughtfully. “That’s fair. Okay. What was the second thing?”
He chuckles, shaking his head. “You started it jerk.”
I nod, hugging him closer. “Are you sure that you’re ready to open up that can of worms? If it goes bad, I can imagine his reaction might not be...civil. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
Woohoo! I dunno, I think baby Dean would be cute. Remember to review if you liked it! I love to hear from you :D
“How’s he doing?” he whispers.
“You don’t have to ask, Cas. But I’ll do you one better. Do you trust me?”
“Meg, guess what!” Ben shouted when she walked through the door after breakfast.
“Nothing,” he replies. “I think I might be having a heart attack.”
Cas makes an interested hum, considering it. “When you say your colleagues, I take it you don’t mean mechanics.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, raising an eyebrow. Of all the places he thought that sentence might finish, this hadn’t been on the list. “Why? Well, because, it...it feels good.” He knew he was quickly turning red, and he looked everywhere in the room except at Cas. “I mean, not that I...that’s just kinda...why humans do the whole...sex thing.”
Dean nodded, biting his lip for a moment. “You know, I...I don’t think it hit me before that moment, how much it mattered. I got so used to thinking...there’s no way, you know? That kind of life...it wasn’t for me. It couldn’t be. But...I think I was just scared. To admit it to myself, or to other people. But just for a minute, I saw what things could have been like, if I’d just...been braver.”
I can't help it, I love me some sexytimes. Remember to review!
Cas nods automatically, then pauses. “Why?”
Dean chuckles. “Yeah. I guess I was still pretty deep into my flashback when he got to me, and I hit him pretty hard by accident. But he didn’t even really seem to notice. So that’s when I decided to trust him. He was so concerned, and he made me feel safe. Besides, I kinda owed him that much after I hit him in the face and he didn’t get mad. But I didn’t really know all of that until after, when I saw the tape.”
“Why wouldn’t I?” Cas asks curiously.
To his surprise, Dean nods knowingly. “I understand. A lot of people turn to submission for that reason. They can’t let go in their everyday lives, because they’re afraid of what will happen if they do. But giving control to someone else gives them a certain level of security. They can relax because someone else is taking care of everything. Everybody needs to let go sometimes. It’s freeing, isn’t it?”
Cas smiles. “Yes, Dean. I don’t know how you did it, but this was…exactly what I needed. Thank you.”
He nods. "Indeed you did."
Dean watches him go for a moment before turning back to the trunk. He picks up the empty M&M bag, smiling at it. “I’ve had it for years,” he explains when he notices me looking. “It’s from the one the first hunts Sammy and I did together after I got him from school. It was a Wendigo. We went out looking for it, and the thing nabbed me, but I left a trail of these things for him to find me.” He continues going through what’s left in the trunk, showing me old pictures of the two of them as children and explaining the significance of all of the objects that don’t seem to have a use.
“Hmm?” Cas replies, not taking his gaze off the window.
“He’s right,” Ezekiel interjects. “Everyone is scared the first time. But a lot of people can’t relax enough to enjoy it at all. You did very well, especially considering how nervous you were. What were you thinking about?”
It’s quiet again as he watches the older man make eggs and bacon, humming softly to himself. Finally, Cas takes a deep breath. “Hey, Benny?” he murmurs. The other man turns. “I just…I’m really sorry about yesterday. I know the way I acted was…rude, to say the least. I have some issues, I guess, and hearing about your relationship with Dean might have stirred them a little. It was uncalled for. I’m sorry.”
I nod again, quickly adding “Yes Sir,” in response to his raised eyebrow.
“Yeah, I gotcha, it’s okay,” Dean murmured, pulling back just enough to let the graceless angel see his face, stroking his cheek lightly. “You alright?”
Cas pushes at his hip until he turn over, leaning forward to kiss him again. “You’re sure?” he asks, softer. “I’ve never really…”
Love,
Dean looks at him warily, but nods, and Cas makes a mental note to ask him about it later. “You sure you’re okay?” he asks, lightly brushing Cas’ hair back.
Sam laughs, shrugging and offering Gabe a bite of his cinnamon roll. “I’m okay with that.”
I smile, kissing the crown of his head softly. “You are good at it, Dean, though I’d hardly say it’s the only thing. But tell me this. When you’re busy taking care of everyone else, who is taking care of you?”
He holds up the glass, and Cas takes it eagerly, draining it before looking up at him. “Then what?” he asks hesitantly.
Gabriel laughs. “We did. His name’s on the door, isn’t it?”
They ended up laid out on their sides, soft breaths mingling across the single pillow they shared. “I can’t believe this is real,” Dean murmured after a while. “I’ve...I’ve wanted this for so long, it feels like a dream.”
“Jesus fucking Christ…” Dean moans, running the fingers of his free hand lightly around Cas’ rim and chuckling as the other man squirms. “Holy shit…took it like a champ, didn’t you? Got my whole hand in that greedy hole.” He experiments, carefully unfurling his fingers and then slowly clenching them into a fist. Cas shouts and shudders again. Despite his earlier reservations and his determination to do this for Cas’ pleasure, he finds that he likes it, the rush of control curling hot around his spine. “Fuck Cas, you’re so fucking sexy like this…”
Cas nods, rubbing his back gently. “I’m sure we’ll manage.”
I can’t help but smile, and I press a soft kiss to the back of his neck as my fingers dig into the tense muscles of his lower back. I’m rewarded with a muffled groan as they release. “That’s it,” I murmur into his skin. “Just relax for me, sweetheart.” I can feel him fighting it for a minute, but as my fingers slide further up his body he quickly gives in to the gentle pressure. When I near his shoulder blades he tenses slightly, and I feel the shake of his breath as I softly kiss the spots where his wings would be. “You’re so incredible, Cas,” I say softly. “Wings or no wings. And I’m going to show you that.”
I nod, watching the soft rise and fall of Dean’s chest for a moment before looking up and finding Sam watching us. “What?”
He nods thoughtfully. “Okay, I think we can fix that. First let’s get you off the floor. Do you think you can sit up, or do you want some help?”
good boy,” I add, gasping as he tugs again. “All spread out for you, waiting for you to take me…”
He smirks. "You'll know." He reaches out, ruffling our hair. "Alright boys, this is where I leave you. Make good choices."
I take a breath, steeling myself for his anger. “Cas? What about him?”
“Aww, but it’s fun getting distracted,” I laugh, hugging him closer. “But I guess you’re right, we should be heading back before it’s too late. Sam’s probably real bored without us.”
Cas purrs, spreading him wider and happily licking him open. Dean mewls and curses when the angel’s tongue presses into him, rocking his hips back slightly. “That’s my good boy,” Cas praises, slowly pressing a finger into him and chuckling at his low moan. “Feels so good to give yourself up to me, doesn’t it? To let go and just feel...” Dean lets out some sort of garbled agreement, and Cas knows that he’s already started to drift, his body going soft and pliant under the angel’s hands. It always amazes the angel a little bit, how easily the human submits to him these days. It was a long road for the both of them, but it had been well worth the effort to witness the beautiful creature that emerged when Dean gave up his heavily guarded control. He trusted the angel, that much Cas was certain of, maybe more than he’d ever trusted anyone. Cas hums, landing a soft kiss on Dean’s left ass cheek as he presses a second finger into his willing body. “Think I want to open you up nice and slow today,” he decides. “You know how much I love the way your body takes me. How many fingers do you think you can take, Dean? Four, five? Maybe my whole hand?”
“Well next time maybe you should tell me that
He frowns. “Isn’t that a fun fact of the day? It’s kind of sad, actually.”
Dean frowned slightly, and Cas watched in slow motion as his hand rose to settle on the angel’s cheek, carefully wiping away a stray tear he hadn’t realized was there. The pain seared through him again, and he made a motion somewhere between a flinch and a shudder, trying to pull away and lean in all at once. “Please...” he heard himself whimper. “It hurts...”
I nod, holding him securely against me. “I know, Dean,” I murmur, kissing his forehead softly. “You’re allowed to be scared. I’ve got you.”
Remember to review! It makes me happy :D
“It’s simple really,” he replies. “You were experiencing an emotional release along with a physical one. You have nothing to apologize for. That’s sort of the whole point.”
So not to spoil anything, but there mayyyyy be some drama coming next chapter >:) stay tuned!
“Definitely,” Dean answered. “Really, never in my life have I managed to come without a hand on my dick at the very least. You’re perfect.”
“How did I know you were going to ask that?” Dean chuckles. “You two seemed to hit it off.”
I consider it for a moment, nodding. “Okay. But later. Now I’m tired.”
Cas takes a minute to compose himself, taking a deep breath. “I mean, it was a problem, but not one he knew about. Gabriel is extremely concerned with the fact that I’ve never…done things. With anyone, before. I think that’s why he asked you here.”
I think about it for a moment. “Your father, I assume?”
“I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t...you weren’t supposed to hear that...”
“Oh, come on Dean,” Gabe smirks. “Are you telling me you and Cassie here sat around like good Christian girls waiting for marriage while we were gone?”
I smile. “Alright. Let’s take a tour then.” And so we chase the sunset until we overtake the light, and the darkness once again consumes the earth below. I watch Dean closely as we fly, wanting to commit everything to memory. He looks younger now, the boyish wonder taking over his face, and I can’t help but smile when he closes his eyes, spreading his arms out to either side as the wind rushes through his fingers. I press a soft kiss into his hair as I slowly lower us back to the ground in front of the bunker. “Well?”
I sigh, hugging him tighter. “I love you.”
Gabriel sighs. “Alright, look. I know we don’t have the best relationship, but consider this a peace offering. The ringleader of your merry band of kidnappers is all trussed up down there for you.”
I consider it for a moment, smiling at him. “Actually? A lot better. Thank you.” He returns the smile, nodding. I pause for a moment, frowning at the fuzzy memory. “Who were you talking to this morning?”
He shrugs. “I guess we’ll just put them in bed with us for now. Hopefully they won’t be kids for more than a few days.” Once Dean is asleep I carry him down the hall to the bedroom, carefully tucking him in. He snuggles closer to the stuffed elephant, and I smile, watching him sleep peacefully for a moment before returning to find Sam already researching. We read through books, trying to find some mention of a de-aging spell, but it’s not long before we’re both yawning.
“Right now? Here?” I chuckle. “I may not be the best at romance, but I’m better than that. We’ve waited this long. We can wait until we get somewhere more suitable.”
Cas nodded, slowly walking closer and taking him by the shoulders, turning him away from the mirror. “Stay right there. I’ll be right back.” He headed back into the bedroom for a moment, returning with his laptop to find Dean in the same place. He dug in the medicine cabinet for a moment, coming back with a tube of cream, which he started carefully spreading along Dean’s arm and neck, ignoring his puzzled looks. “I know it’s frustrating,” he murmured. “You’ve worked really hard at getting better, and I know it’s hard to not see those results yet. But you have changed, Dean. You’ve gotten so much better.” He glanced to the laptop warily, and Cas smiled, turning him around to face the mirror again. “If you don’t believe me, I’ll show you. Look.” He pulled up a picture, turning it around so Dean could see it in the mirror. It was an early one, Dean in the barn, yellowing bruises still marking his face. Too skinny, his bones stuck out at odd angles, and he still stood hunched over. “Charlie took this one of the first days you were here. Look at how different you look now. Look at the way you stand. I know you feel like you’re not getting anywhere, but that’s a big difference.”
“Not exactly,” I explain. “You were pretty out of it when Gabriel found us. He knocked you out so you wouldn’t feel anything.”
“It just means that you don’t have to do everything alone anymore,” I remind him gently. “That’s all. And it will calm soon. For now, let’s enjoy our vacation.”
Dean hesitated, his hands fidgeting anxiously for a moment before he shoved them into his pockets. “I...I think maybe there’s been...a miscommunication here.”
He chuckles. “I’m glad to hear that. I think I’m lucky too. Now, eat up. You’ll need it.” He gives me a wink before diving into his own plate.
Dean smiled, pink staining his cheeks for a moment. “Well, you know, I’ve done the friends with benefits thing before...but I was kinda thinking maybe it’s time to try something new. Maybe we could...give all that girly shit a try...hand holding, and...going to dinners, just the two of us...maybe even cuddling, as long as you don’t tell Sam. Look, Cas, I...I may not be real good at this, but...you’re important to me. Like really important, and...if you were willing to put up with my stupid ass...I’d really like to try...ya know, this whole...relationship shebang...It’s kind of a new thing for me, and I’ll probably be kinda shitty at it, but...you’re worth learning some new tricks for.”
“I know.” He chuckles again. “You’ll just have to try really hard, or things around here are going to get a little awkward.”
Dean scowls at him. “Asshole.” Sam chuckles from his chair, glancing away from the movie on TV. Dean huffs and shifts a little, adjusting his feet on the coffee table. When the nice feeling of his fingers in my hair stops I glance up at him from where my head rests in his lap until he smiles and continues his absent stroking. “As I was
He groans as I squeeze around him lightly. “Not enough…”
Love,
When they get back into the car, Dean turns it on and starts driving before glancing over at Cas. “Okay. What’s going on?”
He takes in the information, his expression and behavior more honest than I’ve ever seen, his tough façade cracked wide open by his panic. He truly has no idea what’s happening or what to do next, which is rare for him, and it’s left him unable to use his usual defenses. He leans into my chest heavily, not fighting my comfort like usual, and his wings press close, clearly asking for guidance. “What kind of energy transfer?”
I shrug. “Well I can’t say for sure, being that I haven’t felt it from your perspective. But considering your reaction, I assume so.”
I realize that I’ve been mumbling incoherently for a while, a mixture of pleas and whines that stops when I feel a lubed finger rubbing lightly over my hole. He kisses my thigh softly as it smoothly slides in. He moves slowly, making sure each movement drags over my prostate, and my feverish mumbling starts up again without my permission. “Oh, fuck…please, please…fuckfuckfuck…”
He pauses for a moment.
Dean chuckles at the blush that spreads over Cas’ cheeks, kissing him softly. “What are you embarrassed about? It’s just me here. I’m the one who did it, remember? I had my hand inside your body yesterday. You’re not going to tell me anything I don’t know.” He smirks. “Besides, if I didn’t already know you liked being spanked, your moaning usually gives it away.”
“Yes, we are,” Cas chuckled, tugging him into a kiss. “You’re stuck with me now. Forever.”
I nod, sighing. “God, I’m so sorry,” I mumble. “I didn’t mean to explode on you like that. I don’t know where all that came from. I didn’t even remember some of it until it was coming out of my mouth.”
Cas shrugs. “Yeah, I know, but you’re still upset. You’re hovering. That’s what you do when you’re scared. I’m okay, Dean.”
Gabriel chuckles, nodding. “It’s one of my better qualities, actually…”
Sam hummed thoughtfully, biting his lip. “I’m gonna make some calls, see what I can find out. You two keep looking.”
I let out a breath, slightly annoyed that he makes so much sense. “I know. I know you’re right. But I just…it freaks me out, okay? What if he doesn’t understand?”
“Sorry, I was just talking with Gabe for a minute.”
“You don’t have to apologize,” Cas chuckled. “You’ve been through a lot, I’d imagine. I’d be worried if you weren’t sleeping more than usual. You can head up to bed if you’d like. I have to finish some paperwork, so I’ll be in my office for a little while, but I’ll leave the door open, so feel free to come in if you need anything.”
Dean nodded slightly, biting his lip. “So...what do we do now?”
He went red, glancing away. “I sort of…I mean, I think I…love you,” Dean mumbled, squirming slightly.
Hello my lovelies! I am so very sorry for taking so long on this one. Things have been busy with finals and the holidays and my upcoming trip to Ecuador, but I wanted to make sure you got a Christmas present, even if it's a little late. So please accept this porn as a token of my appreciation. Enjoy!
I feel myself blush a little. “Um…that would be correct.”
He picks up a shiny silver dagger, handing it to Cas, who draws it across his palm, letting the blood drip into a bowl. Gabriel wipes the blade before handing it to me, waiting until I follow. I watch curiously as he adds some other unfamiliar ingredients, murmuring in Enochian as he stirs. He hands the bowl to Cas, who smiles, dipping his fingers into the red paste and starting to paint symbols onto my chest, being careful around the fresh ink. "What does it mean?" I ask him softly.
I wait for Sam to leave before turning to the miserable-looking angel huddled beside me. He’s thinking, and a little crease forms between his eyebrows. “Hey, what’s wrong?” I ask.
"Do what?" He asks curiously. "Why did I let you let go? Be honest with yourself, and with me?"
I gently wipe his face as he nods. "Yes. It's not bad."
Dean hesitates, taking in Cas’ questioning expression for a moment before taking a deep breath. He settles right next to the angel on the couch, curling up against him and taking his hand, in full view of his brother.
“You act like I’m some blushing virgin or something,” he chuckles. “Like we’ve never done this before.” I grin at him for a minute, and his smile falters. “Wait…is there something you know that I don’t?”
I nudge him, but he doesn’t even blink, and he’s starting to turn blue. As a last-ditch effort, I reach out and slap him hard. He gasps, his breath coming out in a hoarse whisper. “Karael.” He jumps up, his chair clattering to the floor, and begins mumbling to himself in Enochian.
“I know, I will. Just…not yet. I kinda just want to relax with you for a while.”
Benny nods. “Alright. Then why don’t you come with me over to that side of the room, and we’ll see what we can do about that?”

I frown, glancing over my shoulder at him. “What are you proposing?”
I nod, thinking about it. “I may have an idea. It’s worth a shot.” Just then, Dean returns, avoiding all eye contact as he storms down the hall, slamming the bedroom door behind him. “I’d better get started.”
Dean smiled softly, biting his lip for a moment. “Sweet dreams, Cas.”
He shrugs. “It’s a good way to transition, or so I read. That way if I want to scene or you do, you can just say it and we’ll both know what it means.”
Sam nods, lightly patting my shoulder. “That’s probably a good idea. You don’t want to push it too much. I learned that the hard way.”
“You put toothpaste on my cock?”
I frown. “When did you do that?” I ask.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, everything is okay. How are you holding up?” Dean asks, carefully sitting beside him.
“I’m glad you like it,” Dean smiles. Cas just hums in response, closing his eyes again. He feels the hand at his back slide slowly over the curve of his ass to the back of his thigh, pulling it to rest over Dean’s before gently kneading the muscles. He moans softly into the pillow, hearing Dean chuckle. “Right there?” He nods, sighing softly as Dean captures his lips again, letting him guide the slow, sweet kiss. He whimpers as Dean’s teeth tug lightly at his bottom lip.
“Of course they did,” Dean assures him. “This wasn’t about impressing anyone. They’d all already accepted you. They just wanted to meet you in person. They may have been begging me to bring you along for months now.”
He smiles. “My mother was kind of obsessed with them. We had them everywhere in the house growing up.”
He saw Sam pushing through the crowd toward them, and swallowed back the urge to vomit as his eyes fell to the paint on Dean’s cheek. But Sam just smiled. “Well, don’t you two look festive?” He turned his head up the street toward the louder music, which is when Dean noticed that Sam seemed to have found the face painter as well, the pink, yellow, and blue bars standing out against his skin. He blushed when he noticed Dean’s eyes on the paint, giving him a small shrug.
“Love you too,” I murmur, kissing his head.
“It is a big deal!” Dean insisted. “It’s weird, and creepy, and they have no right to assume-”
Oh hey! It's me again!
“Christ, Cas!” he moans, his grip tightening.
I frown at that. “So he was here last night when I was freaking out?”
“Well, I…honestly don’t know. Whatever they did had to be bad to mess him up like this. Did you see anything strange while you were cleaning him up?”
He scribbles.
Dean chuckles. “A story about what?”
Gabriel grins at them. “Well, I see he hasn’t had a complete conniption yet. Hopefully we can change that.”
He laughs. “Yes, I’m aware. You enjoy being difficult when it comes to taking care of yourself.”
Cas sniffs, nodding and shakily standing up. “Yeah, I’m fine. Thank you. I’m really sorry.”
I chuckle. “Sure. What would you like to see?”
Dean smiled, nuzzling against his chest. “Really? Huh.” The timeline of his first few weeks after escaping were still muddy in his brain, which Meg thought was probably because of the lingering side effects of the drugs, and all the stress, but the season seemed right, at least. “Well, happy anniversary to me. I hope you know you’ve absolutely ruined me for anyone else. It’s entirely your fault.”
I smile, pulling him closer. “Alright. I’ll try to be gentle.” He nods gratefully, resting his head against my shoulder as I carefully comb through the feathers, clearing the debris and apologizing when he hisses in pain. “Okay, last one,” I murmur, gently pulling a twig fragment out. He flinches, but sighs in relief when I run my fingers through the now clean feathers. “Better?”
Dean nods reluctantly, casting his tie one last glare before grabbing the keys to the Impala and driving to the café. He fidgets nervously with the steering wheel, tapping on it until Cas has to reach over and stop him. “Dean, take a breath.”
“You don’t have to go back?” I ask.
Sam and Gabriel join us, Sam looking rather more damp than the last time I saw him. He glances over at Dean, smiling a little. “You know, of all the spells we’ve had put on us, this is probably the least bad one.”
“Do you really…miss it? That life?”
“You need rest,” he murmurs. “Ready to try getting some sleep again?”
The angel gives a slight smile, amused at his worrying. “Everything is fine, Dean. It’s just that housing Lucifer has weakened my vessel somewhat, and healing has been slow with everything that came after. It’s only temporary. Don’t worry.”
“Oh, I see. You mean you’re more vulnerable like this? Helpless? Because you couldn’t move enough to take control back if you needed to?”
He shrugs. “I guess I just figured you and Dean had your own stuff going on. I didn’t want to be in the way.”
Eileen hummed, biting her lip. “I might have one...but you’re not gonna like it. The Empty is only for angels and demons, right?”
He nods, looking around at the piles of books scattered around the table and the cup of cold coffee in front of the open book, frowning. “Have you been up all night?” he asks disapprovingly.
I hesitate, biting my lip. “I don’t…I’m not…that. I’m…so much more trouble than I’m worth, Cas. I’m…moody and stubborn and useless and I can’t talk about important shit. I definitely don’t deserve you. I can’t even take a compliment without being halfway to a panic attack…”
He pauses for a moment. “You believe that?” he asks finally.
“Karael was an angel whose job it was to watch demon activity and prevent it from getting…out of hand. He had a certain influence over them.”
“Cas, look at me,” Dean murmurs. He waits patiently until Cas glances up. “I am not at all mad at you. Yes, you made some bad decisions, and I’m sorry that you got hurt because of them. But I understand why you did what you did. Hell, I’ve done what you did. You were angry and upset. I know that. I’m the king of making bad decisions out of anger, remember? I wish you hadn’t gotten hurt so badly for yours, but I’m glad that you came to me when you needed help. I could never be mad at you for something like that.”
I nod, kissing the top of his head. “Okay. Just promise me you’ll tell me if you start to freak out, alright?”
Dean shook his head again, trying to choke out words in between gasps. “Ca…can’t…I can’t…” he whimpered out.
“No it’s n-not!” Dean insisted, voice wavering as he choked back tears. “I l-love you, Cas...I-I’ve loved you for years, and you d-died thinking I didn’t, and I fucked it all up...”
I hesitate. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Dean glances over at him, noticing the anxiety creeping into his expression. “You’re thinking too much,” he answers. “I promised we wouldn’t do anything you don’t want to. Some people like to have an audience. Other people don’t. It’s just personal preference. You’ll see. Besides, we’re not here for that tonight. There’s also private rooms upstairs, and specialized rooms for different kinds of play that are public, but smaller. We’ll be heading to one of the private rooms once our friends are here.”
“It’s fine, honey. You get me presents all the time,” I assure him. “Usually of the kinky variety. Which, believe me, I enjoy very much.” He snorts, looking curiously towards the second box. “Go ahead. Open it.”
It’s past midnight, and with Cas gone for a few days to work on his angel squad business, I really don’t have anything better to do than sleep. At least that was the plan, until the thunderstorm of the century showed up outside our door. Every time I got close to sleep, there was another loud crack of thunder to wake me right up. When the phone rings, I’m almost thankful for the distraction. I look at the number for a moment, frowning. “Cas?” I answer. “You okay?”
Hael grins, one finger hooked in the back of his collar. “That’s because no one can pronounce your name, pet. Besides, you’re so adorable, you needed a cute name to go with it!” she turns to look at Cas, eyes shining with mirth. “Alfie is just excited he’s not the newest anymore.”
I shrug, kissing his cheek softly. “Maybe Gabriel will know what’s going on. But I don’t see it being anything dangerous.”
“Fuck!” he chokes out, fists clenching in the sheets. “Cas…baby, please…”
So that was it. Dean could reasonably justify Cas wanting to choose him, to love him, if he stayed human. But as an angel...as an angel, he’d have options. There was no way Dean could possibly measure up. There was no Big Bad, no apocalypse, no major threat keeping him here anymore. Once he was powered up again, there was no logical reason for Cas to choose to stay. He’d change his mind, and he’d leave again, and then Dean would be alone. And sure, maybe that’s what he’d always believed would happen. It was one of the biggest reasons he’d never admitted his feelings for the angel. But the thought still hurt more than he’d like to admit. It was worse now that he’d allowed himself to hope he might have been wrong. For a moment he considered going back out there and heading this off, telling the angel he’d changed his mind and ending this before it really began. But instead he forced himself to take a deep breath, gripping the edges of the sink tightly.
Cas smiles, leaning down to kiss me softly. "I know, Dean. It's alright. Just know you have nothing to be afraid of, alright? I'm not going anywhere." I nod, and he hugs me tighter for a moment. "So, Gabriel had to get a few things, but he should be back soon. We don't have to do it until you're ready."
Dean nods. “Okay. Can I ask why?”

After some cautious investigation, Castiel devised a way of curling his body between the anchor and the hull, in a way that his body was held securely against the ship as it travelled. It wasn’t a perfect place for him to sleep but he decided it was still considerably safer than any other alternative he might find in the open ocean. Plus, it had the added bonus of allowing him to get some rest and yet simultaneously still continue moving south, thereby almost halving his journey time.

walk through those wards unscathed.”
Castiel sneered. “Since no-one accepts what a Praevalen truly is, any attempt to duplicate one is doomed to failure. Even if they are nominally successful, Qui scientists will end up creating people who simply look like Prae but don’t behave like them. They might use their additional height and strength to physically enforce dominance, but the instincts of Praevalen were never intended to be used negatively. Prae dominance was designed purely for clan protection. The instinctive Praevelen characteristics were designed to be the natural beneficial traits of good leaders, Gabe. Millennia of suppressing Prae entirely by deliberately removing the existence of true Subplex is the reason our race, and others, are dying.”
For instance, were someone to kick both their dog and their cat, it would be safe to accept that both creatures would be justifiably hurt, upset and wary of repetition. The dog, however, would most likely assume the blame for the situation and endeavor not to displease its owner again. The cat, on the other hand, would undoubtedly plot its revenge.

To spread his legs willingly for the delight of that lucky master. To never, ever, even dream of expressing an opinion that has not been given him. And, most of all, to never even perceive of the possibility of ever saying ‘no’.

They were gradually loosening, the concrete now puffing up like smoke from the frame, but still the concrete refused to crack and break.
There was an open door at the end of the kitchen with steps leading downwards into the darkness of what was presumably a basement level of the building. Again that was unsurprising as it made logical sense for a pub to have a cellar. The fact he could hear the furious howling of a wolf from down there was a further clue it was the right direction to head in.

"Yeah, don't forget the sex, boss," Benny snorted.
Charlie interrupted his musing with a sigh. “The agricultural operations on Tsaluna are almost exclusively automated. The few remaining manual positions are filled by Tsalun who, forgive me, are far more biologically suited to tasks requiring physical strength and all managerial and research positions are filled by Qui.  Your human qualifications will not count for much with any of the Tsalunniqui. Their intellectual snobbery does not allow for the consideration of the educational facilities on any of the Young-World planets as having any discernible value,” she pointed out apologetically.  “It perhaps isn’t too late for you to rejoin the crew of the L’Astrolabe. They aren’t departing until tomorrow morning.  You should give the idea some serious consideration. I believe your skill set would be far more appreciated in a world such as Vantixian.”
In contrast, the Sea Witch’s cave was not formally listed as a ‘forbidden’ place. She had always relied merely on fear of the unknown to guard the sanctity of her treasures. Fear had always served her well enough in the past. Her reputation had always been a more-than-sufficient deterrent to all the other Mer who lived in the Inner Palace.
"Huh?" Dean asked.
But the damned thing had been sent to his mother’s email box. She was the one who had printed it out and delivered it to him with barely concealed glee. His mother, who had been like a whirling dervish of frustrated fury for weeks because she had finally found a problem that her money couldn’t fix.

But I am not one of them. Well, I suppose other humans might beg to differ since I am, also, a Sea Witch.”

Castiel blinked at him several times, his eyes deep pools of swirling emotion despite the deceptive immobility of his face. A little color returned to his cheeks as either the pills, or the process of actually following the routine of taking them, allowed him to gather himself and when he spoke his voice was surprisingly steady.
He decided to take the books and stow them safely in his truck before visiting the other tents, a decision that cost him considerably more time than the walk to his truck and back. Having been seen and accosted by a frantic Donna, he spent over an hour on the phone dealing with the mundane but crucial issue of a lack of an adequate number of portaloos to handle the number of visitors.
It was only an hour and a half later, when they drove towards the I64 and he saw Benny and Viktor’s car pull out of a lay-by and join them, that Cas realized they were leaving St Louis via a different route than they had arrived.
“So, um, isn’t it about time you did your thing?” Sam asked Gabriel, as they all prepared to approach the Keep. “It’s been almost a day and I know you said it might take a couple of days for you to be able to take control but you claimed it would only take a ‘few hours’ before you could lend me your strength.”

“You don’t have to mate or marry,” Gabriel sighed. “I’m just suggesting you at least find yourself a regular bedwarmer. It’s completely unnatural for any Qui, particularly a Praevalen, to live as a virtual celibate. Just accept there are no Subplex to be had. Find yourself a pretty little biological Submissive to regularly fuck, and be done with it.”
Damn, he was hungry.
“Okay, shoot me if I’m out of line, but why don’t you simplify this whole thing? Why don’t you leave Tsaluna too?  Take the boy to an independent planet where none of this shit even matters, then tell him the truth. Let him see that you’ve voluntarily given up your rights before you even admit that you had them in the first place?”
Because when a player made a formal request of another player for assistance, C.H.U.C.K. automatically converted that request into a Quest and awarded various rewards for successful completion, such as gold and rss.
”Then Omegas are like Alphas,” Gabriel suggested easily. “They obviously carry the same strain of the virus and so don’t need an Alpha bite any more than any Alpha does. That makes total sense.

Although...” and he paused for thought before saying, “Given the homogeneous reproduction demonstrated by the Winchester Omega Line, maybe Omegas carry a totally different
