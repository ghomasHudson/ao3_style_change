Sherlock palpated the flesh a bit and once he'd identified the point he was looking for, pressed on the medial side of John's knee joint between the tendons. His other hand lowered to fondle the calf and stopped a few inches above the ankle, on the inside of the leg, where he pressed another point.
"Beautiful poem, ain't it?" Sebastian asked, lighting a cigarette and joining Sherlock at the window.
John got a sinking feeling in his chest, and raised a hand before his eyes... only to see a paw. A miserable mewl resonated in the room, and he jumped, surprised by his own cry.
He doesn't tell her that the lovely place is in fact a gay bar where Sherlock went to pick up a murderer five years ago.
Molly always turned the radio on when she was in the shower, because it filled the silence of her lonely flat. Well, not that lonely since she got Toby – but like most
"I should?" Mary says, bewildered. She looks down at her belly. "I'm cold," she declares as if she were merely commenting on the weather and not her condition.
She relished Mary's expression as recognition dawned on her. Her eyes widened and gleamed, and her lips parted slightly.
As the footsteps receded down the corridor – probably towards the kitchen – John realized the door had been left open. He grinned. Cautiously, he stepped outside the room, and looked around. At the end of the corridor he could see the kitchen. The boy – Daniel – was sitting back to him, and his mother was facing the stove, her back to John as well. Daniel was talking animatedly to his sister sitting next to him, but whom John could not see, and the man – stepfather? – was next to the woman, helping out with the dishes. This was the perfect time to take a look around.
, so rather pejoratively connoted. But there was nothing pejorative about the cuteness in manul-John. Yet the word
Sherlock's eyes sent him daggers and turned to slits, but he couldn't retort – played at his own game. However he refused to give up just yet.
Sherlock heard the door shut behind his only friend. But his eyes remained fixed to the screen that was displaying a message – one small message, just a few words that had poured sheer terror and mortification into his chest, drowning him from the inside.
When had he been curt? He tried to replay their exchange from the morning, but couldn't really pinpoint anything he'd said that could have been considered rude. What was he trying to say, then?
As you awake with a start, you gasp for air and clench the bedsheet in distress. It feels like a rock is weighing down your chest, a giant locket full of beloved memories that keep knocking you out. Against your right palm you can still feel Sherlock's buttock, his flesh, his sweat, his scent... The feel of his damp curls refuses to leave your other hand. You are haunted, physically haunted. But what breaks you the most is when the sensations begin to fade away.
"I mean about yesterday? Are you refusing to let me touch you because I said I didn't want to have sex with you?"
He burst into his flatmate's room, but said flatmate was nowhere to be seen: his bed wasn't even undone.
"Greg..." you warn. You don't need Sherlock to hear that. He probably already knows. There's no need to rub it in his face. He's back now. And it's all that matters.
"What? No! God, no. I wanted you." John saw something flash in Sherlock's eyes and realized he'd used the past tense.
You glance at him sideways. Maybe this is a good opportunity. Sherlock was always curious, he might be willing to give information in exchange for information.
"She died two years after our wedding," he said flatly. The lack of emotion in his voice made Sherlock wince. He imagined losing John now, and found his brain shying away from the thought. "I... It took me time, to recover. I inherited this empire, all this money, all those hotels. So much money, Sherlock. So much responsibility. But I had lost her, and I had lost you, and I just couldn't... I picked up the masks again," he finished.
"Resuming where I left off. If you don't mind. I think touching you like this calms me down. Does it help with the cold at all?"
He closed his eyes and resumed swaying, feeling the beat again and entering the trance. John Watson did not think he could be sensual. Give pleasure, certainly, but not with sight. He didn't consider himself ugly or anything. Just short, with a nose too long, hair of a nondescript colour.
There was a tap on the door. Holmes lifted his head in surprise, and then we both sat part of the way up.
is boring," Sherlock said, half-sitting up, and for a moment John was worried he really was going to leave. "And your cooking might sound boring, but you, John Watson, are not." He gripped John's socked foot with his opposite hand and squeezed. "You stimulate the imagination. You conduct light."
Fully dressed, he ventured down the stairs and found Sherlock in the flat kitchen making breakfast. He was wearing a long, silk dressing gown that swirled around his calves as he slid an omelet onto a plate.
"Thank you, Chef," Harry said, which was totally wrong, because Mary wasn't a chef. She was a damn good manager, and she knew her way around a kitchen, but calling her a chef was like calling John a doctor. He'd done some First Aid training, but he wasn't prepared for a real medical emergency.
I caught my breath again in between his gentle kisses, smoothing my hands up and down his long back, disarranging his already rumpled nightclothes. When I had recovered myself, he pulled away and moved to clean off his hand with the hem of my nightshirt.
I hesitated, understanding the importance of the question. Our man had been kicked by a horse at some point in his unsavoury youth, which resulted in an undeniably weak left leg.
John crossed his arms over his chest and flexed his toes on the carpet. "Yeah," he admitted. He rubbed at his shoulder, realised he was doing it, and scrubbed that hand through his hair. "Among other things."
"Yes," said I, reaching for his. We also agreed to unfasten our collars and I was able to slip my fingers inside the back of his shirt to cup the nape of his neck as we kissed again. He shuddered and sighed, finding the fabric of my sleeves with his fingers. Then went our shirt cuffs and our waistcoat buttons, followed quickly by our waistcoats themselves. In our shirtsleeves, we sank back onto the settee, rather more horizontal than before, with me half on top of Holmes. He spread his legs to accommodate me and I could feel his arousal pressing hard against my hip. He did not shy away from me.
"Here," he said, "come closer," and we shifted. He threaded his legs over my thighs and we slid together until we were nearly prick to prick. I was sweating, my cock throbbing at every twitch of his fingers as we rearranged ourselves. My bollocks were full and heavy, and his thighs pressed mine apart, making me moan. Then he was guiding my hand and shifting some more, making the water slosh up and down, risking the floor. The tip of his prick touched mine.
Sherlock scooped the vegetables away as soon as John was finished with them, and added them to the sizzling olive oil in the pan.
John already had his coat on, and he stood stupidly in the hallway for a few minutes, trying to figure out what to do.
"Yes, she is," Sherlock said. "She put herself through culinary school, despite her family's disapproval, and her portfolio is impeccable. She lives alone, so no one to complain about long hours except her cat, and she didn't appear to notice that her sweater was the least appropriate thing to wear. That, or she doesn't care, in which case I
John laughed. "Of course that one's true, you prat," he said, wrapping his legs around Sherlock's thighs and rolling them to their sides. "That's why we're here."
We got out of the party in less than ten minutes, but we had to walk another ten to find a main road with enough available cabs to get us back to our side of the city. When we finally caught a hansom, I directed the driver towards Mancini's and caught my eye as we got in.
His collar still sat on the dressing table, and his top two shirt buttons were undone, so I pushed my hand down the back of it and squeezed the muscle in his shoulder. He kissed me deeper, his tongue pressing between my lips, and I could taste the soap at the corners of his mouth. It was sharp and bitter; I pulled him closer.
John squeezed his left hand into a fist. "I know." His arm was still trembling, the skin tingling and the muscles overtired. His grip was weak. "I'm trying," he said. "I can't stay long." He smelled smoke. "Something's on fire."
"It's very kind," Watson said, and as Stanley Hopkins came up on our other side, "very kind indeed." He was looking embarrassed, but I could tell he was pleased.
"Pea butter on bread," Sherlock said, thumbing the notebook open. "We'll use the juice as a jus for something else, but the fat in the peas can go on top of dehydrated herb crackers."
He gasps, his fingers clenching on my ribs, and his hips press up against mine. He is laughing again, breath hissing out his nose, and after a moment he has to stifle it in the crook of his elbow.
“I have used a sourdough starter this time,” Holmes explained, putting his elbows back down on the worktop. “Mrs Simpson has explained the history of the fermented leavening agent, and I am intent on understanding the difference.”
I thought about my first wedding: the details were still sharp and clear in my mind. I pictured Mary's shy smile as our eyes met at either end of the aisle; I could almost smell her perfume as I approached; I remembered the lace on the sleeves of her dress and the little silk flowers on the gossamer veil that covered her hair. She'd been the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen on that day. After she'd died I'd kept that memory locked up tight, but it wasn't as painful as I'd expected to take it out again and examine it. It was a shame my second wedding couldn't even be pieced together enough to form a coherent whole.
“Robbed a jewellery store,” I said. “Hardly worth my time, on an intellectual level, but it kept me busy.”
Watson wasn't listening. I reached over and grabbed his hand, meaning only to get his attention, but his palm was so warm and pleasant that I held on.
I pulled back and worked him with hands alone for a few moments, resting my jaw, while he carded his fingers through my hair and blessed me, told me how beautiful and splendid I was. He was close to his peak, his prick swelling in my hand and his thighs straining wide, and I did not want to disappoint him by missing it. I took a breath and dove down again, filling my senses with his bliss. His fingers tightened into a fist in my hair and one of his heels found my thigh as a place to rest and press. The chair's front legs would have left the ground if I hadn't been leaning on him. He was swearing, almost wordless, and then all at once he went silent, breath caught, hips rising. He filled my mouth, throbbing; I held onto him as he shuddered.
Mrs Hudson came out to see what the fuss was. Holmes let my hand slip from his elbow but caught my fingers in his.
"Sorry, Chef," Hopkins said, turning his back on John and hurrying back to his spot at the prep table. "Oh, no!"
Sherlock left after they'd finished the curry, taking his menu files with him. John couldn't very well offer him a place to sleep. In the morning, John rose at his usual hour, ate two pieces of toast with blackcurrant jam, showered, dressed, brushed his teeth, and stopped halfway out the door at Sherlock's text.
"I've committed everything to this bloody restaurant since the minute I met you!" John cried. "You know perfectly well that this is the best thing to happen to me since I got into cooking school! I take one night off— and I can't believe you'd think I'd hire a bartender just to ogle her! You claim to be able to read people, I hope to God you'd know me well enough by now to know I wouldn't try to get off with the staff."
“No, I don’t,” he said, “and I’d rather not. I know he’s your assistant, but on how many occasions or in what capacity I don’t care. I also know he’s not a bad chap, and that you’re the right one to sort this out.”
"He did say," Lestrade agreed with a sly smile in my direction. "Well, gentlemen, we're all very pleased for you; it was high time you made it official."
His partner, MacDonald, caught John's eye and started to grin as if in commiseration. John stared at him, impassive, and the grin faded.
“I’m not arguing with you about it,” I said. “Where else would you go? Presumably you’ve been robbed as well.”
Salvation! There was a noise in the bushes, a shout of indignation, and then a shape barreled out of the underbrush and caught Williams at an angle, knocking him to the ground. Together they rolled, and I slowed my pace finally, reaching the scuffle at a gentle jog. I came to a stop just a few feet away and bent to rest my hands on my knees. Watson was winning.
"Holmes, I– I have an admission to make." I should have told him a week ago. There would never have been a good time to do it.
. Lestrade even put a face on it, as if I could glean comfort from the sight of my dear friend, knowing that it is but a shell that houses a lie. I scorn it. It stays in this house with me as a guardian, an assistant, but it has made me a prisoner. I have to escape from it. I have to get out of here.
Instantly Sherlock's arms came up and around him, and John found himself crushed against Sherlock's body. Sherlock kissed like he'd never heard of foreplay, and the deep, dirty thrust of his tongue made John moan in surprise. John slid his hand up into Sherlock's curls and held on, relishing Sherlock's answering groan. Sherlock's hands spread out across his back, one between his shoulder blades and the other broad across the small of his back; he held John to him and kissed him until he was breathless. He tasted like smoked mushrooms, and the smell of the kitchen downstairs had been replaced by the more delicate scent of his shampoo and aftershave. John wanted to devour him. He dug his fingers deeper into Sherlock's hair, drawing another moan from him, and fisted his other hand in Sherlock's button-down shirt. He'd seen Sherlock change once from the dress shirt into his chef coat, and the sight of the skin-tight white T-shirt he'd had on underneath had been torture of the best variety. John wanted to see it again.
of the evidence, though it did gall me to be trapped in a useless interrogation while the weather got to the crime scene. Still. Even if some of it washed off, there’s just not enough of it here. And the skip, despite its other questionable contents, is free of blood residue.”
John thought he might start keeping a list of things that Sherlock said that were like that. He was starting to wonder if Sherlock had ever been in a relationship, or if being mated had just scrambled the man’s otherwise highly functional brain. Though, no, the gap between expectation and assumption seemed only present in things related to John.
John took the place beside him, wondering what time it was. The view through the windows was light, so it must be sometime in the morning, but that was all he could make out about it. There were no clocks in the flat, it seemed.
The buildings were drab, military structures that dated back to the time of his grandparents. The whole facility had been taken over and repurposed, of course. There had been some additions, and some upgrading to them, but the overall impression the sturdy military structures gave off was a dreary one. Coming back to it now was like entering an occupied ruin.
In the painful intervening days, John had all but forgotten that discussion in the library. Now that it was mentioned again, though, he recalled a question that he failed to ask at the time. His intent to question was interrupted by a growl of complaint from first one and then both of the empty stomachs in the bed.
"Hope it's a good surgeon," John said, shaking his head. It was strange to think of someone else cutting into him again. After the last surgery-
“And what about you, then?” Stamford asked. “You joined the army, after all? You said you’d wanted it. The rush of excitement, getting shot at. Well, what happened?”
In the last three or four days not a single person had used the buzzer to the flat. Mycroft just appeared, in that unsettling way that John was coming to associate with him, and Milton had been banging at the door. So whoever it was had to be some degree of stranger.
Down the other side of the hill, John caught his foot on a root and took a bit of a tumble. Sherlock checked his fall by providing a warm furry side to trip into, and gave a soft growling huff of annoyance. It was just the once, though, and it was rather dark out.
“I warned you about this, Sherlock,” the sergeant said in a low, dangerous sounding voice, “I’m not going to cover for you this time, anything you’ve done-”
“I can’t leave this half-done,” John said, gesturing to the cushion. “It might eat through the fabric.”
“Never failed us before,” John said. He couldn’t help the chuckle, especially when Sherlock huffed angrily at the notion. “Look, even without the rest of it, I keep thinking ‘what if he died’,” John admitted, reaching up to undo the third button of his shirt front. Sherlock’s eyes fell to it again, watching him, but calculatingly. “And I’ve seen…” John bit back what he wanted to say about the sand and the blood and all the things he couldn’t remember, and instead offered, “Let’s just say I’ve an active imagination. So. Why don’t you remind me that we’re both alive?”
They were through the doors before Lestrade had any chance to reply, and they were in the lift before John’s brain caught up with the tail end of the conversation. “What do you mean you’ll solve the murder tomorrow?”
It was an awkward sort of phrasing, and the way it came out made John wonder how good the man was at his job. John knew he had a temper, he knew there were times he had come across
“That’s new,” John said, staring at it. Paying attention to his hand made the twitching stop, which was-
“She could just talk to either of us,” Sherlock said, hands lying still on the counter as he looked up at Mycroft.
“Your sister is, at best, antagonistic to you. I’m not sure now is a good time for you to be assaulted with her.”
It was a reasonable reaction, given that the source of the information he required - the beloved source of it was John, and John was pressed into his side.
The low rumble sent a shiver through John, and he’d been hard before but he was straining at that tone from that voice. Sherlock covered John’s hands with his, threading their fingers together to loose John’s hold on his hips. Sherlock’s lips pressed to the corner of his jaw, and then the hollow of his throat, and then their lips met and parted and the only single clear thought that John had was that he had never been kissed quite like this by anyone, ever.
“And maybe I am taking issue with something I’ve no right to, but I don’t like thinking about that possibility.”
Sherlock was protesting loudly, and Sergeant Lestrade was arguing back in as firm, and authoritative a voice as he could manage. He would never match Holmes senior or Elisabeth, and thus was vastly ineffective, but-
Clothes had been brought into the room at some point, and John didn't venture a guess as to how they knew his size. If Mycroft knew enough of his file to know he wasn't entirely discharged, it was a cinch for him to have found out something as mundane as what size trousers he wore, no matter how disturbing the thought of that was. He absolutely refused to think about how the pants had been the right size.
have a cup of tea. John wasn’t surprised, but the man looked too exhausted to do much other than arrest them, and quite literally they had done nothing wrong.
The door opened and Matthews came in, bearing a tray. If he thought anything of his two masters’ position, he did not voice it. John straightened enough to nod when Matthews hesitated at the book laden table, and the man made short work of tidying a space for the dinner tray. He started to set out the plates, but John shook his head. “That will be fine, thank you.”
To distract himself, John studied Mycroft. The suit the other wolf wore was dark, cleanly pressed despite whatever participation he had in the rescue the night before, and impeccable. It was the sort of suit that John would never buy for himself because of the outrageous price tag. Looking over his - was in-law an appropriate term in this instance? - looking over the wolf, John thought of what Sherlock had told the people that held them. He thought of what he could remember his mate almost sobbing out as he himself was jolted in punishment for slow answers. The words drifted through his head now.
Before John had decided he was properly awake, Sherlock stopped his soft monologue and said, “I am sorry, John.”
This was quarantine. It was still an incarceration, but also a safety precaution. It was procedure. He had done the same when their own were rescued from captivity.
Whenever John praised Sherlock, a curious expression crossed the man’s face. John had to wonder if anyone had ever praised him quite so openly before. A part of him was sad if no one had, another part pleased at the reaction he garnered from his husband.
and wished Sherlock wouldn’t take his bloody sweet time on a simple shopping trip. “I’d invite you up for tea, but given the circumstances-”
Minutes passed, minutes that seemed to stretch on and on. Greg shifted from foot to foot, looking away from the pair of them only to turn back, concerned about the blood that would be coming from Dr. Watson’s hand. That was when he noticed that Sherlock’s pants hadn’t just snagged, the shards of the mug had managed to cut his knees.
“Despite appearances,” Mycroft said primly, “I am not all-knowing. If a situation has not been documented, I am not immediately aware of all the particulars.”
The sergeant had an odd flush to his cheeks, and that killed any amusement that John felt. It was replaced by a rush of protective jealousy that flared up as he realized that another man was staring at naked Sherlock. Sherlock was
John reached up to stop him, and Sherlock snarled at him, smacking his hand away and continuing to undress him almost urgently. "Hey!" John protested, reaching up to catch Sherlock's wrist again only to have Sherlock's face shoved into his. Both grey eyes narrowed warningly, and John could see the wolf in this. There was no point in struggling against it. "This really isn't the time for that."
The surgery was a success, in as much as that the implants had been removed. There was a certain base satisfaction about that, one that Sherlock could feel in all the parts of himself. The wolf in him was pleased to be free of the tether, pleased that John had acquitted himself well in the face of Mycroft's unreasonable posturing, and was contented that John seemed as sincere about his connection to Sherlock as a human could be expected to be.
Finally the therapist released John. That was terrible as much as it was wonderful, because the entire ‘chat’ had him turned around and twisted. That last set of questions - all the things about what had happened in Afghanistan - were the ones that were the problem. The whole walk back to the bunk room, as they passed through every door, John expected to run into a wall of heat as he had in the desert. But this gray-walled facility felt more solid than the one in Afghanistan, and the tents had never been much good at keeping all the heat out. Still, John staggered as he returned to the bunk room and collapsed on his bunk.
John knew he liked her when they first met, but he had greater hopes of some sibling camaraderie now that he knew that about her.
and even the warmth of the body on top of him wasn’t getting through that. "You were going to say, 'I'm here'."
Then it became obvious that Connie was becoming tired, and Sherlock was growing restless. The playing tapered off and Sherlock trotted over to lick John’s face and smell at his neck. John put an arm around Sherlock, digging his fingers into his mate’s coat to pet him in return, and then Sherlock pulled back. He headed over to where Connie was seated, and nosed her in John’s direction before darting into the trees.
. And John took comfort that there were enough things left to figure out to be certain of them being ensconced in London for quite some time. Sherlock’s game was in criminals and mysteries.
John could understand the urge, there were enough people that the conversation was almost smothering. He wanted to join Sherlock, but even though he was not very active in the conversation, every time he started to get up someone asked John a question and made it only polite to remain seated to give the answer.
No matter his personal bitterness, seeing Sherlock like this did not soothe Mycroft’s own discomforts.
None of that mattered, just then. Sherlock couldn’t find it in him to care about it, even as a puzzle he had successfully solved. Where he had recorded those answers in his mind palace was empty, a blank room that was like a note written on white paper that was washed out in too much sunlight.
“You were gone twenty-one days. Twenty-two if you count the horrid morning in Wiltshire when you were taken.”
"Don't," John warned, turning in his mate’s arms. He buried his face in Sherlock's neck and put his arms tight around his mate. The conversation with Harry wasn’t over, of course. She wasn’t done asking, and she was a
“Sorry about that,” John replied. A stray thought drifted across his mind that Sherlock had not said,
The well-dressed wolf paused, sniffing once and turning to glance back into the living room. “You mean that quite literally, I see.”
There were ten or twenty things John could say in response to that, but what he chose was, "Hold me."
“Maybe you should step away from your friend there, Sherlock,” the sergeant suggested in a calming tone.
Mycroft stood silently by the door, his eyes on the orderly as the woman draped the scrubs on the foot of the bed. She seemed a bit nervous, and John had to wonder if it was the two very naked men in the room or if it was Mycroft watching her. His money was on Mycroft.
‘This’ was a blow job that would have put John on his knees if Sherlock hadn’t wrapped arms around his waist and held him up.
Thankfully, Sherlock was in no fit state to pluck it out. If he were, no short duration of tantrum would answer it, Mycroft was sure.
“Briefly,” Sherlock replied. “The amount of blood involved with the victim meant that my pristine appearance ruled me out as a suspect.”
All he knew for certain were the clinical details. There had been a gunshot, and that had hurt. John could recall the feeling of it vividly without knowing any specific manner of describing it. He though that maybe the pain had been like a fire. But then maybe the pain was delayed by the shock?
after all, not well known for surrendering in the face of adversity or social niceties. John had dogged a bullet, that was all, nothing much to celebrate. And yet he felt giddy with release. The absence of the ache made John dizzy, and his arm was still trembling. He gripped Sherlock tighter against the sensation. "I don't want to talk about Harry. Just shut up and take me home."
“It’s not a problem,” John said, settling in the clean chair near the fire. If he looked over, and he did, he could see Sherlock’s profile. He was concentrating on the books, perhaps a bit too hard.
And that dark thought stared at him accusingly, the way dark thoughts like that always did. It tripped John a little as they headed along, but even the guilt that was threatening wasn’t enough to dampen the relief that he felt just being in London again.
The two of them dozed a bit. Sherlock lay draped mostly across John's back, John shifted enough to get comfortable with one cheek pressed into a pillow. It was warm, and they were close together, and that was really all either of them had come to need over the last weeks.
“What’s this then?” John asked, sniffing the whiskey curiously. He offered Gerard a smile, hoping to encourage some conversation with the only other human present. As Gerard was mated in there was the possibility of the topic not being about Sherlock.
That was good. It calmed something dangerously anxious that had been rattling around in the cage of John’s chest.
Sherlock, he had experienced no greater pleasure than being in his husband’s at-times alarming presence.
That feeling was hard for Sherlock to decipher, but he knew it would cause problems in the near future.
Nothing explained (what little had been) has made Sherlock's pack siblings something John could expect.
“Sorry, I’m just a bit- well. We were out of paracetemol,” he groused. “And tea, and the bloody kettle is in
Sherlock huffed softly, stroked John’s hair, and kissed his head. “It doesn’t matter to me,” he said softly, “you will be there.”
Also, if we're terribly unfortunately unedited, I will look back at it tomorrow. Please let me know if there are any glaring spelling/grammar errors in this.
This is the part where I meant please, please correct me if I've got my NSY ranks wrong. (Otherwise, you can probably guess who it is without me updating the tags yet, can't you?)
“Anything in English,” John asked, recalling that file Mycroft had made him read, not even having to embellish his desire to read something in his native language much, “a novel?”
to be so deeply in touch with his mate. His conclusion, as time drew on and he found his way through the depths of John's tumult, was that John seemed to be
“Of course I will,” John said with a sigh. “Look, I really haven’t seen her. And I’m sorry about what Sherlock said, it’s-” he stopped.
The distance was abrupt and tangible. The feeling of it was a quick dropping feeling in John’s stomach, but without the associated anguish of being separated and angry that’s all it was, a mild discomfort. Sherlock was apparently moving fast. John couldn’t put it out of his mind, exactly, but he was able to keep working on the cushion.
As John closed the door, the bow caught on a single note, and then Sherlock’s tune changed. The agitated notes notes became longer, more contemplative. Sherlock swayed slightly, body bending and half-turning towards the door.
Unlike Sherlock, John was far more reserved with ‘sharing’, as his mother had put it when he had asked privately, his emotions.
Elisabeth tilted her head as she regarded him, but said nothing in response. That was good, it let John work his blood pressure back down. When he stopped seeing everything with anger-tinted glasses, he figured this was sort of normal in-law behavior, albeit with higher stakes and a shorter period for everyone to adjust. John was joining their family, of course they would have... opinions about it.
Sherlock got his feet properly under him and launched forward, but his movements were impaired by the drugs. Mycroft caught the arm that Sherlock swung up towards his face by the wrist and wrenched it upwards as he took a step around behind Sherlock. Sherlock retaliated by throwing his free arm backwards, elbow aimed at Mycroft’s shoulder, but Mycroft hooked his left ankle around Sherlock’s and pushed two steps forward. A savage shift of Mycroft’s weight brought Sherlock back down and pinned the younger wolf awkwardly against the sink once again.
Plus, for all that he was mated to one, he knew very little about the social behavior of werewolves.
Each of the six separate times that he verbally eviscerated his housemaster at Eton in the two years before the man was switched out.
“No,” John cut him off, aware of where that sentence was going without needing to sense Sherlock’s emotions to sort it out. “I’m saying there’s a gap in my understanding. We know there is. We’ve talked about that.”
John stared at the floor, because he knew that if he looked up at the sergeant then he would say or do something completely out of line with the ‘not ending up in handcuffs’ goal from earlier. He felt Sherlock grip his shoulders, felt his mate’s concern nudging at him.
There were places in John’s memory that he didn’t go, things he didn’t think about. But there were triggers that could be tripped, like a Humvee crossing an IED, and apparently Sherlock talking about other people - other lovers or sex partners or-- good lord, John couldn’t
Waking at the very end of the morning to a grumbling, gurgling sound, John was pleased to find Sherlock wrapped around him, doing his best octopus impression. It was secretly one of John’s favorites, especially when he needed the reassurance of proximity. After the night before - the cops, the information, the flashback - John had needed reassurance. He would never have said it aloud in those words, but it was true.
John smiled. He was glad that Sherlock had decided to talk after all. This would make things easier, since John wasn't so good at guessing.
Sherlock simply ignored them and walked straight on to the crossroads, where he hailed a cab as if one had just been waiting for him to raise his arm. John shook his head, threw a "We're all right, thank you! And I'm a doctor too" to their fellow citizens who were, after all, just doing their duty, and hurried after his friend. He slipped into the car next to him and shut the door just as Sherlock announced:
Mycroft's goal obviously was to get rid of Moriarty's network, of the Angels, the Devils, whatever those crazy humans wanted to be called as long as they stood between hell and heaven. Or at least control them. That was just the general idea. Even more generally speaking, he had vowed allegiance to the crown – Queen and country and all that. He had chosen a side, period. And he played the game from there. His position was the best to never be bored – at least for him.
However, if danger surrounded you, it meant you were never bored. You'd found recently that fear was such a great way to dispel boredom. You always feared for your life and for... John's. That was also why you couldn't let John know you were alive. The good doctor would want to come and help.
This time his flatmate's reaction was much more dramatic. His eyes widened and he stepped back in disbelief before sending him a death glare. John glared back. They had a staring contest for a few seconds before Sherlock changed his strategy and went for the puppy eyes.
Moran could not repress a smile. They walked into the clearing until they were both standing approximately in the middle. Sebastian looked round, feeling a presence. His eyes stopped on a heap of rocks, on top of which a crow was standing. He blinked. It was so odd and it felt so out of place that Sebastian almost laughed.
you muse with puzzlement. What did you not tell yourself about Sherlock? You've been thinking of him every minute of your life since his death. You've been dreaming of him, you've been craving his mere presence in the room, you've...
John wondered if he'd been wrong – this scene felt rather familiar too: Sherlock, thinking about a case, and ignoring him, his violin in hand. Something was off, though. The quietness in the flat was almost surreal. Yet John couldn't bring himself to mention Lestrade's call, for he wasn't sure whether he'd been wrong or not: if Sherlock didn't know about Moriarty's little present to the D.I., then he certainly didn't want to tell him. He tried to sound relaxed as he asked:
He ignored the fact that not many of John's girlfriends had paws and roared when they climbed into bed.
And slowly, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's face to observe his every reaction, John slipped his hand down Sherlock's back and between his cheeks, which were already parted since he'd wrapped his legs around John. John's fingers caressed the sensitive skin and stopped on Sherlock's entrance. As Sherlock breathed in deeply, John felt his friend's heart hammer against his own chest. But Sherlock did not stiffen and his eyes, locked with John's, were glowing with determination.
"He really does put you in terrible situations, doesn't he?" Mycroft went on, addressing John this time. "Well, please keep taking good care of him. I'm afraid you're quite irreplaceable. Who else would deal with him like you do?"
This time John glided up in front of him instead of making him turn, and cupped his face with one hand, the other resting low on his back, his arm still circling his waist. Clear blue eyes plunged into the darker ones.
"Anyway, because of that the police always thinks you're the culprit when they investigate something and you just happen to be there, if y'see what I mean. And I just happened to be there and they wanted to put me inside for
Sherlock ignored him and walked up to John, who had frozen in place when he'd noticed Sherlock and Victor in the room. Sherlock picked him up and buried his face in the crook of his fluffy neck for a moment. John squealed, but didn't give too much of a fight.
"Yeah, unnerving. Unless there's something more. Unless there's someone 'more'... More than other people. Someone like Jim. Someone like you."
He stops and stares at the man who's just burst into the kitchen – and gapes. Even shaved and well dressed, there's no mistaking.
John liked the food, though he worried about her not being hungry. He made her eat something in the end.
would have been hilarious if said manul weren't John being sick. Sherlock was at a complete loss as to what he should do. He rushed to the feline's side and held him gingerly but firmly as the cat emptied his stomach of the irritating liquid, caressing his back clumsily with what he hoped were encouraging strokes. He wasn't good at this kind of things. Why did John have to be so stubborn and drink so much tea? Sherlock tried to ignore the fact that he'd been just as responsible in refilling the bowl each time. It wasn't his fault. He didn't feel guilty. Not at all.
"That doesn't make any sense, darling," he teases tenderly, kissing her temple as he walks past her to pour himself some tea.
And yet... Was it too soon? You didn't seem to mind. In fact, I didn't expect you to be so… keen. It was a tiny bit embarrassing, you know.
The thing is, he didn't. All he wanted was to revive Sherlock to kill him slowly and painfully, or better even, to make him go through exactly the same thing
John shrugs. "Your mind was a mess, Sherlock. Your day had been filled with sex and violence and crime. It's not like you actually tortured me to get off."
"Oh come on John, a big boy like you," Sherlock teased, locating the tensed or twitching spots and penetrating them gradually but forcefully with his fingertips.
This is all so absurd and John is still shocked to be standing in front of his old flat. He can't quite fathom what in the world the man wants with him.
You open your eyes and look at him. Slowly, you pull his face down towards yours until your lips are touching.
They stared at each other heatedly. John kept glancing at one, then the other, not quite sure how he should intervene, if at all.
‘He doesn’t seem to like you much either,’ she commented lightly, and John could hear the laugh in her voice.
"It's part of me," you murmur against her hair. "It's how I am, but it will never prevent me from loving you and loving Blake."
By the third time John woke up as a manul, he was no longer appalled. Very annoyed, yes. Luckily Sherlock
You couldn't care less. You're not even paying attention to him. You just want him out of the picture. Deliberately, Sherlock gets out of the car. Closes the door behind him.
John groaned and pulled Sherlock closer to him, inhaling his exhilarating scent, pressing their torsos closely. He slipped his hand back into the trousers, slowly, observing his friend's reactions attentively. Sherlock blushed, shut his eyes, and while his devious fingers were sending John to the seventh heaven, he snuggled up to him like a lost, frightened child... or so John thought, until he felt the bite on the side of his throat.
The consulting detective glanced at him, frowned, finished whatever he was doing on his phone (of course, he wouldn't just interrupt what he was doing for
In the end, Seb still insisted you took a cab to Roland-Kerr Further Education College, retracing Sherlock's steps before you found him thanks to Jennifer Wilson's phone. And now here you are.
If Sherlock hadn't died so prematurely, would you have really got to know him better? People never try to get to know better those they're already close to, those who have become so much part of their life that they take their presence for granted.
Once his trousers had fallen all the way down his legs, he took a deep breath and stepped out. Moriarty had been right. At the moment, he really
Sherlock ignored Donovan and started looking around, thoughts of John receding in the back of his mind.
Sherlock jumped. Quite literally. Lestrade gave him an odd look as a cat wearing a coat came out of the kitchen. Sherlock stared. Lestrade shrugged.
"And that's all. Asked me if I was in a romantic relationship with you – but you know your brother, he wasn't
He looks away. "There might be a trial. Mycroft will tell us. I didn't ask him to get rid of the body, if that's what you fear. He'll be buried."
"Even with sex he was lovely," she goes on, ignoring her friend. "Always very considerate. Loving, too. I could tell he was touching only me, trying to please only me, and thinking only of me."
could  solve this case) and finally do some serous talking. This just wasn't  going to work. His plan was delayed, however, when a classy black car  stopped next to him, and he was kindly asked to come.
Admittedly, he had no time to bother thinking about his past. He must have been busy enough with the present, and perhaps the (close) future. And then? Then...
John opened his eyes. Yes, he thought, perhaps he could understand. The feeling that you should not be wasting your time here, that you were much more needed somewhere else; that your true place was elsewhere. A very small smile graced his face, and he tried not to think how ridiculous he must have looked, being a cat. Slowly, he raised his paw and put it on Sherlock's chest.
"It's not like we have to shout to the world that we have sex," he finally said, feeling that this hadn't come out right.
. They had key positions, whether in the government, secret services, the army, and so on. They were apparently on the side of the Law, but in fact were not. He created their network, and he was at the very centre of the web –
And perhaps there was in his approach more possessiveness than protectiveness against criminals than he thought. He'd decided since the last time he transformed that they had been wasting too much time bickering instead of cuddling, and that cuddling was much more pleasant for both parties. It was just an assessment, and he didn't read further into it. Cuddling felt better than bickering, so they shouldn't waste their time bickering this time. There was nothing more to it.
But from what Chris had told Harry about John's dreams – and yes, that had been disturbing, and she'd kindly asked her not to mention her brother's fantasies again in front of her – whatever he felt physically for Sherlock had nothing to do with that normal, healthy, human urge. It was the continuation of the thrill and the fascination, of the pleasure and exhilaration Sherlock brought in John's life. Basically, he cared so much and more than that, was so hooked already that it seemed only logical he'd want more, want to get closer to the flame, and burn. Especially when the person's presence had been so tragically and prematurely ripped away from him. Harry couldn't imagine worse mutilation. In the end, he'd always chosen Sherlock over anyone else, and it seemed that by moving back to Baker street, he was saying that it would
The ex-soldier's first reaction was to choose death over such a humiliation, but then after having seen Sherlock's face, he'd changed his mind and seemed to have concluded that rape was not too high a price to pay if he could still be with Sherlock.
Irene smiled wolfishly, yet in an endearingly charming way, and took off the soft piece of clothing she was wearing, replacing the blood red with unalloyed white, and letting her hair down. Yi Ling took the dress that her mistress had removed, her cheeks matching its colour. She averted her gaze, trying pointedly not to look.
Sure, he still doesn't have a job, although he has been offered one – Harry meddling with his life again, no doubt. Doctors Without Borders. It is very kind of her to keep trying even after he has thrown her out of his flat. Room. He still refuses to see her, and she does not try to contact him anymore.
Sherlock looked away and switched to the IOU file instead. He needed to identify all of them and gain their trust, otherwise they'd keep in hiding and wouldn't reveal their identities, which
In the right ankle John... Roylott had put the marks there to deflect suspicion onto one of the snakes his step-daughter's fiancé kept... as pets..."
"I'm sorry," he said precipitately, standing and walking up to Sherlock as if to protect him in some way.
She got off lightly and walked to the door. Looked up at the window and saw a light. Glanced at her watch. Smiled.
"Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the Horror of the shade, and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid."
"Listen, Sherlock. I am a responsible adult, no matter what Mycroft may think on the matter. When you asked me if we could engage in a physical relationship, I knew what you meant."
He bit his lip to suppress a moan as Sherlock's leg not-so-innocently brushed against his erection. Now John was
didn't leave him time to waver anymore, and he felt as if his hands were playing of their own accord. He closed his eyes again.
He still had to do his official job, however, and so he was given the case no one managed to deal with then: a serial-killer using poisoned apples to kill young women. Another great media sensation. Greg suspected Mycroft to be behind the fact that he of all inspectors was given the case, just so he could get contacts in the press.
Lestrade shook his head, his fists clenching and unclenching as he seemed to be debating something internally. That infuriating man could crush his career on a whim, and he knew it. Finally, he snapped. "Sod it! You're the one who leaves me no choice."
Her frown deepens but she makes no comment as she enters the room with her small purple suitcase, her coat and hat under the arm.
Her? Had Sherlock seen Irene Adler, then? And... she knew Victor? John frowned, then remembered what his face looked like when he did, and smoothed it at once. God, this was so embarrassing.
With a grace John could never have even when he was sober, Victor stood up and went to the counter. John watched him from afar, full-on charm and all smiles with Angelo, and thought with a lopsided smile that he was probably a lot more similar to Captain Kirk than himself. Or to Bond. But John did not like the man enough to concede that point just yet.
. Sherlock just lay there like a broken doll, incapable of moving, incapable of calling him back. He was frozen.
"Deep massage can be painful, but it allows the affected area to be realigned and knots worked out," John recited, "it improves blood flow, which helps replenish nutrients in the muscle as well as remove toxins."
He grinned broadly at his flatmate, Cheshire cat-like, and John chuckled. Sherlock's facial expressions were priceless at any time – but as a tiger, they were just too much.
The whole issue was ridiculous to begin with. Slumping back into his chair, he looked at the old hat morosely.
"Harry Pinner was a young accountant who worked for Pinner & Co, a plumbing company. His body was found in the wardrobe of room 212, where a certain Richard Leverton and his wife were staying. The body was found by Mr Leverton when he came back from a three day trip in the South of Sumatra, and the autopsy showed that Pinner had been killed only the previous day, in the evening. Mrs Leverton never left the game parlor, and the surveillance cameras as well as several witnesses confirm that she was playing bridge with friends when the murder took place."
They were both silent for a moment. John wanted to ask something, but didn't quite dare. Naturally, Sherlock, being Sherlock, forestalled him.
"Don't apologize," Sherlock demanded. Then, averting his gaze: "Listen, John, if you don't want me that way, I would perfectly understand, and–"
"But that's not the only reason, is it?" John insisted, leaning in closer. "You're truly scared to ride, aren't you?"
He wanted to tell John he'd solved the case, not realizing how akin to that of a child (or a puppy) his behaviour was. He just needed to prove that perhaps he wasn't worthless and hear John call him brilliant or fantastic or amazing and so on. Right now, he was so excited he could no longer tell whether it was from pride, relief, anticipation or fear – or maybe all of the aforementioned.
John swallowed. Sherlock was so close he could smell the scent of his soap and tell it apart from that of his shampoo. He could even discern, under it, another smell that was distinctly
You glance at him and catch his eye. There is warmth there, too; but you can't read anything else. Were you any good?
, thought John as he held the writhing body and rode his own orgasm. The thought made him chuckle softly against the throbbing throat. Hearing John's quiet laughter Sherlock muttered something that sounded like 'stupid poem...' and tightened his grip around him, pressing their chests closer.
He let the cane slide alongside his cheek, throat and upper torso and arched his back to the touch, moving his hips in soft circular motions that soon degenerated in a desperate twist and stopped altogether.
As he held John's pulsing member in his palm, stopping his strokes and just holding him, feeling him beat against his hand, Sherlock stared in wonder.
"Wait!" she hears behind her, but pays it no heed. She runs on and on and realizes with a pang of guilt that she is still wearing his coat. She should have given it back before fleeing. What if he's cold? What if he
Then a thought hit him. It had nothing to do with babies, but Sherlock hadn't grasped that it was what had made John laugh. He thought about the situation instead. In such a context, was it normal behaviour to shower together? Would he be expected to do so, after all John had gone through just for him? Because even in the midst of confusion, fear, pain and self-disgust, Sherlock was well aware how much it had cost John, a straight man, to strip tease in front of his
"Yes, he is," Mary comments absent-mindedly. John is a soldier. Sometimes she has a hard time picturing him on the front; but then some other times, she doesn't find it hard to imagine at all.
But she clomb and she clomb, till she got dizzy in the light and shivered with the cold, and dazed with the fear; but still she clomb, till at last, quite amazed and silly-like, she let clean go, and sank down - down - down.
Sherlock woke up with a gasp. His jolt pressed him further into the lips of the man kissing him. The man kissing him... Sherlock's eyes widened in horror and a moment later Sebastian Moran found the canon of a gun pressed to his left temple.
"So, been working on a case?" she asks as she comes to join you at the table, bringing a plate of biscuits.
And it seemed Moriarty had well understood all that. Oh, he'd been brilliant. Irene Adler was just a tool to verify what he'd already figured out. Sherlock had been (
"Do I what?" Seb asked, puzzlement clear in his voice. Maybe a bit too clear. But it might have been genuine. In the end, it did not matter.
"You know what? I don't care. If you want to drown in your own blood, do so. Just don't do it here."
, he thought, and he had the urge to see the tiger vulnerable and purring under his hand. He shook his head, trying to get a grip. What was
side. Not quite ordinary, though. Still, it had been stupid of her to come to London. Idiotic woman. Always liked meddling. Just couldn't stop herself, could she?
So the ex-soldier just stood there, trembling with a fury he had not thought himself capable of feeling.
"He was in a lab at St Bart's. Mike brought me in. We were talking about the time when we were at school there, and I just lent Sherlock my mobile phone because he asked Mike his, but he didn't have it. I offered mine. He took it and asked: 'Afghanistan or Iraq?'"
"I'm going to kill him," John states, and Sherlock realizes he's serious. "But first I'll see what this is ab–" He grabs his arm before John can turn and go to the bedroom.
He stood up and took the pale hands in his, intertwining his rough fingers with Sherlock's long, slender ones.
There isn't anyone to vent his frustration on, and so even walking all day hasn't calmed his nerves. He wishes he had to go to the clinic, because at least that would have been a distraction. But he only works three days a week, plus some filling in hours here and there. He's glad to be going tomorrow, though.
shouldn't he at least try? As it was, John had mostly seemed uncomfortable. Which only confirmed that there was more to his friend's attitude than the "I'm just afraid I'd do something you wouldn't like" he'd given him as explanation.
And with a wink, she's gone. You realize you didn't even say hi to Blake; you didn't even hold your son.
But his eyes were dead serious. Sherlock snapped, and snarled. John ignored him completely, and circling the tiger's body with his arms, lifted it from the chair and began to manhandle him towards the corridor as if he were merely a very big, unwanted cat.
You glance at Sherlock, waiting for him to look back, to acknowledge your presence – in vain. His eyes are fixed on Seb, and on Seb alone.
was in the way. The one time he managed to go all the way, he came screaming Sherlock's name – and even a one-night stand doesn't appreciate that. He'd found himself thrown out of her flat in the middle of the night, and wasn't very inclined to repeat the experience.
"Yes. You can watch a movie if you like. See, you even have earphones. I'm sure you'll find a film to your liking. Or two. Or three."
"Hey!" Seb exclaims, nudging him. But his smile is as bright as ever, and he shakes Lestrade's hand warmly. "Although, to be fair, he's quite right."
When you're not busy thinking about your next step in this unnecessarily convoluted mess your late nemesis left you, you eat and sleep. You've noticed you must pay extra attention now, as John isn't here to remind you to do so if you want your body to be functional. You groan again – it's becoming a habit – and burry your head in your pillow. Whenever you eat, you think of John. Whenever you sleep, you dream –
John squirmed and tried to push him back, but 1) He didn't want Sherlock to feel as if he were rejecting him 2) His erection was throbbing already and he wondered since when he'd become such a beast (it hadn't even been twenty-four hours, for God's sake! Oh, but they hadn't touched since the previous morning, so... No, God!) 3) He wasn't so sure he wanted to push him back.
John found he did not like being the cause of Sherlock taking drugs. It hadn’t been intentional, of course, but it was still true. As things were, John couldn’t go on being angry about it. He wondered how it had felt, absently. Sherlock transmitted his feelings seemingly all the time that he was aware of them, like a beacon in the darkness. He was present, when they were together, when they were apart, and John’s chest tightened at the thought of Sherlock changing or… or being different.
Sherlock Holmes once claimed that his body was no more than an appendix: that he was a brain and nothing more. He treats himself with shocking indifference while he is working: ignoring food, forgoing sleep, functioning on the smoke of his tobacco and the thrill of the puzzle. I happen to be a great admirer of that magnificent brain, but I tend to disagree that the rest of him is meaningless. Particularly as I have a great fondness for that body, and his sense of humour, and his kindness to his street urchins, and the way his fingers linger on the back of my hand when we are in public. But I digress. There have been more than a few times that I've felt it necessary to remind him to be considerate of the needs of his mortal form. And there are also times that I am reminded he is his own man, and knows his own body best.
"After your restaurant caught on fire as a result of your alcoholic sister's negligence, don't you think you should be more cautious about your investments?"
His makeup kit on his vanity serves more purpose than disguise; many of the flannels there are put to use in situations like this. He found one, wiped himself clean, did the same for me, my belly, and my right hand, and then stood nude in the centre of the room to light a cigarette. I admired him full-length: his long, pale arms; his elegant bearing; his strong thighs, knees, calves, and feet; his glorious rosy prick, softening against the dark thatch of his pubic hair; his piercing eyes and soft smirk when he caught me looking. I smiled back, stretching my arms over my head and relishing the pull of my muscles.
Then he murmured, "May I?" again and I ground out my agreement as he untied the fly on my drawers. My cock sprang out to meet his hand, and he ducked his head to run his tongue around my nipple as he began to stroke me. The sensation zinged through me, as if the two were directly connected, and I found myself spreading my legs wide to give him access. He stroked me slowly at first as he kissed my chest, and then as I began to squirm he sped his hand up. He was reading my reactions to the touch of his hand the same way he read my thoughts from my face, and the thought made me hot all over.
Moriarty sneered. To Sherlock, he said, "How does it feel to scrape the bottom of the barrel to find someone who'll work with you?"
Sherlock was beaming at him. "Give them to Gregson," he said, indicating Toni with a wave of his hand and not taking his eyes off John. "Then get two of the triangle plates down and do me two servings of the tomato soup noodles."
The third man, a man named Kirk, only laughed with some degree of hysteria when Holmes demanded to know where Blakeley was. This seemed to confirm Holmes's suspicion, for he asked, "Is he in the Thames, then, or in some shallow grave in Shadwell?"
good, a set of Italian wines that John didn't have a lot of experience with. One of them was £65 a bottle, which Sherlock lingered longingly over, giving John little hopeful glances. John sipped it slowly, regretting the last seventeen wines he'd tried for sullying this experience even a little. It was fruity and silky, and for a moment the noise in the room dulled a little as he met Sherlock's eyes again.
Sherlock went white. "Get out," he said. His hands had clenched into fists at his sides, and he was vibrating with rage. He pulled himself up to his full height so that he towered over Moriarty, and even John felt the urge to take a step back. "Get
The heat of a blush filled John's face, and he opened his mouth to protest at the snide remark, when the sincerity of the man's growing smile struck him. "Impressed?" he asked.
"They'll be booked in at Lehman Street," Richardson said. "Do you want to begin the interrogations, Mr Holmes?"
"Something like that," John said, thumping his heels against the cupboard. Sherlock was looking particularly delectable, even in his unkempt, slightly mad state. Actually, especially when he was a little mad. John had been hooked from the first minute of shaky mobile phone video; the sight of Sherlock verbally tearing a manager apart had been like catnip. He shouldn't be doing that here, and John was glad he hadn't had to experience it directly, but Sherlock in a snit was a tiny bit sexy. "Just want to see how you all are doing," John said. "How everyone's getting along? It looks like it's going well, eh?"
Sherlock grudgingly showed the crew into the restaurant kitchen to perform the final—and, as John reminded him, legally necessary—installation work, while John laid out the plastic drop cloth in the dining room in preparation of the repaint. Mrs Hudson had been glad to see the wallpaper go, and even happier to help patch once it had been torn away, and now it was John's duty to paint the whole room white so that they could pick a final colour. Sherlock was pulling for an aubergine that John knew would make the room as crypt-like as before, but they hadn't come to blows over it yet. Personally, he was hoping for a shade of red.
Lestrade went, and a moment later the clamour in the kitchen quieted. John peeled the rag away from Paul's hand and winced at the new flow of blood that welled up. The knife tip had caught Paul in the middle of his palm under his ring finger and sliced down towards his wrist. John could see the layer of fat under his skin that made up the meat of his palm. He swallowed hard against his gag reflex.
The scar was bigger than Sherlock could see right away; just the edge of it was visible beneath John's shirt. It was pinker than the rest of John's shoulder, shiny, and it was smooth beneath his tongue. Sherlock traced the edge of it, feeling a shiver run through John's body, and kissed the new skin softly. John breathed in sharply through his nose. Sherlock pushed himself up again, sitting heavily on John's lap, and John let go of him to cross his arms and pull the bottom of his shirt up.
"I love you, and I've always loved you, and I am determined to spend the rest of my life with you, and if you object of course I understand, and I won't force you to do anything you don't want, because causing you any sort of harm is abhorrent to me; the idea that—"
"Yes indeed," I agreed, my arms around his shoulders. He smelled of wine and smoke and the faint impression of his soap, applied so many hours ago. We'd worked hard these past few days, and the stubble of his facial hair scratched at my neck. I felt the sensation all over my body.
"Ready?" he asked. "Holmes, I… I will be very careful, but if you want me to stop at any point, just… please say so."
"I always wanted to do cakes," she said, nervously pushing the hair that escaped her ponytail behind her ear. "So I dropped out of Uni after my second year, studying English—" she laughed, as if she'd been conditioned to do it, and covered her mouth to stop herself. "—and took up cooking school."
I had long suspected Holmes of having leanings in that particular direction. He had never had an interest in women, beyond his professional interest in their personal and mysterious affairs, and often I found him confused and aloof in their presence. He was not unkind or dismissive, he clearly saw women as important and independent creatures, but the way he had lived his life had not intentionally included them.
Hesitating, Sherlock took another big bite of his food and chewed with intention. John was content to wait. Finally Sherlock said, "A few years ago I... left London for a while. Went to the country."
John loved the intensity of that gaze. It was unnerving and flattering at the same time. It made him blush. He was blushing now, alone in bed in the dark, and he felt the heat suffusing his whole body. He wasn't drunk anymore when he put his hand down his shorts.
The time allotted for the starter challenge raced by. John and Sherlock walked around, observing, asking questions, trying to assess the skill and character of each of the cooks. Two of the five groups were doing a vegetarian option— Hopkins and MacDonald had found the beetroot, and Morton and Gregory had chosen an aubergine— while one was doing seafood— Patterson and Bradstreet had chosen prawns— and the last two did meat— chicken for Dimmock and Gregson, and lamb for the trio of Barton, Forbes, and Montgomery. It was a good mix, and John approved. He couldn't quite tell what Sherlock was thinking, but he stopped to watch the lamb starter being prepared, and paused twice to sneer at the prawns as they were carefully hand-folded into their thin pastry parcels.
"Should we consider combining our bedrooms?" I asked, climbing off him and helping him up. He picked up our waistcoats off the floor.
"Come here," he said, pulling on my shoulders so that I would rise up and cover him with my body. My cock slid in the mess I had made of the apex of his thighs. Holmes wrapped his arms and legs around me, pressing his face into my neck, and I held him as he caught his breath.
By the time he reached the downstairs hall, Sherlock was in the darkened sitting room, looking out the front windows. The line of his back was impassive and ramrod straight, until he moved and turned to look at John, and everything about him softened. He was silhouetted in the window by the street lights beyond, and John took a step into the sitting room without thinking.
"What, come 'round and been a dick to you in front of your partner and your staff? I don't think it'll get you anywhere. He's a restaurant reviewer, not a criminal mastermind." John sighed. "Sherlock, forget it. He'll write what he's going to write, and we'll deal with it when it comes out. It's not life-or-death."
"No," Sherlock said again, staring up at the ceiling, despair written on his face, "I don't hate them. I just— I don't love any of them. It's too hard. They're too different. There are too many possibilities, too many combinations. Too many unknowns."
He fit right into the whirl of the kitchen, here between Sherlock and Toni, the line cooks around them, with Molly on the other side of the room and Lestrade moving in and out of the dining room in John's stead. He moved a little more slowly than the others did, but they only hassled him enough to keep him going. His arm did start to ache after the first hour, his left little finger going numb, but Sherlock noticed at once and set him to refilling the piping bags and cracking the glass crisps into shards. As soon as his hand felt normal again, Sherlock had him back on the line, plating meals and adding garnishes right before the plates went out the door.
There was a rumble of agreement, most of it enthusiastic. John couldn't say for sure about the agency staff, but they were always lukewarm at best. They hadn't been hired specifically to do this job, anyway, so John didn't blame them. Either they'd come 'round or they'd move on. He had his eye on a few, though, that he hoped he'd be able to convince to stay.
"Slow," I said, and he obeyed, rocking his hips deep but not fast. I could feel every inch of his long cock, and I tugged on my own prick with more fervour. My hand was slick, moving easily up and down my aching length. "Holmes!" I gasped.
I let go of his dressing down and slipped my hands beneath, instead, tugging his shirt out of the back of his trousers. The touch of my palms against his bare skin made him moan. I pulled him up for another deep kiss, and he began to unfasten the buttons on my shirt.
John got up from his chair. "It was just a dream, Sherlock. I'm not having second thoughts." He stepped across the rug and took Sherlock's hands. "Come on. It's almost four. We need to be up in six hours to open our bloody restaurant."
Such was my expectation when he shook my shoulder, forty-nine hours into our investigation of the wayward hatter. I was roused from a light sleep on the settee in the sitting room at Baker Street. A glance at the clock on the mantle told me it was just gone three in the morning.
John jolted awake, drenched in sweat, breathing so hard he could barely get any air. There was a sob caught in his throat, but he held it there, swallowed around it, bit it back. His left hand was numb. When he tried to lift his hands to his face, it refused to cooperate. He struggled to a sitting position and dragged that hand into his lap with the other, prying open his own fingers and bending his elbow to get the blood moving again.
We went back through the park arm in arm, but this time my walking stick did not touch the ground. Holmes held my hand against his side with a firm press of his elbow, leading me at twice the pace he had set on our way in. We were back at Baker Street in just a few minutes.
Sherlock laughed again and leaned down so that his hands bracketed John's elbows and his elbows framed John's back. His hips moved in a slow circular grind, and John heard himself whimper. Sherlock lowered himself until his lips touched John's scarred shoulder. John was entirely surrounded by him: the smell and heat of his body, the strength of his arms and legs, the length of his cock. Sherlock pushed back up with a grunt, and the rhythm of his hips changed again to short, shallow thrusts. John let himself be buffeted by the motion, enjoying the lassitude of having already come, relishing the continued stimulation. The arousal hadn't gone away, and his cock was fattening up again between his thighs. Sherlock's breath was warm on his back.
They handed in their coats at the coat check and Sherlock led the way through the foyer. John caught glimpses of the overwhelming swan theme, the emblem of the Vintners, and then they were in the great hall, windows stretching up above them and ancient livery flags looming above the huge glass cases of old company silver. This was where London’s winemakers had met and dined since the fifteenth century. This was
He reaches down, gets a grip on my shirtfront, and hauls me to my feet. In a moment we are spun around, and I am flat against the door. He steals the air right from my lungs with a kiss, deep and keen. He tastes himself in my mouth and groans. His bare prick rubs against my trousers, which can’t be comfortable, but the pressure on my neglected prick makes me shake.
"The jus can be for a salad, as a dressing," John suggested. Sherlock tipped him a smile. John returned it and leaned back in the chair. The rungs dug into his back. He bent forward again to untie and slip off his shoes.
My "shh!" is indistinct, but the message is conveyed. The next noise I hear Holmes make is muffled, probably by a mouthful of quilt.
Sherlock bared his teeth, his nostrils flaring, but John glared right back. After a moment, Sherlock deflated a little. Then, without a word, he turned on his heel and was out the back door before John could blink.
John showed Jim and the photographer, Sebastian, around the kitchen, dodging the sous-chefs who were now opening and liquefying shellfish and cryo-freezing root vegetables. He pointed out the more unique equipment: the emulsifier, the homogenizer, the centrifuge and rotary evaporator Sherlock loved so much. He'd been talking solo for about ten minutes, explaining the uses of each machine as best he understood them, before he realised Sherlock had vanished. He should be here showing off for the reviewers, giving them more information than John ever could about his plans, but he was nowhere to be found.
Not yet. Reviews might make or break their first few weeks of business, but they were going to get more than from just Moriarty or the
Three days later, Sherlock was on the verge of regretting his convictions. They had started to rearrange the kitchen equipment, and John absolutely refused to let him have his rotary evaporator, freeze dryer, and dehydrator in the middle of the kitchen where they belonged.
"We're going home," I said, and rose to my feet. "Thank you, Chief Inspector. I'll be in touch. Come, Watson."
Paul got up on shaky legs. A second EMT pushed her way past John and Anderson, sliding in under Paul's other arm to give him some support as they led him outside. Through the open door to the alley, John could see the flashing lights of the ambulance. It hadn't made any noise in its approach, thank God. They didn't need to make any kind of news for anything but their food just yet. He watched as Paul was carefully seated on a gurney and strapped in, and then lifted into the ambulance. The doors closed.
His cock jerked as my fingers encircled it. It filled my grip; my jaw ached just thinking about sucking him. My heart was pounding. He returned the favour, moving one hand down my chest, pausing to pinch my nipples until I gasped and then taking my raging prick in his hand. I wanted everything all at once, and yet I knew I would hardly last long enough. I prayed that this wasn't the only time I'd get to feel him come to glory.
Sherlock slumped over the notebook and then flung himself backwards into a sprawl of epic dramatic effect. "
"My dear fellow," said I, pulling back the blankets. He climbed nimbly in and pressed himself alongside my body. His hands and feet were rather cold, but I embraced him all the same. He pressed a kiss to my cheek, a little rough with stubble due to the hour, and then my mouth, his lips warm and soft.
Sherlock gave him a squeeze instead and looked down at where his cock was moving in and out.  John felt his face heat and had to look back down at the bed. Sherlock was quiet, only his ragged breathing giving away how close he was. John jerked his cock a little faster; he couldn't catch up to Sherlock, but he could feel the pleasure coiling up again. Sherlock's rhythm was gradually speeding up, despite his attempts to pace himself to John's request. The room was thick with the smell of sex, the scent of shampoo layered underneath it.
He picked up his scalding tea and blew across the top of it. "I haven't even agreed to open a restaurant with you," he said as he put it down again.
reason, nor would they respect the choice. Marriage was for lovers. All the people who had fought long and hard in the courts would have disdained us for taking advantage of the institution.
I had told Watson it was a marriage of convenience. Even on that very night, I had very nearly let him think it was his own pragmatical idea. I hadn't been honest, not even about the godforsaken rings. I squeezed my fingers together, feeling the hard press of the ring between them; I didn't want to take it off, not for anything. How could I have done this to myself? How could I live life letting him think it was a friendship made solid, and not my deepest desire come to life? How much a coward was I?
"It would distract you from the real work we have to do, which is proving that arsehole wrong. Although, honestly, the whole thing is weirdly restrained. He didn't have a go at our personal lives nearly as much as I thought he was going to."
I thought this scene would move along as quickly as the others, but the boys decided the Oxford fashion wasn’t satisfying and frig each other instead, face to face. There was a great deal of description of their long staffs rubbing together; I returned my attention to my cock, circling the head with my fingers and smearing the fluid around. I jerked myself quickly as the narrator and his friend kissed and masturbated one another, suddenly certain that I could finish with them. I was close, my cock growing even harder in my hand, the tip rosy and gleaming.
Of course, they did have business in the Park, which was, I suspected, why Inspector Lestrade had called upon me to take over the case. He was a sympathetic sort who looked past a man's proclivities and preferences in a bedmate. He knew the victims were visiting male prostitutes, but bringing me on separated him one degree from the truth of it. If I could identify and find the perpetrator, the opportunistic nature of the crimes might fade into the background.
Sherlock's mouth quirked up in a smile, and he dipped his head slightly in acquiescence. "Fair enough," he said. "Hungry?"
"Come in," Holmes said, automatically, before either of us had a chance to think what it might look like. At least we were decent in our shirtsleeves and drawers.
The machine moves suddenly, as if awoken from a dream, and turns away from the water. I don't meet its unnatural, uncomfortably familiar gaze as I trudge back up toward the cliff. It doesn't say anything as we climb the long staircase, but I can hear the metallic whir of its joints. Is it powered by combustion? Electricity? It has no tubes or cords; its body is entirely self-contained. It moves like a human, but nothing can disguise its gleaming exterior or its bone-crushing strength.
Sherlock was standing with his arms crossed, so John crossed his as well, and Sebastian arranged them standing almost back to back, with John's shoulder in front of Sherlock's. He crouched low and took a few shots from there, and then a few more straight on while Moriarty smirked behind him. Then he made John put his hands on his hips, and took a few more. They did some nonsense with some kitchen props, holding them menacingly, and then Sherlock reached the end of his tether.
worried about how Sherlock would react at the moment, with Sherlock between his knees, mouthing at John's erection through his jeans. He gave Sherlock's curls a stroke, dragging his fingertips against Sherlock's scalp and re-settling his grip. Sherlock's sigh penetrated through the layers of his jeans and pants, heating his skin. He tipped his head back against the door, breathless.
The party was tolerable, but I always felt that way about gatherings this size. It would have been more interesting if Watson and I were not the center of attention, or if there were more strangers to observe in attendance, but it was all our acquaintances and friends and there were only a few new points of interest about anyone to pick up on. There wasn't even a crime scene to investigate. I stuck close to Watson as we were moved around the room and congratulated, and held a drink in my hand without drinking it. Occasionally Watson would find my elbow and give it a little squeeze. I suppose he thought I needed some reassurance, or perhaps it was he who needed it.
I awoke one morning after a long, drawn-out case with a bone-deep feeling of lassitude, the sun spilling through a gap in the curtains, and the pillow next to mine already cool. I could hear the gentle splash of water in the basin on the dressing table, and the clink of metal against the ceramic bowl. I smelled Watson’s soap, newly frothed, and breathed in deeply as I stretched my arms over my head.
He harrumphs and I can hear the pillow rustling. When I fit him back between my lips, his moan is reduced to a rumble.
“I am also interested,” he said, “in the difference in rising time. I have it written down… bugger, where is my notebook?”
His collar comes loose in my other hand, and I open the first three buttons of his shirt. I release his mouth and turn my attention to the column of his throat; his jaw, shaved that morning, prickles against my cheek. His pulse races beneath my lips. I bite down here, too, and wish I could raise a mark. Once I covered him with little bitten bruises, sucked the blood to the surface and embarrassed him. No one else ever saw them, but he blushed like a girl when I touched them. I wish I could be so blatant. No one would so much as look at him if they knew.
He looked at me, the shadow of his hat falling half across his face. "Is that why you married me?" he asked. "Because I suited you?"
back: not his youth nor his old age. But could I be satisfied with a simulacrum? Is it close enough? I will not be rid of it. Now that it knows our secret, I do not want it replaced or destroyed. It is almost a comfort, to think that we know something no one else has bothered to learn.
"Res—? Oh!" He was giving me a significant look. I drew out my pocket watch. "Why, noon, my dear boy."
Holmes released his hand from my hair and grabbed the middle of the back of my nightshirt instead. "Get rid of this," he said.
"Thank you," said I. "And Doctor Watson will be staying the night. I am hoping to convince him to let the second bedroom."
Sherlock was shaking hands with the sommelier and speaking to her in low, smooth French. John had taken a little French in school, and a basic understand was essential in the cooking world, but Sherlock’s French went well beyond that; he had studied in Paris, John remembered. He spoke with the ease of a native. John stepped up behind him to hear better, and heard his name at once as Sherlock indicated him.
. Those unpredictable hours are running you ragged. You barely see your wife, who, by the way, isn't taking it as hard as you thought— or she's taking it
John sighed, skimming his hands up Sherlock's back to rest on his shoulder blades, his embrace heavy and comfortable. He slid one hand into Sherlock's hair at the base of his skull, combing through the curls, and Sherlock couldn't stifle the moan of anticipation, even with John's collarbone between his teeth. John chuckled, the sound resonating in his throat, and gave a little tug. Pleasure rippled down Sherlock's spine. He let himself be moved, guided to lave his tongue over John's Adam's apple and along the slope of his shoulder, until he felt John tense underneath him.
Holmes sighed and I broke the kiss to rub my moustache along the side of his jaw to make him squirm. Squirm he did. I pressed whiskery kisses to his neck and throat, working my way down the open collar of his shirt as he murmured. His fingers moved in my hair, caressing my scalp. He tipped his chin up to give me room, and I turned my attention to the buttons on his shirt. His collar was long gone. I parted the lapels of his shirt and pushed his vest up to expose his narrow chest with its dusting of dark hair, his soft, pink nipples.
"I want you to fuck me like this," Sherlock said, squirming on John's cock and relishing the way John's eyelashes fluttered.
. Sherlock knew Jim Moriarty. He'd had some kind of run in with him before. Had Moriarty given Sherlock a bad review in the past? The photographer snapped a photograph unexpectedly; John blinked in the flash.
John took Sherlock by the elbow, removed the knife from his hand, and guided him to sit down in the office. "You are going to fall down dead," he said, "and then what will your line cooks think of you?"
"No, something's definitely burning. Where's Sherlock?" Sherlock was at the flat, doing an experiment, refining a process. They were supposed to take photos of the food for the website tomorrow. He'd wanted to start getting it ready the night before. "I have to warn Sherlock."
of criticism, the accusation that he was callous or unfeeling or insane, but then at least the slurs were more general and not directly related to his cooking. He also only did it to superiors or equals, never to anyone beneath him. In the videos John had seen, Sherlock would berate the commis chefs working at his station, but it was only ever about the food. Waiters, too, never got a dressing down, only a sharp word if they made an obvious mistake. The head chef, however, or the back of house manager, or the occasional entitled customer, took both barrels in the face.
Although, if he planned on driving her out, he could have done it already. One word to John—one deliberate word, and none of this sneering and mumbling—and John would let her go. No, it wasn’t as simple as all that. John had even caught Sherlock chatting with her a few times… how else would they have discussed the ice spheres and the jelly booze? No, the sticking place was John.
John fought a smile. "You do realise how much you sound like a boy buying sweets on an allowance, don't you?"
Some people of a certain standing see a moderately well-off widower, a physician with a greater reputation for his romantic fiction than his bedside manner, and believe that such a fellow could only lack for a wife. An eligible man remade a bachelor such as he, they reason, must surely hope to be claimed sooner or later by a newer, younger, suitable distraction from his bereavement.
"Right," John said, when the cooks were all paired up (John chucked Montgomery in with Barton and Forbes, since Jones was gone) and had finished introducing themselves to one another. "If you need help, let me or Chef know. We want you to show us your best work, so don't panic. If you get into a bind, just call one of us over. Again, you can use anything you find, except what's in the second fridge and the freezer at the back. Those are for later. Okay? Go ahead."
as bad as the videos showed, even when he was in control instead of chafing under the yoke of someone else's ideas, then John would wash his hands of him.
Harry was still talking, all the while plucking off bits of dough, rolling it between her hands, and flattening it carefully on the countertop. They didn't have a tortilla press, so she was making do. She turned the dough and flattened again, turned and flattened, and then peeled it up carefully and passed it a few times between her hands before she laid it gently on the griddle. John heard the griddle hiss, and the cameraman leaned in to get a closer shot. Harry watched as the tortilla crisped, and then she peeled it off and flipped it over.
That was enough. I rocked back on my heels and managed to get to standing without too much additional effort. Holmes let go of my hair and planted his hand on the worktop. I took aim, cock-head kissing against his loosened hole, and pushed in.
Watson steps towards me. He clanks as he moves and I flinch, despite myself. He reaches out and brushes his warm fingers down the outside of my arm, and gathers my hand in his. His grip is deliberately gentle.
He didn't need to ask what the matter was: Paul Dimmock was holding a quickly reddening rag around his hand, and Sherlock was mopping blood up off the prep table. John stuck his head through the service window, summoning Lestrade, and then grabbed Paul by the elbow and pulled him to the office where the first aid kit was tacked to the wall outside the door. Paul was white-faced and sweating, and the blood dripped through his fingers. John sat him down in the office chair and knelt, kit in hand.
Hot water appeared, and I barely looked at the maid as she bobbed and vanished again. Watson let me clean the scrape on his shoulder and his cheek, and wash the blood out of his hair. He winced as the touch of my fingers, but soon his soft, blond hair was clean and damp, and the water faintly pink. I cleaned his split lip, too, and saw that his eyes were welling up again.
"All right," John said, dislodging Sherlock's grip but brushing his fingers down Sherlock's arm as he went, so it wasn't a complete dismissal. "Can we— Not now? It doesn't matter."
Greg waved a hand. “It’s just Sherlock. Should have known he’d be here. Didn’t expect to see you, though!”
“You’ll ruin this pair of trousers if you stay like this,” I replied. He gave me a push, struggled upright, pulling his apron over his head, and turned around to face me. His face was a blotchy sort of red and he had flour streaked across it and up into his shamefully disheveled hair. He looked ridiculous, and he pinched my nipple unerringly through my shirt when I started to giggle. He stopped my laughter more completely with a deep, slow kiss. I pinned him once again to the worktop, only this time it was face to face and we were both over-sensitive and prone to skittishness.
"Just fine, thanks," Sarah said. "I'll probably head out around three, so I can get to work by five."
“I really am sorry,” I said, after a few moments, “if the interruption has cost you. I’ll cover it.”
Sherlock backed off a little. He eased a second finger in beside the first but didn't press as deep, just working them in and out to loosen John's rim. He was still stroking John, somewhat erratically, but John could feel the first glimmer of his orgasm approaching. He leaned forward and braced his hands on the wall, taking a few inches of shower curtain with him. This tub wasn't designed for two people to fool around in it, but John was damned if that was going to stop them.
The drawers came down with ease, and he was trapped. His prick pushed against the fabric of his apron, and I prayed to God it would leave a mark. I slid my palms up Holmes’s firm thighs, ruffling the sparse hair the wrong direction. His legs were spread just enough that I could wiggle my thumb between and rub his heavy bollocks. He pushed back and I heard him gasp. By now I expected him to be hiding his face in his forearms.
Instead, Sherlock said, "Well, I'll print this anyway," and then John heard him tapping at the keys of the laptop. He glanced at the clock as he poured a fresh cup.
He rolled onto his back at once, flopping down beside me and pushing himself into my grip. His prick was already dripping, and it slid easily through my fist. I jerked him quickly, pinching his nipples with my other hand. He moaned and gasped, the tension in his body ratcheting up, and it didn't take long before he was clutching at my wrist and grinding out a warning.
I'm sweating and my own prick is rigid; in this position it rubs against my own belly and my bollocks hang heavy between my spread thighs. Holmes's hand finds my head again, stroking my hair and carding it away from my eyes.
"How's your menu looking?" John asked, sliding onto a bar stool and putting his elbows on the bar. She and Sherlock had been working on a list of cocktails and Sherlock had taught her several of the techniques the cooks in the kitchen were currently implementing.
Mike put up his hands in a placating gesture. "I know, sorry. Eighteen months isn't any time at all."
In a heavy pea soup fog such as the city was known for, Holmes and I waited outside a warehouse at the St Catherine docks that was full of smuggled and stolen goods. The police were on the inside of the massive bolted doors, anticipating the return of the stolen goods' temporary owners, but Holmes, ever the sceptic, wanted to be certain our quarry would not slip the trap. He and I were crouched behind a wall of barrels opposite the doors, the contents of which could only be pickled herring, given the smell.
Beside me, Watson is cold and still. My heart skips a beat and I turn over to grab at him, shaking him. Not again. Please, I can't, not again.
My breath catches in my throat. This is madness. I want it. I lean forward and my lips meet his. How can they feel so normal? When he speaks, his mouth moves as a human's does; why expect this to be different?
"I'm not—" John started, with a sigh of annoyance that was more at his last hour than at Sherlock. "No."
He laughed a breathless laugh. "Hold still," he said, and brushed his lips against mine, at the same time rubbing my cock head against his. It sent pleasure arcing through me. Our tips kissed, the shy heads bumping and rubbing. I could feel mine grow bold, the sheath pulling back. Watson broke the kiss to look down into the water between us, so I kissed the side of his face, his ear, the prickly hinge of his jaw. He huffed and put his other hand into the water.
Most of them were from strangers, people who must have read about us, and then this, in the press. A few of them were from old clients, sending good wishes to a man who had saved their life, or career, or reputation. A particularly ostentatious white and pink arrangement was from Holmes's brother, but the note only said
Sherlock glared at the brightly lit window, skeptical to the end. "John, isn't this a terribly American fad?"
When I could catch my breath, Holmes was gazing down at me. His hand rested gingerly on my ribs. I lifted my chin to kiss him and then reached for his prick again.
" Sherlock groaned, but as he started to pull away, John hooked his heels around the backs of Sherlock's knees to keep him in place. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist and nuzzled in against Sherlock's throat.
Sherlock's smile, though genuine, looked painful. He shook his head, then slapped the laptop closed and put it aside. "Lay on, Macduff, but don't say I didn't warn you."
I slid my knee over his, bringing our hips closer together. "You're right that you'll be the first, but I've come to terms with the idea. Just…" I let my voice grow breathy, "be gentle with me."
"I haven't just lied to him, have I?" John asked, as Sherlock grimaced at the burn. "You're not… you're all right, aren't you?" Despite Moriarty's pointed remarks in their kitchen, cocaine wasn't exactly an uncommon substance in the food business; the long hours a kitchen demanded, the high levels of stress, the constant litany of 'go faster, do better, push harder.' John had known more than a few chefs over the years who did lines in the toilets to keep their chins up. He'd never liked it, though he'd ignored Harry's alcohol abuse long enough. It wasn't his place, really. Except that Sherlock was his partner, and he felt like he needed to do better by him than he had by Harry.
I shrugged one shoulder and reached for a hand towel stowed under the bed. "I'm sure I don't know," said I, mopping my belly, "but I daresay you enjoyed it."
Sherlock stared down at him. John stared back, his smile fading into serious contemplation. Then Sherlock said, "That one's true."
"I really am feeling much better, myself," he said. "I fear I have not properly expressed my gratitude to you."
After our luncheon, he said, "I'm sending you home, John. I have a thread I'd like to follow, but I fear it may turn out to be nothing. I'm not going to waste your time with it."
"Can't remember?" he asked, adjusting his collar and, with a self-consciousness that made me blush, the distorted line of his trousers. "How much can't you remember?"
Then, because he was out in the dining room already, Sherlock made a reluctant round of all the occupied tables and said hello to the crowd of family and friends that had turned up for their first night open.
His stone is crooked and faded. Almost two hundred years have passed since I bought it and had it installed, and the years show badly. It was broken once and glued back together. At least someone has some sense of respect for their elders.
"I'll daresay you did," she muttered, gathering up the wet towels and putting them into the basket. "I'll send up a few more towels so you can mop up the rest."
I obliged, pushing up onto my knees to let him pull it over my head, and then freeing my arms and tossing the fabric aside. My prick bobbed, half-hard, and Holmes stroked a hand down my belly to close his fingers around it. He gave it a friendly tug, and then let go to wriggle out of his own nightshirt. Then he reached up to pull me down atop him again. I still straddled his thigh, but now my erection pressed against his belly and our bare skin rubbed together deliciously. He kissed me hard, opening my lips with his tongue and getting a grip on my hair once more to tilt me to his satisfaction.
“Rather,” I agreed. I kissed him again and then, reluctantly, pulled myself upright. He had closed his eyes again and looked ready to sleep right there. I shook him. “Get up,” I ordered. “You’re sleeping in a bed tonight, so help me God.”
"Oh God, Watson," he said in my ear, the most beautiful words I’d ever heard, "I beg you will take your time, lest I come off early and disappoint you."
Sherlock was standing in the kitchen, a slab of hardwood in each hand, atop which smoked an array of artisan mushrooms. He met John's eyes as John ascended and gave him a look that managed to combine relief and disdain.
When he had moaned to Mike Stamford that no one would start a restaurant with him, he could never have predicted this turn of events. He’d just been griping, honestly, to one of the only sympathetic listeners he could find. It was a good rant and he’d been glad enough not to waste it on the skull. Mike had nodded and “hmm”ed at all the appropriate places, and then turned up four hours later with an old chum from culinary school.
“He was taken in last night for prostitution. I need you to come in and tell the Chief Inspector he’s your assistant.”
Sherlock lifted his face and stared into John's eyes. His pupils were still huge, and his lips were red, his mouth well used. His hair was a wreck. He pushed off the wall and stepped back— staggered, really— and looked down at himself in surprise. As if he hadn't expected this to be the result. He tucked himself clumsily back into his trousers and did them up.
"Sherlock," he said, after a table full of malbecs and cabernet savignons, "if you'd let us go for a proper drink, rather than trick me into doing an important tasting, we could stop for a minute and put something in our stomachs. Chips, maybe. We're doing this half of the room a disservice."
"It's gaudy," Sherlock said, rolling his eyes at the ceiling. "It's going to ruin the surprise when we do it for a dozen tables at once. No—" as John opened his mouth to protest, "people
I stroked my fingertips up and down his wet inner lips, pushing in slowly and testing his readiness. One finger sank in easily, up to the knuckle, so I worked that in and out while I nibbled and kissed his throat. His collarbones have always been of particular interest to me, so I spent some time appreciating them. With my thumb, made slippery by his excitement, I teased his clitoris until I could feel the stiffened nub of it easily.
Toni Gregson took over Dimmock's spot, so John filled in where she had been. The piping bag of centrifuged pea butter was leaking onto the pictures of all the courses in "Track 2: Fish & Chips" that were cling-wrapped to the prep table beneath. The plates were already set out, so John picked up the bag, glanced again at the demo, and began piping. The motion was smooth and easy, the feel of the bag in his hand familiar, and in a minute the plates were all ready for their next element. John looked up at Sherlock for guidance.
He didn't answer, but the tension in his body made me reach for my revolver. It was heavy in my hand, the chambers full and ready to fire. Holmes coiled like a spring beside me, and then I heard it: the sound of several pairs of hard-soled boots on stone, and the low murmur of voices. His hand clenched on my knee in excitement.
The list of restaurants he had worked at since receiving his culinary degree was in the double digits, thanks to his abrasive personality and crippling need to be right all the time, and a slew of articles John found from various foodie magazines—
"Lady Duncan!" I echoed, and we drank again. The wine was a medium-bodied dry red, with a bouquet of plum and chocolate, and was certainly being wasted on us at this point.
"They wouldn't arrest a London detective for indecent behavior," Holmes sighs, tracing patterns on my chest.
John snorted, thumping his head back against the wall. His stomach still churned. "Me? Fill in for you? I could never fill your shoes. You're a madman and a genius, and I'm just… I'm a washed-up fool who can't stand the smell of smoke. I don't belong in a kitchen. Jesus, Sherlock."
"No, you’re right," I gasped, "I take it back." Six weeks we’d been apart, and I felt my body would take days to adjust to having him back.
He waited until John had set his plate aside, stacked his own on top, and then stepped onto the coffee table and slid into John's lap.
"Quite right," said he, pushing himself up again. We giggled, and then he knelt deliberately between my thighs and parted them with his warm hand.
My brother asked me about my case as we ate, to ease the way. I told him about the diplomat, his unusual and erratic behavior, and my suspicions about the company he was keeping. Then I had to tell him about infiltrating the club, eavesdropping and asking too many questions, and getting into a scuffle. That, of course, led to our dash from the police, at which Mycroft rolled his eyes hard enough to give himself a headache, and the final result: that I had kissed John Watson in public.
John called the five chefs on his way to the Lamb and Flag, and each of them agreed to be at 221 at half eight the next morning. He didn't actually know if Sherlock had anything planned for them yet, but if Sherlock was going to spring things on John like that he'd better be prepared to follow through.
"It's mutual," John admitted. "She doesn't pick up when I ring, but then I don't ring. I get an email once in awhile from Clara, carbon-copied to the whole family, letting us know how she's doing, but… I'm not really keeping tabs, honestly."
He nodded. As we walked up the street in that direction, he quietly took hold of my upper arm and I bent my elbow to give him a place to rest. We were quiet for a while, arm in arm, but finally as we crossed a bridge in the park he said, "I trust your brother is well."
I can feel the truth of it; his body is warmer than it was when I awoke. I snuggle back against him, turning my head to look over my shoulder. "I will have to accustom myself to your altered state."
“It’s not rocket science.” Sherlock was standing with his back to John now, his hands fisted in his hair. His ribs were heaving.
I kissed his ear and squeezed his shoulders. “Some of us were exhausted by our efforts,” I said, breathing in the smell of his tobacco and his pomade and soap, “and those of our dearest companion.”
"No," Sherlock said. "I've got that all sorted. Deconstructed caprese salad: balsamic caviar, olive oil suspension, mozzarella foam, and tomato-basil spaghetti."
I nudged him toward the bed, and we undressed ourselves as we went, until we were down to the skin. The room was chilly with no fire in the grate, so Holmes and I climbed quickly under the quilts and embraced, limbs entwined and cocks bumping together.
The swelling had gone down overnight and the bruise was slight, just shadowing the soft skin under my eye. "It's fine," I said. "I'll just— give me a few minutes."
"No, it's wonderful," Sherlock said, reaching out with one long arm and patting John's calf. "Chocolate and foie are
It was a brief kiss, and not very elegantly done. I wasn't in a state to react quickly, and it was over almost before I had realized what happened. He laughed, delighted with himself, and embraced me again. His arms were warm and strong, and the sensation of his body against mine– the press of his chest, the dig of his chin into my shoulder– was delightful.
Another time, I might have drawn the experience out, really teased and tempted him with the knife edge of glory. Instead, given that it was only a few hours until dawn and we had work to do, I knew it was my duty to bring him off quickly. I sat back, scooting out from beneath him, and bent my head to take the tip of his prick in my mouth.
“Washed out, I guess,” he said with a slight shrug. “You have to admit we’re all a bit gray in here.”
" 'I'm very rarely wrong'," John parroted back to himself, thinking of the smug grin on Sherlock's lips when he had explained exactly how 'easy' this leaving the army thing was supposed to be.
As soon as he answered, a worried voice said, “I’ve been calling for a week, and you haven’t answered.”
itched with the lack of Sherlock’s feelings at the back of it. He could still tell where his mate was, in a general directional sense of things, but nothing more reassuring came through.
“Didn’t sound like-” the sergeant said as he stepped into the doorway, and then whistled, “yeah that didn’t sound like just your hand.”
Sherlock closed his mouth, frowning. It only lasted a moment before he said, “This is no way to make up, John. I can’t apologize if I’m being silent. Why would you ask for that, of all things?”
Sherlock huffed, shifting the two of them so he could stretch out beside John. Level with his mate, John found that even if they were fighting, it still felt nice to have Sherlock up against him.
John wasn't sure how to feel about having his lies made more believable, but there wasn't a better answer for it. He wasn’t feeling terribly optimistic about the entire orchestration of his return. No, that wasn’t it, he felt off… inexplicably
One of the neighbors had called in a noise disturbance, and then when a second neighbor was coming home the blood on the entryway was found. When the CSO arrived - the PCO had got there first, the man at the door said - expecting a heated domestic, she had happened upon the… situation within.
This time when John caught Sherlock's wrist it was gentle, because he understood. The whole world had fallen out when he'd seen blood in the snow around Sherlock. And then he'd felt his stomach turn into a knot when he'd seen Sherlock stumble in the snow towards the chopper, covered in blankets.
Before either of them realized he was at it, he pushed past Sherlock and marched for the bedroom door.
John dumped the box on the floor beside the kitchen bin and went about making enough careful space on the counter, one that wouldn’t rain glassware onto the floor and his bare feet, to get mugs down for tea. He resolved to clean the kitchen or at least organize it to the point where he and Sherlock could both function in tandem while getting use out of it. He filled the old kettle from the tap and set it on the hob. In retaliation for being deprived of yet another electric kettle, John turned the burner up all the way.
Rather than do or say anything untoward, John found a seat on one of the couches and tried not to think about his reaction to them, or the sheer number of relations he seemed to have gained. The wolves were all vibrant and outspoken, and
Somewhere during the tour of Bart’s, which had changed some, and filled with a fresh wave of ‘bright, young things’, Stamford had once again become Mike in John’s mind. He had always been an affable man, easy to get along with and unobtrusive. John found he was just as easy in his presence as he had been staying up all hours and studying their texts before exams. Mike was a soothing presence, but there was something itching at the back of his mind, something that John had come to associate with
John had been roaming the streets of London for two hours already, asking every homeless person if they knew Sherlock and had seen him, texting Lestrade in case he'd gone to the Met for some reason – but John didn't think so. He'd checked all the places they had gone to together, anything he could think of from the Chinese restaurant to the National Gallery. After an hour of fruitless searching, he was so worried he actually called Mycroft, but the idiot didn't answer his phone – he just replied with a text saying he was busy but would love to see John later in the evening. He'd actually sent one of those black cars after him, John had noticed, and presently a beautiful woman (the
Sherlock chuckled softly as he pictured the fluffy cat attempting to shave his overly plushy face, and the doctor groaned in his sleep. Sherlock froze, persuaded that he'd been too noisy and had managed to wake his flatmate, but John only stirred and did not open his eyes. The detective repressed a sigh of relief, then blinked in fascination as he saw a tuft emerging from John's morning hair. It was funny, he mused. His friend hadn't moved too much during the night, and there had been no nightmare that would have caused agitation. Yet his hair was dishevelled, and now that he'd turned Sherlock could make out on his cheek the mark of a sheet fold. It was so endearingly comical the taller man couldn't help it and this time, just had to
You freeze. By? By what? Bi. Bisexual. Oh. That's good. That's very good. A silly grin spreads across your face.
"To let your petty feelings of resentment and inferiority complex rule your mind and jump on the first occasion you could find to get back to the man who always humiliated you? Good job, you succeeded."
Before he knew it John's hand was back on his arm and had oriented the shower so it would run on Sherlock's head. Sherlock jumped and shut his eyes tight, grimacing under the hot water pouring over him. John tiptoed to push the locks back from his brow, caressing it softly. Sherlock shivered but didn't protest. He wanted nothing but to run away at this moment, yet it all felt surprisingly
It was strange to realise how much had changed since then. No, John did not want a cushion. Maybe he was just too tired to care, but at this point hiding his nakedness from Sherlock really wasn’t his priority.
Yours is so soft. Your head. How can you have such soft hair? Not just your hair. Your face, too. Your cheek. Your lips. Your chin.
The vulnerability John saw in the bare pupils answered his question clearly enough. Although his face and body were as expressionless as ever, the detective's eyes were slowly coming back to life – very, very slowly. At least John could tell he was looking – really looking – at him. He stood back up and moved a few steps away.
"Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see Johnny boy like this?"
Sherlock was puffing airily against the greyish locks of hair. He was scared of his own reactions and terribly confused – but curious, too. Everything John was doing was spurring him to let go and inspired such thrill and energy and sheer exhilaration that he felt impelled to surrender: he was hankering for the touch. His answer came in a sigh.
‘Harold Pinner’s murderer has a very good alibi for last night,’ she said, still smiling. ‘He was unconscious in my bed.’
Sherlock's fingers on his spine were dancing the notes and printing them on the exposed flesh claimingly and urgingly and God, John never wanted them to stop.
John blushes, feeling stupid, but keeps his eyes closed and starts unbuttoning the shirt, his own hands soon roaming his chest. He's glad he's turned the lights off already, or he would've really felt too self-conscious to do this. Softly, a moan escapes his lips as he gets hard from nipple stimulation alone.
said the familiar, warm, loving and beloved voice. Dazzled, shattered, Sherlock briefly wondered if it was that of an angel.
And without further warning she puts the baby in your arms. Harry, who is sorting cutlery in the kitchen with Chris, turns to you with a smile.
Now hair conditioner. Blind, that's definitely what they were. Or just in denial. But she couldn't fathom
Peter is still in shock, too, and keeps staring at you dumbly. You glare, trying to convey the message 'you're making everything so obvious, you idiot', and failing miserably.
John had learned a few things, living with Sherlock. Not becoming flustered and knowing when to lie, for instance.
Nothing came out. John blinked, taken aback. Panic flashed in Sherlock's pupils and he suddenly turned to hide from him, but John had seen it and made him turn slowly back again, holding him by the elbows.
John finished unbuttoning his shirt, feeling his cock stiffen as Sherlock’s eyes raked the length of John again, slow and steady. John had never thought a look could be erotic before he’d mated Sherlock, but there it was, that one right there was just about pornographic. “I want to feel you on every inch of me,” John promised.
John returned to it to find Sherlock with his upper lip curled in a sneer, face tilted away from Milton as though he smelled offensive in some way. Milton was slumped on the couch, head tipped to one side.
When they were done there was less light to make Sherlock’s skin so blinding, and John’s stomach was the grumpy one. He got up, went to the bathroom, and then headed out to the kitchen.
John held back his grimace and retold the therapist what he had told Sergeant Hall. Any caution he’d felt before about maintaining active duty status for anyone involved was muted by the echoing space inside him.
Harry took the seat across from him, and the words between the two of them seemed to just stop. She stared at him like he was some kind of a miracle, some wonderful thing. It was somehow an awkward sort of look, the kind he was only used to from patients in the field, and the sort that Harry had never managed for anyone, to John’s knowledge. He picked up his cup and took a sip of the too-hot coffee.
“About my misconceptions, when we first met.” “The part where you thought I was a personal physician or the part where you were worried I was abusive?” John asked, flicking on the gas.
“Anyone trained to properly observe could do the same,” Sherlock said. “The trouble is that so very few people
Sherlock frowned at the trapped feeling that came with that memory. It had been a desperate urge to escape, one that he’d felt with all the keen senses of the wolf within him.
Sherlock huffed in response to that and tugged free of the sheets to get up. John sat up just enough to realize he shouldn’t be sitting up and that the sun was far too bright and leaned back down, just in time to catch his cell phone in the chest when Sherlock tossed it at him.
John told the story from the folder as best he could remember it. He had his hiccups, places his throat felt too dry to continue, but rather than seeming disingenuous, his responses seemed to authenticate the story. John was glad of it, because he couldn’t do better. The color seemed almost gone out of the world, by then, all leeched away somewhere John couldn’t find it.
be uttered for any reason. Here was this, his mate, and here they fit together as John had never fit with anything in his entire life before.
As the plane neared its destination, John was given a pair of his own tattered fatigues to change into. He tried not to think about how Mycroft had gotten hold of those. Mycroft informed him that he would be shuffled into another group of returning soldiers that had been in military facilities.
Inside number nineteen, Sherlock was curled up on the couch, high as a kite with his nose buried in one of John’s shirts. He did not acknowledge Mycroft’s entrance.
A set of fresh fatigues was folded on the end of the cot on top of the bedding. There were no identifying patches, and they didn’t have his name on them, but they were clean and there weren’t any holes or worn out spots like the ones he was wearing.
"It was a plane up to Siberia, so I couldn't say exactly where we were being held," John said. "It was northwest from Bratsk, but my Russian geography is a bit outdated, so it wouldn't have been useful. I didn't tell you we were in Russia because it didn't come up. You didn't ask if I knew anything, and then I figured whatever plan you had to get out was already aware of it."
What was worse, that detective’s name was a near permanent black spot in Greg’s memory. He thought he covered it well, but it would out eventually. Probably around some sort of review, at the worst moment possible. Some things were inescapable, though. Greg was starting to get used to that about his life. And Detective Spoon was just one of them.
"You're not the first I've had to bed," Sherlock said, stroking his side. "And you weren't the first human thrown into my cell."
“You propose, then, that sex will solve this dispute for some reason based in personal experience?” Sherlock ground out. “Or are you, conversely, attempting to ignore it all — our disagreement, your siding with my brother, the unbearable malaise I am suffering under your disappointment?”
Between the two of them it didn’t take much, even with the mug of coffee that John kept pausing to take grateful swallows of. Once she was dressed, Sherlock hefted her in his arms.
The sergeant took a note, and John withheld a wince and a curse. He wasn’t staying in the service, of course, he had Sherlock and the military would never let the two of them be together the way that civilians could chose to be, but he didn’t need the army to write him off as a nutter.
“Not enough blood,” John replied, the words bubbling up without his authorization for them. Sherlock looked down at him with a winning expression.
Anne resettled the napkin across her lap, reached out and took her glass in hand to sip it before she said, “My grandmother always used to say that some humans could hear our echoes.”
Sherlock made a face. "I think they did." He reached out and touched John's knee with his fingertips, before covering John's kneecap with the whole of his hand. His touch sent a frission of pleasure and warmth through John.
, had meant Sherlock wanted him too. Sherlock had too much going on in his mind, John decided. He'd been overworking himself, and wasn't terribly good with surprises. He'd be fine after a night's sleep. They both would.
“What was he doing in Piccadilly, then, at three this morning, fighting one Mr Gregory of Holloway Road?”
When I'd returned from abroad, and when he'd acquiesced to stay at Baker Street, we'd agreed my departure in Switzerland had been the right thing to do. I knew he'd agreed just to stop our fighting about it. I regretted leaving him behind; I wasn't sure I'd ever said as much to him. I didn't want to admit he was right or face his anger again. After he was done being relieved to see me, he'd been
