rests on his lips for a half-second before he decides that the best course of action is to leave it alone, and his words morph into “how was your afternoon?”
Cas takes note of the appreciative one-over Dean gives him. He bites his bottom lip, smiles, and gestures for Dean to lead the way. "After you. I don't know where I'm going, so."
Sam shrugs. "I gotta talk to a TA. Cas here's brother, apparently. Speaking of which... I should go if I want to catch him soon." He claps Dean on the shoulder. "I love you, man, see you soon."
“Damn right, I always do,” Dean mumbles, taking his book back. Cas rolls his eyes, laughing.
“So is me not flunking out of college,” Dean sighs.
"What is it?" Cas asks, noticing the hesitance on Dean's face, "is there a reason we shouldn't go back to our apartment?"
Cas's hand goes to cup Dean's cheek, like he did on stage. "Dean, why won't you let me help you?"
"Oh," Dean says, thinking about it, "yeah, I guess you did. Thanks for that."
Dean smiles, "let's go," he agrees, driving back to their apartment with the music on loud and a huge smile on his face.
Dean laughed, "what about a -" he thought for a moment, trying to think of the most random and unlikely nerd imaginable, "a nerd nerd? Like, is there anyone in your family who is a fan girl or boy?"
"Really?" Dean says slowly, his tone between dangerous and friendly, turning to look at Sam, "and is there a reason Sam looks so suspicious?"
"Ok, do you want me to drive?"
Charlie puts up her hands in surrender. "Okay. Sorry."
Cas shrugs. "Maybe. But I'll still think you're cool."
Sam gaped at him. "
Sam smacks him just on the hard side of friendly and stands up. "Well since you refuse to help me help you I'm gonna go hang out with my boyfriend."
"Alright," Dean says, glancing at the clothes Cas is wearing and then at the clothes he had already movies into the closet. "Here," Dean says, passing over the jeans he had pulled out along with a light blue t-shirt. "They should fit you."
Dean can feel the awkward silence but before he can do do anything to stop it, he has to find a parking spot. "Anything you want to do while we are here?" he asks, pulling into the first spot he finds.
"Why does a high school student have a class here?" Cas asks, wincing as he replays his words in his head, "sorry that sounded rude, I'm just confused."
Dean quickly orders his pizza before turning to Cas, "well we are all a little weird, and it is definitely not a bad thing. Could you imagine how boring the world would be if we all acted the same, and thought the same, and ate the same pizza toppings?"
Cas's brow furrows. "He was homophobic," he says slowly. It's not a question. For an autistic kid, he's pretty good at reading into Dean's subtext.
"7:50," Cas replied.
Dean hisses sharply as Cas presses on his skin. He thinks about continuing arguing, but the pain is getting worse every time he moves and honestly, if listening to Cas is what it takes to make it go away, he will do so. Even if involves a hospital. "Keys are in my jacket," Dean mutters, waving a weak arm in the vague direction of where he had dumped his jacket.
"Dean's not going to die just because you're important to him," Charlie says gently, patting him on the arm in comfort, "I understand something bad has happened to you before, but that doesn't mean it will happen again."
Cas sighed. "Well have you considered that I don't exactly have reason to believe you care about me, either?"
"Oh yeah," Sam says with a sigh, "I'm with you there, being babied is so much better than being neglected." Dean sends Sam a grateful smile, thankful that his brother had decided against completely ruining his friendship with Cas.
Dean smiles as he grabs his own bag, having to run a couple of steps to catch up with Cas, who has decided to walk ahead without him. "It’s rude to abandon people you know," he says as soon as he's called back into step, "you're supposed to wait."
"Dean, are you okay?" he asks quietly, shaking him. "Dean?"
"Perhaps," Cas replies evasively.
falls to him. "Dean, I'm sorry," he says tensely. "But I'm a big girl and I can make my own decisions and I really like him, okay? For his
"Don't worry about it," Dean says with a laugh, feeling the mood in the room change, even if he can't figure out what it's shifted into. "What are we going to do now? We have an entire afternoon and I have no plans to leave this room."
Dean blinks a couple of times, "I don't know," he says slowly, "I might have eaten the takeout which was in the fridge? I can't remember."
he reminds himself.
Dean gasps a bit, the stitches in his side pulling as he bounces on the bed from the drop. "Dude!" he says, trying to ignore how strong Cas must be to so easily be able to carry him all the way here and not seem tired from it, "I literally just got let out of hospital!"
"Nothing is infallible," Cas murmurs. The girl is grinning up at Dean now, all teeth. He might puke.
Cas grins at him. "Come on. Let's watch the movie." And Dean starts it up, and Cas watches him casually until Dean makes a snarky comment and points at the screen. Cas shakes himself and looks back, a small smile on his face.
"He's right," Sam says through a mouthful of hashbrowns, jabbing a thumb in Gabriel's direction.
"Umm," Dean stalls, feeling almost like how he imagines a deer in the headlights must feel, "yes? I guess, I don't normally describe myself," he says, hoping that it will be enough.
Cas smiles genuinely. He's beautiful. "Thank you."
Cas looks at him. "Why do you say that as if yours isn't?"
"Because you're my soulmate and I'm in love with you," Cas exclaims.
Dean laughs, the childlike teasing releasing part of the burden he barely even notices he is carrying any more. "What book are you even reading?" he asks turning back to Cas, "it must be a good one seeing as you've decided it's better company than people for tonight."
Cas took a shaky breath. "You mean go to a party? With people?"
"Why what?" Dean asks, already extremely confused and getting more and more confused by the second, "Why did I show you them?"
"Why are you nervous about them now? Do you think you're going to find them here?"
Cas smiles. "That sounds great."
"Yeah, of course," Dean says quietly, staring out the window.
Cas can’t stop smiling at him. “Wait, make sure you’re writing this all down.”
"Yeah," Dean agrees with a laugh, "definitely more the latter. We are way more like serial killers than band members," Dean thinks for a moment before adding, "also neither of us can sing for shit."
“I’m sorry, you’re
"What? No!" Dean says quickly. And it isn't, if he'd rebalanced and pulled away from Lisa quicker, then none of this was have happened.
"I will," Cas promises. "I swear it."
Cas laughs. "That would be boring."
"Dean, it doesn't matter," Cas says. He hates this, the knowledge of what he's about to say. "It's not important. I'm sorry." He stands up and starts to dress. "I'm sorry."
Dean looks nervously between his brother and the half-eaten burger, before slowly picking it back up. The first bite is hard, the second makes him feel like he's going to burst, the third makes him feel like he's half a second away from throwing up his guts, but he keeps it down.
"Definitely," Cas replies.
"Seriously?" Dean muttered, "they had a go at you over being socially awkward? That's horrible."
Cas sighs. "Why are you doing this for me, Dean?" he asks honestly.
"I have always been qualified to make points, as long as they are valid points. And that one is definitely valid."
"Ok," Dean nods, "what are you nervous about?"
"For now," Dean agrees, "by the end of the year, I'll get you at least a little bit more cultured."
Cas scoffs and turns away, walking upstairs. Dean will follow or not. One way or another Cas will know where they stand with each other.
"What?" Dean asks, freezing up ever so slightly. If Cas is living with Gabe, and Dean is going to Gabe's place, then they would imply they are going to run into each other.
"Hey," Dean replies, wincing slightly at the desperation in his voice.
Dean tries his best not to react to the loss of warmth when Cas slips away, but he's not sure he manages. He's not sure what he did to make Cas regret this so much, but whatever he did, he wishes he could go back in time and stop it.
"I never said you didn't," Dean replies, "and anyway, I have a point."
Cas looks down in shame. "I don't have any money, Dean, besides what I've saved up to buy food. As I said before, I am paying for college entirely on my own. I don't have much extra money after tuition."
Dean glances around. "Uh. It's kind of. A disaster."
Cas glances down. "If I come, I'm going to be metaphorically glued to your side all night."
Cas laughs as he steps into the bathroom to brush his teeth, leaving the door open so he can continue to talk to Dean. "I have herbal supplements," he informs his new friend. "Melatonin that helps with sleep."
He’s not hearing Dean’s voice anymore; he hears his father, his older brother, his eighth-grade girlfriend, that boy who was his best friend for two years. He hears the voices of a thousand people over a thousand years it seems, all saying the same things.
Sam ruffles his hair and disappears into the kitchen to get him some water.
"Who?"
"That's cool," Dean says, trying to dislodge the disappointment and focus back on the present. "What classes does he help out with?" he asks.
"I like green," Cas says before he can stop himself, looking at Dean's gorgeous emerald eyes.
His name is Castiel Novak. He is 41 years old. He is married to a man named Dean Winchester Novak. And he is demiromantic.
"I don't know! You're still me friend, time doesn't change that! Are you trying to say you don't count me as a friend?"
Cas shrugged. "I'm not the kind of person who looks I like do anything. I've been told I look like I was just sitting in a room eating Saltines for twenty years and then I walked out here."
"Yeah, a trench coat," Dean agrees slowly, "can you seriously see no problems with that?"
"He said..." Cas glances down at the text. "In 'N' Out. At
"I'm ace," Cas says. "I told you that the day we met."
"I slept," Dean mutters tiredly, "is there even such a thing as sleeping well?"
"Do we have to? I don't feel that great."
Cas sighs in relief. "Fantastic. I get to see your car now?"
"Hello," Dean calls, walking over and sliding into the free booth opposite his brother.
"You haven't met my siblings," Cas told him darkly. "They are the living, breathing embodiment of horrible."
"Ok," Dean smiles, trying to figure out what he should say, "I am a secret geek, I love pie more than is probably healthy and…" He considers for a moment admitting that he’s bi, but he hasn't even come out to his family yet, so he really isn’t sure if he’s ready to come out to a random group of brand-new people at a party. "I really like stuff to do with occult and myths."
"Uhhh, good," Dean says, rubbing his jaw and trying to figure out what to do now. He is trying his best not to stare at Cas, but it's getting difficult, "you want to try on any other pairs?"
Cas wants to join him, wants to curl up in that not-so-comfortable bed, wrap himself around him, steal one of his earbuds. He imagines it, how it would play out. Dean would grin up at him and offer the headphones, and Cas would slide under his covers and press his right side against Dean's left. And then he's doing it. He crosses the room and stands there awkwardly besides Dean's bed, waiting for Dean to notice him.
"Hm," Cas intoned thoughtfully, thinking over the clothes he'd seen in Dean's closet. "Plaid?"
"You sure?" Dean asks, nodding at where Cas is still rubbing his arm.
"Bye," Dean mumbles, his eyes slipping shut, "'ll s' ya l'ter," he slurs, the anesthetic taking full hold.
Cas shrugged. "No idea. Either way, I'm glad you're my best friend."
"Why thank you, I do try."
Cas wraps his arms around Dean's neck and they stay there until someone comes up onto the stage and clears their throat. Cas pulls away, looking at them with his face flushed, and nods. They join their brothers.
Sam grins, pats his shoulder, and stands up. "Karaoke?"
Cas stares at him, disbelieving, and then sticks his foot out and trips him deliberately. Dean falls forward and Cas grabs his arms, catching him just before he hits the ground. He grins down at him.
"Sure you can," Dean says with a smile, "it'll be more entertaining if I have someone to talk to anyway."
"Yeah right," Dean mutters, before adding a quick, "asshole," just for good measure.
"You didn't what Cas?" Dean asks gently, "I don't know what you're apologizing for. I'm sorry that I know and you weren't ready to tell me, but there is no reason to say sorry to me, why would I need an apology?"
Cas nods, turning to scramble for the keys. He glances at Dean, then grits his teeth. "This is going to hurt," he says. "I don't envy you." That's all the warning he gives before he bends and lifts Dean into his arms, trying to avoid jostling his left side too much, allowing his head to slump onto Cas's shoulder. His heartbeat quickens at the proximity but he ignores it; now's not the time. He gently carries him out to the car, fumbles to unlock it, and lays Dean across the back seat. He takes the streets as fast as he dares and makes it to the hospital in ten minutes.
Castiel chuckles, light-headed. «I love you too.» He brings his arm up to card through Dean’s hair with his fingers. Then he lets himself slowly fall forward, back sinuously arched as he rests on the bed, one arm folded under him and the other stretched above his head.
«I love you.» Dean whispers, and the declaration is as beautiful and vibrant as a tree in full bloom.
«You couldn’t even if you tried.» Castiel argues, but he’s deep down touched by Dean’s attentions.
Castiel’s right hand is placed exactly where he had left his imprint on Dean’s biceps. The scar is long gone now, but it feels like there’s still the shadow of its ridges left behind. Like the mark has been planted way deeper under the skin, right into Dean’s soul, where the hunter has left it free to spread its roots, accepting it into himself without any protest, letting it thrive, and caring to make it blossom.
He presses. Their heartbeats loud in their ears. And then the head of his cock goes in.
I panicked about this ff's title for a while when I went to publish, so I just skimmed through what I had already written and went for a quote that looked funny. Also, Blondie rocks, so why not.
He yawns, stretching his body, and one calf cramps painfully.
«What? You know I’m no game after Taco Thursday, you should appreciate how lucky you have it.» He reasons with a careless shrug.
The angel’s face isn’t exactly as readable as Dean’s. Despite the many human’s quirk he has picked up over the last handful of years, his idea of expressiveness is still very alien. It takes quite some time for most people to grasp his moods and emotions by the way his eyes crease, or by how his cheekbones raise, and his lips are the most elusive to interpret by far.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s a funny picture all in all, and Dean grins at him as he takes a swing out of his beer.
He hugs Dean closer to himself.
«Cass, I am serious though. I would be happy to try that out.» His voice deepens into a softer, earnest tone, and he looks at Castiel with genuine affection. «Alright?» He extends his hand on the table to reach for the angel’s, squeezing it in reassurance.
And then there’s the cigarettes.
They leave the dispensary carrying a shopping bag with a glaring cannabis leaf printed on. There’s some cheer right at the corners of the angel’s mouth, just slight of a smile.
«How’s that?» The hunter asks. He’s so careful and attentive it’s almost frustrating but the angel appreciates it, nevertheless.
«Oh Lord…» He moans against the angel’s lips, like it’s worship, like he’s really calling for Cass.
There’s something about Dean’s hardness that is always sexy, and Castiel loves it in his mouth while toying with the balls in his hands, or when it bounces against Dean’s belly when the hunter's riding him.
Dean nibs at his ear. «And to think I haven’t even touched you all night.»
Dean’s hands have slid down to the angel’s hips, taking in the sight in awe. Castiel’s face is turned to the side, half hidden in the sheets, but there’s no mistaking his enamoured smile.
He brings his tongue to the back of his balls, savouring the natural saltiness of his skin, breathing in his musk.
«Fuck, you are hot.» Castiel whispers, his voice made rougher and his tongue filthier by the weed. He looks at him with drowsy, adoring eyes. Dean can’t hold back a stunned laughter; he doesn’t get to hear the angel swear nearly enough.
They wait out until their breaths even out and they relax into it.
Castiel on the other hand prefers to sip weiss beers and blanches, with their soft, buttery texture yet slightly acidic flavours, or full bodied whiskies.
«Don’t tell me you wouldn’t have the stamina for two rounds if needed.» He says hotly, nibbling at the angel’s ear. Castiel can’t quite deny that.
«It should be illegal how hot you are. I mean, I didn’t think it possible that someone could make me come in my underwear with some dry-humping past the age of 14, yet here we are.» He complains, with a furrowed brow and farfetched disapproval.
A gentle session, quite different from the intense and heated sex they usually have. They both relished it anyway, as that was exactly what they were in the mood for.
Dean sits back on the floor as his attentions close in on his lover’s ass, kissing and biting softly at his cheeks as his hands stroke his inner thighs and cups at his buttocks.
The angel whimpers when the hunter takes out his fingers.
«Like that’d be a bad thing.» Dean rejoinders sardonically.
The angel is silent, except for some sparse sighs and low hums. He has his eyes closed, deeply concentrated on Dean’s caresses. He is accustomed to the hunter’s touch on his skin thanks to all the showers they’ve had together, and while they had never been sexual in nature before, the familiarity washes his worries away.
«Good. And now, off to the bathroom. We are getting a shower.» He announces cheerfully.
Eyes shut tight and eyebrows drawn in pleasure, he calls Dean’s name in uneven, ragged pants, shaking with the need to be filled with his lover’s cock.
«We are here exactly for it.» Dean replies upbeat, before noticing the disconcerted look on his lover’s face. «No, not like that, you’re not doing it for the first time in a pub, that’d be terrible. Trust me, been there, done that. But having just a drink before, well, maybe five or six in your case, actually helps relaxing. The stuff we have at home is cheap as fuck and it’s been a while since the last time we’ve been on a date, so I figured why not just go out for a change?»
As the neon sign on the top of the entrance informs, the store is called High Heaven. The irony is not lost on either of them. Dean groans out a peeved «Seriously?», when he kills Baby’s engine in the shop’s parking lot. A small, amused snort rolls out of Castiel instead.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel gives him a paper filter he has just rolled up tight to hold for the moment, and Dean takes it in his hand. He frowns a little, but he keeps the discomfort to himself, pressing on with the story.
. He repeats its name in his head to remember it for later reference.
There’s a lively blue shine dancing in his eyes, and his expression is soft and content, even as his eyebrows are slightly pinched in concentration.
It’s stupid and demeaning and he’s a hypocrite, Castiel had yelled at him through a stream of slurred words that one time the angel got about ten glasses beyond tipsy with Bobby, and Dean threw a fit about it while being quite plastered himself.
Castiel doesn’t look at him as he answers in one single breath.
Then he lets go.
His thrusts get frantic, bucking wild into Dean and the hunter sobs in pleasure, searching for Castiel’s eyes to latch on to them, blue and bright and blazing hot in mad lust.
With affectionate efficiency, he takes care of Castiel first, helping him strip out of his boxers, drying him up and slipping the clean, fresh t-shirt and underwear on the angel. He could perfectly do all of this by himself, Dean is well aware of that. But he also knows how nice those attentions feel after a lifetime of constantly looking after oneself. Besides, he enjoys providing for him.
Dean laughs. «Wow, you really are thirsty for my dick.»
«Cass, you know you can tell me.» He encourages and proceeds to take the angel’s index in his mouth to idly suck at it, knowing very well how much Castiel enjoys that.
«Oh Hell, yeah.» Dean’s enthusiasm gets a laugh out of Castiel.
All the air gets sucked out of Castiel's lungs. It is further than where it got to before, in the shower. Now the sensation has a real depth within himself and it’s a strange concept to adjust to.
He breaths out the spent smoke after holding it in for a moment.
«Does it have cowboys?» The angel hates that he’s even asking, let alone with a hint of hope in his voice, but he’s warming up to the genre. Not like he’ll ever admit to it. Especially not while he’s naked, hard and desperate for his lover to take his anal virginity.
Castiel already knows all of this. He has seen it before in the hunter’s eyes. He has heard it countless times now, quietly whispered in his love confessions. He believes the words without question.
«You son of a bitch…» He mumbles at it, waiting for the ache to fade.
All the hunter’s expressions are burnt into Castiel’s mind, and he’s fond of each and every one of them, if not for the defeated, pained ones.
And if he is to be honest, to try that with the angel, it entices him quite a bit.
Cass’s eyes are fixed onto their joined hands on the table.
Slowly, they come down from their climax, the grips they had on each other’s bodies turning into softer caresses. They are both lightheaded, the sweat now cooling on their skin. Castiel’s body glistens in the dark, Dean’s hands still on him.
Dean freezes for half a second before just deciding not to react to Cas' words. Sure, they are true, but that doesn't mean he has to confirm it. "You done yet?"
Cas smiles widely at Dean. "You're my favorite person in the world," he decides. He hesitates. "Oh... Dean?"
"I do," Cas breathes. "I'm ace, but not repulsed. And I want to do this with you."
out?”
"Ok, we'll head out in half an hour," Dean says with a grin, "get ready."
"Why wouldn't I?" Cas says, shrugging. "You're my best friend and roommate."
? Who has burgers for breakfast?"
"I'll have the same as Dean," Cas answers.
Cas looks up at him, no anger in his eyes, only concern. "Dean?" he whispers.
"Then
Dean turns to face Cas, his best pleading look pasted all over his face, "just one more person? Just one more conversation? Please?" he asked. Despite only knowing Cas for the day, he already knows that force won't work here.
"Fine. But you have to drag me over there."
Cas recoils in shock when Dean suddenly brandishes a pair of jeans at him. He blinks before taking them hesitantly. "Alright," he says quietly, then makes his way over to a fitting room.
"Really? What did you think would happen before you got here? Also please don't tell me you only started kissing me because you thought I wanted it."
Dean sighs as he walks back to his new room. He is a bit concerned about what Sam and Cas have been doing in his absence.
"I literally just walked in here. After you guys. I wanted to let you know Papa and Dad are leaving."
Cas freezes when he feels Dean press against his side. After a moment, he leans against Dean, praying he won't be pushed off.
Dean smiles, "come on then, let's go."
By the time Dean walks out the bathroom - after staring at the words on his arm for a worryingly long amount of time, Cas has gotten him thinking is all - Cas is asleep. He looks so peaceful and Dean can't stop the smile which spills over his face. "Night Cas," he whispers, climbing under the covers and closing his eyes, allowing himself to drift off to sleep.
Cas sat down next to him. "You're welcome. You can sleep more if necessary, it's the weekend."
"Bobby Singer," he answers. "What can I do ya for, Dean?"
Cas nods. "Not a single person." They inject Dean with the anesthetic. "I'll see you later."
"I thought you were smarter than that, Gabriel," Cas told his brother.
"You had sex with a minor," Cas hisses through his teeth. "One of your students,
"So, what'd you guys do last night?" Sam asks around his eggs.
"Interesting name," Dean answers slowly, smiling widely. His smile slowly drops the longer Castiel holds onto his hand. He likes his new roommate, but he seems a bit odd. Oh well, he decides, it was probably just first meeting nerves.
Cas cocks his head to one side. "My brother makes an exceptional blueberry pie," he decides.
"Hello, Charlie," he greets her.
Dean leaves his eyes closed, content to just listen to the quiet sounds around him, and the sound of Cas saving his Baby. If he wasn't already well and truly in love, he seriously would be by now.
"What do you mean?" Dean asks, confusion filling his tone as he pauses eating his pancakes to stare at his brother. "He has a point," Gabe says carefully, "you do seem pretty close."
"Ok," Dean says with a timid smile and a deep breath, "So, basically back when I was in high school a lot of family shit happened," he pauses for a moment - blinking away the tears which had started gathering as he thought about what happened with his mom - before going on, "I was left looking after Sammy, so I didn't really have much time for school work. I'm not sure if you've ever written an essay on a text you've never read, but it isn't great."
Cas stared at him. "Have you never slept well in your life?"
"There will
Dean actually laughs, sounding surprised. "I've never told anybody that. Not even Sam."
Cas nods. "Sure."
"I don't exactly know their name," Dean scoffs, tossing his phone, "that's their number. You can figure out the rest."
"Are you alright?" Cas asks quietly. "Did I do something wrong?"
Dean smiles, happy to see Cas opening up a little and making friends.
"Yeah, but thanks to you and the hospital, it doesn't hurt any more, so I'll give you a pass on that one."
"Oh, that's..." Charlie starts before stopping, "wait, before I decide what that is, do you like him? Do you think he's hot?"
"Did what?" Dean asks, his memory of last night hazy. He has a feeling that that's what Cas is talking about, something which happened last night, but he can't figure out what.
Dean frowns. Now that Cas is gone, he is going to have to think about all this. And he does not want to do that.
"Thanks," Dean says with a blush.
. "Whatever is easier. I don't want to be a burden."
Dean roughly wipes at his face, trying to get rid of the tears running down his face, "If I can't do one more car payment they are going to take her away," he says, his voice trembling in distress, "I can't afford it, but I can't lose my Baby."
Cas looks at him curiously. "Then tell me some stories."
"Yeah," Dean breathes against Cas' lips, trying to get his brain back online.
"Okay, that's fair."
The angel shifted uncomfortably beside Dean, looking away from the TV as if it were poison. Dean took his hand under the covers, away from Chuck's eyes. Cas curled their fingers together and rubbed his thumb against the back of his hand. They held on to each other.
Before Dean could protest, Cas held his arms out and said, "We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. But it seems you may be in need of your... 'baby'? Am I using that right? I don't think I am."

The passenger's side door opened, and the trenchcoated angel slid into the bench. He closed it solidly and looked at Dean with wide blue eyes. He's so close. Dean pulled at the collar of his tee shirt, heart throbbing in a way that made him sweat.
"Yeah, as a friend," Dean points out, "you said so yourself."
Dean freezes, turning towards his brother and having honestly not a single clue of what Sam will say. Sam smiles at his brother, turning around to face Cas, "well," he says with a shit eating grin, his tone light and teasing, "that depends on what you count as a good dorm-mate."
"What?" Dean asks with a sniff, trying to figure out what Cas is saying.
"Ok, you'll have to try on a couple of different pairs then," Dean says. He looks between his legs and Cas', trying to assure the embarrassed part of his brain that he is
, he reminds himself.
"It'll being out your eyes," Dean explains before blushing, "I mean, I guess. I don't really know, but it would probably suit you anyway."
"Alright, give us some time to get ready," Dean sighs, "where is it and we'll meet you there."
"Cas doesn't miss me," Dean mutters, pushing himself up until he's sitting, sitting on the side of the bed for a moment trying to stop his head from spinning.
"You have his number," Gabe points out. "And it's not that he won't let you near him, it's just that you can't find him."
"What? It's true!" Dean says.
Cas gets the message. "So, Sam, what are your plans for your career?"
"Right, let's do this," he calls to his surrounding family, he claps his hands once and grabs the first box, letting out a loud laugh at Sam's grimace.
“Mm,” Dean replies, some of the spark rekindling. “They had plenty of what you needed in stock, didn’t they?”
Cas hesitantly rests his head on Dean's shoulder and allows Dean to start the movie.
Gabe scoffs. "Okay, man. Whatever you say."
Cas smiles. "Uh- yeah, sure okay."
He takes a moment to weigh his options and the question
Sam sighs. "Dean and I have had a pretty rough life, that's all I can tell you. And it started back when I was six months old. Ask Dean about it sometime, though."
"To the biggest town we can find nearby," Dean answers, looking around to try and find some sign posts to direct them.
“You’re confused.”
Dean wakes slowly. He hears Cas say something and the words register in his mind before he's even opened his eyes. Cas regrets it. He must do. Dean lays there, keeping his breathing even and his eyes closed as though if he keeps pretending to be asleep, he'll wake up and this will have never happened. Cas wouldn't regret what they did.
Cas leaned forward, putting down his food and peering directly at Dean. "I don't believe that. I know I don't know you very well, but I've observed people long enough to be able to see the same eyes on different people. And you? You are not a man who has no future. You only need to believe in it."
"Alright," Dean says, and he can feel himself brightening up. He may hate talking about himself, but he is always happy to talk about his snot-nosed little brother. "He's tall - like freakishly tall - and really smart. He wants to go to Stanford, and I think he's going to get it. He's not like me, his future is fucking bright." Dean suddenly realizes what he said and freezes. Shit.
"Nowhere, I'm fine," Dean replies, trying to hide his grimace as Cas' bustling causes another stab of pain.
"And I have an entire list of strategies to help you sleep better, not just drugs," Cas adds.
"That's your coat?" he questions hesitantly, unsure quite what he is seeing.
"It's not a dumbass decision," Sam argues weakly.
Sam shrugs. "I have a few passions. I can see myself as a teacher or a musician, performing artist of some kind, but really if I get my top pick then I am most definitely going into law." He grins at Dean.
Cas smiles and sits down on his bed, too busy trying not to say any of the many things in his mind (such as 'that jawline should be illegal' or 'how the fuck are your eyes so green') to answer.
"Supernatural," Cas replies, trying to keep his face neutral. "There's a character based off of me, alright, and he is one hundred percent gay for the main character's brother, alright?"
Cas swallows hard and says "and... I don't love Dean. Either." The lie tears him in half but he has to say it.
"Your dad?" Gabe asked slowly, "weren't you saying goodbye to him yesterday?"
"Cas moved out of your dorm room almost four months ago."
He married Dean at twenty-one, young and soft-eyed and easily tricked, but he trusted Dean like he’d never trusted another person in his life. Dean was kind, and gentle, and beautiful, and Dean had treated him like a real, honest, functional person. Dean had found him a therapist, had helped him work through his trauma. Dean had sat there when Cas woke up screaming at 2:30 even though Dean had to be up in an hour and a half. Dean had held him through the worst panic attacks he’d ever had. Dean had stroked his hair when he flashed back to his father. Dean had sat at his side when he vomited into the toilet at the thought of what was done to him as a child.
«Here.» He says, offering it back to the angel on his open palm.
The angel makes space for Dean to move on the bed. He kneels behind him, strokes his sides, going over the ribs and down to the indent in his hips and back up again, while his now lubed finger slides down on his ass. He presses, pushing in, and it just slips inside.
Castiel holds his breath as Dean's hand travels from his hip to his belly, then gasps sharply when it finally wraps around his neglected cock.
«Oh no, that’s not the reason. When I got to the motel room I was confused and everything still felt really fucking weird, but it wasn’t that bad… Then dad came back.» There’s a drop in Dean’s voice that Castiel immediately picks up on.
They sit close in front of each other on the bed, their knees raised and leaning against ones’ another’s.
«Cass, you are bringing me to church.» The words roll out of the hunter on their own.
The angel glares at him as he helps him work the soap into his skin. «This is not funny, Dean. It just won’t stop twitching, and it all feels loose and…»
At last, he weaves his arms under Castiel’s thighs, his hands reaching around his waist, locking the angel in place. His face is properly buried in his ass now and he laps at him without holding back.
The hunter makes a sound of acknowledgment from deep in his throat.
And the angel comes, with a thundering shout that ripples through them both and rings in their ears way past it’s gone, and as Dean’s fingers wet with copious warm spurts, a wave of his own comes forward from his balls, and he empties himself in Castiel’s tightness with a cry, helplessly falling onto him.
He works in one digit at first, and a second follows suit soon after as his head keeps on bobbing on Dean’s cock. He keeps a slow rhythm to his administrations, and Dean falls into it like it’s a trance, humming and rocking in-between Cass fingers and his mouth.
«Easy there, tiger.» Dean chuckles, but the thought of food suddenly stirs quite the hunger in his stomach. «Honestly though, I could really do with a pizza delivery right now…»
Castiel’s tone is apologetic, but Dean isn’t angry at all. «So you have it here? Can I get it one moment?» He quietly asks.
Dean shakes his head as he pouts, disgruntled. «I see this stuff hasn’t improved much.» He complains.
«Do you have anything like that yourself?» The question sounds a bit callous as soon as it leaves his mouth, but it’s too late.
«We’ll talk about it in the morning, Ok?» Castiel says, feeling like he owes the other an explanation.
The frustration in Castiel’s face is bordering exasperation. «Dean, come on.» He pouts, much like a disgruntled child.
«So, is it better this time around?» Castiel questions.
"Yeah, but you're going to regret this tomorrow if I let you skip, so come on. Up and at it, time for class," Dean says, still not moving from his cozy position.
"No, not in the slightest."
He was always a studious child. He researched things for fun, learned all the facts he could fit into his young, impressionable, precocious brain. He searched for answers to the issue of why he didn’t experience ‘crushes’ like his friends did. He found the aromantic spectrum. He discovered the term ‘demiromantic’ and decided, this feels right. This fits.
"Thanks," Dean replies, closing his eyes and relaxing even more against Cas.
"Gabriel?" Dean asks, his attention caught by the life of this stranger who he already feels a connection to, "like the angel? Did your parents name all of you weirdly?"
His best friend of several years never spoke to him again after the day he came out.
"Oh," Dean says, relaxing ever so slightly, so Cas isn't homophobic! But now Dean has lied and has to decide whether to keep up the pretense or tell the truth. Great. "Wait, you said you haven't gotten the expression of heterosexuality from me," he says, "what do you mean?" Because, although he isn't embarrassed about what he is, he is closeted and has always though he does a good job at hiding it. Apparently not?
Cas smiles. "We're named for angels," he says quietly.
Joan rolls her eyes. "Well, fine, then. You two have fun." She walked away, leaving Cas confused.
Dean turns the music up loud and drives towards In 'N' Out, tapping on the steering wheel in time with the music and singing along.
Cas reaches out and takes Dean's hand on impulse so he doesn't lose him.
"I like lots of stuff," Dean says with a shrug, "I normally go for the more action movies, but I also like comedies and stuff."
"Why would I tell you?"
, he thinks. He follows him to his room and stands by the wall as they prepare to put Dean under for surgery.
Cas sighs, feeling put upon, and rolls his eyes. "It's my least favorite Avengers movie. I never enjoyed watching it. But if you really want to we might as well just marathon them."
"Ok great, what's your favorite?" Dean asks. He ignores the way Cas's eyes scrunch up and his speech slows, a pair of tells Dean has figured out means he's getting frustrated and focuses instead on Netflix. He knows how annoying it is to have people point stuff out, or treat you differently because of something, and he is refusing to do the same to Cas. If Cas needs to talk, he'll talk, but if all that's going on is movie picking, then he will just leave it alone.
As he prepares for a pointless journey, he ponders the people he's met over the last two days. Sam is certainly something. He's very sweet, and Cas relates to him on a personal level. Both younger siblings, both kind of geeky, both somewhat misunderstood... and Sam wears that look that Cas has seen in his own eye. The look of a man haunted. Beyond that, Cas noticed how Gabriel looked at him. Sam might not realize it, but Gabriel is starstruck, completely infatuated with him. He always did have a thing for younger guys.
Sam huffs in agreement, rolling his eyes. "It is. But I gotta do it."
"Yeah, we're soulmates. And your point?"
is running through his brain at a mile a minute and he honestly feels like he needs to reboot to try and figure out what Cas even means.
Dean rolls his eyes, before turning in the direction of the kitchen, "Gabe!" he calls, "how long till foods ready?"
Dean pulls a slight face, unsure of how to explain it, "pineapple is sweet, onion is - not sweet? They just - do they really go together?" he asks hesitantly. He can't quite believe that they could possibly work together and he's almost shocked that Cas is making him question it.
Dean leans against the window, watching as the street goes past and wondering at which point things got so bad that Gabe has to intervene. It's been weeks, maybe even months. He doesn't know, time wasn't really a thing he was paying attention to. He went to his classes and that was pretty much it.
Dean gapes for a moment, shaking his head as he opens the door and collapses into the seat, muttering the whole way about certain "stupid roommates who don't believe that I won't survive this."
"No of course not!" Dean gasps. "I never want you to disappear. I know I'm awful at talking, possibly worse than you at times, but I really do want to watch what you want to put on," he gestures to the computer again, "if you still want to pick?"
"Sure I can," Dean grins once Cas has caught up, "I just did."
Cas shrugged. "My brother is doing his best."
“Mm,” says Dean, not looking up from the book he’s intently studying.
"I wasn't being suspicious!" Sam protested, holding his hands up. "I'm just going home with him- uh, I'm just going to sleep with him-
"How is this your fault?"
"No," Cas says, equally softly. "I can't. I never have and I never will."
Cas raised his eyebrows. "That sounds like a very weak argument. I myself am gay asexual."
Cas grins. “I’m staying with my dad. We can drive down separately, but then I’m going to park somewhere else in town and you’re going to drive me to my dad’s house. You do remember where my dads used to live, right?”
"An apartment that I doubt I will be frequenting," Cas replies coldly. "Five months, Dean, we have no classes together. We don't have to see each other. I'm sorry I thought we could be something."
"Ok, I'll bear that in mind," Dean says, leaving against Cas and watching the opening credits begin to play. He feels so warm and cozy and safe and - despite feeling in hospital earlier that day - he feels happy. Happy to just lean against his soulmate for as long as he can allow himself it.
"Ok, I'll bear that in mind," Dean says with a smile, even though he knows that there is no chance he would ever burden someone as awesome as Cas with his problems. "Same goes for you, anything you need, I'll be here."
"I should probably head off soon as well," Gabe says, "I've got a lot to sort out before classes start. I'll see you guys later?"
Dean hums an affirmative answer, kissing Cas with everything he has.
Sam laughs. "Didn't even finish the joke, what an ass," he mutters, then glances at his watch. "Oh, shit, I really have to go."
"No, you had your reasons for going, so you left. You shouldn't make your decisions based on how it would effect me."
Cas stares at him. "Dean. My god."
Gabe smiles as well, "well, we won't know unless they fall in love."
"Thank you, Dean," Cas replies. "I like you a lot as well."
into Lisa Braeden?" Charlie clarifies.
Gabe grins too cheerfully. "Good."
"You are an asshole," Cas declares.
"My coffee?" Dean asks, grateful for the distraction.
"Ok not going to run either," Dean replies, taking a step forward as well so there is only an inch or two between them.
Sam's face breaks out into a wide smile. "Yeah, we are!" He turns his grin on Dean, who still looks shocked and almost angry. His smile falters. "What's up, dude?"
"I'm sorry, was that a flirtation?" Cas asked her.
"He's 4 years older than me, he's majoring in musical theater and he has about a million siblings, happy now?" Sam snaps, feeling annoyed that his brother still won't just accept his decisions.
Dean gasps in mock surprise, "the rudeness, the lack of etiquette, the sheer disrespect," he grins evilly before reaching out and pushing Cas lightly, just strong enough to make him stumble. He ignores the pins and needles like feeling that just touching Cas creates; there isn't any point into looking into things which are just his desperate, touch starved brain tricking itself.
Cas sighs sadly and doesn't move for a moment. He keeps laying on Dean's bed, inhaling the smell of him for a moment before he stands up and starts to get himself some clothes as well.
The day crawls by. Dean spends every single lesson wishing he was back at Cas' side, curled up watching a movie together.
," Cas offers.
Cas smiles back as he watches Dean drive. "Today went by slowly," he comments. "It felt like a hundred years."
"You love karaoke," Sam points out. "I know you're depressed and depressed people have trouble doing things they used to enjoy but like. Come on. We can't leave you here on your own, you'll hurt yourself, and Gabriel and I are going. Please?"
Cas clears his throat and nods. "Of course. Lead on, Dean."
"I'm not a teenage girl," Dean complains, but he instinctively knows it's pointless. He also knows - as much as he hates to admit it - that Sam has a point. He's had barely any appetite ever since Cas left and he may not want to believe it's any kind of disorder, it is definitely not healthy.
"I did drag you to a hospital when you deliberately said no hospitals," Cas points out.
Cas almost smiles, but falters as he thinks back over what he just said. "Fuck," he whispers. "That was unintentional and not at all how I meant to tell you that. I'm sorry, Dean, I didn't-"
"Great!" Dean says quickly - possibly a bit too enthusiastically, but who was checking. "Where are we going?"
Cas is a little to nervous to try scooting closer to Dean again, so they stay there with half an inch of space between them as the movie begins to play. It feels like a chasm, like a thousand miles, and Cas hates the fact that this is his own fault. He brought this on himself and he has to accept the consequences. Dean will never love him.
"Do we have to do this in the same house?" Dean asks quickly, "because I would rather not be in the same street as you while you are doing that."
"Takes one to know one and all that? Maybe, it's not like I've ever been tested. Or maybe you are just better at reading me because the reason you can't read other people is something they are doing, which I don't do?"
I like you grabbing my ass, we will
Dean chuckled, "Okay, now that I believe."
Sam nodded as he looked at the map before him, "When all this is over, I'll teach you whatever you want, kiddo."
a PS4, Sam.
Castiel blinked.
Castiel rolled his eyes, "It's not like I'm going to burn the kitchen down--"
That is incredibly childish. He can't do it.
Sam started to laugh, gesturing up and down to the book. "You love that thing. Gonna scan the pages?"
Sam blushed, ears turning a dark red as he focused on the ropes. He knotted and swirled the ropes around Chuck's chest. "Yeah, well. We had an adult conversation about our affair, so we don't have to give anyone any details--"
Castiel chopped green onions in agony as Dean's perfect ass swayed in dark denim to Aero's
Castiel blinked. "How?"
A thunderclap smacked throughout the room as they all shared a round of martinis in Amara's living room. It was raining like a nor'easter in the flat plains of Nevada. Large raindrops smacked down by the trillions, drenching everything in it's path. The clouds were dark and full, patching out the sun. Every now and then there would be a flash of lightning hit, brighter than an atomic bomb. The crack of thunder followed. Then more rain, cascading from the sky in an endless sheet.
Meta looked back to Jack. They shared a quiet moment before Meta spoke up again, "You're nothing like your dad, are you?"
Dean winked. "That's right, Blue Eyes."
Dean scoffed, resting his entire body against Castiel's as he melted into the embrace, "I don't
"So, when Dean cooks for me, it's because he loves me? Because I'm his son?"
"Not really. I possessed Jimmy Novak's great, great grandmother for a brief time when she was a newlywed. It was alright, but clothes back then were so heavy and the undergarments... constricting."
Billie called out from the wall. "Of course not. What could you boys possibly give us?" Amara and Billie started to giggle together. Billie glided across the room, scraping her scythe across the floor as she made her way over the Amara. Death stood beside the Darkness and they looked into each other for a moment. Billie said firmly. "So. Ally. What would you like to do next?"
Pretending as though he didn't have a major life event mere minutes ago wasn't easy, but Dean has a PhD in bullshit. He'll make it through one conversation with his brother without giving himself away. Castiel waited eleven years to kiss him, and despite everything that moment was special to Dean. He just wanted to share that memory with Cas and Cas alone right now. A part of him wanted to make sure it was real. Dean just wishes they didn't have to run out right now-- that they had time to spend together talking and holding each other and figuring everything out. Those moments were few and far between for the Winchesters. As of now, they won't be alone for quite a while.
Amara paused. She raised her nose for a moment, she sniffed the air for a familiar scent. "Is... is that brimstone? From the sixth ring?"
"Okay! Well, it sounded like you had fun which is the most important part, Dean." Sam said, pulling the screen back up and continuing his research as he teased. "Or... should we all call you Bad Boy now?"
Castiel stayed quiet, head bowing as he acknowledged Death and the Darkness with reverence. He was rocking his "signature look" again. His ever-present trench coat swished against his slacks as he followed his human like a dutiful golden retriever.
"Breathe in." Amara instructed, placing one hand on Jack's chest and another on the bar top table beside them. Black smoke poured from her manicured fingers, nails changing from a glossy baby pink almond shape to a matte black coffin. The smoke misted into Jack's sweater. His eyes lit up a bright gold and there was a loud cracking noise under the bar. Amara smiled at the noise, closing her eyes as she patted the bar top table. The table glowed gold through every crack, spilling down the legs of it in honey-like trails. The gold glowing energy shone brightly, sparkling and spreading to the floor, the chairs, the walls, the ceiling. When the entire bar was covered, Amara instructed Jack once more.
Once they were alone, Cas pulled the hunter in closer and walked into an embrace. He wrapped Dean in his thick trenchcoated arms. They stood outside holding each other for a moment, breath making little puff clouds in the cold night air. Dean locked his arms around Cas's broad shoulders. The angel tugged him in by the waist. Castiel rested his head on Dean's shoulder, "I want to make sure you're okay. Before we go. You've been praying for more hugs lately."
"Oh?" Castiel said as the human stretched again, his body pressed against every inch of him. Dean yawned, the seat of his boxers rubbing against the front of Cas's sweatpants. He felt very different without jeans on. Much softer, warmer. Cas could feel the plush give of Dean's perky ass through his pants. The angel pulled Dean in closer, shifting his hands against his chest as they tried to get comfortable in bed together. Castiel's breath was quickening as they touched. Dean's hand reached back and he tangled his fingers in Cas's hair.
Dean remembers stuffing them deep down in his bag, hoping he might have a few seconds of free time during the hunt. This would undoubtedly be a three or even four day trip away from home, Dean had to have something hot to look forward to.
The man tilted his head, large blue eyes narrowing with confusion. "
Jack made a bubble ball, lathering up the soap and sticking it to his nose, "Look, Sam. I'm a clown."
by Led Zeppelin purred through the speakers like a warm hug.
Jack woke again around three in the morning, groaned and yawned with exhaustion. His eyes were swollen and puffy after a night spent crying. He wiped his face with his sleeve, sitting up to look at Castiel in surprise, "Whoa, Dad! What are you doing??"
Dean smirked, "You? Castiel? As a pretty girl? In a tight corset and cute vintage panties? Oh, I would
Death. You do not get to choose how I appear. I was loyal to no one but the circle of life and Chuck because that was my purpose. But, when I became Death, I was freed from his manuscripts and I started reading everything he had planned in his little books. I have a new library now. A better one. Today, Amara, I stand here as an ally." Billie said sternly. "You're not the only one that came around."
The front door had been opened.
"Yeah, sure." Castiel grimaced, walking down the hall with Dean, looking for Metatron's room.
He stretched a bit, yawning as the angel spooning him from behind kissed Dean's hair. Castiel kept him safe and snuggled in, holding him tight with those strong arms. Dean said into the pillow, "Mmm. Time is it?"
They'd just started plating breakfast when Jack came around the corner, yawning in a long grey robe that was way too big for him. It was dragging behind him on the floor, trailing his small steps like a train. Is that Dean's dead guy robe? Yes. It is. Little theif. Whatever. Jack can use it for now. He knows it's cozy.
They sat in silence for a long while. He watched as Castiel tipped the bottle into his mouth. He doesn't think a day will ever come where they'll talk. And, Dean means really, really talk.
Jack shook his head, eyes widening at the prospect, "No. I haven't."
Jack blubbered for a moment, holding on to his father for most of the walk over. Then he wiped his eyes and yanked the car door open, sliding in beside Sam. Castiel patted the roof above Jack's seat and the boy looked up, at where his hand would be, smiling a bit even though he still looked sad.
Jack needed to hear forgiveness from the older hunter, but after what he confessed to? Dean was at a loss for words. He hadn't forgiven Jack. Killing Mary Winchester had driven a large wedge between them. Hell, Jack was surprised Dean even let him stay in the first place. Things weren't "all good" between them and may never be "all good" again. But, Dean didn't hate the boy. He could never. He raised him. And damn it all, Dean loves him -- sees him as his child. So, when he came back he couldn't help it. The door was open. Jack was immediately fed and safe and warm. In his home again, all of his parents by his side to hold and protect him.
Sam and Jack tiptoed back in the hotel suite three hours later. They closed the door quietly. Jack whispered to Sam, "Can I run in Dean's room and say goodnight?"
Clouds gathered in the sky as Sam chanted. The dark stones fell to the grassy earth around the maps, pounding up and down into the dirty gravel. They tore the maps apart, invisible hands using the stones to shred the paper on the ground. Australia and South America were ripped into strips. Little bits of paper swirled in the wind, dancing to the tune of Sam's commanding voice. Next, went Asia, Europe, Africa. All ripped and floating inside the circle made by Sam and his family.
Such a heartfelt reaction makes Dean’s own throat itchy with emotions. «I’ll get you a new string for it if you’d like to wear it.» He coughs at the end of the sentence to cover his own affect.
Admittedly, Dean knows it’s true because he used to do the same when he was a teenager, and it was arguably worse for his health than it could ever be for an angel of the Lord.
«You mean when you fuck me silly until my brain melts, when all I can think of is how much I love you and your mind-blowing sex skills?» Dean cheekily asks in return, nudging his face against Castiel’s neck and shoulders.
«How are you doing?» He asks against his shoulder.
Feel free to comment with any thoughts you have, I greatly appreciate constructive criticism! :)
The angel looks surprised to learn that. «Do you have any suggestions then?»
Castiel lets it go for a moment, which makes Dean groan in objection. «Get the lube, Dean.» The angel instructs and Dean’s protests die on his lips. He reaches out to get the bottle in the drawer, but Castiel doesn’t cut him any slack. He puts his hands on his ass, drawing him in, and takes him all in his mouth as he does so.
With resolute motions, he takes one wrinkled piece of paper from his wallet and tries his best to smooth it out. Then, he wraps it around the pendant as neatly as he can.
Dean slows down to balance himself as he leans forward, driving further into Castiel. He keeps his weight up on one elbow so that he’s not crushing the angel, but still close enough to brush against his back.
Dean doesn’t catch himself soon enough before he answers with a flat, blunt «No.».
«Don’t be blasphemous, Dean.» Castiel scolds him, but there’s a wide smirk on his face as he takes his mouth off him and slips his fingers out. They make a slick lewd noise and Dean feels entirely too empty without them inside.
However now that he thinks of it, he isn’t sure whether Castiel has any keepsakes at all.
«Cass, I’m so full, ‘s good…» He cries, his head falling against Castiel’s shoulder.
«Then yes, I’d be very interested to read that.»
Dean braces himself on his forearms against the wall because his knees feel like they are about to give. «M’, so good.» He purrs.
His nakedness hits different in the bedroom, like it doesn’t exactly belong, but he doesn’t feel nervous about it either. Maybe ‘awkward’ is more like it, but not so much so that’s off-putting.
He isn’t patronizing in the way he does any of it, his actions are casual and natural, and Castiel smiles at him through it, a small shy curve of his lips that is so candid and pure it makes Dean’s heart melt.
«So, tell me Dean, who do you pray to?» The angel wraps his fingers on his own erection. He shivers in pleasure, covering it in what’s left of the lube on his hand.
«Well, you were adequate.» Castiel mockingly counters. Dean growls, playfully latching his teeth against Cass’s skin.
The pleasure is so intense it’s like a knife to his brain, like blissful agony, and he just gives in to it, trusting his lover to take care of him.
“Don’t ever change.” Dean had selfishly imposed the angel right after his unpleasant trip to apocalyptic 2014, yet he doesn’t mind that he has positively ignored the admonition.
«Breath.» Dean reminds him affectionately, hugging him close with his free arm. Castiel follows his directions.
This fic is pretty much sexual therapy for my own mental health. I'm a trans man, and I've had my fair share of terrible sexual encounters that left me quite wary of being seen/touched in bed, and to bottom altogether. Cass's issues with his body are modeled straight after my own brand of body dysphoria, and its related sexual complications. Luckily for him, Dean is a much better partner than the ones I've had for myself.
Thinking about his casual state of undress, a curve just short of a smile creeps on his lips. Time, and Dean’s patient cares, have helped him a lot overcoming the disconnect between his soul and his vessel. When they got together, this kind of direct contact would have made him unbearably nervous, possibly even sent him into a panic, but now it makes him feel appreciated.
Castiel stills, but doesn’t quite stiffen and Dean pushes through.
«You call quantum mechanics interesting? And here I thought Sam was the nerdy one.» He comments without any real sting, because he loves the angel’s inquisitive nature.
«Cuss words are so sexy in your mouth.» He says as he gets his underwear all the way out.
Dean is not sure he has gotten all the points, but the general outline is still clear enough to him. «You talk about the Word with so much reverence despite everything that’s happened.» He considers.
It’s Dean who moves first, chewing on his lips, eyebrows drawn in concentration. Slowly, he gets Cass all the way inside, as a single, drawn out, groan comes out of him, raw and guttural.
I'm sorry I've written not one, but two showers in this fic. Not very ecologic, but no way I'd send those two to bed without some proper clean up after that.
The angel sits against the headrest of the bed, fresh sheets now on, squirming ever so slightly because his ass still feels empty and confused.
But at his core, he’s just as authentic to his self as he’s ever been, and that’s what matters to Dean.
He joins Castiel on the bed, carefully sitting by the edge, and he brings one hand to rest on the angel’s bare thigh. He circles his thumb over it, mindlessly.
«Noted…» Dean replies, kissing Castiel’s neck. «And ditto.» The angel clearly feels the hunter’s smile against his skin, and Dean’s fingers start moving again on his dick.
«Sure. Goodnight, Cass. ‘Love you.» Dean drowsily replies. As he yawns, he closes his eyes to the sight of Castiel’s peaceful expression.
«It’s not just about the act itself. That is rather innocuous on its own. What I’m really asking is for you to take charge, which… scares me. Don’t get me wrong, I trust you with every inch of my soul, and you are so considerate when it comes to my comfort, which I’m beyond grateful for. But despite how curiosity has clearly taken the better out of me, I still feel conflicted about it… I don’t know how I’ll react to it in the moment. So I understand if you don’t want to deal with the possibility of a negative outcome.»
Dean’s hand lazily travels down his crack to his perineum, then comes back up unhurriedly. He repeats the same motion a couple more times, sinking in between his cheeks until he starts brushing his asshole with his fingers, feeling the folds of his skin.
«Dean, I’m going to… Going to come, going to come with you inside...» The words spill out of him the same way they echo in his own head, bouncing off on the walls of his skull. «Going to come as you fuck me… fuck me deep, inside… so full, full of you… Going to…» And Dean shoves in faster, unbridled, calling out for Castiel, dangerously close to the edge himself but determined to get his lover there first.
The end of the joint lights up again as he takes a second hit, deeper this time, and then hands it out to Dean as he exhales.
«You know I’m a devout man.» Dean retorts, feigning offense as he helps Castiel take his underwear out of the way.
«I’m nearly there, so, so close…» The angel’s voice is shakier than ever, and his movements match the rhythm of Dean’s thrusts with amazing coordination. The hunter knows he’s not going to last much longer either.
«I loved it, Dean.» Castiel quietly confesses. «You made it better than anything I could have anticipated. All the wariness I had, you just swept it away. I sometimes fear I don’t give you enough credit for all the care you show me. And I have to hand it to you, you were indeed amazing.»
Dean smiles at him encouragingly. «It’s a gift, Cass. It has never come to me to give you anything meaningful, I’m sorry for that. This is yours now, if you’ll accept it, that is.» He explains.
Castiel accepts it, intertwining their fingers but without moving any closer. Dean doesn’t mind. He knows the angel needs his spaces sometimes.
He has this fear, lodged deep in his mind, to see him slip and end up like the fallen angel he met in 2014, in that crappy timeline he was plunged into by Zacharia. The sheer misery that clouded alt-Cass’s bright blue eyes… it’s gut wrenching just to think back at it.
Then, he puts the joint down and turns to wrap his arms around Dean, on hand buried in the strands of his hair. Dean relaxes in the hug straight away, his fingers tugging on the back of Castiel’s blazer. Not quite digging in, but still grasping it firmly just because it feels good to have something to hold on.
The hunter raises his glass to him. «Cheers Cass. To us, and most importantly tonight, to your ass.» The toast gets a roll of his eyes out of the angel, but it’s soon followed by an affectionate sneer at Dean’s daftness. They strike their glasses together, and proceed to take the first sips of their respective drinks.
He drags his feet towards the kitchen, where a warm cup of coffee is already waiting for him on the table. On a chair by the opposite side, Castiel seats with a hefty book in his hands. He wears his usual outfit, but the trench coat and the blazer are mindlessly placed over the backrest of his seat. The angel has recently started taking them off when he’s inside and the change somehow manages to make him look even more out of place than before, which amuses Dean quite a lot.
The angel’s voice is measured, collected. He’s past his initial shyness. But there's still a distict dose of concern.
Dean shuts him up with a kiss, ungracefully crashing his grin against Castiel’s open mouth. «Well, but does it hurt?» He asks with a cocked up eyebrow as he withdraws.
The clerk is a girl in her late twenties, with blonde hair, an undercut and a long list of piercings and tattoos. She greets them with a polite smile, asking them if they are after anything specific or if they need some help picking something for their needs.
«Out of curiosity, what was that tome you were reading this morning?» Dean asks, cleaning the foam from his upper lip with the back of his hand. The beer is mild, with a thin consistency, but it has a pleasantly fruity, bitter aftertaste which he enjoys.
«No, I suppose not. In which case, we could have breakfast with those cookies tomorrow morning.» There’s enough humor in his tone that Dean doesn’t have to worry about Cass turning into a full-fledged hippy stoner straight away.
He moans, a dirty sound full of satisfaction as his whole body shivers. His eyes open heavily lidded, the heat on his cheeks scorching hot, lips parted, grinning with indulgence.
But he still shivers at the mention of weed.
«Mh, then I don’t mind if we do it together.» Dean muses about it and he feels pretty much on a cloud.
«Yeah well… I think it’s time I give it a second chance myself.» Dean admits, and meekly smiles back.
Dean tugs at the waistband of his boxers with a smirk, like he’s putting on a corny show just for Castiel’s pleasure. When Dean’s boxers dip down his hips, his cock out at half-mast, the angel’s tongue flickers over his lips, openly thrilled by what he sees.
Castiel lights up the joint with a flicker of his hand, a small trembling flame dancing on his index. He takes one small puff, just to feel what pot tastes like on his tongue.
Every second hit Castiel blows the smoke into Dean’s mouth until there’s nothing but the oily roach left behind. The angel puts it out in an ashtray on the bedside table.
Dean gestures with his hand for the angel to keep going, and proceeds to down his coffee with a satisfied exhale.
It’s so different from the vacant, embittered abandonment of Alt-Cass, who popped pills like they were tin-mints.
The notion makes Dean dizzy, and he would like to say something. But words don’t come easily to him, so he settles for a smile which Castiel returns, warm and welcoming.
To Castiel, the pressure on his ass, Dean’s tight grip on his cock, his toned arm hugging him over his bare skin, it all feels strange and unusual, yet so perfect.
There’s only silence lingering in the air for a moment. It’s not because Castiel doesn’t know how to reply, but rather out of respect. He lets the words take up all the time they deserve to settle in.
The reply had made the angel quietly smile, proud of the pleasure he had delivered the night before.
But when the fingers move upwards in their first loose stroke, Dean’s name bursts out of his mouth in a broken wail, his voice cracking high.
«I hit the joint maybe three times when the high hit suddenly and I got paranoid. I was so hang up on trying to get a grip and not make a fool of myself in front of them. I just didn’t expect it to be that different from being drunk, I guess. I chickened out real fast and walked back to the motel where we were staying. It was the longest five minutes’ walk of my life, and the most uncomfortable by a long shot. I have no clue how people can get used to be high and function somewhat normally.» He winces and shakes his head to get the image of alt-Cass, casually admitting to being
«T-shirt?» Dean asks, already reaching for one in the dresser.
That’s his title, and he hears it clearly echoing in Dean’s breaths.
«Dean.»
They have bickered over it a few times now, fought about it maybe once or twice, because Dean is uneasy anytime Castiel gets a bit heavy with alcohol.
«And it is lighter than Tolstoy, right? Because to be honest, I did find War and Peace a bit slow…» Castiel lowers his voice as he says that, like he’s embarrassed to admit it.
The hunter laughs, a hearty giggle full of amusement. «I’ve asked you to wear a cowboy costume to bed and you didn’t even flinch. So, yes Cass, sure. I’ll gladly take your anal virginity.» He cockily elaborates and Castiel’s cheeks flush in embarrassment. Then he adds, pragmatically: «Plus, I assume your bowels are miraculously clean on their own thanks to your… angelic situation.» He gesticulates vaguely towards him like a way of clarification.
«I want to feel your muscles relax, then we’ll bring this to the bedroom.» Dean says, applying more pressure and delicately pushing the tip of his middle finger right to his hole. The angel’s muscles instinctively tense up, and he lets out a little groan. He feels coddled and cared for and he’s not nervous at all, so why won’t his muscles relax?
«I thought you had promised me something else tonight.» Castiel prompts, but he doesn’t sound displeased with their current predicament either, just slightly perplexed.
Dean has been peeling away the angel’s fears with soft nothings whispered in his ear, gentle strokes along Castiel’s ribs with cautious hands slid under his clothes and long, intimate hot showers together.
The statement gets a snort out of Castiel. «I suppose I ought to take that as a compliment.»
"Someone's not over it."
Dean laughed. "Hey, I appreciate it. I'm Dean by the way."
Chuck pointed between the two of them, "This DeanCas love fest is over. Angels live upstairs, humans have the ground floor, demons own the basement. Why? Because when they mingle too much they make monsters." He strolled casually around room, pointing at the TV as a picture of their son appeared on the screen, "And we all know how they turn out. Huge. Messes. That nobody wants to clean up." A red X appeared over Jack's face and a fart sound played over the TV speakers. "I let you have your friends, guys. I get it. What's a hero without allies? But this... too far, fellas. Share a foxhole, share a backseat, sure. But, this is just wrong. Even for you, Dean. I mean, cuddling up to an angel? Making him a love interest? We get it, you have daddy issues. But if you want romance, find someone your own age."
