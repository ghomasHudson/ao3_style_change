Steve goes quiet. "Did you read the Winter Soldier files I sent you?" he asks, and Tony frowns.
"Is he alive?" Rhodey  demands, because nothing else matters.
, and his suit is dead, the arc reactor shattered and aching in his chest and the shield is lying close enough to touch.
He was
“And if I don’t?” Tony asks, curious.
Howard had always been...firm...with Tony. He was an eccentric, strong willed boy. He
“Exactly why she’ll burn it before she lets them have it, flyboy.”
Steve stares down at him, and wonders what he'll do, if Tony says no.
Howard never notices when Mama flirts with or fucks other people, he isn’t sure why he expected him to notice
He was alone, with a sassy kid and a broken suit and Rhodey, and Rhodey was all he'd ever needed, back in college, and that was still true in so many ways it didn't hurt, during the thick of it.
It is, Stane thinks, glaring down at the limp body of Howard Stark, a goddamn mess.
This though--this isn't fighting over a mission, this isn't a friendly disagreement getting too hot.
"More than anything," Steve murmurs and Tony smiles.
"She took a lot of baggage into HYDRA," Tony shoots back. Steve's face goes stubborn and Tony scrubs a hand over his face. He doesn't want to do this, doesn't want to argue with Steve over Wanda fucking Maximoff.
“You won’t. You’re pretty ass is
It’s the way Tony wilts, all the sunlight in his drained away when Steve drives away.
"Will he really?" Rhodey murmurs and Tony snorts. Harley was angrier than any of the New Avengers, but he didn't need to go into that with anyone.
It’s Bucky, who starts it.
Steve has never had a poker face, not when it came to Tony, and he can see the grief, watch it spread across Steve's familiar beloved face, watch it age him until Steve's shoulders straighten and he says, "I'm real."
Bucky shrugs. “You both survived Siberia. That only happens if you both agree to it.”
He drives to Tony’s a few weeks later, for the birthday lunch he’s taken Tony to his entire life, and when Tony opens the door, Steve back him into the empty apartment, against the wall where picture frames of their vacations and Tony’s bots rattle and when he pulls back to suck bruises into Tony’s soft skin, Tony whispers, “I’m legal.”
"It's for the best, Mama," he says, softly.
in him but this--this made him withdrawn and quiet.
He tries very hard to not think about that and what it could mean, for Bucky, when they find him. It's not fair to think about that.
It haunts me. And this happened.
That isn't true, he thinks, wry, as Clint lounges against the building across from him.
Sam walks to the door and he hesitates, looks back at Steve, he looks--tired.
They sleep with the lights on, after that, and it doesn’t stop the flashbacks, doesn’t stop the nightmares.
Steve is sixteen, when he meets Tony for the first time.
For a moment, he wants to ignore it, wants to bury his head in the sand, wants to fucking
He closes his eyes, presses back against the steady strength of him, and Steve leans into him, solid and grounding as the city whips by.
“But--”
"He's been off," Natasha says softly. She’s watching Steve and her gaze is softer than it should be, and intent. "Since Ultron, Tony's been--not quite right."
, let Tony make that last step.
He doesn't see any of the man he spent a night with, and it breaks his heart a little.
It’s annoying, and endearing, because Tony has always been damn good at countering Steve’s worst stubborn impulses, but he doesn’t know how to get Tony’s attention like this.
"What's the Accords?" he asks, and Tony's head tilts.
"I fucking missed you," he gasps and Steve makes a choked noise against his skin.
Tony makes a face, all petulant bratty beautiful. "I could," he grumbles and Steve smiles, draws him down into his arms and kisses him gently.
Anthony is on the throne, almost reclining, the princess giggling in his lap as he whispers to her and she plays with a--
They were
"Go away," he shouts and the knock comes again, brutally loud, shaking the door, until the Pursestrings climbs from his bed and throws the door open.
"You're worth it,' Tony says, softly. "You're worth a thousand companies."
, a peaceful, comforting quiet.
Obie huffs. A metal doll. Of course. The king is playing at a toymaker now. His gaze moves easy over the princess to the queen, standing regal and silent at Anthony's left.
Tony makes a noise, something broken and hurt. Loki is right and he knows it, and he
It’s not. Peggy let him borrow it, because she hasn’t driven in years, not since her eyesight started to fail, but just because she won’t care if the car never comes home doesn’t mean there’s any reason to let it be
Steve glances at Sam as they wait. “The others--”
Tony broke them.
Mind the tags, y'all.
Clint freezes, for a moment, and then, dutifully but voice dripping dread he says, "Hey boss. Steve says hi."
NIck Fury comes to the cafe. It’s a quiet afternoon, almost a month after the fire, when Steve has returned to work and Tony is tucked away in his workshop and the world doesn’t feel like it’s closing in on them both.
, doesn’t remember the door splintering open or Maria’s shrill scream, or anything but--
"Tony--"
The problem is that he let it go too long. But Rogers--the whole obsession Howard had with them, it was outside his hands, something that Howard refused to budge on, and when he realized that they'd
But there’s no way to tell. Not in the first few pictures, the remains so badly mangled and disfigured that they can’t even be called bodies. His stomach twists and heaves, and he flicks a look at Fury.
He's dreamt about Steve. For years, he's dreamt about Steve. About the broad push of his shoulders spreading his thighs. About thick fingers stretching him open. About a wet mouth sucking him off and blue eyes staring up at him with wicked worship bright in them. About large hands closing over his hips, steadying him while Tony rode him. About the taste of his tongue and the salt of his sweat and the bruises he's missed for years now.
Steve pauses, studying Tony. "You think he's an enemy."
Rogers ignored SHIELD, moved into his noisy messy brownstone and never bothered to
the Avengers, honeybear. They do good work but I'm not here to clean up messes. I'm the Futurist," he says, wistful.
They love each other.
"Are you sure you don't want me to go?"
Bucky makes a face, but doesn’t disagree, because Peggy might be wealthy, but the long term care facility was expensive. It was better than the shitty VA that her retirement would have sent her to, though.
The signet ring on his hand, Tony has a divot on his back, from being hit with that hand, that fist. There’s blood on the ring, and he wonders, distant and idle, if it’s his blood.
Not that security clearance meant shit, Rhodey had always been a damn good soldier and a much better
There are pictures though. Of Howard’s face and the bloody wood flooring.
“The training fields,” Winter says, and Tony pauses. Turns that over in his mind and shakes his head.
So he carries it, a  kernel of knowledge that festers and takes root, as the weeks spin on and Steve makes his morning vow and holds him careful in the dark and he wakes trembling, a scream trapped in his throat.
"You know?"
"I had a meeting with him, on behalf of SI," Tony says, slowly, arching an eyebrow. "Not  any of your concern."
He hates himself for it, and hates Tony for it, and hates Sharon for it, too, for being there and smiling so sweet and it's not fair, not right to hate her when she doesn't know about Tony, doesn't know that he's breaking something.
He listens to them, to the dirty teasing on the phone and Tony’s pretty groans as he gets himself off. He listens when Rogers visits, and curls around Tony in his twin bed, the wet kisses loud in the silence, the sound of Steve’s mouth on Tony’s cock impossible to ignore.
Steve
Tony is younger than him, wide-eyed and tiny next to a stack of boxes and watching him, Jim feels a hot flare of worry.
They did.
before his eyes go unfocused. He mumbles, "Whazat?"
He thinks of Steve kisses and the promise he whispers before he goes, every fucking morning, and the way Tony felt so safe in his arms, like nothing could hurt him there, and he carefully tidies the photos, his face very blank. “Thanks for bringing these by,” he says, and Fury smirks.
“They aren’t the only ones who are forever, baby.”
Tony huffs and rolls into him. "I like our apartment."
"I did. I tore us apart and I let Ross put you in that fucking prison. I did that." He snaps, unrepentant.
Steve blinks. The mugger jogs down into the alley and Steve watches, bemused and a little bit baffled as the man throws himself into a dumpster, cursing all the while.
No. That’s not true. He loves Tony, more than he’s loved anyone or anything, a kind of helpless adoration for the tiny, larger than life chaotic disaster. He loves Tony
Steve fixes him with a dark stare. “Not hard enough.”
He fucks him hard, and Tony screams when he comes, spills milky white on the blue bruise and Steve runs a finger, smeared with lube and blood, through it and Tony twitches under him.
Still. He lives for that soft promise and the taste of Steve on his lips that lingers through the morning.
“Yeah,” he taps his fingers nervously, and then straightens up. “I was working on a late birthday present for Steve.”
Tony falls asleep there, on the polished mahogany and Steve tugs his filthy shirt down to cover his cock and balls and then straightens.
It doesn't now.
"It's going to be ok," she whispers in his ear, confidently, and he blinks back tears.
She flushes, and his smiles goes mean. “You know how it is, when you forget little things.”
"Actually no," Clint says slowly. "Strangely enough he doesn't talk about prom at all. I was--sarcasm."
It was--
Loving Tony, being with him when he was married to Peggy--it was never the right thing, it was wrong and he didn’t
Discussion of engineering someone's murder.
And he hadn't given it enough credence--Tony was distractible and hard to handle. Rogers, Stane assumed, would lose patience and interest, would be dragged into SHIELD and spies, and Tony would be ripe for manipulation and control.
Tony nods, a jerky thing, and turns. Pepper is waiting, pale and so tense it’s almost painful to look at her, Morgan cradled in her arms.
Steve isn't so different from his armor, Tony thinks, distant and hysterical.
"Tell me if you find anything," he says instead, and goes back to his report and the headache brewing behind his eyes.
“Why?” he hears himself ask.
. Not perfect. They fight and Tony comes home irritated and sometimes Steve wakes frozen and still, convinced he's still
the voice murmurs.
Steve doesn’t quite smile, but he reaches for Tony, and follows him deeper into the house.
"Pepper. Tony's PA. What--"
“I know I’m behind on the new SAM system,” Tony says, “but in my defense--”
He waits, patient, and wonders what it is that Steve’s looking for in his gaze.
“And your daughter?”
"I missed you, sweetheart," he murmurs, and Tony flinches, steps back involuntary.
Loving Tony has been the best, sweetest pain he’s ever known.
"He won't hurt me," Tony says. "Take it offline."
He doesn’t need to ask, anyway. Why Steve didn’t try again doesn’t matter, not really.
. There's not a chance in hell he'll leave it to the Council, and she knows it.
And he slips.
She grins. "Gwen," she says, and wiggles her fingers at him. "Thanks for the muffin, Cap."
Steve stares at the man he almost killed, the man who did his level best to kill Steve
"Hey," he says, and she pauses, looks at him with a question in her bright blue eyes. "What's your name?"
The fractures were already there.
It’s tense. The room where they sit in silence, after May comes and takes the princess away, and Peter awkwardly retreats to the hall to await whatever comes next.
Tony still hasn't answered him, and he doesn't think he
Licks his lips as he pulls away, and says, "On December 16, 1991, HYDRA gave the Winter Soldier a mission."
His gaze is all wrong, lethal and furious and a spasm of worry goes through Obie.
He fucks Tony until he's sobbing silently, licks the tears from his face, and, later, when he's come and he's carried Tony, dirty and dripping come, to their bed, he licks him clean.
He’s shuddering, a fine little tremble that he doesn’t even notice, until Steve’s strong hand cups the back of his neck.
“This isn’t easy for him either. I know it’s not what you wanted--”
"We got word about a HYDRA base," Tasha says, sprawling across his couch. Sam wrinkles his nose and shoves her dirty boots off his lap.
he was right, and Howard was wrong.
It happens rare enough that he doesn’t mind too much, that it interrupts the morning.
He reads about it in a report from Jarvis.
different, and Tony--
. He's so
It’s easy enough to do, and the truth of it is, he wants to forget.
It’s the way Tony calls Steve every day, chatters for hours while he and Rhodey do their homework.
When the door is shut and Steve watches him with steady eyes like endless skies.
He grins, and finishes his coffee.
, he said, “Hey, Pegs. Let’s get married.”
There's a mugging a week after that, and he runs into the little blonde girl outside his favorite café, looking shifty and then
He sits next to Steve on his couch in the workshop. He doesn't want this in their bed, doesn't want this
His hands have enough blood on them.
"And how is that?" Steve asks.
A pretty pink mouth is turned into a frown, and his long artist fingers are
“No idea. Not sure why the hell he was there to begin with. Not my problem, not my responsibility.”
He's beautiful.
It goes wrong and as the world blows up around him, he thinks,
Please mind the updated tags, and check the end notes for full warning.
Wanda's voice is shaking and he can't tell if that's rage or terror, but whatever it is, it makes everything click into place, and his stomach lurches.
They don’t go out often. The public adoration since the battle had been--disconcerting.
Winter shifts, an almost silky slide of metal that's all menace. "You think he's been bought again?"
and it still stings, the empty places where they should be.
"What of Anthony?" Thor rumbles, and Loki twists, the catch of rough fingers in his hair a hot bolt of pleasure pain before he kisses Thor.
The second time is slower, and it's in bed, and Tony doesn't cry, when Steve fingers him open and slides his cock in, doesn't cry, when Steve kisses him gently and grinds deep, like he's afraid to pull away, doesn't cry, when Steve whispers his name and comes, almost silent in the dark of their bedroom.
"But he still tried," Sam says. "He
"You knew," Sam says, his voice low and furious and Steve doesn't look at him.
But he’s close, closer than he’s been before. “You don’t have to work for SHIELD. I know you don’t want the uniform. But when you can help protect Tony, protect his company--work
When she’s gone.
The tightening of Rhodey’s jaw, the slump in his shoulders--
Steve gently helps Tony inside, slides in behind him and Tony curls against him, his breathing rapid little pants against his throat, and he shifts Tony, into his lap, let’s him curl there for a few minutes, until his heartbeat is calm and the breath feathering over his throat is easy, and then he shifts Tony back, perches him on his knee and says, “He hurt you.”
The quiet in the Compound is different, now.
"I don't--"
Except he didn't.
"It's nothing. Sharon."
Tony is standing near the sliding doors, and next to him is--
But Steve did too. Steve agreed to it, all those years ago, when Tony sat down from him and said,
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're not supposed to be here," Tony says, distorted and familiar, and Steve shrugs. Slings the shield and takes out a HYDRA agent aiming at Tony's back. He jumps to catch it and slams it down into another black clad goon.
"What happens now?" Jessica demands, finally, and all eyes swing to Tony, and he smiles.
"You still have it," Tony breathes.
could know, it was one of the few things they'd fought about, he'd insisted. "I've known Tony since he was pre-pubescent," Rhodey continues. "Do you really think he can manipulate me or tell little white lies? I'm not the fucking press corps," he says, almost offended, and Natasha laughs.
He doesn’t want that today. “Gonna fuck you hard, baby,” he says and Tony shivers, his head bobbing eagerly.
“I think I saw everything in college, so no reason to hide it now,” Rhodey says dryly.
"I don't know why you invited him," Steve says later, while Tony tosses empty bottles of wine.
Steve has a goddamn filthy mouth, and that’s nothing new, but it’s different, tonight, lying so close to Bucky, so hard it hurts, and listening to Steve opening Tony up.
Rhodey blinks. "But we signed the Accords," he says dumbly.
“Hey, Steve,” he says, and Steve looks at him over the top of his paper because he’s a fucking luddite and still reads a paper, just to fuck with Tony.
He’s handsome, all-American pretty with a nose that’s been broken at least once to liven up the perfection, and he’s got one big hand on Tony’s shoulder, tugging him lightly back and he’s watching Jim like he’s a threat, and Tony--Tony grins, leans into him like he’s a particularly handy pillow and says, carelessly. “This is my roommate. Jim.” His nose wrinkles, and he shakes his head. “That’s awful. Rhodey is better.”
Steve is a shield, between him and the world, and he doesn’t know what this cost--but he knows that Ty is gone and he is safe, and no one has asked him anything. He thinks maybe that’s enough.
“Is he here?”
It takes two days.
"I'm not
“Take me home,” Tony begs, and he nods, wraps an arm around his waist and steers them toward the door, leaving Howard still collapsed on the carpet and Stane shouting and Maria in tears.
the only thing that keeps the New Avengers from all out attacking Steve's team.
It's what he wants.
"I love you," she says, because Pepper has always been braver than he is, and he flinches, a little. "Being your queen. Your wife. Being your friend and partner--that has been the greatest honor of my life, the thing I have loved more than anything beyond our daughter. I will never regret these seven years, or loving you."
Tony knows it. He hears them, sometimes. He installs a basic AI in SI, and monitors the company and he hears them talking.
It takes Jarvis two hours to clean up the blood in the study, where it's puddled sticky and thick on the hard wood, splattered against the walls.
Tony leaves the room, in the wake of his bombshell.
“I’m gonna go down to the workshop after breakfast,” he says, and Steve smiles, slow and pleased and Tony--Tony grins back, helpless to do anything else.
He’d batted his eyelashes, once, just
“Heard you got home safe,” Fury says, mildly, and Tony snorts.
"The Compound is on lockdown," FRIDAY says, and her voice is sweet, almost.
“He’d never forgive you. And I’d never hurt him.” Rhodey didn't say anything, before turning away and letting the gun fall away.
He waits until Tony is home, until the shock’s worn off and he’s functioning again, because he thinks if he calls and tells Rhodey when Tony is still unable to answer a phone, the man will come storming in full of fear and fury and he’s pretty sure that it’ll get violent.
melts away.
Tony screams again, and then the noise is all cut, silenced by the sickening sound of Rhodey slamming into the earth.
When they were so fucking happy together it never occurred to Steve that it might end, that the worry that pinched at Tony's eyes might be something that could destroy them.
“When are they coming back, Potts?”
“We’re still working on it. On color. But. It’s--I want you to have this. You deserve to have this. Bucky tested it, and his body hasn’t rejected it, so--” Tony takes a breath. Smiles, small and brittle and Steve remembers him, before, larger than life with his grand gesture presents, with tech and suits and weapons and homes.
He's better than he has been in seven years and he's going to fall apart, because this doesn't happen, he doesn't get to
Steve tells them, Tony and their best friends, what is coming, what will kill them and then kill them to undo. Tony listens, intent and serious in a way that Steve rarely sees here, in his sunshine lover, his pretty bratty baby.
Steve agrees because he'll take what he can get from Tony, has always been painfully easy for Tony, and a date in the penthouse means he'll be able to fuck his frustrations out on Tony's pliant, beautiful body.
Still--Tony didn’t go to boarding school. Howard kept his hands and his fists off the boy. He grew up with distant parents and Steve, Steve, who walked away from SHIELD and the shield and threw himself headlong into being everything that Tony needed.
He knows what this is. What it means, what these
“We’re not going to discuss them anymore. It’s over,” he says, decisively. “I don’t want to think about them. SHIELD took care of the scene and it’s over.”
Steve smiles at him when he slips into the spacious apartments in the north tower, and for a moment, standing in the warm homey room, it's like the past seven years never happened. Steve is sprawled on the chaise, one leg bent with his barefoot rests against the wood, a sketch almost forgotten in his hands as he looks at Tony.
But he knew that when he took the stones, he knew that the first time he fucked Peggy, and when he gave her all the information she’d need to burn HYDRA out of SHIELD.
He looks at the display again. Steve is sitting in his room, staring directly at FRIDAY'S sensor. It makes his breath catch, that steady gaze.
things.”
“Tony, sweetheart. I’ve been worried,” she says, her voice a tight censure that makes him tip his head and smile. “You didn’t let us know, when you came home. Obie said you were using his house, and then there was that horrid fire, and I thought the worst.”
He thinks he groans, and realizes a second too late that it’s Bucky, when Steve laughs, dark and pleased. “Yeah. Bucky likes that. Jim does too. Used to get off, listening to us in that little dorm room.”
what Tony sounds like, when he's made up his mind. Tony won't back down for this, even if it doesn't make sense. "Don't do this," Steve begs and Tony--Tony smiles at him, a tiny crooked thing, goes up on tiptoes for just a moment, pushing a kiss against his lips. He's all long lean lines and steady weight against Steve and he clutches at that, desperate.
“How much do you remember about Howard sending Steve away?” Rhodey asks and Tony frowns. Shakes his head.
He just doesn’t know how the fuck he’s supposed to let go of the only dream he’s ever wanted.
“You didn’t,” he says, fiercely and Steve looks down at him. “She made her choice, Steve. She did. And maybe--maybe what we did wasn’t fair. But she made her choice before I fell in love with you, before you ever dreamed about being with me. Peggy died alone because she pushed everyone away from her, and that happened before the divorce.”
"It's one base, Steve. The council can handle one base. HYDRA is never going to recover from what you and Winter did, after Triskelion. This isn't that."
"Steve, I'm sorry," Tony says, and he's babbling about making it up to Steve, about making him dinner and moving date night to the penthouse, and Steve--
Howard’s lips twitch, angry. “Let’s talk about your responsibility for a moment, Anthony. Since you brought it up.”
Her gaze stays fixed on him for a long time. When she finally stands to leave, she pauses and looks back. “You know, you can tell me.”
"I think they're everywhere," Tony says, bluntly. "And this--doing this, getting back into politics and breaking the team--it's going to buy us time."
"They want to tag us like

It’s this:

, a kind of slack slumped to it that Tony doesn’t understand until Fury says, very gently, “We found this man. He was cut in half, by a crescent shaped blade.
He makes a noise he hates himself for as  she hugs him, her body tiny and soft and familiar against him.
"It wasn't planned," he says, waving a hand. "Stark, you'll be in touch?"
and now, home, with a distinguished military record under his belt and more nightmares than he can put quietly to rest--he’s not ready to stop now, either.
"Mine," Tony says, gently. Inexorable. "The Mansion is mine. The house in the Hamptons. The penthouse. The house in Aspen and in Switzerland and in California and Japan--shall I go on? Howard left everything to me. He left this," he waves a hand, "to you."
is waiting. Steve grits his teeth as it powers up, the blades sending up a whirlwind of grass and grit. He pulls Tony back a step and slides the door shut, and tries not to let his hurt show when Tony pulls himself out of Steve's grasp.
Tony is scared. He's happy, but he's
He's miffed, a little, that the captain stopped, that he didn't take this to it's natural and proper end.
"Four and half goddamn years, Wilson, and you're gonna throw it away to punch me?"
"It's expected. Besides, it's good to keep your enemies where you can see them."

"You were in the 'shop, weren't you?" he says. "There was no meeting."
“You’re making us a laughing stock,” Howard snaps.
“Howard, I’ll stay with him until he orders me away. I may not be brilliant--but I’m not stupid either.”
say those words.
Bucky has been quiet, in the days since the initial presser, quiet that makes Steve nervous because Bucky is only quiet when Winter feels too close. Anger burns hot and
"The government and the Accords council is clean of HYDRA. Ross is being tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Peter and Harley are working on a peace-keeping initiative that means when the world ends, we're not carrying it all. And SHRA was killed on the Senate floor last week."
“She’ll find out,” Steve bites out and Tony stills. Stares at him, pleasure foggy and crystal sharp. “She’ll find out and when she does--I’ll choose you. I’ll
"I'm never going to stop being Ironman," Tony says, and he sounds
Rhodey glares into nothing and Bucky’s arms tighten around him.
It isn’t a question.
Happy calls Rhodey.
“Would you get one, again? If you could make it stick, this time. Would you get another tattoo?”
Tony makes a noise, punched out and wounded, and Steve recoils, eyes flitting up, but Tony catches his hand, drags it back and fits it to his skin.
"Steve," he says, and nothing more.
He takes a deep breath and says, "JARVIS, open up the Cassandra Protocol."
Tony rocks back on his heels. His eyes are hidden behind sunglasses—he hasn’t worn sunglasses in a setting like this in so long it’s
He notices, of course, and his jaw clenches a little, furious because it’s so goddamn blatant, the way her fingers brush over Steve’s wrist, and her neckline dips when she leans into him, and her eyes track his ass when he rises to assist Jarvis.
“You’re boy is a lot,” Rhodey says, mildly and Tony tenses. Because Rhodey has never liked any of the many people Tony’s dated, never made any secret of his dislike of them, and it never bothered Tony, because Rhodey
And maybe that's turnabout being fair play and all, because he didn't call either.
“We’ll get where we’re going,” he says, softly, and then reaches for the vial of inky dark liquid. “Did you know the serum won’t let a tattoo take?”
It takes years, adjusting and manipulating and building, but Tony puts a suit of armor around the world, a protective field against any mad Titans wandering with genocide on their minds.
"You said we could watch Terminator,' Tony complains, and Steve nips at his lip, just to get him to shut up.
Clint sticks almost stubbornly close.
and he isn’t sure who moves, only knows that they’re kissing, rough and hungry and there’s blood on his lips, the taste of it in the kiss and Tony moans, rocking into him, and Steve thinks, startled,
It's going to be a hassle, getting Tony to trust him, getting him away from Rogers.
I'M BACK!!!! I am back and will be updating every day or so until this is finished. Enjoy our idiots being idiots.
The call comes from Rhodey, the
The sound of a repulsor makes Steve freeze, going still as he stares up at Tony.
prodding at his brother’s bandage wrapped stump.
"You think HYDRA is still in DC?"
He looks positively delighted, and Steve grins when he follows it up with, “Come on. He’s waiting for you.”
"What the fuck do you think that dossier was?" Clint snarls and Natasha smiles.
He's dreamt about this, about Steve. It's better, he thinks, delirious and sobbing, as he sinks down on Steve's cock, as Steve's hands spasm around his hips and he bites bruising kisses into Tony's throat, as he works Tony on his cock like a ragdoll toy, groaning and cursing.
it's a good plan because you never plan so anything sounds good."
And it's a brutal, unwelcome reminder that much as he wishes he could close his eyes and pretend the past seven years hadn't happened--they had.
They clung to each other. They love each other, and everything changes, because of it.
"Tony's joining us for dinner," Steve says, and Tony flicks a glance at him. He can't actually be
But it's good.
isn’t, so he isn’t sure why he expected the world to be, why he expected the city to be. It’s painful, being back, digging at wounds he thought long since healed, and he hates them for aching still, hates himself for taking Peggy’s beat up old clunker down to the shore. It’s early enough in the spring, a chilly bite to the air, that it’s as close to deserted as it ever gets, and he sits there, listening to the waves crashing and the ghosts in his memory and wonders how the fuck he got here, a million miles away from the life he wanted.
He still hears the low murmur of Steve’s voice through the thin bedroom wall, and the wails that Tony’s pillows don’t muffle.
“Please, beloved,” Tony gasps, once, and Steve shouts, his name, ripped from him among the curses and pleas and Tony convulses, hole fluttering tight around him.
“Can you come?” Tony asks, and his voice is shaking. “I--she knows. Can you--”
by it.
He does.
“You could pull over,” Tony says, interrupting himself and Steve arches an eyebrow. Tony wiggles, straightens in his seat. “Or I could blow you while you drive.”
"I don't think you get that it's not about what I want. I
"Why do you think it's thirty-six hours? Blowing a Jericho and making nice with the brass only takes about an hour."
“I don’t give a shit about people, Director.”
He sways a little when he stands, and his stomach turns, but he keeps his feet by sheer stubborn will. "I want a meeting in ten minutes."
God it's good to be back home.
Steve had asked her, once, if it bothered her, that they were gay. It didn't though. They were devoted to each other, a kind of fierce obsessive love that made her vaguely lonely, jealous in a longing sort of way.
"Yes," Tony says.
Tony tips his head. "You read the dossier. You know why I did it."
Steve is quiet, after they’re gone, but it’s not the tense kind of quiet that makes Tony anxious, it’s--quiet, comfortable, pensive almost. He watches Steve from across the room as he makes dinner, his eyes distant, like he’s lost in memories.
"Mmm, but you like your boss. And you haven't run me off yet. None of you have. So I'm thinking you don't mind me too much."
He thinks about it, and the longer he thinks, the angrier he becomes.
"Stop harassing the help," Tony snarls and Steve laughs.
Sam smiles, stiff and unhappy. "Don't got anywhere to be."
"It isn't real," he whispers.
"But--"
"I fuckin' might," Sam shouts and Tony snorts.
“He’s--sleeping,” Tony says, shortly, throwing a quick look at their bedroom door. Steve is exhausted, or the knock would have woken him. “Why are you here?”
“You’re running away,” Steve says, finally, finding his voice.
It feels like the first one in four fucking
"She'd never take you."
Steve is sitting on the edge of their bed, when Tony emerges from the bathroom. He's only a little surprised that the other man wasn't asleep after all.
He loves Tony.
It's a sprawling villa in the country. The villa is too large for her but it's lovely, perfect for entertaining, everything that the wife of Howard Stark has come to expect and need. There's a vineyard and a stable with a few horses, a pool. It's perfect.
Because Steve has a beard, so dark it only glints golden in the firelight. There are lines around his lips and eyes, his hair longer and that armor that is so very strange and familiar.
“He can help,” she murmurs, and some of the fight goes out of him. Steve looks up at her, at the tired lines of her face, and the tear tracks she didn’t quite cover, and the way her eyes are bright and hopeful as she watches the kid.
It irritated Howard. And he was a smart man, the smartest she'd ever met. Surely he knew what he was doing, when he corrected Tony.
He doesn’t actually remember
“Tony upset?” he asks, flipping his sketchbook closed and stretching to his feet.
T’Challa arrives moments after Steve settles himself at the war table. Natasha and Wanda are lounging at the end, Sam straight backed and intent at his elbow, Bucky lingering a few steps away.
It takes two days but on the second, when the sun is setting and the court has dispersed for the evening and Morgan has been tucked into bed, Natasha pauses. "He's waiting for you," the spymaster says, and he tips his head at her. She smiles, a small thing. "In our home. Go. I'm tired of a sulky knight and a pining king."
He’d damn himself to hell a thousand times over, to be with Tony.
Fury holds his gaze. “We could use you, Rogers. Don’t put on the uniform, but you can help people.”
“Serum happened,” Steve shrugged. “Body pushed it out. I kept redoing it--poor Jones got real tired of me showing up at his tent--but it never took. I had it, when I went into the ice.”
Ross stares back, all flat and unconvinced and Tony smiled, shark-toothed and media bright. "General, I'm a law abiding citizen. I signed the Accords. I want nothing more than to keep the world and my family safe."
he’d burn the world and damn it to hell, to keep anything from hurting Tony again.
. You tore us apart and--"
He has nightmares.
Tony's eyes narrow, considering and he straightens. Shrugs a little, lithe and unconcerned, even as his gaze is sharp and angry.
“Stay here. I’ll be home tonight. The funeral--”
“I have something, I think. I’ll dust it off,” Tony mumbles, and Rhodey laughs, like it’s a foregone conclusion, and Tony thinks--
He wakes up and he’s exactly where he was when he fell asleep, curled on the couch, back aching a little, Rhodey’s shoulder solid and familiar under his hair, the weight of his arm comforting around his shoulder. He curls a little closer and Rhodey’s grip tightens.
I apologize for the delay--life got real crazy in August, but it's hopefully settled down.
Like this, he can hold Steve against him, hold him close and sheltered,
Something crashes in the kitchen and Pepper jerks out of her thoughts, darts into the other room to find Steve on his knees. There's a tinny voice coming from the phone and she scoops it up. "Hello?"
“Tony--” he chokes and Tony shifts.
Just smiles, shark sharp and just as cold. "You did what you had to, to protect your family, Barton. Don't come for my throat because I'm doing what I have to, to protect mine."
Tony eyes him speculatively and huffs. "We can go look at it."
“Rogers,” he says.
He broke time and found Tony and he kept him
It's a toy, a nameday present for Morgan that he and Rhodey had built together, a walking talking doll spelled by Loki and built by them, and she would love it.
"It won't work," Tony says.
"He's still alive, Steve," an unfamiliar voice is shouting and Pepper's blood runs cold.
It’s the sweetest thing Tony’s ever done for him, in a decade of gifts and sacrifice.
“He won’t say. He wants to see you.”
He watches from the shadows.
“You destroy everything you touch,” Howard breathes, his voice shaking.
Pepper’s lips tighten and Rhodey shifts, placing a restraining hand on Tony’s arm.
Tony blinks at him. It stings. More than losing his inheritance--the thought of losing Jarvis hits like a blow.
“You taught me that,” Tony purrs and Howard snarls, lashing out.
, and if he thought Tony needed this warning, he'd get it to him.
"Tony left," Steve says, gently. "He left the Avengers. We're not his priority to protect."
And that changed everything, reshaped the world.
He kisses her.
"Tell him I'm coming there," Steve rasps and she blinks at him. Something's shifted in the big man and she shivers because he's always seemed gentle, endlessly kind, even if his devotion to Tony bordered obsessive.
“I’m not making sex toys,” he says, waspish and Bucky grins.
There is no team.
“Gonna carry you inside. You can rub your little cock against me while I carry you, ride me like you like so much. Won’t matter. You come like this, I’m still gonna fuck you raw.”
He has the tech.
"Did you do this?" Rhodey asks. "Did you engineer Ross' being arrested?"
"So are you," Rhodey says, pointed, and that does get Tony to look up, eyes gleaming dark and exhausted. "What're you doin', man?"
Rhodey sighs, slowly. "You took me out of that wheelchair," he says softly. "You gave me back my legs, and you gave me my wings. Rogers didn't take anything from me that I can't get back, if you put your mind to it."
"Once," he answers. "And I gotta admit, that it's not what I expected. I'll comply with the Accords, Ms. Everheart, and the Council--but no one deserves that. Certainly not the people who saved the world, a few times."
He leans over, brushes his lips against his cheek, the scars unfamiliar and somehow soft under his lips, and breathes, “Thank you, sweetheart.”
"Course," Clint says carelessly, reaching across the table to swipe half of Steve's bagel. "I know a lot of shit about you, dude. I've been with Tony for almost five years. You don't spend that kind of time with the guy and not hear about you and your fucking pretty eyes or your scrappy attitude or the art you drew on your history notebook or fucking prom."
Steve thinks—this is what convinces him. What convinces the team.
"Your Majesty," Obie says, uneasy.
People talk.
, Nat, it was worth it. I'd do anything, for that."
Watching Peter sprawl across the tarmac is terrifying, but it's nothing like watching Rhodey fall.
Blinks again. "Did I help Rogers bust his band of backstabbers outta your underwater pokey? Is that what you're asking?"
There’s a tiny voice that says he’s breaking the world.
"I don't understand why we have to do it this way," Steve says, quiet, when Tony goes quiet, when he's still and his voice is hoarse and the only sound in the workshop is DUM-E and U.
The last bit is just loud enough for Mama to hear, and she sits back, color bright in her cheeks, and Tony smiles, smug. He chances a glance at Steve, but he’s smiling, amused and pleased if the way his gaze flicks to Tony’s mouth is any indication.
“He’d never hurt me,” Tony says.
When he kisses Steve it’s desperate and hungry and triumphant, and Steve
Clint gives him an amused look and Steve shrugs. "Can't blame me for trying."
Fury pulls an envelope from the pocket of his trench coat and tosses it at him, watching while Tony catches it, almost reflexively, his mouth tight and angry.
the Rouges home.”
He doesn’t know how long it lasts, how long he spends feasting on the sweet pouty mouth, pressing open wet kisses to Tony’s long neck and delicate clavicle, sucking bruises there.
"It terrified me," Tony confesses one night, almost a month after his father's funeral. Steve is sitting on the couch with Tony on the ground between his legs, working out the knotted and tensed muscles in his lover's back. "Being in control of all of our employees, and the big decisions. I know I'm not the final decision maker--we have to run everything through the Board, and Stane has enough stock to counter most of what I do. But I'm the owner--it's my name on the company, I have the majority. They can't stop me if I decide I want to do something, not without a fight."
He blinks at Pepper. "Tell him I'm coming to bring Tony home."
“Yeah. He told me. So I’ll make a deal with you, Jim. When they get married, we’ll give ‘em the Hamptons house.”
He sips the coffee and arches an eyebrow. "That was fast," he comments.
"Who is this?" she says sharply, and reaches for Steve's hand.
"Three weeks," Rhodey says. The flat tone is almost accusatory and Tony blinks at his best friend.
Tony scoffs and stretches. The shirt catches against his hard cock. His shorts are so short Steve can see the dusky skin of his balls. “You’d never let anything hurt me.”
and it kind of terrified him, to think of Tony at his mercy.
There's a moment, while Bucky holds Sam back and Tony blinks at them both, that he thinks--
“I can’t just crash here forever, Sam,” Steve says, gently, and Bucky stiffens, all outraged anger.
"Thanks, Tony," Natasha says and he blinks at her. She's breaking ranks with her team, striding across the narrow space that still separates them, slipping into his space and then--
He looks younger. Tired.
She watches the rallies that spring up to support the SHRA and red mist shivers around her. "They want us caged and collared," she snarls. "Like we are beasts."
He thinks briefly, of the castle full of strangers, of his daughter and Pepper and he jerks, "
Tony is sprawled in the passenger seat, and Steve has driven this route a thousand times since he bought the place in the seventies with Peggy--but Tony is sprawled in the passenger seat, and he’s sunkissed and beautiful, a lazy smile on his lips as he chatters and it’s always been impossible to look away from Tony.
"Incoming call, Boss," FRIDAY says and Tony scrubs a hand over his face.
He's changed, and is considering sleep because the day has been long and emotionally exhausting and as good as it is to be under one roof again, to have his team back, that emotional exhaustion isn't going away anytime soon, not until the initial anger and resentment fades.
There’s a wet spot on his shirt, growing.
"It's--it doesn't help you or your team for me to be here," he says. "And it doesn't help me. I'm not an Avenger anymore."
"And the Rogues?"
“Piece of
"That's such a spectacularly bad idea, Steve," he says, and Steve frowns. "She's your team. And she hates me."
Before he left for DC.
He quit offering to help after the first two months, when they got into a screaming match and Tony hid in his bedroom for three days. Sometimes, Tony was pretty sure he could see the want in his eyes, could see his fingers twitch towards helping before he forced himself still, a strained smile on his lips, but it happened less and less, and he almost didn’t mind, these days.
there’s something between them, something building that’s been there for so long he can’t remember when it wasn’t.
When he’d pulled away, Tony blinked at him, dazed and panting, lips swollen and a hint of lipstick smeared on his mouth.
“There’s something else, Tony,” Rhodey says, slowly.
Fuck.
“You think I won’t do it?”
Tony's face does something, then, something complicated and displeased, before he tucks it away and breezes through the weapons specs, and in just a few minutes, he's being dismissed, and DUM-E is tugging him away as Tony slides his welding goggles on and it feels
It’s still strange that they’re here, together. After--
Steve is off, for a few days, scouring the news and quiet, drawing and almost
"The Rift War kept the Howlers busy--the kingdoms, really. I saved the Wakandan king, during it, and he welcomed me and my pack into his kingdom. They reforged my armor," he adds, and Tony's gaze snaps down, to that strange armor that's familiar and not, and he realizes abruptly
Tony’s breath catches and he glances over.
“Did you know?”
"Go *home, Steven."
He stands, throws his plate in the sink with a clatter, and stalks away while Steve stares after him.
Now, though, with Tony safely back in his arms, his nightmares return, and they’re different now. He is trapped in ice, and the screams he hears aren’t his. It’s Tony screaming, and in his icy prison, Steve can see him, can see the way he fights, and claws at Stone, before he screams and Stone shoves into him and Steve shouts, frozen and unmoving and furious, unable to protect him, unable to
The sun is setting when Steve parks in front of the Hamptons house. Tony is snoring softly and Steve smiles, circles the car and lifts him carefully out. He props Tony on the roof of the Astin and kisses him. Like this, Tony is taller than him, a change that sends a shiver down his spine as they make out, Tony’s kisses drowsy and sweet.
Clint won’t tell him, how Tony has ordered him to be handled, but he doesn’t really
“Howard’s in the hospital,” he says, blunt and to the point, when Rhodey answers the phone. “Rogers found him hitting Tony and beat the hell out of him.”
Tony will be home soon, and will need him.
Tony snorts, and zips away, and it's only as he goes that Steve realizes that War Machine is on the field, that the team looks almost whole as they fight, Sam and Rhodey covering each other, seamlessly. There are new faces and Tony's voice rings out a few times, cutting through the noise to shout over the battle before he huffs and the comm in Steve's ear screeches before Tony is there, over-riding their tech and making the whole thing
It’s the way sometimes, when he’s drifting on the edge of sleep, he can hear Tony masturbate, the slick glide of his fist and the gasping little moans shaped like Steve’s name.
Steve smiles, because it’s true. “Still not letting you blow me while I’m driving, sweetheart,” he says, severely and Tony pouts.
He was the most important person in Tony’s world, right there with Jarvis.
, somehow, but his phone buzzes, a new text, and he shoves it aside.
"Oh fuck," Rhodey breathes.
"You don't have a spymaster," Obie snaps, because it's been a point of contention.
The perfume is thick and cloying and he looks at her, across the sleeping body of his lover, this woman he never meant to marry.
He breathes.
It shouldn’t be that easy.
The cook is quiet, but there's something cold in her gaze. "Yes, ma'am," she murmurs.
“She likes your damn armor,” Bucky grumbles, and some of the tension breaks, as the two knights slip into the workshop. Tony uses their presence to put space between him and Steve, something he knows Steve notices, but doesn’t mention.
He doesn't remember finding Tony.
“Whatever you think I should know.”
“Not the director anymore, Nick,” she says primly and he would laugh--is expected to laugh, but he’s not sure he can, not when the evidence of Tony’s abuse is staring at him, not when he’s got no idea how to contain an enraged super soldier, not when one of their goddamn founders is lying bloody and broken in a hospital bed waiting to be pieced back together.
"Why?" she asks, sharply and Tony smiles tight and turns to Steve. Arches an eyebrow.
Tony nods, because he knew the details of that battle better than he did Morgan's favorite bedtime story.
, letting him go back to inventing. It takes three months to roll out the Freedom line, something he thought would take at least a year.
There is nothing there that he recognizes, nothing of his friend in the cold, angry eyes and bitter set to his mouth.
"Because in the morning, I'm meeting with a legal team from SI to discuss how to rework them," Tony says quietly. "I'm throwing as much money, as many lawyers as I can buy to fix this mess."
Or on the angry end of his bodyguard's temper.
"It's time, baby girl. Final stage of Cassandra Protocol."
“Stevie says you’ve been down here for most of a week.”
They proved that.
Rhodes wakes up in medical, and even before he's fully awake, he's thrashing, fighting the hands on him, screaming around the tube in his throat.
It's perfect.
About the future that Steve came from, the one he destroyed to love Tony.
But it helps.
“Where is he?”
“What the hell are you doing?” he snaps, and dark dark eyes flick to him.
"Man, I told Rhodey I didn't want to do this. Too much couples counseling."
He smells like sex and sunshine, like the cologne Steve gave him two years ago, that Peggy had picked out from France.
Rhodey steps out of the cab and pushes Bucky from his mind, beelining past Rogers to scoop the tear-streaked Tony off the couch and into his lap.
There’s a muted snarl and a cry that’s utterly unfamiliar and achingly recognizable and he thinks, very distantly, that it’s what Tony sounds like, when he’s scared.
And on a clear summer day in the future that Steve promised them--Bucky marries him in a quiet courthouse.
The king sweeps in, his sister at his side, the pair flanked by three of his Dora Milaje. Even after two years of friendship and the King’s strange patronage, Steve fights the urge to rise and bow. The way that Sam twitches at his side makes him think he’s not the only one.
“You fixed that, didn’t ya?”
and her stomach turns, the sherry sitting heavy and sour in her belly.
"I'm sorry," Tony says in a rush.
When Tony said,
Steve punches one Senator.
A battle cry.
Tony's been kidnapped before. He made almost a habit of it, when they were in college.
The knock comes too early, while Lord Stane is still in his small clothes, a whore curled in his bed, wine on his breath.
Tony surprises him. It takes another two fights--real ones this time, a barfight because some dick was talking shit to his girlfriend, and breaking up a fistfight in an alley--before Tony acts.
Clint leaves. He's a little surprised that it's only Clint, that all of his team stays planted in their seats aside from the archer, that none of Tony's flinch.
And then Tony went to MIT and he came home, all gangly limbs and pink pouting lips and a smile that was shaded familiar.
hear, is the shattered glass falling from the minibar and the portrait of Captain America Howard commissioned when Tony was six, and Steve, Steve,
Steve's mouth snaps closed. Sam is standing now, trembling with fury. "Have you at least checked on him?"
They’re in the parlor, and Maria is laughing, this irritating fluttering thing, her fingers brushing against his wrist, and he wants to move away but isn’t sure
He won’t fuck him. “Not until you’re legal,” he murmurs against Tony’s lips as he holds sixteen year old hips, skinny and sweet, still and jerks him, rough and deep.
, not when he considered that this team wasn't his--Clint and Thor all left in the wake of his own withdrawal from the team, Bruce was gone before he was. This team was Cap's and it
It gets him a smile, sleepy and sweet, and everything he wants.
Howard snarls, pushes closer, and Tony smiles, wicked sharp, “Steve’s here, you know. Sleeping. But here. You sure you wanna hit me?” His gaze tracks over Howard’s face, the barely discernible breaks. “I think this time he might kill you.”
"Of fucking course he is," Steve snapped, stung and Sam glares at him, unhappy.
"Like you did with Ultron," Clint asks, and Tony doesn't flinch.
He's quiet, and stares into the dark, unseeing, for a long time, after Bucky falls asleep.
And he makes his decision.
He smiles and he smiles and he smiles and sometimes, at gala's and charity events that don't include children dressed up like Ironman and Captain America, his smile is fake and strained and plastic, because Tony has been preforming since he was a child, has been paraded in front of the public since before he could speak and he's
Steve studies it briefly, and then nods, satisfied.
There are whispers, too, about them, when they go to charity events and public functions.
He tightens his grip on Tony’s ass and carries him inside.
“I don’t know.”
He doesn’t look at Steve, just smiles and says. “Ty is like a rat, Mama. He’ll turn up eventually.”
"Obie would never hurt me, " Tony says, softly.
It goes sideways because it's so fucking easy, slipping into what they once were, fighting side-by-side with people he can't help but trust, even though he
Steve laughs and it’s rueful. “I never really meant to marry her.”
Tony has told his people to keep clear of Steve.
He loves Steve like this--soft and sleepy and vulnerable. He loves that Steve trusts him enough to let him see him, even now.
It was easy enough, falling into her.
"Tony?" Steve asks, softly, and lowers his sketchpad. He's watching Tony, eyes narrow and concerned, bright and so full of love.
“Ask Pegs for your trust fund and use the money to do something you
since he thought of her, and longer still since he saw her.
A hand, light on his shoulder, familiar fingers curving around the bone and muscle, a tether of flesh and bone that’s stronger than steel or his shield.
Steve hadn’t let him.
It'd be hard, but he stares at Howard, and makes a face.
"What's this all about, Tony?" Obie says, grinning as he approaches the throne.
believes him.
protected Tony.
“I have grieved you for seven years,” he says softly. “And it will destroy me, to send you away. But Morgan is not something I will bargain with you about. She is my child, and innocent.”
"The Iron Keep will be ruled by Queen Regent Pepper, until Princess Morgan comes of age," he says, and Thor hums, a thoughtful little noise, mildly curious. Bless him, Loki thinks, fondly, he had not one whit of interest in intrigue, in the political maneuvering that ruled the Six.
?" he asks, and he's naked and vulnerable and this questions matters, more than any he's ever asked.
He should only ever be happy and cared for, a lazy spoiled prince, bratty and cruel in his kindness.
"She's got a lot of baggage from HYDRA, still," Steve allows.
He’s been hard since Tony pranced out to the car, in a tiny pair of shorts that leave his long legs bare and barely cover his ass, a too large shirt drooping off his shoulder. It’s Steve’s, a shirt Tony stole a few years ago, the night Steve jerked off while Tony whined and begged from where Steve had handcuffed him to his bed.
knowing and not and blanket acceptance, shines back.
His shoulders are hunched and he is naked and hard and littered with bruises, each of them from Steve’s worshipful hands and hungry mouth, and he looks--
Tony comes in before they can settle, close enough on his heels that Steve thinks he should have waited, and he looks breath-takingly good, just like he had yesterday, when he'd stared at them and refused to falter, refused to even look at Steve. He glances at him now, a quick fleeting thing before his gaze sweeps over the room, noting their anger and confusion.
He goes silent, listens as Tony reels off the benefits the team won’t lose, listens to him appoint Maria Hill to be their contact within SI, listens as he says, rocking on his heels and hesitant for the first time. “I think that’s everything. Go save the world.”
But it's
“Don’t act surprised, Fury. It’s a bad look and neither of us believe it.”
Tony refocuses his attention on her. "Come on in, Ms. Potts. Tell me what you've got."
Fury sighs and bites the bullet. There’s no way to ease into it, and she wouldn’t appreciate it even if he did. “Howard found the Valkyrie.” She makes a noise, wordless and hurt and he follows it up with, “He’s alive, Carter.”
. He trusted Tony and walked right into hell with him, dammed them both to lies and loneliness, to years spent apart and distrust--
“You waited longer than I expected,” Steve says, and Fury cocks his head, and smiles.
the change.”
They are.
, a constant ache that ended in pain and loss that cut so deep he ran, broke time itself to undo it, and he did.
He makes that same noise, the horrible hitching sob that Rhodey
His cool, expressionless eye gleams back.
He sounded so fucking
“Tell you what?” he asks, and she shrugs.
Steve gives him a disapproving look and Tony smirks. Squirms a little, up and into his lap. “It’s not our job.”
"It was good to see you, Cap," he says, and slides into the Audi. Steve watches him the entire time he drives away.
Tony isn’t
“You mean he just wanted to wait out the kidnappers and pay the ransom,” Tony says, and Steve makes an unhappy noise but nods. “That’s been the way he handles kidnappings since I was six.”
But all he can see is
But Steve stayed, the kind of stubborn irritating persistence that used to make Tony
Steve laughs. “Dirty slut,” he teases and Tony snarls, kitten weak and just as cute as he wriggles on Steve’s cock.
They don't talk about Bucky often--Tony is a jealous little shit and Steve is fiercely protective of his weak spots--but he knows exactly where Steve's thoughts are tugged. “I’m sorry, sweetheart,” he murmurs, and Steve presses into his chest, buries his face there and clings, the way he never does.
Pepper has retreated to her rooms to rest, and Tony is sitting alone, with Dumee asleep at his feet, when Rhodey and Bucky slip through the door and into his suite.
Jarvis, he notices, does nothing to slow or stop them, and there’s something almost approving in the smile he directs at them as Steve ushers Tony past.
But after.
"I did what I had to," Steve said.
It was always covered, quick and slick, with a smile. But it was never real. It was always just a mask.
Twenty years of bad habits are hard to break.
Tony, standing with all the confidant arrogance that Steve hates and loves, and he’s destroying their family.
, since Siberia, since Peggy died and that morning in Steve's hotel room when Tony slipped up.
Tony goes still, eyes wide and searching. They hadn’t--the one night they’d spent together, when fighting gave way to fucking in Clint’s cramped guestroom, it had been dark. He might have missed a tattoo, then--and he hadn’t seen Steve naked even when they were trapped in the past looking for that goddamn stone, but he’d seen
He’s as big as Tony is small, broad shoulders and narrow waist and narrow sharp eyes fixed on Jim like a big cat tracking prey.
He tells them, “There is no need to act.”
The second time he stood in it and he was too tired to be angry. He stood next to Ross, with FRIDAY in his ear and ached from a shield buried in his chest. It had all healed--the shattered sternum and fractured bones in his wrist and cheek and ribs. The bruises had faded and scars took up their new places on his body, and he could smile without feeling it tug white hot pain across his face--
One more chapter. See you next Sunday!
"Was it worth it?" Natasha says. It cuts through the room, cuts through the tension, and levels Tony.
Stane pulls some strings, gets a doctor to come to the Mansion.
Slipping the ring back on Steve's finger, back on his own--Tony breathes out, and it feels like, for the first time in a long time, he isn't suffocating.
Steve takes them to a greasy dinner in Brooklyn, where an old waitress named Delores delivers  messy cheeseburgers, enormous plates of fries, and a thick chocolate shake.
Tony doesn't say anything. He doesn't need--they both know it's true.
He can come like this. Steve made him, once, when he went down to Boston for a long weekend and they’d never bothered to leave the apartment. It took almost an hour, Steve pinning Tony’s wrist and the dirty talk that always got him riled, his hole tightening as he writhed and whimpered and fucked himself as much as he could pinned and impaled.
Sam’s quiet, watching him with patient, wary eyes. “I think it’s time for you to think about changing it then, or moving the hell on, man.”
“Go ahead, honey. Get the lube and open yourself up. I’ll tell you.”
. All of his shiny faith worn away.
He dreams, red misted tinted nightmares of the people he loves, dead and Steve's sad, accusing eyes and wakes screaming.
Studies him for a long moment, and says, softly, "Yeah, I think maybe I should."
Watching Bucky watch the news, Steve has his answer.
“Can I quote that?”
about something.
"You always do," Sam murmurs, slumping suddenly. "And damn the consequences."
He calls Rhodey because Tony was Rhodey’s first, and because he thinks maybe Rogers is going to protect Tony the way he’s always needed, the way Happy wants Tony to be protected.
“What happened?” he asks, a whisper almost lost in the kitchen clatter of the empty diner.
"Hey, sweetheart."
Peggy had frowned, eyes dark with something that Steve didn’t like.
"We're not gonna dodge this, are we?"
He nods, and exhales and never looks away from the photo of Rogers.
, but he gives the other man time, space to grieve, space to be as angry as he needs.
“You did,” Bucky says, soft. It’s not an accusation, but it still lands like one, digging deep.
Tony smiles, and changes the subject.
"Well,  yeah, of course it did. Pepper and Rhodey are his captains, though, and if they couldn't get anything else outta him, what the hell do you think he's gonna tell me? He sure as hell wasn't gonna stop the engagement because I said it smelled hinky."
“Hey,” Steve says, soft, tugging his attention from the spiral and Tony blinks up at him. “You went away,” Steve says, and Tony flushes. He shifts a little, his legs folded under him as Steve sits down next to him and passes him a bowl of chicken chowder. It’s thick, hearty. There’s a heel of bread, oven warm and garlicky, from the bakery down in Queens that Peter knows he likes.
“I want to find him and touch him and know that he’s real.”
He triggers the unibeam and Steve--
Still. Those were problems for another day, after the team had settled, and the sting of the Cassie Protocol had worn away.
"Tony--"
When the Rogues step off the quinjet and back onto American soil, it’s been almost two years.
and the many people who drifted in and out of his bed didn’t matter, in the end.
"We heard rumors," Steve says. "About the king renewing treaties and Lord Stone's new castle."
“Meeting us in the king’s war chamber,” he says and Steve nods.
Clint looks up at him and Steve chews on his lip, turns the question over and then, "He doesn't love Justin. Used to be he couldn't stand him at all. So--"
He just packs up his duffle while Tony is in Tokyo with Pepper and moves back down to his floor, where Sam is living, and when Tony comes home--he doesn't say anything either.
