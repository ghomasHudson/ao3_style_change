“Can I come in?” Dean spoke again, this time he's serious like he wasn't sure if Cas will let him in. Dean Winchester was scared of rejection. Cas hesitated for a second, but eventually, he nodded and made one step back. Dean walked in, and followed Cas to the living room. They seated together on the couch, they could feel the tension in the air.
“Oh, great! You wanna wait for tomorrow when a kid brought a freakin' Armageddon?!”
When three days later, Cas is standing at the bunker's door, he's exhausted, and the only thing he can think about right now is sleep. He could do anything just for a few hours of rest.
“Yeah, I'm looking for baby formula. Which one is the best?”
“Good night, Mary.”
“So, you're demisexual?”
“Really? Is it?” asks Sam.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you too, Cas,” he says, and kisses him back.
“No,” he says fast, and takes a plate to keep his hands busy. Sam nods, the conversation is over, good that they talk at all, but if Dean is going to open himself some day?
“I'm sorry, Cas,” says Sam. He has no idea what more he could do. He is sorry, of course he is. He lost one of his friend… But he needs to think about the child now. For Cas. For Kelly. And for mom.
“Okay, I just ask. Are you bisexual?” he shoots from the hip.
Dean looks at the body again. Why all of this happened to them? He takes a deep breath before he leans in to kiss Cas’ forehead. His skin is cold, and it makes this even harder. He closes his eyes for the moment and clenches fists. He just wants the pain to go away from him.
“Jack is sleeping right now, and I think…” he stops for the moment, not sure how to say it. “Dean, Sam and I were talking about it earlier, and we think we can save Mary.”
Cas finishes changing a diaper, and he takes Jack in his arms again. He almost didn’t let him go earlier, trying to make up for lost time. And Dean doesn’t blame him for that, it’s actually a good thing, Jack needs a father, and maybe Cas needs a Jack. Because then he’ll stay.
Eventually, Dean pulls away, but he’s still holding Cas.
They’re not talking about this what happened in the bar for all week. Actually, they’re not talking too much at all. But one night they’re sitting in the kitchen together, Cas is reading one volume from Men of Letters Library, and Dean takes a subject.
Dean wakes up on the couch in the bunker. He frowns his eyebrows, he expected to see Heaven, not so normal place. Everything looks the same; a table with a map, a telescope, books… Cas is dreaming about the bunker, and Dean feels a sting in his heart. He had kicked Cas out from this place before. From his home.
“Do you trust me?”
“Oh, I know, but it's Valentine's Day!” she explains like it's obvious, and now Dean is the one who frowns. First, Valentine's Day was a month ago, but maybe in romcom it's happening every day? And second, why they got only one piece of this delicious looking pie!? He understands when the waitress gives them two little spoons. “Today, every couple receives free pie! Isn't it wonderful?”
It’s late, but they need to finish the research. Dean rubs his neck, which started aching half an hour ago. They deal with some kind of god, probably the Greek one, but still, they have no clue what it is.
“My apologies, Dean. It was stupid.”
“So, you see me like this? Like a guy who screw up everything and treats you like a trash? That Dean from the dream... He wasn't broken, right? It was a difference?” he gulps, clenching his fist because it started shaking.
“Dean, don't say like that. If it's because of what dad said…”
Deal with the Empty is simple. He needs to save Jack, he’s not thinking about consequences, at that moment. He just does it. Later, at night he’s wondering if he could be ever happy. Probably not. Because the one thing he wants, it’s something he knows he can’t have…
“Can we watch some movie?” asks Cas, and Dean nods.
Dean takes a spoon, and Cas opens his mouth, but in the last moment, Dean turns his wrist, and eats the pie. Cas seems to be confused for a second, but after that  laughs shortly and grins. Dean does the same, he can't stop staring into these blue eyes. And shit, it's kinda hell romantic! He scoops the other portion and spoon-feeds Cas this time.
“Can I ask you something? Why was he like me? Why wasn't he better?” asks Dean very nervously. Why Cas dreamt about so big piece of shit like him.
“Yes, of course I meant it.” Cas slowly looks at Dean, checking his reaction, but he doesn't seem to be angry. It's good, maybe they can fix it. “I'm in love with you.”
“And what? Are you still mad that we stuck here?”
The first time, Dean gave Cas flowers, it was just a joke.
Dean looks at Cas again. The angel is ashamed, and for the first time he sees that Cas is blushing! It's even cute. Normally, in the real world, Dean would react to a similar situation with embarrassment, but here he just shrugs his arms. They can share a pie, why the hell not?
Dean clears his throat and says one more thing.
“I rebuilt your body at the image of your soul, Dean. And I removed old scars and wounds... Did I do something wrong?” Cas bites his lip. He had only one thing to do, and Heaven wouldn't be pleased if he made a mistake fixing Michael's sword.
New chapter, enjoy!
“Of course, Dean,” he answers calmly, avoiding Dean's gaze. “I meant every word.”
Dean spends most of his time drinking and walking around the bunker. Once, he is wondering if he shouldn't go to Cas' room, but he doesn't find enough courage to do this yet. He's not sure how he could react to seeing angel's stuff. Probably there's not many of them, Cas owned only a few things.
“Is it...” starts Cas.
They're not talking about Jody's request even once for a long week. Dean is acting normal like nothing happened, but Cas can't forget about his words. What is that supposed to mean?
“Thank you.”
Dean is nailed. Cas could be jealous but AU!Dean is nailed too, if you know what I mean.
Dean moves forward, not thinking even about the fact he doesn’t have any weapon in his hands. The rage wins with his sanity, he’s going to kill her with his bare hands if he has to.
Cas knocks on the door after ten minutes staring at it. He doesn’t know what he’s going to say, but the confrontation is unavoidable, he wants to get it over with.
“It's your cover, idjit! You're not gonna stay at some crappy motel's room. Not on my watch,” interrupts him Bobby.
And there is also one night when they make love, and after that they’re lying in bed in each other’s arms.
“She kissed me first, don’t you remember? But yes, I kissed her back. I just wanted to try what I learned from the TV.”
And Dean believes him. He thinks that it's the beginning of something more. This dude, angel or whatever, saw him in hell, and he knew then already who Dean really is.
“I'll be delighted.”
“Yeah, I know this one. The dude with wings who flew too high.”
Dean squeezes Cas’ hand gently. One, two, three…
“I don't know, Dean. Are we?” he asks, and Dean doesn't know what to say. “Do you want a coffee?”
Dean turns around and walks to his drawer slowly. He needs some clothes for changing, he takes a pajama pants with burgers and a long-sleeve shirt.
“Thank you.”
“Sorry? For what?” he asks confused, stopping reading.
“You... You taste differently this time... More real,” he whispers, caressing his cheek. He feels that the structure of Dean's skin is softer than usually, but he doesn't realize that it's real Dean until he saw his shocked face. Cas takes a few steps back. “Oh, my apologies, Dean.”
When Cas is clean, Dean walks away from the bathroom again. He's back after Cas takes on pajama pants. The hot dog one. Cas doesn't know why Dean gave him his favorite pants, but he doesn't ask about it. Maybe it was the last clean pair?
Next chapter! Enjoy!
“Black coffee for me,” says Dean.
Dean didn't answer, but he didn't have to because Sam saw valentine's card in his hand. He understood everything, probably before his brother. Cas was in love. With one human.
He feels awful for being so tough, despite everything, Jody is still his friend, but for his own sanity, he needs a break from everything.
Dean comes back a few minutes later with two beers. He gives one bottle to Cas and sits next to him. They're drinking for a while and then Dean clears his throat: “So, I was wondering… Sam and you… Do you keep some secrets from me?”
asked a grumpy voice on the other side. No, this time he hasn’t any trouble. It was something opposite, maybe for the first time in his life.
“I… Yeah, okay.”
Cas looks at Dean who is cleaning a gun, and he swallows nervously. He isn't sure if a hunter will be glad of this. Cas has a male vessel, and he has never seen that some guy kissed Dean before.
he thought. “And, you know, we could control the kid, we don't need another Apocalypse.” Of course, it wasn't because he was worried, but because he didn't trust Jack.
“Oh, Dean, thank you! It's perfect.”
“Yeah, I figured it out...” Dean smiled and after that, he reciprocated: “And I, you, Cas.”
The worst part of this is that Dean really believes that. For years, he was hiding who he was because dealing with that would be harder than pretending he’s straight. Even if this secret was killing him inside.
“You're a weird, dorky, little guy...” chuckles Dean, looking at his adorable huggy bear.
“And what about Cas? He manipulated him. He made him promises. Said ‘Paradise on Earth’ and Cas bought it. And you know what that got him? It got him dead!” shouts Dean. He needs to vent his anger. “Now, you might be able to forget about that, but I can’t!”
“Freddie Mercury!” Dean says enthusiastically when ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ start playing.
“Did I say something wrong?”
“Dean…” whispers Cas fondly, and his eyes are full of tears. Dean feels he’s going to look the same in a second. But before it happens, he says his truth:
“Actually, my father is dead...”
Dean and Sam talk about something, Cas doesn't hear them because he's not a celestial being anymore, but he's sure they're talking about him. Sam nods and walks away, leaving them alone. Maybe it's time when Dean will start yelling at him?
“I'm glad, you come here,” greets him Dean. “You look great.”
on tumblr!
“Sammy, I think it's my private business!” he interrupts him quickly.
“What do you mean?”
Dean can't bear a thought that he lost him again, not like this; in the middle of nowhere, killed by Lucifer. And for what? For protecting an abomination!
“You're awake,” he whispers, but Cas says nothing. He doesn't give the Empty the satisfaction, not anymore.
“I have a friend, a good friend,” he confessed. “He gets all these flowers... And I think, I like him more than I should.”
“I don't care! It's a half of the monster, and I'm not gonna wait to find out that he screws something up!” he yells, and after that they hear the baby’s cry. Jack is awake.
“Dad? What are you doing here?” he asks.
They walk on the floor. Dean puts one of his hand on Cas' waist, and Cas wraps his arm around Dean's neck. They start dancing, and they're not bad at this. Dean could be a good dancer if he wanted.
Dean feels how his heart stops for the moment. What the hell does it mean? What is he talking about? Cas is staring at him, but he won’t elaborate. He said too much already.
“Dean...” gulps Cas, putting a bottle on the map table. “I… You don't have to be worried. I was just talking with Sam about something, but it's nothing important.”
Dean met Cas' eyes, the angel was staring at him with a shy smile, but after Dean caught him doing it, he immediately came back to prepare a bottle. Ten minutes later it was ready, and when he wanted to take Jack back, Dean spoke again.
“Dean, can you… can you stay with me until I'm not going to sleep? I don't want to be alone,” he begs him.
“Good night, Dean,” whispers Cas, and Dean opens his eyes. Cas face is so close to him, he feels his breath on his lips, he could kiss him right there… And he does. Just a simple peck because he couldn’t resist feeling Cas on every part of his face.
He knows he needs to talk with him, but when they arrive to the bunker, Cas runs away straight to his room. Dean understands and leaves him alone. He's drinking a lot that night.
“Could I sit here and listen to you for a while?” he asks.
“Jeez, do you really need to take it everywhere with you?” he asks with a grimace like he saw something awful, not just a baby.
“Dean, you’re allergic to cats…”
“Nothing. Just… What is that?” Cas asks, eyeing on the tattoo and rubbing little circles in the spot where it is. Dean shivers to the touch, Cas’ fingers are soft, warm, and so nice… He doesn’t respond at once, thinking how to explain his drunk tattoo from a few weeks. He didn’t expect that Cas was going back to him, so he didn’t think about consequences then.
Jack starts crying, Sam is surprised that it didn’t happen earlier. He doesn’t say anything more, just walks away to calm a baby down. Great, they’re still in the same place, and he has no idea how long it takes before Dean could look at Jack without disgust.
“You were checking that guy out for a long minute.”
“So speak just for yourself,” Mary encourages him.
It's not only
Dean shrugs his arms and turns the page. Now they’re looking at the perfect garden with a perfect grass and a perfect bench.
“It will be better if I keep it to myself.”
Dean opens his mouth, but doesn't say a word, so he closes it fast. He blinks a few times and shakes his head.
“I’m here Jack, and I will never leave you again,” he whispers to the baby. And Dean hopes that this time it’s true.
Dean frowns his eyebrows. He doesn't like this conversation, what is Sam trying to imply?
“Umm… A baby formula is almost gone, so if it isn’t a problem…” Sam tries to say slow and calmly, he’s not sure how actually Dean is going to handle mention Jack. The fact that he looked after him this morning doesn’t mean he likes the kid now.
Eileen... Who the hell is Eileen, the real love of Sam Winchester, a badass hunter and awesome character?
Cas rolls his eyeballs, still grabbing Dean. And then he just sinks into a next kiss.
“I miss her, but it's… It was her choice. She saved us, she attacked Lucifer and went with him through the portal before it closed.”
Cas has to have nightmares. Dean doesn't bother to knock, he just opens the door and walks into the room. Cas is tossing in bed, still asleep. Dean comes closer, sit next to him and grabs his arm gently.
“I love you too, Dean,” says Cas when they pull away. They're staring at their eyes and smiling. Dean thinks it's a bigger smile than in Djinn's world.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean gives him an opened bottle of water. He takes a swig, and it burns his throat, the fresh wound on his neck is in the bad condition, he doesn't heal so fast anymore.
They pull away, resting their foreheads on each other.
“You really want me there? Are you sure?” he asked, and Cas nodded.
“What?” he asks, and that's the moment when Dean's lips crushes his. He's surprised first, but he melts into the kiss. It's an incredible feeling, he can't compare this to anything else. But he knows already, it's something he will want to do again.
“Oh, buddy… Umm…” mumbles Dean and this time doesn’t hug him back. Cas doesn’t count to three, he pulls away immediately, feeling something is wrong. He tilts his head and frowns, looking at Dean and waiting for an explanation. But Dean doesn’t say anything.
“Nothing. Just… it’s like in the movies. We should start making out till now.” After the last word escaped his mouth, he realized what he said. His face turned red immediately, and he was trying to avoid Cas’ gaze. “I mean, not ‘we’. Just… It’s not the movie, right?”
, who was an asshole, but also other angels like
He pointed at two suitcases, and a lot of baby's stuff like cradle or diapers.
Cas spends most nights alone in the kitchen - his safe place. Sometimes he’s doing research, but on the quiet moments when they don’t fight with any cosmic entity, he likes watching perfect pictures of perfect lives. He likes watching a happiness…
“How old is he?” Oh, yeah, dude doesn't know how long he was gone.
“Thank you,” murmurs Dean again, and Cas still doesn't understand why.
Dean takes the first beer, it's surprising that he starts so late that evening. He sits at the map table and opens a bottle. Before he relaxes, he hears Jack's cry from Sam's room. He doesn't react first, but after two long minutes, he gasps annoyed, puts beer away and goes to the noise source.
“What? Why?” Dean frowns, he's still shocked, and he hasn't idea how to react.
“Hi, Cas!” Dean grinned like nothing bad ever happened between them. It looks so similar to the smile he gave him when he worked at Gas 'n Sip as Steve. A smile full of sadness and guilt.
“Can I have a forehead kiss too?” Dean jokes, after they’re alone in the kitchen. Cas squints his eyes a little confused, but eventually, nods enthusiastically and makes two steps closer.
“Thank you, Dean. For everything,” he whispers.
“And you'll go there, to all these places, with me?”
“I-I... Cas, do you remember our last case?” he asks. He doesn't want to hit him too hard, baby steps will be better.
Inspired by
“Good night, Cas,” he mumbles, and Cas smiles because it already was the best night of his life.
Cas raises his eyes at him, and the corners of his mouth go up. He looks so adorable this way.
“I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.”
He has penis. Real penis! And it looks so good, like in his dreams or maybe even better… Actually, Dean is not sure if he's not dreaming again. Maybe it some other form of torture created by Alastair? He gives him what he desires, only because he's going to take it back
“I… It would be kinda gay…” he whispered, but a second later his lips crushed Cas’. Cas responded fast, he pushed Dean on the elevator’s wall and put his hands on Dean’s thighs to lift him.
“Yeah… I'm proud of you, Sammy,” he says, and walks away.
“Umm, can we talk?”
There’s a picture of the porch in a wooden house near to the lake. He sees two wicker chairs, it looks domestic and… nice.
“If you will… What are you gonna do? Some date?” It’s strange that Sam needs free evening, they spend all the time in the bunker since Jack appeared, they go only to the shop, and Sam took Jack a few times on the walk, just for a couple of minutes… And of course, he started running again, Dean can’t understand why.
They're kissing again. This time more passionaetly. And Dean is surprised that kissing his best friend is so easy like the most normal thing on the world.
You can find me on
Dean comes back with a burrito, but Cas takes just two bites. Even if he's hungry, his throat doesn't let him eat.
Cas nods, and murmurs quietly 'thank you', before he starts eating.
In Purgatory, he has only one thought: to keep Dean safe. He’s running, ignoring prayers, but hearing every word so loudly. Sometimes he wants to turn the angel radio off, but he doesn’t do this, he needs to know if Dean is okay… And to be honest, these prayers make that he doesn’t give up.
He wasn’t sure if angels could feel like this, but there he is, a final proof. Dean knew for a long time that he liked Cas more than just a friend, but he has never thought these feelings were reciprocated. Dean cleared his throat, he wasn’t sure what he should to do.
“Welcome home, Cas,” whispers Dean. Cas arms wrap around his back. They're standing in the middle of nowhere, but they're together again. And only it matters.
“Of course, Dean.”
“I dunno. He looks like a normal kiddo, but you said that something woke you up. I thought, maybe it's because of him. You said he's a powerful child,” Dean explains.  “I can show you some picture of him.” Dean pulls a phone from his pocket again, and gives it to Cas, who checks the gallery. There's a lot of photos of a little baby.
“Yeah, whatever…”
“It's okay, Cas, I get this. It was selfish, and you're right. Jack should stay here, grow up, be happy. He has a chance for this here. You're amazing father, I believe you can handle this. You were doing a great job for now.”
“Don't thank me. I didn't bring oranges,” says Bobby, Dean laughs and relaxes a little bit. “And actually, I think I will need your help with rugaru. I called to John that you'll stay at my place a few weeks.”
“Come on, man, you can't avoid me all the time...” Dean gasps and comes closer. He sits on the other chair against Cas who is looking at his feet, right now. “I need to understand some things… Did you know it's just a dream? I mean, I knew about that when I was attacked by Djinn once.”
“Yeah, just like Freddie.”
“No, I won’t. Mom chose to take that shot at Lucifer. That’s not on Jack. He’s just an innocent baby. And you need to see this, Dean! Nothing of this is Jack’s fault.”
“It's not… I don't know what I want. I don't understand what it's mean. And I'm straight, of course,” explains Dean. His last words are a bullshit, he doesn't believe in it.
“Are you okay?” asks Sam, and both of them nod.
This ficlet is also
“But you faced the consequences of your acts. You know, I was a warrior once. A soldier, who followed orders without any hesitation. I didn't make my own decisions, and I didn't think about consequences. But when I saved Dean from hell...”
“Thank you.”
“Dean, could you do me a favor?” he asks once. It’s late, almost midnight, and they’re sitting in the kitchen, drinking beers. Dean can’t sleep again, it happens more often these days.
on tumblr!
Everything is okay.
“Are you freaking idiot?” yells woman at Cas, but after a second she reminds herself, that he's an agent, investigating the recent disappearances, so she adds quickly: “Sir!”
Dean relaxes again, and this time he believes everything will be okay.
In the kitchen, Cas was waiting for him with a pie and a cup of steaming coffee.
A FEW DAYS LATER:
“Okay, I think you need to talk. I'm just waiting for you in our room,” says Aphrodite and winks at Charlie.
“It’s my name,” he speaks calmly, still staring at Dean’s hip bone, still touching the skin with the same fondness.
“You're not real...” he mumbles it more to himself, he can't forget that Dean didn't save him, and all of this is just an illusion.
Jack is gone!
Cas drops the bag with the pie on the floor. Dean pulls back, breathing heavily. His heart is pounding, but at least he's sure about his feelings now.
“Fine. I stop talking.” Cas rolled his eyes and gasped again. Why was he like that? Dean didn’t do anything wrong, it’s not his fault this building was hundred years old or something like that.Both of them were mad at each other. Peachy! They will spend the next few hours in silence for no reason. No, there was a reason.
Actually, the biggest problem for him is the fact that he is in love with Dean secretly. And he feels that invading his personal space would be inappropriate and unfair. Of course, he would be delightful if he put his lips on Dean's cheek. He wishes he could do this, but he knows that Dean doesn't reciprocate it.
Dean frowned, but before he opened his mouth to ask about this, Cas give him an envelope. He opened it, and saw the weirdest valentine’s card he has ever seen. He chuckles, not understanding anything for this.
“Yeah, but I'm not gonna move this every night into my room when we'll be switching. We’ll should take turns. ”
Dean loses his tongue, he’s staring at this, forgetting about a wound for a moment. After a few seconds which seem to last forever, he shakes his head and clears his throat
Dean grins, but after that he clears his throat and ends a subject: “Yeah, maybe one day, but now I need my four hours.”
“No. Me,” starts Dean, and when Cas, eventually, gives him a confused look, he rolls his eyes. “Of course, that Jack did it.”
Dean is drowning. Not literally, but he feels like he's underwater. Another night, but the same dream. Lucifer. Cas. Angel blade. And shadow of the wings.
“Dean. Coffee?”
“What are you talking about?”
New chapter! Enjoy :)
“I’ll give you some clean shirt,” he says, and gets up. He pulls his old band shirt out from his bag, and helps Cas dress it. After that, he sits on the corner of the bed and sighs loudly.
They're staring at each other a little longer, before Dean clears his throat. “Cas?”
Cas flies before John reacts, he can only hear fluttering of the wings.
Cas is back. Jack brought him from the Empty, of course, he did! There’s a lot of hug from Sam, Eileen, and also from Dean. The last one is a little awkward, Cas is trying to avoid Dean’s gaze.
“Bee?”
“Stop it! Stop thanking me for things which are owned you!” he yells a little too loud. “I'm sorry… Cas, listen, I have to ask you about something else. When I was captured by Djinn the other day, I saw a perfect world. Almost. Because Sam... we didn't talk too much, you know. Djinn can't make a perfect world, something always is wrong.”
“If you want… But better choose something small and symbolic. We have time, so we can go to the other shops.”
They come back to watch a movie, but Dean's eyes are catching Cas' face all the time. The grin doesn't go away until the credits.
You can find it
Sam’s running, but he should to come back for ten minutes. It’s also a time when Dean wakes up usually, and that’s why Cas makes coffee for them. Dean walks into the kitchen when a steaming coffee is waiting for him. He takes a cup from Cas.
!' thinks Dean. Unfortunately, not literally. Jack makes some glorious speech, and Dean could ask about Cas at least twenty times, but he prefers staying there like an assbutt.
Cas has a point. Dean knows only about two people (or rather demon and reaper) with whom he was kissing.
After all of them greeted him, Dean excuses Sam and Eileen, grabs Cas arm gently and pulls him a little.
And there was a day, when he walked to the library, forgetting everything again (probably because he was staring at Dean for too long).
“Hello, Dean!” greets him Cas cheerfully. “Hello, Sam.”
The answer comes straight from the sky because it's raining when they're outside. And the rain is a perfect weather for lovers…
“So, he's the calmest when I have him close to my left shoulder,” he explains casually, but he feels how his face turns warm. He shouldn't react like this, it's no big deal.
“Thanks, Cas. It was just a lot of information. So, who…” Sam wants to ask again, but he just eyes on Cas, and he knows already. He says calmly: “It's Dean, right? You share a more profound bond.”
“Yeah, sure, why not?” he mumbles. Maybe coffee is good for the start.
“I don't...” he begins and gasps irritated. “Why do you make it so hard?”
Dean found his favorite old jeans this morning, and he thought it was a good idea to check if they still fit.
Dean lost his home when he was four. Since then, he was trying to find some replacement. Any motel room wasn't enough, Bobby's house was burnt, but finally, he found a bunker.
“Finding a human vessel durable enough to contain me... It's not easy,” explains Cas.
“Because he's a dude who knows shit about anything from pop culture?” he answers his question with another question.
“Maybe I am,” says Dean suddenly.
“I...” he started, not sure how to say this. “Me too, Cas. Me too.”
Cas is dead, and he won't see him again ever.
But it's not. Nothing is okay. But you just need to keep going, tell you’re fine, right? Dean was always good at pretending, or maybe he just likes to think like this about himself.
“It’s… I…” He’s tongue-tied, but it’s okay because Cas doesn’t need an answer to that question. He knows what it is, and it’s not the point.
After their stomaches are full, they're going to the small roller coaster, which maybe isn't the best idea, but Dean hopes none of them is going to vomit. They take seats close to each other. Dean feels Cas scent, this time it's a little different from usual, more sweet. Dammit, it shouldn't be like this. Cas shouldn't smell so nice, and Dean definitely shouldn't smell him. It's not a freakin' flower! Not that Dean would smell a flower either.
“No, no, no, Dean! I’m an angel, I can heal myself…” shouts Cas, taking a one step back, he almost falls on the floor. Fortunately, Dean is grabbing him tightly.
“Hi, buddy, do you need something?” asked Dean, but Cas didn't say anything. He just tilted his head, trying to remind himself why he was there, actually.
Dean bites his lip, wondering if it’s a good idea.
“I like this conclusion.”
“Bobby?”
“Cas, wait.” Dean grabs his wrist gently, he doesn’t want to let him go.
“For what?”
Cas isn’t sure when he falls asleep, but when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he can feel Dean’s arm around his waist. It’s nice and warm, and it makes, he’s falling asleep again.
“Weak.” He can't say anything more. His eyes are closing themselves. He's so tired, and he needs to sleep. Could Dean interrogate him tomorrow? Could he go sleep now?
“Okay, I see, but… Why are you doing this?”
“Okay, little buddy,” he says, taking a baby from the cot for the first time. He holds his breath for the moment like he expects that something wrong to happen. But everything is right. He feels a warm little body against his own, and it is so properly. He can feel a life.
“Sam and Eileen will come tomorrow. We don't have any case right now, so I thought we could watch some movie tonight,” says the first voice, identical to Dean's one. It must be some fake version of him.
“I missed you...” murmured Dean when they pull away. His hand found Cas waist, and he didn't want to let him go.
“Uriel?” Dean turns his head to Sam reluctantly. “What do you mean?”
“You were always saying such things to me. Even, when I didn’t deserve that…”
“Oh, he asked me about Valentine’s Day, so I explained that this is a day for people who are in love with each other...” said Sam. He was surprised because his brother was really worried like something bad happened.
“Like I said, it was perfect. It's gonna suit to my collection,” he explained. “And, Dean, I won't forget about you either. Never.”
“I'm sorry, Dean,” says Cas when Sam is taking a shower, and they are alone in the room.
Dean has lots of things in his room: family pictures, guns, a lamp and more others. One of them is an old typewriter which has always been there, so he just left it himself. For the beginning he doesn’t use it, treating it as a piece of decor, but one day, maybe he drank too much beer, he sits at the table and starts typing. It’s just random words like some swears, his favorite things (pie!) or names (Dean, Sam, Mary, Cas…).
“Good choice!” chuckles fake-Dean. It's so weird hearing own voice.
on tumblr!
It’s too late, Dean can see everything clearly. The wound isn’t so bad, but his eyes catch something else. On Cas’ hip is a tiny tattoo. A name. Dean’s name. And a little heart next to this.
“You are someone special!” ensured Cas.
“How do you feel?” he asks in concern.
“I won't hurt him, Cas.”
Dean jumps up nervously and shouts: “What? Why didn’t you tell me earlier, it can kill you, we need to…”
He takes salt, weapon and flashlight from the Impala’s trunk, before he goes inside. Everything smells dust and dirt, but he worked in worse conditions more than once. The corridor is dark and silent, he walks to the right wing where is situated nurse room. He starts searching, there are lots of old papers, patient records and other thrash, but he's looking for something personally. He found out earlier that the nurse had her favorite necklace which she was wearing all the time, it could be this, but Dean doubts in it. She was probably burnt with it.
He starts feeling. For the first time. It disturbs him, it makes he has doubts and questions. It shouldn’t be like this. He’s a soldier, a warrior of God’s Army. He can’t just break the rules. But he does it. For Dean. And every time, it’s easier.
Dean feels confused, but Cas explains everything at once. He whispers: “It was from Jody. She asked me to do this…”
He turns around again, thinking about asking her for a number, but he changes his mind. He looks like a shit right now, and actually, he doesn’t even want any hook-up. That girl probably wasn’t interested at all, she just does her job. Dean shakes his head: “No, thanks, that’s all.”
“I mean to someone, who you love,” he explained. This got even more awkward, why Cas couldn’t just read a little about some humans’ tradition?
“It’s good, right? That you liked her.”
Dean has a silly smile on his face, and he's looking at Cas through half-closed eyes. The angel, because he's a powerful angel again, is lying on him on the couch with his stupid, sexy trench coat, and he's kissing Dean's neck which is really pleasant.
“So, stop acting like that!”
“I have to go!” he shouts and walks away as fast as he can.
“Oh, I think he's not, but… You should talk with him,” says Sam, and Cas just nods. A talk sounds good, but he isn't sure if Dean wants to talk at all.
“It's okay. Just forgive me.”
“No big deal. You saved our asses more than once. I'm just returning the favor.”
Dean stopped touching him. That was it, the end of the moment of true happiness. Now only cold left.
“It's hard to say. It's lots of mixed feelings, sometimes extreme… You feel good with that person, you know, happy, and you want everything best for her… or him,” he explains clumsily.
“Yes, we could…” he whispers, looking at Dean with his whole love and adoration.
“Yeah... Why are you asking about that?”
“I told you.”
“I was the one who left. It was my decision,” said Cas to end this subject. Dean nodded, agreeing with him, but repeated his apologies one more time anyway.
“Hey, Dean!” He clears his throat. “Your angel,
“No, I mean the thing you said earlier. Did you mean it?”
“Shh, it's okay. I'm here, you're safe.” he says, stroking his hair with one hand and rubbing circles on his back with the other one. And Cas believes him. He feels safe and loved and…
“So, what’s your type?”
Just a simple word which means everything in their universe. Finally, Cas can allow himself to be happy, and nothing bad is gonna happen to them. They don't need to pay for this, never again.
Dean?” Cas gulps.
“No. It's not going to happen. I won't leave my coat here.” Cas could do a lot to escape this place, but coat must stay with him.
Dean has no idea when it actually happened, but it's routine now. Every morning he wakes up at six o'clock, dresses up and walks to the kitchen to make some baby formula. He takes a bottle, powder milk and kettle, he checks a temperature of food with this silly gadget which Sam bought a few weeks ago. After that he's tiptoeing to Sam's room, he stopped closing the door, knowing that Dean is going to appear here. Jack always opens his eyes immediately when he put his foot on the floor. Dean takes him from the cradle and changes his diaper.  They go to the kitchen together, where he's feeding him. Because of this, Sam can sleep more, and he stopped looking like a zombie.
Dean doesn't know what he's thinking about it. Why is Cas dreaming about kissing him? And how is it possible that it makes him happy? Dean freaking Winchester is a doomsday machine which destroys everything and everyone. He is broken, and he doesn't deserve for anything and now, he just found out that a perfect celestial being loves him.
“What? I didn't lie to him.”
“I need to show you something,” says Dean and pulls up his shirt. He points on his hip, with a little black wing on it. “I did it after you were gone. After Lucifer killed you.”
Dean runs to the playground, and Mary bites her lip bottom.
“Ugh, gross… Don't ever say it again!”
“Cas?”
That’s why he’s surprised when he hears Sam’s voice one day.
Dean goes to the kitchen to talk with him. Cas is making a coffee, he takes a cup from the cabinet, and then he turns around, feeling somebody's eye on him. He sees Dean, so he smiles immediately.
“Cas is really enjoying with babysitting. We should call him… Dadstiel,” says Dean to his brother and raises his eyebrows. On Sam's face appears some grimace.
At the end, he uses body mist which he bought last time in the perfumery. It smells like fresh sweet melon with a touch of violets.
“For the kiss,” he says like it's obvious.
“Forgive you? For what?”
Dean turned around as much as he could, nudging Cas shoulder, and gave him an irritated look.
“Yes, you know… him,” murmurs Cas.
“You can fuck me if you want, you know that, right?” Dean blurts out. And when he finishes the sentence, he realizes what he said actually.
“Dean, I don’t wanna hear any more of your stupid notes,” says Sam, not even looking at his brother. He’s focused only on the baby.
Jack spends with him a few hours per day. Sometimes they're flying away, Cas with his fixed wings (benefits of being God's dad). Sam gives him a lot of interesting books, Eileen watches with him romcoms, and Dean does the rest. He cooks Cas his favorite food, Cas doesn't feel molecules anymore because Jack rebuilt his sense of taste (another benefit of being God's dad); he
“I… I love you, Dean. Do I commit some sin?” he asks. The Angel of the Lord,
“Dean,” he starts, but Dean just shakes his head. They’re sitting in silence, and for both of them it means something different. Cas feels calm despite all this tension in the air. And Dean is just a nervous wreck.
“Yes, I'm sure. Come on!”
“So, you never felt attraction to somebody. Because you were never in love, right?” he says it slowly.
“Not again, Dean. It was over fifteen years ago. You can't bring Stanford up every time when you're mad at me.”
“And it’s not pleasant for you?” he guesses.
Cas walks to the library, but he still hears Dean’s voice in his head:
“Jerk.”
Sam smiles. It’s a good first step, maybe everything will be normal one day… Yeah, maybe.
The angels are falling.
“Come back home. The bunker is a safer place,” Dean repeated. So, it was the real reason. Dean wanted… needed Cas back.
post!
“Stop being stubborn. You need stitches, and I can handle it!” Dean pulls a first aid kit and a bottle of whiskey from his bag. “Lie down.”
“No, dumbass. It’s just a song…”
It's just a casual morning, John is at the work, and Mary takes care of the children. Everything seems to be perfect because Winchester’s family is, indeed,
“I'm afraid I don't understand,” says the confused angel, tilting his head a little and frowning. He looks like he really doesn't get it. Like he really hasn't idea what he did.
“Really?” he asks, watching two kissing dudes. “Whatever, a beer taste the same in every bar.”
“Yeah, it’s… It’s your name.”
“Yes. I'd love to.” Fucking lucky them!
He needs to say something quickly.
“Does he know?”
“No,” he said quickly. “I mean, I don't need a babysitter, Dean. I'm fine, thank you for your concern.”
It is worse than he thought.
“No,” he chuckles and kisses the crook of his neck. “I want yours. Because you’re mine, and I’m yours. Forever.”
Since he became human, everything pisses him off. He still didn't get used to the 'beauty' of daily life.
“Hello, Dean,” mumbles Cas, and his face expresses a concern and worry, like he isn't sure if he's welcomed here.
Sam wraps her body up in the sheet, and starts packing the baby’s stuff in the Impala's trunk. He takes some clothes, formula and diapers. Then he comes back to Jack, who is sleeping again. He watches over him, waiting as Dean will be ready.
“I'll pour you some water.” Dean comes to the counter and takes a glass.
“But you're still here.”
“Jack has a cradle in my room,” he points, and Dean murmurs something, and then speaks louder.
“So, you wanna talk about this or what? Some advice? Talk with Cas if you want something more,” Sam gasps. Why is he giving some shitty directions to his older brother who has never had problems with dating?
, Cas didn’t like it, he shouldn’t have sung.
“Okay, but I need to draw uncle Sam and auntie Eileen yet.”
“Dean, you cared about me. You made who am I. And I think, I grew up to be a good man.”
Dean’s arms are strong, he wraps them around Cas’ middle back, and it feels nice. Comfortable and warm… Safe.
Cas is watching the sky with a terror on his face. His eyes fill with tears. He's crying for the first time in his life. And it's so human thing.
“Did something happened when I was gone?” asks Cas.
Dean looked up from the book he was reading and smiled. Cas was here for a book, of course, but which one? He had no idea. That's why he decided to tease with him a little.
“I am. We are, Cas. We are real.” Cas shakes his head.
Cas chooses a photo of sleeping Jack with his plushie bee, and also the one where Dean's holding him, sitting at the armchair. He sends it to himself, and turns to Dean his phone.
There’s 'Kocham Cię’ when they’re cooking a dinner.
One day, Cas is walking around the bunker when he hears some music. He recognizes the sound of the guitar, it comes from Dean’s room.
“I love him... I'm in love with him.”
“Whoa, easy tiger! Do you wanna give me a hickey?” asks Dean.
Dean pulls a gun out and fires a quick shot. The ghost vanishes into thin air.
He can hear Cas' steps, and a few seconds later the door is open. Cas has messy hair, more than usually, was he lying in bed for the last couple of hours?
“And what about me? You don’t care about me either?” asks Sam calmly, and Dean regrets his last words immediately. He swallows hard, clenching his fist. Of course, he cares about Sam, he’s his little brother, he protects him since he was four… But he’s just so tired, that for the first time he’s not sure if it will be enough. Enough to live.
“You know, Dean, I read seventy-four books about babies, but still, it wasn't enough. I'm sure you can teach me how to be a good father,” points Cas, and Dean’s cheeks turns pink. Sam said the same shit earlier, but it isn’t all truth. And Cas wasn’t here when Dean was the worst, he wouldn’t say things like that if he knew…
Did he say it loud? Dean wakes up and raises his head to look at him. He gets up, just to make a few steps and sits on the edge of the bed.
“Yeah, sure. I forgot about that...”
“What? What are you talking about? You're a family, Cas. You're always welcome here. And I need you, man,” says Dean.
“It's, you know...” he begins, and not finish a thought again. Cas frowns, but a moment later he realizes what he means.
“Cas, is that really you?” asks Dean stupidly if it's not Cas, of course, he won't tell the truth. “How?”
Dean hugs with his parents and brother, and then John notices a hickey on his neck: “What is that, son?”
“Hey, it's okay. The best gift is your presence here. Shall we?” he asks, offering his arm. Cas gives him a little smile before touches his elbow.
“What conclusions?”
, thinks Dean.
“I have family already,” points Dean. “I have Sam and Mom. And Jack, he’s like a son to me, you know?”
He doesn't shave more precisely, and for sure he doesn't use the best cologne he has.
“I'm not a little. My true size is the size of Chrysler Building, did you forget?’ says Cas seriously.
The waitress comes with coffees and a one slice of apple pie.
“Sure. Good night, Dean,” he says and gives him a little smile.
They start small-talk, Dean tells he has his own car service to sound legit. Fake Cas says that he works in the school for the bees. Dean has no idea if some kind of that shit even exist in real world, but it sounds so typical for
When the nurse comes to take him to the surgery, Dean isn't scared, he's feeling peace. He was afraid that his father won't be at the hospital to support him. But the truth is that his real dad is here already.
“Thank you, Dean.” He took a few steps forward. “I need to feed him, now. Can we talk later? Give me, let me say, fifteen minutes?”
“But I am.”
“Oh, no, it's for you, actually,” he teased, giving him flowers. Cas hesitated for a moment, but he took the daisies eventually, watching them curiously. Dean wanted to explain it was just a joke, but before he even can open his mouth, Cas smiled shyly (Dean had no idea Cas could smile this way, it was adorable somehow) and smelled flowers.
Dean closes his book and says: “Okay, we need a break. Do you wanna some beer?”
, Dean thinks he’s going to cry too. He could look at two of them forever.
He fell. Once. Not in love. Just fell.
“Oh, that's really nice Cas, but... Huh, but you know, we're giving valentine's card for someone special,” he said, scratching the back of his neck.
“How?” asks Cas surprised.
“You’re the best,” he murmurs, looking into his mug. “Black like my soul.“
Cas asked Dean to hug him.
Dean gulps. The stranger knows his real name, even when in the documents he was still Deanna. And this is a moment when he understands that the creature, whatever it is, is not gonna hurt him. Maybe it is some douchebag or a monster, of course, Dean still doesn't trust him, but something in his heart whispers that he's safe now. Everything will be okay.
Cas opens a box, there's a little bee pin.
“What?” Dean looks at him, confused. What is he talking about?
Cas knocks at the door, and music stops immediately.
“Yes, they're absolutely fine, but I have to go to the library.” Cas turns around and goes away. Dean shrugs his arms and comes back to cleaning a gun.
“And what about me? Which one am I?”
“You look tired,” points Cas. “ You should go get some sleep.”
“He’s so small and… innocent. I…” begins Cas, but he has a lump in his throat.
“I'm sorry too. But maybe it's gonna be the best for us. Starting new lives apart.”
Charlie waits till Aphrodite is gone. After her girlfriend is safe from Dean's rage, she starts to explain everything.
“My apologies, Dean...”
“Yeah, you said it before. You don't have to apologize… Cas, I...”
. Cas shakes his head slightly.
“Sure, buddy.”
Dean went to sleep, so Cas had all night to think. Think about them. About Jack. And about the future. And the future, which he saw when Jack showed it to him a few months ago, told him what he should to do. Cas made his decision.
It has been four days since Dean appeared on the porch of the lake house. It was a wonderful time, but Cas started feeling anxious. How long was Dean going to stay? When will he leave him again? When will he crash his heart into a million pieces? He didn't want to get through this one more time, he needed to know what Dean was planning.
Dean freezes for the moment. He isn't sure if he has ever heard something like that. Of course, a few people said to him that they loved him, but Cas is different. It's so pure and unconditionally.
Dean wraps one arm around him tight, and the other hand ruffles Cas’ hair, just to tease with him a little. And Cas isn’t pissed off, otherwise he laughs. Dean never hears that kind of sound from the angel. It’s surprising, but he admits he likes it. And he wants to hear it again.
“Sure.”
“Okay, so I'll try again. Do you want to see me, now?”
Maybe, he'll tell him tomorrow? Yeah, maybe tomorrow…
“I know. He'll reject me, and he'll start to avoiding me. His friendship is enough for me,” says Cas, but even he doesn't believe in own words. It's not enough, but he can't have more. Never.
“I can't.” Cas took Jack and started feeding him, not looking at Dean.
Dean isn't satisfied with the answer, so he continues the subject: “But it's Cas...”
. Prompt: "could you maybe write something about dean coming out as bi to sam in the impala and also talking about his feelings for cas?"
Dean isn't sure if it's not too childish, but he just holds Cas' hand in his. The angel squeezes it, and they both goes to the Dean Cave. Together. As a couple. A couple of trusting.
“Umm, hello, Dean.”
“Why would he do that?” asks Cas, confused, tilting his head to the right and frowning. Dean chuckles and rolls his eyes.
He takes Jack on his arms and puts him in the baby bathtub, where he prepared water earlier. Jack babbles something when his body touches water.
“Oh, I forgot about it.”
Dean doesn't run away every time he sees the kid in Sam's arm. Instead, he takes Jack sometimes from his brother unknowingly, just to hold him for a moment. Days pass very quickly, and Dean makes another steps. He starts feeding Jack also in the lunchtime, he's changing a diaper more often, and sometimes he just walks around the bunker with a kid on his arms. Jack is mostly calmly, and Dean realizes that he starts to care about him. That thought terrifies him, but it's too late to change it. Now, he needs to protect him no matter what.
“Okay. Umm… I like green eyes,” he says, it should be enough, and Dean won’t get any suspicious.
Dean, dumbass.”
He doesn’t know why he said it. Maybe he is too excited because he has a new dick, but… Did it sound like some flirtation?
“Could you… If it’s not uncomfortable to you, could you hug me?”
“Good night, Sam,” says Cas, looking at him.
“You said ‘anytime’, and I need a hug now,” explains Cas, and Dean chuckles after that. Sweet, innocent Cas…
Dean blushes and chuckles nervously, scratching the back of his neck: “Huh, it’s no big deal.”
“What's the point?”
But maybe...
“Of course, Cas.”
Cas grabbed Dean's hand and brushed it with his lips. He understood him without any words.
“I think you can be right. Jack is a nephil, he can see a true form of demons and angels, and Cas left his mark, Jack need to see this.”
“No, it's change a lot. Everything, actually,” says Dean.
She’s not prepared for this, so she changes subject. Again: “Why don’t you go play with the other kids?”
“It's nothing to worry about, Cas,” says Dean, shrugging.
“Why?” he asks, and raises his head to look at Cas for the first time, he found out about his secret. He’s very pale and terrified, like he just was caught on some dirty deed.
Dean and Castiel waking up together in the same bed for the first time.
Cas takes a sip of his coffee to keep his hands busy. Dean takes a spoon to scoop some pie.
“Maybe she doesn't like him... Probably he said something stupid,” says Sam, shrugging his arms.
In heaven, they don’t have to cook or bake because they can just think about something, and it appears.
“So, if you invented love, you can choose a name!”
Dean likes sitting with Cas and drinking beer, when the angel tells him stories about all that places he visited. He's always talking with passion and sparkles in his eyes. Dean could listen to him forever.
“Screw you!”
Dean comes to Cas and touches his arm, looking for his eyes. Ex-angel looks away, Dean's touch is so painful for him that he stands fast and goes to the car without any word.
“I dunno, man, but it seems legit to me.”
“Yeah! You thought I'm gonna let you go here alone?!” shouts the old man, sitting at the chair next to his bed. Dean feels relief, it’s going to be easier now.
“I know. I know, Cas.” He nods. It was obvious Cas wouldn't like to kiss him. “I just thought you'd like to experience it too... But you're right, we're friends, you should find someone special.”
Cas’ expressions is changing all the time. First, he’s smiling, but later he’s frowning and tilting his head. Dean is too focused on guitar to notice this.
, thinks Dean. His mother always told him that angels are watching over him, but it’s unbelievable that she was right.
“I have something for you. A little gift.”
“Yeah, I know, dumbass. But it wasn't Donna,” gulps Dean nervously. Cas wraps his arms around Dean's neck and kisses him back.
Cas is fucking with AU!Dean because he's too dumb to find a difference.
“What are you drawing, kiddo?” asks Dean, looking at Jack. He sits at the table for half an hour, he seems to be focused, and the tip of his tongue is touching the corner of his mouth.
“Oh, I think you're right! It was definitely what I wanted to do.” Cas smiled at him and opened a drawer to take a knife, but Dean stopped him.
Castiel feels lost because he doesn't see a problem in his weird and inappropriate questions. He apologizes her anyway, and she starts to calm down, so Sam and Dean, who staying by the car, don't intervene.
Dean doesn't want to let Cas go, but he knows he has to. He feels so good, and he thinks this moment could long forever. He pulls away slowly, and cups Cas' face gently, staring in his eyes as he's just checking if Cas won't disappear within a minute after he stops touching him.
“Umm, I... It's for me, I just like flowers.”
Cas closed his eyes with trust. Dean laid hands on the angel's face. He felt soft skin structure under his fingers. He touched Cas few times before, but it was different right now.
“Don't be. I'm here, and I don't let you go. Not anymore,” he whispers his promises, and he kisses him again.
“He's... not here. He's in the bunker. I came alone. Is it... Would you prefer Sam instead of me? To checking on you,” he finished awkwardly. Dean looked very tense, he clenched his fist, and scratched his neck with the other hand.
Dean gives him fake laugh: “Telling about Jack? Are you kidding me? I can hardly look at the kid, I’m definitely not going to waste my time on talking about him.”
Mary accepted Castiel at once when he found out that he and her son love each other. She was happy for them. She had suspected this earlier, to be honest since she met Cas on Earth and saw how he reacted on Dean in the bunker.
“Dean, you don't have to…”
Dean doesn't push him. “Like you wish.”
“I didn’t know you can recognize any vegetables.”
“Just because.”
Being a human could be annoying. Cas understood it when he didn't go to the restroom at a gas station, and he begged Dean to stop Impala ten minutes later (unfortunately, he had to urinate into the bushes). Or when he didn't eat breakfast and his stomach grumbled. Dean thought it was hilarious, but it definitely wasn't funny for Cas (he didn't enjoy hunger at all). There were more small things he couldn't get used to, and one of them was imperfect memory.
But again, he's wrong. Dean decides what to do next, he reaches his hand to Cas' chin and brushes his beard with a thumb.
“Of co...” He stops himself from finishing the sentence.
Dean looked at him, tired and devastated.
It has been two weeks since Cas is gone. Two weeks! But to Dean it feels like ages. Ages full of pain, sadness and self-destructive thoughts.
“Yeah, sure. That was… That was what I thought…” Dean clears his throat and feels how Cas loosens his grip and makes two steps back.
“Dean, I need your help. I forgot what for I'm here.”
“Weenie? Weenie-weenie... Sammy has weenie! But mommy, why he has weenie?”
“Because you're a girl, sweetheart.”
“So, you're not...”
“What?”
Dean takes off Jack's diaper, and before he has time to react, baby starts peeing on him. His flannel is wet a second later. Great! Jack seems not to care what he just did, he casually puts his fist in his mouth.
Cas was staring at the bouquet in Dean's hand. Of course, he was staring, it wasn't like Dean brought flowers every day.
“I wanna talk with you.”
“I… You…” Dean clears his throat. “You can cut tomatoes.”
“Oh!” he says to Sam and clears his throat. “I can assure you me and your brother didn't have any sexual intercourses... We're just cuddling.”
Dean turns his head to look at him. Cas has closed eyes, he looks like he's sleeping. Dean turns his head to look at him. Cas has closed eyes, he looks like he's sleeping. Dean leans to him, and brushes his lips with his own.
“What are you doing?” asks Sam, walking into Dean’s room. His brother is sitting on the floor, putting the baby cot together. The second baby cot because one of them is in Sam’s room already.
Dean smiles and leaves surprised Cas alone in the library.
“You'll figure it out,” says Dean. “Look, I made you a breakfast. I didn't know what you prefer, so I made a little bit of everything… Sit.”
“Hug you?” he repeats, surprised, and Cas nods to confirm his words. Dean clears his throat, but gets up from the chair, eventually. “Yeah, sure… no problem.”
“I... You always have me, Cas.” Dean takes his hand in his own and squeezes it three times. “You always had me.”
“Sounds fun,” says Mary, and Cas blinks twice. He forgot about her presence for a while.
The first time, it happened when he walked to Dean's room.
Music starts playing, and Dean knows what to do. It's a sign for him.
“Jeez, Sam, I'm not sleeping with Cas!”
Every sentence in a cracked voice is for him like punch on the face. Cas didn't want to come back because Dean wasn't good enough…
“Okay, mommy… Can I get my weenie too?”
He knocks twice and waits. Dean opens him door and looks a little surprised.
“Do you want more?” asked Dean insecure.
Cas closes his eyes, maybe if he stops looking, the Empty goes away? But no, he's still feeling a warm hand on his cheek, and a soft voice, Dean sounds like this very rare.
“Okay, we should join the rest…” says Sam quickly, ending this pointless conversation. They’re sitting at the table. Dean takes the chair near to Cas, and John sits against them. They’re eating and talking. Charlie tells a few jokes, lightning the mood of the room. Dean is smiling a lot, and he thinks that this time it’s not going to end with a fight. He doesn’t know how wrong he is.
“Sorry? For what?” he asked a little confused. It was just a stupid card, and he thought they could just laugh off and forget about this.
One day, he smiles to see a new stack of paper.
“Yes, I am. But sometimes, I think I don't belong here. I shouldn't be on Earth after so many years. It's crazy that my sons are older than me...”
They went to the small kitchen. Cas took baby formula, still holding Jack.
“Did you like it?”
Dean doesn’t pull away.
Cas takes a few steps closer, lies his right hand on Dean's arm and looks into his green eyes, tilting his head a little and frowning eyebrows.
“Acting? I'm not acting, Sammy! I just do my damn job. Somebody has to! And it's the end of the discussion. I'm coming, whether you like it or not.”
“Dean, please… Just don’t…”
“Nothing special,” he gasps, hoping it ends the discussion.
“Cas, what’s wrong?” he asks when they’re outside, grabbing his arm gently.
“He's beautiful,” whispers Cas. And Dean's heart skipped a beat when he hears his soft voice. Cas doesn't even meet a kid, but he already loves him. “Can I send some of these picture to myself?”
“Apology accepted.”
Cas doesn't wait for anything, he just turns around and goes away. Sam is still standing outside, and he's thinking about their conversation. It's so obvious now, how has he never noticed this before? Cas always stared deeply into Dean's eyes, he had a problem with personal space only in Dean's case. And of course, he did everything for him. He gave everything to him…
Dean walks, but he stops close to Cas. He touches his arm and squeezes it. He wants to take his hand away a few seconds later, but Cas grabs it.
“And where's the fun?” he asks, and this time he is the one who pushes Cas's car.
“Yeah… Me too, Cas.”
“You're tired, buddy, huh?” asks Dean, and gives him his plushie bee, Jack grabs it in his small hands, and immediately puts it in his mouth. “Jack, don't eat the bee.”
“You could sit here,” Cas says enthusiastically, pointing at one of the chairs. “In the morning, after fishing. I would bring you a blanket and coffee. Black without milk and sugar.”
“What? Why does he... Wait, you and Cas...” mumbles Sam, and Cas doesn’t understand anything of this. It’s really confusing.
“I'll leave in the morning,” he decided, not looking at Cas.
Dean’s mind was messy. What all of this actually means?
“Of course.” Cas makes two steps closer and focuses at Dean. “What do you wanna tell me?”
“I know, but you're more like lily.”
“You think, Jack can sense Cas because of this?” Sam interrupts his thoughts. “I mean, they were connected somehow.”
Sam hangs up, and Dean puts his phone in the pocket. They're ready to drive, bur before he takes keys, Cas puts his hand on his shoulder.
It can't be true. He has to have in mind he loves him like a brother. That's why Sammy said before that Cas is a family. But he needs to ask anyway.
Dean gulps, wondering what he should to say. It's obvious he won't mention a kiss, but he needs to say anything. He clears his throat and speaks nervously.
Dean lies at the hospital bed, he had blood tests earlier that day, and now he waits for a doctor. Alone.
“Really?” Cas turns his head to him, and smiles cheerfully. And dammit, all of this was worth that smile. Dean nods and smiles back.
To finish his last poem.
He was watching cards for a while, before he noticed one blue card with cute bees in the middle in green heart and with the words ‘Bee my Valentine!’. He smiled a little for this, he really enjoyed about bees, so he took a card to the shopping cart. Sam saw this, but he didn't say anything. Cas was weird sometimes, or maybe often than sometimes, so he used to this.
“You mean… It was you all the time?” Dean's heart skips a beat. What is it supposed to mean for them, actually? “Cas… I…”
“It’s still morning,” he points. “How 'bout the walk?”
Morning kisses are Cas' favorites.
Writers of Game of Thrones are laughing.
Dean goes away, and Cas follows him. They walk to the other bathroom, but this one doesn't have a shower, just a bathtub. Dean turns water on, and pours some bubble bath there, which makes a foam. He helps Cas to take off his clothes - the coat, shirt, tie, trousers and even socks. Cas stays only in the boxers.
Dean scratched his head, thinking about some reliable lie.
“We should have all necessary ingredients in the trunk. Wait a minute.”
“Daddy loves you,” he repeats. “You don’t love daddy?”
The new song starts playing. This time it’s ‘Living On My Own’, again old, good Freddie.
Cas is back from the Empty, and Dean tells his truth, using a poem.
“How do you say 'I love you’ in Enochian? I couldn’t figure it out, and I read two books 'bout that,” he explains, raising his eyes to catch Cas’ gaze.
They kissed again. This time longer and more passionately. They pulled away, and Dean took his hands off Cas’ face. They stared for each other like always and the silence was so peacefully. All the tension has gone.
“Stop being irresponsible.”
“Bitch!”
“A lot, actually.”
“You know why did I ask you to leave?” asked Cas. “Because I knew it's gonna be harder if you stay. Every day made that I would miss you more.”
“Why he's still dreaming?” Sam comes closer, looking for his brother nervously.
“Where is what?” Sam seems to be a little distracted, he looks at Dean, frowning and shaking his head. He is still shocked, so many things happened too fast.
Cas comes to Dean’s room for the first time since he left the bunker. They are good now. Everything else is wrong, Chuck still pulls the strings, but at least, they’re okay. Dean is talking so much about Chuck, new plan and about missing Cas… His voice is soothing, and Cas feels more comfortable after some time. He looks around, eyeing much longer at the desk. There’s many crumpled papers, but one is still in the typewriter. It means Dean started writing something new recently. Cas doesn’t want to read it, but he does it involuntarily.
“Screw you!”
“Oh! Do you remember Trickster? I mean, Gabriel?” he asks, and Cas nods. “It was similar. I had to play in some romantic movie.”
He stands and checks the other rooms. He's looking Cas for a long time, until he hears two voices. Some people are talking in the hallway, so Dean is hiding behind the wall and eavesdropping.
They have everything what they want: beautiful house, amazing car, hard-working husband, lovely wife and two kids; a girl and a newborn boy. This is what Mary thinks. This is what John thinks. The truth is that they are husband and wife with a house and a car, but not with a daughter and son because they have two sons, actually.
and names. It takes him only a few seconds to find his ghost on this list, but before he can do anything more, he hears some noise.
“Everything is okay. I'm here, Dean,” he whispers, and pulls his lips to Dean's lip bottom. The kiss is soft and subtle as if Cas is scared he can hurt him. Maybe, it's because he still doesn't believe in his happiness, and he isn't sure how to behave.
It's Friday night. Cas lied to John that Dean had invited him to dinner. It's almost six o'clock, so the older Winchester should to be here soon.
“Ok, we should to go,” whispers Dean, giving a peck on Cas' cheek, but he doesn't move at all. Here is so comfy and warm... It's the Heaven.
“Oh, sorry, Cas. We were just wondering… You know, you have never been on the date. I assumed you can be asexual, but I didn't know what about a romantic aspect, but after April… Oh, I'm not sure if you wanna talk about it.”
He needs a light. A sunlight which could dance across his face, making him happy. But his sun is away, and he can just wait.
Cas stands and takes a deep breath. He's really anxiously, but he only clears his throat and makes a few steps closer to Dean.
“No, it's not… I can do it even now, it's easy, but I'm not sure it's right thing,” he explains.
“I made you a breakfast and coffee, you find it in the kitchen,” Cas said fast after Dean came downstairs, still in his hot dog pajama's pants. “And later, you could help me pack all this stuff to Impala.”
And he stays, even if he knows it's awkward for Dean. But he can't help that he want to be close to him even when they're arguing, or whatever it is.
“Okay,” nods Cas and smiles to him.
“Something wrong?” asks Dean, and raises his eyes to him, pulling his phone on the nightstand.
“How did you find us?”
, she thinks.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas doesn't even bother to look at him. There's silence between them for a moment, then Dean comes closer, and pats Cas' shoulder gently.
“I'm gay.”
“What? No, I'm sure we did. Was there a new attack?” Cas is a little confused. They didn't have any case for weeks.
“My apologies, Dean.” Cas goes away, not waiting for anything. There’s nothing for him. Not anymore.
“We haven't checked Tunnel of Love yet... Can we go there now on the proper date?” asks Cas and gives him a hand. Dean takes it and squeezes.
“Cas, I'm so sorry… I'm sorry, I didn't protect you,” he whispers, and tears fall down his face. He doesn't care about this, he has the right to cry and grieve. He lost him again, and this time is different, no more miracles, no more remarkable resurrections. Chuck won't show up now, he won't snap his fingers to get him back. God has his own business. But Dean has to try anyway. He closes his eyes and starts praying, for the first time he's praying to somebody else than Cas.
Every time, when Sam walks to the kitchen with a baby in his arms, Dean excuses at once and goes away, sometimes to his room, and other times to his car for a quick ride around the neighborhood. He doesn't care about a devil child, all responsibility rests with Sam who took that burden. That way is easier for Dean.
“Cas… I-I'm happy too, you know that?” Dean asks, and Cas nods. “And I'm glad I woke up next to you.”
Next time he whispers 'Je t'aime’ between two French kisses, and it starts a new tradition. Dean wants to say 'I love you’ in every language, and Cas seems to be pleased when he hears it.
“Thank you, Dean. It was a wonderful day. I don't think I've ever had so much fun,” says Cas in the evening. They were almost everywhere that day.
“Dean, no! I can explain this!” shouts Charlie desperately.
“So, release me! I don't want to disturb you.”
Cas sits next to him, but he gives him enough space. Dean takes guitar and clears his throat. He play ‘Simple Man’, and to Cas surprise, he also sings.
“Okay, I need a break…” says Dean and laughs. He's not tired, but he feels it's the place where they need to stop. It will happen right here, right now. Cas is smiling at him all the time, their eyes meet together… Immediately, they hear a music. Slow, beautiful and very romantic. Dean is looking for sound source. Some guy with a deerstalker on his head is staying by the one window of an old building and playing the violin.
Finally! Cas is back <3
“Cas?” he clears his throat.
“No, it's…” Dean has no idea what he should to say.
“You were talking about it earlier. Besides, you're sweet like honey, so it suits you.” Dean takes it and pins it to Cas' coat.
“Mom is dead,” he says, ending discussion. Or rather hoping that it ends that pointless conversation.
Dean's face softens suddenly. He chuckles and grins: “You're so dorky sometimes, Cas. She didn't mean it literally. People say things like this all the time. You know, it's the other form for
“Sure, egghead.”
“Mommy, what's it?” asks four years old Dean with curiosity, pointing at Sam's penis.
“Can I hold him?” he asks, and Dean chuckles.
The rain is awful, but both of them don’t care about that, laughing and running. Together. Dean doesn't remember when was the last time he felt so free, and so happy… This evening could be last forever.
Dean rolls his eyes.
“You don’t have?” How it was possible? Everybody has some type, right?
Dean opens a door, walks inside and lays Cas gently on the table. Looking at the dead body of his best friend is too painful for him. He feels like his heart, if he has a heart at all, breaks in half. Castiel was his family, he and Sam were the most important persons in his life, and now he lost one of them.
“Cassie, are you blushing?” asks Balthazar, after he came back to their room.
Dean grabs his arm, and guides him to his own room. Cas is surprised when they're passing his room, but he doesn't say anything because in his heart he feels a relief. He didn't want to bother Dean anymore, and he couldn't sleep, but being with Dean in the same bed is comfy and safe, so he knows he'll fall asleep soon.
“I’m not good at that, actually. Sonny taught me a few chords when I was a teenager, and I found the guitar in the basement a few weeks ago. I practice since then.”
“Do you want me to play you something else?” he asks, and Cas smiles at him.
“Jelly,” Cas corrects him.
“I love you, Dean. I said to him that I love you…” he whispers.
“I’m an angel, Dean…”
“I'm not sure about that. I made a few shitty decisions either,” she admits.
“Look, I know it's not the same. But it's the only thing I could find on my way,” he said, pulling a single blue flower from his pocket. “Forget-me-not for unforgettable angel.”
You can find it
“Hi, Jack. I'm here. Dad's here,” he whispered calmly, taking Jack from the cradle. He kissed his forehead, and the kid stopped crying at once. “You're hungry, right? We'll make you a bottle, come on.”
“It was six years ago, Cas... Were you planning to told me that some day? Or you just waited for a moment when you're dying?”
“I’m sorry, Cas. It was stupid,” he says quietly.
“Okay… But I don't see a glass anywhere,” points Dean.
“…sleep. You’re an angel,” he finishes the sentence and smiles. “I know this, buddy.”
“With a thousand of flowers?” Dean continues dreaming. “We could build it on our own.”
“So, what are you planning now?” asks Charlie. Dean doesn’t answer immediately, and when he does, he chooses his words carefully.
When they pull away, breathing hard, Cas stares at him confused. And the first thing, he can think about is a question...
“Yeah... So, why it sounds like that?”
“I'm asking, would you like to go with me on the… date?” he repeats.
Cas gets into bed, he lies on his left side with a hand under his head. Dean covers him with a duvet.
And now, in his almost forties, he carries on the family tradition, sipping crappy beer…
, thinks Cas, but Dean is the one who says it loud.
They also stop to eat some junk food - hot dogs, popcorn, cotton candy and peanut brittle. Cotton candy seems to be Cas favorite, even if it's just a sugar.
He started panicking. Dean is gonna hate him. But maybe he can explain it somehow? He didn't do this on purpose! It was just an accident. Just the nicest accident in the world when their lips met together for a few seconds. And it was sweet, and it felt so good... And Cas wanted more.
At nights, Cas looks at Pottery Barn catalogues, thinking about apple-pie life with Dean.
“He's an angel, so everybody loves him. Come on, he's adorable.” Dean points at Cas who is doing his puppy look to soften a woman's heart.
“Yes, I knew,” whispers Cas, and his words hurts Dean. He takes a deep breath.
’. It was hard to get them both there, they were standing next to each other, brushing their arms because that small it was!
The kid starts crying again, this time with a sound of truly despair. Dean pulls him closer to his chest: “Shh, little buddy. Why are you crying? Everything is okay. You had a bottle right away, you should to sleep now. Come on, go sleep, buddy.”
Cas bites his lip and hesitates. Is it a good idea to ask about it? Isn’t it inappropriate?
“Right. Meg and that chick, what was her name? April?”
“Why?”
“Of course, Dean.”
“I heard when you were talking with him. I heard what you said...” he explains, and Cas is shaking his head nervously. “Just let me finish. I mean, he didn't say it back, and I have to ask if he said it back to you even once?”
Dean is so proud of his choice that he stops being angry at Cas at all. Actually, why would he be?
“No,” says Cas quickly.
“Shit!” shouts Sam when accidentally spills out some baby formula. “Okay, do you want me to call somebody?”
“Why are you laughing?”
“He has right, dad,” says Sam. “You can’t control his life anymore.”
“Yeah, I guess...”
Cas gulps and nods: “Yes.”
“I have the same problem with women,” says Dean.
Dean is in the Heaven. He's drinking a shitty beer with Bobby and his abusive father.
Cas wants to walk away, but Dean grabs his wrist. His heart is pounding like a hammer, and he’s not sure what exactly he plans, but he knows he can’t let Cas go away.
Cas is hurt and he doesn't want help from Dean. Why?
“What the hell are you doing, Charlie?!” he yells, and then the girls pull away. Charlie jumps a little, and he sees terror on her face. “I'm gonna kill that bitch!”
The next question is full of a sadness and a terror, and makes that Dean isn’t sure how to behave. He doesn’t want to worry Jack, but he can’t just say it!
“Cas, about earlier. You need to know, I'd never do this again. And I mean it. I want you in the bunker. I would know that you're safe,” he explained, and Cas' heart skipped a bit.
“’M fine. But I’m a little busy right now, so…” he tries to end this call.
“Good.” Dean didn't sound like anything was good. He took a bottle again to keep his hands busy.
“Because daddy loves you,” answers Jack quickly like it’s the most obvious thing on the Earth.
“He has nightmares, and he is scared, that's all. It's a big bed, Sammy!”
“I think you should say something like ‘Hello, Dean’!” he tried to do Cas’ voice impression with hope that the angel is going to smile a little. But he didn’t, he was still serious and sad.
“Do you need some help?” Cas asks casually like nothing strange happened just a moment ago because for him, indeed, it’s nothing strange.
New chapter!
“Cas, you can tell me. I'm not judging, and I won't tell him anything,” she promises.
What if the Gorgon (14x14 Ouroboros) kissed Cas on the mouth?
“Shh, it’s okay. And I’m sorry I wasn’t clear enough.”
And there’s only one word:
“Of course,” says Cas.
So, it's over. Real Dean,
Cas hidden his Angel Blade, believing that it was no longer necessary. He still maintained the eye contact with Dean, and he didn't move even one inch.
more! It’s like Cas reads his minds because he cups his face gently and kisses his forehead again. Then, Cas traces with his lips Dean’s face; his eyelids, cheekbones, nose… And Dean doesn’t stop him, he allows for that kind of fondness.
“Good night, Dean.”
“Umm, you know how to use a shower?” asks Dean, and Cas nods.
“Great, the other one!” murmur Dean. “Cas, he meant... Dammit, he thought we're having sex!”

“So, can I assume I have free evening?”
“What do you mean?” Sam looked at his brother and frowned eyebrows. He had no idea, what was going on.
“The thing is... He could never feel the same, and I... Even if he does, my father would despise me, I can't do this. I can't like the other man this way.” Maybe John was dead for years, but Dean was still afraid of him to even try to live his own life.
“No, I got this. I just wanna say I'll be gone for a couple of days…”
Later, they have noon, afternoon and more kinds of kisses.
“I don't.”
“He... no, he didn't,” answers Cas in sadness.
“Cas, you’re bleeding as hell, you know your mojo is low recently. Just let me take a look at this.”
When she goes away, he takes two cans of milk formula and moves the trolley to the other alley. There’s a lot of baby stuff like cots, diapers, bottles, pacifiers and clothes. He takes a three-pack of bodysuits because he noticed earlier that day Jack is definitely bigger now, and Sam has shitty taste in clothes, better if he chooses something.
The lady didn't believe him, but she smiled anyway and started talking. She talked a lot, like she missed for company. When Dean walked away, he knew that she sold flowers for years, earlier her wife had helped her; he knew she had an old cat; he knew meds were expensive; and he knew that her names was Jude.
“It's… it's not okay, Sammy. I'm broken, something is wrong with me.”
“Don't. Just, don't,” Cas sobs, closing his eyes to hiding his tears.
“Dean, why did you say that?” he asks, he needs to know, he needs to be sure.
He isn't sure if it's only his imagination, or Cas stand a little too close to him. He feels butterflies in his stomach.
“But they're not mine,” Cas gasps. Is it so hard to understand that this isn't about a cup, or honey? Cas just feels so lost. Everything he does is wrong, and now he finds out his coffee is wrong too. Cas is a shitty human, he knows that, Dean doesn't have to remind him about this all the time. “Whatever... I don't want coffee anyway. I'm going to my room, it's the last what left for me.”
“Not exactly, we like him because... it's Cas, you know. But I'm talking about these side effects when you can't stop staring into his blue eyes... How else would it work? He's a weird dorky little guy, and you just wanna cuddle him and grab his chubby cheeks...” Dean grins, still watching Cas.
“It's about Jody. She asked me about something... A little favor, but I didn't do this, and now I feel guilty,” he explains, gasping.
“Of course, Dean. Always.”
, or some confession. And definitely it's not Sam's business. Dean lies to himself, so he isn't sure if he could admit this out loud.
It's not what Cas expected, he looks at Dean, who's staring at the road and whispers words of comfort: “I'm so sorry, Dean.”
“You shouldn't do this! And never do this again!” he said, pretending he’s still pissed off.
“You must be hungry, I'll bring you something,” offers Dean, and walks away. Sam stays with him, he's frowning like he's worried. Cas doesn't say anything. His throat is too painful, and actually, he has no idea what he could say. That he screwed up one more time? That he failed?
Cas turned around to leave the room when he met Dean's eyes. Still with a kid on his arms, he stood and stared at Dean.
Inspired by
Dean chuckles. If only it was so simply in real world…
“You are very welcome!”
“Night' Cas,” he murmurs. Cas' heart is pounding like crazy, but he has enough strength to respond.
He screwed up this time, Cas starts back off. But maybe he still can fix it?
“Umm, Dean?” Cas touches Dean's elbow gently to get his attention. “You have a tear in your trousers.”
“But Dean is my son, and I love him,” he says. “And I think it's something what we have in common.”
“I think we should kill ourselves, right now,” he says calmly, and he doesn't wait for anything anymore, instead he stabs a knife into his chest. He needs to come back, even if he doesn't want to.
“He drew your freckles…” points Cas.
“Jerk!”
For the first time, he appears by the lake when John is fishing. The older Winchester jumps at his chair and grumbles: “It's you!”
,” he makes a little pause here “He wants to invite you on a burger on Friday night. If you tell him about our
, he thought. Cas seemed to be really okay with this, but Dean still weren't.
“Yes, Dean, of course, I'll stay. Always.”
Dean stares at him for a long moment, plucking up courage. He starts rubbing little circles with his thumb on Cas’ palm and takes a deep breath, before he whispers:
“Thanks for coming,” he murmurs.
Jack is lying in his cradle, he’s awake, and he smiles immediately after he sees Dean.
to his best friend. He was pretending that it’s just to fix the shitty Cas’ taste of music, and he didn’t do a big deal with it, just he gave it to him in casually after one dinner. Maybe that’s why Cas thought that he needed to return this? Great he screwed up even that simple thing.
“But you can catch a cold. And it's not good for your joints,” he points. “You're old, Dean. You should be more careful.”
“That I like you more than I thought,” he says, but he isn't sure if he should. What if he destroys their friendship?
“Oh, it's not me. It's Sam, actually. You know, after you were gone, I wasn't a nice guy… It was tough for the beginning,” he tries to explain himself, but it doesn't sound good. Jack is an innocent baby, and he is an adult, he should've been a responsible one.
Everybody looks at him, and Dean chokes on his beer. He makes red in one moment, gasping: “Jeez, Cas…”
There's a moment of silence before Cas decides to speak again.
This time, Dean pulls him even closer. And he holds him even stronger.
Dean opens his mouth, but he hesitates for the moment. He’s not sure if he should say what he thinks. Finally, he decides to do this: “Cas, I think… I could help you with this.”
“What? No, it's impossible, he almost never leaves my side, it's even hard to go pee alone,” Dean chuckles.
“Sure, Cas.” He moves a little and makes a place on the one side of the bed. Cas slides in under the sheets, and Deans turns the lights off. They're lying in bed, staring at each other. “How are you feeling, Cas?”
And he'll destroy this like always. He couldn't do things right. Cas loves him, but Dean doesn't deserve for it.
“Dean! You go against your will because Aphrodite forced you to do this, and I… I was enjoying it.”
They're sitting at the map table on the bunker. It's getting to late. Dean glances on Cas who is reading some manuscript, and licks his lips unknowingly. Sam notices this, but of course says nothing.
But it’s not all. Dean didn't think about it earlier, too busy with looking for this gas station, but now he has a feeling that something else changed. He looks at his crotch, seeing a bulge in his jeans. He swallows... It can't be... It can't be true.
“But you already did. And I don't know how to punish you.”
Dean squats next to Cas and pecks him on the cheek, then he looks into his blue eyes. He grins, showing his teeth, Castiel tilts his head on left, smiling a little.
“Hello, Earth to Sam... he's an angel, and he does this thing with his grace that everybody likes him... I mean, every human, it doesn't work on monsters, demons and others feathery douchebags...” he explains and rolls his eyes. Jeez, and Sam is the egghead? What is he reading in those old books?
“Cas... Something happened? Everything is okay with Claire?” he asks slowly in concern.
“Great!” gasps Sam with an irritation. Dean is a pain on his ass right now, and it won't change for a long time. “But you know what, Dean? It's not the son of Satan. It's the son of Cas.”
“Uhh, gross. I'm not gonna ask you about sex, dude. I just wanna know if you have ever been in love with some guy.”
Dean is shocked and probably a little scared, but he closes a door.
“Dean…” whispers Cas. He stands behind him all the time, but now he comes closer, putting his hand on Dean's arm, but the hunter doesn't react.
The clench in his lungs makes that Castiel can't breathe. It scares him at first, but then he reminds himself: he's an angel. And after that, he reminds himself that he's also dead, he doesn't have to do this. He doesn't have to breathe.
John stands and starts walking to own home. Maybe it wasn't real apology, but he tried. Mary should to forgive him now.
Dean saw that.
Dean takes another breath and touches his dick. He can feel it, he's not dreaming. It's real. He's real.
“I didn’t say that. I just don’t need it. Some angels have never had sexual intercourse, and some, like Gabriel, had lots. In my case… Maybe you noticed that I don’t even like being touch by strangers, so it’s… you could say random hookups isn’t ‘my cup of tea’,” he explains, using air quotes for the end. Dean nods, and it’s surprised for Cas, he didn’t suspect it would be so easy.
Dean.”
“Hello, Dean,” he greeted him. “I went with Jack to the farmer markets, and bought a few things you could eat for the breakfast.”
“Lucifer's son! Where is he? We need to kill him before isn't too late!” shouts Dean with a pure rage. Sam takes a quick look at the baby cot in the corner of the room, but immediately his eyes are back on his brother again. He was checking Jack on earlier, it was the first thing he did. Right now, the baby is sleeping.
Sam finishes feeding Jack, and the kid is slowly falling asleep in his arms. Dean opens his first bottle of beer in this evening, throwing a cap on the map table and taking a long sip after that. Sam gives him a worried look, but says nothing.
“I can walk.”
Cas nods, and without a word kisses his forehead one more time. Slower and longer. Dean closes his eyes and gasps quietly as he was surprised of this kind of kisses. He’s desperate, he wants more. No, he
“I said I fucked your son last night,” explains an angel with a big smile.
thought Dean.
Cas walks to Dean from behind and slowly puts his hands around his waist. He rests his cheek on Dean’s back. Dean freezes and stops peeling the vegetables.
Dean sees how Cas' body burns into flames, and for a second, he wants to lie next to him so bad…
“Hi, Cas…” he said slowly and made a few steps to his best friend, but he still kept the distance.
“Are you sure?” Sam seems to be surprised. He appreciates efforts, but he’s still not sure if Dean doesn’t take too many responsibilities on.
And the last one!
“So, do you wanna watch some movie together?” asks Dean after kissing. “You can choose.”
Next weeks are tough for Cas. He's confused most of the time, but he has his family next to him, and it helps somehow. He still isn't sure if it's not any trick, but every day it's easier to believe.
It became their tradition. Every Monday, Dean came back to the bunker with a new bouquet, always different flowers: tulips, daffodils, peonies, violets…
“It's not a good idea.”
Dean sits Cas down on the bed in the motel room, which they booked for a few nights, and ignores his pleas. Dude must be delirious, maybe because of blood loss.
It isn't freaking
A visible mark, the handprint, is gone years ago, but Dean always feels some part of Cas in him, however weird it sounds, somewhere deep in his veins. It's like Cas shared with him his grace when he was saving him from Hell. Maybe, it's the reason, they had a more profound bond? Or maybe it's because…
Love isn't a sin. Homophobia is.
“You're a big little guy, now. You're not gonna pee on me again, right?” asks Dean, but Jack, of course, can't answer to that. He just puts his hand in his mouth, and smiles a little. Dean needs to wean him away off this, he grabs gently baby's wrist, and pulls a hand from his mouth. “Oh, I know that smile… You're definitely gonna pee on me.”
He pulls away so fast, that Dean isn’t sure if it really happened. Did Cas just hug him with some kind of tenderness?
“Okay? It's not okay, Dean. Nothing is okay!”
Their conversation is over after Cas walks into the room. He smiles at them, and Dean thinks he has never seen him so happy before. It makes he's happy too.
“But why are you avoiding me? Did you realize something about me? Did you remind something what I had done wrong?” he asks nervously, tilting his head on the left and making a few steps closer to Dean.
“I don't criticize yours life choices... And coffee with honey? It's one of the few things which makes my day a little more tolerable,” he shouts and furrows his eyebrows in irritation.
Sam gasps and walks away. Dean looks at Cas, frowning: “What was that?”
“Shh... It's my turn,” whispers Dean, and comes closer. “I love you, Cas.”
“Sure, babe.”
, Dean isn't complaining at all. Actually, he says he likes my sexy feathery ass.”
explains Jody, and Dean feels a lump in his throat.
