“And Maja?” he said. Saying her name made him feel ill, and he didn’t know why.
It would appear that these are sort of coming into a story line. Wasn't my intention, but there we go!
“I mean, I’ll consider it. His early films were an inspiration to me, although his more recent work has become more pedestrian.”
The next morning.
“Sort of. He told Alice that one side of the mushroom would make you grow, and the other side would make you shrink. And she ate the wrong side first, and shrank so much that her chin banged on her foot. Then she ate from the other side until she was the height she wanted to be. And I was just thinking that Maja was the wrong side of the mushroom for me, see? She made me feel small. And you’re the… what?”
– to confirm he was MI6? To get a confession out of him?”
Several days passed, and they were no closer to an answer than the moment they had arrived at the museum.
John rose early the next day to visit the Royal Free Hospital. As he crossed through the lounge, he saw Holmes lying on the divan, curled up with his back to the room. He had clearly been there all night.
, Mycroft. We do talk.”
He was stirring the chocolate over the pot before he spoke again. “So how did you learn how to bake? Took a case in a bakery in Paris?”
“Isn’t it closed? It’s only – what time is it?”
The home of Mr. Nathan Garrideb was like a museum, John thought, but the most crowded, eccentric, discombobulated museum he had ever seen. His brain boggled at the sight of coins, statues, tapestries, engravings and other detritus of history from what seemed like every era of human time.
“Please don’t make me explain. I’m still struggling to delete the conversation.”
I’m waiting for the kind of thing I’ve heard before. I have never understood the leap in logic from hearing, ‘I don’t want to sleep with you tonight’ to saying ‘You’re a great big whore.’ If I’m a whore, I would sleep with you, right?
SHERLOCK: Well done! Do the
“Well, let’s see how much ground we can cover before sunset and the play starting. Jerome, you take the café, and John and I will take the theatre.”
“Naw, that was hilarious,” I say.
“That’s all true.” Sherlock pursed his lips. The situation was so complex now, it was hard to summarize in a way that Maja would understand. “Several years ago I did something here that made the government angry. Pavlović is taking his revenge by keeping me here, but I want to go back to England.” He frowned. “He’s gotten you two mixed up in all this too, I don’t understand why either. But John is worried that Pavlović will not allow you to live in peace, and he wants to get you and the baby out of the country.”
As he rounded the corner toward interrogation room five, he heard … something. He slowed down, quieting his footsteps to hear better. He had half expected to hear John still raising a ruckus – for a small man, he could raise a fairly loud ruckus if Sherlock had been slighted – but instead he heard something else.
Sherlock could not take his eyes off the stars. They spread out across the windows of the cockpit like a cold blanket across his entire field of vision. He had known they were there, of course; glimpsed as he left a party or a play, adding to the ambiance of an evening with a client. But this - this was like the difference between reading about a chemical reaction and seeing it in front of him. It was real, it was before him, it surrounded him. He now understood why Inara called it ‘The Black’, why she had been drawn to it, why she had spoken wistfully of it in her old age.
“Why portraits?”
Rope.
John let the sarcasm pass. “So can I?”
“There are not many of us left,
Bantam could not have devised a better torture for Sherlock if he had considered the matter for a year.
He tried to calculate the odds of John’s survival, then shook his head, sick welling up from his gut. If he went on with this line of thinking, his mind would turn into a wailing, gibbering child. John was either alive, or wasn’t. More than likely he wasn’t. At this point, and into the future – whatever that future may hold – he had to focus on survival, for himself and for Rosie. He thought of the vow he had made, so long ago, on such a different day. Well. He had failed John several times over; he had certainly failed Mary. He would not fail Rosie, now that it was truly important.
John closed the door to his room on Rosie sleeping peacefully. His hand still felt warm from Sherlock’s hand in his, neither of them letting go the whole walk back from the park. He could hear Sherlock pacing downstairs, and he let out a huge hissing breath.
“And you,” said the scarred man, “are not going to look so pretty tomorrow.” He pulled out his dagger: short, sharp, glinting in the dim light of the alley.
“Now you’re the Cheshire Cat, not the Caterpillar,” John said. “Shall I start?”
“Some of her hairs were caught on the side of the window,” Holmes said. “You came to reason with her, ask her to come away with you, but she refused. When reason failed, you tried force.”
Georgie began to speak again. His first words were, “Rosie play?” His family was never found, but Delia and her husband adopted him.
Sherlock snorted, then began to chuckle. His body shook against John’s until John started to laugh too. They giggled together until Sherlock’s body relaxed into John’s arms.
“No. She’s a client, nothing more.”
Sherlock refrained from snappishly defending John, and was amazed that Maja was still critical of her husband, even in this situation. “There is more to John than just a doctor.”
The challenge ahead was not insignificant. There was survival, obviously; but there was Rosie’s mental health to consider as well. She didn’t really remember the loss of her mother, she had been too young, but at this age she would certainly wonder where her father was. Sherlock had no idea what was ahead, but he reinforced his vow there and then – to take care of Rosie, in every sense of the word, no matter what the future would bring.
értóng = child
“You have much experience with geniuses?”
Separating in the shower room had been torture, leaving the brittle cocoon of safety they had created, back into the dangers of the world outside. Sherlock had kept his hands on John for as long as he could, and John’s own hands seemed equally reluctant to pull away.
Mycroft laid a recording device on the tray beside Sherlock’s bed. “I am here to take your official statement, Sherlock. Kindly give us an account of everything that happened since the plane crash to the present moment.”
“I don’t think you’re going to dance tomorrow, Sherlock,” Maja sang.
“No.”
“Detective Inspector Riggs had me come with him to finish processing the suspect, and I wasn’t able to get away until now.”
, my sex-addled brain reminds me.
“…The right side of the mushroom? Sherlock?”
Sherlock looked at John, and something settled inside him. He
“Oh. Okay.” John blinked a couple more times, then closed the microwave. “Thanks.”
“I know,” Sherlock said. “You can’t be that tired, you slept for five hours. Now, there’s been a theft-”
, why would a murderer poison the flask, killing a man without anyone knowing, then promptly save her victim in front of hundreds of witnesses? Also it’s obvious from the scuffs on the toes of her shoes that psychopathy is not in her makeup.” He paused. “As it were.” He heard John snort quietly next to him, but was able to suppress his own smile.
“I have to admit it’s pretty cool. I’ll have to bring the sprogs the next weekend I’ve got them. But keep an eye open, John – the aquarium manager really is a bit of a dick, so try not to kill him, or let Sherlock kill him, all right?”
Sherlock unsteadily followed John into the front of the ship, into what was clearly the cockpit. There were two chairs, one for the pilot, with a dashboard filled with switches and screens, and the flight controls. He collapsed into the other chair as John slid into the pilot’s chair, already flipping switches and pressing buttons before he had fully taken his seat. Sherlock could feel power leap up in the body of the ship, buzzing through the floor and his bare feet.
John swallowed hard, and found himself blinking back tears. “I see you, Sherlock,” he whispered.
“Worth every penny,” Jim replied. “And I read it too. It’s not just on display, it’s meant to be read. All books are meant to be read.”
Sherlock heard Pavlović growl minutely, deep in his throat. Then Pavlović smiled and raised his hand in greeting.
The room was orange and pink with the dawn when John’s eyes fluttered and blinked open. His eyes darted fretfully around the room for a brief moment before settling on Sherlock.
, he thought,
“Nope.” The blond man gestured at Sherlock. “Your clothes.”
Sherlock sighed. He wasn’t sure if this would be easier if John was looking at him. “Well. I was angry she had deceived you, and I didn’t want her to go on doing so. I wasn’t sure of your situation, and I thought having her with me would give us more leverage to negotiate your release. Also… she had failed her mission, to capture or kill me, to get a confession from you. I wasn’t sure what she would face in Pavlović’s hands. And I was worried about…”
Here's how it is: Sherlock gets a new case, and brings in an expert - aka John Watson. Blue becomes green, John's afraid to sit down, Sherlock pretends to not know what to do, and they both learn something about each other.
He dragged John, spluttering and half dressed, up the stairs to the rehearsal space he had created in the upper room.
Sherlock straightens his spine, looks down at John. His voice comes out calm. “It doesn’t matter anyway.”
A short pause, then the hard clink of metal hitting the cobblestones. “Damn you, Holmes!”
John and Sherlock are reunited; John tells how he survived the bomb.
“Of course.”
His logic was that perhaps Mycroft and his colleagues were still in their bunker, and not able to see Sherlock on the surface because of the destruction of the cameras. Waiting would be sensible, until they came out. Yes.
“Do you really think Mrs. Cubitt shot Mr. Cubitt, Doctor Watson?” Brigit said, her eyes wide.
“I thought-” John says.
“We also have a lovely pan fried halibut-”
He was starting to shiver now in the chill of the morning, and no doubt from blood loss. His side hurt as though it was screaming at him, and he longed to lie down on a soft bed, but he forced himself to keep walking.
, surely you could have explained to these idiots?”
“How’s the tibia?” asked Mrs. Hudson. “Do you need to see Doctor Wiggins?”
“He’s not in pain, at least not insurmountable pain,” Mycroft said, his smile widening in relief. “He’s not groaning. He’s
Four minutes.
A whooping came from the television, startling him. He dashed to the sitting room, his eyes only for Rosie, who looked up at him with some confusion.
“Now is very okay,” I say. We sit at a table. They sit next to each other as though the distance of a table between them is just too much to handle. I sit across from them and I need fucking sunglasses for the light coming off them. I can’t help grinning at them.
JOHN: Just like you do, love. Just different steps.
“Well done, Watson,” Holmes said. He ran his hand over his hair, setting it back into place, putting his hat on. “Come on, then. Lestrade will want our statements.”
“… I’ll think about it.”
John pushed down the double beat of his heart, and said, “That’s unfortunate, Holmes. I was there last week, and I am due at South Western Hospital today. My apologies.”
They were walking to Regent’s Park, John on Rosie’s right, holding her hand, and Sherlock on her other side. Every ten paces or so, Rosie would shout, “One! Two! Three!” and John and Sherlock would swing her between them, making her screech with delight.
“There are floor mats.”
"So you didn't attend, but I am the one being punished by being summoned to your stupid club for lunch?"
Holmes immediately began to study the papers, laying them all out on the desk and staring at them, his eyes leaping from page to page. The minutes stretched out.
“I would be pleased to show you around the collection now,” said Mr. Garrideb. “It is the very least I can do for the trouble you’ve gone to.”
, he thought dully. No way out, no way for the nightmare to end. Forever dancing for the glitterati of Serbia, no chance of getting out.
Holmes and John stared at the messages in horrified silence. They turned to each other.
“Dear God,” Sherlock groaned. His hands moved sharply. “Next.”
As Holmes put on his coat, John wondered if he could find a way to dispose of the needle, but he had won this small victory and decided to leave it for now.
“He’d faint on the spot,” John grinned despite himself.
John punched the car’s heater again, which they had discovered didn’t work when they were too far away from the rental place to turn back and complain, then put his hands back under his arms. “A bit.”
“Really?” Sherlock reached his long arm and flipped the switch.
Elsie,” Slade retorted. “She was promised to me back in America, and she’s still mine now.”
For a moment, John had trouble remembering how to breathe. Sherlock was not normally a modest man, given his tendency for walking around in a sheet – though John suddenly realized that he hadn’t seen Sherlock do that since before his ‘death’. But now Sherlock was fully naked before him; thin and muscled, his long arms, legs and neck open to John’s eyes. His penis hung softly between his legs. Despite the strength evident in the breadth of Sherlock’s shoulders and the lean muscles in his thighs, all John could see was vulnerability. His eyes were drawn like magnets to the bullet hole scar on Sherlock’s chest; round, silvered and so innocuous, as if it had never been gushing blood, as if it had never caused Sherlock’s heart to stop. Sherlock’s stomach was trembling as he breathed.
“Pretend you’re making fun of me then. I’ll do the same, and learn the time step while I’m at it.”
“Right,” Sherlock said. “Right,” he said again, but John was already slowly making his way down the hallway.
“Move, John, I’m coming down.”
That’s it. If I do one thing in my life that’s good, it’s this. I’m going to get these two to see sense.
“What’s your attitude towards guinea pigs?” I blurt out.
His head was still buzzing from his session with Ella when he arrived at art class. He knew there was sizeable work ahead of him to do, but he already felt stones lighter.
“Of course I have.”
Now John found himself grinning broadly. “Yes. After a rough start, I find myself rather liking fatherhood.”
“The hell, Greg?” John said.
“But Björk? Seriously, Sherlock?”
“I’d just get in your way,” John said, turning away.
He was making his way to the stage door when he saw Janina making her way to him, two glasses of champagne in her hands. “Sherlock, darling! You were marvellous! Come and celebrate!” she cried. She pushed one glass into his hand, and kissed him on the cheek. “Thank you for the flowers,” she whispered into his ear. “We can celebrate privately later, yes?”
There were a few cars on the road now, the occasional bus. An older woman wearing a headscarf nodded and said, “
“Righto,” she said. She tickled Rosie’s cheek again, nodded and went into the store. Sherlock blinked and turned away.
Just after midnight, the door to John and Maja’s room crashed open. “For God’s sake, can you not let us rest in peace?” John shouted.
He hardly noticed her helping him out of his clothes. Puffs of dust curled up from them as they fell to the floor. “That’s it, dear, you’ll feel ever so much better,” Mrs. Hudson murmured. “In you get, now.”
[They come together, one arm around the other’s waist, their other arms extended, hands clasped. They begin a fast polka around the room.]
“Dinner at Angelo’s,” Sherlock admitted. “But this is better, isn’t it?”
It was, in fact, a lovely tea, made even more lovely by the sight of Sherlock’s smile every time Mrs. Hudson looked away. Eventually she tidied the dishes onto the tray, said, “Good night, gentlemen,” and made her way down the stairs. Sherlock softly closed the door behind her and turned to John.
John stopped rubbing at it, realizing that he had been doing so without thinking. “Fine.”
John glanced at Jerome, who gestured him away with a wave and a worried expression, and John immediately turned and ran.
Seven minutes.
Sherlock licked his lips, his eyes darting around. “Fifteen stitches.”
“So what does he want? Is Mr. Nathan Garrideb in danger?”
John’s mouth had turned down, a crease had formed between his brows. “Personal Companion?”
SHERLOCK:  Guest artist of the Royal, John.
He found himself pacing in the alleyway for the last fifteen minutes before midnight, watching anxiously for the glitter of the net opening. Just as Big Ben boomed the last stroke of twelve, he saw it; he grinned and strode through.
“Nope. John,” he grins, and it’s all right. I don’t appear to be either a slag or a moron in his eyes.
“It’s more selections from the 90s and 00s that I need. Just – do your best, John.”
Chapter Notes
“She laughed.”
Sherlock releases John’s hand, straightens his back, and walks towards Mycroft, towards the next room. From the corner of his eye, he sees John as he passes between the rooms, between the cameras. Sees him tuck something small into his breast pocket.
I get the feeling that John spends a lot of his time apologizing on Sherlock’s behalf.
There was something about the tone of her voice that pierced through Sherlock’s aching head, through the sharpness of the fear he’d been living under for days. He let the gun drop, just a little, but didn’t take his eyes away from her hands.
“After we hit atmo, I’ll gun it, get some distance.”
“No,” Sherlock said, then cleared his throat of the dust. “No, Watson, we’re looking for Uncle Mycroft.”
,” an unfamiliar voice said. “Let’s get you out of here.”
John began to walk slowly toward Sherlock. His lips were moving silently, and he knew John was trying to say something while still aware of the guard, not so very far away. As John stepped closer, Sherlock finally heard what he was saying, over and over again.
“Friend of Wiggins, are you?”
But as he filled the kettle, something was different.
In the studio, after the guard left them alone, John waved at Sherlock’s bag. “All right, put on that stupid music of yours and get to work. Two weeks, she said. By then, I hope to God I’m rid of you.”
When he could breathe again, John looked down at Sherlock. Sherlock was still half-laughing and panting and humming with pleasure and aftershocks, all at once. John was overwhelmed for a moment with a swell of love for the man, this amazing, unique man – the only one in the world.
John glared, but it wasn’t heartfelt, and there was a little smile hidden behind the glare. “Are you sure? Nothing on today?”
Pavlović looked over at them, and smiled in a way that made Sherlock grit his teeth. “She’s going away,” Pavlović said, “right now.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and pulled out of the circle of Jim’s arms. He turned to face Jim, who was grinning widely.
“Later,” Sherlock murmured, “you will have to tell me more about this whorehouse. And the name of the girl.”
“I never guess.”
“No, I – I trust her. I’m sure.”
“Because you didn’t
SHERLOCK: I haven’t been a beginner since I was six years old.
Sherlock reached for the buttons of John’s waistcoat, but John stopped his hands. “Not yet,” he said, even though his heart was beating double time and he wanted to strip Sherlock down
He went to the sitting room and sat in his chair. Stared at the fire.
While Sherlock knew that it would never be home, his and Rosie’s camp in Regent’s Park began to become familiar, at least, and they began to establish a routine. Rosie woke early, when the darkness of the night transformed into the greyer light of what Sherlock could only assume was dawn. Mornings were when she was most willing to do what she called ‘shopping’ (that is, finding new food provisions in another abandoned shop), so they would camouflage their little cave until it looked more like a pile of branches, and head out.
“In the years when I was… in a bad place, it meant always being cold, because I’d never have enough money left over to pay for heating. I still don’t like being cold.
Cào = fuck
“Ain’t never seen someone make tea like that.”
Sherlock looked at the bundle in her hands, unrecognizable from the colourful silk that had swirled around him as he had danced the night before. “Burn them,” he said tonelessly.
“Well, don’t strip him here in the lab,” snapped Veronica. “Where are your clothes, John?”
Sounds like husband material to me. Step cautiously here.
“Yes. Well. It took some time before they would trust me.”
He looked out over the roof of the building. There was a platform about five by five feet, then a short distance down to the arch of the roof. He worked his body out of the small window, grateful for his natural flexibility and strength. Looking around, he saw only other houses, their chimneys puffing white smoke, and the wintery sun.
“Hi,” he says.
There was a rush to cool the cakes, make a syrup with the cherry brandy, soak the cakes in it, then carefully stack them with layers of whipped cream and sour cherries. Sherlock glanced over at John, who was busily squeezing the chocolate he had melted onto a piece of parchment paper, creating the outlines of trees. Clearly John was taking the definition of ‘Black Forest’ literally. Sherlock looked back at his own cake, where the cream looked as though it had been applied with a razor, perfectly level, but was otherwise plain.
As if in answer, John heard a crash and tinkle of a drinking glass or beaker breaking. John waited for Sherlock’s “Damn it!” which usually came after such a sound, but - nothing. John wondered if Sherlock had been holding something and fallen asleep, dropping it. Unusual but not surprising, it had happened before.
“No thank you,” Holmes said calmly. “I know you hail from America, but that’s not the way things are done here in England.”
“Who cares?” Sherlock said gleefully. “A
“Not really.”
[They shift into a more complex combination of steps. The difference in their training is now becoming more apparent:  while the steps are identical, John is looser with his posture, while Sherlock’s body holds the tension of his musculature; his feet are more turned out than John’s as well.]
. God, it would be a wonder if the interrogation window wasn’t smashed. It was unbreakable glass, but Greg didn’t give much credit to any man-made barrier between Sherlock and John.
“Subconscious thought, then?”
Jiàn tā de guǐ = bloody hell
Oh dear God.
Mycroft smiled at the sight of Sherlock, in loose white cotton pants and shirt; he was facing the wall, pointing at various spots. “He’s gained weight,” he said quietly.
“It’s wonderful to have John back, isn’t it? Just like old times.”
“Oh, we solved the case.”
John licked his lips, and Sherlock poured him a glass of water. John sipped, then drained the glass with great gulps. Sherlock poured more.
He stepped aside to let in the portly, elegantly dressed man. “It’s been far too long,” Yun said, as they kissed on both cheeks. “You’ve redecorated?”
“Hello,” Sherlock said, in shocked habit.
Moira was used to it; had a gift, Asif said.
John’s mouth twisted again, and this time Sherlock saw that John was trying not to grin. He nodded sharply, and strode away from Sherlock towards his bedroom.
John then took the bent poker and hooked it over the rope. To the bottom side of the hook he hung another loop of rope, about three feet in diameter. Maja stepped onto the window sill, and John helped her to sit in the loop, making sure it was tucked securely under her. Then with a brief, unreadable glance at Sherlock, he pushed Maja gently away from him.
For those who haven't seen Fleabag, Hillary is her guinea pig which used to belong to her late best friend.
“Sit down,” she said to Sherlock, without looking up. “Leave us,” she said to the driver with equal dismissiveness. The driver stepped out and closed the door, but Sherlock could still see his silhouette through the frosted glass.
“Oh no. Did he punch Sherlock? I warned him not to punch Sherlock.”
They kissed deeply and softly, the urgency passed. Sherlock tried to say everything with his lips and body that he knew he couldn’t say safely out loud – how much John had come to mean to him, how beautiful he found him, how much John had changed him. Then John looked up at him, and Sherlock saw everything he was trying to say reflected back in John’s eyes.
“I will admit to an error in my past with regard to my own sexual identification. I knew from my teenage years I was asexual, but thought that this also meant that I was broken, that I was unable to…love. Through research, initiated by the discussions with you and with John, I have realized that in my youth I had a very limited definition of asexuality, and that there are in fact many variations within that.”
“It’s late,” Sherlock said. It was an explanation, but not really.
she speak like that to him. How
But all Mrs Hudson said at that moment was, “Bless.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he heard Anderson shuffle papers. Such a simple question, any half-intelligent investigator should know the answer immediately - it was key to the case.
Sherlock looked up, towards the stage, as if seeing the words they were hearing from the play were visible in the air.
," Mycroft said blandly.
“My hands are so terribly cold.”
“Not an actor.”
“Sherlock, please listen to me.”
Something was changing.
“I know, I know, sir, but think of the return on the investment of your time!” John Garrideb said. “Five million – it’s now within our grasp! Only a little effort… and I’ve made such effort already, it’s poor of you to not take on this small, final step!”
Here's a recording of the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVj0tMxJ20
Sherlock huffed. “No.”
He nodded, and whispered, “Okay.” He didn’t know why he was whispering. The music was playing, the cameras wouldn’t pick up what he was saying anyway, but he whispered.
Sherlock looks like he’s going to fall down, and nobody moves for ages. Then his head jerks into a nod, then smooths out; he keeps nodding as John smiles.
“Maja Watson,” Sherlock said. Stars began to swim across his line of sight, and he thought that perhaps he should tell someone he was about to faint - but also needed to give Mycroft urgent information first.
Lestrade and John followed. “Thanks for coming, mate,” Lestrade said.
The song ended almost abruptly, and Sherlock wouldn’t admit it but found himself wanting more. “Interesting rhythmic changes,” he said, instead.
“I’ve never seen a sofa like that.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and pressed play.
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said, and his voice was cracked and exhausted. He looked down at the coin. “Oh good. You found it.”
“It will take some work, no doubt,” Holmes replied. “Mr. John Garrideb told us of his… exhaustive efforts in America. Perhaps we can do better here in England.”
The chaos in the dressing room area magnified by another degree. Dressers rushed past with racks of costumes, brushing past dancers stretching out in the hallway.
Lestrade swiped a few times at his tablet and then held it out for Sherlock to see. “Five so far, all over Persephone City.”
“Well,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I don’t know about you two, but I’m exhausted and want to sleep in my own bed tonight.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's an old family tradition," Mrs. Hudson said. "You make a wish and stir it in. You want to stir it in very well, so that the person you're wishing for will have your wish in their piece." Her voice lowered confidentially to John. "It's more a tradition of convenience. I made it up because I was tired of stirring."
Sherlock took the back seat of the car this time, half stretched out, his head leaning against the window. John wanted to be back there, holding him, but knew there was no room, and the time would come soon enough.
For a moment, Sherlock wanted to laugh at Mycroft and all his code phrases. This one dated back to when Sherlock was at school, his school before the Royal Academy, where he was regularly beaten up for being a boy who danced.
“It’s not that, it’s just – I have to go back. Bahdri, are there any labs left open?”
“What?”
“I’ll leave you to think about your performance, Sherlock,” Janina said as she stood. “When will you be ready to perform - shall we say two weeks Friday? Perfect.”
“Pose.”
When they came to the door, the Director said, “I would recommend a shorter visit this time, Mr. Holmes – about ten minutes. I’m sorry that you come all this way for such a short time, but he tires easily lately.”
“And besides,” Sherlock said, his voice firming, his hand hovering over the credits on the table, “this isn’t even enough for me for a single night.”
“Then Lassiter held a meeting of all the heads of history for all the colleges, and railroaded them into shutting the program down. I was the only dissenting vote. I’ve been trying to get through to Ishiwaka myself, to have him explain to Lassiter properly how the system works, but now Ishiwaka seems to have gone on sabbatical and no one will give me the number of where he is.
Shǎguā = fools
Sherlock followed Mrs. Hudson downstairs with only a minimum of grumbling, but placed the star with no complaint, adjusting it until it was perfectly straight.
It was a dance, a well-choreographed dance.
Pavlović, still smiling in a way that crept under Sherlock’s skin, walked out the flat’s door with the driver, closing it behind him.
“Right.” Sherlock sat up, the sheet falling from his shoulders to puddle around his waist. “Time I start learning, then. How do you drive this thing?”
They met Gemma in the nave of the church, caring for the few other children who were there: children who sat with their fingers in their mouths, wide eyes looking around for parents who were clearly not there. One child had hollowed out eyes and very little hair, despite his age, and what hair he had was in patches. There was a pile of blocks in front of him but he was ignoring them.
Sherlock stared. “That you’re not amazing? Brilliant? Sexy as hell?” John’s blush told him everything. “It’s true, all of it.” He took John’s hand into his, forcing him to look into his eyes. “I saw right from the beginning, the day I arrived at your house, that she was scornful of you, had no respect for you. It took me a while to trust you, but once I did, I could see how amazing you are. It makes me furious that she treated you like that, made you think so little of yourself.”
“True. So – tonight? Are we ready?”
“How quaint, John. Be cautious of your language around yeast – it might affect the rise.”
Sherlock stared at the board a moment, then knocked over his king. “A good game. Excellent.” He stood. “Thank you. I should go; thank you for meeting with me.”
Sherlock sighed and relaxed completely into John’s arms. Bliss.
“I agree. Then we eat, and snog on the sofa for the rest of the evening.”
Sherlock had sat up abruptly in bed. “Say that again.”
Instead he turned as cautiously as he could. Now that he knew they were there, he couldn’t take the risk of walking and being seen, so he crawled back the way he had come.
For what was probably the thousandth time since he’d met Sherlock, John wondered if he’d crossed some invisible line of propriety. If there was something that was too much to ask of a flatmate. If there was something that was too much to ask of Sherlock. On the other hand, how many flatmates go out to investigate murders together, before they’d even moved in?
“What makes you think that?”
Holmes’s body posture seemed casual and uncaring, but John could see a gleam in his eye. “I’m afraid I do not, Inspector Martin,” he said. “Firstly, may I draw your attention to the bullet hole in the window frame, here?”
Ŝta to radiš? - What are you doing?
John wordlessly extended his hand, and Sherlock’s hands were shaking as much as John’s as he carefully coated John’s fingers with the cool and slippery lube. “I love your hands,” Sherlock said. “I love you. Please. Get me ready for you.”
“Well of course I did, dear! Your brother won’t say so, but he’s been worried sick like I’ve never seen. He’s been on the phone nearly constantly since he arrived, talking to every connection he has here. And then we got word that you were in Belgrade, and well, and – oh, I haven’t slept since then. What happened, Sherlock?”
But sometimes he couldn’t help himself.
There was a rocking chair in John’s room that Mrs. Hudson had contributed when John had moved back in, and John heard Sherlock settling into it now.
With every street that they passed, with every clop of the cabbie horse’s hooves, Holmes remained silent. John thought over the possibilities of what would happen when they reached Baker Street:
“Him.”
The light went on in John’s head, and they said together, “E.”
“I said shut-”
Here’s the astonishing Gregory Hines tap solo from White Nights that inspired this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxI3K8GnpU
All through the night Sherlock kept falling asleep and jerking awake, staring wild-eyed around him, scanning the brutal landscape around them for any threats. He was more tired than he had ever been before in his life, but it was vitally important to stay awake.
“Not yet,” Mycroft said.
Eventually I tell him that I’ve got to close up the café, and he asks if we can exchange numbers. I like this. If he’s got my number and I don’t have his, all the power is with him to make the initiative. If I have his and he doesn’t have mine, he looks like a lazy slob that won’t make the first move to call after the prescribed number of hours/days. If we both have each other’s numbers, it’s more equal. Of course, it could end up with both of us trying to figure out when is appropriate, and then neither of us do it, and then it’s a stalemate.
The alley was dark and cool and abruptly quiet after the tumult of the Ball. John stopped and turned to face Sherlock, leaning against the rough brick. Sherlock saw that the bead of sweat had multiplied, that John’s face was florid and dewy. John’s eyes were serious and steady as he stepped closer to Sherlock and placed his hands on Sherlock’s waist.
“I did. I also said you weren’t from Edinburgh, but that is but a beginner’s deduction, as your accent is not broad, lacking the harder R sounds and the rounded Os. ‘Your hospital is the marvel of the age’ – I heard you in the hallway – versus ‘Yoor hospital is the marrval of thee aage’ – you see? Obvious. But Afghanistan – ah, but that was more of a challenge. The tan lines on your wrists and neck indicate that you have been in a hot country, but not for pleasure, as the lines in your face do not indicate a recent holiday. That you had been wounded is obvious from the stiffness with which you hold your body, particularly your shoulder – I am correct, it was the left, yes? What reason is there to be in a hot country with the risk of being shot but that you were a soldier at war – thus, Afghanistan. Further, you have left your commission, more likely discharged due to your injury, and have turned to fighting the battle of the intellectual; that is, become a scholar. The callous on your left inner index finger indicates the hard use of a pen or pencil in the taking of notes. Your study brought you to St. Bartholomew’s, therefore you are studying medicine. A soldier doctor. What an excellent combination of professions, sir, I congratulate you.”
He gasped in pain, feeling the warm wet of fresh blood trickle down his side. “Oh, is that where I hit you?” Maja said. “Nothing too permanent, I hope. Not that it matters, really.”
They were fortunate that they were not in 221C Baker Street when the building collapsed.
“Uh huh. So what are you lookin’ for, and how long will it take?”
“Yes, Doctor,” Martin said, and John thought he saw Holmes’ mouth turn up in a small smile. “She is upstairs, with Doctor Reeve from town. Would you like to take her care upon yourself?”
Jerome pulled up outside a building that staggered John’s senses. Most of it was a huge Victorian era stone building, with beautiful carvings across its façade; but on the north side of the building was a huge modern glass and steel addition, arching jaggedly at angles into the street. Even John, who was used to weird London buildings such as the Shard and the Gherkin, thought it looked a little out of place. Privately, John thought it looked like a flying saucer had crashed into the structure. Even Sherlock, who rarely noticed, let alone paid attention to non-crime related things such as architecture, paused for a moment to stare, frowning. Then he shrugged minutely, and they followed Jerome into the building.
“At first I thought it was one of the guards, caught up with you, but you weren’t acting like you had been captured. I couldn’t hear except faint voices through someone’s headset, and I could hear your voice and a high voice. And I realized that the bodycam was on Maja. And while I was trying to figure out why she would have a bodycam, I saw...”
“So how are you going to eat soup and get any of the vegetables, John?” Jen chimed in.
“Not really, I’ve been kind of seeing John and I’m kind of friends with Sherlock and,” I say, and my self censor decides to take a vacation, “I want to go chat with them and make them see that they’re actually in love with each other.” Then I smile brightly.
Nous ne voulions pas que vous vous blessiez dans votre sommeil. - We did not want you to hurt yourself in your sleep.
“Ba.”
“None. Would you check again, though, please?”
“Of course.”
“Oh God, oh God, Sherlock, I can’t breathe! You-”, then a fresh round of laughter.
“You can tell from the splatter pattern on the wall this was a crime of passion of jealousy obviously the killer struck from behind with an improvised weapon my bets are on the garden shears check the garage they’re likely missing then dig in the garden under the roses he’ll have buried them there but you know I could solve all of this much faster if you had just called me earlier instead of waiting until the scene is completely ruined by all you lot trampling about and destroying evidence it’s a wonder any of you graduated from police school or whatever you call it you’re all a bunch of incompetent fools now show me the victim’s toenails that will indicate whether she was actually having an affair or whether it was all in the killer’s fervid imagination come on come on let’s go!”
“Pardon?” John said, rather more politely than he thought was warranted.
“Get the Glenn Gould recordings for me to perform to. Not the 1955 recording, the 1981 one, if your idiots here can manage that.”
“She – she says that she suspected before we left Prokuplje, but she wasn’t sure, didn’t say anything to me. She convinced that female guard – the one that looks like a tank – to buy her a pregnancy test, and it was positive. So they brought her back.”
“I have a case, and I need your help. I’ll be by in a hovercar in fifteen minutes.”
when I’m wearing a dance belt.”
Then Holmes froze and pulled away.
“You are kind, my friend.” Sherlock passed his long fingers through John’s hair, and John closed his eyes in pleasure. “I understand that you are concerned about the speed of our more… intimate relationship. You do not wish to even bear the thought of taking advantage. This is a sign of your good heart, and I thank you. And I recognize that I am feeling more vulnerable than I ever have before. But I know myself, and I know you – at least certain aspects of you. And since we have revealed ourselves to each other, I feel a strong desire to know you better; to know you completely. And for you to know me completely as well.”
“Aw.”
“I don’t understand any of this!” Maja wailed, but quietly. “I don’t understand why Pavlović doesn’t let us go home, doesn’t let you go home, doesn’t call the embassy for you. Why they take me away? Why did we need to do such dangerous things to get out?”
It was perfect. Sherlock’s own cock was bobbing against his belly, and he reached down to stroke it, relieve the pressure. His whole body was awake with pleasure, sparking electric shocks up and down the surface of his skin.
“If you’re worried about the morgue study, I’m sure Dunworthy will talk to the funder.” Bahdri’s tone gentled a bit. “I know you don’t like leaving a job unfinished, John.”
Xiándì = my virtuous younger brother
Then he turned and stalked to his room, slamming the door.
Sherlock closed his eyes, swallowed back his nausea. “I – I tried to get out. Today. Window in the shower room. I couldn’t get far-”
; all his organs are reversed in his body, do you see? And I’m trying to demonstrate to Inspector Gregson that the murderer knew that.”
“You distracted me. And I say second bedroom, but it’s really a rehearsal space.”
“Ahbababababa!”
“John, wake up. I need you to wake up, mate.”
“I will.”
After a moment’s thought, he tore one of the buttons from his coat and placed it under the large rock.
Her mouth twisted, grinning at herself. “Do you think he’d ever consider…?”
“John?” he said. “What’s wrong?”
“Long enough to call it a career. Long enough to get a pension when I got shot.”
“Come and sit. Let’s have tea and you can tell me everything about your glittering career.”
“Yes.”
“Do you like winter, Sherlock?” John said, hypnotized by white snow in black hair.
“Good heavens,” she said, squinting a bit. “What are the media here for?”
His mind was still spinning in confusion, but Sherlock chose his words carefully; he didn’t want to confirm with Maja if she was fishing for answers. “Why do you think he’s MI6?”
Sherlock took John’s jacket off and hung it over top of his own. Then he raised his hands to John’s neck, and insinuated a long finger behind the knot of his tie. John closed his eyes briefly at the sound of the silk unwrapping at his neck, then reached up to pull off Sherlock’s cravat.
Heavy snow blanketed the streets and trimmed the tree branches with lace. Rosie’s cheeks were living up to her name, and every flake that landed on her face made her laugh again.
“Oh, no problem,” John muttered. He took a slug of whisky, then cleared his throat. Cleared it again.
“Of course.”
“You lit up whenever you talked about him. He’s clearly a clever man, and you admire clever people, but it’s more than that. You love him.”
“It was surprisingly difficult. I had to call two or three inns, and only found the one room.”
Water from the shower poured down their bodies, washing Sherlock’s hair into his face, and he pushed it back. Tiny droplets found their way through Sherlock’s lips and into his mouth, mixing with the salty precum from John on his tongue. Sherlock opened his throat and let the taste slide to the back of his soft palate.

(See the end of the chapter for
You know this. Just tell him.
“I can’t even get through.”
He shook himself, forced himself to focus.
Quietly and carefully, Mycroft walked towards his brother and sat on the floor next to him. Sherlock was rocking gently from side to side, whispering “Good girl.”
" He pulled aside a tapestry to reveal a vidder system built into the wall, pressed a button and threw himself into a chair. He sighed again as Mycroft’s face appeared on the screen.
“Seems to me that you’re bein’ awful rude to a fella who just solved a murder for you,” John said, his voice turning iron to ice. “Seems to me like you need to start bein’ a little nicer, or you might find yourself in need of one of these dentists.”
“-when a case is over.” Sherlock held up the paper, shaped as a tiny elephant. “It’s over, John. It’s all over.”
“All right. Take a jumper, it’s cold out.”
“And you fascinate me,” Sherlock said. “From the moment I met you, you have fascinated me.”
Oh. My. God.
Jim’s hands began to stroke up and down Sherlock’s hips and flanks. “You’re mine now, Sherlock, dear. And I’m a private man, I told you. And I’m possessive of my things.”
“Take a cab.”
John blinked a few times, then sighed. “Bring coffee.” He turned away from the screen, scratching, and broke the connection.
There was a scramble, and people running, and Sherlock heard none of it, caught up in John’s eyes.
John considered. The tale that Hope had related at the Yard was epic and strange, and John wasn’t sure if he’d believe it if he’d read it in a book.
“It’s so important that art creates a window into the soul,” the guy says.
“But I’m TA for Professor Hierlihy, and I have to mark his second year’s midterms and get them back by Feb first, and I’m defending my thesis on April 15 and I’ve got to-”
“Gracious,” Mrs. Roshni said. “What was all that about?”
“What?”
Here's how it is: Sherlock gets gussied up, Juliet goes off script, John learns more than he ever wanted to about puke, and asks a question that embarrasses them both.
John slumped, his whole body collapsing. The guards stepped forward to support him. One produced a key and unlocked John’s handcuffs, and his arms fell limply by his sides. Mycroft extended his hand to shake, and it was clearly an effort for John to return the gesture.
He listened, and grinned.
He wondered if he was dreaming as he placed the cup against Rosie’s mouth. She drank slowly and solemnly, and he imagined that he could hear the cells in her body sighing in gratitude for the milk. Then he fed her soup and tiny pieces of the bread. From the corner of his eye he saw the cook wipe at her eyes and turn away.
John pursed his mouth in a way that the cameras would read as irritation, but Sherlock knew was just for show. He wanted to kiss that pouting lip, to hold it carefully between his teeth. He hid his rising affection with a bark of, “Hurry up!”
Sherlock shifted, moving even closer to John, then froze. He pulled away slightly and whispered, “Mrs. Hudson.” Only then did John hear her footsteps on the stairs.
He kissed the scar softly and slowly, hoping John would absorb through his marred skin everything that Sherlock was feeling. John’s hands carded through his hair, and Sherlock looked up at John to see blue eyes filled with love and desire.
The song John dances to is "Little Lion Man" by Mumford and Sons.
John was surprised that Sherlock had come. There had been a flyer with the date on Mrs. Hudson’s fridge, and perhaps Mrs. Hudson had told him about it, but she had already been and gone. It was quite possible that Sherlock had simply figured it out by the shoes John had put on that morning. John wasn’t surprised by such deductions any more – he had just thought Sherlock didn’t care enough about the whole thing to come.
“What?” John says. Now
Votre nom, s’il vous plaît? - Your name please?
“I – In the past,” I say, (what are you doing? Don’t say that, he’ll think you’re a complete slag, don’t say it) “in the past I wasn’t one for taking it slow. But I’m trying to, you know, take it slow.”
“Ain’t so bad yourself,” John replied.
Sherlock snapped the music off. Silence rang through the studio as they stared at each other.
“Ah well. We must make sacrifices.”
Xiexie  = thank you
“Yeah?”
Third, and most terrible to contemplate, would be that Sherlock would give in to his weakness, his addiction. Cocaine in the Victorian era was not an exact science, no matter how careful Sherlock was, and if he was angry and upset at John for abandoning him, he might not be careful. He had said ‘a seven percent solution’ – that was enough cocaine to kill a strong man.
‘We’. That’s interesting.
Holmes held up his hand, and John stopped in surprise.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock said.
Sherlock sighed. “There’s no baby, John. There never was. She admitted as part of her confession that she had taken a drug during the time she was away to simulate pregnancy – make her breasts swell and so forth. She wanted… more leverage against you, wanted another reason for you to trust her.”
“I believe Mr. John Garrideb has come to call,” Holmes murmured.
Inara graciously tilted her head, and sat back with a sigh of relief as Sherlock warmed the pot. “You’ve grown into your beauty,
Sherlock was getting more and more frazzled as time went on. He no longer said anything about the case being wrapped up quickly. He muttered under his breath as he worked, sometimes in English, sometimes Mandarin, sometimes a language that John couldn’t recognize. His hair was an unholy mess as he pulled at it. Despite John’s efforts to keep him fed, the weight dropped off him, and dark circles appeared under his eyes. John could sometimes convince him to lie down on the hotel bed, but he doubted Sherlock stayed down for long, certainly not long enough for the deep sleep he needed.
“I’m just,” John said, rubbing his hand through his hair, “just not used to that.”
“I can’t believe you’ve called me out about a
As they rode up the elevator, John said, “Are you going to let me have some peace this evening, or are you going to play your goddamn music all night again?”
“No, that was James. I was deep undercover here, procuring information and data, to get over the border. James was a courier, and, I guess, so were you.”
Warning for Sherlock being a less than perfect, yet very human, parent; but he and Rosie come to an understanding.
And so, the following Sunday, the collection of judges was seated with their drinks of choice in the lounge, and John and Sherlock were standing awkwardly in the doorway of the kitchen. (Sherlock had drawn the line at personalized aprons, and John was secretly relieved.)
“Especially Christmas. I was in The Nutcracker every year between ages five and eleven.”
As they walked through the lobby, Sherlock noticed a number of men, all still wearing their hats, standing in the entrance of a small room. The men all looked up at their little group, and, nearly as one, nodded and went back to talking quietly amongst themselves. As they passed the small room, Sherlock caught a glimpse of two men sitting at desks, with headphones and watching several screens.
“Staircase with structural damage?” he said.

John looked small and pinched, sitting on the sofa, and it was
“But John is just doctor! Not even great doctor, just okay.”

“Good. They cost twice as much at Valentine’s anyway, and I don’t care for them.”

“Daddy,” Rosie said.
“Or what? Will you shoot me in the street? There’s quite a few witnesses around now, haven’t you noticed?”
I get a text back, just a minute later.
“Will you excuse us, Gemma?” John said. “Ask Joni to fetch me if Rosie fusses.” He took a firm grasp of Sherlock’s sleeve, nearly yanking him away.
Mycroft glanced to his right and said, “Ready?”
“That’s why I married him.”
John smiled and shook his head ruefully as Sherlock approached. “Shoulda known you’d be at a shindig like this.”
The woman nodded towards the store. “Anything left in there?”
“Oop,” he said, as he nearly went completely under the water.
He stared at her, unable to speak
“Sir?”
,” he said. “You don’t know, and you came for me anyway. My God.”
“Me as well. I’ve had this place built to my specification. That’s a neutron microscope over there, and – oh, this, this is the latest thing, an iso-betrometer. I invested in the inventor, and this is the first model.”
The guard rolled his eyes and gestured to the door.
“John, you’re going to get your head taken off by a bus if you’re not careful,” Mrs. Hudson said.
“Pavlović came back, probably to check on us. Possibly even to take me away to another location. It would have only been a matter of moments until he came up to the flat and found we were gone. John went back to stall him.”
“Your defense will take about fifteen minutes, I think. It’s a solid thesis, your committee will pass you. In fact, Mackleroy told me that he’ll recommend it for publication by the Oxford University Press.”
John’s pencil stilled. Sherlock’s head turned slightly, and John realized that Sherlock believed that John was finished with his drawing. John glanced down – the sketch was finished, as much as a preliminary sketch could be finished. He turned the page. Sherlock nodded slightly, and turned around.
“It’s only once a year, Sherlock,” John grinned.
The dust clears from the metaphorical piano I’ve thrown in the middle of the room, and Sherlock is blinking rapidly. John shakes his head a little, his expression a little sad.
“Millie?” Sherlock’s guide called as she led them to the tables. Another woman (
John came home from the session to find Sherlock engrossed in an experiment in the kitchen, Rosie happily playing in her pen, and an empty picture frame on the coffee table.
Warnings for brief description of period-typical homophobia, and period-typical child abuse, happening in the past.
“Think I’m off baths for a bit,” John said.
Then he saw Sherlock – or rather, just his head. Coming from the side of the observation window. Parallel to the floor.
long eyelashes.
The following Sunday found the judges gathered once again in the lounge, looking solemn. (John didn’t know, but Sherlock suspected that Molly had lectured Lestrade rather harshly for laughing at Sherlock, so he was overcompensating now.) Mrs Turner had returned, but even John noticed that she was choosing to sit very near Lestrade and still kept a wary eye on Sherlock.
“And I know you love a challenge.”
“I very much doubt that.” There was no way he would tell Sherlock that his teacher had mistaken him for a professional model. There’d be no living with the vain git.
“Well, yes.”
His brows knotted in confusion as John barged into the room.
It was midnight, and for the first time in his life, Sherlock didn’t want to be on a case.
“Where are you, William?” Mrs Holmes said, a bit crossly. “You haven’t been to see me in ages and ages.”
As John looked up, Sherlock was already moving from one side of the window to the other, backwards, pulling on imaginary oars, and clearly enjoying the sights of Henley-on-Thames.
Greg got a sinking feeling in his stomach. “What did he do?”
Sherlock gave a smile, it was a weak one, but the best he could do. The gate opened, and Pavlović released his grip on Sherlock’s arm. After a second of hesitation, Maja did as well.
"I had it fixed and polished, but you will still need to wind it daily."
“Simple,” Holmes replied. “The messenger boy from the Yard is small for his age and can’t reach the bell. So he knocked.”
He looks at me, grins sheepishly. “I guess it didn’t come up the other day, did it?”
I'm so grateful to everyone who's been reading and commenting and stuck with this story through the angst-y parts. It's a steady climb from here.
“Good. So that means that the thief picked up this dirt on their shoe only the day before the robbery, giving us a fair idea of his whereabouts. Anything else?”
“It is, though. It
John sat on the very edge of the seat, looking uncomfortable and uneasy. Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled one of the overstuffed chairs opposite him. “Let me see.”
The band leader was winding his way through the crowd, ringing the tiny bells, grinning madly. The band itself was vamping dramatically, trembling on notes intended to increase anticipation.
“I give credit to his bravado, although it may well have been denial of the seriousness of the situation.”
“Um – Sherlock Holmes or John Watson?” I say, sounding like the great intellect I am.
“Yeah.”
John blinked. “No,” he said, confusion marring his face.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, as though he were surprised by his own answer. “I had thought that this would be – terribly awkward. But now that I am here, and you are so close, I find myself at ease – well, in certain respects.”
Her eyes went small and cold. “You have no idea what you stole, do you? That was some high level plans. We couldn’t get you anymore, you were out of the country and protected by your brother’s influence, but we figured out your contact, and from there we hoped to get to the rest of the lot. All the clues led to John being the next big fish, but we needed confirmation. That’s where I came in.” She smiled, but there was no life, no joy in it. “And besides, the job wasn’t too bad. He’s a pretty good lay. I was hoping for pillow talk, but…”
But never let it be said that Sherlock Holmes backed down from a challenge.
“We’re in luck,” Sherlock said. “Apparently there’s not just an ensuite, there’s a good sized tub as well. You can have a bath, warm up.”
“Don’t forget to call your sister in the morning,” Sherlock says into my hair.
chicken kiev, Sherlock,” said Mary.
But all he could see was the needle filled with the cloudy liquid, just a hair’s breadth from the delicate veins of Holmes’ arm, only a moment away from the liquid mixing in with his blood.
“Yeah. Well.”
Baker Street was unrecognizable. Rubble covered the pavement and road, glittering with glass. The wall of the building opposite swayed dangerously, its foundations damaged by the blast. Cars that had been parked were so covered with dust and damaged by flying bricks that they were nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the debris on the street. There were a couple of cars in the middle of the street, their doors open and hanging. The sky was a dull gray, as though full of dust rather than impending rain.
The man was full of restless, kinetic energy in a way that jarred with John’s perception of contemps of this era. His fingers fluttered over the riding crop, he talked a mile a minute, but his grey eyes were clear and steady.
Sherlock looked up and saw that John was right, the docks were not far off at all. Either his mind had been deceiving him as he swam, or they had drifted closer while Sherlock rested.
,” she responded. No hint of a welcoming smile touched her face. She half turned behind her, not taking her eyes off Sherlock, and said softly, “
In the morning, they gathered enough small rocks to create a small circle about a foot in diameter, with a larger rock in the centre. It was an old trail signal that he and Mycroft had used as children, tracking through the estate in Sussex. It meant ‘I have gone home’.
He opened his mouth to tell her but the information was lost. He shook his head.
“Oh God, I – hahaha – are you all – haha – all right? Are you-”
I just nod, dumbly.
Sherlock saw Lestrade sit in the chair opposite in his peripheral vision. Lestrade looked creased and worn; Sherlock dully observed that he probably hadn’t slept since hearing the news of the bombing.
The net shimmered, and Marie appeared, with Colin beside her. At first John thought that the net was still working on her, then he realized that she was wearing a glittering evening gown. The sequins on the gown flickered as she pounded on Colin’s arm and shoulder while sputtering a stream of expletive laden French.
The old flat had a chill in the air – John had turned down the heat since no one was there. Not quite cold enough to see his breath in the sitting room, but enough that he had to rub his hands together to warm them before he took up the pen to sign the sales papers.
Sherlock had told Jim he would come to him in a week. He put his case notes into a box and sealed it, but otherwise packed nothing. A few of his remaining clients called, no doubt asking for one final visit to say goodbye, but he didn’t answer. Eventually the calls stopped.
They sat across the table, comfortably quiet, eating from the petri dishes, as the city came to life outside.
“Quite right,” Lestrade said. “Do you need medical assistance, Doctor Watson?”
(See the end of the chapter for
,” John said.
One chapter left!
Sherlock looked at John in his chair, and his face was briefly softer and perhaps a little anxious, then turned to the door and locked it.
“Avoiding what?” John says quietly.
Abstinence is boring. Grief is boring. Healing is boring.
John was sure he wasn’t imagining the spark in Holmes’ eye as John clambered in, and he jumped in after him with an energy surpassing any he had displayed so far.
John nodded and smiled, then stood and took off his own clothes. He took his time; no first-time desperation now, not even the usual post-case adrenaline. Shirt, trousers, socks, and pants one by one came off and puddled on the floor, John gradually revealing his body as if to say, ‘You are the only person I can be vulnerable with, just as I am the only person for you.’
“Right, thank you,” Sherlock said. He made a quick gesture, eyes closed, then looked back up at John expectantly.
I sit on the sofa feeling completely off-guard and dishevelled. There’s a murmured, hissing conversation at the door. At one point I hear this deep, undoubtedly male voice say, “But it’s a
“Good morning, Watson,” Sherlock said, nodding solemnly.
“I have a life back home. A flat. A career. Actually, I’m supposed to be in Tokyo right now, rehearsing for
“I know, I sent Hopkins to get it back.”
But then his fingers find it, the small rectangle, its sharp corners incongruous in his wet pocket.  He pulls it out, the damp flannel of his shirt dragging on it. He wants to say so much, but his brain is still slow, waterlogged. But he has to -
“Excellent. Don’t worry too much about that transition into scene three, you nailed it at the dress.”
JOHN:  So we put this together for you, for everyone out there who’s also isolating, for your amusement.
Then John walked away and disappeared into the crowds of people starting their day.
“There was never anything else for me,” Sherlock said. “This is it. I didn’t want to do anything else. I,” Sherlock’s eyes cut to the camera, “I did some ...other things, as a favour, but I never wanted to do anything else but dance. Everything else is just a distraction.”
“I have clearly been sent here to dance, to prepare for the performance I’m to give as the price of my freedom. You’re here, but you’ve already made it clear that you’re not here to guard me, or babysit me; besides which there’s the lunk outside the door doing that already. So. Why are you here?”
“Think, Pavlović. Right now your superiors don’t know about this operation, and they don’t know it’s failed. But depending on what you do in the next thirty seconds, you’re either a failure, or a hero. Choose wisely.”
publicity.”
“Baby?” said the woman.
JOHN: [Suppressing a giggle] What do you think Facebook Live means?
Sherlock’s brows knotted, but he followed. “What do you mean?”
“Not that it wasn’t good, just that… not as good.”
“My friends and I are looking for food, but we’re not going to take your food. That’s yours, okay?”
screamed the other man, and ran toward them, knife raised.
“You’re MI6?” Sherlock said. “You - you weren’t the man I met.”
Sherlock spent the next two hours in restless impatience. What if Maja refused to go? This was her home, her birthplace. What if they were caught? What if one of them was injured in the admittedly enormous physical risk in the escape? What if they got to the embassy but the gates wouldn’t open?
“Well, Mr. Holmes, I most certainly agree with your hypothesis – there must have been a third person shooting. The writer of these letters must have shot from outside the window, wounding poor Mrs. Cubitt and killing Mr. Cubitt. But how can we ever discover the whereabouts of the man? I assume it is the man named here, Abe Slane?”
“I know. What did you do?”
“Got it.”
“You surprise me, Doctor Watson,” Holmes said.
“We’ll be in contact shortly,” John said, rising with Cubitt and shaking his hand. He tilted his head towards Holmes and said, “He simply needs time to… think.”
Sherlock smoothed the lapels of his velvet jacket and picked off an invisible piece of dust as the bell rang. He smiled warmly as the door slid open.
John blinked and then the handcuffs were on the cabbie’s wrist with a metallic
“It’s all right, John,” Sherlock said quietly, and his hands moved again. “You have nothing to be embarrassed about your voice, John, it’s quite nice. Tenor.”
Sherlock blinked at her voice, the difference in pronunciations of the vowels. “You’re – American?”
I walk back into the sitting room, feeling a little like I’ve been hit between the eyes with a large plank. John reaches out to me and guides me onto the sofa.
John took a breath, tried to remember how full sentences worked. “The water. In the bath. Is green.”
John was gentle but not so gentle as to make Sherlock impatient. Soon he had three fingers knuckle deep inside, and Sherlock’s hands were scrabbling at John’s shoulders. He pulled at John until John was forced to pull his hand away, then rolled back on top of Sherlock’s body again.
“That man - oh, I hate this time of year. I only asked him if he was looking for a scarf for his girlfriend, and he said ‘Boyfriend’, and I said, ‘Oh, sorry, there’s some nice men’s scarves here’ and then he started to say the most awful things.”
“Um. Well, the Islands, the Beaches. But this big one, High Park, has a couple of them, it’s huge. They also have a Shakespeare play there every summer, at an outdoor theatre.”
“That’s why you’re good at the decorations,” Sherlock said with dawning realization. “Make them nice for her.”
Udobno vam je? - You are comfortable?
“What’s going on?” he said.
“He just gets – look, you have every right to be pissed at me. I’ve no right to expect it, but may I call you tomorrow? Take you out for dinner, make it up to you? Have a proper date?”
“Nothing.”
John’s housecoat had fallen open, and Sherlock could see a scattering of cinnamon coloured hair, freckled skin, and the edge of the gauze covering John’s stitches. A moment of hesitation, and Sherlock slid his hand between the lapels, laying his palm on the gauze, over the wound below.
Janina crossed to Sherlock and slid her hand into the crook of his arm. “I think I lost in you in the modern art section.”
“Well, do you know where Toby is?”
“Message for you, Mr. Holmes,” she said.
Holmes only arched an eyebrow at John, then turned to open the door as the bell rang. “Come up, come up,” he bellowed down the stairs. “Don’t bother Mrs. Hudson, but come up!”
Jim rolled his eyes. “Come on now. I don’t feel like performing for the vidders, we’ll go inside and-”
“It’s the Great British Bake Off,” Mrs Hudson explained. “I watch it every year. This is the Christmas special, so there’s celebrities on as well.”
For a moment.
“I didn’t know you danced.”
Sherlock held out the origami monkey he’d made. “Want this one?”
“Pardon, dear?” said Mrs Hudson.
As I’m falling asleep, I wonder how the flatmate knew where John was.
“Oh my God,” Mrs. Roshni said.
Sherlock hummed to let him know he was listening. He didn’t want to hear, but he was listening.
“You wouldn’t?”
Suddenly Sherlock straightened and glanced around the room at the other students’ displays, then back to John’s. His brow knotted, and he turned, almost accusingly, to John. John was struck dumb by the look of confusion on Sherlock’s face, unusual and unfamiliar.
Holmes was frozen in place, his eyes flicking from the ducks to the swans. “Say that again, Doctor.”
“John-”
“Too dangerous.”
“Very, and yourself? And your mother?”
“They’re worth about twenty five thousand pounds each, and two have gone missing already, so it’s not like he can run down to the pet shop and get another.”
The Director subtly shifted to an unobtrusive corner of the room as Sherlock’s head rose at the sound of Mycroft’s voice.
He heard the musical cue for Florence to re-enter, wearing the death mask, and for the set lift away to reveal the night scene of bohemian Paris.  From here it was easy: the harness lowered him to the ground on Florence’s command, and she removed the skull mask and placed it on his face. Then a slow walk through the set as the music climaxed.
“Excellent.”
“My idea was to distract him, to keep him away from the flat long enough to allow you two to get well away. I think one of the guards could see that something was wrong upstairs, he kept trying to get Pavlović’s attention, but Pavlović kept waving him off. I should be grateful to Pavlović’s ego, I suppose.
The singlet followed the plaid shirt on the bench. Sherlock’s breath was momentarily taken away by the sight of a star-shaped bullet scar on John’s shoulder. John had mentioned being shot during his career as a soldier, in Kandahar, before he joined MI6; Sherlock assumed this was the wound that sent him back from Afghanistan. Seeing it now, the severity of it, he was grateful that John had made it back at all.
Merry Christmas everyone, and thank you for following along!
They both glanced down at the phone.
He rang off, and dialled Jerome, who picked up right away. “Heads up,” he panted into the phone. They were nearly clear of the crowd, and Bantam was starting to look backwards towards John. “Heading towards you and the café, dressed in black, name Michael Bantam.”
SHERLOCK: No. No one else. Fine with me.
“Had a feeling I’d find you here,” John said. He straightened, leaving his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders, to look out the window. “I got this feeling this is your favourite place to be on The Baker.”
“Chuckers” is the ballet equivalent of “break a leg”.
“Let’s have a chat,” one of the men said, and Sherlock found himself propelled into a darker corner of the alley.
At least these activities kept his mind away from the ever-present fear, from the constant stream of ‘what if’ that filled his head.
“Do you mean ‘flatmate’ in the sense of ‘the person I’m romantically attached to and live with and we’re in an open relationship but I just haven’t bothered to tell her yet’?”
“It will be a beautiful lab.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Chuckers.”
“Very perceptive,” Sherlock said. “Please, sit. You’ve travelled far to see me.”
“And over dinner,” Sherlock adds, pulling on his gloves, “we have a proposal we’d like to discuss.”
Groaning softly, Sherlock crawled out of the hedge. Maja was not in sight, and it was nearly morning. He straightened up, pulled a leaf out of his hair, and walked as quickly as he could manage towards the western boundary of the park.
“Hey,” John said, solicitous and murmuring, “hey, you all right?”
“As do I. Checkmate.”
It’s often danced with two men, which is AMAZING.
“And then you were here again,” Maja continued. “Pavlović let me know you were back, and we came up with this idea. We thought that you two would give yourselves away. I thought you knew each other, before, but you didn’t, did you? And you two started fucking
Let's walk noiselessly,
Sherlock looked at Yun over the rim of his teacup. “Of course,” he said, his voice pitching lower. “Only the best for you.”
They drifted back to the divan, falling back into each other’s arms. John kept his kisses sweet and mild for a minute, but then Sherlock opened his mouth slightly with a tiny vocalization that sounded like a request. John slid his tongue into that willing mouth, very gradually, exploring with care. Slowly, tentatively, Sherlock began to respond in kind.
“Take shelter immediately,” said the broadcaster.
“This is important, Sherlock,” John said. “Read it, please.”
“I’ll leave you to get settled, then,” Mycroft said.
“How…?”
“Daddy come pick me up?”
Relief and grief battled for room in his body. “Good. I – good. Thank you.”
Sherlock recounted his own flight through the park, and the tense standoff at the gate of the embassy. John was quiet while Sherlock told the story, and quiet for a long moment when he finished.
Sherlock groaned. A mere actor – these people were even bigger morons than he thought.
It took a moment, then her face registered with Sherlock. He remembered her ingratiating smile, her leaning on his arm, five years earlier.
The drums were primal and spare; the vocals simplistic at first, then developing into a staccato rhythm. Then the chorus broke into a powerful pulse, echoing a strong heartbeat, and the singer and the lyrics reflecting pure, raw emotion.
John stared at him, then laughed a bit and shook his head.
A line formed between Sherlock’s brows, the line that appeared when Sherlock was confused. Just as suddenly, it vanished.
Sherlock shrugged. “He’s passing clever.”
Holmes startled, but only a little. He made no attempt to hide the needle. “Ah, Watson. I see that your trip to Whittington Hospital was a success, but that the Underground did not agree with you.”
I must also admit that the thing about getting zoomed around the jacuzzi really happened to me.
“Do you think-” Cubitt began, only to be hushed into silence by Holmes.
John looked at his watch for the hundredth time that day. Time was moving like treacle, when he wanted it to race to 5:00pm, when he could meet Sherlock for dinner – and everything he hoped that meant.
