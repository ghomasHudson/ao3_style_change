He was blunt, but then he let out a breath and flinched. Cas was sad, which apparently was a step further from damnation, yet…
Dean peeks out the window, the sky is clear and as they are in the middle of nowhere, the stars are shining without the competition from the city lights. A feeling of nostalgia goes through him.
Cas seemed to swallow the words again. Then his eyes wandered to Dean's expression, who was firmly waiting. He inhaled air before continuing.
The TV screen is on with sounds and lights painting the room, but Dean isn't focused on the action there. His eyes stare at Cas' right hand grabbing a handful of popcorn while he still chews with his cheeks full… With his left hand Cas lightly scratches his beard, short but longer than he used to keep… It's such a simple gesture and so absently human that it captures all of Dean's attention. Cas is wearing a T-shirt, and his arms are exposed, legs sprawled on the edge of the bed, wearing jeans… It's Cas… Castiel. And yet it's a new version of him, without all the bells and whistles. An okay weird guy, a dorky little guy, a handsome guy and…
It's almost two in the morning, Dean still can't sleep, he remembers Ishim's words about curing Cas of his “human weakness” as he walked with an angel’s blade towards him… Cas' face, bruised, beaten, the blood running down... Dean wishes he had been the one who killed Ishim, he wishes he could have taken him with his bare hands... Ishim made him fear for Cas, once again Dean's heart couldn't contain itself, he could never choose to risk Cas’ life like that, if he was responsible for the death of the angel, his best friend, his… No. Dean takes a deep breath, turns over on the bed lying with his back completely pressed to the mattress, facing the ceiling for a few minutes, he needs to empty his head. Cas is recovering, Lily has given up on revenge, and Ishim is dead... Now they just need to find Kelly Kline, and hope that the
and with more intensity than Dean plans, because in fact he isn’t thinking too much in advance of his actions, he adds
Everyone is tired, but they agree with the directions. They say goodbye to the boys, Alex leaves a vegetarian lasagna in the fridge, to Dean's discomfort, but thanks to Donna he now has two pies and a box of donuts waiting for him in the kitchen.
Dean and Cas are in Dean's room. Dean stands beside the door he just closed, Cas is sitting on the bed, hands on his knees. For a moment of awkward silence, Cas just looks around with his apprehensive eyes. He is full of power, but he seems vulnerable and unprepared to face Dean alone. In his pocket, the ring that Amara handed him seems to weigh.
Sam smiles at Dean, knowing that the spoiled taco episode is an embarrassing memory for his brother.
They return to the road after the first stop. Dean is in a good mood, tapping his fingers lightly on the steering wheel, following the music.
Cas moves on the bed, with one arm over Dean's chest, with his leg also invading his personal space. Cas is not good with limits.
Sam smiles, nodding. Dean is really interested in keeping the dog, and didn't care much about cleaning up the mess that remained inside the Impala.
Dean speaks with his mouth full of the last piece of pizza he took, letting out a laugh that makes the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes appear.
She holds out her hand, in her palm is a silver ring, the material looks like it was taken from an angel blade, but it is circumscribed with a transparent stone.
Jack had just absorbed Chuck's powers, but it wasn't just that. He had encountered power before, his own when he was born as a Nephilim and a different power, acquired from another source, when he consumed Michael's grace. However, this new experience is different.
Cas wanted to argue that he never fully fixed what he destroyed when he tried to take on the role of God… That he could never repair the pain he caused Sam, and Dean… He couldn't forget his bruised face, the blood and the plea that he saw it in Dean's gaze when Naomi forced Castiel to hurt him… But, Castiel doesn't say any of that. He accepts Dean's forgiveness, because that's the only way for him to continue by his side, since he's already tried to punish himself for everything he couldn't change, only to witness Dean not giving up on him, fighting so he could go home... Dean asked for Cas, with words and with yearning, even when unspoken, and Cas can no longer deny himself choosing to be with Dean, it's what he wants, and exactly what he thinks he's not worthy anymore, after each one of his mistakes.
Dean appears with a mug of coffee, and Sam and Eileen are awakened by Jack. Some of the phones start to ring.
Castiel, less than five minutes ago, still felt that his body was firm and his mind would never escape the repeated moments of pain and suffering that seemed to be his only destiny. Now, however, he feels as powerful as he did not feel at least ten years ago. He manages to arch his wings again, they are intact and perfect. He missed the ease that his wings represented, but a part of him is in conflict, as he has not realized until now that he is no longer used to them being part of his identity today. Progressively in a still strange way, Castiel had become very similar to the humans he started to care for and live with.
Castiel looks at Dean and his eyes wander among the others with uncertainty. He then makes a movement to get up when Dean places his hand close to his chest without touching him, in a protective movement.
Castiel tilted his head, sure that flying to hell would be faster and more reliable than the terrible signal reception in hell, but he was already used to putting human procedure first without resistance.
When that night, after Castiel was rescued from the Empty, they gathered in the central room of the Bunker, Cas decided not to explain in detail the conversation between him and Amara. Although he assured them that they could trust her, at least for now. Don't misunderstand him, he would eventually share a more detailed report on this intriguing event, but for now, he felt that the conversation was tied to a personal decision, a choice, and Castiel felt he should keep it to himself until they have more confidence about what Chuck's departure meant.
Amara also knows that getting rid of Chuck's chains, of his script rehearsed so many times, won’t happen by magic, because when it always and always tells you that you can't be different, that nothing can change your destiny, it’s hard to see other possible paths. So she knows it isn't her duty to push anyone out of Chuck's story, it is something that everyone should pursue, if they want to. What she is going to offer is a possibility of something different, something that is unknown even to herself.
There is a moment of silence at the table, when the laughter of the two previous conversations, when Charlie commented on some absurd passage, which actually happened, from Chuck's books, ceased.
Sam is looking at Jack with some concern. Jack also sees Sam clearly for the first time. Sam keeps pains as deep as Dean's, hidden under so many layers, and yet he tries to maintain a tenderness on the surface that makes access to his positive emotions a little easier. However, he has buried himself so much that perhaps the youngest Winchester cannot identify all of his fractures, as well as his strength alone. They deserve more than the constant punishment they inflict on themselves for the mistakes they have made in the past.
Amara appears in his mind telling him that she wishes they had known each other before and maybe they had time for that when it was all over. Jack feels a kind of comfort, and even though there was no prior trust between them before he defeats Chuck, Jack knows that Amara is helping him to hold back that flow of power that wants to transform him.
she responds smiling. Then the noise of an argument starts to become audible, Crowley and Ketch seem to disagree.
In the past two months, with hunts virtually non-existent, hunters have been trying to rediscover their role in this new world. The younger ones took an important position in this transition, they were locating the new humans and trying to help them process this experience, although there was a lot of resistance because the enmity and the grudge did not disappear as easily as what happened with the non-human condition.
Sam says, taking the controller and stopping the image in which the end credits for that episode appear.
Dean and Charlie returned from the pizzeria with four different flavors and found the kitchen incredibly clean and ready to be messed up again. Now everyone is in the war room, after eating and drinking half of what they had bought.
And Dean seems to have it all figured out, he talks and points and his eyes sparkle like everything is already on its way. Castiel lets a smile break, thinking more movie nights with Dean will never cease to be a good idea, so he's on board, without Dean having to ask twice for help.
Jack cannot deny the sincerity recorded in Amara's speech. He nods this time, knowing he is not shirking responsibility and that he and his family still have a lot of work to do to make the world a better and safer place, but that may not include fighting bloodthirsty monsters or prevent a new type of Apocalypse annually.
Charlie's gesture is comfortable and makes Dean not pull his arm or step back. He's among friends… Charlie, Sam, Kevin and Cas… They were part of a family and would protect each other… And that went for everything, monsters or dramas, apparently
“They tell me amethyst is supposed to open my third eye,” she tells them. “But my third eye has always been open, so I guess I’ll never know if that’s bullshit, will I?”
"I'll help you remember." Castiel's tone is solid and sure, enough that Dean finally makes eye contact again. His lips twitch, the ghost of a smile, and there's a long moment where they just look at each other, captured in a private moment that words can't touch.
He and Meg don't have the chance to say anything before Dean replies, “I guess we'll have to see if they want to keep me around."
“A hero of old will be plagued by visions, and whispers like false prophets will fall at his ears…” she continues, the pace of her words quickening. “A righteous man will be haunted by secrets, and death will follow where he leads.”
He follows her to the door wordlessly, giving Kelly a wave as he walks past. Steve the cat blinks at him sleepily from the edge of her desk.
With his phone in hand, Dean is lying half on the bed, half off like he’d sat down and got tired of waiting. The Doc Martens are loose at his ankles and the shirt Cas had given him is riding up in the slightest above the waistband of his joggers, showing a slice of his stomach and the dip of his hipbone.
What Dean didn’t know is that he was already there, scribbled in the form of poetry, half hidden by a birthday card and a movie ticket. He’d written it one night when they’d stayed up so late on the phone talking that Dean had fallen asleep. He’d told him goodnight before hanging up, and Dean had mumbled his name with a contented sigh.
"I'm glad I'm the one who hit you with a door while you were throwing up in someone's bathroom. Would've sucked if we hadn't met."
“God, you’re hot when you try,” She sighs wistfully, ruffling his hair some and spraying him with cologne before he even has the chance to process what’s happening. She pats his cheek and ignores his coughing. “It’s too bad no one will notice when you're standing next to me.”
The way he goes back to digging his knife into the wood a little more vigorously than before tells that he's been holding onto this information for a while with no one to confide in. Dean doesn't come off like the type to spout deep, dark personal trauma often and the flustered look on his face confirms that. It makes Castiel's chest ache with sympathy. He considered his emotional wounds long since healed, his scars too light to see anymore. It was clear that Dean's wounds hadn't been given a chance to mend at all.
"I'll do it," Dean volunteers. His gaze shifts sheepishly between his friends. "It sounds kinda fun."
"You'll never guess who can't take his eyes off you," Meg raises her voice over the music. Lost in his trailing thoughts, Cas is brought back into his surroundings.
He lets himself relax, tears drying on his cheeks as his heart rate slows to match Dean’s. He tries so hard to say thank you, but still can’t seem to speak. What can he say that would make this any less mortifying? Anyone rarely sees him this vulnerable, and how is he to explain that he was somehow affected by a sideshow fortune teller’s parlor tricks and nonsensical ramblings?
Cas takes it, gripping onto the bowl with one hand and wiping off his face with the other. A deep, shuddering exhale pushes from his lungs and he prays it's over.
Meg isn't paying any mind to Castiel, her eyes on Dean. Her red painted lips twitch upwards and Cas just knows that she must be thinking this is the "look" she'd mentioned the day before. The eyebrow raise and nod towards Dean she offers him says that's exactly the case.
"Annnd, send." The biggest shit-eating grin plasters itself on her face. "Sober up, angel. We've got another party to go to tonight. If you can't get in those tight jeans of his, I call dibs."
Charlie does a little skip up to them. "Soooo, Dean was just telling me that he's never been to a fortune teller before, and the one here is great."
“Who told you that? Don’t you realize that we’re still young? You can’t change the fact you didn’t make plans
“Cas?” Dean’s voice calls out, but he couldn’t answer even if he wanted to. When Dean finds him, he immediately falls to his knees in front of him. “Cas? What’s wrong?”
"That's not the strangest thing, though. When I mentioned him to Anna, They told me not to use his real name. It felt
"Makes sense," Dean shrugs, and Castiel is thankful for his lack of prying. "We'll just take you to Meg's place, then. I'll call her in the car." He rises, holding out a hand to offer support.
"You think he found his me?" Meg asks as they watch their friends chugging post-battle water in the least polite way possible.
Anna laughs, but it’s lacking its usual sincerity. There’s something off about the energy in the room that wasn’t there at the beginning of their talk.
Meg makes a face, clearly confused, and Castiel doesn't have the time to stop her before she says, "You mean some
"I'll have to take your word for it," He chuckles as he carves shapes into the railing with his battered pocketknife.
this is more of a filler-ish cute lil chapter to fight the writer's block slowly invading my brain, but here it is anyway! enjoy some dean and cas bonding.
Just as she says this, a young, pretty redhead opens the door to the left of Kelly’s desk. Castiel never could figure out how the doctor managed to remain practically ageless, even as he changed drastically. But he knew better than to ask a lady her age and chalked it up to great genetics. He'd been a patient of Anna’s for as far back as he could remember. At the earliest, ten years of age; though he couldn't remember that far back very well. This was something he had been reassured was "common" for "someone with his condition,” but the sentiment didn’t exactly make him feel any better.
She pats her rounded stomach and gazes down at it affectionately. "He’s doing well. The doctors say he’s healthy. I can’t wait to meet him.”
yes, i did make michael and lucifer twins. then i was like wait. luci is going to be a she. because i can lmao.
He can feel Dean’s arms around him, keeping him still, keeping him safe. The type of hug that feels like the other person is physically putting every bit of their heart into it. A transfer of healing energy that only deep affection can bring.
"Ugh, you're such a square. Whatever, I'll just steal Dean from you, and he'll be my Prince Charming instead." She looks at him. "In like a comrade way, as I am still very much into the ladies."
It was true. Kelly had been a witness to some of Castiel’s worst days, but she'd never judged him. She’d always been a maternal source of comfort, even before discovering she was on her way to becoming a mother to a child of her own.
There was plenty Castiel was still unsure about, but what he did know was that something had changed today, all bad things aside.
Under normal circumstances, she's the only one who had ever seen Cas actually dance. There had been more than enough instances where her parents had gone off to a seedy dive bar for the night and they'd had some pop song blasting in her room, singing and jumping around like absolute fools. If you asked, though, they'd never fess up. Meg was a brazen badass and Castiel was her generally stoic counterpart, after all. Not the type by any means to know all the words to the entire Backstreets Back album.
Something else occurs to him, just as his phone goes off again. He pats frantically at his pockets. Shit. His brand new credit card was in there.
She's here, somewhere, getting another drink. The few she's already brought him are starting to sink into his borderline uncomfortably buzzing mind. He swears his ears have been ringing for a solid hour, but it's hard to tell over the din. He knows alcohol and his meds don't mix, but he took them hours ago, and he swore to Meg that he would try his best to let go for once. Even after all these years, he never can quite refuse her when she takes his hand and leads him into bad decisions masked as the promise of making memories.
Castiel isn’t sure what to do with someone seeking his approval, but it isn't unwelcome. "Sure," He says, unable to hide the way his lips twitch upwards. "Ruby, how much do we owe you?"
Meg doesn't ask who "They" are, because she already knows. She also knows Cas never withholds hearing Them from Anna, especially when it happens while he's with her, and that Anna never gets mad at him. It's clear the puzzle pieces aren't matching up in her mind either when their friends approach.
"Bye, Dean," Castiel slurs as he turns to walk away. "You're not as much of an asshole as people say you are."
A slow smile crosses Charlie’s face as she shifts her gaze between the two boys before she catches Castiel’s eyes and winks. She gives Stevie a nudge with her elbow and says, “Babe, why don’t we go discuss that D&D meeting we were talking about planning?”
He doesn’t even notice that they’ve begun to gravitate towards each other. Slowly. The pull is nearly palpable, nearly has a life of its own. He can feel his breath catch, his lashes fluttering as he tears his gaze away. He isn’t imagining it. Dean has leaned over, and he’s looking at Castiel’s lips in the same way Castiel had been looking at his.
The outfit she picked for him is the same as Dean's but in a color scheme of black, silver, and blue. But while Dean looks particularly dashing, Cas is sure that he looks at least mildly ridiculous. He avoids the mirror, running a hand through his hair and reaching for the boots that Meg had shoved into the bottom of the bag. They get hastily yanked on before he takes two steps at a time back downstairs, pulling the front door closed behind him and adjusting the hem of his shirt as he heads back down the front walk.
"No. If you met me and listened to the way I verbally emphasize my appreciation of the male physique, would you guess I also love women?"
He doesn’t mean for it to come out borderline sarcastic, but the lack of enthusiasm must amuse her because she laughs. “Yeah, you. You look lost. That’s my forte, honey. Offering a little guidance to those who need it.”
"Is it not true that our little warrior prince talks about women the way I talk about men? Like he's, I don't know, overcompensating for something?"
Castiel thinks women are works of art. To think otherwise would be lying to himself. But for all their exquisite soft curves and biting sharp edges, he never could quite reach the level of sexual attraction towards them expected from a boy his age.
i did not abandon this story, but i did have a month long manic episode + get distracted by reading five books (ps the six of crows duology and simon snow trilogy are SO GOOD). sorry i'm rolling up in here weeks later like it ain't no thing. anyway. the song for this chapter are i wanna be yours by the arctic monkeys & unwell by matchbox 20.
“That’s okay. I’d like to change that.” For what it’s worth, her confidence would be more likely to convince him if he weren’t such an unwavering skeptic. “Take my hands.”
"My mom died a couple of years ago," Dean says quietly. "My dad- our dad took it really hard, too. He's always been a drinker, y'know, but it just got worse. He leaves for days sometimes. On a bender, I guess. Comes home with cuts and bruises from fuck knows what. Didn't go over so well the last time I asked questions..." His face drops, eyes shifting at a clearly unpleasant memory before he makes himself perk back up. "Anyway, I get it. I mean, it's not the exact same, but... I get it."
“Alright, let’s go harass late night gas station workers.” She rolls all her windows down and turns her stereo all the way up before throwing her poor, abused old car into reverse.
Getting up is not as easy as Castiel had hoped. He sways in place, but Dean steadies him and guides him out the door and down the stairs. They almost make it, too, but the last step blurs out of focus, and he misses it completely. Dean manages to catch him with a patient and reassuring "almost there," and Castiel can only think about how he is much kinder than he was led to believe.
to notice, but it's getting increasingly more difficult to ignore the deep pull he feels towards Dean. The next message, however, wipes the smile right off his face.
"I see that," Dean laughs. "You coulda had me fooled, though, the way you were grinding on each other." His expression softens in the slightest. "But hey, how bad are we talkin' with your dad?"
Everyone acts as if that year never happened. It's an unspoken rule, just like how everyone knows not to mention his mother in the presence of his father.
Castiel's fingers itch to reach out and comfort him, to rest his hand over his friend's that is currently gripping the railing a little too hard. Instead, he places it gingerly on Dean's shoulder. There's a sudden halt in his knifework, a stiffness to his muscles like a frightened animal bristling under the watchful eye of a waiting predator. But then Dean takes a shaky breath and the tension bleeds from his skin just as fast as it had come.
Castiel rushes for the toilet behind him. Between his heaving insides, throbbing temples, and the utter embarrassment vomiting in front of a practical stranger, his eyes are stinging. This is enough to swear off any more parties for a while.
The table washed over with laughter, and no one ever really asked any questions after that. Charlie had set the stage for acceptance in their friend group when she'd introduced her girlfriend, Stevie, to everyone during Sophomore year. That aside, if anyone ever did say anything sideways, Meg would probably kick their ass.
Castiel thinks, an uninvited observation. The type of handsome that begs to be acknowledged, even in passing. The type of handsome that can only be logically paired with beautiful girls like Amanda.
“No.” Call it a side effect of a lifetime of questioning what was real and what wasn’t, but he wasn’t interested in self-inflicted paranoia from prophecies foretold by sideshow attractions. Some put a lot of faith into psychics, but he wasn’t one of them.
"I’m pre-daring you,” She directs at Castiel. “Time for that stud I’ve been trying to talk you into for years.”
For the first year of his life, his siblings were sent to live with their grandparents while Chuck mourned the loss of his wife by spending all his days writing and caring for infant Castiel alone.
Castiel moves to lean back against the headrest, watching Dean out of the corner of his eye. There's something so effortless about the way he turns the steering wheel one-handed and glances in his rearview mirror before reaching for the stereo dial. The engine rumbles below the tune of a mellow rock song that reaches out from the speakers and tells them:
"You'll see him tonight, you know that, right?” She slides the phone under her thigh and gives him one of her renowned bitch faces, locked and loaded with attitude. “If you want to talk to him so bad, why don't you text him and stop being a pussy?"
He pauses, fingers hovering over the screen. The urge to be thorough about this whole youthful rebellion thing is painfully strong, but he knows he shouldn't push it by saying something else flirtatious. So, he settles for something that could pass for friendly. At least, he thinks it does.
His lips. Every hello they spoke had become his favorite sound, every smile they formed had become his favorite sight, every laugh they’d uttered made him want more. He’d never let himself permission to want to kiss them. He does now. Even if it meant nothing, went nowhere. That was fine. He was happy just to be at Dean’s side, whatever that meant.
Pam is looking at him as if trying to read a language she doesn’t speak but could swear she recognizes a few words of. He wants to tell her that he doesn’t think she’s going to find what she’s looking for. He wants to get the fuck out of this room.
Meg looks entirely unsatisfied with that answer, but she bites back whatever she was going to say. Wise of her. She knows he’d tell her the truth when he wanted to. “Well, let’s get you home. Charlie had to go attend to her geek squad, but she told me to tell you both bye.”
"Hold up," Dean says, skirting around after him. He places a hand on Castiel's shoulder, spinning him around to face each other. "Am I missing something?"
Looking out onto the crowd, the sight of his best friend's mom happy-crying and his dad clapping justifies the feeling. He takes his diploma, shakes the principal's hand, and lets the bright lights of the gymnasium swallow him in the high.
Not that he'd ever admit it - for obvious reasons - but he'd always felt an inexplicable attraction towards the eldest Winchester boy from the moment he'd first laid eyes on him. It was far from romantic, or even particularly amiable, but he certainly didn't want to dive much deeper into analyzing it. So instead, he made it a point to be overtly standoffish every time they were forced to interact. Which, thankfully, was not often. He still remembers how taken off guard Dean was when they'd ended up gym partners once, and he told Castiel to "get his head in the game" only to be met with a clipped "bite me."
Soon, he'll have a car of his own to drive to his monthly office visits: a truly glorious gold 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V that Dean lovingly refers to as the "Pimpmobile" and Meg refers to as "fucking ugly."
"A black tee and those other dark blue jeans that fit just right. You've got thighs anyone would be glad to get crushed by, and I'm sick of you hiding them," She holds her hand up when Cas begins to protest and eyes the pile of shoes on her floor. "And you’re wearing the Docs I stole from my cousin's house."
Dean's hand retracts. "I don't want to go home. I'm kind of. I just. You-" He pauses, sucking in a sharp breath. "I thought we were friends, Cas?"
They pass through the makeshift marketplace where there are dozens of tents filled with everything from swords to custom dragon wings and everything in between. The people are friendly, the dirt walkways are bustling with life, and Meg is overjoyed to finally receive her greasy chicken on a stick. Dean doesn't leave Charlie's side, chattering away animatedly about the do's and don'ts of LARPing.
As much as Cas was tempted to push the matter, it was clear there was no room for discussion. So, he didn't discuss. He trusted his dad and actively avoided Dean socially from there on out.
Dressed and ready to pretend the interaction hadn’t happened for both of their sakes, he leads Dean downstairs through the side door in the kitchen before flipping on the light to the garage. His car sits in the middle, surrounded by odds and ends and the fake Christmas tree they’ve had for years. She’s still a beauty, Cas thinks, and she shines in the flickering fluorescent light.
Then, one day in Pontiac, Illinois after 4 months, an underground coffin rumbles with life. And like any movie with a circular ending, Castiel Novak gasps alive in a spit-filled choking moment.
And there is the immaculate man who is respected by all. Today he’s wearing a standard white button-up and charcoal black slacks. He knots a soft green tie that matches the brilliant jade hue of his eyes. His hair is perfectly combed and there’s not even a strand out of place. Freckles dot his face like a star map and a slight red hue graces his skin courtesy of the hot water.
It's a gravelly American voice but, with a curl of something foreign in the end. Cas is speaking, and Dean remembers belatedly that it’s the second time that they both are speaking to each other. A rough hand places itself over his shoulder tentatively and it’s suddenly an anchor that centres him.
Apparently, this demon came from the long legacies of villains who liked to monologue to their victims in order to crow over them as much as possible instead of stabbing and finishing the job quickly.
Moulded by Michal’s guidance, Daniel stoically faces his brother by command - holding corrupted Samuel at the end of his sword. Snivelling, Samuel pleads, asking for a second chance. He clutchs at Daniel’s soles while the elder watches, his resolve weakening by every second at the promises of God’s glory and family.
He rarely differs from his routine of waking up at 5 in the morning, groaning miserably from his alarm clock. As the light slowly seeps into his eyes, he turns to look at his wife. He kisses her on her temple and as usual, she tries to tug him back into the bed. But, he knows that it more for the sake of their small routine that they do than actually honest. Their life is in a perpetual loop, down to their very last intimate moments. Familiar is safe and that’s what Dean likes to stick to. Life is an instruction manual for them, and they refuse to throw it away, no matter the tears in it.
He marches slowly like an executioner to stand in front of the dreaded motel door. He raps twice quickly, as it is their code.
Warning for internalised homophobia, period typical homophobia, homophobic behaviour and minor Dean/Benny.
“Fuck you,” he gritted out. He was playing, both him and the demon knew. It was only a matter of time that he was gonna be sent back and it would make a very short movie of
Maybe it was simply a residue from being trussed up in hell as a hellhound’s chew toy for far too long that had him on the edge. Even then, there was nothing wrong with being cautious in this exchange.
Hope y'all enjoyed this chapter as much as I did writing it! Do leave me tons of comments and kudoes as they keep me going!
When the time comes, Daniel stands dutifully behind Micheal as Lucifer is upended with his followers alongside a once rebellious teenage Samuel. Once brothers, now were on the other side as promises of power forced everyone to choose sides.
And as his mind has started, it does not stop. It starts pulling him back to a time he doesn’t want to be in. His breath puffs and starts becoming shorter and shorter, his heart’s beating so fast that it feels like each beat is a full-body shudder.
Off-kilter, he reaches his arm out to steady himself. His palm touches the cold surface of the lamp post and the heat of his own hand burns against the contrasting feeling. It makes his body feel hot as the heat constantly burns in the corners where his clothes touch his bare skin. His body itches, he wants to escape the feeling. A fire builds against the same feeling and a slow scream tinges against his throat, it is unbearable - he wants to take off his clothes, he wants to feel free. It ignites something in the deepest core of him - he feels something inherently unholy near him. It creates a sticky feeling in his mouth like molasses, tasting like brunt charcoal, and now his screams drown into choking.
Barely managing a nod, Castiel continues with a grimacing smile. Slow steps on the concrete roads caused thudding sounds to bounce off into nothingness. The town around them is quiet, only broken by the sound of their footsteps or the buzzing neon lights which spluttered and choked until an unseen force or person shut them off as they crossed what seemed like the town diner.
Hallelujah, his coffee was done. Sniffing in the heady scent of the coffee, Dean immediately relaxed.
He squinted at the date trying to figure out how long it had exactly been. Though the maths came slow, his heart dropped when he looked at it.
, God creates the Heaven out of nothingness that had been lazily swirling up until then. The Universe is lovingly crafted by the hands of God, pulling, stretching and crafting life out of darkness - writing a story to span across years, centuries coming down to a climatic fight between two sons of God - brother against brother.
But, rather than comforting him, it just made him guilty. Heck, how long had it been that he’s even been to a family dinner? He should probably call his folks soon and let them know that he’d be over for Saturday night dinner. He would probably be ribbed and scolded for being inattentive.
There’s no watch in the car to measure time, but, he counts it in his own heartbeats. He hums along with the songs whenever he recognizes the tune, wonders about Stanford and to some extent, how Claire was. He made fantasies about dropping by her boarding school and surprising her with something from Hot Tropical or whatever that shop she liked. He wonders if she’s still the angsty teenager he saw the last time. He kids that it’s just another drive back home from work but, the drive lasts far too long to pretend so or that the even in the care-free musings, an undercurrent of tension. He could only hope that his siblings would be fine when he reached them, he possibly couldn’t survive again watching Gabriel’s doped out face or Anna bleeding out because of her freaky psychic powers.
It’s a very old memory, blurry around the edges and hazy. Dean Smith is not the polished middle-aged man who lives near a neighbour whom he hates. Instead, he’s a teenager, young and cheeky, still living in his parents' house with his sister Jo. His best friend is Sam Wesson but he's more of a brother. He’s been having an off-on relationship with Lisa Braeden a few streets over but, right now it’s off time.
Castiel doesn’t believe in dementors but, he believes in his inner demons - and it’s this memory that he uses to in his darkest time - feeling that same comfort of leaning against Gabriel while his brother’s fingers drum against his shoulder. He remembers the disembodied voice of himself telling Gabriel how he was gonna protect his older brother against all the bullies that had bashed in his nose that weekend. And Gabriel weary chuckle and patting his head with loving indulgence.
Daniel is slowly handed the newest creation - God stands back as a proud father looking first at the two, tiny angels in front of him and then the rows of others behind him - all of them breathless, silent, waiting for his words to boom again.
And from there came blue. Dean winces from the pain and presses his eyes shut. As a breath tears away from his collapsing lung, he sees blue again.
Hope y'all enjoyed it! And well how have y'all been? Hopefully good. Sooo, for the last chapter, it was supposed to be named "Call Me By Our Name" (because "our" not "your" because communism, hahaha). But, my sleep-addled mind typoed it. So, to remedy it, I named this chapter "Love, Your Favourite Communist" (Because "Love, Simon" )
For most of his life, all that Castiel has known is prayer. Long before, Kali and Jimmy happened when his father was still lucid and the shadows of his aunt had not darkened their doorstep - Charles “Chuck” Novak, his father had been a pastor. It’s a very faint memory and Castiel hardly remembers any of it visually. But, what he remembers is sitting on the hard bench of the church until it’s digging in deep and flattening his butt, a thick smell of cloying incense that surrounded him as a perpetual smell of home and duty and the soothing voice of his father worshipful and guiding his flock in the name of God.
had just opened the door and looked down on the decimated remains of his pie. He had titled his head towards Dean as if he could understand the fact that Dean absolutely despised him and that bribing him wouldn’t work at all.
Maybe if Dean would have gotten some time to think during his storming up to his neighbours, maybe he would have stopped and turned his tail and just reported Cas. Maybe somewhere out there in an alternate universe, if those existed, Dean would have watched as the police had arrested Castiel and his friend for indecency, and then, he would have congratulated him on a job well done, a bullet dodged, and then, maybe he would have learnt to live in a confined life of family and white picket fence. Maybe in that universe, he ends up convincing Lisa to move away from a little far, and then after a few years a little more, maybe Ben gets another new sibling and maybe, just maybe Dean can force himself to be happy.
Having the story written, God puts down the first draft of all of the world and works to make the characters of the story to put it in place.
A glowing beam of light parts the crowd as would years later when Moses stands in front of the ocean leading his people. The angels at the edge draw back unable to understand what they see while the others press against those at the edge - basking, wanting for more of the light - because in that light they felt like God themselves. A blinding power in that light made everyone feel purer and reinforced their duty as the servants of Heaven, Man and God. Even the Archangels were in awe.
The door is open and Dean hadn’t even noticed it. He was shaking so badly at this point that he collapsed onto the floor. Everything started to swirl into one giant mess. His heartbeats were beginning to be so loud, that they were undertaking his every other sense.
He can hear someone screaming an unearthly wail and he realises that it’s him. He wants to stop screaming but he feels that he can't stop like it out of his control now. The screech is reaching levels that it’s making him lose his own hearing.
But, Dean Smith was known for being dangerous and reckless. They just needed to be a little careful.
gets replaced into weariness. This is a path, they’ve always gone down on, Gabriel and Anna would probably get angry at him for not being grateful for resurrecting him and he would have to deal with the consequences of their actions.
In the coming six days, God works hard on creating the Earth and everything that would go into it like a good old Lego set - the sky, the animals, the living and then the trees including the famous Garden of Eden with snakes, apples, the clueless humans and the works.
Lilith’s nasal voice whispered the thoughts cruelly in his head, breaking him down, word by word. His tongue tasted burnt, the air smelt burned and the cotton straps felt like marks of hell laid on his bare soul. Unable to hold any longer, he dropped the heavy bags which spilt its contents on the ground.
Dean’s breath involuntarily hitches and his hand trembles. It's not the angry kind of tremble but rather a nervous one. The man’s wearing low slung pyjamas and that’s all the details that he can gather. Cas is stretching his arms and yawning and Dean’s just stuck to a spot unable to move.
Also, I don't think that bisexuality was as known of a concept as homosexuality so, you'll have a lot of Dean trying to figure out if he's gay or straight but, he later comes to the realisation that he's bi. Not sure if that's a spoiler cause Destiel is endgame. I hope to make it a lovely journey of discovery, so we shall see about that!
It also doesn’t take much to break into the diner with its shoddy lock. On the counter lies a perfectly baked pie even though the owner probably had vacated the building long ago. But, feeling charitable, he leaves money on the counter - anyway, it’s not his, who cares.
Dean drops the note when he sees the last initial. The auto shop? He knew that Benny hated Winchester but, fooling inside the auto shop at night? Damn, that was dangerous.
A whooshing wind blows in the solitary street corner. It’s just the both of them on the road, the light haloes his head like an angel as he stares down on her. Despite the pain, he quickly slips on the charm as if it’s his second nature. He spares a pleasant smile towards her and just like that he’s back to being a cult leader’s son.
And on the last day, God takes a rest - he blesses and sanctifies the seventh day, which comes to be known as the Biblical Sabbath, when later the worshippers come together to pray for their souls for the Day of Judgement.
Well, the truth was that everything was so settled, everything that he did seemed like a part of the routine.
And then another, then multiple. The plants around him were dead, plastered to the now-barren ground. A grey-ish hue dominated the area, hanging like a Doomsday overcoat.
And there again is that painfully sweet voice. He ignores the alarm bells ringing in his mind alongside the cloying smell of something burned cloaking him. All of his senses screamed
I'm gonna start posting for this every 2 weeks as classes begin soon! Send me your comments and kudos - I always love to hear from you!
I might post the next chapter depending on whenever I get time to finish it - work is coming up soon - so I might have less time on my hands! Have a good day/night! :)
The tantalizing smell of pastry tickles his senses, he belatedly realizes that he hasn’t eaten anything. Just as soon as the thought takes place in his head, an animal-like hunger starts gnawing away in his stomach. And just like that, a dam bursts. It felt like someone was prying his innermost thoughts trying to break him apart mentally. It was getting harder to even move his legs - visions danced in front of his eyes - things he had done in hell.
The title is a mix of Pretty Woman and Anti-Capitalist which makes it Pretty Anti-Capitalist. (Yes, I have weird humour).
Now he’s here stuck in what seems like a wooden box, caging him in. He’s not dead certainly - as he presses his fingers against his chest feeling the soft exhales and inhales of his own self. Fingers slip past the buttons of his shirt and he slowly feels his own body heat warming the cold pads of his hands.
That train of thought ends abruptly as he shakes his head trying to distract himself. The lack of time on the road frustrates him to the point of sheer anger, the sun has dipped far below the horizon long ago and the night steadily drew it’s cold embrace closer.
He was sweating, shaking all over. He couldn’t hold himself up anymore and slumped against the nearest surface.
“Emanuelleeee Novak,” a sweet, singing song voice spoke “Out of the heat, straight into the frying pan? And that too with a pretty new body? Couldn’t even recognize you for a second, looking all manly like that. Makes me go all tingly in the right places.”
“Alright, alright,” he grumbles to his stomach, he’s too tired out to care that he sounds like a maniac “we’re gonna get you something to eat.”
When Dean sees blurry dirty blond on the figure's head and the British accent registers in his mind, he grins.
Gabriel runs off, unable to take sides, ripping his grace out of himself in a latent act of brotherhood. Some call it cowardice while others inwardly wish that they could have the ease of being able to turn human and not take part in the brewing war. However, none know what happens of the Archangel’s soul. Now devoid of its heavenly memories - it finds home as a brother to the Micheal Sword and himself the true vessel of Lucifer. In an act of cruel, Godly choice- Gabriel, the Archangel was born to an absent father, Chuck and a holier-than-thou mother, Naomi as Gabriel Abner Novak.
TW: Dead-naming, sort of traumatic flashbacks, swearing, death (and well, any sort of stuff you'd associate with SPN). Enjoy!
No matter how much he tries to hold on to the swirling blue of the skies and the eyes, he feels his body give out as duelling voices call out “Dean!”.
Dean Smith had primarily two points of contention in his life, one was his increasingly frightening urge to leave everything and then the second one lived next to him.
he had called it. And then Jimmy fucking disappeared, and here Castiel is now, trying to save everyone even if he’s supposed to be as dead as his own twin brother.
He can visibly hear her blush as she stutters over her words “I can drop you off at the end of the village Mister. I live there myself. If you can help me with my grocery bags and load them up in my car, we can get there faster Mister.
, it was just 4 months. Trying to wrap his mind around it, he tried to survey where he was. And then out of the corner of his eyes, he saw a tree stump.
As he dies, the only memory in his glazed eyes is that church memory while he mutters his father’s prayer, not in an attempt to call God, whom he has long forgotten about, but, just an unconscious reflex. Hellhounds rip him into shreds as the blood drains out of his body creating a central cesspool around his body. Castiel Novak dies on a grimy floor succeeded by his terrified siblings Gabriel and Anna facing demons.
Bright, harsh sunlight soon floods the remains of the coffin as Castiel claws his way out of it. Finding at hold in the loose soil was difficult but, as soon as he gets a grip - he boosts himself up to the solid ground.
But, it's too late when he comes to think about all of this. Contemplation was never Dean’s style, action and hasty decisions were somethings that he was better known for.
In a distant corner of his mind, he realized that it was the woman’s car. He hadn’t even seen the car, blurred by all the pain.
But, coming back to the scene at his window and back to his kitchen, Dean had another reason to wake up early to stare at his neighbour’s window, and that was to catch him at doing wrong so Dean could report him to the committee about something or the other. The window was angled at a way that it was only visible from Dean’s kitchen, it afforded some privacy he guessed.
Sorry for such a delayed chapter but, my life suddenly turned extremely busy that I had not time to post a chapter.
Everything is in place for the big bang of life in the world. God stands back proud of his creation. All the angels stand dutifully next to him, the eldest Archangels - Michael, Lucifer, Gabriel and Raphael followed by the others - the cherubs, the seraphs, the principalities and the ishims, submissively waiting for the word of God and for all that it is to follow. They have been promised different responsibilities, the miracle of life and the opportunity to be able to witness the climatic event of life, death and creation.
or whatever the fuck his name was, had said something that had made Dean made the first time that he’d been around to drop off some apple pie to fulfil his neighbourly duties and welcome the man into the neighbourhood. Words had been exchanged and Cassanova
It takes Dean a few moments to realize that Sam, Eileen and Jack have recovered better and now they all stare silently at their scene. Sam and Eileen exchange a slight smirk and a sigh of relief. Jack, on the other hand, smiles so wide that it doesn't even seem that the boy had passed through an Apocalypse after another, lost his own soul, devoured angels’s hearts, exploded in another dimension, lost everyone else on the planet, absorbed god's powers and returned home to rescue one of his dads, after eating all the cookies from the kitchen. Everything normal to the Winchester way of being.
Jack still doesn't have all the certainties in the world, or all the worlds, and a part of him believes that it is dangerous to count on it. Amara is stirred, she is in agreement with his thoughts. She is also holding more tightly to the power that belonged to Chuck, allowing Jack to have access to a few pieces, pieces that already want to burn his soul completely. He needs to be careful about what he demands and how he uses that power.
Miracle barks a little and leaves with its tail wagging towards a newly awakened Castiel. He's wearing Dean's pajamas with hot dog pants. Cas rubs his hands over his eyes, his hair clumsy. Miracle stretches to reach the waist of a surprised Castiel.
The door creaks and opens. Dean appears with a smile and some plastic bags in his hand, Sam beside him.
That morning Dean breathes and thinks that everything looks better than he could have imagined two months ago. That kitchen is full of noises, flavors, smells and people he cares about. The empty and lonely world that Dean has witnessed is a place that occupies only some of his bad dreams, but will never be part of his life again.
Sam is concerned, but of all them, he is the one who can best balance hope by considering the risks of failure.
He had already done something similar, not just once… The whole problem with Michael came from a deal in an attempt to save their family. Dean's shoulders sagged, he looked at Cas and a part of him split there, a part of him saw what Castiel had done as if he had made the decision himself. However, he couldn't be okay with it, he's seen this movie before and the ending wasn't a good thing.
Charlie calls out, trying to clear the mood as she taps a few fingers on the surface of the giant computer.
Castiel wants to make things right this time, and he needs to know that Dean doesn't doubt him anymore, and he knows, but still... They're taking small steps not knowing exactly which direction they're going, he thinks, but at least he feels that things are getting better.
Two days later Sam, after using his momentarily retired privileges as a hunter's leader, called an emergency meeting. In the Bunker, in addition to the current formation of the
Then Dean leans over to kiss Cas, the vulnerability of the moment holds their breath while Cas puts his hand on the back of Dean's neck. There is an unspoken intimacy there, and the assurance that they are well, that none of them will disappear as they close their eyes. The kiss ends and they move away a little.
Dean states. He won't let doubt slip through his mouth. He holds on to that little spark of possibility as if it were the only possible outcome.
Dean gives Jack a slight nod, who nods back confidently. Of course, he can't be absolutely sure of anything, but he saw enough in Amara to judge that her intentions were true.
Cas coughs a little, his voice hoarse and lower than Dean remembers, his blue eyes half open as if they had trouble looking directly into the light.
again, but it was clear that this is one of the underlying concerns. Cas continues to stare at him, waiting for some response, some complaint from Dean, but he just squints his gaze a little, he almost opens his mouth but reconsiders. They don't need to discuss this now, and Dean doesn't need to think about it right away. It was one of the reasons he left the bedroom, and not to be alone with himself.
Jack takes a deep breath, he shouldn't have known all that. He should not remember so many worlds and so many faces, and he touched only a thousandth of everything that he contains in himself. Amara understands better than any other being could. She and Chuck were always connected in a way, even when the connection between them seemed non-existent, because there was no other being who looked at the beginning of the world as they did. For humans, it is incomprehensible, on a certain level, to separate form from essence, but Amara and Chuck existed beyond any simple understanding of existence. Even if they die, the power they carry is eternal and the only way to keep everything created so far stable.
Dean gets up and decides that even if he needs to think about something else, he can still think about something else in Cas' company, after all, Cas isn't the problem... Not at all... Dean, on the other hand, has
Amara seems to catch those thoughts, which Castiel finds to be very invasive on her part. Her eyes open and shine with a certain satisfaction.
It is the same old Cas as before, now sitting in that chair that was empty and evident since when he sacrificed himself telling Dean that he loves him, and not only that, telling Dean why he loved him and why he was worth that sacrifice.
Dean leaves the kitchen quickly, they stare at each other for a brief moment until Dean returns with his jacket. The jacket which Cas had left his handprint on before he was sucked into the Empty, the last mark Castiel left on Earth is in Dean Winchester's hands.
Cas says as he sets the table on the floor. Sam went shopping, and only Dean and Cas stayed at the Bunker.
Dean's heart raced against his will. No, he wasn't the one who would make Cas truly happy… He meant, he could humor Cas, make him smile a few times, but "true happiness" felt like something big, too big to be just because of Dean... And it was something Cas thought he couldn't have, so... Nah. Sometimes Dean had this feeling that there was something more between them... Cas sure cares, they had a profound bond he said in the past... And once, when Cas was dying, he said "I love you... I love all of you."... For a moment Dean suspected that first "I love you." it was more to him than to anyone else in that barn… But, it couldn't be… And even if it did, there were many forms of love... Dean never said I love you, but he knew that…
Cas looked almost surprised, all the defenses he put up to get a fight right away, weren't prepared for that first, more toned reaction. He stuttered a little before regaining his voice.
The world has changed, and that change was still progressing. Who would have guessed that they would still have so many problems to solve? Not that it was an obligation, but it was kind of... The Winchesters didn't hide from the responsibilities they could assume. They still have work to do.
This time it is Jack who puts his hands on Amara's shoulders, his eyes lit up and the energy around the Garden begins to gravitate between them. Something very old, ancestral, wakes Jack and he feels that he is holding Amara, not the body in human form in front of him, but something purer. Somehow Jack knows that Amara is willing, she is allowing herself to appreciate humanity even with the flaws it carried. He sees the walks that Amara had taken in the last few years, how her eyes observed the fragility of life with a certain admiration and how she marveled at discovering new things that she was able to enjoy. That is the point of innocence that connected them.
And Castiel is again visible in the Bunker. Dean's voice calls out to him, his steps going towards him. Castiel thinks about debuting his new wings, but decides to remain petrified as he is. When Dean appears at the entrance, Castiel puts the ring in his trench coat pocket. He has to face some pending issues that seem almost from another life.
Jack is losing his mind because a part of him returned to feeling what is despair in his old human form.
They were uncomfortable for a while without saying anything else, Dean had a frown as Cas watched him from the corners of his eyes apprehensively.
She says gesturing to the rest of the Bunker. They are in the library, but Castiel knows they are invisible to the eyes of others, perhaps even Jack's.
Well, I intended to write only three chapters, but I ended up writing this one and I couldn't finish the last one.
Cas points to the image, a drawing of a great white shark with its teeth bared, sea creatures around it, and two small fish in the center.
Charlie says bluntly the moment after Dean puts the key in the Impala and starts driving to Lebanon's pizzeria. And he gasped, coughing dryly as if he hadn't seen it coming from her.
And before Cas could roll his eyes again, Dean gave him another kiss, enjoying the situation and the fact that Cas called him an idiot as a fact already so well known.
This time, however, Sam asked Dean to accompany him on this specific case, which was just a lame excuse. In fact, they just wanted to get Dean out of the Bunker so that Cas, Claire, Kaia, Jack, Donna, Jody, Patience and Alex can prepare a surprise party to celebrate his birthday. In order not to raise too many suspicions, Claire and Kaia arrived two days before, with the excuse that, in addition to missing them, they wanted a place to stay before continuing their trip across the country, the two are participating in the itinerant groups, while the other Sisters take care of the regional base of Sioux Falls.
Charlie is left without the answer she asked for, but she is very good at reading through secret codes.
Dean smiles and Cas feels so good that Dean is acting like himself about it, making a spontaneous joke while stating that he won't leave him.
Cas' first response was a hesitant look, and he seemed to scoff to himself, staring at his hands, before swallowing and looking directly at Dean.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean slaps his hand on the wooden cabinet, not in anger, but because he has no other way of discounting the annoyance.
Jack wanted to start asking if Jody, Donna and the girls planned to arrive a little early to help prepare for Dean's surprise birthday, but they hear the sound of footsteps and two voices arguing from the hall.
Cas says nothing, but his eyes shine, not with the power of an angel, but with that human emotion that made him feel warm. They continue glancing at each other with the tension around them bringing them closer.
In the middle of the night, Dean sits in the kitchen attacking half of the apple pie, Cas is at his side, staring at Dean eating every mouthful of the pie, until his gaze is lost elsewhere... Dean has seen that expression before, when Cas contemplated his possible midlife crisis (an age still undetermined, but extremely old) after Claire ran away from him.
He wanted to curse Cas, wanted to fight someone and break something... But he just managed to move on enough to finish the job they needed to finish and then keep a little hope, because he wouldn't be himself if he didn't fight until the end.
Amara remembers being hurt by Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Lucifer. The last was her definitive executioner, putting her in the cage and carrying her mark. That curse was more Chuck's work than Amara's own product. Chuck with his way of twisting the universe in his favor.
His face flushed from saying something without thinking straight (literally?). So Dean lets out all the words fast.
These thoughts punched him in the face and broke his body when he had to give up Lisa and Ben, because, until recently, he believed that what happened proved definitively that Dean Winchester could not live a beautiful, non-violent and calm life.
Cas searches Dean's face for something, and then he clears his throat and tries to do a deep, slightly hoarse, cowboy voice.
Three days after they beat Chuck and Amara to take control, something happens. During the night Jack wakes up to find Castiel in the map room, both alert because the world has definitely changed, and they can feel it.
Cas just says, with a slight smile, then picks up a fork and tries a piece of what is on Dean's plate.
Cas' shoulders slumped. Dean wanted to roll his eyes, he wanted to shake Cas by the shoulders, but Cas stared at him in such a way that Dean only managed to drop his shoulders too.
in their minds… But because neither of them allowed their imagination to progress so that they understood what those feelings could be if they were corresponded in
Although Dean wasn't so sure about this a few minutes ago, now it feels right. The two will find out how they work together because it feels right.
Cas seems unfazed by any of the previous conversation. He just keeps looking at the television, but now with a reflective look, then turns to face Dean and smiles slightly at him as he pushes the bucket towards him. There's almost nothing in there.
Claire and Kaia arrived early at the Bunker. Sam and Eileen before leaving for a morning walk, accompanied by Miracle, let the two in and said goodbye convincing them that they could have breakfast in the kitchen.
Ah. Yes. He keeps forgetting that big college adventures mean a new town and a fresh start with a doctor he’s never met. The idea of severing from Anna’s care after a practical lifetime of sameness fills him with a vague sense of dread, so he’d been doing his best not to think about it.
Castiel remembers reading a book once, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, that he really loved. There's a line that says, “In that moment, I swear we were infinite.” He'd never entirely understood what that meant, but he thinks this has to be it.
She goes quiet on purpose, knowing the longer he thinks, the more likely he is to talk himself into it, and plays the next episode. He’s half watching Buffy Summers kick ass in leather and half rereading over the texts Meg sent agreeing to be at the party tonight when a new message appears.
Dr. Milton's office is an unassuming small red brick building that was renovated and repurposed some time ago for its current use. The only outward indication, really, that this is not someone’s quaint home is a tarnished gold plaque on the door that reads her name and occupation in bold print. Castiel supposes that makes it more inviting, though he's never actually met any other patients of Anna's to compare notes with.
"Okay, stop. I get that you're mad at me. I'm sorry. I'm not even going to try to tell you what to do about your dad. I just don't think you're the only one with dirty little secrets."
Dean shifts slightly, setting his bottle down beside him like he’s suddenly hyperaware that it could make Castiel uncomfortable, even if it doesn’t. "Damn, Cas. I’m sorry you have to deal with that."
“You take care of yourself, Castiel,” she says, closing the door with a swift click, leaving him with the same uneasy feeling he’d had as his thoughts told him to withhold information from her.
Dean. Look, I got your boy Cas here in a bathroom at Amanda's, and he's not lookin' too good..." He pauses for a moment and nods as if she can see him. "Listen, don't worry about it, okay? I'll get him there." She's going ninety to nothing on the other end, but her pitch has lowered. "Nah, it's no problem..." Dean says. His eyes trace over something on the ceiling and he chews his lip as she continues. "...Okay, great. See ya."
"Would I expect anything less? You just graduated, Castiel. Go have fun with your girl." Cas holds back the urge to correct him and lets him continue. "Besides, I've got to go work on my novel; my due date is fast approaching. Be safe. Send Meg my love."
"What a nice car..." Castiel pats the dashboard gingerly as Dean slides in beside him. He leans his head on the window. It's cool, like the tile floor. He sighs. He misses the tile floor. "This window is very nice, too."
The battlefield is just that, a huge field. It's offset from the main area and lined by trees with a row of tents at one end. Cas and Meg take a seat on the outskirts under a shade tree, sending their well wishes as their friends part ways.
For the rest of the day, Castiel was upset that he couldn't picture himself being Meg's boyfriend no matter how hard he tried. He loved her, she was the prettiest girl he knew, and she was the closest friend he'd ever had. He couldn't imagine ever wanting to be without her, so why wasn't that enough? Why did he have to have crushes on boys instead of her? She deserved someone who would do anything for her, and he knew he was that person.
just to add, "castiel shurley" didn't vibe with me, but i liked the idea of not-god-but-still-an-author chuck as his dad, so i made him a novak. also charles novak kinda slaps as a pen name.
"Hey, um. I’m fine, dad,” Meg eyes him expectedly, holding the pillow up like a threat. “Would you mind if I, perhaps, spent another night at Meg's? Her parents are out again, and you know how she hates to be left alone."
"Too bad I didn't ask if you thought it was interesting. Mine's red, I think." He pauses, eyes flickering over Cas's face for a brief second. "Maybe blue."
Instead of stopping to see what it is his friends are laughing at on Meg’s phone, he strides past them, drawing Dean’s concerned attention. The girl’s eyes follow.
Pam takes a sharp breath at the same time Cas does. And when she speaks, her voice sounds like it barely belongs to her.
He looks fine, he guesses, so he walks out and stands in front of his best friend. “Is this what you wanted?”
Castiel is overcome with the overwhelming urge to give her a fake name. The idea of speaking “Dean” aloud suddenly feels like giving away a secret sealed by an unbreakable blood oath. He prays that Anna can’t see through to the unexplained panic fluttering inside of him as he flounders for a false moniker.
“Hey, we’ve all been there,” Dean laughs, giving Cas a clap on the shoulder. He pats his pockets, taking out a black billfold. "Oh, before I forget, here's your wallet."
Charlie changes the subject in the worst possible way. “Speaking of regret, Cas, didn’t I see you leave with Dean Win-“
"like that," but he doesn’t want to unpack that. Not for himself, and definitely not for Anna. Especially when she's acting so uncharacteristically intense about it. “He’s just a lot different than I expected. Meg even likes him, and you know how she is.”
"Take us to her, red," She shifts her gaze to Castiel. "I've been having some weird dreams lately that I'd like some answers to."
He gives a dismissive hum. He hates when people talk in mass produced wall art-esque inspirational quotes. Especially right now.  “I’ll try not to. Goodbye, Pam.”
Castiel closes his eyes at her touch, a bone deep sigh leaving his lungs. "I don't know what to do with me either."
“What’s this friend’s name?” Anna’s tone is strangely pressing. She seems to catch herself, smoothing her tense features back into order.
Castiel does as he’s told. Dean stares out the windshield, quiet for a moment. “I wish I could go with you.”
As his chest lifts with a deep breath, so does the chest of the brunet before him. He leans forward, eyes tracing the arch of his dark brow and the curve of his cupid's bow, before they hold each other's gaze. He swears, if only for a second, that he sees his copycat's eyes glow a vivid white-blue.
“It can be, and it will be. Sometimes we have to let go of certain things... certain people... to move on to something even better.” He can't help but feel like she means to imply there are specifically certain
"I like men," Castiel deadpans, slipping from underneath Dean's grasp and nearly falling over himself as he flops into his seat. He shuts the door and looks up at Dean through the rolled down window. Meg joins him, silent. "Are you coming?"
Charlie's grin creeps onto her face like she's received the best news ever. "Awesome! Cas, you coming?"
A soft Meg is an honest Meg, but even now Castiel wasn't ready to admit that she may be right. He looks away from her, speaking without thinking. "I dream about him."
"My father is going to kill me," Castiel groans, rubbing his eyes so hard he sees stars that weren't already present. Speaking right now feels like someone else is talking for him. This whole experience is generally awful. "And Meg isn't my girlfriend. She is a girl. Who is my friend. But not both. Well, she is also both a girl and a friend. I am still incredibly drunk."
It's the last thing he remembers before there's a sharp dip in his consciousness and vertigo drags him under.
“I fucking hate this song,” She wrinkles her nose in disgust at the upbeat pop song playing on the radio but doesn’t move to change it. Before any of them know it, they're singing along together as loud as they can.
“I was going to brave sneaking him into my garage to look at my car while dad is gone to that writer’s seminar over the weekend.”
