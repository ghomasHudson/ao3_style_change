Don't stop... I love you so much-- don't--

Twisting and turning and drifting over the gravel, every nerve was lit up inside him. Every sense that he had zeroed in on the wheel, the wind, the black night and road lit up around them by light.
My first major Stony fic is finished! 💙
forget that... Please... please remember that if- if you go away..."
And in that moment, Tony left this world.
“Happy to be of assistance Captain Rogers,” the AI replied happily. One would dare say he sounded relieved that Steve had come.
“Good, now let’s watch Uncle Clint cry over Sirius and Harry’s on-screen bonding.”
“You’re my kotynok too, doesn’t matter what Nat says,” Steve murmured happily.
My exams are finally finished!!! Aahhh!!! So hopefully I'll be able to update more - I'm so glad to be back in action with this story. I do hope you all still love it, so... Yeah! 😊😄 Let's get on with the show!!
Said toddler widened his own eyes in horror and gasped, "But Aunty Nat, I can't have that for lunch!"
you, Tones!”
Tony frowned. His curiosity was peaked.
Beautiful Tony.
Tony took a long  and deep breath in and looked up at the blonde with a confused, and yet
But Tony stood up again to go and get a drink of ice water from the kitchen, and he pretended to ignore Nat's curious gaze that followed him. It was times like that Tony wished that she wasn't the best spy he'd ever known.
After waving Wanda goodbye, Bruce turned to Nat. She knew why he stayed longer to say goodbye. They both shared a look. Nat was equally as worried about Tony as Bruce was.
“Well, there are no bats or snakes in the area-our gardener is always on top of things.”
Everybody scrambled to the starting line, placing bets and cranking the music.
The woman called Nat was positively intimidating.
kill you, no problem! Would you want that?"
Nat rolled her eyes at their lovey-dovey antics, but nodded to Steve-- seemingly satisfied with his answer. She ruffled Tony's hair fondly as the couple stepped into the elevator.
good! But hopefully Thor wouldn't have smelled Tony yet.'
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's my man," Tony whispered. His smile never left his face, even as his eyes closed in sleep and his last breath left his chest.
She scratched the spot behind his ear that was basically irresistible to him. Tony's purring made Nat feel warm inside; she was doing her job successfully.
"It's all right, kotynok... It's alright..."
Natasha’s eyes twinkled happily at the love Wanda showed her. She leaned over to kiss her tender and slow. A content hum bubbled out of Wanda and she moaned as the kiss deepened. They were completely unaware of an equally oblivious set of footsteps entering the kitchen at that moment.
Steve thought bitterly, '
Natasha would refuse every single notion of it, but Tony was busy shopping for ingredients for Nat’s favourite strawberry ice-cream cake!
"Mmmm..." Tony hummed contently as he snuggled up against Steve, using the crook of the blonde's neck as his pillow.
Steve bundled the brunette close to his side, kissing his mussed curls.
"That thread of communication is instinctive. Whether consciously or subconsciously, they can feel one another through that bond when they are apart."
First came fear. Steve's eyes were a wide and sea-green blue.
“Give him time,” Rhodey murmured, rubbing her back reassuringly, “He does this when he’s scared.”
He rubbed his chest and tried to control his erratic heartbeat and breathing.
There was a small pause.
"That's for the ninety-eight percent you got on your report, you slag. What? Were you getting some girl pregnant? I didn't raise my son to be useless."
Steve's tongue licked at the genius' bottom lip, seeking entrance to the cavern of Tony's mouth.
Tony cried it all out while he gripped Natasha tightly- afraid that she might leave him too.
Sweeping away his forehead curls and giving Tony one last kiss on his forehead, Natasha settled down to sleep once more- her arms wrapped securely around her cub.
How did you-? What’s wrong with Tony? What happened?”
*                        *                      *
" he asked, genuinely shocked. Baffled.
Your track shirts smell like oil and gas
Steve realized.
The blonde stopped short when he took a good look at his boyfriend.
Happy smiled, “But don’t get ahead of yourself. There are still things to sort through. Like this paperwork for example!”

The two men chuckled heartily.
No-one in the team could also deny the obvious love that was shared between a

her enough to let her help him through his panic attack?
"But we still- I mean… he gave his knot- we…"
... *Evil cackle from me!*
The sky thundered with wrath and cracked open with lightning tendrils spiking across the midnight blue hue. Clouds dipped in shades of black and grey ink, brought forth warnings of oncoming hailstorms.
“Thank you for the caramel surprise, Sweetheart.”
“I’ll do it!” Steve jumped up faster than lightning, surprising everyone, and even himself. Shocked and quizzical expressions met his blushing face.
Not that he wasn't thankful for T'Challa's vibranium shields, but
Steve got up last, soley because of a small brunette who was fast asleep in his arms, wrapped up in a blanket burrito. Tony mumbled in his sleep and wrinkled his nose adorably,
He searched Tony's eyes. Tony saw something in Steve's eyes that he was too scared to linger onto. The air crackled, or maybe it could've just been Steve's imagination, but he couldn't elaborate on it, because all too soon, Tony pulled away and he walked to the trunk of his car.
that Tony basically weighed next to nothing, even as an adult.
"What did I miss?" he asked sleepily, yawning.
“You drive a sweet bargain, O-Captain, My-Captain.”
The blonde captain took every opportunity to kiss, cuddle and tickle his baby boy and show him how much Steve loved him! Tony slept soundly in the cradle of Steve's arm.
"I will most certainly put a hurt on you
“Tony,” he began softly, “You’re avoiding the subject.”
As soon as he reached Tony, he clutched the genius’ hand in his own. “Don’t worry my princess, I will save you,” he declared with all the fake determined honesty in his eyes.
"Hey, no, hey, no, no Tony shh… shh, shh," Steve cooed softly. He began rubbing Tony's arms gently, tapping the scientist's chin to look up into his eyes.
Soft like Sunflower gold...
"You're too hard on yourself, Shellhead," he murmured against Tony's forehead, kissing it softly.
Tony Stark sat in his bed, listening to the sound of the rain as his music played softly in the back. His room glowed golden as the light swam over his school books. He was going over some physics homework when he suddenly heard the sound of his father's office door banging on its hinges.
I’m just not ready, I-“

Tony couldn't take it any longer!
“Oh yeah,
So my first work on AO3 is complete. Kudos and positive feedback is always appreciated. It was really my first time writing every tag mentioned, so I hope I hooked you in on the atmosphere and tone of the story - I hope I conveyed that right, but expect more fics in the future (with, hopefully, a better writing technique! 😄❤️💙)
The two friends had gone out for drinks, because Steve had felt pretty petty, like a child, and he wanted to get drunk and forget about his selfish feeling of loneliness.
I had all just been a bad dream.
Natasha's heart tightened. It wasn't just her alpha instincts wanting to protect Tony; she hated seeing her friend so distraught like this!
Tony was left utterly speechless.
He squeaked with surprise!
"Tony," he murmured thickly, his tone serious, "you have to report this."
The avengers that remained after the snap, stood silent as the grave, unprepared for the reaction that Tony would give them. They were stunned, silent.
But Tony wouldn’t have it any more! He couldn’t
" Steve couldn't help his sarcastic tone. He was tired, and the last thing he wanted was another disagreement between him and Stark, even when the captain was honestly trying to help him.
Steve took a seat across from him, locking his gaze with the brunette.
"She really gave you one helluva shovel talk didn't she, Love?" he asked out of the blue.
Tony leapt up the last few stairs, two at a time, clutching the bouquet of Steve’s favorite flowers and the holiday brochure hidden between the petals.
“Oh, but you love us Rogers!”
“Steve, come on, bud. I’ll make you some tea and you can come sit and relax,” Bruce gently coaxed him to the couch, but Steve pushed away.
"I forgive you!" Tony sobbed into the kiss, "I... I f-forgave you a while ago a-actually. But... but I j-just didn't th-think it would still hu-hurt so much!"
The tiny brunette swatted Steve’s chest playfully, still giggling.
They both groaned in ecstasy as the crown of Steve's cock slipped into Tony's hot inner walls.
After a couple minutes, a sleepy Little Tony found himself smiling as the first notes of a well-known song played throughout his daddy's room...
He had to hold back his own tears of happiness in case he worried Tony about why
Steve sprinted into the workshop as soon as he heard Tony’s scream.
Steve cupped the statue’s cheek tenderly, wishing it were really him.
Bucky's voice drifted off, too ashamed to speak the words. Tony's face was unreadable as he looked off to the side. Sighing, he didn't face Bucky as he spoke.
Cap plays the piano? He doesn't really seem the type...I'd like to hear it sometimes though.
Cap has teenage fangirls, huh? Well, lucky him. Maybe someone should point out that for someone famous for fighting Nazis he looks an awful lot like their ideal master race. And that’s only because of what my dad did to him. Did you watch that documentary in the end?
Look, the article even says 'developed from
Alright, so. We went to your house and it was... well, really weird. Cap was doing his fearless leader act again, so he had me watch the back and Hawkeye hidden down the street in case Loki made a run for it, and he and Thor went in. So I’m there waiting and waiting and waiting and nothing’s happening, and eventually I got tired of waiting and decided to go in. I figured I was either going to find that Loki wasn’t there and they’d gotten distracted watering your aunt’s dahlias, or I was going to stumble in on a pile of corpses. What actually happened was I went in, and Loki and Thor and Steve were in your bedroom, and instead of a fight to the death, Thor was honest-to-goodness scolding him. And Loki was sulking. And that was it.
Tony,
Steve,
Not that any of the other participants got to say much. Stark and Rogers did not hold back as they gave their opening statements, slamming each other's opinion without mercy. Stark delivered a technical breakdown of exactly how registration would work and why it was a good idea, packed, of course, with her usual wit and one-liners. Cap, on the other hand, delivered an impassioned and rousing plea for the American people to trust in the good of the people that chose to protect them, not because any government told them to do so, but because they wanted to. Both strongly implied that picking the other side would be Bad for America. Unfortunately for Stark, this was always going to be a more convincing statement from a soldier and a patriot who literally wears the flag for a living than it is from an ex-weapons manufacturer. However, the battle was far from over.
Oh yeah I ran into Loki the other day, or rather he ran into me. He was getting chased by some weird monsters and I had to stop him falling off a roof. He seems nice..though I'm pretty sure he hit on me..which was weird. Anyway I'm guessing Hawkeye jr is that female archer in purple I've seen around. We've not officially met yet, but I've seen her gang around. I notice no one tells them to stop superheroing :P
I love you so much, and you can do this. We'll get it all cleared up and I'll be home with you both soon. In the meantime, I've called in a favour and sent someone to help. Have fun.
P.S. You still don't know anything about Steve.
Um...do you really think you should be pissing Osbourne off when he apparently has weapons hidden in his house? I mean I know you have the suit but you aren't in it all the time...what if he meant a more literal version of destroy?
Today is the last of the daily updates! From now on we will be sticking to a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule :)
Apologies for the late update today, I was having some computer issues. I thought it would be just typical if the first update I missed was the last one! But no, we can't put it off any longer. Here we go...
Want to meet at the hotel?
Yours,
Loki was the one who hung up my phone, he came to see and said he didn't want you interrupt. I did tell him off for hanging up on you without asking me, I guess he was worried if you spoke to me first you'd give your version of things and I wouldn't listen to him.
Penny
Yeah I was planning on watching the documentary. I probably still will, but i'll take it with a pinch of salt. Did you two not get on very well? That must have been hard.
Penny,
When we visited the home of Sam 'The Falcon' Wilson, headquarters of the No campaign, we found it deserted. Sources suggest that Captain America and his supporters who have also defaulted on registering have gone into hiding to escape the penalty of the law. What their next move will be, no-one knows.
Tony,
'The Star Spangled Flan with a Plan' is of course a reference to the wonderful 1796 Broadway, which you should all go read if you haven't already :)
Tony,
Also, I’ve upped the security on the tower (again) so the party can still go ahead on Saturday, whoo!
I'm so sorry. I love you. We'll get him back.
Steve
That aside, what did Steve say to you? Nothing weird, right?
Have you ever heard of a self-fulfilling prophecy? If you keep treating Loki like he is going to turn into a murderous psycho then he is probably going to turn into a murderous psycho!
Penny,
I'll take the pin, but only if you promise not to have someone spy on us! I'll call someone if I need help, but I don't want anyone hiding behind a bush watching us.
Thank you for your letter. I didn't think they'd let me have it, but they did once they'd read it. Invasion of privacy seems to be a theme at the moment.
Dear Steve,
P.S Could I put a work bench in my room? I used to have one in the Garage at home..
The thing is, you're right. I'm still against the act. I still want to speak against it. But not when lives are being put at risk. Not when people are dying. Not when it drives us apart. I just want this to be over.
Okay..just thought I should check. Make sure I shouldn't be writing any other letters.
I suppose I need to keep this a secret? All right, but out of interest, you life has always been pretty public, how come I've never heard of you being with a guy before?
Whether we should be for/against the act
Yours Sincerely,
Too busy to write much right now.
Nattie,
Well you know I'm friends with Harry Osbourne, but then there is Mary Jane, she is really pretty and wants to go into modelling after high school. She is really nice too, everyone likes her so she tends to flit between groups from time to time. She always eats lunch with us though.
Guilty
Tony,
Harry doesn't invite anyone to his parties, he just posts them on facebook and who ever comes comes. I swear he doesn't know half the people most of the time, but thats Harry for you. He liked he attention, I think probably because he doesn't get any at home...
Penny,
What's more, you're keeping them in another dimension in a prison for supervillains. People they put there themselves. You're locking them up with psychopaths and mass murderers just because they have identities- families- they want to protect.
Jan and Greer hated him, that’s what Tony decided as he sourly sipped his drink and watched the dance floor from his balcony seat. This whole mission was their fault.
“Hello, Peter,” he said.
Tony was honest-to-god one of the best friends Steve ever had. Even if Tony had grumbled at the need to share beds on their trip. But deserts get cold at night and soft beds were few and far between on their trip back to Timely.
Naive and strong and fast. Not a good combination.
“You didn’t see it,” Jan said back.
Horror dawned on Tony’s face. “Wait --”
Alexander expected Steve to fail and had set up all that he could for Steve’s failure.
“Do you want me to arrest Obadiah?” Rhodey asked.
In response, Tony tugged at what he thought was the man’s tights. Turned out to be some sort of thin leather. “Come on, you know we’ll both freeze without warmth.”
“Thanks, Friday! Let’s say, living room at 12:00 noon? Pasta Barn down the street?” Tony said, rubbing his hands together.
Because it didn’t matter if he died or not. He’d still wake up in his own bed in the morning, completely fit and healthy without a broken neck.
“That he is,” agreed Maria.
Cap was pondering. “This has to be a shepherd’s cabin --”
“What, Tony?” Steve rested his hands on Tony’s hips.
Steve ignored the barb implied in Tony’s question. “Triskelion has its own artisans. When I have time, I like to draw.”
Steve blinked a couple of times, his headache still throbbing and his arm feeling pins and needles from Tony’s weight. He hadn’t thought of that. “That’s the solution.” He curled his fingers in Tony’s soft hair.
November came too fast and Peter pressed the submit button on his MIT application. Not that it was a guarantee that Peter would get in, but Uncle Rhodey and Dad were convinced that Peter was a lock. But it did mean that Peter had just taken one step towards officially leaving home for somewhere next fall.
Tony learned a lot over the next few days about art, artists and art historians. For one thing, he wasn’t expecting to find out that Steve viewed art historians with a deep, ingrained distrust that impressed even the cynical Logan. The other thing was the film production company was very persistent in wanting to talk to Steve, so the PR people were begging Tony to get Steve to talk to them. The third thing was that the art expert turned out to be not a particularly bad guy, just firmly convinced that his opinion was the right one.
Steve tightened his hold on his boyfriend, rubbing calming circles over his back.
Because he knew amongst that teasing tone of his daddy, Steve was showing his pride for Tony-- saying how, despite everything, his baby was still such a strong and good man.
He snaked his hands over Steve’s abs seductively, but Tony quickly brought Steve’s body close to his own for a hug, breathing in his boyfriend’s scent.
It’s depth is my unpaid debt
After splashing around with Tony in the bath, and making soap bubble beards and mustaches, Steve dried him off and bundled Tony up in his favourite kitty onesie.
"But," he asked, "What do you wanna call this now? Call us?"
Steve suddenly scooped him up bridal-style with Tony squealing adorably! The captain pecked a kiss onto Tony’s nose.
Tony stood shell-shocked in Steve’s arms, not even comprehending how real it was.
“Not possible, Honey- I love you infinity!”
He couldn't be surer of anything else when it came to his love for a genius named Anthony Edward Stark...
Finally coming out of his stupor, he hurriedly bustled Tony into his home.
Tony had missed Steve's voice.
I had Jarvis search the security cameras for you, when I decided you had taken too long and
His tongue was adorably sticking out the side of his mouth and his brows were furrowed in concentration as he sketched the 'blueprints' for another invention that his toddler mind had thought up. Being little didn't stop Tony from being the genius that he was, even back when he was a toddler himself.
"Hey Old Man," Tony quipped, making Steve roll his eyes nonetheless. He wouldn't admit it directly to Tony's face, but the nicknames were kind of growing on him.
Jenny gripped Steve’s shoulders tight and sat him down in one of the hospital chairs closest to her desk. She knelt in front of him, rubbing his arm reassuringly. She was young, blond with red highlights and doe-brown eyes like Tony’s.
“Well,” she continued, sitting down next to Bucky who was reading his copy of
He gave Natasha’s hand a comforting squeeze when her foot-tapping didn’t ease up. She was drumming her nails incessantly on the arm of the couch and it was very concerning to the rest of the team to see her so unhinged.
Waiting in line at the hospital cafeteria, Natasha caught sight of Dr Strange sitting by a table. He drank a cup of coffee absently while going over some paperwork. Seeing as the line wasn't going to ease up any sooner, she made her way over to him.
Aw, my
Frankly, Steve would've been interested, if it weren't for a
stud," Tony mused, leaning into Steve's space, "I'd like it if we could go get that coffee."
Steve barked out a laugh as Tony teasingly poked him in the shoulder.
“I like it too,” he smiled.
“Look, Happy’s waiting for me,” Tony mumbled weakly.
"They
"Awh, don't tell F.R.I.D.A.Y, Nat, but you're my best gal!" Tony called, as Nat strolled out of the room. She blew him a kiss before closing the door.
“What?” the captain blurted out, then immediately regretting it when he realized what he’d said.
“And… and you’re okay with that?” he whispered.
“A tear slipped out,” Nat replied to the unasked question.
The genius gave Steve another crooked, and yet fond, smirk in amusement. Steve found himself blushing.
Tony looked at the omega.
"Among other things, yeah, " Steve replied dryly, "Why? What are you doing here?" The last question
"What was the question?" he whispered, barely above a breath.
thought Tony,
Tony blinked, clearly dumbfounded by the lack of sleep.
Tony’s ears rang and his vision clouded over with watery tears.
It took a while, but slowly, his eyes lost their haze and Tony blinked a couple times before really seeing Nat in front of him.
to keep me away from Daddy?"
So this chapter dives a little bit into a kind of "soulmates" theory-narrative. So it's an a/b/o with a hint of soulmate theory sprinkled in too - just to give the world building some shape and form.
He grabbed the back of Steve's head and forced Steve's gaze to lock with his. Tony absent-mindedly found himself playing with the hairs at the nape of the soldier's neck.
Beautiful Tony. Selfless, caring, intelligent Tony.
in his lifetime.
thought Steve, '
But that was a problem for tomorrow.
Tony purred happily once her touch settled in.
"I'd like that," murmured Steve, "I'd like that very much."
"Works every time!" she whispered to herself.
and the hate and the mistrust. And then the sadness came. It was like going through the five stages of grief. But then- then it felt really good when I reached the acceptance stage."
But Steve felt his stomach drop. His body froze. The last time he had been this close to Tony, he'd messed everything up- he'd nearly gotten Tony killed.
With her deep thrusts nailing Tony’s sweet spot every time, Tony cried out, overstimulated as the small toy buzzed against his sac. He soon reached his high with another scream.
The tears, his heartbreak, the
Limping faster, Tony hobbled towards the front door, adrenaline pumping through his veins, giving him the will to push on.
Steve kissed Tony softly when he finished.
Steve’s smile was frail and watery and everything inside of Tony was waiting to launch himself into his alpha’s arms. He
Tony Stark was stubborn, infuriating, he had his arrogance, but he was also brilliant and witty and intelligent and just as self-sacrificial as Steve! It felt invigorating to the captain to have someone as opposite as him to counteract his orders, his techniques. It felt good. It kept his brain working and with Tony, he was forced to open his mind and see a different point of view.
He couldn't help but give Tony the most whole-hearted smile that he ever could form! As if the brunette was the brightest star in Steve's universe. And he was!
In one swift movement, Steve stood and pulled Tony into his arms! He cradled the brunette’s head softly against his shoulder and was mindful of his hurt, bandaged arm.
"Oh, you like that, then baby? Huh? You like taking what I give? You wanna take my cock, huh? That it?"
He peppered chaste little kisses all over Tony's red-nosed face as the Tony whispered thickly, through his tears: "I love you! I love you so much, Steve! Don't
Jarvis felt so sad for his creator...
“There you are…shh, you’re safe now… you’re okay, Tony,” she whispered soothingly.
He breathed a sigh of relief when the metal doors opened and practically broke the
"How about you stay by me Antoshka, so I can tell you more stories, huh? It's not gonna be any fun if I have to tell it to myself."
A little reckless, she thought, but it screamed
But because of what Steve had done…
"You like him, don't you?" Nat asked. It was an innocent question on the surface. Underneath, it held the undertone of her defensive nature towards Tony.
Steve's face grew dark, tired.
They looked into each other's eyes steadily and Tony suddenly felt
"Now, Mr Barnes," Tony smiled, "I don't blame you for thinking that you're in trouble. And I most certainly don't blame you for what happened."
She scooped up the little Tony, drawing him close and pressing little kisses to his face and neck.
In one swift movement, she pulled Steve back onto his feet and locked his hands in a steel grip by his sides!
He was—
"I love you O, Captain, My Captain," Tony replied.
As he pushed open the door, Tony expected Steve to be lounging on the mound of pillows like the oaf he could be.
He threw a wink at the Soldier, who breathed out a feeble laugh.
Bucky's jaw was clenched tight as he looked away from Steve to the door. He was seething in his weeping cries through his clenched teeth, as his tears fell like silent waterfalls over his face.
I just… will you
“I refuse to believe that,” he whispered, leaning forward.
“Well, you’re the only animal in my life!” He winked up at the captain innocently.
Tony hummed contently at the touch.
you did it. You're an alpha who has needs, just as many as the average omega. Your rut was pretty close too, so the feral-ness of your behavior was like, at least, thirty percent influenced by that."
"Not possible, Doll! Surely not ever possible
in the same sentence.
It was all too much. He just needed to get out!
To a man who I still love and never said.
"H-How- How could I n-not be laughing?!" Tony wheezed out, still clearly having the time of his life!
Cuddling up against the front of the couch by the fireplace, letting Steve wipe away the motor oil from his face, Tony felt the relaxation flow into his muscles. Steve tenderly stroked the cloth over Tony’s cheek and nose, then after, kissing the spots he cleaned.
…” he slurred sleepily.
for something you'd want me to paint or... if I wanted to spoil you." Steve coughed. He wrung his hands together, nervously.
need for perfection.”
you stubborn captain."
hesitate to call Pepper!”
She scooped up the little boy and kissed away his tears as they fell. Tony's eyes were wide and glossed over. His lip was quivering as he tried to keep everything in, but Nat wouldn't have it.
"Uh- Uhm- yeah, yes- yes, I - please, if you… if you don't mind," Tony coughed, not meeting Steve's eyes. Steve clenched his teeth, regret dropping like a boulder in his stomach.
Steve kissed him sweetly.
"It was Howard," he confirmed softly, mumbling his words so quietly, Steve had to lean in close, straining his ears.
Tony's breath stuttered.
A breathless gasp shuddered out of Tony's chest. Steve cradled the brunette's face in his palms, kissing his lips softly.
Making his way to the checkout, Tony turned to his side to get out his card. So he couldn’t see the oncoming-
For one moment, Clint stood unbothered in the doorway, snacking on some cashews, but the next, they all immediately spilled from his hand and scattered to the floor once he smelled Tony’s pheromones in the room. His eyes became saucers.
The both chuckled.
Tony is his one and only.
He continued to pepper little kisses all over Tony's face and neck-- occasionally blowing a raspberry too! - until Tony's soft giggles filled the room once again! It was music to Steve's ears
It wasn't until Natasha called Steve one Friday morning, that the man finally shot out of his wallowing in ice-cream and comedy shows and took a shower and called Bucky.
And Steve would always be sorry for that. For causing that fear, that... hesitation and doubt!
Steve leaned in for another kiss, laughing darkly and Tony was more than happy to give it. The captain could taste the sweet caramel as he kissed those soft, supple lips and became lost in the feeling and the taste of Tony.
As Jarvis switched on the lights, Steve sat up and saw Tony kneeling at the foot of his bed with one of his arms still gripping Steve's right leg.
It took a while for those brown orbs to focus on the captain. Remarkably, they still glittered with humor and life. Tony was still there.
here.
His mom taught him some classic Italian meals and Anna, Jarvis’ wife, taught him to bake as well.
sounded then.
Settling down under the covers, Steve drew his small bundle close to his heart and combed his fingers softly through Tony’s dishevelled hair. He placed a kiss on the boy’s forehead. Whether he was four-years old or forty, Tony was Steve’s love and he’d be there for the inventor no matter what.
"Wait, what bond is this?" Steve asked.
He laughed too, almost breathlessly and flushed even more, "I'll take that as a compliment!" Another pause.
So, I'm contemplating whether or not to leave this fic with a cliffhanger and start the 3rd book in the series, because of Chapter consistency.
, not me or you. It just reflects the issues Steve has to work through. So we're okay."
“Okay Tony,” he said turning around, “I’ve caught them.”
“I’ll get you some water, and then you and your friend over there can wait patiently until news comes,” she cocked her head towards Happy heading their way with paperwork in his arms.
She would deliver food from Pepper's prompting that Tony should get something into that
Thankfully, it was only ten p.m, so Steve was possibly still awake.
Her face scrunched up as she groaned, frustrated.
Let's see if you guys can spot my How To Train Your Dragon 2 reference in this ficlet/drabble.
He was launched back in his seat, his arms clutching the wheel for dear life.
Steve wanted to say more, but Tony was always faster.
"Tones?" she called out softly, "You feeling okay? You smelt a little off sitting next to Bruce earlier and I-"
So, I'm kinda going off the Marvel timeline a bit, but I'm fairly certain that Tony's arc reactor is removed in Iron Man 3, so this takes place way back in 2013 after that surgery and after the events of Iron Man 3. It's like a cute, in-between moment between the canonical movies. (Edit - there obviously will be a Chapter 2 posted asap!)
Steve was persistent. His crystal-blue eyes glittered determinedly. Tony saw no way out of this.
Pepper was on the phone making some calls. Happy and Rhodey were going over the procedures that would follow with Stephen.
"Son of Barton, I will smite thee with enough lightning to power all of Asgard! Do not insult my battle strategies!" -
Howard leered at him.
kill you anyway if you ever tell him I said that! Have we reached an understanding?"
“No!” Steve stared incredulously at his teammates who did nothing, but shoot him pitiful or surprised glances.
Steve froze.
Finally, Nat cleared her throat awkwardly, “Well, uh, alright then. Um- if that’s- that’s- yeah, okay. So... here’s his plate.”
“Don’t judge me! It’s a beautiful relationship, woman!”
Most people would grow to see you in a different light when troubles come your way. When you asked for help, some people would believe you to be too frail or sickly to handle something like that on your own ever again. Natasha wasn’t like that. She didn’t push or fawn over you like an injured duckling. She understood that each person had to overcome their own battles, but she’d be there to catch you nevertheless.
"Oh, did I?" Tony retorted, feigning mock-forgetfulness, "Well, then. Thank God I'm here! Regardless, I fixed it." Tony proudly held up a device to Steve - some sort of bracelet, it looked like to the blonde.
“I promise!”
"Really?" he gasped, making Steve chuckle.
“Okay,” he mumbled, getting in next to Tony. Happy nodded, satisfied and determined and sped his way to the hospital. And if he saw in the rear-view mirror how Steve cradled Tony’s head to his chest, ever so gently, well… then he said nothing.
He gently lifted Tony’s chin. The little genius’ eyes were wide and glossed over. His nose was a pink dot on his face.
"No problem, Tony, it was my pleasure."
The prompt I thought of was the song, Love of My Life by Queen and Freddie Mercury.
"Mean what?" Tony mumbled, turned to him.
Tony blushed, but nodded.

Nat visibly slumped in relief once Tony settled.
"That's what they
His eyes widening comically!
As the blonde massaged slow circles onto Tony's back, the scientist never felt more loved - more at home - than he did here in Steve's arms.
Hot, angry tears gathered in his eyes and his vision blurred over. He sniffled, but immediately brought his hand to his mouth to mute any further noises, but Steve had heard.
A break of tension hung in the air.
"This might sting just a little," Steve warned, "I'm ripping the band-aid right off." And with that, Steve began to lightly smooth over the septic with the cloth. Tony's skin was warm to the touch. The muscles beneath flexed with each small movement. The captain found himself admiring Tony's physique. The mechanic was quite lithe and well-built. Though, it caused a confusing feeling to bubble up in Steve's chest.
Bucky pushed his hands against Steve's back, counter-acting Steve's feet scraping against the tiles as he refused to go even an inch of Tony's room's doorway.
The army crumbled around them into dust- into nothing. And yet, his heart did the very same thing when he suddenly looked towards a piece of rubble. Some of his fellow teammates began crowding around that large cement debri.
“Please Tones, I really still need you…” he croaked out.
"Oh?" Nat grinned slyly, but she quickly turned it into a pout, "Who says so, Antoshka? Aww, I guess
When the two parted, Tony was dazed and a little disoriented. Steve steadied him, giggling softly, “Did anyone ever tell you that you are really adorable when you ramble?”
“What are we watching?”
question to anyone curious.
In response, she tightened her grip on Steve's arms, making him flinch. Steve soon began twisting in pain against the wall.
The good thing about being a supersoldier is the ability to carry extremely heavy weights, but Steve found it
"Y-You," he began shakily, pointing his finger in Steve's direction, "You... kept... the-the studio for... for projects reserved only...
A slow month without any news.
But then the feeling changed drastically within a second.
Steve's expression softened as he walked over to Tony and knelt in front of him on the carpet. Tony flinched back at the close contact and shifted restlessly.
Tony nodded.
"Shh, shh my Love.
"Mmm, Alpha..." he murmured, dazed. His pupils dilated and his mind began to fill with that soft, golden haze of bliss. "
Steve smiled, "Thank you for taking care of my Tony, Nat. I know that it must've been hard with me being late, but I saw how good you are at calming him down. I admire the bond you've created with him - it's wonderful that he has someone like that to care for him that way. So thank you Nat. You have
"And Nat," he turned to the spy who sat on the sofa and was scrubbing Bucky's face clean.
“Load him on here. Come on, quickly!” Stephen commanded.
I hope you all still love it and yes, based on the votes, I'm going to finish the book in this installment, since only three, or so, more chapters will be written.
Nat furrowed her brows, confused. She knew it was Tony, but this concerned her deeply now.
He walked in on Steve-
Tony giggled.
Steve chuckled heartily and it filled Tony’s heart as he felt the vibrations jiggle up and down.
“Oh, Steven Rogers, you are
"No, it's just… Nat, I had a cake planned for you! I wanted to bake it myself to apologize for being a mess during my heat. And now, I didn't have a chance."
Steve clasped Tony's hand in both of his own and brought it up to to kiss each knuckle softly... so tenderly...

"ANTHONY! Don't you dare run away from me! Anthony Edward Stark!" his father called from the staircase.
Tony collapsed onto the couch behind him with an
That won’t let me forget
"Yes?" Tony whispered back.
Steve wavered in his answer.
Tony sat with his back to the door, the entire area of his skin lined with stitches. Steve clenched his teeth sympathetically. Tony's entire right arm was bandaged like Nat's and some blood was still seeping through.
She swatted his chest, smirking.
It was home.
Tony, currently turned four years old - physically and mentally - was sitting quietly in the tower's living room, currently watching some cartoons and drawing at the same time.
- at how hesitant

He suddenly breathed in deep,

Wait.
"Oh, my sweet thing!" Steve said, despairingly.
"Knocked to the ground by the one and only Ms Romanoff!"
"H-Hi- hi, I um… I… " swapping the bouquet between both of his hands, the soldier cleared his throat, embarrassed.
She chuckled, "That's great Tony. You just focus on feeling good, that's all. But how's about we get you off the cold floor, huh?"
And now I find,
"What was that about?" asked Bucky as he came from Tony's room.
Smiling, he leaned in to give Tony a small hug-and-pat on the shoulder. As their bodies connected, however, he felt how Tony almost sunk into his grip- limp and exhausted.
“All I'm saying is that it just makes it all the more concerning that there are self destructive people in the world, like Tony, during his Mark II creative process!”
"You know, ever since you'd gotten that haircut, you've become a real jerk like back in the 40s, you know that?" huffed the captain. He turned to face Bucky, his expression as stoic as ever. Bucky rolled his eyes, "No, I'm the friend telling you that after seven months of torturing yourself, it would be good for you to rightfully apologize to the man and get some closure, at the least, for both of you."
“Hey Punk,” he called to Steve.
But Nat's face didn't change.
The space-ship finally touched down on the lawn. The new glowing woman, Carol Danvers, had just rescued the two lost team members from the void of space. Once Nebula made sure that Tony could walk on his own, she made her way over to Rocket, hugging him tightly.
The genius nodded, looking down. A small smile played on his lips.
He gave Steve a big hug as they entered their floor and reached up on the tips of his toes to give Steve a kiss, "Oh, I'm sorry, My Honey, but your face was
“Lucky guess,” Steve deadpanned. He looked up at the cameras, “Hey J.A.R.V.I.S, can you help me?”
“Well,” Natasha sighed, slapping Bucky’s shoulder, “she wants to learn some martial arts from me and... she saw your motorcycle parked in the lot, so she wants riding lessons from you as well.” The red-haired spy smirked, clearly enjoying this.
Tony hid his face in his hands and began to weep quietly. Natasha's heart broke at the sight.
loudly. Fresh tears welled up and overflowed his face, and his breathing turned just as erratic as in his nightmare.
He gently wiped away Tony's stray tears.
The clock seemed to stick in the same hour to Tony.
Tony felt so
They both looked at each other. And then burst out laughing!
“F.R.I.D.A.Y? Be a dear and please leave a note to Barton saying that a surprise is  waiting for him in the kitchen.” Steve called out, his gaze never unlocking from Tony's.
His eyes were still so wide and scared. It cracked at Steve's heart again.
She gasped, “Well, look at you, Mr Scientist – gettin’ all clever so soon!”
Tony looked to him, his face wild and frantic.
"Oh, My Sweet Omega, you don't have to be embarrassed. It's an unfortunate thing to go through, but it's normal. Oh, it's okay. I'm here to take care of you."
Getting ready the next morning to go see Tony, Steve decided to make the omega some brownies. He just pulled them out of the oven, humming to himself, when the phone rang.
He snuggled deeper into Steve's lap and buried his nose into his daddy's neck.
"Tony... Tony, it's all right, shhh" Steve's heart broke to see Tony cry so suddenly. He helped Tony to stand up and gripped the brunette's elbows securely.
no! No,
Steve
close to his manhood!
Everything inside of Tony screamed agonizingly. His vision swam, his ears ringing in a high pitched squeal.
Tony blushed, gasping in shock, “
A breathless chuckle bubbled out of him, "But I wanted his legacy to live on through something important. And I'm glad that Nat agreed to be our surrogate mother too."
“Get in contact with me later, but you gotta drive Tony to the hospital NOW!”
"Shh... shhh, that's it... Daddy's here; Daddy's gotcha... You don't have to worry 'bout nothing...There we go... Ahh, there we go, my beautiful boy... My
After witnessing Scott turn into a teenager, and then into an old man, and then into
An iron ring clenched around Steve’s own heart, choking him- shallow breaths leaving and entering his body.
Splashing himself with water, Tony tried to get rid of the burning fire licking its way under his skin, but it only flamed higher!
, in every known galaxy, in this known universe and beyond! I love you more than infinity, and back again!"
He could see Tony anxiously biting his thumb from the side crowd, standing by Natasha’s girl team.
Steve smiled, “Yes, he still is. He’ll always be the only one.”
flourish! - and called out to the love of his life joyously, “Steven! Oh, Alpha of my Eye-“
"You never left my heart, Steve," Tony whispered. The captain's breathing stuttered at the words.
He wanted Tony to trust him. To trust that he will
Steve’s small voice flowed through the door, trying to reach his mate, “Oh, Sweetheart, please, I- Babydoll, can I please see you? Can you let me in?”
Taking a deep breath in, eyeing the accelerator, Steve waited…
Steve pecked Tony's nose and it made the genius giggle softly.
He fed Tony another bite of the chocolate doughnut, massaging his back.
He squeezed Tony in one last hug, before swiftly lifting the scientist into his arms in one lift! Tony squealed, clutching at Steve while the soldier chuckled, carrying the love of his life bridal style towards the compound.
He pointed to the arrow that had nearly pierced Steve's nether region.
The scientist stared at him curiously. He scanned Steve's eyes, his own eyes guarded and yet, wanting to let himself be open enough to believe Steve's words.
Steve barked out a laugh, finally relenting, and sat beside the brunette.
I threw in a Game of Thrones reference too, just because I felt like spicing things up.
Tony sucked in a breath.
The next thing he knew, the gorgeous brunette glanced in his direction and the two locked eye-contact.
“- and let’s enjoy a picnic, ‘kay?”
He was surrounded by the warmth and love that Steve held for him as the song continued to play. The warmth of Steve's body heat... The warmth of his soft skin against Tony's...
So that answered
All that could be heard were the quite sniffles Natasha tried to push down.
They always worked it out. Even after being apart.
Moaning, he felt the waves of numbness trying to quell his pain.
they both wondered-- both lost in their heads,
Letter "M" prompt: Mouse!
As Pepper, Rhodey and Stephen left the room, Nat waved them hello as she walked in.
“Tony still loves you,” Happy whispered.
But the message was certainly clear: don't mess with a lioness' cub!
"It was always my privilege to be able to do that Tony Stark… it still is."
That was given by an angel
The young man excused himself from the group he was speaking with and started walking towards a flustered Steve Rogers.
Grabbing a plastic container off the shelf, Steve made his way over to the tiny rodent. He could hear squeaking and shuffling. Opening the cupboard, Steve gasped as he found a whole family of mice munching on the rice and sugar packets!
His whole body filled itself with warmth, and a sense of safety surrounded him; a safety that only his daddy could provide.
Steve sucked in a breath at her words. His eyes widened to saucers.
"You want anything for lunch? The team will be back from their mission in an hour," she smiled.
"Don't worry My Fire Angel, I'm always careful!"
An idea then hit him.
Little did Steve know that he would go to regret that previous statement...
I'm still very much alive! 😄

Natasha snickered, clearly smug at how her plan was going.
"I know," Tony murmured, quietly, "I know…"
“Ugh! I can’t deal with this Tony! I can’t deal with your obsessive, border-lying
Hate it or love it, I do hope you were satisfied with the conclusion to this series - maybe because I love this universe so much, I'll include a small fic or Steve raising Morgan with the Avengers, but I'll see.
"I'm serious," Steve replied, his voice husky and warm, "I love you Tony."
And there he stood.
Tony giggled, blushing.
built you an art studio on your floor, Steve?" Tony breathed out. His mouth hung open, still gaping around him.
But that was it. No snide comment. No further quip. Nothing. Just a hello.
A tentative hand reached out, shakily, to touch Steve's cheek.
button so he wouldn’t have to look his team members in the face.
She tried to console him, petting his hair affectionately, but Clint still stood shell-shocked in the doorway. Nat turned her attention back to him. Keeping her tone soft, but stern, she called his focus.
The genius breathed in staggeringly.
Not that Steve was doing any better at controlling

Steve had gotten the love of his life back.

"I- I'm just... I'm just really scared, Steve!" he choked out, sniffling again.
"Oh, come here," he pulled the small brunette back into his arms, still mindful of his bandages, but made sure to bring him close so that Tony could soak up Steve's body heat.
The spy nodded, satisfied with the answer.
"No, I know," Pepper murmured, giving a feeble smile, "We all are."
. By Rhodey, Nat and Pepper… Happy and the team… and by me.”
"I guess, during those seven months, I reached an understanding of
Tony saw stars dancing above him as he climaxed, shouting out Steve's name, and he marveled at how beautiful his lover looked in the afterglow!
'Alphas,' he thought. But a little tingle went through his heart nonetheless at the thought of Steve being jealous of other Alphas in Tony's life.
His sweet boy couldn't even finish one sentence!
Steve cradled his boyfriend gently against him, kneeling on the floor while the lightning sparked up the shadows.
My heart is dead.
"Steve..." Tony breathed out.
His eyes narrowed as he scanned the car in the distance; looking to find any sign of recognition.
Massaging Tony’s back tenderly, he let the small genius cuddle close and comfortable.
Tony would fall asleep soon, like he always did when she petted him like this, and then she’d deal with a
Tony wound his arms around his daddy's back and hugged him tightly. He rested the side of his head on Steve's shoulder.
“I know!” Tony declared, “We can give the mice to Barton. He has a son right? Him and the mice can frolic on the farm.”
"Steve it's- Tony's… Tony's not going to- to come home… ever again…"
She stroked his cheek lightly with her thumb and kissed his nose.

Steve and James were late and she was stressing about Tony's Little State. The two avengers were a day overdue and Natasha wasn't sure how much anxiety Tony could still handle in a tiny four-year old body. He wasn't equipped for that. Tony's anxiety would be worse as a Little and Natasha had never looked after him long enough to sooth Tony once he got to that state.
worse, Steve!” He clutched the broom tighter for emphasis.
After supervising him undercover as Natalie Rushman, the spy couldn't stop herself from falling in love with just about every aspect of Tony, just like many others had done.
He let his voice travel to a whisper, smiling fondly at His Love before settling down so sleep could wash over him too.

On that note, thank you SO SO MUCH to EVERYONE who stuck around with me while I wrote this fic and being so patient and supportive! I really didn't think this story would blow up and be the most popular of my works, but thank you to each and every one!
No sooner had the words left her mouth, did Doctor Strange come walking through the door to the waiting area.
"But I -"
But Steve’s lips were soft and gentle; domineering, and yet careful. Guiding Tony. Pushing and pulling like the tide with the crescent moon.
"Does that mean-?"
No! No, I- I just want- Wait I’m feeling – I'm feeling a little –“
A bristle of Steve's body at the mention of Doctor Stephen was not lost on Tony. The brunette internally rolled his eyes at that.
"Why? He made it for you" Tony retorted, a bit harshly.
Tony sighed in his hold. “You’re incredible Steven Rogers,” he murmured. Steve kissed Tony’s head.
He chuckled at Tony’s adorable pout, clearly not understanding what was happening.
He shook his head in disbelief.
Tony giggled, hopping in.
Steve held Tony's gaze and replied earnestly, "Me too."
His eyebrows scrunched up, his gaze wandering away. Nat leaned in attentively - it was always miraculous to hear these things from Tony.
They all then made their way to the entry hall to say goodnight.
The war was
I see your cute butt on the floor,
"Hey Capsicle," his whisper almost blew away in the air.
'Please no... Steve...
Steve held onto his genius tightly as the tears flowed.
“Your dad’s my one and only,” he murmured, gazing into those brown, intelligent eyes.
"Nat," he wheezed out, "Remind me why, exactly, I'm in a death grip again? Do I need to fill out my will?"
Tony hitched in another breath as the words left Steve's mouth. The soldier didn't open his eyes, but, he held up one of his own arms and covered Tony's hand with his own, holding it in place with enough grip to make his message clear: he never wanted Tony's touch to leave him!
This was the moment.
for it. He smelled
“I love you most.”
It was true, so that meant that Steve would protect it. He would protect Tony. He would cherish Tony and fuss over him, he would be a sickening mother-hen and spoil him day after day!
Tony whimpered and he clenched around Steve as the blonde bottomed out in one stroke!
“I like it,” Tony blushed.
Tony was running on ten cups of coffee within the span of six hours on his second day of pulling an all-nighter. He had J.A.R.V.I.S on mute ever since this afternoon after his fight with Nat when the AI suggested that he call James Rhodes or Dr. Banner down to the garage.
, please – please don’t cry. Please, I
"So… you're saying that something Steve did, helped Tony wake up?"
as he looked into the amount of love his daddy's eyes held for him.
Quit the silence
Steve’s surprise was clearly evident on his face.
His chest heaved as his tears fell. Steve's whimpering echoed in the room. And Pepper, overhearing, didn't have the heart to stay mad at a grieving Alpha any longer.
“Perfect! Give me at least twenty minutes and I’ll be up there before Aragorn can give another motivational speech!”
Steve wasted no time engulfing Tony in the biggest bear hug, cradling the brunette's head beneath his neck.
But, as you go closer, you would see care, worry and a softness for every living creature.
“Uh… yeah, technically…” he replied, unconvincingly.
Sparks flew up every nerve in Tony's arm it and lit up his core with more fire.
The car door flew open with Steve yelling, “Happy, you gotta drive to the hospital
Steve's eyes widened even more in shock.
He worked fast, not wanting to prolong the awkward silence between them.
Steve closed his eyes as he leaned into Tony's hand and he gasped out, thickly, "
He and the basket were knocked to the floor and all Tony’s groceries spilled over the tiles!
"Sorry," Nat replied, "Force of habit. Although I find it more amusing when the victim is 'in the zone' like you." She flicked him a cat-eyed grin.
"Why Steve?" Tony repeated, "I'm- I'm nothing special to you."
"Come on," Steve chuckled, squeezing Tony warmly, "let's go back home and I'll make sure to give you some hot coco and we can snuggle on the couch."
The soldier carefully transferred the boy into his arms and waved goodnight to his teammates.
Her gaze locked on him, cool and lethal.
He gave Tony one last kiss on the forehead before looking up at the ceiling and called softly, "You know what to do, Jarvis."

When an alpha or a beta would give their knot without protection, it meant that both partners fully trusted each other and were ready to take their relationship to the next stage.
Five seconds in which Tony held on to Steve's hand. A soft and gentle grip that made Tony feel grounded and yet elated at the same time.
Then Steve saw his shield.
"It sounds like this movie has a lot of great symbolism!" Steve breathed out a laugh.
He looked into Tony's deep chocolate pools that were glossed over and shining with unshed tears, and Steve's own eyes softened to the baby-blue color of a summer day.
was something she'd always treasure.
*                 *                *
“Even superheroes like you need some help sometimes,” the captain finished, placing a kiss on Tony’s cheek.
Tony smiled warmly. He held out his arms, nodding to Steve.
"Uhm," Steve pulled back quickly, snapping out of it, "Do- do you need help with the… with the bandages?" Standing up briskly and walking around the room, Steve found some padded bandages and held them up awkwardly.
Steve could precisely pinpoint the second of terror in Tony’s eyes before the omega’s body crumbled to the paving.
The spy had cursed all who had ever harmed him as she rocked the sobbing brunette gently from side to side; rubbing his back and playing with his hair until his sniffles began to quiet down.
The rest of the night followed fairly well, with the only inconvenience being a sharp shooting pain in Steve's stomach that made him throw up until early morning. Bucky and Sam had half a mind to take him to the hospital, but after taking a couple painkillers, Steve brushed them away and said goodnight.
Steve's voice broke through Tony's reverie. He shook his head, side to side and looked around Steve's suite...
You love me and I know it's true; I believe it. I trust it! And I'm sure of that, because... because
wrong Aunty Nat," the little brunette blushed and ducked his head sheepishly, embarrassed that he would make fun of Steve when he wasn't there.

didn't listen. I didn't believe you when you said that something big was coming. And look what it cost me. Oh dammit, Anthony Stark, I thought I lost you again."
"I… I couldn't stop him, Steve… I - I couldn't and… and I couldn't even bring myself to call you, I-"
His mouth watered as Tony’s scent enticed his inner alpha. “
Finished! Haha 😅
Tony blinked, dumbfounded.
“Honey, where’s Thor?”
He paused.
Tony must've caught on.
“I- I mean, I- yeah… I could do it if- if you want… ” he rubbed the back of his head shyly. Everyone still shot each other side glances.
He swept a glance across at Nat's car and sure enough, she was on his toes, keeping as fast a pace next to him. The
“Oh Honey- Honey,
"Oh, well aren't you a golden boy," his father sneered.
He shot up like a rocket, pressing a huge kiss to Nat’s forehead and sprinted off to his floor.
Tony basked in the movement.
He scuttled a little closer. She made no sign that she wanted him to stop. He shuffled closer and closer until he could place his head on her shoulder. Tony let out an adorable squeak, to ask if he could go further. Nat looked down into his doe-eyes and couldn't help but grin fondly. She nodded and tilted her head so Tony could breathe in her scent where it was strongest at her gland.
Steve placed a kiss on Tony's nose, "And I wouldn't have it any other way. Come on, let's go get that coffee and a bite to eat."
However, Natasha thankfully averted the attention from Wanda, shooting her a comforting smile, but looked back on Tony. He was more at ease now that Thor was asleep and contained.
Steve's touch was
But Barton wasn't stupid,contrary to popular belief. He'd figured out that the intensity of Natasha's stares was caused,
"Tony?" she whispered softly, "Oh, my kotynok, you could never be responsible for your daddy's death! Steve
It’s like you’re still here
And their voices chase away the quiet
He opened his eyes to see Steve glowing above him in the afternoon sunlight! He looked angelic.
“Steve! I was wondering where you were,” Nat kissed his cheek as soon as he entered the living room. She ignored, for his sake, the tear tracks and his red nose.
I mean- uhm, wanted to make something...
“My Tony,” he murmured happily.
we know doesn't know how to have fun then, does he?"
She paced fiercely across the living room and debated whether or not to call Pepper or Rhodey for back-up. But Tony wasn't dumb - even as a four-year old. He'd know something was wrong if Rhodey just pitched up here off-schedule.
Becoming a bore.
With Tony blinking wide-eyed in Steve's oversized clothes, Steve himself couldn't help giggling softly at how lucky he was to witness his adorable boyfriend.
“Come on, at least come to movie night,” Steve prompted gently.
“Why are you really helping me, Steve? Is this some sort of dig at me? Saying that you like my smile and-“
" Tony hugged himself into a ball, he gripped his knees and rocked himself... back and forth... back and forth... as he repeatedly called out to his Daddy Steve while still in the aftershock of his nightmare.
She placed a kiss in the boy's dark curls and hugged him closer. But Tony was still nibbling his lip between his teeth. His brows were scrunched up in worry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony barked out a laugh, "I like this possessive streak, Stevie! I missed that filthy mouth of yours too!"
"You're looking over Tony's file?" she asked curiously. The doctor nodded.
He never wanted to let go of this feeling!
extremely overprotective of him.
She had never heard of anything like it.
"So I'd better see some ID in the next five seconds before I have Clint drag you down the street by your shins," she finished, ignoring Tony and not breaking her eye-contact from Steve.
The captain felt so small under her soul-burning glare.

**                       *                         * *
But just as Steve relaxed into the hug, Tony immediately snapped out of it.
"I love you too," he whispered, kissing Tony's forehead slow and sweet.
Natasha simply blinked, needing more information.
“Then I’ll sleep when I’m dead! Just let me finish this Steve!” he pleaded.
The little girl smiled, “To be honest, he wasn’t a good storyteller. Mom had to help him most times, but when he was
Steve huffed out a laugh and Tony smirked, grateful that his Capsicle could still laugh at his jokes.
Like Tony, Natasha had the magnetic ability to make herself larger than anyone in the room, despite being a head shorter. She made her presence known. And Steve felt remarkably like his pre-serum, scrawny self as he was hoisted a few centimeters off the floor!
My head is a mess
Steve felt
He then looked up to the ceiling.
” Steve replied firmly, “You’re caring and selfless and intelligent, and you’re scared that if you aren’t perfect, people are going to leave you, because you’ve never had someone love you as you are, but believe me when I tell you that I want to be one of those that
Tony's head was bowed as he tried to control his falling tears and pained whimpers.
Nat crouched down low and slow, maintaining steady eye-contact the whole time.
Tony's eyes widened and he giggled happily at Nat's story. It was the best sound the spy had ever heard.
Nat shot him a sympathetic look at the anxiousness in his tone.
“Yeah?” he murmured softly.
Steve gasped.
She had fought against it for two whole days after Tony’s heat had passed, but the brunette was stuck on the statement that she deserved something completely amazing for putting up with him. He hated how useless he must’ve been in heat, relying on Nat like a pup and not being able to function properly. It was a low blow to be such a burden on Nat. And Tony had to make up for it.
Everything in Steve wanted to scream at the brunette, but he’d learned quickly that it would be futile with Tony. Instead, he took a deep breath in and, without looking away from the genius, he called, “J.A.R.V.I.S, unmute.”
"Well, I guess anyone covered in that amount of oil and grease must know what he's doing," Steve replied, flipping up his eyebrow.
awesome A-Aunty Nat, but I... I just miss Daddy!"
Tony did have his nanotech armor with him, so one wrong move and he wouldn't be fooled by Steve again!
Natasha was nothing if not surprised.
"Oh, my
"Believe whatever you want to, Nat," he sighed, "All I care about is wanting to make it up to the omega I love. Even if I have to go through you and the whole world."
“With what, exactly?” he asked, ignoring how high his voice went. Bucky snickered.
So, when it finally formed, Nat wasted no time.
Clint face-palmed for probably the hundredth time in the span of only six minutes, while Bruce and Wanda snickered to themselves.
'A smile as slippery as a snake's,' thought the captain.
She clocked her head to the side, her eyebrows raised.
For such a petite figure, you really pack on muscle!" the blonde teased.
And then it all came back into him. Like the shock you feel in every nerve once you plummet to the ground in a dream.
Steve shrugged, lifting up the box on the counter.
Still…
Ever.
It was thrilling.
to be my friends- my make-shift family. Now, I’m going back down to the garage. And please-“
“So,” Steve started, hesitantly, hoping it would partly break her anxiety of the building, “What did you want to talk about?”
Steve exhaled. '
!' he wanted to scream so desperately!
Her skepticism was present, but she didn't let it show.
As soon as Happy pulled up outside, Steve was out of the limo carrying Tony protectively through the doors, to the front desk.
The captain was a very good amateur actor, Tony would give him that. But being trained by Nat when they went on missions together had it's perks in that field/area.
“This is new,” Tony murmured sleepily.
"Yeah, yeah - sure thing, Nat," he croaked out, his voice rising an octave, "No problem at all. If anything, I'm the one who's safer with Bucky--it's never the other way around."
The alpha brought a fist to his mouth, willing the lump in his throat to pass, blocking the tears, "He said that Tony had made a statement in his will that if he passed, but he still remained fertile, he'd given his egg cells to me, so I could do what I wanted with them… back when we were still partners… Well, naturally I didn't have a single clue what to make of that."
sorry," he cried his voice croaked with his overflowing sobs, "I'm so sorry I did this to you! And I know I'm a coward for saying while you aren't awake, but I'm hoping some part of you is aware of what I'm saying. I'll say it again anyway once you wake up. If you'll see me. I doubt you'll want to, so I'm really hoping you hear me now, so I use my small chance to apologize. I have at least six pages of a letter written for you and a song."
If you were bonded, then that would be a different case, but you are not listed as Mr Stark’s closest kin, so I cannot let you see him now,” the nurse’s name tag read Jenny.
at that point!
The soldier lightly placed his hand over Tony's cheek, tenderly stroking his skin.
” she muttered.
Steve smiled, "I quite like the sound of that. But, now that you compliment
Taking in a huge breath, Tony rapped on the door as hard as he could.
Tony gasped softly. He'd never heard such sweeter words spoken to him!
, then they want something. Be it sex, money, or just being friends with benefits - you name it. And I don't care for complications, so I'm gonna need a solid answer on what we are. Just… please."
As Steve headed to the elevator, Natasha called to him on her way to the kitchen, "Steve, as soon as you've put Tony to bed, I need your help with the dishes, okay?"
“You wanna go down to watch Harry Potter with the others, or stay here and let me read you to sleep?”
I just feel so carefree and light and… it's just amazing, Nat!"
time this month you’ve pulled an all-nighter, for three nights straight and I’ve had about enough! I will
," Tony wailed, his voice thick with tears as they ran like rivulets over his face.
He paused on the landing, shrugging off-handedly, “Maybe. I don’t know... I’m not really sure. I don’t even know if you’ll like it, but I’m just so happy to be home and see you!”
"Relax Rogers, I'm not going to bite your head off. God knows you've probably had enough of that. I just wanna know how you are? How you're taking this? I know this might come as a shock to Bucky as well."
The next words out of Nat's mouth made Steve's blood run cold:
"Well, now's the time to change that," Nat shrugged nonchalantly. She could try all she might to hide it, but Steve saw how pressed she was going to be on the matter. Although he couldn't figure out why she was so determined on it…
As Steve stroked the genius' hand caressing the side of his own face, Tony could only remain seated and look in awe at the peaceful expression that enveloped every inch of Steve's face.
*                  *                 *
Steve groaned, clutching fistfuls of his hair.
Tony looked happy with him. His smiles were all dopey and he was blushing non-stop! His eyes sparkled brighter than Natasha had ever seen.
A little bit of fear. Some hesitation that was hidden behind three stone-walled facades of seriousness to cover up the vulnerability lying beneath. Tony would
It was like the time machine worked. They'd gone back...
Tony shrunk deeper in fear and whined as more slick dribbled from his hole instinctively. A more dominant alpha was in his presence and his biology forced him to submit.
“I’m sorry Mr Rogers, I
"No," the blonde responded, equally as stubborn, "then I'll clean you up. And we're not done with this until you tell me what happened."
supersoldier!
Steve suddenly heard howling laughter beside him and saw tears of joy run down Tony's face! He was crying with joy!
And sensitive and sweet
Like the push and pull of the moon on the ocean tides, the kiss was sensual and powerful!
He was panting heavily. A thin sheen of sweat covered his body in a cold flush.
“Anytime I get scared, I picture a small knight in shining armour, who looks an awful lot like you, carrying a glimmering shield and sword and I know he’s coming to protect me. He inspires me to be brave, and I love him so much, so I want to make him proud.”
So it was so
"You can have me in your arms
"I- I uh..." He cleared his throat, "I thought I'd- I'd
“What’s the occasion?” he asked.
Steve chuckled.
came into this world, little Morgan! And you are
Tony... You're--you're so hot and tight!" Steve grit out as he pistoned in and out of Tony's hole relentlessly.
Tony’s intelligent eyes gazed up at him.
"We both agreed that I'd wait outside while you go in to visit and that's what I'm sticking with," and with that, Steve turned and briskly walked back down the corridor.
And Tony knew it.
Steve woke up to the feeling of someone, or something, gripping his leg and shaking it frantically.
“Steve, I know we’re retired, but you should definitely open up a bakery!”
It was only around midnight, but something felt off to Tony.
“Always willing to do what makes you happy, Sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S replied smugly.
"D-Daddy I love y-you so m-much! You can't be d-de-" Tony choked up, "P-Please you c-can't b-be-"
“Oh, that’s such a relief,” Tony sighed, jumping down, “Steve, you are definitely my knight in shining armour. I can’t thank you enough for - wait a minute.”
"And you thought to take a crack at it," Nat finished, nodding, "Well, you're looking at his right-hand woman. So what's your preference, Brooklyn boy?"
So the next chapter will contain the more intimate parts of the fic, but the scene in Endgame is just so beautiful and intense to a Stony shipper like me, so I would like to take my time and write it out perfectly, but expect an update as soon as possible!
"Knotting is special… but, you didn't finalize the bond. By biting your mating glands I mean. I would've felt or smelt that much. So… it
Steve hated it!
I will go over it, proof-read it and edit where I see fit, but until then...
Steve rocked them slow and gentle.
"Why thank you, Mr Stark. I learned from the best."
**              *               **
She hated that question. And she hated the answer she had to give too.
Each question became increasingly more morbid and each news article equally more disheartening.
And that brings us to the end of this fanfic! 😝 I hope the last chapter was what you were looking for, but, if not, then I apologize and will try to upgrade my writing skills in that area of genre😅
"Thank you, Tony," Steve replied, voice full of honesty, gratification.
It was the strangest thing to Nat to see her friend sleep so soundly, to appear so calm, when his mind could be a whirlwind of storms that they couldn't even see. The team stood heartbroken as each of them brought 'get-well-soon' cards and gifts. Thor broke down completely, blubbering like a small babe when he caught sight of his frail teammate lying so small and helpless in his bed.
She needed Clint's help!
beloved back in one piece! If you do that, you will come home to
He looked up, watching for Steve's reaction.
Feigning obliviousness, Steve called out to the silent room, “Oh, I sure do hope my brave superhero is alright! I’d like to run him a nice warm bath to take away all his worries.”
"Tony, what's happened? Why are you scre-
It caused Steve to laugh heartily, peppering soft kisses over Tony's face and neck until the genius was squealing with joy.
"Really!" she whispered back, smiling, "You have no idea how many times I've seen Uncle Bucky physically drag him away before he changed his mind and decided to take you as a stowaway!"
Steve still felt choked up  while trying to heave in some deep breaths.
Nat began to softly sing one of Tony's favorite Russian lullabies as she combed through his dark curls.
“How can I make you believe me?” Steve pleaded.
much fun when we spend the day together, Antoshka- it's unexplainable! You're
sorry, I don't know - I don't know why I - I just - Oh, God, I messed up- I didn't mean to - I didn't mean- I just-"
"Me too," said Tony, softly.
It was Tony's nano-tech arc reactor that he'd shoved into Steve's hands the day he'd touched back down to Earth.
” he said, “Oh no, no, no- this is way worse!
“Did you find the little squirt?” Tony called.
But Steve was living in one!
His smile was cheeky, but Steve saw right through it.
Tony hissed and arched higher into the touch. Steve rolled Tony's balls between his fingers while he continued to mark Tony's throat. Tony felt so hot and flushed. His senses were screaming
“Aw, Steve!” Tony launched himself deeper into Steve’s arms, cuddling closer and feeling his heartbeat.
