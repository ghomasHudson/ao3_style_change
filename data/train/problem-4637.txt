"That looks bad." Sam said as Dean opened one side of his shirt to ice the deep purplish bruise on his abdomen. "How's your breathing?" Sam asked with that pinched clinical concern.
“I don’t know...you’re like one of the cool kids, like a jock...I didn’t expect you to geek out over a fairy tale.  That and you’re a guy.”

from his bedside table.  Dean settled in beside him shoulder to shoulder.  Cas was momentarily distracted as Dean licked the length of the peppermint stick.  He read until a contagious yawn escaped Dean’s lips followed by one from Cas.  “Come on, we should get some sleep.” Castiel helped Dean to his feet.  Dean stumbled against him.
No couch.
Dean couldn't help but be slightly turned on by Cas
"Can I try to make it better?"
’, far too chipper for Dean’s morning disposition.
He came rushing around the row of cubicles, sloshing his water bottle: shirt wrinkled and half un-tucked, his backpack thrown over one shoulder. He clicked his keyboard until his monitor came to life.  Charlie, who was in a constant state of perkiness, even on the morning shift of a Saturday popped her head over Dean’s cubicle.
“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?”  Cas’ face turned somber and he looked down.
“Sure thing, anytime.”  Cas blushed again and Charlie cleared her throat.  Luckily the three of them were saved by the incessant ringing of the phone.
“Thank you, Dean” Cas grits before disappearing into his room for the night.
“Yeah, sure…”  Dean rasped.
- that Cas was going to kiss him.  “Dean - can I ask you a question?”
“You’re welcome, Dean.  See you at work.”
“I’m good here.”  Dean said taking the plate from Castiel.  “This smells delicious.”  Dean warmed his hands against the warmth of the bowl.  Castiel sat down next to Dean on the ground, both of their backs  leaned against the recliner.  Castiel flipped through the stations on the tv.  He was going so quickly Dean wondered how he could even tell what was on.  Dean stopped him when he passed up
“Yeah...just let me grab my coat.”  Dean disappeared into the office.
A few beats of silence from both ends.
Dean kept his hand on Castiel’s shoulder, leading him back to his room.
“Come on...we’re both adults.”  Dean tugged on Castiel’s elbow - making him lose all train of thought.  “We can be mature about this - share the bed - like two grown men.”
Castiel ladled out his soup and buttered two slices of bread.  Dean was sitting cross legged in front of Castiel’s recliner.
“Yeah but you’re like a guy’s guy, you like football and manly stuff, that’s just not me…”
“I wouldn’t mind.”  Cas said. “I’m an early riser.”  Cas gave a gentle smile before lowering his eyes.  The bashful little expression tugged at Dean’s heart and made it flutter in a way he wished it wouldn’t
- bye.”
Cas could hear Dean’s grin through the phone and even that made him blush. Cas was a goner and it was all Dean Winchester’s fault.
“Doesn’t matter to me - you pick.”  Dean crawled into bed landing pretty much in the middle without picking a side.  He figured Cas would chase him out of whatever side he actually wanted to sleep on. The bed dipped with the weight of Cas as he laid beside Dean.  He was careful to keep space between them even though they’d been leaning against each other most of the night.  It took Dean forever to fall asleep as they both tried not to disturb each other.
Cas nodded.
He walked into the kitchen to find Cas standing in similar clothes over the stove.  Cas handed Dean a mug of hot chocolate with a peppermint stick poking out the top.  He followed him back to the bedroom and they both sat on the floor in front of the fire.  They talked and laughed until the mugs were drained and the fire started to die down. Dean stoked it adding another log.  “Read something to me, Cas.”
“Yeah?”  Castiel’s eyes went wide with disbelief, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
“You’re skin is irritated and dry, that’s why it’s itching.”
“Well, I don’t live too far - just at the bottom of the hill there’s a path that leads through to my apartment.  I was just about to walk home.”
“It’s a little after 6:45 am, just like you asked.”  The grit of Castiel’s early morning voice was definitely helping to wake up a certain part of Dean’s body.
“No Dean - I didn’t mean it like that - jeez…”
Saturday morning wake up calls quickly became a tradition that both Cas and Dean looked forward to.  Dean even started going to bed earlier on Friday’s so that he was awake when Cas called.  He loved their little talks.  Cas opened up more when it was just the two of them.  Dean wished he could get him alone more often, but he hadn’t found the courage yet.  They were lost in conversation when Dean noticed the alarm clock.
Cas checked the time and realized it was close to the time Dean should have another dosage of pain meds. He clicked off the tv and left the remainder of ice cream on the tv stand to melt. He was going to wake Dean up and kiss it better. Cas turned on the bed side lamp and sat in the open space next to Dean. He didn't want to startle him awake knowing far too well how that could end up. In time, Dean woke up with a slight jolt.
“It’s about damn time, you two.” Sam said shaking his head with a smirk. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Dean look this relaxed. “I just want to say that I’m totally cool with you guys, but if any more clothes are gonna come off, please remember to close the door. Sam turned to leave quite pleased with himself and his
Dean wasn’t there yet.
Castiel retrieved a well worn copy of
“I like the movie...I just didn’t think that someone like you would…”
"Where else does it hurt?"
“No you are…” Dean said rocking into him as it became clear that no one was going to win this fight.  They were snowed in for two days without power but luckily they had plenty of firewood and each other to keep warm with.
“Well, where was my wake up call?  You’ve not once called me to wake me up like you promised you would.”
Dean let him go. He stripped down to his shorts and burrowed under the covers and let himself drift into a state of no longer consciously existing.
brat like you.”  Dean teased.
“...How did you know I liked to read?”  Castiel looked up at Dean for the first time putting the lid back on the pot of soup.
Castiel's eyes briefly darted up to meet Dean's but he didn't return the smile.
Dean happens upon Cas in the hallway. He is stretching and reaching for the center of his back but he still can’t reach the part that itches. He arches his back finally getting some relief as he scratches himself against the door frame. “Here, Cas - “ Dean interrupts the silence. Cas starts a bit and then turns his back to give him access. Dean curls his fingers scratching the length of Castiel’s back. He feels Cas shiver beneath his hand when he hits the spot.
Dean rolled over so he could hold the phone closer to his ear.  “What time is it?”  Dean asked while rubbing his eyes.
“Yeah!”  Dean huffed into the receiver.  Cas could tell he was annoyed.  Why had he volunteered to be his alarm clock?  People hate their alarm clocks.
- trapped in the snow with a cute guy making him soup.  When he walked back into the kitchen, Cas handed him a beer.  “Soup will be ready in a few minutes.  I just cleaned the sheets earlier this week.  You can take the bed...I can sleep in the recliner.”
"Me too." Cas pressed kisses to the top of Dean's head. " I would like very much to stay right here - with you." They barely let go of each other as they re-arranged themselves under the covers a few moments later, and comfortably fell asleep.
“What about you? - I didn’t know you were still down here working - last to leave?”  Dean gestured at Cas.
“Ah - memory foam - it’s settled then…”  Dean said smiling.  He was flirting with Cas and Cas was taking it well - he needed to calm down.
“Dude! There is no way I’m taking your bed - after all you’ve done.”
“Look…” Cas looked down, scratching the back of his neck.  “Why don’t you come home with me?”  Castiel looked up at Dean and then away again.  He’d had a crush on Dean for a while - but this had nothing to do with that.  It wouldn’t be right to leave Dean helpless here without a decent meal or a shower, not when his home was so close.  “My home is not much to see - it’s fairly small but I’ve got a shower and a fireplace and homemade chicken curry soup in the fridge…”  Castiel was trying to convince him but Dean hadn’t objected.
Cas nodded as he began to understand. "I do miss my grace. And I miss my wings. I just hate that I'm not of use to you, like I was before. I don't know who I am without being an angel. I don't know what my purpose is."
“Which side of the bed do you sleep on?”  Dean asked.
“You’re late…again…every Saturday almost.”  Charlie observed.
“Oh.”  Dean nodded.  They were both quiet for a moment but neither were in a hurry to leave each other’s presence.
“Well - there you go.”  Charlie gestured in Castiel’s direction.
'.  He didn't  have his grace, but this seemed to be something that humans could do. A quick google search confirmed "
"I know." Cas dropped his eyes again and returned to his work, as he meticulously went about prepping the wound and disinfecting the skin around the gash in Dean's forearm. "I just hate seeing you in pain and I hate that I can't fix it."
“Sammy!” Dean yelled, voice hoarse.
Cas paced in the library and then in the war room before he finally found himself getting a whole pint of ice cream from the fridge and heading to the tv room. All Dean wanted was to have him close, despite all of his failures and he couldn't even give him that. He flipped through the channels mindlessly while he ate ice cream until he was on the verge of a brain freeze. Numbing out with the tv and food seemed to be the coping mechanism of many a human who found themselves frustrated. Cas landed on a re-run of Dr. Sexy. He abandoned his own emotions and let the feelings of the characters on screen fill the void. A mother was trying to calm her terminally sick child. "Let mommy kiss it better....okay." Cas watched as the mother pressed a feather light kiss to her child's forehead. "All better?" the mom asked. Despite the child's illness still persisting, Cas was amazed to watch the child's tears dry up as they put on a brave face. "All better." the child confirmed.
“Hey, Cas.”  Dean called out before Cas hung up.  “How do you take your coffee?”
Dean walked in behind Charlie, more than 10 minutes to spare.  Cas felt his chest tighten at the sight of him, two coffees in hand.
. "I just want you close." Dean smoothed his thumb over the inside of Cas' wrist silently imploring him for any small gesture of closeness. "Please."
Castiel opened the drawer to retrieve a long sleeved t-shirt and sweatpants that he handed to Dean.  “Seriously, I’ll be fine in the recliner.  I can sleep comfortably anywhere.”
They were working on a skeleton crew as it was because of the weather advisories but someone had to be there.  Castiel lived within walking distance of the office so he didn’t mind to stay a bit longer.  He went around checking on others and helping them meet their deadlines so they could get home safe.
Cas was kicking himself.  How did he manage to accidentally say
“Jeez Cas - I won’t bite, just take your shirt off and sit on the bed.” Cas unfastened the top two buttons before hauling the whole shirt up over his head, his hair mussed up in the process. Dean let his eyes trail over the bare, broad shoulders, the muscles taut and rippled from hip to shoulder. This was a bad idea. His back was red and splotchy in some places, with little patches of white flakes. Dean rummaged through his bedside table until he found some moisturizer. He sat on the bed behind Cas.
“Take your shirt off.” Dean said.
“That feels good, Dean.” Cas shuddered beneath his fingers. “I never realized how hard it was to be human…”
The apartment was cozy, small.  No dining room.  The living room was wall to wall book shelves and a small flat screen tv mounted on the wall opposite the kitchen.   Only one recliner across from the tv with a table next to it a stack of books on the other side.
“No, really, I’ve got an alarm clock.”  Dean huffed.  “I just have a bad habit of sleeping through it.”  Dean rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
Dean cut him off finally realizing. "No - No - it's working!" He said emphatically. "I just didn't realize you knew about this
"Here Cas - " Sam set down the bunkers first aid kit. Cas opened Dean's sleeve to see a deep gash that had been bleeding through his shirt.
“Okay.”  Dean said.
“Fine.”  Dean said - eyes radiating mischief.  “On one condition…”
and Dean was sure to let him know that he felt the same way after they saved Cas from the Empty - but they hadn't really done
“Still itches?” Dean asked while placing a hand on Cas’ hip to steady him. He raked his knuckles across Castiel’s back. Cas dropped the flipper in the sink and gave into to the relief of Dean’s hands on him.
Cas turned his palm over to hold Dean's hand back, his countenance softening as he locked eyes with him.  "I just need a little time to myself Dean, to get my head straight. I'll be back in a few hours." Cas gave a little squeeze before dropping Dean's hand and closing the door behind him. "Promise."
“Shit, sorry, I should have warmed it in my hands first…” Dean smoothed lotion over Castiel’s back giving extra attention to the particularly angry looking patches of skin. He prodded and kneaded into the bare flesh, letting his mind wonder and his fingers explore. He smoothed down Cas’ lower back and then dipped briefly into his waistband to rub small circles into his hips.

No, I think you’ve gotten a bit less stupid. Now you have a dick in your mouth keeping you quiet. Huh, Dean Winchester. I used to be good friends with him—a mentor, you might say; I taught him everything that makes him tick. Yes Dean: the macho star quarterback that gets all the ladies. He thinks that by getting in a couple of chicks’ pants and not giving a fuck about school makes him a bad boy. That’s true. Not every guy with a brain and a dick between his legs can pull that off. But he’s made one mistake: You. Dean was straight until he met you and now he’s going to toss away the reputation he’s worked so hard to build up. If I get any trouble from any of you Novaks, Dean’s paying the full price. It would be a shame if that pretty face got ruined…or if his Dad found out about you.

I'd usually ask your brother, Dean, because he's the pop culture guru, but I recently realized that I don't talk to you all that much and I thought that you deserve a more welcoming atmosphere from the juniors and seniors! (I hope I'm not coming on here too strong. I'm working on toning my personality down a bit). Anyway, I'm going to this advice column to choose for us before he comes over because if we don't have a small selection of movies picked out in advance, we're going to spend an entire hour trying to agree on something to watch. So Chuck likes sci-fi, comics and horror, I like romance and thrillers. What do you recommend?

I’m back home. But everything is wrong. I knew what I was signing up for when I did this, but I thought things would go a lot smoother than this, y’know? I didn’t realize that by taking one child away, I’d lose all of them. Uriel, the newest addition to our family that I had suggested for adoption, was given to some very kind folks. But that’s where the good news stops. Dad left, so the CPS took over and destroyed everything. There were just too many kids that I just didn’t have enough money to support. Cas, sweet Castiel, was taken away. It’s all broken now. Mike won’t look at me. Raph won’t stop crying. Little Zach doesn’t have a clue. Balthy ran out the door and he hasn’t come back yet. Anna must have snuck out to a party last night and she wasn’t here this morning. She doesn’t know about it and neither does Gabe and it’s just fucking eating me up inside. Just this afternoon, I told Gabe that he could stay at his friend’s house for the night and he asked to talk to Cas and I had to lie and say that he was at the fucking park or something. It’s terrible, but it could’ve been a lot worse. Today is my twin brother, Michael’s birthday, which obviously means that it’s also mine. We’re 18 years old. We’re legal adults now. Imagine the chaos that would’ve occurred if we weren’t? We don’t qualify for adoption, so we can’t adopt Cas back. Maybe it’s for the best? We’ll always be family, right?

To: The Girl Next Door
Oh Dean-o, is that you? I couldn’t quite tell between your comparing pie to porn and that lovely name of yours. You can go fuck a cactus. Give Sammy a kiss for me, will ya?
TO: Dean Winchester
“You’re eye is gonna stay in your socket. You’re good,” Dean snapped without the usual teasing tone he used on Sam after clearing Sam as okay.
Sam, Dean, and Cas even took him to Target to pick out things for his room. Cas eventually had to drag Dean away from Jack’s shopping because he kept making comments on the things he chose and how they didn’t match, or it was bad taste. He was trying to be helpful but Sam had shot him a death glare because he wanted Jack to pick what he liked. He was so easily influenced, especially by Dean, and this was Jack’s room. No one else’s. Jack’s brightly colored choices of wall decorations, lights, and the amount of faux fur bedding were a bit much if Sam was being honest, but Jack liked them which was all that mattered. After a while, they all got used to how brightly colored Jack’s room was that they didn’t even notice.
San fell asleep again and Dean was left with a quiet house. He had an AA meeting that night but everyone was falling asleep.
Cas still wouldn’t look at him. Dean sighed.
“Stay,” Jack said. Cas felt his heart warm. He slid off his shoes, and slipped into the empty space near Jack. Jack stared absently ahead listening to his music, while Cas rubbed his back. Jack’s eyes slowly drooped until he fell asleep.
Sam stared up at him confused. “What?” Sam blinked hard and started muttering to himself five things he saw in the room, four things he can hear, three things he can feel, and two things he could smell. Dean waited until he was finished grounding himself before repeating himself.
Cas nodded. “But you must be very quiet and not go in the room. Stay at the door.”
“Jack, I need you to listen to me for a second, okay?” Cas said. “Try to let me finish talking before you start talking.”
Sam sighed. Dean wasn’t supposed to have found about the college applications. No one was. Now Dean was mad.
Sam wasn’t taking too well to being awakened by physical touch these days. A few weeks before Sam had a particular awful flashback, and had been jumpy and afraid of touches ever since. Dean and Cas couldn’t figure it out, since Sam was always the most cuddly out of all of them. But Cas sighed and reminded Dean that Sam would talk about it when Sam wanted to.
“He has something called a migraine. It is a very bad headache. It makes everything hurt and he feels nauseous,” Dean explained.
Dean slowly drank the water, and ten minutes later it was gone.
“Sammy, you cannot sleep in this chair. Can you stand up or do you need the wheelchair so you can go to the couch?”
Dean moved from his relaxed position so he was sitting with his back straight. “I’m 21...sir. Our dad moves around a lot for his work. It’s really stressful for him, so I look out for Sam.”
“I’m good thanks,” Cas said without looking up.
Dean smiled softly. “Yeah, Cas, you used ‘make ends meet’ correctly.”
“He takes some medicine. He goes in a dark and quiet room. He sleeps. There’s not much to do but wait for it to be over.”
“Please Cas?” Jack pleaded.
Cas hadn’t seen Dean cry like this for quite some time, and it was after something truly awful.
Jack’s face crinkled. “What’s… nauseous?” He said the new word slowly.
Cas squeezed his hand in response, just as Jack ran in.
“Alright, enough of this. Can you stand up?”
“I’m gonna go check on Sammy.”
Cas’s hand stopped moving on the page. He held it out to his side and waited for Dean to place the glass into his hand. Cas still would not look at Dean.
He ran into down the halls to get to the kitchen, he was so excited. His bare feet slapping on the cold floor.
Mr. Oshan’s head snapped up, and Sam whipped around in the seat in front of the principal's desk. He quickly realized it was Dean, and then dropped his head, and ignored Dean’s attempts to make eye contact. Dean half expected to hear Sam say an exasperated “Dean”, for entering a principal's office in such a manner at a school. But Sam was silent with his long hair covering his face.
Sam was too dissociated, sleepy, and just generally out of it to be trusted to walk by himself. Dean coaxed him into the wheelchair, and wheeled him into the living room. Sam flumped himself onto the couch  Covering Sam with a blanket, and placing a pillow under his head, Dean watched Sam drift off to sleep quickly. Normally, Dean would rub Sam’s back, or run his fingers through Sam’s hair, but not today. It was starting to physically hurt Dean somewhere, in the pit of his stomach and the hollow of chest, that he couldn’t touch is baby brother. It had become such a part of their lives now, so much so, that Dean hadn’t noticed until he now that he can’t touch.
Jack nodded earnestly. “Yes.”
“Please De--”
“If you are going on some tirade in that head of yours about how you aren’t strong enough for this family, or you are supposed to be the pillar of strength. Or that you should be able to handle everything just fine, it’s bullshit. It’s complete bullshit, to put it quite frankly Cas.”
“Sam did not lie to you Jack. He was going to and wants to take you. He got sick. That is not his fault. No one chooses to be sick. It just happens sometimes,” Cas gently explained when Jack had calmed down enough to listen.
Sam stiffened next to Dean.
“Mr. Oshan….Sam Winchester’s principal?”
Well fuck.
Cas sighed. “He will be okay, Jack.”
Cas smiled softly. “Yes, I will help you get situated.”
Cas gave Dean a watery smile, before choking out, “If I were still fully had my grace, if I were not just barely an angel…”
“Yes,” Dean said hurriedly, waving his hand around even though the man on the other line couldn’t see him. “Tell me what the hell is wrong with Sam!”
“He’s asleep. He’s out of it. He’s ok. I just…” Dean managed to get out to Cas between hitching breaths that Sam was alright, before his breath started coming out in short, hard gasps.
Cas turned his attention back to the TV, ignoring his own despairing stress tears, running down his face and into Dean’s hair.
Sam sighed, and looked up at Dean for the first time. Dean saw the start of Sam’s black eye and internally grimaced. A quick silent communication passed through the two brothers
“How about we move off this floor now, hmm?”
Sam was sick. Jack didn’t know much about being sick but he knew what he saw on TV. On TV sick people die. Fear flooded him. He lifted his head up. “Is Sam going to die?”
He leaned down and picked up a pebble and threw it hard into the water. He kept throwing pebbles until his arm hurt. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, and texted his sponsor. Dean had been really wary about the whole sponsor thing, but he decided to give it a try, plus it was basically required. He hadn’t like delved into anything deep with his sponsor, but they were getting there. He typed multiple sentences, and get hitting backspace before landing on a simple sentence. .
Sam was starting to practically vibrate in the chair. Dean moved his the toe of his boot on to the tip of Sam’s.
Jack climbed into to his bed and grabbed the old ipod on his nightstand. He put the headphones in, and found the Christmas music Sam had put on there for him. Christmas music was almost always happy. He settled down against his furry pillows and sighed. Cas pulled the covers over Jack gently.
“Why don’t you go lie down for a little bit?” Cas suggested. Jack nodded and got up. He looked shyly at Cas. “Can...can you come?”
Sam pushed himself up with a grunt and his vision tilted.
“Yes, you can.” He pulled Dean’s hand to rest on the Cas’s chest. Cas breathed in and out deliberately and timed. Dean slowly managed to mimic Cas’s breathing, while Cas rubbed his thumb over Dean’s hand on his chest. Dean had avoided the panic attack, but he was still crying.
Sam sat at the kitchenette table staring blankly at his homework. Dean walked over and threw the bag of bread, and the jar of peanut butter and jelly already combined, that they had been eating for the last week onto the table. Dean turned around and went to a plastic bag on a chair, and threw Sam a bag of chips. Dean turned again and shuffled to his duffle, came back, and banged a can of salt onto the table.
Dean was already throwing cash onto the table and abandoning his half eaten sandwich.
“He lied to me? Why? Why would he do this to me?” He shouted, voice breaking on tears.
Dean shrugged. “Honestly neither do I. But sometime soon, yeah?”
TO: Dean Winchester
Dean cleared his throat. “Would that be all?”
Dean moved forward. “Jack! No!” Dean grabbed Jack’s arms and pinned them to his sides. He dragged Jack away from the table. When they were out of reach of anything to throw, Dean changed his hold into a bear hug. Jack cried and tried to get away. “Jack,” Dean said calmly into Jack’s ear. “You gotta calm down buddy. I know you’re angry and disappointed. I know you were really looking forward to this, but you gotta calm down.” Dean ran his hand up and down Jack’s arm.
Clearing his throat, Mr. Oshan, broke eye contact. He shifted in his seat and folded his hands together on the table, staring at them for a few seconds.
Now it's time for Cas to get some comfort.
Sam turned awkwardly around and muttered “thank you”, before following after his brother who was stalking down the hallway.
Dean smiled, and held Cas’s face with his hands. He took his thumbs and wiped Cas’s tears.
Jack didn’t know what to call what he felt. He knew there was a word for it. He just couldn’t remember. It was like he had no energy even though he had gotten a solid 4 hours of sleep.
Sam sunk further into the couch and threw his arm back over his eyes.
Thanks. I’ll see you at 8?
“What?” Dean said in shock from the other side of the table. Cas shook his head at him. One person talks at a time.
TO: Jacob Robinson
Dean climbed the steps, and pushed the bedroom door open slowly. Cas was lying on top of the made bed with a forest green comforter. He was on his stomach with his feet crossed, and was doing something in this sketchpad.
As they approached Sam’s room he stopped and bit his lip. “What is it?” Cas asked.
Dean made to get off the bed, before turning back to Cas. “I think we should talk about the whole ‘I must support everyone and I need to be an angel’ thing you got going on here, though…”
“Hey kiddo, there’s a rule about this remember? No sleeping in chairs.”
The principal sighed. “I did. I don’t know which version of events is correct. I am inclined to punish all parties equally.”
Cas nodded, “Just… stay calm this time, okay? He can’t regulate if everyone else around him isn’t regulating too.”
“Oh Cas,” Dean scooted closer to Cas slowly, giving Cas the opportunity to make it clear that he wanted more space. “Is that what this is about?”
The principal was blinking at Sam. Sam was still glaring at the principal not dropping his gaze from the principal’s flabbergasted eyes.
“Mr. Winchester, is it correct that you share guardianship of Sam with a John Winchester?”
Eventually Cas was in the room with an asleep, exhausted, cried out Dean resting on him, and one sick giant kiddo sleeping on the couch. Everything was getting hard again, too hard. But he needed to be strong for Sam and Dean, especially now that he was only Dean’s source of physical comfort.
Sounds good.
Dean leaned back in his chair again. “I assume Sam has a different version of events, sir?”
Walking back in the house, Sam was still asleep. He palmed his forehead again for fever. He still felt nothing even though had thrown up earlier. Dean was confused but he figured maybe he should try “counting his blessings” or whatever the fuck. It was time to check on Cas.
Dean walked into the room Sam had made into a makeshift office and library. They had painted it a pale, faint yellow, but at this point there wasn’t much wall left to see. Papers, clippings, drawings, printed items, Sam’s notes were pinned on almost every inch of wall space in the room. To Dean it looked like absolute chaos, but Sam understood what everything was, and got very annoyed if you moved papers around without asking. The papers on the wall ranged from everything about hunting information to Harry Potter to animal shelters to environmental racism to statistics…
Jack nodded. Dean let Jack go and snatched the pillow from Cas, and buried his face in it. He felt Cas lead him back to the table and guide him to sit down. He put the pillow on the table and pressed his face into it, breathing heavily. Cas rubbed his back.
“Jack… you and Sam are not going to the museum today. Sam is not feeling well,” Cas explained. Jack’s eyes welled up with tears. Cas grabbed his hands, “He will take you when he is feeling better. He is very upset too.”
Dean left the room while saying “I’m ordering a pizza for dinner.” He did not hear Cas mutter under his breath “and it is time to talk about your damn knees sometime soon”.
Dean smiled, and forced himself to not reach out and ruffle Sam’s hair. Sam sounded like a petulant five year old.
Jack looked down and wiped his nose on his sleeve. He looked up at Cas through his eye lashes. “Are...are you sure?”
“Cas?” Sam asked in alarm. “Hey, hey, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?”
Dean went out through the back door and wandered down to the lake with his hands in his pockets.
Jack rubbed his face on his furry pillow. It was one of his favorite feelings. Sam called it sensory stimulation, and that Jack sought it out a lot. Jack didn’t really get what he meant but Sam made sure he had lots of textures and colors to touch around the bunker. Jack snapped his eyes open in the middle of rubbing his face on the pillow. Sam!
“Whoa, whoa Sam. What are you doing?” Dean pushed him back down and placed his hands on Sam’s knees to prevent Sam bringing them over the couch to stand up.
Sam slumped in the passenger seat of the Impala, Dean was sitting stiffly and resolutely not looking anywhere but the road. Sam opened his mouth a few times to try and say his brother’s name, but failed until he finally screwed up the courage after the fifth try.
“I take it you’re Dean Winchester,” Mr. Oshan said, folding his hands together before placing them on the desk.
The glass of orange juice shattered without anyone touching it. Jack’s eyes flashed. He pulled his hands away and backed away from Cas.
“Hello?” Dean said into the phone.
He shot out of bed grinning. Today was finally Saturday! Sam was going to take him to an interactive museum, one where it was allowed to touch everything. Jack had been talking about it every day this week, and looking at the pictures of the place online. But the best part, which he kept to himself so he didn’t hurt Cas and Dean’s feelings, was that it was just going to be him and Sam. He loved Cas and Dean but Sam was the person he was closest to, and spending time alone these days was rare.
Sam’s head snapped up, “You’re going to punish the kid being bullied? He didn’t do anything but exist in that hallway. What kind of message does that send? We had an assembly about abuse yesterday, and now you’re going to punish the bullied kid like it’s his fault?” Sam glared.
Ha. Yeah...sure I guess that would be a good idea. I don’t wanna leave Sam and Cas alone though...and I don’t know what to do for dinner.
A wet spot was trailing down his cheek. Dean blinked in surprise; he hadn’t noticed he was crying. But now that he had noticed, he couldn’t get himself to stop. He couldn’t wake Sam, but he couldn’t be too far away either. Dean went into the Heinous Kitchen and sunk onto the floor, his back up against the cabinets under the sink and counter.
Quiet tears streamed down Cas’s face as Dean said. He pulled away from Dean’s chest to look into his eyes. “Thank you,” he said softly.
Dean stiffened in his seat. “Who’s asking?”
“What...what is wrong with him?” Jack asked, fingering the fur on the pillow.
Sam gets in a fight at school.
“No, buddy, it’s not,” Dean agreed.
“Well, Sam, you have a point. I will not punish the student being bullied. You will receive detention tomorrow afternoon. If you ever speak to me again in this matter, or if you ever involved in an incident like this ever again, I will personally make sure every single college you apply to hears about it.”
“His stomach is upset. It feels like you have to throw up.”
“No sweetheart. He will not die. Not everyone who gets sick dies. A lot of people get sick every day. They rest and get some medicine, and they feel better.”
Dean gave Cas a meaningful look. “Okay,” he said to Dean before focusing on Jack. “Jack… Jack can you come here and sit down for a second?”
“I want to see Sam.”
“For once in your life, shut the fuck up when someone tells you to shut the fuck up.”
Cas hurried over and bent in front of Dean. “Dean, what’s wrong? Is Sam okay?”
Dean’s head snapped to Cas and looked him over critically. “You’ve been crying for a while, why have you been crying and why are you crying now? What’s wrong baby?”
“He is sleeping right now. What would help, is if you could help me clean up in here,” Dean said.
“No, sir, we wouldn’t.” Sam mumbled.
Dean shook his head. “You aren’t going anywhere for a bit, kid. Sorry. Also, I think Cas needs a minute.”
The principal nodded. “That is all. Sam will recieve details of his detention tomorrow morning during homeroom”.
Jack sniffed and nodded. He quietly picked up everything he threw, and put it back on the table. Dean tipped the shattered glass and wet paper towels into the trash.
Cas nodded.
Jack sat up and slowly ate the granola bar. Dean kissed the top of Cas’s head.
“Yes, Mr. Winchester. According to the guidance counselor, Sam has a real shot here at getting into a good college on a scholarship. We wouldn’t want to mess that up, now would we?” He finished turning back to Sam.
A granola bar was placed in front of his eyes. “Eat, it will help you feel better.”
“Drink all of it, it will help you be less dehydrated. Then you will feel better.”
Cas hadn’t moved away, but hadn’t moved forward either. He sniffed. “Yes, I could...could heal Sam, or at least ease his pain and make him more comfortable. I could ease your pain too. I could just work situations so they work out, so that we can make ends meet every month, and more…Did I use that phrase correctly?”
I don’t understand. Do you want me to clap slowly? What for? Is it a reference to my earlier entry? You do realize that emoticons are different in the real world, right?

Damn son, why haven’t you gone to a guidance counselor? Or the police? Why the school newspaper? I’m not sure how much help I can be, since I’m supposed to keep this anonymous, but I’ll try. First off, what your father is doing is wrong. I’m sure that you are aware of this. This is not your fault; you’re just trying to help your family. Speaking of family, my wife and I have been trying to have a kid for the past couple of years, with no luck. She really wants to raise a family, but I just can’t provide that for her physically. Do you know where I’m going with this? It’s not a permanent solution, but if we contact the guidance counselors, your father, and the CPS, I think we can arrange something. No child your age should have so much responsibility on their shoulders. Talk the guidance counselor and mention what I said, she’ll direct you to me—we’re close.

I usually love this holiday, but not even my girlfriend can cheer me up right now. She’s worried about me. I wake up with these terrible nightmares, but Andy says it’s normal, or at least for him it is. The guy’s a nut. But maybe I am too. I keep on seeing the same thing: It’s a cold night and I’m surrounded by trees. My whole body hurts and it’s hard to breathe. I don’t know what to think. What do you think?

I Can’t,
Hey Snickers, you’re probably not interested in any freshman problems, but I don’t know who else to go to. You see, there’s this party that everyone’s going to, but I heard that you can’t show up without a date. Getting a date isn’t really the problem though. This girl asked me out and she’s really nice and everything, but I’m sort of interested in someone else. He’s a junior and is completely out of my league. My Dad is always hammering into my head that real men aren’t fags and that I should basically be a womanizer like my older brother. But I don’t want to take advantage of women and goddamnit, that guy is just…just… I’ve barely said 10 words to him and I think I’m sorta in love with him. But it’s not like he’d ever reciprocate the feeling, so…I don’t know, maybe I should just go with her? But I don’t want to give her the wrong impression. I also don’t want him to think that I’m not available. ‘Cause I’m not. Not in a relationship, I mean. Oh god, I’ve been rambling, haven’t I? I think I’m having some type of mid-teen crisis! Send help ASAP!

1. Kingsman: The Secret Service- This would probably satisfy you more than Chuck, but I had to put this on the list. It's got almost everything. There's ruthless action, cool gadgets that could count as sci-fi if you squint hard enough, subtle romance (and a ship between the main character and his mentor. I know you're into that kind of stuff), plenty of comedic scenes, and—the best part in my opinion—an actual friendship between a male and a female that doesn't turn into romance. Think of it as a cross between Men in Black and James Bond except the women are actual characters and not just love interests for the male protagonist.

It’s bad enough he doesn’t have any superpowers, but he also seems to have some type of multiple personality disorder considering the number of different actors that played him. Speaking of superpowers, it seems that I’ll have to snap my fingers and disappear because my writing time is up.

TMI Right,
He is 99.9% sure he didn’t spawn any offspring in his 18 years of living. Well, there was that one sort of crazy chick—
“Sorry, he’ll do that to any guy that wears a leather jacket,” a young woman says, picking the now giggling toddler up and into her arms. Dean, like he did with anything that could walk on two legs and buy themselves a drink, checked her out, bottom to top. She was wearing neon green flip-flops, tight sky blue skinny jeans, a pink-ish crop top, and a look on her face that said that he had full access to what was underneath her layers.
Kidding, I’m Not,
Dear Writer’s Block,
I'm in charge of the advice column now! I'd like to thank my handsome older brother, Dean, for shaping me into the bitch I am today, my sexy Gabe babe for dating me, and of course, the academy.

I don’t know what your problem is, and I’m not sure I even want to find out, but you can’t just take over this thing and post bullshit like that. There are kids as young as thirteen reading this. There are kids who hate what they see in the mirror and some who hurt themselves just to feel something… anything to distract them. So this is for everyone reading this newspaper right now. If you’re like that, have ever been like that—like me—listen up: Life isn’t about suffering and it sure as hell ain’t about death. It’s about being happy, and sometimes you have to struggle to achieve your happiness. But that doesn’t mean that you’re going to spend your life suffering until the day you reach your breaking point. You’re going to keep fighting until the day where you don’t have to anymore. You’ll sleep like a baby. You’ll be glad to see the sun rise for another morning. You’ll smile at the little things and appreciate them that much more. ‘Cause once you touch that light, it never leaves you.

The whole situation made him feel isolated, but in a special, just-between-us kind of way. One day he wished that it didn't, however. Other girls, other angels, didn't turn shades of black, blue, red, green, and purple. But maybe this was Dean's way of claiming him, as he had done to him years ago. As he said, gullible.

It had been a month into this affair, this secret arrangement that they kept. Dean would come late to breakfast with several women, but he was profiling them, he's noticed. The first had blue eyes. The second didn't even bother brushing their coarse, black hair. The third never appeared in public with him, insistent that he deserved better than a girl that would never let go of a large, bloodstained trench coat. Others were prudish, or stubborn, or gullible. Dean always came back for the real thing, confused as to why he ever left.

If anyone asked, Dean was not freaking out as he parked his Impala in front of the house at the end of the street. Every chill that was making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end pressured him to put the car in reverse and get the hell away from there, but he ignored the feelings of dread and dragged himself off of the familiar leather of the driver’s seat and out on to the driveway. He walks around to the front door and is sweating bullets as he attempts to build the nerve to go through with what he’s about to do. He’s about to chicken out when a little boy opens the door.
Hopefully.
