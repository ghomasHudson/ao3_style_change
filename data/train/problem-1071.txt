“Well, I don’t think it will kill me anytime soon. I have already checked that box off of my list of things to do in life. Even if I was alive my lungs would be as black as coal by now.”
Had John heard him correctly? Did he just say what he thought he said? Maybe he was losing his hearing early and possibly his mind.
“Sleep is not such a trivial thing when one does not need it so often. A practice I often did even when I was alive. It is not a priority of mine.”
“If I knew I would tell you. But I have no answers.” The car came to a stop and John peered out the window and saw the door of 221B waiting for him.
“First off my being able to walk in sunlight is limited to be honest. The more sated in blood I am I can be fully functional and can move freely in it. However, the longer I go without, the more susceptible I am to sunburn. In those instances I have to go out by the cover of night. I am not sure if there is a physical reason for this or even supernatural. The rest you have observed for your own eyes.”
“Considering the weight of your words I see you are concerned for your well being. And rightly so. Any man would be an idiot if he did not think of his well being before considering my offer. If you were to refuse you are free to go home and live out the rest of your days without any interference from me.”
“Afraid not,” He shook his head. “It has since been demolished and reconstructed into a housing complex.” The detective stood from his chair. Even though he often liked to indulge in visiting his past life it was better off not to get too caught up in it. It always served as a reminder that he was no longer there. Best to remove himself from the moment.
John’s pager went off shaking him out of his thoughts. So much for a lunch break. Duty called. He reached down, plucked off the pager from the waist band of his scrub pants and read the message. The coded words brought a thrum of excitement to him though at the same time dread as well.
“I see. Of course the victims were transferred to nearby hospitals. Yours being one of them.” Sherlock shook his head as if mentally scolding himself. “Well then this might be a slight problem as neither of us calculated this outcome to our day.”
Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed to be lacking in patience. In the time they had spent waiting he had managed to easily burn through half a pack of cigarettes. His continuous pacing and smoking did nothing to quell his anxiousness and frankly it was beginning to make John nervous himself.
"Straight to the point, my kind of man. You'll fit just fine here. The muggle I have in mind for you is a new one that has just been reported by a wizard who works in a hospital in London. He said there is a muggle who does detective work and has asked him if he could use the laboratory for his research and experiments. At first he thought nothing of it. Just thought he was working for the Scotland Yard. That is until he learned what this muggle really can do…and what he was investigating."
“Has your short time out of the army dulled your senses or did you not observe? He was planning to attack you! There was a knife in his coat pocket. And if I hadn’t been following behind, you would be the one dead, not him.”
John felt as fragile as a corn husk as he stood and walked out of her office. He nodded as she encouraged him to make another appointment as needed, and she offered to make him a weekly patient again. He shook his head at that but decided he would give it some thought. As uncomfortable as the sessions were, Ella seemed to know more than she let on.
“I was just… stopping by,” Greg said, treading the line between truth and etiquette. “It was nice seeing you.”
John had always scolded Sherlock for tuning Mrs. Hudson out, but now he couldn’t help but do the same. He was too exhausted to feel guilty about detaching himself from Mrs. Hudson’s side almost immediately when they arrived. He needed to finalize things, he reasoned, to make sure everything was right before the guests came. He had half an hour before the crowd descended and he would be stuck smiling and shaking hands and lying to friends and strangers.
His chest heaved, but he couldn’t cry. Maybe he had run out of tears. His eyes burned nonetheless, and he apologized to Ella. To her credit, she didn’t try to tell him it was all right. Nothing was all right. When he finally sucked in another deep breath and met her gaze, she was still staring at him, leaning toward him, challenging him.
As they grew up, their age difference both benefitted and hurt them. Five years wasn’t an impossible distance, but once they reached a certain age, John didn’t want to stoop to her level anymore. And still she was loyal, enthusiastic, and loving with all her heart. When John left abruptly for university, Harry was crushed. When he vowed never to return home, she must have felt so alone. He didn’t know about her sexuality until she contacted him to let him know that she too had left home and had a steady girlfriend. They never spoke about the interim years, but John knew she must have been miserable. University had been a convenient excuse for him, but he had been waiting to leave since his first crush on a boy when he was fourteen. He sometimes wondered what might have happened if he had been brave and stayed.
She paused as the crowd tittered quietly and John thought his ears might just melt off for how hot they were burning. “I never met Sherlock, but I’ve known John my entire life. Literally, since I was in nappies.”
Back at Baker Street, John wasn’t sure what to feel. He was relieved that the funeral was over, but he also felt panicked because now, it was all over. There was nothing left. Now he had to face the reality that Sherlock was gone. He left Harry with empty promises to take care of himself and call her. He made her promise to call him, in case she needed him. She agreed cordially, but they both privately resolved to find another outlet before turning to each other. Harry watched John walk into the flat, pausing briefly before finally pulling away.
No more quiet nights punctuated by the clink of glassware and the turning of newspapers, and perhaps the occasional small explosion.
“Shall I, erm…” Sherlock answered his question before he finished asking it. “Smile and wink,” he said decisively, dropping his hands to his sides. “I do that sometimes. I’ve no idea why. People
Upon thoroughly cleaning the fridge, cupboards, sink, counters, windowsill, oven, microwave, and table, John finally sat down with a slight sense of satisfaction. Yes, he had spent the entire day in his boxers, but he had accomplished more than he thought possible. The kitchen looked decent now, though a stack of post-it notes still littered the counter. John couldn’t throw them out yet. Another day, maybe. His stomach rumbled, and he realized that he had never even finished making his tea. He opened the newly cleaned fridge and found that it was mostly barren. He pulled out some bread and slathered it with jam, eating it over the sink so he wouldn’t have to wash another plate. He didn’t have the energy for that. John finished two slices of bread before putting everything away and dusting crumbs off his face and chest. He made a mental note to drop the packed boxes off at Bart’s. Maybe tomorrow.
The path branched off to another exhibit, a twisting metal sculpture on stilts that stretched up toward the sky amidst a field of tender early blooms. John checked his watch – they still had ample time to explore – and gestured toward the strange display.
“What else was he like?” Mary asked, watching John carefully for any signs that she was probing too far. She had read some of his blog, of course, and that painted part of the picture – but perhaps not a complete one. John was a private man, and Mary knew there must have been a million moments of intimacy that made up the magnificent friendship, like brushstrokes on a canvas. Perhaps John alone could see its beauty – that seemed lonely.
John rolled his eyes. They didn’t need to have this argument, and certainly not on such a public forum.
He could expound, laying bare the shame of his situation, but Sherlock knew. If he hadn’t known before, he knew now. That was one of the things he had always wanted to tell Sherlock, one of the things he didn’t dare admit to Ella. Sherlock had saved his life the day they met – Mike, really, had derailed him, and then Sherlock took that momentum and turned his life around. He had reached the end of his rope, he had nothing left to hold, and then Sherlock took his hand and ran with him. He still had bad days. There were days he found it difficult to get out of bed, and he
Sherlock secretly downloaded the video later on. He also made a backup for safety reasons. To be really safe, he made several copies and hid the five USB drives all over the flat. John knew that Sherlock would get the video so he left making backups to his boyfriend.
Chris only snorted but Sherlock tore open his eyes, visibly shocked. After two seconds of heavy blinking he lunged forwards, running around the table and trying to squeeze past John who would have none of that and deftly caught Sherlock´s upper arm, holding him back inside the kitchen.
“So bossy. I´ll show you your place.” Carefully adjusting his grip on Sherlock´s throat to avoid bruising the larynx, John started to press his fingers against the windpipe, reducing the airflow. “Look at me.”
John instantly knew Sherlock was lying. He saw the insecurity and vulnerability in Sherlock´s posture and his heart clenched with pity. What had they done to him that he was so brutally fragile under all this put-on cockiness? Sherlock was more bark than bite in order to defend his poor heart behind a wall of vitriolic “I don´t give a fuck” attitude.
Utterly unimpressed, Mrs Hudson just gave John a conspirative look and raised one eyebrow “So? You´ll better work
In his bedroom, John had kept staring for a while at the spot where Sherlock´s delicious bum had just disappeared around the corner of the door, lost in thought. Sherlock was really something else. A tough and spiky shell hiding a soft and delicate core.
John could not believe his eyes. Sherlock actually presented his arse like a bitch in heat. On purpose. Utterly shameless. A rest of foamy soap water ran out of his crease and slithered down along a pale thigh. It looked like cum. “This could be mine,” John thought.
,” at this John waggled his eyebrows in an ultimately not subtle innuendo, “I´ll expect it to be hot.”
Suddenly Sherlock remembered more and he hated the way memory came back in these tiny bits and fragmented pieces for him to put them together, forming the events of how they, they, had had sex last night. He and… John. Right. JOHN!
Mentally shaking himself, John set the towels on the nearby stool and carefully put the pack of condoms and the bottle of lube he brought from his room as well on top. Then he quickly stripped and stepped under the spray behind Sherlock. The touch of his half erect cock against Sherlock´s buttocks provoked a most welcome rush of blood, letting it stand up, now plump and pulsing.
Secondly, Sherlock had always loved dancing and had had years of ballet practice. He was lean and dextrous, moved gracefully and fluent while performing jumps and turns. Sherlock would well be able to manage the basic spins and holds at the pole if someone would teach him.
Sally´s lower jaw went slack. Saliva pooled in her mouth and threatened to spill over her lower lip. She sucked the fluid back in and swallowed. Watson´s muscles were nothing short of spectacular. She realized Philip had caught her red-handed staring transfixed when his eyes became jealous slits. Attempting to deflect she hissed, “If you´d work out at least a tiny bit, you could have something resembling muscles, too.”
“It´s not a dare because it will never come to happen,” Sherlock made a quick calculation, “but you´re on.”
There was no resistance encountered on its way inside. Pliant tissue, soft and so hot. Moreover, Sherlock´s hole seemingly sucked him right in as if there was a vacuum needed to be filled with
The acrobatic side has fascinated me for some time now, accidentally started by seeing a spinning pole performance to a David Bowie song called “Lady Grinning Soul” on YouTube. Awesome!
John watched the display in rapt fascination. Entranced by the iridescent soap bubbles which slithered over Sherlock´s marble skin. They glistened in all colours of the rainbow. John trailed a group of miniscule bubbles gliding downwards over wide plains of smooth skin and saw them getting diverted by Sherlock´s navel. A part got stuck in the tiny hollow while the rest split into half to slide further down on both sides of the stretch of tiny dark hair which widened into forming Sherlock´s pubes.
In a way it was universal justice that they would find their perfect movie couple on a crime scene. The walls of the office where two mutilated bodies had bled out, Sherlock deemed the case a seven, had been plastered with cheap copies of vintage movie stills and posters. Instead of being transfixed with the gory injuries of the victims Sherlock stared at a 1960´s picture depicting a barely clothed “man” and a woman in a tight silver bodice-thingy.
The assigned catering service had built up a really impressive buffet and faint music was playing in the background of the largest conference room available where a stage with a gleaming metal pole had been set up. Someone had put pink sticky notes depicting Sherlock´s head onto the device.
As it turned out, John did not have to worry too much on how to keep Sherlock from getting bored in between cases.
. He saw no reason to plunge himself back into the misery he was just started to escape. Moving on, in this case, had to mean cutting ties and starting fresh. But he couldn’t tell Greg no – that would lead to more questions. John gave himself a little time to mull it over, then he called Greg back and gave the detective his new address. Greg was cordial; John was the same. The old familiarity and warmth weren’t quite there, but Sherlock had brought them together in the first place. Without him, they had little in common besides an affinity for a bit of footy over a pint now and then.
Mary had caught a glimpse of the television before John had shut it off, and she eyed the whiskey that John had been sipping. It didn’t take a genius to put it together. The infamous Sherlock Holmes was frozen on the screen with a smile and a wink; his famous companion seeking warmth however he could. She walked up to John and reached out to rub his shoulder. A few seconds of silent massage wore down John’s defenses. When she saw John’s eyes close and felt his tense muscles release beneath her fingers, she quietly asked, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Erm.” He swallowed hard and sucked in another gulp of air. “Maybe.” His voice cracked as he made his decision. Instead of pulling away from her, he would lean in. “Yeah.”
“He knew, at least on some level, he knew what I needed. He wasn’t always the most intuitive,” John mused with a frown, remembering some of their various miscommunications over the years, “But he was good. He tried to help. And he did.”
“No, please, there’s just one more thing, mate, one more thing.” He hadn’t planned this. He hadn’t practiced this in his head. “One more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don’t… be… dead.” His voice broke and thickened with tears. “Would you do that? Just for me, just stop it.” He could almost always convince Sherlock to do something he didn’t want to, just for him. He felt his self-control unraveling as he gestured helplessly toward the barren ground. “Stop this.”
“Sorry,” he mumbled, his throat sore and strained from the night before. He tried to prop himself up just enough to placate her. “I, uh… passed out. Just exhausted. Slept on the sofa.”
As he climbed into the passenger seat of Harry’s dinged Volkswagen, he glanced across at her with a question that she answered before he could ask.
By the time he had slowed down enough to be able to focus on her problems, once again he was too embroiled in his own. He had just been invalided out of his career path, and he had to come to grips with a purposeless life. Harry had swooped in to catch him. She even gave John her old phone already programmed with her new number, but he hardly availed himself of it. He couldn’t afford liquor and he didn’t want to talk. That’s all she ever wanted to do. Things had gotten a bit better after John met Sherlock – they met up a few times between cases, spoke on the phone or through email, but they were never as close as they had been in her early childhood. He wasn’t sure they ever would be again.
“Of course I’m going to miss dinner. There will be people!” He turned away from the camera, then suddenly doubled back. “How can John be having a birthday dinner? All his friends hate him.”
Martha Hudson was more astute than John or Sherlock ever acknowledged; she had also reached a point in life where she rarely gave a shit about decorum unless she felt personally compelled, or if there were guests coming. She was unapologetically herself, and to that end, she was often a bit blunt, though she was almost always kind. She cared for her tenants, but after decades of walking on eggshells around her husband, she wouldn’t be discouraged by one moody man, irrespective of the circumstances. She waited to speak until she saw John’s shoulders stoop with regret as his defenses came crumbling down.
John shifted in his chair and broke his reverie, pulling Harry into a tight hug. “Thank you for coming. It’s… really good to see you.”
When the day of the funeral came, John wasn’t ready. He wasn’t sure he ever would be ready. The shock had worn off, besides the annoyingly frequent inability to internalize Sherlock’s death. He still made two cups of tea sometimes. He had mostly stopped choking up every time he thought of his friend. He wasn’t ready to bury him. It seemed so final.
After they finished eating, they continued talking. Mostly about Mary’s past, but John answered a few questions as well. Mary had the sense to give his time with Sherlock a wide berth. He wasn’t excited to talk about himself, and Mary was far more interesting than him. Her mother had been a product of the British occupation in India, her grandfather, a Colonel in the British Army. Her grandmother had taken her mother to Pakistan. Mary had been born there as Mariam. After her mother passed, she had been passed around her family until she ended up with her grandfather, who renamed her Mary Elizabeth. John didn’t have to be a genius to deduce that the Colonel had been a poor guardian. Mary didn’t delve into much detail, but John could empathize with aspects of her unhappy childhood. The drinking, the anger, the hurt, and the resulting estrangement; it was all painfully familiar. After graduating university, beyond eager to escape the confines of England, Mary traveled through several countries working as a nurse. John couldn’t stop the questions bubbling from his lips.
“Mm.” John couldn’t think of a less approving way to reply to that. She knew why he was back. He could see it in her frown, and hear it in the softness of her voice. Perhaps she knew more than she let on.  “You watch telly. You
“Greg Lestrade stopped in. The detective we used to work with,” he explained. “I guess he had some stuff… Um. Thought I might want some of it. So, he dropped it off. And uh, for my birthday last year, he made a video… with Sherlock. This is the unedited version.” He motioned toward the sofa in a silent invitation to sit.
“Is it a bad time?” she asked, tilting her head to the side. Perception flashed sharply in her dark eyes. John knew that look.
“You’re on the late shift Tuesday,” Mary countered. “And I’m off. We could go in the morning? Flowers all year round, there.”
The summer months were filled with picnics in the parks with sweet wine and kisses that slowly, slowly soothed the bitter taste of loss. They trod familiar paths and made them their own. They ate their way through Chinatown, visited the little pizza place in Brixton that served homemade lemonade, stretched out in a field in Morden Hall Park to watch the starry skies on a clear night. John brought Mary to all the tourist traps they had never seen before; they particularly enjoyed the Eye. They revisited the sculpture at Kew Gardens. As soft music played and lights danced around them, John told Mary about Sherlock’s apparent fascination with the bees. Over brunches and quiet post-film cuddles, Mary told John about her struggle to put the past behind her as she tried to build a future. She told him about her ex, and the three of them even went out for drinks. David seemed to understand that he was her friend now, and John could hardly balk at her desire to keep in touch. He would expect the same grace granted toward him, after all. Mary explained that all she wanted was a normal family, unmarred by the pain of her past. The couple built a foundation poured with honesty and tended with care – John might even say love.
“Don’t worry. It’s okay,” John said softly. With a quiet laugh, he added, “Probably won’t even watch it.”
Mary mercifully filled the space between them. “I saw your most recent post, and I wondered if you’d be up for a drink with me? Tonight, or… whenever you’re available.” She took a small bite of her curry but kept her eyes on John.
,” he remembered calling the man a machine, the last words he had thrown in Sherlock’s face, “but let me tell you this: you were the best man, and the most human… human being that I’ve ever known and no one will ever convince me that you told me a lie. So… there.”
“I think John takes home the ‘greatest’ title,” she teased gently with a smirk meant only for him. “But we’re here to talk about Sherlock. So…” When she spoke again, her voice was quiet and raw, a stark contradiction to her brash and unapologetic presence. “I don’t know what he did, or how he did it, but he worked a miracle for my brother. He took a man who… who wasn’t himself, and he made him new. And I saw, and heard,
John wandered about the flat, trying and failing to suppress a slow but steady stream of tears that ran hot down his cheeks. Amidst his grief, he clung to any variation in emotion. He laughed a few times when he unearthed a particularly amusing Post-It, and he wrinkled his nose in guiltless disgust when he found a disgustingly moldy orange with a scrawled note specifically demanding him to leave it alone. How many times had he explained to Sherlock that their kitchen was not a lab, and was, in fact, a place to prepare and consume food? In a way, the irritation was comforting. That was a normal feeling. Normality was so fleeting now. That morning, Mrs. Hudson had brought up two cups of tea, intending to sit down with him. He hadn’t realized the second cup was for her until it was too late. He had taken them both. He automatically assumed it was for Sherlock… and then he remembered. The soft grief in her eyes had hit him harder than a punch to the gut. Every time he forgot that Sherlock was gone, guilt and shame crashed over him as reality hit, leaving only sadness in its wake once the cold shock receded.
“Um. Mmm.” John had prepared some words. He needed preparation, else he might have talked the whole night away. He gathered his thoughts and started off, a bit hesitant at first. “You… you told me once you weren’t a hero. Um… there were times I didn’t even think you were
“Yeah, yeah. Let’s find out.” John offered a small smile and walked away from what might have been with Mary on his arm.
John could understand that. With little family and no firm ties elsewhere, he had gravitated to London after his discharge. It seemed the natural place for someone with nowhere else to go.
A shelf crammed with worldly detritus quivered in John’s vision. He knelt and properly inspected the souvenirs for the first time. They were all pieces of Sherlock’s life before him – a life that he desperately wished to know now. He had been so content with the present that he had never considered delving into Sherlock’s past. Truthfully, he wasn’t sure Sherlock would have told him much even if he had asked. Despite the darkness that had crept in at some point, John knew that Sherlock must have always been extraordinary. He didn’t want to be jealous of the people who had known Sherlock his entire life, but he wished that he could have been there. He craved information, as if that would fill the hole in his heart. At the very least, the depth of his pain might feel more justified. He exhaled slowly and considered the personal effects that surrounded him, the weight of it all threatening to suffocate him. What would Sherlock do? He would take these facts and artifacts and deduce a narrative. He could do that, too. If he couldn’t have Sherlock, he would cobble together a representation based on deductions. It was almost logical. He could mourn Sherlock in his entirety.
John tossed the DVD onto the coffee table and stood up, reaching out to clasp Greg’s arm. “Thanks for, uh, bringing this stuff, yeah.”
John fell asleep with the book in his lap and his reading lamp on. He woke in the early morning with a headache and a sore back, with the sour taste of the night before laying thick on his tongue. He closed the book in his lap and tucked it away, thinking little of it before heading to the kitchen to tend to his hangover.
She put the car in gear and queued up. She reached over to take John’s hand, interlacing their fingers. She was worried about him. He hadn’t slipped quite so far as her into poor coping habits, but he tended to sit with his feelings before deciding to drink them away. It made her nervous in a way she couldn’t admit. If he couldn’t control himself, how could she be certain she could hold onto her sobriety? The new program she had been following helped her immeasurably, targeting feelings she never really identified before. She felt more confident in her recovery, more genuine in her relationships, and less like a chronic failure when she felt the tingling of temptation. She hoped that John would keep in touch. They rode in silence, Harry watching the road and John staring out the window. Harry only released John’s hand when the car ground to a halt.
He had interviewed over a hundred people for the extra room, but none of them suited him. Either they were radicals who opposed him, into strange fantasies he had no desire to be apart of, or detested his personality altogether when he confronted them with their life story. The last thing he wanted to was to rely on his brother to help him with the rent just to live in a decent area of London. Even with the discounted price the land lady had quoted him.
He exhaled heavily and swallowed against a cry welling up. He managed to subdue it to a whimper. Arguments between two stubborn men often meant that securing the last word could drag into a new argument of its own. Now it would be his, forever. He found it wasn’t as satisfying as he thought. He shuffled up to the headstone and brushed his fingers across the cold granite, so much less forgiving than Sherlock’s stoniest expressions. He was a man of flesh and blood, with soft skin and bright eyes, even in his stormy moods.
He walked into the sitting room and groaned at the stacks waiting for him there. As he mentally mapped out the flat, he knew the hardest places would be the sitting room – or the unofficial office space – and Sherlock’s bedroom. He was thoroughly exhausted even though it was only mid-afternoon, creeping into the evening. He plopped down in his chair, staring dolefully at Sherlock’s. The man was an enigma. A prism with infinite facets. And a bloody packrat.
John felt her gaze and exhaled in a huff. His gut instinct was to say no. He didn’t particularly want to go out, and he really didn’t want to go on a date. He wasn’t ready for something new, for someone new. But if he never moved forward, where would that leave him? When he had met Mike in the park, his instinct had told him to go back to his bedsit. Only his leg had kept him from running away. Once Mike had introduced him to Sherlock, he
many people today who must’ve been touched by that… Sherlock magic, or whatever the hell it is. And that’s what we’re here to celebrate. So, thank you for coming. Thank you for your support.” She eyed John carefully, then decided it was nearly time to sit down. “Sherlock, we love you,” she concluded, bustling back to her seat amidst scattered applause from the small group.
“Good Heavens, Donovan, seeing you and Anderson making out is really the last thing I would plan on,” Sherlock shook himself in a blatantly open way to make his point, “and you manage quite well to humiliate yourselves with all that moaning over a dead body. You accuse me of getting off at a crime scene, really?”
Sherlock was completely unfazed because he never listened to popular music. When John asked him about that he stated that popular came from the Latin word “populus” which not only meant “folk” but also meant lower folk such as in “riffraff” which made the whole music genre abhorrent to him.
Sherlock was delighted when John proposed that idea although he tried to side-track him. The Master Deducer shammed to only grudgingly comply and claimed it would be substantial to ensure the suitability of the costumes in a “real-life environment” before he eagerly went with it.
John was a caring person by nature, no surprise given his intention to become a doctor. John loved to take care of people and although he might just have punched the git last night, Sherlock also had wormed himself into John´s heart, carving out a large space there to nest in with astonishing easiness.
The sight was close to causing John a heart attack due to shock. To be fair, Sherlock had been actually suffering of shock symptoms himself because he had been expecting to feel a blade slicing his guts and bleeding out. Leaving John behind.
Good God! Jesus Motherfucking Christ! Holy Shit! The Yarders were instantaneously envious. Doctor Ex-Soldier John Sodding-Holmes´ Boyfriend Watson was… ripped!
. Meanwhile everyone had been informed about the pole dance performance and most of the staff had been getting more and more excited in anticipation of cashing in the lost bet. A lot of them hoped that the Consulting Detective would utterly humiliate himself and that they would be able to mock him relentlessly and retaliate him for his general obnoxiousness and vitriolic tongue.
“I think I´m falling for you,” John mumbled through the sound of running water, pressing a soft kiss against Sherlock´s neck.
Sherlock also knew that his personality severely lacked any lovable traits. It was always much easier to let his acerbic tongue have its way and his vitriolic mind eviscerate the people around him. He was well aware he had a beautiful and hellishly attractive body and used his gorgeous looks to draw in his future sex partners. Then he´d more often than not goaded them into fucking him hard as retaliation for acting like the mouthy punk he was.
The pirouette ended in an insanely arched back when John caught Sherlock like he weighed nothing at all and dipped his partner deeply, firmly held in golden tanned strong arms.
“So, the little ho has slept with you only an hour after shagging me and now he´s still here because you want him to?”
Sherlock discarded the thought. He felt really comfy now. Heavy somehow, too. His mind was reacting sluggishly and he recognized the upcoming need to get a fix. A slight itch started to enfold under his skin. Were the cocaine bugs already beginning to crawl and swarm around? A bit not good, that. Also, something tickled against his naked chest.
Shaking himself and disgusted about his own weakness, Sherlock stripped quickly and stepped under the lukewarm spray. He shivered and waited for the water to turn hot, to reach a temperature able to melt away all his tainted skin and cleanse the shrunken soul he called his own.
John wore… not much actually. A very scanty and very golden loincloth was wrapped around his more private parts. The flowing fabric shimmered in the light. Matching glitter had been applied onto his chest and shoulders, the whole body beautifully tanned and emphasizing his finely chiselled muscles. A divine six-pack adorned his abdomen, he sported lovely bi- and triceps and his abs were bulging.
“Me too. Ergo, no need to be ashamed. Just let go and enjoy the game.” Switching back into his role, Sherlock exclaimed shocked “Doctor, the tip of my cock is getting more swollen still. Where would I find release?”
After they had dried, John had pressed Sherlock to change into clean clothes of his.  Sherlock would actually have put on again his cum stained jeans and the sweaty tee and had not batted an eye at John´s horrified expression. It took some verbal sparring to coerce Sherlock into accepting a plain white tee accompanied with one of John´s grey work-out sweatpants.
Sherlock hopped down the stairs to the ground floor, bare footed and shirtless, his mind still lingering on the adorable face John had made when he flaunted his arse and entered the kitchen. A large table was positioned in the middle, surrounded by six chairs, all in a different type and colour. Two of the walls were occupied by cupboards and electrical appliances and the third sported a curtained window.
He swallowed hard and licked over his plush lips in return, searching for something to feel like, something to taste like John but found nothing. Because John´s lips were on his pierced nipple again, biting the aroused and sensitive skin once more.
Sherlock gestured John to come closer and the golden angel walked around his Barbarella and let his hands reverently caress the lean body. Sherlock leant into the touch before he playfully pushed John away with the tip of his high-heeled foot. John gracefully rolled backwards only to jump forward and grab the offending leg. He pressed several kisses along the shin, making Sherlock grin lecherously, before he flexed the leg into a full front split.
The 221b couple kept pole dancing on a regular basis, greatly enjoying the work out. They often had racy sex afterwards.
The audience collectively let out an awed exhale before a thunderous cheer arose and frantic clapping made everybody´s eardrums ring.
The autoerotic movements obviously seemed to turn on Sherlock pretty much as well. That had to be prohibited. “So responsive. But if you come before I put myself up your ass there´ll be no dick for you at all.” That caused a miserable whine.
Sherlock found out that he really liked wearing a bodice and panties. He told John about that, blushing severely. John found it adorable and confessed he was fucking turned on by seeing Sherlock in these. Over the course of time Sherlock would amass several dozen sets. John would always choose the one his partner should wear.
Semen erupted in abundance, held back by the condom but still searing hot inside Sherlock, seemingly burning him to cinders. His own excretions spilled over and formed an equally hot puddle against his belly.
Strangely, John had been angry when Sherlock confessed the unusualness of him staying over at the hook-up´s place afterwards because they simply were interested in using his body. And that Sherlock was okay with it and not expecting anything different.
Sherlock spun around and faced a disgruntled looking Christopher. The chemistry student was bleary-eyed and obviously hungover. Chris scratched a hand through his messy hair and yawned so widely that Sherlock thought he could see right down to the tonsils.
Holy Hell! Holy all Dante´s Nine combined and some more hells on top! How could he wear this and, in a lack of a better word, lacking a whole lexicon of words, look simply
Yet, he only felt bad for a moment because he somehow knew as well that Sherlock really wanted this relationship with John to work out. Really wanted John. This should be worth something, shouldn´t it? Sherlock would make an effort, too.
“Always so considerate,” Sherlock quipped, “but I will, I promise,” he added in earnest and smiled fondly at John who was really someone special. So good to Sherlock. John really
John gasped, momentarily surprised but adjusting quickly, he followed the playful course Sherlock had laid out. “What ails you today, patient of mine?”
More fragments of last night came back. Sex with Chris had been rather disappointing. It had been over quickly and consisted of uninspired pounding into Sherlock´s hole. Chris had simply shoved his dick into Sherlock and had worked himself into a sloppy orgasm while grunting non-verbally. Sherlock nearly had missed to get off himself and so therefore had been deeply unsatisfied. A wasted night, rather.
? John the medical student, coming home tired after a shift in hospital and finding his bed, his decent and clean bed, being occupied with Sherlock who was neither clean and had never been decent in the first place. Moreover, who had also just been buggered by John´s flatmate an hour ago and clearly showed the remnants thereof.
“Answer me!” John slapped Sherlock´s arse with his flat hand. The rivulets of water were pushed aside upon the impact of wet skin on skin and the sounds made and the tingling sensation left went straight into Sherlock´s brain stem, letting his heart rate peak with a thumping spike.
His hands were shoved away and the grip around his throat vanished “You´re not allowed to come yet.” Sherlock´s vision cleared with oxygen returning. The beginning orgasm was pushed back, too. “John!” He whined. “How could you know…”
The unexpected vulnerability Sherlock had shown had surprised John much more than he had realised at first. The obnoxious cocksure and plainly maddening punk who had commandeered his bed and actually coerced him into having sex had stared utterly dumbfounded at John when he had been begged to stay the night. This uncomprehending look on the beautiful face concerning John´s wish of “waking up together” had stirred something deep inside John´s soul.
“God no! Did you hear him talk? He´s a good fuck but a true arse. Nothing more.” Chris exclaimed, ignoring Sherlock as well.
Sherlock´s breath hitched with every tantalizing touch of that hellish mouth, these devilish teeth and that demonic tongue. He panted and blood streamed into his head letting his cheeks blush a vivid red colour. A needy whine could be heard and Sherlock realized it had been his own. John. John had made him do that.
They had considered telling Greg about them but the man was such a terrible gossip. Lestrade also was so keen on winning the pool on the ongoing bet the Yarders had. As if the most observant man in Great Britain (that would be Sherlock Holmes, of course) would not have realized that the staff of the homicide division had been wracking their brains over some of the most burning questions of all time (as far as they seemed to think even vital ones). Not that there was a lot of brain which could get wracked in the first place. Well.
The disdainful comment stung more than Sherlock would have believed to be possible. His insecurity peaked once more and the rising anxiety told him to just leave the kitchen and walk out as long as he was able to remember John´s kind expression while looking onto him this morning in bed. Fearing that John´s gaze would turn into the contempt Sherlock actually deserved. Before Chris´ half-assed comments would open John´s eyes concerning the vile person Sherlock really was.
John softly punched Sherlock´s shoulder. “Not going to happen. I´m keeping you. You´re quickly becoming my favourite jumper.”
Just like this they fell asleep once again, waking up about fifteen minutes later, feeling refreshed and invigorated by the short nap.
Secretly, a lot of the women but also an astonishingly high amount of men also looked forward to see Sherlock or John (or both) partially naked. Hopefully so because both men were really good-looking on the outside. One could only guess what kind of body that Belstaff or these cringy jumpers hid beneath.
Without further ado, Sherlock stepped towards John and took off his partner´s golden cloak. “Here is my angel”, he said.
Eyes switched to Sherlock now who raised his bottom high and arched his back so far that his curls made contact with the ground. Then he let his whole body spring forward in a powerfully executed movement that made him stop in a kneeling position in front of John, stretching his arms wide to the side, making him resemble the letter “T”.
Sherlock had thrown himself over the man´s midsection to pin him onto the ground and John was in the act of aiming his gun to keep the killer from writhing. The murderer caught both of them by surprise when he suddenly had a penknife in his hand. There was no hesitation in his eyes when he stabbed Sherlock directly into the abdomen.
The Yarders saw the picture lighting up at the screen behind the stage and a disbelieving murmur emerged which quickly evolved into whispered gasps of stunned surprise… had they really dared to dress like that?
Sherlock let his upper foot be set on the pole by John and bent his torso far to the front until he could grab the metal with both hands besides his foot. That way, he formed a V-shaped gap but still maintained the front split.
“Because I want you to,” Sherlock quipped cheekily. His cock was getting cold bereft of John´s body heat. Still, it spasmed when John called Sherlock “horny ho”. So inventive with the name-calling again!
“These are John´s.” Sherlock added proudly and only then he realized that he probably should not have said that out loud. Maybe it was safer to get some piece of furniture between himself and Chris now. What if Chris turned violent and lunged at Sherlock, feeling angry and trying to punch him? It would not be the first time Sherlock had gotten hit because of his loose mouth and acerbic tongue. He retreated behind the kitchen table.
, a fellow chemistry student. They had danced in the “Tech Noir” and Sherlock had pounced on Chris like the always hungry sexual predator he was. Chris had been handsome and drunk and more than willing to let Sherlock be bottom in his bed.
Watch at least this one: Ashley Fox 2018 US National Pole Champion, she performs all the moves I discribed above and much more. Absolutely stunning! https://
“No, you git! Me falling for the age-old trope of “the soap fell down”. I can´t believe you did something as corny as that.”
John must be a mind-reading psychic. “Same here.” Sherlock sighed. Looking at John he saw a grin forming and the corners of his mouth beginning to twitch. “What?”
Until the day when Sherlock forgot his mobile on a crime scene after leaving the hallway where the body lay in a huff because Anderson had been his usual stupid self and Donovan her usual rude “freak-calling” self. When Sherlock returned to fetch his phone he saw them both in a tight embrace. Anderson was groping Donovan´s behind having shoved his hand deep down into her jeans while she had shoved her tongue deep down into his throat in what definitely was an attempt to lick at his tonsils. They emitted sounds of lust, moaning and grunting loudly.
Philip gnashed his teeth so hard that he could feel a tiny particle breaking off. He chewed shortly on it before swallowing it down and felt utterly wrecked. Holmes´ legs actually turned him on. Well, shit! He´d have to convince Sally to work out and get thighs like these, too.
John walked leisurely towards the pole, grabbed it double-handed at shoulder height and pulled himself off the ground, his body perfectly linear and in a 30° angle off the pole. He subtly rebounded and used the energy to let his body make two full spins. The movement was fluent, effortless and looked so easy but the strain in John´s muscles made the high amount of necessary body tension clear. After seemingly gliding through air John´s feet touched the stage again, facing Sherlock and leaning his back against the pole.
The all-consuming fire of their mutual arousal had been burning hot with incandescent flames. Fuelled by the drugs, Sherlock´s shameless slutty demeanour and John´s pent-up sexual tension.  Devouring them both.
As always, Sherlock covered up his insecurity with an air of obnoxiousness and, becoming quite catty, he snapped, “I´ve been too tired to go home last night. So, I´ve found myself another bed to sleep in when you kicked me out of yours.” He added a haughty sniff just to spite Chris. Leaving “and another man to sleep with, too” unsaid.
Lost in thought, Sherlock hovered a bit, looking out of the window onto to the street in front of the house. He felt elated and the yearning for a next dose of cocaine had been thoroughly pushed into the background of his mind. John seemed to be the cure for his constant itch to be distracted.
John rolled off of Sherlock´s back and ogled at the stained sheets with dismay. “Look at the mess you made.” He tried for a stern look but instead broke into a wide grin like that cat that just caught the mouse.
John shifted his body to lie flush on top of Sherlock, pressing him down into the sheets, sliding one strong firm thigh between Sherlock´s lean ones and rubbing sweetly against his cock. It jumped and began to fill with blood, making contact with a similar hardness in John´s pants. The soft throbbing got Sherlock to moan again and turned him into a boneless bag of flesh. John made a fist in Sherlock´s curls and pulled his head firmly but without force backwards into an arch, exposing the length of pale throat for a licking exploration with his warm and undulating tongue.
The freeze frame picture of both men perched inverted on the pole, upholding an athletically insanely taxing position was too much for the audience. Wild clapping washed like a tidal wave through the mass of rapt watchers. Catcalls and whooping sounds visually pierced the atmosphere like sharp knives ready to draw blood.
“Oh, thank you!,” Her face lit up at the mentioning of her cooking. “But just this once. I’m not your housekeeper.”
On the soaked page was a solitary note. A date which brought him to a time of more simplicity and once joy. But this is where it all began. The beginning of the end.
The landlady made her presence known, almost in a mother hen type way as she picked up varies items around the room, her herself trying to clean as well.
Sherlock handed John the mug and sat in his own grey chair. He had hoped that this subject would never come up. That John would continue on to believe that he had simply snatched him up, blacked out, whatever story he had told himself. John was smarter than that though. Smarter than he gave him credit for. He saw it in his eyes that night when he had brought him home. All the gears turning and falling into place as he tried to take his pulse. The way he looked at his watch and his brows creased together in confusion, not from the lack of Sherlock’s physical norms, but from realizing what time it was. John’s eyes had ever so slightly looked away as he thought about it, ignoring the task at hand. Sherlock had thought he had derailed John’s way of thinking then. Obviously not.
“I will admit I don’t know a whole lot, but that does not mean I am not willing to learn. I haven’t had much encounters with Felisian’s. I have nothing against your kind though. Look what I’m trying to say is that's its fine. Its all fine.”
“And John, no. They don’t know. Except for Lestrade. And I would like to keep it that way if you don’t mind. I’ve been keeping this secret from them the past couple of years.”
But for once John was going to have to outsmart him. This time would be just a trial run. For emergency means he reasoned with himself. He wasn’t going to sit through another evening in the flat while the vampire looked at him like he was starting to become a menu option. No need of risking anyone possibly getting killed simply because Sherlock was hungry. It was a win win situation if you looked at it right. Sherlock got fed, he didn’t have to kill. John brought home blood, he didn’t get bit. Simple as pie.
The sitting room had a wave of renewed life within it now. Darkness no longer bathed in every corner and crevice. Strange commodities of dead things framed behind glass would’ve gave the cold chill of dread to any if it were still night. However, in the lit room they no longer held such power. Now they were scientific fascinations decorating the mantle of the fireplace and shelves for all to see. Beetles, bats, botany of mushrooms and other fauna. They were life and death together in harmony. Glass jars and chemistry materials lined shelves in a display cabinet along with other knickknacks that even piqued John’s interest as he looked at them all. This no longer felt like the den of a vampire, but a flat of a detective who had an interest in the mechanics of life and science. He was about to go into the kitchen when he heard the shuffle of feet and turned to meet the figure of his new flatmate.
As the boat sailed further and further the fog was becoming denser. These memories had become misguided, corrupt, buried at sea. Jagged rocks littered the shores of an island that threatened to steer the boat to certain doom. Monsters lurked in the darkened waters of the waves. As much as he longed not to visit here he knew he must. No matter how much it disturbed his mind. From the island, papers drifted away from it, carried by the tide. He reached down into the water and retrieved one hoping it may give some sort of relief to his curiosity.
He wasn’t taking any chances tonight. If this was to be his room then he damn well wanted the necessary protection. He couldn’t help but curse himself mentally for not taking more interest in religion. He owned no Bible or cross for that matter. He highly doubted a vampire was stocked up on garlic of any kind. No point of going back downstairs to the kitchen and snooping. Sitting on his bed he felt a lump rise in his throat and forced it back down. Never had he felt so defenseless, helpless, clueless even. At least not since Afghanistan. All he had to go on to ensure he slept peacefully was the vampire’s word and he wasn’t sure how much weight his words actually held. So far he hadn’t lied to him, he had been up front and honest, but he had also kept his own secrets from John.
John set his cup down in his saucer with a hard clink. In all the scenarios he could've come back home to it had to be this one. He admitted he thought his life was going to be slow and mundane once out of the army. A quiet little flat, boring job, and do...what exactly? Take up fishing? Stamp collecting? The mere thought made him want keel over. He would die of boredom. Now here he was a crippled doctor taking a flat with a oversized cat detective and a demented landlady who was high. He had always thought about writing. And even his therapist had told him to get a hobby. Write about everything that happened to him. It would help she said. What better way than this?
John wasn’t exactly sure what the vampire meant by fun, but the harsh light of the computer screen was starting to take a toll on his retina’s. He made his way to the kitchen and dug the curry out of the fridge, throwing it in the microwave to cook.
John’s thoughts screeched to a blinding halt and pupils widened a fraction. An exchange? Of what? In any other normal circumstance the exchange for rent would be money. But this wasn’t any normal situation. He was dealing with a man, a very dead man. A dead man that was a vampire. Of course how stupid could he be!
The subtle clack of heels came from the stairs and soon a elderly woman entered the kitchen. She was dressed in a floral blouse and skirt and tucked in her hand was a newspaper.
“I never understand when you speak French, but that’s usually normal and I ignore it.” John grabbed his tea and began to drink it.
"I know John, but just give this a try. Its the Obiliviator's Headquarters. They investigate muggles who may or may not be getting to close to the magical world when they shouldn't be there. Some field agents can spend years in one area. Observing, reporting, all the while correcting the error the Ministry sees as a potential breach. Obliviate and move on to the next case."
John had already tuned her out as picture in the paper caught his eye. The front page story was oddly enough about the suicides Sherlock and the Inspector were just discussing. A brief scan of the article suggested all the suicides were concurrent with one another given the fact the victims had all taken the same poison. Glancing down near the bottom of the page there in the corner was a photo of the same man that had visited them moments before: Greg Lestrade, D.I.
“It’s alright. I still have a little left to tide me over. You can try again tomorrow.” He said with the wave of his hand, dismissing the whole crisis.
“No, Watson.” Holmes straightened himself up. “One place is strictly the limit for the recently deceased.”
“Something about a terrorist attack on the tube. The paramedic on the line said it was bad. Really bad. All the hospitals in the surrounding area are on stand by.”
“How? How the hell did you know that? I have never talked to my therapist not once about the war let alone…this.” He gestured to his hand.
"No," John answered. "I switch departments for a change. I'm with the Obiliviator Headquarters just temporarily, giving it a try. I'm being assigned to watch someone. Some bloke using a laboratory at hospital. They think he's up to trouble." John stopped, taking a sip of his coffee. Mike awkwardly looked away and drank his coffee.
Perhaps that is why it took Sherlock by surprise when he sensed none on the man he had just swept off the street. He had been stalking him silently since the first day he had laid eyes upon the unsuspecting doctor just two weeks prior. Little did Sherlock know that fateful night would change his life forever. When he first caught eye of the doctor Sherlock had been leaving the morgue late one bitter frigid May night. At first the man looked like any other doctor leaving St. Bart’s Hospital. The doctor’s face was sullen and marked evidence of a long and weary shift. He was young, no more than mid-thirties and looked as if he carried the weight of the world upon his shoulders.  His hair shown in a bright golden hue under the street lights that revealed secrets of silver hiding underneath. He tugged his coat tighter around him as the brisk wind of the unusual cold spring plowed through the city. It was enough to show the hidden tan line that was beginning to fade that went no higher than his wrist.
“Right. Um, thanks.” He gave a quick smile and looked away out the widow, unable to look the detective in the face without feeling slightly embarrassed about his reaction. Though that didn’t matter. In the reflection of the glass he caught sight of Sherlock’s face looking thoroughly smug and even pleased.
“For heaven’s sake John its not like asking your neighbor to lend a cup of sugar. My identity is a heavily guarded secret. Not even his own secretary knows what I am.”
"Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night ..." Sherlock's attention was still to his phone before his face lit up "... before returning home to Cardiff." He shoved his phone in his pocket and returned his attention back to the Inspector.
you've got a therapist. Then there's your brother." Sherlock held out his hand beckoning for his phone and John gave it to him without a second thought as if he was under his spell. "Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you're looking for a flat share. You wouldn't waste money on this. It's a gift, then. There's scratches. Not one, many over time. It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. Next bit's easy. You know it already."
Him? Concerned about his health? The thought of a vampire concerned about his health made him somewhat perturbed. John had figured the only reason Sherlock would only care about his well being was that he essentially was playing the part as his blood mule.
“Good it’s…wait.” John hurriedly followed suit and hung his jacket as well and went after him. “You didn’t need my help you were being a prat! You got me out to fix my shoulder!”
"Figure out I was a wizard and not a solider or a doctor for that matter? For a while. Took him about two years. He still wonders how the tea makes itself every morning." He scoffed.
Now this answer seemed vague. Did he mean his life or the life of another? If his death was truly as traumatizing as John was led to believe he would have to say it was the detective’s. After all how would one feel if they were suddenly murdered only to be brought back to life and realize they would never die. Continue living while the ones you loved passed on. It had to be a hell within itself.
There was no force or beckoning call to pull John back into the flat. Sherlock had left it up to him to choose to come back in. Neither had he physically manipulated him. He was giving him an ultimatum. Either John could come in and take advantage of his now new room or he could freely make a run for it even if he had nowhere to go. With a sigh, John chose the latter of the two options and went back in.
All the man could do was look closely at him, scrutinizing, almost as if he was reading him for a moment before he began his speech.
The air shifted in the room and became heavier and a sudden feeling that he was not alone came like a tickle to the back of his mind. Black dress shoes caught his attention. Following the blood soaked trails upon trousers and dress shirt, John was met with the presence of Sherlock. He hadn’t heard him come in at all. His face no longer held any ill intent as it did before, but a more of a somber expression. At least he looked more aware and in control.
