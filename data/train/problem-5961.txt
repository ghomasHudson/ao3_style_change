“You’re good with her,” Steve tells Tony, not for the first time.
There, in his palm, was a small white petal.
“Fine,” Tony replies, not caring if his reply sounds a little short. “I’ll keep looking.”
“Of course,” Bucky said matter-of-factly. “Had to throw some balls at some cans to prove our love, it’s a time-honored tradition.”
Steve squeezes his eyes shut and hangs his head, suddenly overwhelmed by all the people he’s lost, some more than once.
“Peter’s in there?” Steve asked, heart in his throat. At Ned’s frantic nod, Steve swallowed, looked at the building, then back to Ned. “Any idea where he’d be? Which floor? Front, back, side?”
Steve needs to talk to Tony.
“He should’ve at least apologized!” Steve fumed, glaring in the direction the man had gone.
Tony studied him for a moment. “Then dinner?” he asked hopefully.
And now Tony’s the one looking at
A week later, there were mysterious power fluctuations in the Raft.  Doors locked and unlocked in inexplicable ways that trapped security guards, and the cameras, even those attached to backup generators, had all footage erased.  Exactly one prisoner escaped.
“For... the way things went at the airport in Germany. I shouldn’t have--”
“Titanic.” That admission has him sending an apologetic look at Natasha. “Goddammit, Stark, would you stop?”
“I hit it!” Tony shouted in victory.
“Well, first, maybe don’t capsize us?” Bucky suggested dryly. He didn’t look particularly perturbed by the possibility, though, looking as relaxed as he had the entire afternoon. Of course, his bucket was full of fish, while Steve’s still sat empty, so Bucky’s relaxation seemed a lot more productive than his own. “Finally snagged one, huh?”
“Yep, that stride you have when you know what you’re after and will maim or murder anyone who gets in your way--you know, either in battle, or when you know there’s only one cupcake left in the kitchen. I knew it was you out here when I heard that glorious murder strut.”
That startled a laugh out of the dragon. Despite the slightly worrying puff of smoke that accompanied it, the laugh was a pleasant, melodious sound. “You think I can’t protect myself?”
--words of love still echoed in Tony’s ears.
After that, several times a night, he would wake up with a start, half asleep and panicking that Tony’s arc reactor had gone out, that his heart had stopped. He would remember in time to stop himself from jostling Tony awake, but instead would carefully reach out to feel his lover’s wrist, his neck, or his chest--to feel the steady beat of Tony’s heart that meant he really was alive and well.
Tony grins.
“I know...” He does. He’s worn slings before, but he doesn’t know why this time it’s so irritating. Maybe because the other times he was in enough pain everywhere it was easy to remember why he was wearing it, and this time it’s just a shoulder injury that only hurts if he moves it wrong, so the straps are more distracting than the pain. “I just don’t like feeling held back, for such a minor injury.”
“It was a gift, didn’t want you missing out on that quality team bonding experience!” Clint replied gleefully.
“I asked if you still... fancied me.”
The chair.
He was shocked to hear a familiar voice: “But
“Only if they catch me,” Tony retorted with a grin. “So is that a Yes to the date, or what?”
“Be my guest.”
Tony wrinkles his brow in confusion. “Who?”
“Absolutely,” Tony answers, “Tomorrow. Right now, I want to show you just how much I enjoyed the show...”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky had laughed in their faces when Hydra tried to use his old trigger words on him. Thanks to Shuri and Tony, that programming was gone.
tried?”
“Come on, Papa! Uncle Clint and Aunt Tasha are already outside, an’ Daddy an’ me have our coats an’ hats an’ everything, an’ you don’t even have your
For a moment, he’s determined to take the only way out he knows.
“Umm...” There’s something charmingly familiar in Morgan’s ‘caught’ face.
“I think we’re all okay, though,” Steve answered Tony’s question, his voice a little strangled as he apparently tried not to gag.
The corner of Tony’s mouth twists up in an sympathetic grimace. “I don’t want to lose you, either.”
Tony blinked, sitting up and looking around. “Oh.” He looked back at Steve, eyes a little more clear. “You’re not
Accelerated healing has limits, and Bucky has trauma.
He looked at the door.
Tony snorts, and the next ten minutes are spent coming up with more and more ridiculous lies.
Steve loved working the overnight shift at the coffee shop. For the most part, it was quiet, and he could sketch when he wasn't helping the infrequent customers, cleaning counters, or mopping the floor. Sure, sometimes drunk college students came in after the bars closed, but if they got rowdy Steve’s disapproving lecture usually calmed them down, and if that didn’t work, he had the necessary stature to restrain or remove the more physical offenders. But that wasn’t the norm, and most of the late night customers sat quietly while working or studying.
“You’ll stay?” Bucky hates how meekly his voice comes out, because maybe he’s still a little afraid of the dentist and the tools they’ll use even if
There’s a sudden silence in the quinjet. In the cockpit, the quiet mutters between Clint and Natasha have stopped. Steve feels the gazes of Bruce and Thor on him, but only sees Tony’s expression of wide-mouthed shock.
Tony tensed as two muscular older kids took positions on either side of him, one grabbing his lunch bag from the table in front of him before he could see what Jarvis had packed him. The other slapped a heavy hand on his shoulder, holding him firmly on the uncomfortable cafeteria bench.
them, it was over their heads!” Tony protests.
It could’ve been a figment of his imagination, but he immediately closes the faceplate and has the heads up display zoom in.
Tony’s eyes, focused on the ceiling again, crinkle in confusion. “What do you mean?”
Steve grins wryly and shakes his head. “I could do my lines, but it won’t be as impressive without the backup dancers.”
“Steve,” Tony begins.
Tony stared through the reinforced bars that may or may not be strong enough to hold the being that sat inside.
believes to be the truth, but then he realizes he’s not sure if he believes it or not. It’s confusing, and prevents him from responding at all.
he wanted to say, but the look on her face told him he’d better just sit.
“Yep.” Bucky still didn’t move.
Tony takes in the view, face going slack in surprise. Then, as Steve had hoped, he laughs.
Clint frowns. “We live here, too, and he’s never said we can’t have pets.” He cradles both creatures in his arms, and the two curl up together.
Tony snorted, then regretted it as more of the disgusting smell flooded his nostrils. He grimaced, then glared at his teammate. Then he smiled, taking a few slow steps forward. “You know what? You’re right. Thank you for including me in this team bonding experience. Let me repay you with a nice...” He lunged forward, Clint realizing the danger only in the last second. “Hug!”
Tony’s pleased smile makes him want... It’s the wrong time, with the battle still raging around them. He gets up, pulls Tony up, and they go back to fighting robots.
When he pulled away, Tony’s eyes met his for a moment, then glanced to Steve, and some of his normal cockiness seemed to come back (not that shy Tony wasn’t adorable). “Now don’t be jealous, you can have some, too...” He tilted his cheek toward Steve.
“Something’s not right. Wipe him again and start over.”
Tony looks at the Captain America storelska, then back at the one Steve’s holding. Steve puts it back in the cage, and it immediately goes to snuggle with its buddy again.
Then he looked almost fearful for a moment before approaching, something odd in his swimming technique, though Steve had trouble identifying what that was.
So instead of leaning forward, he stays where he is on the floor, but Bucky’s right arm--god, his other sleeve had been empty, had Bucky lost his left arm?--slowly reaches up and brushes Steve’s cheek. “Steve,” he says again, with a bit more certainty, but still looking a little lost.
“Okay...” Bucky said, looking around to see if there was a litter box anywhere nearby. The animal probably shouldn’t be left alone in the workshop regardless. There were dangerous... “That armor doesn’t have repulsors or anything, does it?” he asked warily.
Eventually the determined look slid away into resignation, and R’klin nodded, sitting back down.  He slumped into his position of misery from before Tony came in.  “I understand.”
Steve’s smile softens at that as he sets her on her feet. “Yes, you are. And that’s a lovely dress you have there.” It’s a bright green and printed with little colorful test tubes and other science images, because of course Tony’s going to raise himself a genius.
“Legend says your favorite food is apple pie.” (“False.”)
“The doll appears to be close to immobilized, though the webbing on the lower left arm may give way if not reinforced. Additionally, it appears Spider-Man’s supply of web fluid may be--”
Tony takes another step, and stares at the dune ahead of him.
The door opened, and Tony stepped inside.
Tony shrugs. “Can you blame me for being prepared? I could call the suit from anywhere, but the lecture I’d get from Ms. Potts about the holes in the walls just didn’t seem worth it.”
Tony’s smile turns real. “Yeah, exactly. We’re still friends, and I have no doubt Pep’ll still be an amazing mother. We did consider staying together at least a few more years for Morgan, but...”
a barista, you are the only barista in the world who makes the perfect coffee. Though...” He winced. “I prefer taking it internally...” He flexed his hand and Steve belatedly realized his hot coffee had spilled on his arm and side.
He hears Bucky snort, which doesn’t really surprise him (even though this is all Bucky’s fault, the jerk), but he has to admit he’s offended when he hears his soulmate laugh. Steve frowns and opens his eyes.
,” Steve said quickly.
Tony glanced at his shoulders to see a ragged brown coat draped over them. He stood and turned, shocked to see a short, skinny blond man pulling his arms back and rubbing his hands together to warm them up. The man himself had no protection from the elements other than a worn button-down shirt and khakis with holes at the knees.
“That’s fair. Same rules for us,” Natasha says, Clint and Bruce and Tony agree, and the game begins.
Tony sighed. “I knew that was a mistake the second I said it...”
Tony had considered going to church, confessing his sins before the duel. He rarely attended, but this was the kind of situation where even the least devout would hedge their bets for the hereafter.
“Analysis complete.” A list of chemicals displayed in the HUD as JARVIS summarized, “No hazards to humans beyond olfactory discomfort and potential mild itching, and no matches to known allergens among Avengers.”

Steve found himself reluctant to part with the oddly emotive artificial fish, but it seemed to be straining toward the swimmer, as though it recognized its owner. “Did you make this?” Steve asked as he slowly lowered it into the man’s waiting hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
Right there on the doorstep, as that single blue eye watched in confusion, Tony unhooked his belt, unzipped his fly, and then pulled the edge of his jeans down just enough to reveal the pink flower on his hip. The shape that had now been visible for a record forty-three days.
Tony turns away, and Steve’s heart plummets. “Yeah, well, legend says I’ll never be good enough for Captain America, so that doesn’t matter, does it?”
She gets in his way at the last second when he’s about to pull the trigger.
He placidly accepts the mouth guard from the technician, and braces for the pain of the wipe.
“Hello?” he shouted into the large space.
“You’re ridiculous, doll,” Bucky said. “But--I am going to murder anyone who tries to take you again. Let’s get you out of here, okay?”
“It’s real, Steve. It’s rare, but there have been plenty of documented cases. Growths in the lungs that lead to expulsion of flower petals, almost always linked to unrequited love. Thirty percent survival rate.”
Then the former Winter Soldier threw a mocking salute at the glaring woman as they lifted off and flew toward home.
“Barnes,” Tony greets him, and James realizes Maria’s reaction distracted him from the door being held open, Tony gesturing for him to come in.
Bucky shook his head. “Doll, please, let me do it instead.”
“Thank you,” he said, finally. “But at least give me an address or a contact number so I can return it to you later?”
It’s been one week since Tony’s old ship, the
“Hey,” Tony says, grabbing for Steve’s hand again, even though they’ve never held hands before today. Steve squeezes back gratefully. “I’m here. I’m okay.” No longer flippant, his eyes are serious as they gaze into Steve’s. “I’m sorry I scared you.”
He doesn’t tell her that a weapon can’t feel regret.
All that time getting rid of the triggers, and they were just going to reprogram him again. Use him against innocent people, his friends,
Tony’s eyes were huge. “If that’s actually on the table? Yes. I didn’t think you’d... but, yes.”
Several different emotions flitted across Bucky’s face, ending with a glare. “I don’t need a pity hire.”
As Tony started to dry off both the coffee and the moisture from the wet floor, Steve started the coffee machine again. “I’ll get you a replacement coffee and danish, on me.” The first danish was, sadly, sitting in a puddle near the spilt coffee cup.
Steve found himself obeying almost by rote, eventually making it to the room with the couch. Tony had apparently made it there and given Bucky the same commands, as the soldier was currently sitting up and removing his boots. Tony was at the fireplace, giving a joyous “Aha!” as the flame started to take hold, then disappearing from the room.
“Because you put yourself in danger!” Tony shouted, then took a deep breath and continued more calmly, “I’ve seen your 4F forms. I know how lucky you were to make it to adulthood, and every damn day I’m grateful you survived long enough to get the serum, to be here with me now. And then you chose to risk dying of fucking rheumatic fever. So yes, I was angry--still am, honestly--but I’ll do what I can to make sure you don’t die--of disease or in battle--and in the meantime, I will continue to kiss you and hold you and make love with you because I fucking love you, Steve Rogers, not the serum.” Tony’s face had been serious, but now quirked up in a half-smile. “Despite what I may have said the day we met, you’ve always been special. What came out of a bottle just made you less breakable. So... try not to break on me, here?”
The “Haha, gotcha!” that followed might have been more convincing if Peter hadn’t first looked surprised and alarmed at the ball still in his hand after the halted throw. Then he moved the ball from his right hand to his left, wincing slightly as though the movement hurt.
He shakes his head. But after a moment, he asks, “What’s your name?”
Tony didn’t really care about the order of things, but if Bucky did, “We c’n do that. Date’s good.”
Steve is a barista, and Tony takes a spill.
“Wait, no, you can’t just--” she began.
Bucky is whooping and cheering through the whole ride. Steve has to admit, the rush of wind is an exhilarating feeling, almost as thrilling as skydiving.
“Take your time,” a smooth voice replied.
“According to Pepper...”
Steve isn’t sure why Tony invited him out to the cabin where he lives with his wife and daughter. He’s been there a few times over the years, but usually for a social evening with the team, not just him.
The world is spinning, and he barely manages to climb out of his seat.
He reluctantly lets go as Tony pulls back and moves to help the man slumped on the bench remove his own helmet.
Tony had to admit to himself, even though he knew his boyfriend wouldn’t lie to him, he’d had trouble believing that Bucky was actually a real-life, actual werewolf...
“Okay. Gonna throw up,” Tony added as his stomach suddenly clenched.
hurt?” Tony asks.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief as they left, grateful not only that the bullies were leaving him alone, but that he wouldn’t have to watch two other kids get beat into the ground for trying to help him.
The dragon looked rather annoyed. “Not another one. Can’t I have a break for even two days?” came a tired masculine voice, not as loud or deep as Steve had expected, almost human-sounding. The dragon stared down at Steve. “I suppose not. You’re here to try to slay me, too, aren’t you?”
“Yeah, me too, sweetheart,” Steve replies. “See you in a minute.”
“I’m not scared of--” Bucky bites his lip, trying to dispel the image in his head.
Here, both Steve and Tony turned to give their son a disapproving look, but Peter just shrugged, gesturing at the animals on the table as if to say “What else could I do?”
“Yeah,” Bucky agrees, “If you’d rather we sleep in your bed, we can do that. We’ve just been used to sharing small beds since the ’30s.”
“Better!” Steve shouted back, “But next time don’t hit it straight back to me!”
He could have tried to lie about the condition of the radio, Tony mused, to get a better price for it. Intrigued by the first part of what he’d said as well, Tony asked, “So if you had the right equipment you could fix it?”
It could be anyone, but... why would Tony have called him out here to tell him this alone, if it’s not...?
“Stop. I don’t blame you for what happened to me.” His tone didn’t quite match his words--harsh, not just emphatic but barely holding back aggression.
Atop a foggy hill, two men who had come together for a duel now came together in a kiss.
“Jambalaya.” Steve glares at Tony, then looks to Clint. “Sorry.”
Clint bolted, and Tony raced after him, grinning as he sought to return the disgusting “gift”.
But as he put a hand on the door, he heard footsteps again. He fought back a sigh.
Figuring the setting just made it look different, he used a nearby mug as a vase and left it on the counter for Tony to find later.
Tony watches the majesty from under his umbrella, being sure to stay near the door, which he figures is a safe direction Steve won’t be sending the lightning--getting electrocuted by his boyfriend is not in his plans for the night. Steve hasn’t noticed him, and seems fully concentrated on his... training, Tony supposes this is.
There’s definitely something concerning in how the skin around Tony’s closed eyes wrinkle, in the tightness of his mouth.
He decides not to mention to Bucky that he lied on the health history form when he won the raffle, because like hell he was going to miss out on a chance to go skydiving, for
The second kid reached in and pulled out a small yellow flower--a marigold, Tony’s favorite, which Jarvis must’ve included to make him feel better on his first day in an unfamiliar place. The kid laughed, “What’s this, a flower from Mommy?” and threw it on the floor, stomping on it.
“Get Steve a water bottle to rinse out his mouth, I’ll pay you back for that and the shirt.”
Tony swallows visibly. “That would mean a lot to me.” He looks away, apparently embarrassed by the admission.
“Yeah? You gonna tell me how I’m supposed to do anything when I’m alone in a desert wasteland?”
Tony looks out the window. “They deserved it.”
Tony sighed, supposing that wasn’t too bad, and the team really did look miserable covered in the green goo. “Fine.”
Tony narrowed his eyes. “...you didn’t win just these, did you?”
Peter’s parents catch on to his secret identity.
Tony’s mouth drops open and his eyes widen.
“You’re late,” Steve responds, with what he’s sure is a ridiculously goofy smile, the endorphins of having Tony alive in his arms making him feel a little loopy.
“Uh-huh.” Bucky clearly didn’t believe him for a second. “Well, get over that... reflex.”
Then crying out as a bullet pierced his hand, forcing him to drop the weapon.
you, and pain meds don’t do shit for you, so all I can do is try to make sure you’re comfortable, okay?”
Finally, Tony gave in and spoke.  “Your intel was good.  We managed to take down your queen.”
“Um. What?” Tony asked, looking in confusion at the paramedic, then Steve, then Peter.
Tony starts to speak but coughs, and Steve releases his hand to help him drink a small amount of water to soothe his throat. “Poison?”
“He’ll be okay once we’re warm again,” Bucky answers. The look on his face suggests nightmares will be a strong possibility the next few nights, however.
“Crap, I’m so, so, sorry!” he panted out, once he could speak.
“I think usually a date or two generally happens before ideas like forever are discussed, doll.”
Bucky opened his mouth to reply, when suddenly there was an animalistic growl from inside the workshop.
He stops, falling to his knees. He would give anything right now for a single swallow of water.
On one side, Tony and Nat were half-hidden behind a large built-in grill, the latter having apparently done a much better job at avoiding incoming snowballs than his snow-covered husband. On the other, Clint sat about five feet up in a snow-covered swing set, while Peter handed him snowballs after only loosely packing them in small, mitten-covered hands. Clint’s aim was as impeccable as always--hitting Tony’s shoulder as he popped out to throw his own snowball that flew off its mark at the impact--but Peter just wasn’t able to make new ammo fast enough, and didn’t have the strength to throw a ball the distance between the two “forts.”
The littlest one races to join its siblings trying to grab the grapes that Clint and Thor are passing to each other (and occasionally letting the little ones grab). Nearby, their mother--as it turns out, “Little Tony” was female, and is no longer so little--sits in Steve’s lap, giving a contented croak once in a while as he pets her.
Steve has to take a moment to come down from the high of finally getting to kiss Tony, of having Tony explicitly return his feelings. “Can you at least try not to get yourself hurt in the process?”
“I wasn’t kidnapped, I was lost in a snowstorm. The dragon gave me shelter, then helped me find my way home the next morning.”
He wonders why no one else in the room reacts to the sound, why no one shoots her or orders him to kill her. Then he remembers her, recognizes her: the woman in the car with the target, the one he’d strangled. Is he going to be punished for not completing the job?
“You need sleep, too.” Natasha’s voice betrays no exhaustion, instead a hint of command that Tony has no interest in following.
“I’ll sleep when they’re home safe.” Because there is no other option.
“Good,” Tony said, and told himself the Skrull’s flinch didn’t bother him.
“Thank you,” Steve said emphatically. “Uh, can... can you wear it?”
When he heard his name, he opened his eyes, not realizing he’d closed them. Tony was holding out a mug, and Bucky was already sipping at his own, moaning in pleasure. “Hot chocolate?” Tony offered. “It’s just from powder, sorry, but it’ll help warm you up.”
“Soldier, focus,” comes an order he knows he needs to follow, but he can’t see around her. He tries to shift his head, to see behind her, but she just follows his movement.
Tony sighs, glaring over at the pile of fabric and straps on a table. “It’s distracting; it doesn’t let me move normally.”
“Legend says Fury trusts you to take care of his cat when he’s away.” (“Partly true.”) (Natasha’s amused smile makes Tony curious what could be only
Okay, maybe most of the reason he loved the shift was one particular customer: Tony.
Unfortunately, Tony does notice when his boyfriend doesn’t take a second bite of his burger.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said.
Tony shakes his head. “Nothing, it’s good, he...” Tony swallows. “He didn’t remember me, at least not at first, so I’m glad he remembers you.”
Tony bites his lip, trying to decide how much to say. “They were gonna hurt some other kids.”
“Careful, the floor’s a little--” He winced as Tony’s feet slid out from under him and he hit the floor. “--Slippery.” Steve rushed out from behind the counter, then slowed to avoid the same fate as he approached the fallen man. “Are you okay?”
“Coming right up,” Bucky said with a grin. He didn’t move.
Tony opens his mouth, then his eyes go distant for a moment. “...You’re right,” he agrees. “Sorry, Steve.”
This... this was Tony showing he loved Steve. Not just making the new suit for him, but understanding that continuing to fight with the team despite his current condition would be necessary to Steve’s emotional well-being. Not just knowing the maladies that had afflicted Steve before the serum, but accepting them and finding ways to work around them without preventing Steve from living his life.
“Thank you,” Tony said as they waited for their cones. “But I know your families don’t have that much, I could’ve paid for everybody.”
“So.” Steve’s voice was empty of inflection.
“Yeah, an’ don’t worry about not fittin’ in. We’re expert misfits, we’ll show you the ropes in no time,” Bucky promised with a grin.
He barely registered the voice behind him shouting, “Steve!”
“Hey, uh... I wanted to apologize.”
She sighs. He doesn’t remember clearly, but he thinks she used to be angry. Now she’s just sad.
“Fine,” Bucky said, rubbing a little at the sore spot on his head where the ball had hit. It wouldn’t even bruise, but he felt a little foolish that, as a trained supersoldier, he’d failed to avoid a projectile thrown in a simple game of catch.
Bucky jumped backward off the man, then shifted back himself.
Bucky looked between him and the equipment. “I told you I can’t afford the parts.”
Jarvis’ eyebrow twitches. “My mistake,” he says dryly, in a tone that Tony loves when it’s Jarvis annoying dad with his judgement of dad’s orders, but one that makes Tony feel small when it’s directed at him. “Would you like to tell me why you fired your science fair rocket near enough to your classmates to risk injury?”
He might’ve been particularly--what was the word Clint used, ‘hangry’?--when he’d said that, but it’s true soup is not his favorite, and Tony knows it. Unfortunately, biting into the burger had
Bucky stared at the thicket of leaves and vines, the greenery all that was visible through the glass walls. Well, most was behind the glass, but some had apparently managed to break through and was actively crawling its way along the outside of the walls, like a time-lapse video of ivy growing up a building.
“Five.”
“The subject of kinks I didn’t know you had is a pretty good one, but I guess we can put a pin in it for now.” Tony’s grin fades. “I do like it when you push me, when you make me do more than I think I can, I don’t want to stop that entirely.”
He’s trying to pay attention to the mission briefing, to see the documents on the target, but the woman is in his way, blocking his vision, and no one else seems to notice or care.
“And... we have a cat now?” The cat meowed at Bucky, as though answering in the affirmative.
“Were they that color before Clint got to them?” Natasha asks Thor, ignoring Clint.
“Mmm,” Steve hums, and shifts to pull Tony’s arm closer around his waist as he nuzzles again into Bucky’s chest.
“Yes, of course!” Tony answered vehemently, then winced as a wave of dizziness returned. “Maybe... in a day or two.”
Steve watched in horror as Iron Man swooped around and let the giant monstrosity get closer and closer with its enormous claws, until they reached the bay and Thor’s lightning, sparking through the water, finally downed it.
There, head sticking out from around the corner, was Clint, hair wet from the shower, holding a large water gun and grinning like a maniac.
When Bruce turns to head to the kitchen, the others go back to the game. But Steve feels Tony’s eyes on him as he goes back to sketching.
“Because I suspect you might have a mark that matches this.”
“Who are you?” Tony asked.
“Wait, Rhodey, also get a water bottle for, uh...?”
That got Tony moving faster, summoning the suit to him immediately. “Intruder?”
“The hell it’s not!” Steve burst out, then he stalked over to Tony and grabbed him by the shoulders. He continued, quieter but no less intense, “Tony, I agreed to this because I thought it would be all three of us together. I thought you wanted that. If you don’t, I’m not stepping out on you.”
“Are you here to bring me to... Steve?” There was a slight hesitation before saying his friend’s name.
“It was magic! I didn’t know if the suit would protect you, and you had no way to get out of the way in time,” Steve protests.
“Don’t call me that.”
Of course, that was when Clint wandered through, and Tony had the attention of the wrong person. “Ooh, sounds great, thanks!” Clint reached for the bright purple plum on top.
Something flickers across Tony’s face too fast for Steve to identify, but it gives him a moment of concern. Taking a guess, Steve emphasizes, “
Steve followed, sure now that this town--or rather, this mountain, with this dragon--was exactly where he needed to be to renew his purpose in life.
The mirror man’s mouth moved like his as he spoke, but while there was no verbal reply, the emotion in the eyes somehow changed to surprise.
, James,” she says again. “Don’t take that way out. Find a better way.”
Bucky stepped up on the armor’s right boot and put his metal arm around the waist, as Tony put his own arm around Bucky’s waist.
The door opens, and the principal and Jarvis step out. The principal gives him a stern glare before going back into his office. Jarvis just says, “Come along, Tony,” in a firm voice, and waits for Tony to follow him to the car.
“I went to the farmer’s market, your favorite stall, and I picked all the best, ripest, most delicious looking ones I could find.”
This dragon was red and gold, not the one from the tapestry. It stood nearly three times Steve’s height, and its wings looked like they might span forty feet stretched out, though they were pulled in at the moment, one wrapped in a pale linen that showed traces of a deep brown stain that might be dried blood. Sharp claws clacked on the ground as it walked toward Steve.
The next day, Bucky’s getting sick of all the food that doesn’t hurt his teeth, and watches with envy as Clint and Thor eat ice cream in front of him and he has to turn down their offer to share.
Steve hates how guarded Tony gets when he asks, “What do you mean?”
“Yes. Right,” Tony said, handing it over.
Partway through one such escape he was taking a brief rest, perched on a low branch near a lake and looking out at the sparkling water, when his instincts shouted
Steve gave him his number and sent him on his way, confident he was awake enough at least to get home alright. Then he cleaned up the spilt coffee and soggy danish and mopped again.
“A robot fish?”
“You’re a husky.”
He tried to tell himself that was why he hadn’t wanted his parents to know, because they’d worry. But the truth was, he’d been afraid they’d try to stop him from being Spider-Man. But they were giving him a new suit, so they couldn’t be, right?
Bucky gently rolled him onto his side so he could vomit safely on the ground, softly murmuring reassurances the whole time.
“I thought I’d offer to help to protect you.”
Steve rests his hand on Tony’s waist, presses a kiss to his head, and whispers, “I love you.”
“...ffee?” Tony mumbled, seeing that his boyfriend was already awake in bed next to him.
“Yep, almost set up!”
A mischievous glint his eyes, Steve eyed his target while tossing a ball from hand to hand, getting a feel for it. Then he pulled his arm back and threw.
” Tony demanded, stepping up into the now-crowded ambulance and pulling his son into a tight hug, then pulling back to look him over. In addition to the oxygen mask, Tony now saw a bandage on one hand, and some scratches on his arms. “Are you okay?” Before giving Peter a chance to answer, he turned to the paramedic. “Is he okay?”
“...So is that a yes?”
“What. The. Hell,” Tony demanded, faceplate up so his incredulous expression was visible as he took in the scene.
Iron Man acts as bait and takes a hit.
She makes a face and looks about to protest, but after a pointed look from Tony she says, “Okay, Daddy.”
Thor smiles brightly. “Indeed, storelskas eat plants very similar to some Midgardian vegetables and fruits.”
But in the creature’s final throes, it caught Iron Man with two sharp claws, puncturing his shoulder and slamming the man into the sizzling waves.
“You think it’s gonna answer you?” Bucky asked, smirking and relaxing back on his side of the boat again.
In less than a minute, the transformation was complete.
“But I won’t stop loving you, Tony,” R’klin said, and his chin raised, his eyes flashed not like a confident alien conqueror, but like a determined, unyielding Steve Rogers.  “He may not have had feelings for you, but that doesn’t mean my feelings weren’t real.  I’m sorry we started out as a lie, but it became more real than anything I have ever known.  I love you.”
kill you, so I’m doing my damnedest to minimize the chances of that.” He turned away, fingers pulling up a few figures on a holographic display. “Hydraulics will help you use the shield despite decreased muscle mass, and I’ve added electromagnets to make catching it easier--I expect your reaction time won’t be what you’re used to. The HUD will account for your diminished eyesight and color blindness. Most suits already monitor vitals, but this one will also be able to administer things like a bronchodilator if it detects breathing issues...”
Steve took what he was handed--a gauntlet? It looked like an unfinished piece of Iron Man armor, though smaller than normal. Steve let it close over his hand, and it fit.. well, like a glove. “What... what is this?” he asked, looking up at Tony.
“It warped Miss Potts’ mind!” the loudest of the men at the bar protested. “Tried to poison her against her own kind, to lead us to the slaughter. We’ve got to kill it before it kills all of us.”
“That’s really handy,” Bucky said. “How much would you charge to make me something like that?”
“Sorry, guess we’ll have to go back home for those.”
Then, as he was still chewing, Bucky glanced back in the basket. His eyes widened, and he gasped.
But his boyfriend eyes his food choices suspiciously over the next day or two. And certain impact activities like running or jumping jar Bucky’s teeth painfully, and he catches Natasha narrowing her eyes at his occasional winces. Steve seems to notice something’s off as well, but accepts Bucky’s casual brush-offs.
But at some point in late November, a six-foot, slightly lopsided, actual spruce tree appeared in the common room. (Well, not appeared as in
Steve watched him with the others, and he wasn’t just back to normal. He was smiling more than he had in a long time. Maybe before Ultron, maybe more than he ever had since he’d met Steve.
But before changing into more relaxing clothes, he wanted to drop off the gift he’d picked up for his boyfriend. The splash of color on the barren alien landscape had caught his eye, and the bright blue petals had reminded him of Tony’s arc reactor, so he’d plucked one flower and placed it gently in his pocket before they headed home.
Normally averse to people he didn’t know handing him things, Tony didn’t want to keep his good Samaritan out in the cold any longer, so he made himself reach out to take the paper. “Thank you, Steve. I’m Tony.”
But after he completes his mission, instead of reporting back to base, he gets on a plane for Afghanistan.
Clint and Thor whoop in joy, while Steve just says sincerely, “Thank you, Tony.”
, he’s your friend!” She’s shouting the same things the target is saying, but he can’t listen to either of them. He has to complete his mission.
“If you’ll still have me.”
Tony yawned as he stepped into the elevator, feeling more exhausted by putting out SI metaphorical fires all week than he did when pulling all-nighters and putting out literal fires in the workshop (which also included trying to prevent DUM-E from spraying the fire-suppression foam over every surface even after the fire was out).
Not anymore.
“But Pepper knew I, well, ‘fancied’ someone else.”
“I could say the same for you,” Tony replied. The man’s royal blue sweater brought out his lovely blue eyes, and his cheeks looked a healthier pink than the pale hue they’d been in the cold the other day.
“Sorry, huh?” Tony’s face has gone oddly blank.
Tony sighed, looking down at the ground. At his phone, which was now lying face down in the slush on the sidewalk.
“Dr. Rosenfeld and her assistant.”
“Analyzing.”
Their embrace turned into a passionate kiss, only to be broken when the rest of the team showed up to get their own reassurances that Tony was alive and well. (The others did not get quite the same kind of reassurance as Steve did, of course.)
“You literally gave me the coat off your back, but you won’t accept a little thank you cash?” Tony didn’t understand what was happening here.
Tony thought for half a second, then made up his mind.
“I’m not a man. I’m a weapon.”
It wasn’t necessarily a suicide mission. If he survived, he would find a way back, Tony’d promised.
“Oh, god...” Steve has to rest a hand on the wall to steady himself at the sudden light-headed feeling that overcomes him when he sees the injured man’s face. “
Finally, the footsteps faded and there was silence. Tony thought it might be safe to get out of here.
“Is it broken?” Tony asks with concern, reaching out a hand but not touching.
“Sir, I am detecting an energy buildup...”
Suddenly a thought occurs to Steve and his stomach churns in horror. He has to swallow and breathe through his nose a few times to be sure he isn’t actually going to vomit. “You didn’t... how many...” He swallows again. “How many other times have you wanted me to stop, but not safeworded because you were afraid I’d leave?” God, had he unknowingly
Steve shrugs, and goes back to sketching.
Later, he found a moment to talk to Rhodey.

Takes place in the 5-years during Endgame, but also kind of an AU.
He refused to give in to the tiny piece of him that was still anxious, that maybe the last word really would trigger something, even though he
When the
Steve’s honestly surprised Tony waits until they’re back in the quinjet to slide back the faceplate and yell at him. While it’s not always easy to read Tony’s body language while in the armor, the jerky movements and clipped responses when they were waiting for SHIELD to haul off the villainess made his anger pretty obvious.
“I didn’t want the other kids to get in trouble,” Tony admits.
Bucky sees the moment understanding comes over Tony’s face, and is for once grateful that his boyfriend has seen some of the footage of what he went through with Hydra, so Bucky doesn’t have to say anything else.
“A mermaid.”
He tracks the target down a day later, but the task is harder with the armed escort, and he takes a couple bullets.
Bucky woke up as they were dragging him through a familiar hallway.
“They are storelskas!” Thor announces, and while Natasha would have preferred to ease Tony into the fact that they aren’t from Earth, she sees the other part of her plan is proceeding just as she’d expected.
“I am,” she confirms. “I take it you won. At a price.”
When the fire truck pulled up to the site, Steve was alarmed to get out and see his teenage son’s best friend Ned standing there, looking in horror at the burning building.
After Tony’s cleaned up a bit, he moves the tissues aside and makes eye contact with Steve. “I’m sorry.”
“What? No...” Tony looked honestly bewildered.
Sorry I missed posting yesterday, I was not feeling well.
“You don’t attack the people in town, apparently only eating animals. People come up here to attack you, and you could probably kill them all, but you don’t, do you?”
Then Clint asks what should be a safe question, “Do you want in?”
“Really, I’d love to court you, if--but wait, I’m forgetting myself, doing everything out of order.” He stuck out a hand. “I’m Tony Stark, and you are?”
“You tried to kill yourself?” The question slips out without consideration, as a chill goes through Steve, like he could suddenly find himself in a world where Tony had died years before Steve was thawed. The thought hurts more than he would have expected.
At that, Steve’s face softened. “Oh.” He smiled. “So... Should I ask again?”
The meal is a little more awkward than usual, as people seem to avoid addressing Steve at all, presumably so they don’t accidentally let a question slip out that he wouldn’t want to answer. He appreciates it and resents it at the same time.
So he was stuck going to seventh grade at a local school, getting dirty looks for still having nicer clothes and supplies than everyone, and being smarter than everyone, and generally not knowing anything about this new world he was stuck in.
Through it all, there were moments when Steve was briefly distracted by the cold, by the chill seeping into his bones and gripping his heart.
He sees the relief he feels mirrored on Bucky’s face as he looks up at Tony from under the blanket. Steve is huddled practically in Bucky’s lap, face tucked into his chest, and doesn’t react to the sound of Tony’s voice.
Bucky sighed. “Doesn’t matter, I need the--”
The man looked up, brow wrinkling. “Probably, but I can’t afford it.”
“Of course you are,” sneered Tiberius Stone, “You’re a filthy pirate. But you’ll be disappointed to find we’ve not much gold aboard at the moment. You’ve wasted your time and injured my ship for nothing.”
With Steve’s shouted warning, Tony had managed to turn enough that now he’s on his back, Steve lying on top of him. A gauntlet raises to blast the offending robot to pieces, then drops back down as the faceplate retracts.
“It’s too much, isn’t it? You were happy when you thought it was just a light, but I made it creepy, I--”
Steve was half dozing when he suddenly realized he was feeling a tug on his line.
Something occurs to Steve. “When you talked to the sorceress, did you happen to get an answer from her about how long this would last?”
Tony swallowed.  “That’s the type of thing you say when you’re trying to get someone to let you out.”
“You do know the pitcher’s on the other team, right?” Bucky asked from behind him. “He catches it, you’re out.”
It wasn’t decorated at first, or all at once. Instead, every day or two something new showed up on the tree.
Apparently he won’t be eating that burger after all.
“Why?”
“Got it,” Steve interrupted. “Thanks, Ned.”
“And you didn’t feel like sharing with the rest of us because...?”
He fought back the tears threatening, because he needs to
At JARVIS’ warning, Tony shouted through the comms, “Everybody get back, it’s going to--!”
There!
“‘Course I did,” Tony replies, wrapping his arms more tightly around Steve. “Couldn’t leave my best guys out in the middle of nowhere.” He doesn’t mention the cold, afraid acknowledging it will only make it worse.
Tony shrugs, like hiring house-call dentists is something anyone would do for their trauma-ridden partner. “I just don’t like seeing you in pain.” He smiles. “Now, what do you think about pizza for dinner?”
Looking down at Morgan's table, he decides he might break the little plastic chair if he tries to sit in it, so instead he just kneels on the ground beside it. “This is a very fancy tea party you have here,” he says. There are several plastic teacups--not a drop of liquid in any of them, which is a bit of a relief--and saucers and even some little candles with plastic “flame”. In one of the three chairs at the table sits a large plush spider wearing a little bow tie and a top hat.
The kid who’d eaten Tony’s sandwich tensed, then scowled. “Come on, Jack, let’s go, they’re not worth it.”
“Uh,” Tony said.
Bucky tries not to let anyone else know what’s wrong. When Tony asks how he’s feeling, he answers honestly that his jaw is perfectly fine.
Tony looks a little flustered, and tries to cover it by joking, “Well, you and the mail carrier, it’s the uniform, I think, it just--” He cuts himself off as Steve reaches out to take his hands.
Steve’s heart soared to hear that familiar voice. “Tony!” he shouted, not caring at the moment that the ecstatic grin on his face was probably ruining his appearance as a cold-hearted pirate. All he cared about was the fact that the man he’d loved, whom he hadn’t seen for years, was now standing a mere dozen feet away, gaping at him.
Steve raised his eyebrows. Maybe there would be something to do here after all. Though the “most come back” claim seemed odd, from what he knew of dragons. “Does the dragon endanger the townsfolk?”
The qualifier ‘currently’ doesn’t make Steve feel much better.
“Perhaps,” Steve said, noncommittally. He looked back toward the woman, Miss Potts, who frowned and shook her head, looking almost beseeching at Steve.
Peter’s parents are not happy to discover he ran into a burning building to save a cat.
“What were you
“Mmm, tasty. Blueberry, right? Mind if I have some more?”
Steve shrugged. “I think anyone can use a brother at arms to fight beside when defending oneself or others. And I think maybe if the townsfolk think to bring a large enough party to attack at the same time, you’re going to get hurt worse than that,” he pointed at the wounded wing. Then he shrugged. “And I think you could use a friend--another, I suppose, since you already have Miss Potts.”
Then he chucks it into a nearby trash bin and turns to a dark-skinned man smirking nearby. “Stop laughing at me, Platypus, and go buy me a new shirt before I get kicked out of here.” He points to a nearby shop that would probably enforce ‘no shirt, no shoes, no service’ faster than the park itself. “Get the cheesiest one you can find. Ooh, maybe they have one that says ‘My soulmate barfed on me at Coney Island and all I got was this lousy t-shirt’!”
“I love you, too,” he says. “And I’m never going to let you get hurt if I can stop it.”
Tony burrowed his head into Bucky’s neck, where Bucky felt his smile. “Pet me all you want, love.”
“I grew two inches!” Morgan announces proudly.
“No, you’re faster than I am, you have to be the one to make it out. You’re our only chance.”
“Hey, Cap, what’s up?”
Nat nodded, gripped his shoulder briefly, then left him alone.
“You said you’d had enough of soup back in the Depression and if you never had soup again it would be too soon.”
Later, Tony didn’t remember any of it.
Steve opens his eyes to see Tony doing the same, and he smiles.
“I still feel bad I pushed you out of bed, doll,” Bucky says. “Let me make it up to you?”
“Right,” Bucky said, “Just a misunderstanding, of course, I’ll just leave you two...” He started to turn away.
along the lines of ‘no’ or ‘I can’t’, I’m going to stop and ask what you need, and you’re going to tell me. If you need to keep going, we can. If you need to stop and cuddle, then we’ll do that.”
At that, Steve’s head comes up, apparently a bit more aware now. “T’ny? Found us?” he asks in a whisper.
It has to have been sabotage, for the tracker to stop working before the plane even went down. The radio had still been working, though, so Tony had the agony of listening to Steve and Bucky as they fought to keep the craft in the air, but somehow sparing the time to try to reassure their boyfriend who sat hundreds of miles away, unable to do a damn thing about it. Their final--
passing out because of the wound I gave you?” He put a hand over the leaves to keep pressure on the wound.
The man didn’t reply at first, but he stopped moving and a moment later, answered, “Tony.”
Steve knows Tony and Pepper could be finishing up just about anything, and they certainly wouldn’t be doing anything risque during the day with their daughter around and a guest showing up shortly, but he still has to force the uncomfortable image out of his mind and focus on Morgan.
Taking one more deep breath of icy air, his eyes clear, Tony’s about to close the faceplate again when he sees it.
“Keep moving. Stay alive. Do not give up hope.”
, Steve thinks, as their lips meet.
They looked at each other and, in sync, hold out their gifts: Iron Man, Captain America, and Winter Soldier plushes.
Hearing the words Tony bit out in unconcealed anger, Steve thought that maybe it hadn’t been one of his brightest ideas.
“No, I’m fine.”
When the door to the workshop opens and Steve walks in, Tony unthinkingly raises his left arm in greeting...
“Oh, well, that makes it okay, then,” Tony retorted, voice dripping with sarcasm. “It happened over an hour ago, just how long is this supposed to last?”
“That’s so impressive,” Bucky replied, “Everything you build is so amazing.”  He enjoyed the resulting blush on his boyfriend’s face.
Former knight Steve hears about a dangerous dragon and goes to take action.
He invited them all inside, and didn’t look at Steve again once.
to show off when you’re capable of something incredible.”
It looked like a watch, except instead of having a clock, the face showed simply a soft blue glow.
“No shit?”
“I don’t want to lose you.” Bucky’s voice broke on the last words.
“Sorry, I was distracted by Steve’s arms in that shirt. I mean, are you
When the man opens the door, Maria gasps, hands reaching out to hover near his face. “Oh, mio bambino...” she whispers, shedding the tears of a mother seeing her son for the first time in years.
I may try to catch up, or I may just remain a bit behind, but my current plan is to finish all the Inktober prompts even if I miss a day here and there and end up going into November.
When Steve sees one of the robots aiming its powerful energy weapon at Iron Man’s back, he knows his shield won’t bounce back to him in time, so he doesn’t hesitate to race forward, shouting Tony’s name.
“I told you not to waste your life. Yet here you are, giving up.” Tony’s hallucination looks down at him in disappointment.
“You don’t have to let them use you. Run away. Find yourself.”
“Were they doing something they shouldn’t have been doing?”
The game starts pretty low-risk:
“Better,” Bucky agrees. “Thank you.”
“Something tells me you’d be even more distracted if I did that.”
Tony is working on his escape from a kidnapping when he hears a familiar tread.
“That’s a relief,” Steve says.
“I did,” he answered, clutching his creation to his chest. It gave a little coo.
“No!” the Skrull protested, then seemed to force himself to calm.  “The moment we kissed, that first time--that was the moment I decided to betray my world.  You became all that mattered.”
The dragon’s head jerked back in surprise. “That’s... that’s ridiculous, a dragon being bullied.”
Steve wasn’t sure how Tony knew that, but indeed, less than a minute later, he saw the cabin in the distance.
“The man versus the legend. I like it,” Tony says.
Tony crossed his arms and stared silently at the alien.
they’ve shifted, closing the gap between them, possibly to take advantage of the warmth he’d left behind. That means he’s not getting back in the middle, but that’s fine, there’s now some space between Bucky and the edge of the bed where Tony should be able to fit.
“He said it was temporary,” Steve defended.
Steve wants to say. But of course he can’t. He can’t even say he’s “fine”, apparently. So he says nothing.
Steve looks back at Tony, who grins and shrugs like he doesn’t care what Steve’s response is, but whose eyes are broadcasting a hopeful vulnerability.
The Skrull--R’klin--hesitated.  “He didn’t.”
Bucky gets Tony a present that he really shouldn’t have.
He closes his eyes.
An intriguing customer visits Tony’s repair shop.
But that afternoon, while Bucky’s reading a book in a recliner in the common area, Tony comes in with a bottle and hands it to him.
The guy pursed his lips, but then agreed, taking out a little notebook and scribbling something down with pale, stiff fingers, before tearing out the sheet to hand it to Tony. “I’m Steve. My roommate Bucky might answer the door, you can just give the coat to him if I’m not home.”
Tony’s eyes widened. “Seriously?”
Apparently the poison from the blade was actually a tranquilizer--but a tranquilizer meant to take down a supersoldier is still potentially deadly to an baseline human. Especially one who already has heart issues, like Tony.
“God, this stuff
Steve looks somewhere between tempted and worried. “I won’t promise to answer everything.”
A small red dot appeared on the floor, drawing the cat’s attention. As the cat--Snowball--moved, the dot moved, and Snowball bounded across the floor to chase it. A moment later, DUM-E followed.
Steve nods. “And--every time I answer, I get to ask about something in return. I might not have the same history on you all that everyone seems to have on Captain America, but I’ve read your files, heard stories, seen videos.”
The tension dropped from Steve’s body as his mouth hung open in shock. “Excuse me?”
Barnes gave him that haunted look again, but this time Rhodes thought there was a hint of frustration in it. “No.”
“I’m fine,” Bucky reassured him, “And, no, seems like she’s pretty harmless.”
“Are you the Ancient One?” he asks, voice croaking.
He hoped Steve would aim straight for his heart. He’d already broken it, might as well finish the job.
“Legend says Rebirth doubled the size of your dick.” (“False.”) (Tony nearly chokes on his beer when Steve adds, “Thankfully, since it was already hard to find underwear that fit.”)
Tony sprung back from the man who had just appeared in the flesh in front of him. Behind him, the mirror’s frame remained, but the glass was gone.
Bucky shakes his head. “I’m just... thinking soup instead.” If he doesn’t open his mouth much, talking isn’t too bad.
“If I were, I’d have left the suit on,” Tony replied. “Can I come in?”
Thor brings some alien pets to the Tower. Natasha has a plan to convince Tony to let them stay.
“I second this,” Thor agreed, “I desire as much as possible of the hearty Earth dish jambalaya.”
“Insulting Clint and not eating jambalaya isn’t going to give me my old life back,” Steve says with a hint of bitterness.
Pops placed a comforting hand on Dad’s shoulder, then told Peter, “That brings us to what we want from you.”
Steve waits, but Tony doesn’t continue. “But?” he prompts.
Tony knew the green candy canes had to be from Rhodey, and knew from experience to avoid them. (Unlike Clint, who shouted in disgust when he discovered they were pickle-flavored.)
Bucky stopped, then looked at Tony. “So... you want your boyfriend to date me, but you don’t want me?”
Steve sits in a bewildered silence. He wants to refute what Tony said, but part of him says that since Tony’s under the truth spell, what he said must be true, so refuting it would be a lie, so he can’t. Another part of him tries to insist that Tony’s speaking what he
Bucky still didn’t look up, but he said, “Thanks, doll.”
Steve’s brow furrowed. He did know, or at least, that was the Tony he’d known before. But that wasn’t the Tony he’d interacted with since their return from Wakanda.
“Now, it’s okay if you don’t have feelings for me, but if you do, I’d really like to take you on a date.”
so you can see how this could’ve been even worse.”
“You didn’t say anything about ricochets in the rules,” Bucky pointed out.
“...what?”
Tony finds an enchanted mirror.
“What does this have to do with...” Steve trailed off as he realized the answer, a pit forming in his stomach.
Steve, who’d been sketching quietly in the corner, looked up. “I think everyone’s been assuming you would,” he answered matter-of-factly.
Wait.
JARVIS picked up on the issue, and tried to help. Keeping the lights at 5% helped Steve see that Tony was breathing, but since the light was just diffuse around the room, rather than coming from Tony, it didn’t prevent Steve’s waking in a panic.
Steve meets his soulmate in the most embarrassing way possible.
Tony bent down, scratched the cat under the chin (which it seemed to appreciate, so at least it wasn’t feral) and then pressed something on the back of its small helmet.
What surprised Steve was Tony’s reaction when his eyes landed on
The next decoration looked like tinsel or frost at first, but upon closer inspection turned out to be strands of Peter’s webbing, carefully draped to avoid it sticking to any of the more precious decorations.
, which wasn’t outside the realm of possibility given some of the things they’d seen. Tony assumed someone had brought it in, he just hadn’t bothered to ask who.)
. It’s... a gift for you.”
After they all got their ice cream, they were headed to the outdoor seating area to enjoy the breezy summer afternoon, when suddenly someone pushed by Tony in a rush, shoving his cone up into his face.
Tony came in multiple times a week, usually after two in the morning. Sometimes he was bright and cheerful and rambled; Steve didn’t understand much of it but it was clear the man was some sort of genius inventor. Other times he was half asleep, barely coherent, and Steve found himself wanting to wrap the man up and put him to bed instead of serving him coffee.
Tony was just finishing up a watch repair when the door opened with a ring of the bell. “Be with you in a minute,” he said without looking up.
After the relief of finding them, Tony’s exhaustion from earlier comes back full force, and he’s nearly asleep by the time the quinjet arrives to take them home.
“No!” Tony said, quickly putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “No, I mean yes, I mean--stay there, of course I’m going to say yes, I’m not an idiot, you just have to give me a moment to cope with the fact that you beat me to it. I--your ring isn’t ready yet.”
Thor says the spell is unlikely to hold longer than a day, but he’ll request assistance from his mother if it doesn’t fade in that time. Bruce checks him over just to be sure nothing is wrong from a medical standpoint.
Tony downed the mug’s contents, rejoicing in the necessary morning fuel, then stared at Bucky. “Did you--you built me a coffee delivery bot?”
Bucky blacks out.
Steve chuckles, then pulls him in for another kiss, a longer one that Tony enthusiastically returns.
Tony feels a surge of relief, and has to turn to look out the window so Jarvis doesn’t see the tears in his eyes.
as she sailed away, Steve held Tony tightly in his arms. “I thought I’d never see you again. I can’t believe you’re here in my arms.”
Tony sighed, wishing his son hadn’t picked up his pop’s noble, heroic, self-sacrificing traits. He looked at Peter, trying to just feel relieved the kid was (mostly) okay.
And immediately regrets it.
“Given my luck it’s probably an old boot,” Steve grumbled, but he still felt excitement as he pulled his rod back and started reeling it in.
“Yes,” Steve answers, not sure if he’s answering the letter or the spirit of the question, but he steps aside to let Tony in anyway.
Steve wisely doesn’t say, but Tony seems to know he’s thinking it anyway.
Steve most definitely does. He figures JARVIS probably can’t get addresses on those individuals, but might ask later anyway.
Tony swallowed, trying to make this new information make sense in his head. “Does that mean... you’ll come home?”
There were times Tony took his order to go, but more often than not he sat at a table for a while tapping away on a tablet--or, if it were a mostly-unconscious day, staring into space. Today he started heading for his preferred table--unoccupied, like all the other tables at the moment--when Steve realized the recently-mopped floors might pose a hazard.
Steve doesn’t want people to worry about him; Tony worries anyway.
Which Tony takes as reason to keep talking. “It’s... terrifying, to show vulnerability. For me, the world’s pretty much always known what a mess I am, and it’s been easier to just lean in. But the darker thoughts? The desire to just escape everything? I wouldn’t have opened up to Rhodey about that if he hadn’t walked in on me holding the razor.”
He shakes his head. He doesn’t have a name.
“Perhaps we should refrain from asking the good Captain further questions until the spell has faded,” Thor suggests, as though anyone believes Tony doesn’t know what he’s doing.
“Okay, first,” Tony says, seeming to wake up a bit, “‘Doll’ makes you sound like a 1920s gangster... but I think I like it, so feel free to keep saying that.”
Then Dad opened a silver case that was sitting on the table, revealing... a Spider-Man costume?
Steve’s grip on Tony’s hand tightens, though he stops himself before tightening enough to actually hurt Tony. “Who did this to you?”
“We’re going to take care of this,” Tony said firmly, “And then I’m going to show you
“Yeah, yeah... at least they’re small.”
“I’m sorry, what did you just say? I must have misheard you, because what I
He’s carrying a bag of groceries back to his current safehouse when Maria gasps, and he stops in the middle of the sidewalk to look at her.
The expression on his face must convey his emotions almost as well as the truth spell does, because Tony gives him an apologetic grin. “Yeah, sorry, I know you probably don’t want to see me right now, but...” His face turns serious. “Ask me something you don’t think you’d normally get an honest answer from me about.”
Tony’s eyes widened slightly, but he nodded, face still serious. “I can do that. If you want me to.”
As much as he enjoyed building, creating, and making use of the world of human invention, sometimes he needed an escape. As a parrot, the joy of soaring over the trees overtook any human concerns like deadlines, stocks, and public relations disasters. He was wild and free, if only until he had to change back again.
It probably won’t be any less distracting than the sling, but it’s... nice. Steve’s arms around him, the solid presence at his back, bring the comforting feeling of being cared for. Instead of frustrating straps holding him in place, he has a loving boyfriend holding him, just wanting to keep him from hurting himself.
He’d managed to escape from the cell where his kidnappers (goddamn Hydra, again, would they ever get rid of them?) had been holding him, but had yet to make it out of the facility. He hadn’t even gotten his hands on a weapon better than the spray bottle of bleach he’d found in the closet. So when he’d heard multiple groups of footsteps passing by, he’d decided to wait it out rather than risk a confrontation.
At first he thought it was a new bot, though smaller than the others. Then he realized that, while most of the four-legged body was covered in smooth metal styled in a familiar red and gold, there were definitely a furry little white head and ears sticking up out of the helmet.
“I can’t tell you that,” James answers, preferring to remain mysterious than to try to lie. “I just know she’d want you to have it.”
Steve takes a few steps closer, not as sure about this one as Rhodey was. “Legend says you have feelings for me now.”
Bucky let his tongue hang out, clearly smiling at Tony’s reaction.
There were sounds in his ear, voices over the comms, but he couldn’t quite make sense of them. He should probably reply.
“Dummy!”
“Thanks,” Steve managed, reaching out to take the mug and shifting slightly to avoid spilling the hot beverage.
“That’s the
Tony tilts his head back just enough to give a pointed look at Steve’s crotch. While he has no intent on continuing their earlier activity, his dick has not yet gotten that message. “You have needs. You may as well take care of them yourself if I can’t.”
Tony shrugs dismissively. “Like Nat said, it wasn’t fair--I decided to make it fair.”
Tony gives a mumble that might be “I love you, too”, then falls asleep, safe in Steve’s arms.
“He and Mommy are finishing something, he said I was supposed to ‘entertain’ you, so come on,” Morgan grabs his hand and starts pulling him to a little table set up out on the lawn.
“Exactly,” Bucky agreed, though the truth was that when he’d signaled he hadn’t been a hundred percent sure she was harmless. And even now, it seemed safer to depart with his armored boyfriend than to walk out alone and assume she had no backup plan. Still, it was more fun to banter flippantly with said boyfriend than to let the woman who’d tried to use him believe she’d accomplished anything. “I’m dating the richest man in New York, gotta travel in style.”
Natasha smiles. She knew her plan would work.
That would explain the couple of cushions too small for the dragon’s massive form, if he had a human visitor.
“Then maybe you shouldn’t have gone and died for me,” Tony bites out, channeling his anger and frustration about the man’s actions rather than give into the guilt and grief.
“I know, and that’s not the point!” Tony shouted. “You act like your healing factor means the injury, the
“You looked like you needed it more than I did,” the guy said matter-of-factly, even as he shivered.
“Barnes.”
Oh. Wow.
“Quinjet’s on its way, should be less than ten minutes,” Tony says. Then he takes a deep breath and steps out of the suit into the cold, moving to share his own body heat with his freezing boys. And, “J, toaster mode.”
Bruce gives him a sad smile.
A few days later, Bucky was playing catch with DUM-E, watching the bot’s movement intently, though he probably should have been paying more attention to the path of the ball itself.
Tony doesn’t want to wear his sling, but Steve doesn’t want him to hurt himself.
“Oh,” Tony said again, but this time with a smile.
Tony grins. “What do you have in mind?”
“Thank you,” Tony replied, then thought maybe that wasn’t the right response.
Tony’s a little out of it after taking a hit in battle. Bucky takes care of him.
“Maybe you could stand right behind me and show me how to hold the bat again?”
Tony says in almost a whisper.
There were a million questions running through Tony’s mind--
“Okay... one game, just you and me, with you actually trying. I wanna see this.”
This is the second
He was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by his grinning boyfriends as the elevator doors opened.
At the look of confusion on Tony’s face, Steve’s heart sank.
Other times, he thinks about the nonchalant way the others have adapted group meals to make sure Steve has something he likes, not just tolerates. He thinks about how Tony modified the Mario Kart game to give Steve an actual challenge, and even built out the off-road areas to let him explore. He thinks about the photos and other mementos from the Howling Commandos that Tony dug up to give him a more physical connection to his past.
Maria helps him figure out how to get the tracking device out of his arm.
Sometimes.
“Cap,” Natasha said, and Tony had a feeling he wouldn’t like what was coming, “What I’m hearing is that Iron Man is volunteering for clean-up duty.”
of them. Emptied the booth.”
More awkwardness would have been reasonable. Anger. Fear, even. Somewhere deep inside he realized he’d even hoped for a glint of happiness, a sign that maybe after everything Tony had missed him, at least a little.
“Stay awake, doll,” Bucky coaxed. “Come on, tell me about that anklet of yours. If it stays on when you’re in bird form, isn’t it too tight as a human?”
“That’s...” Barnes gave a heavy sigh. “That’s not what happened.”
Snuggled under a warm blanket, with a fire crackling, hot chocolate in hand, and both lovers tucked in close, Steve finally started to feel warm.
“Tony.” Steve waits for the other man to meet his eyes. “I can’t...” He plans to say he can’t believe Tony would do this, but that’s not true. “I don’t like that you endangered yourself with the sorceress, but I appreciate that you were willing to do this for me.” Even ignoring the physical danger, Tony opening himself up to this kind of vulnerability by choice, just for Steve...
Bucky closes his eyes, but it makes the image more clear so he opens them again. He shakes his head, not wanting to talk about it but at the same time wanting Tony to know and he doesn’t know which is going to win. “It’s... the chair.”
