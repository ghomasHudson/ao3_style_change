That’s why, Dean tells himself, he’s spent so much time trying to think of what to give Cas this Christmas. It’s hard to top Cas’s gift-giving skills. He has always had an unnerving knack for somehow knowing exactly what Dean wants, even before Dean knows it himself. Not that Dean would tell him, but all his most treasured gifts over the years have all been from Cas. A wonky, handmade wooden impala car Cas made in his Dad’s workshop when he was twelve. Zeppelin concert tickets the Christmas they were both fifteen. Last year, an anthology of Neruda with Cas’s scrawling writing on the opening page, which Dean has read more than the poems the book contains (not that he’d admit that to Cas).
This time, Cas feels Dean’s smile against his lips for a moment before he sinks into it, letting out a soft sigh and tilting Cas’s jaw to deepen the kiss. Cas has kissed people before, of course, but he was always aware of it being kissing, often a little disjointed, a little awkward. This is so good that he forgets to think about it anything at all, so good that he feels dizzy with it, Dean’s hands and mouth on him like they’ve always belonged there.
“I can –” Dean bites off another groan as another wave of the smell of Cas’s hot, heady blood washes over him, even more intense than before. He clenches jaw against the fangs he can feel itching to descend further, hands curled into fists where he’s cuffed against the bedframe. “God. I can
“Uh – I’d better get going,” Dean does smile then, although it’s a quieter thing than the cheeky, flirtatious grin Cas is used to. It somehow makes his stomach somersault even more, warmth spreading through him. Dean rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, and fumbles in his pocket for his wallet, sliding a note across the counter towards Cas. “Can’t be late for meeting Sammy, but – uh – I’ll be sure to come in tomorrow for another one of these,” he nods at the green tea Cas has just made him. “Keep the change.”
“Dean,” Cas is holding the wrapped present, but he’s not looking at it. He’s looking at Dean with the kind of familiar, earnest sincerity that makes Dean’s heart ache, that he’s going to miss so much. “There is no chance of me ever forgetting you,” Cas says slowly, and the
“King of good, actually,” Dean is still looking at him, when Cas glances up, expression still warm but also little hesitant, “I guess maybe I’m not too bad in the brainy department after all. I’ve just been given an interview tomorrow for an engineering degree.”
“It was just in here with your Dad’s old phone, under the map,” Cas replies, turning it over interestedly in his hands. There’s a faded image on the front he can’t quite make out, worn green and silver and gold. The colours of Dean’s eyes, as he looks at Cas in the half-light of the unfolding road. “What is it?”
“My apologies,” Cas says, impatiently. “I believe I have some relevant information about the ghoul infestation in Montana,” he presses on, as though he didn’t just nearly cause a road traffic accident and Dean’s heart isn’t currently trying to escape the confines of his ribs. “I have brought some documents I believe may be of great use.”
Dean’s expression shutters slightly, before being quickly masked by his characteristic carefree grin. “Oh?” he scrubs at his mouth briefly, glances down at his hand, “Got it?”
“Of course it was about you,” Dean tells him in disbelief, “You were practically eye-fucking me while stripping in my backseat. It’s a wonder the car is still intact.”
Then Cas glances up and catches sight of Dean’s face – and his heart stops in horror. Smudged across Dean’s lower lip and chin are the blue inky imprints of Cas’s number.
“I would like that,” Cas smiles at the thought of getting to taste a little piece of Dean’s history, watches as the lights get brighter and the car slows, pulling into the empty gas station.
“Sure, yes, of course,” he stammers, ducking under the counter to pull out the tin of loose-leaf tea. “Something new. Great. Do you want it to go?”
“Help yourself to something from the display,” Cas gestures in the direction of the home-baking he’d put out just before Dean had arrived. “On the house.”
Dean closes his eyes against the agonising ache throbbing through him. He can feel the heat of Cas’s blood increasing, the rush of it louder, hotter. It’s unbearable.
“I don’t –” Dean hisses and yanks instinctively at his restraints as Cas swallows visibly, drawing attention to the pulse hammering in his throat. “
Cas has moved closer, leaning over Dean to work at a slightly harder to reach spot. One of his thighs is pressed against Dean’s in a warm line that sends arousal shooting through Dean. He shifts slightly against Cas, pressing closer, heart thumping. From the sharp intake of breath, he knows Cas can tell how worked up he’s getting, how affected he is by this.
Every day after his morning lectures, he spends from 2pm to 8pm talking to customers, taking orders, serving food. He knows all the regulars, could pick them out of a line up; the timid, bespectacled professor with hunched shoulders and a battered briefcase who sits at the window table every afternoon reading textbooks on phenomenology and religion; the three girls in blazers and ties who come in most days after school and order milkshakes with as many sugary toppings as possible; the mother and chubby-cheeked toddler who stop in every Thursday afternoon. Cas notices things about the one-time customers too; whether they look tense or distracted, if they look longingly at the cakes but then order a fruit salad, how they relate with whoever’s with them. He knows none of them, not really, but he feels like he does. And yet none of them look at him, really see him. They don’t notice what mood he’s in that day or what book he’s got stashed behind the counter to read whenever it’s quiet, they don’t notice if his smile is real or not. He’s just the person who serves their coffee.
He’s left so stupidly giddy by the entire encounter that he accidentally switches the cappuccino machine to “full” instead of “off” when he and Meg are closing up, which promptly results in both of them being drenched in hot foam.
“Dean,” Castiel bites down on the juncture between Dean’s neck and shoulder, sending shivers down Dean’s spine, “Dean,
There’s a little red tin in the glove compartment of the impala, and when Cas picks it up, he can feel the way it’s scratched and dented with age.
“Thanks,” Cas mumbles, unsteady. “Just as well,” he adds dryly, “Death by vegetable preparation wasn’t really the noble legacy I was going for.”
. Cas starts running, weaving his way through the few people out this early. He rounds the corner into the square, cherry blossom blowing like snowflakes through the breeze. For a moment, Cas thinks he’s gone in the wrong direction – but then he catches sight of Dean a few paces ahead, hair almost golden in the sunlight.
“I’d like to think so too,” Cas replies, handing Dean his drink. “Here. No tea leaves. You’re free to make your own future.”
Cas’s expression is unreadable, and he seems to gather himself, shut down a little before saying, “You only feel like that because you’re a vampire right now, Dean.”
“So – this wasn’t just a heat of the moment thing?” Cas asks shyly, looking down at their intertwined hands and watching the way Dean’s thumb strokes across his. A flash of heat runs through him as he remembers Dean doing the same thing while he was moaning helplessly, Cas’s mouth stretched around his cock.
“It’s halfway there, almost,” Cas glances up, maybe planning on reassuring Dean – but something unreadable passes over his expression as he takes in Dean’s face, the flush Dean can feel on his cheeks and how he knows his pupils must be blown wide.
Dean nods, biting his lip. The first pierce of the needle does sting, but it’s not as bad as he imagined, and it soon numbs into vague, prickly discomfort. The downside of this is that Dean isn’t as distracted from Cas’s proximity as he’d like. The sooty sweep of Cas’s lashes, his full lips slightly parted in concentration, his rumpled hair. He’s wearing his shirt unbuttoned and Dean can see a distressing amount of smooth, toned skin, the tangle of pendants round his neck, including the one Dean gave him for his last birthday. Cas had been quiet when he’d opened it, had hugged Dean so hard it hurt a little. It makes Dean’s chest ache just thinking about it now, about this fleeting moment where Cas had just looked at him like he wanted him too, like something was going to happen. But neither of them had made a move, and Dean has always wondered if he’d read too much into it.
They both gasp when Dean gets a hand around Castiel’s cock, already slick and hot with precum. He’s so hard he must be even closer than Dean, which sends a jolt of heat straight to Dean’s cock; the idea that Castiel is this turned on just from kissing him, touching him. Trying not to lose it just from the feel of Castiel’s cock in his hand, Dean starts jerking him, a little overwhelmed by how good it feels, how good Castiel feels, hard and heavy and so fucking perfect it’s ridiculous. Dean flicks his thumb over the head of Castiel’s cock and feels arousal pool low in his groin at the way Castiel breathes out shakily against his neck.
Three phases of the moon had passed before Dean stopped shouting Castiel’s name desperately into the unresponsive quiet.
“If you want it,” Cas says, and Dean thinks he detects a note of apprehension beneath the warmth, a kind of distraction, as though he’s thinking about something else, which is a sharp contrast to his often unnerving focus that’s usually directed Dean’s way.
. He pictured Dean stumbling around in the snarled branches and colourless fog, shouting blindly with nothing to kill, nothing to be angry at. It hurt Castiel so much it felt like physical pain, like Dean was punching him over and over again with his despair.
“Hard to describe to anyone who hasn’t tasted it,” Dean says, “Like most things. It’s – sweet. Kind of makes the inside of your mouth feel cold when you inhale.”
Pressing one last sloppy, open mouthed kiss to Dean’s neck, Cas drops to his knees, gazing up at Dean from the kitchen floor. A sharp jolt of arousal shoots through him at how affected Dean looks; his lips are red and swollen, cheeks flushed and chest heaving, his green eyes darker than Cas has ever known them.
Sometimes, Castiel wonders if he’ll ever hear Dean’s voice out loud again. If these one-way prayers will be the last communication between them. He tries to hold onto Dean’s dogged determination, the promises he makes without even being sure Castiel will hear. The Leviathan are closer than ever now, and Castiel doesn’t want Dean’s last memory of him to be silence. He longs to sit in the same room as Dean again, hear the things Dean has confessed in his prayers out loud, be able to watch what expressions play through the complex green of his eyes. Reach out, touch his skin, the warmth of it.
“Me neither,” Cas says, stroking his thumb across Dean’s palm, revelling in how wonderful it is to be able to touch Dean like this, to not have to hide how much he wants to.
“I like seeing you unfiltered,” Dean closes the book, slowly slides it back across the counter. “You’re hard to work out, you know.”
“I – uh -  tea,” Cas mumbles, desperately willing the heat burning on his cheeks to cool a little. “Usually.”
Since then, Cas has watched countless men and women have the same, awestruck reaction he’d had that first night. Dean has dated a couple of them, slept with a few more of them – but he hasn’t stuck with anyone. In fact, to date, Cas is the only person he knows of that Dean has spent more than a handful of weeks with. Over the last year, they’ve hung out most days. At first it was just going to freshman events together or meeting up after seminars for coffee, but it’s evolved into eating dinner together most nights and spending all of Sunday sprawled on the couch in Dean’s apartment. If they don’t wind up seeing each other for a couple days, Dean will typically turn up at Cas’s apartment with stupid cowboy movies and the raspberry and vanilla muffins Cas loves.
Regardless of what’s causing it, it’s starting to get under Dean’s skin. Cas turns up everywhere now with this sex hair and these bedroom eyes, like it’s totally acceptable to look like a steamy movie scene at a morgue or a diner or unannounced in Dean’s motel room in the middle of the night. Like he has now idea how wildly inappropriate or inconvenient it is, how fucking
It took everything Castiel had not to go to him. But the Leviathan were still close behind him, and he knew it was impossible.
“You’ve been distracting me,” Dean murmurs, senselessly, lost in Castiel’s gaze and the softness of Castiel’s rumpled hair beneath his fingertips, the warmth of his body so close, “Looking at me like this.”
“Here,” Cas carefully wraps the napkin around the takeaway cup and slides it towards Dean. His heart is pounding so hard he’s sure Dean must be able to hear it.
Dean tugs them gently from under Cas’s head and leans down to kiss him, soft and sweet and so full of promise it makes Cas’s heart ache. They kiss until they’re both breathless, the pink floral panties crumpled in Dean’s fist against Cas’s chest as they lose themselves in each other all over again.
“Dean –” Cas swallows, frozen in sheer humiliation. Dean is looking at him, all green-eyed sincerity and a little bit of apprehension, and all Cas finds he can say is: “Good luck.”
Dean looks reluctantly away from Cas and back to the shelves, eyeing them more closely. His hand pauses on an unfamiliar hardback, Bluebeard by Vonnegut. “This?”
Craving more, Cas leans forward and takes Dean full in his mouth, swallowing him down and moaning at how absurdly good the weight of him feels inside him. Above him, Cas is vaguely aware of Dean shouting out, hand clenching in Cas’s hair again. Cas’s ears are ringing with how turned on he is, how incredible Dean feels on his tongue, heavy, hard heat. Cas swallows him deeper, deeper, until his nose is pressed to Dean’s stomach and he can feel it rapidly fluctuate between concave and conflux as Dean gasps for breath.
The last two weeks have been a mess, and Dean knows that if he doesn’t watch himself, this week will be his last one in the competition. Determined not to be intimidated out of his rightful place in this competition by a man who wears a bumblebee apron, Dean sets his alarm extra early on Saturday morning to get in a couple hours practice in before everyone else shows up. His frustration is momentarily soothed by his walk across the sloping grass lawn; the spring sunshine is just pastel and soft, warm on his back, blossoms rustling softly in the breeze.
“Well, yeah,” Dean grins, a little sheepish, “I’d have thought that much was obvious. I don’t just go around hassling all the baristas around town, you know.”
“Castiel,” Cas says, a little captivated by the way the guy puts his cigarette between his lips for a moment as he fishes in his pocket for a lighter. “Everyone calls me Cas.”
Obligingly, Cas opens the box. It is empty, save a couple of crumpled silver wrappers, but it smells of ghostly peppermint. Cas sniffs, imagines little Dean and Sam sitting in the impala alone on Christmas day. His chest aches at the thought of Dean trying to distract Sam, keep him happy and amused while Dean was probably afraid. “I’ve never tried peppermint,” he tells Dean, inhaling again and trying to figure out the scent. It’s sharp, clean, a little powdery. Like dusty snow. “What’s it like?” he asks, curiously.
. Castiel had almost gone to him then. It was more than he could bear, the endless torment of Dean’s voice, slowly tearing itself to pieces in the quiet.
“Did you miss the bit where I drove the car off the road earlier today?” Dean demands, incredulously. His heart is pounding, because
“Tell me about the design again,” Cas says quietly, interrupting Dean’s internal panic. The cold wet nib of the pen tickles Dean’s skin, slow and careful. Dean watches his hands move expertly, long fingers with chipped black nail polish that Dean finds inexplicably sexy.
“I wanted to too,” Dean says, “In case that wasn’t already obvious,” he laughs, easy and warm and so
“You mean – you find me attractive?” Cas’s eyes are shining like he already knows the answer, is feeling the same giddy happiness that’s blooming in Dean’s chest.
Something passes across Cas’s gaze, eternal blue and blown pupils like supernovas, and desire entirely unrelated to bloodlust slams into Dean, leaving him breathless. He groans, strains desperately against his restraints, watching helplessly as Cas gets to his feet and approaches agonisingly slowly. Cas’s expression is torn, dazed, as though he’s still somewhere trying to make up his mind without accepting that his body already has. Closer like this, Dean can taste the clear, pure swirl of his grace, the hot rush of blood. The combination is intoxicating. Fleetingly, he can’t help thinking about how if he wasn’t tied up it would be so easy to just take one bite, one tiny nibble – but no. He wouldn’t. Dean swallows determinedly, doesn’t take his eyes from Cas.
“Once, I suppose so,” Dean sounds distracted, but his tone doesn’t match the intent focus in his gaze as he looks at Cas. The cold has made his cheeks flush darker still, and the light is muted enough that only an arc of green is visible around the black of his pupils.
But – suddenly, Dean becomes very aware of the delicious, hot pulse hammering under the skin in Cas’s neck. He can’t quite help breaking the kiss to suck on it, just gently. He’s not going to bite or anything, really. Cas lets out a low, beautiful groan and clutches Dean closer, rocking their hips together – and, god. Dean sucks harder, hands clenched into fists where he’s still cuffed. He can’t resist scraping his teeth lightly against the warm skin, groans roughly at the agonising temptation of the warm, wet blood underneath it. Cas lets out a low gasp, fists clenched in the front of Dean’s t-shirt, and – suddenly, okay, that’s about as much as Dean’s newfound bloodlust can take. He doesn’t mean to do it, he really doesn’t, but before Dean can stop himself, he finds his shiny new fangs sinking into the warm, smooth skin of Cas’s jugular. Immediately, hot, wet blood fills his senses and oh god, it’s bliss, it’s oblivion, it’s -
Dean lets out a sound that might be a breath of surprise or a groan, staring at Cas wide-eyed, heart pounding. Because this, this is all he’s wanted since he first laid eyes on Cas all those years ago and he can’t quite believe it. “Yes,” he murmurs, dazedly. “God, Cas – yes.”
Cas whips around to see Dean lolling against the counter just like yesterday. He has his leather jacket slung over his shoulder this evening, sleeves of his Henley rolled up. He looks effortlessly gorgeous in a way that makes Cas’s stomach flip over, unable to help the involuntary smile that spreads across his face, bad mood melting away. “Hello, Dean.”
“God, Cas,” Dean’s mouth is slack, his eyes even darker than before. “You’re the hottest thing I’ve ever seen,” he breathes, biting down on his lip and face contorting in beautiful pleasure as Cas leans forward and swirls his tongue around the head of Dean’s cock to catch the bead of precum that’s already welling up, addicted to the taste, the warm weight of Dean in his mouth. He draws off slowly, still gazing up at Dean, drinking in the sight of him like this, and Dean laughs shakily, carding his hand through Cas’s hair, “You have no idea how hard I’m trying not to come right now.”
. The reason Cas was looking at him with all that pent-up, heated longing was because he actually wants Dean. Cas wants Dean the way Dean has always wanted him. The realisation is dizzying.
Cas smiles, tightens his grip on Dean’s bicep and leans in again, this time with the needle. “First few moments will sting, but after that it’ll fade, I promise,” he says, eyes searching Dean’s. “Let me know if you want to stop.”
Cas is looking at him, intent as always, anguished blue. Like he’s the one trapped and not Dean. His heart is thumping, reverberating through the room, quickened, hopeful, almost. A beat Dean recognises all too well.
“Well, you clearly are brainy or they wouldn’t have offered you an interview,” Cas says, stubbornly, putting the cap on the takeaway cup.
Dean smiles too, the hesitancy melting away. “Okay,” he says, golden-green eyes shining with something that makes Cas’s stomach turn over, “See you tomorrow, Cas.”
Castiel can’t bear it anymore, can’t do anything except quietly step out of the shadows, and into the fragile moonlight of the clearing.
“Nah, I’m pretty straightforward,” Dean shrugs, “Everyone knows that. What you see is what you get with me.”
it makes Cas’s heart ache. He cups Dean’s face in his hands and kisses back until he’s dizzy with it, lost in it, until they’re both grinding against each other breathlessly. It’s so insanely good Cas feels a little like he’s dreaming, but the solid heat of Dean’s body against his is all too real to be fantasy. Cas kisses back with everything he has, giving himself over to everything he thought was impossible.
“Good,” Cas replies, because he’s spent most of today still on a high from yesterday. He can’t help returning Dean’s familiar grin, wonders fleetingly at how easy it is to be happy around him, how smiling comes as naturally as breathing. It’s almost disorientating. “What are you drinking?”
Cas reaches out and grabs the lapels of Dean’s leather jacket, pulls him in again. This time it’s harder, urgent, Dean’s breath coming in stifled gasps into Cas’s mouth as Cas presses him back against the impala, sinks into the heat of Dean’s mouth, the warm, hard line of Dean’s body, pliant under him. He can taste the desperation on Dean’s tongue along with the peppermint, and he chases it, deepening the kiss until Dean is groaning against him, clutching at Cas’s coat. Cas thinks he might be making noises too, but he can’t think about anything except
“Dean,” Cas takes a deep breath, “I’ve wanted to do this pretty much since we met,” he admits, and even after everything they’ve just done, it still makes his heart pound to confess it out loud, holding Dean’s gaze.
. Fleetingly, he wishes Sam had stayed to watch over him instead of leaving to track the vamp responsible for this whole mess. At least then Dean would only have had to worry about trying to suck his blood, not also trying to suck his dick. Cas – Cas is a different matter.
“You’re doing so good,” Cas murmurs, and god, he’s so close that Dean can feel the warmth of Cas’s breath against his skin along with the heat that blossoms through him at Cas’s praise. “So good, Dean,” he strokes his thumb along Dean’s skin where he’s holding his arm in place, sending sparks shooting through Dean.
“Dean,” Cas smiles, quiet but sincere, and stands back to let Dean in. Dean is hit, as he is not infrequently these days, by how good-looking Cas has become. He’s not built but he’s lean, strong-looking, with a kind of grace about the way he carries himself. Tonight, he’s wearing an indigo knitted sweater that he got in a thrift store with Dean last year, and it makes the blue of his gaze feel infinite as it sweeps over Dean, familiar and warm.
“I’m going to finish this,” Cas says, at last, voice even rougher than usual, sending a thrill of arousal through Dean, “And then I’m going to kiss you.”
“Thanks,” Dean grins back, looking almost bashful. “The repair place hasn’t been doing too well lately, and my nerdy brother thought that some qualifications might help things along, so I applied. On a whim, really. I never thought they’d offer me an interview.”
“Dean,” Cas calls breathlessly, running after him, “Dean – wait,” he gasps, finally close enough to reach out and grasp Dean’s shoulder.
“You never gave me any indication you did,” Dean shrugs, and Cas notes the careful carelessness of it, like he’s still unsure. “Until today, anyway.”
“I am into him,” Cas whispers, feeling his cheeks burn. “He’s – not like anyone I’ve ever met, Meg. It’s like he really sees me, you know?”
Cas closes his eyes in humiliation. His heart is pounding, partly from the proximity and partly from the anticipation of coming clean, which he knows is the only option. “It’s – my fault.”
“Cas, I never got to say – the things I wanted to, the things I should have said,” Dean can hear the way the words shake as he speaks, scared of them even now, even now they’re both dead. He swallows, tries to focus on Cas, because he matters so much more than fear. “I shouldn’t have made you wait, Cas, I made you wait so long, and I never said anything.”
“Merry Christmas,” Dean echoes, dazedly, and his voice sounds as rough as Cas’s. He shakes his head, smiling in disbelief. “I told you that you always know what I want before I do,” he pauses, “Though, amazing as all the others were, I think this present might just top the list.” Dean is vaguely aware that he’s grinning giddily, heart still pounding.
The unreadable look is back on Cas’s face with more intensity, combined with something Dean definitely recognises as nervousness now. Cas’s chest is rising and falling more rapidly, eyes wider than usual, cheeks slightly flushed as he holds Dean’s gaze, almost like he’s steeling himself for something. “Okay,” he says, seemingly more to himself than to Dean. Okay, close your eyes.”
“Yeah?” Cas is smiling widely now, completely unable to stop himself. He feels giddy with happiness, the sheer elation of not being alone in this quietly incredible thing between them. He leans into Dean a little, grateful for the solid warmth of Dean’s body, reminding Cas that this is somehow really happening, that it’s somehow even better than he ever imagined.
The first and last memories Dean has of Cas are the same: a strong, tight grip burning into Dean’s shoulder like sun.
, Cas. Fucking irresistible, okay? So fucking irresistible I can’t even think, just,” Dean groans, giving up on trying to conceal what he’s been trying to push down for goddamn years. His human insecurities have faded to irrelevance in the rush and heat of the desire burning through him, the venom slowly percolating his bloodstream. “Please, Cas,” he tugs at his cuffs again, feeling the muscles in his arms straining. He doesn’t even know what he’s pleading for, he just feels dizzy with want. Bloodlust and years of pent-up, unresolved, quiet longing.
Castiel feels as though he’s breaking apart and being mended all at once. He can just see the moon; a year since they arrived here. Dean is still praying to him, as though Castiel is as much a part of his life now as he was then, as though he couldn’t stop if he wanted to. A year of silence, and Dean is still making them both promises.
Like Dean said, as far as situations go, it’s not ideal. But, he thinks, meeting the quiet elation in Cas’s blue gaze, maybe that doesn’t matter.
Meg rolls her eyes, but there’s a hint of a smile on her face. “Yes, you idiot. But I swear to god, if you aren’t going on a date with him by this time tomorrow, I’m handing in my notice.”
Finally forced to pull back a little for air, Cas tugs Dean’s bottom lip gently between his teeth, and immediately, Dean sucks in a breath and the hand on Cas’s back fists into the material of his sweater that Cas is still wearing.
“Oh,” Cas says, because he hadn’t thought about that. He feels a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth, warmth and happiness welling up uncontrollably, so pure it’s almost painful.
“Cas – okay, look, buddy, I gotta tell you something,” Dean manages, at last, pinching the bridge of his nose and taking a deep breath.
“Guess I shouldn’t ask you to make me one then,” the guy’s tone is apologetic, humorous, and he holds up his hands in mock surrender. “I’d hate to prolong your suffering.” He pushes himself off the counter. “Anywhere else near here you’d recommend?”
Cas looks at him a beat longer, before dropping his attention to the present, unwrapping it carefully with his long, dextrous fingers. There’s a moment when he pulls the leather-bound album out of the shell of wrapping where Dean feels hot all over, embarrassed by his own sentiment. He digs his nails into his palm, watches as Cas opens it and goes still, reading Dean’s inscription. There’s a long pause, and then he turns the first page, and then the next and the next, looking at the photos of him and Dean that Dean has collected from over the years: the two of them togged up in winter coats and red welly boots, making snow-angels in Dean’s back garden; Cas aged ten with a tearstained face, watching as Dean puts a band-aid on his grazed knee; both of them on their first day of middle school, Cas moody with pins all over his jacket and scruffy converse sneakers, Dean grinning with his letterman; Cas, windswept and smiling two summers ago, lying on a sandy beach and gazing up at Dean with that a hint of that
“Cheers, Cas,” Dean’s voice is indistinct around a mouthful of raspberry muffin. “I can’t stay, but –” he swallows, suddenly looking almost serious, “Thanks for this. Seeing you this morning is – well, just what I needed.”
They look at each other for a moment that is all heat, and then Cas moves up the bed in an easy, fluid move, suddenly straddling Dean, pinning him with his thighs. He holds Dean’s gaze unflinchingly, reaches out and places his hands over Dean’s cuffs. And – yeah, that’s pretty much all Dean can take. Before he quite knows what he’s doing, he surges forward and captures Cas’s mouth in a searing, urgent kiss. Cas lets out a muffled sound that might be surprise, but then a lower sound deep in in his chest as melts into it, mouth hot and silken soft, hands coming up to cup Dean’s face with a kind of desperate tenderness that sets Dean’s heart racing even faster.
Dean grins too, a little awkwardly, like he realises he’s been caught staring. “My friend Pam would tell you to keep the leaves in,” he says, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. He gestures to the tea Cas is preparing. “She does readings and stuff, says she can tell the future from whatever’s left in the bottom of your cup.”
“I hope I’ll see you around, Cas,” the guy – Dean scoops up the takeaway cup and throws Cas a devastating smile. “Have a good night.”
“See you soon,” Cas echoes, fully aware he’s smiling stupidly and fully unable to stop. He’s still smiling even when Dean’s halfway across the square, the morning sunshine beating down on his dark suit and lighting up the soft golden tones in his hair.
Castiel can hardly believe his eyes; purgatory has a way of tricking the senses. But this is more real than anything that exists here. Dean. A year on, half-hidden in darkness, but unmistakable. Heaven or hell or purgatory, Castiel would know him anywhere.
“I guess it’ll have to be. Next time I’ll need to make sure I come in earlier.” When Cas re-emerges, he finds the guy’s eyes on him, warm and flirty and entirely too much for Cas to handle. He swallows, and busies himself with preparing the tea. “Although it can’t be much earlier,” the guy is fiddling with one of the sugar packets again, “I don’t finish work until six.”
that Cas can’t help smiling in response. “I just,” Dean adds, quieter, “I never thought you were interested.”
“Sorry – yes – I was just – yes, I’m fine,” Cas stammers, blushing furiously, because he can’t get the image of the pink floral swirls against the pale freckles of Dean’s skin out of his head. Dean’s looking at him right now, and all Cas can think about is the panties he suddenly knows Dean is wearing under his faded black jeans. Cas’s heart is racing, and, to his horror, he realises he’s definitely more than a little hard.
On Thursday afternoon, Dean finishes a haunting case with Sam with relative success (no unplanned stabbings of innocent bystanders, thanks to Cas’s absence). The sun is warm on the windscreen as they drive back to their motel, and Dean is just enjoying the relative peace of the open road when a flutter of wings announces Cas’s presence in the backseat of the impala. Dean startles and swerves, while Sam, the fucker, manages to not even spill the stupid organic kale smoothie he’s been drinking.
“It’s just – I didn’t – I didn’t mean to do that,” Cas mumbles, heart thudding. He’s trying to fit in the logic of this being reality. Of Dean really wanting him. It doesn’t seem like it should be real. It doesn’t fit. “I mean – I wanted to,” he adds, hastily, feeling Dean tense beside him, “I just – I didn’t ever expect it to happen, or anything.”
“Then say it,” Cas is looking at him, eyes earnest, so blue. Dean thinks he catches a glimmer of hope in them, so beautiful it makes his soul ache.
“Yes – sorry – I just,” Cas shakes himself out of his stupor and grabs the keys from under the counter. His hands are shaking slightly and his face still feels hot.
Dean grunts in awkward acknowledgement, because that sounds fucking amazing and if he knows Castiel at all, it’s going to look incredible. He rescues a wayward currant that’s strayed under his scales, dropping it into the tub with slightly more force than necessary.
He’s too far gone, the venom too deep in his veins to feel the kind of humiliation he might have done before. All the reasons he’s kept quiet over the years seem utterly meaningless. There’s only one, overpowering through in his undead little brain: get Cas to come closer. Not because he’s going to drink his blood, of course. Dean does still have some self-control. He just – needs Cas to be closer.
Time passes. And then – something about the intensity of the silence lessens, like he isn’t the only one breathing it anymore.
“Sure,” Dean reaches up to the top shelf of the kitchen cabinet with ease. As he does so, his black t-shirt rides up, exposing the small of his back – which, honestly, is enough to make Cas’s stomach somersault and his mouth go dry with want. But then Dean stretches a little further to reach the jar, and Cas suddenly catches a glimpse of pastel pink silk, delicate floral swirls against Dean’s freckled skin.
“Because I thought you weren’t interested either,” Cas mumbles, looking down at his hands, “I mean. You’ve never treated me the way you treat the people you sleep with. I always assumed that meant you only saw me as a friend.”
“Shut up,” Dean murmurs, voice low and lazy. Cas feels the rumble of his voice reverberate against him from where they’re pressed together. Dean tugs him a little closer, all soft warmth and hard muscle, “I can hear you overthinking from here, you big idiot.”
“I do. I’ve seen the two of you around each other,” Meg sighs, but there’s no malice to it. “Completely sickening. I never signed up for these working conditions.”
“Yes –” Dean spits out roughly, trying to drag his gaze from Cas because it’s only making him ache harder, the desire almost unbearable. Somewhere, hazily, he feels a vague sense of embarrassment at his desperation, the words tumbling from his mouth unbidden in a way he’s never allowed before, especially in front of Cas. “And your grace. How hard your heart is beating. Fuck, Cas,” Dean groans, twists in the restraints, “It’s so
“So perfect, Dean,” Castiel breathes, and Dean groans helplessly, feels a blurt of precum pulse down Castiel’s moving fingers, dizzying pleasure throbbing through him. “Oh,” Castiel sounds overwhelmed in a way that’s all kinds of wonderful, and Dean literally feels Castiel’s cock twitch where it’s pressed against Dean’s hip, which is just ridiculously hot. Pleasure builds heavy and fast in Dean’s cock, and he knows he’s not going to last long like this, with Castiel clearly as turned on as he is by this quietly terrifying, wonderful thing between them.
“What?” Cas blinks, pulling away slightly to look at Dean incredulously. Dean’s cheeks are still a little pink, his lips red and swollen. His eyes are complex green, glowing with something quiet and hopeful that makes Cas’s heart fumble a beat.
Dean wrenches away with a possessive, vampiric hiss to see Sam standing in the doorway, a small vial in his hands. His eyes swivel from Dean’s kiss-bruised lips, visible hard-on, and protruding fangs to the bloody wound on Cas’s neck. Dimly, through the haze of temporarily abated bloodlust, Dean feels a wave of humiliation.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean says, rubbing the back of his neck in the way Cas notices he does when he feels self-conscious, “I should’ve got you to write my application for me, you seem to have a much better opinion of me than I do.” He grins, slides a note across the counter and takes the cup from Cas’s hands. His touch definitely lingers unnecessarily on Cas’s this time, and Cas can feel the heat burning in his cheeks when Dean eventually pulls away. For the first time, he indulges himself, doesn’t try to quash the little glimmer of hope.
The unguarded vulnerability of it makes Cas’s chest ache almost unbearably, suddenly full of the hope he’s never let himself have. Wordlessly, he strokes his thumb across Dean’s hand in return. Dean’s cock is hitting the back of his throat, but somehow the way Dean’s fingers are tangled in his feels even more intimate. Dean seems similarly affected, because his expression as he gazes down at Cas is so full that it almost hurts Cas to look directly at it, like trying to gaze directly into the sun.
“I –” Cas swallows, heart suddenly thudding. He doesn’t know what to say. He could just lean in and kiss Dean, like he’s wanted to all week. It would be so easy. But what he blurts instead is – “You’ve got something on your face.”
But, worst of all, is the way Cas has started looking at Dean. Having Cas staring into the depths of his soul was always a bit of an overwhelming experience, but this is something else. Cas’s gazes have evolved into something that’s borderline seductive, all smitey and smouldering and deep blue. It’s the kind of intensity Dean has only come close to experiencing in the middle of fucking someone, and honestly, it’s a bit more than he can take. He’s not sure when Cas stopped looking intently serious and started looking like he wants to fuck Dean all the time. He assumes it’s some kind of misplaced angel interpretation of how humans interact, because, based on Cas’s past transgressions, that just seems like the most logical assumption.
They drive in increasingly heavy silence for the next several miles through suburbia, and then Dean gets distracted by a soft rustling sound from the backseat. He glances in his mirror again, and feels heat flood his cheeks as he realises that Cas has just taken off his trench coat
Dean makes a dismissive sound, carries on as though Cas hasn’t spoken at all, but the tension in his hands is less strained; “Anyway, when Dad finally came back that night he was only a little beat up, in a good mood for once. He tried to take us for some real food, but everywhere was closed by that time so we just sat in here together and Dad broke the last candy cane into three for us to share,” Dean glances at the box Cas is still holding. It feels warm in Cas’s hands now, the mental heating up in his palms as he listens to the story, as though it’s slowly coming alive. “It was one of the better Christmases, actually. Dad refilled the box with them each December, handed them out to me and Sammy when we’d been driving all night. It was one of the few traditions we ever had,” he shrugs, adjusts his grip self-consciously on the wheel, “Stupid, really,” he adds, in that way he has of diminishing anything personal he says, “It’s probably empty now.”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean smiles, a tinge of something almost like disappointment in it, like he was wanting Cas to say something else instead. He grabs his tea and nods at Cas. “See you on the other side,” he tosses one last smile in Cas’s direction, and then he’s gone. The door clinks shut behind him, punctuating the silence of the café.
“Why would they?” Dean laughs, “I was never brainy like Sam. Sure, I did okay in school and stuff but I was more focused on dating people and skipping class than getting grades. I’m better with my hands, that’s why I like working the repair business.”
“Cas, Cas, Cas,” Dean breathes out his name like a litany, hips rocking minutely as Cas hollows his cheeks and sucks harder, swirling his tongue around the head of Dean’s cock. He feels precum blurt out, hot and salty, making his own cock throb harder at how easily he realises he could come from this, just Dean in his mouth.
“I swear to god,” Meg grimaces, wiping froth off her eyebrow and glaring at Cas, “If you don’t ask him out soon, I’m quitting.”
Castiel had found that the hardest to bear of all. Half beside himself, he’d almost gone to Dean that night, to prove that Dean could have faith in something. But he didn’t, because if Dean was killed, there’d be no point in believing in anything.
“Thanks,” Cas is standing by the door, arms folded across his chest as he watches Dean inspect his bookshelf, run his fingertip along the spines. “There’s a new one there for you, if you want it.” His expression is uncharacteristically unreadable. Not that Cas is easy to read – not by any stretch of the imagination. But Dean’s spent a long time mapping out his different expressions and mannerisms, and it’s not often these days that he’s faced with one he can’t place at all. This one is not unfamiliar, though. It’s one he’s noticed playing across Cas’s features increasingly often in recent months, generally when he glances up and catches Cas off guard. It’s an expression that niggles away at the back of Dean’s mind when he’s trying to get to sleep at night, gets under his skin.
“Christ, I’m not some blushing virgin, Cas,” Dean rolls his eyes, mainly to cover up the way his heart is suddenly fluttering in his chest. “Just get on with it, okay?”
Dean turns, surprise melting into something glowy and quietly hopeful when he sees Cas. “Hey, Cas. Can’t get enough of me?” he quips, but the teasing tone isn’t light enough to be entirely convincing. He’s close enough that Cas could count the freckles scattered across the bridge of his nose, pale golden in early morning light. Cas is suddenly aware that he’s never been this close to Dean, close enough to count the flecks of gold in his eyes.
“Uh –” Cas hastily folds the napkin in two so that Dean won’t see it before he leaves. Cas doesn’t think he could bear the embarrassment of watching Dean open it up in front of him. “There are orange spice ones, and raspberry and white chocolate.”
“Because – I don’t know. They think they’ve got me all worked out just because of the way I look and the way I talk. Or they think there’s not much going on behind the pretty face,” Dean grins, but it doesn’t reach his eyes and it hurts to look at, how good an imitation of carelessness it is.
“Just – don’t,” Cas is the one to close his eyes now, fists clenched at his sides. He looks agonised, as tortured as Dean feels. “Don’t trust me to say no to you.”
“Yeah, right,” Meg snorts, grabbing the keys and propelling Cas towards the door, “If he’s not in here again tomorrow drooling all over you I’ll eat the fucking cappuccino machine.”
For the first time since being here, he feels all the fear melt out of him as he looks at the lone figure standing in the clearing.
Cas is too slow this time to avert his eyes before Dean turns around. He glances up to find Dean looking right at him, something heavy and unreadable in his expression. His gaze drops to where Cas’s had been a moment before, where there’s still a sliver of pink visible on the v of his hip. Instead of looking embarrassed, he just grins, raises his eyebrows suggestively, “Like something you see?” he asks, teasingly. The unreadable
The thought of not being around Cas every day makes his whole chest ache, so Dean tries not to do it. But sometimes it just creeps up on him and it’s like having a bucket of ice water poured over him, a constant knife in his chest that twists deeper and deeper as it gets closer to the time he knows they’ll have to say goodbye. It’s not just about parting ways – Dean knows there’s no way he and Cas won’t stay best friends. But it's like there's also something that Dean's always been waiting for that might not get to happen, that graduating and leaving for college might get in the way of, and even though Dean has no idea what it is he’s waiting for, the idea that it might get pushed aside, might never happen, is somehow unbearable.
“Oh,” Cas blinks, and something a little like hope flickers through his blue gaze, bright and beautiful. “That was about me?”
“God – yes,” Dean breathes, cock twitching in his pants. Castiel’s hands are deft and quick, undoing his pants and sliding into his boxers, and Dean lets out an involuntary groan at the feeling of Castiel’s fingers wrapping around his hard cock. Already dangerously close, he arches into it, burying his face in Cas’s shoulder. “Holy shit, Cas,” he groans, as Castiel pumps him slow and steady and so fucking good, making little noises against Dean’s neck like he’s as turned on as Dean is just by touching his cock.
when the chime of the door makes his heart sink. But whatever irritation Cas is feeling fades the moment he looks up, eyes settling on the person who’s just walked through the door.
Cas finally looks up at him, eyes so blue it hurts to look at them. “Thank you, Dean,” his voice is slightly hoarse. “This –” he breaks off, swallows, turning the album over in his hands. “This must have taken you ages.”
“Do you believe her?” Cas asks, removing the tea strainer. The colour of the tea is a subtle golden green, and Cas is suddenly struck by how similar it is to Dean’s eyes.
Relief is overwhelming, but bittersweet. Dean looks wrecked. His green eyes are stark and staring, a year of being on constant alert, and the sharp lines of his faces are hollow and shadowed. Castiel watches him check the surroundings methodically before sinking down at the bottom of a particularly gnarled tree, putting his head in his hands. Even from the shadows, Cas can sense his exhaustion. He wonders when Dean last slept, if he sleeps.
“It’s just – I’ve never asked someone out, Meg. I don’t know how. I’m too awkward, I’ll just stutter and mess it up and he’ll never want to date someone like me,” Cas looks down, twisting his hands in the pockets of his apron awkwardly.
Dean nods dazedly, before he remembers Cas can’t see him. “Yes – yeah,” he mumbles stupidly, dizzied by the strong grip Cas has around his arm, the tenderness in his touch and the care with which he tattoos Dean. “Yeah.”
Cas leans forward and presses his mouth to the tented pink satin, feels arousal jolt through him at the
“Then where is it?” Dean asks, glancing around the room – but there’s no sight of a gift. Just the soft glow of the fairy lights and Cas’s notebooks on his desk, a couple of jumpers hanging over the back of his chair, the little cactus Dean gave him for his birthday two years ago sitting stoutly on his bedside table.
Castiel learnt about how the dark of purgatory reminded Dean of looking after Sam when they were kids, the times they ran out of electricity and had to wait in the dark for days until their Dad got home; how time had blurred into meaninglessness just as it did here. Dean told Castiel about how afraid he’d been when he’d crawled out of hell, how he he’d stared at Castiel’s handprint every night in the mirror until it became part of him. One night, fiercely, he said,
Dean nods awkwardly, and busies himself with getting his ingredients out. He can feel Castiel’s gaze burning into his back, and it makes him self-conscious all over again. It makes him clumsy, too; he accidentally upends a tub of currants and swears colourfully, scooping them up as quickly as he can manage. Dean’s pretty sure that if Castiel hadn’t spent so much time looking at him, he wouldn’t have burnt the angel cakes in last week’s challenge. It’s really fucking distracting. Sure, Dean’s used to being looked at. But Castiel doesn’t look at him the way other people do; Castiel looks like he sees, like he wants to see, and Dean can’t get it out of his head. He tries to ignore the way it makes his heart thump.
Cas feels himself flush even brighter red, heart racing uncomfortably. He’s not used to beautiful men smiling at him like they want to know him.
“You left,” Cas says, dishevelled hair illuminated in all its glory by the setting sun. His brow is furrowed in worried confusion, and he looks so gorgeous in the soft golden light that it’s hard to look at him. “Are you alright?”
There are people milling all around Cas in the sun-soaked square, the air muddled with cherry blossom and violin music from someone busking in the distance – but when Dean turns at the other edge of it and waves, he seems to spot Cas as easily as if he’s the only one there. The sun is no match for the warmth that blooms in Cas’s chest as he waves back. He’s never felt less invisible in his life.
. It darkens as Dean holds it, so powerful and blatantly seductive that Dean feels his cock throb involuntarily between his legs. He swallows, forcing himself to look back at the road. His hands are gripping tighter than strictly necessary on the wheel of the impala, and Sam throws him a slightly distressed look before taking a pointed sip of his stupid organic smoothie.
“It’s fine,” Castiel is smiling, like it really is. He’s suddenly looking at Dean in a way that makes Dean’s heart suddenly feel like it wants to escape the confines of his chest.
“High praise,” Cas raises his eyebrows, unable to keep the smile off his face. “I should put that in the description on the menu board.”
The next few moments are a blur; Sam yelling, “Dean, stop!”, the impala making an ominous crunching sound as it hits an ornamental rock garden, and promptly collides with a fence.
By the end of his shift the following day, Cas is in a foul mood. He has today’s soup special (butternut squash with rosemary) spilled all down his shirt after a collision with an excitable toddler, a burn on his hand from the temperamental cappuccino machine, and aching feet from standing all day. But, more than anything, he can’t quell the heavy weight of disappointment that Dean didn’t show up. Cas knew he shouldn’t have let Meg talk him into being hopeful, knew that Dean wouldn’t turn up again after the stuttering bumbling mess Cas had been yesterday. But, still, deep down, there’d been this tiny part of Cas that somehow thought he would. He doesn’t know why; it’s not like this is Dean’s usual place. He was probably just making conversation yesterday, the way he would with anyone.
Dean takes another deep breath, ignores the way his heart is racing. “I know you’re an angel and so you probably don’t get this at all, but the way you’ve been looking at me recently, all – all smitey and intense – it’s sort of what people do when they want to fuck the other person, Cas. And I know that’s not your intention, that’s not what you’re actually trying to convey,” Dean swallows, ignoring the heaviness in his heart, “But I just wanted just wanted to let you know that’s how humans would probably interpret it. So, maybe, you know, tone it down a little. It’s – uh – kind of distracting.”
The blue around Dean’s mouth has gone, his lips red and swollen in a way that sends a thrill through Cas at the thought that he did that. “I guess I do,” Dean is grinning, brighter than Cas has ever seen. “Give me your hand,” he says, and when Cas holds it out, he pulls out a pen from his pocket and scrawls a series of digits on Cas’s hand, the nib tickling lightly. “There. Now you have mine. If you call me later, I promise to take you out somewhere you don’t have to make the drinks.”
For a moment, Dean forgets he currently has a set of fangs and isn’t technically alive, and is just filled to the brim with pure, sunshine-warm happiness.
“It’s normal to be nervous, you know,” Cas tells him, “You don’t need to do this if you don’t want to,” his eyes are suddenly serious, regarding Dean closely, soft blue and familiar in a way that tugs at Dean’s heart. “And if you want to stop at any point, I’ll stop.”
He grabs the front of Castiel’s apron, crushing them together and groaning at how hard he can feel Castiel is against him. Castiel lets out a stifled sound at the contact, hips arching against Dean’s as he kisses him harder, deeper. They clutch at each other, mouths working, rocking against each other breathlessly, until it’s too much and not enough all at once. Dizzy with arousal, Dean’s hands find their way under Castiel’s shirt onto planes of warm, muscled skin, and Castiel sucks in a sharp breath of air at the pressure of Dean’s fingers.
Cas leans in, head bowed in concentration, fingers skilled and precise as he inks the outline of the sigil on Dean’s skin. This close, Dean can smell the distinct muskiness of Cas’s skin, the way the patchouli incense he always burns clings to his tousled hair. Dean has to force himself to concentrate on the image taking form under Cas’s touch, resisting the urge to lean in closer than he should and do something monumentally stupid like brush Cas’s hair away from his face or kiss him.
He’d never have imagined Dean wearing something like this, but seeing it, it also somehow makes sense. The unexpected is a big part of Dean’s draw; how elements usually in opposition seem to coexist harmoniously in him. Gruff masculinity and quiet vulnerability; sharp cheekbones and soft eyes; crude language and emotional sensitivity. And now this. His body is all strong muscle and angular lines, and the delicate pink floral is the perfect contrast, pastel and wispy.
“Okay,” the guy is grinning, careless and easy, stupidly attractive. He leans against the counter again, a little closer. Cas notices he has freckles scattered across the bridge of his nose, faint golden on his soft skin. It’s strangely endearing, softening the tough exterior. “Breathe. I don’t scare that easy,” he pulls his wallet out of the pocket of his leather jacket. “What do you drink if you don’t drink coffee?”
Cas stares at it for several moments, heart pounding, before he tears off his bumblebee apron and stumbles out into the bright early morning sunshine after Dean, ignoring Meg’s indignant shout from the kitchen. Panic rises in his chest when he doesn’t immediately spot Dean’s familiar figure, because he can’t let Dean go to his interview with Cas’s fucking phone number smudged across his face, he can’t be the reason Dean doesn’t get a place on the course he wants to do and thinks he’s not good enough for, he just
drool. “I didn’t realise I already knew it,” he grits out, watching Cas through hooded eyes, aware that he’s saying too much, but too far gone now to care, “It’s just a stronger version of how you smell normally.”
“I get that,” Dean looks more serious than Cas has ever seen him. “That kind of stuff, it can be –” he pauses, carefully, “Kind of a big weight to carry.”
Before Cas can process the enormity of that sentiment, Dean is kissing him. Hot and soft and with a kind of recklessness that is so
It’s a guy not much younger than him, so strikingly beautiful it kind of punches the breath out of Cas’s lungs. The guy looks like he’s just walked off the pages of a magazine spread – only he’s a little too rough around the edges, like maybe he had to fend for himself more than he should growing up. He’s wearing a beat-up old leather jacket and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and there’s a cigarette tucked carelessly behind one ear. He catches Cas’s eye and grins easily, all dirty charm. It’s the smile of someone used to the impact he has on people, but it still makes Cas’s stomach somersault involuntarily.
In the clearing, Dean tilts his head back, gazes up at the sky. He stares into the unblinking ghostly stars for a long time, before his eyes flicker shut.
Deftly, Cas undoes the belt and tugs Dean’s jeans down his thighs. He can’t help letting out a helpless moan at the sight in front of him; Dean’s cock hard and straining beneath the pink satin, far too big for the delicate cut of the panties. Cas can see the swollen red tip of it poking out of the elastic, a pearly bead of precum welling up already. He feels his own cock throb in response, pleasure building dangerously fast in his groin.
Not the iridescent, awed quiet of heaven. Not even the quiet of earth that is never really quiet, but which Castiel has learned to love. Soft, stolen moments of golden summer sun slanting through the windshield of the impala; exhausted, unspoken conversations at 2am in harshly lit roadside diners; the repetitive hush of Sam and Dean’s breathing in dark motel rooms. Purgatory is quiet like a crypt. Rigid, dark, endless. It’s quiet in the same way a dead body is completely still. There is that same sense of wrongness to the silence that swathes everything here. Castiel has never felt more aware of his own heartbeat, how much it aches.
The next thing that happens is the sharp blade of the knife piercing Cas’s thumb instead of the onion he’d been chopping. Cas sucks in a breath of pain and the knife clatters to the floor, the noise making Dean whirl around.
At first, it had been unbearable. Dean, wandering the endless space, shouting himself hoarse on Castiel’s name. His prayers had been abrupt, frequent, often aborted midway through. Full of the kind of rage that was a split second away from tears, his voice breaking on the single syllable of
Dean’s heart fumbles a beat in his chest, his world implodes quietly, infinitely. Cas’s mouth is hot and wet and perfect. Dean tangles his hands in Cas’s tousled hair like he’s always wanted to, tugs him closer, all warmth and racing hearts. Cas lets out a low groan against Dean’s mouth and then suddenly Dean is on his back on the bedspread, breathing heavily. It’s the same one they’ve sat on together night after night, all those times Dean wondered if this would ever happen. It should feel surreal, but it doesn’t. It just feels startlingly real, like this was always inevitable.
When they break apart for breath, Cas’s cheeks are flushed and his eyes are dark and shining. He’s so beautiful Dean aches with it.
Dean eyes him curiously. One of his favourite things about Cas lending him books all the time is getting to read Cas’s private thoughts filling the margins. “Is this my Christmas present? Not like you to forgo the fancy paper and the chance to upstage my gift-wrapping skills.”
“Will you have one too?” Cas asks, peering into the bag and tentatively drawing out one of the striped candies before handing it back to Dean.
As far as situations go, it’s not ideal. For starters, Dean is – temporarily – a vampire. Which is a fairly stressful state of being, actually. His gums are still tender from where his brand-new fangs have made an appearance, and everything is so fucking
“Well, one thing’s for sure,” Dean murmurs, and Cas can feel the curve of Dean’s smile against his lips, “These panties? Best $30 dollars I ever spent.”
of Dean beneath the material, how hard he is. Beneath him, Dean lets out a stifled sound, and the hand in Cas’s hair tightens. He’s rocking his hips in tiny, unconscious movements, and there’s already a damp patch of precum on the front of the panties. Cas laps at it, hears Dean’s intake of breath as he tastes him for the first time, salty and sharp through the satiny material. Cas can’t help groaning at it, fingers digging into Dean’s hipbones as he nuzzles closer into Dean’s crotch, mouthing all around the hot, hard shape of Dean’s cock and feeling Dean grow impossibly harder under his lips.
“It used to have peppermints in it,” Dean says, looking back to the road. There’s a wistful kind of sadness in his gaze, but a slight smile playing across his mouth. “Sammy begged Dad to buy it at some gas station when he was, I don’t know, maybe four. He didn’t even like peppermints, he just liked the Christmas tree on the front of the tin, wouldn’t shut up about it. It was filled with those red and white striped candy canes, you know the ones?”
Dean laughs, head thrown back, and Cas tries desperately to ignore the warm feeling in his stomach. “Oh yeah?” Dean grins, going back to his ministrations, “What noble legacy were you going for?” he asks, gently smoothing the band-aid against Cas’s skin. His fingertips are quick and skilled, warm and a little rough. Cas watches them and imagines them pulling on the pink lace panties, running under the frilled elastic and then letting snap it against soft skin as they move away. Involuntarily, Cas feels his cock twitch in his jeans.
Cas presses a kiss to the base of Dean’s cock through the panties, and then catches the delicate elastic in his teeth and drags them down, releasing Dean’s cock. It’s full and heavy and slaps wetly against Dean’s stomach, a little rivulet of precum dribbling down the shaft. Cas leans forward to catch it with his tongue and Dean cries out, hand tightening in Cas’s hair again. Cas looks up at him, the taste of Dean heady on his tongue. His heart is pounding, and he’s not sure he’s ever been this turned on in his life.
He stares at the door for several moments after Dean has closed it behind him, until Meg creeps up behind him and pokes him in the back, making him jump. “Not in a rush to close up today, Castiel?” she sing-songs in that way she always does when she’s teasing him.
“Please, Cas,” Dean breathes, desperate. He can’t think about anything except how much he wants Cas closer. Although he can feel the venom burning beneath his skin, making him crave the heat of Cas’s blood, Dean also just longs for
He wishes Cas had left a mark on him the last time he touched him, not just blood on fabric, but something on his skin, etched onto him. A piece of him left that Dean could cling to. Dean remembers staring uncomprehendingly at the bloodied handprint on his jacket; remembers feeling no wonder, just fear.
Dean picks up one of the raspberry ones and takes a bite, letting out a soft sound of pleasure that makes heat rise in Cas’s cheeks. He hurriedly busies himself with finishing making Dean’s tea, hands trembling with the rush of having written out his number.
Something unreadable crosses Dean’s expression, and he swallows. “Thanks, Cas,” he says quietly, and he smiles in a way that’s hesitant, almost a little shy. It makes Cas’s chest ache with a sudden warmth, his heart pound. Dean is looking at him with a kind of intent weight that isn’t helping either of those things, green eyes warm and flecked with gold.
Dean thinks, as they kiss under the ancient constellations, it doesn’t need a mark anymore. Not now, not after all these years. They both know the truth.
Cas makes sure he has a clean bumblebee apron on the next morning, and has only just finished putting the baked goods in the display when Dean appears out of the early spring sunshine. Cas is wildly unprepared for Dean having swapped his usual leather jacket for a well-fitting dark suit; it makes him look so ridiculously attractive that Cas nearly drops the tray of poppy seed bagels he’s holding.
Cas’s expression flickers. “Dean – you wouldn’t be saying the things you’re saying if you weren’t in the early stages of transformation.”
As though in a trance, Cas sits down slowly on the edge of the bed, the mattress dipping beneath his weight. Tentatively, reaches out, places a hand on Dean’s thigh, his palm warm and solid and sending a jolt of lust through Dean.
But, even less ideal than the fact Dean is currently a member of the undead, is the fact he is alone, in his bedroom, with Cas. Which, if Dean is being totally honest with himself, is the kind of situation that would stress him out even if he weren’t currently experiencing the whole uncontrollable bloodlust thing. Because – not that he’d would admit this to anyone, especially Sam and his stupid, smug face – he actually already has enough urges when it comes to Cas without also wanting to, y’know, drain him of blood. Which is, incidentally, pretty much all he can think about right now.
“Thanks,” Dean says, gathering himself, but his voice sounds unsteady to his own ears, like he suddenly feels. Off-kilter, dizzy, like they’re both spinning into orbit. “Okay, okay, open the goddamn present already,” Dean mumbles, awkward, because he doesn’t know what he’ll do if Cas keeps looking at him like that, and he’s afraid of how much he wants to find out.
Everything crumbles. He would know that voice, that touch anywhere. He turns, and the blue of Cas’s eyes makes the colours of heaven irrelevant.
Dean glances over, and something unreadable passes across his face. It reminds Cas of how he looks when Sam talks about their childhood, nostalgic and complicated – not happiness, but something close. “Where’d you find that?”
“And how is that?” Cas asks, eyes darkened. He’s leaning forwards, too close even though he’s still all the way across the room. Dean can
“Oh,” is the first thing Cas says, when they pull apart for air. There’s white blossom swirling through the bright air and Dean’s hands are still cradling his face, like he’s reluctant to let go. The thought makes the full feeling in Cas’s heart swell, quiet warmth spreading through him. Forgetting to be shy, forgetting everything that isn’t Dean, Cas fists his hands in the front of Dean’s shirt and pulls him back in until their mouths meet again, all heat and tenderness.
Cas is looking at him, blue eyes full of a warmth and concern that’s almost harder to bear than the seductiveness. He’s looking at Dean as though nothing else matters.
Abruptly, Cas, sits back on his haunches, breathing hard. “I can’t concentrate like this,” his eyes are darker than Dean’s ever seen them, a flush just visible creeping up the exposed skin of his chest. He lets go and sets his materials on the bedside table without moving away from Dean, without letting go. Slowly, not breaking eye contact, Cas leans back in until they’re even closer than before, both breathing unsteadily. Then, with the same tender carefulness with which he’d just been tattooing Dean, Cas leans in and kisses him.
It’s so cold here. Tonight, Castiel can see the moon; he’s been watching it for almost a year now. Twelve phases of the unblinking lunar eye. Castiel stands at the edge of a crepuscular clearing, staring upwards in reverent silence. He’s hidden by the jagged shadows of tangled branches, but, for once, they do not seem endless. For a moment, he loses himself in the hope of the moon, the hope that things beyond this somehow still exist, can exist again.
“Cas,” Dean groans, pinching the bridge of his nose after hastily righting the car. “Someday, I’m gonna swerve into something when you do that.”
“I haven’t decided yet,” he admits, a little breathlessly, because they spend all their time in each other’s space, but he’s not used to Dean touching him like this, with quiet intent. Almost like he could want this the way Cas does. He’s not used knowing that Dean is wearing pink floral panties under his jeans.
“Your blood is telling me things, Cas,” Dean groans, overcome by the heat of it, so close. When he opens his eyes again, Cas is staring at him with barely disguised want that does absolutely nothing to abate his own. He feels his stomach somersault, and god he’s so screwed. He’s always been screwed when it comes to Cas, but nothing could have foreseen this (this: being bitten by a vamp masquerading as a kindergarten teacher, consequently being handcuffed to a bed, and left alone with the person he’s spent the last five years pining over standing vigil).
“Blue?” Dean frowns in confusion, catching sight of the ink staining Cas’s fingers. His voice is lower and softer than usual, despite the uncertainty.
After a week of agonising over options, it’s finally Christmas Eve and Dean is standing on Cas’s doorstep, breath clouding out in front of him in the frosty air. There’s small parcel in the pocket of his leather jacket that he fiddles with nervously as he waits, feeling the bumps of his own bad gift-wrapping skills. His stomach flips over inexplicably when the hall lights flicker on there’s the sound of keys in the lock.
“Why not?” Dean’s fingers are warm against Cas’s for a moment, rough with calluses, and then there’s nothing again. He pulls out a candy and stuffs the paper bag into his pocket, begins unwrapping the little umbrella-shaped stick. “I can’t remember the last time I had one of these, you know. Probably the Christmas before Sam went off to college.” He puts the candy between his lips, sucks. Cas suddenly has to catch his breath, cold and startling in his lungs. “Hey, what are you waiting for?” Dean is looking at Cas, lips red and plump around the candy, eyes bright in the cold air.
“Uh,” Dean grunts, because Cas’s praise has turned him from low level horny to uncomfortably hard in his jeans. He shifts slightly on the bed, breathing hard. His arm is aching dully, but all he can think about is Cas’s hands on him, Cas warm and familiar and so goddamn close Dean feels dizzy with the proximity. He watches dazedly as black ink slowly appears on his skin under Cas’s careful hands.
“What’s your favourite coffee?” the guy asks, idly picking up a packet of sugar from the little bowl by register and turning it over in his fingers. Cas notices they’re bitten down to the quick just like his, and fleetingly re-evaluates the cool carelessness as carefulness instead, involuntarily fascinated. It’s not often he comes across someone he can’t work out.
“I didn’t want to interrupt,” Meg shrugs, tugging on her black velvet jacket, “I mean, when was the last time you got laid?”
They’d met at freshers’, at some house party thrown by someone Dean doesn’t remember. Dean had known he was a goner the moment he glanced up and found Cas’s blue gaze on him, quiet and intent, head tilted slightly, watching Dean like he was fascinated, like he could somehow really
“Hey, you’re clocked off now, right? I’m not going to get you making something you’re sick of the sight of,” the guy says, “Plus, maybe it’s time for me to try something new,” he grins wider, raising his eyebrows suggestively, and Cas feels the blush rise on his cheeks again.
“Maybe I’ll pop in tomorrow morning before the interview,” Dean suggests, and he suddenly sounds a little hesitant, like’s there’s a world in which Cas wouldn’t want to see him. “Have you wish me luck.”
Dean still kept praying, prayers that made things bloom Castiel’s chest he didn’t think could exist in purgatory.
“Sam isn’t the only person I can have good memories with, Cas. This can be a new tradition, okay?” Dean says, and he’s glowing, so beautiful here in the cold all lit up. “But,” he pauses, swallowing, “You’re right, I’m not sure I want mine.”
Wordlessly, Cas nods, turning on the cold tap and wincing slightly as he sticks his bleeding thumb under the stream of water. He leans against the sink, watching Dean kneel down and rifle impatiently through the contents of the cupboard. He still feels dazed, wondering if he imagined the tiny glimpse of pink lace. His heart thuds faster again just at the thought of it, soft and feminine against Dean’s pale freckled skin.
Thankfully, Cas is sitting at a safe (tantalising) distance on a chair by the door. Less thankfully, he’s wearing uncharacteristically little. After helping Sam wrestle Dean into submission (read: handcuffing him to the bedframe), Cas had shed his trench coat and suit jacket, and he hasn’t put them back on. Instead, he’s sitting with his shirt sleeves rolled up, hair rumpled, blue gaze heavy and watchful. Which is just. Not helpful in any capacity.
Castiel can’t do anything but stare, frozen in wonderment and disbelief. Dean rubs his hands over his face, hands Castiel has seen a thousand times gripping a dagger or a steering wheel or tending Sam’s wounds. Warmth that Castiel didn’t know was possible here blossoms through him. He feels close to tears, as though his heart is on the brink of bursting. He feels alive in a way he hasn’t for almost a year. Maybe longer.
“If you’re still serving,” he adds, a flicker of uncertainty passing across his cocksure smile, like he’s still not sure if Cas wants him there. Like maybe isn’t as confident and careless as he’d like to appear. Cas finds himself wondering what made the guy feel like he has to seem like he doesn’t care, why he seems to be quietly at war with the part of himself that does.
“I’ll hold you to that,” Dean’s eyes are warm, his fingers soft and fleeting against Cas’s as he takes the tea. “See you tomorrow, Cas.”
“Well, have a drink while you think about it,” Dean’s thumb strokes softly over Cas’s palm for a split second that Cas doesn’t have a chance to process before Dean’s moving away again. “Plus, it’ll help with the pain,” Dean adds, grabbing a bottle of rum from beside the microwave. He reaches up to get a couple of glasses from the cabinet, and his shirt rides up again. Cas has to suck in a breath as he sees the delicate pink lace against Dean’s skin again, undeniably real. Intricate roses in pink lace.
Up until now, Dean has managed pretty damn well at completely ignoring any less than platonic feelings he has for Cas. But trying to maintain that kind of front while Cas has been eyeing him seductively him at every possible opportunity has – been taking its toll, to say in the least. Last week, Dean accidentally stabbed a tree instead of the irate werewolf he was hunting, all because Cas showed up in a dramatic flash of light, all rumpled hair and protective glare. Later that same day, Dean had been forced to abandon his pie in the diner because, honestly, having Cas eye-fucking him across the table with Sam right there was all just a bit much. Two nights ago, Dean, flustered from hours of Cas staring at him like he wanted to jump him, attempted to take a drink from a lamp on his bedside table instead of the bottle of beer.
Time was meaningless in purgatory; it was never fully light, and dark was unpredictable, often for what felt like days. The only way Castiel had learnt to mark the passing of time was by looking up at the sky. It was choked in murky black, but he could just make out the lunar eye of the moon, miniscule ancient constellations glimmering in hope, or mockery. They were so very small, from all the way down here, but Castiel could still see them, and he held onto that. Like Dean’s prayers, sometimes he was comforted by them, other times tormented.
“For the love of –” Sam closes his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. He takes a deep breath before opening them again. “If I’d known all you needed to finally act on your raging angel crush was a brief spell as one of the undead, I’d have had you turned years ago. Jesus Christ.” He looks pale and vaguely nauseated, and Dean is suddenly uncomfortably aware of the fact that Cas is still straddling him.
“Student? I thought you looked the brainy type,” the guy clearly catches a glimpse of the expression on Cas’s face, “I don’t mean that in a bad way,” he adds, hastily, “No way. Honestly I’d give anything to be smart like that. My brother is super brainy, but not me.”
“Dean,” Cas breaths hotly against Dean’s neck, fingers trailing down the line of Dean’s hip to rest on his belt buckle, voice low and rumbling, “Can – can I?”
“Cas,” Dean murmurs, his hips still moving in small, half-aborted movements and the salty taste of precum stronger than ever on Cas’s tongue, “God, Cas. You have no idea how much I want you.” His thumb, Cas can feel it trembling, strokes over Cas’s palm even as Cas swallows him deeper again.
“I thought I could trust you with sharp implements,” Dean reaches out and carefully takes Cas’s hand, examining it with characteristic practicality and that little hint of protectiveness that always makes Cas’s heart race. “Does it hurt?” he glances up, deep concerned green.
“You are my friend, of course,” Dean reaches out, takes Cas’s hands in his, making Cas look up at him again, “But it’s not just that. Don’t you think maybe the fact I was different with you shows you actually mean more than just some random hook up? That I wanted more than that with you?”
“But seriously,” Cas presses, twisting his hands in his pockets, “Dean. I think you’re a lot more than all that stuff you just said, and I think anyone who doesn’t notice that or care about finding it out isn’t worth your time.”
Dean’s cock twitch against his where they’re pressed against each other through their jeans. It’s so absurdly hot he can’t help groaning, Dean just clutching him closer in response and rocking his hips against Cas’s until they’re both panting breathlessly, kissing impossible. Cas mouths his way down Dean’s neck, moaning against the soft skin there as Dean continues to grind against him.
“Yes, you dumbass,” Meg rolls her eyes, taking off her apron. “He was smitten. And,” she smirks, flicks Cas on the nose, “Judging by how much you’re still blushing, so are you.”
Dean closes his eyes. Cas’s gaze and the fairy lights all fade into to soft shadow. Vision gone, Dean suddenly feels very aware of the proximity between them, the almost imperceptible warmth of Cas beside him, the way their thighs are pressed lightly together. Dean has a sudden urge to nudge his closer to Cas’s, to close all the gaps and feel how warm Cas really is. He breathes in, suddenly breathless, and is overwhelmed by the smell of Cas’s skin, familiar and musky, a hint of the patchouli incense he always burns when he’s working. The smell of home. Dean’s heart is suddenly racing so hard it hurts. “Cas?”
“You don’t know what a relief it is to not care about any of my stupid hang ups anymore, to just be able to say what I want without giving a damn about any of that shit,” Dean tugs at the cuffs, lets out a groan of frustration. “And,” he whispers, darker, “You like me like this.”
After a few more phases of the far-distant moon, the desperate, frantic anger faded into something different. Dean started speaking slowly, as though it was an effort just to work the words from his mouth into the ether, defeated by the inevitability of the silence that would meet them. Castiel found himself almost missing the raw agony of Dean’s earlier prayers, the fluid fear and fury of them. This was stillness, if not silence. Dean’s acceptance of his isolation, of the quiet Castiel was condemning him to. He no longer said
Dean resigns himself to silence, picking listlessly at his cheeseburger as Sam and Cas talk about the case. He’s just about brought himself down from full-blown meltdown to mild panic when Sam slides out of the booth, leaving him alone with Cas. Immediately, Dean’s heart starts pounding again uncomfortably.
Dean lose it like that, because of him, because of this. When Cas pulls away, Dean is still breathing hard, but he sinks down so he’s on his knees like Cas, grabbing him and crushing their mouths together messily. Both hands come up to hold Cas’s face, like he’s something precious. Cas whimpers helplessly and clings to Dean, rocking his hips involuntarily against Dean’s in attempt to alleviate the now almost painful pressure in his pants.
The only thing worse than listening to Dean slowly fall apart was knowing what would happen to him if Castiel went to him. How the Leviathans that were already so close on Castiel’s trail would tear him apart. Castiel tried not to think about how Dean might not care, anymore. That he might welcome an end to the abyss.
“Dean,” Cas feels the smile spread across his face, all his awkwardness eclipsed by genuine delight, “That’s amazing. Congratulations.”
Eyes still on Dean, Cas reaches up to find Dean’s hand where it’s still clenched against the counter-top and links their fingers together. Something warm blooms in Dean’s heavy-lidded gaze, and he squeezes Cas’s hand softly, all warmth.
