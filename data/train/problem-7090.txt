"Let's go get some appetizers, dear." Nat says, squeezing his arm. Her Russian accent is laced on pretty thick, although Steve has perfected a fake one of his own just for the occasion. He follows her closer to the refreshments table and the string quartet playing next to the table. She plucks a quiche off a silver tray, taking a slow bite out of it; her eyes light up. "Mm, this is amazing, you have to try it," she pushes it between his lips with her fingers, using it as an excuse to lean closer. "Your 8 o'clock," she whispers, leaning back with a smile on her face.
He sets a hand on her arm, smiling gently. "You too dear," he says, brushing past her and towards Steve, who was apparently too busy to notice his approach. He was not going to make a scene, so help him god, but his blood boiled over the flame in his chest. "Sorry to cut in, but I'd love to borrow my boyfriend for a moment," Tony says, grabbing Steve's wrist and putting his shoulder between him and the brunette.
"Well try it better," Jemma instructs, peering down at him with her hands around a burnt loaf of bread.
"Any time," Tony mumbles, his mind still fuzzy around the edges.
"Right, well, sorry to disappoint."
"Then act like it asshole!"
Steve has forgotten just how stupid of a movie this was, and god, he loved every second of it.
Tony's eyebrows shoot up. "Oh, I didn't realize you were the owner. Well, it's nice to meet officially." He holds a gentle hand out to Steve and Steve feels his cheeks flushing at the simple offer of a friendly touch. No—it was casual at best. Steve takes his hand, feeling strong fingers scarred with years of hard work.
At least he still had his little patched together family. Bruce, Victor, Peter. Pepper and Rhodey too, even if they didn't live in the tower anymore. It was really far on the down low, but Pepper was actually pregnant right now. The marriage had been planned and set in place before she had even realized. She was only two weeks in now, so she wasn't showing at all which was lucky given that she had bought the dress before.
"Sure thing. J, can you throw some black in there?"
Steve hands over his gift, unable to suppress the grin from that stupid nickname. "Happy birthday." Tony smirks as he pulls away the wrapping, revealing a small box with two matching bracelets. "You mentioned business trips, so I thought these would be a nice way to stay connected. The other one lights up when you tap one."
Steve nods. "I trust you."
Tony squints at him. "Don't take this the wrong way, because you're welcome, but what the hell do you mean? Why would I be mad at you?"
But Nat wasn't coming back for another peanut butter sandwich. He screws the lid back on, and puts it away in the cabinet. "Morning Scott," he says.
"Sam said you were famous," Bucky says, squinting at him.
"Nice view. Who do you live with?" He asks, most likely noting the music to be heard from behind Pietro's closed door.
Steve leans forward with one elbow against the counter and he takes his first sip. Well, it was certainly expensive wine. It had been a prize he had won at a wedding party a few years ago for one of the girls he went to college with. She was sweet, and it was kind of her to invite him, so he came halfway across the country to see her, even if they weren't great friends. Apparently she had splurged on the prizes too. (He bet Tony would buy expensive prizes too.) "Then you, Steve Rogers, are the rudest man I've ever met," Tony says, leaning forward too until their lips aren't so far apart anymore.
Steve tries not to take that personally, babies just cry. Still, there was a point where if adult Tony saw Steve he might've burst out crying too.
that's not a deal breaker for you, is it?
he is
Steve swallows the knot in his throat. "Yes, the late Mr. Malik positioned is within SHIELD to gather intel on what they were doing and what Zola was doing."
She smiles at him through the hard, wrapping a hand slowly around a bar and shifting her hips. "Could you help me with a little problem I'm having?" She asks slowly, dragging her eyes up his body.
It was only a few weeks since their arrival, and honestly Steve hadn't been expecting it. He forgot exactly how much time had passed since his arrival in the past, but he hadn't been surprised. He hadn't seen Maria yet, but Howard has been complaining about her moods nearly every time he came downstairs. It was all good natured of course, because he would be back by her bedside as soon as he could be. She was quite beautiful, and Steve didn't think it had that much to do with the pregnancy glow thing.
"Nope. He said he had a thing with you." She squints at him. "That's true, right? He's not doing anything he shouldn't be?"
Steve nods sporadically after a moment, "um good idea," he says, watching as Tony grins, then bobs his head down onto Steve's throbbing cock. He knew that for it to be this red, Steve had to be actually very close already, so with only a few practiced moves, he had Steve moaning like a virgin and coming undone, copious amounts of come spurting into his closed mouth. When Steve came, he came a lot—supposably, as far as Tony could tell, because his high metabolism produced a lot of sperm, especially when he was horny. That however, was irrelevant, because Tony was quite practiced at holding it all in his mouth when the situation called for it, and it did. When Steve is done, Tony pulls back and swallows down a full load, still holding enough come in his mouth for someone who was unpracticed to be choking on it. "Tony," Steve mutters, lugging Tony up so he was situated in Steve's lap, which he found to be only a little embarrassed. "Love you so much."
She quirks a brow and shrugs. "May as well, right?" She rises, sauntering over to the cell bars. She hangs against them, calling out in a coy voice. "Guard? Guard?"
ok good
He was a celebrity, which Steve had been polite about up until now, but there was no telling what he would do now. Tony could see the tabloids now, TONY STARK FORCES HIMSELF ONTO STRAIGHT MAN. It wasn't exactly true, but they never really were. His feet splash against wet concrete as he walks out to his car parked at the end of the street. He unlocks it and slumps into the drivers seat, setting the cake box on the other seat. Dazzling blue eyes swim in his thoughts, crinkled with the lines of happiness.
Adam comes up to them, a pencil tucked behind his ear. "That was quite the display Mr. Pozdnyakov. As customary, we will grant one request for you, so long as it is within our power."
"Right, right, yes ma'am." He stumbles to his feet, brushing his pants of gravel. Steve hands over the power stone and Peter looks up at him. "Thank you for your aid, Captain America," he salutes Steve and Steve tries not to burst out laughing.
Tony chuckles. "You're on the ac dec team. And we're not dead. I guess you both missed the press conference?"
"I'm not here for that, man."
"What about just you, me, and some close friends?" Steve asks gently, running his fingers through Tony's hair.
Steve blinks. "We had champagne, but that feels inappropriate now." Steve says, rubbing the back of his neck. "Would you like something else?"
"You wanna watch Monty Python?" Peter says after a short while.
But Peter doesn't respond. Did Tony really have a son? He could ask, or he could do a google search. Ah the perks of going out with a celebrity.
He presses his dick against Steve's rosy lips, which part for him gratefully, letting Tony slip into the slick warmth of his boyfriends mouth. "You think I should fuck your pretty face?" Tony asks sweetly, rocking in and out in shallow thrusts on Steve's tongue, while he hollows his cheeks around Tony's weight, doing his best to nod.
"Is that... it?" Nat says, relaxing into his side once more.
One last mission. At least Steve was safe now. There was no telling what this would do.
"How'd I get here?"
He hesitates only for a moment before fumbling with a ring of keys and opening the cell. "Yes, for you."
He nods mutely, his jaw clenched so right it must be painful. Tony glances at his shoulder, the armor dented in a perfect cast of Steve's fingers. Boy was he glad for his armor. "Steve." Tony flicks his wrist, the armor retracting from his hand so he can cup Steve's cheek, his fingers bumping against the cowl. "I got you." His pained blue eyes meet Tony's, and damn if he didn't look like he was on deaths doorstep. "There's some food back at the wreck. Okay? We'll head back, you can eat something, it's gonna be ok." He hopes—desperately, might he add—that Steve believes that, because his heart could not handle if Steve kept looking at him like that.
Steve can't help but laugh, even when Tony fixes him with an annoyed look. "I think it's cute. Do you have a TikTok too?"
Bucky just blinks. "Sorry, what? You.. there's no way I have enough money for—"
He kicks his speed up a bit, only to find the still flaming back half of the plane, it's Hydra logo still blazing. Tony lands anyways, holding his injured arm gently. "Steve! Steve!"
"That's me," Tony says, clearly trying his best not to glare at her.
"That's not what this is."
"...We're eating." Tony says slowly, his eyes back focused on Steve.
"Might be shocking to you, but I'm not really good at this." Tony snorts, which is how Steve knows he got his point across. "Flirting has never been my forte. I was bedridden and sickly as a kid."
Steve knocks the chair over, it clattering to the floor loudly. "Sam!" He feels a grin blooming on his cheeks.
"I didn't....."
Steve pats his back gently. "Course you do. Come on now jerk, it's time for you to get married. Well, in twenty minutes. Your makeup looks good."
"Maybe you should've!"
Too fast for Tony to stop, Steve grabs at Tony's burnt up hand, pulling the reality stone into his palm. There is a chorus of panicked screams as red light burns it's way up into Steve's arm. His eyes slip closed and he lets out a scream of his own, a flash of red light enveloping Tony's vision.
He had never asked for them back; never even thought to. As far as he cared they were locked in a chest at the bottom of the sea.
"It gets weirder actually," Nat says, looking over at Bucky who is rising from the chair, nervously waving at him. "You have some catching up to do, cap," Nat says, walking up to him. "Lucky for you, we happen to be great at summaries, would you like to get some lunch." She sets a hand on his arm, smiling kindly.
"I'm a pastry chef, dear."
Then the entire room undergoes a  well rehearsed transformation into a ballroom with tables and chairs around the back side of the first floor. The second floor was already set up for eating. In less than 10 minutes, the had all the food set up and all the tables made for the guests to return to. Sarah announced that they could eat whenever, and then Sam and Bucky had their first dance, to nothing other than Shake it Off by Taylor Swift, a choice that Steve has adamantly recommended against. Only then is the dance floor opened up, and therefore only then does Tony appear in front of where Steve was sitting. "You look great. Did you cry? I'm pretty sure you cried. Not that I'm judging, I think it's cute. Do you want to dance."
A bright display of red and gold shoots into the sky and Steve smiles. "Reminds me of you."
"Efforts have been increased by 100%."
"I was sent here to defend the soul stone, which I can never possess myself. Well.. could never possess myself. It looks like you have brought it here for me."
even if he hangs out with Rhodey too much
Tony follows after him through the door, flipping his keys into his hand. "So real talk. Wanda. She's a good kid?" He looks up at Steve, walking towards the elevator.
"You sure man? I know cake tastings are hard," Sam says, his apron already off and hung up.
"You bet." Steve knew he was lying, and judging off the look in Bucky's eyes, he knew the same thing. The helmet folds over his face.
Luckily, they had one connection. Gideon Malik, CEO of Gothite Industries at only 19. Steve only knew the name Malik in passing, he had seen it mentioned only once in the thousands upon thousands of HYDRA files he combed through after the fall of SHIELD. Who's to even say that he was involved with HYDRA yet. But, it was worth a shot. Luckily, Howard was able to procure all invitation to a stuffy banquet being held by one of Howard's connections that the 19 year old would also be attending. So they all went. Howard, Maria, Steve, Nat, and little baby Tony, only 4 months old and already on a secret mission to save the world.. or at least to save his parents. In an odd way, it felt almost like a family outing. Maria is bouncing Tony on her knee, such a sweet image in contrast to what they were here for.
Jarvis nods. "Very well. Please follow me." He walks crisply towards the grand staircase occupying much of the entryway. Natasha follows him, and Steve follows her. "If you're truly going to be staying for eight years, I believe Howard will be happy to rent you an apartment nearby."
Tony lands after what he would guess was a half hour of flying, laying Steve down on the floor. "Hey winghead. You still with me?"
"Boo," Tony deadpans, as he begins to button up Steve's shirt. "This is boyfriend abuse."
"I want you to stay out of it." She squints at him, then opens her mouth to protest. "Please, we don't know what's happening here and you're not at 100%."
"Good. I will be expecting a full write up of SHIELD's activities that may concern HYDRA or the safety of the world. You will be expected to drop this file off at 10:00 am sharp on March 15th at 1400 I street north west, in Washington DC. Failure to do so will result in immediate expulsion from HYDRA. The chance that you will see anyone is low. Leave the file on the doorstep and go." He rattles off the information, and Steve already has it memorized, but he writes it down just in case.
"I love you so much." Tony's hands automatically wrap around his body, finding him much thinner than ever before. The serum. He gave up the serum. "I'm sorry. I get it if you—"
Steve heads back towards the kitchen to grab two more cakes. He brings out all the cakes, two by two, until he finishes. "That's all the cakes, sir. Would you like anything else?"
if you hurt my dad again, I swear to god I'll kill you >:(
Tony? What?
Tony heaves our a heavy sigh. "Oh Peter. Come here," Tony says, scooting towards the edge of the bed. Peter obliges, falling into Tony open arms. "Of course I'm not mad. In case you didn't notice, I don't think there's anything wrong with having a boyfriend." Steve smiles. "I just wish you'd told me sooner. When can I meet him?"
"Yeah. They had a hard life, but.. well to put it simply, they're both great kids." Steve feels the almost wistful smile he gives back to Tony creeping across his face. "For what it's worth, I'm fairly sure she loves him. A lot."
"Okay.. ok. Um, Happy's with my friends at the Tower of London."
"I will see you two in January then," Gideon says, nodding to each of them in turn.
"It's down there?" Tony challenges, turning his attention on the skull.
"Habubuh." Tony says in response, smiling a toothless grin.
Steve rolls his eyes. "Come on genius," he pulls Tony to supporting his own weight and closes the door behind them. "You don't get to eat the cake until the reception, Peter."
Tony flashes him a smile. "Great. So we can do another soon."
"I keep the blue one though, right?"
Whatever the fuck that meant. Yeah, there would be a long conversation later. "Not to interrupt your r&r, but you should change if we're gonna go get your friends," Tony says, tossing back a pair of pants and an AC DC tee shirt. It wasn't mandatory, but a vast majority of quinjets had at least one pair of clothes on them, because they all came with some picked out by Tony. Another perk of being a tech giant, you can force good fashion sense onto others.
Well.. it's not.
"No, Tony, wait."
"Holy fuck." She says, staring at him wide eyed. "I mean, I guess I should've known that he wasn't kidding, but really, holy shit. I thought you were dead. How do you know me? Who are you?" She directs the last statement at Steve and Tony decides he likes her. Smart, fast thinker... not unlike Tony in that.
Inside the stone, he can feel the raging spirit of the Skull, who he could bring back with no effort at all.. but below that... below that was a quieter presence. Natasha. He tries to pull her from the stone, but she remains firmly on the other side of the soul realm. "Nat," he says, looking down at the stone, and the orange light wrapped tightly around his hand. "How. Please," he begs with the stone, falling to his knees.
Steve smiles at him before answering the phone call. "What's up Buck?"
He nods, then walks away without another word, leaving Steve to move the cake to the cart alone. Something he could handle. He was a grown up, and he was certainly capable of moving the cake, large though it was. So Steve piles the tiers in their separate boxes onto the cart, then he tucks the extra pieces under his arm and begins pushing them towards the building. A man wearing a chef's hat opens the door for him, and Steve smiles gratuitously.
Awwww.
"He killed my mom? Barnes killed my mom. Steve, I.."
"Today is the third of July, sir."
"Can I get a name for that?" Steve says gently, almost guiltily. He didn't really need a name for what it was. He would know that man anywhere. However, he couldn't stand another waking moment not knowing the mans name, not now that it was so close to his grasp.
"Why wouldn't you be?" Another long beat of silence passes, Tony chewing on his lip.
"Come back here Sam. You can crash with me if you really can't talk it out." Although that was definitely something that Steve wouldn't like to happen. He was kind of expecting company tonight. But, surely Sam and Bucky could talk this out. They loved each other. That was something Steve knew in his bones.
Sure enough, the rest of the Avengers gather shortly, including some intergalactic visitors. And.. two teenagers. One of them must be spider man, the other... Steve has no clue. Pepper picks up the wreath of flowers and Tony's first Ark reactor. The people inside follow her out and to the water. Steve stands alone, watching the wreath drift away. Presumably, his mind should be racing, but he can't find a word other then Tony that truly explains his emotions. Tony Tony Tony, his mind chants. But Tony wasn't going to answer. The rest of the day passes by in a blur of faces, hugs, and tears. Until Bruce comes up to him, his eyes red. "Hey Steve. We've still got one more mission left."
"Nonsense, on my happy day, you called me a bitch, remember. Water under the bridge. I just want to make sure nobody is going to stop me. I don't want to cause a scene." He really couldn't get a read on her. All he knew was that last time the siblings had met it had indeed been.. a scene. Which, she was right, wasn't something they needed today.
"You can't wear that to the party." Tony pouts, and leans up to kiss him.
"You must loose that which you love," he repeats, staring into Steve's eyes.
"Steve Rogers," Steve introduces giving her a little wave. "Hi Peter."
Nat nods, smiling down at Tony who had crawled over to her and was leaning against the side of the couch, offering her one of the circuit pieces. "Thank you, dear."
"No, you're not," Nat says, taking it and snapping it shut. "This is what you were sent here to retrieve, we got it for you." She tosses it to him, as he catches it, eyes wide open.
"When I was doing research on Howard, you have no idea how surprised I was that he actually settled down and had a kid. I wasn't surprised to find all the stuff about Tony sleeping with anything that has a pulse."
"The fountain in Central Park," Steve replies, swinging into the passenger seat.
"That's true. He has been photographed intimately with several members of the same sex over the years."
"In return, I think you should really let me put a sign on your ass. Or even just print it on your pants or whatever." Steve lets out a sigh of relief that turns into a laugh.
"Of course. It doesn't hurt anything to speculate. Judging from the context, we can assume that James is the man more commonly known as Bucky Barnes."
"It's almost one, Steve. If you don't need anything , I'll see you tomorrow." Jesus, how time flew when you were having fun. That expression had always seemed a bit circumstantial, but this had been the shortest four hours of his entire life
"Epic forced of darkness and light—" he continues to talk, and Steve watches, until the final words Tony Stark ever had for them in this life—everything's going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to. I love you 3000–directed at Morgan, of course, but for a spare second, Steve imagines that they were for him. A declaration of love, sure, but it was forgiveness. Something in his mind protested that the words weren't his, but the hope is enough. The hope that Tony truly had forgiven him for everything.
Instead, Tony swooped the kid up, fostering the very depressed young Peter Parker and paying off every cent of his debt. The decision had taken months to fully register for Tony, and for that time he had stuck Peter in the corner of whatever room he was in and ignored him. He wasn't really fit to be a dad, he was just keeping him off the streets. Of course, that all changed when he walked in one night on Peter sobbing on his bed. That was all it took to turn Tony into an actual father. He got Peter therapy and eventually got the kid to open up. That was around the same time that a 12 year old Victor was dropped off with Bruce, who apparently had a kid, to Tony's eternal amusement. Peter attached to Victor in a way that nobody had been expecting, least of all moody and spiteful Victor. Bruce and Victor moved in with Peter and Tony in the tower then, and for a while they were one big happy family. Victor opened up too with Bruce and Tony, and he and Pete were practically brothers now. Of course now, Vic was an adult and Peter was close to following after him. Both boys were of genius level intellect, so hardly a day went by when at least one of them wasn't in the lab doing something. Right now, both of them were in Tony's will as equal benefactors to the Stark Empire given that he had no biological family of his own.
It became a weekly thing to deliver to the Irish. With every passing week, Howard got more and more irritated by their ‘audacity to take as much money for protection as they did and demand food on top of everything else’. He would tell Tony how awful the Irish were, complaining about how no one could understand them since they refused to speak proper English. Apparently they were also heavy drinkers, which was rich coming from Howard but Tony never said anything.
“You asked for my personal favorite? This is it,” he said and put it in front of Dugan.
Steve looked at him long and hard and then sighed. “Fine.” He walked over to Howard and kicked him, watching in disgust as he toppled over sadly. He looked almost as bad as Tony had when they’d found him.
Tony smiled happily. There was a special joy that came from seeing people enjoying what he made. “Even better than James’ machine that can fly us to space?”
“I could always lend you a book if that helps,” Tony offered, not knowing the rules to any of it.
“Edward! Get out of here!” Howard said sharply and made excuses for his son while Tony put down the cups and headed back to the kitchen. Before he left them, he turned around to look at the man who had caught his attention. From the distance Tony now noticed how pale he was. Not sickly but beautifully pale. Then he watched the man reach out for a sandwich and noticed how beautiful his hands were. Big, strong, veiny. When it seemed that the man was turning around to look at him, Tony quickly disappeared and hid against the wall next to the door frame leading to the front of the store. His heart was beating out of his chest and he just didn’t know why.
“Dmitri is on his way to get you. Stay where you are. Call Maria and make sure she’s alright.” He hung up and called Steve as Dmitri headed out of the room.
“And what would your ma say?” Tony said with a grin, raising his eyebrows which Steve couldn’t see. “I could get her, y’know,” he added even more teasingly.
“If you keep it up with all your help, I’ll have nothing left to do around here!” Sarah complained jokingly and swatted Tony’s hand away. “Go, sit down. You too.” She turned to Steve and pointed to the chairs behind her. After a moment’s hesitation, Tony nodded, poured himself a cup of coffee and moved to sit down next to Steve.
“Whipped cream,” Steve told him quietly, lowering his voice even more to say, “but save some of it for later too.” He gave Tony’s bottom a light tap and then went over to greet his mother and Benni.
“Last I checked, not getting a good friend a wedding present is a sign you’re a bad friend,” Steve said kindly, still not sure exactly how Pepper felt about him. He rested his hand on Tony’s back, his fingers scratching lightly to ease whatever was currently troubling his mind. “You and I may not be
something bad. You were fine before me but you wouldn’t be after me. You’d always be a target.”
“He’s in a prison… of sorts and no, he has no clue where you are. Or Benni, for that matter,” Steve told him.
He hummed a melody while getting a towel and fresh underwear for himself. After his shower he’d go and find his Steve to make sure he was alright. Not that he didn’t believe him, but Steve had a tendency to keep everything to himself despite his promise not to do that anymore.
Steve had just lifted his glass to his lips to take a sip when Tony spoke. He turned to him, scrutinizing his expression, trying to read those big brown eyes he loved so much. There was something there and he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
Benni grinned and said “
Clint smiled, looking up at him through those long lashes. “Kinda like the taste of it on you.
“He just fell asleep,” he said and she nodded. “Should we go home and get ready?”
. I don’t trust him,” Steve instructed. “I want Tony making weekly deliveries too,” he said, not just because he loved his sandwiches but to keep his own updates on Tony and those colorful marks on him.
“Also very tired.”
The piece that Steve was playing was emotional and heavy. It felt sad but also as if there was no rest, no peace even though there was beauty. It reminded Tony of countless waking nights when he felt the same, especially towards the end when he didn’t know how many more days he could make it with what little money and energy he had left. The accepting of his own situation—that he would soon be dead one way or another—the deep rooted sadness over a life he could have had, missed opportunities, longings he couldn’t give in to. When he closed his eyes he could watch his most miserable times in his life pass right before him one more time without it hurting. The music put all his hurt into a form that was able to be heard but only understood if you knew it was there.
James laughed.
“What is it?”
Steve came into the kitchen a few minutes later looking devastated. He stood there, staring towards the stairs that headed down to the basement. His eyes red around the blue. Sarah came back up stairs then and caught sight of her son stood there, tears in his eyes, not knowing what to say.
Sharon was a nice enough girl. They went out for dinner and a movie, and they even kissed at the end of the night, but there just wasn't really anything there. Once again, Steve goes home feeling just a little too empty for his taste. Which is fine. He wasn't expecting his first date to be the one. He knew this wasn't a rom com.
duh, I'm a great dad
His team tended to make a lot of pop culture references, and Steve was glad to Thor for being in the same boat as his inability to understand.
It was alright, but it still hurt. He shouldn't have thought he was going to go see Tony anyways. He did it to himself.
oh god I'm turning into Peter
"Not upset. Not even surprised." Steve runs his fingers through Tony's soft hair. "He trusts you." It was almost hard to say. Steve had longed to get to Bucky first, be his anchor and such. But Tony had found him, and Bucky had decided that he wanted to trust Tony, and he hadn't been able to look at Steve. Just how the cards fell, he supposed.
"Yeah," Steve says, the breath already knocked out of him.
It wasn't that he wasn't happy for Tony; the man deserved to be happy more then most. Steve had just never been good at moving on. He hadn't been able to fully move on from Bucky or Peggy... the 40's in general. He had wanted to. He had longed to start something new. Bucky came back to him, but Peggy was gone. Peggy... Peggy was lost to him long before she had died. Tony was lost to him long before he died. Bucky could still move on. Steve had brought him back. Bucky was back to him once more. Except Bucky wasn't his. Bucky shouldn't be his. Steve's biggest regret was knowing that he hadn't moved on, but Bucky still could. There was no place for Steve here any longer; it was time to go. It was time to let Bucky move on. It was time for Steve to get on with his life, but he couldn't do that here.
He nods, even though she can't see him. "Yeah I'll see you. Be safe." That was just a blanket recommendation. Safe on the roads, safe walking up the stairs, and maybe safe in the bed if they so chose.
He laughs. "Well when you put it that way..." He looks over at Steve with a wide smile. "Not all of them, no. In fact most people don't make it past one night."
"Ugh. Fine. You're both annoying."
"Good, because I also have something to ask of you. I'm out there too, somewhere. I crashed the plane into a field of arctic ice that shifts around all the time, but I'm out there. I need you to find me; Bucky's going to need me."
"I think my parents would cry if they found out we weren't pure." Steve can almost taste the ire in that one word. The anger of a mother that someone could think her son wasn't perfect.
The call disconnects and Tony reaches for Steve's hand. "He sounds... really rattled."
"Ok, uh, sure."
"We're not dating, but yeah." Steve helps him out of the cell smirking at the shocked look on his face.
"I'd like to see you try," Steve responds weakly, doing his best to smile up at Tony. It didn't take long to figure out what was wrong with the soldier, but it took a moment for Tony's head to catch up.
See, that just made Steve want to punch out some high schoolers. At least Peter had people who loved him, like Tony, and apparently a royal family. "Wow.. would it be bad if I hit a kid?"
"You can always trust me cap. I hope you know what you're doing, and that whatever it is, I'm behind you."
"Ok just me and Bucky then," Tony says, smirking.
Kids plural?
"Can't stop thinking about her, can you," Tony taunts, bracing his arm over Steve's chest and baring his teeth angrily. "I'm gonna make you forget everything but
"Well, it's for the vibes." He pauses, a look of feat on his face. "Oh my god I sound like Peter."
Steve feels a subtle hand on his thigh, patting him in a soothing motion. "I'm sure we could... work something out," Nat says, her other hand tucking back a loose strand of hair.
"It's the word!" Tony protests, propping himself up on his elbows to look at Steve. "I don't know. Sounds stressful for three superheroes." But he doesn't sound opposed, and he certainly doesn't sound disgusted enough to dump Steve for suggesting it, so that's a win.
"Thanks Cap. C'mon Jarvis!" Howard heads up the stairs, lugging his bags of baby stuff. Jarvis nods to Steve and follows in a more dignified manner.
what did he say?
Tony smiles. "Good to hear. Now, I also have the technology to make it.. well, really really strong if that's something you're into. Steve said he started working out so he could make bread." Bucky snorts. "I don't know if you have a similar thing. Or I could just um, put inhibitors on it to make it only exactly as strong as your other arm at any given time."
But Tony had to be wrong... he had to be. He was letting his emotions cloud his judgement. He had been ready to welcome Bucky back with open arms just last night. Steve was right. He was making the right call. He knew Bucky. He knows Bucky.
"Have to tell you..."
"What?" Howard says.
Uh oh Stevie! You’re in trouble now! But who kissed who 🤔
How could he not know that voice. It was a voice that tormented his every sleeping moment and more than it's fair share of walking ones. Well, not just the voice. There was something about that man that Steve couldn't shake off and it was driving him crazy, especially because it was more then his inability to flirt keeping them apart. Hell, he didn't even know if this guy was into men. "Yes, of course. You could come in on Friday." That was three days away. He could wait three days. "We close at 8 on Fridays."
Tony sighs, and wrings his hands together nervously. "I want you to stay. I love you, Peter, even if you want to.. keep things from me." Peter looks away guiltily. "I just need to know you're not in any trouble."
Meanwhile Tony and Benni were with Steve, the boy now in a better mood and chatting away while Tony simply looked at Steve. He set his cup down and told Benni in Italian he wanted to talk to Steve.
“Didn’t expect you to be here,” Steve told him.
“Before we arrive,” James said, still a few blocks from their location, “I want you to remember that not everyone gets to see this side of me.” He gestured to the hand that was holding Clint’s and he lifted it and pressed a kiss to his knuckles. “So if I’m colder than usual—”
“Sorry, I was lost in thought,” he said with a smile and rested his hands on top of Steve’s. “Of course he’s going to miss you. He looks up to you, Steve. He wants to be as tall and strong as you are.” He raised Steve’s hand to his lips and kissed it. “What about you? Are you excited to get away from here?”
He’d been as gentle as his self-control would allow, being kept in check by his desire to not hurt Tony. Steve felt very satisfied himself, and sleepy, but he would stay awake to make sure Tony was alright first and to clean him up.
"You know that's not what I meant."
Bucky jabs a finger into Tony's side. "You might be ok with them calling you a cheater or a whore or whatever, but we're not."
Tony parks in the garage below the tower, getting out of the car. He takes the cake but leaves the jacket, too drained to care. His feet feel heavy as he trudged into the elevator, not needing to tell JARVIS where they were going before it moves. The doors slide open on the penthouse floor and he steps out, looking down at the cake.
"I love you too." Tony responds, one hand reaching up to trail through Steve's hair.
Gideon shrugs. "He was a real character." Which was probably code for: a huge fucking asshole. But of course, none of them would ever say that. Nobody would.
Steve takes a bite of his own, the dish melting on his tongue. "Yeah. I.. really enjoyed this."
"Isn't that my line?" Steve sighs deeply, resting his head against Tony's shoulders. "I care. I do. I just can't... I can't let him slip out of my reach again."
Maria smiles subtly. "Not even a date? I assumed you and Natasha were going out with the way Howard talked about you two."
Steve laughs. "Yeah, it woulda." Pietro was a good guy. He never failed to brighten any room he was in, even if sometimes his humor was a little dry. He even cleaned up nice when he wanted to, and one day he would make a just fine husband. As it stood now, he tended to jump from girl to girl, but the one he was with now was pretty nice. Steve had even met her once, which was further then most of the girls got. Crystalia, her name was. She said her dad had never been in the picture and her mom had gotten to the birth certificate before the birth drugs had worn off. Everyone just called her Crystal though, which was an actual name, so what did Steve know really. "I didn't know you were scheduled so early," Steve says, squinting at Pietro.
They dial in the coordinates in awkward silence, and Steve is very aware of the redness in his cheeks. He hadn't exactly... meant to kiss her, but it had just felt so right. It felt.. right, like it was meant to be. But is she didn't feel the same way, then he knew far better then to pursue. First of all, his mother raised him better then that. Second of all, even now he was lucky to have all his body parts intact. Third of all, he respected her too much, loved her too much to try shit. So no, that was one thing he wouldn't be pursuing.
Tony cups his jaw with one hand, the other undoing his pants with skilled ease. "So eager for it. Tell me Stevie, do you need more? Am I not doing enough for you."
Ow. Right in his heart. And really, he knew he wasn't enough for Steve, knew that this wouldn't end well, but when he phrased it like that, Tony found himself quite unable to say anything but exactly what Steve wanted to hear. "Jarvis.. set a reminder for next Monday to take Steve out for boba. On a date." His suit lights up once, as if Jarvis was signifying a message received, and Tony feels something palpable in Steve relaxing.
"He's having a panic attack. And he turned down a marriage proposal that he wanted to accept, so well, I'm guessing there's another person I'm going to need to find too. You don't have to come with," Steve offers, looking up at the waiter coming back towards them.
"I get the feeling. Now what do you say we have some drinks?" Tony bats his eyes at him. Steve rolls his eyes with a fond look, only letting go of Tony's hand to climb into the car.
All’s well that ends well :)
"Um.. why is Peter so scraped up?" Betty asks, leaning into Neds shoulder, obviously falling into that post adrenaline tired haze.
The chef follows his distracted gaze and she punches him. "I know, right? It's so weird to be in the same room as the Tony Stark. Well, you look dressed for the party, but if you want to come back, I'm sure Meredith could put you to work." Before Steve can ask what that means, she's gone, presumably back to the kitchen. What did she mean Tony Stark? Wasn't his last name Rhodes?
"Well, I didn't mean to!" Steve throws his hands up, no longer holding onto her elbow.
So lots of emotions in this one... In my original draft of this story I had Nat and Steve bring Bucky time traveling Doctor Who style for a while and Nat and Bucky falling in love. Well, I abandoned that idea clearly, but that’s because I wanted to show Steve moving on in a concrete way and the way I want to end this... well, let’s just say that that storyline wouldn’t have worked out. I hope you’re enjoying so far! My posting might get a little splotchy coming up here, I’m nearing the end of the school year, so there’s a lot I need to wrap up, but I do intend on finishing. I love you all!
"I'm so sorry miss, but I've got to go," Tony interjects rudely, the woman gaping at him.
Tony rolls his eyes. "That was an easy mistake!"
The red skull crashes against a boulder, the breath knocked from his lungs. "I see—ha—you have delved into legend. Well, as have I." He thrusts our a hand, and a column of golden-orange light flies out of it, arcing straight for Steve. He sees himself fall to his knees, and vaguely feels the dull sensation of hitting rock. More important in his mind though, was the feeling that his chest was being crushed. He couldn't breathe, couldn't rise. "Elongated exposure to the soul vortex... well, it has had interesting effects on my capacities." Steve chokes on his tongue, the feeling of it heavy in his mouth. The edges of his vision tint black. With the final shred of his strength, he sends a shooting bolt of lightning towards the red skull. It knocks him away, and all at once he gasps for breath and sends electricity coursing through the Skull's body.
"I'm not fragile."
"Where is Jane?" Thor asks, also relieved that his friend is safe for now. He surely wants to be the first to tell her the good news.
"I'm Steve." Steve says easily, smiling up at Ned, from where he had the med kit balanced on Peters knees.
"Go change your clothes, Rogers," she says, her voice still gentle.
Steve breathes heavily, completely naked sparing Tony's sheets twisted around his legs. Tony walks back in, holding a wet rag with a dopey smile on his face. "Hi beautiful."
"Can you do.. black?" Bucky asks tentatively, walking up behind Tony to look at the holographic image in wonder.
? And then he noticed the window that led out to the fire escape was open, pushed up, but why would anyone climb three stories and break in to sleep on their couch?
“What? Who are you?” he asked and Steve laughed.
“I do, ma.” He stood and kissed her cheek before leaving, shutting the door behind him and walking to his own room. But he wasn’t tired so he turned and headed back down to the living room to just sit in front of the fire—where he stayed all night—and think.
to me like some kind of brothel workers and only recently has it occurred to me just how incredibly offensive and demanding that was of me.”
Steve put his book down and said, quiet but firm, “It’s for you.”
“We need a way to surveil the area without being noticed,” Steve said.
“No. But he knows we are acquainted. He’d seen me at the bar.”
Steve then spoke of the racketeering he was maintaining neatly, giving vague details because no one needed to know all of his business. He mostly spoke of the protection-racket and his own dealings with the few drugs the Irish dealt in—prior to the repealing of the prohibition their main product had been alcohol but it was no longer an item of high value.
“More than one friend. Just one more-than-friend,” he said, and crossed his arms over his chest now that they were stood at the car.
Steve frowned when Tony didn’t speak. “Oh no, do you hate it?” If he did, he wouldn’t be the first. Steve had dated people before who found the idea of eating a home-cooked meal boring and not something that could be considered a date. He’d be disappointed if that was the case but for Tony he’d do his best not to show it.
“You sure? Because maybe Tony could give you some tips for next time.” Steve threw a roll at James’ head and he caught it and bit it.
It was two days later that they both had a bit more energy from the increase in food and were chatting quietly with one another. It had been a quiet day. One silent food delivery and that was it. They didn’t let their guard down but they did find themselves having more desire to talk.
“Well, let’s keep doing it how you are. One day at a time. You or Benni see something you wanna do, we’ll make the time and do it. Simple.”
“We do
Tony’s hand on him woke him but it took a while. He startled, moving away.
Tony looked at the money, then to Steve and then back at Sarah. It was way too much, as usual. She gave him one of her looks until he took it, thanking her as he did. “I shouldn’t talk about our plans again. Remind me not to please.”
Slowly, Steve approached him. He was lying face down and snoring lightly, just in jeans and a t-shirt. He looked to be about the same age as Steve, give or take a year. Steve pushed his shoulder and he stirred but didn’t wake up, swatting a hand out at Steve as if to say
He rubbed his eyes and looked around his new space. It looked like a converted office. There was a bucket in the corner instead of the toilet he had had before, a small barred window that let in slightly more light than the last room, and then—
Steve stood, straightening his waistcoat. “Sit,” he barked and Tony took a seat.
“You think—oh, right. I hope you were. They need a sign that we’re alive and haven’t given up.” He smiled and rested a hand on his shoulder. “Your cheek is going to bruise. Did they hurt you anywhere else?”
you feel this way while he’s upset and vulnerable?”
Tony looked to the dishes and felt bad for leaving it to Sarah and Benni but Steve was his priority. “I need a shower first. Would you like to join me?”
Steve felt a little sick to his stomach seeing Tony react like that. Tony was wrong. Someone was at fault. Bakuto was at fault,
Steve sighed, content, and nuzzled his face against Tony’s hair. “We’ll just have to agree to disagree on that one.”
They pulled away, not saying a word but simply smiling at each other before they made their way to their home where they were greeted by Sarah as soon as she noticed them. Tony left them to each other to go and change.
Steve, still smiling and feeling a surge in confidence, admitted, “I like you, Tony. A lot. Probably more than I should after just two dates.”
James nodded again, understanding. “Clint flat out—” He cut himself off, still staring at the ground, focusing on one particular piece of hardwood to keep himself composed. “He was tired, drifting off. Told me in no uncertain terms that he thought he was going to die and that it hurt that he didn’t get to say goodbye.”
Steve stayed up a while longer but not much and eventually went to sleep too. Still, as always, he was the first one up the next morning.
Steve wanted Tony to travel and see the world, even if to just one place for now. He wanted to get him out of New York for sure, away from the noise and chaos, away from all the bad memories connected to the city and into a new surrounding where the two of them could form all brand new memories that were theirs and theirs alone. He wanted to give Tony a honeymoon even if he couldn’t give him a wedding.
James and Steve watched from a distance while Tony visited the graves of his mother and little sister, bringing them flowers. Behind Steve and James stood Dugan and Dmitri but some ways back, unable to hear their whispered conversation
Tony was at Coney Island Hospital on the top floor in a private wing. He’d been in a coma for a week now but was expected to make a full recovery. He had a huge room to himself complete with couches, a wonderful view and the best staff the hospital had to offer. The hospital was owned by none other than James Romanov.
“I’m sorry but do you honestly expect me to believe that you’re gorgeous, smart, funny,
“Would you be alright to call it an early night, love? We don’t have to sleep right away, I just need some alone time with you.”
“So, Tony,” James said, and he seemed to be the real talker though his public persona was much like Steve’s—quiet, concise, angry. “How would you have done it? Caught the bird’s notice?”
“I wouldn’t let that happen,” James told him.
“I haven’t been to the beach in years. It would be nice if we could make the time.” He nodded and looked around the room because he couldn’t look at Steve right now.
“A puppy? James? A lot has happened, apparently,” he said with a small chuckle and finished his bread roll. “If you promise he’s nice, I’ll give it a shot.”
By the end of his visit, he was cast-free, boot-free, and broken-leg-free but advised to still take it easy for a little while. No sports, be careful on stairs, ease back into putting weight on it. But he was sent home without crutches and that was all he had been hoping for.
James pursed his lips, thinking.
“To what do I owe this pleasure,
“Would you mind if I lent Pepper this record?”
He’d spent the majority of his morning in his room with the door closed, just lying on his bed deep in thought. What on earth was he thinking last night? Or rather, this morning.
Clint nodded. It was the most he could do and he felt Phil rub his back reassuringly.
James rubbed his hands up and down his face, brushing his hair back and then slumping in the chair, his usual perfect posture completely thrown away.
“You okay?” He asked him, his lips at his ear again.
“What? You never thought to mention that your best friend is the
“I never knew. Can’t even really remember it and Win and I were good friends,” she said, speaking of James’ mother.
“Right, sure ya will.”
“He’s stable. An inch further up and we would be having a different kind of conversation. He’ll be in his room in a few minutes.”
“James,” Steve tried again. “Where are we?”
Clint and James exchanged a look while Benni continued to explain about the moon and how it was different from the planets. Sarah listened attentively, James nodded as though he was listening and he was, kind of, but he was also focused on Clint.
“Of course not,” James said, feigning innocence. Sarah rolled her eyes and came over to hand him the box and press a kiss to his cheek, Benni behind her and he gave James a hug.
“So the assumption is that it’s Bakuto based solely on the fact that it was an Asian man I found at the bar?” Natalia ventured. She trusted James and his judgment but she wanted hard proof.
“Right. In that case, I’ve got you a lovely Ford Prefect just waiting to be driven,” Pinky told him, winking in the mirror.
James could hear talking in the kitchen and the smell that wafted his way made his mouth water.
.” He sighed. He knew it would only worry Tony to hear him say that but he was determined to tell the truth.
“Steve… you sound like the little one when I don’t allow him sweets before dinner. And then Sarah comes and gives him some anyways.” He smiled and put a hand on Steve’s cheek to turn his face towards him. “He said I shouldn’t have to ask to know what’s going on with you. That I should know your business. And he said the fact that I don’t realize you’re scared says more than enough for him.”
Sarah didn’t reply at first which made him more anxious and nervous and it only got worse when she put down her cup and got up. Did he say something wrong? Was she upset?
“Does it ever stop? Feeling like you’re killing them over and over again?” He asked bluntly, hoping Steve wouldn’t mind. For the first time Tony admitted it to himself that he had killed Howard. Yes, he knew he had shot him and Howard had died. But before that night he never said the actual words. “It’s not that I regret it. I’m just sick of seeing him. I can’t sleep.”
“Word travels.”
“I'm sure he does,” Clint said. It didn’t mean he agreed with his approach. “Maybe you can put in a good word for me when we get out of here and finally have that dinner. Hey, are you over twenty-one?”
Tony slid down next to his brother and wrapped an arm around his middle.
Not like Steve was going to offer his assistance. And he was pretty sure that Nat wouldn't either, because she longed to set him up with someone and she would never miss an opportunity like this. It's not that Steve doesn't want to date, it's just that he doesn't really know how to talk to people. Making stunning desserts? Piece of cake (get it?). Starting a conversation with someone he found attractive? May as well be the most difficult task known to man.
"You'll have to work a lot harder than that," Steve says with a warm grin. "Besides I'll have to take you out this time."
"That's my line." Steve says solemnly, getting into the car with a sad look on his face. He was wearing Tony's clothes, if only because nobody else's would fit him now. At least, not that's in the compound. Steve drives away, the engine on the sports car revving of its own accord.
The man raises his glasses to rest against his head, pushing his dark hair away from his face to reveal dark brown eyes. "I was wondering how much your special event cakes cost," he says cooly, an easy smile on his face despite the roaring waves in Steve's gut.
"I try my best," Steve says, unable to stop the joy from blooming through his chest. "Jarvis, can you turn the lights out?"
"Don't ruin the moment," she instructs, her breath warm on his neck. "I really am feeling better."
"Well happy birthday to me," he says flirtatiously, rising to his feet. "Sounds like a deal."
That he would kill me if I hurt you. He seems like a good kid though.
A chorus of congratulations and compliments erupts and severally hugs occur. Tony stays silent, just staring at the photo with his head on Steve's shoulder, which happened to keep Steve exactly where he was.
Luckily they had been in one of Tony's quinjets, or they wouldn't have made it to the hospital in time. She had woken up while Clint was still knocked out on anesthesia (her surgery had been performed with precedence). Steve had been out of the room, but Clint later told him that he had woken up to beautiful Russian singing.
Steve pinches his arm, rolling his eyes at Tony. "Can you shut up."
"My pleasure." Tony rubs Steve's knuckles in a way that the both of them did a lot since coming out of the war.
"More then I probably should have. You weren't exactly quiet. So long as you can promise that Howard, Maria, and their son will come to no harm from whomever you are searching for by the time 1991 rolls around, I will keep quiet about all of it." He has his hands folded in front of his chest, and his voice is almost unconcerned by the world shaking information he just accidentally received.
"Yeah I know." Bucky shrugs, handing him the golden envelope in his hand. "And you're a secretive bitch."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thanks Scott. You want some pancakes?" If Tony were here, he would tell Steve not to cook in his expensive suit. His chest twists.
"Yes, thank you very much. Have you met Miss Summers?" Gideon gestures to the blonde woman who was apparently not Pepper, hardly faltering at the arrival of what he would assume to be work friends given his ease at handling the whole Hail HYDRA business.
he's not interested
He's a bit breathless when he looks up at Steve, a wide smile on his face. "Hey there," he says, removing his wet jacket and hanging it up next to the door. "Thanks so much for doing this, it means a lot to me," he says, his brown eyes twinkling at Steve.
"Steve," Tony whispers, looking up at Strange pleadingly. Apparently he gets it because a portal opens, Steve Rogers in a set of Tony's clothes—even those were too big for him now—on the other side, stepping out, with his eyes wide. "Steve."
Steve takes it. "Promise me Natasha."
He also hopes that Pepper doesn't show up at the shop to try and kill him. That wasn't even something he had been worrying about, but now that he thought about it, it was a real possibility. He doesn't really know if he would even have the heart to try and stop her from breaking his face. He deserved it.
It's a real, honest to god laugh that escapes his lips this time. "Aw come on, aren't you going to get all sad and thank me for my service," he teases, bumping Tony's arm with his own.
"Please sit down Sir," she says, holding her hands out and taking a step back, her fingers twitching for a gun that wasn't really at her side.
Nobody.
Steve walks over to the kitchen, grabbing a glass bottle from a cupboard. "That's Pietro. Wanda's brother." He pours out some water and sets the flower in it, rubbing the petals delicately between his fingers. Pepper was right, Steve did like the flower. It was a sweet gesture, especially knowing that Tony had been nervous about this meeting too—well, nervous enough to ask his friends for help.
Unfortunately for Howard, at that time, Steve and Nat have risen enough in HYDRA's ranks to have become a staple in HYDRA procedures, and therefore an obvious hole of they were gone. They were getting close, Steve knew it. Howard could wait. They hadn't been here the past nine months only to compromise everything now.
Tony nods, his eyes large. "Deal. We'll see you in a few hours." Peter makes an affirmative noise and the line goes dead, Tony immediately slumping back into his arms.
Sam chuckles wetly, patting his back. "Thanks man. You wouldn't know the name of a good baker, would you?"
Steve shrugs. "I can't say that I can."
"What did you think fondue meant when we met."
"Steve, thank god your back," Nat says, about to step into another door with a pile of boxes in her arms. She halts and Steve walks up to her. "Bucky is having a little anxiety, and we don't want Sam to know cuz duh. Go talk to him," she says quietly.
"Where am I?" He repeats, standing up.
"Mr. Stark. You're awake," she says, a smile blooming onto her face. "Once again, I have saved a broken white boy." Tony groans in response, as pain courses into his body—or was that pain killers? "Don't stress yourself. You are safe."
Lizzie offers her hand to Steve, and he takes it, bringing it to his lips in a smooth move. She blushes red, and smiles up at him with inquisitive blue eyes. "Ivan Pozdnyakov."
The ascent back to the top is long, and Tony can only stew in his pissed off condition. What right did Steve have? Absolutely none, whatsoever. The worse part still was that now Steve could sacrifice himself, and Tony would have to go on alone.. back to the people who had always cared for Steve more than him. Their friends. Everything would be the way it had always been, but he had been given a glimmer of what could be. This would be hell. "Now listen here you stupid fucking baboon," Tony growls as soon as his feet hit the ground.
"Goodnight." Before long, Steve is left alone in the silence again, but it feels different this time. He had spent all day with Tony, and they hadn't fought once. It was nice, and he hoped to god that they would be able to replicate that tomorrow. On their date. Their date holy fucking Jesus. His cheeks flush and he finishes up his spaghetti, sinking lower and lower into the couch. Well.... there were only two ways this could go. Hopefully of it went bad at least they could stay friends.
"Like number of coffee cups I have every day? Yep."
"Not your fault." Steve sighs, feeling very small. "What do you think. Do we need damage control? I mean, I guess I'll have to resign now, so it shouldn't really matter."
Steve shrugs, taking the first sip of warm coffee. It sprouts across his mouth with the taste of searing vanilla and strawberry. He blinks away the vision of Tony's lips on his. There was no hand on his cheek and no puzzling man in front of him, just a question. "Yeah of course. Gotta meet the parents." He was proud, really. That was way further then Pietro usually got, and as far as Steve was concerned, it was time for him to settle down. Even if that made him sound like his mom.
"Well.. we know better than most that it never gets any easier." Steve says, smiling sadly over at Tony. He squeezes Tony's hand before Tony pulls it back to bring the quinjet down towards where he sees Peter standing with a teenage girl carrying a mace. Sure why not.
At all.
those jackass kids hacked my servers and put memes in them, so I assume that's when they did it
They had been childhood friends, inseparable, even when Steve's ma lost the house and they had to move. Every morning, Steve would be up at four to walk the five miles to Bucky's school. When he was lucky, Ms. Barnes would pick him up with a smile spreading across her rosy cheeks and her hair impeccably curled. "Hey sugar," she greeted him.
He shrugs. "I don't mind the celebration, I just.. don't encourage it."
"Steve will you come out back with me." She, at least, has the decency to not look at him like he's useless... even if he is. Her voice isn't exactly angry, but Steve can tell that she doesn't want him near her daughter.
Tony looks up at where Pepper and James are indeed taking their seats with a little huff. "Damnit. I'll catch up with you in a minute, Steve." He retracts his hand from Steve's and Steve lets the hand fall to his side, content with the promise that Tony was going to return. "You two kids behave." He winks at Victor.
"A week. You should re-dye your hair." She tucks gets feet under her body, leaning easily on the arm rest. Steve nods, focusing back on the TV. It was shit, but that's what he sacrificed coming back into the past. "We've been here for a year tomorrow."
"Well, you see, we actually only procured invites to this event recently. We were undercover working for Howard Stark under the instruction of the late Gideon Malik," she makes a small frown, setting a gentle hand on his arm.
Steve nods, satisfied with his answer. Then the elevator opens, and Steve steps away, only to be assaulted by an explosion of confetti. "Happy birthday, Steve!" Their friends shout, the lights coming on. Steve blushes quite brilliantly, and looks around the room.
"Right?" Steve says, looking at her like she's gone crazy.
"Apparently not. I'm sorry, I love you."
She reaches her hand out of the bars, trailing a finger down his jaw, leaning as close as she can. A thin coil of magic sparks around her finger and his body goes rigid. "I'd just love it if you would open this cage for me."
Nat on the other hand, Steve has met in culinary school, a second generation Russian immigrant raised on more Russian then English. She was a whirlwind from the first meeting, after all, both of them shared a love of real red velvet cake. None of that box shit. You make it from scratch the right way, or not at all. She had no interest in dating herself, but she was always the most invested in Steve's love life. They had stuck together after graduation and she moved in with her friend, Maria. She had helped Steve build up the business from the floor up, and if there was a single other person he owed the bakery to, it was her.
"Oh yeah. I only worked under him for a couple of years though. Then it was mine and I pretty much gutted it. He worked on the Manhattan project, and I work on sustainability mostly." Tony scans it and hands it back. "Any spot?"
A beat of silence passes then and Steve can feel eyes boring into the back of his head before Tony decidedly chuckles again. "Thanks. You might be the first."
"Score." Tony pitches his voice a bit higher, pumping his fist. "And you take me out for shawarma."
"Hello," a voice says only a little to his left.
"Are you serious. Tony," Steve groans, unable to stifle his laughter.
Steve leans into the touch, his eyes shutting it what looked somewhere between bliss and death. "Cold."
"No no no.. like as a favor. For a friend," Tony amends quickly as if disgusting by the idea of charging Bucky for a prosthetic. "Actually I'm looking into advancing the technology even further if you want to be on the front of a new project."
Steve frowns deeply, rubbing the eraser on his pencil against his scalp. He just couldn't get the angle on that building right.. he couldn't capture its sleek modernized elegance. Things were smooth before 1845, but everything was dirty. The depression, the war, the streets of Brooklyn. Steve had never seen an elegant thing in his life before 2012. At first it had upset him... why did everything need to be immaculate? Was it not enough that things were there?
Then hell opens up behind them as a missile slams into the back of the plane. It explodes loudly, and that's when Tony knows he fucked up. Immediately, he grabs for the seatbelt on the captains seat behind him, wrapping his hand in it so he wouldn't fly out the back end. He spares a glance backwards, not particularly thrilled to see the sky behind him, before focusing back in on the task in front of him. He wasn't going down without a...
Woooh so that was a big one! Now our boys have to find the love on Bucky’s life.. stay tuned, and thanks for the encouragement 💕💕
"Night Steve,"
"Hello Mr. Stark, it's nice to meet you. Hey Steve," Wanda says, returning his glare then smiling at Tony.
Steve hums gently. He was definitely feeling sleep tugging at his body, just laying here in the dimmed lights with his very warm boyfriend cuddling onto his side. "Good night."
"Do you want to hold him?" Maria offers after a moment of eying him, taking a step closer to Steve.
That almost makes him laugh. Of course Steve could have two. What had he been thinking. "Ok."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, I found that I actually enjoyed working out, once my lungs weren't on fire," Steve jokes, grabbing his hand out of the air and pulling it up to his lips for a gentle kiss. It was tender, like a scene out of a hallmark movie.
"Hi ma'am. Thanks for the ride." Something about the novelty of the car (they had lost theirs shortly after the house) and the perfection of the woman had always turned him into a respectable boy.
Thor nods. "Certainly. We must walk and talk though, I must go to see the lady Jane at once."
Steve's pretty sure that's how love works. He's never been in love, but he would sure like to be. It was too soon to say really, but he could see falling in love with Tony. It's not something he would commit to right now, but really, he can almost picture a life together. Them and Peter and all their friends. He could be friends with Tony's friends, and Tony could be friends with his friends and it would all be good. Maybe. In the future.
The teen comes out anyway, his arms crossed over his chest. "What are you doing?"
"Bullshit. You implied that your hissy fit at your wedding was his fault," Sam says, his voice low and near a growl.
As he's about to walk away, she lets out a whimper of pain, turning over. "Stark, do you know any Russian songs." Steve asks quietly, rubbing her arm.
"Okay."
"Scared? No. Justly concerned? A bit. I saw what he did to Fury's car, and I like all my cars a lot. If they get destroyed, it should be by me."
Tony looks away, turning the TV off. "How's tomorrow sound?"
"Oh I absolutely do." Steve sets his phone down on his lap, waiting for it to download. Sure, now he had a TikTok too, but that was excusable, he was sure of it. He only wanted one to see one persons videos. Maybe Peter too, the kid seemed nice enough. "How far is the restaurant?"
"They're gonna have a kid." Tony looks up at him, then over to Peter, the tears in his eyes suddenly making perfect sense to Steve.
Well, of course he nods, he wasn't going to ever say no to this woman. "Right. Um, yes. Me and Tony."
Out of his mirror, he sees Steve leave the bakery soon after Tony himself left, his own good pulled up as the blonde walked past all the cars on the street. He was probably going to get a cold. If Tony came in in a few days, he could probably avoid the baker entirely if he was sick.
Tony hurries off, to his room where he tosses off his shirt, grabbing one that he thinks may or may not have been Steve's at some point, and yanking it on before getting a damp rag and wiping at the mess of flour all over his skin and hair. Once he looks semi presentable, he hurries back down to find Bucky staring at his cake batter. "I don't think you did this right."
"So I'm uh.. sorry for ruining your date," Bucky says, rubbing the back of his neck.
Tony turns to him, stopping at a mostly open space. "I think this is the most expensive room I've ever been in," Bucky says, looking around appreciatively.
Slowly after that, they began making each other meals, first just a sandwich, then a big bowl of salad left on the counter, from fruit platters, to sweet pancakes set in the center of the table, until eventually they began sharing nearly every meal, trading off cooking duties.
Steve grabs the cup in front of him tightly. "This is very rude—"
"Rogers," Nat says from down the hall, doing a little speed walk towards him. "The cake is outside, right?"
"Bye Tony," Steve says, tracking him with his eyes until he's gone with a funny little smile. "What do you want, Nat."
But that was all gone now. He was alone—save for Bucky and Sam, but they were strangers now. She was his everything, his closest friend, his sole confident. Sure, he had held group sessions for people to talk about their losses, but he never once mentioned Bucky, Sam, and Wanda. They were too fresh in his mind, an open wound even now. He still missed Peggy, but she had lived a life. That had been easier to talk about. He lost so much, but he always had Nat right by his side. He wished they could've traded places. He would give anything for her to be okay. He loved Tony, but he loved Nat too. The ever looming cloud of swirling purple glares down at him as the rocky terrain grows more solid. His boots don't crunch anymore, and his hair blows in the ever present wind.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony doesn't look at him, instead tossing the tablet onto his own bed, turning around and shaking his hand. "Fuck. Fuck! Steve, he killed my mom."
Tony rolls his eyes, but steps away from Steve slightly, his hand reaching down to keep one of Steve's hands on his hips. "Victor, what can I do for you." Steve glares at Wanda who seems caught between laughing at him and freaking out because she just found her boss/roommate kissing her boyfriends uncle.
"I'm glad to do it." Steve rubs his arm. "You can count on me, Bruce," he says, smiling a smile that doesn't reach his eyes.
"Okay."
"What's my surprise?" Steve's voice comes out like an innocent enough question, but they both knew he was trying to coax it out of Tony.
What a weird ass situation. "I don't know." Seriously, Steve didn't have young people in his life that he was in charge of, and least of all did he have kids who hid freakin bracelets in their school bags. "Do you want me to call him?"
"Yes sir, is that all."
The following day had been the first time he chickened out of going to see Tony. He decided not to because he knew for a fact that Tony didn't want to see him. They had had the funeral, but Tony hadn't said a word to him. Steve had even been invited to Tony and Pepper's wedding, only about a week after the funeral, but he suspected he had only been invited as a courtesy, because still, not a single word from Tony.
"Lizzie Summers."
He dips the tea bag into the steaming water, twirling it with his fingers. Maybe he should read a book. He preferred nonfiction, but he also found himself reading quite a bit of fiction after someone else mentioned it on a mission or at the table.
"Thanks Sam."
"Well Howard needs to get going. I'll be back to collect you two in a moment." He steers Howard towards the door to leave the room, then in a quieter voice adds: "And I believe you have much to catch me up on, Mr. Stark."
Sounds good. I'm at work right now and Sam is being a pain in the ass, so I'll talk to you later.
"No I know that. Relax." Steve pecks his lips. "But you do, right? I saw how you looked at him." He smiles easily, to signify that this was a safe topic of conversation and he wasn't mad at all. Hopefully Tony got the message, otherwise this would be like shooting squirrels.
And we also know that Steve is READY to make out with Tony at a moments notice 😌
Steve smiles, leaning on his elbows on the compartment between them. "Promise?" he teases, batting his eyes.
we can do something else
"I missed you so much," Tony says quietly, keeping himself firmly buried into Steve's chest.
"Yes, right," Steve snaps back into action, following Maria as she walks into the living room and sits down in the armchair. Steve sits in the loveseat next to her. He fixes his gaze on Tony again, who was snoozing thankfully. Steve wonders if Tony will remember him—if he and Nat will be around long enough for him to form memories. "So.. not to pry, but I don't really know that much about you..." Steve says, looking up at Maria through his lashes.
Steve kisses him gently. "You know you have me." Now that was true. He wasn't in love yet, he knew that, but damnit, he knew he could be, one day. He could feel it every day, snaking into his chest, warm, and fuzzy, and absolutely devoted.
The tall man returns with a cart, offering it to Steve, who takes it graciously. "Thanks."
"Alright folks, welcome to the reception, woo. Yeah." He pumps his fists in the air in a mocking manner and the crowd laughs. "So, you probably know me and you probably know the bride and groom. Let me be the first to tell you though, that they only met because of me." Another chorus of laughter. "Really! Pepper was my personal assistant, and one of the only people I knew who could tolerate me, when my old college buddy got assigned to liaison between SI and the federal government. Next thing I know, they're making out in my bar. And then this jackass." he bumps James with his hip, and James smiles up at him with a fondly resigned look. "Proposed! Well, so of course I'm paying for the whole shindig. So I guess what I'm saying is, the foods going to be good! We'll be serving shortly. Until then, enjoy the music!" Loud 80's rock begins blaring and Tony takes a seat saying something quiet to Pepper and James. Both of their eyes land on Steve and he gives a little wave to them. Pepper raises a brow at him and looks back at Tony.
Wanda huffs in disbelief. "I can't believe you hooked a billionaire in three fucking minutes." She slides her way into Victors arm, holding his hand tightly. "Took me months."
Sam picks up his rain jacket with a chuckle. "Night Steve."
Bucky turns, his eyebrows shooting up into his hair. "We met. Oh no wait, you were on a date, weren't you. Oh, I'm so—"
Except that Steve knew, somewhere in SHIELD's facilities, Zola was working along to instil power through each and every branch of the United States government.
Peter and uh Princess Shuri of Wakanda
He nods his head slowly. "Okay." He picks you the space stone carefully, turning it over in his palm. "Aren't you tampering with the time space continuum right now?"
"No! Don't.. don't do that." Steve sits down on the couch, abandoning his tea cup on the table. That was a lot to process, and his brain didn't work quite like Tony's. He would just have to worry about unpacking that all later. Right now, there was a matter to be attended to. "Sorry um.. yeah. I can.. do a thing. I guess I should explain."
Tony looks back at Steve. "No plan. No gear. We're not even Avengers."
"He's ok, baby. He'll be here in a few hours. You can make sure that he stays here overnight." Truly, Steve wasn't 100% sure that Peter was okay, but he was sure that Peter would be okay, and that's what's important. They'll take care of this. "I need to go pick up your birthday present." Steve says, rubbing his arms.
I’d just like to say that bill and teds excellent adventure is actually terrible, but I would watch the new one they’re making. Idc idc.
Tony smiles, easing his eyes open to savor in the moment, early morning light filtering through the thin curtains, basking Steve in a warm glow that made him look simply heavenly. Lush blond lashes still fluttered over his pink cheeks, the innocence of sleep not yet gone from his face. Maybe innocence wasn't the right word though, because Tony could see the evidence of last night staining his neck and shoulders. Tony was sure he looked the same, if not worse. They would both be opting for collared shirts today.
"So you're offering me super strength," he jokes.
You know, Steve’s shield is actually listed as “the new shield” in the script, so if you were wondering, he actually probably did it get from Howard again
"I'm gonna put ya down now, okay kiddo."
"Well, at first watch, all I can really say is that he seems very happy. We see a lot of the Avengers team on social media or out and about, but it's a rare occasion we see Captain America out of the suit."
"M cold." To see the great Captain America reduced to two word sentences isn't a sight Tony would have ever wanted to see.
Nat studies him for a moment, taking another long drink from her bottle. "Sure you won't get sick of me in the next 8 years?"
It's a while before Steve can think to say anything. There wasn't much to be said. Tony knew and Steve knew, and there was time for conversations like that later, when Tony's son wasn't hiding a large, mysterious, and potentially dangerous secret. "You should change into something more comfortable," Steve says finally, getting the feeling that he had brought Tony out of a deep daydream.
There were always people who criticized the actions of the Avengers. There would always be those people. To some, they seemed more like a government agency than anything, which was rather untrue. The government hated Tony, and it wanted to lock Bruce up. Thor had nothing to do with America. Nat and Clint worked for the government, yes, but that wasn't public knowledge. Yet, looking at Steve, at his suit, his shield, all people could see was America. When he had first donned the suit for battle, it had been a monicker he had worn with pride. All these years later, it seemed more like a burden than anything else.
Finally, just as the sun is beginning to lower itself in the sky, they head back to the tower. Steve holds his hand as they walk through the busy streets, an adoring look on his face. They stop on a corner, and he leans in closer. "Can I kiss you?"
Tony chuckles. "Great. You'll pick me up at 6?"
"Nope."
Except they were already going down. Or more accurately, he was going down, because Steve was gone. Fuck. Tony's fingers close around the USB, laser focused on the uploading bar, as if he could will Hydra tech into not sucking ass. He looks up at the tree line as the plane feels the first tops of the snow covered lines grazing its underbelly. Seconds later, the plane is ramming through trees at full force, and the only thing keeping Tony from falling out the gaping hole is the fact that his arm was twisted in the seatbelt. By a stroke of luck though, the upload does complete, and Tony is able to fumble the USB into the slot on his suit before the plane slams into the ground, and he knocks his head against the roof of the plane, finally loosing consciousness.
"Oh I totally agree. He's practically glowing, which is surprising for someone who was forcibly outed."
"Never better," he grumbles, slumping back down into the chair and grabbing the med kit off the wall.
Still, Tony knew very well that it wasn't long now before he was beyond the point of being able to reign himself in. He was a romantic at heart, after all. But he was ready. He was ready to fall into Steve's arms, because he just knew that Steve cared more than Sunset ever did. Tony reaches up to run his fingers through Steve's adorable bedhead, his breath fluttering onto Tony's lips. "Steve, baby. You're gonna ruin me," Tony says quietly, kissing him again. This time, Steve reciprocates, kissing back softly.
There's so many things Steve could say. It was Tony's fault they hadn't seen each other for two weeks. But all that anger was... it was useless now that Tony was back in his arms. "I love you."
"I'm not going to forget the cake Nat. Calm down." She pinches his arm.
"So are you guys like dating?"
Tony slips down to kneel in front of Steve, his pants tented obscenely with a dark wet spot sticking out. He pushes the blindfold away from Steve's eyes, both of which were closed as he sat, still quite stiffly against the wall. "You okay?" Tony asks as he tucks the tie into his pocket.
"You're cute," Nat says, tilting a head at the sleeping Steve on the screen.
Tony puts his fork in the frosting and licks the frosting off the metal prongs. Steve can't help but imagine him licking something else. "That's amazing," Tony says after a moment, his sparkling eyes meeting Steve's in a tender way. Suddenly, Steve can't help but feel every inch between them like a burden, few as they were.
"Oh of course. You know, strawberry creme is my favorite." Steve smiles, grateful for the release from their scrutiny.
"I'm working as fast as I can Rogers," Tony snaps, knowing exactly what look Steve had on his face right now. It was probably the angry puppy one if Tony knew his shit, and he did. Tony pulls up the files they needed, tapping out a few lines of code for it to start uploading.
All around him, shouts of "finish him," erupt, and he knows he has to. He feels the fear in the other man as he begins to beat the back of his skull in. He doesn't stop when he feels shattered bone under his knuckles until his fist crashes through the now long dead man's skull, sinking into his brain with a sensation that makes Steve gag.
"We almost died, sir. And I woke up in jail this morning." Peter deadpans, slumping into one of the seats.
Then Steve gets called in on a stealth mission with Nat. An unknown assassin tries to kill Fury like a common man. Fury shows up at Steve's hotel, bleeding and proclaiming SHIELDS newfound compromise. Steve begs Tony not to come down. Tony, bastard as he is, listens to him for once, and not a day later Steve is missing, a fugitive, and not answering his phone.
Tony let's out a violent curse as the elevator behind him dings. He turns, positioning himself in front of the bowl—not that he was doing much to hide the mess—with an award winning smile directed towards the person who hopefully wasn't Steve.
"Oh yeah! Did you not see the press conference? Me and Rogers are no longer officially dead as of.. an hour ago." Tony feels a hand slip into his. "I'll just track you kid."
"Mother fucker. Friday, take me up to the clouds." This was just like Steve. Tony hadn't even remembered the override codes, but of course he had. Tony had tried to save Steve, and no luck.
"You too. Bye," she says, a bit muffled like the phone is already being pulled away from her ear to hang up.
Tony smiles at Steve and waves him over. Alright. He steels himself, walking towards the large table, through the people, some of whom were now dancing. This was all going to be fine, yeah? It's not like he had really done anything wrong. He hadn't kissed anybodies fiancé. Well, at least not that he was aware of. He had, however, probably hurt Tony a little in the past week or so. If Tony's friends wanted to chew him out for that, then they could get that right. They deserve it, even.
"Steve Rogers," Steve says, offering him a hand to shake—the one that meant he wouldn't have to do some maneuvering with the crutch. "I have some explaining to do." Daniel shakes his hand hesitantly, a look of shock on his face.
"I know. But I owe it to him. I read the files, I know where he should be soon. Even if you won't help me, I have to."
"So um, feel free to touch anything that doesn't look super expensive or dangerous," Tony starts out as soon as the doors open, walking through. Bucky's light footsteps follow after him. "Most of that stuff is upstairs though, so there's not that much to concern yourself with. So, today, we're going to be doing preliminary scanning and some rudimentary design. By the next time you come, I should have a functioning prototype, and we can run from there."
"People like Bucky," Steve says softly, steering the conversation back in a way that wouldn't make Tony look so sad.
"Right. Well, I looked at the list.. kinda a lot, so I have it down pat. Unfortunately, his next assassination isn't until September 7th, 1978, in London. Georgi Markov."
"I'm in Central Park by that fountain."
"Wonderful." He rambles something about how he always knew that communism would never be able to survive.
"Interesting idea." Tony leans against the counter, resting his elbows and looking at him in a way that makes Steve want to forgo the drinks completely. Another part of him longed to stretch this out as long as possible so he could just keep talking to Tony.
Tony types out a message and erases it several times while Steve nervously finishes his sandwich.
She kisses his cheek. "Of course I do."
Steve takes in a shaky breath through his tired lungs. "I love you." He emphasized his words, hoping that they could get through Tony's thick skull. "I loved Bucky, but I love you. I have to... you understand right? I have to find him. But not because I want him back, or you're not enough, or whatever your dumb head says."
He shakes his head no subtly, because he wasn't. She possessed enough tact to handle the situation smoothly and without causing a scene, and he knew that she understood that just because he wasn't okay didn't mean that he had to be babied. She was the one who took care of him after his first panic attack. He had been utterly unprepared when he heard her say his name behind him—it hurled him back to the forest in Wakanda, Bucky turning to dust between his fingertips. His last word, Steve's name on his lips. Natasha pulled him up off the ground and picked him up over her shoulder to get him to the couch, where she implored him to breathe with her. Whatever she had been going to ask him was long forgotten as they settled down for a long night of trading stories about their fallen teammates. He woke up the following morning on the couch, with her sprawled atop him, a comfortable weight that reminded him that not everyone was lost.
Tony whirls his head, hovering in the air. "Steve!?" He swears he had seen a glint of red. Again, there it was. Tony races down into the trees, landing in the deep snow. "Steve!"
Peter winces and rolls his eyes. "Mr. Rogers, he's abusing me. You saw that right? Someone call CPS."
A tall, put together man appears, presumably the same Jarvis that had been driving the car and the namesake for Tony's first AI. "So these people..." Jarvis trails off, handing Howard a slip of paper.
"MJ," Peter says, his suit halfway off.
Steve kisses his nose softly. "I feel like I should probably tell you something."
"Like I said, I can have my lawyers on it doing damage control, but it's already." Tony waves his hand. "Sorry. I feel I probably should've caught this before, well... you can blame me if you want." He says it so nonchalantly that Steve thinks Tony must be used to people blaming him for things that aren't his fault.
Steve's jaw goes a bit slack. He hadn't told a soul about his plans, but of course Bucky could tell. "I— I'm sorry," he says, looking away. He was sorry. It didn't change the facts. He could never make himself move on fast enough to help the world, and Pepper was right, it needed him now. He needed to go away for a while.. maybe right a few of his wrongs, then he could come back.
Tony blows him a kiss as he walks off, and Peter scrunches his nose, saying something that Tony probably deems disrespectful, given the look on his face right before Steve turns away. He walks to the back corner, pushing through clumps of mingling people, where there was a door with a sign that Steve knew without needing to read said "Wedding party only... and also Tony Stark. Hi Tony." In fact, Tony wasn't actually supposed to be back there, but Sam has insisted after Tony RSVPd to the event. After all, how many people have billionaires come to their wedding.
"One of the six singularities created at the dawn of the universe, sister to the aether, lost to the ages."
"Russia, originally. We're here on visas working with the government." Steve answers cooly, folding his hands in front of him.
Wanda shrugs at him, the corners of her mouth twitching up. She looked very well put together, and not at all like she had been woken up two hours ago (with terrible bedhead) by Steve going back for Tony's gift. Victor looked equally nice, which was a stark comparison to Peter, who had his fists clenched so tight, that Steve couldn't imagine it not hurting. He seemed to be wearing the same clothes he had worn to school yesterday, but other than that, he seemed to have tried to pull himself back together. Steve couldn't imagine him not being torn up though, even if at first glance he looked just fine.
"My thoughts exactly. And, if all else fails, we know where to find him in a few years."
"Stay here." Thor pushes through a door, leaving them alone.
Steve smiles softly, interlacing their other hands once more. "You could. If you want." He gently leans in to kiss Tony, and Tony smiles against his lips. "Let the whole world know you're mine."
To be fair, Steve is pretty proud of the fact that he doesn't fumble with the keys before he gets it open. "Got it. Promise I won't get you cat litter." He pushes the door open and walks backwards over the threshold. "So Sam and Bucky probably aren't going to get married for a few months."
"Very coherent, sir," JARVIS responds, moving the elevator as Tony had requested.
How did he get my number if he's out of the country?
"I did." Betty holds her hand up.. the hand that wasn't holding Ned's. Oh goodie, just think of all the juicy teen gossip he would be able to wring out of Peter as soon as he wasn't like.. in shock.
"Ah there's Happy!" Tony says, setting down next to an upside down car. "You good Pete?"
Steve only gets more popular when he brings out the cake, proclaiming a happy 20th birthday to Tony. That gets a few laughs, and then they cut into the cake. Steve must say, it's very good. There's a reason his cake is so fucking good, and that's because it's made with love.
Pietro begins to sweep up the cereal onto a dust pan Steve hadn't noticed before. Every so often he plucks it up and throws out the cereal. "How'd you sleep?" he asks, looking up at Steve.
Tony hits the auto fly button—which would keep them straight and steady until it was hit again—and leans over to kiss Steve gently. "Thank you."
he asked, but i didn't
Steve stands up, kicking the couch. He was suddenly really regretting letting his employees have whatever off time they ask for. Pietro had gone to the last wedding with him, and he had been good at it. But no. Crystal's mom wants to meet him. Damn it.
"Lemme stop you right there Buck. Sam loves you. Sam asked you to marry him. Everyone out there loves you and Sam, and nobody doesn't want you to be happy ok?" Steve sets a hand on his shoulder. "And if all else fails you can get a cat or fourteen and move back in with me."
"We're just having a friendly conversation," Pepper says, fixing him with a look that somehow manages to quiet him down. "Right Steve?" She fixes him with the same look.
Tony snaps it back away from him and Steve physically winces. "Sorry. Shit. What the fuck. That's not funny Steve."
Steve pats Bucky's shoulders, they pull apart, but his eyes continue to speak volumes more then anything else ever could. Of course he would miss Bucky, with every fiber in his being, but that was the very problem. He had to go somewhere his actions wouldn't catch up with him. He had to. He had regrets that leaving wouldn't solve too, sure, like the fact that he never told Bucky he liked boys, or Tony that he fancied him. "It's gonna be okay, Buck," he settles on, drawing a faint smile. Then Steve pulls away, finality in his steps as he walks up into the machine, activating the time travel suit.
"I know it's been five years your time, but it's not fair to me. Or Sam." The look in his eyes hardens slightly as tears slip silently from the corners.
Steve only went to the ER in that town once, but the woman had made an impression to say the least. She was beautiful, but far too interested in getting Steve's number for his taste. Besides, she wasn't really his type. He had had a really bad allergic reaction to some poison ivy in the woods near the campus, so he hadn't exactly been in the mood to flirt at the time either when his legs were covered up and down with blisters.
He snorts. "Go wash your hands, Tasha." Long ago they had agreed upon the need to keep up some pretenses even in their room, there could easily be a bug in the room and it was better to pretend then to die. The only real conversations they could have were in Morse code, tapped out on each others skin quickly. He walks into the bathroom, ending the possibility of an honest conversation with the click of a door. He looks down at his fist, already healing from the damage it had sustained from his little show. The blood soaked clothes get tossed right down the laundry chute, and he climbs into the small, one-person shower. His reflection is hardly his anymore, so he doesn't bother to look. His hair is still dyed black, and he hardly feels like himself after being here for so long. The cold water and scratchy soap can't get the feeling of blood off of his skin.
Steve shrugs, his eyes flitting to Bucky, who's hands are folded on his lap. He's wearing a shirt without a left arm, the gleaming metal on display for the first time since they've got him. "We don't know how he's gonna react to time travel though."
"Life functions critical."
Steve bites his lip. "Yeah I can do that. Can you ask him if he meant to write a check for three thousand dollars?"
