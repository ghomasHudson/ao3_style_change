Mrs. Hudson returned his gaze and with a tut of dismay she tried wobbly to pull herself to her feet. “Oh dearie I’m sorry, your tea! I’ll go make it right away.”
Lestrade lifted his gaze and looked directly at the screen as growled in responds; “Fuck off..” which only served to earn him a shift blow to the stomach from the other man, making the DI crumple back together. Lestrade let out a pained gasp, filling the audio with coughs and his struggle to fill his lungs properly afterwards.
John and Sherlock, together with the entire Scotland Yard, had worked almost nonstop since their involvement in the case to return Lestrade safely. Sherlock had even gone as far as to ask for Mycroft’s assistance in the matter. The government official had offered a whole unit of special trained special ops to assist in the extraction together with a huge access to top of the line government facilities and resources. While happy for the help, that had proved essential to the mission, both Sherlock and John were surprised at Mycroft’s sudden generosity. Usually he would never offer such favours without demanding several others in return, but Mycroft hadn’t as much as mentioned a single ‘you owe me for this’.
For long moments Sherlock sat impassively, still staring at the white noise on the screen. To other’s it might resemble when he was dwelling deep in thought but in reality, he was urgently fighting the nausea that was welling up in his body after witnessing those horrible scenes. Worst of all, he had no doubt about the truth behind the threats just given.
Feeling the irritation building John idly takes out the organ and marches back inside the living room where Sherlock is currently to be found sitting in his favorite chair, texting fiercely on his smartphone.
“Fine.” Sherlock huffed in annoyance as he once again rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. Yet another persistent headache was gathering right behind his eyes and the slow throbbing sensation made it hard to focus on the work.
Just as they neared the front door Anderson stepped out, wearing his blue forensic crime suit. He pulled back the hood and took off the facemask to offer them both a welcoming smile and raised his hand in a quick greeting. “Hey guys. Sherlock, I’ve just finished taking photos for documentation. Otherwise nothings been touched yet so the scene should be clear for you to examine.” He said.
Sherlock was getting more confused by the minute and his usual ability to process data had been severely reduced by his current state, so he was unable to deduce the situation. “Then what? What are you so upset then?” Sherlock asked worriedly.
Together as a team Molly and Sherlock worked effortlessly. They were in sync, focused and effective as they made their way through the large stack of biopsies to work through. Afterwards they made their way to the morgue, where Molly did the autopsies and Sherlock weighted the organs, noted findings and assisted with the various tasks required. Afterwards they headed back to the lab to write up the different paperwork that needed to be completed, sent and filed. The clock on the wall read 2:55 as the final journal was filed.
“John?! Lestrade do you know where he is? Please I need to speak with him! Now!!” Sherlock actually begged and pleading with his eyes, but he didn’t care. All that mattered was getting to John as fast as possible. His pride was a small sacrifice to pay.
“My, my.. You’re a feisty one aren’t you darling? That’s okay though, I like it a bit rough anyway.” The dark voice snickered from his blurred, faceless assailant.
“That’s enough.” The command finally came from behind the camera and the masked brute immediately stepped back.
Mrs. Hudson had retired hours ago and therefor couldn’t have answered the door, so whoever it was is familiar with the secret location of the unmarked key Sherlock had hidden in the ally at Porter street. The only people to know about said key being John and selected individuals from his homeless network to use in emergencies.
“I am NOT out making trouble! I just saw my friend getting dragged by a huge man into an alley a few blocks away and I’m afraid he’s gonna hurt him! We need to go help him NOW!!” The boy practically begged.
Sherlock is the first one to break the silence; “John.. I need to tell you something.” He says gently, his eyes never breaking away from John’s. John let’s one of his hands caress the detective’s back softly as he replies; “And what’s that Sherlock?” Sherlock’s hold on John’s jumper tightens a bit more. “I wasn’t really talking about Frodo and Sam.” He said with a straight face. John couldn’t help letting out a laugh. “Yeah I figured as much Sherlock. I wasn’t really either. Still meant what I said though.” Sherlock eyed him a bit skeptically once again. “Soo.. Just to make matters clear. You.. Love me?” he almost whispered the last part as he was afraid he’d just misunderstood the whole situation. John smiled fondly and brought one of his hands back to caress a sharp cheekbone. “Yes Sherlock, I love you. I love you so much.” John confessed for real this time, making sure Sherlock heard every word. Once again Sherlock’s eyes portrayed a world of emotions, happiness, joy, bewilderment, surprise and something John sincerely hoped was love as well. His hopes were answers quickly though as Sherlock answered with; “I love you too John. I just never dared to dream you felt the same.”
“Thanks.” John muttered automatically as he quickly rummaged through the contents of the kit, finally finding what he was looking for. He quickly pulled off the wrapping of the pen and looked back to Daniel.
“Wait here. I’ll go fetch it for you.” Sherlock offered and disappeared up the stairs before Sally could argue.
Sally supressed her scowl as Sherlock entered the building once again, but nodded in greeting anyway. She allowed his presence, but it didn’t sit well with her that she had to accept so much freelance help from the detective just to keep up with the workload. Until now she’d never realised how much crap Lestrade had to deal with on a daily basis. The administrative work alone was driving her crazy. Management was more or less breathing down her neck, pushing for results and reports almost every hour. She had to review every single case going through the department, knowing if something went unnoticed or she fails to make sure the chain of evidence is upheld it’s all on her head and it’s stressing her out. Just having to keep updated on all ongoing operation, cases and daily activity in the department is so confusing and she keeps getting things mixed up. She’d always been used to working one case at a time a privilege she’d taken for granted she realises now. It isn’t even a busy time for the division and she’s completely overwhelmed. No wonder Lestrade turned sliver fox so young, everyone upholding this position is bound to go grey early she thought bitterly. And then to think that Sherlock is actually taking a lot of the current workload willingly. Usually Lestrade had to put in an enormous amount of time and work to have Sherlock corporate and even then, Sherlock and John almost never followed protocol in a case. Just thinking about the mountains of paperwork that alone would require to sort out left the temporary DI almost dizzy. She had absolutely no idea how Lestrade managed this job as well as he did. These past three weeks had therefor led Sally to the disappointing realisation, that she was nowhere near as ready for this job as she’d thought herself to be. But admitting shortcomings and inadequacies had never been in her nature. So instead of admitting her need for help and support, her mood had soured more and more these past weeks and she’d started to let the stress and frustrations out on her colleagues.
Yes, this was shaping up to be a very nice evening indeed. Sherlock himself had already enjoyed a couple of drinks of his own and were starting to reach that pleasant buzz this accompanied. This probably also allowed himself to be more outgoing and less inhibited than he normally would be around others but John, but he really didn’t mind that anymore as it would have in the past.
“What are you doing here?! Dexter you arsehole! Did you bring him?! Just leave me the hell alone!!” Charlie shouted angrily and raised the pipe still in his hand in a half threatening stance.
John yawned again and did a quick stretch. Being stationary for so many hours not having done his muscles any good. Sherlock placed a gentle hand on the small of his back. “Wait here I’ll go and try to find us some decent coffee in this place, though I’m not too hopeful.” The detective said. He patted John’s back softly in reassurance and left.
“There’s no need John.. They’re right after all.” Sherlock said, his face still emotionless as stone.
15 minutes later Sherlock and Lestrade stood at the reception of a middleclass hotel where John had chosen to spend the night. Lestrade had offered John his couch to crash on, but the blonde didn’t want to intrude and said he wouldn’t mind some time alone so Lestrade had reluctantly agreed to drop him off right before he himself stormed off to find Sherlock and find out what the hell was going on.
Sherlock however decided to bite her embarrassment in the bud and interjected her thoughts. “Don’t be embarrassed. You suffering from severe claustrophobia is not something you can supress. You should never apologize or feel ashamed for reacting to something beyond your control.”
“God dammit!” John cursed again as the tie was still proving him difficulty. Suddenly two long arms reached over his shoulders and pried the loathed piece of clothing from his hands and took over the task.
“Greg!” Sally called out in slight horror. “You’re a police officer, you can’t handle a suspect like this!”
“Don’t be. I told you my door is always open. Now quickly, get inside and get warm you’re shivering, are you sick? Do I need to fetch John?” Sherlock asked, scanning the boy from top to bottom in an attempt to figure out the boy’s distress.
You guys I’m so, so, sooooooo sorry! This chapter is so, fucking late! I had the most infuriating writer blog writing this chapter, but I really hope you like it!! I PROMISE the last chapter will be up soon!
Sally fitted the boy with a steady gaze. She could tell by now he wasn’t acting and if some creep was out there kidnapping or God forbid molesting children, she was going to do something about it!
It was nearing midnight and Sherlock stood at the window looking down at Bakerstreet while absentmindedly playing a slow, slightly melancholy melody on his violin he made up as he went. It was a clear night, the stars for once shining brightly on the usually cloudy London sky. John had gone to bed early suffering from a headache after a patient earlier in the day had struck him an, albite accidental but true right hook, when he’d wussed out of his tetanus shot in the last possible moment and had acted out of reflex. Knowing John to be stubborn enough to refuse taking any pain medication unless it he was more or less in agony, Sherlock had picked up his violin and started playing in the hopes it would lull his lover faster into a calmful sleep. He knew it’d worked by now, but still kept playing, his mind wandering aimlessly around in an almost meditative manner. He’d found he’d started to enjoy these quiet nights in more and more. More than he’d ever thought he would. Of course he’d always love the thrill of a good case and the ecstasy of a truly compelling puzzle, but since John and he had evolved their relationship to include the romantic sense he’d also learned to enjoy the soothing aspects of domesticity. Small things he’d always taken for granted while he’d been alone. Things like coming home to be greeted with a soft smile and a kiss, making tea for John only to hear the appreciative hum his doctor always made when taking the first sip, the lovely feeling when John would absentmindedly start to trace soft patterns on his back when the detective lay sprawled over the couch and resting his head in the other’s lap, while watching crap telly. Or like now, helping his love find rest by playing the violin softly late into the night if needed.
Sherlock froze on the spot, a cold dread sweeping through his body as he could already read what the teen was thinking of. “Charlie..” Sherlock spoke softly and very slowly reached out for the boy, as if he just concentrated hard enough, he could hold him back with telepathy.
and he absolutely hated it. But whenever it happened Sherlock would always immediately abandon whatever thing he was doing, as soon as he saw the familiar pain flash in the doctor’s eyes and begin the long and slow process of easing and relaxing the doctor once again.
“I know it’s a heart Sherlock, but we had a deal, remember? The fridge is for food ONLY!! No more organs or limps in the bloody fridge!!!” John growled out, not able to hold back the slight anger he felt at the moment.
Sally went quiet, but in the end she nodded her consent. “Alright..” She headed for the stairs, but Sherlock caught her wrist before she could go anywhere. “There’s a backdoor further down this hallway, go through there instead.”
“Show me where he is!” Was all John said, his heart already hammering in his chest. White hot anger blooming throughout him at the thought of someone out there hurting his Sherlock.
But as Sherlock once again stood face to face with the blonde his chest practically exploded with a guilt-ridden piercing pain. The pure anguish in John’s face was so clearly written in his face, his entire posture was tense and stained and to Sherlock’s horror he saw how John were clenching his left shoulder in his right hand and once again favouring his right leg greatly, clearly in pain.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this last chapter and thank you all for your patience and lovely kodus and comments, even though I’ve not been able to reply to all I read every singe one and it just warms my heart that people seem to enjoy this work. Thank you all for your support!!
“Thank you, thank you. I don’t dare think what would’ve happened if you hadn’t been here.” He said. John smiled in return, feeling a huge sense of relief himself, glad he’d been right in his theory.
Sherlock recognized the growing feeling in his chest as empathy. He knew his treatment of Molly in the past had been less than ideal. While he’d always respected her professionalism in her work he’d taken advantage of her obvious crush on him more times than he liked to admit. He’d manipulated her to break work protocol, using her free time assisting in various experiments for his cases and at his lowest even stooped to having stolen her access key to the medical department to steal supplies for his ‘self-medication’ without her ever knowing. Again, John had been the one to make him realise how damaging his behaviour was, not only to himself, but most of all to Molly. Sherlock had tried to make amends as well as possible since, but it has been a process over time which he’s still working on. To top it all of it’s obvious, that even after learning of the romantic development in Sherlock and John’s relationship six months ago, Molly still hasn’t been able to diminish her crush on Sherlock completely. Though it’s clear she’d making a bigger effort to hide it.
The three men started to make their way towards the elevators, but as they were crossing through the open offices where most of the officers on duty were already tapping away on their computers and drinking coffee, Lestrade stopped dead in his tracks and did a facepalm. “Goddammit! I completely forgot to return the receipt and accountings documents from the case to evidence. I can’t leave it on my desk – sorry guys I just have to make a quick rundown to return it. 15 minutes and we’re off, really sorry.”
“John..” he croaked slightly. He had to say something, do something! He had to make this right again. But John held up the hand that wasn’t clutching his shoulder in a motion of silence.
This time it was Jackson who spoke. Those bastards must have planned this all along. “You open this door right now or I won’t be responsible for what I might do to you when I get out!!” Sally yelled. Her heart was starting to pound, and her breaths were already getting shallower by the minute.
Lestrade couldn’t hold back his smile any longer and looked towards John, who still grinned from ear to ear. “Yeah well, I had a great teacher.” The DI answered.
“No Sherlock, my boy, you don’t have too. I’m having the ladies coming over tomorrow. I have to get shopping done, hoover the stairs and my flat and I promised the girls to bake my raspberry pie. I can take care of it myself Sherlock dear, always have.” Mrs. Hudson said, with a soft smile in the end, no doubt to reassure the detective of her own capability.
Charlie retreated as silently and quickly as he could out of the alley. The minute he was out on the street he sprinted off to try any find someone who could come and help!
However, it had been a long day and the moment was interrupted by the doctor’s growling stomach. He tried to cover it up with a cough, but the damage was done. Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson both looked at him. “Oh John that’s right, you must be terrible hungry after such a long day at work. Why don’t I whip you boys up a quick nice dinner?” Mrs Hudson suggested and made to get up, but Sherlock pulled her gently back down. “Not tonight Mrs. Hudson. I guess, just this once since I already did the shopping, I could bless you with my culinary genius and make us all dinner tonight.” Sherlock turned to Mrs. Hudson. “But just this once, I’m your tenant you know, not your housekeeper.” He said jokingly and Mrs. Hudson let out a laugh. He then turned to his boyfriend. “John why don’t you fetch the redwine you received earlier today and enjoy a glass with Mrs. Hudson while I get started?” Sherlock said, his airy attitude slowly finding its way back, but smiling fondly at his doctor.
“Ah yes I’d like a.. A..” He stumbled, shifting through his mind to try and remember. But something was wrong, very wrong. His mind was all sluggish and slow. Even with a few drinks in his system his mind should still be able to run with almost full capacity. What the hell was happening to him?!
Sally snatched it out of her hands. “My bloody grandmother could type faster than you! Just make yourself useful for once and bring me some coffee, black. Think you can manage that simple task?” the sergeant/ DI snapped crudely.
With those final words Mycroft turned on his heel and exited the flat, leaving behind a speechless Ethan Davis in his wake.
“Yeah I know. Sherlock and I just helped Greg out with the last paperwork. We’re heading home in a bit.” John answered. He looked the detective over and did only just now realise the man wasn’t alone. At Dimmock’s side, a young boy no more than 6 or 7 years old, stood with one of his small hands clasped in the detective’s hand. The boy looked up at John with big brown eyes and chestnut hair curled wildly around his head, making John think of a young Sherlock. Even through the drowsiness though, John couldn’t help but notice the boy’s glassy eyes, fevered flush and slightly ragged breath, his doctor mode taking over automatically.
Molly blushed a bit by the rare overflow of praise coming from the detective. “Oh, yeah. I’d like that very much.” She smiled a bit.
“You’re going to freeze Sally.” Sherlock said, but still adjusted the temporary pillow under John’s head to make him as comfortable as possible.
The other yarders finally reached them, some of them having side-tracked to check on Singer in the car, though there was no way he’d have survived a crash like that. Lestrade and Sherlock were, not surprisingly, the first to reach the two. Lestrade helped Sally to her feet and held her steady, his eyes roaming over her worriedly while looking for injuries.
Lestrade was bent forward as much as his restrains allowed. A thin stream of blood spilled from his gasping mouth, down to the stone floor as he tried to catch his breath.
Sherlock and John exited Lestrade’s office in Scotland Yard, with the D.I right behind them. “Thanks to the both of you for staying all night to help me write up the case report. This went so much faster than when I do it alone.” Lestrade said with a grateful smile on his lips.
John put down the glasses and wine on the coffee table. Sherlock was already seated in the sofa. Leaning against the corner, his right arm draped over the back. His face bore an expression of reluctance as John fished out the DVD box.
John’s face contorted further, clearly with the increasing effort it took to complete the last repetitions of the set. It hadn’t escaped Sherlock’s notice how impressively many repetitions John had been able to do with that much weight on the bar.
After a few more minutes of heartfelt crying Mrs. And Mr. Hadley both got up to thank Sherlock warmly for bringing their son safely back home to them. Sherlock accepted their thanks but also informed them that Dexter was the one who’d really been responsible for looking after Charlie and had brought their boy’s need for help to his attention in the first place. The couple nodded and said they’d make sure to thank him plentifully when they’d see him again.
The other man’s head was rolling back in forth like he was very drunk while he was manhandled forward. Sluggish protests continually escaping him, though he could not form any form of coherent sentence. “Noo.. Mmm.. Wha.. Let go.. Jo..”
Sherlock didn’t even offer him a single glance, much less an answer. Anger still brewing strong, but silently under the surface.
Lestrade turned to his officers. They were all dressed in combat gear, ready to take action. “I want the entire perimeter surrounded!! No one get in or out of that building! This is a fragile situation. Our prime priority is to extract John Watson unharmed! Inside with him is a hostile, armed and highly trained sniper, engage if necessary!” he barked out. Several of the officers fanned out to surround the building as ordered.
Charlie harsh mask slowly began to peel away as his small sobs began to fill the air and fat, fresh tears started to stream down the boy’s face, but he still held his ground still not making any move to take the final step over the edge. Sherlock saw this as a good sign and very slowly approached a little further until he was right next to Charlie, but not touching him. He just kept talking;
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh a little at Charlie’s description of his lover. “Well I’m sure it’s not going to come to that anyway so lets get go knock on the door shall we?”
“These threats are not to be taken likely. I need to further research the Syndicate’s territorial reach and power positions in the city. The worst thing we can do right now is acting too rashly. We have a 48 hours deadline to work with, we’ll just have to hope Lestrade can hold out for that long.” The thought of having to leave Lestrade in that hellhole even a minute longer made Sherlock’s stomach hurt, but he did not see any other way. He turned to John; “John, what’s your assessment of his condition?”
Sherlock found the whole deal incredibly dull and boring, but answered the questions nonetheless, though in short phrased preciseness in a voice that by no means hid his lack of enthusiasm.
“I don’t want to jump..” Was he said, his voice hollow and soft. “But I don’t know if I can keep going. I don’t want to go back into the system..” his young voice broke. “I just.. Want to belong somewhere.”
“Any thoughts you’d care to share?” The detective asked with a sensual glint in his eyes. It was obvious, even for an untrained eye, that John was very much liking what he was saw.
Sherlock took one of John’s hands firmly in his own and brought it up to his lips to plant a soft kiss onto it. Normally they would never show such obvious affections in public, preferring to do so in private, but the detective just couldn’t help himself.
Sherlock returns home cold and soaked to the bone and John thinks of a nice gesture to make his boyfriend feel better
Both Mrs. And Mr. Hadley looked at each other confused before turning back to Charlie. “Sending you back? My poor boy what gave you that idea?” Mrs. Hadley asked.
John flashed him a wide smile at the suggestion. “That sound like a lovely idea Sherlock.” And that was exactly what John went to do.
And the rest of the night passed with dinner, movie and a cuddle on the sofa, the unanswered question completely forgotten again.
John accepted the items with a grateful smile and quickly swallowed the offered pills, washing them down with some tea. When the tea was gone Sherlock bent down at John’s feet and made quick work of untying and removing his shoes and then gently yet determined pushed John down to lay stretched out on the couch, ignoring John’s small words of protests and slightly confused looks.
“Would somebody please call a bloody ambulance already?!” John called out loudly, now holding on to the limp form of Sherlock Holmes in his arms.
“My God.. How could I've missed that you were still using when I moved in? I should’ve noticed, I’m a goddamn doctor. This only seem to prove how useless I really am..” John sighed and lowered his head in defeat.
Just as John had settled Sherlock onto the couch with a steaming hot cup of tea there was a knock on the door. Before John went to answer it the door swung slightly open and Mrs. Hudson peeked inside.
“Yeah well, the truth often hurt doesn’t it…” John spat, not able to contain himself. Sherlock, despite his slim body, was stronger than he looked and although John was much more muscular and stronger than Sherlock under normal circumstances, his shoulder and leg was starting to protest greatly under the stain of trying to keep the door closed. He didn't know how much longer he could keep Sherlock on the other side of the threshold.
Sherlock, however couldn’t help his eyes form widening, his mouth drying out and his heartrate elevate slightly at the sight before him. He’d spotted John, who was currently lying down, apparently in the middle of a set of bench-pressing what looked to be a fairly impressive amount of weight. John was wearing a deep green tank top he’d kept from his military days. The fabric was clinging tightly to the blonde’s torso, the front a bit damp from sweat and showing off an array of hard sculpted muscles underneath. John’s face was one of deep concentration as he lowered the heavy bar down just to the point where it made contact with his broad chest, before raising it again with a controlled exhale of air. Even from a distance Sherlock’s eyes could make out a small drop of sweat sliding down the doctor’s temple, onwards down the tan neck and rest in the hollow at the collarbone. Sherlock swallowed, not able to tear his eyes away from the display. He hadn’t even noticed how much John’s physic had changed in just the few months he’d kept to his strict training regime. John’s soft, wholly jumpers and the loose, oversized T-shirts he wears to bed had hidden the man’s sculpted body from Sherlock’s view and since they hadn’t been intimate or very close for such a long time Sherlock simply hadn’t noticed. The detective had been too caught up in his own world and mood swings to pay John’s looks much attention. Something he regretted a great deal right now..
John himself had left for the surgery for the rest of the day, before Sherlock had woken up. Now as the detective sat alone in the flat he found his mood souring slowly and the feeling itself puzzled the tall brunet. Sherlock had several categories of ‘bad moods’. There was the tedious dark cloud of boredom when he’d been without a challenging case for too long. But John and he had just solved a case ranked an eight just two days ago so that wasn’t it. There was his brooding, slightly childish sulking whenever Mycroft was annoying and getting on his nerves. Mycroft’s meddling had however decreased drastically sine he’d started dating Lestrade. Sherlock huffed at the thought, stupid Mycroft thought he was clever at hiding it, but it was obvious! Except maybe to John, but Sherlock figured Lestrade would break the news himself when ready, so he kept his mouth shut for now. There was his frantic, crawling under his skin agitation whenever his mind was racing to fast for his body to follow. Those days were the worst and by now the only times he ever got close to missing his old cocaine habits. John however had provided a brilliant substitute in most cases and luckily those days were far in between by now, though not completely gone.
“Phillip please, and I would love to.” Anderson smiled and took the seat John had previously occupied. “May I get you a refill of that drink miss Hall?” He then asked.
“If you’d just follow me this way Mr. Holmes and we’ll get your eyes tested right away. You’re of course welcome to join in if you wish to Mr. Watson” The young bespectacled woman said with a smile and led the two men into a small room in the back of the shop.
“You’re so good Daniel, such a brave man you are. Everything is going to be just fine, just keep breathing for me.”
The police and ambulance’s sirens and blinking blue lights filled the usual darkness and silence at the abandoned industrial harbour district, where Sherlock had determined the DI was being held. Mycroft’s unit together with Scotland Yard’s were in the middle of the extraction of the DI. Luckily the facility wasn’t heavily guarded. Besides Lestrade’s location Sherlock and the Yard had also been able to track down the whereabouts of the Syndicate’s top leaders where most of the organization’s security would be. Several other actions around the city was now also in progress right at this moment, to capture and shut down the entire ring. Once again Mycroft had offered the government’s full support to make it possible.
“They’re gone now Sherlock. Come let’s go ho-“ But when John turned around Sherlock were nowhere to be found. Only the tipped over trashcan lay left on the floor where Sherlock had previously been.
“Call me Sofia and yes Phillip I would love that.” She said with a smile and even placed her hand on Anderson’s forearm. John couldn’t hold back his smile as Anderson’s eyes lit up like Christmas lights. John stood up to sneak his way back to the table where Sherlock still stood with Greg. He’d just keep a low profile for the rest of the night, Sherlock would just have to deal with brining him his beers.
Greg had to admit John was a strict training partner. Not in the sense that he was rude or loud, but in the sense that he always made sure they both gave it their all. Greg couldn’t remember how many years since he’d slept so well at night. After a day on the job, followed by a workout with John, tired his body out. It was the good kind of tired though, not the kind of tired you’d get after a long, stressful workday, but the kind when all your muscles are sore after good use. Now he was  out the minute his head would touch his pillow be fast asleep.
John didn't relax in Sherlock's grip, but it was comforting. His breaths came in ragged bouts of panting as he tried to calm himself down, but to no prevail. He shook his head. "No! I shot you, but I was aiming for.... I killed you!"
“Well, as the waiter was involved there must have been some kind of special hidden door, an exit that only the staff knows about. Probably he let the body disappear through there.”
John lazily checked his pulse for any concerning signs, and he found none. Still... Now that he thought about it, what if Sherlock's fear was right? Maybe he was on the verge of dying? The thought unsettled him, and although he felt weighed down terribly by tiredness, he didn't feel comfortable falling asleep. He didn't know if he could stay awake for long, he desperately needed a bed, or the confirmation that he could indeed safely sleep. He blinked hard to make himself more aware.
Why wasn't he holding him, orrrrr near him? God he was tired. Sherlock... John flopped his arm slightly as a hint for his detective to wrap his long arms around him. His fingers brushed against the smooth skin of Sherlock's bicep. Maybe... John should, should, should......John should take the initiative and hold Sherlock. If only his body would cooperate. He sank further into the bed.
John's tone made Sherlock urgently want to do what he asked for and erased all other thoughts. He carried him to the bed and lay him down carefully (under other circumstances he might have thrown him instead). Then he followed him and climbed on him.
"I.... I can't believe that sh-she would do that, I'm her brother, I loved her...." he felt his vision grow blurry.
“Tell me where to find the man that painted the words on the wall!“, Moriarty shouted and I stumbled slightly backwards, I wavered, with pain in my head like a lightning that striked into it.
While Sherlock had rushed downstairs again to examine the crime scene, I had called an ambulance for Mrs. Hudson, the police had received several calls by anxious neighbours who had heard the explosion.
I turned around, sat up and looked at him. He had taken his hand off my shoulder where he had placed it before and returned the favor. John looked, as other people would describe it, attractive, and I wondered how the poor lighting managed that.
John let out a gasp at the strong arms snaking around his waist and turned his head around slightly to look at Sherlock. His spine shivered as Sherlock's deep baritone rumble vibrated through him, the warm breath on his ear made him suck in slightly. He felt the world turn as John was moved to face his detective, their lips met mid-turn and John couldn't help but let out a muffled chuckle. Oh it was amazing! It was like finally being able to feel, and the unrelenting inner scream for more made the world silent except for him and Sherlock. He thirsted for more, even when he couldn't. He pressed his lips harder against Sherlock's to try and relief the thirst he suddenly realised he had. It felt like he had had it for years, and it was only now that he was satisfying it. Something inside him began to growl and grow, the primitive need for sexual touch was awakening after many years of being subdued. Nobody had gotten close to unlocking it, but Sherlock made it explode open.
Johns eyes hardened slightly as he listened to the detective speak, his heart pounding as he was waiting for the next insult about how sentiment and love is for the losing side, so when Sherlock cut himself off, a surprised look ran across John's face. The male swallowed carefully as he was asked if that wasn't what he was supposed to do "Well... most people are reluctant to get out of bed and away from their partner... Every girl I have been with, we have cuddled and paid each other attention in the mornings" he grumbled, glancing away before shrugging "but if you do not want to do that, then that's fine.. we won't" he said, obvious hints of sadness in his voice. John slowly closed his eyes, trying to calm himself down before shaking his head "can we stay in a hotel tonight.... Somewhere we know Moriarty wont find us... I want... To properly relax around you Sherlock" he said, forcing himself to open his eyes to look at his other half
On the walls of the building on the other side of the road flaunted big red letters, that dissolved in direction of the floor and seemed to be written in blood:
I wouldn't keep John from his happiness. And I didn't even understand. If he could be with his wife, his pregnant wife, why would he stay here with me? That wasn't logical.
“Moriarty died as a Martyr, John. Just like Emilia Ricoletti he was part of a group that would continue his work after his death. He would always exist as an idea of perfect crime and danger in our heads, and that's also what's coming up to us. I thought I had killed every single person that stood behind him, but it seems I have overlooked a few people. And what they plan to do is pretty simple.”
"I know you're not helpless, John. You are the bravest man I know. And that's what scares me. I know you are able to fight, but what if something goes wrong? It's not only like you couldn't live without me... it's the same way the other way round...."
John poised his foot, and placed it daintily on the carpet, moving it this way and that until he deemed it in the right position. His other foot followed suite. They were quiet. John looked up at Sherlock with a devilish smile as he swung his right foot in front of his left to land back on the ground. A sly cackle escaped John's lips. He was enjoying this, but at the same time, he was also desperate for contact of the different sort.
John was the most interesting, most... beautiful something Sherlock had ever been given the chance to witness. There had never been anything that excited him more than John Watson. He didn't know how he had deserved him, but here he was, sleeping in the same bed, in his arms which fastened the detective's pulse. The way he moved when he breathed and the warmth...
Sherlock loved holding John like this, it was a miracle to him why he did, but he didn't change it. Still he was very careful and thought about every movement twice so that it wouldn't hurt John. When they were about to leave Sherlock heard John mention his shoes and he had no idea at all how he could get them or his owns. They were on the floor but he had no hand left to take them and kneeling down seemed to be too dangerous... "I'll place you in the car and then go back to get them, okay?", he whispered as he didn't want to talk too loud and cause John anymore pain.
“Uh, the.. the plan, yes. Yes of course”, he stuttered, trying to focus and blushing under John's obviously amused looks. How did he manage to knock him out of his stride?
He could walk, but the ache limited his speed. A tortoise, gradually ambling along at its own pace, that's what he was, at least, at the moment. Sherlock glided into the elevator beside him and pressed number two on the buttons. The doors shut with a slight scrape. The familiar feeling of going up settled in John's abdomen, and he leant back on the pole lining the elevator, it was cool on his spine. From the corner of his eyes, he saw Sherlock watching him with interest and affection. John couldn't stop the small smile from appearing on his face and crescendoing with a chuckle. They were like teenagers all over again. Heat rose to his cheeks and he felt himself start to blush.
John studied Sherlocks eyes for a moment, a warmth washing through his body before he quickly glancing away "Nothing, Just forget about it" he said before reaching down, Adjusting his boxers slightly which were a size too tight. He ran his fingers through his hair and he hummed "I will be back in a few moments, Make sure you are ready by the time I come out... and dont leave without me this time" he said, his voice slightly sharp with annoyance as he had been left on numerous occasions "I will be back in a few minutes" he said once more before making his way off towards his bedroom to get dressed into the best(worst in Sherlocks opinion) jumper he had, checked shirt and jeans.
“What would I need?”, Sherlock asked, turned around and grabbed the tea. He looked at John now, their eyes met each other. His flatmate looked a shade too annoyed and Sherlock narrowed his eyes to slits to figure out why. Probably he didn't like getting up this early... Sherlock sipped on his tea which actually was of great taste. It was different from that which he usually found in the morning, maybe it was because John made it. Sherlock deeply admired the small miracles John could perform. He was ordinary, but not like those ignorant people like Anderson. He could handle life in a way Sherlock would never be able to and that's why the detective was very well aware of how lost he would be without him.
He wanted to say it back, he really did, but he just couldn't. His lips wouldn't obey. He could barely talk at all and these words, they meant so much. Sherlock truly loved John, he had loved him from the very beginning, although he wouldn't have admitted it back then, but he had.
Sherlock's chest began to show as the fabric fell away from his skin, and soon his entire front was on show. For a man who never excercised, Sherlock was certainly a far cry from out of shape. His lithe body and long limbs gave him a graceful, almost unearthly look to him, and John couldn't stop himself from lying back and taking him in, from the pointed lips to the slight ripple of muscle at his stomach. He was like a piece of art sculpted by Michelangelo, and he was all his. He forgot about his own shirt, after all, he was too immersed in the pure beauty of Sherlock's physique.
"And don't think I haven't noticed that you like being commanded by such a... strong soldier”, Sherlock heard John say and blushed immediately. He knew his most guarded secret now, but if he wanted to share it with anyone, it would be John. As the soldier suggested putting on his uniform, Sherlock couldn't help but imagine it, and he couldn't get that image out of his mind anymore. It was the most attractive thing he could think of.
“Not yet, no”, Sherlock replied to John absently while his mind was working and plotting. It was brilliant! This was how they could defeat him. They had to act and not act in the end. Mix fiction and reality.
“Well, we'd have to work in the shadows, found alliances, work without technics... do anything so he doesn't find out what we're doing, but we'll know everything about him.“
Sherlock had to work hard not to seem annoyed, which he was in a way. Why did John have to make it so difficult for him? "I said that I wanted to figure what the poison was by the notes you've taken. You took notes and I could search them for useful information."
John scrunched his brow in an attempt to remember, but shook his head soon after, "I've been asleep more or less the same time as you, woken up like that as well. As for food.... I can't say I've eaten much recently, nothing except for the odd packet of crisps. And if you were used to the drug, you must've gone through a phase where you /were/ affected by it. Is that possible?"
John looked into Sherlock's eyes, and turned away with a sigh. "I know, I know. She just..." He chuckled bitterly, wiping his eye tiredly with his palm, "She just hasn't changed at all. She's manipulative and desperate and bitter that I inherit mum's wedding ring. She had her eye on that for years."
Sherlock created a timeline in front of his eyes. He noted the events that John mentioned on it. “Let's see... London was too long ago, that can't be it. When you collapsed it was already too late...“ he deleted those dates and zoomed in on the timeline.
Sherlock kept standing in the middle of the room and was very confused. Why did John suddenly interrupt the intimacy?
“I'm sorry, I didn't know that”, he replied, “It's not that I don't want to do that. I simply didn't know. And if it's a procedure that you like we can try it.”
He took a deep breath before he returned to his cold “focused-on-the-mind” self. Where had he stopped thinking? Right, right. Luring Moriarty out of the shadows.
"No, no. It was drugs. I know these things... I mean... It can't just come back. You were drugged again."
“Whatever you like, John, you are the expert after all”, Sherlock smiled while he continued to get undressed.
John glanced back at Sherlock and Lestrade, giving him a small smile before turning back towards the people around him "GET OUT" He snarled, eyes darkening before stepping forwards threateningly before closing the door behind them. John let out a breath and turned towards Sherlock and lestrade, frowning deeply as he listened to him speak "Greg? What do you mean?" He growled before rushing forwards and stepping inside the bathroom "What do you mean by there being nothing he-" johns eyes widened as he looked down at the floor, just seeing a small pile of ash "What the fuck....?" He snarled, stepping forwards before looking around the room "Where is he?!"
Sherlock got a fright when a sudden ringing sound appeared out of nowhere. He couldn't assign it at first, but then figured that it was his phone. A call. He looked at it – John! Actually it had been obvious. Another proof for how the sentiment slowed him down. Should he pick it up? He decided for the yes and wiped his tears away. He didn't want to hurt his love anymore.
John swallowed nervously, shifting from one foot to another as he waited for Sherlock to arrive at his room. His eyes lit up as he saw Sherlock making his way up the stairs and he slowly stepped forwards "Sherlock... I ...." he breathed nervously, glancing away for a moment "We need a secret location right? Where Moriarty wont come knocking yes?" He smiled, cheeks starting to darken in colour as he tried to get his words out, the male scratching the back of his neck nervously "How about my bedroom?" He asked "I mean, I keep it under lock and bolt, so I don't see how he could get inside" he smirked before stepping forwards, reaching up and taking a hold of Sherlock face, pulling him down slightly "Damn, you are so bloody tall" he laughed, studying Sherlock's eyes before running his thumb along his cheekbones "Please can this... be our 'secret location'?"
"I love you." He repeated into Sherlock's mouth, throwing his arms over the detective's back and tightening his grip.
John breathed in sharply as he felt Sherlock run his fingers through his hair, His weakness. John let out a gentle groan and shifted in closer, wrapping his arms around his neck slowly and smiling gently as he kissed the male back gently, Loving the feel of the detectives lips against his own. He slowly pulled back, allowing himself to catch his breath before glancing up into Sherlocks eyes, a grin on his lips as he studied them before pulling him back in for a kiss. John chuckled softly as he allowed his hands to slowly slip down his sides and rest on the skinny detectives hips "mine.." he grumbled against his lips, his military side and protectiveness over the detective was beginning to Show. "Mine.. All mine.." he muttered before tugging at the detectives bottom lip, fully aware that he was completely virgin and new to all of this.
I watched Sherlock sleeping... he was breathing, he was alive. I could still hear the voices, the commotion in the room. The murmurs that weren't silent enough, Donovon and Anderson talking. Lestrade in worry, like Mrs. Hudson. Still nobody rushed to him as I did.
John felt anger bubble underneath his skin, although he didn't want to shout at Sherlock, his patience was becoming strained. He was his boyfriend for gods sake, not an interrogator.
Sherlock went downstairs, got some clothes from his room and soon he stood in the shower. He didn't even know where to start. Two topics were fighting for his attention. John. Moriarty. Love. Fear. John and he had kissed, they had spent the night together. What was to follow that? Moriarty was a threat, he endangered that happiness he had found with John. What would be his next step? Questions, questions. And Sherlock helplessly caught in the middle, weak, having a pressure point. He had to do something about it. And he had to figure out what these feelings were. Of course it was love, he had worked that out quite some time ago, but it was new to him and he didn't know how well he could handle it. He had never planned on getting involved, on caring about somebody else. But in the end it was inevitable.
John felt Sherlock's gaze on him, and looked into his eyes, he was trying to say something with his body, but John was unsure of what he wanted exactly. He broke away from Sherlock's lips and laid on top of him, his lips brushing his ear.
Sherlock was surprised by the intensity John went with, although he had expected it. Still it... turned him on too and once he was being pushed against a wall he couldn't hold himself back and kissed John passionately while running his fingers through his hair again.
Lestrade looked at the two of them in shock but couldn't say a word. He stood a while in thought before he entered the restroom.
The screen turned off and we heard a huge explosion outside and below us. Mrs. Hudson! I ran downstairs to look for her at once. There was smoke everywhere, the walls all black, the curtains burning.
When John finally was there Sherlock just let everything happen. He let John hold him, and when he saw his smile he just... he couldn't help but cry because it wouldn't be okay.
Mycroft was in his office when he received the phone call. It was his private phone, but he didn't know the number that was calling him. He probably should have ignored it but he had the feeling it could have been something of importance.
No, don't think about that. Focus on the fact that you are still here, with Sherlock, don't be such a wimp!
„Stay back! You're not going to hurt him!“, I shouted in rage. I was really fierce now. He did all this to me and now he wouldn't even let John get out of this?! He could take away my everything, kill me, if it did please him, but he would keep his dirty fingers from my John!
Moriarty knew what they were doing. He knew that they had admitted their feelings for each other. He had seen what they had done. How would it simply be possible to win against him? He was a superpower, the storm at the harsh sea and Sherlock and John just a small boat that he wanted to see on the ground of the ocean.
When Sherlock had finished his shower he took his boxers and put them back on. Being close to John, falling asleep in his arms would be great, but only with this limitation. He didn't know how he should tell him that he'd prefer it if he did the same. He opened the door again and found John still laying on the bed (hell, had he always been so handsome or was it because they belonged together now?).
John bit his lip before putting his head in his hands. He scratched his eyebrow. "Do you know what poison it was?" He was coming out of his funk now, and his rational mind was returning. He was calming down.
I gave him an angry glance but got up and went to the bathroom. I had never heard him talk like this before. He was right, that was nothing new, but... this whole facing reality thing. I didn't know much about hidden meanings, but it seemed as if Sherlock felt left out. I had always known that he was more than just the mind he would present to the public, but hearing an outburst from him was very different.
Sherlock didn't feel comfortable with leaving John alone in the car, even if it was for this short of a time. He was helpless and couldn't defend himself. The perfect prey. Sherlock hurried to get inside nevertheless. Harriet surely wouldn't let him in again if she got the chance. So he hurried and got their shoes. He looked around and sighed. Would they ever return to this place? Just in case they wouldn't he decided to take a few photos of the rooms, at least the ones of the floor he was in. He didn't want to go upstairs and meet Harriet. When he was finished and carried John's shoes he left. They should never have come here in the first place... Sherlock then got into the car again. “I love you too“, he replied to John and started the engine. They had to get away from here.
They walked around a corner and could then see the River Thames. It was still possible to see where the police had taken the corpse out of the water and it would be very easy to find information here.
"We need to make him come out, make him want to play. What if, we just continue to live in Baker Street as we normally do, make him think we aren't affected by his mind tricks? Yes, I know Sherlock," John said, looking at the fear on Sherlock's face, "I know it will be dangerous, very dangerous, but if we are together constantly in the apartment then there is no way of him getting me without you witnessing it or being able to stop it. If you did see it, you could follow them or at least deduce what you can, because we both know it sure as hell won't be Moriarty doing the dirty work."
“They always do, don't they?”, Sherlock smiled back before he entered the building. He knew they did, but it was not like he cared about what the public thought. It was important to John though. He wanted to look good in the public, and he wanted the same for Sherlock. And if that's what made John happy he would take care of it. It wasn't like he would let himself get involved, but John surrounding him made him more productive, it let him feel good. So he would ensure John's well-being.
He wanted this damn thing off now, he wanted John, he wanted his skin against his own, he wanted to touch him.
As soon as John had followed me into the car he started asking me questions. Loads of questions. And although most of them were irrelevant for the case “Moriarty is back” I listened patiently to every single one of them. Not because I was interested in their content, but because I was happy on a level words couldn't even hope to describe.
John scrunched his brow up, shaking his head gently. "No, no, we may have our differences but.... Harry... Harry would never try to poison me?" He said doubtfully.
He let Sherlock take him into his arms. The tight embrace was his protection, and he pressed his head onto Sherlock's chest, trying so hard not to cry. Harriet. His sister. The one he had once made a castle for, out of old pieces of wood, day in and day out. She wanted him dead? Did the house really mean that much to her? He clung onto Sherlock's shirt.
"I... I only took a couple of mouthfuls and if my headache was the result of that, then the entire cup would've killed me..." John said quietly.
Mycroft was very well aware of the impact John had on Sherlock. And although he would have preferred to do it on his own, this was the only option to keep Sherlock safe.
Sherlock shook his head slightly “I'm not really able to eat now“. He wasn't even really able to think. Which was really bad for him. He just closed his eyes; his mind was empty now. He didn't think. He just heard the noises the car made, John's breath, his voice and other sudden sounds that appeared out of nowhere. It was an emptiness that surely wasn't healthy, but it helped him calm down, it made everything seem far away. Sherlock's reflexes would have been really bad if they had been asked to act, it was... peaceful.
Sherlock felt rigid, probably due to sitting up without back support for over half an hour. It must be uncomfortable...Maybe, if John applied gentle pressure on his chest, he might fall back onto the bed, where John could hold him better and his back wouldn't ache as much.... Then again, he didn't want Sherlock to become agitated or to freeze up. This act of kindness was not without it's cautions, anything could make Sherlock feel pressurised or anxious. He was like a 6 foot bomb, albeit an extremely handsome and gentle one. He was in a delicate state, not in a weak or emotional way, but in a way that he was testing the waters on touching John affectionately. Sherlock was watching the ripples cautiously from the windows of his mind palace, John knew he was there at the moment. The way he looked into nowhere, the slight loosening of his arm around John. These were signs that he wasn't fully in the real world. John understood, and was happy that he at least felt comfortable to be the first one to engage in contact willingly. It was small steps, small steps...
John saw Sherlock's hesitance, and eased up. "Ok, do you want to have time to think of a better plan? I know you're not keen of my idea, and I'm not overly fond of it either. I just can't think of any plan that doesn't involve one of us or one of our loved one's being in danger."
"Well of course we'll be needing a double bed", the detective said, having wanted to give this answer for so long already. He remembered like it was yesterday when Mrs. Hudson had asked if they would be needing two bedrooms. And now they'd even share a bed!
"Oh, I like the sound of that", Sherlock kept smirking and bit his lip. He left the elevator and waited in front of it just in case John would need help. This waiting was like torture. John had started a counterattack but it had been successful.
"No, if you are you're pushing me by all those feelings you give to me", Sherlock said, still out of breath and slightly trembling from excitement, "But it's a good thing. I want this now. I want you to release me."
Sherlock ran the hands over his own face and through his hair. Where was the blood? John had a point. Where was the blood...
"Not yet, that's why I asked you to take notes when you were still at the crime scene", Sherlock replied and placed his hand on John's shoulder.
John shuddered and gasped out as the male kissed along his neck, the doctor tilting his head to the side to allow the detective more room. "fuck Sherlock... Hitting all my sensitive spots" he hissed as Sherlock ran his fingers through his hair roughly, letting out a soft moan at the feeling. John reached out to pull the detective in closer, running his hands slowly down Sherlock's sides and pulling at his shirt to untuck it. The doctor let out a whimper of need when Sherlock suggested taking off his shirt, nodding in agreement before shifting into his touch, resting his head back against the wall and panting heavily "Oh god Sherlock" he whispered, feeling his shirt open fully and John quickly wiggled it off his shoulders, standing half naked in front of Sherlock "Teas-" John paused, breath catching in his throat when he heard the bathroom door open, a young male walking in to use the urinals
"You left because it was best for you, it was Harry's fault, may I remind you, that you left. If you hadn't, you wouldn't have had this thrilling new life, you wouldn't have fought for this country, and you most certainly wouldn't have met this fine gentleman standing in front of me." She said, looking over to a Sherlock who gave her an embarrassed nod. "And although Harry says that she stayed here to look after me, she really stayed because she couldn't get on with her life, she couldn't leave, she doesn't even look after me, only the occasional meal and help up the stairs, but I might as well be living on my own." She said, eyes fixed on John.
"Someone's eager..." John chuckled, feeling the slight bulge pressing against the inside of his thigh.
John felt Sherlock smile on his shoulder, and equally found one growing on his face. If he could hold Sherlock even tighter he would, but it seemed however tight he held him, it would never be enough. It was like his heart wanted to connect with Sherlock's, pulling John towards it. John felt a warm love inside his pulling heart, that spread to his fingers, and it told him that they could defeat anything that got in their way, whatever form it came in, they could tackle it.
“Uhm, Sherlock?”, he said from inside hesitatingly, “There's nothing here but a small heap of ash...”
I didn't comment on what Anderson said this time, I didn't even really listen. Anderson: Boring. The case: VERY exciting! So many questions I couldn't answer yet, so many clues yet to find, so many riddles to solve.
"Don't speak, please...", Sherlock said and knelled down next to John again, offering himself as a pillow, "I'm sure you're not strong enough for that now." The detective put his hand on his own face then, as he looked at his fingers he could see the blood from Harriet's scratches. He sighed in annoyance of her. "Listen, we maybe should get you into a hospital. Although I think that might not be a good idea as Moriarty could be coming at us then... but you need a doctor, and you know very well that I... I can't.."
It was quite interesting how he was focusing only on that one topic anymore. Maybe that was why people missed so many important details? But Sherlock could understand their excitement. He had deeply enjoyed what John and he had shared until now and he expected their future interactions to be even more enjoyable.
Hopefully John wouldn't react as he had feared... hopefully he would stay at his side... Sherlock couldn't stand John being mad at him... or even worse – losing him. And hopefully he wouldn't find out that he had been the reason Sherlock had to anaesthetise himself...
These words had been really difficult for the detective, but in the end he was glad that he had said them. He looked down now, not able to meet John's view, as he had never been more honest in his life and he felt exposed.
Sherlock took a deep breath before he entered the apartment. He didn't know what would await him in there and it scared him. He even feared that John could have collected the things that were the most important to him and had left... For god's sake, that had been exactly what Sherlock had wanted! So why couldn't he simply accept it?
He punched her in the face and pushed her on the floor. This was enough. Leaving women alone or not, honour or whatever, she had none of that. "HE IS BETTER THAN YOU'LL EVER BE!", Sherlock shouted as he attempted to hit her again, "You should care, for look at what you are! A goddamn fucking whore, laying on the couch all day with her vulgar programs and her alcohol! He cares about people, and you just are a dirty piece of shit. If he didn't care about you I swear, I'd do so much worse!"
John raised an eyebrow in shock when he listened to the detective flirt with him, his smirk turning into a massive grin and he reached forwards, grabbing Sherlock's shirt and pulling him in close so he could whisper into his ear "if you aren't careful, I will punish you in that bathroom" he growled into his ear before slowly licking along his earlobe. John hummed softly and slowly pulled back, leaning against the back of the chair again "mmm... I will have to get on my military uniform... I know you have gotten it out before... Quite a few times actually" he teased before licking his lips "someone got a military kink?"
"It's fine. You're trying." John said tiredly, filling the cup again. He didn't drink anymore, it was probably just something to keep his mind on, the filling of the cup.
The detective looked at the smaller male next to him, glad that he asked about the elevator. Hadn't there been one, well... but there was. He carefully started to walk John the direction the woman, unnecessary to remember her name, had described. He didn't really like her, what was that caused by? Probably the way she thought of herself, how few interest she showed in others... "John, is that how people see me?", Sherlock asked when they had walked a bit already and the receptionist couldn't hear them anymore.
Sherlock slept tight and well and it was only when he felt John being ripped from his arms that he woke up. "John?", he opened his eyes immediately, ready to fight if there was someone attacking them.
Tears distorted his view and he entered into a blurred world, but he still knew where his detective sat, shroud in black with a strip of blue down the middle.
He let out a wracking sob and pursed his lips closed. Where pain had once raged within his head, only lightness and dizziness lay within. John inched his eyes open and looked up at where he thought Sherlock's face to be. He could've collapsed with relief as his world focused and beans coloured. Yes, he was still dizzy, and his vision was a bit blurred, but it was better than being blind. The birds outside sang without a care, oblivious to the brush of death John had just experienced. John gripped onto Sherlock's shirt and pulled him closer so he could rest his head against Sherlock's warm body.
“Bloody hell! You idiot!!” Sherlock bellowed and quickly grasped his phone to save it from the pool of beer it was laying in. He quickly turned around to the other side on his right and fished a handful of napkins from a nearby table to dry off the worst of the ale before his phone would take permanent damage. It was almost brand new too! His old phone had been sacrificed on a case a few weeks earlier when it’d dropped out of his pocket to the pavement, as he and John had leaped over a fence in pursuit of a suspect. It was the newest model and he’d had finally gotten it set up perfectly to his liking. Sherlock dried it off as best as he could and turned on the screen, looking it over to see if it had suffered any damage at all and if it was still fully functional. It seemed like it had survived without any consequences, except having gotten a bit sticky.
“Hey, where did Sherlock go? I haven’t seen him in a while.” John asked out loud and turned around, visually scanning the room for his tall boyfriend.
And while it was mostly Lestrade’s accomplishment that he’d gotten clean in the first place, Sherlock had never known true peace or happiness.. Not until John Watson had entered his life. John had managed to crack his carefully crafted, fortified walls within the first 24 hours of knowing him. In that time the doctor had praised him more than anyone had ever done in his entire life, called him brilliant and amazing and not out of some misguided impression or false social dictation, but really meaning it. He’d even gone as far as kill a man for him when his life had been threatened and not feeling a shadow of regret afterwards. So deep was his conviction of how much Sherlock’s life was worth within hours of knowing him.
Sherlock did as he was told and took a seat at the sergeant’s desk and eyed the monitor. The video file open at the screen ready to be played. John and Sally stood at each side of the chair to look over his shoulder. John’s arms were crossed, his face one of pinched calmness, but his eyes burning with rage towards the bastards who was keeping his mate. Sally was biting her thumbnail, a nervous habit she’d always kept in the years Sherlock had known her. She’d seen the video several times already of course, but that didn’t keep the unpleasant and upset look of her face, visibly not looking forward to watching it again.
John let out a low pleasured groan and allowed his head to fall forwards as Sherlock worked his stiff shoulder, also releasing some of the pent up tension from the day, in which Sherlock had been(not surprisingly) correct in his every deduction, loving every caring, comforting, lovingly caress of those wonderfully slender and strong fingers.
“Okay, who the hell is the bloody idiot who has stolen all my damn pens during lunch?! You think this is a fucking playground. I want the one responsible to come forward right now!” As she howled she turned, fitting everyone with a hard glare as if she could copy Sherlock and deduce who the culprit was if she first made eyecontact.
“Excuse me?” He huffed out half with laughter and the other half in disbelief for being interrupted before he’d hardly started talking.
Lestrade repeated the action, harder this time. “ANSWER ME! What did you slip him?!” The DI roared this time.
Since Lestrade was still out of commission, recovering from his kidnapping, Donovan had taken temporary command of the division. Sherlock, not willing to admit it out loud to anyone else still felt guilty Lestrade suffered in an effort to protect him from his past. So, the detective had taken it upon himself to offer as much help he could by solving as many of the cold cases as possible (even the boring ones) and assisting lightly in a few ongoing cases, despite them also being far under his level of interest, but he figured he owed the DI that much. Still he didn’t stay for pleasantries and hurried down to return the evidence he’d used to successfully deduce and solve another two cold cases. He’d hand in his reports on his findings to Donovan on the way out.
Charlie simply nodded and sprinted off in the direction he’d come from, John right on his heels. Only one thing playing in the doctor’s mind.
John could hear the distinct sound of heavy military boots as they stomped down the iron stairs in a rapid pace.
“’We’ huh? Liking what you see love?” John rumbled in his deep voice, just loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
“Indeed, really.. Wow Mrs. Hudson, that’s so thoughtful I don’t even know how to thank you enough.” John Said gratefully with a soft smile on his lips.
“Sure thing, mate.” The man said and then lifted his own still half full beer in salute. “And cheers.” He followed up.
“Fuck!” Mycroft muttered and John idly thought that this might be the first time he’s ever heard Mycroft utter a curse word. He quickly dismissed the thought though and shifted his focus to their current situation.
Besides them Lestrade growled dangerously and very roughly grasped the collar of the attacker’s jacket to heave him up a bit only to slam him back into the ground. “You bastard!! What the hell did you slip him?” He yelled angrily into his face.
If anything positive was to come of this, it was that Singer obliviously committed crimes of passion with very little thought involved. He would simply drive around in London’s less busy streets and whenever he stumbled upon a potential victim, he’d ram them down with his car at full speed and then flee the scene. This messy and coarse method had made it almost embarrassingly easy for Sherlock and the yard to track him and collect a massive mountain of evidence against him, to make sure he’d spend the rest of life in prison. In truth, Lestrade and his team would no doubt have been able to crack this case on their own, but since Singer seemed to be in a hurry, Sherlock and John had joined the case in the hopes it would speed things up before the psycho decided to kill yet again.
“Better?” Sherlock whispered from somewhere above, never stopping the caress of his hands through John’s soft hair.
much better together. They need each other to survive! Frodo should know.. He should know that all Sam has ever don have been to help and protect him. How can he not see that?” Sherlock ended his small rant with a hoarse mutter. His eyes cloudy with sadness, doubt and confusion.
“We have to get to the emergency exit located in the other end of the room, staying here will make us sitting ducks.” John explained in a low voice.
They stood there for long minutes, just basking in relief and gratitude that they still had each other. Finally John pulled away slightly and pulled Sherlock with him all the way inside of the room. He’d already paid for the night so they might as well make the best of it. Besides neither of them really felt like making their way back to Baker St. this late at night. It would be impossible to even get a cap anyway and the need for sleep was quickly becoming more essential. John did however make a mental note to call Lestrade in the morning and thank him.. For everything he ever did.. Unknown to John, Sherlock did exactly the same.
John didn’t know what to say to make Sherlock understand. But it didn’t really matte, Sherlock could tell what John meant even without hearing the man voice his reasons.
The reception, where he’d entered was located as a top floor in the gym. A walkway was going all the way around the room, with several stairs leading down to the actual fitness facilities. This gave Sherlock the great advantage that he actually had a complete overview of the area and should be able to localise John fairly easily form above.
Mycroft’s eyes widened and even as John was still talking he started shaking his head. “No John I can’t let you do that. I can’t..” He said strongly, but John continued.
“Did you get injured? Anything bruised or fractured?” John asked, his voice portraying a fair share of concern.
!” He answered exasperated and shoved his phone back into his pocket to protect it from further trauma in this moron’s presents.
“I thought that phrase was limited to describe my deduction skills.” Sherlock chuckled, his hands never stopping their work.
Jackson chewed his bottom lip in thought for a moment before answering. “Yeah.. And I think I know just how to do it.”
“Want me to go with you?” Lestrade asked tentatively after the receptionist had informed them of the room number for John Watson.
John mirrored his smile. “That’s great, I’m glad to hear that! You deserve it.” John said happily. Glad Anderson seemed to finally have found happiness. It’d surely shown in his work on how much more positive and confident he’d become.
“What the hell is this now?” Ethan exclaimed frustrated, as the files slid around like an avalanche covering his entire desk area.
“What about Sherlock?” John asked in a tired voice, really not in the mood to play the other man’s game, but having little choice.
As the very last word had escaped Sherlock’s mouth he closed the last distance between them and planted a sweet kiss on John’s lips. It wasn't demanding or pushy, just a soft and simple press of soft lips pressed against each other, unhurried and reassuring, but it still filled John with a warmth and love so incomparable that it felt like taking the first grasp of air after nearly drowning in icy water. Slowly and without, breaking their kiss, John slid his hands up Sherlock’s shoulders, caressing the long elegant neck and then into soft curls pulling them just a little closer. Sherlock responded by letting his arms wrap around John’s middle allowing them to press fully against each other’s bodies. When they at last parted John buried his head deeply into the hollow of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder and let out a long shuttering sigh of both relief and emotionally exhaustion.
Sherlock shivered slightly in delight at the delicate behind his ear. His bespectacled eyes never leaving John’s face.
Sherlock took another deep breath, steeled himself and pressed play. As the screen came to life he concentrated his entire focus to pick up each end every detail of the room and of the people that he could gather.
Greg cringed. “No, no we got him alright.” He said ruefully, causing John to look at him with confusion.
But as the door slowly swung open John wasn't met by the tall silver haired man as he’d expected. Instead he was faced with the sight of mesmerizing eyes, sharp cheekbones and curly auburn hair. Traits he would recognize immediately anywhere.
Sherlock held Charlie’s gaze and steadily answered. “Tell you what, if that really should be the case, I’ll make sure that you can come and live with me and John.”
“I promise John, I promise never again!” Sherlock quickly agreed and pressed several more kisses to the top of John’s head while gently rubbing the tense back under his hands in warm shooting circles, mindful of his injured shoulder.
John had to swallow the lump in his throat at hearing Sherlock’s desperate please. In his drugged out state fearing John would misunderstand the situation and think Sherlock had gotten high on his own and then snuck off with this man willingly.
Sherlock offered her a forgiving smile. “That’s quite alright Mrs. Hudson they can come up. Why don’t you join us too? John just made tea.” Sherlock offered. It was clear Mrs. Hudson was awfully distressed by the news of Sherlock’s hospitalization and the cause of it. When they’d entered 221 she’d come out to greet them as usual, trying to maintain her usual cheerfulness and suppressing her urge to fuss over Sherlock like a mother hen, afraid it’d be unwelcome.
“My God Sherlock! Sweetheart are you alright? No sorry, sorry of course you aren’t, that was a stupid question. But its okay, its okay I’m here.” John consoled the best he could. He had no idea what could have upset his lover to such an extend, that it would bring him to tears.
“Wise man.” He replied. Suddenly John’s eyes lit up as if he’d been struck with a moment of genius. “Listen mate! Why don’t you join me in the gym? They have this huge space with padded floors no one hardly uses. I could teach you some techniques, help you build up some core and upper body strength. You’ll be taking down bad guys left and right when I’m done with you I promise.” John said enthusiastically, his grin growing bigger and bigger.
Btw it IS actually REAL the nailpolish that change colour when exposed to date rape drugs and I think that is AWESOME! It’s been invented by four undergrad engineering students. How cool is that?! Unfortunately, it’s not yet on the market as I understand. For this story I however allowed Molly to be the inventor of it, but here’s a link to a YouTube video explaining the invention if you’d like:
Sherlock returned the smile and did a few stretches of his arms as well. His blazer laying on the back of his chair and shirt sleeves rolled up above his elbows, having given up his usually put together look for comfort halfway through the night and his curly hair a ruffled mess from running his fingers through it several times. “It was no problem really. Better use of my time than football with John and his Arsenal fanclub of friends.” He answered.
“Knew you’d figure it out Sherlock.. Knew you’d find me.. Never doubted…” He rasped out, coughing a bit from the stain of speaking, grimacing in pain as the action aggravated his broken ribs.
Red at the tip of his nose and under both eyes – Sherlock had been blowing his nose and tried to dry his tears recently. Properly in an effort to hide the fact from John but even John wasn’t this blind.
“And what do you do?! You tackle me to the ground and then pins me down!! That was my only chance to catch him and then you go and ruin it all!! Why John?!!” Sherlock roared angrily.
Sherlock went back to re-examining the room and John moved aside as Anderson and his crew moved over to bag the body and transfer it to the coroners for further examination.
Sherlock wrapped his own arms tightly around his doctor and placed a small kiss under John’s jaw. “Not now, I’ll tell you about it in the morning.” He answered faintly.
The man’s smirk widened. “I’m sorry love, but it’s hard not to go for it you when you stand there and flaunt your stuff so temptingly.” He said, giving the detective the escalator look up and down hungrily.
Back in Bakerstreet Sherlock had lit up the fireplace, the flames and a small lamp by the couch the only things lightning up the room, bathing it in a soft glow.
John climbed into the backseat of Greg’s patrol car and pulled the blankets tighter around himself in an attempt to ward off the cold, but just as he was about to close the door a hand on the doorframe stopped him from doing so. John looked up and found Mycroft looking down at him with a rare look of sheer gratitude evident on his face.
A silence fell over the room, so thick what you’d been able to hear a pin drop as its occupants tried to understand how such awful words could ever be spewed by anyone about a man as good as John Watson.
"Soon love, first let's get you out of these wet clothes and into the hot shower. Meanwhile I'll make your tea and order some chinese, how does that sound?" John asked with a smile and fondness in his voice.
“Yes you can Sally, just listen to me and do as I say. First sit down on the floor.” Sherlock started to dig through his pockets at the telltale sound of Sally slowly sliding down to the floor. Sherlock kneeled down at the floor himself so he was at eyelevel with the lock as he kept rummaging through his many pockets, he knew he had it on him somewhere. “Good, now put your head between your knees and take as deep an inhalation as you can.” The detective mimicked the action too as he listened carefully to Sally’s slightly more raggedy breath. “Very good Sally and out.” Again Sherlock followed by example, hearing Sally follow as best as she could behind the door. Finally he found what he was looking for in his blazers inner chest pocket, his lockpick set! “You’re doing fine, now keep it up. I’ll have you out soon, promise.” He assured her once again as he began working the lock with deep concentration. Sally whimpered weakly as she tried to keep up the calming breathing pattern but finding it hard.
you only brought me here with his best interests in heart, because of your concern and love for him. But I promise you, that I'll
To John’s great delight he saw Sherlock’s face light up with the biggest, most brilliant and sincerest smile the man was capable of. A feat John, until now, had prided himself with being the only one able to draw out of the detective.
John was happy to oblige, delighted at the prospect of fulfilling his fireplace fantasy faster than he’d expected.
Sherlock’s only response was to turn his head and glaring eyes further away from John and continuing his silence in an attempt to completely ignore the doctor’s presence.
Charlie is a troubled young boy in the homeless network. Sherlock comes to his aid when the boy needs it the most
“What’s wrong?! Mrs. Hudson, you’re the one to have collapsed on the floor! Are you alright? Does anything hurt? Any headache, dizziness? Do you know what day it is today?” Sherlock rambled, his heart still hammering away in his chest, his arms still supporting his landlady’s back and head still afraid she might feel faint once more.
Ethan was steadily turning a rather alarming shade of red before he turned around to storm out the door. “Fuck this shit! I’m going back to the office. This is a freaking madhouse!” He yelled as he disappeared down the stairs.
“Sherlock dear? What’s wrong?” She asks bemused as her eyes slowly regains some clarity and moves to sit up straighter by her own.
In the distance sirens could be heard, getting closer and closer to their destination. As the ambulance loaded John into the back, Sherlock following right after, Sally promised herself that she would change for the better. After tonight she owed at least John that much.
“We’re going to the bedroom right now and you’re not taking those off until I tell you that you can.” John commanded in his famous captain-voice, well-knowing what it did to Sherlock.
The doctor started to angrily march towards the building he’d been directed to. He entered a large room filled with rusty machinery and assembly lines. In the centre of it all stood Mycroft, looking as smug and proper with his three-piece suit and casually leaning on his slender umbrella, as always.
Curious, John abandoned the groceries and wine in the hallway and went to inspect further. He knocked on the front door leading in to the landlady. He didn’t want to just barge in if she was having visitors, but no answer came. He could however hear the muffled sound of laughing. John couldn’t supress a smile, though it wasn’t common he would be able to recognise Sherlock’s laugh anywhere.
Right behind was Anderson. He looked just as prude and displeased as he always did when Sherlock was around.
John glanced over at Sherlock who was deep in conversation with Lestrade. Sherlock had been tipped off from his homeless network, that Singer had been spotted hanging around the abandoned theatre, treating it as his temporary base. An easy location to hide himself and his car. The entire division, along with John and Sherlock, had stormed the place, hoping to apprehend the man. Unfortunately the place was completely empty and all they managed were to scare a few doves. Now the detective and DI were brainstorming, trying to come up with a new course of action.
“Oh shit I’m so sorry! Is it okay? It was an accident I swear!” The man uttered apologetically and reached over in offer to inspect the phone for damage himself.
Mr. Hadley however took a hold of Charlie’s chin and lifted it up so he could look him in the eyes with a serious yet gentle look. “No Charlie of course we’re not giving you up, never! On the contrary my boy.” Mrs. Hadley cupped her hands around Charlie’s face, stroking the thumbs gently across his tearsteaked cheeks as she continued; “We’ve been arranging for adoption papers Charlie. We want nothing more than for you to become a fully member of our family and Mrs. Clare, your caseworker, has been helping us to get things settled. We didn’t want to tell you until everything was in order though.” Mr. Hadley spoke again; “That is if you want to of course Charlie, but we’d love to have you as our son.”
“Oh John, don’t be stupid.. These tears aren’t a sign of you being weak.. It’s simply a sign that you’ve been strong for too long…” Sherlock whispered into his lover's ear and tightened his hold around him further.
“So, you never told me your name.” The man said in some social dictated attempt to make small talk while they waited.
“I know that, but now you look the part to. Come on love say something clever.” John said his eyes glinting.
Sherlock and John’s relationship was still only about three weeks old, having finally realized that their shared connection had been so much deeper than just friendship, but they had decided to keep it a secret for now.  Some people probably wouldn’t be surprised by their relationship at all, seeing as so many already assumed they were dating (which was true now of course), but other’s might look upon their relationship disapprovingly and with contempt (really, too many homophobes inhabited this world). unfortunately Sally and Anderson were without a doubt two of those people who would strongly dislike the thought of them together. Most likely because they had the idea that Sherlock was nothing more than a heartless robot, incapable of love, which definitely was the biggest lie of the century according to John. True Sherlock had had problems identifying the feelings he had felt towards John because he had never felt anything like it before. But once Sherlock had identified his feelings and John had admitted to himself that he might not be as straight as he thought himself to be – Sherlock had proved to be nothing short of an amazing boyfriend and lover, passionate, protective, gentle and caring. Of course he still had his occasional mood swings, but John hadn’t expected anything less. Sherlock made him feel loved and wanted. Something he hadn’t felt for a long, long time.
“Oh Sherlock, you’re impossible.” She sighed in feigned dismay, hiding a small smile behind her hand. “But alright dear. I suppose I wouldn’t mind a helping hand for a few things.” She surrendered.
Sherlock exited the shower feeling much better, but still able to feel the cold which had settled for the night deep in his bones and making him shiver as the stepped out from the hot sprays into the chilled room. Wanting to get dry and warm he quickly reached for the towel John had been kind enough to lay out for him and wrapped it around his shoulders. But as he did this he found the towel to be surprisingly warm and comfortable, making the chill in the room feel much more bearable. He pulled the soft fabric tighter around himself, enjoying the warmth he received from.“God, I have the greatest boyfriend in the entire world!” Was Sherlock's only thought as he stood, Just enjoying the wondrous feeling a little while longer.
“I’m afraid of what might happen if you someday should decide, that my brother no longer fulfil your sentimental needs and you chose to exclude him from your life, for good.” Mycroft said in an ice-cold voice.
Sherlock and Sally both looked down at John at said in choir. “Shut up John.” But their voices too held a slight humours tone to it.
Sherlock nodded in understanding and very, very gently started to draw soft circular patterns with his thumbs on the cramped and rock hard muscles John had pointed out being the main causes of his current agony. First after about 10 minutes of doing this did Sherlock dare to increase the pressure a bit, not wanting to cause John any pain again, relieved when he heard John let out a soft, pleased hum and not a pained gasp at the action. Sherlock continued this pattern, only increasing the pressure of his fingers when he was absolute sure it would not hurt John to do so.
“Mycroft it’s the only way. I’m military trained, you’re not. I can take care of myself. When you get out of here call Greg Lestrade for help and have him bring backup.” John pulled out the gun Mycroft had handed him earlier. “I only have 6 bullets to hold this guy off with, so have them hurry though.”
John kept scanning their surroundings. They could see the exit only a few yards ahead of them, but the last stretch to their freedom was completely bare and offered no protection whatsoever. John stomach fell as he realized there was no way they’d make it. At least not both of them…
Sherlock didn't answer, but simply tightened his hold around the doctor a little further before continuing:
John swallowed before lifted his right hand. His thump gently caressed along the prominent cheekbone before his fingers made their way to the black frame itself and followed one of the temple arms all the way from the front to the curve behind the ear.
“John I’m sorry God I’m so, so sorry.. I know I’m the last person on earth you want to see right now.. I know I have no right to even be in your presence, but please! I know what I did was unforgivable and I understand if you never do forgive me, but I need you to know how sorry I am.. I always swore to myself that you were the one person I would never hurt, that I would do everything in my power to protect and cherish you and I failed…”
But, as mentioned earlier, Sherlock wasn’t here and the pain in John’s shoulder had by now grown into full blown agony. John sat and the couch in the living room and breathed sharply through his gritted teeth, as it was all he could do to try and work himself through the pain, while desperately trying to ignore the flashing images of his screaming and dying comrades in his head. In his haze of pain and agony he didn’t even hear the light footsteps ascending the stairs or the slight creak of the door as it was opened.
Sherlock’s smile grew and he couldn’t stop the warm feeling spreading in his chest at the sight. With one last caress across the tan cheek and a quick kiss to the temple he whispered;
“What makes you think they’re going to give up on you Charlie?” Sherlock asked softly, realizing it might be a sore subject for the young boy to approach, but he needed more information in order to help him.
But Sherlock merely snorted in dismay and let out a short taunting laugh which only fueled John’s anger even more.
“Great, that’s great.” Molly said in an attempted cheerful voice, but shifted her gaze to her lap clearly trying to hide her disappointment.
John thought to himself and stepped a tad closer, his hands lowering from Sherlock’s face to gently rest on each of the detective’s sides. He made sure not to go too low and still kept his hands in a respectful height, but low enough to make his intension clear. “Yes, I do.. I think Frodo loved Sam from the moment he saw him, but always been too scared to ruin their friendship to act on it.”
“Never! Frodo would never do that and no one will ever convince him otherwise.” John said with a confident voice as his heart hammered away in his chest. Was this really happening?
John froze on the spot, a tight knot in his belly forming quickly. He could count on one hand how many times Sherlock Holmes had cried and all of those times were when he was acting to gain whatever information he wanted at the moment. But there was no doubt in John’s mind. Sherlock was definitely crying. Without any further thought John rushed to the kitchen still with one shoe left on. When he entered he found Sherlock bend slightly over the countertop appearing to be reading a book. When the doctor entered Sherlock looked up and into John’s eyes.
Sherlock made his way to the gym he knew John frequented since it was so close to the flat, only 5 minutes’ walk away.
“Aw come on Sherlock, you have to admit that even you were almost at a lost when that necklace wasn’t in the safe.”
“Because of my history with cocaine abuse.” Sherlock finished himself, a stone forming in his stomach. Could he have prevented this if Lestrade hadn’t tried to protect him from relapsing? Since John’s entrance into his life his danger nights had gotten much farther between, but yes sometimes he could still be tempted when the noise and activity in his head would threaten to overwhelm him. but he’d been clean for 5 years now and John had helped him develop alternative outlets for his hyperactive mind. Sherlock couldn’t blame Lestrade though. Before John it had been Lestrade who’d fought to keep him sober. The DI had tried to keep Sherlock’s mind busy with as many cases he could offer, but if the puzzles turned out to be so simple to satisfy him he’d always turned back to cocaine.
John took a long sip from his beer and let his eyes roam around the bar. Everybody seemed to have a good time. That was until his eyes landed on Anderson, who stood more or less for himself in a quiet corner, looking moody and glum. It didn’t take long before John found the source of the forensics bad mood. A few tables over Sally was sitting with officer Ian Jensen, one of the younger men on the force. John had heard the rumours that Sally had dumped Anderson for another man on the team, but now it would seem the rumours spoke true. Ian had his arm wrapped snugly around the lieutenant’s waist, almost pulling her into his lap. Sally responded by giggling like a love stuck teenage girl.
Dexter let out a huff. “Not entirely, but from what I could gather something about a conversation he overheard at home. Whatever it is it’s gotten him really upset.”
After about five minutes Sherlock finally managed to work the lock open. He’d only managed to open it a fraction before Sally bolted out of the room and straight into his arms, clinging to him as if he was a lifeline, sobbing into his neck. Sherlock was taken aback at first. If someone had asked him who’d be the last person in the world to ever embrace him, Sally Donovan would have been pretty high on that list. But as fate would have it, he was actually not a stranger dealing with someone suffering a panic attack. It’s human nature to seek comfort and protection when faced with danger and Sally’s systems is clearly running all the red warning lights still. So he did what everyone else would do and wrapped his arms protectively around the small frame and simply allowed her to calm down in her own time. He even went as far as stroking her lightly on the back and make a soothing noise as her tears continued to fall.
MacPherson merely licked his stuffed elk, and waited for Sherlock to come home. John hoped that the flurry of indigent messages from Mycroft were distracting her from the insertion process. At the very least, it would give her a puzzle to focus upon as they measured and a relative to insult as they inserted it. Annoying Mycroft, it was clear, was a panacea for many ills and pains.
Fourteen. Fifteen. Finally, John got so tired of hearing them bicker at each other than he stamped his feet, rigid and insistent. He had to do something before his brain melted. He had to do something before he irrationally stuck up for the posh git.
“Our Sherly graduated Newham at 16 with a first, did her graduate studies, went to Vienna, spent time in New York, don’t mention it, she hated that city, and came home.” The Holmes father was so proud. John could hear it in his voice,  “She was let go from her research post for becoming too involved, shall we say? The rest is hers to tell, but I’ll see that you get a file. School records, hospital reports, etc. etc. etc.”
Family was everything to Sherlock. MacPherson was family. Therefore MacPherson was everything to Sherlock. In that moment, he knew that his life had changed for the better the moment he had begun to scurry like a sewer rat through the drainage tunnel. He knew that there was nothing he would not do for that dog, who crawled into his lap at the animal hospital like a lapdog and who looked at Sherlock with open adoration.
John glanced upwards, noting that one of the CCTV cameras was on the fritz. Oh, well, if he had some kind of tail, at least that would make life more interesting. Who knew? Maybe James was right, and adventure was right around the corner.
As he stepped up on the pavement, he brushed off his shirt, Tim Tam crumbs still evident. “Was that necessary?”
“Mummy and Father mean well, but…” Greg followed John out across the courtyard, his voice almost inaudible, “Never let it be said that being the genius children of an MI-6 agent and a celebrated academic was a walk in the park, John.”
John was a nanosecond from grabbing the door and reaching for his gun when the door flew open and a woman stood in the doorway as the door hit the wall.
“Well, I…” The student from Manchester trying to see something of the world on her gap year was trying to ring up a ticket and remember that table four wanted water and table six had a gluten allergy, “I don’t know that we have any. I mean, I do, in my apron, but…”
John had a plan. He had several plans. He had the means. He had the resolve. He would hate her for sharing his vulnerability with the world, but she cared not, so long as he was alive to do it. A long time ago, she had desired nothing more than his friendship. Then, and then, she had wanted his happiness. Now, all she wanted was for him to be alive. Not for her, but for himself. Damn the consequences.
John tried to sweeten the offer with a bit more detail. “Well, we could do dinner afterwards, if you like.”
Dr. 1980’s-big-collar-floral-dress made a strangled noise. Lucy smiled at her, glad to know that if she had some kind of fit, there was a roomful of doctors to assist her. Not Lucy, naturally, but someone, surely.
John nodded slowly. This was not a time to hedge their bets. Mr. Macon would never get the cash, but the sooner they could move this along, the sooner MacPherson was home. John decided that if he wanted to roll in cow pats every day of his life, they’d figure out how to build a farmyard in central London.
Over their tramp through the words and through the brambles where the pheasants would hide, Greg had read a great deal into John’s tiredness, his reliance on coffee instead of sleep, and his unfashionably early departure from the party on the arm of the world’s foremost expert on the science of deduction. “Of course he does, just not for fun.”
One of the vet techs that wasn’t preoccupied tending to the dog looked at him, “Sir, I’m going to have to ask you and your wife to exit the, uh, pipe. We’ll need to bring your dog up for treatment and transfer.”
“Look...” John sighed, “Before you haul me off to some warehouse, try and chain my hands to a table, and try to make me listen to Barney for a few weeks, you should know that I never took the job, and I am not going to take it. If you want somebody to track her movements for you, pay someone else.”
“Nan’s lonely.” Harry admitted. Gramps had died while he was in Afghanistan, a sudden stroke no one could have predicted or prevented. He’d wanted to die like that, and John was glad he’d never once suffered in dying as he had watched his daughter suffer, “She’d love to see you going home to the farm.”
Pete stuck a fork in his steak and ale pie. Just the thought of something that heavy turned John’s stomach. They were having good food, lately, or better than usual. John had seen the higher-ups escorting a man with an umbrella around the barracks, past postings, through the buildings. He was likely behind the good showing that was going on around here.
On the walk back to the hotel, she texted Mycroft. Needs must, and the kevlar vests soldiers in the field were receiving were subpar, and John, even though he was here on some act of espionage at great risk to his person, was more concerned about better kevlar and injury prevention for the young men and women he worked with in he field. Sherlock had no personal investment in their welfare, and was more concerned about John’s own protection. However, she understood that any member of the armed forces wellness and survival meant a great deal to Great Britain as a whole. That was her rationale to Piecroft, for it was as sound and as commendable as anything.
“It’s over, Greg, and we’re all okay.” John told Greg what he knew Sherlock had intended him to impart when she’d insisted upon this topic of discussion. He knew that she had asked him to talk about this with Greg for the simple reason that he would, and could, help Greg lay some demons to rest, “You’re not back there.”
John took in the lines on her face, and knew that this announcement distressed her. John decided in a split second to make this easy on her. Sarah did not deserve to shoulder the burden of people coming here, making appointments, and then keeping them for non-medical reasons. Sarah had done a lot to accommodate him, and he would ask no more of her.
John felt her grin against him as he reached for the hem of her entirely extraneous camisole. “Someone who didn’t know the earth goes round the sun should not be quite so smug.”
John had made sure to stack Sherlock’s plate high with scrambled eggs, bacon, beans and toast and had then watched with fondness as the detective dug into his meal with vigor. Sherlock had even, willingly, helped with the dishes afterwards which John knew was Sherlock’s silent way of saying ‘Thank you’.
Greg leans forward once again, fiddling a bit with his half full pint. “Three days ago I joined in on a surveillance of a man we believe have been involved in a few gang related killings in London. He exited the bar and got into a brawl with a civil right outside and we saw this as our chance to arrest him with legal cause, hoping we’d be able to work him over at the station to link him to the killings.”
“No, no Sherlock love, I know! I’m the one who’s sorry! Shhh, don’t apologize.” John tried to comfort as best as he could.
definitively gay and I do love John. I understand this might not be what you wanted to hear, but you deserve someone much better than me at any rate. I promise to do you better and I hope you know you’re always welcome to ask me for my help whenever you need it as well as I hope to still count on your help with cases now and then.” Sherlock ended, hoping this was a kind enough way to tell the truth.
John nodded. He still couldn’t be absolute certain, but it was a well based theory and the best he had to go on for now until the ambulance would arrive. John looked over to Sherlock, who’d stayed silent during the whole ordeal, but it was clear he wasn’t unaffected, his eyes filled with worry for the young boy.
John climbed the stairs to 221B in a half run, two steps at a time. He’d just spend a gruelling double shift at the clinic. They were in the middle of November and the flu season was in full flourish. Today had been nothing but runny noses, overly concerned mother hens, crying children and generally grumpy patients. As if that wasn’t enough the clinic was extremely understaffed as they too had been affected by the flu and John had unintentionally and unofficially been the one to run the place through this stressful time.
John’s heart almost broke at Sherlock’s soft, praising voice. “I wouldn’t put it like that..” John sighed and dropped his gaze, not able to accept the soft look his lover was offering him.
“You know for a so called genius you’re the biggest bloody idiot at times you know that?” Lestrade added as he placed a gentle hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and started leading him towards his parked car.
John smiled at Sherlock as their landlady disappeared down the stairs, Sherlock tried so hard usually to keep up a a mask of indifference, but Mrs. Hudson had always had a soft spot in the detective’s heart. John was happy to see that the longer he’d gotten to know Sherlock the detective had slowly but surely been able to open more up to the people around him. Finally accepting that he finally had friends that accepted him for who he was and not just pretending or manipulating him for their own benefit, just to throw him out of their lives again once they’d gotten what they wanted from him.
Greg offered to return John safely home to Sherlock. The doctor received several of the orange shock blankets from the paramedics to keep him warm on the ride.
John laughed softly and rubbed his eye. He hadn’t even noticed the young man until he’d been right in front of him, which wasn’t normal for him as his military training and instinct usually made it almost impossible for anyone to sneak up on him. He must be more tired than he realised.
“Fuck..” He hissed through clenched teeth as he cradled his now bruised knuckles to his chest. Another wave of despair threatening to pull him down as he realized once again how right Sherlock had been.
Sherlock chuckled at his mobile screen. Honestly, he’d never understand the fascination of a game consisting of a bunch of sweaty men, running around like fools, trying to kick a ball into a net. He’d choose boring biopsies and paperwork over football any day.
John immediately accepted the hug from his lover and pulled himself even closer, seeking all the warmth and comfort the detective could offer him as the tears began rolling down his cheeks.
He’d made it through the first two movies alright. As the story had progressed John had witnessed with glee as Sherlock, despite his best efforts had been thoroughly engulfed in the plot. Halfway through the second movie Sherlock had been so emerged that he’d thrown his long legs onto John’ lap to make himself more comfortable. John’s heart had almost skipped a beat at that point. He’d forced himself to just gently rest his hands atop Sherlock’s pajamas clad legs, suppressing his desire to caress the long limbs. But as he’d put in the last DVD, Sherlock complaining about John’s lack of speed in doing so, John had found himself softly nodding off after only 30 minutes, the warmth and comfort of being so close to Sherlock pulling him under quickly. Something however had awoken him from his soft slumber. John was a light sleeper, a trait he’d gained while in the army. His body was tuned to react to any form of danger or conflict, even asleep.
A harsh chill overtook him as he distantly heard something being ripped apart, making it harder to breath for a few seconds.. The repulsing wetness now latched onto his cold chest, sucking and licking.. He once again tried futilely to push back against the firm weight that was holding him in place, but he didn’t think his efforts were even noticed, let alone working..
Beside him Mycroft turned on the light on his phone allowing John to see his face. To the doctor’s surprise, the British Government looked greatly uneased.
“Right you do that, I’ll hurry as much as I can.” Lestrade said and hurried off back towards his office.
Sherlock was leaning back against the bar, his arms crossed on top on the counter, his whiskey waiting untouched in front of him. He still eyed the man with controlled contempt, but tried his best to act civil now that he at least seemed genuine apologetic for his actions.
Dimmock smiled gratefully. “Will do, thanks Dr. Watson.” Before leading his son onwards to his own office.
As Sally witnessed that sweet gesture she couldn’t help but feel ashamed that she ever doubted these two men’s love for each other. She looked at John, who’d now become her saviour. She’d always known he was a good man. Brave, strong and kind. And now he’d risked his own life without second thought to save her. Even though she’d never treated his lover or John himself for that matter well in the past. Still, if John could find love in Sherlock Holmes, then maybe she should try and be more accommodating towards the detective too.
She’d been so young when se married and she’d never wanted to bear children into the world her husband had led them into. But somewhere along the way she’d come to look upon Sherlock as her unbiological son. If there were a fundament on which she could build her life and beliefs on, it was the fact that her dear boy would always watch out for her and love her in his own special ways like he had today and that’s all a mother could wish for.
“Maybe I should ask that brother of yours Sherlock, I’m sure he’d be able to pull some strings.” Mrs. Hudson plotted on.
“Sabotaging you?! Have you even read the newspapers? They don’t call him the bull’s-eye killer for nothing Sherlock. That man is the best marksman the military has ever trained and from that distance it was hardly a challenge for him to plant a bullet right between your eyes! I saved your life you git!” John barked angrily. Couldn’t Sherlock see that all he’d done this night was trying to protect him? For God’s sake he loved Sherlock more than anything in this world, he meant more to him than his own life. He would never be able to forgive himself if Sherlock was hurt when he could’ve done something about it.
“Did you see Claire? I think she almost made her cry.” Jackson said and eyed the misty-eyed Claire as she half ran towards the kitchen to fetch the coffee.
Charlie still looked down but still didn’t make any move to jump right away so Sherlock continued in as calm a voice he could muster. “Whatever you’re going through right now, how much you might believe what you’re thinking of doing is the right decision.. It’s not. This is not the answer.”
“John!! P-Put him down!” Donovan ordered from the sideline, not wanting to admit that John actually scared her a bit.
“Easy for you to say. I’ve seen you take down guys twice your seize without even breaking a sweat.” Greg commented pointedly.
“Wow, just look at the two of you getting along so nicely.” He said with as much humour as he could master in his current state.
John, Sherlock and Lestrade had spent the best part of the day sorting through some cold cases Sherlock had worked out during the week. After a quick dinner containing take-out Thai food Greg and John had opted for grapping a few pints down at the bar not far from Bakerstreet. They’d offered Sherlock to join them, but the detective declined as Molly had just provided him with a fresh human tongue to run a series of experiments on, that being his vision of a Friday night well spent.
“I can guide us to it via the fastest route in here.” Mycroft offered, already up in a crouch to start leading the way. John however quickly pulled him down again.
Greg returned the smile. “I definitely feel an improvement. The first times we did this I thought I was going to die!” He panted out.
They entered the dark building trying to locate the boy. “Damn, I know he came here, but not where he went. He doesn’t know I followed him, but he was so upset I thought I should fetch you sooner rather than later Mr. Holmes, he actually listens to you for most part.” Dexter muttered softly.
“Sherlock, I’m heading to the gym. I’ll be back in a couple of hours.” John called through the apartment of 221B as he tossed a towel and a pair of sneakers into his old military duffel bag.
“No.. Noooo.. Jh.. Jawn..” Sherlock called out futilely for John to please come help him, please save him from this vile man before could fulfil his no doubt horrendous intentions.
“Because, Sherlock, Jones had slowed down and turned around with a bloody gun in his hands!! He was going to shoot you!!”
As Molly walked through the chilling night air she found that a supple peace had settled in her chest, that she hadn’t felt in a long time. Yes, she was disappointed that the man she’d pined after for so many years was now utterly out of her limits, but it had also left room for a feeling of relief and freedom to finally move on. Not long ago she’d never imagined Sherlock would ever had offered to help with her mundane work and tonight he’d stayed with her the whole night assisting her. Though she knew now she’d never have him in her life in the romantic sense of the word she felt a new kind of gratitude to have him as a close friend and that was enough.
Charlie let out a small grunt of protest. “As if. I’m not going to live with Dr. Twat Watson, thinking he’s all that just because he’s got a fancy diploma and knows how to boss people around professionally.”
“You too my dear boy, you too!! And thank you so much, but let me look at you.” The man said in glee as he pulled out of the embrace and held Sherlock by the shoulders looking him up and down multiple times.
“Yes well.. You were so taken with that onion soup when we visited that French restaurant last month so I figured since you’d been working so hard the last week I would try and replicate it for you.. For us I guess. As a surprise.”
Mr. Hadley broke the embrace and held Charlie at an arm’s length looking the boy over up and down multiple times. “Are you alright? We’ve been out looking for you, we even called the police! They have a patrol out looking for you. We were so afraid something happened to you.”
Everybody cheered loudly at the news and soon after, true to their word, Delta team evacuated the building. Two men carrying the DI’s limp form into the cool night air straight towards one of the awaiting ambulances.
Just then Mrs. Hudson exited the kitchen, wearing a pink apron adorned with a vivid flower print and wiping her hands off in a tea towel, as she saw John her smile widened.
Sherlock kept his arm around Charlie for the whole cab ride back to central London. Charlie didn’t protest the gesture and even leaned against the detective in his rare vulnerable state. They dropped off Dexter near Hyde Park, but not before he’d reached over to Charlie and held gently on the back of the boy’s neck as he whispered something into his ear. Sherlock could not make out the words but he didn’t try to either, letting the boys have their moment. He knew Charlie had come to see Dexter as a sort of older brother and whatever he said made the young boy break into a soft smile and gave him a small nod as answer.
bad! It looked like Sherlock couldn’t even walk on his own. He’d never seen the detective this messed up. In his young life he’d seen several different stages and ways of drunkenness in lots of people, but this seemed different than that. No matter what the cause of the detective’s odd condition was he knew he had to help somehow! There was no way he could overpower that brunt of a giant carrying him, he wasn’t delusional, so he had no other choice than to quickly sneak back out into the street and find help before it’d be too late!
John raised his weary head at the sound of Sherlock’s gentle voice. He hadn’t even noticed Sherlock until right now, and slightly surprised that his lover had waited up for him. Sherlock of cause immediately noticed the heavy bags underneath those usually cheery, blue eyes that were now, to his dismay, dull and bloodshot, clearly from hours of stress and lack of sleep.
But just as the question was spoken the doorbell rang out and Sherlock promptly jumped up to go answer it.
Mrs. Hudson wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s own and the detective unconsciously leaned into the comforting touch.
“Let me just get my bag and we’re out of here.” The doctor added swiftly. He would fit in an extra workout tomorrow to make up for today, but right now he also felt a desperate urge to hurry home with his detective in hand. Thank god the flat was only 5 minutes away, actually 3.. If they ran.
As Sherlock disappeared up the stairs, John stopped up for a moment and looked towards Anderson. “So, how are things going with Sofia?” He asked curiously. He knew Anderson had been seeing the brown-haired woman for some time now, but he’d had little chance to hear how it’d all evolved since then.
“But.. What if they still don’t..?” Charlie asked again, apparently still not willing to believe anyone would want to keep him in their life willingly.
“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.” He recited as he’d done so many times before and pulled the boy up to a standing position before handing them over to the two officers. “Put him in the back of the car, we’re taking him in.” He said.
Mrs. Hudson finally seems to realize her situation as the takes in her surroundings and the detective’s worried looks and ranting.
Sherlock sighed heavily, closed his eyes and gave himself a few seconds to mentally go over his body’s current state before answering. “My head hurts.. I feel dizzy, it feels like the room is spinning.. A bit sore.. I’m really nauseated and.. my troath hurts and feels raw.” He answered, still with his eyes closed. He opened them again quickly as the dizziness felt less severe when he had a focal point, he chose John to be that focal point. “What happened?” He then asked softly, his voice still low and a bit puzzled.
“Oh yeah baby, you smell so delicious and I bet that plump ass of yours is just as delicious as the rest of you. I can hardly wait.”
Sherlock would of course never be so shallow, as to allow simple psychical appearance to change his overall opinion of John. He’d loved the man just as fiercely with his soft belly and the no doubt reduced muscles mass from his army days, but he would be lying to himself if he didn’t say he greatly enjoyed the way John’s biceps bulged with strength whenever the bar was raised or how he could trace the doctor’s abdominal muscles through the green top with his eyes alone.
John realized that, for the first time, he was working under a cover he did not want. He was in way over his head. Here he was, talking to her father about the job he was paid to do, and his mind was drifting back to a night spent running around the wet muck of London, and how her breasts had felt pressed to his side.
Indeed, in John’s tremulous hand, he held a list. The handwriting was irrelevant, but the content revealed much, though John was too drugged and damaged to decode the simple groupings of words.
He was not unaware of the drawbacks of being out here, irrespective of past emotional trauma. There was no good takeaway, and there was nowhere to stomp when he needed to avoid the fumes of sulphur and burnt hair. There was nothing to do but hose him off when MacPherson rolled in cow pats, after which he had to listen to Sherlock fuss over the calibration of a bath temperature without her thermometer and MacPherson’s bath mat. He was therefore treated to varying treatises on the germs found in said excrement.
She turned and stalked away, muttering about freaks. She rather reminded Lucy of Petunia Dursley. Or Vernon. Yes, Vernon.
“Bloody Mycroft.” John muttered, following woman and canine to bed. This time, he knew he would wake up in Sherlock’s embrace. It was enough to make him glad of the two hours of sleep he’d be getting this night.
John was going to interrupt her as he opened his laptop and began to set up an illegal tap on Sherlock’s cell phone. Then, however, she stopped. No further sound came out of her mouth as she she sank into a chair, and retreated to her mind palace. He knew he was seeing Vienna all over again. Something inside John shifted. He knew he should have killed Mr. Macon when he’d had the chance.
John bristled behind his cool exterior. This man had never attempted to know Sherlock, to respect her, and in the tone of his voice John heard mockery. Mycroft’s eyes narrowed, and The Ice Man’s eyes blazed. One did not mock The British Government’s little sister. Greg put his hand on his husband’s arm, and Mycroft relaxed slightly.
She was a twenty year old woman, with choices and options, and by rights, especially at her age, she should have them. She shouldn’t be put in this position, though he age did make Mycroft and Greg slightly more relatable.
John clearly was the one to get the door when Sherlock didn’t so much as look away from her tweezers and her sample, and MacPherson only sighed. John opened it and found Sarah standing there. He’d assumed it was Lestrade. Lestrade was not to call on them as professionals until MacPherson was on his feet. Sarah, however, had no such injunctions against her and clearly dropped round the flat on his sixth day home.
The penny dropped for Greg. Though midazolam was not as well known in the media as compared to other medications, it was cheap and easy to get one’s hands on in the black market. It created memory loss, increased suggestibility, made a person essentially frozen in their minds until they fell asleep, aided oftentimes through sedation, or passed out from low blood pressure in an uncontrolled environment. “He—”
John snored. He could imagine a young Sherlock arguing with the rector over things like the impossibility of Genesis, and the Lord’s Supper. “Deleted your confirmation classes, have you?”
Mycroft was not one to accept being told what to do, but in this case, he saw the wisdom in retreat. He nodded, and stood, his chair rolling back slightly, “Shall we join the others, Sherlock?”
John looked at the pile of vintage suitcases in the entry to Baker Street, having carried them all down the stairs. He’d not lugged things like that since his days as a Private. Poor Peters had been ordered to carry a tree around during training to replace the oxygen he was wasting. Peters was still in the Army. Last John knew, he was alive and reasonably well.
John, respecting her wishes, did not push the subject. Something prodded the back of his mind, but he couldn’t quite put his finger upon what it was or should have been. John told himself that they were both worried about this new game of cat and mouse and went on with their evening, which included bad takeaway and crap telly.
“It is, for Mycroft. Why should he have anything I don’t?” Sherlock asked, lazily. “I share you, Lestrade. He should share his tin soldiers.”
John encouraged, not sure if he could bear her hesitation a second longer. Sherlock Holmes was not a woman prone to hesitation and second-guessing.
John pushed open the door behind her, and wished her an honest farewell. He stood there for a long moment, watching her disappear towards Baker Street Station. Upstairs, he heard a rare happy wolf and an even more rare peal of genuine feminine laughter. Intrigued, John headed up the stairs to find out what was so going on that had filled both dog and woman with exuberant joy.
“Er, so you lost your dog, yeah?” Evie was a nice person, for all that she had once shoved worms down Harry’s dress. All told, Harry had deserved that, and more still.
“This cannot continue.” Mycroft looked down at the puddle of blood,  “He cannot be loitering at the palace gates and...”
John let the matter fall, determined to search his memory. He would have remembered Sherlock. He knew they had never so much as crossed paths in New York. He would have known the second she showed up in his life. He would have pulled strings, would have done anything to keep in touch with her. He would have, once assuring himself that she was nineteen, left spy craft behind for an evening and took her to dinner and watched her deduce everyone in the room. He would have invited her back to his, and then he never, ever, would have spent another day without the sound of her heartbeat in his veins.
MacPherson lapped up the attention, nudging John’s hands for further petting. Sherlock blandly stated, “It has two hours, forty-two minutes, and twenty-nine seconds since we have last kissed, John.”
“I know what I mean to say!” Sherlock screeched, “Look at her roots showing through, she skipped her last salon appointment, as though vegans can’t have good hair! You can see she’s totally black and white. She’s been told to parrot that line like a good little worker bee, and if you wouldn’t interrupt we’d have MacPherson by now!”
“The tents were nicer than your hellhole.” John returned. They’d spent the night on their feet, and John was glad, if only because it meant having the ability to avoid her apartment.
“If you refer, Dr. Marshall, to my single meeting with Dr. Norwood regarding observations I made—” The man went to interrupt her again, and Sherlock’s eyes blazed as she continued, “I swore to uphold the dignity of human life when I took this post! Is that lip service, or would you have had me look the other way when a man decorated by no less than four governments at the highest levels put a knife in a light socket because idiots on your staff were blazing failures?”
He and MacPherson stood in the entry of Mycroft’s home when Mummy came bustling into the room, “Ah, John! How lovely to see you! And MacPherson!” She moved closer to them and paid a hearty greeting to the dog, who absolutely loved Mummy. After MacPherson was worked up to a suitable jolly wag and wiggle, Mummy finally looked to John, “You just leave him with me, won’t you? Go and fix yourself a drink should you want it.”
“Quid pro quo is not an option at this time.” Sherlock called from the loo, answering the question he had not voiced. “I’m going out.”
“Perhaps it would be more merciful to shoot you dead.” Sherlock mused, patting MacPherson as she finished slicing the tape on his back legs, “Then again, you deserve only the mercy you extend.”
Maybe there could be some comfort in the unknown, rather than just living in this vortex of needing to know everything just to survive. This musing didn’t mean that he was going let his guard down or make stupid choices, but it simply served as a reminder that there was a bigger world, a better world, out there beyond him somewhere.
John ate his banana covered waffle, trying in vain to think about how he was going to settle this war within himself. He liked Sarah. The emotion he felt for her was genuine. But could he love her, in time? Was he looking for love? He was happy, largely, with his life. This thing with Sarah felt like something he should want, rather than something he did, even though he did want her in his life. She was a great person, kind and funny, and smart, and good with patients, and fun to go for a pint with, and she was a great boss.
They arrived back at the farm, to find Carter Snapchatting who knew what in the kitchen with Sherlock’s makeshift lab in the background, “Hullo.”
They reached the top, and John dusted off his hands. He held them up in a placating gesture. Nowhere had he mentioned banal DINKs living in Camden. “I didn’t say--”
“If, Luce?” John grinned as his phone dinged, one, two, three, four, five, six times in rapid succession.  After a moment wherein they were both absorbed in their phones, he added, “That’s optimistic. He’s working a 7.75. I’m here on the 0.25% chance he won’t get shot gadding about London.”
“I’m not contributing to the corruption of a minor.” John clapped him on the shoulder, “Tough luck mate. You’ll have to learn the same way we all did.”
“You’re welcome.” Sherlock smiled her genuine, crooked, smile, and clicked gently to maintain the horse’s focus as she ran a curry comb over the horse’s side. “John, meet Fritz. Fritz, John.”
She took MacPherson everywhere she went, from the Chanel salon to foraging around skips. John invariably stood at the edge of the skip holding a lead, but at the very least he got to be useful and stay out of refuse. He knew that dogs were man’s best friend, and indeed, MacPherson proved in that single act alone.
If there was somebody out to kill him, he needed to work fast. He wasn't sure if the panic was coming from thoughts of his death or the fact that he hadn't died.
John chuckled, as she cleaned up after herself and prepared to leave him to rest. “I haven’t got a wife.”
“It’s lovely, thank you.” John answered Mummy before taking the piss out of Mycroft, “I thought you visited for the company, Mycroft. The secret’s PG Tips.”
She drew in a heaving breathing, attached her head to an invisible string and drew herself into effortless posture. Just like that, the vulnerable woman who had been shaking in his arms not five minutes ago was gone, leaving behind a self-assured facade in its place. She clicked a few buttons on her phone, and looked to Greg for a long moment.
“Well, we’ve got two away on holiday this week, and one’s just left to have a baby. Might be a bit mundane for you.” She hedged, and John knew that he had it in the bag. Thank God.
“We’re good?” Janet asked, and stated, before stirring the oats one more time, and declaring them finished, began to lift the pot.
Saying close was one of the first commands Sherlock had taught him. It told him that he needed to stay within a 50 foot radius of either him or Sherlock. John was not sure how they had worked out that boundary line, but it worked well enough. The dog got to maintain his autonomy, which Sherlock was loathe to restrict when he was smarter than most humans who had full autonomy on the basis of the accident of being born human, and they avoided any accident lack of supervision might cause.
“Me? No, no. I’m quite all right. Trooping the Colour always steals my appetite.” She sipped her drink, “Lovely to have met you.”
“Hello, John!” Molly called out from the lab. John could hear the spray of the sinks in the back as Molly went about her work day.
“I’m sure that’s just the thing for her, dear.” Violet smiled, and it was clear to John that she had made a game out of not using her husband’s name in front of John. John supposed he could just ask Sherlock what her father was called, but John recognized the puzzle as a gift from one operative to another.
It felt strangely good to be out of London. Outside of working and The Work, he hadn’t really been anywhere save war zones and London since University, and he felt that he was returning to some truth within himself as the farms and villages brought memories to the forefront of his mind. In the back seat, MacPherson seemed as enamored of the scenery as he was of his favorite bone. After a time, he placed his great head on the ledge of the door and pressed his nose to the glass of the closed window.
John was not particularly enthused by his obligation to address this council, but he had the real chance to explain to them what the medical and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan looked like from an Army’s doctor’s perspective. It was not a gift he would squander, not with the knowledge of his patients in his mind. It was intensely driven by both his understanding of facts, but also the implications of those facts.
With that, she guided Sherlock over the threshold. There was a chair waiting, probably because of the Chaplain, who cared not that she was an atheist and John rarely darkened he door of a church. Sherlock pulled her eyes from the horrible wooden chair, and felt the bottom drop out from under her world.
Sherlock was on her feet and heading toward the door. Instead of rattling off deductions, she merely demanded, “Let’s go.”
They headed companionably down the stairs, stopped for a biscuit and a pat at Mrs. Hudson’s, and began to walk down Baker Street. The Boots was right next to the station, and so they made quick work of purchasing the essentials John had previously considered.
“I want you to be sure that he’s what you want.” John switched tracks. If they took this dog, they took him until he was old and grey. This couldn’t be a passing fancy like her fleeting obsessions, “This isn’t a houseplant. He’ll have feelings, and very likely issues, traumas.”
“MacPherson, no.” Sherlock’s attention was pulled over to the dog, who was laying down, yes, but had put his head on nan’s slippers, and was therefore mouthing the wooly fronts.
“You cook entrails in our best kettle, but refuse to scoop poop.” John observed, “Did you get her number?”
John said nothing, though he knew that Sherlock was more cunning genius than bloodless coward. Mummy had hit far too closely to his thoughts, for he had been put in mind of walking into a battlefield of a new sort. As he had once entered Buckingham, he entered the Holmes home. John, in his first glance, knew that this place radiated Mummy and Father, from the lovely flowers in the entry to the absurd painting of some mathematical concept made art.
John sighed, looking over the scraggly dog the size of an elephant in the glow of the high-powered lights in the back of the van. His skeletal body looked huge. No wonder Sherlock couldn’t lift him when she’d tried. “He is rather cute.”
Sherlock was fixated, and her eyes glowed with deduction. It was all John could do to keep his hands to himself as they bolted from the lab back to the house, MacPherson trotting sleepily along with them as they tried in vain to quash their levity. Joy was palpable between them. As they rounded the landing, Sherlock muffled her giggles in the crook of John’s neck, her laughter like champagne bubbles in his stomach.
John knew, on the basis of rationality, and his history of training and being a psychiatric patient, that what he was experiencing was the temporary uptick in his emotions as he finally let go of baggage. He was releasing his past. Of course he felt weightless. He’d been dragging around tonnes of bricks for years. He didn’t know what had helped him to make the shift over the last week, but he supposed it had begun the very moment he had realized Sherlock Holmes was sitting with the chickens with their feathers unintentionally in her hair.
“If you say so.” John abandoned his tea, late for work already, and shrugged on his coat, “Please try not to burn down the flat.”
Mike looked so happy. Lucy knew her work was done. She saw that he’d been having a hard day, if the lack of starch in his trousers is anything to go by.
John was instantly aware of the shopgirl approaching him. She wore a white top and black trousers, and was carrying a few boxes of shoes. “Mr. Watson, these are the shoes Miss Holmes requested. Shall I take them in to her?”
“What?” John asked, rolling his shoulders as he left the study, absurdly happy to see dog hair on the silk settee Sherlock had vacated.
John’s gaze flew to Mycroft’s in a single instant. “You have no right to MacPherson, Mycroft. Do you really want to attempt to remove him from Baker Street?”
John swallowed, and knew that there was more than a pair of knitting needles between them. Each night, by mutual accord, he had ended up in her bed, and last night they hadn’t even kept up the pretense of him starting out anywhere else. After three days, it was a natural progression of their day together. He still hadn’t managed to wake up with her, but he wasn’t going to ask for more than he had any right to want, though want he did, just the same. John knew the tension was palpable between them.
“Why not?” Sherlock lifted part of the animal as the vet continued her assessment. John was so used to triage that he tuned it out.
Sherlock almost screamed in frustration. Her mind was going too quickly. She didn’t know what to do. The sensible choice seemed so absolutely banal and fraught with nothingness. Spying a woman leaving one of the cubicles, she asked the woman in her native tongue, “When meeting a man, what would you say?”
With that, the phone Sherlock was holding tightly began to buzz. She fumbled to answer it. “Bring him back.”
“No…” John ventured, kicking off his shoes and wiggling his finally freed feet into the threadbare carpet, “What?”
“Oh, don’t be absurd, John.” Sherlock sniffed, “I’ve hired it out. But as it stands, I must supervise the entire process, because imbeciles make an utter mess of even the simplest tasks.”
She slipped into the town car. She might not have Mycroft’s job or Sherry’s standing, but she had her own means, and she absolutely refused to ride in those yellow monstrosities New Yorkers called taxis. They were an affront to her senses, even if the drivers were some of the most interesting and personable people she had ever come across.
A woman, young looking, tall and painfully thin, appeared from an alcove. She held a lit cigarette in her pale fingers, and she blew out smoke, “Then again, perhaps...” She shook her head, and snuffed out her cigarette on a saucer she’d clearly taken from the party. She barely looked old enough to smoke.
John and Lestrade were two of the best men she knew, and she knew they would be close, when they had the chance. Now was not going to be their only, or even their first, chance. “I’m not going to introduce you. If you want to meet John, you’re going to have to wait until he is not incapacitated.”
“Alright!” Greg cried as bodies moved around them, “I want to know just what the hell is going on here, before—”
After his quick breakfast, John set about getting a handle on things once more. He greeted Carter, the boy who came round in the morning and afternoons to help Nan, and put to the various chores that had defined his growing up years.
After a moment, Dr. Norwood bade her to enter into his office, and Sherlock did so, coming to her point rather quickly, “Your patient, Captain Watson…” Sherlock chose her words very carefully, “I have reason to believe he is experiencing some undocumented psychological symptoms.”
“Your naming suggestions are certainly not as banal as John’s selections.” Sherlock praised over John’s good natured objections, “Now tell me, what is this hen’s name?”
Sarah nodded, and it was clear to even John that he’d just learned something new about Sarah. She was not a dog person. He didn’t quite understand that, but he also knew that MacPherson stood head and shoulders above others of his species, literally and figuratively. He was kind and smart and funny and compassionate. He was sure that Sarah would love him just as they did.
Sherlock’s curiosity was palpable as John entered various databases. “You said his name was Victor Trevor, correct?”
His voice was careful, tutored. His sister had a faint accent. He did not. This spoke volumes. He had worked hard upon his entry to the Army to sound like Joe Bloggs, and in doing so, he had discovered a talent for languages. Sherlock knew that one day, there would be a moment in time that he cared only for truth with a depth that she would hear his real voice, and not the one shared with the world, even if accents as a general rule did strike her as inefficient. Gavin said she had an accent herself, though that was absurd, because she had never once discerned it for herself.
John noted the glint in her eyes. She probably meant it. Most people did, in that rote sort of way. It was polite to say, but John really wondered if it was polite to talk about death, and death, and suffering, and loss. Then again, she likely had some romantic view of war, unsecured by reality. No, he realized, she was testing his mettle. She wasn’t saying anything mindlessly. She had a point, an intention. This woman was intent on observing his reactions, intent on emotionally manipulating him, reminding him of who and what he had used to be. He wasn’t up for a witty game.
No. Sherlock would not lie to herself any more than she would lie to John. It had taken her an instant to perceive it and months to accept it, largely because it came with unacceptable risks to his person.
Sherlock looked at him as though she could see the flesh melting from his bones. “Why would you assume he’ll do something you’ve already done? MacPherson is well aware of crime scene behavior, which is not something I can say for your team, despite MacPherson’s exacting example since his arrival.”
Sherlock, be she 18 or 80, was a grown woman who did not need her family looking out for her in quite this way. They had means, Mycroft surely thought this use of them normal, but John knew better. John wasn’t going to be their tool.
It was almost three in the morning by the time they finished this first step of knowing all they needed to know to stay two steps ahead of Victor. Sherlock had deduced that he was already in over his head, having come this weekend for the sole purpose of compelling her to assist him in erasing his debts and managing his aims. John was incandescent, the satisfaction of falling back into roles that had invigorated him for years firing his blood. That he was using these skills with Sherlock’s interest and admiration simply intensified the contentment flooding his veins.
“Entirely.” Sherlock turned right, and John saw why she had flung herself out of the government issue vehicle. “We’re here.”
“Dr. Watson, I oversee a staff of two full-time caseworkers, three part-time assistants, a housing advocate, a volunteer coordinator, a veteran’s advocate, and a few other people.” Janet replied, “The place doesn’t look like much, but we serve upwards of 300 meals a day, and offer service coordination to a smaller number of clients to assist people in finding and maintaining sustainable housing and employment. We serve everyone who walks through our doors, and I haven’t been able to keep a doctor in the place, not for want of trying.”
“Why?” John asked, suddenly very aware that this was not a discussion about a horrible jumper. She knew he’d love a horrible jumper.
There was no small talk as Tom got to his point, calling out as he did as he walked away from his 4x4, “Don’t suppose you’re yet interested in selling off, Johnny?”
Something about the rapidity of that intervention had convinced John to try and let his fate play out.
John knew there had to be more to this whole situation. He knew that Victor knew how Sherlock felt, he simply did not give enough value to her emotions and opinions to take them seriously when they contradicted his own. “There are other scientists with whom to correspond.”
“You’re manipulating me to get what you want.” Sherlock’s confidence was placed fully in this truth.
By the time John fruitlessly searched his memories of New York, they were back at Baker Street. It was getting on to six in the morning. Soon Mrs. Hudson would poke her head upstairs with an mandatory invitation to a post-case fry up, and soon Molly would bring MacPherson home where he belonged. But for now, he was faced with the monumental task of going in there and looking at their flat like everything about it hadn’t changed since he’d rushed inside to find acid boiling on the cooker.
“So it’s only fair I suffer through the hell that is shopping with you.” John mumbled as Sherlock deduced a dress and found it lacking, “What about that gold one you got last week?”
“Oh, God.” John breathed, as chemicals were open around her and there was a pot of God knew what boiling on the stove. Upon second sniff, it smelt of acid and some corrosives. He did not know what the madman had planned, but the chemicals said quite a lot. Molly’s words rang in his ears, below the steady thrum of his pulse,
The hotel staff was already looking Sherlock’s way. Set the smoke alarm off once, and these imbeciles never left one alone. She could have gotten a flat, but the committee insisted she be here for the final rehearsals as part of international bonding and togetherness. Sherlock had met at least two semi-passable young women with whom to converse and deduce, so at least the stricture wasn’t altogether absurd.
Molly hauled Sherlock off to the loo, who delivered a pointed Sherlockian barb in Victor’s direction and swanned away, leaving John with his prey.
Sherlock opened the door, and was already walking inside. It was clear to John that they were in accord. John, carrying only the frozen and chilled groceries, followed Sherlock inside. Everything else could wait.
Sherlock had no hesitation in speaking, “I’ve been analyzing dog hair, and of course the in-process DNA testing will confirm it, but we have evidence to believe he’s a Scottish Deerhound.”
In the distance, John saw Sherlock walking MacPherson through a deduction from where he sat next to her crouching body. He was halfway to wondering  if he’d been replaced wholesale when the dog moved at the slightest command from Sherlock, and began moving steadily in his direction.
“No, he arranged this one quite admirably, didn’t he?” Mycroft’s soft voice was pained. He looked over at John, “Dr. Watson...” he looked over at the guard post, “Don’t you have somewhere to be?”
The party on the first night of the long weekend was in full swing, and John felt as though his head was spinning. He had been introduced to every relative and family friend he thought the senior Holmes’ possessed. When Mummy released him from trotting him around like a pet poodle in dress uniform, he found Molly fuming as she stared daggers at Sherlock, who was dancing with a tall, suave, man of Molly’s age.
“Nope, you’re both going in.” Greg cut through what he clearly saw as Sherlockian bullshit, “And we’re talking about that cryptic phone call, believe you me.”
John thought that unlikely. He barely did that for her, and he was bloody well human. “He’ll eat my jumpers and shit on the rugs.”
“Hey now.” John retorted, reaching for Sherlock as she stepped back to move the biscuit box away from MacPherson’s excitable reach, “I dare you to outdo a whole range of new data.”
Then, and then, the ship was filled with the sounds of boots and voices searching out Mr. Weston. He made every attempt to run, but John caught him. If he broke a few of Weston’s ribs in the process, well, that was only one-tenth of what he planned to do.
After all, not matter else what they were to one another, they were friends. He wasn’t going to judge her over this, over anything. He had no need to play Sir Galahad, for Sherlock had no doubt done that for him, was that for him. He had no need to play the hero. Heroes had scruples in protecting those they loved. John did not.
Another man cut into his dance with Molly, leaving John the perfect opening to do so with Sherlock. His name was Nick, another friend from Uni, though Sherlock was not likely to consider him a friend. He was in medical research, and reminded John very strongly of a young, if slightly jumpy, Mike Stamford.
“If you want a PA to make you tea and answer your phones, Sherlock, hire one.” A silver haired man John had observed approaching said, “Your security detail is not your nanny.”
“Oh, John. This isn’t a novel, and life isn’t that simple.” Sherlock smiled almost sadly, and fell silent. “If only we could manufacture a case that only I could solve, and thusly use that proximity in order to facilitate their retrieval.”
The poor canine knew something was changing in his life, and his ability to grasp at hope and joy after a life of untold pain and suffering shook John deeply, as it had done for the past few months of his rehabilitation. Over time, he had found himself seeing London through MacPherson’s eyes, and found that he wanted the dog to have every possible positive experience he possibly could in life. In this, he and Sherlock was totally and completely united. It seemed a strange, and yet perfectly correct, objective to share.
“She’d take of that herself, of that I have no doubt.” James smiled, “But if I have any hope of saving myself a great deal of trouble, I really must go and assure her our brother is a bag of hot air who loves her devotedly and that she has made an admirable choice in a partner.”
John grabbed the chocolates. He wasn’t sharing those. He just wasn’t. How the hell had his mystery benefactor managed to stuff so much in one ordinary box? Were they experts at physics or something? They simply had to have fantastic spacial reasoning skills, for not a centimeter of space was wasted. “Don’t you have some paperwork to do?”
“Yes, fantastic idea. Brilliant.” Sherlock’s blue eyes glittered, as she paused and stared into his gaze very intently, more memorization that deduction. A heartbeat passed between them, punctuated with yet another breathless kiss.
John knew it would take him twenty seconds to grab the gibbon. He also knew that there had to be air vents somewhere, and he was determined to find some portholes or something to smash open. He hadn’t been Navy, but for the first time he wished he’d paid more attention on ships, rather than simply learning mostly in theory how to commandeer them, escape them, and the like.
Sherlock clicked away on her phone. “You’re short, the bed should be suitable, for a man such as yourself.”
John sniffed. So what? All John saw was a man who was likely hemmed in by expectation, and limited by his circumstances, same as anyone else.
Quickly, Lucy gathered her things, and slid to the door, slipping out of the row without bashing anyone, even though she did earn several glares. “It can’t be that interesting.” Lucy muttered, stepping over bodies in the row, “Christ.”
John Watson lived a life of objectives. He had to always have an objective in the front of mind, in order to survive, in order to save his patient, in order to make it through the day. He sometimes felt adrift with the enormity of the weight on his shoulders, how one decision had led to another. He’d never expected to get in so deep, but he supposed that’s what happened when you signed your life over for Queen and Country.
“We’ll cross bridges as we come to them.” John returned, tugging his gloves back on his with rigid tugs not unlike those he’d once used in theatre, “I’d advise you not to go burning them.”
With that, John drained his tea and strode away. He had a dog to walk and a detective to meet in a secluded location.
“It is exactly what it seems!” Her tormentor returned, “You were set up from the start, Johnny. She always pretended she was so much different from other women, but really, actions speak louder than words.” Victor Trevor snarled, his suppressed hunting rifle exchanged for a legal pistol that was on a revoked and expired firearms certificate to James Armitage.  “All of that intellect, totally wasted. Imagine! Thirty-seven pages alone deducing how much you loved your mother and how that boded well for your ability to be a functional member of a nuclear family. Fairy stories.”
“Check the stables, John.” Mummy advised, “Sherlock is no doubt either there with the horses or in her lab. I’m afraid we’re all second chair to the animals and experiments. She’s probably forgotten we exist.”
Time was irrelevant, but she eventually heard movement by the door. Thinking it the nurse to come again and tell her that John would be taken to surgery now, she looked up quickly and saw Lestrade lingering by the entry. Sherlock nodded, and he entered the room, looking as uncomfortable as she had ever seen him.
Murray was already biting into one. Being the best trauma nurse around got him a free pass, John supposed, “Jesus Christ, Watson. Who wants to have your babies?”
“If you’re here to volunteer, go talk to Frank.” She was busy mixing up something in an industrial sized pot over a huge stove, “If you’re press, go talk to the patrons. Just stop talking to me, I’ve got two seconds to myself and we’re out of porridge.”
“What do you make of that exchange?” John asked the dog as he reached for a jacket. Time marched so quickly that it would be winter before he knew it.
Mind on his gun beneath his shirt and his stomach, he decided to hedge his bets, and wait. John decided that now was as good a time as any to eat his Tim Tam.
All night, they chased a down cabby and ran through London. John wondered how ever lived a second without her. They’d slept on a stakeout, having gone from the lab to Lestrade’s office because Sherlock was sure they were looking for a cabby. Sherlock had insisted that the cabby would come to them, but that she needed to lay in wait.
John absolved him, “It’s nice to see you.”  He didn’t know exactly how to express how he was doing, so he simply said, “I’m okay, Vernet. Every day’s an adventure, or so they say. Nothing much happens to me.”
Even with his pension and Sherlock’s cases, money would be tight. He needed a job. And luckily, he had an interview at a nearby clinic in an hour, set up this morning. John hoped he’d make a good impression.
“She’s been working with her network since she was sixteen.” Mrs. Hudson mused, “I shouldn’t worry. They protect her.”
Sherlock paused to inhale a breath quickly, “Your interest in his thought associations, dreams, and fantasies do nothing provide him a context to get under your skin and see what makes you tick. You will note he often takes control of the session without your awareness, I’m sure.”
There was never any name, never any personal interaction, though she seemed more open over time. However, John could not help but feel he was being given glimpses into this woman’s soul. He had to remind himself on several occasions that she was likely married, working in a governmental office, prone to indulging in sweets, and was also possibly gay. Still, it was good to have a friend. Being half in love with someone he’d never met was his own damn problem and he wasn’t going to let his weirdness cloud something good.
John would never tell, but the blog that was most astute regularly received blinds from a source in the know, one who was sitting across the table from him. Sherlock said that if her Aunt Mari was going to force her to play nice with celebrities for charity, at least she should get something out of it. John thought it one of her more benign hobbies. He could have lived, however, without knowing that his favorite singer was actually a shit human being.
John grabbed a pen and reached for a notepad, knowing that it was a slim chance to get his name, but he might get a date of return. All information was vital. “What day would you like to schedule your appointment, Mr…?”
John came up the stairs carefully as he had literally just been taunted by some criminal who had it in for them. Mrs. Hudson was out, and the ground floor of Baker Street was silent, devoid of the sounds of Mrs. Hudson’s cantankerous cooker or her telenovelas. She was probably with Mrs. Turner next door, or her boyfriend under the guise of a book club.
“DI Lestrade was here, said he was meeting you lot for dinner and wanted MacPherson to meet you.” Carter replied to Sherlock’s tone with a lazy tone as he thumbed his phone’s screen, “He showed me the texts and—”
On and on this went. He treated a few burns, what looked like an old knife wound, splinted a sprained wrist, gave out a handful of tampons, and diagnosed two cases of bronchitis as well as one case of walking pneumonia. There had been a queue of about ten people, and John was cleaning up his area when saw the director approaching with a mug in her hands. John knew he was in for it, as he had rather commandeered the woman’s prep kitchen, “I know that got a bit out of hand.”
The man stopped,  as if he could feel John’s consideration of him, as if he could read the questions in John’s stiff, exact, bearing. “I’m deducing you. Do keep up. Lestrade refuses to give me cases. Stickler for the rules. Obvious.”
John was a bit shocked, and didn’t know how to respond. He was not a well-known figure, preferring to keep his reputation confined to the work he did within his service to his country. He was certain he’d never muddied the waters in Germany, but then again, she was the de facto leader of Europe and he’d had a scrape or two in his time.
“The middle one,” John admitted, “I remember.” He didn’t admit that he remembered it from the lips of a lover, let alone a wife, because he didn’t. His Nan liked poetry, and she’d had a thing for Burns. What old Scottish granny didn’t like Burns? Nan would sooner disavow Mills and Boon before Robbie Burns.
“Why didn’t you come home, Mina?” Greg asked. It was the first time John had ever heard anyone reference Sherlock’s legal name, much less call her a diminutive of the long mouthful. It spoke volumes, “You never—”
“Our Sherly graduated Newnham at 16 with a first, did her graduate studies, went to Vienna, spent time in New York, don’t mention it, she hated that city, and came home.” The Holmes father was so proud. John could hear it in his voice,  “She was let go from her research post for becoming too involved, shall we say? The rest is hers to tell, but I’ll see that you get a file. School records, hospital reports, etc. etc. etc.”
Within a day, a slew of dog things began to arrive. Within two weeks, though, that stopped, only to be replaced by a continuation of the experimentation on various objects, from the durability of dog bowls to the softness and fiber quality of various blankets. She carried out durability and safety tests on dog toys. The litany of tests and experiments she devised were inventive, while dizzying.
“I am not infatuated with him.” Sherlock hissed, a blush suffusing her face. Infatuation was based on the superficial, the reflection of self and selfishness in another. Sherlock felt none of those things for John Watson. She had read Molly’s magazines, solely for research.
John readily agreed to the week in the country once Sherlock had done so. MacPherson would have ample space to run  and play, and he would get a week to clear his head and consider what on earth had happened in Mycroft’s study. It would also give Sherlock some time to ride her horses, experiment in her lab in one of the outbuildings, and perhaps sleep more than three hours a night while exploring local cases that came her way.
“Second generation. Learned the steps as a child. Left handed, ambidextrous with a weapon. Favors left hand for gun, right for driving. Possibly. Single, no children. Too much time given to glossing.”
“Leave me alone about it.” She snapped, “I won’t leave him in the gutter to starve, and I won’t hack him up, or test things on him. What more do you want?”
“John.” The portly man seemed baffled, “Don’t tell me you’ve gone and found a date here, of all places.”
After several months,  Sherlock knew she had lost weight. She said she had lost her subcutaneous fat from her late teenage years, though she knew she had stopped eating, stopped sleeping as she ought to do. Her last two menstrual cycles had been uncharacteristically troublesome. The Doctor John in her mind despaired of her, and told her she was not a swan.
John followed her along, back through the main corridor, earning introductions to the staff members and clients that stopped Janet no less than four times in her attempt to get to the rooms she had set aside for medical work. Right near the vestibule, there was a simple wooden door that had once held a sign. Unlocking this simple door, Janet showed him into a small set of rooms. John could see that his predecessor had taken much of the equipment with him.
They weren’t going to be discussing the cops in the apartment then. Still, John had to mention something. A tech pulled open a drawer, “Common spaces and visible objects only!” Sherlock snapped, without bothering to look up form her pristine microscope.
Mickey had long ago headed out for the day, and the evening staff had already come in to their shifts at the shelter. John was therefore alone in the dimmed office light as a man came to the door. John had him pegged in a second. “Media requests are handled through the director’s office.”
John plonked himself down on an upholstered bench, where he would be able to see Sherlock when she came out of the dressing room. He was not thinking about the way silk and chiffon would feel against her trim body. Rather, he was mindfully considering his next blog post. Though he did not normally mention personal events or outings, he decided that he would compile a post of the deductions she’d made whilst shopping into a post called
