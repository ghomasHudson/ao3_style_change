“Since you have two do you share? I mean I’d be willing to pay for a little fuck. I thought that girl was pretty but your boy is practically sin.”
Sherlock was curled into a pretzel on the leather sofa dressed only in one of John’s oversized jumpers a pair of tempting black pants and some fuzzy blue puppy dog covered socks Mrs. Hudson had brought up.
The bluntness made John blink. Still, half-sleep the boy wriggled to straddle John’s waist. The teenager poked John’s half-hard cock with an accusatory finger and leaned down to glare at it.
The scars had healed thoroughly due to the bonding process and only new wounds remained. Latex ghosted over the slightly reddened backside. The alpha glanced up at John.
“No Jawn, they thaid it wath thupid.” Sherlock confided matter of factly as he steadily drank the chocolate drink.
John Watson clutched his letter tightly in one hand as he limped heavily down the street. A letter that informed him that as a former soldier and an unbounded alpha he was required to accept an omega. The letter also had an address, date, and time.
“John Watson 24 hours is more than enough time for the two of you to pick out what you need. I’ll cook something for you but it is in your omega’s best intrust to let him make some decisions”
“One called me Peth” The boy had a lisp not uncommon to omegas who had been raised as slaves from a young age.
“I don’t know if you want pups… or if you would want pups with me… but if you don’t you’ll need to take these so you don’t get pregnant.”
John rubbed his face in an attempt to collect himself. This was sickening, absolutely sickening and it hadn’t even been more than an hour. Holding one mug in each hand he walked to the sitting room to be greeted by a conflicting sight. The animalistic part of John’s alpha relished in the boy, his omega, kneeling on the ground upright on his knees, back arched, legs slightly spread, hands on his nape, head bowed in submission. John himself was saddened and enraged. He forced himself to speak calmly.
The girl whimpered pressing her face into John’s calf. Sherlock was ridged in the blond’s arms hiding his face in the striped jumper.
Not much he could do physically to kill someone unless it was a woman… or a child. His blood ran cold and he found himself scooting farther back in his bunk.
“It hurts,” he muttered, closing his eyes in humiliation. Moriarty seized his cock again in a painfully tight grip.
“Good,” Moriarty purred. “I want it to hurt. I want him to see how much it’s hurting you.” He began to fuck John in earnest, gaining momentum. John tried his best to brace himself against the pain, to not give Moriarty the satisfaction of hearing him scream or, god forbid, seeing him cry. So much harder to bear was the humiliation of having his body used and violated, and being exposed like this. Now that he knew to look, he saw two other video cameras in the corners, and maybe others he couldn’t see. Was Sherlock really watching? Who else would Moriarty show this repulsive event to? John dug his nails into the couch, gouging out troughs in the leather. It hurt so much; stabbing pains and twisting cramps shot through his abdomen and down his legs. He could feel trickles of blood running slowly down his thighs. He felt as though he were being skinned from the inside out. He couldn’t take much more of this. Suddenly Moriarty was slipping a hand around him and taking hold of his cock again.
John tried his best to remain very still, and not portray any of the cold terror he now felt twisting his stomach. Moriarty wanted him to react; to demand an explanation, threaten retribution, anything that showed he had him scared. John held his gaze and said nothing. Moriarty slipped his hands into the pockets of his grey suit trousers, and continued to amble slowly about as if in an art museum.
“What’s this called in your circles, John? The reach-around?” Moriarty resumed his thrusting as he manually stimulated John.  John squeezed his eyes shut and tried to ignore it. He couldn’t believe his body was responding in this way, acting entirely against his will. He’d heard it could happen during… in this situation, but he couldn’t accept that
“Now John, no fair going all quiet on me.” He began to stroke John’s member gently, as though they were really lovers. “Your first time should be fun.”
body, with Moriarty… It didn’t exactly feel good, but it seemed to ease the pain of the forced penetration a little. Moriarty moaned lustfully in his ear, making his skin crawl. “You like that, don’t you? I can feel you getting harder.”
"Good. Have fun. I'll see you later.." John signs and smiles. He heads off down the hall toward the family room to sleep.
"Okay. I'll bring you something. And I'll get the others something to eat and an update. But I'm sure they'd like to hear from you. Maybe you could all eat together?"
The moment Mycroft's fingers find Anthea's clit, the woman lets out a loud moan that Harry only half hopes is covered by the sound system in the theater.
"Let me fuck your arse next." He groans as he pulls out of her cunt, smirking as his cum floods out.
"God, she takes it so well.. next time we should try to see if I can fit more than one cock in my mouth."
"Oh Zack. I told him how you like to bake and he's been thinking about becoming a baker." She smiles as she dries her hands.
“Please.” Sky nods after hanging up. “It’s hard to explain to them what we can do. What we have to do.” She runs her face.
Greg rains down another smack. "You are not allowed to come until I give you permission." Greg reminds him.
Mycroft circles his fingers around Anthea’s clit as he leans in, flicking his tongue over Harry’s nipple.
Sky giggles and smiles. She picks up her phone and flops back into bed, leaning against Michael. She hums softly as she sends out hundreds of texts to multiple people.
"You'll have to beat other men off her with a stick. They'll want her so badly they won't know what to do with themselves. The first time I was pregnant Collin nearly had to hump me in public every time we went out because I was lusted after so much." She purrs.
"Yeah.." She nods and tries to move but Turk holds her in place as he sleeps. "He hasn't slept in years. That's why he's an ass. He's a crabby overtired bitch. This is the first time he's slept so long in years." She sighs. "I can keeps his nightmares at bay so he can sleep."
Sherlock tears up the moment he feels John’s hand against his cheek. “Oh John…” His voice cracks with emotion.
“Yes yes. I’ll fill my baby with so many babies.” He growls dominantly, cock throbbing in his trousers.
John squeezes the hand that takes his, feeling lighter after their therapy session, even though he doesn't know why exactly. "So do you want this week or next week then?"
"When Mycroft signs that death certificate, all my legal rights turn over to your brother... And I'm pregnant with
John only hears half of what Sherlock said. His mind swimming and heart singing knowing that Sherlock was still unbonded.
As Sherlock sleepily pulls him back down into the cocoon of blankets, John finds he doesn't want to get up and flee for his bedroom. He and Sherlock had entered into the flatshare under the false pretense of a relationship. Since Sherlock had found out he was an Omega, all John could think about was what would happen if it wasn't a false relationship... what if it were real.
Sherlock blushes at the praise and thrusts harder, his cock eagerly leaking. “Wish I could go deeper, Mummy. Fuck your womb like John does with Sky.”
Greg barks out laughing. "Really you're thinking about your brother after you just come all over my leg?" Greg throws his head back laughs harder.
Sherlock hugs John. “It’s okay. He’s scared. But we can’t lose him. I want to speak to him. I want to make sure he understands that I want to protect him.” He says softly.
‘Danny was telling me about a thing called a zoo. He said they have lots of animals there to see. I wanna go see them.’ She smiles excitedly.
Sherlock moans loudly as he’s forced to swallow everything, arching up as Eric pushes into his arse.
Greg half shrugs. “I guess so. But I am, a literal son of the devil. My ancestor raised his and bore a child. Generations later here I am. I- I’ve heard I’m more powerful that most wizards.” He explains.
“Oh gosh. I wouldn’t know the first thing about it, really. You know me. I don’t really have any game at all. Certainly none substantial enough to make a lasting connection.” John avoided eye contact, and swigged a bit more wine, his face fully flushed now. “I’d be the last person you should ask.”
John pulls a packet of slick from his pocket and pours it over his fingers. “My good alpha. My husband.” He rubs slick fingers over Sherlock’s hole.
He fucks his arse hard and with three fingers, sucking on his clit as he gently massages his g spot, knowing he'd squirt all over him.
John sighs and answers the phone. "Hello, Harry." John says. "WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN YOU SODDING PRICK! I've been calling you for days!" Harry yells and he flinches away from the phone. "Busy Harry. I've been busy." John says calmly. "Busy doing what? Running about with that mad detective of yours?" Harry snaps. John looks at Sherlock wirily. John holds his hand over the phone and talks to Sherlock. "I can't even talk to her when she's like this." John sighs.
Hey, Tindo here! Accident is asleep ;) Maybe some of you lovely people can surprise them with a comment or two for when they wake up?
He blushes brighter, encouraged by his words. He smiles shyly, getting more confident. He takes off his pants next.
"How does it feel? Knowing that this is what you were made for? Made for taking cock? And you take it so well.." He grips his hips and angles his thrusts.
"Mm my fiancé.." He kisses him. "That does have a lovely ring to it but I think I'd prefer husband." He grins cheekily.
Sabine looked up, her eyes steely. Her free hand unbuttoning the cuff of her sleeve, she pushed the material up, showing dozens of cigar burns in various stages of healing, some still raw. "I was a business deal." She said, bitterly. "I can't wear dresses because these are all over my arms, chest and back. I was merely another possession."
She pins his writs above his head and pushes her huge cock into him. "Mm you always imagine me with such a huge cock, Daddy. Why is that?"
John wrestles with two very powerful emotions as he watches Sherlock. One part of him is so relieved, so elated. And one part of him is so angry he wants to wrap his hands around that delicate neck and squeeze. So he stays silent.
“Hush, my child. Rise. So long as you and all my other children live so do I.” Camille says softly, voice resonating off the walls almost like a chorus. “You are so young. Not even two hundred. So very very young. You hold so much contempt in your still heart. The humans are not at fault, child. You are brilliant. Use your knowledge. What poor little human could keep me trapped? None. They feared me. Respected me. I kept them safe. No, my child. The humans are not to blame. They may have killed me but my murder was one of us.”
"I don't trust him. There's something off about him." He looks back at Mycroft. "You're with me on this, right?"
"How about a drink before we talk?” George smiles and hand Greg and Mycroft drinks before passing them out to everyone else except to sky who declines.
“Mm alright.” She smirks and pushes two fingers into Riley. “Mm I can still feel Greg’s cum inside you. Maybe soon your breast will be filling up with milky like mummy’s.”
“Dominic and Leona.” Diōnē smiles. “The thing is, I’m dying, I’ve got cancer and I’m not going to be living much longer, and I’m able to pass my presence into unborn children. Now Leona has kindly offered to carry me, but I think that’s a decision for both of you to make.”
*If she knew she would say. You know how she always speaks her mind. And Mycroft isn’t my brother. He’s my fucking Sire. And at least he cares for my wellbeing. He banished her because he was lying to her and couldn’t break the lie. Your mother could have wrote to you. But she didn’t. What does that tell you about her?* Sherlock furiously types back.
Mycroft whimpers softly when Athena starts to rub his back. He breaks down, his head dropping into his hands as his shoulders shake with quiet sobs.
"It's alright, Greg. The hit man didn't even get into the first ring of you father's protection circles. I got to him first. This is what I'm here for." Sky smiles reassuringly.
"How naughty, Daddy. Wanting your little girl to have more babies for you. Your babies." She smirks, moaning as she sinks down onto his hard cock.
"Alright, alright. Calm down." He chuckles softly and moves his pants out of the way. "So beautiful." He reaches out to stroke him teasingly.
Flopping down on the bed he places the bag on his stomach and sighs. "I want you back... it's been a month. If it weren't for these calls..."
He follows him to the bathroom and starts the shower. He kisses and nips at Greg's neck as the shower heats up. "Mm so sexy."
Mycroft smiles. “Then we better not let them see my stash, Crys. It’s taken me years to accumulate all this.” He smiles and carries Crystal out of the room and locks the door, before putting her down.
"Gladstone will too. Because of course, Percy will do it. So they'll be lots of taste testing involved. Which reminds me, his lungs aren't the best but I need to start taking him for a short jog. Gladstone is getting chunky with all this extra food." John laughed then amended, "Chunkier. He's never been a slim dog. But I don't want him to get diabetes or heart disease just because we love feeding him."
Mycroft hummed in response. He was keeping a watch on the CCTV, of course. "Good. The team are still sweeping the flat, and Mrs Hudson kindly kept them fed and watered with currant buns and tea." You could almost hear the rolling of his eyes. "You should be able to move back in in two days, granted they don't find anything else that may raise alarm. No stashes of cocaine or Morphine they need worry about?"
Mycroft smirks. "Thought so." He goes to where John is on the couch and mumbles into his ear about what Sherlock wants.
John slowly opens Sherlock’s trousers and pushes them down with his pants. “I’ll put these in the dirty clothes hamper and get something to wipe you off with.” John smiles and takes Sherlock’s soiled clothes. He puts them in the hamper and comes back with a damp flannel. He wipes Sherlock cleans and goes back to the bathroom, washing his hands after tossing the flannel in the hamper.
Sherlock blushes as he notices that John is awake, pretending to sleep, wanting to stay close to him.
"Mr Holmes." John greeted him, smiling. "My name is Doctor Watson, but you're free to call me 'John', if you prefer."
"The club where all his victims frequented before their deaths." Sherlock murmured offhandedly. "Mort de l'âme"
He smirks, starting to fuck him hard and fast, the arm of the couch angling Michael's hips perfectly so Greg can pound into him as deep as he wants.
They use his holes, pounding into him. “You love being stuffed full, don’t you?” Violet purrs and kisses his cock.
“If you asked me for it, I would have to comply. But I like this right now.” Sherlock says softly, curious to how much John understood.
“You’re going to need my blood. My... human blood.” Camille says, reading the ritual. “That will give you more power. Something he loved.” She smiles at Anthea. “We have another set of tireless eyes to help research. You need sleep.” Camille says softly. “I have a feeling something big is going to happen to you soon.”
John helps her get the bath started, leaving her to turn it off when it's full. He's glad for the distraction, not wanting to answer anymore questions because he's not sure what else there is to say. For an eight year old, she's incredibly clever and quick witted. While she's bathing, he takes the passcodes for all the streaming services that Sherlock gave him earlier and enters them onto his laptop. He's just finished doing this when she emerges, fresh and clean and wearing her pajamas. "I thought we could watch your program about the bees." He suggests, setting the laptop on the dresser beside the small bed.
She moans loudly into the kiss, her cunt throbbing and her breasts giving more milk as she’s fucked.
"Mm aren't you radiant as ever, my darling." Collin smiles and kisses his wife. "Oh hush." Carol blushes and giggles happily.
She leans in and kisses her before pulling her dress up off her, leaving her only in her panties since she didn’t wear a bra.
He whimpers and kisses him back deeply. “Did I do good, Daddy?” He mumbles softly against his lips, voice a bit hoarse.
Lydia goes into Sherlock's room carrying some new bandages for his head. "I think it's about time we unwrap you and have a look." She smiles and pulls on some gloves.
“I was suspended for fighting. The others were let off with a warning because they were following their instincts. I was a freak who didn’t want to rape my helpless classmate.” Sherlock shakes his head.
Sherlock crosses his legs, to hide his growing erection. He had never even thought about putting anything but a cock into an arse, he really was behind the times. His muscles clench around his hole, at the idea of John probing him with his tongue. He nods, not daring to open his mouth, in case he moans.
"Don't worry until there's somethin to worry about." He hums. "Just make sure the sample cup lid is screwed on tight, huh?" He chuckles and cuffs him on the shoulder.
“Mmhmm.” Sky smiles and turns on the light to the huge walk in closet. “Anything you want to wear, wear it.” She grins.
He groans as Mycroft presses their hips together. "You are everything to me and more. So much more."
Greg sneezes and blows his nose into the tissue. "Thank you. I feel terrible and I sound ridiculous. All this sniffling and dripping. Ick I'm grossing myself out with my own grossness. How can you stand me?"
“And that’s why I was the best spy.” John smiles. “Sex has always been the best weapon. I would do it with the General’s wife a lot and soon she would have been coming to me, willing to tell me information to get fucked in return, as a reward.”
"Hmm.." He hums and kisses his collarbone. "Mm how about you fuck me over the kitchen table?" He nips at his neck.
With the newly discovered void in his life, John begins to find ways to spend his time. One morning, after kissing Sherlock goodbye and telling him not to anger Anderson, John sits alone in the flat. Taking out his mobile he fiddles with the device before following through with his plan
"I love it, Daddy!" He whimpers, trying to buck against his finger. "You make me feel amazing. So bloody fully. I love it."
He pushes himself off from the doorframe, moving to hold her hips from behind. "You should still have someone holding the bag."
“For a case at first and then you were interesting and..” Sherlock tails off. “You made things not boring.”
Anthea nods and kisses Molly’s head. “It’s okay. Everything is fine, love. I know it’s a little early but it’s okay.”
*Love, there’s nothing for you to be jealous about. You know I love you. That you’re the only mad man for me. It’s only a few more days.-JW*
He shakes a bit, having been in the interrogation room gave him flashbacks from being captured and tortured.
Greg pulls him into a hug, not talking just holding him there trying to sooth and comfort him the best he can.
"She's eight centimetres." A female doctor says, checking Molly. "Ms Hooper, have you been experiencing labour pains for long?"
She moans and arches, rocking back into him. 'You know you can always have me. Whenever you want. You just have to say the word.'
It wasn't the best idea. Ultimately it solved nothing. Omegas were bought off before their first heats, he'd gone nearly 17 years past his first heat before meeting Sherlock. How many would miss out on happiness still, despite their best efforts?
"Still isn't my favourite scent. But," John admits, “I can't deny it adds flavour. When... When did you know I was an Omega?" He asks after a while. He'd always wanted to know.
Sherlock frowns. “John, I’m not the best at doctoring, but either the blood lose is affecting you, or... I don’t know what else. Please.” He says softly. “Tell me what’s wrong. Do you feel weak at all?”
"You're so fucking needy. You've already had Mycroft and Sherlock use your pretty arse and you still want my cock filling you up. We're going to the pub tonight and I know you're going to drink. You get so horny and needy when you drink. I might just have to drag you to the bathroom and fuck you.." He growls as he thrusts.
“If you’re asking, Dr. Watson you already know.” Sherlock forks a piece of orange chicken and eats it.
Greg screams and pulls the wires from his arms and unsteadily gets out of bed. He makes it out of the room and puts out a small silver necklace with a cross on, to try to keep everyone away.
He growls and fucks him hard. Their moans and mewls are the only thing louder than the harsh delicious slap of skin on skin.
Their plan being, that John and Harriet would have a public argument and Mycroft would swoop in and take the
"Yeah can you pour the vegetables on top of the pasta and mix the whole thing?" She pours the cooked pasta into a large bowl.
One of the many perks that came along with the curse that was longevity, was having the time to perfect his
John steps into the bath, allowing his feet to get used to the heat of the water before easing himself down to sit. "Whatever suits you." He murmured, stifling another yawn.
She kisses him back and nips at his lip. 'The next time it's your turn if you get the ball in I'll let you have a reward. Whatever you want.' She says in his head and smirks.
Mycroft bites his lip and nods. “I suppose so. How heavy is it?” He asks nodding to Sherlock’s stomach.
Sherlock just hums and looks out of the window, as the unfamiliar streets pass by. “Is it strange, for a vampire to be so devoted and... love their Sire so much? Love him like a parent.” He asks softly. “John doesn’t like it.”
Sherlock drifts in and out of consciousness as he's taken to the hospital. He remembers seeing John sitting by him in the ambulance, holding his hand. He remembers getting to the hospital and being put under as they start the surgery. The next thing he remembers is waking up in a hospital bed.
“It’s not your fault. He was a professional con man. Your thoughts and feelings towards him were valid.” Anthea says softly. “And I’m sorry that Selene will never meet her father but she has you. And she has me. And Mycroft and Greg.”
Mycroft kissed him back, happily. "I know... I know it seems rushed, but... We've known each other a long time and... You're so good to me..." He murmured.
"Shut up you prat!" Anderson snaps and trips over his own feet. His steaming hot coffee goes flying and spills all over Greg's chest. "Fucking hell!" Greg yelps and scrambles to pull of the hot soaking shirt. "Christ sorry Greg... Whore?" Anderson says. "Tainted?" Donovan and Anderson read his bare chest. Greg pales and his arms fly over his chest to cover himself. He steps back away from them.
“Still not full enough baby? Do you want my cock in your arse as well?” Collin smirks, stroking himself.
“Please please, Master. I’ll take it. Any cock. Anything that wants to breed me.” She whimpers and blushes brightly. “I can shift into anything. I’ll let anything that wants to fuck me have my cunt.” She whines, gushing around his cock. “What do you want to fuck me?”
He chuckles. “He liked the idea and approached John about it later. It kinda just took off from there.”
Mycroft smirks as he hangs up. He moves to Sky, pushing the plug back into her cunt. “Mm, lets go get Sherlock and then we’ll walk to the club.”
Sherlock was about to get in. “Oh I didn’t get something to clean us. Hold on.” He goes to the bathroom and comes back with a damp washcloth. He cleans John up and then himself before tossing the cloth in the direction of the bathroom before getting into bed next to John.
"Good. I found two lotions. Vanilla and lavender. Which one would you like?" She shows him the bottles.
Margaret comes in and smiles softly. “I just wanted to talk for a bit. About.. About what Sherlock and I were talking about earlier.”
“I’ll handle it as quickly as I can. Things are different now. They’ve been different since you limped into my life. They’ve been different since we bonded. I wouldn’t take back any of it.” Sherlock says softly. “I don’t have anything if I don’t have you.”
"Which is why we need to take calculated risks. John is not a delicate flower, nor does he appreciate being treated like one. Something tells me if we include him in our plans and let him weigh in. He'd be more than willing to help. Plus, it isn't as if I can expect him to sit here quietly. He has a job, and a life, Sherlock."
Sherlock blinks not finding it funny. “Surname?” He asks, ready to run back to 221B as soon as he got her name.
He shakes himself mentally, this always happens. Always. He was stupid to think he could hide it from John. “I’m a vampire John.” He whispered, it’s barely audible, but he lets the words hang in the air. “That blood wasn’t for experiments but for me to live on. I feed once a day, and I’ve not fed today because of the fridge breaking.” He explains after a long pause. He waits patiently for John to ether explode in rage and fury or walk out and leave. Everybody always does.
Mycroft blushes and presses their heads together. "You deserve everything. Everything and so much more." He frowns a bit. "I'm sorry you didn't see that before.."
“When I came here. More than two dozen of your... things tried to kill me. I’ll most likely be murdered here as well.” Greg snaps.
"Mum, has anyone recently told you how bloody brilliant you are?" John asks while pressing his shoulder against hers. "You should have been a doctor. You would have been the most sought after doctors for Omegas."
Sky's phone starts ringing. "Mm hello, Veronica." Sky hums. "Mm hello, you sexy bitch." Veronica laughs.
John wakes slowly a bit later. He looks down at Sherlock and smiles softly, thinking he’s still asleep.
“Oh no. I’ve made it very clear that we’re coming back as soon as this is over. He... Adjusting is a little rough. He says everything seems so much louder and faster now. But he enjoyed the plane ride.” Sherlock says softly. “He wants to get back to your mum and you as soon as he can. He also wants to meet my parents.” He sighs.
“I know. Most likely a sniper while you were trying to rescue a fallen comrade.” Sherlock nods. “Though I haven’t seen the scar I assume entry from the back to the front.”
"Come." Mycroft orders as he strokes him and thrusts into him hard and fast, hitting his prostate mercilessly.
"Really, Gregory, was that..." He inhales sharply. "*Really* necessary?" He pockets the phone again.
Sherlock moans, rocking up against John. It was nothing like before. It was so good. So euphoric. “So good John. So good.”
"So you're going to have breakfast with us?" Rosie smiles at him, then looks at John who is currently still asleep, tucked between Sherlock and the back of the couch, head resting on the other man's chest.
“Sorry, love. Your heath is one of the most important things to me. I’m not going to let you participate in any activity that might hurt you further until your well again. Doctors orders.”
"Then... please don't refer to yourself as any of those horrible names." John murmured. "You're beautiful, and worthy of love."
Mycroft hums non-commentedly. He goes into his office and locks the door, between him and Magdala. He manages to sit down, before starting to cry.
“If you’re sure.” Greg says softly, closing his eyes. He relaxes in her arms, before starting to snore quietly.
"Mm that's nice of him. I really must thank him one of these days. If it weren't for him you would have never saved me form myself."
He blushes brighter and nods. "You know I can handle cock, Daddy. I took three cocks at the same time today, big ones."
Mel strips with Turks help. “Hohn would you like to learn how to do this too?” Turk asks, belong Mel Sir ip on the edge of the exam table.
Lydia moans and whimpers. She rocks against Anthea's head and bites her lip. She kisses her desperately and holds her hips. "Anthea.. Yes.."
"Mm tie you up and fuck you for ages and punish you if you come before I give you permission? Yes I will." He strips John and lays him on the bed.
"She's already taken steps to protect you both. You just have to bare with her. That will be both of your greatest protection."
Sherlock smiles, “what’s it like, carrying a lot? How big were you when you carried seventeen?” He asks, imagining her belly the same width as the bed as she laid on her side.
“B-Brilliant.. love it.. feels so thick.. I can almost feel it throbbing inside me with each thrust.”
“You’re not listening. She’s never lifted a finger. All she does is give I orders. We take out armies. We wipe out nations. Us. We are her angels of death. All I did was disagree with her. What if she asks us to do something we cannot? What if she tells you to kill me for my insolence? Will you? Will you kill me because she asked you to?” Crystal tears up, so afraid.
“Good, because honestly, I don’t think I could take it,” John admits, not looking at Sherlock as he says it. “You’re doing great,” he encourages, brushing past the statement.
Anthea pets her hair. “I promise to wear a condom from now on.” She teases gently, trying to help Molly relax.
Leona smirks and holds back a giggle. “Poor mother having to birth something so big. I’d put it off for as long as possible as well.” She says seriously.
James smirks and pushes into John's arse with Brian. "Fuck. Listen to you. Such a dirty little whore." George smirks. "Who knew he was such a slit. Always acting like a tough guy. Look at him now. Drooling for cock." Cecil smirks, literally wiping the drool off his chin and pushing his thumb into John's mouth
“He was aiding and abetting torture and kidnappings. I’m more concerned about their relationship afterwards.” Camille sighs. “I don’t know why he didn’t stop them.”
“Which do you want first? Three boys or three girls? I’m going to have three and keep the other three. Do you want sons or daughters first?”
"Have you ever done it before or was that your first time?" He squeezes his hips gently and nuzzles his thighs.
John steals a biscuit from Sherlock and winks at him while Mrs. H continues talking. "... And that's probably the best marital advise I ever revived.." Mrs. Hudson nods at herself. John looks at her because he wasn't paying close attention.
Sherlock frowns and pulls John into a hug. “That won’t happen. This bond that we have, you’re taking my strength like I’m taking yours. You’re not going to get old. You’re not going to die.” He whispers.
Mycroft glances between the two women, a small smile playing on his lips. He decides to leave it be for now. "Is he able to take visitors?"
“Hello, sweetie.” She smiles and presses back against him. “Icing?” She grins and holds a finger out, dripping with icing.
She moans loudly and comes hard around him, belly swelling quickly with the amount of cum he’s pumping into her.
"Not a problem." She smiles and goes to get the wheelchair. Greg goes back into Sherlock's room. "Lydia said we can go downstairs to eat." He smiles.
Diōnē smiles, “I know. I’m the same age as Camille, but she doesn’t think of me as one, nor my sister, I can’t call anyone a friend here bar my sister and you.” She says softly.
She whimpers softly and snuggles him. She's quiet for a few minutes trying to calm down. "They're talking to us.." She mumbles quietly. "I don't wanna leave.."
“Want to come whine I cut your air off?” He smirks thrusting hard a few times before cutting his air off again.
John and Sherlock join Mycroft at the door. Max frowns deeply at Greg and looks upset that he's leaving. "I don't like him." Sherlock glares at Max.
“I thought you didn’t like to get your hands dirty,” John said, cringing as his voice came out hoarse and shaky. Moriarty threw his head back and laughed.
“Hello, Johnny,” a silky voice came from behind him. John froze compulsively. Of course. He couldn’t stop himself from jumping when a hand brushed across his lower back, smooth and cool. He craned his head around awkwardly, trying to get a bead on Moriarty. The man strolled into view with a Cheshire grin on his face. “Thanks for joining me,” he purred, gesturing to the barren, windowless room they were in. The walls were stark white, painted concrete not plaster; the floor was plain cement, but spotlessly clean. He couldn’t see the door, so it must be behind him.
“Make me stop,” Moriarty taunted. He reached down with his other hand and slipped it between them, feeling for John’s opening. John yelped again, feeling as though he might vomit. Moriarty twirled one finger around the rim, exalting in John’s furrowed brow and terrified eyes. “Don’t be embarrassed that you have an erection, John,” he said loudly.  “I’m flattered.” John yelled wordlessly, too horrified to find speech. Moriarty pushed one slim fingertip past the rim and inside him, and finally John lost his nerve.
happen? No offense, John-boy, I love you like my schnauzer, but that’s the extent of your appeal. You’re so very dull. No wit, no edge, no… sparkle,” Moriarty lyricized, obviously trying to get a rise out of John. "Granted, now that I’ve seen what you’re working with, I understand at least part of it,” he added with a wink. John trembled slightly in rage and embarrassment, but still kept his lips pressed tightly together. Seeing the reaction he craved, Moriarty again drew close and ran his hand down John’s bare back, sending a shiver of disgust up his spine. “Yes, very well put together,” he simpered. Then he backed a step, and John breathed a sigh of relief.
“Oh John, I love it when you beg.” He slipped a second finger inside and began working them in and out, luxuriating in his victim’s groans of discomfort. “You’re so tight back here, John. You’re making me wonder which of you is really the virgin.” He suddenly froze, his face lighting up with glee. “Don’t tell me you’ve been
John awoke in pain. His back and shoulders were burning, and his fingers were numb. He tried to shift his position and groaned. He’d obviously been lying like this for some time. His feet were on the ground, and he seemed to be bent forward on his stomach, his hands above his head, his shoulders down awkwardly lower than his hips. He blinked his eyes a few times, seeing something soft and brown. It was leather. He was on a brown leather sofa, draped across one arm. He stiffened, drawing his breath in with a hiss. He was completely naked. He quickly tried to get up. His ankles were each tied to a leg of the couch, and his hands, stretched taught above his head, were held a by rope tied to the legs at the opposite end. This was bad.
“NO.” John shouted. “Stop.” Moriarty went faster, stroking John as he pushed into him. John felt a growing pressure behind his pubic bone, in spite of all the pain. This couldn’t happen. He wouldn’t let it happen. Moriarty was running his fingers through his hair, tugging on it, lightly scraping his fingernails over his neck and shoulders. His skin was getting more sensitive. No, this wasn’t sex. This was torture.  Moriarty was leaning into his ear again, his hot breath making it tingle.
“Not my type, though,” Moriarty said, the lascivious note gone from his voice. “I rarely have time to indulge in the pleasures of the flesh. This is strictly business. I made Sherlock a promise, as you know, and I can’t help but feeling a little HURT,” he shouted the word, making John jump, “that he’s been off having himself a good time without me. Hurt and, I suppose, just the teensiest bit jealous.” His eyes had a carnivorous glint, and John couldn’t repress a chill of fear. “Not of you of course; as I said you bore me. But I can’t have Sherlock going off and being
Moriarty roared in the ecstasy of his victory. He had broken Sherlock’s little pet doctor, snapped him right in two. His eyes rolled back in his head as he came, as much with the pleasure of triumph as sexual stimulation. He spilt himself into the limp and sobbing man, relishing the slimy, unclean feeling of it. He thrust a few times more, enjoying every last shudder he imparted to John. Then finally he pulled out, admiring the trickle of blood and semen that came out after him. He smiled wolfishly. He had really torn the poor boy up. He pulled his trousers closed, damp now in the front. He retrieved a folding knife from his pocket and cut the ropes holding his victim’s legs apart, then rounded the couch to stand by his head. His eyes were closed tight, his breath coming in gasps, his face pressed into the cushions. Moriarty smoothed his sweat-drenched hair back from his forehead, causing him to flinch.
“Sherlock will kill you if you touch me.” John felt slightly encouraged as his voice came out strong and steady this time. “No more games, no more puzzles. He will put a bullet in your brain no matter what.” Moriarty laughed again, this time with absolutely no amusement. He bent closer to John and breathed into his ear.
“A valiant effort, Johnny, very good! And quite correct, I don’t. But due to the-“ he stroked one finger up John’s thigh- “personal nature of this issue, I’m making an exception.” John was now shaking uncontrollably. Even Moriarty could not be this insane, this over-the-top. He had to know this was too far. Sherlock would not be playing any games if this sort of thing were part of it, even if he and John hadn’t been… more than friends now.
“What’s this, my darling?” He whispered sibilantly in his ear, curling his body around John’s. John yelped and tried to jerk away, but Moriarty twisted him painfully until he stopped. “Ooh, you’re a dirty little whore. You like a little bit of pain with your pleasure, do you? You must, if you like Sherlock.” Moriarty ran his tongue up John’s neck and stuck it in his ear, drawing a sound of disgust from him. He began to stroke his member.
, little Johnny!” John gave no answer, only breathed heavily. “Oh my God, it’s too good!” Moriarty crowed. “Have you stuck your cock in our beautiful Sherlock yet, or is he waiting for the wedding night?” Moriarty tittered in amusement at his own joke. “You two are so precious, I just can’t STAND it!” He dug his fingernails into John’s hips as he said it, eliciting a yelp from him. “Can you do something for me?” He leant forward over John and seized him by the hair, yanking his head back painfully. “Can you smile for the camera?” John’s eyes widened in horror as they finally focused on the video camera hanging right above him, taking it all in. Then he screamed in overwhelming agony as Moriarty entered him with brutal force. He felt his body resist, tear, and then give way in a fraction of a second. He shuddered violently as he tried to process the feeling of the other man inside him. “That’s good,” Moriarty said with a happy sigh. “I wanted Sherlock to be able to see your face when I took your virginity.” He held John’s head up still as he pulled back then thrust forward once more. John screamed again as he felt his torn insides stretching, the painfully intense pressure overwhelming him.
He was not expecting the sudden sharp bite of pain across the back of his thighs as something thin and flexible struck him, and he yelped in spite of himself. Moriarty chuckled, pleased, and struck John with the switch again. This time John bit back the sound, steadying himself against the sting. However, he could not stop himself from jumping each time the cane struck him, as he never knew when or where it was going to strike. Even when he craned his head back painfully far, he could only just see Moriarty standing there leering at him, not the implement he held in his hands. Moriarty struck him over and over, producing bright red welts across his thighs, and even breaking the skin a few times. John bucked and strained at the ropes, not noticing as he did that he was rubbing against the soft leather arm of the sofa every time. He wasn’t even aware he was hard until Moriarty suddenly reached around and grabbed him roughly.
A violin, unlike the alpha, had seen before, practically gleamed against the royal blue velvet. Shaking pale fingers caressed the delicate neck and slightly rusted strings.
Sherlock smiling sat down in the plush cushioned chair only to shoot back up with a yelp of pain tears welling in his eyes.
“And your name. Sir?” The way in which the female omega said the honnor of sir made it seem like anything but a pleasant thing.
Sherlock writhed in pleasure keening brokenly, face collapsing into the mattress and screaming in pleasure. The moment the swollen knot locked them together the boy shouted and came John biting deep into the back of his neck and pumping the omega full with his seed.
“Mine, MINE! my mate.” John snarled losing himself in his alpha.  “Claim, knot, bond, breed.” He whispered under his breath thrusting with a sharp snap of his hip at each word.
John stood in a slightly dim room, a platform covered in harsh light waiting for the omega slaves to be paraded across. He felt uncomfortable, his leg aching for no particular reason other than to annoy him. He would be taking one of the poor souls home with him… despite the fact that he didn’t desire to do so. That had been made very clear the moment he had protested to the beta woman in charge.
The boy threw back his head and howled as John’s finger stroked over his sensitive lubrication gland.
The ex-solider looked back at the boy. He was so young and small. The alpha pressed his lips together and sighed internally plucking up an Indiana Jones film and quickly put it back down. The cracking of a whip was not going to help his omega calm down. Instead, he chose a random musical that he knew would be free for violence.
Moments later a powerfully built man slightly shorter than John but larger than a beta rushed into the room wearing a white lab coat and dress slacks.
A huge man well over six feet and face covered in tattoos stared down at the boy, fingers digging painfully into the boy’s shoulder. Sherlock to his credit did not flinch. John’s laughed had died his face turning blank.
“I’m yourth.” Sherlock whispered and only yelped slightly when John seized his arse with both hands squeezing.
“Please?” John asked. The assenting nod was quick. John smiled and peeled off his trousers and pants.
Mrs Hudson was not home it appeared so John tugging guilty ascended the stairs his omega slave following behind. Closing the door behind them John set down the duffle and turned to kneel by his omega. Both kneeling they were closer in height but John still had nearly six inches on the boy. Seeming to notice this the boy hunched his shoulders ducking his head to make himself even smaller.
“I’m not entirely sure I am free from that danger here” The dark-haired boy murmured back to John, pressing himself against the older man’s arm.
“You were military.” John looked up sharply to catch the boy staring unabashedly as John’s abs. Sherlock flushed and looked away.
The omega could wear john’s own clothes until shopping was possible. Stirring in the pasta John flipped open the file.
“Oh,” Sherlock wriggled on the hard plastic bench. “I don’t think they’d care. They wouldn’t expect an Alpha to notice them.”
“Y-yo-you want me to pick my punishment?” The omega turned to look at John for the first time eyes wide and fearful, picking his own punishment was the last thing he wanted to do. If he picked something too severe John would be sad if he picked something too gentle the alpha would be angry.
Pulling the curled up omega to his black and white jumper striped chest John laughed. “We really do need to get dressed now.”
Glad of the fact he had worn a shirt beneath his jumper the alpha tugged off his oatmeal coloured cloth and pulled it gently over the omega’s shocked expression. The jumper was huge on the thin boy falling to cover the tops of his thighs and hanging over his fingertips. Smiling sadly John rose to his feet and due to the aching of his shoulder, allowed the boy to crawl behind him.
Sherlock shifted again pressing his thighs together and trying to catch John’s eye. The blond was, however, staring at a rack of soft furled leather collars intently.
So for people asking why I won't be updating as much: One, school is starting back soon and I've got a lot of studying to do. Two, gymnastics and football. Three, I've got a secrect boyfriend... that my homophobic step-dad might literally kill me over if he found out about. and Four I've sortta become a nanny... or whatever it's called when a guy does it. I watch these kids all day on the weekends and stay at their house.
“I-I think I love you” The alpha took hold of the omega’s hips and quickly twisted so that the omega was laying on top of John's chest to chest eye to eye.
“Love that’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Look around there are plenty of male omegas right here in this section.”
John looked up at that, he hadn’t even checked to see if he had injured the omega, and with as hard as he had been hitting the boy there was a good possibility he had broken the skin. How had he not thought to check?
Pushing in, agonizingly slowly thick length streaching the boy's pink rim obseanly.  Sherlock grabbed onto the muscular shoulders and keened desperately bucking to impale hismelf further.
Sherlock leaned forward slightly but didn’t let go of John’s hand. Instead, he met Mrs Hudson’s gentle brown eyes and looked for any sign of ulterior-motive. Seeing none he gave the beta a small smile, bit his lower lip and ducked his head before whispering
“Yes love,” John murmured pulling the curly head back to his chest and sniffing the air appreciatively. The scent was of warm honey, old books, and permeated the air with pure happiness. The omega slowly stilled his circling fingers and dropped to sleep in the alpha’s lap.
“Hmmm” the teenager snuggled into the other man oblivious to the look of discomfort on the red-head’s face.
A middle-aged middle-eastern alpha and a thin somewhat familiar-looking red-haired omega in his mid 20’s.
The man only grinned a little wider and bit at the boy’s pale neck hand squeezing at the plush arse.
On the fourth morning, Sherlock woke as John slipped out of the omega and felt a familiar dull warmth in his abdomen.
“Sherlock…” he paused throat swelling with emotion. “Love, I’m not going to punish you… I don’t even know what you think you need punishing for!”
Sherlock walked on his own two feet, it still hurt slightly and he held onto John’s hand fiercely but he made it without John having to scoop up and carry him like on their trip to the table.
Sherlock slept the entire time it took for John to load up the few boxes and didn’t wake until the couple was pulling up at baker street. Sleepily the boy waved his hand at a random red haired omega man trailing behind his alpha and smiled. The omega did not smile back but did wave back eyebrows furrowed.
He should have expected it. John, after all, was an alpha. Even Sean had punished him sometimes. Not quite so angrily but then again Sherlock had been much younger then. He was 16 now though and he should be able to remember to pick up his things.
. John snorted because it was completely like Sherlock’s brother to be keeping security at the ready. He shrugged and ignored the spy. A few minutes later, the vehicle containing donations trundled off after the vehicle containing John’s things, followed by a final vehicle containing only humans.
. You want him back. I want you to be happy. My life is fucking shit, and it’s going to take a miracle of miracles for it ever to be right again. There’s a chance for you and I want you to get it. See, it hasn’t even been a fortnight and he’s selling his house and rushing back here to squeeze into a single room with his kid! You don’t think he couldn’t have found another situation
John once again did as he was told. His eyes fluttered shut as a very particular scent filled his nose and suddenly, it was as if he could read a symphony in the notes he detected. He knew this scent, lived around it every day but never had he taken the time to understand what it was made of. John knew the taste and the nuances of this scent, it told tales of travels to far lands, of pain and isolation, of curiosity and abiding passion. It reminded John of the complexity of vanilla, the resinous aroma of pine, the odd sting of something sourly astringent that only caused the rest of it to be that much sweeter. John knew the deep musky undertones, the dark burning spice of it, foreign and familiar at the same time. It was home and it was dangerous and it was everything John craved. He opened his eyes and stared at Sherlock, “You’re amazing.”
Peering through the crack between door and frame, Sherlock tried to deduce the smartly dressed person who was so deeply engaged in conversation with John. He was smiling, laughing a bit, and Sherlock burned with the need to know exactly what was going on between the two of them.
“You mean a more reliable alpha?” John couldn’t help the thread of anger and the implied insult stung him far more deeply than he could have expected. Sherlock was safe with him except that he wasn’t, not if last night’s behaviour counted against John, and in his view, it ought to. Guilt made him almost snarl, “You don’t have to worry about me, Mycroft. I’m engaged to someone, and I have more than enough self-control to resist bedding an omega while he’s unconscious and unable to say yes.”
agreed to be her godfather, and apparently, unannounced continuing impositions that made it impossible for him to work on cases were part of the job. Now, neither he nor John had time for
“My dearest Sherlock, we have so much catching up to do. Whilst your soldier goes to refresh himself, lets you and I enjoy some
There was a discrete tap on the door. John let Sherlock dress in the scrubs before he answered it. The plug was ridged enough that Sherlock was very aware of its presence and gave him a pretty good idea of what he could expect. Mary stood there with a sheet of paper which she handed to John, her eyes on the floor respectfully. “Thank you, nurse.” John said before he absently closed the door on her face, not saying a thing about her freshly applied lipstick, or noticing the poisonous glare she shot at Sherlock. “Thank goodness for modern technology, right?” Several recent inventions had made blood analyse nearly instantaneous, the days and weeks of waiting for results now outdated. John looked very pleased, “Excellent, that makes everything so much easier.”
“Yes, I do. You love it too.” Sherlock really did enjoy Danny’s company. He was only the second person that Sherlock had ever met who he liked to be with. Danny was amusing, sharp, observant, and ruthlessly driven when he was engaged. Danny was dedicated to the idea of re-educating John about Sherlock’s needs and was dead set on showing the soldier how to be with Sherlock properly. That they both relished their intimacy was merely icing on their reality cake.
They didn’t sleep together, not even just to rest. They certainly didn’t kiss. Sometimes they sat on the sofa together but even then it wasn’t more than just sitting side by side. Holding hands wasn’t on, not yet, at least. Both men were jumpy, frazzled, and always on the edge of falling completely apart. John was in therapy but then, so was Sherlock. He was a complete wreck after everything that had happened in the last few years, and the world’s only consulting detective finally admitted that he couldn’t sort himself out without ongoing help. He was seeing Ella because she knew John and their more recent problems were intertwined, but they weren’t in couple’s therapy, not yet anyway. There were so many hurdles that they needed to overcome before they could take the next step that they’d decided that they needed to put a pin in their developing relationship, at least until at least one of them could make it through the week without screaming themselves awake at night due to nightmares, or having panic attacks at the market, or an unhappy variety of other problems that had not gone away yet. It was a bit of a bother.
She moans loudly and arches, rocks against his face. She bobs her head, playing with his bollocks in her hand.
It feels like a weight has been lifted from Sherlock’s chest. John doesn’t find him too strange or horrible after all. He keeps his tea close to his chest, letting it warm up his chest and heart.
A little while later, John was sitting in the living room, Sherlock got up. He wandered to the bathroom and turned on the tub.
Mycroft's eyes widen when he sees them. "I.. Sh-Sherlock.." He licks his lips as he locks eyes with Sherlock.
John keeps an eye on Sherlock as he texts Greg. He lets Greg know where they are and what is going on.
Mycroft wraps his arms around Crystal, before sinking his fangs deeply into her arm. He drinks and drinks, knowing that Crystal will have to push him off before he can stop.
Sherlock smiles as he keeps John close. “Hey Lydia, a little birdy told me you like dolls.” He says softly.
Sherlock frowns as he feels what Camille feels, he doesn’t understand it, there is definitely hope and love there. But there’s something else too, it could be fear or dread, he’s not sure. “Did he ever hurt you?” Sherlock whispers.
"Yeah. Said he came right from the airport. Said he would have called but he missed you so much he just decided to come." Collin smiles.
"God you look like such a god damn whore. Just a public slut for anyone's use. Maybe we shouldn't have locked the restaurant up, made it so anyone could walk in and see you like this."
Sherlock nods and stands. “Walk?” He asks, nodding to the path around the playground so they can walk and keep an eye on Rosie.
She bites her lip. 'I suppose not. But I can carry your child. Grow a person inside of me that's yours and mine since it's in me. That's what being pregnant is. Carrying the life of a person that you and your partner want.'
“You don’t have anyone else that can go. Besides Mycroft trained me. I’m the most qualified person for the job. I did.. Do his leg work.” Anthea nods.
"I want Daddy's fingers.." She whispers and blushes brightly, knowing Mycroft is an amazing piano player and his fingers are very very well trained.
The cubs run around his feet and between his legs chasing each other. “They’re twins. That is the male and that is the female chasing him.” Sam chuckles.
"Mm look at you. Fucking her like you can't resist it. Like you can't live without it." Lydia smirks.
Sherlock nods. “It’s just about relaxing together.” He says softly and strips down to his pants before laying face down on the massage table, aware that his back was on display.
"Sherlock stop!" Donovan yells and pulls Sherlock off Anderson. Anderson lays in a whimpering heap on the floor.
"Really." She smiles. "Lil Crofty. I think Mycroft will get a kick out of it." She smiles and kisses Michael.
“It was good,” the detective agreed, rubbing his stomach, “We can walk it off a bit. If I go to bed now I’ll be far too excited to sleep.” Then, catching himself he blushed and said around a slight laugh, “Excited for tomorrow, I mean. The boat."
John smiles, “How about you get Sherlock to do some work, and you can teach me some magic?” He asks softly, not wanting to move from her arms.
Greg laughs and plops onto the couch. he watches him bend to pick a movie and he whistles, laughing and picks up his food container.
Carol smiles happily and steals a kiss before going to the shady seat out of the pathway to feed Cara.
She moans loudly and comes hard suddenly. "Yes yes. Anything you want." She rocks back against him still needing more.
Sherlock nods. “Good. Really good. Crystal helped me a lot. I fell back she took it into herself tough. Is she okay?”
The nurse glanced over her shoulder. "Erm... well, you and... Mr Holmes... you were getting quite *close*, if you get my meaning..." She chewed her lip. "You woke up, seemed to forget him for a bit and...." She tilted her head to the side. "Matron was joking she might have to turn the hose on you." She gave a queer little smirk.
Sherlock smiles as he feels John fall asleep against him. As they get to the hotel, Sherlock goes in and orders them a room, before going back to the car and carry John and their two backpacks into their room. He lays John down in the middle of the bed and wraps his in all the blankets possible.
“I promise.” Crystal smiles and kisses Greg. She pulls back and runs her hands over his chest. “Warm..”
"Mm you'd be even smarter if you used protection but then again they all think I'm a gold digging whore so." She chuckles and shrugs.
Sherlock sits back, looking at his clasped hands. He takes a deep breath, waiting for the nurse to leave.
She smiles and nods, taking his hand and leading him into the living room where all the girls are relaxing with Samuel as Mel.
“Sherlock they can’t just stick you in prison with a bunch of raspiest and murderers. You’re still a minor you should be in school”
John ran a hand through the dark curls smiling sadly as he toyed with them. Watching as they sprung back into place under his fingers.
The omega’s pink bow lips parted and tears started filling his eyes. Damn the hormones making him cry about everything
Secondly, that would make him look weak. Well, even weaker than John already thought he was. And weak omega’s were nothing but toys, that he had learned at age ten when he started his first heat.
Plopping the butter and herbs without ceremony into the pasta the muscular alpha took a deep breath through his nose and out his mouth making mental plans for the rest of the night.
Settling on the bench John allowed the omega to scoot closer sitting between the taller alpha’s knees as he unlocked the heavy chains. The omega instantly rubbed at his wrists gratefully nuzzling into John’s thigh with a pleased whimper. With a sad smile the alpha pet the dirty hair and leaned to help the naked body into the joggers, thumbs brushing against razor-sharp hip bones John frowned. There were rules regarding feeding omega slaves. The boy should not be this thin.
Nodding politely to the two omegas still seated on the blanket the tall alpha spun on heel and nearly marched away.
”No, no stop, shhhh, you don’t have to stand.” John soothed dropping to a crouch and gently petting the silky curls. Understanding dawned to the larger alpha, the boy would have felt his anger at the two handlers and not known whom it was directed at maybe even think it was directed at him.
The kiss remained slow and tender and when John’s tongue asked for entrance Sherlock didn’t hesitate to allow the gentle probing with a low moan of pleasure. The pheromones of happy omega and alpha drenched the air. Gently John trailed his fingers across the sharp bone structure of Sherlock's face and hummed contentedly into the younger man’s mouth.
“Here so you’ll have some light.” The boy looked up at John in amazement his bow lips parting slightly in awe. Tears instantaneously began to trickle down from the green-blue eyes as the young man hugged the light to his jumper clad chest humming slightly. His scent changed growing sweeter, happier as the omega turned to nuzzle his face into the alpha’s hand and settle contentedly on the floor of the boot.
Here it is people. Everyone has been asking for smutt and I hope this works. I've never actually written something like this before but I tried. Please advise! Friendly comments, questions, and suggestions are more than welcome!
Unable to tear his eyes away or make a sound Mike felt the overwhelming urge to push John off and mount the omega as well as a stilling fear due to of the much stronger highly dominant alpha rutting against the bed. Sheets and duvet lay hanging off the mattress as the two bare bodies on the bed hummed in sync, pale legs twitching on either side of tan wait and buttocks.
“No Sherlock, love I told you it wasn’t your fault I shouldn’t have spanked you over something so stupid.”
“I’m thorry, mathter” The number of times John had felt like being sick was to numeral to count so John simply stood taking the collar and lead with him and walking deeper into the flat.
The couple ended up adding an eyeliner pencil, powder, and clear lipgloss to the trolley before leaving the section and joining the queue.
“Yes, Love?” The blond alpha tightened his arm around his omega’s bare shoulders drawing the thin body to his own under the duvet.
He promised to never sell the boy, he taught Sherlock music, asking the omega to spend hours a day on the violin until he perfected it. He promised to bond with the omega once he hit his first heat, he never raised a hand in anger against Sherlock unless he had been particularly disobedient. In truth, if there was a master Sherlock had truly loved it had been Sean.
“Oy bit of a mouthful there.” The raven-haired boy nodded his sliver eyes still fixed on the little pup with a touch of longing. He sated himself with putting a hand over his belly and feeling the life within’s happy thrum.
“Well obviously, I’d hardly be offering to suck your cock if I were not gay or at the very least bisexual.”
“Alrighth…” the omega sighed nuzzling his face into the indentation of warmth John had left on the sofa.
John bit his lip accepting the leather lead from one of the slavers and a black duffle from the other with a slight snarl of “Mine” directed at the handlers and turned to leave.
Inside the shop, Sherlock mostly kept his face buried in John’s neck except when John asked him a question and even then the omega would only look briefly and then hide his face as he thought before giving John an answer.
He wouldn’t touch the boy unless he was certain it was entirely consensual, wanted, and clear-headed. The water quickly filled up the tub and John found himself once against standing over his tiny omega. He didn’t want the boy to crawl like a dog, and with his feet slashed like they were he certainly wasn’t going to force him to walk.
The captain felt the exact moment his omega fell asleep and then proceeded to lavish the markings of the collar bruises with kisses. They weren’t bonded yet but John skill felt compelled to try and kiss away the pain.
“Mathter? pleathe don’t mathter?” The boy extended his legs reluctantly while still twitching back and trying to keep his feet away from the large alpha.
Opening the door John tugged gently at the lead bringing the omega into the foyer and shouting “Mrs Hudson I’m home!” The young man let out a high pitched yelp and curled at John’s feet hands clutching his head in the same fashion he had when first brought to John.
Reaching tenderly John cupped a single pale foot in one hand and immediately understood the boy’s fear. The pale feet had been caned quite recently and quite badly, open slashes torn across the delicate soles, dirt and pebbles in the open flesh.
“NO!” John snarled finding himself aghast “No,” he repeated softer. “I would never terminate a life.”
“Yeth Jawn” the boy whispered. “I don’t know how but…” the dark-haired boy sunk to the floor stretching out his neck for the older omega.
Looking up he saw John exiting the bedroom in a battered Beetles t-shirt and jeans, hair ruffled, lips swollen.
After tea, he decided and quickly gulped down his own drink impatiently. Gently hushing the omega’s whimpering with a tender caress of his curls John tugged down the jogging pants and ran a hand around the abused ankles and lower calves. The skin was mostly scabbed over from long use but traces of blood were still visible.
Soft coco coloured skin contrasted drastically with the boy’s own pale arms. The pups dark eyes blinked up at Sherlock and smiled with the few teeth he possessed.
“Oh,” Sherlock whispers. “Oh, are we going to do something for her?” He asks softly. “She’s been heartbroken for so long. And being... dead, that must have been hard for her.”
Sherlock nods, ‘I will Crystal. You’re my inspiration.’ He says into Crystal’s head softly. He smiles down at John and cups his cheek. “I like this John, the four of us together. It seems cosy.” He whispers.
"Gorgeous. Do you want me to open you or do you want to prepare yourself for me?" John strokes Sherlock's thighs.
"We were best friends in Uni until he," Mr. Holmes points an accusing finger at George "decided to shut me out for nearly forty years!"
Sky blushes and goes to her, immediately dipping in to lick at her cunt. She holds Violet’s hips and pulls her closer as she sucks her clit teasingly. ‘So yummy. So wet.’ She purrs in her head.
Sherlock makes a couple of fists with his hands. “How are you feeling after that ma’am?” He asks softly. He hears the five minute alarm and smiles. “We can almost leave.” He says softly.
"Mm." She pulls away slightly. "No, tell me exactly what you want me to do. What you want to feel." She smirks.
“Of course Greg.” Magdala says softly. “I’ll be happy to teach you bits alongside John, but we’ll expect you to do research as well, when you’re better.” She explains.
“Phone.” Sherlock smiles. “Well it doesn’t just connect to people, it... you can ask it questions and it tell you to answers.” He says. He presses the square with a ‘G’ on and pulls up Google. “Again type in any question you could possibly have.”
“That’s right. Come for Daddy. I’m going to keep fucking you til I’m satisfied.” He presses harder and pounds into his prostate.
John heads to the bathroom first. He gives his teeth a quick scrub then goes to change. By the time he's dressed and opening his door, his mother is heading for her turn in the bathroom.
He blushes brighter. "Th-This is a special club.." He blushes as he remembers that it was a sex club.
“I hope so too.” John says and stands. He cups Sherlock’s face in both hands and kisses him gently. “Now I know why your face is always so smooth.” He smiles.
She bites her lip and shakes her head, to upset that morning after getting off the phone with Nina to eat.
“Oh. We didn’t know that when I was human.” Sherlock nods slowly. “How fine do you want the carrots cutting up?”
She moves on top of him, kissing  down his neck and body. “Can I taste your cock?” She asks shyly, blushing brightly.
She whimpers and rocks against him, feeling the tip of his cock teasing her. “How many, Daddy? How many are you going to make me carry for you?”
“Need more. Need cock. I’m so huge already and I still need more.” She whimpers. “So full and I still want more.”
"I still can't believe the Queen showed up at the wedding. That was something else." He chuckles and smiles.
They were rushed outside to a waiting suvs. The girl and her grandfather were put in separate vehicles.
“Private room, hot tub, full body massages, pedicure, manicure. And that’s just what they have written for the package.” She smirks a bit.
Sherlock sits, thinking of where to start. “The flowers weren’t only a clue but a warning to me. That if I don’t play the game Jim will get to you easily. If I don’t play with him you are at risk. So that’s why I have to go. Because if I don’t you and our pups are first on his hit list.” He frowns.
Magdala sighs sadly. “I remind him of our ancestor. Apparently I look like her.” She explains. “I don’t know what he’ll do. The pain he’s feeling from our family, runs deeper and for longer than pain from Camille. They matched. They were... soulmates, or as close as two people can get. His soulmate left him. Mycroft may just banish me because I remind him of her.” She explains softly, “it’s okay though, son. You will be able to keep your soulmate, I’m sure of it.” She whispers, patting his knee.
“Unless anyone has any objects, I would like to turn Magdala. She helped me just as much as John and Sherlock did.” Camille explains. “Do you have any objects, Mycroft?”
"I've been thinking about this ever since you stayed over at mine." John admits when they break for breath.
"Come for me, babe. I know you need  to. Just let go and come." He rubs against his prostate as he strokes him.
“Good babies.” Ms. Cheyenne smiles and sits in Greg’s lap. She decided she’s going to sit with the head of his cock pressing against her cervix and just massage his cock with her cunt. She slowly starts to work her cunt muscles, rubbing his cock.
"Lydia kind of spiraled into a panic attack and she was embarrassed so I lied so she wouldn't be triggered further."
"Alright watch me and then you can do it too. You take a bit of dough about this size and roll it between your palms like this till its in a nice ball. Then you drop it gently into the sugar and roll it around until the whole surface area is cover. Finally you like them up on the baking sheet like this." Greg does the process as he talks through the steps.
Sherlock huffed a laugh. "So this is "Three Continents" Watson." He murmured. "I mean..." He blushed and lowered his head again.
Mycroft nods and leads her into the banquet hall. All the other Gods stop what they’re eating and clap and cheer and wolf-whistle Morna as Mycroft leads her to the top of the table and helps her get comfortable, on the shezlong.
"Thank you!" She smiles and leaves then comes back. "Any suggestion as to which one I should borrow?"
"Well now that I think about I don't know.." She bites her lip. "My mother will ask when the wedding is and my sisters will want to see the ring."
John frowns, “Locky fun.” He says emphasising the last word. “Maggie fun.” He shifts in Sherlock’s lap until Sherlock’s cock is inside him. He moans loudly and giggles.
John smiles and wraps his arms around Sherlock. “You’re different to the rest of the people they sent, your ancestors.” He whispers. “They normal send the most promiscuous and sexually active person in the village. But you’re different. You’re so full of tender love, I like it.” He says softly.
“That’s perfect. When she’s little like that she has the mindset of a four year old. When she’s comfortable she reverts back to a childlike mindset. But whenever she needs to she is capable of being a fully functioning adult.” John nods. “She’s just very comfortable with you so she can be small around you.” John smiles softly.
He pulls out of her and smirks, motioning for Greg to come closer. Greg grins, stroking himself. “Mm, need this?”
"Mm I'm hungry.." She sighs. "Being pregnant makes me hungry for everything. You. Food." She mumbles as she kisses his chest.
"I want you to strip and open yourself up for Daddy. You have to do a really good job and Daddy doesn't want to hurt his baby. No he doesn't." He kisses him lovingly and sets a tube of lube on the desk. He sits back in his chair and takes his huge cock out, stroking himself lazily.
Sherlock gasps mockingly. "Say it's not so!" He muses. He chuckles at himself. "It would seem like this would be impossible to some extent without some kind of divine intervention."
Juliette heads to the driver's door and slides in. Mostly, she was quiet, just happy to be driving the two. They reminded her a bit of her own fathers.
"Good boy." Brain praises and pulls him in for a kiss. "Tell me about Sky. Why did she have your key?" He smirks, unlocking the cage slowly.
“I’m going to have Turk’s by the end of the week. That’ll be more room.” She nuzzles him. “I’m gonna be so full..”
John collapses onto his chest, giggling softly. “You’re so cooold.” He giggles, dragging out the last word.
John holds him close and runs his fingers through his hair. He tips his head to the side, exposing his neck and giving Sherlock more room to nose. “No one has had you before? You want me to be the first?”
“Oh god no. We didn’t have photography back then. When it first came out. I guess now it would be in period clothing but back then it was just clothes.” Mycroft shrugs.
He moans at his begging, pushing a lubed finger into him. "I've got you. Daddy's going to make you feel good, but you've got to be a good boy for me. Can you do that? Can you be Daddy's good boy?"
Sherlock bites his lip and moves to hug Greg from behind, silently resting his head on his shoulder.
He blushes and nods, sitting up. He takes off his shirt, leaving his binder on. He bites his lip and takes off his trousers. He hesitates at his pants. He's comfortable with not having his pants on, but he wants Sky to be comfortable too.
“I don’t want him in any danger. None whatsoever.” Sherlock growls, knowing he wouldn’t be able to protect John.
Collin goes to the piano joining them in the playing. The others sip their tea and listen to the music.
“Good.” John kisses him sweetly, this kiss feeling more like a sealing of vows than just a plain kiss.
Sherlock hums as he starts to stroke himself. “Mm, this doesn’t mean our puppy can’t use her mouth to help up get off, right?”
“I am honoured for this, ma’am.” Sherlock breaths. “If you ever want to speak to someone, I would be honoured to be the intermediary for you.”
Sherlock smiles fondly. "You know I despise surprises.." He nuzzles him. "But I suppose I can make an exception.."
“I wanted to make sure you got the broach before I left.” Sherlock gets up and heads to his bedroom, ready to pack a suitcase.
"And if they don't, a few gentle prods in the form of incentives within the show should point them in the right direction." Joann's eyes light up a bit and John sees a shadow of the woman he remembered in her excitement.
"Mm it is yours. All yours. You made me like this. I'm going to be so big and stuffed. Full of your baby. Our baby." She mumbles and nips at his neck.
“In my head, I’m already referring to you as my omega, an unconscious switch on my part, so whatever you’d like.” Sherlock nods as he rips a section of naan and uses it to scoop some food. “My brother is going to be insufferable about this.” He rolls his eyes.
John moans and holds onto her hips. “Fuck yourself on me Maggie. I know you want to feel my big thick cock back inside you.”
“I fantasized about doing this for him, of giving him this. I don’t want to pretend though. I don’t mind that it’s you, I’m glad in fact. I want to do this to you and I want you to tell me everything you like until I can do this better than anyone alive,” Danny looked a bit glazed and unfocused as he fed his cock to Sherlock, his thumb tenderly tracing the outline of Sherlock’s now taut lips. They groaned as he intimately rubbed the roof of Sherlock’s mouth, slid over his tongue, and bumped the back. Sherlock found the overload of sensations to be extremely pleasing, liking the way it felt to stretch his jaw, curious as to how different it would taste and feel without the condom, and suddenly wondered what the feel of semen sliding down his throat would be like. He’d have to find out some day. Doubling his efforts, Sherlock moaned as he eagerly fellated Danny, completely focused on his task. It was unfortunate that this was the moment John decided to drop by unexpectedly.
The next morning, John got up, brushed his teeth, fed his child, dressed them both after calling the clinic to reschedule his shift to accommodate his time with Rosie, and to clear his afternoon.
The ice in his chest grew larger as his mind spun around and around, his depressive thoughts flourishing in the chaos that was his instability.
“I do,” John admitted without hesitation, certain and unashamed. “I can’t deny it to anyone, not anymore, not after this.” John looked down, “All this time, every single day, all I have wanted was for you to wake up so I could let you know how much I feel for you. I’m not interested in living my life without you, Sherlock, so if you could do us both a favour and stop nearly dying all the time, I’d really appreciate it.”
“So, me trusting you makes this okay? Were you ever going to tell me?” Mary looked mulish and David looked like he wished he could evaporate on the spot, completely incapable of moving, just staying there covered in come, sweat, and embarrassment.
John smiled down at him, his ever-expressive face dancing between delight and a failed attempt at appearing calm, “Yeah?”
“Such good boys, so spirited,” Mummy pinched both their cheeks and then ushered them into the house, “I decided on Christmas Breakfast instead of dinner. I absolutely despise your father’s side of the family, and if they want to be parasites here, then they will do it on my schedule!”
“Yes, I know, my love, but I can’t. You know I can’t.” John helped Sherlock grip the massive toy and gasped along with the omega as he hungrily pushed the massive thing into himself with no preparation. Sherlock began to moan right away, flopping to his side as he pumped it in and out, and eventually going onto his back once more, his legs bent up and spread as wide as he could get them so that he could grip his hard cock with one hand and move the dildo with the other. Sherlock was huffing, panting out small cries as he tried to work the big toy into himself, but he was too hazy with lust to coordinate himself, and the omega was becoming distressed. John found himself reaching out and gripping the base of it, working it in and out, making small circles, and responding to every one of Sherlock’s wordless demands.
John didn’t get much time to prepare. Though he hadn’t meant to drift off, the early hours of the morning, John startled himself awake. The air was rich with pheromones and instinctively, John sought out the source. He found Sherlock now laying in the centre of his bed, his body writhing, his face flushed, his skin dewy with sweat. “Breed me, alpha.” Sherlock’s voice was husky and deep as he made his demands. “I want it to be you, John.”
Sherlock could not get his thoughts organised. It was a mess; his mind palace was completely disorganised. “Lestrade broke your nose on my behalf.”
He felt adrift, even after he looked at the date on the laptop. It meant nothing to him since he had no idea when he’d had his arse handed to him by Harry.
“I’m going to kick Mycroft’s flabby arse,” John promised darkly, “What’s he been going about while I was away? I knew I shouldn’t have left.” John set down his bags so that he could chase Mycroft down before he got to his car.
John giggled and then looked upset with himself for laughing. Mycroft’s tone was entirely serious, “Yes. Thanks to that decision you are not being outfitted with a mechanical device to help you…”
that I won’t be imposing.” John’s face was stiff and rigid with contained feelings. Sherlock wondered why John had decided to come back to Baker Street.
“I know you do, my darling man. Everything you did, everything you endured, all of it was because you loved me. I never doubted that for a moment. I am so sorry that I made it so that you doubted yourself, though. I’ll always regret that. I’m so so sorry, Sherlock.” John stepped forward, pressing their bodies together, “This was a case of both of us being stubborn, but mostly me also being stubborn
Everything went hazy with lust. John wasn’t sure who reached for who first but they were soon writhing around the bed together, naked, hungry, and filled with urgency. Sherlock managed to locate a half-empty container of personal lubricant which he nearly threw at John, “I need you in me, as soon as possible.”
“The last time you lived with someone you pretended to die and went underground for two years. I have no evidence that you aren’t inclined to dramatically escalate your newest romance in some manner. If I’ve overstepped, I apologise,” Mycroft mocked Sherlock.
That handful of words made John go still, his mouth open and his face filled with stunned joy. Sherlock realized that his nightmare was comprised of all his hidden fears and weaknesses, his doubts, his uncertainty, and had been a reflection of how he’d always assumed love would impact him.
John just gave her his mobile. He was too drunk to operate it. With a frustrated sigh, Harry managed to find the number and called them, “Her dad’s ill. I’m her aunt, Harriet Miller, we met during orientation? John and I are coming by cab to pick her up.” John was grateful that he’d had the foresight to register Harry’s information with the centre, especially since she’d kept her ex-wife’s surname. The people at Rosie’s school took their jobs very seriously and didn’t just hand children over to any old person claiming to be a relation. Mycroft had vetted the place, and it made John feel useless all over again because he couldn’t even do
John got to his feet. “I understand, I don’t blame you.” Turning stiffly, John walked back to the doorway, picked up his bags, and lurched down seventeen steps until he was at the front door. He had no place to go but that was his own fault and no one else’s. He was weak and honourless. He couldn’t keep his word to his fiancée and couldn’t keep his word to his lover. John left.
John felt his heart ripping open with agony. Those words hurt in a way he wasn’t prepared to deal with. John knew that in the past he’d chosen so many other things over Sherlock, and in so many unnecessary ways.
“Mary is pregnant and says that it’s mine.” John looked down in shame, “I have my doubts though, what if it’s her boyfriend’s? Still, I can’t just let her have my baby alone if it isn’t.”
. As far as Sherlock was concerned, he was in bed with his rapist and nothing in the world would be right again. John fell asleep quickly, lightly snoring as he slept on his side, one arm possessively over Sherlock’s chest. The bed was comfortable, and John was very warm, so despite his negative feelings, Sherlock dozed off eventually and remained that way throughout the night.
John grinned, “Well, then that’s that.” In keeping with their no-point-in-hiding-stuff-anymore proposal, John reached out his hand, “Kiss to seal the deal?”
when you blush, I told you I was going to set records making you do so.” Danny pecked Sherlock on the cheek quickly before he stood up, “It won’t even be a problem, we’ll just make sure to use the bedroom for all of that. John? I could murder a cup of tea. Mind if I go make us some?”
The driver had to assist bringing Sherlock inside and fell under the sharp command of Mrs Hudson when it came to the relocation of the shopping. It was confusing to the man. It was obvious he wasn’t sure who had been in the military, John, Mrs Hudson, or both. While they filled the kitchen and pantry exactly the way she wanted it, John got Sherlock sorted out for a long hot shower. Once he was clean, John prepared Sherlock his favourite guilty pleasure, tinned soup, poured it in a large mug so he could drink it along with a large hot cup of tea, and set out some pain medication. By then, Sherlock needed it.
Sherlock's birthday started out miserable and lonely but at the end of the day, he has gained a distraction.
The rest of the walk went right over his head as his brain whited out momentarily with lust. It took all of his self-discipline to not just disappear into his mind palace to work out the logistics. He managed to pay attention to John’s words but Sherlock didn’t take in the snowy landscape, the other happy Londoners who were bundled up and walking about in cheerful groups, or any of the other winter scenes that played out around him. All he could see was John; lovely, laughing, happy, smiling,
, John, aren’t you listening? I’ve wondered so many times what it would be like to be with you. Don’t you want me? People say I’m attractive,” Sherlock had an awful thought. He blurted the words out without being able to stop himself, “Do I turn you off? Is that the phrase?” Sherlock felt sad now, and hugged his John tight to make himself feel better, “I’m sorry John. I’ll let you go. I know you only like women. I’m sorry.” Sherlock found that he was sniffling, and he felt so terrible. “Okay. I am going to go now.” Miserably, Sherlock rolled off of John and lay flat on his back, staring up at the blank ceiling before heaving himself up and wobbling off to his bedroom where he curled up around a cold pillow.
The dark creature inside his mind was gloating and rubbing its incorporeal hands together gleefully.
Sherlock took a quick shower. He found another pair of pyjamas waiting for him and to his surprise, they were the correct size. Pulling the soft cotton over his body, he padded barefoot to the kitchen where Mrs Hudson was serving pancakes, “Good morning, Sherlock!” She was cheerful and unperturbed when John made Sherlock kneel beside him to be hand-fed from John’s own plate. Sherlock had never eaten so much food in his entire life and he felt bloated and uncomfortable. “I’m kind of proud of you, Sherlock. It can’t be easy to be where you are but you’re taking it all so well.” Sherlock heaved a sigh of relief when John affixed a new nicotine patch to his arm, relaxing as the chemicals began to sooth him. “I’m going to be gone all day, so as soon as you’ve gone to the bathroom, I want you to douche yourself clean. After that, I want you to wear the plug I have left for you in our bedroom. There’s lube in the top drawer. No orgasms! Put it in and leave yourself alone. I won’t be back until six tonight and I’m going to want to fuck you the second I get home. Be in bed and waiting because even if you don’t use the plug, I’m fucking you. Understood?”
"Jesus..." John looks down at the state of the bed for the first time and gapes. "There isn't a dry patch to be found..."
"Would you like that? Being put on display for anyone to see? For anyone to use? Have strangers come into your slutty cunt?"
Sherlock hesitates for a moment before unbuttoning his shirt, he’ll just make sure John doesn’t see the scars covering his back.
He smirks and kisses along his cock, slowly taking him into his mouth as he rocks two fingers into him.
Pythia kneels down beside Lydia. “Before today Luciel didn’t know ghosts exist. All she’s heard are the scary ghost stories, go slow with her and if you think she’s going to try to hug or touch you, solidify for her. You won’t be as scary then.” She explains softly.
"Mine. All fucking mine." Mycroft kisses him hard, pounding I to him and hitting his prostate each thrust.
"Mm are you going to make her come?" Lydia purrs as she watches them kneeling on the floor, melting under John's hands as he rubs her back.
"Mm we'll take you out and watch strangers fuck you. You want that don't you? Everyone watching you. Wanting you."
Mycroft tries to steady himself as John lifts him up. He bites his lip and closes his eyes as a few tears fall.
"Let me make love to you." He says breathily, his voice dropping lower and his hands ghosting over his arse.
He moans loudly against her, rocking back onto the dildo. He pushes his tongue into her, thrusting roughly. He tries to rub his cock against the bed to get friction.
“If you’re sure.” Greg says, slowly undoing the clasp, giving her enough time to pull away, if she wished.
"It could give you time to figure out what his plan is. We can go through those photos you took today."
