Watching the troops was boring. They were a well-oiled machine, yes, but if Sherlock was truly interested in seeing that he'd watch a military movie.
"It didn't," Sherlock reassures him.
"Yes, unless you are opposed. Then I was thinking perhaps Donovan could have the role of godmother."
"Why didn't you take your concerns to Sherlock?"
Sherlock's hot gaze tells John he understands the implications of that. Sucking in a breath of shock, he moves forward so he's staring directly at John. His hand flies up and John flinches back. He doesn't realize the other Alpha is still standing behind him until he backs into him. "Don't touch me," John says to Sherlock.
.............................................................
"Do you honestly believe I'm in love with you?" Irene scoffs.
"John?"
"Obviously you're lying. You flinched away from me as soon as I went to touch you, and you flinched away from Mycroft earlier. Yet when you ran out the door you grabbed the Omega girl's hand. One possible conclusion is that you were abused by a man, but the fact that there are two Omega males in your pack lead me to say it was an Alpha who abused you. Probably someone in a position of power, considering your initial response to me was to talk, but when you saw Mycroft your automatic instinct was to stab him. Now you're nervous of me because you know I have power over you, meaning you were abused by an Alpha in power. Which brings us back to my original question: who abused you?"
"Oh, poor Mikey! I hope he feels better soon. Should I prepare him some chicken noodle soup? He used to love that when he was a boy."
"I'm flattered, I guess. What specifically did you need advice on?"
"Yeah, you do. John wouldn't hurt me."
"John!" I turn to find Mycroft and Sherlock both running towards me. Sherlock gets to me first, grabbing me and smelling all over to be certain I'm alright. Once he releases me, Mycroft makes a compulsory check himself.
John turns around the corner to find Sherlock with his arms full of cooking supplies, trying to get a container of bleach onto his precarious pile. John grabs it before disaster can strike, grabs another bottle just in case, and then walks with his mate to the front. "You know Lestrade didn't mean to hurt your feelings, right?" John reassures as they climb into the taxi holding their groceries.
"S-s-s-sor-"
"Let him go, Sherlock. Give him a few minutes," John said calmly. "He's upset."
"Sure."
"Oh babe, I'm sorry," John answers, dropping the groceries and gathering Sherlock into his arms. He lifts them to the couch and pulls Sherlock into his lap. Blessedly, the man still "fits" the same as he always does; much too gangly to be called a comfortable fit, but John cradles him close anyway, loving the feeling of having his mate securely in his arms. He's going to miss this when the twins grow a bit larger, though it's a rare occurrence to begin with.
Mycroft pulls two more things from his bag, composition books for Jim and I. "I'm not really sure how to entertain you, and I'm not really good at this kind of thing."
"Go to sleep, John," Sherlock orders. John slips gratefully into unconsciousness.
"I know you're awake," John says. "You can open your eyes."
“It’s a bit early for that yet.”
John frowns again. "Sorry," he says guiltily.
I pull myself up and grab a broom and dustpan. "Let that go, we need to get the cut washed out first," Sherlock tells me.
"Alpha," Sherlock says. "I love you," he says suddenly. "I don't know if I've told you lately, but you're nothing like I was afraid you'd be. I used to think I never would have a mate because Alphas were abusive, and that I'd never have children because they'd end up dead at an Alpha's hands. You defied my expectations. You're the best thing to ever happen to me, followed closely by our children."
Downstairs, John is caring for Mrs. Hudson's scrape as an extremely loud clatter is heard. John and Mrs. Hudson both turn to stare in surprise. "That was right on my bins!" Mrs. Hudson exclaims.
"Right now? That you forgot to set the timer on the oven." Sherlock leaps up like he's on fire, digs the box out of the trash, and sets the timer.
His front door opens and John hears Sebastian yell, "John? Where you at?"
"You smell just like my son!" the woman exclaims tearfully, and just like that my legs unlock and carry me forward again.
"What? Running away?" At John's feverish nod, he shrugs. "Yeah, of course. I've done it before, not that hard." It's a well-known, little-mentioned fact between the four that Jim is a foster kid whose been in more homes than he has years to his life. If anyone understands omega abuse, it's Jim.
"I believe you have something that we want, Mr. Holmes," the man with the gun tells him.
They enter the kitchen and John freezes. "Good morning, Mrs. Holmes. Mycroft."
He lays in bed and stops moving completely. He wonders why John didn't want to bond him. It's strange to him. Plenty of men and women alike told him in explicit detail what they would do to him when he went into heat. John was different. He wouldn't even come near Sherlock. Why? Plenty of people have wanted Sherlock for his body, so why didn't John?
"It's alright. You clearly needed that."
“We missed your heat.”
The Omega in question knocks back the glass he ordered, sets it on the counter, and twirls away. Literally twirls, the movement so graceful John's mouth actually goes dry. Yep, he's got it bad.
Sherlock nods. "I'm sorry."
"I would have you on this table until you begged for mercy twice," Irene tells him in response, with a flirtatious smirk at John since she's flirting with his Omega.
"Sir?"
Meanwhile, Sherlock is standing at the safe, trying to deduce the passcode. "Alright, on the floor," the man with the gun tells John. "Miss Adler, on the floor!"
"Are you going to explain?"
"Sex doesn't alarm me," Sherlock answers.
Once the floor is finished, Mycroft calls a morgue (St. Bart's, they won't be smart enough to think anything other than "hunting accident") and a flooring company. His father's body is removed, and a new floor is laid.
"I just want it off," Sherlock responds.
Sherlock watches this, panicking as he watches the soldier he just met rip into the other Alphas. 'Run!' His brain orders, so he takes off down the alley as fast as he can.
Sherlock shudders. "I'm glad you did."
Sherlock sighs. "If I promise to behave, will you let me out of these restraints?"
“He was on guard; he’ll be in the midst of all the fighting!”
“Home,” Lestrade repeats with a bitter laugh. “I can’t go home, Sally. Sherlock was right.” He swings his office door shut, and Sally watches him curl up on his couch, inexplicable pity welling up inside of her as she realizes how broken, how shattered, her boss looks. Knowing there is nothing she can do for him-or perhaps, nothing he would allow her to do would be more accurate-she heads for home herself, resolving to wake up earlier in the morning so she can at least bring him a good cup of coffee and a pastry.
"Smart man," John remarks wryly, causing Sherlock to smirk at him.
“I can’t. Not yet. I’m scared. I’m so sorry, John.”
"What?" John and Sherlock both demand in syncrony.
"No."
"The hiker. With the bashed in head. How was he killed?"
"It's mine to win Cluedo, but the victim can't be the killer. Haven't they heard of suicide?"
"You're going to eat something," John warns, and Sherlock nods in agreement.
"Don't be naïve, Greg," snaps Sherlock. "He wants you here so John doesn't take a flying leap out a window again!"
Against all odds, at least in John's mind, he and his Omega pack had survived. It didn't take long into their journey for them to discover John was a natural leader, so he co-led with Jim. If he was an alpha, John would be the pack beta, seeing as how a pack beta could be either alpha or omega. But since he wasn't dating Jim, and Jim (though leader of the pack) wasn't an alpha, terminology didn't matter.
"It's your brother. Can you send Anthea or someone, I need to take him to an obstetrician, he was drugged with an unknown substance."
“No. I’m not sure what it means. I might break into Mycroft’s house to look in some of his code-breaking books. But it could always be something new.” He thrusts his hand up for a taxi and like magic, or a magnet, one drifts to a stop at the curb. He rattles off an address to the taxi driver, an unfamiliar one to John.
“I think I might want to get back with her. Maybe I’ll prove you wrong.”
Mycroft looks like if he had more energy he would protest, so instead he nods and clicks off the computer.
"Thanks, Freak. I appreciate that." She smiles to let him know she didn't mean that statement offensively, and then swings her door open, allowing the young Omega to exit.
"Sherlock, what are we doing here?" John questions as they join the queue.
He laughs, and for just a moment I see the old Jim. "I'm not mad at you, John. And I'll always be in your corner if you need me. I'm thinking I'm going to ask Mycroft to send me to school. I'd like to get out of the house a bit more."
"She went to get us some baby diapers, because I forgot. God bless that woman."
"Well ain't that touching." My spine stiffens in anger as my mother's entire body shudders. I turn to face my nightmares, keeping an arm on my mother. "Where you been, boy? Prostituting yourself? Got nicer clothes than when you left."
John sighs. "Look, I know you're mad at me, but I didn't know what else to do. You were panicking and left me with no choice."
"I live to impress you," Mycroft mutters sarcastically.
"I love you too," John replies. "I always will. I swear it."
Sherlock takes the bottle from John and spins it. "It's a dose and a half of a heat suppressant here," he informs John.
"Can't say I blame her," John mutters softly. Both brothers peruse him for a moment- his jaw is clenched, along with his fists, meaning he's not lying. "This blood is already soaked into the floor," he says, louder. "We'll never get it up by scrubbing. Do you have a sledgehammer?"
Surprisingly, Sherlock tolerates Andy's ramblings without the slightest hint of complaint, occasionally asking a question about Soo Lin. Finally, he thanks Andy and they leave.
The second time Sherlock proposed, he had accessed his Mind Palace. He searched through it for most of the day, looking for information on proposals. As he had told John, he had deleted everything he had once known about the topic.
"There he is!" exclaimed Sally as they park and jump out of the car.
"I couldn't," John responds honestly. "I need to know that they're safe, and me being dead wouldn't allow me to be peaceful as I die."
"Yes."
"I don't know what that is," Sherlock admits quietly to John.
Mycroft got into the house without waking anyone and settled into the second bedroom, pulling back the curtain to watch the sunrise before sitting on the bed and steepling his fingers together. He drifted off for a while into his mind.
The hospital is a flurry of activity, all of it surrounding Sherlock. Mycroft desperately thinks that maybe Sherlock is doing this for attention, but he quickly tamps that thought down. That's ridiculous, there's clearly more to it than that.
His phone chimes with the last text. 'Be safe. -MH'
John frowns, trying to think of who it could be. Nothing immediately comes to mind.
As soon as they made their way through the door of 221B, Sherlock was stripping off his shirt and throwing it at the door.
‘Get off my computer. There are things on there not meant for your eyes.-MH’ Sherlock ignores this text too, instead navigating through the computer files, which are neatly labeled for him, until he finds the pictures on code-breaking.
"That will be going back to our bedroom!" John calls, and Sherlock waves a hand at him. He's entirely too busy trying to figure out the corrosiveness of the new acid Mycroft gifted him to worry about mundane details like where the experiment will be placed.
John stands up then though he's not done with breakfast and loops his arms around Sherlock. "Just so we're clear, you're not going to help me in the shower," Sherlock states, though his tone sounds uncertain.
"And I expect you to be on your best behavior. I've already wrung the same promise from him."
"Yes, ma'am," Lestrade answers her, shaking her hand politely.
"We just had tea, at the Palace," Sherlock responds cooly.
Thank you, doctor.”
"So how's your wife doing, Lestrade?" Molly questions politely.
"What you did back there, with the tackling of Moriarty, that was, that was...good," Sherlock offers, rubbing his head with the loaded gun. "That was very good."
John catches Mycroft's eye, and realizes from how tightly his lips are pressed that he's a bit angry with them both. "Just once, can you two behave like grown ups?" Mycroft demands.
"Hook me up."
He smirks. "You won't be able to hold me for very long."
"She told me, one day during text," Sherlock says, "I thought I told you. Anyway, if Moriarty couldn't keep her safe, and he's the world's only Consulting Criminal, what hope do we have? He would've wanted to keep her alive, they were 'friends' as much as Moriarty can have friends. Yet she's on a concrete slab at Bart's. We're safe for now, but for how long?" he questions pessimistically. "How long, John? We know Moriarty wants to kill us. He strapped a bomb to you, he threatened to shoot us both...if Irene's dead, how much longer do we have left?"
Sherlock pulls up Mycroft’s email, uploads the drawing, then sends it to Mycroft through his own drafts folder.
"Right. Well, we're going to have to acknowledge biology, so we are going to Afghanistan. Together."
Mycroft's eyes widen a bit. I hear Jim suck in a shocked breath. "John-" Mycroft begins, and suddenly I drop the dishes. I'm pretty sure everything has broken, and now I'm yanking the pieces viciously toward me, trying to clean up.
"How do you know?"
"C'mon, don't start that again," John says as Sherlock turns back to the computer. He catches his mate's arm and tugs him gently closer, so that he is sure Sherlock is looking at him. "I've told you, I don't mind if you're not the Omega stereotype."
Two hours later, Sherlock and John are lying on the couch, stroking each other's arms lovingly, when the explosion occurs. The men who find them mention something about a gas leak in amidst mumbles about evacuation.
"Mycroft!" The man in question is sitting with his phone in his hand, staring at it blankly. At his brother's shout, he met his gaze, though he still seemed dazed.
"I'll show you upstairs," Sherlock says, then scoops me into his arms.
"He received a phone call he said he couldn't ignore. We're not sure who from. He paused a crucial meeting and took the call. I presumed it was something about you."
John shrugs with one shoulder. “I’d prefer to eat out here. With you.”
They lie in silence for a while. Sherlock tosses and turns, and the one point he kicks John in the side. Around three in the morning, Sherlock stops moving. His breathing evens out and John knows he has finally fallen asleep. He follows suit.
“Listen to me. Those bells you heard mean that the attackers are Alphas. That means they can turn into wolves, Sherlock! Wolves! John has been trained for this situation, he will be fine. You have not trained for this situation, you have no weapon, you cannot turn into a wolf, and you are literally hours away from going into heat. I cannot in good conscience let you go back.”
"Oi! Food's done, whenever you two lovebirds want to grace us with your presence." Laughing, Sherlock grabs my hand and we run into the house together.
There is only one number in the contacts, and Greg rings it immediately.
"Um, what was that?" John asks.
"I really don't know how to tell you this," Sherlock says, tugging his fingers through his long curls nervously.
"John?" I'm running to her, throwing my arms around her, and she's sobbing into my shoulder. "Oh John, my baby, my boy, my son. John, John, John. Oh my son," she croons, cradling me close.
'Molly,
They are quiet the entire ride home, but the second they clear the doorway Sherlock comes alive. "Catch me if you can, John" he calls over his shoulder as he races up the stairs. He slams the door the moment before John can shove his way inside, so John is forced to pull it open and slam it again. He prays Mrs. Hudson is out for the evening.
"That would be the only thing you heard. This is my mate, Sebastian Moran."
John laughs. "I think I would remember that, Sherlock."
Molly smiles from where she's taken a short break, staring down at the dead body she was working on. "Let's get you and your friends done with so we can see those babies," she says, setting back to work with a new fire in her body.
"So I'm not asexual?"
Anthea is suddenly at the door knocking. “Hello, Detective Inspector. I was sent for the information regarding the serial murderer Jeff Hope who was killed last night.”
‘Just got back. Do you have a case for me?-SH’
"Mycroft wouldn't murder me," Sherlock says dismissively. "It's more likely he would hire someone else to do it, and you wouldn't be able to trace it back to him no matter what you did."
The fourth time Sherlock proposed, he was not high, and he had researched proposals. It seemed to him that ordinary people liked sentiment and a ring. Well, if that's what John wanted, fine. Anything for John.
"John, I'll take the elevator! We can catch him!" Dr. Sawyer calls.
Lestrade and Donovan open the cards together. Lestrade is the first one to respond. "Oh my god, really? A baby?"
He jogs off to his house, gathering clothes he will need. As he's  putting clothes into his suitcase, someone pounds on his door. "It's open!"
"Let them alone, Sherlock. They're mature adults, if they want to speak to each other they can," John reprimanded quietly, looking out to Mycroft and the Detective Inspector.
.........................................................................
He grabs Sherlock and quickly takes him back to the wall. To his utter astonishment, a plain brick wall is all that greets him.
“Yes, of course. Why wouldn’t I be?”
"I finished and you were gone," he tells John.
John flies down the stairs in an instant, awake and alert. "Irene. You're looking...surprisingly well, considering last time we saw you you were on a concrete slab."
"Noooooo! Sleep!" Mycroft mumbles. "Hurts," he whimpers.
He surges forward at the end of his beautiful speech, closing the small gap between us to kiss me. I yank him on top of me and kiss him passionately. He responds with equal fervor.
"Thank you!" The elevator dings. "Top floor, Doctor!" John yells, and he runs up more stairs.
"I don't understand. Is Sherlock undercover for the government?"
He was looking over a body for Lestrade when he noticed the deceased woman had a ring on her finger. Married happily, surprisingly. Very much in love with her husband. He pulls the ring off her finger.
"I love you too," John answers. He stands and pulls Sherlock to his feet too so they can kiss languidly for a moment. All too soon Sherlock is pulling away for a yawn that nearly cracks his jaw.
"Yet you're dating Anderson," Sherlock fires back.
John wisely decides not to comment on that.
The stranger snarls at him, twisting his arm so Dimmock's grip is broken, then he plunges into the tunnels. Dimmock follows him angrily.
“How’d you even learn to do that?” John demands as soon as he finds his voice.
"I don't know. I'm-" his voice breaks, but he continues on, "I'm scared. I never wanted an Alpha, and I've got one now, and I need my brother."
“Right. I’ll refresh it one more time.”
"Don't call him that," he admonishes, pulling out into traffic. "There's a lot you don't understand."
'Not a moment too soon,' John notes dully as he sees Lestrade stride toward them with purpose.
"John Watson, hi," John says, leaning over and offering his hand to introduce himself. He is ignored, for the man is staring rapturously at Sherlock.
"Mummy!"
Mike nods firmly. "I agree," he says, which is echoed by the others.
I can see Jim is fuming, so I explain. "In case I can't talk to Sherlock, I can talk to you, Jim. Kind of forget he's there, as it is. You're my best friend, if I can't talk to him I can to you. And Greg, you're just more safe for me to look at and talk to than Mycroft. It's the Omega thing." Jim sits, pacified. I wait until Greg has moved the chair and sat to sit down myself. My hand finds Molly's, and then after a minute I grab Mikes hand too.
A quick chat with my big brother lends some insight into John's behavior. If he thought I was experienced, I can hardly fault him for wanting to be experienced for me. I'm a bit upset he didn't ask me, but there's not much to be done about it now.
"I don't know. I'm not really good at this kind of stuff. Did any of those books you got from the library include a book of baby names?"
John clears his throat. "Harry is short for Harriet."
"Oh, it's all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector," answers Sherlock honestly, knowing Lestrade will do nothing to punish him. "I lost count."
“No. Get out of here.”
For some idiotic reason, John has decided to interrupt their baby planning with a party. He tells Sherlock on the day before Christmas Eve that they will be hosting a party Christmas Day. Sherlock is in the middle of making a passionate argument against having people disturbing his nest (though they both know he's protesting for the sake of it, really) when he interrupts himself with a startled "oh!"
Jim pulls out a sheet of paper and behind scratching. "I'll make a list for you guys, too."
Mycroft shoots me a look. "John, I don't mean to offend you, but your soulmate is a male, you are quite clearly gay. Severely repressed, but still gay."
Within a few days, John Watson is kidnapped yet again. This is getting old fast. He rubs his neck and glances around, trying to remember how he ended up here, wherever here was.
"I've got you," Greg answers, smiling at me, grabbing me under the arm. "Benefits of being a Detective Sergeant, I'm strong!" He sounds so enthusiastic about this that I laugh.
“No? Fine, prove it. Go out there and talk to him right now.”
I'm breathing hard now. "I asked why she didn't just leave. She told me he's her soulmate, but he won't bite her, so she had to listen to him. She had to let him hurt her."
“Wait a second, Big Brother is legitimately your big brother?” At Sherlock’s how stupid are you, really? look, he elaborates, “I thought Big Brother was a nickname because he watches everything, like Big Brother from George Orwell’s ‘1984.’ I didn’t realize he was actually your big brother.”
.............................................................
“Yes, you did. But I’m not angry about that. A little put out, a little hurt, but I’m not angry. Honestly, Sherlock, if I was you I would have left me behind too.”
"Sherlock. We both-"
Irene nods. "He knew where to look."
Whatever I've said seems to upset him more. "Never mind."
"It might be best to have you stay with Gregory for now," Mycroft says, noting John's discomfort. "He's at work, but I can show you to his room." He leads John up the stairs, opening the door to the room John had gone into earlier. "We can order a second bed, the room's certainly big enough for it. I'll look online. Any preferences?"
"Oh," Sherlock answered. "John?"
Sherlock frowns a bit. "Mycroft is my friend. And my arch-enemy." He smiles fondly.
"Hello, Detective Inspector."
Sherlock’s phone chimes. ‘What are you doing?-MH’
"I lost the security feed! Someone knows we're here!"
"Mommy, why was that boy running?"
"Oh. Well as soon as she gets back let her know that babies are born."
"He didn't bond me. Wasn't even in the same room as me for nine-tenths of the heat, except when he rescued me from the Alphas. It wasn't for lack of me trying though. I propositioned him, Mycroft. Why? Why did he turn me down?" Then he stormed off.
Sherlock breezes in a minute later. He goes over to the refrigerator and pulls something out. As he turns, I spy a brain on the tray. He sets that down,  pulls out a bunch of colored pins, and begins pushing them into the brain.
"I was going to do it after supper. I had homework."
Now I feel really terrible. Greg leaves to find Mycroft, and I slump on the floor. What have I done?
Lestrade's fist clenches (the one that's not holding Sherlock's hand) and he takes a deep breath before continuing. "Sherlock, is your brother hurting you, or has he hurt you in the past?"
John swings the door open and realizes that they do indeed have visitors-several members of Scotland Yard are poking around their flat. “What is this?” John demands, Alpha challenging the others.
"I'm calling the police," Dr. Sawyer whispers to John.
"Y'know, I'm starting to think you all are having me on," Lestrade says. "Mycroft doesn't really exist, does he? The scary Big Brother isn't actually real. You made him up, and Dimmock and Sally and Anderson all just go along with it to see how long I'll believe he's real. You had me going there for a while, I'll admit. Good one."
Mycroft instantly puts it to his lips and begins drinking the broth. "Mmmm, this is good," he comments, overjoyed with the discovery. "I shall write a note to thank the Detective Inspector at my soonest convenience."
Jim shoved him off, growling "Westwood!" Then he jabbed something sharp into Sherlock's arm. "Let's see how you like this," Jim sang cheerfully. "My little Virgin." Seeing John approach, he stood by to watch.
"Bite me. Bond me. Please." The words are a shock to him, but he knows this is what he wants, the  man above him as his own forever. He has never asked this of anyone before, not even in heat. This man is different, special.
"I see."
The next few hours are somewhat of a blur to John. They do not find the murderer as Sherlock had expected, but they did get to have a nice meal at Angelo’s before they ran out the door to chase a taxi which Sherlock believed the murderer had taken. John’s pain medication had taken effect at that point, so he wasn’t in pain, but he knew he would be the next day.
Sherlock sighs, but he follows John obediently. He climbs beneath the covers, but John can feel his anxiety leaking through the bond.
"Right here," John soothes, slipping his hand into Sherlock's. "It's okay, they're doing an ultrasound to check on the baby because Irene Adler drugged you."
“Hey, get back! You can’t go under there!” John hears a voice call just as he’s about to duck under the police tape and go searching for his mate.
Sherlock stands then, and moves over to John. He wraps his arms around him and rests his chin on John's shoulder. They stand like that until the timer goes off. The spell is broken, and Sherlock the cook is back in residence. He darts around the kitchen, adding ingredients to the pie and whipping cream until he is satisfied. He's in a frenzy, yet John finds it magical and somehow peaceful.
"Call me. I mean it. I liked that kid too."
"Don't snivel, Mrs. Hudson," he is honestly proud of how strong his voice comes out as he speaks. There is no sign of the fear nor the rage that boils inside of him. "It'll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet. What a tender world that would be."
"Yes," I answer.
"What? You banned him? No! I want Mycroft! I'm going to see him!" Sherlock yells. He leaps from the bed, yanking out his IV and making blood spurt everywhere.
I crawl out of the log and he follows, taking my hand as soon as we are both standing. He looks around in shock at the group gathered. "You all came to help find me?"
"Fine. I just-I wanted to start over. But I think you should know a bit of my history beforehand."
"I'm not. I'm bargaining."
Sherlock nods yes. "So I went unconscious due to lack of a bond from you during my heat. You had to bond me to revive me."
"I took the heat suppressants, I thought my heat was coming on...knew Gregory was coming...took two, kept coming...two more...two more...now I hurt everywhere."
"I'm sorry it didn't work out."
"You're not John, who are you? Where is John? Is he okay?" The questions are rapid-fire so I can't answer them.
"No, I brought you in here to talk about John."
Slowly, Sherlock nods. “I’m okay with that.”
"So we need to break in tonight to find Soo Lin and convince her to translate the code."
No response. Well, that's to be expected. I take a quick sniff of the air. Mycroft is definitely in there, just ignoring me. Okay, take two.
"Sherlock! Sheeerrrrlock!" John shouts as he pounds down the street. "Sherlock!"
"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. Open it, please."
"Drugged him. Aphrodisiac. Won't kill him, don't worry. He'll be fine in a few hours. In the meantime, well, I'm sure you can find something to do." The man winks at John and saunters off.
"Sherlock Holmes," Jim breathed.
"I'm not contagious!" Sherlock argues.
Gregory's face hardens. "Do you three know who hurt him?"
"Yeah, okay," John agrees, a bit confused.
“I like helping people, and this was perfect. Being a surgeon was perfect for my adrenaline, too. I loved the rush of being in the operating room, being on a schedule to help make someone better. It’s the most wonderful thing I can imagine. Right up there with…..never mind. What do you like to do?”
As John was now sleeping, Sherlock and I waited quietly for Dr. Angelo. As we wait, Sherlock's hands smooth over John's hair in a manner meant to calm him. John gives a little sigh of contentment.
'Lestrade, babies born, come immediately. -SH'
"I need Sherlock's help. There's a code that I've intercepted, and I need his help to crack it."
Sherlock would sit next to John during the evening when John was watching the telly sometimes, so John would rub his hair and massage his scalp until he went boneless as a reward. The first time, John had followed instinct and leaned down to kiss Sherlock on the lips. He pulled away as soon as Sherlock froze. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have-“
"Gregory Lestrade. The Detective Inspector. I'll call him and have him arrest John, or if you'd rather we can deport him, or kill him-"
"No. I prefer my alpha to be of the female variety. Although I gotta say I hope my alpha stays as far away from me as he is right now, so that has to count for something."
"Sherlock's Omega has a clear history of Alpha abuse," I add.
Greg finishes the group with a "Good luck," as he enters. I take a deep breath and enter the parlor myself, ready to lay another ghost to rest.
I eye my Alpha. He speaks like an encyclopedia, which makes me wonder, "How old are you?"
“Murders, John, murders. The body wasn’t mine.”
"Both," Sherlock answers dryly, pulling the gun from deep within his Belstaff and pointing it at Moriarty's head.
"That's fair. We have supplies upstairs, if anyone would like to get cleaned up."
"Do you want to talk about it?" Mycroft asks.
He breezed into Detective Inspector Lestrade's office, slamming the door shut behind him. "I need your help."
"Sherlock, if you want to discuss feelings with me, then please sit down and discuss them. I will sit right here, in my chair, and you can sit in your chair and we can discuss this like rational adults."
Sherlock holds the phone out to Mycroft. "There you are, brother. I'm hoping the contents of this phone will make up for any inconvenience I have caused you."
"Good luck," Mycroft says brusquely, and the click of the dial tone lets Sherlock know Mycroft is done with their conversation.
"I can do that," replies Mycroft. "Why haven't I heard of this Perfect Match thing before?"
"Great, see you then," John replies, clapping Lestrade on the arm.
"What do you want?" he questions, ignoring the fact that he isn't Mr. Holmes. Yet.
Mistletoe? Thinks Sherlock, a bit confused. But that's holly! His thoughts are interrupted by John's lips, which descend on his in a momentary peck before he jumps away again. Sherlock isn't having this, however. He has dreamed of John snogging him since they met, and now that he's finally getting what he wants, he will not be denied due to John's stage fright. He grabs John's arm, slams him against the wall, and proceeds to snog John like his life depended upon it.
John walked through the bedrooms, looking for warm clothes that looked like they weren't worn often and thus might not be missed. Molly was down in the kitchen looking for food, while Mike was in the attic searching for warmer sleeping bags.
"Give me your book." Mycroft handed it over reluctantly, only to watch in agony as the book was tossed into the roaring fire. "Nothing is more important than your household, Mycroft. Keep it in line, then do other things." He raised his hand to his son's face, and Mycroft flinched away. This angered Siger, so he punched his eldest son after yanking the youngest out of his arms. Mycroft fell, directly into the flames. Then he walked out. Sherlock ran over to Mycroft the second it was safe, sobbing incoherently, but the damage to both boys was already done, and couldn't be washed away with tears.
"Yeah. They called the police on you. Please tell me you're not doing an experiment."
“Yes of course. What’s the fun otherwise?”
Now Sherlock looks skeptical. "No, I'm not."
"Molly, you can go first. Mike and I will watch John." I lead Molly to the bathroom, give her the clothes-Sherlock and I figured out long ago that one of the thieves was a female, and her size in case we were ever targeted- and leave. I repeat the process two more times for Mike and Jim. Mike doesn't speak to me, but Jim asks, "Why are you doing this?"
She promptly swats him on the arm. "No need for that ma'am stuff, young man, you'll make me feel old. Sherlock, can you go find Mikey,  please? He holed up in his room and won't come out. John, you take those boxes from Sherlock, and you and Lestrade come carry these boxes out to Mikey's patio. He wanted us to eat out there since it's so warm out lately."
"I see. Did he come into contact with an Alpha? Perhaps even in a nonsexual manner?"
"Pips John! Don't you know history?"
The man gives him an odd look, almost as though he is perusing John and John has somehow come up wanting. Then he leaves.
“Well, no.”
He resets John's leg and puts a cast on that. "Right, I'll leave some papers for you two, instructions on how to care for his cast and his ribs. Now then, why did he leap out the window?"
"Wassit?" John mumbles.
"That's a really...unique mixture."
"If you ignore your pyromaniac thieving disposition, sure," responds Mike teasingly.
"Yes," John answers, "but I'm still not gay. I've decided I'm Holmes-sexual."
"I'm out of the house," reports Mike.
John walks the boy over to the table, looping his arm around Sherlock's to support him in case he falls. When they get close, he loops his ankle around the chair and pulls it out. "Sit. What do you like to eat?"
The cabbie dropped them off in front of a discreet building. John stared up at it, but Sherlock charged in, leaving John to sigh and hurry after him.
"Where'd you go, man?"
"I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet."
It's the sight of her tears that grounds Sherlock back to reality. He realizes he's hurt a friend, and he shoots John a 'help me!' look. John gives him a look back that tells him he needs to apologize immediately. "Forgive me," Sherlock requests, "I've gone too far. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas, Molly." He leans forward to brush a kiss against her cheek. The moment he does so, his stupid phone goes off with Irene Adler's text alert.
"Mmph!" Sherlock complains, but he goes limp in John's arms.
"It's okay, John," Jim soothes. "Just keeping warm." Despite his protests, John curls into Jim. "You're freezing, John."
The conversation tells them of a case to solve regarding the sneakers, and that in twelve short hours a bomb will go off if the case is not solved. Sherlock hangs up, looking a bit troubled. He grabs the sneakers up off the floor and carries them upstairs to his flat, where he instantly begins twisting the shoes this way and that looking for evidence.Greg and John watch him for a bit, then when they realize there's no use in trying to engage him, they set up a date to go to the pub and Greg leaves after wringing a promise from John to keep him updated.
Jim's whole face is cut up and bruised. "You and I are a sight for sore eyes, Jim," John says lightly. "C'mon, let's go inside and get you fixed up."
"Sorry, I'm sorry," I chant. "Just a nightmare."
"The Coventry conundrum." Both men jump together, John leaping in front of Sherlock with a snarl before realizing the voice is Mycroft's. He relaxes his stance a tad, still ready to jump into action if necessary. "What do you think of my solution? The flight of the dead."
"Boring? It's someone who's dead, Sherlock!"
"Then congratulations. Excuse me a moment, please, I got tea on my shirt."
"You need to. It's not fair to him to ignore it."
"You're welcome."
Another hour and a forty minutes later, Sherlock has boarded and disembarked a ferry to Calais, France. The text from Mycroft comes just as Sherlock is leaving the ferry, 'What are you doing? -MH'
"Hey! You can't go in there!" The man ignores him, so Dimmock runs and grabs the man's arm. "Hey!"
"I didn't even enjoy kissing a man!"
It sounds like the Omega has everything planned out already, so John just says, "Yes sir. Goodbye, sir."
The next day is more of the same. John begins paperwork to help his successors who will be taking over after him-why, John isn’t quite sure, because they’ve been training together since he enlisted-and Sherlock practices shooting with Sebastian.
"Fine!" Sherlock agrees moodily, glancing around the flat morosely. John has tinsel and lights strung up everywhere. Little snowmen beam at Sherlock from their location on the coffee table. The Christmas tree lights twinkle merrily, reflecting off the wrapped presents below. There is also a sprig of holly above the entry to the kitchen, which strikes Sherlock as odd, considering there are no other decorations up on the ceiling. But John already seems stressed, so Sherlock decided not to question it.
Sherlock nods. He doesn't unlock his arms from Lestrade's waist, leaving the man struggling to walk. Mercifully, he manages to make it to Sherlock's hospital room without injuring either of them. He sets Sherlock onto the side of the bed and tries to back away, but Sherlock still clings to him.
"Well, if you've been listening, you'll know she didn't."
"You have a crush on Sherlock, so no."
'Oh, dear Lord, I did not need to know that,' John thinks to himself.
"I'm sorry, it's all my fault." Mycroft holds up a hand, and I fall silent again. After five minutes, he finally speaks. "Why?"
"Yeah, right back at you," John answers.
She hugs my mate too, and he looks as panicked as his brother. "Goodnight, Sherlock. Take good care of my son."
"Yes, Sherlock. It's Christmas, and your brother has no one to celebrate with. Of course I invited him."
John goes off to find a new shirt, handing it to Sherlock. The boy changes quickly, throwing his shirt at Sebastian. "Keep it, it's the closest you're going to get to an Omega."
"Get me my brother!" Sherlock screams, "I want to go home! I don't want John!"
Once breakfast has finished, John washes the dishes while the Holmes' discuss funeral arrangements. They agree that the funeral will be held while Sherlock is in Afghanistan, because he would be an awful guest anyway.
He finds him lying on the ground groaning as Irene leans casually against a window. "John," she greets.
"We asked this one, she doesn't seem to know anything," the man says."But you know what I'm asking for, don't you, Mr. Holmes?" the man demands.
"Oh my gosh, I've really screwed up."
I turn red and can't meet Mycroft's gaze anymore. "I thought, I mean, I just didn't want to tell him I'd never kissed anyone."
John stares at him in shocked silence.
“You can’t go home.”
.........................................................................
"Everything I've said tonight, it wasn't real," Irene offers desperately. "I was just playing the game."
“The phone is on the move. The killer was here!” John exclaims. “He took Sherlock! He has my mate!”
“Did you need anything else?” questions John.
"Not today," John says ruefully. "I should be done in the kitchen soon, but I need to get that cleaned." After fifteen minutes, the kitchen is clean and John sets off in search of his mate. "Hey there, what are you doing?" he questions, seeing Sherlock, sitting on the side of the tub wrapped in a robe with a gloomy expression on his face. He sits next to Sherlock on the ledge, ignoring the fact that it's wet.
We reconvene by the front gate as I ordered. Everyone is already gathered, and John is not in their midst.
I check our lab, thinking maybe he went up there to practice labeling body parts. He's not there.
"That's not fair!"
"Got who?" Sherlock asks.
"What? Really? Okay, that's gonna be the first thing you'll learn. I'll teach you how to shoot a gun second. Anyway, here we are, just throw your stuff wherever. Find a room and claim it."
"Sherlock, what is it?"
"Hi, Mom, it's John. Just calling to let you know that the babies were born."
John growls low in his throat. "Give him a few minutes, then we'll go after him. And don't believe everything you've been told. You're smart enough, challenge what you were taught. Look at your brother, you might just learn differently."
John smirks. "Yours wouldn't be the first naked body I've seen." Sherlock stiffens, causing John to feel remorseful. "Sorry, bad time to make a joke, but I am a doctor. That was the point. Honestly though, if I wanted to see you naked I could've by now." Sherlock glares in response. "Shutting up now," John tells him.
"I'd say because he cares for you."
"John? Are you okay? Can you hear me?"
“So they told me.”
"John!" Roared his father.
Sherlock nodded and grabbed his bag before leaving the room. He was silent as they made their way to the car. Unlocking the doors he glanced at John before getting in. Soon they were on the road again.
For the rest of the day John was trying to push away the thoughts of Sherlock. It was just so bloody hard. He wanted to just pull the man close and kiss him like he’s never been kissed before.
The class all shut their mouths and stared at Sherlock. He smiled and went back to working on getting his things in order. John watched him silently, trying to pinpoint his teacher’s problem. The teen gave up though after Sherlock started teaching the class.
“Why did you park so far away?” John asked with a laugh. Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled him the rest of the way to the car.
“Good,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock and drove away from the house. He was too attached. There was no turning back now.
“I have only one more complaint,” John said.
“He seems to have hit his head too hard,” one of the EMT’s said. “He should be fine, he just needs to rest and he’ll wake up.”
Sherlock laughed a bit when John waved towards him and waved back as well. He shook his head, sitting back against the fence at the top of the stands. The match started and although he was lost Sherlock still cheered whenever the crowd did.
Sherlock smirked and ducked under the water, swimming closer to John before lifting him out of the water and throwing him back.
“PE,” John told him.
Once they were there John hurried inside, ordering the biggest cone he could get. Sherlock laughed as he watched the cone being handed over to John. “You will never finish that,” he told him, ordering his own cone.
Sherlock smiled as he got into his own seat. “You look tired,” he said.
John was quiet for a while and Sherlock thought he wasn’t going to speak again. He was going to say something but then the teen spoke up. “That sounds lovely,” he whispered. “Thank you.”
John sighed in relief. “That’s good,” he said. “I would love for you to come. Have a fan in the crowd.”
John shook his head. He couldn’t. His dad wouldn’t like that idea one bit. “I’ll be fine at school,” he said. “Plus I have practice to go to. Don’t want to miss one of those unless I want the coach on my back.”
John shook his head. “Not a single bit of it,” he said. “I was on my way to the bus stop when they tugged me and started beating the crap out of me.”
Sherlock was already out and walking towards the car. He shot a glance over his shoulder before climbing in. Without a word he started the car and started to drive. He was still in a bit of shock. How could he be such an idiot.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and shook his head. “No, no, I’ll take you out for your birthday,” he said. “I’ll make sure you have a great time too. Your friends will wish they came with us.”
The quiz went well; for John at least. He was one of three that didn’t fail it, got the second highest grade out of the class to be exact. He was rather proud of himself.
That's why John was laying on his couch, watching as Sherlock scribbled away at the papers before him. He looked at the time. He had been at it for three hours now. That should have been enough time. John smirked and looked towards the ceiling. He let out an audible sigh, his hand falling to the floor with a thud.
John let out a small yelp as he was lifted out of the water and then dropped back into it. He splashed Sherlock again and started going back to the shore.
“Yours,” Sherlock said. He looked at him. “I might have something in my car to warm you up.” He went around and popped the trunk. He grinned and pulled out a blanket. “We can use this to dry off.” He handed it to John. “I don’t want you dying on me.”
John shook his head. “Never picked up,” he mumbled. “The nurse said I could rest here for the rest of the day though.”
"Oh yeah, I forgot you told me," Sarah said with a smile. "It's still scary I think. What if you get sent off?"
Sherlock nodded and resumed his post at John’s side. He kept his grip light as they walked out of the locker room. “I’ll drive you home,” he told him.
Now though, John was sitting in the auditorium waiting for his row to go up. He looked around at the group of teachers and grinned when he saw Sherlock.
Sherlock knew that everything was going to be alright. They had a time before John left. They were going to grow closer together and things were going to be just fine.
So, with a deep breath, John stepped up to the door and turned the handle. The smell of his old home washed over him and suddenly he could picture himself rushing inside to do a chore or to get homework done.
The moment that was over too soon. His lips hurt slightly when John pulled away but he didn’t care. Especially when he saw the tears falling from the other’s eyes. Gently he reached up and wiped them away.
“Okay Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said with a grin.
Gravitate:
John laughed at that, shaking his head. “No,” he said, rolling his eyes. “It’s my birthday idiot. Thanks for remembering.”
Sherlock glanced around the room. It didn’t look much cleaner but he was sure John wanted to get out of there as much as he did. He let out a small laugh and nodded. “Okay, let’s get going. Surely your father would want you home.”
“Then how did Bert here get his black eye?” Banks asked.
After a few moments Sherlock stood up. He needed to get the work done for the upcoming play. He was sure if he worked hard enough he would forget John and his date.
As he pushed open the door he looked around. His breath caught in his throat as he saw the place covered in dust and everything looked…old. Older than just a few months.
After he collected himself he drove away from the home, thoughts of the teen and what he could be thinking swimming through his head. He wouldn’t sleep well at all.
“My father’s dead,” John told him, answering the question he didn’t know was asked.
Sherlock grinned. “Thank you,” he said. “You won’t regret it. Honestly.” He turned quickly and left the room.
They made it to the market and John hurried inside. "You get us our drinks, I'll grab everything else," he said. He looked around real quick before pecking his lips and running off.
“You didn’t do the dishes last night and you woke up early to do them,” Sherlock said quickly.
On the other hand John was worried about his teacher, which then brought him to the fact that he still had detention. He had a feeling that it would be awkward during that detention. Sherlock just didn’t seem like himself and John had gotten so used to just hanging out with him.
“Mr. Watson,” Sherlock’s voice traveled easily across the room. “Would you mind explaining to me why you are late?” His eyes narrowing as he looked at the seventeen year old. John wasn’t as rowdy and rambunctious as the other students were. Sherlock didn’t mind him as much as he did the other students.
Oh those words sent a hit to Sherlock's gut. He should just leave, wait for John at the checkouts. It's not like he could walk up to him and tell the other that he was his. But what if John said yes?
Sherlock watched him go with a soft sigh. He shook his head. What is he getting himself into?
"Here, let me take a few of those bags," John laughed, taking the bags from Sherlock. He smiled softly, nudging Sherlock. "Are we better?"
“I can take you right now if you want,” Sherlock said. “I really don’t mind. Plus, if you walk home now you will get home at the same time as if I would drive you home at the normal time. It’s a long walk.”
His stupid date with the girl. Taking in another deep breath Sherlock calmed down. He marched to the auditorium and decided that would be it.
Mike’s eyes went wide. “Oh god, I’m so sorry. Happy birthday. Do you want to do something?”
John was tapping his fingers lightly on his knee as he watched the town passed by the window. “Are you okay now Mr. Holmes?” he asked after a while, looking over at him.
If only John's dad cared as much as Sherlock did. Though, if he did John probably wouldn't have spent so much time with Sherlock and they would have never ended up together. John was grateful for that.
“Night Mr. Holmes,” John called before running inside.
John nodded, moving to take a seat. He watched the two interact before the other teen left. John dropped his head back and let out a groan. “Finally, we can go,” he said, pushing himself up from the desk. “I’m starving.”
The teen nodded and shifted his bag on his shoulder. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes,” he said softly. “I’ll um….see you later.” He felt giddy and he wasn’t sure if he should be or not. It was just like any other time they went out. Nothing new. He gave a small wave to Sherlock before hurrying out of the room.
John grinned. “I’m honored then,” he hummed. The smile fell from his face when his house came into view. “Well this is it I guess. Dinner was great, I had fun.”
“How is he?” Sherlock asked as he came to his side.
Once Sherlock was back above the water he took in a deep breath. “Oh god,” he said, breathing heavily as his body shook. “I hate you.” He was laughing.
Turning it over in his mind Sherlock shrugged again. “Maybe I’ll make it,” he said. “I don’t know though. I have a full Saturday.” He saw John’s face fall a bit. “I was joking Mr. Watson.”
John nodded, turning on his heels to hide the frown forming on his face. “Have a nice night sir,” he said before leaving.
When the class ended John got up and went straight for the door. He didn’t want to stick around to get yelled at or make anything worse. After yesterday he was sure he ruined everything. John only wished he knew how.
John laughed and shook his head. “I know what I’m doing tonight,” he mumbled. “Thanks for the heads up Mr. Holmes.” He walked out of the nurse’s office feeling slightly better than before. At least he didn’t have blood gushing down his face now. “Am I allowed to warn the others?” he asked over his shoulder.
Sherlock nodded and tapped the teen on his shoulder. He knew the boy. “Mr. Banks, you and your friend here are coming with me to the office.”
When the bell rang Sherlock had all the papers graded already. He stood up, holding his hand up to stop the students from leaving. “I’m rather disappointed in most of you. I was expecting more people to pass. Honestly. You will know if you have to retake the test if I hand you your paper on the way out. I want you to review it and study. You’ll be taking the test again tomorrow.
John was walking on cloud nine as he walked into Mr. Holmes class the next morning. The week had been looking up for him. It was nearly the weekend and he had a date later that night. He couldn’t ask for anything better.
John groaned but nodded.
When the bell rang he dismissed the class. He stood up, deciding to go to the teacher room for some coffee. He was going to need it.
John shifted and turned onto his back. “I think so,” he said, looking down at him with a sleepy look. He reached up and ran his fingers through his hair. “Morning.”
John glanced at the clock and raised an eyebrow. It was nearly nine. Sherlock was usually an early riser. “How long have you been up?”
Sherlock watched John run out before chasing after him. He found him in the middle of the hall, hyperventilating.  The teacher quickly went to his side and grabbed his shoulders. “Breath John,” he told him. “Deep breaths. Calm down.”
John shook his head. He couldn’t tell him. He had to just forget about it. Sherlock would be able to read him and then the teacher would find him disgusting. “I’m just trying to clear my head,” he mumbled, his teeth chattering.
He didn't hear the rest of the conversation but he saw John coming over to him. "Hey, sorry about that," he said softly, putting the food on the belt. "She caught me and I couldn't get away."
John went to the car and sat against the edge of the car. “Right here,” he told him, patting the spot next to him.
A smile spread across Sherlock’s face, a warm feeling filling his chest. He knew that John would be alright.
“Do you think I can get another meal from there?” John asked, cocking his head to the side.
“Do you have it every day?” Sherlock asked. John shook his head. “Then you can serve a whole detention on the days you don’t have practice and serve half a detention on the days you do.”
John grinned, putting his book away and laughing when the class let out a confused murmur. This was going to be a fun class.
John quickly left the store and went to go sit in Sherlock's car. He waited for Sherlock to come out. He had to figure out how he was going to deal with this.
John shook his head. “I want to go.”
John smiled, gently nudging him back. "You're welcome babe," he said softly.
“John.”
John had to stop thinking like that too. He could just blame it on teenage hormones. That sounded like a great thing to blame wanting to kiss his teacher on. He wanted to do so much more though.
Over the past few months they had spent most of the time together. When John went out Sherlock would usually stay in and work on the next years lesson plan. He was already planning on how to visit John once he got to the school the army was sending him to. He could visit him on the weekend once he had time, help him study, distract him from studying. Sherlock was planning on being a bit selfish. But only for a little while.
John grinned and nodded. “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he mumbled. “She asked me out for tonight.”
"Actually, I'm seeing someone," John told her with a small laugh.  "He's waiting for me too so I'm sorry but I have to go."
Sherlock brought himself to school the next few days. Not wanting to really see John, afraid he was going to develop more feelings for him but there was nothing he can do. He couldn’t call out just because he didn’t want to see a student. They had only a few weeks left and he could handle it.
John licked his lips and looked over at him. “Like what?” he asked quietly.
John smiled and looked up at him. “Thank you for making it so happy,” he murmured, placing a hand over his. He linked their fingers and looked back to the television.
The recruiter led John away, speaking about what he was going to do when he landed.
Sherlock nodded. “Alright,” he said. He pulled up to the house. “This is you my friend.”
John looked up at him. “Thank you,” he whispered back. He nodded again and reached for his hand. He squeezed it gently and shut his eyes.
“Really?” John asked. “I’m sure you’re not even allowed to let me in the car.”
Sherlock didn’t see John until Friday. The teen was out on Thursday, Sherlock had to believe he was sick. When Friday rolled around he didn’t see John in class.
Sherlock opened his arms when the other seemed to be heading for him and soon he was smothered with John. He pressed his face into his hair as John pressed his face into his shoulder.
John pulled away after a few moments, smiling up at him. “Do you think I can stay over?” he asked quietly. He didn’t want to go home after tonight.
Sherlock watched them for a moment before leaving. He was going to have a chat with his boss.
John nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be eighteen, just in time for school to end really,” he laughed.
He wasn't surprised when he heard the groan from John, he only sat up a bit, looking over his shoulder. "Do you need something, Mr. Watson," he asked with a smile.
“Anytime,” Sherlock said. He paused. “Well, not really anytime. If we frequent here too much then people might get suspicious.”
Sherlock nodded, moving silently over to John. He gently touched his shoulder. “John, wake up,” he said quietly. “Come on, time to get you home.”
When the teen turned though, Sherlock had to bite the inside of his lip as he saw the beaten look on John’s face. Blood seemed to cover the front of his shirt along with his sleeves where it seemed John was trying to stop the bleeding. “Mr. Watson, to the nurses now,” he said. “Class, turn to page 345 and read chapter eleven.”
John nodded, looking down and kicking his shoe against the floor. “Yeah, I was wondering if you would like to go to that Chinese place again,” he said softly. He looked up at him, giving him a nervous smile.
The match was almost over, just a few minutes left and the opposite team was up by one point. Sherlock was really getting into it now. When John intercepted the ball from the other team he jumped up and cheered.
John’s lips were rough, just how they looked. His hair was soft at the back of his neck and Sherlock let his fingers push through them.
John has to admit that he had butterflies in his stomach. He was nervous about graduating for some reason. Sherlock helped him get dressed into a suit that he bought him and told him how proud he was.
John was easy to read most of the time. His emotions played across his face like a movie screen playing a movie. Though, there were times he was harder to read than his older brother.
John bit his lip and nodded. “I did too, Mr. Holmes,” he said. He tugged on his fingers. “Thank you for the rides home.”
“I was worried about you,” Sherlock said. “When I left I saw it raining and knew you would be out and about in it.”
He pulled away and gave him a smile, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Come on, we got breakfast to get to.”
John shook his head quickly. “No sir,” he said. “I have chores to do at home; I don’t want to spend all day doing them.”
John grinned, kissing him back. He pulled him closer, letting out a small sigh. He didn’t stop it this time, letting Sherlock do as he pleased.
Sherlock noticed John laughing whenever he looked up at him. He couldn’t keep the smile from his face, probably confusing the other students. After a while Sherlock had enough of John’s chuckling and put the students on quiet study.
“Are you sure you want to pass this in Mr. Watson?” Sherlock asked, glancing up to him. With the firm nod he received he raised an eyebrow. “Good. I love the confidence. You may have a seat.” He watched John move back to his seat, noticing that he wasn’t limping at all and that most of the bruises were already fading. He smiled a bit before going about grading the student’s paper.
A waiter came by and took their orders. John sat back and smiled at Sherlock. He couldn’t believe he was doing something with his teacher for yet another night. Not that he minded. He enjoyed spending time with Sherlock more than anything else at the moment.
John grabbed his sweater and started using that to clean himself. “I have to do laundry anyway,” he said. “I really don’t want to get in anymore trouble as it is.”
Sherlock had completely forgotten about the match. “Yeah, I’ll watch it,” he said. “Don’t you worry; you’ll have me rooting for you in the stands.”
John smiled. “That sounds really boring, but fitting,” he laughed quietly. He stood up as well, biting his lip. “I don’t have clothes.”
“I don’t forget things easily Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said with a sidelong smile. He grabbed the paint cans and brushes before he went over to a house they were supposed to be painting. “Let’s get to work.”
John grinned and pulled Sherlock into a hug. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes,” he said. He quickly unbuckled and jumped out of the car.
Sherlock couldn’t keep the proud smile from his face. “Good on you,” he said as he opened the door to the nurses office. No one seemed to be there. He sighed and shook his head. “Never here when you need them.” He looked around as he tried to find something to stop the bleeding from John’s nose. He grabbed what looked like gauze and handed it to the teen. “I suggest you go home after this. Get some rest.”
“Can you please talk to me?” Sherlock asked. “I have less than a day with you left and I don’t want it to be had in complete silence.”
“Clearing it of what?” Sherlock asked.
John swallowed hard; the way Sherlock looked right now, smiling at him like he knew every answer in the world. “Brilliant,” he whispered. He licked his lips and glanced down to Sherlock’s lips. They were so close. All he had to do was lean forward and he would taste them, feel them. They looked soft.
“Get out of here,” Sherlock said. “You won’t have to make anything up.”
At the end of the day John made his way back to Sherlock’s classroom, trying not to seem like he’s too excited. He didn’t want to make Sherlock think he just a giddy kid. But he was. He was so excited. This was going to be the best birthday in a while. He could feel it.
“I do stink,” John murmured as he sniffed his shirt. “I promise I’ll take one before school on Monday.”
Sherlock nodded, shifting his hand to the wheel. He needed to think. This was ridiculous. When he pulled the car to a stop by the park he turned to John. "What if you get deployed?" He asked quietly.
Sherlock watched him go and let out a small sigh of relief. John didn’t hate him as much as he thought he did.
John grinned and splashed him. “No you don’t,” he said, swimming on his back.
“He said something about you taking him home,” the nurse hummed, tapping her pen against a note pad.
John looked out the window at his house and nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be squeaky clean,” he said as he unbuckled his seat belt. He didn’t move from his seat though as he looked at his house.
Sherlock smiled, happy he could make John smile like that. It was a good feeling. “Yes we can,” he said. “We can go out to eat, we can do whatever you want really.”
When John came back out he held out his jacket for him. John kissed his cheek before pulling it on. "Where should we go out to eat?" He asked with a small hum.
John just didn’t know what to do.
Sherlock shook his head and shoved the cup holding all his pens off his desk. “Useless,” he muttered and left the office.
Their dinner was quiet, John talked mostly about his upcoming rugby match, trying to convince Sherlock to go. Sherlock knew he couldn’t say no to the teen but he knew he could have fun with him.
John’s smile dropped a bit but he nodded. “Of course sir,” he said. He turned and left the room.
Sherlock ruffled his hair and shook his head. “That’s disgusting,” he laughed. He frowned as John’s house came into view. They were closer than he thought. “Well, I guess I’ll see you Monday.”
John laughed and nodded. “Sounds like a great plan Mr. Holmes,” he said, buckling back up. “Let’s go where the wind takes us.”
John hummed softly and shut his eyes. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes,” he murmured.
John dropped his head as he chuckled and ran his fingers through his hair. His phone started buzzing in his pocket. He pulled it out, careful not to get paint on it as he checked who called him. He swore under his breath and stood up. “I have to go Mr. Holmes,” he said.
Sherlock nodded, driving out of the parking lot. He was silent most of the time, focusing on the road. After what seemed like hours Sherlock could feel John staring at him. “Do you need something Mr. Watson?”
John nodded. “I’m sure they went to this school though,” he told him. He paused and stopped walking. He looked down the hall at another teen. “Wow,” he mumbled. “That’s him Mr. Holmes.”
John smiled. “Thank you sir,” he said before grabbing his bag and running off.
John smiled, cupping his cheek with a grin of his own. “I think I do,” he said with a grin. He kissed him again, just a quick one. “I’ve wanted it for a while. I’ve thought about it so much.”
“That means hours,” John murmured. “Come on, lets get out of bed. I’ll make us breakfast.”
The older man laughed quietly and nodded. “Yeah, I think I can do that for you,” he said. “Meet me here after classes end and we can go together.”
John smiled softly, looking up at him. He glanced around before nodding. "Let's go home."
When Monday finally came Sherlock felt like crap but he knew he would have to push through the day. He was sitting at his desk, watching as the students filed in.
"You weren't here for everything else," John spat, unable to help himself. He shook his head, trying to laugh it off but it sounded forced. He clenched his teeth together, trying to let out some kind of pent up anger. "You know what, it doesn't matter. You don't have to pretend like you want to be here. I'll have all my stuff out of your place by tomorrow and you'll never have to see me again."
Sherlock blushed, shaking his head. He kissed him gently before he started to get their food ready. Today was going to be a good one despite their hiccup.
“Sure it is, Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said. “Have a good night. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Hugo Watson watched as his son made his way over to him. His eyes traveling over his frame with a small smile. When he was close he decided to speak up, "You haven't been home in a while."
“I tried, that all went down the drain years ago though,” Sherlock smirked. “You’re the first student I had faith since I’ve started.”
Sherlock sighed and bumped his shoulder. “You can talk to me,” he told him. “You know that.”
They were kissing again and Sherlock couldn’t be happier. Though he cut this one short, putting a hand on John’s chest “Let’s go somewhere more private,” he told him “My place? Unless you want to go home.”
Mr. Jamison looked to John. “Is that true?” he asked.
Sherlock nodded and gave his shoulder a small squeeze. “Come on, let’s go,” he said pulling back from the lake.
His row stood up and he gave him a wink before he started to move. He balled his hands into fists to try to stop himself from fiddling with them. He moved across the stage, looking across the crowd. He spotted his dad and his step faltered a bit.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked as they approached the boy.
Mike turned back to John. “So, I’m going to take her to that diner down the street from here,” John told him. “I heard she really likes it.”
“Mr. Holmes,” John laughed, giving his teacher a look. “God, you’re horrible. First you spend too much time with your favorite student, now you’re insulting the others. You’re not the type of teacher to follow the rules are you?”
Once everyone had the test he went to his desk, slowly sitting down. “Begin,” he said in a low voice, grinning at the students.
And so, they left it there for the rest of dinner.
Sherlock smiled and opened the door. His hand slipped from John's, letting it fall to his side. "So, do you know what we may need?" He asked with a smile.
The bell rang and everyone quieted down. Sherlock was still sitting there, not talking or anything. After ten minutes the students started talking.
John smiled and looked over at him. “Thank you again,” he laughed. “I don’t think I can really thank you enough for all you are doing for me.”
“That means leave you two,” Sherlock said, shooting a look at Mike and John, “now.”
John chuckled softly, shrugging his shoulder. "That's alright," he said softly, pulling him into a quick kiss. "This is perfect." He pulled back before sitting down. He pulled out the snacks he picked out, motioning for Sherlock to sit as well. "I chose this just for you." He held out some chocolate for him. "I saw it and thought you needed a bit of sweetening up.
Sherlock gave John a small smile before he cleared his throat and stood up from his desk. “Alright, books away. We’ll be making things go boom today.”
John was graduating. He never thought the day would come where he could finally move out and start his life new. But it was coming, the next day he would walk with his classmates, his friends, and then he would be set free to live as he pleased.
John Watson, you scored a one hundred. Higher than I expected I must say. I’m proud of you. Please remain after class so we can talk about your reward.”
“My friends don’t have anything planned, I don’t even think they know it’s my birthday,” John murmured, looking down, his shoulders dropped. “If you don’t want to that’s fine.”
John stopped and help back the soft groan as he turned. “Yes sir?” he asked, giving him a small smile.
John shook the thoughts from his head as he found himself in front of Sherlock’s door at the end of the day. He took in a deep breath and knocked on the door. He heard the come in and pushed open the door. “Hello Mr. Holmes,” he said.
John wasn’t sure how he had gotten back to the flat, but he found himself standing just inside. He felt numb to it all. It was as if he expected it.
"Me," Sherlock finished for him. He sighed, running his fingers through his hair. He needed to think about this rationally. John was an adult. He could do as he pleased. "I understand. I want to leave as well."
“You’re right, but it got you moving,” Sherlock hummed as he led him to his car. He opened the door and waited for him to climb in and get settled before moving to his own seat. “You seem to be much better than earlier. Sore?”
John turned and looked at him. He put his hand to his lips before holding it up.
Sherlock pulled out a small note book and wrote down John’s name in it. He bit his lip and sat back. This was going to be interesting.
John looked up, giving him a hard look that said he didn’t want to talk about it. Sherlock knew he was going to have to pry and potentially ruin the night or fix him, or he could just leave it and let John roam alone in his mind.
“I love you too,” Sherlock said softly.
“He seemed very happy for you yesterday,” Sherlock said quietly. He turned back to his desk and began packing again.
Sherlock smirked and sat down next to him. “I have at least one thing in mind,” he said, wrapping his arm around his shoulders and kissed him again.
When John stepped through the door he sighed and nearly dropped his head against the desk. John frowned when he heard the sigh. “I’m sorry Mr. Holmes,” he mumbled, not sure what he was sorry for to be honest. “If you don’t want to do our last detention together, I can just go home.”
She nodded. “I’ll try what I can, I’ll call your father John,” she said. “You’re getting hurt too much around here.”
“Hey, I took one already,” John stated in his defense. “It’s just the showers at the school aren’t that well without proper soap.”
John rolled his eyes, huffing out a laugh. "Sure you are," he muttered. "We were just talking about how I'm moving out."
“May I ask you something?” John asked, looking over at him. He let a soft smile fall across his face as he saw the look on Sherlock’s face. He got a small hum for permission. “What was bothering you yesterday and this morning?”
John chewed on his bottom lip, peeling off the skin with his teeth. “Actually, I should probably walk home,” he said. “It’s not that far.”
John thought for a moment, licking his lips. “Do you remember that restaurant you took me after my match?” he asked.
Sarah nodded. "Are you happy school is over?" she asked.
Though he didn't have long.
“Oh,” Sherlock mumbled. He felt a weight get lifted off his shoulders that he didn’t really know was there. He bit his lip. “Well then, you can clean up the room a bit and then I’ll drive you home. Sound good enough for you?”
Sherlock watched him go in with a frown. He started the car again and drove away. He had to just forget about this. It wouldn’t be any good for him to keep thinking like this about his student.
John smiled a bit, climbing down from the bed and hurrying after the older man. “You wouldn’t do that,” he muttered, grinning at his side.
“The coach already did that, he didn’t answer.”
“It does to,” John laughed softly. He grabbed his hand and gave it a small kiss. “I’ll still be leaving on Friday whether we stay in bed or not.”
Sherlock shut his eyes and pulled up a chair to sit next to John. “I’ll stay with him then until he wakes up,” he told them. “Thank you.”
John laughed quietly and nodded. “Yes Mr. Holmes,” he said, standing up. “Thank you for dinner.”
Sherlock watched him, letting out a quiet laugh. He was quite surprised he was asked to go to dinner again. He was excited though.
The next day John sauntered into class, smiling from ear to ear. Mike stopped him before he got to his seat. “What’s got you so happy, mate?” he asked. “Got laid last night?”
John bit his lip, letting out a small laugh. “You’ve got a bit of blue stuff in your hair sir,” he told him. “From yesterday.”
John swallowed hard, watching him as he licked his finger. He scooted a bit closer, placing his hand between them. “Thanks for giving me such a nice night,” he said softly.
Sherlock shrugged. “Don’t really understand the sport,” he said. “I was just waiting for you guys to finish.”
But for now he was going to let them have their moment. They were going to need it.
When he opened the door he stopped short, surprised to see another student in the room. He stopped short, staying where he was as he watched the other student. He didn’t know who he was. Sherlock glanced to John, letting a small smile pass over his face. “Come in, Mr. Watson, I’ll be with you in just a moment.”
“It’s true sir,” Sherlock said. “His wallet was stolen as well.” John nodded quickly in agreement.
After school though John would spend more time with him than at home. The weekends they would just spend at Sherlock's flat. John would let him do his work for a little while before demanding his attention. It wasn't his fault though. He didn't tell the other that he had signed up for the army, it was done before they got this close. He would be gone in August for training. He didn't want to tell him honestly.
Sherlock smiled. “Exactly,” he said. He picked up the tools he was given. “You hold them up and I knock in these nails?”
“Yeah, you do,” Sherlock whispered, reaching over and wiping some ice cream from his cheek. He smiled, bring his finger to his lips and licking it gently. “All better.”
Sherlock's head snapped around, his eyes narrowing at John. Leave? Why was he leaving? He wanted to ask but he was sure it would end in a fight. Mostly because Sherlock would make it end in a fight somehow.
Or so he hoped.
They kissed until they had no breath left and Sherlock was the one to break it again. He pressed their foreheads together, smiling like an idiot. “Oh my god,” he said softly. “I can’t believe this is happening. You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.”
"Hey," she laughed. She looked at Sherlock. "Wow, it's a small world, Mr. Holmes.  I didn't think I would see you both here."
John pulled out his wallet to pay for the food he grabbed and looked back at her. "Yeah, I'm excited. I'll get to spend some time with friends and family before I have to leave."
Sherlock looked him over. "From the looks of it you are ready for bed," he stated, referring to the boxers John was just lounging in.
John let out a small groan and his eyes opened slowly. “Oh god,” he mumbled, rubbing his head. “I don’t want to feel that again.”
“What are you doing tonight?” Sherlock asked before he could get out of the car. “Are you going to hang out with those friends of yours?”
`He was starting to worry again but tried to push it out of his mind. He tried to listen to the teens’ conversations but John’s name never came up. He found it odd to think that none of his friend’s knew about his whereabouts.
Odd, he thought, that was the teen that beat John up. He shook his head and started walking again to his room. It wasn’t long after when he saw John limping down the hall looking worse than that one morning.
John licked his lips a bit. “Mr. Holmes, I have a question to ask you,” he said. He was given a small nod. John started pulling at his fingers a bit and looked around. “I was wondering if I could skip detention today. You see I have a date and well…”
Sherlock leaned against his desk and shrugged his shoulders. “It’s fine; you’re a teenager who has loads of hormones in their bodies. A pretty girl asked you out and you said yes, nothing else mattered.”
John looked over at his dad and didn't even notice when they were congratulated for doing such a great job. When they were told they were free to go John quickly got up and went to go see his father.
John laughed and tackled him into the water. He started to swim under water to get away from him. He felt Sherlock next to him and he was pushed to the side.
“Yeah, I’ll take the ride,” John said. “My practice ends at five so maybe five thirty?”
When there was no response Sherlock gave up and went to sit in the living room. This was not how he wanted the night to go. If he could just get into John’s head for a second maybe he would be able to figure out what was wrong and help the other, but John didn’t even want that. Didn’t want his help.
“Watson was defending himself,” Sherlock said. “He has no right to get the same punishment as the attackers do.”
John smiled as he took the brush from Sherlock and the can of the red paint. “With pleasure,” he said.
Though after class on one Thursday John came up to him, smiling over at him. Sherlock glanced up at him, raising an eyebrow. “Yes, Mr. Watson?” he asked, sitting back and crossing his arms.
John sighed, looking down at his feet before he looked at Sherlock. "No, you don't need me. You just don't want to work. Come on Mr. Holmes, I don't want to stick around here anymore."
John grinned. “Okay,” he said, “sounds great.”
Sherlock let him. His hand went to the back of his head and he stroked his fingers through the short hairs. Suddenly it was no longer about him and all about John. He felt the fear and guilt behind the kiss. He felt the impending loneliness that they both would endure.
John nodded. “What about practice?” he asked.
Finally John is done with school. Though things are not going to be that great for long.
“Why didn’t your date go well?” Sherlock decided to ask.
“It will be okay,” Sherlock whispered quietly, cupping his cheek now. “I will be here when you get back and I will follow you wherever I can.” He kissed him again and felt his chest fill with love for the teen in his arms.
Sherlock would have protested, but she had been throwing up every couple of hours for the past three days, and simply didn’t have the strength to do so.
I lean in, and slip my tongue past his lips.
I want to feel his hands in my hair, his skin on my skin, his lips on my lips... his erection rubbing between my legs...
“I don’t have condoms. I’m assuming you don’t either?”
That was a woman.
Happy birthday. I’m sorry if this gets to you late, I’ve been swamped. I won’t bore you with the goings here, although I will say that my bloody bunk mate is still snoring. He gave me a pack of cigarettes for Christmas though, so I’ll let him off. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the gift, if of course it gets to you at all.
Fuck, I have really got to stop thinking like this in the day.
Sherlock took the bud from him, almost cautiously. An odd combination of clicking, meowing, and humming reached his ears.
“Has he got anything weird in here?” Rosie asked, hand on her hip.
Sherlock pouted, and let out a frustrated whine. John quickly grabbed the bottles of whipped cream and chocolate sauce along with the box of strawberries.
He has a point.
Falling asleep is one thing, but staying asleep is quite another.
I am completely awash with pleasure.
“Boy or girl?”
John did it again, and again and again.
“Yes.”
"Never bothered watching that film."
Johns breath was hot, and minty by Sherlock’s ear.
‘So don’t break,
“Yes, Alright. Thank you for the invitation.”
Thanks john(!)
His voice is a mix of content and worry as he looks around behind me.
“This is nice. We should do it more often.”
Sherlock used a chair to get the game down off the top of a cabinet. One second she was reaching for the game, and the next she was on the floor.
John turned his attention back to Mrs Holmes, who continued asking him questions, seemingly oblivious to what her son was doing underneath the table.
“Rosie, please. But, I was saying you could come and sit with me- I mean us... at lunch.”
A look of glee appeared across Sherlock’s face.
“You Alright?” John chuckled, lightly thumping Sherlock’s arm.
John clambered back on to the bed slid on a condom, and applied the lube.
Sherlock jumped back out of the chair to grab a biscuit off the table.
Irene shrugged her off, and darted off down the road.
“On your hands and knees then.”
“I need to talk to you.”
Bruises were already forming on Sherlock’s skin. Bruises that marked Sherlock. Marked him as Johns.
Change of plans. 221b Baker Street, 2 o’clock.
Sherlock moaned involuntarily, sending vibrations along John’s cock.
It’s not a king sized bed in a luxury hotel, there aren’t any candles, there aren’t any roses, we didn’t have a nice dinner, we don’t have any champagne, but I don’t care.
“No problem. You’ll get the hang of it.”
John beckoned her to turn back around by squeezing her hands.
“In any way that footwear can be nice... yes? Why?” Sherlock asked, rolling over so he was on his stomach to get a better look at the picture.
John nodded, and moved over to allow Sherlock to sit beside him. She unraveled some bandages, and opened up a packet of gauze.
27th of February 1913
“I am aware of that.”
“No.” John said sternly.
His moans are growing sharper, more like whimpers now as he gets close.
Sherlock age: 11
“Oh fuck...” John murmured. “You are full of good ideas tonight.” He praised.
John looked up the flight of stairs before wandering up them. There was a closed door, like a front door, at the top of the stairs. John pushed it open slowly. It was a decent sized room with a desk, a chair, and a sofa, which was currently occupied by Sherlock. He was sprawled out on the leather, his hands clasped in front of his face.
Sherlock shook her head as she swung her arms around his neck.
“No because then it sounds like I’m the one wailing.” She murmured with an amused tone.
“Now, that is interesting. To me, at least, but what interest is it to James?” Sherlock queried, leaning over johns shoulder to get  a better look.
“Oh right.”
Said boy had hardly noticed his brother’s presence, and was nibbling at his pizza crust, completely ignoring the scene playing out before him, not even bothering to look up.
“He’s like a baby giraffe. I told you your legs were too long.” Irene said to him as she tried to keep him upright.
Sherlock drew his lips into a smile.
I feel him wrap his arms around my shoulders and nuzzle his face in to the crook of my neck, murmuring sounds of understanding.
He jumped, and placed his hand on his heart.
“Pedant. I love you.” He says with a smile as he nuzzles my nose.
“Ok, here you go.”
John smiled warmly up at him, and pulled him down for a chaste kiss.
Well then.
“Ooooh...” Sherlock groaned low in his throat as he arched his back in to johns touch, eyes screwed shut, all sorts of ungodly noises escaping him.
“It’ll be even hotter when I don’t have these on.” She said as she guided his hand back to the waistband of her underwear.
It’s hot and passionate as he darts his tongue in to my mouth and slips his fingers in to the waistband of my underwear.
“It’s six o’clock.”
Honestly, I’ve never felt more juvenile in my entire life.
Sorry this a bit rushed, but I wanted to get on to the next chapter... 😏
“Not for me, but for you... I’d love to see you with that gag in your pretty mouth.” John husked by Sherlock’s ear.
She stopped feeling faint whenever she remembered she was carrying his child.
“Tell me.”
“What happened?!” John gasped, his hands clutching the telephone.
No, he’ll still want this.
He threw some equipment into the sink, and wandered into the living space.
6. Soppy overgrown toddler
Sherlock careful positioned herself on the sofa in a way that John’s leg wasn’t at risk of being kicked. John wrapped his arms around her, holding her close. She lay still, staring off in to the space in front of her while she waited for johns breathing to even out. It was gentle, and warm on the back of her neck as he fell asleep, his grip on her never loosening. It was almost as though he was afraid that if he let go for even a second, he’d lose her. She knew the feeling. She snuggled closer to him, and fell asleep herself, john’s heart beating rhythmically against her back.
When he was half way to John’s house he spotted the blond sitting on a bench, looking defeated. Sherlock pulled up and despite better judgment he climbed out of the car and walked over to him.
John nodded. “You should come to the game this Saturday,” he said. “It will be great.”
“Hello Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said, not looking up from the papers he was working on. He had calmed down a bit from before. He had pushed down the weird feeling and pulled himself together.
What was wrong with him? He never felt this odd in his whole life. He stood up and grabbed his cigarettes. He pulled on his jacket and left the room.
Sherlock had a feeling that wouldn’t work though.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and thanked the girl behind the counter for the cone before looking at John. “Where are we going to sit?” he questioned the younger man.
Mr. Jamison shook his head and got up to pick his pens. “You don’t need to throw a fit,” he yelled after Sherlock.
John nodded slowly and stood up. “Thank you Mr. Holmes,” he said. He wasn’t ready to lose the one thing he was proud of in life. “See you at lunch.” He went off towards the gym.
He didn't even know that the man knew the graduation date. He quickly pushed himself of of his trance and hurried off the stage. Soon he was back in his seat and he wanted it to be over with quickly.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand tightly as he looked ahead of him. He knew he would start crying again if he looked at the other. “I’ll send you the details of graduation as soon as I get them. I will write as much as I can. The recruiter will give…will give you the information to send letters to. I don’t know if I’ll receive them right away…”
John' shrugged his shoulder, looking down at his feet. "I've been busy," he muttered before he looked up at him. "I'm surprised that you show up at all."
The teacher took back his hand, dropping it to his side. He didn’t know what he was doing. He didn’t want to push the boy away anymore. “Is your father coming to get you?” he questioned, scanning the injuries that he could see.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, sitting across from him. He shouldn’t have let this happen. He shouldn’t enjoy their time together so much. “I do too,” he hummed softly.
With a deep breath he left his room before heading to the nurse’s office. He knocked on the door and nodded to the nurse, smiling a bit when he saw that John was asleep.
John moved beside him and leaned against the desk. “I’m done picking up,” he told him with a smile. “We can head out now.”
“Oh fuck!” John exclaimed as he hastily did his jeans back up.
I reach down between us and begin fiddling with the cool metal of his belt buckle. He lifts his hips to allow me to slide his trousers down along with his underwear, and suddenly, it all becomes very real.
“How do you know?” I ask, inviting him to show off.
He gives me a coy grin as he tucks a stray curl behind his ear.
“No.” Sherlock said, looking at the two girls conversing.
Sherlock felt a smile tugging at her lips.
She was tall, and thin, with sandy brown hair in braids resting on her narrow shoulders. Sherlock quickly glanced over at the wiry teen before looking over to the Watsons. All three of them were blonde, Johns was more of an ashy blonde, but regardless, all of them bore a close resemblance. Sherlock and Mycroft could not have looked more different, the only thing they shared being their neuroticism and piercing, blue eyes.
John grinned and pressed a tentative kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“Oh come on, who are you kidding? You look like a shrivelled up kidney bean!”
“I need to pee.”
I move my hands up in to his hair and tangle my fingers in his blond tresses.
Sherlock had been replaying the lyrics to the song in her head over and over for weeks, and it was staring to drive her mad.
“I’m gay.” John blurted out quickly. “Well, bisexual to be precise. I have a boyfriend, and I love him. If any of that isn’t ok with you, I am more than happy to find another place to sleep tonight.”
Oh Christ...
“Alright sweet thing. TV now?”
“It’s ok. It was definitely worth it. The way you made me feel at the end... damn.”
“I’m sure we’ll win if I have you there cheering me on.”
“Yes, I would.” Sherlock said, handing the baby back to her sister.
“I know.”
“I was distracted.”
“Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?” The older boy asked, looking at John through the wavy fringe that had fallen over his eyes, which made him look somehow even more scary.
“I don’t know! I don’t-“ John sighed. “Know.” He finished quietly. “I should go.”
“Can I talk to you a second? Actually, I need to show you something. Come.”
“I like to hear you. Like to hear you scream my name.” John groaned, thrusting his hips as fast as he could.
Who wants shower sex, who wants blindfolds?
“We’ll know more soon. You’ll know as soon as we do, ok darling?” Mrs Watson said softly.
“Yes, and now I have no books.” I say flatly.
The night before he left, Paulette appeared at his front door with a box of jam donuts.
“Christ, you’re horny, aren’t you?”
“Yes.”
Sherlock quirked her eyebrows at him.
Sherlock furrowed his brows, seemingly unconvinced.
Since having met him, Sherlock has grown another inch or two and is now taller than myself, but he’s still built like a noodle, so carrying him isn’t exactly a difficult task.
This is badly written smut, as it’s all in Sherlock’s head, and he’s an inexperienced little baby.
“I think Harry would need to be here for that to be possible.” John quipped when he noticed the unsurprising absence of his sister.
“Oh god!”
Mrs Holmes gushed in to the room, and was by her daughter’s side in an instant.
“I’m intrigued.” He said, putting his book down.
“Get over here. Now.” He orders, his military history very evident as he speaks.
Fuck, I love it when he does that.
“All available guards to B Dorm! Assault on an inmate! Need medical assistance!”
It was sweet and gentle as they took their time to explore each other’s mouths. Sherlock eventually pulled back for breath and pressed her forehead against John’s whilst her mind raced.
“You’re amazing at everything...”
“Telephone for you.”
The red headed girl smiled awkwardly, then disappeared amongst the dancers.
“Oh, and they’re crotchless, by the way.”
The older boy appeared in the doorway to see the mess that was his little brother.
“Alright.”
“Oh, how good you are.” John cooed, and kissed his lips.
“Where is he?!” She howled as she gripped the carpet under her. “I’m going to bloody kill him!”
“Mmmm...” He hummed when John placed his lips on his neck.
He says it with an air of surprise, but his voice is as mellifluous and even as ever as he sips on his tea.
“What?” John asked, his voice slurred.
“Mmmmm...” The brunette hummed as he sank further in to the bath.
“But no, I have a real hobby. I told you about my summer at Bart’s hospital. I’m sure I could pick up some work there.”
Sherlock sighed deeply.
JOHN’S POV
“I have read this nine times since I was imprisoned, please take it and pray that I never have to lay eyes upon it again.”
Sherlock’s lip quivered.
Sherlock scrabbled up on to the bed, and sat cross legged with the bottle between his ankles.
He’s already hard.
“Shrapnel.” She said, not questioning.
By the time I add the second finger, he’s scraping at my back with blunt nails, tugging at my hair, groaning profanities.
He might not even want to.
When he traces my lips with his tongue, I open my mouth without hesitation.
“Coming.”
“Now, just your heart and blood pressure to check.”
Our lips are still connected as I begin to slide my hand up and down his cock, but John pulls back a few millimetres every few seconds to exhale a shaky breath. When he leans back in, the kisses are heated and messy, a sense of desperation clear as I open my jaw wider to allow him better access.
“Hang on.” John said, grabbing his wrist to stop him from opening the door.
Johns voice cracked as he spoke.
“Yes. I am.”
“Oh you bastard...” John grumbled.
“Sugar?”
“Pull my hair...”
John spun him round, making him gasp as he was pushed against the wall.
She took a swig before reluctantly handing it back to John.
Sherlock looked so cute from this angle John couldn't help pressing his lips into his.
“Maybe you should...”
“Yeah, she knows.”
“Anyway, are you going to see him?”
He had all but passed out after the third round.
“Mmm?”
“Damn...”
Sherlock normally prided himself on being exceptionally intelligent, but this was definitely an act not even a person of average intelligence would make. Only those who were, colloquially put, stupid, would do something like this. But while his normally highly active brain was left to stew in a soup of pent up hormones, his judgement had been extremely mangled. He blamed John. This was entirely his fault. John went out of town. What was Sherlock supposed to do? Just sit and write his blog? As he sat in his restraints, he came to the conclusion that this was probably what he should have done.
This made John chuckle, which earn’t him an eye roll from Mycroft.
“Not long.” Molly said.
“Regardless of whether I was going out or not, neither is an excuse for you to invite a girl over to have intercourse with.” Sherlock protested as his brother tried to push him out of the way.
He nods and plants a kiss on my cheek.
“Ah!” Sherlock yelped when a smack hard enough to bruise landed.
“Mmmm...”
“Oh yes. The teachers are good. The course work is a little easy though.” Sherlock shrugged.
Molly left shortly after, leaving Sherlock and John alone.
He forcefully pushes the broom in to my hands.
“I was hoping you’d know the answer to that.”
“Hello, Sherlock.”
It had been a few weeks since April Fool’s day.
“Feels so good... love the way your cock feels- ah!” He gasped, earning a groan from John.
She was tall for a girl, but the slender teen towered over her. He towered over a lot of the children in his class, lucky as otherwise he would have been the subject for much more bullying than he already was. Many children felt too intimidated to go with in a five yard radius of him. Molly sure didn’t feel the same. Sherlock was sure she’d climb into his lap given half a chance. Probably a quarter of a chance he rethought as he caught her staring at him, her tongue just about ready to fall out of her mouth.
Lips.
He groans, and bucks his hips up, rubbing his erection between my legs in a way that causes the most pleasurable friction. I can’t help but gasp out a moan, my cheeks immediately flushing when the noise hits my ears.
It was around the third mouthful of the pathetic excuse for casserole that I spotted one of the new guards. I’d never had one of those moments where everything just stops. Everyone else around you becomes invisible, and the only person you can see is that one person. He’s blond, average height, muscular build, tanned skin, and very, very attractive. He’s just looking around himself curiously, taking in the scenery. He isn’t jumpy or skittish like like the other young guards. It usually takes them weeks to settle down, but he seems right in his element. It’s normally only the more mature guards who settle in straight away because of past experience. Surly he’s too young for that. There’s a reason why he’s so calm though. There must be.
“Thank you.”
John kissed Sherlock hungrily, and slid his hand under Sherlock’s jumper, making his abdominal muscles tense. John glanced down between them, and saw the skirt tented up around Sherlock’s erection.
Sherlock couldn’t help the moan that tumbled from his lips.
With shaking fingers, Sherlock managed to pull the football shirt John had failed to change out of over his head.
“Thanks. I like yours too. But...” he started as he stood up. “I like you better without them.”
“Oh. Does that make us friends?”
“Are you sure...?”
“Is it safe to come in?” She asked, followed by laughter by Irene and Rosie.
“Parents... mycroft...?”
Sherlock blushed, and thanked him quietly. She had already that thought that morning when she first put on the tasteful, cotton candy dress.
John was used to getting changed in front of other boys as he was on the football team, but this was Sherlock. It was different. He pulled off his own shirt somewhat tentatively, his well toned torso now in plain view. Sherlock watched John out of the corner of his eye as he slipped into the white sleep shirt. He was gorgeous underneath his shirt, just as Sherlock had imagined. He pushed the dream out of his head, and changed into his pyjama bottoms. He was completely unaware that johns eyes were glued to his lanky form. John had to be a bit more tactful when changing, and turned away from Sherlock as he slid off his trousers, and pulled on the loaned pyjama bottoms. They were too long, like the shirt, and hung off his limbs like clothes on a washing line.
****************
“John...” Sherlock moaned softly, arching his back into John’s touch.
“Well wouldn’t you be?” Mycroft asked, rasing her eyebrows.
She sometimes wondered what it must be like to be able to leave somethings to the imagination. She could tell May liked John. She could always tell.
Mycroft paused for a moment. He enjoyed the solitude that his persona brought him. He’d never considered for a moment that Sherlock felt differently.
A huge grin broke on to john’s face as he breathed a sigh of relief.
“I could... deal with it for you.”
John let’s out a low groan and tightens his hold on my hips.
The air had finally started to warm, the days were longer, the sun peaked through the clouds, and the wind was nothing more than a friendly embrace.
“AGH!” He cried, jerking his head up as he came all over his torso.
Sherlock felt a shiver run down his spine under johns intense gaze.
“Fair enough.”
“Here you are love.”
“Sure. Do you reckon Irene is ready to go?”
“The worse of two evils.”
“I’m so sorry sweetheart. I’m so sorry that I’m not there.”
I’m proud of how even and calm my voice sounds, hiding the storm that’s curling around inside me.
I go to quicken my pace, but a shooting pain sears through my body and up my spine. Waddling it is then.
“Sherlock, the nurse will be here any minute. Do you want to walk around again?”
John grimaced, and hesitantly followed Sherlock in to the house.
“A word about your release?”
John was sure they wouldn’t be allowed back to that cinema after today, but he didn’t care.
Sherlock tilted his head up to press a kiss to John’s lips. He stared deeply in to Sherlock’s eyes, and affectionately bummed his nose.
Sherlock had worried she wouldn’t have anything interesting to say, but seeing as John hadn’t done anything either, she didn’t feel as inadequate.
I take a quick look around before making my way across the room.
“As soon as work duty is over, volunteer to sweep up the greenhouse, Alright?”
I allow my tongue to explore his mouth and he even slackens his jaw to allow me better access.
Sherlock cried out when he felt John brush his prostate. He knew it wouldn’t take much more.
“How is she?”
“10 months.”
“They Are Indeed. I would have bought you one, but I didn’t think you liked them.”
We’re sitting very close together now.
“Yes. And I’ll ask you questions, because really... I don’t know very much about you. And I can’t tell with a look.”
Comment if you’d like a one shot of mycroft and this ‘girl’, because obviously I should have four stories on the go 😆.
“Why are you Here?” He barked.
“Be back in a little while.” Sherlock called as they slipped out of the house.
“I got the call this morning. I have until Friday.”
John was pleased at how Sherlock was responding, the sight of him squirming and pulling against his restraints was one that turned him on immensely. He decided to up the ante a little by dragging the cube further down, down to Sherlock’s chest to circle his nipple.
“Wait for me.”
“You ok?”
“Are you ready?”
He peers through the glass window in the door and out in to the hallway before nodding to me that it’s safe for us both to leave.
“Oh, yes of course.”
Sleep was definitely a necessity, and the pair finally drifted off the sleep, neither of them worrying about the fact that Mrs Hudson had heard everything.
Mycroft looked as immaculate as always with the exception of her eyes, which ever so slightly crazy. One was bigger than the other, and she wasn’t blinking.
“I need a favour.”
John laughed then, and shook his curls.
“You ok, sweetie?” John asked, his voice softened.
“You mean you fancy him.”
He looks up at me with his icy, feline eyes, as if he’s staring right in to my soul. I’ve noted that this is what he does when he’s ‘deducing’ people. It’s a little unnerving, but it’s also extremely hot.
"St John's Ambulance course." John said as he checked under Sherlock's curls for any bleeding, or bumps.
John immediately regretted that. He really had to learn to filter what he said.
“Could you please... do whatever it is that stops her wailing?” Mycroft asked, gesturing to the rather too large to be carried toddler slung about her hip.
“Everyone likes popcorn.” John chuckled as he slumped down on the sofa.
“Sleep.”
“I’m glad.”
“I know right?” He chuckles, raising his eyebrows in that oh so alluring way he does.
We’d been terrified someone had heard us that time round, so a short hiatus ensued, but the way Sherlock is looking at me right now says that the hiatus is about to be lifted.
“Sherlock, this is my friend John Watson.”
John nodded, turning his attention back to the tv.
"Just for a walk round the corner. Won't be long."
“Of course. I’d better set an alarm though.”
I think he’s blushing.
“I think it’s a fairly common game played among young children.”
"I don't know. How was your week?" He said in one breath, anxious to change the subject.
“What are you doing?”
Each morning, I wake up, and my bed is empty.
John bit back a laugh.
“Yeah.” I chuckle.
“I trust you.”
He gets to go home at the end of the day.
I have to stay behind.
"Thanks Mrs Holmes."
John chuckled, thoroughly amused that Sherlock’s idea of conversation was him spewing random facts, and john just nodding along.
“Oh, I see.”
“Well, I did not think I would climb your hair.”
“Oh fuck.”
“Ready?”
The small girl turned her heard to look at her mother and beamed.
Mrs Watson grinned broadly, and wiped the remainder of her tears on her palm.
“I mean that’s ok-“
“Technically I’m not in your room.” Mycroft sneered.
Shooting.
“A shop in town. I’ll take you at some point, if you like.”
Sherlock watched with a dazed expression as John dipped his head, and began pressing kisses down his body. He arched his back as Johns tongue swiped across his skin, moans tumbling from his mouth, pleasure gripping him.
I grin, and move my lips back to his neck before continuing my decent down his body, unbuttoning his shirt as I go.
“Better get out then.” He grumbled, choosing to ignore the now pulsing erection between his legs.
I suppose now, in comparison, what is a little tar in my lungs?
“Shit. Stay here.”
“What did you want to talk about?” He asks as we enter the room.
Beloved mother, sister and grandmother.
“Ok, then... we should go. I’ll come by for you in the garden before lunch tomorrow?”
Happy Valentine’s Day!
“Oh...” John moaned.
Sherlock and John talk on the phone.
John positioned himself at Sherlock’s entrance, hands gripping his waist, bunching the skirt up. Sherlock was relaxed and ready for him, so he thrust in with very little hesitation. Sherlock let out a small yelp, but it quickly turned in to a moan after the initial shock.
On a chemical level, I defiantly felt a raise of endorphins, and something else raise in the biological department...
“Watson, one of the inmates in the kitchen has cut his hand. Adler has taken him down to medical, and I need assistance in the cafeteria.”
“You ok?” John cooed softly.
He does as I say, a little smirk playing on his face as push his narrow body firmly up against the cold wall.
“He did!”
“Sherlock!” A voice called from downstairs.
“Lovely to meet you.”
“It’s such a shame he’s not here.”
“Yes.” Sherlock said hastily.
“Boys! Lunch!”
She let go of Sherlock’s hand when Lily brought the tea over to them.
“Tomorrow.”
I can tell he’s practically bursting at the seams to tell me.
The idea of Sherlock living with me, the idea of waking up to him first thing in the morning... I sigh in content.
“Me neither.”
Is he going to kiss me again?
“Yeah-ah!”
I shouldn’t be surprised he knows all of this. Like myself, he can read a persons’ occupation in their hands, and their marital status in their clothes.
She smiled down at the squirming baby who was still held by his cousin.
“Ok, then where did you get them?”
“Mrs Hudson made you tea.”
She falters for a moment before flinging her arms around my neck.
“Your mother and I want to discuss something with you and Harry.”
I have no frame of reference, but from what I know about the science of kissing, it reached the stated expectations.
“Are you alright?” Mycroft asked in a hushed voice so as not to wake Lucy.
He’d never been touched like this before, and it was getting him close to the edge faster than he wanted it to.
Sherlock brought his hand up to pump the remaining inches that he couldn’t fit in his mouth.
“I need to have my bandages changed. My mother needs to contact a nurse.” He flinched when he ran his fingers over a particularly sensitive spot.
“Mmm... oh.” John moaned, arching his pelvis.
“I wouldn’t say no.”
Mycroft nodded. She entered the room, leaving their mother in the hall to her own devices.
💖Sherlock: you’re making it easier to miss you. Thanks.
Sorry this took forever. Enjoy!
“Which one, dear?”
I notice something flicker across his face for a split second, concern, if I’m not mistaken, but he quickly goes back to being serious.
It wasn’t until he’d stopped feeding that he opened his eyes.
“You sure, darling?”
He sat down next to his mother, and quickly texted John.
John takes his teasing to another level when he buys Sherlock a very special present.
Sherlock huffed his now sticky fringe out of his face.
That’s the first time he’s said my name. I can’t help but notice a certain warmth in my cheeks as I watch him walk away.
“Yes.” She muttered tersely.
“Mum?!”
John goes away for the holidays, and when he returns, there’s a Young lady waiting for him.
“Now, what should I do...?” John mused, sitting back to skim his hand over Sherlock’s pale thighs.
Sherlock grinned as John connected their lips in a soft, tentative kiss.
Suddenly, he stops.
Sherlock paused her singing, and looked down at the once again sleeping baby. She sighed in relief, and slumped back in the chair.
The brunette snapped her head up and returned her attention to her sister, who met her eyes in a steely glare.
John smirked, then pushed Sherlock’s skirt up, and pressed kisses along his milky thighs. He moaned softly, and wove his hands into johns hair, tugging slightly. He squealed when he felt the cool gel come into contact with his most sensitive area.
Sherlock felt his breath hitch.
1st of January 1914
“Hey... you know this is probably one of the last opportunities we’re going to have for you to fuck me like the dirty criminal I am...”
Sherlock was already stretched and ready for johns cock, but he still gritted his teeth at the initial feeling as John began to slide in to him.
“She is my everything!” Sherlock exclaimed.
“I’ll cope.”
For the first time in weeks, Sherlock wasn’t woken by the screams of her baby. It was still screaming, but it was her mother... and rather than screams of hunger, they were the jovial kind.
I brace myself on his thighs as I move my head in towards him.
“I love you too.”
“Uh huh, and how long have you been on your way out?”
“This vibrates, doesn’t it?”
“What?” She asked.
“Yes, I just... Well, you know.”
It was summer, so she was wearing her coolest clothes, including a light blue blouse, and a grey skirt. She was making the most of the fact that she could still wear socks. She’d have to trade them for stockings in a few years, just as she had seen Mycroft do. They arrived in town after a short walk, and tram ride.
‘The origin of species’.
He grabs me by the belt, and pulls me in to him.
“Of course you should!” I exclaim, making Sherlock jump and drop his noddles down his front. “Use your talents for good.”
I spot him in the break room, cup of tea in hands, bags under his eyes, a discarded newspaper lying before him, fulfilling its duty instead as a coaster as he places his too full mug down upon it.
“Sorry, John.” She said, quickly pulling back.
“Are you sure you’re ok?”
Now she screamed for him to leave.
“Ah!” Sherlock gasped when a smack struck his thighs.
His movements are slow and precise as he pumps his wrist up and down my shaft.
The large bulge in his trousers looks so tempting...
Sherlock giggled, and dropped his head back down on johns chest, snuggling in to his side.
“I can’t wait.”
“I’ll leave you to it.”
Sherlock age: 5
“Sherlock, John’s here for you.”
“Hello, Sherlock!” She mused, jumping up to sit beside him.
“Mmm... Agh... nnnngghhh!”
“Sherlock? Do you need me to stop?”
She remained still, just watching him, her heart breaking. He calmed down after a moment, and turned to look at her.
“Oh! Ah! Oh, god! Yes, yes yes!”
Fuck.
Sherlock’s gaze was flickering between his lips and his eyes, their faces getting closer and closer.
Sherlock’s breath hitched, sadness ebbing at her, but she wouldn’t let it show on her face.
He’s stood at attention, second nature to him of course, watching over a few of the inmates who are out getting their morning exercise.
He passed a flannel to Sherlock, then sorted himself out before slumping back down in bed.
“Would have saved us this conversation.”
I move my fingers to his collar and begin unbuttoning his shirt. My lips travel further  down his body, planting kisses on each inch of newly revealed tanned skin.
He pulled his trousers and briefs down his legs, and threw them behind him.
“Sherlock, I have to.”
“Try not to come out before I come home.” He whispered quietly.
We never discussed things as simple as our education.
“Oh, ok.”
“Sorry I didn’t warn you.” He murmured, looking up to see Sherlock standing between his knees.
“Ah!” Sherlock screamed when the cube directly touched his nipple.
He locks eyes with me and grins.
Sherlock nodded his head in the direction of the classroom.
He nods in understanding, a seductive grin playing on his lips.
John wasn’t saying anything. He was staring down at his hands, breathing shakily.
How do I feel about playing doctor with John? Ecstatic, frankly, but I think a simple ‘fine’ will work here.
Sherlock shook his head.
There I was thinking Mycroft was a completely soulless asshole with a pie addiction. Who would have thought he had compassion?
“You’ve gone weird.” John mumbled as he tried to pull Sherlock’s shoes off.
“Spread your legs then.”
Just a humourous chapter here. Comment if you’d like a first Valentine’s Day chapter.
And you know it's gonna hurt, being cut in two,
Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh as she walked over to him, nor could she help the tears that sprung from her eyes when he began to walk towards her.
3. Confrontational
Sherlock rolled over in johns arms and frowned at him.
11th of October 1909
“Mmm!” Sherlock groaned, throwing his head back as John immediately started abusing his neck. The hot water cascaded down around them, soaking their hair, tingling their skin. Sherlock was desperate to be touched, desperate for release, desperate for John. The blond seemed to be intent on teasing him though, running his tongue along Sherlock’s skin, nipping at his collarbone, in short, driving him insane. He needed more. He reached down, and shoved his hand between johns legs.
“Because, I can’t very well tell them what I was actually doing. ‘Sorry I’m late coach, I was balls deep in my boyfriends ass’.”
Sherlock looked as if he was about to cry at this.
Now I suppose all I have to do is get him out of here.
Oh fucking hell. Of all the inmates, of all the fucking-
I manage to resist, not wanting to seem too eager.
“The minute we walked in.”
Honestly. He wouldn’t allow himself to like Rosie. Although she seemed very clever, and interesting, she was a threat. John liked her, and she could take him away. Sherlock was more than happy when johns told her he couldn’t walk her home as he and had plans with the cynical brunette. Sherlock and John walked over to the latter’s house exchanging chit chat, but Sherlock could tell John was tense. John fumbled around for his keys for a moment, and after successfully getting the door open, invited Sherlock inside. Sherlock quickly made his deductions within about five seconds. John lived with his mother and sister, neither of whom were in judged by the lack of women’s coats. Johns father was out of the picture, figuratively and literally. He wasn’t in any of the pictures in the hall, or the living room. He hadn’t died, he’d left. Johns mother had a good job, which was how she’d managed to keep such a nice house on one pay cheque. It would have to be a large one to live here. She worked long hours, and was often not home for dinner. The number of take out menus on the fridge led him to believe John was often on his own. He decided to keep all these thoughts to himself. John could practically see the cogs turning in his head, and just stared at him in awe.
“She’s of that age, dear.”
“That’ll Be dinner. I’ll go open the door, and you know, get the food... for us to eat.” John muttered, slipping past Sherlock to open the door.
“Oh, some things are.”
“There’s tea for you in the kitchen. Shall I bring it in for you?”
“And yet I saw you following him about, and having lunch with him in school.”
“Jesus.” John groaned as he felt Sherlock clenching around him.
The one thing I still don’t know though is what he did to get in here.
“Fair enough.”
He chuckles, and steps out of the door way and in to the hall.
Harriet was stood in the living room with her mother and Mrs Holmes.
“I know, I miss you too. I think about you all the time. It’s the only thing keeping me going.”
Sherlock blushed, and hid his face in johns neck.
“Oh!” Sherlock gasped, whipping round to look at a grinning John.
John’s eyes roll back in his head as I reach my arms up to allow my thin, nimble fingers to tug lightly at his soft hair.
“Why is it cool?”
John was sat at the dinner table surrounded by his comrades and commanding officers. There was laughter and jokes, but it all seemed forced. The reminder that they didn’t know how long they would have to fight was fresh in everyone’s mind. The only thing that had John in a good mood was the letter he received along with a gift basket from Sherlock.
All she could see were arms and legs from the squirming bundle in molly’s arms.
“John?”
Dressed in her nightgown, Sherlock was sat on the bed, book in hand.
Double update because they were both so short. Enjoy! Loving the comments, they really make my day. Shit, that makes me sound really sad... wait I’m on AO3, we’re all a bit sad. ;)
“Oh shit. Well, this is what you get for what happened last year.” John said as he bent his head to take a closer look.
“Nice to see you.”
“I see.” Mycroft said, casting her eyes down at the clothes surrounding her sister on the floor. “Wait here a moment.”
He nods, and makes a move for the door.
“Anyway, Rosamund, you were saying?” John blurted.
John chuckled. Sherlock felt him lean in towards him, his minty breath hitting his cheek.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand before pulling away, and walking down to the stairs. He waved, and blew Sherlock a kiss before jogging down them.
“Thanks for coming Rosie.”
“So I guess that was the job he left us for.”
John took used his free hand to reach down again, and slipped the vibrator as far as it would go.
“Dirty boy.”
John meets Lucy
“I’m gonna cum- I’m gonna cum- I- ah! AGH!”
“Please.”
She turned to look at her eldest son.
“Are you Alright?
“Yes, sir?”
I wearily wave an arm at him, words completely failing me.
John was standing at the foot of Harry’s bed, steely eyes glaring at her, arms crossed in front of his chest. He was clearly annoyed, but also a little frightened of the consequences might be.
After a power nap, it’s back in the car, and back to work. I get posted to the cafeteria just as lunch starts. The boy walks in with a group of other inmates and sits down in a table corner. He is really very attractive. I have identified as bisexual since I was 17, but I’ve never met a man in person who’s taken my fancy; not till now at least. That very person is sat no more than twenty yards away from me... and staring right at me. Normally when I catch him, he looks away, but this time, he doesn’t. Instead, he chews his bottom lip, rather coyly if I might say.
B Dorm.
Merry Christmas. This is your third at the front. I can only pray you’ll be home for the next. I’ll try and telephone you later. I miss the sound of your voice.
“Of course! Oh, I’m sorry dear that you’re fighting with your mother, but I’m glad to have you here.”
“It’s Saturday.” John groaned as he sat up, rubbing a hand through his unruly hair.
“Sorry, mother. See? Pointless.”
“I don’t like that.” Sherlock muttered, inhaling sharply.
“That’s just a taste of what’s to come.”
Fuck, my voice sounds wavy.
Sherlock and John get their revenge on Mycroft.
“Lucy down for a nap?”
Dear john,
Mrs Hudson and Mycroft were stood in the corner watching the pair.
Sherlock let out a sudden squeak when she felt Johns thumb rubbing the bundle of nerves between her legs.
‘I can think of another thing you could suck’ I think to myself with a grin.
‘Nah, of course not. He’s just a mate.’
“Hi.” He garbled out, singular syllables being the only words he could manage.
“Can’t say I have.”
‘mmm! Ah! Yes! Yes! Yes!’
We all await your return with great enthusiasm.
And there he is.
John gripped Sherlock’s shoulders tightly as he reached his high. Spurts of white liquid shot out the end of his cock as he orgasmed, straight down Sherlock’s throat. Being rather experienced now, he took it all without gagging, swallowed, then sat back to wipe his mouth. John was breathing heavily, his eyes fluttering as he came back down.
“No, I could do with the walk.” Sherlock admitted as she pulled on her cardigan.
“Right... pants off.”
Sherlock fumbled blindly with the zipper of Johns jeans, never breaking their kiss.
“Starving.”
His face his right by mine now, his warm breath tickling my skin, his nose just skimming my cheek.
“I’m going to post this then.” She sighed as she struggled to lift herself from the chair.
“Come on then. Grab the lube as well.”
4. Is there anything in particular you’d like me to write?
“Thank you. Do I get a lollipop for behaving so well?” He teases coyly.
“Do you want to get on your back?”
“Nice blouse.”
Sherlock was in too much discomfort to have sex again quite yet, but he made no objection to the blow job he received in the disabled toilets.
“People do.”
I wearily nod my head against his neck as I support myself against him, traces of his stubble grazing my cheek.
“Am I in trouble too John?” Sherlock teased, playfully poking John’s cheek.
“Apologises. Now, here is the ‘something pretty’ I promised you.”
John turned around, and walked away, sure not to walk too fast.
“Fuck!” I exclaim involuntarily, my eyes flying wide.
“Shall I gag you?”
Rosie shrugged.
“I’ll be right back.”
“I can’t, Sherlock. I won’t.”
A distraught Sherlock confronts John.
When ones while future is flipped upside down, one must focus on these menial things.
Sherlock looked up, and into his eyes.
“You know what... feeling anything is what lead me here in the first place.”
Sherlock stared up at John with wide blue eyes. His voice was quiet, and seductive as he spoke.
“I expect she’ll be even more of a prat then before.”
Oh I don’t like this.
“Do you want me to take her, or...?”
JOHN’S POV
The boy, John, looked startled, a look of confusion on his face.
Maybe another time I’ll get him to use his hand cuffs on me...
“Ok.”
“Fuck...”
His voice cracked as he explained what was going to happen, but Sherlock didn’t hear any of it.
“I just need to take care of something out here. I’ll see you inside.”
“He wants his mother.” She said softly, kind eyes regarding the dark haired girl in the bed. “I think he’s hungry.”
Sherlock let out a low moan as Johns silky voice licked at his ear.
“Oh shut up.”
“John...” I moan against his lips, my hips still bucking with his.
It was sad. He wanted to remember it for something more. For his mother’s homemade cookies, or her warm inviting hugs.
Panic started to set in. Where was his dad? He started to run now, looking in every room of the house but it was all the same. Untouched. Unlived in for what seemed like months.
The students stared at him before they started talking amongst themselves. Sherlock could see a few students planning what they would get from the teacher but he knew they wouldn’t come close. “Okay, everything off the desks, just a pencil.” He started passing out the test, counting how many students would fail the test as he passed.
Sherlock opened his mouth to start telling John’s story but Banks beat him to it. “We were walking around yesterday and then this bloke here,” he pointed to John, “pulls my buddy into the alleyway and starts beating him up.”
At the end of the day Sherlock packed up his things, wondering how he was going to get through the ride to John’s place without making things worse between them. That’s all he was worried about. He didn’t want John to hate him for his own problems. There was something bad about that.
“We don’t have to go,” Sherlock told him. “We can stay here; let you rest before you have to go.”
“Yeah,” John sighed, rubbing Sherlock’s side. “I’m not going home though. He can’t control me.” He sat up and kissed his cheek. “It’s getting late. Should we go to bed?”
Sherlock smiled as he watched John smiling proudly. “So, Mr. Watson, what do you want for your reward?” he asked.
John nodded and grabbed his bag. “See you tomorrow at the same time Mr. Holmes,” he said as he climbed out.
John shook his head. “Not really,” he shrugged. “I could stay up a bit more.”
Early the next morning John stood in front of his father’s house. He had left Sherlock with a note that said he would be back before their breakfast date.
He felt like fireworks were going off in his head. This was amazing. The first kiss with the man he had been thinking about for so long.
Mike laughed. “Good choice,” he muttered.
Without a word he sat down and looked over at his student. “You’re going to get sick,” he told him quietly.
John smiled at his teacher as he ordered, unable to take his eyes off the man. He licked his lips, smiling softly. Though when he turned back John turned to look away. He didn’t want to get caught staring.
John looked up at him, his smile grinning up at him. “Really?” he asked. “Oh thank you. Thank you so much. We can go after school tomorrow right?”
“Not quite, you’ll have a week left,” Sherlock pointed out as he drove to the restaurant. “One long week.”
Sherlock reached over and brought his ear forward. “You should, it looks like you’re growing fungus back there.”
Sherlock gently ran his fingers over John’s back as the teen slept. It was their last week together. Sherlock couldn’t believe the summer had gone so fast. It felt like graduation was only a day before and they had months together.
This included spending time with the man that seemed to steal his heart. It was going to be easier for them. The last few weeks at school were rough, they barely spoke and when they did they made sure it was school friendly.
Mr. Jamison sighed and looked between the two groups. “Alright, suspension for all three of you,” he said. “John, you’re out of the rugby season for the rest of the year.”
John shook his head quickly. “No, you have work to do,” he said. “I need to run some more anyway.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, sitting down in the seat. “I should be pulling out your chair, you’re the birthday boy,” he laughed.
Thinking like that would end him in jail.
John gave a small nod. “I love you,” he whispered before letting go of his hand.
“I’m not a boy,” John said, sticking his tongue out. “I’m a man.”
“I’m going to be taking a long shower whether I get dirty here of not,” John laughed as he turned to look at their work for the day. “I’m going to be leaving early today, don’t forget.”
Mr. Jamison sighed, running his fingers through his graying hair. “Sherlock, there’s nothing I can do now,” he said. “I’ll have the police come in for this matter, have them talk with both of the boys and I can possibly kick the other boy out of school. Right now though I can’t do anything about the system. I will bring it up in my next meeting.”
Sure enough at five thirty John showed up, a large smile on his face as he approached Sherlock. “I saw you watching,” he told him. “Do you like rugby?”
“Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said. “Please stay for a moment longer.”
That was right. John was on the rugby team. He could tell by the look on John’s face he wasn’t going to get anywhere with his words. “Fine,” he murmured. “You don’t have to go but I want you to take it easy.”
John sighed but otherwise stayed silent. His eyes were flickering from one item on the menu to the next.
“You’re welcome,” Sherlock whispered softly. “I’m here for you John, you have to remember that.”
John nodded and quickly went inside the car. “Start it, start it,” he said eagerly.
Mr. Jamison stood and raised an eyebrow. “Want to run that by me one more time Holmes?” he asked.
Sherlock let out a small chuckle and nodded. “Yeah, you’re as bad as they get,” he murmured. “No one should let their kids near you.”
“Good morning,” he said in return. He pushed himself up and pressed a firm kiss against his lips.
John smiled, leaning into his side as his head spun. “Thanks,” he said. “Do you think there’s some pain meds in here?”
John nodded. “Yeah, very sore,” he sighed, dropping his back against the seat. “It was much worse this morning. I could barely think straight.”
“You too Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said. The door was shut seconds later and the man couldn’t take his eyes off the student as he walked into his house. He sighed softly, trying to collect himself once again. He hated watching that man walk away. After a few moments of just watching the house he pulled himself together and drove away.
Sherlock had stopped writing and looked up at John. “A date is not a reason to miss your punishment Mr. Watson,” he said. “You know that.”
“You’re welcome,” Sherlock told him. “Next game I don’t want to run after you into the locker rooms.”
Sherlock let the corner of his mouth turn up and he nodded. “Yes, I’m okay now,” he told him.  He pulled up to John’s home and gave him real smile. “Alright, this is it Mr. Watson.”
“You look tired,” Sherlock smirked as he took off his glasses. John opened his mouth and quickly shut it as Sherlock raised a finger. “You look tired but you’re early so you didn’t stay up late last night to finish them, you woke up early.”
They were left alone. Sherlock let out a deep breath he didn’t know he was holding and gently ran his fingers over John’s forehead.
John smiled and nodded. “Thank you sir,” he said. “I promise you I will make it up to you.”
Sherlock let out a relieved sigh, rolling his eyes at the same side. “I don’t think anyone would like to be hit by a man two times their size,” he said. “Other than bad how are you feeling? Feel like you can walk?”
Sherlock smiled, standing up to meet his gaze.  “You really want to know?” he asked quietly. John nodded, licking his lips. The teacher grinned and leaned just a bit closer for dramatic effect. “You told me,” he whispered.
Sherlock shrugged. “Anything, we’ll drive around until we can find something to do.”
It made no sense.
Sherlock smiled as he watched him. He dropped his head to his chest for a moment, thinking about what was going on. He shook himself from his thoughts and drove away.
The final bell rang and Sherlock sighed in relief. It was the end of the week and he wouldn’t have to see any of his students over the weekend. He couldn’t ask for anything better at the moment. He was packing his things when there was a knock on the door. He raised an eyebrow. No one ever stayed after on Fridays. “Come in,” he called.
John sighed and sat up. “Alright,” he said, stretching. He licked his lips and yawned. “Are you coming to the match tomorrow?”
John nodded and took them to the bathroom, changing into the bottoms and taking off his shirt. He folded his clothes and put them under his arm. He left the bathroom and smiled at Sherlock who was one the couch. He set his clothes by the door and went to join him, laying with his back against his chest.
John nodded. “The best,” he laughed softly. He reached over and took Sherlock’s hand as they started driving. “Thank you.”
When the bell rang John stood up and was heading for the door when Sherlock stopped him again. “Mr. Watson, you did well on
As Sherlock spoke John tightened further into a ball, wanting to be as close to him as he could be. Everything he was saying was amazing. He wanted it all, but it felt like it would never come.
John nodded and slowly unbuckled. He wished he didn’t have to get out of the car. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said quietly.
Sherlock nodded once again. “Yes, they must not like when the best student in the class gets the best grade. Bunch of idiots if you ask me.”
Sherlock laughed. “I’m not but I really don’t care at the moment,” he said. “A student is in need and I stay after most often anyway.”
It didn’t take long for John to fall asleep, snoring quietly. Sherlock glanced down at him when he heard the noises and smiled. He never thought he would get to see the young man so peaceful. He settled his head back down and fell asleep soon after.
Sherlock nodded and stood up. “Come on then,” he said. He grabbed his arm and helped him up. “Thank you for letting me do this.”
Mike sighed and shook his head. “Of course,” he said. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to forget. You know how it is.”
He quickly moved from his seat and ran down the stands. He hit the fence, growling as he couldn’t get closer to John. The match was stopped and the EMTs hurried to get John on a stretched and took him off the field.
He read over it a few times before the words started to make sense. The town would be there at the end of the week if no one was going to clear out the house.
Sherlock’s arms were around him again, loving and warm. It caused John to press into him, his head pressed against his chest.
Sherlock couldn’t help but to agree with that but he didn’t voice his thoughts. “Well, let’s get our food,” he said, motioning the waiter over and ordering the noodles and anything else that John wanted.
"Of course," John said sharply. He didn't like his father. He had used him to keep the house running for years and was never there for him when he needed help. So now he was just going to leave him behind.
“It’s….” John trailed off when he saw house. The car came to a stop and he quickly stepped out. “I have to go. Thanks for the ride Mr. Holmes. I’ll see you Monday.”
“Not really, he won’t be home until tomorrow,” John said. “He won’t be missing me too much.”
John looked up at him, shaking from the cold. “What are y-you doing here?” he asked, clenching his hands into fists.
“The night is not over yet,” Sherlock told him. He gave him a smile before looking out at the sky.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders and glanced at him. “I have no problem with it.”
The bell rang and Sherlock watched his students leave, some of them wiping drool from their chins. He shook his head, knowing they were going to fail their next test.
John mumbled something and shook his head. Sherlock chuckled, rolling his eyes. “Up you get Mr. Watson, don’t want to be late for class.”
“I know,” Sherlock told him as he knelt with him on the floor. “I’m going to try to get you a smaller punishment. You don’t deserve what they get.”
John was quick in getting to his room after the last bell rang. Sherlock wasn’t even done packing up when the teen came into the room. “Hello Mr. Watson,” he said, a small smirk on his lips. “I’ll be with you in just a moment. I have to get a few more things together.”
John went to Sherlock’s room to ready to start another day of painting. This time he had a change of clothes just in case something happened before practice. He got in enough trouble the night before for bringing in a mess.
John grinned. “I’m your favorite student?” he asked.
“I don’t want to go,” John whispered softly, clutching onto his shirt. “I don’t want to go.”
