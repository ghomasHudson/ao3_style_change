Tony glances up at him and gives him a questioning look. He flips past the page he’d stopped at, and the drawings take his breath away. It’s Tony, again, amongst other things, but he looks like him now, the way he does now, and yet…there’s nothing exactly different about it.
“Can I show you something?” Steve asks, and Tony finds himself nodding silently. Steve lets go of his hands and walks over to the workbench, grabbing the sketchbook.
He decides to hide it all; the feelings, the insecurities, all locked up and kept in a neat box hidden in the depths of his heart. There’s no use for those feelings, other than destroying his relationship with Steve.
So he makes a plan. He’s gonna fix this. He’s gonna fix himself, because Steve would never want him like this right? He’s gonna fix himself, and Steve won’t notice and won’t leave him, and everything will be okay. He’s a mechanic after all. Building and fixing stuff is what he does. He’s gonna fix himself, just like he did when he realized his father never loved him and never would, just like he did when i was in Afghanistan, and just like he will do to save their marriage.
“My sweet honeybee, how are you?” he says to Steve, who sighs deeply at the endearment and the obvious anxiety seeping into Tony’s words.
Steve hums in annoyance, and tightens his embrace around Tony. “Surely you can sneak away for a couple hours to cuddle with your husband, right?”
“Sorry,” Tony says, looking up. “I could’ve just saved us both a lot of trouble if I’d have looked further.”
Tony's sitting in his workbench, screens and schematics floating all around him as he types and talks at the same time, banking whatever seems to come to his mind about his work, a glint of happiness and mania in his eyes. He looks so good, and so in his element, that Steve can't help falling in love with him a little bit more.
That’s the thing. More that Tony beating the shit out of him after he found out about what he had done, what hurt Steve the most was watching the warm light that Tony had for him flicker and die, leaving nothing but an aching emptiness behind.
So he fears. That maybe he’s years too late and he’ll never get Tony’s forgiveness. That tony has gotten over him, has moved on, closing his heart off completely. He fears that Tony will watch him with nothing but ice in his brown eyes, with nothing but a monotone plans uninterested voice.
The first thing he notices is how Tony's lips are chapped, yet incredibly soft against his own. The  kiss is warm and slick, and very sloppy until Tony turns his head a bit, deepening the kiss, and Steve is sure this is the best kiss he's ever had. He can feel his heart growing inside his chest, beating so hard he's sure even Tony can hear it. Tony's touch is gentle and confident, a pressure he never knew would come to love in a matter of seconds.
Steve leaves the workshop shortly after, his laughter still echoing in Tony’s ears. There are some days when he wonders why Steve chose him. Out of everyone Steve could have had, he stayed with Tony. Even through endless fights and stress, he stays by Tony’s side. It only makes Tony all the more aware of how resilient that man is.
And without noticing, he suddenly finds himself walking through the holographic screens towards Tony and pressing their lips together. Just as Steve realizes what he's done on an impulse and goes to break the kiss, he can feel an arm circling his waist and the other hand comes to settle on the back of his head.
Steve has kissed, and has been kissed more times than he can count in his entire life. Yet he knows that he's so bad at reading situations - especially those that involve romantic feelings (there's a reason why he always avoided dating without Bucky’s help and guidance, not that we would ever admit that though) - and getting the timing right, that he doesn't even try to date anymore. Who would want a six feet tall, beefy man trying to awkwardly kiss them at the wrong time?

Tony raises his eyebrows and takes a long sip from the smoothie, trying not to grimace at the taste or, you know, do that thing that Steve says he does when he tastes something disgusting. “I’m peachy, darling. Nothing wrong here. You, on the other hand, look like someone kicked your puppy and you’re both sad and angry about it. What’s up? The trainees are giving you a hard time again?”
They're in the workshop when it happens, as they wait for the sun to set so they can go up and start making dinner - it’s Steve's turn, and over time, Tony developed a liking to watch him cook and make fun of him if he makes a mess of himself while doing so.
Steve opens his eyes to be greeted by the beautiful sight of his husband sleeping beside him. The blackouts are open, letting the soft morning light stream into their bedroom, drawing soft glints of silver and gold from tony’s hair and skin. His eyes are closed, his chest rising and falling in deep, sleepy breaths, the soft light of the arc reactor in his chest mixing with the sunlight in the room. He looks beautiful; waking up to the sight of him every morning is something Steve would never give up.
Steve raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him, crossing his arms over his broad chest, and says “Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”
He takes it, his eyes analyzing the drawing and something in Tony’s chest tightens. Well then, this is probably it. He will look up at Tony and see his face and will know what’s going on, and everything he’s tried in the last few days will be in vain. The thought alone makes him want to throw up the smoothie.
Tony knows that Steve is far more perceptive than most people give him credit for, and for the first time in his life he’s not sure he’s happy about it. He knows Tony almost too well, so it’s not surprise for Tony when he looks up from the blue prints he’s working on to take a drink from his awful and bitter green smoothie to find his husband standing in front of him with his eyebrows pinched and concern shining brightly in his eyes.
When they find the Benatar, something akin to relief settles at the bottom of Steve’s stomach, mixed with the usual dread of seeing Tony, of seeing the reflection of his pain in his warm brown eyes, again after two years.
And as he looks into Steve’s eyes, Tony realizes, for the first time, that he completely, full-heartedly believes him.
Tony shakes his head, rolling his eyes with fondness at his husband when he starts a trail of little kisses along his neck and jaw, igniting something warm and soft inside Tony, “I can’t, you big octopus. Gotta finish this blueprints for tomorrow. You know I have the presentation of the new StarkPhone in the evening, can’t miss that or Pep will hang me.”
He memorised everything in amenity; from the soft way Tony’s breaths came, to the small unconscious movements he’d make through the night. Steve remembers every single detail, always will, after being married to the love of his life for the past fifteen years.
Tony looks up at him, internally groaning, and braces himself for the ‘We Have To Talk’ conversation opener. This is it, Tony thinks, he’s knows, and he’s finally gotten tired of me. So he puts on his ‘Everything’s Peachy’ face and grins up at his husband.
He smiles back, dips his head, deepening the kiss. And Steve knows, deep in his heart as his chest flushes against Tony’s, feeling the soft hum of the reactor between them, that there’s no place he’d rather be.
He doesn’t look like that anymore, not since he retired from active duty. The lines on his abdomen softened considerably, and his previously lean body disappeared to give some chubbiness space here and there. Nothing dangerous for his health, mind you. He’s aware of his heart problems and doesn’t need more factors besides the one he already has adding up to his heart problems. But yeah, he doesn’t have the same body he had when he married Steve.
“And Tony,” Steve says, holding Tony like he’s the most precious thing in the world, “You’re always going to be perfect to me.”
Steve kisses him again, pressing his lips on Tony’s nose, his cheeks, his forehead, and smiles sweetly at him, “No, it’s okay. I’ll stay up with you. Would you want some coffee?”
He opens the book, not worried about asking for permission since Steve gave him a permanent one a long time ago. He shuffles through the pages, tracing delicate lines and figures with his fingers across the pages. He comes across one that makes his hand freeze and his heart plummet to his stomach. It’s nothing bad in particular, it’s a great nude sketch of him, and it’s also very recent by the looks of it. But the way his body is drawn…
“What gave it away?” Tony interrupts him abruptly, his question coming out harsh, and he grimaces. Yeah, he’s decidedly not good at this, and probably will never be.
Steve gives him a soft smile and moves so that Tony’s sitting in his lap. “Nah,” Steve says, “‘s okay. I love you.”
With that, Tony feels the last of his anxiety melt away. How could it not? The drawings make it obvious, the way Steve loves him.
He sighs and flexes his arms, willing the cramps away. He’s been sitting here for hours, and he really would give anything to go to bed with Steve. But that’ll have to wait.
A pair of arms surround him, wrapping him in a hug. Tony opens his eyes, not even aware that he had closed them, and when he looks up, he finds the worried look of his husband as he holds him in his arms, his tight and secure grip makes something in Tony ease and calm down a little.
Steve’s fascinated by the different facades of Tony’s eyes ever since, to the point that drawing his eyes soon became an artistic obsession - if he ignores that fact that drawing Tony in casual situations became as usual as drawing his warm, chocolate eyes.
. When he looks into Tony’s eyes, Steve is left breathless, nauseous. Big, ugly tears stream down his eyes in a non-stop river of emotions.
“Tony, we’ve been married for two years, and we’ve been dating even longer, I know you, and I know that there’s something going on-”

Later, while he cooks dinner for the team with Tony stealing little kisses and nips from him through the whole process, Steve is sure that for the first time since he ever kissed anyone in his life that he's stumbled upon the perfect kairos.
Tony would say he hates it, but it would be a lie, since the warm presence and pressure of his husband on his back eases some of his stress, and he absolutely loves his clingy husband. Besides, if it weren’t for this project, he probably would already have melted against Steve and let him carry him to bed for some lazy late night love making and a huge amount of cuddles afterwards. The simple thought of having the time for that without worrying anymore about an assemble alarm makes retiring definitely worth it.
Steve, in turn, looks as perfect and fit and muscular and beefy as always. The epitome of human beauty and perfection. And the stark difference makes something bitter coil at the bottom of his stomach.
He could spend an entire day admiring the breathtaking beauty of Tony Stark sleeping beside him, and he has, before, when they were younger and starting to explore their newfound relationship. Tony had spent days in the workshop after a mission gone wrong that ended up with some of their teammates gravely injured; he spent days looking for ways to avoid it happening ever again. Endless armor and gear updates, many motor oil milkshakes, and a ton of coffee cups later, Tony finally agreed to go to sleep between Steve’s arms. For eighteen hours straight, his soft snores like a lullaby that Steve never thought he’d like, Tony slept and Steve stayed awake beside him, mapping the folds and creases of his skin, the laugh lines at the corners of his eyes and lips, the scars scattered around his chest, the exact color of the arc reactor glowing light as it painted the darkness of their room in a soft blue light.
Tony's eyes are shining as brightly as his grin when they part, and Steve cups his face to kiss that grin with his very own. Somehow, Tony in his arms, and Tony’s lips on his, makes Steve feels lighter, makes him feel like coming home.
Boy was this going to be a long night when Steve and Peter got back. Oh well..at least he’d have a nice warm dinner ready for them when they did, and Luckily he had made Steve’s favorite. Chowder always brought the Alpha back into a happier mood.
“Wow...i cant believe it’s already been a year since you found him” Pepper smiled as Tony started to cut the cake. Steve excitedly staring at the slice that was given to him. “I know right!” Tony beamed as he handed the slice to Steve. “I remember that night very well, Steve was like a little sick but adorable kitten back then” Clint teased as he grabbed a plate for Natasha who mewled in gratitude. “Wow..i still cant imagine him so thin..i mean I’ve seen the pictures hang up on your wall with him still small..but just seeing him so big and healthy now..” Sharon mused with a smile as She grabbed two sets of plates  for her two hybrids. Tony beamed brighter at that. He was proud looking at Steve so healthy and happy now. The blond didn’t even flinch anymore when someone tried to touch him. Steve had become more confident and more friendlier to approach since Tony had first met him. Not only had the hybrid’s personality change but also his physical size had tripled dramatically ever since he’d been given food regularly with in between snacks everyday. Tony had made sure to give him all his vitamins and shots he had probably missed since they’d met. From a scrawny sick 5’4 in height to a well built healthy 6’4. It didn’t even seem so real how fast Steve had grown and changed within a year. Bruce had guessed that it wasn’t just the healthy meals and long walks that helped the hybrid get to his full development. It was the love, time and effort Tony had given him that had triggered his hormones to finally burst and start working properly.
Steve instantly redden when he had realized that he was staring for too long as the older demon started to snarl at him. “Nat...these Demons are incubus Demons!” Steve gasped as he turned to look at his friend with his mouth wide open. The redhead smirked at that as she merely tilted her head to the side. Clearly loving his expression. “you were saying?”
Tony nodded as he bit his lips. Hands gripping on strong shoulders as he felt Steve’s hard on grind against his. “Come on baby…you know all i want in return for everything is your ass on my dick…” Steve breathed as he bit on a collar bone. Making Tony gasp in surprise.
But tomorrow he’d finally be able to see Steve again. he couldn’t wait to wrap his arms around Steve’s thin frame again. He always loved how he could easily clutch and wrap around the omega whenever he felt nervous or anxious. Holding onto Steve always made him feel better. Sometimes he couldn’t believe his luck that a sassy and feisty omega like Steve could ever want to be with a short, squishy and insecure alpha like him. Really Steve could do so much better, but he was happy Steve stayed with him. Seeing Steve show off to the world that he was Tony’s omega was enough to send the alpha sky high with pride. The only thing he hated though was when other alpha’s were making fun of him and Steve as hot tempered as always would always get most of the beating as he’d always run to the alpha’s aid, giving the other alpha’s a quick punch and give a few good kicks before getting punch right back Which always made Tony feel like a complete worthless fool as he’d desperately try and shield his omega only to be thrown off and also get kicked. The omega would always try and tell him that it was okay even when the both of them needed to go to the nurses office. But Tony never really let it go. What good of an alpha was he if he couldn’t even protect himself and his omega. Especially when he’d see some alpha’s eyeing Steve.
Tony had immidiately made a face at the blond’s surprise offer. Cheeks tinting with a bit of red as he asked the billioner if he was sure about that? “Yeah im sure…my walls are soundproof so there’s no need to worry…” Steve said with a wink.
He’d sometimes take a few of his popcorn and offer it to the alpha. Fingers touching warm lips as he’d gently place them there. Tony didn’t think much of it as it was normal for omegas to have the need to service others.
“Tony…” Thor whispered as he sat on the edge of the bed, hand reaching out to caress the side of Tony’s face. “…you are such a wonderful Omega. Brave, beautiful…smart…What any of us would give to have you as our mate…but you have choosen Steve. And we, all of us here respect that. But…your alpha is not here right now..he is with another omega. An omega who you had approved of to share his first heat with.” Thor paused as he slowly leaned in closer to brush his lips against the other.
Tony hummed as Steve grunted his release. Making Tony drink every single drop of his seed till the very last one.
Tony swallowed a mouthful of beer as he tried to ignore the ache he was feeling somewhere in his chest. God he really shouldn’t be thinking this. It was Friday night for God’s sake! So he drank more of the beer that was on the table and laugh some more at his friends stupid jokes. But by the time he had started to wonder where Steve was again, the Blond had suddenly appeared.
After a few games and a few more chats the party had ended and everyone had finally went home. Tony had collapsed on the sofa as he felt absolutely tired now. Steve quick to jump on the tiny sofa and settle himself on top of Tony’s lower half. Purring happily as Tony’s hand traveled to his furry ear and played with it. “ did you enjoy the party Stevie? I hope you did” Tony said with a tired smile. Steve nodded his head as he closed his eyes to the brunettes smooth touch. Tony carefully grabbed the remote on the coffee table before clicking on it and a black and white movie had appeared. Steve nestled his head on Tonys waist as the two of them pleasantly watched the movie together. The man in the television was saying something about how he wanted nothing better to do than love the woman for the rest of his life. The woman beamed and kissed him breathlessly, Steve glanced at that at Tony who was now rubbing his eyes as he felt himself start to doze off a bit. “Lets say we hit the sack huh Steve?” Tony ask as he reached for the remote again to turn the T.V off. Yelping when he'd realized how close Steve’s face was all of a sudden. Tony raised an eyebrow as he felt the
He glanced down to look at his beautiful prince who had nuzzled even closer. He inhaled sharply as he promised himself he'd find a way..
“P-please…it’s alright…i really can handle this…t-thank you for everything but you can all lea-mmmnnn…” Tony couldn’t help but moaned when Loki had suddenly kissed him passionately. Heart racing fast as it felt so good when he felt the other’s tongue dance around his. When Loki had finally withdrawn from the heated liplock. Tony couldn’t help to whimper at the lost of contact, unconscioly following the smirking alpha’s retreating lips.
Tony redden even more when he realized where his hand was, heart thumping loudly as he tried not to tremble. Steve would be off to boot camp after this and he wouldn’t be able to see him till the start of school again.
How some nights he’d find Tony letting her into his chambers and not leaving till morning. He hated how she always seemed to catch the young Prince’s attention so easily. And right now she was doing just that, Getting every bit of the prince’s attention.
The bigger teen beside him was wearing a white form fitting tonk top, that showed off a bit of the blond’s abs. He had topped it with a denim jacket, paired with some denim pants and light blue sneaker. Sunglasses and cap not forgotten as he glanced down at Tony’s side with a smile. The blond immediately got a few unwanted attentions from the park as they past people by. Tony felt like shrinking beside the other teen as Steve must of probably looked like a super model, while he probably looked like Steve’s tiny chihuahua.
Tony and Steve’s eyes instantly widen when they had realized who had just made his presence known to them. The two feeling all too nervous at the thought that the man had been listening in on them in the dark.
I know it’s a bit short but i promise to update soon to make up for it..and hey i updated this a day after the last update so yey...Hope you enjoy
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing with my little brother Bucky?!” Steve snapped as he began to walk towards the two brunette’s, Grabbing the smaller one harshly as Bucky stood up with arms up high as he tried to back away from the angry blond. “Hey...hey..calm down Steve..” Bucky managed to say as every step he took backwards, Steve took another one towards him. “Steve...Steve..please don’t get mad at Bucky he was just trying to take care of me..” Tony began but was immediately cut off as Steve Snapped at that “BY FUCKING SHOVING HIS TONGUE IN YOUR MOUTH?!!” Steve suddenly screamed, rage taking over him as he turned to face the older brunette again. “ just chill out man...we just had a few drinks and stuff just happened..that’s all...” Bucky tried reassuring the blond as he smiled wearily at him, eyes darting over the smaller sibling nervously.
The brunette scowled as he rolled onto his back, not caring to glance at the closed bathroom door. Dark clouds already in his mind as he straighten his shirt again. Steve had emerged six minutes later with an apologetic look on his face as he went near the brunette who turned his back on him instantly. “listen Tony...i gotta go for a bit...I won’t be long, be home at nine I promise!” Steve said as he placed a kiss against Tony’s cheeks. The brunette didn’t steer as he simply stared outside the window from his bedroom wall. He didn’t mind to care as he heard Steve walking across the house a few times before going down the stairs and closing the door.
Because while Steve didn’t have the chance to accidentally feel his crotch anymore, he was absolutely feeling Steve’s massive one press behind him. It was his usual wake up call ever since Steve had started spooning him. To make things worst the hybrid would unconsciously hump him in his sleep, making Tony stiffen and bite his lips. There had been four incidences where Tony had actually came in his pants sweating and panting as Steve humped his massive hard dick against his bottom. His small noise and smell waking up the hybrid immediately giving him the chance to loosen the hybrids grip and scattering away into the bathroom.
“I asked where you were since you weren’t at your lab…JARVIS told me you were at your office so i thought i’d bring you some snacks to help you with your work..i know how preoccupied you get and lose track of time…” the omega trailed as he continued to stroke his fingers on the other’s shoulders. “Did you forget to eat again?” Steve asked with a sad tone this time. A tone that would usually make Alpha’s want to dominate them.
His hands curled into fist at the thought of that, shouting louder as he stomped across the woods. No, Tony was happy with him. The omega had made it clear to Steve that he was happy with him. No! Tony didn’t..wouldn’t leave him...
A honk from outside their house had startled him out of his thoughts as he went to glanced out the window. It was Bucky’s car, one of Steve’s friends. Brown eyes patiently waited for the blond to come out and glance up at him with his usual charming grin. Instead he had seen Steve getting up looking a bit flushed, Shirt a bit ruffled and balance unstable. His friend Peggy had tried helping him walk towards their house. Sam and Bucky whistling at them as they did. Tony immediately rushed downstairs to open the locked door for his brother. Hands shaking a bit as he reached for the doorknob. Once Steve was inside the house he wanted to give the blond a piece of his mind, coming home late and drunk in a school night. What was he thinking?
While the other’s were busy shouting and throwing popcorn on the giant screen. Watching a Grade B action movie that Clint had suggested, Steve was busy twriling Tony’s hair. Much to the alpha’s approval, as it always felt extremely soothing when “someone played with his hair”. As the alpha had put it.
Everyone cheered as the young teen blew off his candles from the giant six layered cake that was placed in the middle of the massive backyard of his brothers friend’s mansion. It had been a great party that Tony had surprised him with.
“Wow...there sure are a lot of people here..” Tony said as he pressed closer to Bucky who had his arms wrapped around him while looking around. “Yeah...these are senior party’s doll...get real wild sometimes..can’t blame Steve why he never brought you with us..” he smirked as he glanced down at Tony who grinned at him. He and Bucky had only met a few hours ago at a diner for dinner because Tony didn’t want to be alone when a few seniors had noticed them and invited them to join them in going to a party. Bucky had been hesitant as he wanted to bring Tony home early and safe, but the brunette had smiled at the opportunity to go to a senior party, since Steve never let him. And since the blond wasn’t going to be home till probably later than nine. He begged the older brunette to take him, it took a lot of persuasion till Bucky finally said yes.
“Uncle Fury...” Tony gasped as he tried to scramble away from the blond. that seemed to be a problem though as His legs were still wrapped around Steve’s waist.  who’s arms seemed to tighten even more around him. Tony didn’t know if Steve was either too shocked to actually let go of him, or too stubborn to care anymore.
A month had gone by and Tony had mostly gotten use to Steve’s new appearance. The blond had admitted he had been doing extra workouts and training while in boot camp, which his doctor said might of triggered his body to have a growths spurt. Plus his doctor had been giving him those weird vitamins that he said were good in boosting his height. Tony had been very considerate of it all as he listened to the omega explain. It had become clear to him that the omega actually wanted this to happen and he could understand. And he had to admit Steve was really hot. And he meant really, really hot. Not that he didn’t find Steve attractive before but now well..there really wasn’t any other way of saying it than Steve was absolutely Hot.
Once the car had arrived at their house Steve thanked the two teens inside as he ushered his brother inside their house. Making sure the door was lock before turning around to face the nervous teen. Tony tried to stand his ground but found himself backing away until his back had hit a wall as Steve began cornering him. With both hands landing on both sides of Tony’s head. You mind telling me what you just said back there again?” Steve asked as he leaned closer to the smaller teen. “ I..I don’t know what your so upset about! So what if me and Bucky kissed..it’s not like I haven’t kissed before...i just wanted to know how it felt like kissing someone who wasn’t you...” Tony managed to say as he felt himself tremble at his older brother’s heavy gaze. With Big strong arms trembling on both sides of his head, the brunette couldn’t help but think that Steve could easily crush him right now if he wanted to.
Swallowing the thick milk, Tony opened his mouth for the king to see his beautifully worn out mouth empty.
When the teasing had stop the whole gang had decided to take a hike in the woods before eventually settling to go for a cool swim on a nearby lake. The six teens had been doing this routine for the next five days, exchanging creepy ghost stories at night on an open fire as well. On the sixth day they had all went to the lake again and had a small picnic. Bruce taking pictures as Thor tried desperately to photobomb his shots. Nat and Clint had disappeared for a while before coming back with smug little smiles. Thor immediately smacking the beta on the back proudly.
Before Tony could snap out of his thoughts a huge object had hit him square in the face. Making his whole world spin as he fell on his back.
Right now though Steve’s main mission was to finish all this up before lunch time because he was already starving. It must past noon already. He groaned again as he bent down to get his axe, only to stop when he had noticed his omega’s scent.
The night went on as fun and carefree as it began. Tony snickered when he realized how drunk Steve had gotten when he saw the blond hitting on a brunette haired girl from across the bar. “He must think that’s Tony…” Nat teased, elbowing Bruce who chuckled besides Tony.
This was going to be alot longer...but for some reason this part kept telling me to be on it's own.  Hence another short chapter...i apologize..but! The rest of this is haftway through which will probably be posted within the week! Give or take two days tops! And I'll be sure to post it right away! I hope you guy's are still interested...i promise this next chapter will be longer and more Tony and Steve!
“Tony! Steve! You made it!” Clint greeted as he spilled some of his drink on his shirt. “Yeah…the appointment got cancelled since my dentist forgot his daughter’s soccer game was tomorrow..” Tony grinned as he slid next to Bruce, followed by Steve. “Sorry bout what happened with you and Brock.” Steve said with a worried face as he tried to pry Tony away from Bruce. “What? Come on, no serious damage…i’ll find my soulmate too someday…i mean, come on! We’re in our early 20’s here! We’re young and wild! We got plenty of time before then!”
“Your not seriously gonna just leave me here all alone are you? You know how i feel sleeping alone...” Bucky had said in a soft, embarrassed voice that made Tony bite his lower lip at almost forgetting Bucky hated being alone. He had grown up with a few siblings and so always didn’t feel comfortable when he was left alone on his own. In a way Tony could understand him as he decided to lay his head against the other’s chest as he settled himself comfortable on top of Bucky, Smiling as he felt really warm pressed against the other cozily.
Steve had his arm wrapped around his little brother’s shoulder when they had arrived at school, only sliding off it when Sam and Peggy had seen them and waved at him. Tony immediately frowned as he saw the blond eagerly going over to his two friends, instantly wrapping both his arms around Peggy’s waist who then gave him a peck on the cheek. The blond completely ignoring him again as he seemed much too busy again. Tony was about to turn around and head on and find his friends when an arm had suddenly snatched him, making him stumbled towards Bucky who raffled his hair a bit, telling him to have a good day before letting him go. Tony had pouted as he tried to fix his hair that had become a mess, before smiling as he watched Bucky wave and give him a charming grin as he joined Steve and the other’s, missing the way Steve had glanced back at the two of them with a frown.
King Howard had trusted Steve as an allay to the Stark kingdom as they concurred kingdom after kingdom together back then, he had never expected the Hydra to invade prince Tiberius’s kingdom and impale him and his parents with his sword when Howard had declined the Hydra for his son’s hand in marriage, thinking the blond king would understand. As the Starks and Stones had had the engagement arranged since they were infants. Apparently Steve didn’t take it that well and had decided to kill off the competition, sending the deceased prince’s head to the angered Stark king. Tony had trembled at the sight of his childhood companion who he use to compete with in games and studies. He had not expect Steve to do something so horrid as send a decapitated head as a declaration of his love for him. Two days after, the Hydra army had finally arrived surrounding The kingdom. Demanding for the Prince as the Starks had closed their gates at the unwelcome visitors, it had taken a day before Tony was shoved at the king’s feet bound gaged and beaten. It appeared Howard had blamed him of the whole incident, angry as his trusted allay had murdered his future son in-law, Tiberius the son he wanted to have instead of Tony. With his anger he had made his soldiers hang Tony up on a large wooden pole, letting the people in his kingdom think badly at the prince by telling them he was a curse to all of them. As he was the reason their beloved Queen’s death 19 years ago and now was the same reason for the innocent Prince Tiberuis decapitation. The people boo’d Tony and threw rotten fruits at him, spitting at him as he gaged on a dirtied clothe. Pepper crying on the side as she shouted at them to leave him alone as she tried to shield him from them.
and there in front of them Stood his brother Steve, blue eyes wild as his jaw clinched, body stiff and aura dark as he stared at them with intense rage.
Tears trailed down the smaller man's face as he tried to burry his face into the large chest that belonged to the one responsible for destroying his whole Kingdome. "They were so eager to dispose of you..to trade you...your own father doesn't deserve you...but don't worry my love..i wont ever let anyone treat you like that again.."Steve assured a shivering Tony and held him tight. "You will be my queen..i will take care of you...that i promise" he breath as he stroked the Prince's ruffled hair. Tony turned his head to face him. Dried blood covered his left cheek. "You are absolutely beautiful" he smiled and leaned down to kiss trembling lips, Tony inhaled as he felt Steve's lips on his. a small whine escaped him when he felt the Kings wet tongue play at his bottom lips, biting and licking him now. he shivered but slowly opened his mouth to allow Steve's tongue access. he moaned when the other didn't hesitate to explore his mouth. he received a tight squeeze in his ass and moaned louder. The kiss went on for a while before Steve pulled away, a trail of saliva connected to both their mouths. Steve smiled triumphantly as he held his new queen tight and held his free hand up to signal his men to finally return home.
“Steve how many times do i have to tell you? You can’t just start stripping Tony on the floor whenever you feel like it around the house” Joseph’s stern voice echoed around the room from the speaker placed on the walls. Steve immediately snapped his head up to look around the living room. “You installed cctv’s around the house?” Steve asked with furrowed brows while still hovering over Tony who was already panting, half undress beneath his scrawny body. “Yes! And for good reasons too...now, get off your alpha and stop being such an impatient omega! You’ll both have your time soon..right now i do NOT want you two going any further than kissing..why in my day...” Steve had already stood up as he tried to block his father’s yammering while trying to help his alpha off the floor. He really didn’t want to listen to his father’s preaches when he knew exactly how his mom (that’s also an omega) had seduced his father into mating with her at 17. No use in telling his old man that though..
I wasn’t sure if i was gonna continue this story but since ditasitepu35 asked so nicely here it is! i hope you like it 😊
Tony was startled when a finger had suddenly tapped him on the back as he was getting some books from his locker. Face looking absolutely confused before melting away into a small smile as he realized it was the large jock, rubbing his hand behind his head. “S-sorry...I didn’t mean to startle you...um...good morning!” Steve managed to say as he placed a kiss on the shorter teen’s lips. Tony instantly blushed as he hadn’t thought Steve would still be kissing him even at school.
The smaller sibling couldn’t help but wonder what was going on as he felt Steve’s strong arms wrap possessively around him, not giving him the chance to squeeze and break free from him. He could feel his heart beat rapidly as he felt Steve start to kiss the back of his head, a habit the blond tended to do when he felt like Tony was upset. A small blush had appeared on Tony’s face as he realized Peggy had glanced at them with a soft all too knowing smile on her face while stroking Daniel’s hair. “Is it okay if you tell us what happened?” Peggy asked as she darter her gaze at the two boys in the backseat. Tony wanted to squirm away as him and Steve had never been this close with someone else watching them before, but Steve wouldn’t budge as his grip on Tony’s waist and shoulder tighten. “Maybe some other time Peg..” Steve answered with a serious tone making the other nod and turn around.
Before he knew it he was carrying the unconscious omega inside his rented car. Wrapping his arms and legs with some clothes he had in the car. Tony would probably freak out when he woke up, Steve didn’t want to chance it that the omega might hysterically run out of a moving car. He’d seen the omega do that a couple of times already.
He hummed as he traced small circles on the back of Tony's neck, trapped inside the golden collar that he had placed on him. By the end of it all he knew Tony would bend down to him and be his Queen. Cursing his Church Bishop for reminding him of their tradition to never Wed someone who wouldn't bend down for them in front of the entire kingdom.
“Mom! Morgan’s putting her broccoli’s in my plate again!” Tony’s first born whined as he tried to put the vegetables back on his sister’s plate. Tony turned around to give his daughter a stern look “Honey...you know better than to not eat your veggies” Tony warned before turning back to finish his stirring. The tiny half breed brunette scratched her chubby cheeks a bit as she moaned how she already ate one. Harley Quickly pulling out his tongue to make a face at her.
A servant had knocked for her presence to be known by the two royals. Announcing that the ceremony was about begin. And that the King was waiting for them. The two said their thanks as they headed out to follow the servant girl.
But when he saw Tony crying outside their house where apparently the wedding was held. He couldn’t help but feel his inner alpha telling him to protect the crumbling omega. Tony was not happy with his alpha..the omega didn’t want this wedding as much ad he did. And when his eyes caught sight of his dog tag still hanging around the omega’s neck when he was already in his wedding suit. It was all it took to snap Steve out of rationality. In one minute he was walking towards his brother, saw Tony look at him with a surprised and confused look on his face as he blurted ‘your still here’, the next minute he had crashed their lips together in a passionate kiss. not caring anymore of what he was doing..thankfully Tony was kissing him back this time as Tony’s hands clung to him. He had never been so glad that he decided to come back. just to get a glimpse of his brother before he got wed to another.
“Tony, what have you been doing inside your room all afternoon?” Steve asked with a smirk as opened the door to Tony’s room, the brunette instantly jolted at that as he quickly hid his phone underneath his pillow which Steve eyed right away. “What’s that?” The blond asked as he started to walk towards the younger teen’s bed. “Ummm...nothing...just my phone really..” Tony admitted in a dull tone. “Well why are you hiding it?” Steve asked with a raise brow as his hand started to reach for the pillow that made Tony instantly grabbed his phone from under, “i’m not hiding it!” Tony exclaimed as he placed the phone against his chest. Steve almost growled at that as he stared at Tony with an almost pissed off expression. Tony mirrored him as he held the phone tight. “My phone! My room! Get out!” He snapped as he started to wiggled his knees and feet out of the bed when Steve had started to press his knees on it. Steve frowned at that as he stepped back with hands held high up in the air. “Okay...okay...I won’t push...just come down stairs and hang out with me for a few minutes, i feel like you’ve been spending way too much time inside here...” he pleaded with a soft voice. Tony felt a bit guilty at that since he really was trying to avoid Steve inside their house, but then he’d remembered how Steve had been avoiding him in school for the past few months and didn’t seem all that guilty with how he treated Tony.
“No...no...Steve please...this is Pepper..you remember her..please...” Tony begged as he started to ramble his face filled with panic. And there it was again..no formalities or what so ever.
Tony groaned as he stretched his tired arms over his head, as he sat at his office desk. It had been a long stressful week with all the missions and paperworks pepper had push onto him. Thankfully Steve had had his back through it all. It was nice having an omega around. Especially since that omega was a supersoldier that didn’t seem to get tired of attending to everyone at Stark’s tower.
It was already way past noon when the gates finally opened and the Blond King finally saw him, eyes widening in horror as he got off his horse and ran to catch the beaten Prince. “FUCKING TAKE HIM THEN! A THOUSAND LIVES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS!” Howard spat as he closed the Gates again. That would be the last thing Tony heard from his father.
This was probably going to be a very slow process but Tony couldn’t help but think how delighted he would be during it.
“Now…i don’t know about you, but…i feel like it is his turn to approve of one of us helping you out…” The Asgardian finally whispered before devouring warm soft lips completely. Tony could only moan in want as his head started to spin. God it felt so good.
and this really seemed to trouble Tony. Because Steve was catching more and more eyes from alpha’s now everyday. Not that the omega actually entertained any of them. In fact the omega had already managed to send a few alpha’s to the hospital after shamefully flirting with him while the two were out on a date. This one alpha had even lost most of his front teeth when he had cut in on Steve and Tony talking on the hallway at school. The omega not liking when the alpha had been blocking Tony from him. Steve had immediately punch him in the face when he had tried to put his hands on him like he had a right to. Tony could only stare with wide eyes as the alpha fell on the floor with his mouth and nose bleeding, scrambling away when Steve had told him to back off while trying to reach for Tony who unconsciously flinched.
“Oh my God! Steve! Let Tony sit on his own for God’s sake!” Rhodey groaned as he watched the blond omega glare at him from across the table. Tony tucked comfortably under his chin as they had their lunch inside the cafeteria. “No! The minute i let go of him someone else might try and mount on Tony again” the omega snarled as he held the flushed out alpha tighter. “I really don’t mind though...” Tony managed to say as he tried drinking some nice cool mango juice from Steve’s cup.
Tony was busy climbing up a tree in the gardens, trying to get one of the delicious apples the fruit bare as he was still not aloud outside the palace walls. He had wanted to see the king with the rest of the people, but he was hidden away inside the gardens as the king had requested before his departure. Tony had frowned at that but decided on obeying, least he wanted to see the man angry at him.
“HARLEY! stop teasing your sister...Morgan! Don’t kick your brother’s feet” he heard his wife scolding their two youngsters. Well...maybe it was better Peter was out and about.
Tony never batted an eye as he let the whispers pass him by until he reached the King’s throne. Blue eyes stared straight through him, intent on making him want to squirm. With his knees feeling weak he dropped to the floor with his head held high. Eyes never breaking away from Steve’s as he slowly began to bow his head. The entire kingdom went silent in anticipation as King Steve rose from his Thorn. He got up to stand in front of the kneeling prince, face hard to read as a rock. After a brief second of staring Tony lifted his hands to reach up and reveal the king’s enormous erection that had only been covered by the small material. Sucking in a breath Tony closed his eyes as he stuck out his tongue to try and lick the tip of the monstrous erection facing him
On the day of the wedding Tony felt absolutely horrible as he sat on the edge of a fountain outside their house. hands still clutching the dog tags Steve had left around his neck. This was all for the best. So why the hell did he feel so empty and awful? He glanced up to stare at the busy guest and families all rushing around the place. Killian talking to the hired priest and a few betas. Not once did he even glance at Tony the whole time he had arrived were there.
Accepting yet another local dish Tony moaned unconsciously as Steve hand fed him the piece of grilled meat that tasted of spices Tony wasn’t familiar with. “Do you like it?” Steve asked with a hint of fondness in his eyes, his smile brilliant and wide making him look youthful and charming, Tony swore his heart fluttered at the sight making him blush a bit. It was that face that had won him over two years ago when he had first met the man. The blush he wore seemed to get a positive reaction from the king as Steve leaned forward to catch his lips, taking away the princes breath as they both lingered on the kiss before breaking apart.
Since a lot of you wished for more of this story i am happy to announce im making this into a multi chap! This second chap will be short but next one will be longer i promise i just felt like a little character introduction should be in order for this one..
“Did he make you feel like that? Did you like his kiss more than mine?” Steve breathed against the brunette’s ear, earning him a small shiver. Tony couldn’t help but bite his lip as he clung to his brother’s shirt, hands quivering as he tried desperately to control himself. A single tear trailing down his cheeks as he didn’t know what he was feeling anymore. Steve instantly cursed at that as he leaned down to coop his brother’s face, thumb wiping the tear away as he stared with sadden eyes. “Fuck...Tony...I’m...I’m so sorry...i just...I didn’t...seeing you with someone else i just couldn’t...shit!” Steve cried as he felt his eyes begin to water at seeing his younger brother so upset.
Peter right away elbowed the older teen in the stomach. Making Wade wince in pain at the sudden action. “H-he’s just kidding…besides if we decided to stay, we’ll just hang out with the rest of our friends…” Peter chuckled nervously as he rolled his eyes. “Oh ugh…um, good..i hope you kids have fun…” Tony trailed as he tried to smile at the two. Cheeks still bright red. Steve on the other hand gave a short nod at that before clearing his throat.
So no, Clint wasn’t heartbroken. He was bitter and jealous. He wanted to have what Brock finally found. He hated it even more that Brock was the first one to leave their relationship. And now here he was singing “Good 4 you” by Olivia Rodgrigo. Boy did he ever feel stupid.
“Hey there birthday boy..” the an older teen greeted the brunette with a warm kiss agaisnt his ear. Peter chuckled as he tried to get away from his boyfriend. “Wade, not here…Tony might see…” Peter whispered as he unsuccessfully tried to get free. Eyes scanning the crowd in search for his brother. He instantly relaxed though when he finally found Tony sitting on a plastic chair, siping a martini as he chatted to one of his older friends by the pool. Steve was right beside him, with his massive arm slung comfortably around Tony’s slender body. Making his brother look tinier than usual.
“Once they’d arrived in the spacious kitchen Steve had settled down a chair with his younger brother on his lap. Nudging Tony a bit with his chin, making the younger teen whine a bit at the disturbance. “Come on Tony, we need to start eating now...school’s in half an hour..” Steve chuckled as he watched the brunette pout at him with his big adorable eyes. But obeyed when Steve held a butter covered toast near his mouth, letting him take a bite while before biting into the toast as well.
Peter quickly spun around and lectured the other teen about kissing him in public. Especially when his brother was around.
After the brief staring and cooing the blond eventually yet very hesitantly grabbed the muffin before scrambling away a few feet. Relaxing after a few bites of the delicious treat while Tony slowly came near again with reassuring rambling, Trying his best to convince the hybrid that he really meant well. The poor guy must of had a rough experience with humans for him to be so weary of his presence. But after a few given words the blond had already seemed to let Tony in his personal space. A small victory Tony thought as he kneeled in front of the now full blond.
Tony had blushed when Steve had leaned into him, wiping a smudge on his chin as he teased him that he looked like a little kid while eating. Ohhh...how the head cheerleader hated the sight. “What do think we should do about him Sharon?” one of the cheerleaders asked with narrowed eyes as she glanced at the blond cheerleader captain. “Ugh simple! We’ll just simple remind him were his place is...” Sharon said with an evil grin plastered on her pretty face.
“Well i guess they’ll have to suck it up! Cause me and Steve are a team!” Tony grinned adorably as he leaned against the bigger man. “That leaves another question for Steve here. How are you gonna have sex with your soulmate, if Tony’s right there next to you?” Bruce asked as he wiggled his brows. “ i could probably let him just watch from the corner..” Steve grinned before wincing when Tony had playfully punched his side. “Rude! Why don’t you invite me to join?!” Tony frowned as he tried to get away from the bulky blond who was now locking him in a death grip.
Tony immediately turned around at seeing his brother go near the other brunette. Not wanting to see anything else, he didn’t want to ruin his day this early in the morning. And so like what his older brother had been doing for the last couple of months since the start of the school year, he did his best not to glance at the blond whenever he’d notice Steve and Peggy walking together in the hallways. It was actually pretty easy since Bruce, Rhodney and Pepper were always there to distract him. Once school had ended and Tony was finally alone inside their house with Steve, the blond had immediately showed him how much he had missed him during the day. As if he wasn’t spending most of his time with his friends and Peggy, as if he didn’t notice Tony walking down the corridor just inches from him and still not noticing him. But Tony couldn’t seem to care at all as his older brother was busy giving him all his needed attention from the entire day.
You know what?? Screw it I've made you guy's wait too long for the second chapter so here it is now...the third one a day after posting the second one! Lol..enjoyyyy
Once she had left the two boys alone in the room again. Steve could only smile in embarrassement, unsure of what had just happened between them. “So…ugh yeah…lessons over for the day…ahem…i see you’ve improved on how to kiss…” Steve drooled. Tony beamed at the praise. “Well, i did learn from the best…” he chuckled before the two fell silent again. “So…um…wanna help out ma downstairs? Bet she’s waiting on us” Steve smiled, making the other nod as he went out to go downstairs. Steve following after but not before straighting his pants first.
Clint blinked a few times at that. “Well...seeing as Tony is in heat and would need some assistance during this painful time i am offering him my services...” Clint explained as he started to walk towards the flushed out brunette. “And who the hell said that it has to be you?” Sam asked with an annoyed look as he started walking towards Tony as well. The room was reeking of aroused omega and he had been controlling himself from jumping at the beautifully displayed brunette for the last hour.
Tony swallowed hard as his new Hydra husband started undressing him. Gently pulling apart his robe which he had worn earlier that day. Tonight was their first night as husband and wife, and although Steve had assured him that it was okay if they didn’t do it tonight. Tony was determined to do his duties as Steve’s chosen mate.
He couldn’t think further about it though when Tony had started to arch his back. Begging Steve to play with him some more as he presented his beautiful pink nipples to him. With a low groan Steve greedily sucked on the offered buds. Suckling each one as if his life depended on it. His dick hardening as he heard the tiny demon moan out his pleasure. With a grin Steve’s tongue twirled around the bruised tit as one of his hands started to go down on the demons ass. fingers quickly parting smooth ass cheeks, only to find that it was already slick. Fuck...Tony was so wet...Steve didn’t even have to prepare him anymore, well he was a sex demon. With a grunt the blond began to position his demon’s legs on top of his shoulders. His hands quickly freeing his throbbing erection as watched the small demon lick his lips at the sight. “You want this sweetheart?” Steve asked with a husky voice as he positioned his cock at the demons entrance, not really waiting for an answer as he began to enter his twitching dick inside the wet warm hole. Tony had shivered at the hot sensation, he hadn’t seemed to have a dick as big as Steve’s before. Since he was clearly a bit in pain, the blond really hoped Tony didn’t have that much sexual experience even for an incubus. Even though he knew he was being silly at the thought. but the mere image of someone as cute as Tony being taken advantage of by someone else was making Steve a bit angry. and come to think of it, Steve was sure the demons brother Bucky had probably had a go with him as well. The way the older demon had licked him shamelessly in front of them. Steve couldn’t help but wonder if the two had actually ever fed off each other. The image of Tony’s bigger brother penetrating him was enough to make Steve growl as he snapped his hips in a brutally harsh pace, making the incubus cry out in pure pleasure as Steve began to hit him right where he wanted.
Steve was fuming as he stood glaring at the two brunette’s who just a few seconds ago were making out right in front of him, unaware of his presence as they simply were too preoccupied to actually notice him open the door and stare wide eye at them. His whole body began to tremble as he just witnessed his little brother moan and press against his so called best friend.
Tony spread out on his office chair with half his shirt undone. While Steve was gently sliding his hands in and out of it. There was a flush on her boyfriends face while Steve grinned at her.
So much for him trying to show Steve that he could be his Alpha..that plan had went out the window when he had realized that Steve probably didn’t need an alpha, especially one like Tony. The thought had never made Tony feel more insecure in all his life as he’d stare at the beautiful omega and wonder if he was still good enough for him.
“Please Steve...she’s my best friend...she’s the only one lift of what i had now” he begged as tears started to leave his eyes. Steve snarled at that “ All the more better for me to finish her off! “ he said as he yanked her through the carpeted floor, Pepper Screaming in pain as he did. “You will have no one else but me Tony..no one!”
But Steve’s mom didn’t seem to care as she simply offered Tony a brownie before smiling brightly at him. “Make yourself at home darling..Stevie doesn’t usually bring new faces over here…why, you must be something special-“
Thank you for your question! Well actually they are perfectly capable of getting jobs and cooking and cleaning.. basically take care of themselves..but the thing is with them..even though they are cat hybrids they are generally very submissive and crave a humans touch and approval. Instinctively wanting to cater and be with their humans rather than live on their own..No one knows where the cat hybrids really came from but they’ve been with humans since the building of the pyramids, Seen next to Pharos in hieroglyphics. It was said that the Cat Hybrids were gifts from Gods to the humans who worshiped them everyday. For some reason the Gods thought humans needed companionship. And at the same time wanted them to feel how the God’s felt with mortal souls. Thus creating a species designed to love and obey their owners as humans do to Gods. The humans eventually made them into pets and cared for them as the Gods care for the humans who worship them.
“As a friend?...” Steve pressed which made Tony frown at his food. “Yes...of course..” he answered without glancing up. “Okay.” Was the only reply he got after that.
But not the one Tony really needed. Steve thought as he took a sip from his orange juice. No, Tony needed someone who had his back. Weather it was here in their personal life. Or at the battlefield. He needed someone who could cary him when he needed to be carried. He needed someone stronger and had more experiences with the world around them. He needed someone like…Steve.
This will be told in Thor and Loki's point of view for now..since a lot of my Stories haven't had the chance to have these two i wanted to give them a lil intro here
Ever since then Tony would always have this funny feeling whenever He’d steal glances at the senior in campus. Like right now when he was watching the brunette practicing on the field with his teammates, a couple of girls and cheerleaders all clapping and cheering on his best friend Steve as they played. Shouting out his name while completely ignoring the other players. Tony couldn’t help but blush as he’d start writing on his notepad as he sat by the bleachers. Scribbling away ‘Bucky4Tony’ or Mr.Tony Barnes. He even had little drawings of the senior below the writings. Gosh was he a Loser. But it was the only way he could really express himself. Especially since he didn’t really know anyone in Hydra heights. If only Pepper and Rhodey were here with him. But they were back in Shield academy along with Bruce, Thor and Clint. And he was here all alone with just his pins and notepad as companions. Well..at least he had Bucky to look at. If only the big scary blond would stop looking at him whenever he glanced their way. It was like Bucky’s best friend was a body guard alway ready to glare at anyone who was looking at them. Well at least someone actually knew of his existence. Bucky might as well of forgotten him by now. A small whine escaped his lips at that.
The next day everyone ignored how the queen was limping as he walked around the castle with a pie in his hands. They all knew the reason for Tony’s awkward walk as the king had made it very clear last night how much he had missed him. Tony winced a bit as he stopped to sigh. He had had one of the cooks bake him a pie to give the servant who had saved him from the fall yesterday. But for some reason he had not been able to see him all day.
the typical Alpha’s physical form started to show when they had turned 12 and yet Tony was still short and soft a year later. The boy had a very shy personality as well, often speaking in a very shy voice that no alpha should. Although Howard couldn’t blame him. If he was an Alpha lacking all physical traits he’d be embarrassed too. The problem was Tony would turn 18 someday and he’d  have to start presenting to an omega. And omega’s were usually the one’s to chose the alpha’s they liked. The only problem was even when Tony had first presented as an Alpha at the age of 10 he was afraid to talk to omega’s. Too shy and nervous to even say a simple hi at them. When Tony had turned 12 and showed no signs of change, Howard had made it his mission to find a strong and willing omega to be his son’s future mate. What a father wouldn’t do for his own son really.
Take in note this is pure fiction! So please dont get offended or angry at anyone. And this is just me having a different take on the whole Steve finds bucky and forgets about Tony angst. Here Tony isn’t going to be all sad and insecure when Steve’s away with Buck.
Tony just closed the door and before he realized it, was moving both his feet as he crossed the road.
To say that Steve was pissed was an understatement. The hybrid’s ears wear dangerously low as he hissed venomously while pulling the brunette close to him. Tony sight as he tried to get free from the hybrids possessive grip while smiling assuringly at Thor who was also hissing and standing his ground. It wasn’t uncommon for hybrids to get upset when a new one was suddenly introduced to the family. Even if in Thor’s case just for a little while. He really needed to explain to Steve that the other hybrid wont be with them forever as he promised to search for his owner that was probably looking frantically for him right now.
Steve could only blink at what he had heard the other hybrid say to him. “D-did you say Cla-claim him? Your ma-master?” Steve stuttered with wide eyes at the information. Thor nodded with a bright and proud smile. “Yes! It has been four weeks since i have claimed him...” Steve could only stare at him with amazement as he finally relaxed in front of the other hybrid. So Thor didn’t want to take Tony away from him..he had another..his master..who he had already claimed. With a sudden curiosity Steve smiled and asked Thor how he had done it and if he could teach him to claim his master as well. The other blond hybrid laughed loudly as he patted Steve a bit harshly on the back, nodding as he told Steve his and his master’s Story as they headed back inside. The bitterness of that morning forgotten as they rejoined the other hybrids who were now busy playing video games, Happy to see Steve smiling again.
The two never had the chance to continue where they had left off after that. But what happened on that lake was enough to put a wide smile on Steve’s face. Because now Tony wasn’t being shy with him anymore. Now that he was going away Tony had become more and more brave in showing Steve how much he loved him. When the day came that Steve had to leave for boot camp Tony had pouted as he clung to Steve’s side, making the omega chuckle as he promised Tony that he be back. And once he had gotten back he was sure to continue where they had left off.
The younger sibling had been so worried that his brother had been doing something iligal that he wouldn’t stop asking where the 23 year old had gotten all of the money from. Only to find out that Steve had been helping them from the goodness of his own heart. “I’ve got money to burn, so there’s no need to worry on repaying me. Your safety and Tony’s friendship is enough for me…” the handsome business man had said when he couldn’t understand why he was doing all this.
The omega waived goodbye as he stepped inside the elevator. Smile as innocent as an omega can give before disappearing through metal doors.
“Steve it will only be for one day...now come on, you guys always have fun here..” Tony said soothingly as Steve clung to him. Big strong arms not letting go of the brunette. Tony tried to hide his smile as he really needed to go now, Clint and the rest of the gang were already waiting outside with Rhodey’s car honking at him for the third time.
"How long until we get there again?" His beloved companion asked as he turned his head around to face him. Thor smiled at the beautiful man setting next to him. "Not long Loki my love...this evening perhaps, we shall arrive there..and the king will surely have a feast for us after our arrival"
“TONY! Please answer me...” Steve whispered with a trembling voice. heart aching at the thought of losing Tony.
Steve frowned at what his friends said as he sat quietly at the far side of the table. It was true..Thor was worth a lot of money compared to him..heck he didn’t think was worth anything. He had grown up alone in the streets when his mother’s owner had left him in a box in an alleyway. Thinking he was the runt of the litter because he was so small and weak. His mother’s owner didn’t have much food to go around for them and had eventually decided that he didn’t really need to feed one more mouth when it looked like Steve wasn’t going to make it. He had told Steve’s mother that he would give The small kit a home, but he never did. Instead he had placed Steve inside a big box and left him there. Left him to fend for himself and survive on his own until he had met Tony.
But before he could successfully pull it all the way down a loud crash outside their bedroom door had startled the brunette awake , brown eyes filled with panic as he scurried out of bed. Steve covering his erection and willing it away as he jumped off behind him. Curious as to what had caused the loud noise this early in the morning.
And Tony was weak, he was too weak to even try and resist his brother. Because deep down in his heart he knew he really wanted this. No matter how wrong it was. He wanted Steve just as bad as Steve wanted him. With trembling hands he clung on to the blond even more as he leaned into the kiss with his tip toes. Loving every bit of it as he finally was able to welcome the blond’s words into his heart. Because for some unknown reason, kissing Steve never felt so right. It was nothing at all like kissing Bucky, his heart didn’t beat as fast as it did now..his mind didn’t fog up at the sweet sensations he was feeling at the moment, and his body didn’t melt at the mere touches of Steve’s hands. And before he knew it Steve had already picked him up by the waist, making him yelp a bit as he tried to straddle his legs around the bigger teens waist. A moan escaping his lips again when Steve had started to kiss and suck at his neck.
Blushing widely Tony obeyed as he stuck up his ass a bit, shivering as two strong arms started spreading his cheeks wide apart. Gasping when he felt a oil coated finger start to press inside of him. “Ahh..Steve..” Tony moaned as he tried closing his eyes but opened them wide again when Steve had ordered him to look at him. “Look at me when i take you Tony...my love..” The king breathed as he captured soft lips, kissing Tony intensely as he thrusted his finger in and out of the brunette before adding a second one. Loki and Thor not far behind as Thor had began scissoring Loki’s ass. Stretching him wide before inserting a third one making the dark haired prince squirm and moan with delight. Cock rubbing deliciously against his abs as he continued to finger fuck him. Both getting started a bit as Tony let out a loud moan as he impaled himself onto Steve’s enormous dick. “Fuck...that’s it my sweet..ride me..” Steve groaned as he watched intently how Tony rode him. Water splashing around them as Tony moaned wantonly, mind clouded with lust as Steve started to play with his neglected erection while sucking harshly on his shoulder. Completely forgetting that there were two other royals beside them watching with lust filled eyes as they too started playing with each other.
Tony must have passed out after that. Everything gets dark, and by the time he’s awakened by Nebula, he realizes that he’s seeing a familiar sight out of the window.
In that aspect, she’s the complete opposite of her brother-in-law, who has started stress-eating after the birth of the twins.
Hilde shrugs, pointing upwards. “Probably still up there, if he’s still alive.” She sighs once more, dropping her hand. “Asgard has lost the entire royal family in such a short time span next to their home. I need to make sure that they’re alright.”
“The universe lies within your grasp,” Annoying guy continues, averting his eyes from Thanos, as do the others. The four accomplices look in fascination as Thanos places whatever was inside that cube onto the golden gauntlet he’s wielding on his left hand.
“Hang on, son!” Tony shouts without realizing it. He would fly off, but it seems like Big doesn’t give him much of a chance to do so. When the jerk actually throws some electrifying device onto him, making him unable to move, he figures that he’s pretty much toast right here.
“Yeah, no. Dr. Zol- No, I haven’t seen a soul.” He also hasn’t seen the chair he accidentally walks up against. “Pardon me.”
“I want two sides, one side over here and one over there,” the one Thor threw on the ground starts saying, pointing at the two different locations he mentions. “Divide yourself equally. Co-operate, and things will be more pleasant for everybody.”
Yaël glares ahead once again, squeezing her own arms that are wrapped around her knees. Her lips are pressed into a thin line.
Once it’s time, Natasha smiles with excitement. “See you in a minute,” she jokes towards the four who aren’t coming along with them. Nobody can respond, as they’re all shrunk until they reach the Quantum Realm.
“I know it seems like a selfish act, but I can assure you that it’s not. You must take Yaël away from here as quickly as you can.”
Oh, that’s the guy he and Peter fought back in New York five years ago. Right. Tony shoots a couple of blasts his way, but it doesn’t seem like he’s moving fast enough.
Well, you know, temporary, that is. IF NATASHA, LOKI AND GAMORA GET TO LIVE IN THIS VERSE, SO DOES TONY!
Shit, Tony feels his eyes sting upon hearing Steve’s voice. He reaches for his chest, but the metal suit is in the way for him to reach his scar.
,” he hisses at them, and Hilde can’t help but let her mouth fall open. Her first reaction would be to push him back, but they clearly have more important matters to think about.
The dot is shining even more brightly than before. It’s expanding, further and further, the readings getting completely confused about what’s happening.
Hilde sighs again, already tired of this. But she figures the best way to get back to her people is by doing what this man asks of her, so she starts speaking.
There’s no particular reason for them to want a moment to themselves. Tony just told them he needed some air, and his former team – his first team, that is – just decided to come with him and… what, spend some time together?
Being it in the head by the Hulk must have made his brain work a little slower, but eventually it comes up to him. Tony’s eyes widen as the answer presents itself inside his head thanks to Scott’s continuous ranting.
But they know life would have been much better with Peter here. Steve just misses him, hanging around in the tower. Sometimes he would just drop down on the couch whenever Steve’s watching TV, and he would rest his head onto Steve’s lap while he’d keep on reading on his tablet. He had been so much like Tony, that of course Steve became so protective of him in only a matter of time.
It’s by far not the only picture of Peter. There are plenty of them around here. Lately, Tony has been having the habit of looking away from them, out of fear to be pulled back into his grief.
She’s relieved, though, when she finds a hatch on top of her. Carefully, she opens it, looking through the small lift and finding an empty room. This whole ship is weird, she thinks as she jumps out.
“You’re going to die for that!” Thor promises Thanos, voice broken, hurt, words hard. Hilde only notices the tear when it rolls off her cheek onto the ground. Meanwhile, the annoying one of the five gestures towards Thor, and some metal flies up to his mouth to prevent him from talking further. Then he leans down, taking the Cube from the ground.
It’s getting loose. They’re almost there. Peter tries to give it all he’s got, tries not to get too distracted.
As Natasha speaks, the faces of known enhanced people appear on the screen. Sam Wilson, Sharon Carter, Scott Lang, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes… it goes on and on. But when he sees Peter’s face in front of him, he lowers his gaze and shields his eyes away. Steve notices immediately and puts his hand onto Tony’s shoulder.
She feels her face getting colder the longer she’s out here. Any other race aside from Asgardians would freeze up out here, immediately. But Loki is not Asgardian; he’s a Frost Giant, so the freezing wouldn’t bother him, either. It’s the breathing that Hilde’s worried about.
Yaël shrugs. “I mostly lost my balance whenever I was using Earth, but other than that my body never suffered from it, I suppose.” She grabs a hold of her cup of coffee and starts blowing on it before her eyes widen and she jumps back up. “Oh, I’m a horrible host! Do you want something to drink?”
Howard frowns only slightly, but then he gives him a friendly smile and holds out his hand for Tony to shake. “Well, I’m Howard Stark.”
. We lost. And you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the Avengers, not the Prevengers.”
“Aren’t you coming with us?” Korg then asks, pulling out his weapon and opening it with a dramatic move. It’s painfully obvious how Miek is missing next to him.
She sits herself down onto Thanos’ shoulders with her hands wrapped around his head. Her face scrunches up immediately after that. Thanos shouts, and Mantis grunts in pain or discomfort. Her antennas start glowing, and she’s struggling to stay put.
That does not sound good. Especially when she turns to her brother, who is standing next to Steve and looks like he has no idea what she’s on about, either.
She finds Vision where Steve told her they were. Steve is making work on getting any kind of weapons from the large body with the spear through its chest. Rather than focusing on them, she hurries to Vision who seems to be grunting in pain. The wound in his chest looks even larger than it did before. She holds out her hand towards it, wishing now more than ever that she had healing abilities, instead.
Yaël lets out a strange sound once she notices who it is. Dr. Cho doesn’t let her approach. She instructs Hilde to tear open his upper clothes, which she does without effort. She then listens to his heart, checks his standard parameters. Meanwhile, Hilde looks around for something that will warm him up a bit.
“You know what I need? I need my son back. Because this,” Tony lifts up his arm and starts pulling out his IV before Rhodey can stop him, “this is good and all, but there’s no use for me still being there if my son isn’t.”
“And to see a friend,” he admits. He’s worried about her, but she’s never going to accept it. She’s already freaked out once when learning about Morgan, who is technically her granddaughter. That whole situation is weird and Steve doesn’t want to think too much about it.
“What’s going on?” asks Helen. With her standing closest to Loki, she suddenly gets the child thrust towards her. Except, in the middle of that action, Loki literally disappears into dust and the child almost falls down on the ground. Everybody jumps into action, then. Luckily, Helen is quick enough to catch the Heir.
And it’s true that the gravity here isn’t as strong as back on Earth, as is proven when the girl – Mantis, Tony remembers – starts jumping up and down on a spot that must have a particular low gravity. Tony catches Peter observing her, clearly in a bind on whether or not to join her. He’s probably hesitant because he’s supposedly an Avenger now, and Avengers don’t mess around. Much.
Thanks to Tony’s earpiece, Peter can follow everything. That’s how he knows that his next destination should be somewhere to his right, where he last saw the Black Panther running away from something.
“So, how are you liking space so far?” Hilde asks Dr. Cho in an attempt to shield off the other conversation behind them.
Half of her hair come loose out of her ponytail. It’s falling in front of her face, shielding her sight from the large man that is now approaching her without a problem.
“So, how long is he staying this time?” Pepper suddenly asks. Tony clears his throat, pulling his mind out of the train of thought. She’s probably right, after all. It’s too soon. Way too soon.
He should be boycotting them on their attempt to keep him alive, but at this point he’s too tired to even do that.
“At least now we both know not to use a stupid knife to kill Thanos,” the God of Mischief mutters quietly. Gamora frowns, though if she remembers Thor’s telling of what happened on that ship, Loki must have attempted to kill the purple giant.
There are only one or two people they come across. They get a few curious looks due to the fact that it looks like a girl of twenty is walking around with a man in his forties. They don’t care; they both know better than that, after all.
There are people crying, children in tears upon looking at their slaughtered families. Hilde even notices a few people she came to befriend during their travels. Her eyes start tearing up, but she doesn’t let it stop her.
“Insect!” he hears above him. This is probably not the right time to tell him that Spiders aren’t insects.
Thanos moves quickly. He exits the ship, leaving Gamora to her own devices in here. Out from the windowshield, she can see him get to the ship, force open the door and enter. Gamora hurries after him. She grabs her knife – the only weapon she holds on her – and grabs a helmet to make the same jump.
But they’re not fast enough. Thanos rips the web out of his face and kicks Strange down. The entire scene is filled with action, and Peter can’t focus on everybody at once. One moment, Strange’s red cape is covered around Thanos’ gloved hand and prevents him from making a fist.
Crap, crap, crap. “Howard,” is the first thing he blurts out. He’s close to slapping his own forehead, but he stops himself.
She says her goodbye, pats Raido on the head once and heads out. In her mind, she wonders what Thor is doing all the way back with the Avengers. One part of her wonders if she should have gone and help them, but on the other hand… no, her mission is here. There’s four little people that she needs to protect. And the current Queen of Asgard. No, she couldn’t have left, even if she wanted to.
Gathering around on the large platform of the machine, they all give each other a long look. Nobody seems to be wanting to talk, but that’s alright. After all, it’s often
It’s the pegasus that does it. Hilde looks majestic on it, but after everything Tony’s seen in his life, he thinks he finally draws the line at a horse with wings.
Thor, now dressed in armor and with his hair pulled up. His long, formerly-messy beard has now been braided together. He looks very much the Norse God the stories depict him as.
“Mr. Lord... Star-Lord is fine.” Quill gestures for the others to join, which they eventually do. Tony continues with making up a plan, trying to get that whole thing from just now out of his head.
“Okay, so, how do we do this? Do we ask the stone, gently?” Clint kneels down next to Natasha and looks over the unconscious body in front of them. “I bet you fifty that won’t work.”
Except, what he didn’t calculate into that was the Hulk, who had been going down the stairs until now and breaks through the door in his anger for taking such a long time over it. Tony feels himself being thrown aside, as the suit case leaves his hand.
“I hope they remember you,” he says. Peter doesn’t know what sound he lets out. He holds on to Tony, tries to keep him up. Blood is drooling out of Tony’s mouth, and his breathing isn’t going smoothly at all.
offering him to get some air? Together? Who is this man and how has he ever become the Howard Stark Tony knew?
It’s so… Tony thinks he should feel annoyed, but all he can do is grin. After all, the dude stopped a giant spaceship the height of Stark Tower. Instead of saying anything at all, Tony starts walking towards the blue light that origins from the ship. Two characters appear on the street, as if they’ve been transported down by it. There’s a tall, ugly one, and then a skinny ugly one. Yeah, they’re both ugly.
Natasha gives him a long look while Steve moves forward to sit down on another, empty chair. It’s the only empty one – the others are filled with even more maps.
“Uh, guys, was Nebula with us?” Natasha suddenly remarks upon noticing the one figure missing in the group. She puts her batons away and starts looking around for the blue meanie. Tony doesn’t stop her.
He’s been forgetting to eat and drink, until Nebula – that’s the woman’s name, by the way – forced a tasteless meal into his mouth and made him swallow it whole.
“What is this guy’s problem, Mr. Stark?” Peter asks from where he’s standing up, all the way back at the fountain. Well, at least he remembers now that ‘Dad’ is not acceptable while dressed as Spider-Man.
The eerie silence around them remains. The wind is restless, as if it’s trying to warn them about a shift, somewhere. Wanda can feel it in her powers; in the part inside of her that must have been created by the stone they tried to take out of Vision.
Luckily, there’s still Bruce. “Okay, guys, can we quick cable this discussion right now? The fact is that we have the stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.”
Tony frowns, wondering what happened with the soul stone. Why did they not go after that? Tony does not recall FRIDAY telling him that the Compound was being attacked. Did they not sense it, then?
“You’re unbelievable, Steve Rogers,” she gets out. Then she stands up, holding out her hand. “You better not step on my toes.”
“Drax I swear, stop calling us morons or I’m going to shoot this at your head,” Quill warns him, holding up his blaster. The man called Drax now looks horrified, putting his hand against his neck.
When he finally feels the gauntlet slipping off, Peter feels a moment of glee. “It’s coming! It’s coming! It’s coming!”
Natasha can very well remember the first time she did this. The entire battle with the Chitauri had been one thing, but the super-powered being constantly throwing fire and large chunks of rocks her had constantly been putting a damper on her work, and both her and Clint had been getting annoyed at the time.
Facing Mantis and Peter once more, he decides to ignore the fact that the girl is still jumping upside down. Meanwhile, Peter looks impatient to hear what Tony’s come up with. As Tony approaches him, Quill drops his device and follows him as well, clearly listening to what Tony has to say.
Nobody’s talking, everybody silent to hear every part Tony has to say. Every bit of the message he felt the need to record with his helmet. The part that FRIDAY warned them was waiting for them to listen to. And all Peter can do is look at his father there; the man who, turns out, has had to live five years without him, five years thinking that he’s dead and won’t ever see him again. And Peter aches all over again, to think of the pain Tony must have felt. It must have been a massive hit on Tony’s already weak mental mind.
This particular picture is of many years ago; back when Tony only barely knew he had been Peter’s Dad. They had gone to Disneyland together, and took a picture with the Mouse after May’s insistence. Peter’s wearing the typical ear-hat and he has a massive grin on his face – despite his obvious exhaustion. He had a few difficult days back then, and Tony thought the trip would distract him.
Peter knows there are no anxiety meds or antidepressants in space. Normally, he should be fine for at least a couple of days before he’ll start feeling like something’s wrong again, but this current situation is not helping at all.
“Brother?” Thor asks in confusion. When he notices Hilde walking there he looks at her with a questioning gaze. She just shrugs, indicating that he doesn’t have any clue, either. Loki has never really been a character that’s easy to read; too unpredictable, too hellbent on stabbing you in the back to protect his own skin. It’s a form of self-preservation that Hilde has to admire one way or another.
In an instant, a big, powerful blast throws her away from where she’s standing. The last thing she remembers seeing is yellow, glowing lines cracking through Vision’s skin, and after that, the stone must have broken.
“You must do it, Wanda. Please. We are out of time.” Wanda feels her lower lip tremble as Vision pulls up her hand and puts it against his cheek. When she feels his skin underneath her fingers, she finally stops interrupting him for a moment. Her eyes never look away from his as he speaks to her.
They watch some documentary about underwater cities when Yaël starts nodding off again. Hilde is barely aware of it, too enthralled by the old architecture shown in the reel to really notice the girl next to her.
“In Laymen’s terms, it means you’re not coming home.” It’s a way to make it easier on the ears. Not that they’re going to like it.
“Alright, fanboy, quit dreaming and let’s get out of this thing.” He nods towards the exit, or entrance, or just the random hole that has been created as they broke the ship by hitting something else. Peter nods quickly, sprinting outside before Tony can even stop him.
he hears Peter force out. A small feeling of glee passes him by when another thing flies right by him, though at the same time he’s feeling only horror when he sees Peter losing his grip on the ship, falling down to crash against it. Right at the point where Tony’s about to scream out for him, the Iron Spider reaches Peter and surrounds itself around Tony’s son. Tony finds himself letting out a breath of relief, especially when he can hear Peter gasp for breath once more in his ears.
“I’m sorry, I’m not,” Steve admits eventually. He looks away from the open space he’d been staring into and turns towards his friend. The others are preparing Vision into Shuri’s upper lab, so Steve should probably join them.
She starts running, plunging the Dragonfang inside a couple of the guards’ throats before storming inside the hangar. That’s where she finds nothing but destruction in front of her.
Drax now seems confused. “I stopped listening after you said ‘we need a plan’.” He admits, though obviously not feeling any guilt for that.
There’s a bit of sparring. She had forgotten how good Yaël had been at it back then, so she takes more than a few surprising punches and Clint seems none the better about it.
There’s another touch to his shoulder. Tony startles, turning around and distancing himself from who-ever was touching him even more.
They’re relocated to a place somewhere in ‘Norway’. An old city that has been abandoned due to too small a population. They rebuild it, and name it New Asgard to honor their home. And it’s far from their Kingdom – the Midgardians even call it a ‘City’ rather than a Kingdom – but it’s a start.
“What is it saying?” she asks. The words leave her mouth much easier than they used to. She’ll probably never lose her accent, but the fact that she no longer has any trouble to form sentences is something she’s rather pleased with.
Hilde thinks about the mission she's given herself after the discovery of the unborn Asgardian heir.
And that’s where they are after five years. Or, well, that’s the highlights. Steve could talk about Natasha, but she’s been burying herself in work, never letting go of the hope that she can bring the others back. And then there’s Bruce, who has been experimenting more with the Hulk after the few hiccups they’ve been having together during the battle of Wakanda. To put it shortly, at this point he’s Hulk, but with the brain of Banner. It’s complicated, but Bruce seems to be happy this way.
Yaël nods as she sits down next to her. “That’s good,” she returns. “They might be able to bring him back, as well.”
“Maybe in another life,” he returns. When he pulls away he looks back at Sam one last time. Then he clears his throat and nods. “Right, let’s get going.”
Thanos notices them approaching him. He’s not even flinching. No, instead he starts monologuing. Again. Why do villains always do that?
“They would want us to leave!” she returns. “Keeping you away from that creep is more important than saving the King.” She can’t believe what she’s saying; once upon a time, guarding and protecting the royal family was her only mission. Now her only priority is making sure that the Asgardians arrive on Earth safely, though without a King. It bites.
She hates herself for this. With the orange beacon blinking brightly on the map, she knows that she’s bringing the universe closer and closer to impending doom.
No, he can’t think about it. It’s no use; they’re going to die in space, anyway. Soon enough, he’ll be back with him.
Steve takes a shivering breath next to Peter. He reaches out his hand for the man to take, which Steve does. He gives him a sad smile, and Peter can see the tears in his eyes. The ones he’s trying to hold back.
Tony startles when he hears somebody run up to him. He nearly crumbles together, yet when a pair of strong arms wrap themselves around his shoulders, Tony sinks into the familiar touch. Nebula lets go of him, realizing that she’s no longer needed.
Man, Peter would never wish to stand on the opposite side of any of them. While he’s not fought Natasha before, he’s been trained hand-to-hand combat by her back when she still thought he was ordinary. He’s never seen Okoye in action before, but he’s heard many stories about her and her other warriors. Shuri, he has yet to meet, but he already knows that he will like her very much. She might be a great potential friend.
Tony sighs. Rather than heading to the garage, he goes to his study. He doesn’t have a work bench in there, but there’s a table that’s connected to FRIDAY that he can use. Through the windows, he looks over at Steve and Morgan, who seem to be watching some of her favorite TV-shows.
While Morgan is not Peter, she is a completely different person and their child. Or, well, it’s complicated. They’ve all agreed to this, obviously, and it’s going to be hard to explain at school that the girl has one mother and three fathers. Tony, at first, didn’t want anything to do with the baby. That changed as soon as she was born. He fell in love with her on first sight, and even Steve felt an immediate fatherly love towards the girl. So they’ve come to the agreement that Morgan stays with them one week, and then she goes back to Pepper and Happy.
Steve finally turns around, now noticing the yellow glowing circle slowly getting larger. Having never seen one before, he looks at it with a frown. Especially when three people come walking out, each and one of them looking angry as Hell.
Tony nods, crossing his arms while he stares Strange down. “And due to that fact, we are now in a flying doughnut, billions of miles from Earth with no back-up.”
“Because we have each other, and that’s all Tony ever wanted for us,” she says. “His mission was to get you back. To keep us safe. And he died knowing that he’d succeeded. That’s the best thing we could wish for him in this situation.”
Loki barely looks back at her. His gaze varies from the unconscious girl to the infant child in his arms. The baby coos, once, but has at least stopped crying.
“Hah, yeah we do.” Tony gives him a short glare as Natasha an Clint both get out of the car. Tony quickly follows after them.
Hilde turns the figure even further. Blue skin is the first thing she sees, followed by long, black hair and a familiar uniform.
Tony feels a tear roll of his cheeks. He can’t help it, it’s stronger than him. All he wanted was Peter back on Earth, safely away from these monsters who were leaving the planet. If Tony disappears, it’s not that big of a deal; Peter has May, he has Steve, he has all of the Avengers.
“New haircut?” asks Steve with a smirk At this point, he’s even less surprised that a person he thought dead is in fact still alive.
That is until she mentions the name ‘Gamora’. Isn’t that the person who the rest of the Guardians were looking for?
His words are quickly cut off by a grunt. Steve tries to look around and find the Android, but there’s nothing to be seen.
Peter finds his family seated in the living room. There’s Steve on the couch talking to May, the both of them obviously filled with grief. There’s a space between them, obviously meant for Peter. Behind them there’s Rhodey who is talking to Happy. The latter his holding his five-year-old
Ten minutes later, an escape pod leaves the Avengers Compound and ascends into the air. One figure is standing outside, and watching them leave. Hilde knows well enough who that is.
“You alright?” he asks the man, though still out of breath. “That was close. I owe you one.” He pats Strange’s arm twice before looking around to search for Peter, who is nowhere on the ground. When suddenly the kid appears from up the ceiling, hanging upside down, Tony realizes he must have jumped up into the air to stop his fall.
“I’m going to allow that,” Tony mutters out. “If Thanos needs al six, why don’t we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?”
Wait. She reaches for her wrapped-up belly, finding the wound dressed and bandaged. She actually survived? How is this possible? She glances over at the white-dressed woman, who is now hovering over the familiar dark-haired woman.
“I need to what now?” the girl asks in return, pulling her hand back without any trouble. She then rubs her wrist, frowning down at the God of Mischief as he throws his own arms up in the air in annoyance.
years since he sent an army to New York, and now he’s back!” Tony takes a shaky breath, feeling his entire body tense up even more than it already was. Is he actually almost screaming in Strange’s face? “And I don’t know what to do, so I’m not sure if it’s a better plan to fight him on our own turf or his, but you saw what they did. What they can do.”
“Who just saved your magical ass?” he asks before pointing back at Peter, who clearly looks like he wants nothing to do with this. “He did.”
Johnny winks at him and then flies off again. It’s probably time to get back out there. They can continue this reunion after it’s over. Especially when he hears Clint trying to reach Steve throughout the battlefield. His voice clear in his earpiece, Tony tries to pinpoint where it comes from.
Thor grins. “Notice you’ve copied my beard.” Thor gestures to his chin and Steve shrugs when he touches his own facial hair.
Through his eyelids, Tony feels light approaching them. With the last of his strength, he re-opens his eyes. Nebula must have walked away and he never even noticed. In confusion, he blinks. For so long, all there was ever to see in space was darkness and constellations far away. Yet, this is stronger, like a sun approaching them.
Thanos’ gauntlet looks scorched, the power of it having created large burn marks onto the Titan’s arm.
“No, I’m his son, remember? I came in when Bruce fell through your roof?” Peter tries. Strange just looks at him, studying for a minute before understanding dawns on him.
Then, all he’s holding in his arms is air. The last of Peter’s dust flies up into the air, getting further and further away from Peter. Tony falls forward with a cry. His hands are dirty; they’ve been through Peter’s hair, and now they’re dirty. With dust.
In the past twenty-so days, Nebula must have come to care about him, as she’s lingering her hand onto his shoulder when he’s taking what must be his last few breaths.
Tony hates running. It makes him all sweaty, sticky, and reminds him of just how unfit he is due to the lack of training in the past few weeks. Okay, no, months.
They work well like this together. Thinking out loud, they often manage to finish each other’s thought patterns, and thus helping each other to figure things out even quicker. After scanning the bunker Steve’s looking at, Tony follows the heat-signatures and finds that they’re going down an elevator. Steve knows this place well, it seems.
Jane is doing just fine, probably with the help of Korg and Miek. They’re really dedicated in helping the woman raising her children in Thor’s absence, but Hilde quickly realizes that they’re probably a lost case as well as the father is.
“You know damn well I do,” he hisses towards the sorcerer. Strange doesn’t flinch at all upon that reaction. Then Tony clears his throat. “What I meant was, with the accords being the way they are, I need permission to exit the states with the Quinjet and-“
Clint nods. “Asked me if I was going for the new model of an Avenger suit. He wasn’t a fan of the colors.”
And that’s true; he hasn’t seen the Hulk since Ultron, which is a long-ass time ago. Since Bruce came back on Earth, he hasn’t had any incidents, which Tony thought had mostly to do with the guy being better adjusted after spending some time on a nerve-wrecking planet.
“Because… I thought this was a good opportunity,” Tony admits. When he sees their questioning looks he explains further: “To retire. For real this time, like I mentioned a few days ago.”
Bucky squeezes his shoulder and then nods. The smile he gives looks genuine, like he actually believes his words. Steve should believe them, too.
“How did you do it?” Clint wonders the moment they’ve packed it up in its reserved container. Natasha grins at him widely. She’s been doing that so much more, lately.
It had been Hilde’s idea to return back to New Asgard. She’s aware that Yaël likes being around her friends in New York, but at least here she can keep a better eye on her. The people also like the idea that she’s closer to them now.
She pushes herself off the wall and heads to her own assigned bedroom. She doesn’t own much, but enough for at least two weeks. The bag she carries is large enough for it, but she grabs a separate bag and fills it with rations and foods. There are ready-made bags in there as well for cases almost like these, so Hilde grabs two of those bags as well.
They order some takeout, seeing that this isn’t working. It takes a little bit, but eventually everybody’s gathered together at the long table, snacking on their own bits of Chinese food. Except for the Hulk, who is eating his own brand of ice cream.
“Hello, Aunt Hilde,” greets Raido. Despite her often telling him that she’s not his aunt, he’s always ignored her and kept on calling her that. Yaël is not too far behind him. She puts a hand on her son’s shoulder and even bends down to pick him up.
“Bruce!” Tony calls out for his friend. Noticing that the others are on their way to help him up, Tony tells them not to move him. He then uses his suit’s healing spray. It doesn’t do magic work, but it mostly helps holding back infections and is quite the effective pain killer. Tony knows; it’s what he used back on Titan after being stabbed by Thanos.
Thor is stuck in place, looking incredibly guilt-ridden while staring at his hands. As if they’ve personally betrayed him.
“Pete, focus,” Tony tells him quietly. Peter nods and returns his attention to the task at hand. He stops listening to what the blue-skinned woman behind Quill says. “Okay, Quill, you got to cool it right now. You understand?”
While the order’s attention is directed at Loki, who is still standing there – untouched – Hilde grabs the arms of a few of the remaining Asgardians.
“Loki?” Thor asks, a bit louder than earlier. His voice is strong, low, easy to hear. The fact that there’s no answer means that Loki’s not listening at him. Slowly, Hilde accompanies the new King of Asgard through the dark hallway. Most of the people are asleep, though it’s possible a lot of them are awake, still. It’s hard to keep a track on days when you’re up in the dark of Space. There’s no sun, no day nor night. There’s just… space.
Steve doesn’t look down at the worn-out suit he’d been wearing. There hadn’t been much else on the quinjet to work with, after all.
“NO!” she shouts at nobody specifically. She’s too late, there’s no way for her to stop this. Even as she tries, she’s thrown aside by a massive blow to the head that hurts more than she could imagine. She can barely even look up. All she sees is Thanos, pulling Vision off the ground and reaching for his forehead. Vision makes struggling noises, but he won’t be able to get himself out of that hold.
He taps Peter’s shoulder as if he’s making him into a knight before he starts walking to the side. He loves Peter, very dearly, but he needs to make at least a little bit of distance before he starts to re-form the whole plan once again.
When she knocks on the door of her destination, a small child comes to greet her with large, brown eyes. Looking down at him, she immediately recognizes Prince Raido, who looks so much like his father, except for his darker skin and dark eyes. He’s not as much a trickster, as he has the ability to shift his shape in any way he wants. He even sometimes surprised them when he woke up and turned out to have changed as a girl. In those moment, the child would be happiest when put in dresses and having his long hair braided up nicely.
It stays quiet for a little bit, but eventually Pepper gets up, holding on to Morgan’s hand as she takes the helmet, gently kisses the top of it and then hands it to Steve. The super soldier looks like he’s on the verge of breaking apart when he takes it from her.
Then there’s just colors, lights. Much like the first time he did this. It’s once again strange, but by now he’s come to expect it. And so he starts with his task of returning the stone, beginning with the scepter, followed by the Time-Stone. The Soul-stone is a bit harder since it means he has to put it back into Yaël’s unconscious body, but for some reason the stone seems to know exactly what to do as it gets absorbed right back. Good.
Tony doesn’t hesitate further, he flies up in the air, seeing that the spaceship is already high in the sky.
“Did you lead him to us?” the dark-skinned woman asks. She stands up, though she still looks a bit shaky on her feet. Gamora doesn’t look away. At this point it’s the only thing she can do; holding her gaze. It’s the only strength she can show.
By the time he got to Peggy’s funeral, it’s safe to say that he’s grown tired of funerals. He would rather go to a wedding or something, or a baby shower, even. Can’t somebody just get married, for crying out loud? Can’t somebody simply just have a baby?
But after a while it gets too much for him. Nebula’s innocence hits him at his core and he has to distance himself; get some alone-time.
“Unlike everyone else in your life, I don’t work for you,” Strange says lowly. Peter’s about to open his mouth there, but Strange silences him. “You used to work for him, too, your argument is invalid.”
“Your brother he… he’s not with us. He’s somewhere we can’t reach,” Tony admits. “But Aunt Nat, and your Daddy Steve, they’re trying to bring him back to us.”
“I don’t wanna hear another single pop culture reference out of you for the rest of the trip, you understand?”
“Oh, right. So, Jane, my beautiful wife, she, uh, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time, and then the Aether stuck itself inside her. And she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I’m from. And we had to try and fix her, and since we were dating I had to introduce her to my Mother, who’s… dead.”
Wanda immediately stands in front of Vision, who is unable to move away from where he’s seated. She feels her eyes sting, but this is not the time for tears. With the wind getting even stronger, she’s feeling extremely glad about putting her hair together. To have that messing up her sight would have been a nightmare.
“Good. Just as long as we are all in agreement.” Immediately after that, thunder comes up in the sky as Thor’s eyes start glowing blue. He holds out his hands, waiting for Stormbreaker and Mjölnir to come to him from where-ever they are. Neither Steve nor Tony flinch as the lighting reaches Thor, right next to him, though Tony does feel his hair raise up a bit from standing so close to him.
They don’t even make it to the first stop. Hilde is only walking through the hallway, passing Thor’s chambers, when suddenly Loki comes scrambling out of the room, face pale and eyes open wide.
It’s like the thing is glued on there. They try to pull, so hard, but despite being subdued by Mantis he keeps on fighting against it. His hand tries to curl up to prevent it from slipping loose. But he hasn’t met Peter and Tony. They don’t give up. They can’t.
They stop talking once Bruce activates the machine and Clint disappears in front of them. Only a couple of seconds later, he returns, looking bewildered and surprised. He’s on his knees, only held back by Natasha who is standing next to him.
Tony blinks in confusion. He feels like crap. Seriously. His entire body aches. Is this what old age feels like?
Thanos walks behind Gamora. “You’re strong, me,” he starts. “You’re generous, me. But I never taught you how to lie. That’s why you’re so
She’s just about to make a turn back to the ship when something hits her and swings her out of balance. She gets out a muttered curse, but she can’t hear it.
Right there in the middle of the open door was Travel weary and jet lagged Steve, smiling brightly at him with his ever adorable puppy dog eyes. Before Tony could even think clearly of what he was doing he had lunged himself right away at the open armed alpha. Happily Nuzzling his nose against the blond’s wide chest. Sniffing Steve’s familiar scent as he nuzzled closer. Loving the feel of big strong arms wrapping around him again. “Oh my gosh...you came! You came! I thought you wouldn’t come!” Tony said with a shaky voice as he lifted his head up to stare at his dear brother. Steve chuckled as he placed a hand over Tony’s cheek. “I’d always come for you Tony..” Tony flushed a bit at those words as Steve stared so intensely at him. “oh Steven! You finally came!” Sarah shouted as he wrapped her arms over the both of them. Kissing Steve a dozen times on his face before letting go. The blond Alpha smiled widely at his mother as he leaned over to kiss her as well, arms never letting go of Tony as he did before glancing at Howard with a friendly smile. The friendly smile disappeared though when he spotted the other alpha in the room. Said alpha didn’t seem too happy to see him either as they both shared a staring contest at each other for a few seconds. “Ahem...Steve...this is Killian...Tony’s fiancés...Killian this is Steve..Tony’s brother” Howard said with a stern Alpha voice as he knew Alpha’s could get very possessive when their omega’s were in the arms of another Alpha. Even if Steve was Tony’s brother. The unfriendly look Killian had on his face instantly disappeared at hearing Howard’s voice. Stretching his hand he walked over to where the Alpha was with his omega still in his arms. A small vain could be seen on top of his head as he tried to speak politely. “Pleasure to meet you Steve”
Tony only remembering them when Steve had gripped his face and made him turn to look at Loki who was also forced by Thor to turn towards him. The two moaning lustfully as strong arms griped them both on their sides, thrusting up inside them with so much force that the two cried out in unison. The two blushed fiercely as they stared with lust filled eyes at each other. both moaned with their tongues stuck out as their lovers ordered them to give them a bit of a show. Tony redden even more when Loki had leaned close to him, tongue hanging out. Teasing him a bit as it played with the tip of his own tongue. “God! Loki, you certainly know how to make a man want you more..” Thor breathed as he bucked his hips up more. Making the dark haired lover moan as he twirled his tongue around the brunette’s, giving the two blond’s a show they’d never forget. Steve groan with desire in his eyes as he watched his bride’s tongue dart out and play with another’s. Fuck Tony could be so slutty when Steve wanted him to be.
Tony couldn’t help but feel a little underdress next to Steve as they walked through the park side by side, as they held each other’s hands. When Steve had told him that they would be having their date at the park, he had immediately thought of wearing a plain black shirt paired with some above the knee blue shorts that had some floral touch to them. Finished off with a pair of slippers and a nice brown hat that covered his face from the sun. After all it was a really hot day outside. He had started to regret his decision as he thought that he should of worn something a little more..he didn’t know, layered? Flashy? Something that actually made him look like he actually put a little more effort into how he looked like Steve did.
Steve, was finally in that position right now as he watched with a nervous heart at the beautiful human he had chosen to claim, sit in front of him with two of the village elders behind him. Steve’s  six tentacles twirled nervously as he tried to hunch down as to not seem so intimidating to the small human. Tony, was his name. The hydra creature had taken a liking to him three years ago when he had seen Tony visiting and mending an owls broken wing near the dark forest. Not caring of the dangers lurking near him, as long as he was able to see and care for the injured bird that Steve would sometimes tend to as well. At times Steve would hear the small human mutter a thank you, even if Steve was sure the human didn’t see him. It was a condition that the protectors were not to show themselves to the villagers whenever they went out to scavenge or hunt. That they would remain hidden in the shadows until their duration was done and needed to take their prize. So it wasn’t a surprise when Steve would hear the small human say a thank you, like he knew Steve was there. It made the hydra’s heart flutter inside his chest. No one had ever thanked him like Tony did. Sometimes he’d find the human even going out of the village late at night to check on the bird. Which pissed Steve off at times since anything could happen if he hadn’t noticed the brunette wander off. And yet he’d had this warm feeling whenever he’d watch the small human curl up and talk with the owl. As if he knew he was safe, like he knew Steve was there near him. Even if he didn’t see him. Steve knew that Tony had faith in him. And wasn’t scared of him at all..
“Umm...what are you writing?” Tony couldn’t help but asked as he leaned forward a bit to get a good look at what Steve was writing. The blond instantly jolted at that as he held the notebook tight against his chest. “Ugh...notes...” he blurted with a light blush before realizing what he looked like and acted all calm again. Tony wrinkled his nose at that which made Steve wanna smile goofily at him. “Notes of what?” He asked as he tilted his head to the side, curious of what Steve is really planning. “Um...the things you like..” Steve embarrassingly admitted as he placed the notebook back on the table. “Oh....well, why do you need to write down what i like?” Tony pressed as he tried to take the notebook only for Steve to grab at it and stuff it in his bag again. “Well...if I’m going to be teaching you lessons like dates...i should at least know what you like...it would only be right...this would be also good for Bucky when you two finally have a real date...” Steve answered quickly as he glanced around the place, not really looking at Tony who was staring at him with awe. “Wow...your so considerate, thank you Steve..” if Steve were an anime character right now he would of had a nosebleed from how cute the brunette had said that to him. “Yeah...it’s nothing really, i just need to ask you a couple of important questions and all you have to do is answer them alright?” Steve managed to say with a straight face as he stared seriously at Tony who nodded with a serious face as well. God Steve wanted to pinch his cheeks. The blond coughed a bit before he asked his third question. “So...what’s your favorite color?”
The small blond halted his hissing, only growling in warning a bit as he tried to hide behind Tony, Natasha smiled in response before mewling and blinking her eyes slowly a few times. Steve, the tiny blond stopped his growling at that. Staring intently at her for a whole minute before blinking slowly himself. Tail and ears seeming to relax as he realize they weren't probably dangerous. Clint smiled as he pulled Natasha back a bit. Tony smiling on the other side of the hall as he finally found his keys. "So.... where'd you find him?" The blond questioned, curious where Tony had found the scrawny thing. "outside... um.. yeah..a few blocks from here...he scared me to death when i found him rummaging through some trashcans..he looked scared himself and hungry..tried to scratch me a few times before i gave him a muffin I'd just bought.." Tony said with a grin as the tiny blond nudged his nose against his coat. "He looks pretty worn out..." Clint said as he absentmindedly stroke Natasha's hair.
Peter smiled at that before hearing Ned call him from the pool. “HEY BIRTHDAY BOY! COME ON! WE’RE GONNA PLAY SPIN THE BOTTLE! I THINK SOME OF THE GIRLS HERE WANNA GIVE YOU A BIG KISS!” the other people started to cheer and laugh as Peter chuckled at them. But not missing the way Wade was looking at him fondly. “Come on…your birthday’s not over yet…” Wade said with a grin as he wiggled his brows at him. Peter couldn’t help but take the older teen’s hand and tangle it with his as they walked towards the geoup of people waiting for them.
“Alright then! So...thanks a lot for all your hard work guys..Thor, Sam, Loki...” Clint trailed as he looked pointedly at the three men. “I think it’s time you gave me and Tony a little privacy...” he quickly said as he gestured with his hands for them to leave, making Sam raise a brow as he stared in disbelief. “Hold up, hold up...what do you mean give you two privacy?”
Clint was already sucking him off while the others started to play with his body. Sam greedily lapping at one of his nipples. While Thor had somehow guided his shakey hands towards his rock hard cock. His brain melting away at every touch and kiss his teammates gave him. Tongues and fingers fighting off the heat driven pain all across his body. And when Loki had carefully thrusted inside of him. Making him see stars. That was when he knew that there was no turning back. They were all going to have him.
“S-Steve…T-Tony…” Pepper’s shocked voice broke the alpha’s tranced state. Head snappig back up as he realized that his giflfriend had arrived. Pepper could only blink a few times as she stared at the scene before her.
“So what are we celebrating about?” Bruce yelled across the table through the booming music around them alongside Clint’s voice. “We’re not celebrating anything…”Nat yelled back as she finished her beer. Which made Bruce furrow his brows as he watched how happy everyone had looked when he arrived. Clint being especially drunk as he laughed when he missed a beat.
“I can’t believe you can’t even trust Tony to leave him in his dorm while he’s in his rut” Peggy said with a frown as she stared at them. Sharon nodding next to her. Steve huffed at that while Tony made a small whine. “It’s not that I don’t trust Tony...i know he’d never be unfaithful to me...it’s everyone else i don’t trust, even Alpha’s here are after him” “For fucks sakes!!! I swear I wasn’t trying to get in Tony’s pants! I-i was only trying to help him get undress!” Bucky snapped bright red, making the two Carter cousins stare at him with wide eyes. Rhodey just sigh as he took a bite off his sandwich. Where was Pepper and Happy when he needed them.
“Hi! I’m Steve! Are you Tony? My dad has told me all about you!” the blond boy asked as he held the blushing brunette tight. Tony could only nod as he tried and failed to open his mouth at the very touchy omega. The grin on Steve’s face widen as he glanced back at his father. “His really cute..I really like him...” he said before turning back around to smile widely at Tony who blushed even more at his bluntness. “I...ah...thank you...” was all he could say before he yelped in surprise when Steve had started running into the garden, pulling him along as he waved at his father who was laughing with the older Rogers.
Peter was busy saying his thanks to the blond as well, not really noticing how Steve was looking hungerly at his brother. Wade had waited for an appropriate moment to interupted them. Feeling a little out of place at the moment. “Ugh yeah…so Pete, i should be heading out now since it’s getting late…you know curfew and all…” he lied as he tried to step a few feet away from Peter when he realized that his hand had been reaching out to Peter’s again. Peter in return frowned at the action and unconciously got nearer to him. Which Tony noticed right away.
