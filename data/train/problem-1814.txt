It’s just a box of Christmas decorations and Sherlock just slumps further into the couch. He pretends to be sleeping but watches John from the corner of his eye. He begins to evaluate the data he has collected over the past couple of hours.
They said their goodbyes and John said “I’m miss you” softly, barely loud enough for Sherlock to hear and hung up.
She tells him she will report her findings and the military will ring him in the morning with all of his results but while he’s here he might as well go to the uniform area.
When they land in Istanbul the Lieutenant Colonel briefs them again on what exactly will happen when they finally land in Syria. Since it’s an active war zone they will be handed packs and weapons immediately and the duffle bags will be put into the cargo truck. They will be placed in one of the trucks or jeeps and will have to be on the lookout for incoming enemies and land mines.
“Can you give me a few hours to think it over, it's not that I don't want to help it's just that I have something to lose now if I don't come back” he smiles sadly at Sherlock, who is still immersed in his experiments.
John thinks he would like that but looks down to his bath water, the bubbles have dissipated and decides that he doesn’t particularly want to frighten his flatmate.
The kettle whistles to signal that the water has boiled. That snaps Sherlock out of his daze. He turns the kettle off and retreats to his own room.
“John you’ve been gone for ten months and you havn’t had any leave to see your family. I don’t want to but I’m sure if I spoke to Mycroft he could call a few people. He’s friends with a Major or someone else of importance I’m sure.”
John figures the old uniform from 8 years ago probably won’t fit and aren’t regulation anymore. So John goes and finds he doesn’t need to go up a size which is surprising considering he and Sherlock rarely eat anything other than take out and also not surprising with the amount of running around he does before eating said take out.
They calm down and Sherlock tries to get the syrup off with his tongue, which nearly sets John off laughing again, so he resorts to a napkin.
John cleared his throat and spoke. “Sorry Mrs Hudson, I had a few beers while we were out and I dropped the keys. Sorry if we woke you.” Sherlock was glad John replied as he didn’t think he could speak at the moment, he was still getting his breathe back.
“Greg.” He says taking a sip of beer and looks over to him. “Me and Sherlock just aren’t going to happen. He doesn’t feel anything for me, he’s actually asexual apparently. We spoke about it this morning.”
“You’ve been listening to the Yard’s gossip mill while I’ve been gone? God you must have been so bored.”
He walked into the kitchen and turned the kettle on and made himself tea. He returned to the living room and sat in his chair.
“Precisely John. Like art. My predicament however, is not at all like that. I do certainly appreciate its beauty.”
When he returned he pulled the covers up and around them and lay on his back. Sherlock turned onto his side and scooted closer to John. Resting him head on his chest.
That was better, Johns’ beautifully toned chest right there in front of him to touch and taste as he wanted.
They leave the car and Sherlock spots Sally immediately and John makes his way over to her, Sherlock hesitant to follow.
Not long after, Sherlock emerges and decides Molly and Simon are the safest choice not to be harassed. At least they can talk about dead bodies, something interesting.
“It’s approximately three hours and forty five minutes to the Istanbul base to reload and refuel and then we’ll be heading into Aleppo to land and will be joining a convoy that is returning to the Hamra base. It’s only reachable via the all terrain vehicles and is covered by the enemy forces to the south that hair antiaircraft guns and do not permit aircrafts. I will brief you when we land in Istanbul but for now we have a short journey ahead of us and try to use this time to get some rest because we will not be stoping until we reach the Hamra base”
“The Lieutenant Colonel will be the head of the squad you will be placed in and because of your minor celebrity status the squad will be at least eight soldiers and you will have two Lieutenant’s whose job will be to guard and protect you at all times. While we assign these to you, you will still have another Captain assigned to your squad as well as another lower ranking officer and we will be placing the two new Privates with you as well.”
John relents and rings up the Thai place who barely has to take his name, address or order because they know John and Sherlock’s order so well. They say it will take 30 minutes but always arrives in less than 20 because they are well looked after buy the owner which Sherlock also helped, quite recently actually.
The door bell rings as they both go to get up. Sherlock goes to the window to see who it is but all he see’s is one of Mycroft’s black cars. Its not the same one they used earlier.
Finally Sherlock has something to occupy his time with, however tedious and unfortunately misses a call from John later that afternoon.
She is naturally curious and inquires as to the package when the delivery men leave and so John sits her down with a cuppa and tells her where he’s going. She weeps and blubbers loud enough it wakes Sherlock, who sort of stumbles into the room and is still a bit disoriented having only slept 5-6 hours after a long case and the sight of Sherlock makes her cry louder.
“Yes I am John that will just help me think how best to compare the residue (science talk that John doesn’t understand) to the tobacco ash”
Sherlock is a bit shocked. He supposed John is ‘not gay’ so it shouldn’t be a surprise. But he was very good last night so Sherlock had assumed. Well, that’s something about sex Sherlock could teach John. He didn’t think that was possible.
John kept talking but Sherlock was just taking in Johns face like he hadn’t seen it in years, making sure it was commited to memory.
Sherlock appears to be the closest to the kettle and just sighs walking into the kitchen muttering, “Yes John.”
Leaning towards her, speaking low and using his best intimidating voice he says, “Sally, if I ever hear anything like that about Sherlock come out of your mouth again I’ll make sure there’s a third body in that room and don’t think I’m not being truthful, just ask Lestrade about the mysterious shooter from Sherlock and my first case. Or how about you just check my military records of the multiple fatalities I inflicted whilst I was in Afghanistan, don’t think I was just a doctor. Is that clear?”
The twins where there and so was LC Knight. They all greeted him like an old friend. He decided that spending the next two months with these people he considered friends wasn’t all that bad and before he knew it he would be on his way back to Sherlock. Everyone, once Smith had extracted it from him, was excited to hear they were FINALLY together. The more he talked about Sherlock the more he missed him. He’d be on his way back to him soon. Back to London. Back to 221B. Back to home.
John speeds his thrust up and they start to become erratic. He’s about to come. Sherlock grasps onto him and whispers into his ear.
On his way he notices about ten people unloading one of the supplies trucks that came with them in the convoy the previous night.
Suddenly it’s all go and John runs to the trucks pulling up and seeing the many wounded men, jumps into Doctor Watson mode.
“Yeh I know, Sherlock tends to exaggerate things about his brother. He’s helped me out a lot over there and with my leave as well. He’s actually a good guy, but it’s quite sad really.”
He grins up at Sherlock. Sherlock’s breath hitches as he realises how close John is standing. They just stare at each other until Sherlock feels a phantom of pressure on the chain pulling him down towards John. Sherlock knows what to do this time and begins to lean down, eyes flickering to Johns lips and back to his eyes as he’s drawn in.
Sherlock turns back to Greg who has apparently flicked the telly on and is watching some performance near Big Ben. Something in the distance catches his eye. Yes. That will do nicely.
Sherlock likes John being confident again. He finds it, entertaining, to watch John be assertive and be Captain Watson sometimes.
John looks like he’s absorbing all this information. Good. Maybe he’ll take a little of this information on board. And the ‘not gay’ train will leave the station, so to speak.
Sherlock braces his hand on Johns’ chest and slowly starts to grind his ass against John’s hope. John grabs Sherlock’s waist and when he begins to move up and down on his cock, John thrusts up and I to to Sherlock. They set a fast pase and they’re both moaning in pleasure and Sherlock just rides John until he’s coming. And John fucks him through his orgasm until he spills into Sherlock’s used hole.
“Merry Christmas boys. You’ll get your presents at lunch time. I’ll be going to my sisters this afternoon and won’t be back until after New Year’s Day. I’m sorry, you’ll have to look after each other. You will have the house to yourselves while Johns home, so be as loud as you want and make the most of it.”
When Sherlock has finally finished his experiment it’s probably somewhere after midnight so he just figures he’ll go to sleep.
Pressing a quick kiss to Johns lips, he began to kiss down Johns neck. Moving slowing downwards he flicked a tongue over each of John’s nipples and dipped into his navel as he made his way closer to his target.
“Because we knew you would react like this. Lunch at your brothers is final, or he’ll make the Detective Inspector stop using you for cases.”
“Sherlock. Greg invites you to crimes scenes so you can help him. And to keep you off the drugs. He’s been doing it longer than I’ve know you.”
“Oi Sherlock” John says louder this time using his Captain Watson voice that Sherlock’s seems to always listen to.
John reached down and tugged the offending article up and over his head. Sherlock was disappointed at what lay beneath.
He might have had a chance if they could’ve made it back to base where he and Anthony have the med bay set up. But John will do his damndest to try to make sure this boy lives. He’s younger than John was when he first joined.
Bringing John his cup of tea and a scone over to him she says, "Terrible business all that war, glad you're not still doing that John. I'd be worried sick."
“Sherlock I miss you too. But I’m not coming home this Christmas. I’ve sent a letter home for everyone and a couple presents. And we can skype on the day so it’ll be like I’m there”
artery in his arm and the blood from his stomach is pulsing almost as fast. John is filled with dread. He reaches for the pack and sets to work. Even though he know how this will end.
The cab ride home is quick and silent. When the arrive home they climb the stairs quickly, not to wake Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock, more nervous then he has been in his entire life, turns to the window and gazes out at London. The city is rather beautiful tonight.
Maybe now isn’t a good time to talk about it. Clearly John is uncomfortable talking about this. Maybe he miscalculated Johns feelings. Maybe today is not a good day to talk about it. Change the subject then.
But after a quick phone call to Mycroft, he did now owe his mother a phone call on her birthday, he had a plan. He just needed to relax. If it didn’t feel right or if it felt like John was going to reject him then he would just say that he meant it as a friend.
John looks taken aback but his expression changes into something Sherlock’s not seen before. He smiles at Sherlock and walks over to him. Reaching up, he untucks it from Sherlock’s shirt and moves them between his fingers. Sherlock tried not to shiver from Johns touch at the the collar of his shirt. John sees that Sherlock has added the extra tag identical to the one he received earlier.
John decides to have dinner and talk after, he thinks food might help the emptiness he’s begining to feel about leaving Sherlock, possibly in less than 36 hours.
“What? Of course not. Remember Sherlock, despite what you may think sometimes, I did get to be a Detective without your help.”
“Yeh well catching her in bed with the PE teacher wasn’t exactly surprising but we said we would make a real go of making the marriage work but she couldn’t even do that”
As they move through the streets to Angelo’s, they catch themselves watching each other through the reflection of the dark windows.
“Yes John what is it you want, I’m in the middle of an important experiment on materials that burn with Sulfur so I wouldn’t recommend touching anything”,
“Looks like it’s Lestrade, so it’s probably a case. The work is more important than sex surely.” John grins and answers the phone.
“I’m sorry Sherlock. I wish I was but they have to give leave to the men with families first. I understand that and maybe they’ll let me come home in time for your birthday”
The grinding sound of Sherlock chair being dragged backwards alerts John to the fact Sherlock is leaving and he watches Sherlock storm out of he restaurant and hurries to follow him.
Sherlock woke a few hours later to a clatter in the kitchen, he checked his clock, it being after nine Mrs Hudson would already be at lawn bowls.
They would have to talk in the morning, but for now Sherlock just wanted to be near John for as long as possible.
Sherlock gasped, John had warmed it up but it’s still felt cool and it being John’s hand and not his own doing this felt very different.
“Don’t take too long Sherlock I still need to speak to you” the only reply John gets is the sound of the bathroom door closing.
He can do that, a date. Or something that feels like it. And if John doesn’t feel the same way he can do what Lestrade said and blame it on stupid traditions. Like they did with the mistletoe. Yes. Lestrade has, for once, given an adequate solution to a problem.
Hi all, sorry I haven’t updated in a while but I finally got around to writing the last three chapters of the fic. I will be posting them in the next day or so after I edit them.
“Sorry Greg, I know how it feels, not a great feeling when you catch your wife having an affair” John sighed, that’s when everything went to shit, catching Mary in bed with Peter.
Neither of them notice the flat has gone dead quiet. Neither of them notice why either but when John returns with the teas he notices there’s a grin on Molly’s face and Mrs Hudson and Mrs Holmes both giggle and starts to gossip.
John takes off his coat and shoes by the door and heads into the kitchen, Sherlock making his way to the bathroom.
“It’s not a chain John. I may have taken your old dog tags from your dresser after you left. I missed you.”
Knight gestures to George and John shakes his head no. She pulls Fred away and John can hear his wail. John picks up his pack and rifle and they begin moving through the rest of the building to the exit.
When Sherlock positioned himself on the bed, John slowly climbed into the space between his legs and braced himself over Sherlock.
“JOHN, I have a theory about what happened and it obviously isn’t a double suicide like Donovan suggested, really wondering why she got that promotion, but I do have a lead, so if you would kindly follow me John we shall go to St.Barts and Molly already has a cadaver ready for me to test my theory, should be fun. Come along John, goodbye Geoffrey”
“Oh, so the ‘date’ with Mycroft went well then.” John teases. Lestrade flushes a bit but denies it was a date.
Gavin was not home yet, considering he had only finished work twenty minutes ago, Sherlock expected him to walk in in two to four minutes depending if Donovan had distracted him for very long.
Despite the curtains, John can see Sherlock standing and watching him. John raises his hand as a goodbye and before he can change his mind gets into the car and lets it take him away. He doesn’t look back knowing he may jump out of the car and sprint back to the flat.
“Detective, it’s good to see you again. Would you like to accompany me over to the Chief Superintendent so you can put your first foot forward, so to speak, with your application?”
“That’s certainly new information. I just thought that he didn’t do relationships at all or something was going on with that assistant of his.” Greg looks like he’s absorbing this information.
Shelock snuggles against John’schest and John wraps his arms around him. When Johns’ hand rubs along his back Sherlock whispers, ‘lower.’ And John played which his arsehole, pushing his come back inside.
The two men do not introduce themselves and obviously they are the ones assigned to protect John. Great, he thinks, babysitters is exactly what he needs. But SS Smith greets John and they talk while they leave the base.
The spike lowers and a crease forms adjacent to it.  Plush lips form a moue of annoyance as Sherlock shakes his head and dances on.  John’s about to demand an answer when he realises they may well be being observed right now, and decides to follow whatever lead Sherlock offers.  He knows how dangerous it can be to fish for information out in the open: memories of a singed ear causes John to rub absent-mindedly at his helix.  Ad-libbing on the fly it is.
John let his head drop to the back of the couch in defeat.  “Just let it be.  He might be a career musician for all we know, practicing for work.  He’s good enough to be.  You can’t begrudge him his practice.”
“Ahh I can’t… somewhere in the back of my wardrobe?” It had taken Sherlock three shopping trips to find exactly what he wanted, finally unearthing the silky shorty shorts in La Perla. Going by the flushed look on John’s face and heavy mouth breathing, it was worth all the unwanted attention he got from various sales boys along the way and one very pushy matronly assistant who looked like she’d eat him for breakfast (in fact, she offered to). “John, I can feel you breathing on me. It’s having an effect on my modesty.”
“YES!  Fucking see-through, Sherlock.  How the hell can a brand new pair of Speedos go see-through in a week?  They haven’t even been wet!”  John reached out and pinched some lycra between his fingers to demonstrate his point and a side seam gave way with a
He crooked his fingers and turned his hand so that only the backs of his knuckles skimmed Sherlock's delicious Sidecock.  His right hand rose to run through curls, tugging until a few spilled from the elegant queue.  "Look at you, you juicy thing, you!  Looking all wanton and dishevelled for me.  Your cheeks are all flushed, your-" he bit down on the tendon standing out on Sherlock's neck, "-neck is straining, you're absolutely panting for me to let you come, aren't you," John whispered against his ear.  Sherlock groaned around the leather keeper and ground his hips back against John.
“Sherlock!  There’s another package arrived for you.  Why have I been taking delivery of packages all day?”
John startled and dragged his eyes up to his tasty little strawberry's face.  The strawberry thrust out his chin and opened his mouth, making a little circular motion with one finger.  John obediently opened his mouth and lent forward.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes, reached out and leisurely dragged that gloss across John’s bottom lip.  John moaned.  Sherlock re-dipped the applicator and painted it over the crests and valleys of John’s top lip.  He leaned back to inspect his work and smiled.
Sherlock thrust his hips back against John and circled, pulling him closer with fingers that were still wrapped around the backs of his thighs.  John grunted into his ear and Sherlock saw stars, coming and coming almost untouched, but for the gentle stroke of John's knuckles down the side of his cock.  John's talented artistry inspired his subject to paint himself with his own undoing.  He'd never been so seduced by words, by feelings, been so wrapped up in the web John wove with his words and commands and...  God he was still coming, still jerking and grinding into John - John!  Had John...?  Yes, he could deduce from John's breathing, not to mention a certain warmth pressed into the seat of his pants, that John in fact, had.
Sherlock preened, and like the drummer, he was only on the beginning of his roll.  “The left-handed factor took me until the second practice session of that first day to deduce.  Due to the nature of the set-up of a standard drum kit, the kick drum is played with the right – or dominant – foot, so it is placed in front of the right leg.  The other main drum used to make the main beats is the snare drum.  That is usually played by the left – or non-dominant – hand, and is set-up in front of the player.  That means if the kit in that particular flat is facing south, the louder, more pounding kick drum would sound closer to the western-facing window and the snare would sound further from it.  Those drums in this kit sound opposite to this, therefore the player is left-handed and has his drums set-up in a left-handed arrangement.  Simple.”
Slightly startled at this, Sherlock faced the bed, spread his legs and bent forward whilst sliding his arms outward until his torso touched the bed, supporting his weight.   With his head turned toward John he brought his hands around to his arse cheeks and gripped, then slowly slid them down the backs of his thighs.  “Come touch me, John” he whispered in invitation.
John whimpered.  Sherlock sat up slightly and twisted around to see John’s face.  He couldn’t handle the lack of visual data any longer.  John had tensed up but his cheeks were pink and he was breathing shallowly through his mouth: arousal.  Sherlock relaxed a bit.
“I’ve been asking myself the same question for a month.” Again, this confused me. Why would John think he had done something wrong?
Another change occurred a week ago. John began spending some of his time reading on our sofa. At first, I’d been irritated by this, as John had his own perfectly good armchair and he knows it’s my favourite spot to lay when trying to work through the particulars of a case. One night, out of frustration I decided to sprawl across the sofa and lay my head in his lap hoping for the action to be a deterrent. It seemed to be the opposite as John had no complaints about the arrangement. He had hummed and shifted his book from in front of my face, resting one elbow on the arm of the sofa and the other, well that’s an unimportant detail. Yet I will note, this was a most preferable turn of events.
There had been a time when an offer to make tea for John had stemmed from his desire to get something in return or from Mrs. Hudson’s reminders of ‘
“May I?” John had asked. I’d been unsure what he meant but as it was John I assumed whatever it was would be fine and nodded.
Any original suspicions I had regarding my clients and their possible involvement with the government or more nefarious agencies were put to rest. As the more deeply my companion and I delved into the case, the more it felt like a children’s scavenger hunt. John, as always, was a little slow on the uptake and was quick to scribble out the encoded message. I have placed the encryption key within this text so that the readers are also able to decode the message. I hope this task will prove to be as trivial to you as it was to me.
“You can do it at home.” Compromise. Drab magazine articles were always stating the importance of compromise in relationships. He supposed that was what he was meant to do in this situation. The resigned sagging of John’s shoulders told Sherlock not all magazine articles were useless.
’. He drinks at least two cups of tea every day. He hates my brother almost as much as I do. Sometimes he hums in the shower. He hasn’t been on a date in over two months and has a truly horrid taste in women. He’s just as much of a dick as I am, he’s just better at hiding it.
Upon returning to Baker Street, I was met by a disapproving and flustered John. I’m not sure why he was surprised, as I’m often neglectful of things which don’t hold my interests and told him as much. This didn’t go well.  John had spoken a few choice words, too vulgar to repeat, taken his coat, and exited the flat.
At first, John had stiffened considerably, which didn’t seem like the right response. I was about to move away when John finally became receptive and hugged back. It was an interesting sensation. It lasted longer than my hugs with Mrs. Hudson, in those cases it was always her hugging me, never a mutual affair. John didn’t smell like sickly sweet perfume, which was good. He smelled of soap with a hint of aftershave. It was a smell akin to trivial sense names like ‘clean breeze’, or ‘open windows’. It was nice. It was very nice. We both pulled away and I returned to my place perched on a kitchen chair. I’m not exactly sure how John felt about the whole thing as after it happened he was still and silent for a long while. The kettle had boiled and cooled by the time John remembered he was making tea and he had to boil it again.
I didn’t have any in the flat, of course, I wasn’t that stupid. Once I had kept a small stash of cocaine beneath the floorboard of the creaking step which led up to the landing of 221B. John had discovered it about a month after he moved in. Since then, I haven’t kept drugs in the flat. It’s probably for the best but last night I regretted this decision.
This was another simple cipher for anyone familiar with cryptography but for those unfamiliar with the art, such as my companion John, I will inform you it is a Polybius Square cipher. Without an encryption key, the deciphering of the code would prove difficult. However, upon finding the referenced quote from the previous code amongst the pages of the text a scrap of paper fell from the book revealing the key.
“Have you ever thought with that big brain of yours that it’s not smart to insult your doctor? I could always start ignoring the Hippocratic oath.”
My attempts to establish old boundaries between myself and John had been a dismal failure. I covered the sofa in piles of old case files, my scientific journals and monographs to remove the temptation of lying there with John. He chastised me to clean the flat and when I didn’t, he did. When I refused to sit with him on the sofa, he would give me a perplexed look. I stopped eating breakfast altogether, just to avoid his knee pressing against my own at the kitchen table. He would find me during the day and thrust a plate of food beneath my nose, refusing to budge until at least half of the food was gone.
‘Death,’ The farm boy had said one morning, was ‘just a part of life’. Even at seven, Sherlock had realised the phrase was the type of thing ordinary people said when they were trying to be profound. To him, it just sounded like someone stating the obvious. People were born, people died. It was the muddled, mess of middle that was interesting.
Hypothesis: John will notice the presents of sugar in his tea when roughly 2g (½ teaspoon) is added to his morning tea. He won’t complain about it until 8g (2 teaspoons) are added.
Sherlock noted a slight tremor in John’s hands. If he wasn’t able to feel the slight tremble he would have deemed it a trick of the light. John Watson was an unwavering soldier when facing danger but at that moment, he reminded Sherlock of the man he had first met. It was the John Watson who believed himself to be a man injured to the point of breaking, a shattered mug irreparably damaged.
On these nights, John would often drift in and out of sleep in his armchair. This left him sore and stiff the next morning. I don’t recall the moment the decision was made but through means of natural progression, an armchair appeared tucked into the corner of John’s bedroom, and on his bad nights, he leaves the door ajar. It was this which led me to become intimately accommodated with John’s room and therefore I was able to use it in my mind palace.
“You do,” John’s voice was stern. His hand tugged on the back of Sherlock’s jacket, forcing the taller man to stop.
A/N: 'Thou art too dear for my possessing,' is a quote from Shakespeare's Sonnet 87. It is believed the sonnet details an unrequited love between two males as it is a part of Shakespeare's 'Fair Youth' sonnets. It is also a nod to the original Conan Doyle stories. In 'A Study in Scarlet' Watson lists Holmes' 'Knowledge of Literature—Nil.' Which is ironic because throughout the rest of the 'Canon' Holmes quotes Shakespeare multiple times (even in BBC's Sherlock). Most famously, 'the game is afoot'.
“I wouldn’t know what that’s like. My family was never together enough to fall apart.” It was a fact and Sherlock stated it as such but the little glimmer of surprise in John’s eyes told him he might not be as horrible at sharing as he had first assumed.
On the train ride back to London John and I sat across from one another in the compartment. I unpacked how I had come to the conclusion that the husband had been cheating, most of which came from testimonies given by his other coworkers. They had described the man and his secretary as having ‘a close but professional relationship.’ The former seemed to be an observation of the couple together while the latter was most likely a comment made by the husband when asked about his relationship with his younger secretary.
Upon remembering the mug, Sherlock had an oddly comforting thought. Skulls and mugs could be fixed in the same way, with John’s hands. They were the same hands that were now tinkering away at the gash on his head.
This is as far as my experimentation has gone thus far. I haven’t yet defined the boundaries between John and myself but I’ve determined hugging is fine. As far as my own involvement in the whole process, I have concluded that I like hugging John and if given the opportunity I would gladly do it again, which suggests John is the exception to my previously established ideologies. This is the worst possible outcome as this revelation has caused me to formulate another hypothesis, one which I’m unwilling to explore, as it is impossible to examine.
I fear my infrequent reading of John’s blog has begun to show in my own writing as upon rereading this entry my account seems overly sentimental and unconcerned with the facts of the Method of Loci. This technique is not meant to be an emotional one which has led me to think I may need to continue practicing the technique myself. Perhaps I will write a more accurate account at a later date.
“After all the shit you’ve put me through, you’re going to ask if this is okay?” This confused me, I may try to unpack the statement later but I was glad I seemed to make him relax.
It was then I remembered John’s sleeping habits when it came to the long list of girlfriends he had since I made his acquaintance. He stays the night at their house and they have sex but they never sleep together. He comes back to Baker Street with a sore neck and a barely perceptible limp from sleeping on their sofa.
Before I detail to you the events which occurred over the time since I last updated you, I wish to state that my actions were perfectly logical and well-founded. I was ‘missing’ for three days. I use the word ‘
It was John who reminded me of the existence of this blog. Up until now, it had been a forgotten piece of data. One of the most critical things to remember when embarking upon the science of deduction is to eliminate all extraneous information. These include but are not limited to: the names of work colleagues, the scores of football matches, and unless directly related to a case, the solar system. It has come to my attention that the world is sorely in need of an outline to logical, deductive reasoning, which is not subject to the theatrics and sentimentality that can be found in the personal blog of my colleague and flatmate, John H. Watson.
“You’re an idiot,” He told me. This is the only time I will ever except someone using that term in relation to myself as the words that followed truly made me feel idiotic.
“Right. Yes. Brilliant,” John breathed before his face composed itself and the look of a man deep in concentration came over him. He had considered his next words carefully.
Upon awakening this morning in Baker Street to a broken heating system and a bone-chilling freeze, I couldn’t help but think of Montague Street.
All this to say I need a case to distract me. If the readers would contact either myself or John on our respective blogs regarding cases of interest, we shall examine them. I fear if nothing comes up soon, I might have to contact my brother and everyone will be all the more miserable for that outcome.
He shut his eyes and rested his head on my shoulder. This was another action to add to the list of ‘things John is now okay with doing’. It seems to be growing by the day. I rested my head against the top of his, something else he is now okay with and found myself falling asleep. It was the first time I can ever recall being able to sleep on a train. It was pleasant.
John groaned but complied, grabbing a hand mirror from the cabinet beneath the sink and handing it to Sherlock. The two spent a moment shifting around each other. The quiet dance ended with Sherlock on the floor and John hunched over on the rim of the bathtub, the mirror propped up beside him.
There is a difference between theory and practice, as I’m well aware. The only way I could know for sure if I would enjoy hugging John was to do so. This posed a problem as all of the new advances in our relationship had been initiated by John. How does one know the right time or place to do something?
John suddenly began to pull away. I would come home in the morning to an empty house. He still lived there, of course. His clothes were in the dresser and the kettle had been boiled not long before I entered as it was still warm but John was nowhere to be seen. When he was home, he would hardly speak. I decided to stay home at night again. The door to his bedroom was not only closed but locked. The two of us, normally so in sync, felt somehow off-kilter.
This is how I believed we would continue but time together seemed to soften John’s resolve. There are rare occasions when the weather is particularly unpleasant and his war wounds ache, making the bed preferable to his armchair in the sitting room. Those who know John don’t need to be told that he doesn’t take the failing of his body lightly. That’s how John and I slipped into the habit of sorting through cold case files on his bed during his worse days. Of course, there was also our less frequent nocturnal habits. Physical injuries aren’t all John brought back from the war. I know John well enough to understand he doesn’t want what he deems as a ‘shortcoming’ to be detailed for the general public. As a doctor, John appears to have an unhealthy bias towards the importance of physical injury over that of the mind.
It was four in the morning and I hadn’t slept in three days. It’s always around day three things begin to get difficult. On day three, heroin seems like a logical idea. A cure for an ailment. It’s really the equivalent of taking paracetamol to alleviate a headache. On a brain which has been deprived of sleep for three days, it seems like the same thing.
The concept of Socratic questioning outlines the importance of asking questions to develop a deeper understanding of a subject, prompting an individual to identify and assess their preconceived notions and biases to test the validity of their supposition. When I began working with John and explaining my deductions I would find him asking questions, which in some instances I was unable to answer. On a rare occasion, John would ask a question which would point me to a glaringly obvious, yet overlooked aspect of a crime scene. For the readers’ benefit, I shall supply an example of such a situation.
With all the pieces in place and a painful call to my brother to confirm my suspicions, the crime became overly simple. The flat owner was an American and wanted criminal, charged with war crimes in Iraq along with kidnapping and murder across the continent of Europe. Two agents had been discharged to track the criminal, the first had disappeared three months prior to the man’s murder while the second had been the young woman. Another agent had been placed on the case after the first man went missing. A simple covert operation was made complex by the emotionality of one agent.
A simple observation I made after my time living with John is that aside from our now commonplace adventures working for Scotland Yard and over-emotional Londoners, John is a creature of habit. He enjoys a cup of tea each morning while reading the paper or browsing online news sites. He enjoys milk in his tea. The exact colour of his ideal tea could be described as ‘warm tan’. This information was gathered from last month’s experiment. He also detests sugar in his tea. From there I formed two research questions.
Despite his denials, he knew the basic laws of human survival applied to him. Yes, he could go for days without sleeping but nevertheless he slept. In John’s words, he could go for a ‘medically miraculous’ time without food, yet still, he ate. He had gone more than thirty years of his life believing he could survive without love and yet still- it appeared, he loved. The only question was when?
John has always been happy enough to share his things with me. He might gripe when I use his laptop or phone, but he never bothers to change his passwords or lock them away. So I assume he is at least neutral on sharing. He’s more than happy to share food. I believe this has more to do with his worries that I don’t eat enough than his affinity for generosity. He never gripes when I steal food from his plate, he just gives an amused smirk.
I wanted to stop my experimentation regarding the relationship between John and myself, as I theorised further advancement would be treacherous. However, last night I saw no other alternatives but to push our boundaries once more. As I’ve stated (see ‘
The morning before in one of his characteristic fits of frustrated petulance, Sherlock had knocked his favourite mug from the kitchen bench, shattering it. He had been trying to solve a case. After emerging from his mind palace several hours later with a clue regarding the location of the suspect he had looked over to find his favourite mug held together with superglue, placed with such precision the cup was still able to hold tea. Sherlock pretended not to notice.
This is a memory technique I have explored in length across my lifetime. It is a mental model of a place in the physical world, a place to store information. Of course, my own is much larger than a room but a room is a place to begin. The current size of my own mind palace encompasses several locations familiar to me across my lifetime. The most worn area of this place is, of course, the sitting room of Bakers Street. This room is used to store information regarding current cases. Once the case is finished, the information is deleted or filed away in other rooms for later revision. The mental model of Baker Street differs from the flat in several ways. Upon moving to 221B and having to reshape the mind palace to suit more familiar surroundings I disregarded a singular room. This was John’s room.
In the mind palace, John’s room is situated just outside of my childhood bedroom. When I was a child I would gaze out from my window at the garden. There is something about flowers which has always fascinated me, they are an embellishment which I don’t often afford myself. In the original house, there was a window that opened out to a Juliet balcony where I would spend hours peering over chemistry textbooks. In the mind palace, this window leads to John’s room.
I loathe the winter months as I do the summer ones, though both for different reasons. An escalation in heat also brings an escalation in violent crime. This is a well researched and documented phenomena, the results of which I have seen echoed in my practice. As a consulting detective, when waking up to a heatwave I feel a thrill similar to the one John informs me ‘normal’ people have on Christmas mornings. Last time a heatwave occurred I worked four cases in the space of a week. It was brilliant. Two murders, one kidnapping, and a case of stolen identity. It was better than any Christmas. John didn’t say it- he never does, not appropriate, not good but he felt the same.
“Sherlock?” It should be noted, having just woken up, John was rather more daft than usual. I hadn’t seen the need to respond. I buried myself deeper under the covers. They smelled of John.
I spent the better part of the afternoon performing increasingly dangerous exothermic reactions at the dinner table in an attempt to heat the room. John put his foot down after a mixture of sodium and chlorine almost set the flat ablaze. If John and I were boiled down to a base chemical I could imagine us as nothing else but sodium and chlorine. John, sodium: soft, yet solid, essential for life and myself chlorine: light yet hazardous, used to strip surfaces and poison men in warfare. He could be found in the depth of the earth, myself in the atmosphere. Both chemicals on their own, or combined with others are volatile and yet the product of the two is nothing more than table salt. Alone we are capable of explosions, together we are steady crystalline.
In the early days, the nights where John couldn’t sleep were spent with him sitting in his armchair, reading a mystery novel while I played the violin. On his bad nights, he didn’t even mind me plucking away at the strings. He is the only person who I can’t deter simply through the use of the violin. This was another experiment, which I may detail on another day.
A lack of blood at a crime scene indicates the victim may have been killed at a different location and the avoidance of topics when interviewing a suspect suggests they know more than they say. One case which John is yet to write an account for was solved simply by noting the lack of noise in the night. The victim owned two Dobermans, who had several noise complaints lodged against them in the eighteen-months the victim lived in her Hampstead flat, yet on the night she died, they were silent. Her killer was someone familiar to both her and her dogs. The boyfriend, obviously.
Moreover, if there is an indication that the wedding ring was removed post-mortem such as the lack of a tan or an indentation on the ring finger it indicates that the ring had value in the eyes of the killer. Whether the ring had a monetary value or a sentimental one would remain to be seen. There isn’t enough information in this scenario to discuss crime, motives, and the victim in-depth as it would lead to conjecture. However, it does illustrate the importance of exploring the lack of
The fascination wasn’t in the killing. Hence his lack of a concrete diagnosis despite the behest of both his parents. His fascination with death relied on what it could tell him about life. He had never believed in anything cosmic or godly but he never felt the need to quicken the pace of death. It wasn’t something he felt capable of doing to anyone or anything besides himself. Later Sherlock would learn this was untrue, he could kill but there was no joy in it, no fascination. There was a fascination in the function.
The man from security recounted the night the victim was killed in startling clarity. Clarity can neither prove nor disprove innocence. More often than not, lies hold more details than the truth. When locking up the office space the man glance to the window of the would-be-victim. As he recounts it, the window had been obscured by a thick curtain. However, the face of a man aged between thirty-five and forty glanced out. The security guard described the man as ‘gaunt’. The two had caught eyes for a moment before the curtain was drawn again. This was around 1 a.m. Upon finishing his shift, while exiting the building the security guard recalled looking up to the same window, finding his view now unobscured and two figures silhouetted.
While John spoke the thumb of his right hand traced over Sherlock’s hairline, pushing a wayward curl behind his ear to get a better view of the injury. It was both intimate and practical. John’s eyes never left the gash, but his hand did linger.  He then began stitching. To Sherlock’s surprise, he hardly noticed. One of the many ointments John had slathered on the wound had likely been a localised numbing agent. He could feel a small pulling at his head but it wasn’t painful.
I was frustrated, annoyed, and overall just bloody tired. I felt like shooting the walls just to hear the echoes of a deafening crack and add to the entropy of the system which was Baker Street. I felt like throwing something out a window just to watch the perfect parabola of its trajectory. I wanted to scream. I felt like doing drugs. Before John, I likely would have. Yet this time he was the cause of my frustration, the case I was yet to crack. How could one balance the possibility of wanting something, with the reality of having it when the likely outcome would just be losing it?
With a current lack of cases, today has found me sprawled on the sofa, contemplating this deduction of absence and the observation of negative space. John has spent his day out of the flat. After yesterday’s experiment, I can’t help but wonder if this absence is somehow my doing.
There had been a logical explanation for the heroin use at the time, but I’m unable to recall it. It had something to do with balance. Like one balances a chemical equation. The cocaine was a high, a stimulant, an upper. But what is left when the case is over and the high continues? What does one do when they need to sleep, when it feels like the universe as a whole is in flux and you can feel it, when everything is hurtling at you with breakneck speed and there are millions upon millions of new ideas and possibilities scratching at the corners of your mind and there are loose threads on your bedsheets, and when did this happen, and how did this occur? Where is the nearest place to buy new bedsheets and would they be open? And why does one need bedsheets? What real purpose do they hold?
In the last few weeks, I’ve gotten into the habit of working on several cases at once. With the foresight I now have, I realise this was done to distract myself from the one true case which captivated my mind, but before I detail that case, I must detail the others. I spent most nights in the early half of the month out of Baker Street tracking leads for cold cases. It’s a tedious task but Scotland Yard had nothing better to offer and for once I felt like legwork.
“The floor plans of the flat say it’s twenty-two feet.” John hummed as though trying to follow along.
If John would like to argue any of these points I shall be waiting at Baker Street for his snide retorts.
He settled back down into the bed, leaving half a foot between us. I hadn’t realised my hand was encroaching on his side of the invisible boundary until I heard the rustling of sheets and felt the lightest touch ghost across my fingers and palms. In my tired state, I found myself clinging on to the touch. It was a hand, John’s hand. His hand was warm and calloused. I could feel the slightest hint of a tremble, which seemed strange as since John and I began solving cases together his hands had remained steadfast. Like his ever-present limp, the slight tremble in his hand had been a memory. Now I felt it, another strange phenomenon. I’m not known to be a comforting person but I felt as though John needed something.
I don’t like my stream of thought to be muddled by conversation but as John is my partner, in all sense of the word, I supposed I should tell him something.
We soon took our search across town to the client’s bookshop. Where little excavation led us to discover a copy of The Art of War. Within the front page was another note, this time a series of vague, seemingly nonsensical numbers. Of course, another code.
I was contacted by a young woman who wished for John and me to visit her mother’s home in Cornwall as she claimed to be experiencing a ‘haunting’ by her late husband. The husband in question was said to have died two years prior while on a fishing trip with a handful of work colleagues. He and four others had gathered their money together to buy a fishing boat. This seemed odd as the man worked a well enough paid job to afford the costs on his own. However, discussion with the wife revealed the man to be frugal to the point of avarice.
I felt a rush pulse through my body at this idea and began to pace around the edges of the room. For the idiotic members of Scotland Yard, it appeared as though I had finally entered the frenzied state of psychosis and mania they all believed lied behind the surface of my otherwise composed veneer. John knew there was more to the matter and gave me a sidelong glance as he walked beside me.
John gave Sherlock the same awestruck look he always had when the taller of the two decided to indulge him by explaining his deductive reasoning.
Furthermore, after over a year of living from pay-check to pay-check and town to town, the husband and his new companion found themselves wishing for the stability they once had. It was then the husband remembered his supply of money, tucked beneath his wife’s mattress and returned to spy on the house, waiting for the right moment to collect it. This of course was when the wife spotted her supposedly dead husband and had assumed him to be a ghost.
Within the mind palace, John’s door leads to the sitting room of my childhood home. This room holds more asinine cases that are either rudimentary to my work, or cases that fascinated me as a child. A pair of trainers has found a permanent place on the entrance mat and beneath it, an old Polaroid of the World’s Fair Hotel.
I won’t delve into a past that holds no bearings on the present but needless to say I haven’t used frequently in some time, after a bad miscalculation. The whole trick to being a functioning drug user is the ability to discern the dosage needed to produce the desired effect without developing a dependency. Tolerance is also a painful variable in the equation, but I’m not here to explain how I managed to use drugs for as long as I did.
There were many ways, countless moments and ample opportunities for the multi-headed hydra, which was sentimentality, to rear its ugly head in the space between Sherlock and John’s undefined relationship. It was only a matter of time before Sherlock was able to name this previously indefinable emotion. Love.
It became clear we needed to talk, something we’ve never been good at and so we did, long into the afternoon. We sat on John’s bed and we talked. We solved the case, which was our relationship together. It’s still a bit of a muddled affair but we both agreed that the idea of developing a closer relationship was a desirable outcome. The best word for it, I suppose, is partners. After all, John and I have always been partners.
“Everything alright?” He asked next. It seems to be a habit of his, to ask if I’m alright following a display of closeness. I made note to conduct a systematic analysis of other transcripts I have recorded to see if such a theory holds true.
How dare I ruin this. This one thing, this one person who I felt like I could truly connect with and talk to, who I could frustrate without having him leave. I know I’m a hard man to get along with but if anyone in the world was up to the challenge, it would be John Watson and this last frustrating mess of sentimentality was going to ruin it all. The feelings had interwoven themselves in my veins, my heart, my throat. There was no way of killing the parasitic emotions without also killing the host. So, what does one do? I had been delaying the inevitable.
The pendulum swung in the opposite direction. I’d planned to pull away from John, before re-establishing our old boundaries and normal comforts. I needed some more time to get my head around the matter at hand. Just when I believed I was coming to grips with things, it appeared to fall from my fingers. The solution to this problem was water in my hands.
To test if this was a situational adjustment or a new and acceptable part of our interactions the following morning at breakfast I sat across from him at our dining room table, stole a piece of toast from his plate (as was usual), and nudged his ankle with my foot. John gave me the same look of withered amusement common when I steal his breakfast and nudged my foot back. I hadn’t expected this reaction. It appears John is still full of surprises. For the next two mornings, I did the same, to the same effect. It would appear this kind of touching is now acceptable. For my part, I believe this to be a welcome change.
John had let out a short exhalation of breath. It was something between a huff of indignation and a sigh of disbelief. I know John’s facial expressions in fine detail. In my mind, there is an entire index dedicated to John’s micro-expressions. He’s the type of man who can give you paragraphs in one quirk of the brow. I watched several emotions pass across John’s face in the space of a second. Concern, frustration, confusion, and at last, something like hope.
“I know it was before you went to medical school. You have the precision of a doctor but your methods are that of a self-trained man. Your first instinct was to go for a suture which was simple to do but also not the most practical. It took a moment for your medical training to kick in and then you began to do a more complicated but sturdier and more practical stitch. Which tells me you likely learnt the process before medical school.”
“What am I observing? What does the body tell me about the murder weapon? Does what this person saying align with the evidence?”
During my nights out, John would text me asking where I was, when I would be home, and if he could come with me. I ignored him. I needed space to solve my cases, John would be a distraction. But why? Up until this point John had never been a distraction but now being in the same room as him was enough to throw my mind from the case completely. It was insufferable. I spend weeks pushing John away and for his credit, he remained steadfast, until he didn't.
Sherlock hid a smile that threatened to twitch across his lips by ducking his head and clambering to his feet.
I asked John what he thought of the whole thing. He confirmed that most women would deem the man’s behaviour as ‘creepy’ and would have invested in some blinds, but he supposed he couldn’t speak for everyone. Perhaps she had been flirting, maybe she had been flattered. Who was to say? It was odd, that she hadn’t invested in curtains or blinds. Then again, who was she? There was only one bedroom so it was unlikely she was the man’s flatmate. It was always possible she was the flat owners girlfriend but how had she missed the dead body which should have been in the centre of the room? Then there was the contradictory recount from the man working as night security at the office building.
Upon arriving at 235 Baker Street I found myself ushered into the sitting room by a man who eerily fitted the description of my client’s missing business partner. I came to realise something was very wrong. One look at the smirk on John’s face told me everything I needed to know. I turned from John to watch as my client entered the sitting room, his eyes also trained on John. My client, their missing business partner, and our neighbours Jonathan and Shannon Norbury were one and the same.
I spent a few nights in an out of the way gambling den. I walked the line between being good enough at poker to appear to belong in such an establishment but not so good as to draw attention to myself. John has told me I have a propensity for showing off and poker is such a dull and unimaginative game. Yet, my conversations with the players did lead to some promising results.
I handed John another slide without a word. He took the item without question. A pen, a mug, and a pipette were added to the growing collection of items in his grasp before he questioned what I was doing and why he was holding an assortment of random objects. Chameleons, infants, and a sleep-deprived John Watson share what is known as a ‘Palmar Grasp Reflex’. It’s the reason newborns grab their parents’ thumbs, making their idiotic hearts swell.  It is a rudimentary, involuntary response likely stemming from our days as primates but people always attribute it to sentiment. Nevertheless, whenever given the opportunity I run similar such experiments with John.
I’m not the type of man who often refers to the Greek philosophers in the context of my scientific endeavours. My knowledge on the subject could be described as minimal. Though it may be said philosophers like Socrates were a cornerstone in the creation of modern science you wouldn’t equate his rudimentary musings to what science has become. One would just as soon see a doctor praising Hippocrates for his work with phlegm. However, I must concede I greatly overlooked the effectiveness of Socratic questioning until I began working with John.
“Right,” John had sighed when Sherlock hadn’t spoken thinking he had dismissed the story as sentiment. Sherlock had been too focused on John’s hands to realise he had expected a response.
John and I were standing before the body of a twenty-something law student. I’m not one for embellishments but it must be noted that the death was gruesome. There were lacerations to the wrists, ankles, and neck of the body. The victim had four broken ribs and their face was covered by a pillowcase. The cause of death was asphyxiation. At first, I supposed the crime to be one of passion, a violent crime motivated by revenge or anger. The student’s body was found in their apartment building but it was clear they had died elsewhere. There was no sign of forced entry.
Placed on the front desk under several hardback Oscar Wilde novels was a copy of The Voynich Manuscript. Nestled between two crudely drawn images that vaguely resemble plants was a final sheet of paper. This message wasn’t encoded.
’ there are several instances when hugs are appropriate. The first is for comfort. This often occurred after a character had found out something mind-numbingly stupid for the sake of television drama: their partner was cheating, they had a terminal illness, or some such event. The next type of hug happened after a love confession, which could be ruled out straight away and the last seemed to occur almost at random between two individuals who shared a close relationship. It seemed as though this final type of hug would most suit John and my own relationship. This didn’t help me much in determining when I was meant to initiate the hug. It often seemed like a placeholder for a hello or a goodbye. With this in mind, I attempted to use it as such.
“Look at me, John.”  John dragged his eyes away from the Trex.  Sherlock was flushed and his eyes were sparkling at John, begging him to trust him.  Suddenly John was right there in the moment with him.
“I’m going to fuck you fast and hard now, Sherlock”, he murmured. “And I’m not going to stop until I fuck my come into you. Then I’m going to suck that stunning cock until you gift me every drop you’ve got.” John skimmed a hand up Sherlock’s stomach and across his chest. “Then, my tall tasty cake, I’m going to pull up those tiny little silky black shorts you so stupidly brought here to taunt me with, and I’m going to take your hand and make you walk home naked but for them under your Belstaff, with your cock hanging out the front and my come dripping out the back.” Sherlock trembled against John’s chest and his fingers clawed at the wall. John didn’t think either of them could get much more wound up.
“John, I read that listening to soothing, familiar music can put you at ease so I bought a waterproof speaker that will allow me to hear Bach while my ears are under the water.”  He turned it on and popped it in the water.
“Ya really wanna know?”  The kid pulled the netting aside and leaned out the window.  John gasped and Sherlock gritted out
music.  But no, this boy predominantly plays standard trad jazz classics by British artists, and reggae.  Unusual combination.  Both genres requiring a completely different set of skills and almost opposing techniques.  Jazz drumming emphasising the second and fourth beats of each bar, using tonal fills with off-beats, syncopation and improvisation.  There’s often changes in time signature and periods of extended free-drumming without set timing.  It uses different parts of the drums, too, such as hitting the metal drum sides.  Think of jazz drumming, John, as the abstract art of music.
Sherlock clicked away at the keyboard, researching his latest obsession.  He heard John shuffling around in the doorway, ”oh, and a tabloid newspaper if you please, John”
blood-red nail varnish that would make John’s eyes bug.  Such was Sherlock’s devotion to his task he found himself fervently fingering five inch fuck-me-they-can’t-be-legal velvet ankle-strap heels that even
John reached up and pulled Sherlock’s head towards him.  He touched lips with the only man he’d ever loved and nodded.  “Come on, Sherlock.  I’m all yours.”
The crumpet arose and John opened his eyes and reached out to free it’s cock.  He pulled Sherlock close and took both eager erections in one hand, drawing one of Sherlock’s hands around to cover them too.  Together they stroked as they smiled at each other.  Things got a bit pant-y and giggly very quickly so spare hands lifted to cover each other’s mouths.  Hands were shuttling, bottoms were thrusting, noses were breathing very hard until finally, as John had demanded,
"Hmmm well, I shall have to fix that then, won't I..."  John tapped the riding crop against his leg twice, and saw Sherlock lose his sass, and swallow, his eyes fixed to the crop.
“Yes, tea would be nice” he mused as he paced the floor.  John gave it about thirty seconds before Sherlock wouldn’t be able to help but show-off.  The kettle boiled.  Annnnnnyy second now… three, two, one…
gave them the finger, spun around and disappeared back into her room to resume her banging and crashing.
“Oh how I love you, Sherlock.  You’ll drive me absolutely barmy one day, I’m sure, but I’m fairly certain it will be more than worth it”.  Sherlock hummed along his length and John smiled blindly.
So he reached up and slipped the waistbands of the trunks and tights down to unveil his bottom, until the drawstring pulled tightly across the base of his cock.  Feeling sexily laid bare to John’s gaze he reached right down to his ankles and trailed his fingers up his stocking clad legs.  The height of the heels made a pretty shape out of Sherlock’s calves.
This was the moment Sherlock had been preparing for all week, but unfortunately for him it was not exactly happening in the calm, controlled circumstances he was counting on.  John had gone almost
He’d had a bit of a think about Sherlock’s resistance to the lessons and felt a bit ashamed when he realised that sticking an adult consulting detective in with a bunch of screaming kids was insulting to Sherlock.  It was no wonder the man held on to his pride in silence, choosing to formulate alternate methods of avoidance.  He felt terrible that he’d just barged on ahead with his plans without considering the bigger picture so he’d mentally revised and booked Sherlock into a private one-on-one lesson.
“Now, let’s pick up that lovely silvery-grey pair of Speedos that perfectly match your eyes that I spotted on the way in, and on the way home I’ll tell you all about the private lesson
Most children seek approval from their parents, but especially from their fathers.  The fact that he plays reggae in the early afternoon when mothers are more often than not home, and saves the more difficult jazz pieces for later in the evening when fathers are traditionally home leads me to believe his mother is the parent of Caribbean origin, his father is a British jazz lover and he plays music they love in the hope of impressing or pleasing them.
Finding himself standing in a bit of an hypnotic Homer stupor at the display rack as he recalled his encounter with The Black Shorts of Sex, John found himself zombie-shuffling toward the counter with a pair of Speedos in bright red.
One perfect set of puckered lip prints in the same rouge lipstick lay like a brand on an otherwise exquisitely white nether cheek.  John’s cock sprung to full attention.  His eyes glazed over and his mind drifted back to last night and just how those lip prints got there…..
John brushes a kiss to the sticky slit before dampening his lips and sliding Sherlock’s length inside his mouth.  He can only make it about half-way down comfortably, at first.  The feeling of being so full of Sherlock is a headrush.  He gentles his twitching lover with soft strokes over his hips as he slides almost all the way back, before sinking down again, a tiny bit further.  “Mmmmmn.”  He can’t help himself.  Muffled sounds emanate around Sherlock’s cock, buzzing his lips and fuelling his ardour as he undulates rhythmically.  He can hear Sherlock’s breath catching, feel his body fluttering as John coaxes his pleasure forth.  Ironically, he feels more masterful than he’s ever felt with a lover.  Probably because he’s never felt as wanted, as desired as he feels right now with Sherlock.  Sherlock’s guileless, uncontrived reactions speak directly to John’s heart which seems currently linked to his libido, and it’s all rushing in to crowd his thoughts with,
No, he didn't want to be John 'nothing-ever-happens-to-me' Watson again.  He chose not to be that man long ago and since that day, life with Sherlock had certainly been a lot more interesting.  And that wasn't even counting whatever the mad idiot had planned next.  Suddenly he couldn’t wait for Tuesday.
“A case I worked for my brother.  Mycroft knew he had a double agent passing secrets to Korea but couldn’t figure out how the information was getting out.  It was ingenious in its simplicity - he was getting the drummer in a jazz club he frequented to play an encoded beat for a Korean agent who was working behind the bar.  I was surprised Mycroft didn’t figure it out himself, frankly.”
The detective looked green.  He loved John’s penis.  If anything happened to it he’d go into a decline.  “Why?  What’s wrong with it, John,” he trembled, scared of the answer.
John grunts and performs the miracle of holding on for another four thrusts before he blessedly feels Sherlock clamp down and keen.  He thumbs Sherlock’s cheek with a trembling hand, and watches as Sherlock spurts his climax across John’s chest, wide eyes locked on his.  Another two thrusts and he’s flying, muscles straining, chest heaving, hearing nothing and feeling everything.
A consulting detective moved pretty swiftly towards a doctor-strewn sofa at that point.  Kneeling was involved.  So was sucking, licking, humming, praising, stroking, fingering and various other impulsive acts arising from the heady drama of the moment.  Needless to say, said doctor made sure rhythms weren’t disturbed until everyone was happy.
He thrust faster.  He wanted so badly to mark Sherlock as his own, his head nearly melted at the idea of placing his claim on his love.  And it’s that thought that had him shattering outward, ever expanding, pouring himself into his mate marking him as his.
“God John, you look so beautiful, so perfectly trusting, so utterly abandoned.  I can’t believe I’ve made you look like that.”
In short, ‘early distraction’.  John, as we have mentioned, was very partial to Sherlock in red so Sherlock purloined and trawled through various catalogues with the avid obsession of a devotee, pinpointing the
John must have briefly gone off-line, because the next thing he knows, he is standing in the foyer of a club.  Sherlock is behind him, relieving him of his coat and handing it to the rather menacing-looking attendant.  As he blinks his way back up to the surface, he feels Sherlock’s hands either side of his ribs, sliding smoothly upwards, until they curve around to cross over his chest.  John goes to turn his head to see what the bloody hell the git is up to, but is arrested by said git’s chin dropping onto his shoulder, and a rumbling baritone purring, “What shall we induuulge in first, Joooohhn?”
“John, do you know how many times I’ve regretted saying that?  About seventy five times a day, from three hours after I said it.  Running across rooftops with you was more exciting than ANYTHING I’d ever done with another living person until then.  I immediately wanted to take it back but I thought your natural tenacity would override the need.  Your fortitude and persistence with women, despite my every effort at sabotage, I thought, would mean you would try again, negating my need to retract that detestable statement, but no.  Your stubbornness worked against me, and thus, I am forced to admit I was an idiot.  A huge, ridiculous idiot!  I regret ever uttering that hateful statement that stopped you thinking of me as a sexual being, as someone who might want to be with you…..  As someone who might have a chance with you.”
“The only thing stopping me from killing you, Sherlock, is knowing you planned it all before I told you about the private lesson –
Sherlock appeared in the sitting room with a piece of fur stuck to his finger.  “I need to dissolve this glue”
“This was a more complex deduction.  Over the course of a week or so I couldn’t help but be forced to listen to his repertoire.  The music he chooses to play is not typical music for a teenager.  Most would be playing music from the charts, bands popular with other teenagers or,” he squinched up his nose, “
John helped Sherlock out of the sling and they wrapped themselves in towels and went to the cabana.  They’d been told to make themselves at home so John fished out some fresh fruit, nuts and other snacks from the compact kitchen.  They relaxed together on the chaise, John spreading his legs apart and patting the space between for Sherlock, who leant his back against John’s chest and sighed.
John looked, astonished, at the living embodiment of Sherlock's deductions: dreadlocked hair, caramel skin, slender build, spectacles and bandaged left wrist, which was waving a set of drum sticks around like a baton and extending them perilously far through the window.  “I’ll tell ya then.  I’ve been thinking and thinking all night and day and I’ve had to face the conclusion that I like her
“I could tell you were going to take an early bow, and I wasn’t sure of your thoughts on encores, so I forestalled you with distraction.”
They were borrowing Molly’s car overnight so they could drive out to the property tomorrow and John was about to cab it over to Bart’s to pick it up.
John prodded experimentally at the silvery trails of clear gel.  It looked like a demented giant slug had slithered across their kitchen in a very haphazard, drunken way.
“I am bery much looking porward to inthructing you”.  Juan managed to make the word “instructing” sound obscene.
“Yes John,” the crumpet panted, “I’m very ready for you.  Take it out, please.  I want your hot length in me.”
“Sherlock, please get those bloody gorgeous shoes off, and take down those stockings but put the Speedos back on for me.  Your cock looks amazing in them when it’s hard.”  John held out a hand to his sweetie pulling him up, letting him lean on him while he ditched one shoe at a time.
The morning sunlight lay across John’s nose and cheek like a slash of paint.  The warmth prickled his skin until said doctor’s nose twitched.  A hand arose to scratch, eyelids flickering open to espy long, tapered fingers tipped with blood red nails lying palm-down on the bed beside him.
"Well, Sherlock, all that talk you did about artistic perspective makes me want to exercise my artistic rights and view your Sidecock from another perspective.  See how I get on with your crop right-handed..."
“So?” he repeated.  John could see he’d be stuck on ‘so’ for a while.  Time to nudge the needle out of the groove.
John gently removed the crop from Sherlock's pants and flipped it in his hand.  He lifted it to Sherlock's lips and growled, "Open".  Sherlock complied, opening his mouth to receive the shaft of the crop across his lips.  "Now, bite down".  Sherlock bit.  And groaned.
“John, please let me assure you that if it was only data I was after, I could have picked up any random for that.”
He peered carefully at John.  John was braced soldier-straight, leaning slightly forward from the heels, hands fisted at his sides, chin jutting out, eyes narrowed on Juan.  Deduction: John a bit not happy.
“Nobody.  Nothing.  Just get that towel around you, will you.  We’re going out there, getting dressed and going home right now.”
It took Sherlock only two days, six catalogues and three live frogs before formulating a plan for next Tuesday.
There stood Sherlock, twisting around as if he was actually concerned about the thread hanging from the back of his bathers whilst another, more pressing issue was in evidence at the front.
“ME lighten up?  ME?!  Are we in the same reality here?” he huffed, rolling his eyes wildly, throwing his newspaper aside.  “OK, OK, I’ll lighten up.  Sure, you can have all the spunk you want.  And while I’m at it, I might just go down to see if Molly needs any for experimental purposes.  Then I’ll go donate some to Mike – perhaps he needs some for some random experiment.  What about Lestrade?  Perhaps he has some investigation going where he needs-“
“I think I am,” John whispers.  “For being way too transparent.”  He pushes a handful of notes toward the front of the cab and looks at Sherlock.  “Come on, you.  Let’s get upstairs.  I want to unwrap my new boyfriend.”
Sherlock laughs and moves swiftly into John’s arms, snuggling in, and it feels more right to John than anything ever has before.  This man was meant to be in his arms, was meant to be his to cherish.  He’s abruptly overcome with affection and tenderness for this brilliant, vulnerable being.  A being who is squirming in his lap, driving him to distraction.  He tries to lay still and let Sherlock explore as he wishes but the wriggling of plump arse cheeks over his extremely neglected cock is too much to bear.  He grabs the lovely handfuls and squeezes and kneads until a moan erupts from his lover’s chest.  “John, please, there’s lube in the second drawer.  Please put it to good use.”
The drumming had been an at least twice-daily occurrence since new neighbours had moved in two weeks ago.  It was annoying, to be sure, but it seemed to bother Sherlock more than himself.  He was working on tuning it out, although as he’d said, the playing was quite good.  It’s just that, in his opinion, it would be a bit less like banging and more like music with a couple of other instruments participating.  If he couldn’t talk Sherlock around somehow he was going to have to resort to slipping earplugs in when he was distracted, or possibly slip on the ear hat.
Sometimes John has trouble getting his little dumpling to communicate with him during sex. Sometimes Sherlock’s brain has trouble shutting down for pleasure. Over time John has formulated
After a bit of banging about again, Sherlock had the swing set-up over the spa.  He showed an incredulous John the extra long sling he’d made that would hang below the level of the frame and into the water below.  John blanched a bit when he saw how many toys Sherlock had stacked up in the sports bag at the spa edge – how much bloody money did he spend! - but when he looked over at the open excitement on his sweetheart’s face he knew he couldn’t deny him.
“Listen, stop pacing and come back here,” John held out his hand toward Sherlock in a beseeching manner, hoping his pouting-John look would return him to his former position, and for a moment John thought he’d succeeded.  Sherlock dropped to his knees between John’s legs and grabbed both his hands and yanked.  Twice.
John pushed open the door and gestured for Sherlock to precede him.  “Ah I think I’ll stay out here for a bit, John”
Sherlock came in from the hallway, bits of silicon hanging from his curls like sections of Shelob’s web.  He swiped the back of a hand across his brow and a blob of ooze dropped onto his eyelid, sealing his eyelashes together.  “I’m having a bit of trouble, John”
Sherlock continued his ministrations to John’s behind, relaxing him as the warm water bubbled around them.  He closed his eyes and slumped back into the cradle, thrusting up onto fingers, curling his head aside to invite nibbles to his neck.  Oh he felt sooo good.  Sherlock backed off for a moment, and then he could feel something other than fingers stretching him open.  It was snug but not too big, giving only the tiniest burn momentarily.  He relaxed, allowing it to be pressed in and out of him without resistance.
“If it were anyone else I would stick it together with superglue and call it a day. But you're a bit of a health and safety hazard.” Sherlock shot John a pointed look but nodded, indicating for him to continue.
“And in London- all over the place really. Last week in the clinic I had to do the same thing to a five-year-old who hit their head on the side of a coffee table. He was better at staying still.” Sherlock arched a brow in indignation but otherwise ignored the jab.
To hone one’s deductive skills one must also interact with the scientific method. Today I shall be focusing on the elements of hypothesis and experimentation. Instead of using an inane example like the ones displayed in scientific textbooks for high school students, I shall instead detail a simple, on-going experiment involving my flatmate John Watson and his alarming consumption of tea.
After some reflection, I can confirm my supposition that attempting to further our relationship would be disagreeable as I now understand my desire to avoid romantic relationships doesn’t strictly apply to John. As I understand he doesn’t have the same inclinations as I do, I believe it would be best for the both of us to reestablish our old boundaries.
I’m aware, on occasion he reads my blog as he gives me feedback about how I need to use less technical terminology and theories in my writing to appeal to the masses and discuss our personal matters less. By discussing our personal matters so openly I’m hoping to goad him out of his childish temper tantrum and back to Baker Street.
The man had been having an affair with one of his female coworkers. He had been planning to divorce his wife for some time and had been hoarding away money beneath their mattress, hoping for the wife to remain unaware of the money. That way, if a divorce lawyer were to insist the wife keep half of the money within their shared bank account the husband would still leave the divorce with more than half of their earnings.
Sherlock hummed in agreeance, happy to fall back into their comfortable post-case patterns of eating takeout in their respective chairs and talking about the case. However, on that night the eclipsing smile never left John’s face and Sherlock had fumbled over his explanations because of it.
Sherlock had smelled the blood before he saw it, the acrid, sweet stench of iron. He placed a hand on his temple, unsurprised when he felt it sticky with blood.
I admitted to him that I needed to sleep, unsure of how he would respond. I waited for him to object. He didn’t. He became quiet for so long I had begun to drift off but he startled me awake by saying my name again.
Since we met, I’ve found myself preferring to be close to John and I believe the feeling is mutual. He is steadfast and grounding. When entering a crime scene the sheer amount of information (and stupidity) can be overwhelming. John is a good touchstone. The casual bumping of shoulders has always been welcome. He is also receptive to retrieving things from my pockets when my hands are full or I can’t be bothered with the mundanity of it.
When it came to falling in love, Sherlock Holmes cared less about the ‘how’ and more about the ‘when’. He understood basic neurochemistry. It was a simple reaction of hormones, neurons, and receptors. He had thought himself to be above such base human drives. Regrettably, his emotions always were his weakness.
The toxicology reports suggested the man had ingested a fatal dose of arsenic less than half an hour before his death. Further investigation revealed the food left on the table also had traces of arsenic. If the man hadn’t bled to death, he would likely have died due to the poisoning. Then why, one had to ask, had he been stabbed? Who goes to the trouble of hiding poison in food only to stab someone moments after? Also, why did each plate of food contain arsenic? Were there two more bodies to be found and if not, had the scene been set after the death of the body to confuse police? It truly was a beautiful crime scene.
’ to tell someone where you were going and what you were doing every moment of every day was pointless.
We have our own patterns and our own established boundaries but lately, I’ve found us crossing these lines. For this reason, I believe it is critical for me to determine where these boundaries lie and reestablish what is ‘okay,’ while maintaining our friendship. The two of us generally have more relaxed boundaries than what is commonly considered ‘average’.
John just shot the inspector a look I couldn’t see, which seemed to momentarily placate his worries. John squeezed my hand tighter. Upon reflection, I suppose I should have asked before holding John’s hand so publicly but I needed to show him what I was thinking. I pulled John along beside me, counting the steps out loud until we reached the opposite wall.
Out of frustration, I took his hand and pulled him close to my side making him match my own steps. This action had caught Inspector Lestrade’s eye and he gave John a puzzled and concerned look. Lestrade silently asked John a question John didn’t understand. I understood Lestrade’s look clearly but ignored him. He was asking if I was using again. Typical.
It was the rhythm tapped out by the client’s restless feet. It was a clue more valuable than anything which had left the client’s mouth. As John and myself are familiar with Morse Code, him from his military background, myself from the necessity of my own occupation, we were quick to translate it.
When possible I avoid working on any more than one case at a time. My methods of solving cases require me to become absorbed in the details of the matter. When working on two at once, my ideas get muddled and the high I get from the solution of the matter is dulled. When focusing on one case the details of it slowly become clear as I gather data. It can be likened to a spool of thread unfurling in a perfect line from beginning to end, inertia in action. Adding more thread just tangles things. I see connections where connections don’t exist. Apophenia has no place in the realm of logical thinking.
’ in the very loose sense of the definition as my disappearance was entirely purposeful and the only individual who truly deemed me to be
So, we showered together. John washed his hair while I huddled in a steam-filled corner of the shower and catalogued all the data the moment had to offer. John uses more conditioner than necessary, likes to shower with his back to the water, and has a small birthmark on his hip. All in all, it was an informative night.
It was too heartfelt. Of course, not as heartfelt and cliché as the three other words I considered. Those would make matters too concrete.
It only works when John is tired or distracted. Three is the average number of items I can hand John without him realising I’m conducting the experiment. Though, this average varies greatly depending on the object. The more commonplace an object such as a phone, set of keys or pens takes longer for John to detect. While unusual objects like a skull or pocket knife have a lower average of two items.
- depending upon who you asked. His mother argued the former, his father, the latter. When all was said and done, the diagnosis would be the same. Anti-social personality disorder. Others would come to use these terms when referring to him, obviously not understanding the diagnosis was one and the same. Those who were quick to point fingers often didn’t know what they were talking about.
When John is gone, I use the skull on my mantelpiece for a replacement but asking oneself questions is never as effective. Moreover, there are some questions that I cannot ask John, particularly those which concern him. This type of questioning just leads to more confusion than answers. Perhaps one day I shall discuss these questions with him.
It was surprising he hadn’t proposed the solution to the case, as sexual relationships are more his area than my own. Of course, I’m not naive when it comes to sex as it is often entangled with crime but my knowledge is far more theoretical, while John’s is practical. It would be interesting to pick his brain on the topic and lead my own line of questioning.
The biggest outlier within my experimentation to date came earlier this afternoon. John had worked a double shift at the clinic and arrived back home at 221B suitably sleep deprived. He had folded himself into his armchair, looking moments from lulling off to sleep when I extended my hand to him. After a moment of hesitation, I rubbed my forefinger against the palm of John’s hand.
I’ve never considered myself an addict. I’ve always been keenly in control of what I put into my body, for what means, and how much. My dabbling with cocaine has always been for the purpose of my work. There were instances in the past where I was required to stay awake for long periods of time to solve a case. Though I pride myself in my capability to withstand my body’s more base urges, after two sleepless days, the third is always difficult to muster without losing some of one’s mental faculties. Obviously, when working on a case, this is unacceptable. Cocaine was an easy solution. As it is a stimulant, it was able to keep me alert and functioning well past the time when I should have been able to do so.
Sometimes John can be surprisingly observant. Something on my face must have tipped him off as after he seemed to determine my intention or at the very least my concerns.
He asked me if I was okay. This adds additional evidence to the theory that John believes my affection is somehow connected with a vulnerable mental-state. However, this time he wasn’t wrong. I shook my head. I was frustrated, beyond frustrated and I was angry, so unbelievably angry. With my body hunched over and my face buried in John’s shoulder, I came to realise the person I was angry with was myself.
This morning, John woke around nine and found me at my microscope in the kitchen. He mumbled out a sleepy ‘morning,’ and turned on the kettle as was our usual routine. It was my time to break routine. I rose from my chair, strode over to John, and gave him a hug.
“Have I done something wrong?” I believe he had been asleep until the knocking woke him as John had mumbled none discreetly for a time before asking me to repeat myself.
The benchtop beneath Sherlock was cold but John’s hands were warm. The hold John had on Sherlock’s face was firm and steadfast as he cleaned the gash on Sherlock’s forehead. The pain was present but manageable. Sherlock had been through much worse. The addict in him proposed the pain could be eradicated entirely with a needle and spoon.
As expected, today there were no cases, at least, none of which required leaving the flat. It was insufferable. The sudden cold weather also caused the emergence of John’s most garish jumper. The only thing more annoying and distracting than the biting chill of single-digit temperatures was John’s blue and green striped sweater. If kindling is needed for the fireplace I know what I’ll use first.
The layout of the flat goes as follows: there was an open floor plan for the main room, kitchen, and dining area. Two large windows covered the west-facing wall while a sofa, full-length mirror, and squared kitchen were tucked together on the other side of the room. From the windows, the offices of the adjacent building could clearly be seen. There were no curtains or blinds on these windows. For all intents and purposes, the office workers in the other building should be able to see right into the flat.
Once the particulars of the case were explained we lapsed into a comfortable silence. John had yawned and shifted to sit beside me. At first, I was unsure of what he was doing, but of course, we had spent half of the night before awake and running around after ghosts. Neither of us had slept.
After my train journey back to London with John, I came to the revelation that it had been months since I slept as well as I had with him in that carriage. It only made sense that my mine went to heroin. Once an addict, always an addict.
“Right. How could I have missed that?” John spoke in a tone that dripped with sarcasm but his face, still smiling broadly, betrayed his voice.
Over my time undercover, I became close to one of the dockworkers and discovered they were using a fake name, with their real name exactly matching the initials inscribed on the lighter. I was remarkably glad this evidence came when it did as I was beginning to suspect the man wished to advance our relationship. Over the years, I’ve become remarkably adept at faking ordinary human relationships but when possible I avoid romance as they can be tedious and messy.
“You can’t just quote stuff at me Sherlock and expect me to get it. I can’t read your mind. Not with this. Explain it to me, walk me through it. I can tell you’re upset about something.”
It was not my first line of thought. I would have spent much more time on the case if it had not been for John’s line of questioning. Yes, I still would have solved the case upon talking to one of the victim’s partners as obvious guilt could be established in their body language, but it would have taken longer. Human emotions always were more John’s area. His line of questioning has been invaluable to me within many of the cases we have worked together.
Sherlock’s eyes pop open.  A slow smirk curls his lips and John has the feeling his life is about to change.  Is this what it feels like to be on the receiving end of Sherlock’s sexual attention?  As if the entirety of his colossal focus has zeroed-in on you, at the expense of everything else in the world?  As if he likes what he sees and is gearing up to pounce?  A frisson of unease rattles down John’s spine.  Reality drips in with the water, cooling his ardour.  This isn’t real.  Someone is probably watching them, and Sherlock is putting on one of his superb performances.  Summoning some grit, John clenches his jaw, pushes back a half step, looks Sherlock in the eye and dances on.
on his face.  He peered into his eyes and saw a sheen of moisture there and suddenly felt like the biggest heel on earth.
“John, I have been waiting and waiting for you to make a move.  To give me some kind of sign.  To ask me if I’m interested.  To-“ he interrupts himself.  “John, do you know how frustrating it is to suspect your attraction, read your micro-expressions, see your lustful thoughts, and yet month after month, no bloody move?”
feeling.  He hummed a few bars as he rocked and swung into the gorgeousness prostrated before him, and both of them got their reggae on, thinking
Sherlock shivered and trembled in his embrace.  John was feeling a little vulnerable himself.  It was as if the complete trust Sherlock had given him in the pool was still in effect and John was humbled.  He felt as if they were as intimate and open to each other as they’d ever been.
The weekend was a mishmash of heaven and hell.  Saturday morning had Sherlock convinced drummer boy had met a girl.
Startled, Sherlock jumped and wiggled said arse in John’s face. John nearly passed out from its juicy, bouncy perfection.
Sherlock starts to feel uncomfortable with what he’s done.  John was so wild for him last night, and so sweet this morning.  He really should make a call to stop Plan B.  The least he can do for his cutie is take the damn lesson.  Torn and undecided, the closer they get to their destination the more fidgety Sherlock becomes.
