“I believe I can offer you a compromise, Captain Rogers. I am generally forbidden from sharing information about Sir unprompted, but there is nothing in my protocols that prevents me from
“No.” Steve hadn’t been, researching Tony and sketching in his lab had taken up enough time, but he could see how boredom would come on fast if he didn’t have something else to work on. “But I like to keep busy.”
As soon as they’d finished eating, Bruce promised Tony he’d stop by his lab the next morning to play with biofuel cells, gave Steve a slightly less awkward wave goodnight, and slipped off to his own floor. Steve went exploring while Tony made himself an after dinner espresso--no wonder he didn’t sleep much--and wound up in a room that Tony called a “game room,” but which was bigger than any arcade Steve had seen. Tony appeared in the doorway while Steve was examining a space-themed pinball machine, his fingers looped together behind his back while he leaned in to look.
, Steve didn’t say. “What are you working on today?” he asked instead. Tony had drawn a battery design across two napkins and was diagramming the improvements he wanted to make on a third when a server arrived with their cheeseburgers. Steve asked enough follow-up questions to keep Tony talking throughout the meal. He was paying some attention to the conversation, but mostly he was watching Tony.
“Sure,” Tony said, looking at him warily. Steve gave him his most guileless expression back. When Tony gestured, one of the robots detached itself from the workbench and wheeled over to a side cabinet, then came back with a few sheets of graph paper and a ballpoint pen.
Steve blew out a slow breath and set the tablet aside. He hadn’t thought about Pepper until that morning. Tony hadn’t mentioned anything about their relationship during his visits to SHIELD, but Steve had known from SHIELD gossip that they were rumored to be involved. Knowing they weren’t anymore sent relief and guilt coursing through him: relief that Tony was unattached, that Steve wasn’t ruining someone else’s happiness by taking comfort where he could, and guilt that he was happy about someone else’s unhappiness.
Peep gave a confused whirr as Steve carefully plucked the cloth and and spray bottle of cleaning solution from its grasp.
“You don’t say,” Tony said, with exaggerated surprise. “Why is that a problem? It’s an arcade game, competition is the point.” The pinball machine displayed a high-score board, “IRON MAN” filling all the slots. It was funny until Steve wondered how many games Tony had played by himself, alone in the giant room. Or maybe he was just really good at pinball.
When Steve got too obvious about studying him, Tony started to pat his face. “What, do I have crumbs in my beard?”
Tony had a glint in his eye that made Steve wonder if he had a desk in the workshop, but before he could respond, the workshop doors slid open and Bruce walked in, coming to a sudden stop when he saw Steve there.
Tony threw a french fry at him. Steve ducked sideways to snap it out of the air with his teeth.
He was also feeling increasingly silly about being wrapped in just a blanket as the mid-morning sun climbed the walls. Steve looked at his abandoned SHIELD-issued clothes with distaste. "JARVIS, is there a department store around here? I need new clothes."
“Who’s he, a porn star?” Tony asked. He flopped his head over the back of the couch and stared at the ceiling.
“Noted,” Tony said, and Steve was sure that a PROPERTY OF STARK INDUSTRIES shirt would appear in the near future.
“Because of what we talked about earlier?" Steve said, stomach sinking. He’d noticed that about his own nightmares. If he read something about the war, he’d dream about the trenches that night, no matter how dry and academic the text was.
Obviously Tony was fine. He’d just seen Tony at lunch, he was
“You caught me.” Tony scrubbed his fingers on a napkin and let his eyes linger on Steve’s lips a little too long to be casual. Steve was newly conscious of the background chatter of people around them; Tony’s employees, who would presumably notice and have opinions about it if Tony kissed a man in the middle of the cafeteria. And if anyone recognized Steve, they would see Tony kissing
“When I was helping Buck’s Ma make dinner. She was from Indiana. She hated the corn we got in the city, always said it was mealy, but she bought it anyway when she could find it.” Steve lifted his feet when Tony took his pants down to his ankles. Tony tugged his socks off at the same time, leaving Steve in just his new undershorts. “When did you, Manhattan?”
There were other signs of habitation, once Steve looked for them. One of the two throw pillows on the room’s other couch was worn down in the middle. A rack of tools, from screwdrivers to spanners to things Steve couldn't identify, was mounted on the wall like a sculpture, but the tools showed signs of use: tiny nicks in the screwdriver tips, worn edges in the handles. There were no magazines, but Steve found a sheet of glass in a drawer that revealed itself as a tablet as soon as Steve touched it.
want to see Tony. If Tony didn’t want to be seen, he could say no, but this way he would at least know that Steve wanted to look. The urge had been building since their conversation in the workshop. The arc reactor and whatever scars surrounded it weren’t something Steve would shy away from, and the sooner Tony learned that, the better.
“Are you going to burn them?”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, voice casual. “You know the story anyway. It’s not like it’ll be a surprise.”
A browser window popped up on the tablet, displacing the painting program. Steve thought about where he’d done his previous research and typed in “Tony Stark Wikipedia.” When the familiar article loaded, it was covered in yellow annotations, everything from corrected dates to much more editorial comments:
Tony blinked. “What?”
Blinking slowly, Steve’s eyes refocused on Tony. He took a moment to answer, seeming lost in thought. “Do you…remember the first time we did this?”
“Hm.” Fury steepled his fingers, giving both Steve and Tony a beady-eyed look. “I assume you’re meeting with them tomorrow?”
“I told the Malnussians that you were involved,” Thor admitted. “As in…” He lifted his hands, miming an act that if one squinted could probably be sex. “They were most relieved to hear that there would be a pair suitable to speak with them.”
The tour had included a look at the Malnussian’s medical bay, which didn’t look anything like
This wasn’t the first time Tony had to sleep away from home for business related reasons (disregarding the

seeing that look on Steve’s face. (And loved being the one to
“Hey.” Rhodey waved, getting Barton’s attention.
“Tomorrow,” Tony said, rather pleased at the surprised expression that crossed Steve’s face.
The others were trickling in as Tony joined Steve outside. Clint looked the sleepiest, with pink marks on his face from his pillow, bed hair, and eyes still half-shut. Bruce probably hadn’t even slept (not that Tony could judge as he hadn’t slept either).
Steve didn’t seem appalled, laughing and giving Tony a bright grin that had his heart fluttering. “I’d date that, too,” he agreed. He stepped closer, reaching out to take Tony’s other hand. “I’d…definitely date that. Although I think we’ve been dating for months now.”
If Tony slept on that couch, he was going to wake up grumpy
And then, while Tony watched, Clint somehow drove completely off the road on the only track in that map and…ended up in space?
At least villains couldn’t see the trackers and immediately go “ooh, we can get an Iron Man suit!” Not that it’d work even if they did get their hands on the bracelets. The suits were designed to self-destruct if anyone other than him or Rhodey were in them.
“I love you,” Steve blurted out. And then his voice stuck in his throat and he couldn’t get anything else out.
It was one night.
Steve shot him a sidelong look, smiling lopsidedly. “I’ll get right on that.”
Of course, at this point everyone thought he and Steve were in a relationship. Why on earth would they think that they hadn’t been able to get along?
“Good talk, buddy,” Barton said to his back. “Say hi to the love child of Captain America and Iron Man for me!”
“But you are the paired leaders for planet Earth, yes?” This seemed a supremely important piece of information for A’gel’fush, the tip of their antennas becoming slightly pale. It could be agitation, but Tony didn’t know enough of the aliens’ biology to know for sure. The translator’s monotone voice didn’t help, and Tony couldn’t tell if body language was the same between humans and the Malnussians.
Tony’s laugh was closer to a sob. “This better not be because there’s mistletoe over us.”
Tony would definitely date Steve. Holy shit, Tony would date the
“How about you, big guy?” Tony tilted his head in the direction of the festivities. He restrained a wince upon seeing Carol “accidentally” shove a pie into Hank’s face.
It had gotten him to this point after years of dancing around, and he could be patient a little while longer.
“You could have. I was a sure bet.”
Tony opened a drawer and tossed a brightly colored wrapper in Rogers’s direction without batting an eye. “I told him not to be shy if he understands or doesn’t understand something,” he told Rhodey sotto voce. “He gets a piece of candy every time he lets me know.”
“You know I had him, right?” Tony griped, dropping his helmet off to the side. His hair stuck to his forehead, damp with sweat.
Tony returned the smile, folding his arms. “Tradition, huh?”
“It’s like we were made for each other,” Tony continued, immediately wincing at his lack of brain-to-mouth filter. He hastily rushed to add, “So I’ll leave you to take a shower. In the…cubicle that does actually look like a shower.”
“Why are you talking to
“Keep apologizing like that and I’m going to start thinking you don’t like me,” Tony said teasingly.

“I just wish you’d take better care of yourself,” Steve muttered once they were alone. “That’s all, Tony.”
“I didn’t know.” Steve’s laugh was wry. “You were so – so
They should probably go out and finish up their negotiations so they could go back home and enjoy their new relationship in peace and quiet (or not so much quiet because the rest of the team was there). But all Tony wanted to do right now was just cuddle with Steve.
giving me everything,” he corrected himself. “I want to give you the same.”
Steve bit the inside of his mouth, pulling in a breath. “Let’s not do that again at all, okay? I…I couldn’t handle seeing that before, and I definitely can’t handle seeing that
“I knew there was a but in this,” Tony said.
But he knew what Steve meant, and the answer would always be—
, okay? I mean, you probably know how Tony is by now, right?”
Stopping dead, Rhodey took a solid minute to understand who the second person was that Tony was
Something flickered across Steve’s face that he wasn’t sure how to interpret. Only a second later, Steve returned Tony’s smile with a rather strained one.
“It shouldn’t,” Tony agreed quietly, squeezing Steve’s elbow gently, forcing himself to not react to Steve casually admitting he wasn’t straight. (He
that he was dating someone.”
It looked like it was a rousing success, but the night was still early.
“Oh, that…ah…” Tony wasn’t blushing, but his face felt far too hot. “Yeah?”
“No,” Tony said defensively, taking a bite of eggs. “Steve does. We’re friends now,” he added more slowly.
“I am also not a fortune teller, sir, but I can predict with relatively good certainty that things shall not turn out as dire as you think.”
doesn’t like taking phone calls.”
wanted to go back home and not have to worry about pretending to be in a romantic relationship with Steve. Unfortunately, the Malnussians were somewhere in the orbit of Uranus, and the only reason Steve and Tony were here instead of somewhere still in outer space on whatever spaceship Tony would have thrown together was because of the Bifrost.
cooked because he had heard of the infamous apology omelet.
He could muddle through this.
Now…now was the first time that commitment was being put into action.
“Steve?” Tony mumbled as soon as he was able.
A sweet grin stretched Steve’s lips, his eyes crinkling. It was a look that transformed Steve’s face, and Tony had never before realized just how much he

“I don’t think it counts if we didn’t notice.”
looking to him for support and expecting him to be
“Right,” Tony muttered as Rhodey walked away. “Because…we’re…dating…?”
Steve refused to budge because it
“Probably because he doesn’t want me to know. I asked him this morning and he says they’re friends.” Rhodey paused, giving Barton a pointed look. “They were sleeping on top of each other.”
“I’m not nearly beige enough,” Rogers said, clearly shamelessly eavesdropping.
It was something that still boggled Rhodey’s mind when he thought about it. He loved Tony, but it was the kind of love borne of years of knowing the man. Rhodey had known Tony since he was a shrimpy adolescent boy at MIT who got in way over his head with his brain. It didn’t mean that Tony aggravated him any less, and Rhodey was very well aware of Tony’s many faults. One of which being that Tony did
Coughing, Tony stepped into the room, giving an unsurprised Natasha a nod. “Having fun?” He walked over to Bruce to wake him up, poking him a few times in the forehead. “Hey, I thought we agreed no naps in the day. It just makes you grumpy.”
Tony pressed his fingers together tightly where he had them laced behind his back, sudden, visceral panic making his heart race. “Yeah, we can. You sure everything’s fine? You’re going to give me a complex at this rate.”
“Seeing as how we’re still putting together the city from the last time, let’s hope not.”
Steve looked far too innocent, putting his controller back into its box along with Clint’s.
His effort paid off a few seconds later when Tony shrugged and plopped down on the couch, tossing the remote at him. “All right. But it’s definitely my turn next time.”
“I will.” And rather than say what he wanted –
Shaking his head, Tony checked the trackers in his arms to be sure that they were tuned to the right suit. Despite initial bugs and the sad death of Mark XLII in an unfortunate explosion during one of their villain fights (that suit had been buggy as hell from the get-go but Tony had been too fond of it to scrap it after he’d developed XLIII), the trackers were more convenient than putting on the bracelets.
“Better neither of us, Shellhead.” Steve pulled his cowl off and leaned in to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “That’s what we’ve got the team for. We could’ve figured something out that didn’t involve you being electrocuted.”
Glancing over to see their hosts occupied with greeting each other, Tony sidled over to Steve, lowering his voice to ask, “All okay? There wasn’t any trouble, was there?”
“I changed my mind,” Tony said quickly. “We were dating, we were definitely dating before. We went on so many dates. You can kiss me.”
“The last time you were asked to flirt with someone as a distraction you said something about it being a very nice day and then started talking to them about what drinks at the bar were any good.”
“Because no one wanted to admit gays existed or because guys were more touchy-feely?”
days ago – that we were only friends. That you were fine with that. Now…you’re…not?” (Had it only been three days? It felt like an eternity.)
Nodding slowly, Steve’s eyes fell to the table between them, worrying his lower lip as he thought. “We’re friends,” he said eventually, firmly. “I think I can see how others might think we’re dating, but that doesn’t matter so long as we know what’s going on, right?”
It had only been one night…and Tony wanted more.
His response was an unrepentant grin, along with another kiss closer to his mouth. “Hey.”
Steve pulled back, smile nervous. “Mistletoe.”
(“It took him three hours, Rhodey!
“Thor informed us of your abilities with technology,” K’salk’adi had said. “I assume you would be interested?”
“Sounds like the start of a porno,” Clint muttered, just a shade too loudly. Tony glanced over to see if he had his aids in, relieved to see he did. Tony was passable with ASL now but not fluent; Natasha the only one who could translate quickly enough for Clint.
“I like that.”
“Who’s the one who keeps getting caught with his pants down?”
“It doesn’t have your name on it,” Rhodey said, dumping creamer and a small spoon of sugar into the mug.
“You don’t need an excuse to kiss me, you know that.”
The warm body in his arms didn’t feel like Pepper as Pepper wasn’t this muscular and didn’t quite smell this way either.
Iron Man was the best of him, but Iron Man was an ideal. A suit. Tony put it on because he had something to do, something to achieve that he couldn’t otherwise. He’d used it for a few irresponsible things (like throwing terrible birthday parties) but that was in the past. Tony wouldn’t do that now (not with his
Tony didn’t seem any more comprehending than before. “
“Steve?” Tony blinked, glancing over at Rogers, who had a bulging cheek where he was sucking on the candy Tony had tossed him. …That drew up a mental image Rhodey 100% did not need, thanks very much. “I’m…not sure.”
Steve stepped hastily back to the center of the room, suddenly dizzy - probably from the height.
"And you're
"Textbooks?" New York's other genius billionaire playboy philanthropist asked with a lift of his eyebrow.
"Then why tell me at all?" He quivered at the thought that she trusted him.
"He doesn't like me any more than he likes you," Tony groaned, slouching in his seat like a kid who'd been given extra homework.
Xanatos threw his head back and laughed at that one.
Taking a moment to let his confession sink in, Maza relaxed, even smiled faintly in understanding.
"I don't know. It sounds like it would be safer to just let her keep it ..."
"Genetic engineering?" Tony demanded, hot on the other man's heels, pulling his helmet off to better scowl disapprovingly. "Was Goliath human once or did you start from scratch? Don't you dare tell me you hired Sevarius back!"
"Pepper opens my mail."
"Fury threatened to kick him off the team."
Steve came inside him almost casually, then pulled out and knelt beside the bed. When he started giving
"You went to the tower last night?" Tony asked early the next morning over some very awkward ham and eggs. "Did you talk to Xanatos?"
"My best friend used to call me his pretty little housewife when I was my old self, but I hardly think I'm that way anymore ..."
"I'll do it ... just leave Steve out of this." Tony straightened his back and turned to go.
"Well you're a terrible spy, then."
"Yes, he had a prior engagement, but he sends his regards."
Down in the lab, Tony stared at the plans for his latest gadget ("The StarkLazor: Never buy razor blades again!") - but couldn't bring himself to ponder the problem of making it painless; he had way too much on his mind and not nearly enough on his stomach.
, he groaned internally.
Tony flopped down gracelessly into the empty chair. He'd not bothered to dress up, wearing jeans, a hoodie, and an AC/DC t-shirt, backlit by the arc reactor.
"Nothing yet, but Xanatos took over the arms market when Tony bought out of it. He's got deep corporate footholds in every field of science, and SHIELD just wants to know what he could possibly want with a thousand-year-old Scottish castle."
Steve rather hoped that a piece of mail which was neither bill nor subpoena would perk Tony up. His friend had been edgy for months, shunning all the Avengers, even his lab partner, snapping at Pepper and Happy and flat out refusing to speak to Fury. Tony wasn't even drinking very much, which had to be a sure sign of something.
Steve laughed softly, nodding his head.
?!” Her Scoville reading was off the chart.
there?"
And indeed, at its head knelt a great stone beast, calmly watching all that transpired below him ... almost as if he was waiting for something.
"Well ... This happen often?" He asked, voice almost cracking.
Tony's wariness wore down in the face of their bent heads and obvious contrition. He could save his worrying for Goliath and the bearded one (and maybe the dog); these three were nothing but kids ... scared kids who knew less about this world than even Steve did.
"Good. Something tells me he gets a kick out of a little power imbalance. Just be yourself and
They both cried out when Steve, already hard again and dripping, plunged back in. He bent down to kiss between Tony’s shoulder blades, his passionate pace never slowing.
Morning light streamed serenely into the lab, making the chaos look downright cozy. Dummy zoomed around with a pushbroom. Steve righted tables and lifted boxes. Tony sorted through the papers and bits that Dummy piled at his feet.
Tony stood up angrily, one hand slamming on the table and the other pointing a commanding finger at the other man.
“It really, really was. It was, like,
“Well, we were all in the Tower lounge ... until everyone else left. We got to talking about how we’d misjudged each other … Then he kissed me. In his defense, I don’t think he even knew you and I were dating. I should have told him then and there. Please don’t be mad at him.”
"Somehow I fear that would turn into something less than innocent ..."
"He's amazing, he's curated a magnificent collection of historic art, created hundreds of construction jobs, knows interesting, smart people ... he's funny and charismatic." Steve knew he was gushing, but he just couldn't help himself. He was genuinely impressed with everything he'd seen so far. It only made him want to see more.
"Sorry, Detective, but I have to ask Mr. Xanatos a few questions." With a curt nod and set shoulders he entered.
"That's amazing!" it exclaimed, reaching out and touching Tony's arm. "Are you a knight?" Its voice was friendly and light, its claws reverently tracing over metal contours and hair-width seams.
Steve stood, too, only now realizing that he hadn't tried to squeeze the detective for anything she'd uncovered.
There was only one person he could talk to anymore.
Steve screeched up to the Eyrie building in a black Acura he'd "borrowed" from the tower garage. He was sure Tony wouldn't mind (either that or he was sure Tony
"She's the one who said you
"All the more reason to keep more than one set of eyes on him, Tony. I never said I trusted him," he huffed, keeping an eye on his cooking. In truth he didn't know if he could meet Tony's eyes. "Look, I understand you have some kind of history with him." Steve turned with a look that said, 'like you have a lot of history with a lot of people.' "But you've got to trust me too. I can handle myself and my own missions."
"I didn't know you had such a dirty mind," laughed Xanatos, promptly proving Steve right by wrapping his mouth around a slender green stalk and savoring the head with a little 'mmm' of approval. "We have more in common than I realized."
"I'll suck your cock if it means you'll dump Steve."
"Maybe I just wanted an excuse to invite you over. Come on, Tony, tell the truth. You missed me, didn't you?"
"Cap?"
sucks cock before I dump him."
"I don't think so. You can take over this investigation when you take over the clean up, but for now it's ours."
"Then hurry up and pack."
"You talk a lot about Anthony, Mr. Xanatos ... I wonder if he realizes how much you really miss him," he mused with a genuine smile before glancing down a bit to start cutting up his meal. He sort of wished he had someone who thought of him as much in this era.
Sighing, Tony left the workshop to seek out Steve.
“I had a question,” Rhodey said when Barton said nothing more. He sat down on the couch, a cushion’s space between them. “It’s about Tony and Rogers.”
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve said again when he joined Tony on the couch, slinging an arm around his shoulders.
“Group of superheroes who handle what other folks can’t,” Clint agreed. “Which is why we ended up fighting a mutant horde of mosquitoes last month that an over caffeinated grad student cooked up in his lab.”
From there it had turned into more outings, Tony dragging Steve to tech conferences and some of his university lectures and Steve retaliating with
Heat flushed through Tony from all their points of contact. He was acutely aware of how their lips moved together, Steve’s hair under his fingers, Steve’s hands at his waist, and where their chests were pressed together. He spared a brief thought for the arc reactor digging into Steve’s skin but it was quickly forgotten when Steve shifted his head slightly and used the slight height difference to angle Tony’s head back.
“He tends to do that,” Tony said. “I wouldn’t take it personally at this point. I think it comes of being a prince…”
“What?” Barton looked defensive.
“Am I dead? If I’m not dead, then it hasn’t happened before.”
Tony smiled, shifting his eggnog glass to his other hand so he loop his own arm around Steve. He looked up in time to catch young Sam sneaking off with an entire plate of what looked like Jarvis’s special cookies. Miles was right behind him.
(One had Rhodey in the background with a rather disapproving expression and a story proclaiming him to be a disapproving friend who thought the relationship was going to go down in flames because Tony was luring Rogers to the dark side. Rhodey couldn’t remember giving a statement to that paper and sicced JARVIS on the publication with no regrets.)
“Hm?” Tony roused himself enough to pay attention to Steve. “What?”
“You’ll have to tell me about it later.” Tony leaned his elbows on the backrest of the couch, sliding his feet back to make himself more comfortable. “I got news from Fury as apparently
He viciously bit into his blueberry bagel, tapping a finger against his steaming coffee cup.
Steve still heard him. “I didn’t want to lose what I already had. But then I almost lost it anyway, and I couldn’t stand knowing that you almost
But that was then. Now…now Tony couldn’t quite map out the trajectory that had led to their current relationship.
Rhodey sighed, rolling his shoulders and picking up his pace as he walked over to the couch. He opened his mouth to wake Tony up, intending to say something along the lines of, “You know you’re not twenty anymore, Tones” when he realized that Tony wasn’t the only person on the couch.
“I didn’t think about it,” Steve admitted. “What we fell into was so easy…” He shrugged. “I didn’t realize what other people thought of it until you told me what Rhodey said. And then I got to thinking…”
your wardrobe, Steve,
” Fury’s voice was without any sign of whatever situation had driven him to call Tony. “
Fireworks went off in Tony’s brain, even as the rest of him whirled in confusion and his hands fluttered uselessly (because what? This didn’t make
“Yeah, big guy,” Tony managed, taking his arms off Steve.
“Man, if I had to make a list, I’d be here all day and I definitely don’t have time for that.” Rhodey smiled wryly. “You guys really aren’t subtle. If you want to keep it on the down low, maybe stop going out as much? Or cuddle less? Have less inside jokes? Hang out less?” He paused. “No, nix the last one. He makes you happy, Tony. I’m still not sold on whether Rogers deserves to have you but
. He loves you. He said it himself.” Granted, Tony had been talking in his sleep, but there weren’t many ways to misconstrue “I love you, Steve” even when the speaker was asleep.
Tony could honestly admit that he hadn’t taken it well. Which meant that he’d rooted through his alcohol and decided the solution was to get horrendously drunk. Clint joined in, as did Thor (although the god had brought his own version of alcohol after downing five bottles without getting slightly tipsy).
He pressed his hands to the sides of the toilet, peered into it to make sure that he wasn’t missing something, and then turned to Steve. “I wouldn’t suggest sitting down on it, but it should function like how we’re used to. But as for number two…”
Now they were sitting in a bagel shop and Tony was reevaluating all his life choices that had led him to this moment in time where even his closest friend thought that Tony Stark was dating Steve Rogers and didn’t think that was the funniest joke ever.
The pods were highly intimidating.
“My access to their databases suggests that it is indeed urgent.”
“I’ll do that.”
Mistletoe?
“Jury’s out on that,” Rhodey said. “I’ve got a few days here. Maybe I’ll see about spending some time with him. See if he’s got what it takes to be in a relationship with Tony.”
Steve hoped his tone didn’t sound as incredulous as he felt. “Your metal suit is protected against electricity.”
“If you do not tell them, I do not think there is anything to fear,” Thor offered, giving the two of them a scrutinizing look. “If you had not told me, I would not have believed otherwise.” He paused, then added, “I still do not believe you. Are you certain you are well? There have been no arguments? Are you in hiding?” He looked concerned now. “I know that your world can be intolerant of those who are different, but you need not hide from us here! We are your shield-brothers; there is no judgment from us.”
It…made him out to be rather stupid. Insecure. Like he was seeking validation and boosting for his ego.
Steve took a moment before responding, picking the words carefully. “Can’t I be happy that I’m in a relationship?”
“My friends!” Thor beamed at all of them. “I have news!”
“He didn’t have any other news?” Steve asked. “Where’s Thor meeting them?”
subtle.
“What’s…up with Tony and Rogers?” Rhodey was doubting S.H.I.E.L.D.’s recruitment tactics.
“Steve, I…” Tony blinked, dazed. He had to be dreaming, right? This wasn’t happening.
“Oh, Tony.” Steve drew back, bringing a hand up to stroke the back of his fingers along the side of Tony’s face. “Don’t you know? It was always you.”
“Difficult to miss,” Barton said blandly. “You really don’t like Nat.”
And Jarvis’s eggnog was much better without a straw.
“Steve,” Tony repeated, like an idiot with no idea what to say.
“You’ve got the suit, I’ve got the serum.” Steve stepped forward, touching the back of Tony’s neck. He regretted not taking his gloves off when he’d had the chance. “And most of your circuits seem to be fried.”
wanted to say something and Tony doubted he’d like whatever it was.
Steve didn’t speak for a while, his breathing slow and steady like a metronome.
Fury studied them for a moment longer before relaxing, leaning back in his chair. “You couldn’t have come out a week later? I owe Hill twenty.”
“I know,” Steve said, meeting Tony’s eyes. “I know you’re real busy, so that you’re still here – that you put this together for us every year – it means a lot.” He paused, hands going to his waist belt; Tony suspected if he had pockets in the uniform he would have used those. “You know,” he started slowly, haltingly, “I was always a little…disappointed that Mr. Stark was never there. Because he would arrange the parties, but then he’d never be there. I wanted to thank him for everything, but he never showed.” His smile was wry. “But Iron Man did.”
“I’ll be right back.” Steve shot Tony a look, fingers digging into Tony’s hip briefly before he let go. “Stay here?”
Steve studied Tony for a long moment, eyes searching. He slowly nodded, giving a small smile and reaching up to squeeze Tony’s elbow gently.
“Hey!” Steve sounded offended. “I do fine with undercover work!”
about this? Since, y’know, I’m volatile and don’t play well with others…”
“You’re not about to drink a motor oil smoothie because you’re not paying attention,” Steve said, looking rather uncomfortable with the current line of questioning.
it; it didn’t make it any less true. “We already worked well together before,” he continued. “But after that… It just made things click.”
, and that was definitely not what Tony had been going for.
The Malnussians didn’t have the same sleep cycle as humans but they did need to sleep and they had bedrooms that were suited for humans because of their humanoid physiologies. (Though Tony was curious about their spines. Did they have the same spinal problems humans did?)
There were also the outings. Rhodey tagged along on one but felt like such a third wheel that he eventually ended up just texting Pepper and Happy a series of emoticons and exclamation points while watching Rogers drag Tony through an
“I was standing in front of it.”
“How did you and he fall in love?” K’salk’adi asked.
“Not that you’d sic it on Tony, would you?” Clint muttered. “Not with
They’d wasted so much time, and Tony didn’t like to linger on that. It was difficult to believe that he
Although the outfit was all Cap, Tony had the feeling it was Steve Rogers facing him.
“S’okay,” Barton said. “We don’t do our jobs to be liked. Tony likes her well enough, but I can tell he’s still a little leery.”
Steve shot Tony an indiscernible look. “I didn’t think we were dating,” he said slowly. “I thought…we’re friends, right?”
“What’s up with me and Steve?” Tony parroted, pulling his plate closer to himself. He put an arm in front of it. As if that would stop Rhodey if he were truly determined.
“Nothing has to change, right?” Tony asked abruptly, glancing down at Steve.
Last night had been more than an incident of two friends accidentally falling asleep while watching TV.
Tony turned his head enough that he could get a vague glimpse of Steve’s profile, but it wasn’t like he could make anything out from the shape of Steve’s hair.
Tony forced himself to keep his breathing even despite the increasing pressure in his chest. All drowsiness was long gone. “Change to what, Steve?”
“You had Sharon,” Tony said.
“Aw nooo,” Clint moaned, shaking his controller. “This is the third time!”
“I’m not sure how this toilet works,” Steve said from the bathroom, “and I’m not sure I want to know. But I think we can use it?”
Steve groaned. “That’s not the point, Tony.”
He’d said what he wanted, and he knew it would be fine now.
Thankfully no one had commented on the distinct lack of alcoholic beverages this year. Tony wasn’t sure what he would have done if they had beyond shrugging loosely and pretending it didn’t bother him.
“Hey,” Tony said once he managed to rub it off, giving the offender a mildly reproving glare.
Despite the heavy lurch in his heart, Tony couldn’t help but laugh. “You have a one-track mind, Rogers. Let’s satisfy that bagel craving, hm?”
“Anything that puts that look on your face should be forgotten,” Steve said.
“We should bring S.H.I.E.L.D. into this,” Steve said, reaching up to squeeze Tony’s shoulder comfortingly. “They’ve got resources we don’t, and they’re supposed to handle these types of situations. We’re a line of defense, Thor.”
“Well, I can’t help it, can I?” Steve’s grin crinkled his eyes, and he ducked in to press his nose to Tony’s temple. “My best guy’s standing here, looking all happy…”
Not that Tony was complaining. He’d been going for a loud party when putting it together. It was perfect after all the chaos and pain of the last so many months (
Thor looked between Tony and Steve, grinning broadly. “You do, my friends!”
Oh God.

“Yes.” Steve’s expression morphed into one Tony was keenly familiar with and which was entirely out of place in a party. It would be more fitting for a fight, and Steve didn’t

He was going to see Steve’s bed head, wasn’t he?
Tony backed out of the bathroom before he could say anything else incriminating, sitting down heavily on the bed. The soft, squishy pillow-like substance of the mattress depressed alarmingly under his weight but held.
“Barton, do…you not have your aids in?” Rhodey reached up to tap his ears.
Tony blinked, stilling his movements. “Wait, aliens?
“I don’t want to ruin this,” Tony said finally, voice a whisper.
“It’s not false, though, is it?” Steve asked, shrugging. “You said platonic is fine, right? Tony and I are good friends, so it should work out.”
Tony nodded again, giving a lopsided smile and ignoring how his heart wrenched in his chest. “Rhodey does, anyway. Not sure about the rest of the team.”
“This is weird, isn’t it?” Steve let out a low laugh that sounded vaguely nervous.
Tony was working his usual magic, some of the holograms flickering too quickly for Rhodey to read. The ones that were still let Rhodey see that he was working on some suit modifications, some explosive compounds for arrowheads, and a stretchy kind of fabric.
Steve made a face. “No, they probably do, too. Ugh, this makes so much more sense.”
“Steve?” he managed, voice hoarse.
Only he hadn’t gotten any of them out because Rhodey had thrown him completely off guard. Tony hated being thrown off guard. He did his best to prevent that from happening in his daily life. His superhero activities threw enough curve balls at him that he didn’t want to deal with them in his regular life as well.
It was just sharing a bed with Steve, the man he would desperately like to date (and was probably a little bit in love with).
, as he had no idea what Steve was getting at here. His heart told that maybe, just maybe Steve was fishing for something
“Because
Because the Malnussians didn’t have mouths. No, they had something resembling mouths out of which something disconcertingly like clicking and hissing came out. Tony and Steve would have been lost if not for the translators they set up, conveniently tuned to Earth’s languages
It became instantly clear that Steve hadn’t done much kissing before. Which was fine, as Tony had done
“Being electrocuted was part of the plan?” Steve asked, annoyed. He was glad that the rest of the team had scattered after debriefing, clearly sensing there was going to be an argument.
– Steve reached down to take off the chest plate. Once it was gone, he stepped close and hugged Tony to him.
“He does,” Tony said cheerfully, as Thor was happy enough to concede leadership to Steve and even Tony on some matters, “he just doesn’t think you’re it.”
“Tony.” Great, now Steve was frowning.
, Tony, okay?” Steve snapped.
, etc. Also the man could…maybe not cook, but throw together a semblance of a meal with a recipe that JARVIS provided.
Banner seemed to be the main cook for the Avengers, something about the process being soothing for him, but he also used a shit ton of spices in his dishes. Rhodey didn’t mind them much, but he’d seen Tony chug down glasses of milk.
suit,” Rhodey said. “It’s still standing outside. I didn’t come here just for suit upgrades, Tony.”
It would have been adorable if Steve hadn’t been two hundred pounds of muscle who was currently pinning Tony in place on the squishy mattress.
“It distracted them, didn’t it?”
“Did you miss the part where neither of us are diplomats? I’m not sure my skills at pissing off board members will do any good here.”
Only kicking the blanket off did nothing because something was pinning his legs in place.
There wasn’t a chance Tony could hear it if he said it into his skin.
“Because it’s a nice, shiny gun? Besides, it’s what separates me from you. I don’t want people calling me Iron Man because the gun’s gone.”
Tony could definitely say it wasn’t him, but he knew who probably was at fault. He should give JARVIS an upgrade or some extra server space.
Tony shared a look with Steve, reading resignation in the other’s face. They’d had discussions on aliens before, Tony telling Steve what he had seen in the void when he’d carried that nuke through the portal. He’d told Steve there was more out there, that they were vulnerable to attack if they weren’t careful. That they had to be prepared in case the worst happened and another alien invasion occurred that they couldn’t stop.
Repressing a sigh, Steve slipped into his own stance.
“Great,” Tony said brightly. “I usually sleep on the right anyway.” Lies. He slept on the left, but he could definitely sleep on the right for now.
Fury scowled. “
Coffee didn’t help much but did make it a little less sticky.
“All right. I’ll trust that either Romanov or Barton will be there to provide backup should you need it. Or Thor, much good that he’s been.”
“Someone’s in a happy mood,” Tony said when they met up for training later that afternoon.
Right now he really did need to go.
“As if people would think Iron Man would go for the current color scheme you’re sporting.” Tony smirked. “What was it? Iron America? Cap and Iron Man’s love child?”
The usual modus of operandi with Tony and his workshop was that unless you needed something, you didn’t spend time in it. Doing so usually ended up being roped into shenanigans or having tools dropped on toes by a clumsy Dummy. Or, on one memorable occasion, being wiped down with an oily rag because Dummy’s camera had been smudged and he’d confused Rhodey with the suit fabricators that he’d been supposed to be cleaning.
“He does,” Barton said easily. “Anyone with eyes can see how crazy those two are about each other.”
“See, those are the kind of questions you could have asked him if you took phone calls.”
Okay, maybe Rhodey wouldn’t like to know
There was a low laugh from Steve that sounded fond. “That will definitely not be a problem.”
It wasn’t until later that Steve said
Steve didn't quite know what to say. They were neither grotesque nor lovely. Their presence was commanding, the artistry of their faces and outstretched claws evident. The fact that each edge was still sharp, each plane still smooth - not even the faintest whisper of a chisel mark - after a thousand years of neglect was astounding.
“I will find a way to kill you one of these days, y’know,” Tony growled, juggling the donuts as he extracted himself from his suit.
ignore me mid-crisis, but it hurt. A lot. I guess I’m just used to hearing her voice right before I almost die, like it’s what brings me back.”
Xanatos chuckled deep in his throat.

Huge thank you to Sheena, for getting me back on track and RPing most of this chap with me. I look forward to a gargoyle/'vengerific collaboration in the future :3
"Oh my god," 21 gasped, delighted and scandalized. "You've got a hatecrush!"
-------------------------
"Meeting him?" Tony seethed. "Have fun." And he got up and left.
bad at this kind of spywork? Or was he just that bad at dating?
"What happened ... between you and Tony?" Steve already had a vague notion of their story, stitched together from what few clues he'd been able to gather, but he wanted to hear it in plain English. He wanted to
----------------
Tony felt sick at the thought of eating, so he took his coffee to the jagged edge of the lounge. There the wind tore at him, and the now-risen sun glittered off the broken glass on the streets and sidewalks below.
"I'm not here for the art. I'm here to spy on you for SHIELD." Tony fought to keep his voice neutral, stuffed his hands in his pockets to keep from reaching toward a passing tray of chardonnay.
“What did you tell him afterward?”
Thor broke into a wide, unexpected grin.
"Have you lost your twisted little mind?"
Steve, in full dress uniform, slid out of the towncar and made his way to the lobby of the Eyrie Building. Passing beneath the facade he craned his neck for a glimpse at the new castle, but it was too far above to be discernable. That really was amazing. A castle in the clouds.
"Sorry, Officer ..."
--------
Steve cleared his throat, sweat breaking out on his brow.
Steve learned quickly that there was no bullshitting Detective Maza. He'd been expecting to have to throw some SHIELD weight behind their inward barge, but she handled Xanatos' valet wit a skeptical stonewall that would have made even Fury proud.
"Of course, sir."
Steve investigates. Tony broods.
"Screw him." The words felt surprisingly good rolling off Steve's tongue. He had no problem with Tony hiding his painful connection to Xanatos, he had no problem with Tony's leadership of the Avengers (most of the time), he had no problem with Tony's performance as a friend and fellow fighter ... but he had a

Unwilling to talk with his mouth full, Steve nodded.

“Not that I cheated, just that it was with

to see this. Her emphasis." Steve searched the tinted goggles and the set jaw for any hint of emotion but found none.
"It's not that he doesn't appreciate art ..." Steve could have gone on at great length in defense of Tony's taste, but he trailed off when they reached the windows, eyes going wide at just how high up they really were. He could see everything, even the tops of the clouds as they rolled in from the ocean. "It's beautiful." Off to one side stood Stark Tower, across a carpet of tiny buildings and green smudges of parks.
"I figure I'll just keep it simple. He can't be too much harder to handle than some
Xanatos heaved a sigh.
“You knew?”
"We were together for nearly ten years. We met at MIT, he helped me start my first business ... But I wanted to get married, and he didn't."
"No. If I'm getting dragged into this then I want to know what I may have to deal with." Getting angry in spite of himself, Steve finally whirled to face his friend.
"I ... admit that I don't know entirely ... But I feel that if I leave ... I'll regret it ..." he said sincerely, the pad of his thumb brushing over David's lower lip almost involuntarily.
There was nothing he could do.
"You have nothing to be sorry for. I'm the one who made assumptions, and I should have made my intentions known last night. You ... don't have to stay." Xanatos took a bracing gulp of wine and set his face in a hard expression of false bravery, built a wall between them. "I can call you a cab."
"No." The red one shook his head. "I don't think so."
"Ehhhhh ..."
"You'll speak with Renard?"
It was only back in the courtyard, when he felt unfamiliar eyes upon him, that he paused and tried to shake off the tension in his back and the worries in his mind.
"Let's go have a drink, shall we?" Xanatos was already turning toward a darkened arched doorway, smiling fondly as if Tony had said something kind.
“Of course not! They would see it as a mortal insult and inform others that we are not to be trusted.”
Natasha had been directed to a different room, as had Thor. The Malnussians’s spaceship was definitely large, and Tony would
“My memory’s failing,” Tony said, “what with not being able to remember your first Christmas with us.”
Then, before Steve could reconsider, Tony grabbed the back of Steve’s head and mashed their lips together.
“You picked the movie
“You enjoying the eggnog, Shellhead?”
Tony slid one hand down, curling one through Steve’s hair while the other moved down over Steve’s back, feeling out the muscle definition and the way Steve’s back flexed.
Tony leaned into Steve’s reassuring warmth, watching their friends enjoy themselves. Peter was on the ceiling, a camera in hands. Logan had skulked off to his own corner a while ago, probably with some beer. Jan was flitting around – sometimes literally – but currently pressed together with Kamala, young Sam, and Miles. Carol and Rhodey had disappeared some time ago, as had Luke and Jess. Sam was talking to Thor, who had taken off her helmet for the occasion; it was still strange to see Jane instead of the Thor Tony had known for years.
“Sure sounds like you’re a fortune teller,” Tony muttered. He sighed, throwing himself backwards onto his bed, spread-eagled. The ceiling offered him no answers to his dilemma.
“You’re my best friend,” Steve said, pressing his forehead to Tony’s. “But I want more, Tony.” His hands trembled. “If you’re willing to give it.”
“Which world leader gets the first shot at peaceful first contact?” Tony asked.
if you can believe that. Likes complaining about how all the houses look alike and so they should just pick one.”
That required a hell of a lot of trust if Tony was understanding K’salk’adi right. While one half of a paired leadership would discuss and set up treaties, the other half could do other activities to build up a strong relationship. Because of course Malnussians did everything together. (Earth nations would probably try and take this opportunity to stab each other in the back.)
better.)
“It happened slowly,” Tony said quietly, “and then all at once. One day I looked up and realized…I want this. I want this every day for the rest of our lives.” Never mind that it had only been scant days since Tony actually
“You should. Jarvis’s eggnog shouldn’t be wasted.” Tony resisted the urge to give Steve his glass, instead taking another sip through the straw. The modifications he’d made to this faceplate were paying off.
Once upon a time, Tony Stark had met Steve Rogers in person and told him everything special about him came out of a bottle. And Steve Rogers had told him he knew men worth ten of Tony and that he only fought for himself.
doing, Tony?”
“Indeed! The Malnussians are a grand race and greatly interested in joining with Earth.”
“I don’t think it counts.” Tony thumbed at the edge of Steve’s jaw. “It’s not really a bed, is it?”
“You—” Tony was blinking rapidly, sounding stunned. “Am I dreaming? Did someone stick me in a machine?”
get…”
Rhodey stared. “What?”
Rhodey covered his mouth with his coffee, refusing to give in. After a long drink that gave him the time to compose himself, he set his cup down, taking a seat across from Tony. “So…” He reached over to steal a piece of bacon from Tony’s plate, avoiding the fork that was jabbed in his direction. “What’s up with you and Rogers?”
“Paired leaders?”
“No, there’s judgment,” Clint said, yawning. “So much judgment.”
“More than once.”

Tony really wanted to ask if Fury was as sold on the relationship as everyone else but they’d agreed beforehand to keep that secret as close to the chest as possible.

Hopefully they wouldn’t be here that long.
Sometimes he thought Tony got a kick out of riling him up.
Three guesses for who the stretchy fabric was for and the first two don’t count.
No one had toppled over the twelve foot tall tree yet, and Tony was expecting something to happen to it. Maybe not destruction, but
“I love you,” Steve said. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I want to hold onto you. I can’t imagine fighting with anyone else by my side. I…hope you understand that.”
Tony couldn’t help but smile at Steve fondly, resting a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Trust me, Cap. Mr. Stark will be thrilled to know you’re enjoying yourself. He put this together for all of you.”
“What happened to you being ‘the man with a plan,’ Cap?” Clint smirked.
spy. Ex-Russian? Rhodey wasn’t sure what her nationality was these days, only that she was no longer working for Russia and he had no idea how damn old she was.
Outside of food, Tony and Rogers were practically always sitting next to each other when the team did activities such as watching movies and throwing popcorn at the screen. Rhodey had sat next to Tony once and then decided never again after being exposed to the Tony-and-Rogers movie experience that was Tony giving Rogers a running commentary on the movie and Rogers snarking back.
“Well…” Tony pretended to deliberate over his answer. “Being able to eat is nice, too.”
“I don’t want to lose this,” Tony said eventually, entirely honest. “You know I don’t make friends easily, Steve. And this…we have a good thing going, don’t we?”

Rhodey would have liked to protest, but he hated it just as much. Just…very quietly. Where no one could hear.
Hovering had turned into spending time with Tony in the workshop and then outside of the workshop.
The gentle press of Steve’s lips to his hair tugged Tony’s attention back to his partner, more specifically to the distant expression in his eyes.
“That wasn’t a dream.” Tony dropped his eyes to their hands. “But…I thought…I thought you’d move on. Since I wasn’t…I wasn’t giving you what you wanted.”
“And that’s…us?” Tony shared a glance with Steve, breathing in deeply at the pang in his chest.
“It wasn’t flirting.” Natasha looked between Steve and Tony. “But I guess if it’s with Tony…you should be fine.”
From the look Tony shot him, Steve suspected he’d failed. “
Rhodey had no idea if Rogers was treating Tony right but
Tony blinked, confused. “Steve?”

“One time!” Tony exclaimed, pointing a finger in Steve’s direction. “That was
There was a quick blink that Steve would have missed if he hadn’t been paying attention. Tony didn’t say anything else, tilting his head and spreading his feet to assume the basic stance that Steve had taught him when they first started lessons.
“I confess to some curiosity,” K’salk’adi said, finally breaking the silence as Tony moved from one end of the room to the next.
“Ah.” Tony refocused to see Steve in front of him, holding two glasses. One was eggnog, and the other looked to be apple cider, steam curling through the air. “Which one’s for me?”
Ugh, seriously? Even Thor? Thor – who barely spent any time with them?
Steve was silent for a long moment, expression lost. “I don’t want to miss another chance because I waited too long,” he said eventually.
…Kissing, maybe?
“There’s cereal in the cabinet there,” Tony said ruthlessly.
Tony considered pretending he was asleep for all of five seconds before answering with a low “hm?” That was casual enough, wasn’t it?
“Yeah,” Steve murmured eventually, sighing, “I guess you are.”
Tony dropped the pillow-like thing to see what Steve was talking about, half-expecting some monstrosity like in the deleted scenes from
There was a burst of crackle from the translator that Tony assumed was laughter. “Your touch will not harm the mechanics, Tony. I assume Earth does not have this?”
There were only so many floors in this tower and Rhodey didn’t need to commandeer an entire one for the few times that he was able to spend time with his best friend.
And that it wasn’t a mistake.
Why hadn’t Tony told him that he’d gotten together with Steve Rogers,
“The last one.” Steve pulled a face as they reached the car. “Both. Okay, maybe the guys living in the apartment down the hall from us were in a relationship and not just really good friends. But nowadays you can’t even hug another guy without someone looking sideways at you and thinking you’re gay. I mean, I’m sure as hell queer, but that doesn’t
“I have seldom seen a pair of shield-brothers in such sync as you two,” Thor said fondly. “It brings me joy to know that you two have found your way to each other.”
like he was about to punch Tony… “I…” He took a breath, eyes closing briefly.
The same could be said for the good china.
“Malnussians, sir,” Steve corrected. “And yes. According to Thor, the Malnussian culture values paired leaders highly. He volunteered us before letting us know.”
Neither did his heart, which really only wanted Steve.
Rhodey gave it a fond pat, ignoring the gaudy red, white, and blue color scheme that he’d been talked into a few months ago by the U.S. government in hopes of inspiring recruitment. Tony had never let him live it down, joking that it looked like Captain America and Iron Man had a baby.
He could do this. He could totally do this.
to, but it sure would have been nice to hear from my
Giving the two of them one last look, Rhodey headed for his room that Tony had put on the penthouse level. Tony had tried to give him an entire floor but Rhodey had put his foot down.
Tony stared at Rhodey. “What makes you think we’re dating?”
Steve hugged him back, holding him tightly. “I’m only sorry I didn’t do it sooner.”
He didn’t have much time to wonder what was going on with Steve because he was being kissed in the next instant, Steve’s warm hands holding his face tenderly and his lips gentle but firm.
“I’m making friends,” Tony said defensively.
“The living room needs cleaning,” Steve fired back, giving Clint a pointed look. Clint hastily shoved something under the couch. “Trust me, I can come up with something suitably creative.”
Rogers was in the workshop when Rhodey sought Tony out. He wasn’t talking to Tony but sitting on a chair by one of the tables and sketching. He had one of Tony’s disgusting green smoothies next to his elbow and was actually drinking it with a straight face.
At this point, it didn’t really matter.
Tony stared after him as the bathroom sealed shut behind him, never having seen Steve be that clumsy before. Captain America was usually the epitome of grace, especially since Steve had picked up gymnastics and incorporated it into his fighting style. Steve and clumsiness just didn’t go together.
“It…would be inadvisable,” Thor said, looking pained.
Tony let out a soft breath, something in his chest unclenching. (It couldn’t be that easy, could it?) Maybe…maybe he should stop overthinking things so much.
Thor frowned, looking to the others as if seeking confirmation of this. From the head shakes Tony saw out of the corner of his eye, they weren’t backing Tony up on this.
Tony didn’t have time to ask how K’salk’adi knew they were here as A’gel’fush and Steve walked in. Steve looked rather odd, like he’d been hit upside the head with his own shield, but he didn’t seem physically harmed.
MIT graduates Rhodey could name (coughTonyStarkcough).
“Well, I’ll say it again.” Steve took another step towards him, bit his lower lip, and then ducked in to press a soft kiss to Tony’s cheek. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
What were the odds?
Tony paused, eyes flicking over to Steve. It was a long moment before he responded, his voice quiet. “You and me both. Why do you think I do it? If one of us has to get hurt, it should be the one who can take more punishment.”
“Sorry,” Steve repeated, rubbing a hand through his hair and making it even messier. Tony had the sudden desire to run his own hands through it and smoothen it and clenched his hands into fists so he wouldn’t act on it.
Steve didn’t respond for a long moment. Tony almost gave in to the desire to turn around and look when Steve said, almost too quietly to hear, “We do.” Then, louder, “We should get some sleep. We’ve got more talking to do tomorrow.”
Steve jerked up, looking alarmed. “I thought we were dating now? Do you
Steve shot him a look, eyes narrowing. “You know exactly what it was.”
. (That assessment still burned when he thought about it, even if it had been rather painfully accurate.)
“I remember the day we found you,” Tony heard himself saying. “The best day of my life. How could I not remember your first Christmas with us?”
It was more of a surprise to find out that Rogers wasn’t as straight as history had painted him to be (and how the conservative groups liked Captain America to be), but Rhodey knew better than most how history liked to whitewash events.
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” was all Steve said, still giving Tony that beautiful grin.
Bruce had hung around for a bit but then withdrawn, ill-equipped to handle the situation but offering his lab for a quiet space. Tony hadn’t wanted Clint or Natasha around, and Thor was a giant puppy but not around enough either.
I am to know you. How lucky I am to have you as my friend, and I can’t believe I lucked out on having you like

The speech was rubbish and not at all what he’d planned, but it was everything he needed to say and everything he hoped Tony heard.
“I just thought…since he put this together and all… He should be here to enjoy it, too.”
Forcing himself to breathe evenly, Tony told himself it was fine.
“Leave the gun alone, Tony,” Rhodey said, sighing. “It’s perfectly fine—”

, is it?”
What did
But his luck being what it was, Steve eventually pinned him down when Tony went to find a quiet spot to breathe.
Steve didn’t seem deterred. “I’ve always wanted you. I just never knew how to say it, and I didn’t want to ruin what we had. But I’m tired of waiting and you almost
“The Malnussians are a very particular race,” Thor said. “They value paired leaders, preferably those who are lifelong companions.” A sorrowful expression crossed over his face. “At one point I could have done so with Loki but…” He shook his head, face clearing. “I know of no one else that I would trust with his mission.”
Tony had been
As chill as the Malnussians were (not that Tony knew many aliens at all but he could definitely say that these particular aliens were chill), Tony really,
“I recall when A’gel’fush and I met,” K’salk’adi continued, the wistful words at odds with the translator’s monotone. “It was at a social gathering; our eyes met across the room. It could have simply been a chance meeting, but I accidentally dirtied his clothes. The rest came so easily.”
“Should I be concerned that you’re dressing Banner up?” Rhodey asked, flicking the relevant hologram with a finger. It fizzled angrily for a moment before stabilizing.

to say “We need to talk,” largely because the last time he’d accidentally used that phrase Tony had dropped his coffee and also hit Peter with a wrench. Peter had been fine; the coffee had not.
“You should just quit while you’re ahead, Clint,” Natasha said, smiling in amusement. “Remember what happened with the fishing game?”

Not that Steve had expected one given he’d just given that speech to a mirror.
have this now, and it was something Steve always liked to remind him of whenever Tony got a little too maudlin (which was often).
“That was both of us, Tony. Shellhead.” Steve’s smile was weak. “I think we know better now, don’t we?”
The blond listened to the brunet, figuring he ought to try that simple-family life he was talking about. It would be great for him. It would be great for him to try it out with the man he loves.
When Tony saw him, he was shocked and confused. Yes, Steve knew he looked...
Tony was brought back. The armored man panicked as life suddenly came back to his eyes. It was terrifying to see. Such great fear and confusion in those deep brown eyes. It broke Steve's old heart.
The gray hair, the wrinkles, the slight wobble in his step, and other things that came with being older were a terrifyingly amusing sight to see on him. Tony was used to the broad shoulders, thin waist, abs, and whatever else that made him seem as if he had the perfect body.
Times were extremely different from years ago. But Tony was there for him. Tony helped him around the little cabin on the skirts of the city, eagerly helping him with making dinner and giving him massages. It was nice and he couldn't help but voice this with a sweet kiss to Tony's lips. Who only rolled his eyes, but a warm smile coming fourth on his lips.
Pushing back his mortification, Steve slid his chair closer until their knees knocked together and he could lean forward. “I’ll tell you over and over, as many times as you need to hear it. Because I love you and can’t believe you said yes to this.”
