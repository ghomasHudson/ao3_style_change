Two feet on the stairs. One consulting detective with a shopping bag, striding across the room, sliding his coat off and tossing it on the chair. He plopped down and slid until his legs were under the coffee table and his head resting on the back of the sofa.  He didn’t look at John, but John was content to have him near. They both stared straight ahead at the snowman rolling over the hill with his brolly, resembling Mycroft at his highest weight.
Not just listening though…John had his eyes fastened to Mike’s collar and leash. Did he even realize how he stared at it? Like a thirteen year old boy enchanted by a woman’s cleavage.
“My favorite.” John said dryly.
“No!”
"Oh, hullo, dear!" Mrs. Hudson strode into the room with some empty glasses. She made for the wine bottle.
“Yes, I do! If not next, then soon. Look at that, Sherlock!” He pointed at the photos of the bodies. “They look just like you. Young, white, male, submissive!”
“Be that as it may, remember that you are a guest in his home.”
“Yes.” Sherlock didn’t move.
"Baking is a dirty business." Sue said sagely.
“Are you sore?”
“I don’t know. It only arrived yesterday, before you returned.”
“Are you stuck?” She asked.
John closed his eyes and the other concubines around him scoffed. “Rotten luck, mate, he’s a nutter!”
Sherlock jerked in John’s grip and rutted into his hand. The doctor grinned. He was so close. “I want to see you in my office, Private Holmes. I think you need an exam.”
They pushed into a flat and Mike tossed down his bag before taking John's coat and hanging it up. The flat was cozy and homey and smelled of savory meats and roasting vegetables and butter. John's stomach grumbled and he eagerly followed Mike into the kitchen.
“You pick.” Sherlock turned away from the selection and preened in front of the mirror some more.
Sherlock sucked him deeper, egged on by the praise. John hissed and tightened his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock pulled off. He wrapped his hand around John’s cock and pulled fast and loose. John groaned and clenched his arse cheeks.
Sherlock woke up the next morning, warm and covered with blankets. The mattress beside him shifted. It sounded like a book was put down on the side table and the blanket was lifted off his legs. Warm familiar hands stroked down his thighs, spreading his legs. “More?” He muttered into the cotton.
The detective sighed and touched his red bum, wincing at the tender heat.
“Yes, yes.” Sherlock held the vial up to the light, grinning devilishly at the dark arterial blood. “How did you get it?”
Mycroft Holmes glanced at his gold pocketwatch as his driver pulled up to the curb outside 221. He had time before his meeting to call on his brother. He hadn’t been by the flat in an age and Sherlock would certainly be delighted to see him drop by unannounced. Ha.
"Sit. Eat. I'll get us tea."
"Yes."
"He's in my room. Down the hall. Loo's to the left if you need it."
John was quiet, then, “let me put cream on your back.”
“Let me out!” Sherlock demanded, clenching the iron bars.
"I do! I wish I could read more. It's so hard to fit in around work and things, you know?"
“Quiet.”
Every year at this time Sherlock would hear about "Christmas Spirit." People would tell others to "get in the Christmas Spirit" or say "where's your Christmas Spirit?" He wondered if it was possible to measure said spirit and, a year ago, decided to try. It was a frustratingly intangible thing to measure. How did one measure 'spirit?' Fortunately his flatmate and land lady were of that breed who thoroughly enjoyed Christmas and he'd created some parameters by which to attempt to measure 'spirit.'
The sub came back down the hall fifteen minutes later, clean and dressed.
“These are expensive restaurants.” Donovan noted, looking at the wad of wet receipts. “I’m not saying he couldn’t afford it, but not many students would choose to go to
He swatted each warm cheek over and over. His other hand was braced firmly on his sub’s hip, holding him steady and in place. Sherlock could feel the reassuring grip of his hand and he squeezed John’s ankle. He closed his eyes peacefully as the spanks popped through the air above him. He focused on the feel of John’s warm leg braced under his hips and the mildly humiliating oddity of his gown tossed unceremoniously over his back. The backs of his knees were cool and exposed but his backside was warming up fast. It wasn’t a particularly hard spanking and John was swatting him with all the rhythm of a metronome. He appreciated this, as it allowed him to sink towards the edges of subspace and just float there. It was silencing and calming and Sherlock took a deep breath.
“Okay, up.”
"No Mycroft! I'll go mad!"
“What the fuck is my sub doing here?” He growled. He slammed Vincent into the wall and a framed picture of a boat crashed to the wood floor.
“Most people aren’t. How many hours a week are you here, Callum?”
"No! Not at all."
“I see you smiling.” John said in a gruff voice. Sherlock rubbed his face into the Tshirt and inhaled his dom’s scent and sighed in contentment. John rolled his eyes fondly and freed his other arm, mashed as it was into the pillow. He squeezed some goop onto his fingers and reached down, smearing it over his red skin.
Sherlock unpacked the food and sat. John poured them both tea. He would have liked to feed Sherlock, to really draw it out and indulge them both but they were just too tired and worn out from the past twenty four hours. They ate in silence, as neither man seemed to realize how hungry he was until there were pastrami and mustard and ham sandwiches in their hands.
“What did he look like? Tall? Short? Hair color? Eye color? Speak quickly!”
boys?"
“Once.” He said. “For the longest time I thought I was a submissive. When I first started getting those feelings in school, there was a dominant girl that I had a crush on.” Sherlock heard the smile in his voice. “She was lovely. I knelt for her in her bedroom on our third day of summer break when we were both fifteen or so. We looked into each other’s eyes. And then she let me look up her skirt.”
“So was Mycroft.” Sherlock muttered.
"No, Sherlock. You are behaving like a child. Stop this tantrum and grow up. You're a prince. Start acting like one!" He flung Sherlock's hand away. "Rest today, sleep this mistake off." He sounded disgusted and Sherlock's chest tightened with shame, "and then pack your things. You're coming with me and I'll hear nothing more about it." He gave Sherlock a terrible fierce stare and Sherlock turned away.
“Alright, thanks for your help.” John smiled at him and hurried after his sub.
camera?
Sherlock was staring through the dripping window to the small groups of people making their way about in the bad weather. Many turned and waved, delight on their faces despite the foul weather, once they realized it was a royal carriage. Flanked as it was by guards on horseback even the dullest citizens could gather that at least one royal family member was inside. It was idiotic. Anyone in the area who wanted to end the Holmes royal line would know to attack
“You’re welcome.” John said quietly, coming up behind him. “I wasn’t sure, but I’m glad you like it.”
"Sorry, love." John murmured. His voice was deeper than normal. He rinsed his sub and rubbed the bar of soap over his own body.
At that moment, a text came through from Mycroft.
"Several months ago, yes." Sherlock said stiffly.
“Lying to me is never okay. If you lie, you get the paddle. I love you to death, Sherlock, if you got hurt or killed because of some stupid lie…?”
"M'not dying." He said weakly. I hope.
“No.” Sherlock scoffed. “Relax, will you?” He sounded irritated but he couldn’t help it. John was being such a damn martyr. “You didn’t sodomize me with a broken bottle, you were simply over excited.”
“We’ll find him, John.” Mike was putting on his jacket.
“Good boy.” John rested his butt on the desk and watched his sub pull his cock out of the soft fabric and give it a long lick. “Mmm,” John smirked as Sherlock bobbed and sucked and licked. He sighed in pleasure and twisted his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.
He poured a mug and took a nice long sip, exhaling in delight at the scalding liquid and steam.
John gulped. “Yeah, of course.”
Logan plunged the knife between Sherlock’s right ribs. The sudden pain of it jolted more adrenaline into his body and he elbowed Logan as hard as he could, but it was like a mouse pouncing on a lion.
“Fry cook?” John repeated. “At
“Hm.” Sherlock turned on his heel and walked out.
“Sh…good boy.” John soothed. “I’ve got you. Let’s have a shower and some sleep, yeah? We’re going to be busy tomorrow.”
“I’ll bring you one.” John got up and went to the freezer. No ice packs, but there was a long forgotten bag of frozen chopped carrots behind what appeared to be the left hemisphere of a human brain. John gamely grabbed the carrots and shut the freezer door.
The door popped open. Sherlock was dressed again and looking even more haggard and sleepy than before. "You'll get some bruising, sir." The male medic said. "Icing the area tonight will help reduce swelling. We'll give you enough vicodin to get you through tomorrow. Following up with your GP is a good idea."
"I'm sure it's not." Sherlock sniffed. "He just wants to cause trouble."
“Sh…” John hugged him close and rubbed his back. “Good boy.”
“It’s not all that bad.” Sherlock said, looking now into the tiny loo off to the side. “Though I can see why you spend much of your time at B.” It was obvious that his own flat was preferable to the doctor.
They got to the docks without any incident and Greg departed the carriage first. A blast of cold air hit them all in the face as the door swung open before Sally followed Greg and closed it. They did a quick visual check of the docks and personnel, each glancing an expert eye over the area for any obvious signs of disquiet. The two ships, Mycroft’s
The crew scattered and Sherlock groaned dramatically at the loss of attention. “I’d rather drown than set foot in Castle Chilgrave.” He hopped down from the bow, violin dangling listlessly from his hand. The journey to Hibern lasted less than three days in good weather and Sherlock, nearly two days in, was going crazy.
would want to date him, much less propose. But John had and the Gordian Knot of confused feelings was gone for good. John had unraveled it. God, he needed to make an entry about this…
there, wasn't there?
"I'm a bit disappointed." Paul said. "They sounded delicious, but they're just too burned to eat."
“—Nope.” John held it out of reach.
John stood and grabbed the tube of aloe based lotion. He got on the bed and straddled him, knees on either side of his sub's waist as he knelt-sat on his back. He smoothed cool lotion into his round bum cheeks and smiled, enjoying the feel of Sherlock's smooth pink skin under his hands. Sherlock let out a content sigh. John's weight was warm on his back and it was comforting in a way to be pinned like this. Held down. He reached and wrapped his hands around John's calves.
"Welp!" Jim slapped his hands down on the armrests of his throne and stood. "That's that." He shrugged, then stretched in the sunlight, yawning exaggerated and loud. Sebastian Moran appeared at his side, looking down at John with something like pity.
“Mph!” Sherlock blinked in surprise but melted into the kiss a moment later.
He was eager to go back to the alcove.
“Mmhm.” He rubbed his temples.
"I'm fine." He snipped.
he thought childishly,
"Let's not let that stop us, I am too." John showed off his own ring and slipped his fingers in between the handsome man's. He let his voice drop to a whisper and he leaned in to the man's ear. "I don't think my husband will mind." John smiled when the handsome man with the lovely hair swallowed and shivered. He shook his head.
“Good. With me.”
John stormed down the corridor and moments later the shower was running. Who was
Last year after he'd tallied everything he'd concluded that 221's sense of Christmas spirit was at 84.78% out of a possible one hundred. He thought that was pretty good for a structure containing three people, one of which was simply observing. He was mildly curious to see how this year would measure up.
He shoved it back into the envelope, his heart pounding. He needed to tell someone. This was getting to be too much. He squeezed the cardboard. How could he say anything
“Evenings. Weekends. Never seen her here without her sub though.” He glanced at the customers behind them and Sherlock stepped aside.
"No one knows it's me!" Sherlock snapped.
“I’d like that.”
“John, you haven’t
“No, John.”
Sherlock wriggled his fingers. He rolled to the side carefully and sat on his bum, stretching his stiff legs and wiggling his toes.
"And Patty's mighty sore‒she thinks maybe something's wrong in her bits."
thing you should be saying to me, and that thing is ‘thank you.’ You have for whatever reason elected to hate me, but I’ll not stand here and endure your poor attitude the way everyone else seems to be happy doing. I went out of my way to do Mike a favor, and you could show a little gratitude.”
Sherlock saved his journal entry again and closed the program. He texted back:
"I suppose not." Sherlock nuzzled into his neck. "What say we go to my rooms and create some new holiday traditions of our own?"
“He’s a psychotic little shit bird.”
“Have you seen this book?” Mike pulled a book about fungus and it’s relationship with the decomposition of organic matter off the shelf. It was dry reading but it had lots of painted illustrations and diagrams, perfect for a small science-bent boy. Sherlock took it, frowning. The plain red leather cover looked the same as the astronomy text his tutor tried to get him to read. Sherlock scoffed at the very thought (who
He walked in and turned on the light beside the bed. Sherlock strolled in after him and stood in the doorway, glancing around and taking it all in. “Not much, I know.” John told him. He went to the fridge, almost afraid at what he’d find growing in there.
"Yes, dear. Thank you very much. He appreciates it even if he doesn't say so."
John lifted his head with a triumphant grin on his red lips. “Bad boy.” He swatted his bottom and squeezed the cheek.
Sherlock stepped into the tub and simply let John take over. He needed this—they
John took a deep, steady breath. He was definitely going to need to prepare himself throughly.
John smirked. “Over excited is being kind.”
"John!" She said warmly. "Good to meet you! Mike's mentioned a few friends from his glory days before we met and I wondered if I'd ever lay eyes on any of them." She glanced at his fingers and throat as she turned back to the stove, checking to see if he was dom or sub. As John wore no jewelry, he knew she wouldn’t be able to tell. "Supper'll just be a few." She said. "Want something to drink? Mike will get it for you."
“Shut up and hold fucking still!” Jim growled. He punched John again, this time on the mouth. John’s head snapped to the side. The blow rattled his very skull. John’s hands flew up to his face and he moaned, clutching his mouth. Jim rolled him over onto his belly and flung the cloth out of the way. He smiled and pushed John’s legs apart.
Sherlock nodded and John grabbed his clothes. They stepped out of the radiology room‒
“It’s like a secret weapon, yeah?” John snickered.
John paused, slightly defensive now. “Who wants to know?”
John cleared his throat.
“Schrodinger’s kitchen.” John binned some used napkins.
Sherlock reached for the plug and pulled a cheek aside. He pushed it in, knowing from his own experience how much pressure to apply. The thing slid right in and stayed there.
“You’re
He went to his laptop and began combing through his recipes, compiled by type of baked good, number of steps in the recipe, and ease and speed. He filed away the best ones for his signature bakes.
"Return?" Sherlock blurted.
“Anything?”
“No!” Sherlock spat.
yelling all the while. Lestrade and John startled and went quiet at the new noise.
just so I could look.”
John thought about asking, then sense kicked in. He shrugged. “Alright then.”
“So no more running around the city tonight?”
“Yes, yes, of course.” Seb said quickly.  He sounded nervous. John had never heard the pompous man sound anything less than arrogant and cruel. “Look, Sire, your guests will be coming in from dinner soon. Put the letter aside for now, have a smoke, and enjoy your evening. You’ve earned it after spending the last week with Holmes.”
“What happened?” He asked.
He was crouched before his oven door eight minutes later, smiling at the crisp edges. They were perfect, utterly perfect. He pulled them out and set them on the wire rack, taking a big breath of the spicy ginger scent. Each floral shape would be sandwiched with the sweet cream filling and then just a bit of drizzled icing would finish off the top.
“Prove it!”
“Are you coming over after?”
“I know as much as you, mate. Cheers.” John got in the car, supremely confused. A pretty brunette lady was seated on the black leather bench seat, texting on a blackberry. She didn’t look at him and the car wove smoothly back into traffic.
"Ready?" Bill said, rolling up the map. John pulled his dark green gaiter up off his throat, obscuring everything below his eyes.
Sherlock touched his arm. “You go inside before you do something you’ll regret.”
not.” His tone made gooseflesh erupt down John’s back. Mycroft stayed in his space, staring down at him, and the doctor stared right back up, trying to look as challenging as he could. It was difficult. This man wore his dominance as well as his fine bespoke suit and John hadn’t confronted a forceful dom like this in while.
Sherlock rested his head on John’s, thinking. “Will you be okay with this?” He asked.
“Mycroft?” He asked. The name rang a faint bell…
“You didn’t sleep.” Sherlock said to him.
It hit him like a rhinoceros galloping headlong into a brick wall. John. The case. The dead cabbie. Had he and John
Sherlock eyed the cooler by the door curiously. He had completely forgotten about it. “What’s in there?”
Sherlock gleefully obeyed. He darted down the hall with the ropes and John stalked after.
“Here.” John held a piece of steaming ravioli out to him, covered in sauce and cheese. Sherlock glanced up at him and leaned forward, picking it delicately off the fork with his teeth and chewing happily. John grabbed some salad for himself and popped open the lasagna. He tore a bite off of the generous chunk of pasta and held his fork out again. Sherlock licked his lips and leaned forward again, taking the bite into his mouth. John slid the fork out from between his lips and they grinned at each other, chewing.
John gave him the address.
"I know it was stupid. I couldn't help it."
"I was cold!" John shrugged.
"Did you put yeast in?" Sherlock said.
“You were awful to Lestrade.” John sat beside him, his tone marginally softer. “What did we talk about before? About you being rude?”
John smiled and hung a heavy coat, so dark grey it was nearly black, on a wooden rack in the corner. "Why do you hate him?" He asked.
“John…?” Sherlock glanced at him. “Problem?”
Sherlock obeyed. He tossed the gown on the chair and dropped to the floor, watching him go to the wardrobe and grab his box of fun and put it on the bed. Sherlock licked his lips. His cock jerked hopefully in a sort of Pavlovian response to the sight of the box.
“Hm?” Sherlock blinked at the figure on the screen. “Oh. I suppose.” He made note of the streets in the video and stood up, hurrying to the bedroom.
"Okay, whew." John poked at the sizzling sausages. "I know not everyone is into…" He gestured to Sherlock, "this." John smiled at his sub with pride and love beaming off his face.
The savory smells of food had been drifting up the steps all day and John's stomach was getting curious. He might need to do some investigating of his own. Maybe she needed a hand in the kitchen?
"Of course. They're like wild animals. Cunning. Show them mercy and they'll leap up and bite your throat, this one especially. Keeping them all docile is practically a full time job."
“I imagine it’s
John took a deep breath. “Come here.” He sat on the sofa and Sherlock scuttled over and knelt on the floor beside him. John had meant for him to sit on the sofa, but if he wanted to kneel that was fine. “I’m not upset with you. You know that, right?”
“For who?”
“Mm, just the crop really. I have some rope. I, I like being tied up. I’ve used my fingers now and then...” He blushed and John found it adorable.
“I knew I should have gone. Did you see anything of
"M'fine." He slurred. He leaned against the stone wall, trying to get his bearings. He felt awful.
" Moriarty said. John tried not to shiver.
“Oh. What’s wrong with Sherlock?” John remembered the rude way the sub had spoken to him the other day at Bart’s, and at the moment he had no further interest in speaking with the surly detective.
There weren’t any more crashes. John listened as carefully as he manage. He didn’t even breathe. Seb’s voice again, “is it true?”
Stabbed her! Over and over and over again and I looked and she weren’t—
“Couldn’t breathe.” He rasped. He held still as John unlatched the cuffs and pulled them off. Nothing touched him anymore and he scrubbed his hands through his hair.
"Holy shit." Greg blinked at the vivid violet and blue marks. The left side of his back was stained from hip to scapula.
“He’s dead.” Sherlock said bluntly.
“Hm?” He grunted.
“Sore. Pinchy.”
Sherlock stomped into Lestrade’s office two weeks later in a pissy mood. The DI’s office was empty, the rolling chair pushed back. Sherlock scowled at the mess of papers and folders on the desk. A few empty paper coffee cups were in the bin and there wasn’t a full one on the desk. Greg was getting coffee, likely from the little break room down the hall. He walked closer to the desk, seeing nothing that would indicate a new case. Blast. He needed a distraction. He’d solved three simple website cases in two weeks and installed a cabinet in Mrs. Turner’s flat and with every silly clue and turn of the screwdriver, thoughts of The Kiss had been burning hot in the back of his mind. He wanted to scoff and sweep it away, but the evidence was clear: he enjoyed John’s company and he wanted more of it.
. There was nothing unique or especially enticing about him. He was a concubine like so many nameless concubines and nothing more. Mycroft imagined though that with a bit more weight and a body not marred with scratches and bruises, he could pass for handsome, but even so he had no idea what type of connection his brother and this man had made. He was
“I’ll let John deal with you.” Lestrade said. “He’s on his way.”
“How’s things?” He took a few steps towards him, smiling. “I haven’t heard from you in a while.”
“We’ll find him, John.” Greg said. John’s grip tightened on the handle.
“Jesus…” he flopped back down into the pillows and mentally cataloged his surroundings. His bedsit. Nighttime. It was quiet—silent, really. This was a quiet part of town. No threats. He took a few calming breaths and sat up again, slowly, rubbing his hands over his face. That had been…vivid. He stood up and grabbed his cane in one hand and his Sig in the other. He went to the front door, checking the lock again. Still bolted tight. He shuffled to the opposite end of the room and peered through the constantly closed drapes. The yellow streetlight flooded the pavement. A fox trotted by, melting into the night. John closed them again and went to the kitchen and drank a glass of water, wondering why the hell he had dreamed about Sherlock Holmes. He hadn’t seen or heard from the sub in three weeks, why was he suddenly appearing dead in his dreams?
“Are you alright?” He glanced over his sub and touched his arm, then snarled at the collar.
“You seem to like things with your name on.”
“The thing that makes Rudolph different from everybody else turns out to be what they need most and he saves the day. He guides Santa through the fog to get the misfit toys and they all are given to children who need them.”
“For weeks. What are you asking of him at home, John? He gave me a look so vicious this morning that a clump of my hair fell out.”
John struggled to see in the flickering candle light, but when he looked, really looked in his lover’s eyes, there was sadness and fear. “These past few weeks, you weren’t intending to be stroppy, were you?”
All afternoon, he had been productive and stoic and furious. As long as he kept busy, he wouldn’t have to stare at the words that marqueed across his mind. INFLEXIBLE   STROPPY   OBLIVIOUS   UNREASONABLE    PETTY    SCROOGE    SELFISH    WANKER
“Mmmm, I deduce you may need more stimulation.” John who had been to three continents thus earning the nickname, Three Continents Watson, pressed eager lips to his companion’s nipple.
“Turn round,” John said, finishing the clean up and tucking his greatest temptation away, smoothing the flap closed with the Velcro.
Sherlock looked up at him with sleepy eyes, full of trust and hope.  “Happy Christmas, John.
“I didn’t even know we had one.”
Sherlock’s eyes were glassy and his breathing labored. The doctor in John came up with words like agitated, shocky, altered, but the lover was gritting his teeth until his jaw popped to keep from crying out. He wanted to make it stop. There couldn’t be more.
“It’s all right. I think I need to. Then I can delete it.”
Catching sight of his face in the mirror, John expected to see cuts and bruises, but for someone that was shattered, he looked fairly normal. No one would have to know that he was crying inside as his relationship trickled down the drain with the last of the bubbles. Dragging the towel hurriedly over his skin, John reached for his new dressing gown. His fingers stroked across the family crest he hadn’t even known he had. “Beyond expectation,” he whispered.
Sherlock’s voice was small and weary. “He said that he believed me and I was so relieved, but then he said that little boys like me had an evil streak. I had used my beauty for seduction instead of good and corrupted my dear uncle. I wasn’t to come to the church for help because I was a danger to all righteous men.”
“I thought it would be bigger.”
“For whom?”
“Why the fuck would you say that?”
The next words were nearly a scream. “Have I corrupted you, John?”
“Sherlock doesn’t shop. Ever."
“You’d have to burn all my clothes and fly me to Siberia to get me in that,” Sherlock said and turned back to his experiment.
John could almost see his own smile light up the room. “Clever boy.  I would have never thought.”
“No, but I don’t get out much during the day. Why are you doing that?”
The last one was hypocritical, considering what he did in the shower.  “Merry Fucking Christmas, John. You just grudge fucked yourself.”
“A Holmes doesn’t shrink.”
John shuddered. “They go or I go; I’ve already texted Lestrade.”
“Is this for a case, Sherlock?”
John was trying to get some feeling back into his genital yogurt dispenser when Sherlock returned with a nearly empty tube. “This was full on Monday. You have been busy.”
“Any better?” he asked, pulling Sherlock close.
“Can I have the light on? Just to see it properly.”
At 221B, John expected surprises that exploded or smelled of death or stared at him with lifeless eyes. He did not expect cut glass round candle holders with clear tea lights. The flames looked like they were dancing in midair all along the windowsill.
“No rabbit socks in the index?”
“Why should I? You couldn’t give me one fucking hour. It was the only thing that I asked of you other than helping me carry the blessed tree."
John Watson slid the shirt the color of an erect penis off Sherlock’s shoulders. The dusky purple garment fell to the floor as the older man caressed the taller man’s chest. “Jaisus, you’re pale as a corpse, almost blue.”
“Don’t hold back on my account.”
“Your uncle smelled bad?” John was trying to keep things grounded for Sherlock.
Sherlock explains why Christmas is so difficult for him.
John groaned inwardly. Everything about the holiday was charged, and he was still slipping up, offering food that had terrible memories tied to it. Love was rescue and courage, true enough, but it was also in the little things like keeping triggers away. Love was listening to horrific stories without flinching. Love was living with a picture etched forever in his mind of a small, sweet boy being degraded by a monster. Love was the seething rage that said kill what has hurt yours but knowing that revenge would only take him away from his broken lover and so vengeance was selfish.
“Something wrong?”
Empty of the jagged secrets that had been cutting and scarring him for almost all his life, Sherlock was quiet. John had time to review the day. What were those words that had been running on his mental marquee earlier?
“What am I sitting on?”
“It is proportionate to my size,” Watson said through gritted teeth as the member in question shrunk even further under scrutiny.
“And that’s why you don’t like Christmas foods. I wouldn’t either.”
“I’ll put the radio on. Why don’t you have a mince pie while I get things ready?”
“It had to match, John.”
Sherlock curled his long fingers around the mug, resting it on his knees which he pulled into his chest. John switched the light back off and let the candles once again create a more intimate space. Then he sat on the edge of the bed, facing Sherlock. When their eyes met, they both held their breath for a moment.
“Give me one bloody minute.”
“I don’t eat mince pies.”
“Fine, keep your bloody coat on, but when you steal the covers tonight, I’ll still be warm even if I need to use the loo.”
Sherlock’s afterglow voice whispered in his ear, “I’ll do the laundry.”
Sherlock was dozing, his head hanging down.
“He didn’t stop jabbing into me until he came and I was throbbing by then. He let go of himself and squeezed my cock hard and that hurt too.”
“I think we’ve got quite enough animals to be going on with,” Sherlock said, removing his sock and using it to mop up behind him.
“Should have got the lube first,” Sherlock corrected, the scuff slide of his gait heading toward the bedroom.
“Are you saying that you’re on fire with passion?”
“Then why the sock?”
“Just for the holiday. While it’s cold. They’re soft. See?” John rubbed the fleece against Sherlock’s cheek.
“Please do not use treacle or liniment on me and furniture polish is right out.”
“Why don’t you wave it about like the bloody Union Jack, you daft twat?”
“Until me?”
Sherlock snapped his phone and his heart shut. Without even making eye contact, he grabbed coat and scarf and hurled an explanation back at John while taking the stairs at a gallop. St. Bart’s again and likely another all nighter.
“Can’t or won’t?”
So John listened to the scuffing, the creak of the night table drawer, the creak of the bureau drawer, some rummaging, and then more scuffing.  Finally Sherlock was coming towards him with the lube in hand, but this fact hardly registered because Sherlock had a pink and gray argyle sock protruding from the front of his new pajamas and there was definitely bobbing with occasional weaving. He placed his hands firmly on the kitchen table and wiggled his feet apart into a ‘frisk me’ stance.
"Why did you smoke last night?"
Sherlock hopped around like a crazy person, yelling about Christmas when Mike cleared his throat.
“Oh, ffff…” John squeezed his cheeks harder and pulled them apart. Sherlock nibbled the nub of skin and then looked up at John with a shit-eating smile. “If you
A warm hand rested on his head. “Alright, love?”
—Sherlock pushed past him.
“Do you need to go down?”
“Yes. Thank you.”
“Do you have gloves and lubrication?”
John licked his lips. "Yes." To his surprise, it was.
"I'd appreciate that." Sherlock told him. "Thank you for allowing me to stay here. And for the coffee."
“How do you take it?” John asked.
"Why? I'm suggesting it."
Everything started fine. John explained his three types of petit four to the cameras and started mixing and rolling and folding everything together. He'd just gotten his savory appetizers in the oven when he heard a pained yelp from Sherlock. He jerked up, the cry startling him into action. Sherlock was clutching his left wrist in a towel and the terry cloth was stained crimson. The cameras honed in on the blood and John jogged up to him.
The cameras filmed everyone's completed pieces and Paul and Mary came around. They enjoyed Greg's chocolate-something pie, and told Molly her flavor was excellent but the crust was just a bit underdone.
Sherlock’s arm tingled from the incident with the dom and the vase and he hoped Lestrade was right.
He popped down the steps and peeked his head into her open flat. Festive fairy lights were strung up and he could see her decorated tree glowing in the sitting room. He blinked at the sight in the kitchen. Her table and countertops were loaded with food. Everyone was in the sitting room and he crept into the kitchen to get better look. Crock pots of meatballs and bacon-wrapped dates were beside platters of pigs in a blanket. Hot spinach dip was being served with little slices of garlic toast. Chicken wings and loads of sauces were spread out on the table, along with a half-hearted veggie tray. John's eyes went wider at the chocolate-raspberry cheesecake iced with tasteful white frosting in the shape of snowflakes. The spread was magnificent and could feed an army. He speared a meatball and chewed thoughtfully. He liked to read. How exclusive was this club?
"Who?"
“Until next time, Doctor.” He looked away and Anthea escorted him away.
“No, not at all.”
“Cheers.” John kissed his nose in delight. “Let’s get out of here.”
His voice was flat and irritated.
Sherlock sat and stared listlessly at the paper. “Anything is better than this place.”
So Sherlock began by saying how Seb had come up to him on the pavement and spoke to him and tugged the leash. John listened, trying not to get too upset. Then he gave his side.
Mrs. Hudson had to try hard to hide her surprise. Sherlock barely paid attention to other people. Even as a boy he preferred his science and his dog and his bees and violin over the company of humans. Oh he had loved Redbeard. The two had been inseparable, going on adventures on the grounds and into town. Sherlock was crushed when the old dog got ill and died. Not long after Redbeard's death, he'd found Beatrix with an injured wing.
“Are you trying to get rid of me?”
he thought darkly,
He chided himself. He hadn't even thought to consider a look out. He didn't think they would be so suspicious.
“Fantastic.” John breathed.
John was quiet for a moment. His first instinct was to refuse, to back him into the wall and tell him damn well why he was going to hospital and that he was going to get examined whether he bloody liked it or not.
He hastily looked away again.
Sherlock blinked. “Now? I didn’t expect you to be so interested. Or interested at all.”
“Sherlock! You haven’t been answering me. I was worried.”
Sherlock didn’t tell him he didn’t know if he liked it or not, seeing as he’d never fucked a man before.
Mrs. Hudson tittered in delight.
Sherlock panted into the mattress and John could see his sides heaving. His bottom was like a tomato in the center of the bed. “I,” he began, “snuck away from dinner.”
“No? What did he make her do?”
“The nurse wanted to be alerted when you woke.” Mycroft glanced at John and something that could almost be called fondness came over his face before he stepped back and left the room, even though he could have just pushed a button to summon someone.
Okay, well, it was definitely nice having a lap full of naked John but now he couldn’t reach his laptop. He vaguely remembered swatting a newspaper out of his dom’s hands and laying on his lap and wondered if this was payback. He rested one hand on John’s hip and brushed some hair out of the band of the blindfold. He wanted to kiss him but couldn’t reach his face at this angle. Instead he leaned down and kissed his hip. John snuggled closer and Sherlock reached for the remote control. Maybe there would something good on for once. He flipped channels until he found a documentary on mold spores. It would have to do. He settled back on the sofa and rested his head on the cushion, stroking up and down John’s thigh and shoulder.
Sherlock and Jim had gone to boarding school together on the continent. The two had taken an instant disliking to each other that rapidly morphed into hatred. Jim was a hot-tempered little shit and Sherlock's scathing insults hit home every time. There wasn't a month that went by that they didn't fight until blood was drawn and instructor intervention was required.
"He said modestly." John added.
“No more limp.”
John and Lestrade glanced at each other and headed downstairs. A large crowd had gathered around one of billiards tables. John smiled as he caught sight of Sherlock. The detective had taken off his jacket and the tails of his shirt were dangling loose. His sleeves were rolled up his forearms and he had a confident, cocky smirk on his face as he shot the cue ball and knocked an orange-striped ball into a pocket with a smart
"Ah. What book did you read this week?"
“Sam was fine with it. Jeff and I worked in different areas. He was out in the garages and I’m on the floor, so we didn’t see each other except at lunch.”
“—was a mistake. I told you it meant nothing. It didn’t then and it doesn’t now.” He didn’t know why he was saying it. Last night had hardly been a mistake. His feelings towards John were as knotted as ever and he needed space to sort them. He didn’t want another dom, but the sub in him soared at John’s voice. John’s name. John’s everything. It was terrifying and overwhelming and wonderful and his chest tightened.
The doctor was stricken for a moment at the quiet, honest admission. “Someone should.” He said fondly.
John put the bag away in the bedroom and rooted through the piles of recent post, whistling. He’d meant to grab the coupon before they left but had completely forgotten. Good thing the restaurant was so close. He shuffled through junk and bills, finally finding a group of discount leaflets.
need more attention, love.” He pulled out and grabbed the clamps. Sherlock held his breath as John secured the metal clamps on each nipple. He yelped around the gag as the rubber tips pinched the delicate flesh. His knees were quivering and he felt hot and sore all over. Muscles that weren’t used to being stretched were getting pulled and tugged. His arms, his jaw, his legs. Even the bottoms of his feet were scraping around on the carpet. He was sweating underneath the gag strap and it was kind of gross. Warmth was seeping out of his bum and slicking his thighs and subspace had never seemed further away.
does."
“Mr. Holmes.” Dimmock looked to be at the end of his patience and he dropped the subject, giving it up to avoid the argument. “No.”
The side of Sherlock’s mouth went up in a grin. “Sentiment.” He swigged more water and rubbed his temple.
“Hm, an office romance.”
Delighted, John smushed both their cocks together tight in his fist and
John’s words were edged with frustration. Must have been a tedious shift.
“He was domming Owen Allsopp.” Lestrade said. “He’d been worried since he hadn’t heard from him in a few weeks. It sounds like Coel had a few subs he liked to see so when he thought Owen was playing hard to get, he just switched to a different flavor. The guy’s loaded with money and seems to be doing just fine.”
Sherlock hummed into his shoulder and lifted his face out, staring at John. The tension had drained out of his shoulders and the thunderous look was gone from his eyes.
He shrugged. “A better outlook. Yeah.” He clasped his hands in his lap and stared at her. She was a switch like him. It suited her well in her profession. A dom’s pride might get in the way of opening up to a strange submissive, and a sub could possibly get intimidated by her. As a switch, that wouldn’t happen.
“Because Coel lived so, so near to their flat. I thought that if I c-could pop over and come back,”
“I’ll add lemon balm too. Make a tea with these." Mike poured a few spoonfuls of dried herbs into some empty tea satchets. "Sleep, eat, bathe, drink these over the next couple days, and you'll start to feel better."
"That's not, but
They stared at each other for a moment, neither saying what they were both thinking. If they didn’t get there in time, Sherlock would be another tally on the victim list.
. Sherlock bounced up and untied the belt at John’s waist. He slid the gown off his shoulders and down his arms and tossed it by his own on the bed. John gave him the bottle and lay face down on the bed and Sherlock admired his dom’s body. His shoulders and back were strong and his bottom was enticingly plump. He had some softness around his belly and thighs and Sherlock licked his lips.
Sherlock looked at it now with more interest. He reached out to touch—
Sherlock glanced up from his mug, looking at John with luminous eyes.
Lestrade frowned, “maybe he…misjudged the dose.”
"With Greg?" He asked, trying not to feel too jealous of her. She got to spend loads of time with Greg since he and King Mycroft came back from the border.
John stared at his sub, one brow up.
The fire had burned lower and the small stack of wood beside the grate was significantly lessened. John was sitting across from him, his hair damp and ruffled. He was licking his fingers. He peered up at Sherlock and laughed at the Prince’s confusion.
“Here we are.” Logan came back in the room with a bottle of water. He cracked it open, his hands leaving bloody marks on the plastic. He tilted it into Sherlock’s mouth and he sipped as slowly as possible.
“Show me.” Sherlock commanded.
“Yes.”
“He was touching this.” John picked up the leash, feeling the soft leather in his hand.
“Put on your Sunday best when you get home. We’re going out to eat. My treat.”
Seb had barely acknowledged his sub when he returned after the case. Sherlock didn’t say anything about the used condoms he saw in the bin in the loo in their flat, or the cigarette lighter than had been left in the bedroom that wasn’t his. Seb didn’t smoke. It wasn’t that Seb had cheated that bothered him, it was that he was too stupid to even try and hide the evidence.
“—I’ll let you know.” Sherlock told him. John went to the wardrobe and grabbed for some sleep clothes for his sub.
They rounded a bend in the stairs and continued climbing. "He does this thing where he looks at you and can know your life story‒I don't know how he does it, but head's up. Don't let it freak you out. Sorry about all the stairs, mate. Lift's out of order."
It wasn’t just a strange dom though. It was John Watson.
to submit to John. How? Kneel on the floor. John would like that. But then what? How could he get back to the fringe of that sweet space in his head? The one that made him slow and steady, that made his brain calm and quiet, listening to John and genuinely
“Yes, John.” Sherlock left and came back moments later with the white tube. He lay on the bed and almost purred when John popped the tube cap and smoothed the cream into his sore shoulders and bum and thighs.
Sherlock read through the results and pulled out his phone to double check data. Two texts. He ignored them for the moment and thumbed into his soil sample catalog.
“Ow!” The surprise and genuine shock at the sting of it was evident in his tone. The detective looked back at John over his shoulder with alarm shooting through his moon wide eyes.
“Where am I?” He growled.
John's not the only one looking out for Sherlock's well-being.
Sue wandered over to him while he was drawing out circles on wax paper so he could measure the piped dough evenly. He needed two dough circles for each pie pop.
Molly bounced over. "I hope I did it right." She said. "I just whisked everything together and hoped for the best."
John had been pleasantly agreeable to him going off to Minsk for this case. He had given him the crop just because he knew Sherlock liked it—and this was
(See the end of the chapter for
in there, over
“No.” John smiled. “Not for at least twenty fours, love. I’m not risking aggravating the inflammation. I’ll check you again and maybe we’ll have sex later.”
“Oh dear.” She closed the door. “Sherlock, did you upset him?”
He said it so quietly that Sherlock almost thought he misheard him. He glanced at the DI, who looked both amused and slightly worried, like he was afraid Sherlock was going to verbally tear him apart for his comment. He was right though, Sherlock was certain, and his expression softened. John would no doubt sing his praises. That he was even still in Sherlock’s life—and
“What’s it like?” Sherlock asked, “being in Defense?”
John pulled out of his backside and slipped off his cock. Saliva had slopped down his chin and neck and he grabbed a handful of tissues off the desk, spitting everything out and wiping his face. He had mouthwash in the box too for this exact reason and he grabbed it, heading to the loo to swish and spit. Some people found his habit of rinsing right away offensive, but John didn’t care. As far as he was concerned, he had just given an excellent blowjob, so he was entitled to spit and rinse if he wanted.
John opened the cabinet and saw the bottle of pills and a box of tea. He took both down and added water to the kettle, switching it on.
Sherlock has a scare, and they have a discussion on discipline.
“—I need space.” Sherlock stepped away from him and walked down the hall. Everything seemed to hurt. His arm muscles were twitching and the flogger licks were stinging bright on his back and arse. He closed himself in the loo and took a deep breath. He found his red dressing gown hanging on the door and slipped it on, hugging the silk to his body. It felt good to be clothed again and he sat on the closed toilet, just breathing and thinking. That had been awful. He had no idea what John had been thinking. Maybe it was a new plan gone wrong. Maybe it was some sort of punishment for refusing to kneel. Maybe John thought it would be really sexy. He didn’t know and he closed his eyes.
Sherlock turned the hot water on. He felt completely disgusting. He smelled like a cheap hooker and his belly was sticky. His arse was sore as hell from John’s rabid humping last night (not that he was complaining) and he was hungry. John didn’t look or smell much better.
“Did your boss approve of your relationship with Jeff?” Sherlock asked.
John mentally shrugged. Why not? He'd found it best to be accommodating at the start of the evening. Give the easy parts willingly and then some guests might be merciful later if he begged off the really unpleasant stuff.
“S, sorry, sir.” His face flushed.
"Yours or mine?"
“You really like this suit, huh?”
on the door. “Can I come in?” John asked from the other side.
Everyone even vaguely related to Jazz and his dom had been interviewed and picked apart but the stories stayed the same. No one knew who had killed Jazz or why. Lestrade was tearing his hair out and last time John had seen him, he’d looked like he hadn’t slept in about forty years. John was finishing off his ravioli when Sherlock’s phone beeped.
"Bake!"
"A bit?!"
"Ah, of course."
"John." Sherlock said. "I loathe repeating myself."
"Yes, well, in my line of work I am my own master." He threw a flirty look to John across his shoulder and John hummed, delighted. The man smiled and picked up a fresh glass of ale that was placed before them.
John looked up and Greg suddenly wondered if John wasn’t done with him. “He’s not under guard,” Greg said to him meaningfully, “and I hope it can stay that way.”
Here John snorted, recalling Mycroft’s tales of Baby Sherlock’s staff consisting of a day nanny, night nanny, games instructor, tutor, nap consultant, and personal shopper.
What I do know is that a year ago, I didn’t know about John or Sherlock or their portrayers and I wasn’t in a current fandom with so many fun and interesting people. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on a surprise like that because you gave up too soon.
“What good is the experiment if we introduce other variables?” The young detective flung his scarf over his shoulder and prepared to exit his first sexual encounter with a man or anyone for that matter, including himself.
Sherlock’s eyes darted about and his mouth was pursed in that way he had when he was holding in an insult.
“No.” Petulant, panting, and purposefully unrepentant.
While John stroked his curls, Sherlock made several attempts to speak and finally settled on, “I’m cold.”
Sherlock nodded, his glittering eyes following John’s like a baby’s.  “I’ll try.”
Sherlock reappeared, resplendent in baby rabbits, plate and mug in hand. He would not meet John’s gaze. Breakfast was silent except for the occasional groan as a bit of crisp bacon or peach jam tasted of miracles. John unclenched further. A holiday pending with no cases, no Holmes’ family appearance required, no party with friends to be insulted. They had been on case after case nonstop as well as his longer hours at the surgery during cold and flu season. Taking stock, he realized he needed rest, good food, and several shags to make it a proper celebration.
Another jerky nod. “But I ruined it.”
John noticed the room was cooling in temperature. “Sherlock, we need to get on with it.”
Why did she always sound like someone had just smashed a kitten against the wall? “I don’t know where he went. He muttered something about shopping.”
He rested his cheek on the soft, warm bunny laden shoulder; he nuzzled, he grunted, he whimpered. Then he remembered that Sherlock needed a helping hand. His own arousal went up to eleven when he gripped his partner’s cashmere clad cock. Steel wrapped in more warmth and softness. His hand glided; Sherlock shouted encouragement.
John’s voice was equally low. “Fetch the angora, love. The pair.”
“I’ll get the stuff you use when you masturbate.”
Sherlock turned away from John to fold himself into a ball, but John was strong. He hugged Sherlock tight and talked low and quick into his ear. “You aren’t alone anymore. I need you exactly as you are. You can’t be misfit when I need you so much.”
“Three things. Brooding, staring, and destroying my self esteem.”
As they watched the lonely reindeer become a hero, it took all of John’s remaining strength not to let the tears come. He always cried a little over Rudolph but it was Sherlock’s turn this year. Just a few tears since he was mostly cried out, some of the confidence returning to his voice as he said, “I’ll watch it with you again next year, John.”
John could feel the struggle pouring off Sherlock in waves.
He sat with the phone in his hand for a long time before he texted.
John nodded, the “used to” not ironic in the moment.
Very politely. “Yes?”
John was nearly asleep when the tearing sound of Velcro brought him back. Long fingers slipped inside and rubbed across his cheeks and cleft. Sherlock’s afterglow voice rumbled in his ear, “Did they have these in purple?”
“It’s not unpleasant.” Sherlock stood, gazing around the room at crime scene photos pinned to the wall. “Perhaps it takes awhile to have an effect?”
John wasn’t a prude, nor was he adverse to toys, but he and Sherlock had been content for many months with each other’s bodies. They purchased lube at the chemist's and it was enough. One time they had run low and used olive oil and the scent had made for an interesting change, but something was strange about this sudden interest.
He had been standing in front of the clearance display far too long. The sizes decided for him if seventy five percent off did not. They were on sale because they were the off sizes that he needed. Extra long for Sherlock, gray with little pink nosed, long eared bunnies. For himself, pale blue with little yellow chicks. He ignored the label that said extra small; it was a label for height not cock size, but still.
Sherlock was tousled and trusting. John pulled him in as if for a hug, his gorge rising at the cloying motion of open arms. Then with one sharp motion, John ripped open the trap door and unzipped the zip. He pushed a logy Sherlock over the table and spanked the hell out of ass and his own hand. The slaps punctuated an unprecedented speech, John having learned nothing from trying new things. “It’s not…nice…to disobey…Daddy…when he’s…trying to…do the…laundry.”
“I’m afraid intimacy doesn’t work that way. If you are hurting and I’m not being a complete sod, then I hurt with you. What happened? Was it the video?”
But apparently there was another plan in place. John reached for his love to have a proper kiss, but Sherlock reached for a large bag. “I went shopping for us.”
John took his time, took out his phone, and snapped a memory. He trailed his finger around the red heart of Sherlock’s Etch a Sketch ass. “Can you read it, baby?”
“I passed over the candy striped Y fronts, John. I do have some resistance.”
“Nothing you do or say would ever end us.”
“It’s all the same.”
“That’s been rather soundly quenched.”
“Sorry, love,” John said, withdrawing and warming them in his fleecy armpits. “I should have asked first.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The mince pies were out of the oven, golden and steaming on a special tray borrowed from Mrs. Hudson; all the other treats were arranged on the coffee table on little china Christmas plates he had found at a charity shop. He had even used a cozy so that the tea would stay warm throughout the video. He poured tea into his mug, added the milk from a small Santa pitcher, stirred and sipped. It was good.
John pulled his legs up on the bed so he was in front of Sherlock, his face in what he hoped was an attentive and supportive expression.
John Watson had always been out of his mind about Christmas. He started fizzing with it the first of November and clung to it well into Twelfth Night, taking the decorations down at the eleventh hour to squeeze out every last drop of Yuletide.  He baked biscuits and little cakes and made ornaments from tinfoil and played Christmas carols until they lost all meaning.  He had a Santa hat with his name embroidered on it.
“Yes, I can see that. You’re already at half mast.”
“Yes. I got us some peppermint bubble bath and shower gel. You can even wash your hair with it.”
John counted as Sherlock’s bespoke shoes tapped down each of the many steps. The front door opened but then quickly closed. The doctor smiled, thinking that his friend and cock concierge had realized his dishabille and was returning to rectify himself.
Through gritted teeth as he pumped, he made the second best speech of his life. “Naughty boys’ cocks don’t get cashmere. Naughty boys’ cocks get cheap white cotton.”
“I suppose like the rest of me, my nipples are insensitive.”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s legs and buried his face in the soft plush over John’s belly. “I love you,” he mumbled.
“I don’t know. I’m rather nauseous.”
“No,” Sherlock said with a dramatic head turn, arms folded, bum stuck out in a pout, although with so much excess fabric, it was hard to tell. There was a decided sag, a harbinger of the Great and Glorious Bum’s eventual fate. From pert to puckered, from firm to flab, from trim to grim. Glory reduced by gravity.
“I’ll be careful.” Sherlock pulled up and pivoted on his heel. “Come on, John! The game is on!”
"Oh my dear, I'm so sorry…"
"Do you think you deserve cake?" She asked.
“She didn’t do it.” Sherlock hissed.
John watched him stare at the screen and a peculiar expression came over his sub’s face. It was like he’d seen a ghost. John could swear he paled a shade and he slammed out a short reply, then stuffed the machine back in his pocket.
Eure Hoheit! = Your Highness!
“Hello Mrs. H, sorry to bother you. Do you by chance have any clothes pins Sherlock could borrow?”
“What are the rules?”
He knew this would spark Defense and he didn't fancy going into another dom's territory when his sub was injured. He'd found a shop at Charles DeGaulle and bought some Defense suppressants before the flight. He didn't read the label because he was so worried about Sherlock, and thus, didn't know the pills needed to be taken with food.
“Yes.”
Backpfeifengesicht
“You want it on the floor? Fine with me.” Jim said.
“Are you alright, love?” John kissed him.
Mycroft stared at him. "Excuse me, you may be the Prince, but you forget, brother, that I am King."
“It’s a full time job.” He told her.
“Thanks for the tea!” John called.
The big man nodded and waded into the fray, yelling, telling everyone to shut up and take it outside. Sherlock laughed and darted out the front door into the pungent night air.
“You’re hurt. I’m guarding you.” His voice was a little bit deeper than normal and Sherlock shivered. He was similar to how he had been at the cabin, but without the violence this time. Now all that energy was being directed at him and Sherlock found he was bit turned on just from the intensity of it.
Sherlock stared at his shoulder, examining the scar. "Difficult to tell since it occurred so long ago. You're clearly not from wealth. I would guess a gunshot wound but guns are barely available now and even so are available only to the highest buyers, likely they were even more rare when you were a child. Most Hibernians make a living at either farming, fishing, or some sort of mining. Miners your age have obvious signs of it, blackened fingertips, a telltale cough. Your hands are clean enough and you've not coughed once since you've been in this room, so, farming. Again balance of probability states that it could have been a plowing accident or such. Based on the shape of the scar, something long punctured the skin and muscle, but, that's conjecture." He sniffed. "I don't have enough evidence to go further."
"John." His name escaped her mouth in a worried breath.
“Uh, good to see you again.” John nodded at Lestrade, not sure what to say. The officer gave him a lazy salute and a small smile before he turned back to the limbs. John jogged to catch up with his sub. The coroners were now swarming the limbs to pack them into the truck. John trotted after Sherlock, giving the back of his sub’s head a cool glare. The deductions had been brilliant, yes, but his tone and manners and the way he treated Lestrade left a lot to be desired. John was reluctant to give him the tongue-lashing he deserved in front of the people who were essentially his coworkers. Fortunately, they had a flat for that sort of thing.
“Take away?” John asked him pointedly. “Since you can’t sit down?”
just fine.”
“This one.” John said.
For the next few days, John and Sherlock spent most of their time together. John would come over after work shifts and more often than not, spend the night. He didn’t make another attempt at dominance like he had on the sofa so Sherlock’s blood stayed safe in his veins. The detective did have a hell of a time with the infected plague blood though, even freezing some to use later.
“The Latin says, ‘It has flourished beyond expectation.’“
“So much for that ensemble,” the tallest man in the room said. “Once we found the appropriate chemicals, you escalated quite quickly. Well done, John.”
“This isn’t a Christmas gift. It’s part of the romantic evening.“
A pause and rustle.
John had been hugged, snuggled, cuddled, nuzzled, nursed, sucked and slow fucked. Not one for a lot of drama in his sex, he found himself wanting belts, chains, cuffs and a studded collar. He also wanted a big juicy steak rare with a side of rabbit stew and a whole chicken. Sherlock had been deboned.
Sherlock’s eyes were glassy as he petted his own arm. Even the bunnies appeared to be seeking escape, their tiny ears at half mast. Someone had to take the bunny by the horns/ears/balls. John Hamish, Hell Yes, Hamish Watson was that someone. He got up and extended a hand. “Come on, love, up you go.”
The table bounced merrily with each slap. John was as hard as a week old scone. Sherlock was silent but no longer cuddly. Sherlock’s ass, while warm, was not soft. It was a ruby red beacon protruding like a baboon among bunnies. John squeezed that tomato like he was going to cook homemade curry with it. “Will you take them off?”
“I have a present for you. I’ll be ready once your program is finished.”
John was again torn between white rage and grief. He swallowed hard, letting his soldier’s training shut down his own emotion so he could focus on Sherlock.
This year in the beginning, John had been pleasantly surprised at Sherlock’s cooperation with their preparations until he realized that it wasn’t an embracing of a Watson-Holmes Christmas so much as a rejection of the traditional Holmes dinner.  An unfortunate eavesdrop on a Mycroftian phone call of guilt had stung. Sherlock was brilliantly subtle with his mix of truthful resentment about the dinner and his feigned and hesitant embrace of John’s customs.
John Watson hadn’t been able to compromise even a little when Sherlock had prepared an amazing romantic evening as an alternative.
Sherlock growled when he came, and the little rabbits’ ears went from ten and two to five and seven. With a last mighty hump, John pushed the last cloud from the sky and gripped bony hips and laid his stubbled cheek against a razor sharp one.
“No, please continue. I’ve confessed my affections and I’m willing to help you along in any perversion that you fancy. If your suckling becomes tiresome, I’ll simply go to my mind palace.”
They crawled under the table and lay on their sides, blowing clouds into each other’s faces. “If we were seahorses, we just made babies.”
“Can you achieve an erection?”
“I’d like to go again after your refractory period to see if you can beat your previous time. While you rest, I’m going to the shops for more olive oil.” Sherlock shrugged into his coat, oblivious to the fact that he was bare chested.
“Dr. Hooper, would you happen to have an extra consulting detective lurking about down there?”
“That was his perversion, not yours.” Sherlock again looked surprised. “You have to know that. You were a child.”
“I wanted to give you what you needed, John. I tried so hard.“
“But Christmas is still two weeks away.“
John brushed his fingers across Sherlock’s and plunged.  “Your father’s cruelty wasn’t the worst of it.”
After that, Sherlock’s body shut down as if the trauma had just happened. He slept hard, fever driving out more poison, John clutched in his grasp like a teddy bear.  Although John was angry with God, he tried to pray. His grief was too big for the human heart to hold.
But this year was going to be the celebration to end all celebrations, his first official Christmas with Sherlock, together in their own bed in their own flat. They had been starting something the previous year but not enough to carry the weight of a full Watson’s worth of merriment so John had spent it with Harry soused to the gills while Sherlock had ridden with Mycroft to Mummy’s for the dreaded Christmas dinner.  At Sherlock’s return, the flat had been filled with a terrible silence on the consulting detective’s side of things except for random shouted invectives directed at relatives John had never heard of.
Sherlock lifted his free hand to consult his watch, as consulting detectives are wont to do. “You may begin.”
“I know.“ John brushed Sherlock’s tears away but he couldn’t keep up.
The water was cooling so he kissed Sherlock’s shoulder. “Come on, love. Up you go.”
John stopped. He might never hear those words again. “I love you too and I always will.”
John stooped to retrieve the purple shirt that now reminded him of a subdural hematoma that he would like to inflict on a certain consultant of the detective sort. “Like most of your other experiments, this one has gone horribly wrong and something got burned.”
He was on high alert, in the room and grabbing for the remote. “Sherlock, you don’t have to…”
No argument. After he took another bite, Sherlock put the remote in John’s hand and nodded toward the telly. John’s hand shook as he pressed the button.  The story was charged for him now, his own loneliness over the years fading to nothing in the face of Sherlock’s solitary journey. He slipped his hand under the blanket to stroke Sherlock’s bare foot, marveling at the long toes that he could almost twine with his fingers. As if he knew, Sherlock curled his toes inward. John looked up to a tiny smile.
Sweat was dripping off the ends of Sherlock’s curls and his voice was strained. “GET, I think? But then I lost focus.”
“Well you’ve been coddled now on every flat surface of this flat.” A smirk for two flats in a row. “And the wall and the stairs and the tub. Easter, spring, new life, new beginnings. Off, gimme.”
Sherlock shivered violently when John tucked him under the covers as if the promise of warmth had taken his stoicism. “I’ll get that tea now,” John said, smiling and kissing Sherlock’s forehead.
Sherlock’s dark curls appeared around the open door followed by his forehead. With a wink he said, “Next time, let’s dispense with all that business about the nipples. I’ll buy milk while I’m out.”
“Because you are watching him, love. Not because of any decency on his part.”
“Damn right on that.”
Sherlock moved his fingers up and down John’s rodlike protruberance as if he were playing the violin, the calluses he had acquired from said playing had rendered his fingertips nearly insensate but he soldiered on. The deadened skin cells proved to be scratchy against John’s most sensitive skin but the rough treatment appealed to his yet unexplored submissive side. Mostly he was just glad to have someone else’s hand there since his sex life was dryer than the desert of Aghanistan and his bed was colder than the nights in that wartorn country.
“No chickens either for when it’s your turn.  But I do have some pale blue angora.”
“Sometimes but not today.”
Sherlock clutched himself with a manic glance of ‘touch not this baby at my leaking breast.’
The impasse was on day nine with no end in sight. Sherlock had not called or texted or answered calls or texts all day, and John had thirty minutes of down time while pastry dough chilled in the refrigerator beside a quart jar of an unknown black liquid. He was going to watch
“It might help.”
“I can’t tell you, John. It would be the end of us.”
Sherlock waved his hand in a circular motion as if to say get on with it but John Watson got off with it, the ’it’ being his trousers. He had no compunction about peeling off his pants either. and he kicked them under his chair with a festive flick of his foot similar to that of calves in spring cavorting in a meadow.
“Come on, Sherlock, let’s have it. I’m doing laundry and we’ll put these away for next year.”
There was a diva in 221B. “You wouldn’t.”
“A furry red blanket."
“How can I help?”
“If you’re sensitive, you would feel the results instantly.”
“Wait.“ Sherlock hung over the edge of the bed, reaching far under, and produced an elegantly wrapped package.
“This is about pleasure.”
sex but he was getting hotter by the minute. Sherlock kissed him, biting his tongue and lower lip in the process because soft, sweet kisses were so twenty minutes ago.
“What if I touched your penis?”
“No, it’s me. I bring out that behavior in men.”
Sherlock had behaved like a porn star to please John by shopping for novelty potions and toys while his heart was breaking.
He squeezed a little onto his finger and held it out for John. Cool tingly mint teased at John’s tongue, but when he went to share the flavor with a kiss, he got more demonstration.
There hadn’t been any enormous seasonal demands on public or private Sherlock. No, John had kept things very simple for the first time. Decorations but nothing that disturbed experiments or essential piles. Christmas music played quietly, an all orchestral cd featuring strings that John had bought especially. John would attend Christmas eve services alone when he really wanted a hand in his during the prayers, and then presents when he got home after midnight. Dinner for two, which he would cook on Christmas Day. Sherlock had agreed to all of it until John had asked for the one tradition that had never wavered since John Watson’s 18th year, Christmas on his own at university.  Sherlock’s refusal had been absolute.
Sherlock’s whimper reached him as his hand reached for the doorknob. “I’ll give them up, John, but you have to take them off me. I can’t.”
After two hours, Sherlock began to stir, and it occurred to John that he was being given the chance to love the little eleven year old boy inside. He could replace some of the bad memories and maybe reclaim a bit of Christmas for him by babying him. For all of Maddy Watson’s faults, she had made sure that John was hugged and kissed and spoiled rotten when he was sick. John could give Sherlock that full attention and care.  With the wound lanced, he needed to make the rest of the evening about soothing recovery.
John was relieved at the suggestion. It was something active to do, loving but not sexual.
“He always smelled of garlic, but he probably didn’t know because his nostrils were packed with hair. Enormous hairy arms too.”
“Then you’re on your own.”
while eating warm mince pies that he had baked himself.  There was going to be peace on earth and peace in his fucking flat if he had to do it at gunpoint. He called Molly.
Then John’s weary love dodger was bathed in something slick that Sherlock’s hand warmed rapidly as it passed with ease over and over the beleaguered shaft. He was just starting to enjoy himself when an overwhelming urge to eat a Greek salad passed over him with the wafting aroma of garlic scented oil.
