A smirk lit John’s features but he remained silent.
“Da!” Charlie, Greg’s twelve-year-old son cried, swinging the front door open. “Happy Easter!”
“It is,” he conceded with a tilt of his head. “I find you quite attractive, Gregory.”
John hummed in thought. “Not feeling anything extreme, then?”
“Of course,” John said, stooping down and easily hoisting her up.
“Alright, let’s get those potatoes boiling so we can mash them,” Greg said. “Fill the pot with water and put it on the stove, please.”
“How did-?”
“That would be great,” Charlie said.
John looked down at her hand wound in the fabric of his trousers.
“That’s a bit extreme,” Sherlock mumbled.
Mycroft had gone beet red. “That’s quite alright, I don’t mind,” he said. The two men locked eyes, the tension building until it was broken by Jackie’s exclamation of “Da!”
They got to Baker Street just as Mrs. Hudson was waking up.
“Not bad,” he said, putting the mug down.
“So we’re getting these and the purple ones,” John said resolutely. “Liz, would you mind going to Sherlock for a minute?”
“I do not need your help and I do not need to be put into ‘space,” Sherlock hissed at John.
“You say that now,” he said coolly, crossing his arms and looking down at John.
“Ah yes, the fascinating hour of playing with her toys, followed by my reading the Jolly Postman.”
“What now, my dear?” Jackie gave no response. Mycroft looked around and decided that he should put away the shopping that he hadn’t gotten to yesterday.
“Here, for you,” Mycroft said, handing the box to Greg and sitting back in his chair in front of him.
“Harrod’s, please,” he told the driver as he got in the back, holding Jackie securely on his lap.
“Continuing on?” Sherlock asked, eager to be done with the tedious task.
“It’s unclear; generally, the heads of the experiment prefer that submissives live either with their parents or with their dominant relative, which is frankly ridiculous.”
“Wait, this is the Mycroft I’ve heard so little about?” the D.I. appraised him once more, this time for a different reason. Obviously seeing something he liked, he nodded. “Yeah, I see it. Alright, Mr. British Government, we’ll give this one to you. But don’t expect me to hand over all my cases.” Pointing at Mycroft for a second, he walked away to round up his constables.
“She’s gorgeous,” she said, smiling.
After both their drinks had been refreshed, Mycroft started speaking.
“Of course,” Mycroft said, putting his plate in the sink and whisking himself and Jackie out towards their room.
“Sorry,” she said again, tears welling up.
“There you go,” the burly man slid the glass across the counter.
“The lipstick on his collar is from his lover, right before he died. Clearly seducing him, getting him into an alley for ease of killing him. There are hairs from two different kinds of cats, two breeds that generally don’t get along. Two different households that he visits. There’s a significant amount more of one, so he lives with one. There’s also a hamster in that household. One cat belongs to his girlfriend, and one to one of his lovers. How do I know it’s two lovers and not one? A woman wearing that shade of lipstick wouldn’t own a cat. Three women, then. And the stain on his left knee. Clearly, he went down on one knee tonight. I think he was proposing to his girlfriend. The lover, jealous, kills him in a fit of rage. Crime of passion. Boring.” Sherlock shrugged.
Getting into the flat, Greg turned on the light and took off his coat, hanging it absently on the hooks by the door. He was the first one home but he hadn’t gotten a text from Mycroft, which meant he should be home shortly.
The man took it, rubbing his mouth with his hand. “Thanks,” he said, brandishing the card with a nod before tucking it in his breast pocket. As they walked away, John started shaking and Sherlock looked over at him, worried. He quickly got over his concern when he realized John was suppressing giggles.
“Eight,” they nodded together.
John rubbed his hand up and down Sherlock’s back once before giving him another five hits with the paddle. Sherlock wiggled and writhed as the deep ache sunk deeper into his bones. He took a deep breath and let it out shakily, floating gently inside his own head. He could feel his muscles trying to relax all at once as the assault on his ass stopped.
“Successful flat hunting?”
“Alright, if you insist.” He put her on her feet, watching her run back towards the kitchen where Mycroft and the kids were. Greg followed her, smiling at the sight of Mycroft peeling potatoes at the counter, Charlie and Alice sat on the benches watching him and keeping up a constant chatter.
“Here love,” he said, gently pulling Sherlock’s thumb out of his mouth and replacing it with the pacifier. “Now you’ll have both hands available to clean faster,” John grinned at his unimpressed expression and kissed him on the forehead. He went back over to the changing table, picking up the last of the supplies and putting them in their rightful place. Thankfully, none of the cream or powder had spilled, so it was a rather quick clean up.
“Who are in no more danger than they ever are. And frankly, who I see so rarely they’re really not in any danger.” His ex-wife had gotten custody in the divorce and he got them every weekend and on holidays. “I won’t be able to take them this weekend. And I won’t be at my job.”
Mycroft, meanwhile, was sitting on the sofa, waiting to hear Greg still. When he didn’t hear any more tossing and turning from the bedroom, Mycroft stood and went to the kitchen. He knew exactly where Greg kept the liquor and he took out the bottle of scotch he had gotten Greg for their one-month anniversary. He could replace it later. Moving back into the sitting room, Mycroft sat on the sofa and took a long sip from the bottle, reflecting on the hellish day he had had. As he re-watched the three innocent men fall to their death, he took another long pull from the bottle. In those two drinks, he had already consumed about a third of the bottle.
“The Easter bunny came!” Alice shrieked when she saw Mycroft.
“Such as?” John could feel the annoyance start to build back up behind his eyes.
“Just thinking ahead,” Greg said. They spent the rest of the ride watching the countryside slowly disappear to reveal a small town. It was slightly larger than most of the tourist towns that Greg had seen, big enough to have a chain-store grocers, but not much else. Jackie sat quietly in Greg’s lap, watching the trees flash by beside them. Mycroft navigated what seemed to be familiar streets, parking and exiting the vehicle. Greg followed suit, fishing the diaper bag out of the back seat and slinging it on his shoulder.
Getting up, Sherlock crept to the door, which was closed. Slowly turning the handle, Sherlock cracked the door open and peered in. He was met with the sight of John on the bed, the sheets tangled around his legs at the end of the bed. His arms were thrown above his head and his face was twisted, grunts breaking through his gritted teeth.
“Sorry, your brother?”
“This is Liz,” John said, smiling down at her. “She’ll be staying with us for a while.”
“Liz, can you tell me what happened last night?”
“It’s me,” John greeted. “Is there any way we could come down to the ministry and help out somehow?” He listened for a moment. “Great, be there in a tick.” He pulled the phone from his ear.
“It’s not for your sake that I’m asking you to leave the room. Now go. Please.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes but didn’t argue as he swept to the table, scooped up John’s bag and swanned out the door. “Alright, here’s the deal,” John said over Jackie’s distress. She had stopped pushing at Mycroft and was now sobbing into his chest. “You do not go Iceman on this baby, alright? She is depending on you for emotional support and you need to teach her how to express those emotions in a healthy way and I have no doubt that you will be able to do it and do it well but you can’t go cold on her, got it?” John now had his finger about an inch from Mycroft’s face.
“Wow!” Mycroft said. “And I see he left chocolate eggs for you and Charlie,” he continued.
“Ah, hello John. No, unfortunately the Trace is only put on young witches or wizards after it is brought to the Ministry’s attention that they exist. It takes a few weeks for the Trace to be implemented, and Liz’s hasn’t been placed yet.”
“Thank you.” Sherlock fidgeted unconsciously, not sure how to take the compliment. John squeezed his hand comfortingly.
They pulled up to New Scotland Yard and got out, Sherlock practically sprinting out of the cab. He burst through the front doors and quickly made his way to the D.I..’s office. D.I. Nolan was already there, starting on the paperwork for the case.
“Thank you,” Sherlock murmured. “Home?”
“Going to my own room,” Mycroft said weakly, still trying to get out of bed.
“Is that it? You’re worried about what to call us?” John asked when Liz didn’t answer.
“No, Liz, look at us please.” John felt Liz shake her head against his neck. “Liz, come on, you’re okay. We’re not angry, we were just worried about you.”
“Do you have an activity you like to do?”
“Anytime, dear.” Sherlock was already waiting in the car by the time Mycroft got in.
“Something for me and Jackie to do all afternoon, then,” Greg corrected with a smile.
“You can come under the blankets,” Mycroft said.
Sherlock jerked awake a few hours later. Cursing, he rubbed his face roughly before stilling. He could hear a faint whimpering coming from the guest bedroom.
Mycroft took a moment to examine the contents of the nappy. “I wouldn’t say so, no.”
“Having magic isn’t all that bad,” John tried to appease her. He put his wand back in the pocket of his dressing robe and followed the dishes into the kitchen.
“Yes, I have every faith he’ll be good with her. He seems more committed than I dared hope.”
“Yes well, I figure it’s best not to lie. If you found out, you would punish me and since we are literally discussing, among other things, ways for you to punish me, I thought that honesty would be the best policy.”
A few minutes later, John stuck his head out of the doorway. “Swaddled?”
“Lectures for misbehavior.”
“Okay. Ready?” Greg asked Mycroft.
The little girl said nothing, just looked up at both of them with wide eyes. She was emaciated, dark hair plastered to the side of her face and bones jutting out from her overly large t-shirt. Dark bruises littered her arms and legs, peeking out from beneath the hem of her shirt and the thin shorts she was wearing. Her thin arms were wrapped around her knees, which were shoved up to her chest.
Sherlock was more preoccupied with the cauldrons, humming at a particular glass one the size of a small bowl.
“Night, Sherlock.” John slowly made his way up the stairs and into the bedroom.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock answered blurrily.
“Cool, thanks!” he said, going and hugging both Mycroft and Greg.
Ultimately, it was Sherlock’s height that helped them out. “There!” he said after a couple minutes of craning over other people’s heads, pointing and pushing his way past the throngs of people and towards the entrance to the Guards. John was hot on his heels, and soon they had reached her. Liz was pressed into a corner of the entarnce, sobbing, while an older woman was bent down beside her talking to her.
“I’m so bored,” he whined.
Greg furrowed his brow. “But I do like you, I like you a-“
“I can, and that is the plan if Mycroft moves out. Worse comes to worse, he’s said I can move in with him and Lestrade but I’d really rather not.”
“May I help you?” One eyebrow shot up.
**********************************************
“Goodbye, Mummy,” Mycroft said. “Thank you for the cake.”
“What’s my other option? It’s not like you’ll let me walk out on my own.”
There was a loud clanking as they reached the lifts and a golden grille slid back, allowing them to enter. They got into the lift with three other witches and wizards and a handful of flying memos. Anthea pressed the button for the first floor.
“That’s a poop face,” Greg said decisively.
She grabbed onto the bar in front of her, slamming her fists onto it a couple times and giving Mycroft a small smile. It was the first time she had smiled at him, and Mycroft smiled back, looking around at the signs and heading towards the children’s section. He quickly headed to the big items, picking out the best crib, pram and car seat, as well as a black leather changing bag and plain front-carrying papoose. He also picked out various three-packs of muslin, one with jungle animals, one with elephants and one with raindrops on them. He also picked out a Burberry check sleep bag, a change mat, a baby bath, several baby towels and a bath wrap that looked like a bear. An assortment of baby body washes, shampoos and conditioners followed, and he determined that he would experiment and determine the best brand. Other essentials including several jumbo boxes of diapers, numerous tins of formula and a bottle of baby paracetamol later, and Mycroft figured they had finished the practical side of their shopping. He quickly arranged with a sales associate to have all the large items shipped to his flat that day.
“Yes, what colour of throw should we put on the sofa?” Mycroft asked, seeming not to notice the edge in Greg’s voice.
“Really?”
“Whoa, there I didn’t mean to offend. I just meant he doesn’t eat much either.”
“So, was that the first word she said?” Greg asked after they had both taken a sip.
“We can pick that one up, too. We’ll read it together.” John stood and ran his hand over Liz’s head. “Liz, I’m going to go look at the Healer books right over there.” John pointed to a shelf a few bookshelves down that was still in sight. “I want you to stay here with Rose and keep looking at books. I won’t be out of sight, alright?”
“May I?” Mycroft asked, gesturing inside.
“Holmes,” Mycroft answered hoarsely.
Sherlock grumbled for a moment. “Well if I must get punished, that is one way I don’t object to,” Sherlock said. “It is not something I enjoy, however. I would put it at a one.”
“Well yeah, but we could rebel. I’m sure there’s enough of us we could cause a stir.”
“What did you say?” Mycroft asked softly.
“Very funny, Gregory.”
“Hey,” he murmured, reaching over and taking Mycroft’s hand. “Mycroft, can you hear me?”
“Liz, do you remember last night when I asked you if you were hurt?” Liz nodded. “And you shrugged, which I thought meant that you weren’t hurt.”
“Beer, Gregory, really?” Mycroft asked. Greg’s smile dimmed slightly.
“This I not a one to ten scenario,” Evangeline interrupted. “It’s a straight question. How often do you have sex?”
“Kay,” she said, patting Greg on the nose.
“Like you could stop me,” Sherlock scoffed, pushing himself into an upright position.
“Got everything?”
“Thank you,” John said, taking Sherlock’s hand and leading him outside. On their way out they watched a black car pull up in front of the house and saw Mycroft step out of the car.
"So I'll send care instructions to Anthea to pass along to you?" Marcia asked, a grin lighting up her features.
“You are most welcome,” Mycroft said stiffly, leaning over to pick up his copy of the adoption forms. He turned to fetch his umbrella from beside the door and, as he picked it up, he felt a pair of small arms wrap firmly around his waist.
“Doesn’t look like poison,” Sherlock rattled off absently, not hearing John. “I don’t see any signs of contusions or injury of any kind. Have Molly send me the tox screen A.S.A.P. John, ready to go?”
“But why?” Sherlock whined.
“Stay still!” John wrapped one arm around Sherlock’s waist, holding him in place. “Now, I’m going to spank you until I feel you’ve learned your lesson. No need to count.” Without waiting for an answer, John let his hand fall in a measured rhythm onto Sherlock’s trouser-covered backside. John had never had to punish Sherlock with a spanking before, corner time usually doing the trick. Although spanking was in their contract as an acceptable form of punishment, John kept a sharp eye on how his boy was reacting.
“Are you just asking me so that you don’t have to move in with your brother and Lestrade?” Sherlock had received an ultimatum from the heads of the experiment- either find a dom to live with in the next two months, or live with Mycroft until he found one.
“Cute!” she squealed. “I’ll have your drinks right out.”
“Look Jackie.” Mycroft showed her the cow once more. “Coooow.”
“He’s coming to find me, actually.”
“That would be great, Mrs. H, ta,” John answered. She bustled back downstairs and John ushered Liz further into the flat motioning her towards the sofa. “I’m just going to put the kettle on, I’ll be right back,” he told her. She nodded and looked over at Sherlock.
“Not at all.” Greg bounced Jackie in his arms. “Shall we go in?” Mycroft dug out a keyring, unlocking the door and turning on the light. The light revealed a rustic one-floor cabin, equipped with modern electrics, a television in the sitting room visible from the front entrance and comfortable looking furniture.
“Of course not. I’ll be right over.” With that he hung up, not giving Mycroft the chance to go back on his decision.
“Yeah, I’m working at both Bart’s and Mungo’s.”
“Yes, we will.” Turning back, Mycroft quickly gathered the diaper bag and discarded papousse and motioned for the doctor to lead the way. The three of them followed her in silence until they reached a closed door. When Dr. Michaels opened the door, she revealed a pale, sleeping Sherlock stretched out on a crisp, clean hospital bed.
“There you go,” she said, handing the Tupperware container to Mycroft with a kiss on the cheek.
“Yes, we’ll go get you some food,” Greg chuckled. Picking her up, Greg went to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle and enough snacks for the afternoon for both him and Jackie. Then he went to the sitting room and grabbed toys for Jackie and books for both of them. Carrying it all, he went back into his room, sitting on the chair again and giving Jackie the bottle. She happily sucked it back, dropping the bottle onto Greg’s lap when she was done with it. Greg gave her a digestive cracker to munch on, which she did happily. Halfway through, she offered the mushy cracker to Greg.
“Of course you do, don’t be ridiculous,” Mycroft said. “But look inside the box. There’s another piece.”
“Yes, John,” Sherlock hummed. “Although I don’t want you bossing me around all the time.”
“They hoped to create two types of people- those who were dominant and those who were submissive. In creating these two distinct types of people, they hoped that the population would be genetically predisposed to working together more amicably.” Sherlock felt his stomach sinking to his knees.
“Well, Mycroft and I aren’t married, sir, but he is my partner’s brother, yes.”
“Sure,” Greg said slyly, watching as Mycroft did exactly that. He poured their coffee, buttered his slices of toast and spread jam on Mycroft’s. Dropping the mugs and plates in front of their chairs, Greg sat at the table. Mycroft joined him there, Jackie on his lap. Keeping her in the circle of his arms, Mycroft ripped a bite-sized piece of toast from one slice and handed it to Jackie, who stuck it happily in her mouth.
“I don’t know, the same as Rose or Albus I suppose,” she shrugged. “I wouldn’t mind being in Gryffindor, like Da and Hermione and Ron and Harry.”
“Maybe not, but doms definitely still need the attention, it’s just a different kind. We crave the attention and trust of our subs the way you want to give us that submission. And personally, I would be obedient to anything my sub asked, but that’s just basic human decency. And someone kissing my foot would be a little strange, frankly.”
“I’ve got to keep an eye on the stove,” Greg said, motioning to the kitchen. They looked at each other for a few moments, tension steadily building. Then, with a small quirk of his lips, Greg turned and went back to the kitchen.
“We do,” John said softly as he snapped up Rosie’s baby-gro and lifted her up. Rosie fussed in John’s arms. “Hungry, my love?”
Next thing he knew, he was being awoken by a loud rustling. Opening his eyes, Greg saw Mycroft propped up on one arm, trying to throw off the covers and get out of bed.
“Oh good, you made it through,” John said, accepting the pouch of Floo powder from Sherlock and slipping it in his pocket. John moved to a larger table, sitting down and pulling Liz down onto the chair beside him.
“The more you know,” Greg said as they entered the store, the smell of baby powder and lightly scented products thick in the air.
“She’s looking good,” John noted as he handed her over.
“He’ll love that,” Greg said sarcastically.
“Now! Seven minutes in the corner, and then we’ll talk. While you’re there, I don’t want to see you moving, and I want you to think of why you’re in the corner, and how you will avoid being there in the future.” John gave him a glare that said he meant business.
“Why?” Although they had done impact play, it had only ever been as punishment and only as a secondary to lectures and other non-violent punishments.
“And how does that make you feel?”
“How about a break?” he asked, scratching Sherlock’s scalp lightly.
“That was a Galleon, correct?” Sherlock asked as the waitress walked away.
“Good boy, thank you for your help,” John said, taking Sherlock’s hand. “Now, let’s go get you into a nice bath.”
They were at it again two weeks later, on one of the rare evenings they were both free. This time they were at a significantly larger flat with a sitting room, a master bedroom, a guest bedroom and two bathrooms. Slick mahogany covered the floor, providing a counter point to the stainless steel lining the kitchen. It was all very slick and new and very much to Mycroft’s liking.
“What? Why not? That’s ridiculous.”
Sherlock hummed and shrugged.
“Can’t a man get a little caffeine in him first?” he asked with a chuckle, obediently opening the nappy and peering inside.
“Yes, sir. Would you like me to come with you?”
“You don’t even have to talk to anyone if you don’t want to,” Sherlock said. “We’ll be here right at twelve, alright? We promise.”
“Where was John?”
“Flowers, hm?” John asked. “They’re cute.” John spotted them on a rack and pulled out a size he thought would fit Liz. He handed the robes to Sherlock to be added to his pile. Sherlock looked insulted at being turned into a shopping cart, but didn’t verbally complain.
“She started screaming,” an older male worker said, “and it sounded like something from another world. Like the gates to Hell had opened up and all it’s creatures were being let loose.”
“What for?”
Sorry I've kind of gone AWOL, I went to Disneyworld on vacation and then I moved across the country, so it's been a stressful month. But now I'm jobless for another two weeks, and classes don't start until October, so hopefully I'll be writing a little more! Thanks for reading and sticking with it!
“What is it?” Mycroft asked, his face carefully neutral.
“It’s the first separation we’ve had from her since acquiring her. It’s bound to be strange.”
“I have no doubt. It’s just what I do.” Here John paused, carefully choosing his words. “For everyone and anyone. It’s what I’ve been genetically engineered to do, I suppose.”
“Please.” Sherlock slid the glass across the counter. He quickly received his drink and turned around, scanning the room for the least populated area. Spying a spot across the room, Sherlock took another fortifying sip of his whiskey and started towards the spot. He made his way across the room, weaving his way through small knots of people. As he was breaking through the last wall of bodies, a heavy hand landed on his shoulder and stopped him in his tracks. Sherlock looked at the hand on his shoulder and followed it up to its owner, a burly bull of a man.
“Yes, I gathered as much,” Mycroft said drily.
“Don’t be smart,” Sieger warned.
“Is that the only reason you don’t eat, Mr. Holmes?”
“Yes,” Mycroft sighed, knowing it wouldn’t be fun when the time came. “Anthea, I’m sure you have more important things to be doing. Thank you for bringing me the information.”
Liz nodded. “Lights. In the dark. Threw a toy once. On accident.”
“How do you feel about that?”
“No, but there’s something motivating you and it’s not loyalty to the project. If it’s not money, what else could it be?” he mused aloud. “Family?” he noticed her hands tightening imperceptibly where they were clasping the legs of the chair. “That’s it. Have they threatened your family? Or made you a promise?” He saw her eyes widen marginally and she looked away from him. “A promise. Of what, a family? A baby? Ah yes, that’s it, they promised you a baby from their experiment.” He could tell that she was a single woman in her early thirties. She wanted a baby, but knew she wouldn’t be in a relationship any time soon. “My baby, perhaps?”
John noted it on the paper. “Age play.”
“This scene will be focused on you and your pleasure. To start, I’d like you to come over here and bend over my knee.” Mycroft sat in his chair and waited patiently as Greg came and bent over Mycroft’s knee, grabbing onto his ankle. Mycroft gently repositioned him so that Greg’s cock was rubbing against his leg. “Because this is our first time doing this, I will only be giving you fifteen. I expect you to count and thank me.”
“Explain.”
“And what if that was one of my kinks that you mindlessly mocked? Then what?”
“Sure.” They made their way to the coffee shop without further incident and spent the following hour chatting, learning more about each other. John insisted on paying and Sherlock got tired of arguing, and so allowed him to pay.
“Nice to meet you Liz. I’m John.”
“Perfect.” Mycroft wrote down a few more notes. “You’ve also noted a few times here that you like to feel pretty.” Mycroft smiled indulgently at Greg and raised an eyebrow. “I would very much like to help you there. That does mean that during some scenes I would choose what you wear, such as corsets or sexy clothes, which would be considered having clothes chosen for you. You have marked that as a soft limit here.”
“Do you mind if I take off your shirt?”
Greg paused for a moment, thinking. “Can you hold on a moment?” Greg asked.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, looking at John and squeezing his hand. “Can I feed her?”
“Right,” Sherlock said. Three goblets drifted towards them, and John plucked one out of the air, saluting to the barkeep before taking a sip. Liz reached forward with both hands and grabbed one of the goblets. Sherlock picked the remaining one out of the air, carefully taking a sip.
John, who had been enjoying a rare quiet afternoon with a book, looked up at his partner. Sherlock was draped across the sofa, head hanging off one of the armrests.
“Look, we’re contract workers. We don’t ask questions, we are approached by anonymous offers.”
“Sort of floaty,” Sherlock said, letting his head loll to the side so he had a clear view of John.
“Now why would I ruin the surprise?” Mycroft asked, cocking an eyebrow in return.
Sherlock huffed and slammed the folder down onto the sofa, flinging himself up and stomping to the corner. When he got there he crossed his arms.
Mycroft pulled the menu towards himself, scanning quickly down it. There wasn’t much to choose from- there was one salad, four sandwiches, two soups, three pasta dishes and chicken fingers to choose from.
Hi guys! This one has been written up for a while, but my dad was visiting and I didn't have time to post it. I've got half of the next chapter ready, so that should be coming soon. Warnings for mild torture/violence, really just Mycroft punching a lady. If you don't like violence, you can move on to the asterixes. The important info Mycroft finds is reiterated there.
“Quite.”
Sara glared at him, jaw set determinedly. Mycroft ran his eyes over her, trying to deduce the best way to get information from her. She was strong-willed, he could see that very clearly. In her body language he saw a willingness to suffer for the cause she was working for, but also a hesitation. She clearly wasn’t willing to die for the cause, and in that Mycroft found a weakness.  But he knew he would have to wear her down before breaking her.
“What, are you drinking tea or a candy bar?” John joked as he turned back into the kitchen.
“We’re hungry,” Greg said, making puppy-dog eyes at Mycroft. “Can we stop for lunch?”
“Only because I’m sad you had to go through that, love. And I’m sad I almost lost you, but I’m also so glad that I can hold you here tonight. I’m so glad I didn’t lose  you, Mycroft. You are so important to me. I love you.” It became a litany as Greg kissed every inch of Mycroft’s face, words interspersed between the kisses. Mycroft wrapped his arms around Greg and let his kisses wash away some of the guilt and sadness that had been ravaging him all evening. His breathing slowed and he finally closed his eyes, seeing only darkness behind his lids. They both knew this wouldn’t be the end, not for a long time, but Mycroft was content in the knowledge that with time and the help of Greg, he could get through anything.
Liz’s eyes widened and she dropped the crayon she was holding, reaching out to grab both John and Sherlock.
“Ah, typical older sibling then.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Greg said. Both he and Sherlock were looking at the ceiling for some clue as to what had made the body fall.
“Time to change her,” Greg said with a chuckle. Huffing, Mycroft got a changing pad out of the diaper bag, quickly picked Jackie up and laid her on her back on the pad, pulling down the tiny jeans and unbuttoning the onesie. He took off the soiled diaper, pausing only for a moment to check its contents before folding it up and putting it beside her on the mat. He finished up efficiently, getting her back in her clothes and throwing the diaper out in the small garbage in the room. He folded the mat back up and put it back in the diaper bag after sitting Jackie back on the bed.
“I’m working at a clinic part time,” he told Evan.
“Oh, Liz,” John sighed, giving up for the moment. He reached forward and cradled her to his chest, sitting so that she was curled up in his lap. “It was a tough morning, I know.”
Sherlock stared balefully at John for a moment but, when he realized he would not win, slowly unfolded his arms and let them fall to his sides. He could feel his lips trying to tug downwards as he watched John, waiting for the recognition to light his eyes.
Sorry this one has taken a while to get up, my best friend has been in town the whole week so I haven't had time to do anything. ENJOY!
“Why don’t you start on your toy box?” John asked, walking over to the nappy supplies and starting to put them back in place. As he did, he opened the top drawer on the changing table and pulled out a spare pacifier, walking over to Sherlock.
“Yeah, sounds good.” John took Sherlock’s phone and stared at it for a minute. “Um, maybe I’ll get you to punch in my number.”
Mycroft walked to his bedroom, picking up his cellphone and choosing Gregory in his contacts. Bringing the phone up to his ear, Mycroft listened to the phone ring twice.
“We have already had this discussion,” John said.
Sherlock pulled out of Greg’s grip. “Do not tell me what to do.”
Sherlock smiled. “Goodbye.”
“Aren’t you always getting annoyed at my prying? Here’s your chance to fend for yourself. I’ll find you later,” Mycroft promised.
Soon, Sherlock was floating happily in subspace, on the verge of falling asleep.
“Mycroft will take care of it,” Sherlock said from beside him. “I assume we’ll be taking the child?”
“We’ll go shopping soon and get a whole bunch of things to try. Does that sound like fun?”
“Yes, that’ll suit you just fine,” Sherlock nodded sagely.
Greg sighed in defeat. “Sorry,” he said to the realtor who was politely waiting by the door. “It doesn’t look like this is the one.”
Sorry I haven't posted in a long time, I haven't had a day off in two months so it's been me sitting in small spurts to try to get this out. I can't promise it'll get any better for the next few months, but I haven't forgotten this story, I promise!!
“When we get home,” John answered. He knew Sherlock wasn’t in immediate danger.
"Alright, can you lay her on your lap for me?" Mycroft placed one hand carefully behind Jaclynn's head, lowering her slowly so that she was on her back. "Good. Now, it does appear she's running a fever so I'll just grab a thermometer and put it under her armpit, yes that's a good girl you be good and don't squirm. Alright, yes indeed that's a fever higher than we would like so I'll just grab a cold compress here and if you could hold it to her forehead, yeah she's not going to like that," she switched fluidly in and out of baby talk as she handed the compress to Mycroft and continued her examination. "Alright, love, I don't feel any unusual lumps or swelling anywhere, you've probably just got a cold. She's got a bit of a runny nose that I don't think is from her crying, so that's something to keep an eye out for. I'd say pick up some baby paracetamol and I’ve got some ORS that you can give her alongside her formula to help with the dehydration. Have her take it easy for the next couple days. You are planning on taking her, sir?" Marcia asked innocently.
“Please, John, have a little faith.”
“What the bloody hell happened?” Greg reiterated as he approached them.
Greg held out his hand to Sherlock. “Nice to meet you.”
“I see what you mean,” Mycroft conceded.
“Yeah, I got here seconds before you did, I haven’t had the time to change her yet.” Greg moved towards the changing table. Mycroft watched as Greg laid Jackie down on the table and unsnapped her baby-gro, conflict roiling inside him. He was still protective of Jackie but knew that Gregory was one of the few people he could trust with her.
“I’m not tired. I’ll stay here in case she needs help.”
“Sir?” he heard the agent ask from a distance. Dimly he realized he was about to lose consciousness and bent his knees, trying to lessen the distance between him and the floor. A last lance of pain cut through his thigh and his last thought was of how angry Gregory was going to be.
“I’ll see you downstairs,” Mycroft said with a nod to Sherlock, suddenly embarrassed at his display of affection. Sherlock didn’t answer, swinging his legs off the bed and staring at the floor until Mycroft left. Then he roughly rubbed his face with both hands and let out a bodily sigh.
“Please Sherlock, Mummy and Daddy are worried. It’s been two hours and you haven’t been responding to them.”
“Thanks, Charlie. Alice and Jackie, would you like to toss the salad?”
“Pardon?” Mycroft asked.
“Because they’re beautiful,” John answered softly. “And they’re so far away, but we can still see them.”
“Thirteen months,” Mycroft responded, inserting his card in the chip and pin machine.
“Mycroft Holmes. How is my brother?” he asked, shaking her outstretched hand.
Thank you for reading, sorry I haven't been posting regularly but real life has got me in a stranglehold.
When he walked in, Sherlock was knuckling his eye.
“Yes, thank you, “ Mycroft said, sitting across from Greg at the table and sitting Jackie on it. “I did tell you that you needn’t come of you were busy,” Mycroft reminded him coolly.
he quickly replied.
They were just getting back from a case, one that had ended with Sherlock diving into a muck-filled river after a criminal. Despite his heroic act, he had missed the criminal and Lestrade’s crew had picked her up on the other side of the river. That left John to fish Sherlock out and drag him back home; the cab ride had been a silent one. John was unimpressed with Sherlock’s lack of self-preservation as well as his current attitude.
“Good,” John said. “I’m going to put the box away and I’ll be right back, alright?”
“What don’t you like?” Greg asked, exasperated.
“Alright everyone, dig in,” he said with a smile around the table, passing plates around. Everyone loaded up their plates, save Sherlock who only took a small helping of mashed potatoes and ham. Mycroft cut up bite-sized pieces of ham and carrots, putting them on the tray of Jackie’s booster seat. She picked up the pieces between two fingers, putting them in her mouth and humming happily.
“And what do they usually say, then?”
“Mmm, yes?” Sherlock mumbled, face half buried in the bed he was awkwardly bent over.
“Yellow,” he said around a sigh, standing and facing John. “I’m stuck in my head.”
“Alright, little one. Once I’m done this we’ll take a break.” And Mycroft got back to work, building the crib with less difficulty. He made sure to keep an eye on Jackie, who crawled over to him at one point and sat beside him, watching him assemble her crib.
“Anything look good?” John asked Liz. Sherlock, who had followed behind them, pulled out a set of small deep purple robes.
“Right over this way!” she said, heading down an aisle confidently. She stopped in front of a small, tilting bookshelf that was crammed full of colourful books of all sizes.
“Yeah, not really my concern at the moment,” he answered, looking pointedly at the bundle of skin and bones currently cradled in his arms. “I might also have a theory about all of this.”
“Maybe.”
“Again, this is our first one. We can choose out another one together, but I thought this would be a good start.”
“Of course,” John said, moving forward and holding out his hands. Mycroft lifted Jackie out of the papousse, handing her to John as he worked himself out of the straps. When he had gotten the holder off and placed it on a chair, he took Jackie back from John.
“Okay, then, what about favourite book?”
“Here love dish up, don’t be shy,” his mother gushed, spooning out heaps of mashed potatoes onto Sherlock’s plate. Sherlock sat silently while his mother filled his plate.
“Hi, Hermione,” he stood and walked over to them, hugging Hermione quickly and giving Ron a handshake. “Ron.”
“Yeah, well three against one isn’t fair odds for anyone,” John answered. “I’m John. We met briefly last time?”
There is a gathering held for all the members of the experiment, with the goal of facilitating the finding of everyone's soulmate.
“Why isn’t he in hospital?” Greg asked as he watched her, frustrated that there was nothing he could do to help.
Liz nodded hesitantly, turning back to the telly. She stuck her thumb into her mouth and leaned back into John, relaxing. Sherlock sat beside them, arm reaching out so that it was extended across the back of the sofa. They stayed like that all afternoon, Liz always holding on to one of them.
“Yeah,” Greg answered, leaning once more towards Mycroft.
“Open it,” Mycroft prompted softly. Liz did as instructed, carefully taking the locket out of the box and prying it open. Inside on the left was a moving picture of Sherlock ,and on the right was a picture of John. They were both candids, neither of them looking into the camera but rather smiling off into the distance. John wasn’t sure how Mycroft got the pictures, but wasn’t about to question the lovely gift.
She nodded her head.
“Alright Alice, you next,” Greg said and Alice opened her present with almost as much vigor as Jackie. She revealed a coloring book and new set of coloring pencils.
"The info is in the pocket in my shirt," Mycroft told Anthea, nodding at the shirt in question, still laying on the floor. Anthea quickly retrieved the sheets of paper, tucking them into her own shirt. The thermometer beeped and Marcia pulled it out, glancing down at it. "Fevers gone down considerably. Probably all that crying spiked it as well. I'd say you're both clear to go, and Anthea, I'll be sending you instructions to pass on to Mr. Holmes on the care and keeping of a baby."
“Okay, thanks,” Greg said.
“My sentiments exactly,” Sherlock replied, putting the bag on the counter as they entered the kitchen.
“She had a cold when I first got her, but recovered normally and since then nothing out of the ordinary has happened.” He hated the inane chatting but needed to know as much as possible about what was running through his child.
“Of course you do,” Greg said. “And you will always have it. Now, do we want to move this to a more comfortable place than the bathroom floor?”
“So it would seem.”
“I don’t like it,” he said with finality.
“Whatever you are going to say to my brother, you can say in front of me. I’m not a child.”
“So, will you move in with me?”
“Sherlock, what’s your colour?”
Liz looked up at them with wide eyes.
Greg was woken again by rustling sheets.
“Well then we can make the beds and open the shutters. Nothing to it, and we’ve got a whole afternoon to fill.”
“Coffee?”
“Well that’s handy then.” Greg poured himself another. “You’re good for her, you know?” When Mycroft didn’t answer, he continued. “Although this was sort of thrust upon you, you’ll make a wonderful father. You already are, and it’s only been a few days. Trust e, you are the best thing that could have happened to that baby.” Mycroft still didn’t answer, but his eyes got embarrassingly misty and he nodded. “So how was work this afternoon?” Greg asked to clear the tension, noticing his tongue getting a little heavier with the drink.
“Well, tough shit. If you don’t want to talk to me you don’t have to, if you don’t want to LOOK at me you don’t have to, but damn if I’ll let you be on your own.” Greg was trying to reign in his anger, knowing that Mycroft had already been through enough. Mycroft stared blankly out the window of the car, watching London slip by. They rode the rest of the way in silence, Greg pulling up to his flat. He got out, walking to the passenger side and opening the door for Mycroft. “Come on, love,” Greg soothed, reaching in to help Mycroft out. He took Mycroft’s hand in his own, and was shocked when Mycroft ripped his hand out of Greg’s.
“Not too bad for our first time, yeah?” John asked, laying a kiss on top of Sherlock’s head.
“How do I know you won’t lie?” she asked, gasping.
“I threw a vase,” Liz whispered, softly, the odd hiccup piercing her words. “Mummy put me in the closet for two days. I too loud. I eat too much. I not smart. I make things happen then Mummy gets angry.” She paused for a moment, hands tightening in Sherlock’s shirt as a sob broke through. “I hurt Mummy. I bad.”
“Of course.” Sherlock nuzzled into John’s neck. “Can we just cuddle now?”
he texted back after a moment, craning his neck to look at his brother’s door.
Mycroft smiled down at his phone, pleased that Greg was seeking him out.
When they arrived, Sherlock flounced into the building and left John to follow. He held the door open for John at the top of the stairs, which earned him a quick word of thanks, followed by a brisk shove up against the wall and John’s lips crashing onto his. John made quick work of shedding both their coats and scarves, never breaking their kiss.
“Good to know. I’m not all that into leather, but I’ll see what I can do. Leather restraints?”
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock stood and as he passed John, he squeezed his hand. John took Sherlock’s place on the sofa, slinging his arm around the back. There was a bright pink cartoon pig on the screen.
“You don’t have to call us father if you don’t want to, Sherlock and John are fine,” Sherlock said, seeming to sense Liz’s dilemma.
“And you are a divorced police officer with three kids you only see on weekends and holidays?”
“Better than yours, I imagine. You spent the night on the sofa, didn’t you?”
“Indeed.” Scooping up the bowl, Mycroft spooned some of the pasta into his mouth as he watched Jackie pick up one stackable teacup and put it in the other. Then, she reached over to the small cake and pressed the button on top, prompting it to play a garish song.
“Mrs. Granger and I have been conferring,” Mycroft responded.
“That would be great. When exactly did you get her, anyway?”
“No, you’re right. But now it’s not just Sherlock.”
“Ah, well regular bowel movements are good,” Mycroft nodded, trying to mask his awkwardness behind indifference and failing utterly. Jackie’s brow cleared and she leaned forward to drop a block on the bed. As she did, her face crumpled and she let out a whine.
“You really do play beautifully,” John said when he recognized what Sherlock was humming. “I’d like it if you played for me sometime.”
"I wouldn't make any sudden moves if I were you," Mycroft warned the woman. "Grab the child and I will allow you to leave unharmed. I was never here. You were never here."
“We’ll have to find things that you like besides the telly,” John said softly to her. “We can’t let your brain rot. Do you like colouring?”
“And you never told me, your partner. Why?”
“Sorry,” he mumbled softly, pulling away from John after a moment and running a hand over his wet eyes.
“I… bad…” she said from in between sobs.
“Sherlock,” John admonished gently.
“Tactful as always, Sherlock,” Mycroft said with a pained expression.
Greg comes home distressed and in need of a punishment
“I understand,” Sherlock interrupted. “Anything to protect your precious job.”
Liz nodded, looking at Mycroft.
“Give it here, or we’ll shoot you in the head while you’re still holding it.”
“So, NSPCC?”
“Nice to meet you,” Ron added, nodding to all of them and taking Rose’s hand. “Rose?”
John looked at him skeptically but didn’t pull his hand away.
“Right,” he said, not sounding too convinced.
“No thank you, I’ve got juice and food for her.”
“Lok! Joh!” Jackie cried happily.
“Move in with me,” Sherlock blurted when they broke apart once again for air.
Mycroft visited the next day with adoption papers.
“Judging by the small stain on your pant leg and the state of your right cuff, I would say you know exactly what I mean.” Sherlock squinted at Mycroft. It was true he and John had been texting consistently since the night of the party, but they hadn’t been able to meet up yet.
“Good,” John said distractedly, looking into her eyes. Putting his hand gently on her cheek, he pulled down the bottom lid so that he could examine her eye. He quickly did the same on the other side. “Eyes are clear. Penlight?” he asked from the brothers.
“Of course not,” Mycroft answered, shrugging.
“Hello,” Sherlock added. “Dinner’s just about ready,” their mother informed them as she entered the room.
Sherlock easily flagged them a cab and gave John’s address when they got in. They rode in silence, Sherlock’s hand still wrapped around John’s.  When they pulled up to the house, John paid and slid out of the cab, Sherlock following close enough behind that their hands didn’t unlink. They were both still wrapped in the blankets they had been given. John unlocked the door and they both stepped in, standing in the doorway. John pulled his hand out of Sherlock’s, pulling his blanket tighter around himself self-consciously.
“It’s not surgery, Sherlock, no need to look so scared,” John said with a smile. “Hold her head up a little more.” Sherlock adjusted accordingly. He couldn’t take his eyes off of her as she greedily sucked the bottle back, hands resting on either side of the bottle. John smiled at the sight of them completely enraptured in one another. When Rosie started pulling air, she popped the nipple out of her mouth and whined. Silently, Mrs. Hudson slid over the applesauce she had pulled out of the fridge.
“Yes, I haven’t gotten the chance to use it, considering yesterday’s events.”
“Let me tell you how it will go, then,” she said. “We already know where you are hiding the child. After I take you out tonight, we will move out tomorrow and gather the child.”
“I have a set of robes like that at home!” Rose said excitedly.
“Don’t be silly,” John said.
“Well, we’d better leave you to it, then,” John whispered, smiling at the baby who was having trouble keeping her eyes open. “You’ll get to test out that new crib.”
“The sofa needs to go a little to the left,” Mycroft said thoughtfully, watching as Greg pushed it once more across the floor.
“I am eighteen, my interests are the violin, chemistry and murder mysteries. Sometimes I go for days on end without speaking. I also do not agree with this experiment we’ve all been forced into and don’t believe that good relationships can be chemically engineered.” Sherlock smiled coldly.
“Any spats? Disagreements that you need to work through?”
Sherlock didn’t answer, preoccupied with finding his brother’s contact and lifting the phone to his ear.
“I mean it, no getting up until I get back.”
“I do love you,” Mycroft breathed against Greg’s lips.
“Ssshh,” John whispered after a moment, “we can’t giggle at a crime scene.”
“Not yet. I was going to do it after lunch, but we were interrupted.”
“And he doesn’t eat nearly as much as he should,” Greg raised his eyebrows at Mycroft.
“Yes, dear,” John said half joking before becoming serious again. “That’s what safe words are for, and contracts. All things we will be dealing with shortly.”
"Thank you. Moving in." Mycroft pocketed his phone and shifted his gun to both hands, keeping it tucked close to his body as he quietly made his way down the cold, deserted hallway and to the door between the doorway and the laboratory. Reaching the metal door marked "exclusive personnel only", Mycroft took out a keycard from his pocket and swiped it, holding his breath as he waited for the light to turn from red to green. When it did, he opened the door with a muted click and entered the room.
“What house do you think I’ll be in?”
“Nope, and if you take one step closer, I won’t hesitate to shoot you.”
“It’s not a waist trainer, since that is a soft limit for you,” Mycroft started. “And of course it’s only our first one. I thought I would go simple since you weren’t there to pick it out. There are thousands of styles, Gregory, you wouldn’t believe. There are ones that look like vests, and ones with shoulder straps and overbust ones. They also come in a variety of colours and fabrics. There’s really no limit.” Mycroft realized he was babbling and stopped talking, waiting for Greg to say something.
“Diaper change,” he proclaimed, moving into her bedroom to the changing table there. Quickly Mycroft unsnapped her onesie, opening the nappy on auto-pilot.  He glanced quickly at the nappy, stopping when he noticed the rosy colour found within. Mycroft’s mind stuttered momentarily and, without giving it a second thought, Mycroft was pulling out his mobile and choosing Gregory’s number in his contacts. Putting the phone up to his ear, he waited impatiently while Jackie started to fuss, the air on her bare bottom uncomfortable. The line rang three times before clicking through.
“Alright Gregory,” Mycroft said, pressing on the back of Greg’s neck. “I’m happy to say that most of our kinks follow the same lines. That will make things easier.”
“Just over thirteen months,” Mycroft said mechanically, reaching for the diaper bag to get the juice and food out.
“Ya!” she said again.
“She was quite excited,” Mycroft agreed.
Liz shook her head easily this time.
“And Sherlock? How did you feel when you found out your brother had magic?”
“You can go now, Gregory,” Mycroft said, voice equally quiet. “I’ve eliminated the threat. You are no longer obligated to be here. No need to pretend to like me anymore.”
Sherlock, much as he was loathe to admit, was impressed and almost convinced.
“Of course, if you wouldn’t mind.”
“Yes, John,” Mycroft said. They had done this enough times over the years that this part was routine.
They both nodded and moved forward, approaching the Muggles with caution.
“Ta,” John said kindly to the receptionist, taking Liz’s hand and leading both of them out of the building and down to the car below.
Liz pulled her face out from where it was nuzzled against John’s neck and valiantly tried to suppress her sobs.
“Don’t be silly, you’ve never had any,” Mycroft said, smiling down at Jackie.
A giggle escaped through Liz’s and Sherlock couldn’t decide who looked more surprised, him or Liz.
“Thanks Sherlock, that’s really great.” Sherlock tried not to enjoy the warm glow that started in the pit of his stomach and grew to the tips of his fingers and toes at the words of praise. They were interrupted once more when Mycroft and Greg strolled up to them hand in hand.
Another two lives, Mycroft thought but didn’t say it out loud.
“Do you own it or something?” Greg asked suspiciously.
“If there’s anything you don’t want to talk about, you don’t have to,” Sherlock continued from her other side.
“Emotions are tough, hm?” John asked sympathetically, running his hand up and down Sherlock’s back. Sherlock hummed in agreement, letting himself rest in the quiet space for a moment.
“Yeah. Why, has no one ever told you that?”
“Okay.” Greg laid out the afghan that was draped on the back of the sofa. “You know where to find me. Please, come get me if you need anything, alright?”
John took it with an inquisitive brow, opening it up and quickly reading the first page. His brow cleared, and then furrowed again in anger.
Mycroft hummed. “Then it seems we are at a bit of an impasse.”
“I would like that a lot,” Greg said, eyes darkening.
“Anal plugs, large, three.”
“Yes, I believe there is a store in town that will provide what we need,” Mycroft said. “We will stop there first, and then pick up groceries before going home.”
“Well, it sounds like he deserved it,” Mycroft chuckled as he started peeling carrots. Looking up, he smiled at Greg. “Hello, Gregory. I put the ham in an hour ago like you told me to.”
Sherlock hesitated for a moment. “Yes, John.”
“I’ll leave you to it,” Greg chuckled, whistling as he left the room.
“When we were little, Mycroft flew into a tree,” Sherlock said absently, eyes still glued to the computer screen. “He was being chased by a dog and got so scared that instead of climbing, he flew into a tree. Mummy had a fit.”
“Come on, Sherlock. You can’t not like anything.” There was a hint of annoyance in his tone.
“Oh, love,” Greg tutted softly, drawing Mycroft firmly to his chest. He felt the big part of his heart that was linked to Mycroft shrivel a little at his partner’s distress. “It’s okay,” he murmured mindlessly. “You’re okay.” He whispered platitudes into Mycroft’s ear as he seemed to sob every emotion out of his body. Greg was momentarily worried that Mycroft would make himself sick again with the amount that he was crying, but he assured himself that Mycroft was breathing and didn’t seem to be having ill effects other than a snotty nose and a little dehydration. He cried for what seemed like hours until he was absolutely exhausted. Then the words started.
“We know Mycroft and Hermione are both working on finding her. That’s something,” John said as he carefully applied the bandages. He pulled out a roll of gauze and wrapped a few layers around Sherlock’s hand. “Be gentle on the hand, please?” John asked futilely.
“And how do you feel about Sherlock’s job?” Evan asked, turning to John.
“Thank you for respecting me at my place of work?”
“Okay then. Take this moment by moment, day by day?”
“Do you always speak so poshly?”
“Chocolate cake?” Mycroft asked as he entered the kitchen.
Liz hastened to nod.
“Is there anything else?” Greg asked, a hard edge creeping into his voice.
“Dear Ms. Watson-Holmes,” she read aloud as Sherlock came in from the kitchen, sleeves rolled up and a beaker in his hand. “We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later that 31 July. Yours sincerely, Minverva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress.” She beamed up at them. “I really get to go!”
“As if a child could change my mood,” Sherlock scoffed, accepting Jackie into his arms and nuzzling slightly into her hair.
They walked into a small room with warm yellow walls, cushiony beige chairs, a sofa, and a desk in the corner, behind which sat an older gentleman in a fuzzy jumper with spectacles perched on the edge of his nose.
“We would never give you to anyone,” John said firmly. “And we are not angry, we promise. You are ours, forever and always, alright?”
“No,” she said finally before snapping her mouth closed.
“Hi, love,” Greg went and wrapped his arms around Mycroft from behind. “Thanks for peeling and getting everything ready. I’ll take over from here.”
“Leather restraints are a five. Most definitely.”
Sherlock sighed and rested his head on John’s sternum for a moment before surging up off the bed.
“There you go,” the woman said, handing over the items.
“You should eat,” he said to the room in general, leaning over to pick up Sherlock’s discarded book. He flipped absently through it, noticing that Sherlock had folded and highlighted a few pages.
Mycroft froze for a moment. “I don’t understand the question.”
“Move in. Here. With me. It’s where you belong, John,” Sherlock dipped his head so he was making eye contact with John.
It was now late afternoon and they had progressed to a small experiment involving baking soda and vinegar. John was staying in the sitting room, newspaper and tea in hand. He wanted Sherlock and Liz to bond, and he didn’t want to be the one to clean up the experiment when it inevitably erupted.
“They say it’s to provide stability for the submissive, and to care for them if they start going into subdrop. Also in case they are in need of punishment or being put into subspace. Like I said, ridiculous.”
“Excited, thrilled,” John answered easily. “But I was raised in a magic household.”
“Yes, thank you. See you next time,” Mycroft said as they left.
“Yes, I’m his brother,” Mycroft moved forward, securing Jackie on his hip.
“Yes, one moment.” Sherlock flounced to the coat stand and slung his Belstaff onto his shoulders, his blue scarf wrapping around his neck. “Alright, let’s go.”
“Yeah, then Mycroft gave me a lecture about having you home by midnight and swooped up to his room. What were you playing there?”
“Liz helped with the toast,” John said, grinning at her.
John thought for a moment. “Well, Mrs. H said she’d take her as long as we needed.”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock answered, distracted by the message that had pinged on his phone.
“This I can work with,” he said appreciatively. Opening the pantry, he noted shelves filled with crackers and canned food and drink. “Beans to eat, I think.” He pulled a can out of the pantry and, after a moment of searching, found a saucepan to dump the contents in. He put the saucepan on one of the burners and leaned on the counter beside the stove, arms crossed as he took in the sight of Mycroft who had followed Greg into the kitchen.
Thank you all for the lovely notes on the chapters :D Hope you enjoy :)
“Yes, but therapy geared towards making sure you are living happy lives both individually and as a couple. So. If you don’t feel comfortable talking about sex, would you feel comfortable talking about scenes?”
“Please mother,” Mycroft winced, “not so shrill. But yes. It is going well between us.”
“And I’ll continue to say it until you believe me,” John smiled softly at him. “Goodnight,” he said after a moment, letting go completely of Sherlock.
“I thought Mycroft would be working in the Department of Mysteries,” John said with a grin.
He then found the dress section. There was enough frill and lace to make a pageant mom happy for the rest of her life, and Mycrof, loathe as he was to admit it, indulged a little. He picked out a dress that had stripes on the top and a floral skirt, a soft pink dress made completely of lace, a more practical cotton, pleated, striped dress in light blue, a polo striped dress in a lilac, a sailor-style light dress with polkadots covering it and a handful of body and playsuits, one with a pastel rainbow print, one with a cartoon elephant on the front, one made of denim and one in a buttery cream colour.
“Yup, our first vacation,” Greg said, reaching over and grabbing Mycroft’s hand and interrupting his search for baby food. Mycroft tensed minutely before relaxing, looking at Gregory who was looking at the waitress.
“That would be me,” D.I. Nolan said with his arms crossed, coming up beside Sherlock.
“Mr. Holmes and Mr. Watson,” the therapist, Evan, interrupted them as he came into the room. “Good to see you. If you’d please follow me.” Both men stood and followed the therapist into his office, taking a seat on the sofa that faced the therapist’s chair.
“Oh- I don’t… cuddle,” Mycroft said, pulling Jackie towards his chest.
“Liz, this is Rose, she’s my daughter. She just turned five.”
“Yes son, we’re very proud,” Sieger smiled at his son.
“Okay,” Mycroft said thickly.
“Very much so.” Greg smiled at Mycroft as e put his mobile away. “I felt left out of the fun.”
“Yes, sir,” John replied. “No need to worry here.”
“Well, that is something I’d rather never experience ever again. In fact, I may need to burn my eyes out.”
“Um- John Watson, I’m here with Sherlock.”
“Come on up for a little cuddle,” Mycroft said, gently putting his hands under Greg’s armpits and helping him up onto his lap.
“Yes, I think so too,” Mycroft answered, bouncing her gently. Sitting down on one of the hard plastic chairs, Mycroft sat Jackie on his lap and brought out her teddy bear from the diaper bag. Holding it in front of her, Mycroft wiggled the bear in her direction. Jackie reached out with both hands, grabbing fistfuls of fur and fluff and bringing the bear towards her, swinging it up and down. Mycroft smiled softly at her, holding her firmly on his lap. She looked up at Mycroft, smiling and giggling. “Yes, very good,” he praised her softly.
“Yes, of course he is, mother,” Mycroft scoffed.
“See you.”
“It’s I who should be thanking you,” Mycroft said.
Liz nodded, looking around again before turning and leading the way out the door, having lost interest.
“I suppose,” Greg said, staring at the vase in awe. Sherlock seemed nonchalant about the whole ordeal.
“She was… found at a crime scene we were working on. NSPCC wasn’t available to take her, so we offered to look after her.”
“Presents?” she asked eagerly, curls falling into her face.
“Just a little kiss,” Greg coaxed playfully.
Greg shook his head.
“Yes, quickly to pick up groceries. And to show our faces; I’ve used the house as a safe house before, it’s good let the locals know we’ll be staying here for the forseeable future.”
They were interrupted when a small hand tugged on the back of John’s dressing robe. John looked back to see Liz, one thumb tucked into her mouth and the other hand wrapped in the fabric of his dressing gown.
Sherlock let his eyes run over John once more, but could detect no lie or deceit, and offered up his phone. “Here, put your number in my phone and I’ll send you a message.”
Rushing through the open bedroom door, Mycroft spotted a tiny bottom crawling merrily towards the living room. “Oh, no you don’t,” he said, easily catching up with his long strides and scooping Jackie up and into his arms. “Good try, my love,” he said, laying a tentative kiss on the top of her head. It was the first time he had kissed her, but it felt right. “A government official almost confounded by a baby,” he said to her, shaking his head. “Not today.” Hopefully not ever, he added silently. “Come now, I was starting to get the hang of this crib. Let’s see if I can’t finish it.” Carrying her back into the room, Mycroft deposited Jackie by the blocks once more.
“What?”
“Cow,” Jackie said clumsily, looking at Mycroft.
“It’s small, but it is a safe house,” Mycroft said, taking off his coat and hanging it in the small closet by the door.
It was a week and a half later when John and Sherlock broached the idea of daycare. They had talked about it a few days before, after a session with Dr. Witter. Although he had been unable to find a wizard daycare, he had found several Muggle ones that other wizard families had used. John researched them and found that one was relatively close to the flat. Although Liz was still relatively non-verbal, her nightmares and panic attacks had lessened, and she was able to go for several hours without touching one of them. They had discovered through trial and error that she enjoyed colouring, wasn’t fond of cards but really enjoyed board games and reading.
“Yes, but if we attend once every three months, we get left alone. So we do what we have to,” John reasoned back.
“Any particular ones?”
Sherlock sighed. “I do not like being punished, as a general rule,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock’s eyes flitted around the room, taking in the small one-bedroom flat easily. They were in the main room, near the front door.
Mycroft opened his mouth to deliver a no-doubt scathing response, but Greg cut him off.
“No, but it’s not me either. Not specifically. I’m just sort of a… general worried.”
“Good, then I will see you when next I see you. Have a good evening.”
“No need to be shy, it’s just Mycroft,” Sherlock teased gently. Liz didn’t answer, face still pressed to Sherlock’s sleeve.
“True.” John nodded and ran his hand restlessly through his hair before standing and holding out his hand. “Well, I’d best get back to them. Thank you, Dr. Witter.”
“Oh wow, how exciting! And you rented a car to get around?”
“Dinner?” Greg asked.
“Yes, I do enjoy that.”
Sherlock gets punished. Heed the tags.
“Alright, you take her and I’ll go make us some food. Be back soon. Also, John will be coming over sometime this morning.”
"Okay,” Sherlock agreed easily. He found, much to his chagrin, that it was easy to obey the subtle commands that John constantly gave. John was gentle and never demanded anything extraneous. At least, not so far.
“Now, who sent you?”
Liz quietly slipped off the sofa and followed John into the kitchen, afghan still wrapped around her shoulders. She slipped into one of the chairs at the kitchen table, feet swinging in the air.
"Anthea, is there another room attached to this one on the ground plans of the building?" he checked. He couldn’t recall there being one, but wasn’t above double-checking.
“Hi love,” he murmured. “Have a good nap? Do you need a nappy change?” He checked her nappy, but she seemed clean and dry. “Okay, let’s go say hi to Marcia.” He propped her on his hip, rubbing her leg where it rested on his waist. When they got into his room, Marcia’s face lit up.
“Thank you for your honesty. I would like to enforce the fact that you are more than adequate, but I recognize your need for punishment, and will therefore mete it out as I see fit. But first…” Leaving the sentence hanging, Mycroft walked over to their closet and opened the drawer containing the toys and implements he and Greg had compiled in their time together. Pulling out the nipple clamps, Mycroft dangled them from his finger by the chain. Stalking slowly back to Greg, Mycroft knelt in front of Greg and snapped the first clamp onto one of Greg’s nipples, smiling gently at the small hiss that Greg emitted.
“Age play, two.”
“See you later,” John said as he led Sherlock out by the hand.
“Okay.”
He arrived at the base a few hours later, back-up close behind. This time, the plan was to find the head of the project and put a stop to the whole program. Mycroft had had enough of being on high alert, and he couldn’t stand the idea of other helpless children being taken advantage of.
Anthea dropped them off at Mycroft’s flat, promising to see that all the loose ends of the mission were tied up. Mycroft carried a sleeping Jaclynn to the elevator, keeping her close to his bare chest and making sure to keep the muslin wrapped tightly around her small form.
“No,” she said again. “All I know is I was promised a healthy baby and one million pounds if I could bring you both in.”
“No! Of course not!” Sherlock hastened to reply. “I trust you indefinitely. It’s just a sort of knee-jerk reaction I have from a childhood of bullying. I’m sorry, let’s get on with it.”
“Maids,” Sherlock answered, pacifier bobbing as he talked.
“Happy Easter!” she replied.
John sighed. “I know, it just… sucks.”
“One, two, three,” John administered the last jab and placed the empty needle in a biohazard container his bag, taking out three small plasters and applying them to each injection point. “I’ll take that and you give her a cuddle,” John said, holding out his hand for the teddy bear. Mycroft absently handed the teddy bear to John and turned Jackie so she was facing him. As soon as her arms were free, Jackie started pushing at Mycroft’s chest with her tiny fists. “Watch for signs of swelling or flu-like symptoms like fever and vomiting and if she starts exhibiting any of them text me.” At this point John had finished packing up his bag and had put the teddy bear on the table. Looking at Sherlock, he noticed the pinched and pained expression on his paler-than-usual face. “We’re going to leave now,” John told Mycroft, who was looking detachedly at the baby in his hands, the only sign of his distress the little wrinkle between his raised eyebrows. “Sherlock, can you take my bag and hail a cab for us?”
“And do you have a job, Sherlock?”
John chuckled as he stood up, gently cradling Liz in his arms. “Don’t drink too much. Although you are taking this rather well, all things considered.”
