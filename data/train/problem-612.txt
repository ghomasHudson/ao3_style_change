"Decomposition is in too late of a stage to be him. Also, this corpse looks to be shorter... my brother is six feet tall."
Sherlock nodded gravely; he agreed wholeheartedly that their time was scarce. If Mary was still alive, she would not be for much longer.
With precious oxygen still running through, Sherlock's mind went elsewhere, running amok in the mind palace until a peculiar sound came above him. Something thrown on top of the suitcase.
The skinny thing gagged around thick fingers; the response Sawtooth was hoping for. He loved when they squirmed. He removed his scarred hand, and the newfound freedom of the full-lipped mouth allowed the thin young man to eject a full gob of mucus and spit right into Sawtooth's eyes. Snarling, Sawtooth backhanded the little wretch.
Renting a car was easier than expected, but John did not trust good luck. Sure enough, the Toyota Corolla they had rented looked to be on its last breath. At least it started up when he turned the key.
"Focus, John. Breathe. Mind over body, remember? Don't panic." Though slightly winded from the exertion, Sherlock sounded remarkably composed.
Sherlock made a motion meant to represent a shrug, but the scraping of his skin against the sheets made him hiss from pain. John's weight atop his ribcage was not exactly helping matters along, but his partner needed this, and Sherlock wanted to oblige.
Indeed it was not. Sherlock carefully adjusted the lighting just a little more and then clicked 'sharpen'. His eyes narrowed, pleased at his discovery, while John's eyes widened.
Still, John had not been injured very seriously, at least not compared to Sherlock. Perhaps if he surprised the bony little maniac, he could toss it into the current. It might not kill the hunter, but the river might carry him downstream and thus far away.
Contrary to expectation, the SWAT team leader, a surly, stout man in his early fifties who reminded Mycroft of the late general Douglas McArthur - a historical personality this man no doubt idolized - verbalized an order to find a shovel and unearth whatever it was that had been buried.
Mycroft was glad he gave his little brother that toy in the first place. He had actually made the plush whilst at school and named it himself. Bee had been short for Busby, chosen as such for the obvious similarity to the words "buzz" and "bee". William, of course, preferred the nickname over his brother's choice, which he had outright said was stupid. Still, he scooped up the toy in his arms near immediately upon being presented with it for the first time, so Mycroft's gesture was not a total loss.
"Shh," he whispered. "We must be quiet now. Do you understand?" Mycroft held his grip, surprised at his own strength. After all, the younger Holmes was far stronger now than he had ever been the last time he needed to be restrained into stillness.
John swallowed, hoping it would at least temporarily ease his laboured breathing. It didn't, and when he made another attempt to explain himself, he quickly realized his muted flow of words sounded more like gibberish than properly enunciated speech.
"Come on," he breathed, reaching out his hands, and Sherlock took them without hesitation, grimacing while twisting his long body to fit through the narrow opening John had created. It was obvious that the movement hurt him greatly, but not a sound escaped Sherlock's lips as he - gracefully, despite the state of him - slid over to the doctor's side of the pen.
Finding her body had already sent the gentle doctor to the brink of mental collapse. Knowing she was tortured as well might have been a blow John could never recover from.
"She could still be alive, John," Sherlock said slowly, but the tone of his voice revealed that he found it unlikely. "The amount of blood found here is not conclusive with a lethal injury. Alright? We have to keep looking."
"We should have gone to New York..." John muttered sourly. "This is no way to "experience" America."
The man who dragged him from the riverbank answered. "I dunno, all I got was Sherlock. Izzat even a name?"
“Not technically,” John uncomfortably reminded her. “We have company in the other room, and sometimes he doesn’t sleep all through the night.”
Heavy footsteps grew louder as the oafish man who had pursued him wandered outside as well, chuckling as though ready to play what had probably felt to him like a game in searching for their escaped quarry. He still brandished his axe, and even if he was mentally challenged, he likely did not take much concentration to hit anyone with the sizeable blade. He lumbered into the front yard and glanced about the property with a childish glee that seemed even more unnerving than the stoic concentration of his taller relative.
Not long passed before the idiot was once again standing by the bed, his two filthy hands pawing at the detective's bound form. Sherlock did not lift his head to look at the mountain man even when the creature leaned in to place an experimental lick on his ear.
"No, he's right," Mary said to John's great surprise. "I'd rather have something to do than just sit here while you two are busy elsewhere."
Attempting to keep the traffic sign in sight made the drive go slowly, but Mary was determined to stay patient. Distracting herself from the task at hand had gotten her into this problem after all. When she came to a fork in the road, she had to lift herself above the vehicle once more, which made her nervous, thinking back to the possible footstep earlier. The left turn appeared to take her away from the stop sign, but the right turn was once again dirt.
"What is that supposed to mean?" John demanded, getting angrier by the second. "You've had it in for me from the beginning, and why? I'm not good enough for a Holmes? Because of my upbringing? Or am I simply not clever enough to be deserving of your brother's attention? I'm just a poor ex-army surgeon, after all. Just your average bloke, not a bloody genius!"
“That alone indicates how long it’s been since we last shagged,” Sherlock said. “Surely you can do better than that!”
Meanwhile, the stench was not quite so offensive inside this particular vehicle. Mycroft wondered if perhaps he was simply becoming desensitized. Within seconds, however, he detected a specific scent and, glancing toward the front of the cab, located an aerosol can with a flowery pink illustration. At least this driver was making an effort, if a dreadfully lazy one.
"I'm well aware," the elder Holmes cut in. "I'm interested in the parts of him that you were able to salvage," he dryly pointed out.
A voice in a higher octave interrupted their somewhat lacking conversation, and the bony maniac was approaching. Sherlock still kept his eyes closed, not much caring. The three-fingered one must have been telling his sibling to come away, because after a few seconds, the heavy weight left the mattress and both mountain men walked off.
Dreams of Sherlock, of their abominable captors, of the river and the never-ending woods. Auditory elements such as the skinny psycho's manic giggling or the deafening roar of coursing water mixed with the flashing images (memories?) projected by his traumatized senses.
John moved as stealthily as he could along the outer wall of the shed, craning his neck (and wishing, not for the first time, that he were taller) in his attempts to see past the junk and foliage. Sweat was practically flowing down his spine, causing his skin to itch terribly and his clothes to stick to his body like a damp second skin.
The doctor reached for his axe just as Sherlock's eyes bulged and fixated on something behind John's back. He had just enough time to see a shape approach him from the right and hear a maniacal cackle he'd believed until now could only exist in nightmares. The creature swung its own weapon against John's head, and the following moment everything went black.
This was not how John had imagined it in his head. Not in a small, musty room at some godforsaken resort for people who liked prancing about in the nude. Not with Sherlock next door. Not with...
Curling up in a foetal position with a pillow - the one John had used - pressed tightly to his chest, Sherlock buried his face in the soft cotton fabric and tried desperately to quench the sobs threatening to break out of his throat. Moisture seeped from his eyes, gathering in his lashes and making them stand out in spikes. He was experiencing a gamut of emotions, ranging from despair to rage.
The arm which was not presently stuck with needles reached up, covering his eyes. The impact of the sudden grief which overwhelmed him caused a horrible sobbing to escape his lungs. Thankfully no members of the staff had heard him, and he was left alone to finish crying like a child and finally compose himself. He could not do anything else now. He was unable to help, to find out where Sherlock was, or if he was still alive.
"My methods are built on the observation of trifles, details, no matter how small or insignificant they may appear. By telling me, you could have been of great help, instead of leaving me to figure things out for myself."
There had to be a purpose as to why both John and himself had been strung up and put on display rather than butchered outright and stashed in the shed like Mary. Sherlock had already ruled out the possibility of a ransom. These men lived outside the society that dealt in money. They were hunters, trappers, scavengers… murderers. Meat was all that mattered in their small, twisted world, and currently they had more than enough of it.
The entire scenario was ridiculous bordering on surreal; a clan of cannibalistic hunters preying on actual people… And having managed to evade detection for several decades. Just what exactly did the police force in small backwoods West Virginia towns do to cash in their paychecks? Gorge on donuts while on duty, as the stereotype of American police officers often suggested? Any actual crime investigation was out of the question, as they had evidently managed to miss something of this magnitude for an extended period of time.
Already Mycroft had started to accept the death of his brother, so much so that when he felt that breath, he wanted to excuse it as his imagination. After all, he reasoned, if Sherlock was somehow still alive after the damages done, how could he ever recover? That leg looked to be beyond hope. His older brother already knew from Watson's scribbled answers that the younger man had been raped on top of the blatant physical torture, and the fluids present on his person were quite telling. No, Sherlock had already been through enough in his life and he did not need any of this.
"Inbred mountain men?" John was flabbergasted by the mere idea. That kind of stuff didn't happen except in shoddy, low-budget horror movies, which he made a point of not watching.
Coupled with the slight embarrassment was also a strong sense of relief. He could evidently still get excited without thoughts of Sherlock... Oh drat.
Sherlock looked up at him with an annoyed glare. John gave an awkward smile, but it was clear that his partner was in no mood to joke.
"Yes, that's right," Sherlock muttered, now visibly impatient. He was never one to engage in small talk, and now he was not in the mood to even pretend. When Sherlock was tired,  his anti-social nature became more apparent than ever.
He angled his hand so that she wouldn't be able to see the bite mark inflicted by Sherlock. Now that the rush of adrenaline was fading, the wound painfully throbbed in time with his heartbeat. He would tend to it later, perhaps clean it with peroxide to prevent infection. God only knew the kind of pathogens that could be found in Sherlock's mouth, especially after something like this.
“Well, it’s not really something one gets over right away,” Mary said, edging a little closer. “If this is an issue involving your mentality, it’s going to take time no matter what. The human brain is fully capable of betraying its owner at any time, after all.”
Still, Mycroft felt another breath, weak but still not imagined. He placed a hand against his brother's throat and felt an equally fragile pulse.
John remembered once telling Sherlock that he would lose his head were it not screwed on tight enough, only to have Sherlock assure John that heads were not attached to bodies this way.
Mycroft sharply looked towards her, and his face took on the quality of a storm cloud, dark and foreboding. "Why on Earth would I do that?"
Already a team of medical technicians were waiting on the helipad. Mycroft's cynicism, having taken over long ago in the day, caused him surprise that the hospital was capable of that much. Adrenaline propelled him forward once more as he followed the gurney carrying his brother out of the helicopter and indoors, which was convenient, because when the time finally came for him to sleep, he would be dead to the world.
"It's possible, of course, but I cannot make a decision on my own. I'd have to consult my superiors."
"I don't need a bloody hospital!" Sherlock snarled from underneath the terrycloth which now covered his face. "John, hook the camera up to my laptop!"
"Sexually frustrated divorcee with a mid-life crisis," he informed them. "At least two adult children she's not on good terms with. Recently had a liposuction based on the horizontal scar beneath her stomach, which, I believe, led to some medical complications. As well as stretched the skin of her belly to the breaking point. And she has her home in a proverbial pig sty!"
Mycroft absently swatted a fly buzzing about his left ear as the group - five heavily armored SWAT team members each carrying an assault rifle and a ballistic shield, Mycroft himself, and Anthea - started toward the obvious path out of the clearing. The civil servant did not wear any heavy body armor, although the captain of the SWAT team had insisted he wear a bulletproof vest underneath his suit jacket and coat. Anthea had been forced to accept one as well, and her usual three-inch stilettos had been replaced with a pair of sturdy hiking boots.
Sherlock remembered the first time Sebastian beat him up with shocking detail and clarity; at such times an eidetic memory was definitely more of a curse than a gift, and this was a particular piece of information his brain had not managed to delete, despite repeated attempts.
One of the men lingering around him gave a disproving grunt. A slender hand grabbed him by the jaw and jerked his head forward again, toward the horrible sight.
A few seconds passed, and the civil servant began to fear Sherlock hadn't understood the instructions. Then the fingers wrapped around his wrist delivered one very particular squeeze.
Eyes shut and head turned away, he could only hear the approach of one of them and feel the hot breath beat on his cheek for a moment. The idiot, he thought. He personally found it unremarkable that he was beginning to recognize his captors individually without so much as looking at them, curse his powers of deduction.
The wrinkle between the doctor's brows deepened further, and was beginning to resemble a coiled snake. Teeth clenched tightly together, he grabbed Sherlock's bicep and dragged him into the moderate privacy the small kitchenette offered.
Sherlock looked to be ignoring the brute as well, and the distant look in his blue eyes read of more than just an attempt to mentally escape the situation. Sherlock was trying to think of a way out of this. He was scanning the place for something to help them escape.
“How is he?” Mary asked, walking out of the stall next door. She glanced at the state of her boyfriend’s partner and gave a rather defeated look.
“Dick is the ex-husband,” Sherlock said, stopping her tirade. “Drinking, pushing, jaywalking. I’m listening.”
Even so, he despaired at the absence of the beast's two relatives. He did not need to be a detective or a genius to know where they were going, and what they would do when they reached their destination.
Three-finger regretted having to chase One-Eye away from their new plaything, but the big oaf was unpredictable and there was a chance he'd cause the scrawny whore some irreparable damage if left unattended. Sawtooth had made things very clear earlier. He did not want One-Eye to play with their captive, and Three-finger did not want his little brother to be punished for breaking their father's rules.
The yard was littered with junk the clan members had likely gathered from multiple victims over the years, as well as skeletons of various cars, rusty and faded.
There were many "what ifs" and John suspected that if he stayed around to analyse them all, his chances of getting out of these woods alive decreased by each second. After all, he was not…
Night had fallen completely now. Lights flickered in the windows of the cabin, perhaps oil lamps. John heard nothing from Sherlock or the criminals at this distance, but it did not matter. His resolve was made of steel, after all. Fists clenched, he stood up from behind the hiding place, taking a step forward.
John had brought a pair, but his original intention for bringing them had been romantic outdoor activities in the American wilderness with his new girlfriend rather than clue-hunting with Sherlock.
Sherlock looked no different than the previous night, with the exception of the ventilator being gone. In its place was a simple nasal cannula, securing a flow of supplemental oxygen to aid the younger Holmes' respiration. Mycroft could not see a portable oxygen canister and thus assumed the oxygen was delivered through a wall connection via a flowmeter. Sherlock's breathing was slightly laboured, but considering the amount of dirt extracted from his airways, anything less than "laboured" would have been a miracle.
"If you let me finish, I'll let you!" Sherlock growled back. "First, the giant. Well over two metres tall, judging by the size of his boots and the length of his stride. Now, if you look at the prints."
Just as John found himself wondering where the third was, he felt spindly fingers grab the back of his neck, jolting him with surprise. Gnarled fingernails dug into skin for only a second, and he felt hot breath beating against his cheek as the creature laughed. John turned his head away on instinct, and saw that to his right was another figure similarly bound and hanging.
She might be dead and thus beyond rescue, but he did not want to treat her remains like trash to simply be dumped and left behind. At the very least her parents - whom he had sadly never gotten to meet - deserved to get back an actual body for a proper burial, and that would be far from certain if they left her to these animals.
Defiance and cleverness were a dangerous combination. Three-finger did not care about wasting meat, or depriving Sawtooth of his new pretty little plaything. This was for the good of the family. He grabbed an ancient set of shears on his way to the holding pen. He was going to kill that little bitch.
Pouring the pills into his palm, he took a closer look, and his brow knit at their features. Some of the engravings were from the usual painkillers, but others required that John search through his own personal memories as a doctor. He could not be positive, but his suspicions of the pills’ identity were worrying nonetheless.
Supper was ready, and the youngest had been sent to tell his other sibling. Replacing the whore's gag, Three-finger begrudgingly followed, returning the bottle to the cabinet. He tried to match his brother's enthusiasm for the meal, knowing that at least their prisoner would still face further torment when food was served.
Further fumbling suggested Sherlock was trying to right himself or possibly move away from the door.
The woman smiled. “If you say so.” She leaned forward and their lips met. John eagerly carded his fingers through her wet hair, kissing her back.
John gave up what strength he had left in his legs and let his full weight take both him and the psychotic fiend off the solid ground. They disappeared from the giant's sight and into the rushing current of the river. The coldness of the water enveloped John and he felt his foe release its hold on him.
John glanced back at the sleeping form on the bed. He could imagine his partner soon peeling with dead skin like some kind of shedding lizard.
Any hope at garnering sympathy from Mycroft in this particular matter disappeared when he saw the politician's look of suspicion turn into a look of cold fury. For a moment he believed Mycroft would actually reach out through the screen and throttle him.
"I cannot, but judging from the angle the picture was taken, the individual caught on camera is well above average in both height and build. Added to this we have the indisputable fact that voyeurism is far more prevalent in men than women, which significantly lowers the statistical probability of this being a female. Am I wrong?"
"Go," Mary said curtly. "We'll talk later." Though her words held some promise - at least they would be talking now, as opposed to last night - John was not sure it was a conversation he wanted to have.
"Drink this," he advised and popped the can open, uncertain if Sherlock in his current state could have done it without spillage.
Bobbi offered no audible reply to that. Sherlock glanced at the towel slung over his shoulder for a moment, as if contemplating where to put it, and then decided to wrap it around his hips.
Initially he thought he saw pre-ejaculate weeping from the head, but based on the reddened surface and clusters of irritation, he quickly changed his conclusion. Gonorrhea. He might just throw up after all, and possibly choke on the vomit as the hardening shaft was driven into his mouth.
"Also, you need medical attention yourself, sir," she continued. "And we need to let the doctors take care of your brother now."
Mycroft then paused, his forehead creased from the apparently painful recollection. Yet his Ice-man mask did not falter.
"I am!" John shouted, realized his error, and quickly lowered his voice. "Listen, Sherlock… If we hurry back to Avalon and call the police on their landline, they could be here within one hour. They'll believe us if we tell them about the cars. They'll have to! And--"
At times such as these, Sawtooth wondered if parting from the rest of their family had been a poor decision. Several mountains over, more of their kind lived in similar circumstances... or at least he thought they still lived. For all he knew, they had already been found by Outsiders, too many to be controlled or killed. Sawtooth hoped not, though. He and his mother may have separated from the clan to set out for their own years upon years ago, and bad blood might still exist between them despite the long time apart, but they were family.
“Boys, please?” Mary interrupted them. “The more time we spend here, the later it’s going to be once we arrive. And we don’t know just how late their reception desk stays open.”
John remained on his knees on the ground for a few seconds while Sherlock rose, and he stared at the dirt while the shed door was closed behind him. Clearly this was an attempt to lessen some of John's pain at the discovery, but Mary's mutilated corpse was still only a few paces away, visible or not.
"What's that? Where did you find it?" John asked, hesitant to leave his friend's side, but nonetheless very curious about the item Sherlock had brought with him. Fortunately the bag had been dropped far enough from the showers not to risk getting sprayed, but there was no way of knowing if it had been otherwise damaged.
He had been right; it was a dangerous fit. He did not imagine being absolutely stuck like some amateur spelunker in an unfamiliar cave, but he would need to go very slowly and carefully, lest he catch himself and make enough noise to alert their loathsome keepers.
The color gradually drained from Sherlock's face, except for two bright red spots on his cheeks. Breath hitched in his throat, and for a few seconds, he looked strangely absent, as if he was having trouble staying oriented.
The notion steeled John's resolve once more. Sherlock would not be dead, and he would not die, not if his friend and assistant had any say in it. John had been a pig and a lout for long enough, and he would make things right. He would save Sherlock and go through each and every one of these monsters if required.
"I know how my brother's mind works," Mycroft explained. "If I let you remain here, it will be much more difficult to make him focus on the person he needs to be focusing on, namely me."
"If it's the one I'm thinking of," Sherlock said, going through the images, "then we are very, very close." He paused on a photo, looking down at John in both trepidation and the excitement of finding their target.
The detective was closely scrutinizing the ground, looking for tire tracks that would help determine the route Mary had taken previously that day. John wished there was something - anything - he could do to help, but for someone without Sherlock's astute powers of observation, looking for tire tracks was a lost cause.
"You mouthy little tart!" he spat out, knowing that Sherlock sometimes got off on being talked dirty to.
"Alright then, let's go get Bee," Mycroft murmured and carefully held down the door handle to avoid any unnecessary noise. He let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding when nothing but silence greeted him outside the bathroom. It meant Father was still asleep. Thank goodness.
Facing away from his friend, he was surprised, but nonetheless pleased, when Sherlock wrapped one long, slender arm around his waist and interlaced their fingers. He wasn't sure if the sudden proof of affection from his friend stemmed from vulnerability or guilt, or something else entirely, but now was not the time to analyse it further. Made drowsy by his orgasm, John welcomed sleep when it finally came to him.
"Name's Jedidiah, but my friends call me Jed," the man introduced himself. "Now you just hang in there, yer gonna be alright… ambulance's on its way."
Missy considered sitting down next to the distraught Englishman waiting for news on his little brother, and giving him a thorough retelling of Sherlock's current status, but doing that would have  suggested intimacy that simply did not exist between them. She elected to stand instead, vaguely disconcerted by his surprising apathy. She had seen the more passionate side of him when he first entered the hospital, trailing after the gurney transporting his younger brother, but all the emotion exhibited by him then had been thoroughly wiped out and replaced by a cold mask of indifference. He looked as though he cared little whether his sibling lived or died.
"How?" Mycroft asked in a steely voice. John wondered if the Ice-man pitied him at all, or if all Mycroft felt toward him was rage for making it back when Sherlock hadn't.
I'm stronger than that, he said to himself. If only he could believe the words. He had to be strong. He was certain that if Sherlock was still alive, he would be strong, despite the agony dealt against him.
None of the three cannibals were currently watching him, and Sherlock exhaled in relief. Practically every part of his body was aching, he was thirsty and needed to relieve himself, but at least he didn't have to return to a session of torture inflicted upon his person. Very carefully, he tested the strength of his bonds. Raw pain immediately shot through his fractured right arm, but he bit back the consequent cry which formed in his lungs.
After all, John had clearly shown guarded interest in the male gender in the past, though he thought he had hidden such interest... but he clearly had not enacted upon it in years. Allowing the doctor to penetrate would be fitting for the transition. The sex had been good, excellent in fact, but as soon as affectionate hands tried to stroke him in the post-coital bliss, he shrugged off the attention.
"Far be it from me to ask unnecessary questions," Mycroft said, one of his own hands instinctively closing over the one which grasped him. "But do you know what's going on?"
Mary drove on for a while, clinging to the vain hope that the next turn would take her onto a bigger road, hopefully with more traffic and perhaps even road signs that would direct her back to Avalon. Though she would never confess it publically, she was dying to see a familiar face, even Sherlock's at this point.
"I need to place a meeting." A pause as he listened, then gave a response. "As soon as possible. It's a matter of haste."
“Something that I might very well have brought with me,” Sherlock replied, “had I been absolutely positive I could get past security dogs with it.”
"Your nurse has already told me all that," Mycroft said tiredly. For a moment, he could have sworn Nasim looked disappointed. "You were supposed to give me a more detailed account of his condition and... injuries."
"I'm sorry, sir," the nurse spoke slowly, as if she were spelling things out for a child with attention deficit problems. Mycroft hated to think that was how she viewed him. "But we cannot allow you inside the O.R. It's against hygiene protocol."
The skinny fiend straddled Sherlock, and a line of spit dangled from his lips until landing on his victim. Sherlock had no false expectations of how this would end. He was stuck to the ground and unable to do much else but feel the agony of jagged metal teeth clamped over his leg. Struggling while still in its grip would only worsen the damage and spill more precious blood, and once he succumbed to shock, he would be utterly useless to himself. He only wished the damnable beast above him would not savor the moments leading up to his death as he rightly predicted.
Sherlock’s seat was nearby, though thankfully to the couple, not within five feet of them. Thus, he parted, but not before giving his reply.“You know I have my ways.”
The woman was now beginning to raise her voice. “If you’re really here because you want to make fun of people who just want some peace and quiet when they’re not doing anything wrong—”
"I can't fucking believe this..." she muttered to herself, not yet ready to face the very real possibility of being lost. Thus anger was a way to shield her from the fear which was sure to set in once the severity of the situation had made itself known.
They weren't able to understand much of the man's intermittent ravings during the periods of time he was actually conscious, although Mabel, Jed's wife, remarked at some point that he spoke what sounded like "English" English. Jed himself was doubtful. What would an Englishman be doing in these parts of West Virginia?
"Survives his other injuries," Mycroft finished the doctor's statement for him. There was more; that he also knew. He had caught a glimpse of Sherlock's swollen, lacerated anus when the younger man - at the time presumed to be deceased - was lifted out of the suitcase, and the sight would most likely haunt him forever.
The young woman did not respond, only glaring. Sherlock only sniffed at her in exchange. What John saw in her, he had no idea.
“That kind of dress is against etiquette,” Sherlock said after one glance. “No dressing to titillate. This is no swingers' club.” Mary crossed her arms and glared at him.
"Ridiculous?" Sherlock coolly returned the woman's stare. "Outrageous? There's something else, Miss Ferguson," he continued, taking a step towards her. "Aren't you going to invite me in?"
"Wanted to come on you? Yes. I figured you'd notice and ask questions." Sherlock quietly passed the pack of tissues to his partner, and John removed the used condom before starting the task of cleaning himself up.
"That's why I didn't tell you." Sherlock's voice pulled John back to the present, away from his recollections. "I was afraid you wouldn't understand."
“How about that path?” John suggested, gesturing towards the nearby dirt trail. “It looks like it heads into the woods, and that would be—”
"I was not present at the time. The decision was made by my colleague, Dr. Sandstrom," Nasim explained, a hint of defensiveness creeping into his voice. "You may voice any concerns you have to him, but he'll give you the exact same answer I'm giving you now. It was a medical decision, and Dr. Sandstrom was the attending physician. It was his call to make."
Sherlock chuckled, returning to the bed and straddling his assistant. “You’re just as bratty as Mycroft makes me out to be.”
What had happened to John, he wondered. Had he escaped? Sherlock hoped so, but considering the near catatonic state the older man had assumed at the shed where Mary likely still hung, he could have been easily apprehended. Then again, Sherlock heard no indication that John was nearby. He hoped John was not dead.
Damn it all, why did this even happen in the first place? If Watson had not gone on this damnable holiday...
"I take it he'll always be there. And you clearly still have feelings for him. Where does that put us?"
John's throat was getting uncomfortably dry, and he suspected that the heat of the sauna was not the only reason. Though he knew it was silly, he couldn't help but believe that Mary found his physique lacking in many respects. At 5'6'' with a compact build, John had never been what most people considered classically handsome, but during his army days, he had prided himself on being naturally muscular and deceptively strong for his size. Now a layer of fat covered his previously well-defined body. Sherlock never missed an opportunity to poke fun at him for his expanding waistline, the verbal jabs sometimes accompanied by physical ones. To the detective, picking at other people was just as natural as it was for normal people to pick their teeth.
Anthea produced the list as though she had envisaged that her boss would ask for it. He wearily skimmed through the names, recalling details as his eyes retread their steps. Though his brain still worked as unswervingly as ever, already he was growing physically exhausted by the day's events. He would be changing attire as soon as possible, and the mere sight of him would without question mean a new suit would be awaiting him at the hotel thanks to Anthea... if the competence of this damnable city's postage workers and hotel staff could be relied upon, anyway.
John settled back into his seat, at a loss for words. Like the discovery of Sherlock's medication, John somehow thought he would have been trusted with such information. But then again, after last night's row, perhaps he really did not deserve that trust.
"Cabin five, was it, boys?" Mary piped up and practically ushered John toward the exit. He had not even noticed her coming inside, but now he could only hope that Sherlock would follow before the woman behind the desk changed her mind about letting them stay.
Mary's anger grew as she considered the possibility. Was this the 'southern hospitality' - or considerable lack of it - these areas were famous for?
"Alright, you want the truth?" he offered, holding up his hands. "Sherlock is my ex. But I promise I haven't slept with him during the time we've been dating. Except today. I made a mistake, Mary. I didn't... send you away intending to sleep with him. I never meant for this to happen."
John’s brow wrinkled, and he snuggled closer to her, minding that only his upper half did, and not his stomach.
A sound of edged metal flicking against leather reached his ears as the mountain man removed a knife from a tattered belt. The curved blade - bowie, Sherlock thought - gleamed dully in the sunlight as the man above him teased at bare skin, like some sick mockery of intimacy.
Turning on the coffeemaker in the kitchenette, John filled the filters, added water, and removed some sugar from the cupboard, curious as to the quality of the final product. Staring at the little machine and watching the slow drip, he stood silently, taking advantage of the quiet. He did not bother checking on Mary, as she was a light sleeper, and she likely would not be presently interested in seeing his face. The teakettle sat solitarily on the counter, still undamaged but slightly scuffed from its fall from last night.
“Doesn’t he have that case tomorrow?” Mary asked. “I don’t mean to eavesdrop, but I could hear him discussing it with you.”
True, he had sensed a certain uneasiness in her – though not nearly so pronounced as his own – when the group first checked in, but she had adapted very well.
The cleft-palated giant freed his serrated hunting knife from its sheath and knelt beside the whore's glistening, trembling body to finish the job. He touched its smooth, hairless chest one last time, feeling the rapid hammering of a panicked heart within. Though he regretted it, that heart needed to be stopped for good.
Well-aware that it might take several hours until he received an answer from Nasim and his superiors, Mycroft fiddled with his phone and sent a quick text to Anthea asking her to bring him a cup of coffee. He would have liked a croissant to go with that but quickly shoved those thoughts into the far recesses of his mind. A cup of coffee would do just fine.
Once he had ultimately decided he was indeed not dead, he was made aware of another sensation. Something was poking at him. A branch being blown in the wind? No, he could not feel a breeze of any sort. Perhaps some carrion bird was already taking the opportunity to eat him. Opening his eyes did not help much at all, for his view was limited to the ground. John would have loved to lift his head and get a better look at his surroundings - as well as his visitor - but he could barely move. Was he even able to speak after that harrowing misadventure in the river? Opening his mouth, he managed a raspy moan.
The cabin was, frankly put, unfit for human habitation, but after seeing what these individuals were capable of, Sherlock doubted they could even be classified as people. He made a mental note to remind himself of this the next time someone complained about his untidiness at Baker Street.
Mycroft nodded, secretly relieved to have sealed the deal. "We can go get him after we've put on your nappy."
The hand fiddling with the lock, she realized, only had three fingers, and the skin was scarred and blemished, practically knotted in places, the fingernails scraggly and long, claw-like. The creature was human, but just barely. It made another maniacal, high-pitched cackling sound as it finally managed to unlock the door and reached to open it.
Three-finger himself had cut the whore's throat and watched her choke and gurgle on her own life fluid moments before she gave up the ghost and passed from this world. He had regarded with great interest and intensity as her eyes clouded over and the look in them became glassy and distant. She had large eyes, not the same bold blue as the scrawny whore, but a beautiful colour nonetheless. No one in the clan was ever born with blue eyes. It was a trait that only occurred in Outsiders with a pasty complexion.
"This is gonna sound dumb," Ferguson said, and already Sherlock wanted to snap at her to get to her point. "But there's sort of a rumor that's gone around for the past few years. It's been around since before I got here and that was ten years now... Anyway, people have talked about something being in the woods, maybe even before the seventies. The resort doesn't really like to talk about it. I dunno if you have mountain men in your country...?"
"John? Are you with me?" the detective asked, having noticed his assistant was zoning out once more. "Are you up to this? Tell me the truth."
/Don't know location// he wrote. //North of Bear Mountain// He thought of a moment. When searching for Mary, had they gone south? Where had the sun been? No, likely east. Yes, east.
“This is what might solve the case utterly,” Sherlock said, speaking as though to ignorant children. “Now if you’ll just come with me…”
Anthea was not finished with her tablet; she would likely only be finished with it when she was dead, and some probably doubted she would stop even then.
John was done with the trivialities. He could not stay here any longer. Struggling to speak to the eagerly listening stranger, all he could think of was his friend.
She gave a high-pitched giggle and continued to fondle him. "Sweetheart, there's no one here. We can do whatever we want."
"So," Mycroft continued, "what is this talk really about? If this little revelation went as well as you claim, how is Sherlock 'not fine'?"
"Young Mr. Holmes is alive. His blood pressure is stable after we transfused him with two units of blood. We have successfully extracted the soil from his airways and relieved his intracranial pressure."
"That's quite remarkable," Mary admitted. "But if that's true, he's surprisingly forgetful about some things..."
A grievously injured man with a shotgun wound and other multiple injuries had been admitted to a hospital in West Virginia, and he had given his name as Sherlock Holmes.
He quickly dove in headfirst and resurfaced next to Mary, playfully poking her side. She squealed in a mixture of delight and terror, and was quick to deliver a jab of her own to his ribs. John was glad she had mostly missed the soft part of his paunch.
"It's more than the PTSD. It's like a mental block. I can't be with them." John listened to the now slow, steady beat of Sherlock's heart within the thin chest. "I can be with you, though. That's strange, isn't it?"
"If we were standing right here," he remarked, then pointing to the left of himself and John, "and our family of hunters were using their chimney... there would be a trail of smoke right over there."
Mary playfully slapped him on the shoulder, though the blow was a little harder than usually delivered, and John gave a yelp of surprise.
The Outsider's writhing amplified, and Three-finger grabbed at the busted arm, causing a shriek of pain. The squirming ceased almost immediately. Three-finger grinned, gently stroking a pale cheek.
As if on cue, the dark-haired man stirred in his sleep, his features crunched up from the pain caused by the movement. John could see the rapid fluttering behind Sherlock's eyelids: he was in REM mode and would undoubtedly soon wake up.
A fracture, the detective instantly deduced, and a familiar one at that. Sebastian Moran had already done his best to grind that particular bone to pulp ten years ago and managed to break it in two places. The arm had held together reasonably well with the help of a surgically inserted titanium screw, but taking the brunt of such a ferocious attack turned out to be too much, even for said piece of near-indestructible metal.
"What size would you say that is?" Sherlock asked, not bothering to wait for input. "I'm an eleven..." He carefully placed his own shoe next to the gigantic boot print. It was twice as large as his own shoe.
John cried out in pain, though he surprised himself at how the cry sounded more like a roar than a high-pitched yelp. It appeared that fighting to survive against these monsters had him resorting to behave a little like them, and the very idea chilled him.
The medical evacuation members were quick and efficient as they entered the hole, escorted the elder Holmes back to the rest of the team, and began to treat his brother. Sherlock's airways were cleared of the dirt and his lungs ensured fresh oxygen, and an IV was inserted into his arm. Mycroft was surprised that his brother was able to provide a large enough vein in his present state of dehydration.
“Turn around then,” he said, folding his legs and facing the detective. Sherlock did as asked and slumped forward as he relished the cool sensation on his red skin.
Little Will tried to see things his brother's way, but what about his way? Certainly the cream helped for his rash, and deep down he understood the purpose of the diapers for his inevitable accidents, but he resented the need for both, the sense that he was still being treated like a baby. Were he older, he might have realized the irony of his predicament.
John inadvertently discovers something when looking through Sherlock's coat for pain-killers and sees no choice but to confront his friend.
Sherlock did not put on any clothes for the remainder of the night. He dug out a lukewarm can of Coke from his suitcase and quickly downed it, followed by a power bar. He refused the offer of a sandwich from Mary, claiming that the brand of butter she used did not suit his tastes.
Talking would do no good, despite Mycroft's immediate reflex to reason with him. Still, the more Sherlock struggled, the worse he made the situation; technology monitoring his life signs continued to break loose.
Sawtooth crammed his fingers inside the yelping mouth. His hands were far too big to allow any sort of power in a rebellious bite, and even so, if the whore tried in any way to fight back, the giant could easily grab onto the tongue inside and do whatever he wanted with it. The Outsider squirmed and his back arched, but he was powerless. His squeals became muffled shrieks when the pliers entered and closed around a tooth. Licking the gap of his split lip and gums, Sawtooth gripped tightly and pulled.
John thrust harder, bucking like a goat and feeling just as horny as one. He was about to reach for his partner’s hard cock, but Sherlock beat him to the act, pumping away as he bounced harder. The doctor wondered if his hips would be bruised by the end of this incident. Presently he could not care any less.
Shouts from one SWAT team member to another announced that they had cleared the area. Mycroft was shoved aside none-too-gently and the decision to open the shed door was taken from him by one of the heavily armoured Americans whose name tag identified him as J. Bening.
The man was tall but by no means a giant; perhaps six-four with a large build, although he also seemed to be lugging around on a few excess pounds. He wore a checkered shirt, which had probably once been red but was now more a ruddy brown, but at least it made him stand out amongst the many shades of forest green. The man's skull was lumpy and his face misaligned with a notable scar running across his left eye.
John quenched a sob and pressed his hand against his mouth to muffle any further sounds. Why was this happening? Just a few hours ago this had just been a regular case, and now he was literally fighting for his life. His own life, and Sherlock's. Mary's had already been brutally taken from her.
A new wave of white-hot pain flared through his trapped leg and further into every fiber of his being when he was suddenly yanked back with excessive force. The idiot had grasped the chain of the bear trap and tugged on it, snorting gleefully at the detrimental effect it had on their plaything.
John was prepared to be even more forceful, but fortunately further encouragement was not necessary. Sherlock gulped down most of the Coke, finishing up with a resounding burp.
Sherlock – despite having only one suitcase – did not even bother loading it into the car, proceeding into the back seat instead and leaving his traveling companions to the luggage.
At the moment it didn't feel like it would have mattered if he fainted and fell into the recently exhumed grave Sherlock's assailants had dug for the tortured young genius, and nobody bothered to pick him up. Fuck the Americans. Fuck the British government. And fuck John Watson.
Instead they had to make do with the scrawny whore. Sawtooth licked his row of serrated teeth and stomped toward his quarry.
"Clear my schedule and cancel all my appointments for the next two days," he ordered. "And find me a place to stay until the need arises, should it come to that, to find something more... permanent."
Huge, hairy hands closed vice-like around his shoulders and he found himself crying out. The brute lifted him off the ground, foul breath beating against his face as the monstrous thing scrutinized him with misaligned eyes. His heart lurched as he made the connection: this had to be the owner of those giant footprints.
Considering he had not picked up on Mycroft's question, he could not reliably answer "Yes" or "No" now, but lacked the means to communicate it to his brother. Frustrated by his limitations and increasingly aware of the pain wracking his body, Sherlock did the only thing in his power - he lashed out at Mycroft and attempted to break out of his protective grasp.
Even so, something in this tall, skinny prey had aroused Sawtooth's interest. This one was different from most others. The patriarch had noticed it when he first had the young man in his grasp, taking in the details of the face. Meat was meat, and those the clan took for such uses were not treated in the same regard as the family, but sometimes, once in a great while, prey would come along that almost looked... appealing. Familiar in a way. Though otherwise despicably smooth and resembling any other prey, this one's bright blue eyes were set far apart, and his jaw was weak, his neck long and thick.
Mary kicked at the wretched creature and caught him clean in the face. Her only regret was the fact that she was wearing Converse sneakers rather than stiletto heels, but she was nonetheless proud of the force behind the kick. Her attacker staggered back for a moment, clearly surprised by her ferociousness, but he did not howl or cry out, as one might expect from a fellow who had just received a vicious kick to the head. A trail of blood leaked from his aquiline nose, staining the few misshaped teeth he had left, but he quickly returned, wearing an expression on his scarred, deformed face which suggested he did not simply want to kill her, or rape her, but literally gnaw the flesh off her bones. He was actually salivating.
"And I salute your powers of observation!" the doctor snapped, angry and annoyed at the detective's need to gloat as well as his own shortcomings in the area.
"If you could step aside for the medivac team, Mr. Holmes..." the team leader said, his voice gruff but not uncouth. Mycroft looked up at him, noting the name on his tag: Ruppenkamp. Whomever he outranked likely made sure to never mispronounce or mishear that name.
Finally breaking from her astonishment, Mary numbly walked out of the room, still caught up in what she had just discovered.
"I'm still bleeding," a quiet, pained voice said. "It's less than a flow, but more than a trickle. It should slow down in the next few hours if I do nothing to aggravate it."
“Just a short while ago,” Mary explained, sitting up and facing him. “In the pool, you seemed very tense. And it’s not that I was cross with you about getting intimate in the water where we could get in trouble. I just don’t want to go into this with the wrong impression.”
"Mmphh!" The doctor tried his best to voice a protest through his gag when the smaller creature cupped his genitals and began to roll his testicles with mock gentility. Were they going to geld him? Emasculate him? He had a horrific mental image of the three-fingered cannibal tearing his penis off using only its teeth and then sharing the treat with his two companions.
He trailed off as he rose to his feet. Wobbling for a moment once more, he put a hand to his forehead. For a second, John expected him to swoon.
Mycroft instantly regretted his generous offer to read "whatever his brother wanted". It was totally inappropriate. Of course William was going to choose something inappropriate. Next he'd be requested to read 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' out loud! "No, you're too young. You wouldn't understand it."
Sherlock reached up to place a long, cool hand against the doctor's cheek. His skin was smooth and dry, without calluses. Besides working on his science experiments, Sherlock had not done much manual labour in his life.
John's heart made an extra beat when he was informed by a nurse that he had a message waiting for him, happy to finally be acknowledged by Sherlock's condescending windbag for a brother, but also terribly anxious about the contents of the message. Though Mycroft's continued presence in the US was likely to mean good news, there was a nagging voice in the back of John's head that kept telling him Mycroft was staying simply to have Sherlock's body prepared for transport.
“And I’m sorry for that, I truly am,” John continued. Mary squeezed her eyes shut, angrier than ever.
The doctor put his hands over his own face, taking a deep breath. He was too exhausted and too damned angry for this.
A grubby finger poked at his face, dirty fingernail scratching chapped lips. Sherlock fought the urge to bite again. His jaw still throbbed from the missing tooth after his latest outburst.
Mycroft continues to negotiate with the doctors about Sherlock's care. John makes his presence known.
"He's scatterbrained," John explained. "If he deems something unimportant at the time, he deletes it. I have a feeling he did that quite a bit during his childhood."
Nasim briefly looked away, obviously hesitant to bring up the subject and surprised at the straightforward question, but when he spoke his voice was steady. "We have stopped the bleeding and stitched up the area with four stitches. He might not be able to control his bowel movements until it's healed up and should be kept on a liquid diet for at least two weeks."
He left Sherlock's hospital room in search for Anthea, whom he found calmly pacing the corridor by the nurse's station. She for once did not have her phone out, which suggested that she had heard the racket going on in Sherlock's hospital room and was expecting to be approached by her employer. Mycroft gave her a quick once-over before getting straight down to business. He did not attempt to conceal his bloodied shirt or hand, knowing that Anthea, ever perceptive despite her nonchalant disposition, was going to notice anyway.
I might as well prepare something for when he wakes up, John thought. Perhaps tea... spiked with Valium. He smiled briefly at the idea but quickly rejected it; Valium was an addictive substance, and one would do best to keep Sherlock away from those altogether.
Mycroft was grateful that the hospital staff had at least had the common sense to give Sherlock a room of his own. The younger man would not be pleasant to deal with when he woke up. Correction -
John ran to catch up with her and promptly stood to block her path. His every pore exuded desperation. Mary turned her face away from him, determined not to let those pleading eyes break her resolve.
He can't keep doing this, Sherlock would think in their hiding places. The horrible thing their father would become from the drink needed to be stopped. But... damn it, Sherlock could not remember. Something about finally trying to face this awful towering man, shouting at him to stop...
The eight hour flight across the Atlantic Ocean passed in a slow kind of agony. Anthea sat opposite him the entire time, and although her attention was mostly focused on the screen of her smart-phone, she, like the ever-dutiful PA that she was, occasionally asked in a low, pleasant voice if there was anything he required.
"Mary?" John repeated, discouraged but not entirely surprised at the lack of response. He had no doubt she was still angry with him. Hell, she had every right to be after what he had done.
"He had cocaine hidden away in his flat. It took me less than five seconds to figure out where. I was impatient and tried pinching some when he was still home."
Sawtooth never lasted long, and this time was no exception. The clan leader finished with a grunt and lay limp atop his smaller charge, breathing heavily as he waited for his strength to return. Three-finger squirmed, more out of annoyance than actual distress.
Sawtooth reached for the whore's head, his massive hand easily covering the sweating face. The whore whimpered, vivid blue eyes glazed and watery and white skin flushed and glistening. Feeling the shudder beneath his palm pleased him like nothing else, and for a moment he wanted to cut into the outsider's cheek just to lick the dripping blood from the gash. But even that small amount of blood loss would take the whore closer to death all the sooner. Still, he could have some fun with his plaything without having to spill blood.
John navigated his way along the riverbank, cursing the fact that it was so steep. He needed to watch where he put his feet, or he would soon be rolling down the slope like a big, bouncy marble.
"Alright, alright. Don't get your knickers in a twist." John got up from the sofa to do Sherlock's bidding. "Although you're not wearing any that I can see."
"I'll need time, John," she said, her voice back to normal pitch. "By myself. Please don't speak to me anymore tonight. I need to think."
It was almost unfathomable that Mary was willing to wait on Sherlock despite all the problems he had caused. He did not, however, want her to be present during the talk they were bound to have once the detective woke up. It would be a big enough challenge to get Sherlock to open up to him. Mary's presence would only exacerbate things.
Sherlock plopped onto the sofa the moment he was led into the lodge. Now that he was inside, he seemed to be improving. Either that or he was beginning to act like his old self again.
John felt deeply embarrassed about the fact that Mary seemed aware of his dire financial situation and thus suggested something that would minimize their expenses. They were on vacation, dam it! Now was not the time to worry about expenses.
The man made some vain attempts to kick him, but he failed to gain any leverage and thus his blows lacked the strength to do any damage. Sawtooth held his prey at eye level, letting his foul breath wash over the man's face. Briefly the patriarch toyed with the idea of tearing out the whore's full lips and consuming them before the eyes of him and his stout friend. He decided against it, thinking he might find a better use yet for those lips.
John had not seen Mycroft or any of his associates since the elder Holmes' rude awakening of him. He had no idea how much time had passed. He was only conscious some of the time, spending long intervals either unconscious or in a haze that could only be described as something between sleep and wakefulness. It was difficult to draw a clear line between the states.
Instead of continuing with the windshield, the cackling thing jumped down from the roof and took a swing at the front passenger window, shattering it and peering inside. Mary was in disbelief that a human being could look so horrible. Giggling and grinning with more gums than teeth, it reached through the broken window for the lock.
"And I would have been here to deal with it accordingly if someone had contacted me," Mycroft swiftly replied, a warning of his own clearly written in his expression. "Now please..."
For the umpteenth time, the doctor found himself dealing with yet another one of Sherlock's lightning-fast mood swings. He was capable of going from exhilarated to moody, from angry to easy-going, from clingy to distanced, in just a few moments. This was apparently going to be one of those occasions.
Did it refrain from penetration to avoid leaving traces that could be discovered by the massive alpha? Sherlock realized it was highly unlikely that the idiot possessed the capacity for such foresight. There was a more distinct possibility that the dense creature was imitating behaviour conducted by its relatives, but lacking the knowledge to carry it out.
"Mr. Holmes, I'm so glad you could make it!" she said and vigorously shook Sherlock's hand. "I've been trying to talk to the police, but they won't listen, and I really...--" She a suddenly interrupted herself and studied John from head to toe. "And who might you be?"
There was nothing. An indent rather than an outline. Sherlock would never walk again without crutches or a prosthesis.
"Is this why you never wanted to spend the night with me?" he asked, very careful so as not to sound accusing or judgmental. "Because you were afraid I'd notice something?"
"If you'd told me, perhaps I could have been more... understanding," John said, thinking back on all those time when he'd thought of Sherlock simply being a condescending, self-absorbed git with no regard to the feelings and needs of other people. His rapid mood swings, low attention span, and oftentimes impaired judgment... it all made sense now. How could John, as a doctor, have missed all the signs? They had practically been under his very nose the whole time.
Opening his eyes, he realized the reason behind the surreal pain and numbness of his limb. In his daze he thought his leg was all but dead from the knee down. No, this was much worse.
As predicted, Mary promptly threw out John's pillow and bedspread, sending one final indisputable message that she did not want him in the same room with herself. Not that John could blame her.
"Until what, the weekend when this place actually serves food?" Sherlock asked tiredly. "We'll starve by then. AND with the rental car gone, we won't be able to go get groceries for ourselves."
However, all he could do was give the other man a glare which hopefully conveyed his message pretty well.
“Sherlock has a hold on you,” she remarked matter-of-factly. “I’ve know that since I met you. I understand that he’s beyond difficult, and that you’re one of the few people he’ll willingly interact with. You may not have much of a choice tomorrow.”
John’s eyes bulged at the message. He turned his head as though in a near panic, and finally saw a figure sitting nearby, reading a paper. Scuffed-booted legs crossed, the individual wore a gratingly familiar ratty overcoat and held a newspaper which obscured his face. The paper flipped over, and as expected, Sherlock sat with his phone activated.
"You know, it's been a long day, and we're both very tired," John said and grasped the hand stroking his chest. "We should probably... get some sleep."
He looked up at John, silently noting the sudden lack of color in his assistant's face, and though John's blame of their current situation still stung, he felt a need to provide some measure of comfort. However, comfort would wait. The kidnapped still needed to be found and their abductors sought out.
Sherlock sometimes slipped up, but John, ever the soldier, was like a clockwork. John had not updated. Not for days. A cold feeling dripped down Mycroft's spine.
A woman wandered along the dirt path, muttering the lyrics to some half-remembered song. She wore little else but a sarong loosely draped over her plump body, thin sandals protecting her feet from the ground. She was enjoying the beauty of the trees around her and the sounds of the forest.
He received no response, but Sherlock did not have to turn his head to see the aggravated look which he knew had to be on John’s face.
"Are y'alright?" the man next to him asked, likely out of instinct. John had a feeling he did not look 'alright' at all. In fact he felt like he should rightly be dead.
John flinched as a scream filled the cabin, and he nearly cried out as well. He had no idea then whether the scream was more out of pain or humiliation, although it was clearly a combination of both. Again Sherlock struggled to escape, even to crawl away from under the crushing weight, but he was locked in the grip of a beast which barely deserved to be called a man, and he was going nowhere.
No one other than Anthea noticed the soft thump of the elder Holmes' head as it lolled against the wall, nor the twitching of his limbs when he jolted back into consciousness thirty seconds later. She was tactful enough to pretend it had gone by her unnoticed.
"Like that, John?" Sherlock panted throatily, head thrown back in ecstasy. Sweat now covered his neck and torso, giving his body a sleek, glistening sheen. It almost looked as though he was glowing, particularly in the sun burnt areas.
He tried very hard to think of something he could write down that would summarize their entire horrible experience with the deformed cannibals in the most informative, concise manner possible. Mycroft at present did not need to know that his brother had been raped by a disfigured giant, even though that memory was forever going to be etched to John's retinas.
Glancing back at the giant, John's blood became ice water when he saw the man staring in his direction. Yet the brute turned away, much to the doctor's relief. John was resolute to keep his breath even and remain as calm as physically possible, given the circumstances. He could not afford to give away his position now.
Sherlock, though tempted, held back any acerbic comments he could have thrown at them. If his suspicions were true, there was no time to lose.
"Are you absolutely certain?" Sherlock asked, sounding just a little too doubtful for John's taste. Did his friend really have so little faith in him and his abilities? He might not be a genius, but he was well-aware of the consequences bound to follow an erroneous judgment. The mental image of getting stuck while trying to wriggle through the hole he had dug was, in a sense, comical, but the humorous aspect was quickly erased when he imagined one of their captors finding either him or Sherlock in such a helpless state.
"I see, Missy." The orthopedic surgeon smiled in the cautious manner of someone used to delivering less-than-stellar news. "You're a rock, but I'll take it over from here."
"It's the medication," Sherlock explained wearily, wiping his sticky hand on a paper towel. "Cessation of ejaculation is one side effect of taking Clozapine. My spurts are thus greatly reduced."
A stab of guilt struck Sherlock. Once he actually thought about it, their union had become more about his own climax, and anything felt by John had become incidental. After John had become huffy over the lack of touch, the detective simply concluded that John should be grateful that his friend had been interested in him, that the doctor should feel lucky that they were not only partners and friends, but now also comfortable with providing such pleasure for one another.
John's face twisted in annoyance at the notion, and he scrambled for the spray amidst his luggage. For someone who had wanted to vacation somewhere radically different from his home, he was really missing London.
Scrolling back on the screen display, Anthea revealed the previous number she had been able to seek out: the main number to the therapist's office. She stood silently at her employer's side as  he made the call. When a receptionist answered, the man squandered no time in getting to the point.
The meditation seemed to help, but only as far as making the duration of the dinner preparations. A clang of metal brought him out of his self-induced fog, a ladle against the pot. Eyes flying open instinctively, Sherlock looked up at his keepers, who were a little too happy to see him. The only reason they were smiling was because they had something unpleasant in store for their "guest". The one-eyed idiot was gnawing on a severed, boiled hand with the remaining molars he had left. The skinny psycho happened to be holding a barbecue fork. Their gigantic leader had produced a tray table, setting it down and covering the surface with a large bowl filled with slices of freshly boiled meat.
Mycroft's upturned senses registered every flicker of the second hand on the large, impersonal wall-clock situated above Sherlock's hospital bed as he waited for signs of increased consciousness in his sibling. He also observed Nasim; the doctor was displaying a variety of nervous tics, including but not limited to fingering almost obsessively on his stethoscope every few seconds and moving his pen in and out of his breast pocket. Having him in his constant field of vision was driving the already highly strung civil servant crazy.
Browsing through the images, John saw nothing amiss for the most part. Sarah had photographed herself in various self-indulgent poses as though she were being photographed for the shoot of an adult magazine. She had positioned herself in front of various trees and foliage. A naturist in nature, as it were. One of the last photos depicted not Sarah but the forest in general. The trees seemed to go on forever, the skies a deep blue with very few clouds.
“It would have helped before we got there!” John replied. “Where in the world are we supposed to find food, a petrol station?”
The whore screamed. The tooth seemed to be a healthy one. It thus proved stubborn to remove, but Sawtooth twisted the pliers, not bothering with any amount of gentility. The body beneath him was hard as iron, rigid in agony. Finally the tooth came loose, and blood sprayed in a red mist from the Outsider's mouth as he continued to scream.
Eventually the aging giant gathered his weight off his son and struggled to his feet. He was getting old; there was no denying that. The thought of his eventual passing left him agitated every time. Who would lead the clan when he was gone? Three-finger? How would his reckless, impetuous son fare against the hordes of hostile Outsiders which threatened the family practically on a daily basis? A clan member always had to be on his guard nowadays. The Outsiders kept sending out their piggies, with their ridiculous hats and annoying little guns, believing they could best the clan. Fortunately most piggies they'd happened upon had been young men lacking in both wit and experience, thus making them easy prey.
"Oftentimes I can't sleep," Sherlock explained. "My head... is filled with noise. My thoughts are racing, and I can't seem to make it stop. If I stay in bed, it only gets worse. So I go sit in the closet. Sensory deprivation helps. The noise becomes manageable, even if it never goes away completely. After a few hours in there, I can crawl back out and face the world again. Right as rain, as it were." He finished with a mirthless chuckle.
John was presently muttering out every expletive he could think of. He had reached the river quite quickly, but the current was immeasurably strong. John thought himself a decent swimmer, but this surge would unquestionably wash him downstream. The doctor considered running along the shore until he could find a more manageable area to swim across... but what if he was followed? What if the water there was shallow enough for his attackers to wade through?
"The Terminal. It's a movie. Never mind," John sighed. "Mary's right, though. We can't spend the night here. If we get lost, we'll just have to stop to ask the locals for directions."
Restraints for a one-legged patient? Mycroft thought derisively but did not speak the words out loud. He agreed it was the best option available.
Though Mycroft kept his attention on the trees below, scanning for any vague hint of the presence of his brother’s kidnappers, his mind was doggedly harassed by that horrible little feeling of worry. Sherlock had been his responsibility ever since the puerile little brat had been born. He was supposed to protect his brother. And yet somehow Sherlock always found a way, deliberately or otherwise, to prove his efforts were in vain.
As a small child, One-Eye had at times envisioned his hand being similar to that of his primary caregiver, but now that such a possibility was imminent, he no longer wanted it. He tried flexing his fingers, and though all five digits obeyed his command, the two which had been bit were slower to respond, and the movement caused fresh blood to seep from the gashes.
John remembered the blissful fogginess brought by the painkillers he'd been on after being shot, and how tempting it had been to keep taking them even after the pain abated. Other than that, John had never experienced substance addiction, even though he did his best to empathize.
“Come on,” John said, grabbing the camera bag and then placing an arm around Sherlock’s back. “We’ll deal with this at the lodge.”
"As you can see, he has yet to regain consciousness, and thus we haven't extubated him," Nasim said.
The sun was setting behind the hills and treetops, and she felt the need to look over her shoulder several times to make sure no one was following her. Even though the place had felt relatively safe in the day, the resort was still in the middle of nowhere, and the darkness made it all the more unsettling. Mary had taken the chance to ask a staff member about the guidelines of the resort’s etiquette, and as expected, Avalon was expected to be anything but a swingers' club. Even so, as evidenced by the men who had approached her, some rule-breakers still slipped through the cracks.
The whistling was barely audible to Sherlock, but the faint sound was enough. He grabbed at the kettle urgently and poured it into his mug as though desperately making a life-saving elixir, not caring just how much or little the tea itself would steep. Unfortunately, his urgency also left him careless. The hot water splashed onto his hand and he jumped away, shouting a curse as the kettle hit the floor with a loud clatter.
John turned his head to look into the closet space. All of Mary's clothes, as well as her luggage bags, were still within. John stared mutely at the items for a few very long seconds while his over-worked and agitated brain did its best to process the sight and how it was connected to Mary's absence. The good news was that she had apparently not left for England in a fit of rage, but the bad news was that they had no idea where she'd gone.
He heard a gruff shout, barely any words he could decipher. Did this clan even speak or understand English anymore, he wondered. The shorter creature all but toddled over to the tallest and received a harsh jostle for his troubles. Though neither of the monsters were ideal to combat, John hoped that few would remain few, and that no others were waiting to surprise him. The last thing he or Sherlock needed was to combat ten inbred lunatics.
“Oh, poor thing,” she gave him a peck on the nose for his less than stellar score. “Looks like ‘Shocker Ellshom’ is giving you quite a fight.”
When the clan leader stood up, he could spot his son in the corner, hunched over and back towards him, busy playing with the scrawny whore. Some of the shrieks had been from their captive. Sawtooth let out a guttural growl of warning, but Three-finger was so wrapped up in his own game that he didn't even hear it.
Had it been like this when he was shot for the first time in the Afghan desert? He could remember the raw pain, the blazing sun, the crisp desert sand against his face, the deafening, smattering noises of bullets fired in all directions, and human voices shouting in a mixture of languages, some friendly, others not.
The muffled curses, undignified for a gentleman of Mycroft's staunch character, were not enough to drive Sherlock over the edge, but the disappointed sigh, undoubtedly accompanied by a familiar eye-roll, which followed them was.
Bobbi took a bottle of bottled water from her mini fridge and took a seat opposite them in the armchair. Sherlock elegantly crossed his long legs and leaned forward, resting his chin against the tips of his fingers.
The idiot was leaned over him, its one functioning eye intently focused on his face. Sherlock doubted the simple creature could understand much if any of the pain they inflicted upon their victims, but as always, the mid-sized cannibal studied him with practically childlike inquisitiveness.
Mycroft waits for news on Sherlock's surgery and busies himself by seeing to the practical arrangements.
Sherlock focused on breathing deeply and tried his best to block out the disturbing aromas and noises assaulting his senses. He could not re-enter his mind palace now - his body was in too much agony to allow for such an escape - but he could attempt to apply a meditation technique taught to him by his first psychotherapist, to whom he had been referred as a young teenager for "anger management issues". The meditation technique was the only useful thing Sherlock had picked up from months of therapy, although it had helped him little in his dealings with life later on.
Sawtooth was first through the door and Three-finger nearly bumped into him, not expecting the leader to stop mid-entrance. One-Eye sat on an otherwise empty bed, looking all the more suspicious in his attempts to appear innocent. The whore was nowhere to be seen.
The receptionist, now looking like she had caught onto Sherlock’s jab, was no longer smiling. At least it meant her teeth were no longer showing. She handed him some keys, their number engraved into the metal.
Oddly enough, the detective found no solace in the woman's tears. True, he hated her for having latched onto John and for the possibility that she might take John away for good, but despite everything, Mary was not to blame in this mess. John had,  in a quite literal sense, screwed her over as well.
Mary held the door open with her body as they left the building, and Sherlock leaned his head against John’s for a few seconds. John’s expression hardened as a thought occurred to him, that the detective was not quite as weak and disoriented as he let on, that he was merely conning some sympathy out of his assistant.
"Sherlock," he tried again. "I did some research... online, while you were asleep. I know this is Clozapine."
Hoping but still in doubt, John placed his fingers through the gap in the boards again. He began to think Sherlock would not do the same, either too weak or too dejected to bother, but the doctor felt thin fingers against his own.
Thus far, nothing set off his suspicion. No strange smells in the air, no sounds save for the wildlife, a breeze, and a nearby air vehicle chopping away in the sky. However, as he continued to walk, he perked up as the last noise increased in volume. Three-finger looked upward, searching for any sign of the machine. Normally when they flew overhead, they passed by without fuss. This one was getting louder. It was getting closer.
"Don't," Mycroft ordered and figured he had to explain himself upon noting the surprised, skeptical look sported by the nurse. "Not yet. I've got this under control. Another stranger coming here to prod at him will only cause him further distress."
"Shotgun wound in the right shoulder, some smaller puncture wounds on his lower torso. Found on the riverbank, so he's likely been in the river. He's hypothermic and appears to have respiratory problems, no foreign objects lodged in his airways. Possible infection, appears lucid at times, but is unresponsive to speech. Pupils react normally to light, so there's no present suspicion of brain damage."
“And he’ll be a massive infant about it,” John said, browsing the images on the software. His statement had no annoyance or worry about them. He knew how Sherlock would behave for a fact, and nothing would stop it. Short of a powerful sedative, anyway.
"One can presume there will be worse damage as time continues," Mycroft said with an eerie evenness, staring at the paper, almost as though he refused to look at John. When he finally did, he saw the helpless look on the doctor's face. He swallowed and blinked, eyelids fluttering, before peering down at the infirmed man.
Mary gave a sly smile as she unscrewed the lid. “Do you suppose I should apply it while he’s asleep?” To her, the idea of smearing something onto a conscious Sherlock was like trying to give a rabid dog a flea bath.
"Sherlock and I have to talk," the doctor stated, and suddenly the pill in his robe pocket felt as though it physically burned his skin through the fabric. "It's... personal. We need a moment. Please, Mary."
"You'd understand the words, but not the concepts. I'll let you read it yourself when you're seven."
"I'm not taking that one," Sherlock said with a grimace. "You've had it in your sweaty palm! The engravings are all blotted out."
"Haven't thought about it," Sherlock muttered, trying his best to sound non-committal, but John knew that was a lie. It was obvious that thoughts of Moran's imminent release had plagued his mind quite a bit.
Medical staff wasted no time in their response to the call button and arrived within less than a minute. Whilst one nurse attempted to retrieve his IV so that it could be reinserted, another joined the civil servant in holding Sherlock down. The look on her face, more a frown than a glare, was directed right at Mycroft. She was looking to him for an explanation. Granted, the smeared blood on the sheets justified her mystification.
Sherlock immediately wanted to throw up, but a massive hand clamped over his lips. The smallest hunter held him down with its own weight to keep the young detective from struggling. He felt himself back in the same place only hours before, about to be poisoned and choked by the giggling maniac. This time he found himself unable to vomit, perhaps from the plain and terrible fact that he was far too hungry and weak to be sick from a mouthful of human flesh. Instead he chewed. He hated it but he chewed, feeling the juices crawl down his throat.
Something else that struck him as odd was the big man's jerky gait, his childlike laughter, and the candid look of joy on his face as he swung the axe around, seemingly on random, with what could only be described as great enthusiasm.
Mycroft, now pleasantly buzzed, snorted at the transparency of the excuse. Sherlock's sole reason for joining Doctor Watson and the Morstan woman had been jealousy, pure and simple. Sherlock was in love with his assistant and abhorred at the idea of John spending quality time with someone else. And John Watson, the fool, had virtually no idea, as he'd demonstrated during their webcam chat a few days back.
"A taxi is here to take us to the hotel," she announced, walking with him and waving toward a hallway where an elevator awaited.
The nurse assisting him complied, retrieving the solution as the doctor himself disengaged the IV bag of lactated Ringer solution with propofol.
"I wouldn't say that," Sherlock replied, two whole minutes afterwards. His head twitched; a weird tic the detective sometimes displayed when an idea hatched inside his brilliant mind.
The family had gone through several employees in the same fashion, and Sherlock had barely ever put any thought into the reason why. Even when he had, he decided it was the fault of the incompetent hired help, and never his own for being so difficult, Mycroft's opinion be damned.
"No, we've already examined it, and it's a dead end," the detective murmured, his brow furrowed deep in concentration. "We should follow these tracks instead."
"Use it, as always," his friend said. "Think of it as the same scenario as all others. Mary won't be found without us."
Mycroft had felt the officer's resentment at first glance. The most likely explanation was that J. Bening had probably had some past altercation with an Englishman that made him wary of anyone with a British accent, and the elder Holmes knew by now that his personality rarely drew out the best in other people. Showing open hostility would jeopardize his employment as a member of the SWAT team, and J. Bening was well aware of this. His temper had not done him any favours in the past. Smoldering glances and an attitude that could at best be guised as cold professionalism was as far as he was willing to take it.
Instinct brought John to struggle in vain against his bonds. However, his snarl was rendered pathetic by the gag, and he received a punch to the stomach for his troubles. He could only watch as his partner was hoisted off of where he once hung and carried away by the giant like a slab of meat.
Mary felt a sudden tightening in her throat and before she even knew it, she was fighting back tears. She knew that driving in her current condition was not a safe option and hazarded a stop by the roadside, as far out on the shoulder as possible, just in case.
The cabin was an old-fashioned timber cottage with very little space, although it did have - thank the lord - two separate bedrooms. Sherlock was quick to simply dump his luggage on the floor and immediately occupy the bathroom. John and Mary could soon hear the sound of running water. While John was pleased that his flatmate had decided to wash himself, he couldn't help but worry that there would be no hot water left for the rest of them.
Sherlock very much wanted to continue the search, but unless John managed to contain his emotions, he would be of no use, perhaps even a danger to them both. Though the abductors hardly possessed the intellect of a criminal mastermind, they were undoubtedly dangerous folk, and if the clan truly had managed to evade capture for the past sixty years or more, they were a force to be reckoned with.
This will be within your control, he silently told himself. The actual discovery of the property from above had been the difficult part. The rest will be within your control.
Nasim made a point out of looking straight at the bite mark on the civil servant's hand. "Do we need to worry about more of that?" he asked gravely.
Sherlock shrugged. "I'll do what's necessary to blend in. This is no different. But Sarah... What if coming here was not enough for her? Her exhibitionistic streak might have eventually demanded something riskier... like the risk of being seen naked by someone outside the grounds of the resort."
John managed a sad smile. “The best I’ve ever had. Honest. But I needed more than that. The thing is… I figured this was just how you were. And I wasn’t about to try and change you like some reform school kid.”
And look at how things had progressed. Two sons, one of which killed their mother when she finally spat him from her loins and grew up to be a half-wit. The other was showing the worst of his nature by acting out, just because of Sawtooth's latest prisoner.
After about thirty seconds, the hand on his mouth quickly went to his jaw, like someone forcing their dog to swallow a pill. And swallow he did. He nearly began sobbing, but he swallowed.
An eight-week stay at an exclusive detox clinic arranged by Mycroft had cured his physical addiction to opiates, but Sherlock, who found a life without artificial stimulants increasingly dull, simply substituted one drug for another, and hence began his addiction to cocaine.
Sherlock proceeded to slam his cast-covered forearm hard against the side bars of his hospital bed, pulling Mycroft from his thoughts. A sickening crack of something breaking could be heard, and the elder Holmes dearly hoped it was the cast and not the ulna Dr. Nasim had spent hours piecing together in the operating theatre. He hated the thought of Sherlock losing another limb due to his own stupidity.
“You complained of a headache earlier.” John’s expression softened as he finally got to the point of his confrontation. “I thought I might help by getting out your pill bottle.”
The cruel little voice from earlier returned, suggesting that looking for clues was not all the detective and the good doctor were up to in the woods. Mary had a sudden and most unwanted mental image of Sherlock deep-throating John against a massive tree and almost swerved into a ditch.
Missy was not deterred. If Mycroft was not faced with the fate of his brother and figuratively running on petrol fumes, he might have been impressed by her.
"Hurry," Sherlock hissed, desperate to be rid of this place and these horrible bastards once and for all. John saw the willowy fingers outstretched beyond the hole and nearly took hold of them on the spot. Instead, he eased himself onto his stomach and crawled forward.
John picked up on the way the civil servant said 'friendship'. The warnings from the past rang clear in his memories.
Even in the blur of the laptop screen, John could see Mycroft pursing his lips at the remark. He was getting suspicious of this conversation.
John had planned to simply assault the dry, brittle plywood until it broke and allowed him to break the boards free, but before he could get started, Sherlock's fingers shot out through the crack to grasp at his hand.
Forest. Acre upon acre of forest, as far as the eye could see. It was truly one of the least developed states in all of America. Mycroft wearily rubbed his temples as his keen, expert gaze swept across the fluttering green treetops far below. A vast field of nothingness.
John suddenly recalled one of the numerous conversations he'd had with Mycroft, and how the nature of it had made him feel very uncomfortable at the time. Until now, he had not fully understood the purpose of the conversation, or the elder Holmes' aversion to there being anything besides friendship between the doctor and his little brother.
If John had ever been dangerously close to punching Sherlock in the face, now was that time. He balled his hand into a fist behind his back instead, biting back further objections, which he knew would only serve to rile Sherlock up.
John had to fight not to lean into the touch. "Sherlock, stop it," he warned. "This is inappropriate, I have a girlfriend now."
Sherlock clung to his brother in a desperate but weak grip as he attempted to focus. The strangely random thought occurred to him that for having such issues with his weight, Mycroft had always possessed very thin, delicate wrists. The consulting detective could distinctly remember those wrists, recall the smell of almond moisturizing cream on them when both brothers were young.
John gestured at his breathing apparatus, which was unfortunately now a necessary evil. The American doctors had obviously decided that his lungs were not strong enough to manage the oxygen transport to his body's tissues just yet, and John was tempted to believe them. He felt like shit run over twice. He was most likely also being given intravenous antibiotics to counter the pneumonia and every other infection his body might have picked up. With a slight shudder, John wondered if any of the shotgun pellets were still embedded in his flesh.
"Touch me some more," Sherlock implored in a husky voice. John felt the first stir of arousal in the pit of his stomach, and then Sherlock was on him, kissing him ferociously while his hands did everything in their power to open John's robe without breaking the kiss.
Despite his poor state and compromised health, Sherlock fought as though at the zenith of his strength. In his distress he either noticed his impaired speech or had foregone speech entirely in his panic, because now he simply shouted and wailed. Nurses would very well be showing up at any moment and running straight into what likely looked like a failed exorcism, based on Sherlock's carrying on and agonized contorting alone.
It did not take them long to reach a decision. This side of Bear Mountain was no longer safe for their little group of three.
More photos – again from the Avalon public grounds – decorated the tables and shelves. All of them were of Sarah’s stay in the resort. No photos of the infamous Rich could be found. Though John was careful to exclusively observe and not touch anything, Sherlock was more than comfortable in moving things about, stirring up dust. The doctor’s nose twitched at the sudden irritation.
"A little more discretion, a little less impertinence," he muttered. Certainly he always approached any and all scenarios with caution, but those he met did not have to know this. After all, this was the inspection of a potential therapist, not the interrogation of a criminal.
“Umm, which cabin was reserved for two?” John blurted, stepping forward. He tried his best innocent grin and pointed at Mary, who was looking ready to come inside and ask what was keeping him. “The missus is rather tired. We’ve come all the way from JFK.”
Besides, he had promised to meet with Mary at the indoor pools after their talk with Bobbi Ferguson. Would his girlfriend be there already, waiting for him to show up?
Correction: John Watson and his current beau, Mary Morstan, had been going on a vacation to the Appalachian mountains, and Sherlock had joined them, uninvited, with the promise of a case. A case. In America.
The quiet of the room was interrupted by the sound of a door opening, Mary's bedroom door to be precise. Sherlock did not seem to respond whatsoever, still staring at the laptop screen, but John looked up at her as she leant against the door frame. Wearing an oversized t-shirt, she looked surprisingly well-rested for having cried herself to sleep the previous night, based on what he heard from sleeping on the couch. Even so, her eyes still betrayed the sadness of discovering John's infidelity. John wanted to apologize but it just seemed empty to do so anymore. He had been an egotistical idiot and wanted to make things right, but he did not know how.
Of course, Sherlock considered. With only three members of their clan - the third appearing to be relatively useless in comparison - killing off anyone within their group would only be a last resort. Still, the massive alpha had been dead serious in his threat, because his smaller companion had finally acquiesced.
"I... I didn't mean it like that," John tried, but everything he could think of to use for his defense suddenly seemed hollow, if not downright ludicrous. Instead he had to fight back the urge not to simply scream
Sherlock tried to lift his hands in order to feel his surroundings and thereby hoping to gain information that his eyes currently weren't able to provide through his other senses. A sharp, stabbing pain shot through his right arm, and the detective realized the limb was much heavier than usual and also slow to respond to commands from his brain. Now on the verge of panic, Sherlock began to trash about, desperate to free himself from the equipment restricting his mobility.
"Mary, could you get a sheet from his bed?" John asked. "I know he's sweating right now, but once that stops, he'll be cold instead."
The taller of the pair gestured towards the woods in a direction opposite of John, and grumbled out another unintelligible command. Shortly thereafter, they grabbed an oil lamp, ignited it, and walked in that direction.
Sherlock felt his ear twitch when he heard something sizzling, likely pieces of the meat. He was determined to refuse any meat they might provide. Was there any chance that the carcass they'd brought in was that of an animal? Knowing what he did about the monsters holding him captive, he doubted it. There had to be other things to eat, right? Fruits, vegetables, roots… The family would have developed scurvy otherwise. If anything, the clan might also gather canned goods or nearby berries from the woods. He would only eat these, and not what was sizzling in the nearby pot, because the more he thought about it, the less he could convince himself that the meat being prepared was not Mary Morstan.
Opening the door to the indoor pool, John was hit with the strong smell of chlorine. Not that he was surprised. In a nudist resort, it made sense to maintain as high of a hygiene statute as possible. It was supposedly the reason people could not wear bathing suits when using the pool or hot-tub. Even so, enough stories of people contracting horrendous infections from public Jacuzzis had put him off to using them, chlorine levels or not.
Curse that pale whore! Everything had gone amiss since they procured it, and now it seemed to have some strange hold over Sawtooth, compelling him to keep it alive. Three-finger wanted nothing more than to see it die.
Furious at being challenged, the giant gave a toothy snarl of his own, soon followed by a thunderous roar, not unlike that of a bear. Sherlock dared not move his head in fear of slitting his own throat, or provoking the little beast to actually slice him, but his eyes keenly followed the heated exchange about to take place. Even now he could not stop his brain from jumping to a chain of deductive reasoning triggered so easily by the slightest observation. Right now it was trying to calculate probability as for which of the two would come out the victor in case the small one kept challenging their leader, which in turn could mean life or death to him.
"Yes," the woman replied forlornly. She gave a joyless chuckle as she reminisced. "They were celebrating their wedding anniversary and decided to go exploring the woods. We all joked that because they were drunk they were trying to be kinky out there, having sex with the wildlife watching them."
He tried to remind himself that at least it would not be John's, as the inbred hicks had not brought a body with them when they came back for him. The amount of blood on the little one's overalls suggested a successful kill, but what had they done with his friend's remains? Dismembered him for easier disposal?
Sherlock raised his head enough to look at his partner, a confused and impatient crease between his brows.
"It's alright," John repeated. "I'm quite alone. Those bastards are out looking for me in the woods. Don't worry. Both of them are far away."
Though a coffee maker was readily available in his room, alas the options for tea were limited. He headed downstairs to the dining hall, where his choices were sadly only slightly more varied. Hopefully the temperature of the water would kill anything which might be thriving within the teabags.
Opening his eyes seemed to be both the easiest and most difficult thing to do, but he needed to know where he was. Whatever had happened, he was too stuck in the mental mire to take solace in his mind palace...
Why did she agree to go on a trip to this godforsaken place with him? Mary suddenly wondered if she ought to curse the day she met John Hamish Watson, as her life had turned exceedingly complicated ever since they began dating, and not in a good way. In retrospect, she realized she most likely would have turned down the doctor's advances had she known about the tall, alabaster-skinned consulting detective he called his flatmate.
Almost immediately John looked away. He could not bear to see his friend treated in such an abhorrent way. Sherlock was so very, very proud, and to watch his honour be taken from him by a clan of inbred degenerates was truly breaking John's heart.
A shrill cackle that nearly did not sound human followed from above. Whatever had landed on the roof was now laughing at her predicament, at her scream of terror.
John considered making a mad dash for the door the moment his wrists were lowered down, but the soldier in him told him that would be most unwise; the degenerates were bound to catch him within seconds, and even if he somehow managed to evade recapture, he'd be leaving Sherlock to a horrible fate.
John's brow lifted a little in disbelief. "Considering what he did to Sherlock, I'm a little surprised that you didn't have him done away with."
"Yes, that's it. Are you alright, mister? You look kinda pale." The nurse took a hesitant step toward him, hand stretched out in front of her, but the look in John's eyes made her stop dead in her track.
"Of course not, he's Sherlock Holmes." Mycroft stated this as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "It's all new to him, Doctor. He's afraid - no, terrified - to let anyone close. And with good reason."
As almost always, Sherlock had been right. The cabin soon came into view; a primitive, squat, and altogether ominous piece of construction that looked completely out of place in a contemporary setting. Built for sure without modern commodities such as electricity, running water, or even a toilet, John wondered if the cabin had been erected sometime during the American civil war. Possibly when the clan first arrived here. The mere thought made him shudder.
“That could be anywhere,” Mary said matter-of-factly. John was about to nod when something caught his eye.
"It could be too late," Sherlock broke in. "They probably already suspect that we're on their tail, and by the time we've managed to convince the incompetent fools with the so-called local police force that there are murderous mountain men roaming the woods, they'll be long gone. And Mary will be dead."
When simple use of fists did not please it, the little beast finally slammed its head against Sherlock's. The detective flitted in and out of consciousness from the blow, and his vision blurred when he tried to look up at his attacker. Disoriented, Sherlock instinctively struggled to remain conscious until the pain of his arm and leg snapped him into full awareness again.
John let out a breath he hadn't released he was holding, and slowly he also released his spastic hold on the stone. The immediate danger seemed to be over for now, but the doctor was utterly lost as far as how to proceed from here. Without Sherlock he truly was lost, both literally and figuratively. The detective always took the initiative and made the decisions, John blindly following his experienced lead. He had virtually been doing the same in Afghanistan; taking orders from his superiors without question. It made him feel… secure, somehow. Forced to make his own decisions, John quickly felt his fate spiraling out of control.
Mycroft blinked, a concentrated effort, as though in the full second that his eyes had closed, he was composing himself. As much of an arsehole as Sherlock's brother was, he still cared... just a little.
The absence of a window in the small office-turned-resting space made it impossible for him to estimate the time he'd been asleep, but if his internal clock was anything to go by, he'd guess no more than two hours… but the jetlag might also have impacted his sense of time. There was no way to be sure.
"He'll be right over," a deeply tanned young female nurse informed him and his PA, speaking of Nasim.
John decided to use a bit more force to still her roaming hand and simultaneously withdrew from the embrace. "Not here, Mary. We could get arrested."
Sherlock ploughed on and only stopped when John insisted he rehydrate, and even then John nearly had to shove the bottle of water into the consulting detective's mouth. The second time he offered his water, Sherlock refused, but only because he saw something further down the road, and he bolted onward, wordless in his expectation of his assistant to follow. Chasing after him, the source of Sherlock's interest soon became clear to John. In the distance were the familiar colors and shapes of cars.
Turning over, he scrambled for his phone, picking it up with unsteady hands and speed-dialing his brother's number. Silence followed on the other line for a moment, and to his disappointment, a recorded female voice stated that the call could not be completed due to a lost signal.
"Why do I feel a "but" coming on...?" Mary asked, her previously jovial face clouded with worry. John hated himself for letting his insecurities affect their relationship negatively, but he also knew that there was no hope for them unless he was honest; or as honest as he could bring himself to be, anyway.
Your brother, Mycroft noted. His suspicions that Sherlock's general situation had been explained prior were confirmed.
"Mary is gone!" John snapped, clenching his hands and standing from his seat. "Yes, she's taken the car, yes, we are without food, YES, our phones are not functioning. And I have no idea what my relationship with her is presently, but I still care about her and she is GONE."
Sherlock watched his small, brave friend collapse into a heap on the floor, and briefly wondered how John would have felt knowing he landed face-first in Sherlock's lap.
Mary did not notice the sudden stiffening in his body, or she mistook it for something else. Encouraged by his initial response, she pressed even closer and gave him several open-mouthed kisses as one of her hands discretely snuck downward to investigate. Her touch made John twitch as though he'd been burned. Suddenly this all seemed like a very bad idea.
“Now there is a matter of taste with this resort, but I’m sure that if you could deal with me, a little lack of clothing shouldn’t be that difficult to adjust to.”
As promised by the memory, he stayed safe. The arms around him were strong and did not let go. The smells and sounds of his surroundings did little to distract him in his little bubble of security.
