It’s a good sign James is owning some of this. Bruce nods and wipes his hand on his pajama pants before he reaches for the baton. He knows that scrubbing up before touching the equipment is better lab etiquette but it will only make the scanner seem that much more official.  Better to act like it’s not a big deal.
His eyes close as he brings his coffee up to his lips, and then the sigh Clint lets out after he swallows is pure filth.
“In-two-three-four... out-two-three-four...  In-two-three-four... out-two-three-four...  In-two-three-four... out-two-three-four...”
Steve’s pretty sure the only way the milkshake brag is true is if Clint’s ordering five a day, and hearing Clint call himself uncle is so ridiculous it brings a smile to Steve’s face no matter how bleak things feel.
The confirmation for Tony’s spot in the rehab facility comes while they eat their dinner.  Tony passes out against the couch cushions after only half a bowl.  Steve finishes his own soup and breadsticks and then carefully picks Tony up and carries him to his bed.  Tony doesn’t stir.  Steve tucks him in securely then pads out.  He leaves the door open a crack.
Steve stays where he is, just outside the elevator and Tony gestures pointedly to his sofa.  Natasha gives Steve a nudge on the back to get him moving forward and they both sit down on the couch.
“I’ve got a lot of people who owe me favors,” Tony says.  “Not all of them are at the bottom of the Potomac.  And no one needs to know he’s here until we’ve got some kind of deal in place.”
Real life's been hard, but I've never started a fic I haven't finished! This one will get there, too, I promise!
He manages to infuse so much disapproval in the last word, Steve might as well have walked naked into a nunnery.  Steve laughs.
“He’s always been like that. There was this one time he--” James stops so suddenly he chokes on the word.
!" Steve explodes. Like he's been holding it in for days and Tony's finally given him a convenient place to shout.
“I was,” Tony admits. “I’m not in the mood for another lecture and everyone knows you’re a Boy Scout.”
Once outside, they’re on a tiny back patio, hidden from the alley by large, blue-painted, planks of wood.  There’s a picnic table and a trash can and not much else.
James doesn’t answer right away. He weighs it like he weighs out everything. Like a person making his own decision for the first time in seventy some years.
Tony doesn’t appear to be listening. Tony’s more interested in laying the sponge down on Steve’s laptop keyboard.
Whatever he was about to say might be a memory. It might also be something less tangible. Whatever it was it obviously scares the bejezus out of him.
Bruce hadn’t referenced Tony’s last name when he mentioned him as a friend, but it’s no surprise that the soldier put it together.
James is sitting up when Bruce enters. Clint is next to him on the bed, sleeping peacefully under the blanket.
“Looking good, Doc,” Tony greets.  “Something we should know?” He gestures toward Bruce’s ‘I Heart Hawkeye’ shirt with a raised eyebrow.
Steve watches her step behind the security desk and then swipe herself into an unmarked door.  He understands why.  There crowd in the lobby keeps growing, and dozens of flash bulbs are going off in and outside the building.  Steve can’t get to the street without pushing hard through the crowd, so he moves to the edges to wait it out.  From here, he hears clearly when the photographers start giving Tony a hard time, trying to get a rise out of him.  No doubt they’re paid more for their pictures if Tony makes a scene.
It only gets more obscene from there.  The abuse spewed in Tony’s direction sets Steve’s nerves on edge in a way that makes his hand itch for his shield.  Today would be a good day for target practice.
"I love you too, Tony." Steve responded in a hushed tone before one final kiss to Tony's cheek. "Now, sleep." he playfully ordered, running his fingers through his still-damp hair before finally drifting off back to sleep, content knowing he was with the one he loved.
taking Tony like he's asked this whole time. Tony's (now, not-so-quiet) moans turning into high pitched gasps and something in him finally jumped, causing him to spring up, bracing himself on one shoulder, sitting up just a little, the other arm still hooked around Steve's neck pulling Steve in closer so he could bite his neck. Not even necessarily to cause any marks, as they both knew damn well that wouldn't work, more to muffle himself, drawing up his body so tight as he cried and
length slowly dragging inside and nearly out of him over and over. The way his voiced had cracked when he begged Steve-
The faint sound of a door creaking open had awoken Steve. He knew it was him again, but he also didn't want to place the unnecessary guilt of Tony waking him up on him. Steve just laid there, completely the same as he was as he kept one eye partly squinted open, watching Tony walk into the bathroom, carefully shutting the door behind him. Steve exhaled, shifting a little on the bed. He heard the water from the shower running in the bathroom, he quickly propped himself up on one elbow and turned to look at the alarm clock on the nightstand. It was currently 3:43am. Sadly, this wasn't the latest Tony had ever come to bed...when he did come to bed that is. Steve knew it was worsening by the day. And it hurt him knowing how he didn't wake up to Tony beside him that much anymore. After Ultron, how his self-hatred only grew, something he wasn't telling Steve was bothering him more and more every day.
That isn't to say however that Steve didn't keep his distance after the fact though, once he had time to think about what had happened, he told himself he shouldn't have let himself go and say the things he said. Shouldn't have called Tony 'sweetheart' and told him the things he did, especially in front of Pepper. Steve slowly distanced himself at first, telling himself Tony would still be better off without him. In the end, he knew it had to be true. Tony was married, he had a child who he loved more than anything, he was getting along just fine without him for the past seven years, he figured that's how things should be, despite how he felt.
"Get some rest, Tony. You need some rest." Steve shushed him, wrapping him closer in his arms as he laid down with him. "You're so good, baby. We'll talk in the morning, okay?
. One arm was wrapped around Tony's chest, while another hand held one of Tony's legs up on his shoulder. Tony arched his back just a bit to both angle his position and to lean his head back as far as he could into the bed. The next thing he knew, Steve was beginning to push into him in what was an agonizingly slow pace. God, he still felt so fucking
right in his ear, giving him soft kisses around his ear. Whispering, Steve had found, was a thing for Tony. Actually, Steve had discovered
Steve hears him and just shushes him softly, turning his head still rested upon him to gently rub his thumb against his bottom lip before leaning up to kiss him. "It's okay, Tony. I'm here, I'm here. I got you, sweetheart." He begins to pull out slowly, causing Tony to whine against his lips, the crying he's been holding back falling from his lips. Everything was just so much and he didn't know what to do anymore, all he knew was he wanted Steve, and that he trusted him. That's why he just smiled against Steve's lips when he whispered gentle words and promises that he would stay by his side and that he'd never let him go. If there was anything he was sure of, it was Steve.
Steve knew he wasn't going to give up this argument any time soon. He wanted to say it was okay, and that saving a larger portion comes with a price, which is unfortunately true, the whole reason why some despite the Avengers; because they can't save everyone. And Steve would be lying if he said it didn't bother him either, certain missions kept him up at night too, unable to sleep because of the guilt. But what bothered Steve about this certain situation was he knew at the center of all this guilt, was Tony's self-hatred and feelings that he could've done better.
Steve couldn't help but kiss him hungrily as he sped up his pace, not knowing what else to do besides prove to Tony that he
if it meant protecting Bucky from the pain he didn't deserve. And he came fairly close to doing so too, the only thing stopping him being the earlier choice to take off Tony's helmet, and then to stop himself. Tony felt as if he couldn't blame Steve though. He knew Bucky was Steve's everything, that he had been secretly longing to have him back since he found out he was alive, he always knew deep down he could never compare. That Steve would choose Bucky over Tony any day, despite having been in a relationship with Tony for about three years. Tony always knew he could never be Bucky, but he also couldn't help but let emotion get the best of him and feel so
, Steve. And don't think I didn't think incredibly long and hard about this. I know what I have, but I also am fully aware and miss what I don't have." Tony smiled again, lifting his head from Steve's chest, giving him the smallest of kisses just under his chin. "Listen to me, honey, I know what you're thinking. About Pep, listen...Pepper knows. She has known. You know her, she's amazing. She knows me so well, she's known how I felt for so long. She never said it, but I know she's always known. Damn her, I think it's one of real reasons she told me to come back," Tony chuckled to himself, smiling again. Steve looked skeptical, and of course, why wouldn't he be?
Eventually Steve finally gave in and collapsed against Tony, quick to roll off of him, seeing Tony was already struggling to breathe. Needless to say, he still kept a leg in between his thighs, his knee slightly nudging against his softening cock; his cock still inside of him, not wanting to move just yet; and his arms cuddled around his torso and he kept his head in the crook of Tony's neck, breathing him in and allowing his lips to curl into the biggest, stupidest grin against him. Steve could still feel him shivering against him. Tony runs his fingers through Steve's hair again like he did earlier, this time more calm, almost as if he was petting him. His breath still uneven and trembling, his lips starting to quiver and nearly crying. He didn't mean to, he was just so
Pepper. So much to the point where he would consider her his soulmate, they've been through so much and anyone around Pepper for more than five minutes would know it's nearly impossible
He'd remember the nights he'd spend in Steve's room, a room which he practically adopted as his own as well. One of his favorite memories being the time Steve had asked to make love to Tony, and the warm feeling that pitted in his stomach that gave him butterflies following the question. Steve, let alone
One night, Tony had lost himself in his thoughts and nothing could distract him from his self-hatred, specifically around the blame of what happened with Steve. He had gotten
how Tony needs to know who was left, who he needed to make it back to, who he was lucky enough to still have. That's all he could possibly care about at the moment. He couldn't possibly think of anything else but who he had left. About Steve. About Bruce, one of his best friends he just learned was still alive. About Rhodey. About Pepper.
Tony groaned, pulling back from Steve and adjusting himself underneath, placing his hands on the taller man's chest. Steve could tell by the look on his face he was eager to say something, but didn't know if he could get the words out.
in between moans and brief participation of attempted kisses along Steve's neck in return. He had never looked more beautiful and natural, Steve had thought to himself. He couldn't remember ever feeling to close to heaven, not even in the sense of passion, no, it was barely even about that anymore. It was about how he knew somewhere in the back of his mind that this is where they could start over, they could forget the past, forget everything and the world if they truly desired. Everything could start now. In this bed, in this room, in this
"Don't you dare blame yourself for that. Everything that happened between us was my fault and you know it."
But no, not today. Definitely another day, he'd make it up to him. But today wasn't that day, today was about showing him his love. "Sorry, honey. I couldn't help myself, you...God, Tony, you're just so pretty. You have such a pretty cock, baby. I know I've told you before, but I'm telling you again, my
. Tony knew why Steve was distancing himself, knowing how Steve's mind worked. Tony hated that he knew he was going to have to be the one to say something; that words would never get spoken if he didn't say anything first.
Despite trying his best to pretend he's moved on and despite the letter from Steve apologizing for everything on his part, including an extensive apology on his biggest mistake; not telling Tony the truth about his parents and having Tony find out the hard way. And of course, Steve just
Tony would often think of moments like those as he passed by every now and then. He's gotten better at dealing with what had happened, and not knowing if Steve felt the same for some reason ruined him.
Tony was quick to get cut off as he felt himself getting lifted. Damn Steve's super-soldier strength and his short, tiny body. Steve sat him up and leaned against the headboard of their bed, signaling for Tony to join him on his lap. Tony didn't complain, he just complied, throwing a leg over Steve and straddled his waist. Steve took Tony's face in his hands, pressing a kiss to his soft, full lips. God, he never ceased to amaze him; even when he wasn't trying. Steve gave him a quick nose kiss before drawing back, catching a small grin from Tony for a second, which made him light up.
Then the aftermath of the accords happened. Emotions ended up getting the best of him, resulting in attacking Barnes. Tony wishes he wouldn't have, he wishes he would've tried to remember no matter what that
"I...Steve?" Tony asked, the blond humming in question, breathing in and out of his nose, noticing the smell of oil that still remained despite the shower, and heard the low sound of the arc reactor humming lightly against Tony's chest. "I love you, honey. I don't think I say it enough, or at least not enough to serve how much I do justice, but it's true." Steve smiled to himself and pressed a soft kiss to the top of Tony's head.
Sure enough, though it took a little over two months, Tony came out of it alive. He'd recovered from the snap nearly completely, still obviously a little out of it, but nothing life-long. It was what could only be considered a true miracle. And even though Steve told himself for months now Tony would be fine, he was still surprised to see Tony come out of this alright, but of course, he could never be more thankful.

anymore unless you took me here or unless we fucked around or something and I fall asleep afterwards. God, I don't know why you choose me. I'm the worst."
, I do. I do believe you, I do, honey. I'm just worried you'll eventually not want me. But Tony, I swear to God, if this-if
Tony suddenly panicked and remained silent, having no idea what to say. He called yet for some reason didn't exactly expect an answer, another thing he wasn't quite sure why. Tony started to feel the familiar feeling of blood slowly draining from his face and rushing to his fingertips and beginning to feel as if they were swollen. Instinctively, he took a deep breath and let it out unevenly and started to choke back on a cry he could feel threatening to escape his throat. He forgot for a moment that Steve was even on the other line.
Tony came out in no less than seven minutes. Steve laid back down nearly exactly how he'd been placed before, shifting a little so it didn't look too unnatural. He shut his eyes as he heard the quiet noise of Tony opening drawers, presumably getting out an old shirt and underwear to come to bed in. He heard Tony sigh, cursing under his breath in self-pity. Tony eventually crept in to the bed, snuggling up against Steve; his leg resting on Steve's hips, arms wrapped around his torso and face resting in his neck, pressing a soft kiss before he felt hot breath creeping up against his neck, which made Steve smile to himself, he couldn't help it. He almost snuggled closer, almost, but didn't want Tony to believe he woke him, so he stayed silent for the moment. Everything was decent, that is until the kisses were followed by the noise of what sounded like soft sobs being choked back.

Tony only realized when Steve took his face in his hands that he was choking back on soft cries and tears were streaming down his face. Steve's instinctive, protective mode kicking in, realizing he was probably hurting Tony. That being the last thing he wanted.

. Tony choked a little, between swallowing moans and trying to speak, eventually getting out a sentence.
. Tony leaned the bottom of his chin on to the top of Steve's head, running his hands all over, eventually settling on holding Steve's neck as his head fell to rest on Steve's shoulder instead. "You know you're all I could think about all that time I was trapped in space?" Tony asked playfully, feeling Steve smiling against his neck. "That whole time. I was so angry with you, not really knowing I was angry with myself. I had that phone, sure, things went south sooner than expected, but I was about to call you, all of this could've been avoided-"
It's a curse that Tony could remember every single detail about every thought pacing through his mind once Steve had him pinned down by the hips and began fighting him, beating him in such

things in their years together. Whispering, praise, dirty talk (or whenever Steve had cursed in general), and though there were some that definitely went deeper than that, Steve knew these were his biggest things. And for some odd reason he couldn't quite pin, he couldn't help but find it absolutely adorable.
And Tony, well, Tony could barely even think. His mind becoming a blank space that knew nothing but pleasure, burning ache, and

give him gesture of a truce with that dumb little flip-phone. Tony still appreciated it, despite how frustrated and bitter he was. The phone specifically tugged at his heart, causing him to carry it on him at all times. He didn't know exactly
"I'm never letting you go either," Tony said, pressing one last kiss before adding- "God, I missed you. You're stuck with me now, your dick is in my ass again, Rogers.
It was all too much for Tony underneath him though, his lips fell slack and couldn't find the energy through the waves of pleasure to kiss Steve back. He just laid there, his arms around Steve clutching at his shoulders, pupils blown, and staring at the ceiling with an unbeknownst look as to what to do painted across his face. Tony having just enough energy at times to whisper out small pleads to
his home. And it would be a lie if Tony said he didn't feel the same, because God, how he had waited

"Tony, honey. You know I love you, right?" he asked, not fully thinking through the question, because he should've seen Tony's follow up question with a sigh coming just seconds later.
Tony angled his hips up to create some friction along his cock, as Steve had abandoned it awhile back accidentally when he lost himself in the moment. Steve's cock sinking into him even further as Tony dropped hints to give him attention between his legs. Steve draws back his now fucked and swollen lips, a string of saliva still disgustingly connecting them together. His pace slows a little inside of Tony, becoming more steady yet still remaining impatient and needy as he takes Tony into his hand and sliding up and down, around the tip, into the slit, tight squeezes up and down his shaft, anything and everything to make Tony groan as he began taking him a little harder again. Tony claws down Steve's back, fingers digging deep in, unable to control himself as he cried out incredibly loud, but as if he even cared more. As if he could even find the mindset to care. All that mattered was Steve.
It's been almost exactly two years since the fall. Two years since Tony lost seemingly everything. Two years of blaming himself for everything that had happened.
Actually, for Tony to blame this all on himself is unfair. But of course, he'll never realize that. For the longest time he's always figured things are just his fault. Every time someone he loved got hurt, every time something went wrong in the slightest, every time someone in the tower or Pepper was upset. And of course, for years now he's of course shifted the blame of the fallout on himself.
Steve helped support Tony leaning back and rubbing him against  his fingers in attempt of calming him down so he became less tense, smiling against his full lips, turning his head to kiss his cheek instead, looking down beneath them to guide his cock to the rim of Tony's hole, briefly looking back up at Tony and gave him a questioning nod. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck before nodding his head furiously, already a moaning mess, not needing to say a word to give Steve orders to

Any feeling of pain slowly disappearing as he couldn't remember it, couldn't remember anything but how good everything felt, between the feelings of both sexual pleasure and how amazing it was to have this amazing man back.

had never done that or asked of it. When he thought about it, no one had ever really even treated sex as
"You okay, honey?" Steve asked, reaching a hand up to play with Tony's hair. Tony snuggled his cheek into the palm of Steve's hand, nodding. "What is it? I know you wanna say something." Tony sighed, looking up to Steve with his big brown eyes and grinning. He hooked his fingers into the hem of Steve's pants, the last article of clothing that remained on his body at this point. He shook his head anyway, the look of "nevermind, it's stupid" expressed across his face, the half-smile giving it away overall. Steve pressed a soft kiss against his lips, coming back up to ask again what was on his mind. The question he found himself asking Tony the most, even if it was practically internal every time. Tony licked his lips, swallowing before he began to part his lips to open his mouth and ask Steve the question hasn't in years.
"Mmm," Cap replied.  "Then you'll just have to deal with it.  Do you want me to re-bandage your side, too?"
As soon as thick plumes of smoke started spurting out from it, Steve pulled open the door, backing himself and Tony up so that they were between the door and the wall and holding his breath as he heard the biters start to stumble in.  God, there were so many—what kind of hellish experiments had Maya and the others been running on them?  Eventually, though, it seemed like there was a gap in the mass of biters squeezing through, and so Steve slipped out of the room with Tony, heart pounding.  Once outside, he paused long enough for Tony to set off another smoke bomb and to throw one of the firecrackers down the far end of the hall, and then he started to slowly edge toward, then down the staircase, clutching Tony against him.  The biters brushed past them, so close that Steve could almost smell their stench, but thankfully the smoke bombs did their jobs, obstructing their sense of smell—both Steve's and the biters'.
So, no visitor.  But things were out of place and maybe it had been Ma who moved things, but he doubted it.  She usually let him keep his privacy. But then that only left, well - himself.
“Tony, then,” Steve says.  “Your lips are blue.  Come here.”  And he wraps his discarded jacket around the other man.
Magic was weird, but Tony would take what he could get.  “See?  There’s a way to fix you.  We just have to do it within a timeframe.  That’s all.”
Oh.  Right.  Okay, so Tony had been hoping that Steve had forgotten about that, because he himself really just had no idea what was going on there.  But he supposed a national war hero who went by the name of Captain America
Tony frowns, looking back at his own wrist, and tries to fathom how a Thomas Paine quote could possibly lead him anywhere.
Steve sighs, as though having an incredibly gorgeous man on top of him demanding to be touched is something to be exasperated about.  “Come here, then.”  He reaches up, making quick work of the buttons on his shirt—for a moment, he’s tempted to just tear the thing off, but that would probably mean having to pick up all the stray buttons once they’re done and he doesn’t really want to do that—then pushes it off, swallowing as he exposes Tony’s body again.  And though he’s
"Okay," Tony said, taking hold of Steve's wrist and trying to tug him away.  "We don't have to go that way."
Of course, they never do grab lunch.  It’s much easier, Tony finds, to ignore the way Steve makes his chest constrict when they’re separated by over two thousand miles of land.
"Steve, Tony," Jessica said, glancing back sideways at them, "start getting supplies.  I'll join you in… in a little bit."
him?  It’s the strangest thing he’s ever felt.  When was the last time he was hugged?  He can’t even remember.  Swallowing, he finds himself melting into his arms.  He’s warm, so warm.
Steve looked down.  He wasn't sure this was a conversation he wanted to have, so he changed the topic.  "Do you think the woman is alone?"
Deep down, Tony knew it couldn't last.  In time, Steve would tire of him, and then maybe he'd be the one trying to live a life of naps and all-nighters so that he wouldn't have to see Tony anymore.  After all, there had to be a reason that up until now, Tony only had Ty as an actual friend.
Oh.  Well, wasn’t that something?  No wonder everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. was so fond of him.  But he was still annoying!  “Thanks,” he said anyway, because it seemed like the sort of thing he should be thankful for.  He weakly pushed himself up onto one elbow then, looking Rogers over.  He looked a bit battered, but otherwise okay.  “Is there anything I can help you with?”
Rogers let out what sounded like a very put-upon sigh, sitting down next to his shield and looking at Tony expectantly.
"Steve!" came a voice from behind him, and Tony nearly jumped, not expecting to be addressed.  Again his instincts told him to just start running, but rationally he knew that he wasn't going to be making it out of an army encampment if he was being chased.  Instead, he made himself turn around, peering at the speaker. He looked - young. Not young enough to be called a kid, but definitely younger than all the other men here.  Some sort of page, maybe?
with him. And it was the most amazing, intimate feeling he had ever felt in a relationship. He remembered falling asleep in Steve's arms slowly after he promised him he just wanted to close his eyes for a few moments, and waking up to the feeling of emptiness, only for relief of the brief panic to come just moments later when he looked up to see Steve sitting at the edge of the bed, a single bedside lamp lighting up the room as he noticed a pencil in one hand, and Steve's sketchbook in the other. From the tiniest glimpse he caught of the paper, Tony could tell Steve was drinking in the moment, sketching down what Tony had looked like on their bed. When Steve looked up and met his eyes with Tony's, he could see Steve's face flush with embarrassment.
Steve shushed him with a shake of his head in disapproval and a quick nip at his ear. "It's okay, you don't have to blame yourself, Tony. You defeated him, he's gone.
"Listen. Tony. We did the absolute best we could in the moment, okay? All of us. You always do so good, sweetheart. You are the best, and don't forget it for one second." Steve tells him, gently rubbing his thumb across Tony's cheek. "And no matter what happens, Tony, nothing will ever change how I feel about you. You know why?" Steve asked in a soft, gentle voice, slowly guiding his hands around Tony. Tony just shook his head, both in question and immediate disagreement as to whatever he was going to say next. Steve shook his head in disapproval before he kissed him slowly, pulling Tony closer by the hips. "Because, honey. I. Love. You. And I always will. Nothing will ever change that." he answered between the soft kisses he trailed down his mouth, to his jaw, under his chin and on his neck. "I always will, baby. No matter what. Nothing will ever, ever change about how I feel about you. No one ever comes close to you. You amaze me, Tony."
Tony took a deep breath and felt his whole face heat as it beamed with happiness. "I missed the fuck outta you too, Rogers." he chuckled to himself.
"Can't you feel that, honey? You're so tight around me, two's enough for now and you know it. We gotta work you a little more loose so I can get inside you. That's what you want, right?" Tony whined, eager and arching his back a little more, but he couldn't complain. He knew Steve was right, and he was mentally cursing himself for not prepping earlier. Don't get him wrong of course, though. He
he groaned, letting himself fall onto Tony, pressing their chests together, hips still raised a little with where his hand was, still fucking Tony's cock beneath them. His lips moved down from Tony's, beginning to kiss him anywhere and everywhere. Absolutely
"Easy, honey. Easy there..." Steve exhaled, breathing against Tony's neck as he slid back into Tony again slowly, filling him right up, kissing him again, letting out tasteful moans and low noises that Tony could've swore he's never heard before. Tony nearly screamed when Steve accidentally jerked up his hips a little too soon, so close and deep inside him he could feel his pubic bone pressed against his perineum. Steve began crying at how good Tony felt around him, couldn't get it out of his head that this was real and Tony was choosing him. He pulled back before beginning to slowly rocking back and forth inside of him.
There was a brief silence between the two as Tony rested his head upon Steve's chest, reaching down to hold his hand and intertwine their fingers. Steve was his home, and kept him right.
. The way it stands against your stomach, the little curve and the one vein that leads straight up to the tip, baby, you're so
Steve. He needed to hear his voice, his beautiful voice that he would remember hearing every time he awoke from a nightmare, the same one that whispered to him as he trailed kisses along his neck, assuring him
Steve could've sworn his heart stopped beating. Sure, this whole thing of Tony withering underneath him begging to be fucked was nothing
The Avengers from tearing apart. Admittedly that meant doing things he hated and making terrible impulse decisions, but he tried. He knows now it wasn't the best he could've done, but he did the things he did and he hated himself for it. There was no going back now, and how he wishes there was. He got so caught up in everything that was moving too fast, too chaotic, too quickly. It all started with the burdened guilt of coming to know a certain victim of the attack on Sokovia, then of course the accords happened, then the bombing of the UN which drew Steve back to Barnes and things only spiraled down from there- God, it was all just
Surprising Steve, instead of his words resulting in immediate disagreement, Tony just slowly nodded, taking his words. Steve could tell he didn't believe him, but he also knew he probably never would. Just how he would never forgive himself about what he had said to Tony when he knew so little about him, back just before the battle of New York. Steve moved his hands to Tony's hair, tugging lightly and pulling him closer by his head to meet his lips and share a long, passionate kiss. Tony apologized for reasons totally unknown, but Steve ticked at him between kisses, laying them back down on the bed, covering them up as he snuggled in tight to Tony.
Steve couldn't help but laugh to himself, curling his fingers inside of Tony, stretching him wider as he sat up, fingers moving out of his ass just a little, thrusting them back in fairly quickly and angling them just right to hit his prostate, earning a sharp yelp from Tony below him, as he completely pulled out his fingers, quickly stripping himself of his boxers, Tony only being able to hear the sounds of Steve fumbling around with the bottle of lube and the low, relieved groans that Steve exhaled as he gently took Tony and placed him back on his back, spreading his thighs apart for him and leaning down for a kiss. He loved to have him on his back like this, loved to watch him fall apart, all of it. Tony gasped, Steve swallowing every noise and other moans he let out, his heartbeat quickening as his cock twitched with interest against Tony's thigh, the soft noise he let out insinuating he felt it which made Steve blush, a small wave of embarrassment taking over.
. The memory of what happened still haunting him; feeling as if his desperate attempt to keep him alive was just a long shot, telling himself he knew pulling Tony's suit off of him wouldn't do anything; yet somehow, miraculously, it worked.
Eventually Tony gave a long, broken moan, knowing Steve was fully inside of him. Steve dropped Tony's leg from his shoulder and responded by taking Tony into his arms again and holding him close, peppering kisses across his shoulder, down his chest, his collarbone, anywhere he could reach. Finally stopping back up at a small place between his neck and collar, working on a bruise. The kind that he knew wouldn't go away for quite the while, the kind that he knew Tony loved to show off, deciding long ago that was one of his cutest characteristics. Sure, it could be the possessive side of himself talking, but he didn't even
Tony stared at that screen for at least ten minutes, battling with himself and his own drunken thoughts, until he finally pressed that tiny little 'select' button. He felt so relieved yet so nervous at the same time, it was just getting so hard and he
Steve felt the presence of another person walking up to him. It was Bruce. He assured Steve he was in obvious critical condition, if they weren't careful enough he wouldn't live. Both silently agreeing he'd be fine, that Tony was truly an iron man, he'd get out of this alive. He'd see his daughter again, he'd see Rhodey again, he'd see Peter again, and Pepper, and Steve...all of them. He would be okay, Steve told himself he would.
"I don't deserve you, Steve." Tony finally breathed out, nuzzling his face gently closer. Steve could only assume that Tony thought he was still asleep. "Coming to bed at four in the fucking morning while you wait for me, God, you deserve better. I'm practically never even
. Clint, Wanda, Sam, and some other person named Scott he hadn't gotten to know were locked up, treated as prisoners. He was left with terrible guilt of bringing Peter into this chaotic world (yet another impulsive decision he blames himself for). And he and Steve had parted ways. Steve,
the feeling of Steve taking care of him, working him open on the inside, placing kisses to his back and nips on the ear, but he couldn't wait for Steve to get inside of him. To
"I'll give you what you want baby. What do you need, Tony?" Steve asked in the most gentle voice, adjusting himself so he could press a kiss to the back of Tony's neck, resting his head there on the top of his back as he still thrusted his fingers deep inside of him. Tony groaned below him, jerking a little as he whined again with a frustrated moan. "Steve, baby. More,
" Steve murmured in a sarcastic, playful manner against his neck, causing Tony to let out a small laugh, lifting his head up to meet Steve's eyes. Tony took his face in his hands, kissing him deeper than before. The whole shebang of subconsciously lifting his shoulders and raising his hips up off of Steve's lap, it was so cheesy and he somehow knew it; causing Tony to laugh to himself at the thought, but quickly trying to dismiss it, and Steve didn't question it either, just slowly guided them backward onto the bed. It wasn't necessarily of importance, all that mattered was this exact moment right here, and neither of them ever wanted it to end. Even back before everything happened and the two were together for the first time, it had somehow never felt this safe or important, let alone even this
He did truly try to keep Steve off his mind. Especially when he came back to Pepper in hopes to rekindle their relationship. Admittedly, whether he even really knew it or not, it was truly to forget about Steve, but he also just wanted to be happy again, and he figured being with Pepper could give him that. Because don't get him wrong, he
Steve slowly turned, acting as if he had just woken up, startling Tony. He sighed, blindly taking Tony in his arms and snuggling him close.
between them, and the feeling was mutual. Hell, this whole "fresh start" thing was really taking its toll, not that either of them would complain though.
He slipped the phone out of his back pocket and opened it, going to the one contact he had saved and just stared at the screen.
Tony looked away, only for Steve to hook a finger under his chin and gently turn his head back. Steve smiled.
done more. He had the chance to defeat Thanos, but he just wasn't enough. And he even got mocked for it.
Tony remembers laying there after the fact, thinking back in time about a year prior to that very moment to a much simpler time. The atmosphere was welcoming, he was lying there in his bed with Steve by his side. Something about that specific night was special, he still couldn't wrap his finger around why. But Steve was warm, inviting, and the most gorgeous Tony had ever seen him. Steve, and that dumb, precious afterglow smile that was spread across his face. Steve's fingers were running through Tony's hair. The two were cuddled up together, both unwilling to let go of each other. He remembered in that moment some oddly convenient choice of words that he had whispered into the air, but were meant for Steve's ears. They were almost chilling to think about now.
he felt inside of him. He didn't even have to say it, but Steve knew that before him it was likely no one had ever treated Tony like this- with care, assurance her was safe, with overall treating this
God.  He was incorrigible sometimes—all the time, really.  Despite his anger, though, he didn't actually want Stark facing the biters alone, so he took a deep breath and followed in after him before turning away so that he wouldn't have to see Stark killing them all.  For his part, he handled the biters in his own way—striking them in the legs, crippling them and making it harder for them to move around.  As long as he didn't put his feet somewhere stupid, it would be okay.
And though Tony likes the sentiment, this isn’t enough for him, so he stops, tugging on Steve’s arm to get him to stop as well.  “Here,” he says, gritting his teeth as he pulls the lifebelt off of him, putting it over Steve’s head instead.  “This is the least I can do.  And don’t fight with me.  If you take that off I swear I’m going to run back downstairs.”

After coming down from an anxious, guilt-ridden high, his mind shifted focus to what he should be doing next. What to do, where to go, who to see. Specifically wondering what was happening on Earth, the mental images scaring him. All the chaos probably going on, all the loss, the confusion, the anger, innocent people dying, everyone losing loved ones without having any idea of what has happened. That's when it hit him-
at this point. Watching Tony crane his neck further, letting him in as he let out relentless gasps was single-handedly one of the hottest thing Steve had ever seen in his
only to feel everything beginning to make sense again the second he and Steve began working together.
, because despite what the phone was for, he knew he would probably never call Steve for help. He wasn't even sure if he was waiting for himself or Steve to make the move of calling.
Tony just grinned, a bright smile breaking through his quivering lip, grabbing Steve's face and kissing him softly. He was just so thrilled and emotional to know that he had Steve back,
." he whimpered, choking on his own breath as he let out a desperate noise that disguised itself as a sob. He swallowed the saliva arising in his throat again, wanting to speak to Steve again, but louder this time. He didn't want to cower away, he could take him.
" Tony felt himself on the verge of tears. "Then, what happened, when-when you saved me, s-something inside me kicked some sense into my self. That was the day I knew I never wanted to lose you. That I couldn't lose you, not again. Not after everything we've been through.
"Listen, sugar, I really missed you too, but you've had to have told me this at least three times by now." Steve scoffed and let out a breathless laugh, giving Tony a playful push on his shoulder, leaning down and giving him another soft kiss on the ear, trailing down towards his neck. He would never stop with the neck, because if there's anything he's learned about Tony, it's that his neck was his biggest weak spot. "Oh yeah, I really missed
"I love you." He whispers as their noses rub together, feeling himself start to rush in, fucking him harder, losing himself in his head where nothing else mattered. The feeling of sweat finally starting to really sink in with him; it rolled down his back, his forehead, down his arms and making their skin slick and shimmer on Tony as the sun through the peak of the window hit him
he truly wanted. Tony intertwined his fingers with Steve's, burying his head in Steve's chest. Steve knew he couldn't stop him, he just let him, staring upward wondering what he had gotten himself into.
Tony, that damn man, Steve had never wanted to kiss him (let alone, anyone) so breathless, yet scold him for how stupid he is all at once, both of them knowing he didn't mean it, so much. Keeping his distance, even if it was just about ten feet away and from behind a window, was extremely difficult. He's held back for the past five years, and nearly lost him for good. In fact, if it weren't for Steve, Tony would most likely be dead right
but it's been so long, and they've both been through so much, and he was certain in his mind before this that the moments like these that he loved would never happen again. Though Steve would never admit to it, he was absolutely positive he'd never see Tony like this again; coming undone, holding him close as he begged for Steve to take him, cursing repeatedly under his breath whispering in his ear how
Tony, however, was not having it. At first, he didn't understand. Though it was a real blur, he remembered the soft whispers spoken to him as Steve cradled him on the battlefield post-snap. He'd never felt more content and forgiving in his entire life. After trying to tell himself for the past seven years that he never needed to see Steve again, let alone speak to him, and realizing what they had and remembering how Steve made him feel during their time at the compound together before the time jumps, he realized he needed that for the rest of his life. He needed Steve the rest of his life. He remembered thinking how on the battlefield, how Steve held him and called him by the nickname he hadn't heard in
Now, here Tony sits on an abandoned planet with no one except a practical stranger. Left with nothing but the guilt feeling, blaming himself because he feels as though he should've done more,
"Oh, sweetie. It's okay, I got you, never letting you go." Steve cooed, his hands sliding down to Tony's thighs, slowly spreading them apart and helped Tony up to get on his elbows and knees. Steve asking him for permission once more before slicking up two fingers, holding Tony's ass apart with one hand, the other guiding one finger to his rim, slowly pushing in. Tony sucked in a breath before Steve got closer behind him, whispering soft promises he was okay and moving the one hand away from his rear, the other moving to hold Tony's chest for support. Not even ten seconds in of Steve's first finger pressed all the way in, Tony was begging for more.
Tony never heard the rest of Steve's question. And he wasn't sure if he even wanted to. Tony slammed the phone shut, hanging it up, and chucked it across the room, hitting a wall, causing a crack that still remains there lying across the screen. As soon as he realized what he had done, he started to hate himself even more, eventually surrendering to emotions as he sat there, uncontrollably sobbing all balled up with his arms wrapped tight around his knees. Nearly choking as he repeated
"We destroyed a city. People died. We unintentionally killed so many people while we were out there, kicking ass." the last few words filled with a vile, sarcastic, hatred-filled tone. "Steve, we saved the world, but so many people suffered.
on Steve's face as he slammed his shield right down into the arc reactor, nearly killing Tony. And if he tries really hard, he can still remember the quick shift of emotion painted across Steve's face not seconds later; realization, panic, and disappoint in himself wrapped up into one hard-to-make-out look.
. Before Siberia, in between the accords situation, they both remembered as the last time. Tony could feel an all-familiar smile curl against his lips, just before Steve dropped his head against his shoulder, giving one final kiss to his neck before resting his head there.
"But I do. I really mean it, Rogers, I love you. I never stopped, I was wrong for pushing you away-"
"That's a shameful secret for another day. Just...please, Steve, I'm begging you, please believe me," Tony pleaded softly, slowly wrapping his arms around Steve's waist. "Please, Steve. I tried to tell myself for years you and I were better off broken up and that you were better off without me. That I could try and forget you, eventually I'd get you out of my head, that I'd try and go back to the only other person I know who could fill the gap, maybe, but only to find it turns out she couldn't. I love Pepper more than life itself, but she couldn't fill that gap, Steve. The woman can do anything, but not that, but only because she
Steve loved Tony, to put it simple. After everything that happened between them, especially with the accords and Siberia, Steve had more than enough time to think. He's known what he's wanted in his life since. That being Tony. He's been trying since to accept that Tony would never want him again. If he ever thought or considered after Siberia that maybe Tony would come back, everything that happened with their initial reunion after the decimation turned him on his head. Tony yelling at him, blaming him for being the reason they lost. That he would never trust him again, how he broke his promise, spitting words like venom at him even calling him a liar. And Steve couldn't blame him, not just that he understood that Tony wasn't in his right mind, but he had hated and also blamed himself for everything that had happened. Blamed himself for promising Tony he would always be there then not being able to help him home, for Siberia, for choosing someone else over him, for not telling him about his parents, for some of things he said and how he originally blamed Tony for the fallout of the Avengers, God, simply
Tony complied, mouth coming up to Steve’s pecs and his eyes wide and fixed on them. “Be a good soldier and show Captain America how much you appreciate my service.”
Tony whimpered, the sound ringing in Steve’s ears like music. “You like that, sweetheart?” Steve lifted his clean hand to cup Tony’s cheek. His thumb stroked gently before pushing into the corner of Tony’s mouth and without any more prompting, Tony turned towards Steve’s thumb and took it into his mouth to suck earnestly.
Tony reasoned that it would be acceptable to leave the cowl in the bedroom; it would definitely not be missed that way. He did not want this situation to be stretched out any more than it needed to be. He stepped inside the room and dropped the cowl down onto the bed. Tony stopped again.
“Sit, um…” Tony spoke softly. Steve sat on the edge of the bed and, when Tony did not continue, raised one palm up for Tony to grasp.
Steve snorted at that, looking over at Tony’s sticky body. “Out of the two of us, I think you’re the one who needs the shower.”
“Please do not ask me about any more sexual acts.” Natasha spoke solemnly, as if willing herself to be calm in the face of adversity.
Natasha shrugged, a quiet grin still on her face. Steve liked seeing her happy. “Alright. Well, Clint and I are meeting in the gym soon.” She stood from her seat, still eyeing Steve. “Do you want to come?”
When Steve leaned back again, Tony inhaled sharply as he watched Steve lick his lips clean of the semen that had been on Tony’s cheek. “Come on, now, sweetheart.”
They sat in relative silence while Tony ate, alternating between delicious spoonfuls and prescribed sips. When Tony next spoke, it nearly startled Steve. “Why’d you…” he began, looking at the spot on the table in front of Steve. There was another pause, and then he decided on his words. “Why’d you choose me?”
The first push of his finger had Tony gasping. “Is this what you wanted, Stark? Hmm?” Steve stepped closer to reach his free hand into Tony’s hair. He pumped his finger slowly, in small circles pushing against the muscles of Tony’s hole.
“Roll over.” Steve ordered. Tony was quick to comply, though a fleeting thought of Steve’s spunk leaking out of his hole ran through his mind. But Steve’s built chest, smooth skin, and pink cheeks were an excellent distraction.
“Enjoying the view?” Steve teased, climbing onto the bed but not pulling up the sheets over his body. Tony licked his lips.
“Hi,” Steve said lamely, the stiff silence between them broken abruptly. Tony stopped as he arrived by the dining table and shifted his weight from one foot to the other, looking around the room as if Steve hadn’t said anything at all.
With one more thrust, Steve felt himself coming. The pressure in his balls, the needy heat in his cock was exploding with a shock as he spilled his load into Tony’s mouth, down his throat, which convulsed around him, swallowing until Steve was clean.
He needed. Needed anything Steve would give him. No. He needed Steve to stop playing with Tony’s hole and fill it up with his cock. He needed to be fucked within an inch of his life, with bruises on his hips and bite marks on his neck. He wanted Steve to have him rough, to mark him up, to pinch his nipples until he screamed, to pull his hair until he came on the sheets with Steve’s cock splitting him open. God, his cock was huge. Tony wondered how it would even fit.
“And that just outweighs what I did to him?” Steve’s stomach was churning. Clint shrugged, returning to his feast.
It was early evening and Steve watched sullenly as Clint worked his way through the Tony leftovers buffet that Steve had only 10 minutes ago declared available for anyone (even Clint).
Once Steve removed and folded his clothes and set them aside, he turned to see Tony watching him intently. “Hands on the tiles.” Steve grabbed Tony’s shoulders again, spinning and maneuvering him until he was positioned how Steve wanted him to be-- hands supporting Tony as he bent forward, shoulders under the majority of the water, trickling down his back and buttocks, where Steve could have easy access to do as he pleased.
“Good evening, Tony.” He said softly, looking into Tony’s eyes with an expression so gentle Tony had to look away.
“Tell me, sweetheart, tell me what you want me to do to you.” Steve’s voice was low, steady. “Look at me.” Tony’s eyes were closed, but he could feel Steve’s stare. As he opened his eyes, he saw the hair previously combed neatly has fallen from its uniform pull to the side and now sways in the gentle push of the air conditioning. “Good boy.” Tony let out a little moan, much to Steve’s satisfaction.
“Excuse me, don’t think that just because I’m shorter than you automatically makes me the little spoon here. I could challenge stereotypes! Overcome the ideas of what a subby dude is ‘supposed’ to want or like, and—fuck, yeah I’m a little spoon.” Tony turned over on his side, back facing Steve. He looked over his shoulder expectantly.
The Avengers were called just a few hours after Steve departed from Tony’s penthouse. Steve’s mind was still spinning from the events that unfolded, but he managed to put his thoughts aside as he was briefed on the latest crisis that they were facing.
Tony managed to drag himself off of his bed and into some clothes decent enough to transport himself a few floors down to the captain’s level. He grabbed the cowl from the coffee table on the way to the elevator.
Defeated, Steve debated going back to his floor. He wanted to give Tony space, and to not take advantage of their arrangement. Their arrangement… Well, Tony had paid for company until 9:00am. He could wait until morning.
“Lube in here?” Steve asked, but received no response more complicated than a soft grunt of agreement. He opened the nightstand drawer he had been referring to and pulled out two small bottles of flavoured lubricant. Strawberry and pineapple. He held them out for Tony’s selection.
couldn’t focus. He opened his eyes, and saw Steve staring down at him, waiting. Expecting Tony to answer. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry—I can’t—”
But he has Steve now.  And despite getting shot and slowly turning into an icicle, he doesn’t regret it one bit.
"Easy peasy," read a note scrawled in one corner of his trigonometry worksheet in the same unfamiliar handwriting.  Steve didn't know what a "peasy" was supposed to be, but he doubted it was all that easy, and in fact suspected that the writer of the strange phrase had chosen "peasy" simply because it looked like it rhymed with "easy".  He ended up having to try and figure out as much of the homework as he could on his own so that he could actually
He casts a wide net.  Once he’s in college, he starts sleeping around with anyone who might be associated with Thomas Paine in any way.  History students, because Paine was a historical figure.  Military personnel, because Paine was a patriot.  Political activists, because Paine was one himself.
Collectively, the four of them froze for a second, then turned to the door.  It now stood open, Fury standing in the doorway looking unfairly majestic.
Packing was a quick affair - Steve didn't have much in the way of personal items, and though Tony looked, he found no trace of the journal he and Steve had exchanged so many messages in nearly half a decade ago.
Since they didn't exactly have anything else to go on, Steve figured they might as well, so they followed the footsteps outside until they disappeared somewhere along the main road, and Steve looked ahead to realize just where they were.  "Oh," he said faintly.
Ma reached out, and Steve unclenched his hand so he could take hers - she always ran cold, just like him, but today she was even colder.  He tried not to think about it. "But nothing. The young man I raised doesn't run away. Do you remember why?"
Tony groaned, lashes fluttering as he blearily opened his eyes.  It was dark… still nighttime, then.  No need to wake up.  He rolled over, letting his eyes close again.  “Too early.”
have been thinking about how annoying you were.  So, assuming that this is some kind of wishing stone, maybe it was kind enough to grant two of my wishes and turned you into a less annoying form.”  After all, Rogers couldn’t talk anymore, even if he was now a hundred times more terrifying—he growled dangerously in response, and Tony quickly held up his hands.  “Hey, I never actually
It was in that instant when the airship, which had been doing so well up until now, finally decided it was time to start failing.
Tony wasn't very sure what happened in the next few minutes.  He was dimly aware of Jarvis shouting for Pepper, asking her to take over something.  Flying the airship, maybe.  But she didn't know how to fly it?
Steve closes his eyes for a moment, just focusing on Tony’s touches, trying to keep his body from moving too much.  “I-I’m not hiding and I’m not perfect,” he says.  “A-and—and what, do you expect me to walk around naked?”
Tony grins, and before Steve knows it, the other man is straddling his lap, leaving him breathless.  “It’s not my car.”
Damn it.  Someone flying over them right now, here in an archaeological site in central China, was almost certainly an enemy and a bad sign.  "We have to get out of here."
“Oh, yeah.”  Tony grins again, finding a staircase and taking them down.  “That, too.  But mostly because I left the drawing for them to find.”
The word wasn't familiar to Steve.  It sounded Slavic—Polish, maybe?  But the woman had no accent.  Despite his confusion, he got up, although he didn't put his shield away.  If this bothered thewoman, she said nothing about it, instead pointing at two more spots on the ground.  "Mind yourselves there and there," she called to them.  "Unless you don't mind losing your heads."
"Ms. Potts damaged them when she took control of the airship," Cap said.  His brow furrowed a little.  "You know she's a war correspondent on the Pacific front?"
Steve purses his lips, and it’s clear that he’s not happy with this.  He needs to learn how to be more selfish, really.  After a moment, though, he does decide to comply, appraising the raft before gingerly crawling on as Tony watches with bated breath.  Truth be told, he’s never built anything like this before, and he’s not actually sure how well it’ll float with just Steve, much less the both of them, especially when this thing was clobbered together on an incredibly tight deadline.  Still, he’s Tony goddamn Stark, and he knows what he’s doing.
His response seemed inexplicably bloodthirsty, and so Steve set the dried eggs down, glaring at the back of Stark's head as he felt a familiar anger swell within him.  "So you haven't changed," he snapped. "I thought that maybe—"
Ty stared at the donut, looking as though he wanted to say something, but then thought better of it.  "Really?" he said instead. "Damn it. I knew I could have done better."
Steve tried to sit up, but when he straightened his arm to brace himself, it buckled, and he fell back down.  His vision felt blurry.  "What do we do now?"
Finally, with the room a complete mess - and boy, was he not looking forward to cleaning it up before he went to bed - Tony threw open the door to his tiny closet, peering inside.  Nothing looked unusual. On a hunch, though, he pushed open the trench coat hanging off one coat hanger - and that was when he saw it, the smallest service uniform he'd ever laid eyes on.
be there.  He killed Steve, and it’s—it’s sick and wrong to run away from that.  He should remember.  He
The shirt came off.  Instinctively, Tony reached up, trying to cover the metal plating over his heart, but Rogers moved his hand away.  Though it was dark save for the flashlight, Tony could see Rogers’ eyes landing on the plate, seeming to contemplate it for a second before his gaze drifted away.  To his credit, he didn’t say anything, instead starting to wipe the gouges clean.  “Ow,” Tony said.
The conversation ended after that, and Steve turned his attention outside, watching the world pass them by and eating when he got hungry.  Tony got up after some point to fiddle more with the controls, making adjustments as necessary, and for a little while, Steve could pretend the world was okay.
They both fell silent.  Steve was still holding Tony's hands, but the other man didn't seem to mind, so Steve didn't let go.  It had been a long, long time since he'd done this with him, and… it was nice.  Soothing.  He could hear the ticking of the reactor powering Tony's heart slowly relax.
"Philanthropists are great people and they better the world," Steve said heatedly.  "And just because you don't think the ones in need deserve it, doesn't mean you're right."
“Good heavens,” Tony says, feigning offense as he places a hand over his heart.  “How could you say such a thing?”  His mind quickly goes over the evidence.  Steve draws nudes.  Male nudes.  They’d clicked earlier.  And he didn’t seem particularly offended when Tony had mentioned Tiberius.  Yes, he thinks.  This is going to be a perfectly appropriate reply—”After all, I haven’t slept with
The man sighs, and Tony looks again to see him taking off his boots.  “You seem pretty sure of that,” he says.  “But alright.  If I can’t stop you, then I’m gonna go in after you.”
Tony nodded, and he shivered as he felt the presence of the wire so close to his heart.  The gauntlet started to whine as it charged up, and together, the three of them looked to the sky as the fighter came back into view.  "Firing!" he shouted, and let out a repulsor blast.
For a moment, there was no answer.  Tony wondered what the pause was for.  He wondered if Steve was gathering his thoughts, staring into the distance with those blue, blue eyes of his.  Tony hadn't seen those eyes in a long time.
"That's not something I want to be part of, Maya," he said softly as he carefully took a few steps back in return.  "Please.  Just escape while you still can."
Dougie hadn't picked a fight with him yesterday because the… Steve who wasn't actually Steve had threatened him.  (
"Yeah," Tony said.  He coughed and cleared his throat.  "I mean.  This thing that Fury has us looking for now—I'm assuming it's a special case, if knowledge about it reached him.  But just because Fury doesn't want the Nazis getting this in particular doesn't mean that we should be letting them get any of the other stuff, either."
Rogers whined and dug his claws into the ground again, trying to gain some leverage.  It was hard for Tony to see Rogers’ lower half, but he could hear his legs scrambling for purchase against the vertical wall.
Jarvis rolled his shoulders.  "Your archeologist friend evacuated because of the Japanese, and we're looking for something the Nazis are also hunting."
Tony thought about it.  He was still hurting, but he felt slightly cleaner, and Rogers’ hands had helped soothe him a little.  “Better,” he admitted.  He hesitated a moment, then added, “But I think my ribs are fractured.”
“You sure?” Steve asks.  Tony fights the urge to glance back at him.  Seriously, those eyes of his—God.  He could get lost in them.
A flash of movement caught his eye, and he whirled to the right, his shield coming out—but it turned out to just be a rat, and he forced himself to relax, shaking his head.  Maybe it was just a damned rat this whole time.  Maybe there was no one up here, much less Natasha's James.
Tony makes a quiet sound in the back of his throat, pressing closer to Steve’s hand as he shivers violently.  “Me, too.”  He wants eternity with Steve.  These last two days have been the happiest of his life, but it’s not enough.  It’ll never be enough.  “M-maybe… o-once we get to land… I’ll t-t-take us to California.  I hear it’s w-warm there.”
Cap reached out, and—and he was holding Tony's hand again.  "There's a future," he said.  "After we find Ms. Potts and Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Jarvis.  And after we find the final piece.  There's gonna be a future."
"That's what I've been wondering about, honestly," Tony said.  "So this James of hers goes off somewhere, and she wants us to find out what happened to him.  Maybe he's a biter now.  Maybe he just ran off.  How the hell are we supposed to know?  He doesn't have to be at the Navy Yard.  He could be literally anywhere."
They put away their trays, got Tony's backpack from his room since Ty already had his (Steve realized then that Tony actually had his own private room, though Ty seemed to have been granted free access to it), and then headed off in their separate directions.  It took a little - well, a lot - of fumbling to figure out where exactly he was supposed to go, but aside from that the day seemed to unfold okay. He even felt like he acted passably normal around Ty when they had lunch that afternoon, though Ty had still cast a doubtful glance at the massive plate of food he'd gotten himself.  And sure, he had no idea what was going on in any of his classes, but hopefully the notes he'd taken would be good enough for Tony. They were a lot more helpful than the doodles of flying machines that littered Tony's notebooks, in any case.
Tony blinked and shook his head, his shovel out as he continued on.  "It's nothing.  I just… was thinking, I guess.  I never had any dog tags."
There was a long pause as the woman watched the two of them start eating.  Then she smiled.  "What can you tell me about the Tveria weapon?" she said.
"Okay," Cap replied.  "And do you think he was responsible for what happened at Yinxu?  With the planes?"
Still, he’s never been one to just give up.  At the very least… he should see.  Make sure.  “Hello, Steve.”
"I mean," Yinsen said, "that it seems as though you have only thought of what will happen to you after you die, and not of what you will do before then."
"Sure," Cap said, but Tony could tell that Cap still didn't think his behavior was particularly worthy of praise.
Tony nodded absently, going quiet for a few moments.  Then: "I don't know how you're still alive," he said finally.  "But you are.  And… I noticed something.  The mark on your finger.  From… from that ring.  It's gone.  Did you get rid of it?"
Still, all of that was secondary to what Tony feared was happening.  If the Nazis had found them here, they'd probably found the airship, which Jarvis was currently occupying.  And while Jarvis was a tough old bird, he wasn't superhuman.  If he had to face off against several Nazis on his own…
The sound he'd made, muffled as it was, nonetheless ended up being enough to rouse Tony, who jolted awake and turned to him with wide eyes.  "Oh, thank God," he breathed, standing up before one leg apparently gave way.  Steve's own eyes went wide, but his reflexes felt sluggish, and all he could do was watch helplessly as Tony tumbled to the ground.  A moment later, though, Tony pushed himself back up, shaking his head.  "Sorry.  I'm fine.  Let me get this off you."  He carefully peeled off the tape over Steve's mouth, then fished out the ball of gauze that had been stuffed in there.  Afterward, he limped off, returning with a glass of water and holding it up to Steve's lips.  "How're you feeling?"
But now there’s no more time.  The other man is too far off, slipping away with every passing second, and Tony is helpless, unable to do anything but stare up into those blue eyes he’s come to know and love.  Steve—Steve can’t know how beautiful he looks right now, blond hair falling into his face as a flare lights him up from behind, framing those perfect features.  He must be scared.  Tony
Still, he'd turned around, lifting his head and meeting his gaze.  "Nothing, sir," he'd managed stiffly.
"None other," Stark replied, spreading his hands out wide and giving him a broad grin—even if it didn't quite reach his eyes.  "Welcome back to the land of the living—"  He paused, looking thoughtful for a moment, and then continued as though it were an afterthought: "—And the dead."
.”  Tony reached up, undoing the top few buttons of his shirt to reveal his chest, gauze covering the scratches from the first sabretooth fight, but otherwise missing the metal plate and charge percentage and everything else.  It was like Wong-Chu never happened, which was, honestly, quite surprising because he was completely expecting to die, or at least have that first bit of magic be undone up in that igloo-thing on the mountain.  “There’s probably a moral in here somewhere.  Save a life, have your own life saved for free?  You know, that’s a great marketing tactic.  Someone should try that.  People like free things.”
Steve set the sketchbook back down, feeling an odd mix of unsettledness and disappointment.  Something was definitely off - he still remembered the strange things he'd seen at school, plus whatever Ma had been alluding to - but he couldn't actually find anything more about it.  Unsure of what to do next, he went over to lay down on the bed, sighing softly as he rolled into the indentation his body had worn into the mattress over the years.
.  The war had ended, going by what Stark had said earlier, and Steve had been lying in the Atlantic like a damned idiot.  "Okay," he said after he'd composed himself as much as he could.  This was already a lot to dwell on, but there was still more to learn, and Steve had a sinking feeling he hadn't heard the worst of it yet.  "So… what was the plan, then?  The war ended, and you wanted to bury me in Arlington?"
Tony squeezed his eyes back shut, hoping he hadn't been caught still awake.  Even though this was just a dream - a long, strange dream - he was still scared of what might happen if he were found to be pretending to be the blond-haired boy he'd seen in the mirror.  The man's tiredness could so easily give way to something worse. He'd seen it enough in his own father, and here, he had no dog to curl up against for comfort.
Steve frowns down at it, but he’s smiling a little by the time he looks at Tony again, leaning forward to press his lips against his nose.  “Fine,” he says.  “Let’s go.”
So Steve moved the highlighter down to the row that said VOICELOGS, then hit enter and watched as the rows were replaced with what looked like dates, with the most recent on top, but… that couldn't be right.
The pistols lowered.  "You wasted one of my traps and now the smell of blood is in the air.  Get inside before you bring the
Steve blinks in surprise when his drawing pad is suddenly covered in shadow, glancing up and shielding his eyes to see who the newcomer is.  “Tony?” he manages, wondering if this is really the case.  Why would he be here, though?  Steve would think that he has other obligations, doing… whatever people like him do.  But his eyesight adjusts enough so that he can make out the other man’s goatee in the glare, and he finds himself smiling.  It
"Then maybe I should start at the beginning," Tony said softly, staring at his feet.  "Zolpidem, ethanol, methylchloride, and ophentonyl.  Do you know what those are?"
Steve just laughs at that, leaning back into the couch comfortably, though his hand is worrying at his wrist again.  Does he even realize he’s doing that?
"If that's what you want to call it," Cap replied dubiously.  "Why were you in the airship in the first place?"
.  And maybe yet another part had something to do with the fact that okay, yeah, Steve was very, very nice to look at.
Tony found himself sagging suddenly within the confines of the suit, the joints bending, the back slumping.  It's done, he thought to himself over and over again.  It's done.  It's done.
That night, he lies in his cabin for several long hours, restless, before he finally decides to get out of bed.  Forgoing shoes or socks, he patters slowly up to the top deck, and then he walks and he walks and he walks until he can’t walk anymore, because here the ship ends and the ocean begins.  Carefully, he reaches out, gripping at the rail, feeling the smooth metal beneath his skin, and then he steps up onto the lowest rung, holding on tight.  He then takes a deep breath, letting go with one hand to touch his shoulder, to feel the scarred and toughened skin there.  So many memories, and yet this is all that remains.
He hit the ground with a sharp cry, the impact setting off another wave of pain from his bullet wound.  For a moment, Steve could only lie there in agony, his whole body aching.  By the time he was able to force himself up, four of the biters had followed him over the railing, and more were coming—whether because of the noise he'd made upon landing or just bad luck, he didn't know.  It didn't matter.  The only thing that
"See?" Stark said.  "Now let's get a move on.  We've got a thousand miles to go, and I mean that literally."
Tony could come up with plenty of reasons on his own.  Despite the fact that summer had ended, Steve hadn't gone back to school - he was continuing to work instead, presumably because he needed the income in order to have something to eat and a place to live.  And if he were in the military, both room and board would be provided, not to mention pay.
He brings out the paper with the speech he failed to give earlier, managing to deliver it now without breaking down.  When he gets to the part about Steve’s battle cry, though, he’s struck by a powerful memory of Steve rallying the Avengers back in their glory days, and the realization that he’ll never hear it again is so awful it brings him to his knees.  Jan is by his side in an instant, placing one hand against his shoulder.  “Do you need some time alone?” she asks softly.
Natasha nodded.  "I'll leave you two to it," she said.  "Stay as long as you need.  There are more elastic bandages in the next room for Tony's ankle."  With that, she left, and Steve and Tony were alone in the room.
Tony blinked slowly.  "Steroids?" he said.  "Where did we get those?  For that matter, where are we?"
The hair was longer, the face older, but Steve would recognize him anywhere.  "Bucky," he repeated, stumbling toward him, putting out of his mind the whiteness of his eyes and the blood-red of his lips.  It was
what Steve had been hoping for, but he hardly minds this, and so he shuts his eyes, kissing him back.  When they’re done, Tony goes back to resting his head against his shoulder, leaning against him.  “I think I’ve been waiting forever for you,” he says quietly.  “And I’m not letting you go so easily.”
Tony ducked on instinct, but he looked up in time to see Rhodey launching himself toward Cap, who had wandered deeper into the room—there was a flash of
A slight grimace mars that perfect face of his, and Tony exhales sharply, staring back up into the sky.  “Point taken.  I was… just in a bad place.  Everything was building up.  I had to let it out.  I’m still upset.”  He falls silent for a moment, looking contemplative.  “…I think I feel better now, though.  Thanks to you.”
Steve breathed, and then he breathed again, and then he was awake and he was panicking, those blue eyes of his that Tony had seen so often in the mirror wide and alarmed as he took them in - the wasp, the giant, the god, the robot - what a sight they must be - and then he was grabbing his shield and he was attacking them, moving as though he hadn't been frozen for decades.
"It's just some light reading," Tony said.  And some heavy equations.  He'd been pulled out of the Rad Lab on short notice and still wanted to work on a few things—mostly long-range navigation.  The sooner he could figure everything out, the better.
This, Tony has to admit, is a little distressing.  The man’s face, up close like this, is exquisite.  It’s ridiculously open and honest—he’s never seen anything like it before.  How can he, when he’s dealing with backstabbers all the time?  “Yes, you are,” he replies, forcing himself to look away.  “You don’t know me.  I’m just a suit.”
“So,” Tony said by way of greeting as he slid into Steve’s sleeping quarters, since the door was open and really, he should have closed it if he didn’t want visitors.  “I see you still have your charming pelt there.  Any plans for it?”
"Don't even think about it," Tony said from behind him.  Steve chanced a glance back and saw that he'd drawn his rifle and was pointing it at her.  "Tell us what the hell you're up to.  Now."
He couldn't stay here any longer.  As Maya turned to the side to do something with the syringe, Steve took the chance to glance around the room again—still distressingly no Tony, but this time he noticed both of their packs lying nearby, along with his shield and Tony's shovel and rifle.  Confined as he was to the chair, though, he wouldn't be able to use anything inside the packs, which meant he needed to stop being confined to the chair.
“Your turn,” Tony said, clapping his hands.  “Hup-hup.”  If he didn’t show any doubt, then Rogers would surely succeed, right?
From the corner of his eye, he can see Steve’s lips twitch, but the other man remains silent as they turn into their suite.  “Oh, I didn’t realize standing around counted as looking for someone,” Tony replies as airily as he can.  “Wait, what am I talking about?  We’re the social elite.  Standing around is all we do.”  He hears Sunset take a deep breath, like she’s about to make some sort of heavy-handed retort, but he quickly interrupts, continuing, “Look, I’m sure you’re very angry at me right now, and you’ve probably even managed to justify it in your head, but something’s happened—”
That was a low blow, and Stark surely knew it.  "You do what you have to," Steve said.  "But I'm not you, and I won't do the things you've done."
"Wait, hold on," Steve said, but the voice kept speaking over him as though he weren't even there, going into far many details about light energy and surface mounting, whatever that was supposed to mean.
, and obviously he had to get that too because who would see an omelette line and not get an omelette?
Rogers sighed but let go, allowing Tony to straighten and take another deep breath.  How long did fractured ribs take to heal?  It would be nice when breathing stopped hurting.  “Fine,” Rogers said.  “So do you know where we’re going?”
Tem was on top of him in an instant, fingers scrambling to grapple with what looked like a clunky ring on his index finger.  "You can't—leave—" he ground out in between the sounds of Tony shooting at the biters outside the press box, and Steve pushed his hands away in time to see a short burst of flame shoot out of the top of the ring.
There.  Steve emerges from one of the stairwells, looking around and breaking into a smile once he sees Tony, and it’s all Tony can do to not melt on the spot.  He has a really great smile.  Does he know that?  Probably he does.  How can he not?  “Steve,” he greets, reaching out to take his hand.  “You’re early.”
, okay, he would really like Tony to have sex with him right about now.  “Come on,” he urges.  “I want more.  Don’t you?”
Steve stared at Tony blankly for a moment, barely able to process it.  It had already been such a terrible weapon to start with, and to hear that it was used to effectively end civilization as they knew it… "I don't understand," he said.  "It wasn't meant for that.  Was it?"
Steve blinks at him, his face breaking into a wide smile, and for a blissful, beautiful moment, Tony feels like the sun’s come out and everything is warm and dry and perfect again.  “C-come here,” he says, and he leans forward to press a kiss to his forehead, then his nose, then his lips; Tony makes no move at all to stop him.  “W-want you to know something,” he continues, and he presses a few more kisses to his skin before going back to gazing at him—Tony finds himself reminded of when they initially met, looking into those blue eyes for the first time.  So beautiful.  So, so beautiful.  “I-I’d do this all again in a h-h-heartbeat, Tony.  I would.  B-because I got to meet you, and that m-makes it all worth it.”
Tony tried pulling his hands away again.  This time, Steve let go, though he kept an eye out to make sure he didn't start rubbing them raw.  "I need to get clean," Tony whispered.  "I can't stand being covered in this."
He watches as Tony runs his hand against the rail, brows furrowing before he turns to meet his eyes again.  “No,” the other man says at last.  “I don’t think we are.”
For now, though, the skies seemed clear, and Steve seemed to be himself, if quietly trotting up a mountain while inhabiting the body of a prehistoric cat counted as being himself.  Several times, Tony wondered if he should just… say something, anything, to break the silence, but what good would it do?  Steve couldn’t talk back.  While he was moving, he couldn’t even spell anything.  So Tony just stayed quiet, enjoying the ride as best as he could.
Tony attends—and fails to give a speech at—Steve’s funeral, which draws a crowd of thousands.  He’s brought to his knees when the Watcher appears and shows him the perfect future that he’d let slip through his fingers.  Then, finally, he and what’s left of the original Avengers—only Jan and Hank now—take Steve’s body to the Arctic.  It’s here, after all, where Steve once found solitude in an ever-changing world, and so it’s here he should find it again.
Tony frowned down at the name.  It seemed familiar, like he'd seen it recently.  Maybe even as recently as earlier today, on some of the items he'd moved or packed.  Was it… maybe Ma's name? Was Joseph Steve's dad? It would make sense. He vaguely remembered something about Steve's dad having been in the army, and this confirmed it.
Steve turns back to look at him when he speaks, breaking out into a broad smile.  “Tony,” he says.  “I was afraid you weren’t gonna come.”
Tony lets out another soft laugh, eyes crinkling again.  “Most people in your position dream of money and status,” he says.  “You dream of riding dolphins.”  He lets go of his hand then, reaching up to lightly stroke his cheek.  “I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again—you’re unreal, Steve.”
“Of course I know what words are,” Steve says, and he reaches out to grip at the wrist with the watch, looking almost—pained for a second.  Tony wonders if he imagined it.  “She showed them to me, too.  I didn’t understand it, but I think she wanted me to talk to Hank about them.”
, Tony desperately wants to say, but he holds his tongue.  No matter how unreal Steve is, Tony still finds it impossible to believe that the other man would want to hear his life story.  “It’s nothing,” he replies at last.  “Really.  You should stop worrying.”
For a brief moment, he entertains the possibility of going back to Steve, apologizing, and then running back up to the top deck for dear life.  But then he thinks of Steve right now, standing in the same darkness as him without even the luxury of movement, and he’s ashamed for even thinking it.  Either they both make it out, or neither of them does.
"'Hmm' yourself," Tony retorted very cleverly as he cast a meaningful gaze at Ty's cereal in return.
He thought about the arguments they’d had the first few days after they’d landed, of the way they’d sniped and snarked at each other, and then he thought about his heart, beating steadily now in his chest, seemingly cured of whatever illness had stricken it.  Then he thought again of Steve, of the way he’d looked at Tony as he told him about what had happened to his heart, and of the way he’d wrapped his arm around him and held him close.  At some point, Steve had crossed the line from
“Close.  But…”  Steve can’t help it anymore.  He really can’t.  Tony looks so damn inviting, and Steve finds him impossible to resist.  So he stands up and walks over to him as the other man arches an eyebrow.  Steve grins.  He’s not going to let Tony be the
.  "You really did pack like it was an A-day."  He picked out his agenda next, flipping it open before making a soft sound of triumph and turning it around so Tony could see.  "Okay, wait, here we go. I hope this convinces you."
Tony sighed to himself, putting all the letters back where he'd found them.  Maybe he needed to stop feeling annoyed. It wasn't Steve's fault. It wasn't anyone's fault.  Steve had been trying to help Tony in the only way he knew how, and would it really kill Tony to try and respect his wishes?
"Thanks," Tony replied.  He turned then, looking at the skeleton that they were finally standing next to.  It wasn't fair.  He would have loved to take his time here, to check everything out, but it wasn't in the cards.  There was only enough time to spot the fragment they'd been looking for resting atop the skeleton's sternum—Cap reached for it first, though, and held it up to him.
Tony snorted softly, though he was still smiling.  "Says one of the greatest heroes of the twentieth century."  When Steve opened his mouth to protest, Tony held up his free hand.  "Sorry, but you can't fight it.  The history books have already added you."
And Steve comes, crying out Tony’s name so loud he’s sure everyone on the entire ship can hear, his entire body clenching and arching as he feels warmth splatter across his stomach.  Tony keeps on fucking him until Steve feels like every last drop has been wrung from his body before he finally lets go as well, and Steve groans as he can feel Tony shooting deep into him, shouting his name in response.
Steve feels his heart swell.  “I’m glad you came for me, Tony,” he says, and he leans forward, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.  This next part isn’t going to be easy, but he needs to say it.  He’s unbelievably happy that Tony came to find him, knowing that what they have together managed to transcend all the damage his father tried to do to it—but Tony’s life is more important.  And anyway, this… this is enough, knowing that Tony believes in him.  If—when he dies tonight, they’ll both know the truth.  “I’m sorry I made your life so difficult.  But there’s no time.  You have to go back up, okay?  Go up and get into a lifeboat.  For me.”
"Just like that."  Tony glanced at Cap, but his expression was unreadable.  "I've adventured with a lot of people in my day, Cap."  Some of those people had already been friends.  Some had become friends.
His gaze drifted to the windows and back.  The autopilot had been haphazardly slapped together, but it was working for now, which was the important part.  "What will you do?" he asked.  "Once this is over?"
Yeah.  Yeah, he was awake, even though he kind of wished he wasn't, because now he was remembering all the places he was hurting.  It had been much more peaceful when he'd been passed out.  "Yes," he managed nonetheless.
“You remembered?”  No one’s ever… just remembered things like this about him before.  Howard remembers, but only to ridicule him for it.  Steve, though…
“Yeah,” Tony repeats, because that’s pretty much what happened.  He cracks a smile, squeezing Steve’s hand in return.  “See?  That was a completely fatal situation, but here I am.  It’s fine.”
“You get out and do all the fun stuff while I shoot things from my hidey hole,” Tony said.  “Yes.  Got it.”
The polite response would be to say that he was glad to be back, but Steve didn't think he could bring himself to say such a thing.  He doubted Tony would believe him, anyway.  How could he be glad to be brought back to a world that was now a more dangerous, darker place than the one he remembered?  Everything had changed, and none of it had been for the better.
“And you’re very hard to please,” Rogers replied.  “But don’t worry.  We should be back on the airship by tomorrow, and then you can eat whatever you want.”
“L-longer,” Tony repeats.  He’s starting to feel like he’s losing himself.  It’s cold and he’s hurting and the two of them are drifting somewhere on the Atlantic, surrounded by the dying and the dead.  By morning, what will have changed?  Steve says the lifeboats will come, but even if they do, then what?  Is more help coming?  He doesn’t know.  He doesn’t know a damn thing, and he’s starting to not even give a shit anymore.  The only thing anchoring him right now is Steve.  “T-talk to me,” he whispers.
In the next instant, Steve had bounded forward to close the distance between them, hissing.  “Uh, Steve?” Tony began, backing away.  He bumped into a tree, then quickly shimmied out of the way so he could keep on backing up, since Steve was being creepy and continuing to approach him slowly.  “It’s me, Tony.  You remember me, right?  Because you have a sort of glint in your eye and it’s unnerving me just a little.  So why don’t you just—”
Quickly, he turned back into the room, scooping Maya into his arms before taking off again down the hallway.  Half a minute later, he nearly collided with a woman emerging from another room, who gasped and clutched her hand to her heart.  "What did you do to Maya?" she screamed.
, but it doesn’t matter.  Whatever comes—whether it be hell or high water—they’re going to face it together now, and that’s the only thing that does matter.
Steve doesn’t expect Tony to notice when he stands to leave the workshop.  Tony’s attention has been laser-focused since JARVIS had let them know that Bruce would have to cut the control wires to James’s arm.  He is working like a man possessed.
“This essay’s about The Potato Eaters,” Steve says.  “And it’s perfect.  It’s everything I’d say if I could put my thoughts to paper the way you can.  This is art interpretation at its
Dum-E is elated to be given the job of cameraman. He drops the camera twice within the first minute of taping, and the outtakes from that are going to be hilarious. Steve doesn’t get more than a dozen words out before they have to start again. Tony’s face as he scolds Dum-E is priceless.
“Let me, Tony,” Bruce says. “James, you’re going to need to close your eyes and I know that won’t be easy if you don’t trust the person next to you. And if it will help to ground you, I don’t mind you holding your knife.”
In 57 minutes of game play, he only lets one puck by him, and it’s a top shelf, glove side goal from the point.  He stops every other attempt and it sets the Stars up for a score of 1 to 1. Steve barely notices Tony on the ice now. He’s got eyes for the puck and that’s it. He’s making saves that are going to light up the highlight reels for years to come. It’s the game of his career. He’s playing for himself, yes, and his upset at Tony is giving him a sort of laser-focus, too, and he wants to win this for Bucky.
What he has taken quite personally is his temporary suspension from the team. Yes, he probably deserves it for punching Rumlow off the ice. But other people have done that before and gotten punished with less. No. This isn’t about Steve’s momentary temper flare. This is because the coaches think he’s a distraction.
Bucky, Clint and Steve stay upstairs to get to work on their assignments, while Tony follows Nanna back down to the basement.  He’d guessed correctly, the large metal cabinet is the weapons cache.  What he hadn’t guessed is that the huge safe opens to reveal another door.   The weapons are through there, and it’s a room twice the size of the visible part of the basement.  It must take up the space under the whole of the back yard.
“Had it going on,” Steve corrects. The picture makes him happy, but at the same time, seeing her floods him with a sadness that he’s too tired to mask. “She passed away a few years ago. Had a happy life though. Named a son after me. A grandson, too. The boy you saw tonight was her great-grandson, Steven.”
If Bruce had written down a thousand guesses as to how James was going to answer his question, that wouldn’t have been on there. He’s not entirely sure what to do with it.
“I do as well,” Jarvis agrees.  “What I do know of them gives me reason to believe we had similar objectives in the prioritization of your safety and wellbeing.  I do believe I would have liked them very much.”
He can feel that his cheeks have gone warm.  Steve Rogers is troll enough to make him blush.  Tony is such a goner.
“I am an acceptable witness for any Stark Industries paperwork, this form included,” Jarvis confirms.
“I don’t want to fight. You asked me what I’d say to him. That’s what I’d say. I’d tell him I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry.”
Tony’s got to give credit to his friends-- none of them even startle.  Clint shifts his chair back an inch or two to avoid some spilled water, Bruce and Nat cross their arms menacingly and Steve stares down the room.
“This is for you two,” Bucky says, dropping an old metal wash bucket full of chemicals and cleaning supplies on the table in front of Tony and Bruce.  “We’re gonna need explosions.  Big ones that hopefully look and sound a lot worse than they are since we’re gonna be near by.  The better the distraction the less chance Nanna and Kate will get caught.”
A few hours have passed since the conversation about Pepper.  Tony’d welcomed Steve back thoroughly, they’d showered, and now they’ve ventured out to the kitchen, half-dressed.
“I know it’s ridiculously late,” Bruce continues, “but I’m thinking of making a stir fry since there’s food here and I haven’t had the luxury of a kitchen in a while. I can make a side of rice in broth, if you want to give it a try? When I was living in India, that would be the first food I’d introduce to anyone recovering from stomach issues.”
Of course Bruce hadn’t had an inkling of that when he’d offered James help, but lack of intent never did anything to soothe Bruce’s guilt.
“So you can ramble.  Good to know,” Tony says.  “Glad it’s not just me.  Beer and normalcy, coming right up.”
“I thought the whole reason we have a secure chat is so we don’t spend all day texting in code,” Steve says as he reads it through a second time.
Natasha’s got the gun out of Sam’s hand before Sam has time to protest. She fires once, hitting James expertly in the shoulder. The beeps steady back out and the neural alarms silence.
He doesn't resist at all as Steve drags him down against the cushions and pins him there.  Steve's response is muffled in Tony's neck, but Tony can hear him well enough to be filled with a warm, pleasant glow.
After all the kind and gentle therapists they’ve dealt with lately, this is a big change.  Steve approves.  He glances at Tony.
“It was the second underground network Nanna founded,” Steve says proudly.  “Her first was in France, during World War 2.  She was fifteen.”
“It’s probably the scanner. Flip this one when the bubbles start to set,” Bruce says, handing Clint the spatula and nodding toward the pancake.
“Just trying to help,” Bucky says.  “Tony’s trusting us with his life.  Seems like he ought to know why.”
Steve’s pretty sure Tony’s lost his mind and decided that because Steve hasn’t been eating, he’s about to make a meal for... 40?  It doesn’t make much sense but Steve feels obligated to assist.  When the box is full to the brim, Tony points at it.
Neither party will request, apply for, or in any way accept a direct supervisory relationship with the other.
The topic changes after that. They both have more than enough to think about, and it’s easier to move on to less touchy subjects. Steve tells Tony about how he’s been going to the tower at least once a day to air things out, and talk to Jarvis, and visit Tony’s bots.
Once they have James in a bed, Clint stays with him. He needs the rest and he won’t be any help moving things from the quinjet into the house with his arm in a sling. Sam and Natasha come as close as the doorway of James’s room but never any closer. Even though the soldier is asleep, they respect his wishes. It’s one of a dozen reasons why Bruce finds himself grateful for their help.
Steve’s not expecting to see anyone he recognizes. Especially not any fellow hockey players. Considering it’s Tony Stark, the presence of another pro doesn’t really bring Steve any comfort.
“It was Bruce’s idea,” Steve says, dragging one of the pillows over his own face and holding it there. “I didn’t like the way you looked at him.”
“Ah pal, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet,” Bucky says, extending Tony a hand to help him down out of the trunk.  “Wait till you see the guy hiding in the trash.”
Steve’s a little worried when Tony doesn’t text any more that night. But maybe he was tired and he’d gone to bed. They’d definitely kept each other busy. When there’s no text the next morning, Steve breaks down and texts first.
“Hello to you, too,” Steve says gently.  “And no.  I came straight here, like you asked.  What’s going on?”
He doesn’t have long to look.  They’ve got a shit ton of setting up to do and they are on the clock.  The plan is to set off the explosive ten minutes after radio silence.  That gives Nanna and Kate ten minutes to get in and get into place before the guards all (hopefully) get pulled.
The soldier stares at the bottle of water with the same intensity he’d stared at Bruce. Bruce gets the feeling it isn’t anything personal.
“Right,” Steve says.  “Of course.  Ummm... I was at a retirement party for General Carston, and there was a man that kept trying to talk to me.  His name was Justin Hammer.  I blew him off, but then one of Tony’s exes was there, too, and I could hear him talking to Hammer at the next table over.  He’s going to sell him a video.  The guy said it’s... graphic.  That Tony spends a lot of it begging to be let free...”
“What if you shouldn’t give me a new arm at all? What if I get that thing and start killing people with it?” James asks.
“What did you do really?” Steve asks, once he’s pressed against Tony’s side. “Why are they all so sorry?”
Tony reaches to Steve’s McMuffin and picks it up and places it next to the few bites left of his own, possessively.
It’s stupid.  It’s selfish.  Peggy would smack him upside the head if she ever caught him feeling this sorry for himself when he’s alive and safe and for once nobody is dead.
“It’s okay to have a crush on someone.  You weren’t doing anything wrong, there.  So I looked into it for you,” she says.  “Turns out, since you aren’t his direct supervisor, it only takes one form.”
For an entire month after their fight, Tony rarely speaks to Steve outside of missions.  When he does, it’s clipped and concise.  Tony stops using nicknames, stops snarking.  He’s carefully polite, which might be the most disturbing change of all.  Every single attempt on Steve’s part to reconcile with Tony is quickly rebuffed.  It turns out, Tony is really good at being mean while using the best manners possible.  He’d fit in great on Downton Abbey.
Bruce sounds bitterly sad about all this. Like he’s repeating things he’s heard other people say, or maybe his own deepest doubts about his likability or worth.
Tony’s so happy and surprised to see Bruce that he can’t stop staring at him and smiling. Like he can’t quite believe Bruce is there.
Steve doesn’t miss how Clint kicks up his foot onto the booth across from them, so it rests against Bruce’s thigh. Huh.
“Tony’s... Tony,” Bruce says simply.  “There’s no easy way to explain what’s going on there, but he’s not a threat.  I guess maybe it’s time for a story of my own.  Meeting Tony Stark-- I don’t know if you’d have a reference for what that would be like.  He’s famous.  He’s
“It’s not,” Pepper says.  “It was nothing personal.  Tony made that very clear.  He used those exact words, in fact.”
“Shitshitshit,” Clint swears, as the drone footage switches from the server building to a much further overhead shot from Stark Satelite Three.  The new images shows the helicopter is moving fast.  “They are not fucking around.”
Bruce’s smile brightens. “That depends on how you feel about relocating Manhattan to the moon. Me? I’m not a fan.”
“If we’re going to be doing some walking, would you mind if I take a look at your injuries?” Bruce asks. “I think I can make some suggestions without needing to touch you, if that would make you more comfortable.”
They skate again after their chat. More slowly and without all the playful checking from before. It’s comfortable. And it’s late. Steve only realizes it when he yawns.
“It’s like the bad press confirms everything he thinks about himself,” Rhodey says.  "Like he wants to read that shit."
“Whenever,” Tony says. “Her birthday isn’t for another few months and I promised her a new pair of skates I’ve been working on for that. This is a gift just because she’s awesome.”
Tony’s face is buried in his knees but Steve sees his head bob and understands it as permission.  He eases closer to Tony and wraps an arm around him.  Tony leans fully into his grasp, still breathing rapidly and Steve applies a little pressure to his shoulder to help ground him.
Tony shuts off his phone. He appreciates the support from his friends, he really does. And he’s sure not going to lose any sleep over a break from his dad. But he’s exhausted and he kind of can’t believe he did it. He really did it.
There’s a minute long pause before Bruce gets his next reply.  A full minute of Bruce picturing Tony
Steve starts to talk to give Tony a solid distraction, first about himself as a kid, and then the story stretches on to his teen years.  The bullying, the fighting, the never staying down.  Steve talks about Bucky and missing him.  About the first time he saw boobs.  When it moves to the war, Steve avoids his own triggers.  He talks about how much better grapes tasted off the vine in Italy, and about learning to steal cars.  Basically anything that comes to mind until finally Tony relaxes against his arm.  It’s maybe 30 or 40 minutes later.
Tony stares at the counter in dismay.  He’s emptied nearly every cabinet in the kitchen looking for caffeine, booze, or anything similar and he’s come up dry. Barton has stocked this place with canned peas and boxed mashed potatoes and absolutely zero essentials and that is nearly criminal.
“Okay, so I don’t miss the yelling,” Steve agrees. “But the other parts. Seeing you around. Bringing you breakfast. Knowing you’ve got my six out in the field. I miss all of that.”
“I know I’m not technically in the game,” Steve says.  “But this is Unknown Awesome and I’m awarding myself the points.”
“You had a couple weapons on you when shit went wrong this morning,” Clint insists. “And the worst I got from you defending yourself was a couple bruised ribs and a jacked up arm. Think about that.”
Rehab is Tony’s idea.  He tells Steve that’s where he wants to go, once he emerges from his bedroom, dressed in a pair of dark blue pajama bottoms and a Stark Industries t shirt.  Pepper hadn’t touched Tony’s clothes.  Everything he owns is right where it belongs.
“I would have been a dick about it,” Tony admits. “I was relieved when I saw Jarvis’s activity log. I was embarrassed but relieved.”
Tony strongly considers quitting his job, right there on the spot.  He can retire, make Pepper the CEO, no longer be Steve’s boss, and then all the HR objections in the world won’t stop him from dating this man.  That feeling only increases as Steve takes out his phone and takes a damn selfie with Tony’s bots.
Tony nods in agreement and that’s that.  He’s still not comfortable with Nanna risking her life for him but he won’t insult her by pointing out all the ways this could go wrong.
With his mind made up, he waits until the very last minute to change out of his Dior suit into a pair of beat up jeans and a faded MIT shirt.  He throws on a hoodie and a ballcap and hopes that's enough to throw off any paparazzi that might be wandering the streets of New York.   They don't wait outside the building anymore like they used to, since the chances of getting a glimpse of Tony have gone to nil the last few months.
“Bad. Ass,” Clint says, lifting it and admiring it with the sort of adoration generally reserved for a firstborn child.
“I’d like Tony to come down,” Bruce says.  “I know just enough to know there’s something that still needs fixed.”
“I’m not gonna cry cause you say his name,” James cuts him off in a drawl, before limping over to the couch and plopping himself down.
The six people ahead of them laugh and chat and move as one, like a murmuration of starlings.  Their friendship is effortless.  Tony feels his nerves return, but at least he’s got Bruce, and they make quiet small talk the few blocks to the restaurant.  Once they’re inside, Steve leads the way to a table, and Bruce and Tony are separated as Bruce is nudged into the booth and Clint scrambles in behind him to claim “best seat”.
Clint is cackling loud enough to be heard easily despite the distance.  “It wasn’t me, Nat!  It was Tony, I swear.  He’s a sharpshooter.  You’ve got to keep your eyes on that guy.”
“Bruce would come back if you told him that you need him.” Steve’s voice is firm, like he’s speaking something he knows to be true.
After that, Steve beats the hell out of a few punching bags until he finally hits one so hard it bends the steel girder above his head and he knows he needs to stop.  He sits on the gym floor, dejected, missing Bucky and Peggy and Howard.  Hating this stupid place and every stupid thing about it.
“We do accept booze,” Clint adds from the bed. “As restitution. If you’re ever in the mood to make amends.”
Tony flips his phone toward them.  It begins to show a live video feed of Justin Hammer, starting  a speech at the HammerTech headquarters, and he’s speaking to a huge group of assembled investors and press. As fortune would have it, it’s a building less than five miles away from the server farm they just raided and it can’t be all that far from where Nat has them now.
Bruce puts his hands over the cloth Sam has applied to the stab wound and puts some weight against it as Sam maneuvers James onto his back.
“You wouldn’t have known where we were going even if I told you,” Tony says, easing the huge SUV into a narrow clearing.  He puts it in park and undoes his safety belt.  “Okay.  Everybody out.  Steve and I need to kill you and bury you real quick because we’ve got an appointment up the road in...” he glances at his watch.  “Half an hour.”
this noise, and all that flooded through his head was sheer worry. It made him want to drop everything and risk coming out of hiding just to go see Tony and tell him the same things he would tell him back then, but also to hold him tight and assure him that everything would be okay because he was there and Steve would protect him from
That alone made Tony's heart skip a few beats as he felt tears involuntarily beginning to run down his cheeks, along with more sobs being choked out. Steve knew this sound, and it worried him. For three years, he encountered this noise on many instances where Tony woke up crying and shaking in a cold sweat. Steve was
Steve hated yet appreciated how this was the first time in months Tony had opened up like this to him. Things hadn't been the same since Ultron. And he could tell. Steve wondered to himself if this was the first time Tony spoke to him like this, when he assumed he was asleep. If Tony had complained to him other nights when he crawled in bed and Steve just hadn't woken up to hear it, unlike tonight.
And as if things couldn't get worse from there, further into the fight, Tony realized that Steve was going to
." Steve held Tony closer than he ever had, guiding him over to the bed so they could sit down. Just like they would all those years ago. Nothing had ever felt more right to have him back like this. In his arms, where Steve felt as if he could keep him safe like this. Tony sniffled, shaking his head and attempting to stop his cries, muffling something under his breath Steve could just barely make out as "'s okay". Steve just held his head, guiding Tony onto his lap so he could face him, so he could talk to him.
Tony was quick to hook his resting leg around Steve's waist, encouraging to stay exactly where he was. Steve got the gesture and just nodded, leaning down to take Tony in his arms again, pushing further and further inside, Tony nearly choking on the moans he tried to hold back, to which Steve had no choice but to encourage him to let it out.
shitfaced, getting deeper and deeper into his own thoughts. He sat out on the edge of the pane of a large window that had the most beautiful view of New York City. Tony had remembered
However, the past four weeks or so of working together and being with Tony holds some of his happiest moments he's had in what seems like forever. The little moments they'd have together, just the two of them, the late nights going over timelines and eating their Avengers-inspired Ben & Jerry's ice cream as what was nearly a joke, even the little moments in The Time Heist. Tony asking Steve if he trusted him, Steve assuring him he did. After all of that, something inside Steve snapped as he watched Tony nearing his death after defeating Thanos himself. Something about seeing Tony accepting his death caused a chain reaction inside of him that made him let go and frantically doing anything to keep Tony alive.
Can't believe you're mine." Tony moaned into Steve's mouth when he came back up. Steve lifted his head up, pulling away, leaning up on his knees and crawling away from Tony to try and make it to the nightstand drawer, grab the bottle of lube, and get back to him as soon as he could.
and other curses over and over followed by other un-thought through cries of pleasure; being so overstimulated already, not having even come yet. Steve had made a low, almost
" Tony's face flushed, even more than he already was, that somehow even being possible. Steve hooked his finger under Tony's chin, leading him to turn his head to face Steve behind him. Steve kissed him oh-so deeply and nuzzled his nose against Tony's, breathing softly against him, telling him again how good he was being for him, knowing Tony may not believe it, but would never stop telling him. "You
he missed Steve. If he didn't know any better, it'd be safe to say he was almost positive he was going to take that to his grave. And of course never to Pepper, as he didn't know it, but was going back to her in desperate attempt to keep himself sane.
Steve wasn't necessarily surprised by Tony coming to the compound, more-so taken back at what he had to say.
Steve gripped Tony's hips tighter, turning them over so Tony was beneath him. Steve settled between his legs, having them now wrapped around his waist, his hands roaming underneath and up Tony's shirt, sliding them under the middle small of his back. The little noises of pleasure Tony made catching Steve off guard above him, reminding himself to withdraw his hands and helping Tony undress instead. Neither of them could tell how long they went back and forth like this; the brief undressing, the slow-then-quickly-turned-fast paced kisses, the pauses in between where they would giggle together at something the other said. They couldn't tell you how absolutely amazing it felt either. It sounded straight out of a romantic movie of some sorts, how
It didn't take long, to find a new home for The Avengers. Originally, the plan was to move back into the old tower in the city. However, everyone could agree on the needing for a fresh start, that of course leading to the decision to find a new place. The new Avengers compound, still in the upstate, is where Steve currently lived. Along with nearly everyone else who didn't know where to go at the moment. It was still a work in process, but it was a new home. And so that's where Tony went, to Steve. To home.
