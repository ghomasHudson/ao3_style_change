He pressed his hands on his belly with a bigger strength and tried to push the bulge down, horrified to realise that his stomach kept responding with the same force. The pressure inside his guts was hard to deny, especially when it started to push outwards against his hands and sent shivers through his spine.
Slowly, in order to give his friend an opportunity to withdraw, the short doctor reached out his hand and laid it gently on the moving mass of Sherlock's middle. His finger pads brushed against the hot skin which almost vibrated under his touch.
Sherlock nodded and remained silent for a while, thoughts racing in his head like mad.
However, it wasn't a good idea to taunt his brother in this state, he didn't even want to imagine himself in his shoes. " But John takes it quite well, doesn't he? How did he react?"
The raven-haired man wrapped his arms around himself in a defensive manner and his lips turned into a pout. " It was an accident... Don't worry, I cleaned it perfectly!" So that's why the kitchen was so clean and tidy!
The doctor started to rub light circles on detective's bare skin.
As soon as he said that, an unstoppable gasp found its way out of his chest.
John prayed for it to work, he has just raised Sherlock's hopes of getting back to normal, what if it doesn't work at all? Sherlock will be devastated if it malfunctions. But it was a better option than doing nothing.
" Yep, together with baking powder..." Came an unsure reply from the bathroom.
" I know... Calm down, Lock...Stop thinking about it, you're only torturing yourself..."
Mycroft took out a snowy white handkerchief from the breast pocket of his jacket and handed it to his brother.
" No need, brother dear. It's a sure thing..."
" You're really scaring me! If you won't open the door, I'll knock it out!"
A flick of fear stormed through John's eyes and he immediately started to check on Sherlock's lean body. He seemed to be unharmed, thank goodness! " Are you alright? You're not hurt, are you?"
John turned to look Sherlock in the face, asking him nonverbally if he wants him to go. The detective nodded slightly. " Sure..." John rose up from the ground and left the bathroom, closing the door behind himself.
" I see...". Mycroft couldn't help but make a pointed remark, he didn't like to hear someone stating the painfully obvious.
The elder one watched the man in front with sad eyes, seeing his poor sibling fight with the unyielding power which made his body change was hard to look at. " I'm afraid that I don't know what to do... I'm sorry, brother mine..." He said in the softest voice Sherlock has ever heard him use and moved his hands on Sherlock's shoulders which started to tremble slightly.
Was that what Sherlock was scared of? He was a doctor, he could examine people in no time and he could say that it had almost no effect on him. However, this was Sherlock, a bit different case...
" Sherlock? Are you okay?"
He would never leave the flat when looking as if he had just swallowed a beach ball, which would mean that he would never take a single case again (that was a horrible thing to imagine, he had a feeling that their wall wouldn't survive Sherlock's annoyance and boredom).
: Mycroft
" I-I'm fine! Don't worry!" He shouted and couldn't suppress a groan of pain when the stupid waistband started to dig into the sensitive flesh and left there a red line of a pressure sore.
Then he spread his fingers and pressed his palm on the expanding gut and stroked it with such a softness and care it made detective's breath hitch.
The detective tried to cover himself with his hands, but it was too late.
John immediately rushed towards his friend and looked him from head to toes. He seemed fine to him, he was maybe a bit red in his face... " Sherlock! Are you okay? What's wrong?" His small palm pressed to his forehead to check his temperature. The detective's forehead sweated excessively, but no signs of the fever...
" I-I'm s-sorry, My... I've d-deserved this, ha-haven't I? F-for the w-way I had treated y-you..." He said, almost weeping.
How typical of him...
A snivel echoed through the bathroom when Sherlock wiped his nose.
The dining table which has always been messy and almost bent under Sherlock's unused things was now completely empty and tidy and when John opened the fridge, he could find just FOOD, no signs of body parts or any other disgusting things Sherlock liked to store in there.
" Does it look like that?" The redhead man raised his eyebrow and tutted. Deep inside he was shocked, it was so strange to see his bony brother fill out into such size...
The detective propped on his hand and tried to bent around his mounting tummy, but it didn't let him. It was getting in his way as if it heard John's advice and tried to baffle Sherlock's intentions.
The skin felt hot under his touch and there was a little bulge on his lower abdomen.
This was just a bad dream, it had to be! This was biologically impossible, unreal!
Sherlock's cheeks flushed dark red from embarrassment and he bowed down his head in shame. He made a just feeble attempt to hide the abomination on his stomach with his hands, he knew that there was no use.
Yours,
Sherlock couldn't stay here and he knew it. He jumped out of the sofa and wrapped his arms around himself tightly to shield it from John's view.
" He knows, doesn't he?" Sherlock asked, his voice strangely unsure.
Sherlock's face lit up with new hope and his heart started to pound fast. " It could work! How come I haven't thought of it? You're the best, John!" He let out a shout of joy, thanking his friend for his culinary knowledge.
Dough...
" Did you come here just to make fun of me, Mycroft?" Said Sherlock, his voice cracked on the elder man's name. There were wet traces on his cheeks, it was evident that his baby brother had cried.
John shook his head, patted Sherlock's tummy softly and gave him a boosting smile. " You don't have to thank me, it's a matter of course... I just think that you could appreciate some new clothes. I'm sure Tesco is still open, it's still not that late..."
The doctor's hand ran into Sherlock's wild black hair and he caressed it in an attempt to make the man beside him relax. " I know you are, I am too... But we'll make it, we always do."
“John, no I haven't been talking to her. Yes, she's been texting me now and again. No, I don't intend to answer, or for that matter, even look at her text.” All of this was delivered in a tired drawl accompanied by lazy gestures of one hand.
Sherlock felt his breath hitch.
“Just calm down, Sherlock.”
“I'm being serious, Sherlock. You can't run away from your feelings forever.” This made Sherlock stop dead in his tracks. He turned slowly towards John.
Sherlock could feel the receptionist's gaze bore into his back so he let the issue go for now.
“Of course I knew,” Sherlock answered softly. He was looking down at John with an exasperated but fond expression.
John had to do something. He couldn't just stare at Sherlock while the man was having an existential crisis. Maybe he could say something? Actually express what he was thinking in stead of just stating the fact that he saw Sherlock as Rosie's other Dad.
“Thank you.” She turned to the phone again. “He says his name is Sherlock Holmes. Says he's here to discuss the murder of Ragnar with you.” Another pause as she listened for a reply. Her eyebrows drew together and she frowned slightly. Oh, here we go. “He said you were expecting him.” There's that tone. Confusion. They were so going to get kicked out. “He sounded very sure of himself.” John tightened his grip on Rosie's stroller. “Listen, yes, alright. I'll send them in.” Another pause, almost like she got interrupted. John took a deep breath, steeling himself for the inevitable. “Yes, sorry, there are two men. Didn't I say so? Anyway, there are two British men standing here, I think, with a baby in a stroller”. She was smiling now so perhaps their situation wasn't as dire as he thought. “No, I'm not kidding. I'm going to send them in now. Bye bye.” She finally hung up.
But Sherlock kept giggling and wheezing. Then he grabbed John's head with both hands and spun him so he faced a... Penis Museum.
There. He was calm. Relatively.
as they say,” Sherlock chastised him.
“I expect you both be alive and well by the time I come back, and you and I,” he pointed at Sherlock, “are going to sort out this relationship, because that's what it is now, isn't it? A proper relationship.”
“Daddy!” She flung herself into his arms with enough force for him to make a soft 'uhmpf' sound.
His eyes are sparkling now. Moisture. He's moved by my words. This is a good sign, I think.
Rosie was screaming her lungs out and John was struggling with the straps of her high chair when Sherlock stumbled into the kitchen bleary eyed and dishevelled.
Rosie burst into manic giggles, and John laughed fondly at Sherlock's side.
“When did you get this?”
Then, inexplicably, they were kissing.
“Conductor of light.”
of September, 2015.”
“Sherl-, god damn it. Why don't you just-”, John gave himself a moment to arrange his thoughts. “Why are you so determined to be alone?”.
“Look, what I'm trying to say is that... I don't mind not dating other people if that means I can spend the rest of my life with you. And Rosie of course.”
“You're a romantic, John,” Sherlock said. “You will eventually find some woman, get married again, and move away to raise Rosie with her, obviously.”
“Sherlock,” John strolled passed where he was sitting at the kitchen table and opened the refrigerator to find a squeeze pouch for Rosie, “I've only been back here, for what? Three weeks? And I just started working again, right after Rosie's birthday, which was only a month and a half ago, or have you forgotten?” He sat Rosie down in her high-chair and passed her the open squeeze pouch.
Sherlock looked him in the eye and nodded. Alright, so those terms were acceptable to him, then. John took a deep breath. He knew what he was going to say next might spark an argument, but it had to be said.
I gently place my arm on the table between us and turn it over so the inside faces the ceiling.
The words. Again they just came out. Unbid.“'Notherwoman, er, I mean.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “What if you meet another woman?”
“Sorry, bad joke. Didn't mean to-, uh, Sherlock?”
The moisture in John's eyes has gathered together into tears, and one falls now. It lands on his cheekbone and starts its descent down his face. It's drawn to his lips and I watch as it slips into the creek of his mouth.
“No, John, I need to understand. What you're saying is important, and I absolutely need to understand so I don't assume-, well, anything.” Sherlock seemed a bit hesitant, a bit awkward. That was new. He was normally so well spoken, so well put together. John frowned.
“Yes, it has.”
Sherlock snapped out of his protracted state, turned on the spot, and grabbed John by the armpit. “Quite right,” he proclaimed and marched them out of the house.
“You've raised your concerns, quite clearly. Thank you for that, but it's time for me to state my opinion, don't you think?” John was still talking in his soothing doctorly voice, and Sherlock nodded for him to continue. “I think-, yeah, I think we should've talked about this some time ago. Probably around the time Rosie started talking, to be honest.”
“Look, Sherlock-”
“John, if I want to take you and Rosie on holiday, you know you needn't worry about the cost. Also,” his voice softened, “I thought it might be nice to go away together. We haven't done that since Baskerville, and this time we'd be going as a-, uh, you know...” When John just looked on uncomprehending, he sighed and finished. “As a family.”
“It's not a big deal. The 'Daddy' thing. Really, it's not. Sherlock-,” John was saying, but Sherlock cut him off, because of course
I feel the need to divulge. I don't understand why, but I'm not afraid any more. Well, 68% less afraid.
“How can I leave my daughter's father?” John asked, his voice strong and his jaw set, and looked straight up into Sherlock's eyes.
Now what?
Yes, believe it or not, The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police Station is within spitting distance from a museum dedicated to penises.
“Yes, thank you Mrs. Hudson. You're a life-saver.” John gave her a sincere smile and a nod. “And the fancy legos?”
Sherlock closed his eyes. He'd rather not look at John's face as he confessed.
“Oh, sorry, John. I thought we were stating random facts that have nothing to do with the conversation that I tried instigating a minute ago,” Sherlock stated with a dramatic eye-roll before steadying his gaze on John. “I asked you where you'd like to go”.
” John had absolutely no idea if that was a general greeting or perhaps someone's name. “
He huffs at this; he's aware of my tactics. He knows me too well by now.
Sherlock said nothing. John felt awkward.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock stated with considerable authority in his voice; a trick he must've picked up from Mycroft.
Rosie, as she alone could, disrupted their moment by giggling loudly and flinging her plate across the table. They both turned to her, and John could see the side of Sherlock's mouth curl upwards.
“I know this case is troubling both you and the rest of your team. It's been two days since the murder occurred and at least four members of your department are not getting enough sleep. The only ones seeming in high spirits are the short blond haired woman at the desk by the window, and the ginger man in the glasses. However, that is only due to the fact that they recently started sleeping with each other.” Sherlock paused briefly for effect.
“Not really.”
“I, ah- I'm not, I mean I didn't-”
John was silent. Sherlock wasn't. He could hear his own ragged breathing. He gulped air into his lungs, expanded them so far he felt like bursting, then just held it. Fifty four seconds later, Sherlock released the breath he'd been holding with a long whoosh sound. John took it as a sign, apparently.
John's head jerked up to look at Sherlock who was frowning at him. There it was. Sherlock denying John's own feelings, like he'd be mistaken to fall for that lanky git.
“You've explained your reasons and I've learned to forgive, but-”
Sherlock wasn't having it, apparently.
“I still don't understand how that relates to our current issue, Rose.” Sherlock said with his no-nonsense-this-is-serious voice. Rosie rolled her eyes at him and swallowed.
“Rosie,” Sherlock started, and she swiftly looked up at him because she knew that whenever he used her name, he meant business. “Why are you calling me 'Daddy'?”
“Yes, my conductor of light.”
He tipped on his toes and slowly, oh so slowly, brought his lips to Sherlock's.
“Of course I'm serious,” Sherlock retorted. “I'm a detective who consults, and frankly you are in dire need of consulting because your complete lack of-”
“Oh, yes. I've put them on the coffee table, safe and sound. I don't understand why you insist on calling them fancy, when it's just a pirate set, but-”
“Sherlock?”
Why is he doing this? It's not like him to talk about this. It's just one of the changes my absence has caused.
“Sher-,” John turned to him but he was already walking towards the stairs with their luggage in tow. John shook his head. “Never mind him, he's always like that.” With a final nod at the clerk, John followed suit.
Soon the moment passed and Sherlock pulled out his phone.“Time for lunch, I gather? Then crime scene!” A manic grin stretched across his face. Back to normal, then. Sort of.
Sherlock was standing now, staring down at John in both disbelief and irritation. John looked up at him, almost blinded by his beauty, as Sherlock gestured wildly with his arms. He was clearly distressed.
John folded his arms and looked at Sherlock who was sprawled on the sofa in his impeccable suit.
“What he means to say is that he is a Consulting Detective and would like to offer his services to your department.”
It was soft, delicious, and monumental. John's lips were dry and warm against his, and his cheek had just that bit of stubble underneath Sherlock's palm. Sherlock felt like he was cocooned in the navel of the universe and nothing could ever get better than this. Then John nibbled at Sherlock's bottom lip and the kiss took a sharp left turn into sensual territory. Sherlock could hear himself groan and he could definitely feel his face flush. John was gripping his elbow with one hand, while the other was crawling down Sherlock's back. When it found it's target, it grasped and squeezed, and Sherlock had to stop kissing John to pant instead in his mouth.
The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police Department was quite different from NSY. It wasn't bustling with activity like what John was used to. There was a front desk with a bored looking officer sitting behind it. As John and Sherlock approached, she looked up and smiled at them.
“What do you mean 'especially now'?”
waltz all over the place when we're trying to do our jobs. Thank you for a great story to share with my colleagues but now I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.”
I'm slightly alarmed now, so I shrug as a response because John hasn't said anything else.
“I like watching you two interact. I like the way you talk to her, and I like having another adult around to help out with parenting duties.”
“Eat some of this, please,” John commanded as he set a plate in front of Sherlock.
“Rosie and I, that is- and this is hard to say, and I don't know why because I know it to be true, but-” John took a deep breath, willing his tongue and vocal cords to carry him all the way through. “What I'm saying is that we love you,” John faltered slightly but rushed ahead anyway. “And we're not leaving, ever, I think.”
Sherlock simply ignored him and continued raking his eyes across the scene with his usual intense focus. There was blood seemingly everywhere. Splatters on the sofa, ceiling, walls, floor, and very prominently on the corner of the sturdy coffee table.
“What?” John stared unseeing at his best friend and wondered if this was in fact a nightmare.
. Then another crawling step. He feels humiliated, but is that John’s intention? Hadn’t he eavesdropped knowing it was wrong? He’d been curious and anxious. Another hand, another knee. It’s not so bad. It will make John happy, it will earn him forgiveness. The thought comes to him with the next embarrassing slide of his knee across the floor: maybe it’s not just about making John happy. Maybe it is to help him remember. He wants to trust him. He doesn’t want to be disrespectful. He doesn’t want to make John angry or disappoint him.
“That was so nice of you, er, Wiggy,” Molly says. “I’m glad Sherlock had someone to lean on, I’m sure it was awful.”
. Scared? Of what?”
And then they hear Martin approaching. “How does it look, John? Does he need a belt?”
Moriarty nodded thoughtfully. “Two in first class, four in business class, two from the main cabin, plus the one flight attendant. Nine total, I can work with that.”
. If there’s anyone in the Universe besides John who will really listen to him, it’s Molly. He lets go of her hands, which are still grasping his shirt. She pulls it up slowly, peeks underneath, and her eyes grow wide. She stares for a moment, then looks up at his blushing face.
“I know because I observe.”
But on this Saturday, the shop was empty. There was a big horse show going on at the Franklin County fairgrounds all weekend, most likely the horsey people were there. Rod's had a booth, and the other employees were there now, leaving Sherlock alone for the morning.
Sherlock reaches out as if to take the binder back. He stammers. “I mean, it may not work because—”
“Hey Scotsman, I want summa that, you sharing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He opened his eyes, his lips in a tight thin line, and shook his head.
Week one is not starting off well. John catches Sherlock in a lie, and he endures the homophobia of his classmates and his own father.
The rest of his shift had been a blur. He couldn’t rid himself of the memory of John’s eyes staring into his, reaching deep inside him, to a place Sherlock never permitted anyone to enter.
“One what?”
During those two days, they reminisced a little about Camp Kanawha, but John always steered the conversation back to the present. Sherlock guessed he didn’t want to bring up the painful topics of Eurus or his mother or that John had thrown away all of Sherlock’s letters. Letters that he had poured his heart and soul into. Letters that were desperate pleas for help. Sherlock let this go. They would need to talk more about it at some point, but not now when he only had John for a few hours a day.
“Mycroft told me about what happened back in seventy-eight. About Eurus.”
“It was important to
“Low blood sugar is at least part of it. Do you ever eat?”
“Star jumps, you mean? Of course, love. You don’t stand a chance, anyway. Two minutes on the clock. Let’s go.”
Sherlock has to keep himself from wriggling with pleasure. “Thanks. I’m pretty proud myself. Oh! And Ms. Hudson, my chem teacher? She got me a scholarship, it’s not very big or anything, but I didn’t even know she was trying.”
John takes a deep breath and rubs the bridge of his nose with the heel of his hand.
“And?”
“Thank you, again,” he said simply.
Sherlock makes a face and continues. “Anyway, I knew that wouldn’t prove anything, but it was one hell of a coincidence. And why would she choose something so obvious? I called Myc and told him about it. He told me that it’s quite common for criminals to use aliases that have some connection with their own identity. It’s some weird flaw in human nature. It would be so much smarter to just pick some random name out of the phone book. People are idiots.”
“What the heck is that?”
John gives him a half-smile. “Clever boy. Take the crop off the mantel and leave it on the chair. Outside the bedroom.”
Sherlock says nothing but looks at them darkly. A little of the joy slips away, the cocoon of positive energy that had enveloped him today breached by these unwelcome intruders. It reminds him of high school, of his dad’s hurtful words at graduation, and suddenly he is furious that these morons are ruining his day. He clenches his fist as the tightness builds in his chest.
This summer has been transformational for both of them. When he had bought the riding crop back in May, he had been looking for distraction—a sub for the summer, albeit one he intended to leave better off than he’d found him. It has been a very long time since he has been in love, and he never expected the tall, skinny kid in the tack shop to not only steal his heart but to fill it so completely.
“Yeah, that’s kind of the idea,” John replied through clenched teeth.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and drops down, pulling her onto the grass with him. “Sit.” They sit cross-legged beside each other. Sitting tightens the strap running between his legs and he shifts, trying to get comfortable, while Molly watches intently.
Sherlock wrinkles up his forehead. “Sorry, what are you talking about, one of the labs?”
Sherlock continues to step backward, away from the train wreck in front of him as people rush down the aisles, flocking to see the melee.
“It was a group effort,” John replied.
“Good morning!” John says as he emerges from the bedroom. He’s fresh from the shower and his hair is still wet. He’s walking a bit strange, as if he has a pulled muscle...or something.
John, out of town for emergency surgery, learns of Sherlock's arrest.
“Hope you enjoyed your stay,” John muttered sarcastically under his breath.
“I’ll be damned,” mutters Greg under his breath.
“I never stopped knowing you, John. And I’ve seen what kind of man you are these past few days. You are
When they were all together, he spoke in a low voice. “If there’s anything that we don’t want heard, we whisper, or we write. I’ll keep the notebook and marker.” Anderson narrowed his eyes. “Maybe I want to keep them.”
He feels John begin to pull out, perhaps thinking it’s too much and that Sherlock has changed his mind, but he moves back against John’s hips and resumes their rhythm.
“I miss you too, Mary.”
“It’s dumb. I don’t know why I haven’t learned yet.”
“Eleven, thank you, Sir. Twelve, thank you, Sir.” Sherlock’s elbows unlock and it’s only John’s quick grab around his waist that keeps him from collapsing to his knees.
“Listen!”
John shakes his head again. “You,” he says. “You are…” He pauses, searching for the word he wants.
“I’m telling you, he’s not—”
John smiles broadly and takes Sherlock’s cheeks in his hands and kisses him sweetly. “And you’ve been a very good boy, haven’t you?”
It feels as good as he remembers.
Less than a year later, Victor was dead.
Sherlock goes to the foyer table and brings it back. He turns around and pauses for a moment, wondering if he should kneel.
“Is Pete available?”
of the bottle and feels a hand on his ass-cheek and then a little tap.
my birthday, you know."
The revolving doors swish, depositing the older Holmes on the sidewalk, where he stands slumped for a moment and swipes the back of one hand across his eyes. Then, without a backward glance, he disappears from sight. John puts his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s eyes keep drifting back to the mantel. “Um, do you have anything...to drink,” Sherlock asks, wanting something to take the edge off.
“You better…”
“No, it’s an old scar; I’ll tell you about it sometime.”
“I told you. It could be the beginning of some kind of relationship. I’ve been quite honest. I want your obedience. I want you to submit to me, to give yourself over to me; to let me use you how I see fit—within your limits. I’d like to start finding out what those limits might be. Do you understand that?” John asks, placing a finger underneath Sherlock’s chin and lifting it so that Sherlock is looking into his eyes.
different, Sherlock. You are unique. It’s your gift.”
John couldn't believe what he was hearing, and, abandoning his effort to keep his temper under control, began to yell.
Backtracking, he took the other corridor. It was shorter than the other and ended in another locked door, but it had a conventional lock, not a keypad. The door had a small, barred window, but it was too dark inside to see anything. John tried each of the keys on the ring in turn and finally found one that fit the lock. It clicked, and the sound echoed in the stillness. Slowly, he turned the knob, holding the gun at the ready and trying to regulate his breathing. His heart thudded against his chest, and every fibre of his body was on high alert.
“I’m going to fly one of those someday, or maybe a spaceship,” the younger boy said matter-of-factly.
“Yes, Sir. Nothing, Sir.”
“Ah, good. Could you call him? Ask him to head over here? Not a real emergency. Just in case.”
This short response isn’t like the normally effusive Molly.
John opened his book and looked at the words, but he was thinking of that summer. His home life had been rough. He fought with his parents, and his parents fought with each other. It was exhausting. He had been accepted to Edinburgh for pre-med, and he couldn’t get there fast enough, although it meant leaving fourteen-year-old Harriet alone in that miserable place. He still felt guilty about it. If he had been around, things might have gone better for her. Harry had run away from home the year after and got mixed up with a bad lot.
“Your sister?”
The simplest one he could remember was the box technique. The Navy SEALS used it. Couldn’t be wishy-washy bullshit pseudoscience if the SEALS used it, right?
As his foot touches the ground, he groans and says, “I’m supposed to walk around with this all day?”
“I want to talk about something.”
John laughs and says. “Thank
Sherlock looks up at him shyly. “Really?”
It's graduation day and it will be memorable for all the wrong reasons.
John’s tongue goes to work, circling Sherlock’s rim, nipping around the edges, and then dipping inside. Somewhere in the middle of the overwhelming sensations, Sherlock remembers that he had objections to this and scoffs at his own ignorance. The only thing that could be better is—
“You think it was my supplier who set him up.” Pete takes out a pack of Marlboros and lights one. The smoke drifts by and Sherlock inhales. It smells good, and it’s on the tip of his tongue to ask for one, a reflexive response.
John combs his fingers through his tangled curls and kisses his forehead. He whispers, “Sweet boy,” but doesn’t answer the question and Sherlock pouts. “Soon. I promise.” John keeps petting and murmuring to him, and it feels so good, Sherlock decides to let it go. He realizes he must have dozed off because the next thing he knows, there’s a wet cloth rubbing the drying come off his chest.
“John, calm down, he came to apologise to you.”
“The glue that held our family together was gone. Our father never forgave Sherlock for taking his baby, and I’m quite sure Sherlock has never forgiven himself. There were many tears, many fights in our house that summer. I was grateful to be going back to college in the fall. By the end of August, our Dad had left. Just disappeared. We woke up one morning, and he was gone. Our mother tried to keep going, but she took her own life in the end.”
"Somebody cancelled. What have you been up to today?" John tried hard to keep the accusation out of his voice. He wanted to know if Sherlock would tell him the truth on his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m scared!” She wailed. “I want my mum!” And when she saw the dead man on the floor, she shrieked.
“Oh, I hate him!” she wails.
“Yes.”

“He’s been well trained, but yeah, he's pretty easy.”
Sherlock shakes his head.
“I kind of got that.”
“I did think you weren’t coming for me. That you knew and you believed them and you—” He chokes back a sob and continues.“And I felt like I was sick, not thinking straight. It all seemed so hopeless. The doctor there said it might be sub drop. Sir, it was awful.”
“No, everything feels fine. A little stiff, maybe.”
Sherlock gets off the bus and walks down the dark street toward the small white Cape Cod house with green shutters where he has lived his entire life. He wonders if his dad will be home. Since his mother died, when Sherlock was thirteen, it was hit or miss whether his father would be home at any given time, and if he would be sober if he were.
SH:    OK, I will. ttyl
“Nothing, Sir.”
, Ms. Hudson and her wife Marie. He remembers what Ms. Hudson said about herself growing up and decides that he might need to keep an open mind as much as anybody else.
“It is,” replied Sherlock. “And when you eliminate the impossible, whatever is left must be the truth.”
John scanned the room where he and the hostages had been imprisoned, taking stock of their situation. After they’d been herded from the plane with hoods over their heads, he had listened; he had sniffed the air. It didn’t tell him anything. There was nothing distinctive, no chemical smells, no sounds other than crickets and birds. There had been descending steps, eighteen of them, so they might be in a basement.
“Mmm?”
Dinner in the hospital cafeteria is hardly romantic, or anything like what Sherlock had hoped would happen tonight, but just being with John is good. He’s wearing a lab coat over his scrubs and looks tired, with the beginnings of bags under his eyes, but he seems genuinely happy to be with him.
“It doesn’t matter. I just want to listen to your voice.”
JW:      LOL again. But still no excuse. :)
“I think this one will fit him with just minor alterations. Go, take him to try it on.”
John looks pleased and squeezes his fingers.
John shrugged. “Possibly.”
Sherlock looks into John’s blue eyes. There is concern and kindness in them. The only reason he wants to be untied is so that he can wrap his arms around John, hold him tight and never let go. John had stopped when Sherlock said “red” and didn’t seem disappointed in him. “No, Sir, I’m better now. I trust you. Green.”
“Use your colors.”
“I was just kidding,” Wiggy says, surprised. “I don’t wanna get you in hot water.”
Sherlock is speechless. John knows what a fuck-up he is, he knows about the drugs. He probably knows how Sherlock has been paying for them, and he’s trying to get him a job at the hospital? Is he insane?
"I believe you," Sherlock said.
“I know what it means Sherlock, I saw the movie.”
Sherlock steeples his fingers under his chin and thinks for a moment. “If my big brother can bring down the hammer, he can lift it up. I’ll call him tonight. And I’ll have to clear it with John, but I’m sure he’ll agree. So, Wig, you up for a visit to the Scholar tomorrow?”
“Why would he talk to Sherlock?” Molly says. “Sounds like he would be on Pete’s shit-list at the moment.”
Sherlock pauses, embarrassed, before responding.
Sherlock quickly says, “Sir! Because I lied, Sir.”
“Come here.”
“John…” Sherlock hesitated.
“No, you weren’t. You were having a sexual fantasy.”
Playing this song brings back happy memories. His mom always teased him that the blackbird was his “spirit animal” and told him that the blackbird totem represented knowledge, intelligence, and quick wit. He didn’t believe in such nonsense as spirit animals, and she knew it. It was their little joke. He closes his eyes and pictures her face as he sings.
“It was.”
“William Wiggins at your service. Everybody calls me Wig.” He looks to the side, a little embarrassed. “Wiggy sometimes.”
“I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this, but on we go,” Moriarty said, snapping his fingers. The bald guard handed him a black velvet drawstring bag. Moriarty shook the bag and held it up so that everyone could see it.
“Hello,” John said.
“That little shit!”
Sherlock walks through the door at five forty-five. Clever boy, but not clever enough. John lets him converse with Angelo momentarily, then rises to stand, at parade rest, beside their table. Sherlock’s eyes dart around the room, seeking and when they finally meet his, there it is again, that pink flush rising from his neck, revealed thanks to the open buttons of his purple shirt. Gorgeous. He watches him point, indicating to Angelo that his party is already here. Angelo smiles knowingly, and the blush rises to the tips of Sherlock’s ears. John walks around the table and pulls out the chair for him to sit.
“Savings bonds,” John says. “You buy them—like an investment. They earn interest over time, and you can cash them in at the bank when you want to use the money. Did you add them up?”
“And anytime you want to stop, we stop. Use your colors.”
“Don’t tell me you’re ticklish too?”
“It is. I feel like I owe him.”
When he turned the bag over, something made of black leather tumbled out. He picked it up, knitting his brows. Underwear, but not like any he’d ever worn. An inch-wide strip of leather
She has watched the exchanges between them with great interest. “Don’t worry, Sherlock,” Annie says. “There’s not really all that much to tell. Johnny and I have evolved together. We’re good friends with history, that’s all. I can tell you that you are a very lucky man and you should hear how he talks about you.” She winks conspiratorially. “You and I should talk later. Compare notes.” She smiles again. As much as he wants to hate her, he’s finding it impossible, and he smiles back.
John waits as Sherlock goes to the bathroom and kitchen and comes back with an armload of supplies.
“Go pee. I’ll be right back.”
John slides his hand over Sherlock’s burning ass before easing him gently off his lap. He crumples, but when his heels hit his abused skin he rises quickly to his knees, gasping from the pain and the sensation of the plug moving inside him. John takes him in his arms, pulls him close, and kisses his temple. “You’re forgiven now, let it go.”
Sherlock whimpers. His foot is sliding back and forth on the carpet, and he has to grit his teeth to resist reaching back to rub out the intensity of the bite. “Ow, ow, ow.” His voice is far squeakier than he would like. John waits until Sherlock composes himself and stands still again. John puts his shoulder into number six, and there is a sob in Sherlock’s voice as he counts.
“I don’t wanna stay here.” Sherlock looks at Mycroft, eyes wide, then John, imploringly.
In his mind, Sherlock pictures a black leather crop, wielded by this man, tracing up his thigh, over his hip gently, before being raised and falling hard with a loud “whack” across his bare buttocks, sending delicious reverberations of pain through his flesh. Sherlock draws in a little gasp of air, and the man looks over at him, studies him for a moment, then smirks. His dark blue eyes fix on Sherlock's lighter ones, and Sherlock feels his stomach flip.
She bats her eyes at him and says, “I’ll be good, I promise.”
“How long have you been divorced?”
good, Wiggy. We have our Sherlock back because of your help.” Molly places a hand on Wiggy’s arm, and he blushes, then turns to Sherlock.
Sherlock freezes then turns to look at John over his shoulder. The smile is gone.
John is waiting for him, seated on a low-backed wooden chair, still dressed. Sherlock closes the door behind him and stands there, not sure what to do or where to put his hands. John solves the problem by holding out his hand and saying, “Come, beautiful boy, I want you to kneel here in front of me.” When Sherlock reaches him, John points to the carpet, and Sherlock folds himself down so he’s sitting on his heels, his feet stretched flat. “That’s it. Now, hands behind your back and take hold of your elbows. Like that.”
He tells her about a lot of it, about the clinic visit and the tailor, just enough about the sex that she knows they’re having it, and doesn’t go anywhere near the
“But you acted like a child. Not as an adult who’s in an adult relationship.”
Sherlock asks about “sexual behavior,”
“A date?” John supplied, noticing with some amusement the blush that had risen on Sherlock’s cheeks.
“Two thirty.”
“You awake, Sherlock?”
“Yes, Sir,” Sherlock whispers back.
John glanced at the walls, but there were no light switches to be seen. Then he had an idea. Walking to the middle of the room, he spoke loudly.
“You did it? I thought it was the EMTs.”
“I second it,” Stamford said.
“What’s in that bloke’s head that’s so important?”
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, I’m sure I locked it, even though I didn’t have anything worth stealing in it. It’s policy. And I didn’t tell anyone my combination. It’s a four-digit combination making the odds of someone guessing it one out of ten thousand.”
“Good boy, I don’t either. So, how was it and when is the next exam?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You. Home. Now.” he growled.
“Yes, Sir. And I think that having you there to…um…make sure I do stuff. You know…give me…consequences, will help.”
“I wasn’t so sure myself. But there it is.” He shows it to her. “And Hudders got me a scholarship. Just a small one.” He looks down and blushes.
Sherlock nods and John says, “Good boy. Give me your hand.” John squeezes more of the green gel onto Sherlock’s palm, then guides him to his penis and closes his fingers around it. “Won’t take long. I’m halfway there just watching you, you sexy thing.” Together, they move up and down, Sherlock responding to John’s motions, and climbing so that he is straddling John’s thighs. He looks down at his hand, sliding over John’s beautiful cock, while his own throbs and dribbles. Maybe John will fuck him. If he’s not going to be allowed to come, the pleasure of feeling John’s climax inside him would give him at least a sliver of satisfaction. He starts to ask.
Martha had risen and was holding Molly’s shoulders. She, too, was staring at the gasping man.
********
John continues tying and Sherlock is vaguely aware of Annie’s instructions, John’s questions, and the bantering between them. It all blurs together for him in a haze of comfort and peace. He’s being tied. Immobilized. He will look like one of those happy people in the photos. It’s like a tight hug. But he doesn’t like hugs, does he? He starts to feel confused, so he dismisses the inner voice that is pointing out the contradiction. All he has to do is exactly what they tell him. Stand up straight. Try to tug your wrists apart. Wiggle your fingers. He’s trying. But he’s also beginning to float. He’s going to the floating place. It’s like smack. For the moment he has no responsibilities, no one to worry about, no plans he has to make for the future. He’s safe, with people who care about him. From far away he hears someone calling him and hands on his shoulders spin him around. He frowns. Then there’s a sharp pinch on his nipple, and his eyes fly open.
However anxious he was to have a new and exciting case, he was not about to go begging to Scotland Yard. As a consulting detective--correction,
“He’s my favorite,” Wiggy says. “And Black Widow too...she could save me any day. Damn, she’s hot! I don’t like Dr. Strange so much. English dude plays him—Benedict Cummerbunch or something. They shoulda cast an American. His accent is shit.” Wiggy shakes his head ruefully as if the actor’s imperfect accent were a tragedy and downs the remainder of his beer.
“That was horrible.”
whether people knowing will bother you. And if you say yes, I think it’s important for you to have a grounding event or some kind of celebration. You were kind of cheated out of your graduation.”
Greg nods, and they exit the car. When Sherlock steps onto the sidewalk, John takes his hand. He feels a little thrill but also apprehension.
“Yes, yes, god, yes.”
“Yeah.”
“You want to bail him out?”
Sherlock lets out a sigh and closes his eyes. When they open again, he sees John staring at him. John’s left hand cradles the top of his head and the other rests on his stomach, his thumb rubbing circles there.
“I know it,” she replied, laughing. “You’ll call me when you get there?”
“Is that all?”
“I’m not an addict! I’m not! I’ve used, but…wait, where would he even get that idea? How would he know? Mycroft made sure
“Slow down—one at a time. Harvey Milk was the first openly gay elected official in California, and he was assassinated in 1978. The high school is for LGBTQ students who can’t go to regular high school because of harassment or persecution. It’s Giacomo Puccini’s opera, Turandot. In my personal opinion, the Italian operas are the most beautiful, the best for a new listener, and Turandot has what is considered the most beautiful aria, solo really, Nessun Dorma. It will be in Italian. I learned Italian so I could understand opera, but nowadays, there are English translations projected around the stage, but you could also read the libretto, the script, beforehand so you have a general idea of what’s going to happen.” John sounds more eager as he continues.
. I updated you. All your voice memos and photos are backed up to the cloud. Immediately. You could throw that phone in the Scioto, and it wouldn’t matter.”  Sherlock’s eyes are sparkling, and he is grinning so widely that his normally smooth face is full of crinkles. Adorable crinkles. To see him so happy makes every painful throb in John’s head and arm worthwhile.
He takes a minute to think about the past Saturday, watching the sunset, being curled up next to John in bed, ass still hot and burning from the paddling, and warmth spreads through him, not helping the wood between his legs. He’d wanted to spend the night, but John had driven him home. He’d been feeling a little fuzzy and was glad that John had done it himself instead of sending him off with the nameless driver.
“Hey! Someone’s been in my bag! My pencils are gone!”
“But why?”
He’s a little shocked, but he can’t help the shudder that runs through him. “Sorry, but it’s disgusting!”
She traces the inside of his bicep. “The nerves under the skin here are very close to the surface and with a bit of fat, you wouldn’t have to worry about pinching them quite as much, but he’s at risk. I’m going to send you a couple of sites that will highlight the nerve maps, so you’ll know where to check. And in the meantime, don’t go tight as you can. A finger’s worth of stretch. And stick to nylon until he gets more experience. It’ll give you a little wiggle room. Well, him. Do you think he’ll be a struggler?”
“You’re having a panic attack,” John soothed. “I know one when I see one. I’ve had plenty myself. Try to breathe. Is it the turbulence?”
He squints at it. Eight o’clock. He remembers that he’s promised to meet John at Greenfield’s Clothiers at nine thirty to pick up his suit. Stretching and yawning, he doesn’t even begin to reach for his erection.
Sensing Sherlock’s distress, John squeezes his hand. “Sherlock, ignore them. They don’t matter, they’re idiots, not worth your anger.” As he’s saying this a large group of men in lavender shirts with “CGMC” on the front converge on the protesters and circle them. They begin to sing loudly, drowning out the man with the bullhorn. Their voices are rich and beautiful.
Wiggy has been on such a manic high, that Sherlock has let him roll on, but the mention of Pete snaps him to attention.
“Fiancée. Would you like a biscuit?” John said, offering the bag to Sherlock. “They’re oatmeal.”
“I know. He’s just…I don’t know; he’s just so damn…sanctimonious!”
“Sherlock, you know it’s not unusual, right? Gay marriage is legal here. You could be married someday.”
And he has delivered Sherlock right into her hands.
“All kinds, I guess. My parents listened to country, so I know a lot of that. I like rock and blues, mostly. Old stuff...Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Jimi Hendrix.
“Afraid so, sweet boy. You know, some people actually enjoy wearing plugs. They wouldn’t consider it a punishment at all.”
“I know, be thorough,” Sherlock interrupts in a singsong voice. He gets a hefty swat for it and offers up his best pout, rubbing his ass. John reaches up and touches his protruding lower lip, then hooks his forefinger in the ring of the collar and pulls Sherlock back down until his ear is at John’s mouth. “Is that sass?” he hisses in a low voice. “If you think I won’t turn you over my knee right now, you’re mistaken. But then, you’d like that, wouldn’t you? So be my good boy and go take a shower...now.” The “now” is said with such quiet and commanding force, that when he releases the collar, Sherlock gets up with a meek “Yes, Sir” and does as he’s told.
Ms. Hudson looks at him with pursed lips and shakes her head. “For such a brilliant kid, you are an idiot.”
“I’m not—” Sherlock reconsiders immediately. “Sorry, I meant, yes, Sir.”
They kiss, there in the window, for all of the city to see. John is still wearing the kilt, but Sherlock is naked, mooning anyone who might be looking up.
“He sounds like a good brother. You are lucky.”
Sherlock’s pulse quickens.
Finally, he looks up. “It just seemed like a waste of time. I figured I’d end up being disappointed.”
Sherlock wants to ask about the other people John’s taken under his wing but doesn’t have the nerve.
“No,” John said. “Please take me to Massachusetts General Hospital.”
John is overcome by the feel of the boy’s silky smooth mouth working his cock.
Sherlock stands there feeling awkward and a little strange with the strap running between his legs, and suddenly an unwelcome thought comes to his mind.
Sherlock swallows hard and can think of no reply.
He takes a deep breath and wipes his eyes with the heel of his hand. “I love you, Sir.”
“Sorry to hear it. Sure you want to go to work?”
“Mycroft told you about our family, right?”
“No tickling, promise.” He scours every bit of skin, even between his toes, which does, actually, tickle a little, but also feels good, and repeats the action on his other foot. Satisfied with the job he’s done, John puts the sponge down and sprays away the suds.
a friend of mine. My name is Jim Moriarty, and if you can hear me, you are one of the lucky ones. The ones that didn’t partake of the most excellent Chicken Cordon Bleu or Blackened Salmon Salad. Can’t say I didn’t try, but as they say: You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink. Or eat. No matter. I just needed to thin the herd to a manageable number. If you are still alive, I need you to stay in your seat with your seatbelt securely fastened…and please shut up. Instructions will follow shortly.
But Molly isn’t deterred. Announcing “I want some pie!” she grabs Sherlock’s hand and pulls him toward the garden. He allows himself to be led away, looking back over his shoulder to see John, his back turned, in conversation with the leather-clad women.
“You mean, I may not see you?”
“Yes, Si...aaah!” Sherlock cries out as the plug begins to vibrate with intensity. His head falls back against the cushions as his back arches involuntarily. Just as he’s catching his breath, John’s hand closes around him, and there is nothing else; everything fades to blackness and only pleasure remains.
Yellow!”
“I don’t believe you.”
“You don’t know me anymore, Sherlock.”
John steps behind him and pushes his crotch against Sherlock’s ass and when he moans, grabs his hips again and grinds in a circle. Sherlock can feel the swelling under John’s pants and moves back against it. John doesn’t object, but puts his hands on Sherlock’s waist and runs them over his ribs until he reaches the strands of rope that separate his abdomen from his chest. He traces them back to the coil that binds Sherlock’s wrists together and grows like the spreading hood of a cobra. He follows the purple trails over his shoulders and stops to squeeze his trapezius muscles.
They get to their feet and follow her to the street where most of the guests are gathered, watching the parade go by. They join John who is on the sidewalk with Marie, Irene and Kate. They all have drinks in their hands. John offers his to Sherlock and he tastes it. Whiskey. He wonders why people like the burn. He takes a drink anyway.
Stamford had been shot, and that was the first thing that needed attending to.
John is behind him, hands ghosting over his abused flesh.
“You came. I thought... I thought you were done with me. I thought—”
“You should have seen us at Christmas,” he tells John. No matter how well our poor mother wrapped the gifts, we always guessed most of them. It was a kind of competition, wasn’t it Sherlock? Oh, and forget Santa Claus. Sherlock, how old were you when you figured that out?”
“Two. Thank you, Sir.”
and turns it over in his hands. “Looks old.” He flips it open and sees the slips of paper. He looks up at Sherlock in surprise.
“Excellent! I’m sure you must be thirsty. We have lemonade, iced tea, and some ginger ale punch. Which would you like?”
Sherlock groans. “Please, just don’t…”
under those trousers...And that it’s all mine. God, you fucking turn me on.” As John is saying this, his hand slips down and grips Sherlock’s erection through the fabric of his pants.
“Can I ask a
“Why did you…I mean, what did you...I’ve never done anything like this before. I don’t even know why I’m here.”
Sherlock had learned about the history of the term “queer” in his class. How some members of the LGTBQIA+ community have reclaimed it and often use it proudly, but for many, mostly older, people, those who experienced it used against them as a term of hate and bigotry, the word carries too much pain. He remembers how he felt at graduation when his dad called John a faggot and spit in his face; the soul-crushing combination of shame and anger that overwhelmed him and set in motion all that followed. What Martin must have endured, both as a Jew in Auschwitz and as a gay man in that era...he can’t even imagine.
“Jesus Christ,” John whispered.
ENGLISH 1110.01 First-Year English Composition
As the hostages were led past Magnussen’s body, John couldn’t help wishing that it had been Anderson whose number had been drawn. There was no blood in the hallway, no evidence at all of what had befallen Louise. And John was glad of this. He’d seen enough dead bodies to last a lifetime, and he didn’t need to see a dead child.
He shifts a little. “What?”
“How’s the good doctor treating you?”
“Right! The shadowers are supposed to stay in the background, take notes, stuff like that, but Jim couldn’t keep his mouth shut. It pissed John off, so he and Jim kinda weren’t getting along. At all. There were other things too, but nothing outrageous enough to get him kicked out of the program. Anyway, near the end of the summer, John overheard Jim talking to someone on the phone. John wasn’t trying to eavesdrop, but there was an intercom, and it just kind of happened.
“And that after I did, you’d have me lick it out of you.”
“Yes, Sir.”
“Yeah, OK, I’ll take one.” He turns to Wiggy and holds out his hand.
“John says you’re eighteen. I came to America when I was not much younger than you,” remarks the tailor. “I was just sixteen.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “It’s sooo hard,” he whines.
me to have you go. You don’t have to stay long. She’s been a friend to you, and she wants you there.”
“That’s about the closest we’ll get to a compliment,” Lestrade chuckled.
********
“What? How is that possible? Another thing to put on the list of things we’ll have to take care of when we get to London.”
John takes a seat on the other chair. “Rule number five, Sherlock, no self-criticism. If I tell you I’m enjoying your playing, the appropriate response is?”
Sherlock pockets the money and looks wistfully at the board. John said he might not punish him until they get to London. That seems like a long time away, even though it is, in fact, less than two weeks.
Myc looks around appreciatively at the expensively appointed space and doesn’t visibly react when he spots the riding crop still on the mantelpiece. “You must be an excellent surgeon.”
“Mrs Hudson, would you please fetch us some tea?” Sherlock requested.
MH: UR 2 skinny.
He wakes up Saturday to a quiet house and looks out of the living room window. The driveway is empty, as he was afraid it would be. Sherlock shuts his mind down against any more speculating and concentrates on the feel of John’s watch against his skin. He opens the door of his closet and lifts the plastic that’s draping his suit, to run his fingers over the shimmering fabric. He takes a deep breath and, out loud, says to himself, “It’s going to be a good day.”
Sherlock looked up at that, his eyes shining with both tears and alien beauty. John's heart clenched.
“That's not true, John.”
“Let's be very clear on this,” John said and looked straight into Sherlock's eyes. “Unless you have any objections, Rosie is 100% as much your daughter as she is mine. I'm not angry, and I'm not going to leave, okay? She can call you 'Daddy' if she wants, although that might get confusing. I'm not sure it's distinguishable enough from 'Dad', but we'll work it out. Just... I don't know, relax, please. I'm not leaving, and I know I'm repeating myself and you usually hate that, but I think I need to say it one more time just in case: I'm. Not. Leaving.” John's eyes were honest. And very blue. Indigo. Sherlock reckoned they might look positively purple, given the right lighting. He made a mental note to consult a gaffer on the matter.
John is looking at me like he knows what's going through my mind. He probably does. He's smarter than he looks, after all.
Why not?
a father. Except for Gladys, I guess, whose mother is single, but that's beside the point. She's
When John drew back to gaze at Sherlock with questioning eyes, Sherlock surged forwards to bring their lips together once again.
Sherlock finally stopped for breath. John gaped at him. “And now that we're actually talking about this, John, I might as well just go ahead and say this.” He took a deep breath. “John, I'm in love with you, and have been for a long time. I didn't say anything, because I was waiting for you to process and admit your own feelings towards me to yourself. Yes, I've been aware, and the waiting has been excruciating, John. I would've been able to hold out if you could've just shut up about Irene Adler for one sodding minute.”
According to Sherlock, Ragnar Jónsson had been an alcoholic and a drug addict. He had been in huge debt and had only recently fallen off the wagon after having been sober for at least 15 years. He had been unemployed at the time of death, but Sherlock reckoned he'd once had a high income job (not a complex deduction given the nice house and neighbourhood the man had inhabited). All of that had of course been evident by the wear on the furniture, the arrangement of the kitchen, and the odd placement of an ugly bust on the mantle.
“Hmmm'kay”, Sherlock mumbled as John pulled out his pocket light and checked his eyes. “I'm not high!” Sherlock spat indignantly.
Sherlock's expression of horror was priceless, and John chuckled quietly to himself and turned to pull out ingredients from the fridge. He kept an eye on Sherlock and Rosie, because honestly they were a sight to behold. Once John busied himself, Sherlock seemed to relax. He carefully cracked open the squeeze packet and handed it to an eager and giggling Rosie.
“Are you still with me?” Of course, John. John! Sherlock reminded himself he'd actually have to open his mouth to provide an audible answer.
“Excuse me?” Auðun was frowning and John felt the need to intervene.
“But... I... Jesus!” John was hyperventilating. This wasn't happening. This was impossible. This was-
At this, they both laughed.
Sherlock was breathing heavily, like he'd just run up the stairs or vaulted across rooftops. John was staring up at him. Shock. Yes, that's what John's face was expressing. Pure, unadulterated shock. Sherlock let himself sink back into the chair. He was starting to feel numb again.
It was that simple.
“John.” That was all he could say. Just 'John'. Pathetic.
Best Monday morning ever.
“We'd like to work with you on the investigation of the murder of Ragnar Jónsson,” Sherlock said, just as bluntly. John suppressed a sigh.
“Of course you do, I wasn't-,” John tried to say but Sherlock went on.
“Yes,” he managed. Barely.
“But-”
“Thank you.” She turned to the phone again. “
“Your partner is cheating on you with your brother,” Sherlock spat out at her and strode out the front doors.
Sherlock frowned down at his hands, unwilling to meet John's eyes. John couldn't believe what he was hearing. Sherlock was so wrong. He was so, so wrong. John wouldn't leave. He couldn't. There wasn't a woman, or even a person, on this earth that could replace Sherlock.
“I don't understand, John.”
he remembered. The issue. The 'Daddy' issue. The issue of Rosie thinking Sherlock was her father just like how John was her father. And now John was pretending it like it wasn't all that serious, like it wasn't a world-ending, earth-shattering, doomsday-prompting, humongously
“It was for comfort.”
“Leave his curls alone, darling,” John requested gently and tried prying Rosie's fingers out of Sherlock's hair.
“I know you don't like to talk about it, but I would very much appreciate you explain this to me in your own words. Just so I don't assume or misunderstand anything. Okay?”
Nothing could replace Sherlock. Absolutely nothing.
John was babbling and not making much sense. Divorce his work? Was that a pop culture reference Sherlock wasn't getting or, oh. Oh! 'Married to my work', he'd said that once. And John remembered! Why did John remember? 'Not a proposition,
“Yes, you are!”
“Istanbul.”
“What...”
His left hand crawls slowly through the air and his index and middle fingers touch down lightly on my wrist. My breath hitches and John's fingers inch forwards until they are resting against the middle of my forearm. On his words.
“I'm not going to find some woman to date because,” John stuttered. “Well, because of you, actually.”
Sherlock was suddenly aware that his breathing had quickened alarmingly and he was certainly in, what Ella described as, a panic attack. He could feel Rosie staring up at him, and he took great effort to regulate his breathing until he felt just a little bit calmer.
John shook his head, not sure he was reading the situation correctly. “Are you trying to tell me that you want us to go to
A blanket of silence was thrown over the office as Sherlock and Auðun simply glared at each other. John felt a little more uncomfortable than usual when it came to situations like this. Probably due to them being in a foreign country, for god's sake. He cleared his throat and sat in one of the chairs opposite Auðun's desk.
He pulls away and I open my eyes to look at him. I don't remember closing them in the first place, but the evidence tells me I must've done. He is so close. He is so beautiful.
Sherlock frowned a bit at that before pouting innocently. “I hear the natural hot springs can do wonders for the body.”
So I walked into an insignificant tattoo parlour at the edge of the city and asked for three small but infinitely significant words to be etched into my skin.
“Indeed, John.” Sherlock bent to inspect the coffee table. “This can't have been pleasant.”
“I'm not asking-, I mean,” John went on, interrupting Sherlock's thoughts. “Nothing has to change, you know. I'm not saying you have to divorce your work or anything. This is not a proposition, unless-, that is, of course you wouldn't. I'm just saying.”
