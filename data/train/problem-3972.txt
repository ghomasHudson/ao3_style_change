Dean squinted to where Cas was pointing, but couldn't find it. Cas noticed and took Dean's hand, pointing it in the right direction. The movement made the hunter lean closer to him and their shoulders brushed.
“Dean?”
“Technically,” Cas says, and he smiles shyly. “What do you think?”
“I’m not sure how,” Dean settled on. “I don’t really do the feelings thing.”
When Dean reaches over to get another pillow their thighs brush, and neither one pulls away. The movie starts, Episode IV, and as they settle in more comfortably they end up with their sides flush, and Dean gets goosebumps at the warmth that radiates from Cas.
As he was making his way to the back door, he saw light in one of the upstairs windows that faced the garden. So Cas was home after all. Did he not hear him?
"A date. You, and me?"
After over a year of absence from their father and Dean barely making enough money to keep the power running, Sam had convinced him to sell the house. They put their Dad’s stuff in storage, packed their clothes and personal belongings and hightailed out of the bad house in a rough neighborhood. Their new apartment was in walking distance to the high school, the auto shop Dean worked at part-time was about a ten minutes drive away and the university  not much further. Life was gonna be better from now on; Sam believed in it and Dean did too.
Dean shovels honey-crusted ham and mashed potatoes into his mouth and argues loudly with Charlie over their favorite Star Trek ships. He watches Cas start to eat out of the corner of his eye, and feels content.
Dean nodded and fed the fruit to him, before shoveling some more into his own mouth.
“I miss you too, Dean. What are you gonna do now? Are you staying with Cas?”
Hey guys!
“Can you close your eyes?”
“Today was exhausting,” he says. “I’m sorry, I really enjoy spending time with you, but I think I should get home soon.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas rasped and Dean had trouble understanding him. That dude really had a nasty cold.
Eileen sits down across from Dean, and Sam walks over with everything that had been on the grill. Cas nudges aside the vase filled with dark red dahlias to make space for the big serving plate, and soon they eat.
“On Wednesday,” Dean says, “I’m pretty sure you either had a massive panic attack, or—”
"How'd you like it?" Dean said after closing the laptop and nudging it away from them.
“Do you want me to pick you up? For the funeral, I mean,” Dean suggested and Gabe nodded.
Dean tried to give the woman his best shit-eating grin as she slapped down an envelope with a logo that read ‘VSI’ in the middle on his desk. She ignored him and returned to the front of the room.
“Offense taken,” Dean says as he watches Cas yawn again and his eyes water a little.
"Buddy, I want as many as you want to give."
“Sure,” Dean says. “Lead the way.”
Some fumbling ensues and Dean tears open the packet with his teeth.
Sam and Cas both have picture-perfect deer in headlights looks on their faces.
Or was he tired of him?
Dean yawns as he opens another package of napkins to stock up the counter. The warmth in the shop and the heavy smell of cinnamon and vanilla makes his eyes droop; he regrets staying up late to play board games with Charlie and Sam. It’s his first early shift in a week, and he hadn't missed the crankiness of their morning rush customers.
“Benny Lafitte, you’re going to help out at the soup kitchen at the homeless shelter. Any information you need for this will be in the envelope you’re all going to receive at the end of this. Abby will be joining the wildlife rescue group.”
Nausea punched him, and he could do little but lean to the side and try not to be sick all over himself.
"Hello?" Sam yelled when he found the motel room empty.
"Nothing dangerous. I promise. You're alive, we're okay, and that's all that matters."
His fingers move, following muscle and warm skin and sliding into soft hair, tangling there to hold on as he tilts his head, and with a gentle bump of their noses their lips find each other.
Dean opens his mouth to scream, but doesnt know if a single sound comes out. He sees Cas’ lips move, and Sam moves away. There’s a warm hand on his forehead, a soothing thumb stroke on his cheek, and everything becomes too much. The coldness of the floor seeping through his jacket, the painful throb in his head, Cas’ touches hitting him like lightning strikes where they appear suddenly.
The drive is long, but not too much so, and they'll arrive at night. Cas had picked out the motel, interested in the historical part of town they'll be staying in.
“Hello,” Cas says. “Am I interrupting something?”
"Dude.." Dean rubbed his wrist that now hurt a little, an adequate reaction to his moose of a brother practially laying on it. " What wash that for?"
Dean threw the third pair of pants in the floor. Every single pair he had picked up ended up looking ratty or had a surprise hole somewhere. He had one last hope, a dark wash pair he had worn to Sam's graduation.
"I have just the recipe for you then."
"Thank you," Cas said and Dean nudged his nose against his. "I can't believe... Dean, are you sure? I know I didn't tell you anything, but-"
Cas ordered waffles with fresh fruit and chocolate sauce, whereas Dean opted for savory pancakes with bacon and hashbrowns on the side. Dean inspected the menu for possible dessert options, finding their selection of ice cream flavors almost intimidating.
"I do." Dean met Ben's gaze with squared shoulders.
“Lock the door,” Cas says.
"Hello, Dean."
“We’re not married, Dean.” Cas tries and fails to pick up a microscopic piece of salmon, then gives up and just uses his fingers.
“I’ll call her later to see if she needs help,” Dean says. “Thanks guys. Let us know if you need anything besides grub and sleep.”
"Not really. My mom died when I was a kid. My dad died in a car crash a couple years ago, and my baby brother is away at college. We're not really close. Not anymore."
The printer whirred to life and spit out Dean’s timetable. Ben dated it and then handed it over.
“Because sometimes we just need someone to talk to, Dean. It doesn’t really matter who, but I figured since I’m still basically a stranger, it would be easier. And, I promise I'm less of an assbutt than I've been the past times, and I'm sorry that I was rude to you. Ben had forgotten to let me know there would be a change in our usual routine, and I was caught off guard."
Cas finished his breakfast and put the empty wrappers and small containers back into the bag, then he swung his legs to the side to get up and reach for another bottle of water. Wincing, he placed his feet on the ground and got up, but a sudden pain from his leg made him stumble and fall down.
"Ugh, please," Dean says, and hurries to continue as Cas' face falls. "You moved in months ago. I keep finding new plants everywhere. Where are they even coming from?"
He hollowed his cheeks and gave it his all, his one hand twisting on every upstroke that ended where his lips began, his other at Cas's balls. Deepthroating was not (yet) on his list of acquired skills, but he tried to make up for it by letting the head of Cas's cock catch against the roof of his mouth while he pressed his tongue to the vein running on the underside of it. He pulled back and sucked the head, happy to taste everything he could, the salty proof of his arousal a heavenly combination with the weight of him in Dean's mouth.
Dean snorts as he holds open the bunker's front door for Cas, who waits awkwardly before he seems to realize Dean is waiting for him to step through first.
He feels weird knowing Castiel’s name but not vice versa, so he introduces himself finally. “I’m Dean by the way,” he says.
“Do you like it?”
Dean glares at him, dissatisfied with the answer, but Sam interrupts them.
“Oh no, it’s okay,” Cas shakes his head. “I’m used to taking a little longer everywhere.”
“Is everyone okay?” Cas asks as he grabs the kitchen’s first aid kit and starts cleaning the young hunter’s wound while he’s trying to eat a gigantic sandwich.
So Dean looks up, and Cas looks up, and then he realizes.
A shout tore him out of his memories, Someone pushed him out of the way and he numbly watched the car he had just propped up crash back down.
Dean looked down. He felt raw and laid open, terrified of the answer. But as per usual, Cas didn't let him go. He held on tighter.
Dean laughed and stood, pulling up Cas with him.

"Thank God," Sam says and hugs him so tight Dean's scared he's gonna faint. Dean lets himself be hugged and as Sam pulls back his eyes meet Cas'.
“Sorry,” Castiel said quickly and tried stepping around her, when he felt a hand on his ankle.
Their kisses were deep but unhurried; clothes landed on the floor one by one until they were both fully undressed. They changed positions; Cas lay on top of Dean, sucking bruises into his neck while Dean held onto him tightly, hips moving against Cas’s in a slow rhythm.
"Dean, I. Dean
"Bed sounds great," he mumbled against Cas's lips. Cas responded by stroking Dean's cock for a moment before letting go and nudging Dean away to stand up.
“Sure,” Dean said. “What's his name?”
“Likewise, Dean. Now let me explain a few things. I know why you’re here, but I’m not gonna treat you like an unruly child. You’re an adult and there’s a reason you did the things that landed you here. I asked for a report and background info, for safety purposes. As you’re very well aware, we work with veterans. I can’t afford to have a kid with anger issues. I trust you to not antagonize any of the people here. Follow me.” Ben started walking towards the right wall of the main room, which held another closed door.
Sam nodded and carefully helped Cas sit down on the toilet lid. "Do you need anything else?"
"Hello," Cas smiled at him and then pulled him in, a warm and tight hug holding the last of him together. Dean buried his face in Cas' neck, inhaling his scent. His soft sleep shirt felt heavenly against Dean’s flushed skin, and he pulled back a bit.
“Tomorrow I think,” Dean says. “Sam said he’d drive by around four?”
Dean nodded and then saw the letters still on the floor. "Hey, uh, could you maybe help me get this to my car? I didn't get a parking space very close to here."
“Yes, I am. Dean, listen. About Thanksgiving...I know we said you’d drive here but uhm. I’ve been seeing someone, and she asked me to go home with her over the holidays to meet her family.”
“You’re an incredible sap,” Dean says. Cas shakes his head but his expression is soft, and he gently stands up. Dean feels boneless, watches Cas bring him a washcloth, and lets him clean him up. The cloth lands on the floor with a wet thud, and Cas pulls the blanket over them.
"Uhm," the doctor says. "Your brother is— he was intubated!"
He couldn't stop the bone-deep sigh escaping him as Cas ran soapy fingers through his hair and glided a loofah over his chest. He dipped it back into the water and washed Dean's arms and neck, dipped it back under and ran it over his groin and thighs.
As soon as Cas was done, Dean took his hand back. Cas let him. After a moment of silence, Dean spoke again.
As he’s taking the cup out from under the machine there’s a frantic knock on the door.
“No idea,” Gabe replied and looked at Dean with sad eyes. “Inias called me and told me about it. He found him apparently, but it was too late and he couldn't do anything. I knew him and Inias had an argument a year ago or so because he found cocaine or something in Alfie's room, but I didn't know it was an ongoing thing. I should have known. How could I not have seen that? I should've-”
"Did you get hurt anywhere else?" He was carefully wiping away some blood, and it burned.
Cas smirked at him before disappearing into the house again. After Dean's recovery from the sudden assault on his trachea, Cas reappeared with a Tupperware container and a blanket bunched under one arm.
Days go by, a week, two weeks, three weeks. It’s October, Dean was still drunk in the morning from the night before and drank more during the day, but not on days he went to Cas’s house. He brushed his teeth and showered for him, he slipped on a mask and found comfort in Cas’s hugs and laugh, in his lopsided smile and warm hands. Even Hannah was kind to him, when before she had pretty much ignored him whenever she could.
Dean shoved it aside. Cas didn't need him to drool all over him. It was clear that Cas needed a friend, and Dean wanted to be that for him. If something else came of it in the future he wouldn't complain, but right now earning his trust was more important.
Dean’s so busy helping Charlie with getting the muffins out of the oven that he doesn’t notice anything else, right up until he puts a few of them into the display case at the counter. He happens to look up to check how much time is left until they open, and there’s Castiel outside, but he’s leaving. Dean hurries to the door, unlocks it and opens it.
They both move.
“There you go. Have a nice day, I guess.”
Castiel started standing up, and without thinking Dean's hand shot out, and he reached through and grabbed Castiel's pant leg.
"Sorry, didn't mean to be nosy."
"I thought I had the right ones," Cas says. "I'm sorry, I ruined tonight."
“We can look at it tomorrow,” Dean says and noses Cas’ shoulder. “Let’s sleep.”
Castiel perked up at that and nodded. “Yes please, that would be wonderful, I really think they’re outstanding.”
“Sam helped us with a problem,” Daniel makes a face, and Dean remembers the issue they had with a rogue demon trapping Daniel. “We granted him a favor, and I’m here to fulfill the debt.”
“C’mere,” Dean says and Cas peers up at him from half underneath his pillow. Dean reaches over him and Cas slots right into his arms. Cas is warm, shaking and clinging to Dean.
"Thank you," he whispered and pressed a kiss to the top of Cas's head. "In that case, gimme a day and time and I'll be here."
Dean whips around and he sees Naomi standing a few feet from him, her hand on Cas’ shoulder while he’s wiping blood off his angel blade. His eyes look empty. He pockets the weapon.
"Thank you. I don't really talk about things. I'm more the 'ignore it until you start screaming' kind of guy. Telling you all of this is, uh, kind of a big deal for me."
I know I originally said December...but uh, life happens weirdly sometimes. I'm sorry for the wait :(
"I can't believe this," Tim muttered, but before he could say anything else a different voice boomed across the garage.
“That’s my problem,” Dean mutters and Sam just smiles at him like Dean’s an idiot.
Sam raised an eyebrow behind his brother's back. "What, you and Cas?"
you, I was scared
“Okay,” Sam said. “Can you tell me what happened? I can’t promise that I can help, but I can try?”
"I couldn't afford it," Dean blurted, fidgeting and not looking in Cas's direction. "Sorry for lying. It's not exactly glamorous."
"You wouldn't be alone. Or, at least you wouldn't have to be. You have Sam, you have me. I'm not sure if you still think Sam might leave and do something different, but I can assure you that he would not do so. If you don't believe me on that, then trust me when I say that I would stay." Cas picked up his spoon again and continued eating. Dean stared at him, unsure of what to say. After a few minutes, Dean cleared his throat and mumbled a quiet thanks.
A rough laugh floated through and Dean perked up at hearing it.. Did he just make Cas laugh?
"You didn't say anything bad, if that's what you're thinking. I just didn't think you could actually be interested in spending that much time with me, so I wanted to ask. And—" Cas opened his mouth but Dean just put a hand over it. "I think you're pretty perfect, so." Dean shrugged. "There's that."
Sam looked up and met his brother's gaze, then shook his head slightly. "Can they even do that? The zapping I mean."
Dean tried desperately to fit everything into the box, but to no avail. There was too much stuff this time, and he'd have to go twice. With a bit too much force, he pushed the box away from him, and a few letters floated to the floor. He stared at them, sighed, and laced his fingers behind his neck. He straightened his spine before trying to relax again. Cas had shown him these techniques to help with his stress and anger, though he had forgotten what they were called. Tense, let go, breathe. The air in Ben's office smelled like soil and flowers, a bit like dust and paper too. A hint of Old Spice from the man himself lingered at the desk. Tense, let go, breathe.
Cas gave him a bashful smile and led the way into the kitchen. He dodged Hannah, who had chosen a nap spot in the middle of the living room floor, and pointed to one side of the room. "I thought we could sit on the porch, but I don't have a table. If you help me carry this out, we can sit at it together. I would have done it on my own, but my back has been hurting and I didn't want to strain it too much."
The screaming stops for a beat. The sheets around Dean are visibly damp, framing his heaving chest. “Cas,” he whispers. “Cas, help. Please help. Cas, I….Cas, Cas,
He doesn’t actually want to see you, Dean’s brain said.
"I'm sorry you lost your parents, Dean. Where does your brother go to college, if you don't mind me asking?"
“Okay.” Sam looked confused now. “Not that I mind, but why did you want to call so late? I have work tomorrow since I don’t have classes, so if it’s not super important could we reschedule?”
"I want to see the next movie," Cas says as they walk around the house to the front and take off their shoes at the door.
“Let’s take a chance on happiness,” Dean says, his voice gentle and hoarse.
Dean would get it, though. He'd probably be tired of himself too.
"Good choice Dean. Grab a bottle instead of finishing this conversation," Sam said, fully aware Dean would hear him. The older hunter stopped walking and turned around to face his brother. Before he could say anything though, Cas intervened again.
"Yeah, we all have them. Doesn't make them suck any less. You staying with Cas after delivering those?" He pointed to the boxes on the desk.
“Yeah!” Dean’s imagining it all; warm lighting and good music, food and his family, and he feels happy. “We got enough space to invite people, like Jody, Donna and the kids.”
Cas hummed in response. "He sounds like a very intelligent man. I fully agree with him."
Dean pulled his phone and wallet from his back pockets and dropped down in front of the screen door. He gestured to the mountain of pillows on the chair to his right.
“His name’s Castiel,” Bobby says. “Been comin’ here for years, and I’ve been giving him stuff outside of opening hours. Got a rough job. He’s good people. Forgot to mention him, since you took over my early shift he’s gonna be a regular thing. Won’t show up every morning, but usually at the same time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll risk potential glitter contamination,” Castiel says, and his eyes sparkle with amusement. “It sounds devastating, of course. I hope you can recover.”
"Sorry about the door," Sam says. "We locked it earlier because my brother had to go to the bathroom. Uh, with help. Forgot to unlock."
Everyone stocks up on weapons.
“Then let’s do it,” Cas says.
Together they carried the table outside, then brought out plates, cutlery and the decor. Cas placed a vase with freshly cut flowers in the middle of the table and arranged everything neatly around it.
Cas shook his head. "I'm not good at this, Dean. If I say something that upsets you, please tell me. I've never had a healthy relationship before, I don't know what to do or what's important to communicate because you might assume otherwise, and if any of what I did gave you the feeling I didn't want you here, then I'm truly sorry." He stepped forward and grabbed Dean's hands.
Dean thinks for a moment. “You’re gonna be a doctor?”
The older hunter wasn't in his room, but the Impala's keys sat on his desk, meaning he had not left the bunker, at least not very far. Castiel went to the kitchen, but Dean wasn't there either. After checking the gun range, the gym, and the storage room they had been working on, he didn't really know where to look anymore. He went to Sam's room and knocked lightly. After a second, the man's soft voice called for him to come in.
“Let’s go,” Dean says and turns around. He wiggles his ass and Cas places a gentle hand on his waist before lying close behind him.
Cas is hesitant. “If I do something wrong you’d tell me?”
A dark wooden fence wound around the front, meeting the hedge at the sides. Everything looked well loved and cared for, undoubtedly the work of a devoted gardener. Dean opened the little gate holding a light blue mailbox on one of its posts, stepped through and readjusted the box under his left arm. He carefully made his way across the yard, up the stairs and knocked on the heavy oak door. As he waited for a reply, he noticed more flowers: carefully trimmed roses sitting in huge pots all around the patio. The door had a smaller, well-concealed frame at its bottom, and Dean guessed it to be a cat flap.
“I’m fourteen weeks,” Eileen says. “Nothing to see yet.”
“Hello,” Cas says, and Dean nods back.
"Cas," Dean said, pained. "I haven't even showered. I smell. And now I also smell like beer. It's not pretty."
Dean did, and immediately felt Cas's hands on his shoulders, pulling him in. He let himself be moved, ending with his head on Cas's shoulder, his arms around his waist and Cas holding onto him, softly stroking over the back of his head.
Dean just shook his head and laughed quietly.
"Thank you," Cas said. "And thank you for accepting me still. The reason this-" He gestured to his own face, "-happened greatly exacerbates my fear and apprehension about showing my face. I'm sorry for being so secretive."
After the second week, Dean asked Cas during his lunch break if he could sleep over that night. It was Friday. Cas had Saturday off, and Dean felt a little less like the local sad sack.
you for who you are, exactly who you are. The only thing I want to
A quick prayer to Cas sends his plan of attack. They’re using a model they’ve done before: Dean and Sam will go in first, and Cas will quietly do the job in the shadows, then join them again afterwards. Dean nods to Sam, shows two fingers, then one, and Sam nods back. Dean raises his weapon, pulse elevated, senses sharp as they can be.
"They did lower the amount of supernaturally related murders significantly in the whole midwest over the past few weeks. If Sam has forgiven her and agreed to work with them, why can't you, Dean?"
Cas sounded so excited that Dean immediately felt guilty.
“Is that the condom I gave to you?” He nudged the obnoxiously yellow foil packet and felt Cas laughter vibrate against his chest.
“Got fired. I hurt my hand, Tim helped and he could tell right away. Sent me to my boss, he fired me. Said he knew for a while now.” Dean didn’t look at Cas, who immediately let go of his hand, looked at it and then grabbed for his right.
"So," Sam said after finishing his texts. "I guess now we just have to wait for him to wake up."
"He left his phone," Dean said and pointed to the small bookshelf next to the couch, nestled into the corner of the room and filled to the brim with books of different sizes and colors, neatly organized but still almost too much for the little shelf. On top of it sat Cas' phone, next to his keys for the bunker and his car, the most recent addition to it being a small keychain that Cas had picked up on his way home. It showed a watercolor drawing of a beautiful flower and tiny bees flying around it. Dean picked up the keyring and turned it over in his hands, looking at the small picture.
This time, though, it was more than a simple act of empathy. It was care, thankfulness, adoration. Cas's hand met him halfway, and they laced their fingers together. The immediate show of trust and support encouraged him to try and put into words what had happened the day before.
“You’re not alone,” Cas murmured and squeezed his hand, and Dean smiled at him briefly.
He toweled off afterwards, putting on some clean pajamas Cas had loaned him, and stepped back into the bedroom. Cas was sitting on the bed reading, stunning in the warm light of about a dozen candles. The room was warm, the windows open and the faint smell of vanilla in the air.
"That bed looks really soft," Dean said and grinned wolfishly at Cas. "I wonder..." Dean took Cas's hand and pulled him close. He walked backwards until he felt the foot of the bed against the back of his legs, then sat down. Cas still held his hand and regarded him with a heated look in his eyes. Dean scooted backwards and pulled his shirt off.
"No, don't apologize for shit like that. Do you think you can stand to finish your shower?" Dean fumbled with the curtain and as he waited for Cas' answer.
“Dean?” Cas’s voice was his usual gravelly velvet, and there was soft music in the background.
“So,” Dean says, peeling off the muffin paper. “You work in a hospital?”
“Don’t tell me you changed the date again.”
"Yeah, right. Did we come to any conclusion on that?" Dean plopped down onto the couch, stretched his back and yawned.
"For reference, I'm smiling right now," Cas said and Dean grinned.
He’s dressed and downstairs to take care of the sauce when the doorbell rings. Dean hurries to open the door, maybe a bit too forcefully, and tries to conceal this with a cool pose. That intention ends up in the trash when he stumbles and almost smashes his face into the door, but catches himself.
"Oh. Dean, that's okay. You should've said, I could have added some to my grocery order. It wouldn't have been any issue at all." Cas's voice was warm and reassuring.
"It’s going to have to wait until tomorrow at least," Sam says. “I need sleep.”
He sees the trench coat flutter, hears loud banging noises, and then his hearing gives out. Cas is kneeling next to him, cradling Dean’s head in his hands. Sam appears next to them and drops down, searches Dean’s body quickly before pressing into his stomach.
“We looked for stuff that might be fun to do, get your mind off things.” Dean shrugs.
"Can do.” Ben grinned at him.
"It's a big vamp nest in Creston, Wyoming. Too much for the two local hunters, so they need backup. We can pick up some supplies at the bunker and you can just join then? I don't think we need two cars."
Sam's point was clearly proven when Dean yawned again and scratched his head. The latter just grabbed the laptop and started looking through a few news sites while Sam got up and retrieved a book from one of the shelves behind him.
“So,” Sam says. “When’s the wedding?”
Dean nods and tears off a corner of the meat. As Cas takes it almost falls and they both grab for it, fingers briefly intertwined but letting go just as quickly. Dean watches Cas try the ham, sees him chew thoughtfully and analyze every bit of it. Then, he smiles.
Dean sighed. No matter how fucked up everything seemed to be, that familiar greeting would always feel like home to him.
"Are you asking because of something I said?"
“I think it might be best to simply...show you.”
Cas touched Dean's jaw and turned his head back to face him.
"I am now," Cas said and his kind eyes met Dean's worried ones. "I would, however, suggest that we cook sooner than later. I'm quite hungry."
Slowly, Castiel moved his right hand towards his, letting it hover for a moment before placing it on Dean's. Dean clasped their hands together and held on tight.
"With Cas, too. You know. Dinner. Hanging around. Maybe you'll finally get the courage to do something over the heart eyes he gives you and you throw back every single time." Sam smirked as Dean started choking on his lemonade.
“Awesome. We can decorate it after work!”
"Hey pal, can I help ya?" A friendly looking guy came up to him. "Good eye you got there. It's hella comfy and it's a pull out too."
“Cas loves you,” Ben said, and Dean closed his eyes. “He didn’t tell me, and he don’t need to. It’s written all over your face, too. But,” Ben continued, and Dean dreaded what was coming next, undoubtedly a conversation about how Dean wasn’t good enough for Cas, how this evening proved that. “Love doesn’t solve every problem in the world. If you got stuff you don’t deal with, stuff that you can’t deal with, then you should go and ask for help. There is help. Trust me when I say that I’ve seen hopeless cases, and boy, you ain’t one of them.”
“I called Sam today,” Dean said. “I took your advice. I asked about visiting him for Thanksgiving, and he said yes. Also said I could crash at his place.” Dean closed his eyes briefly. Then, he smiled even more. “I can’t wait to see him again.”
The fear must show on his face, because Cas doesn’t close the gap. He hovers right there though, close enough that his nose bumps Dean’s, but slides his hand into Dean’s hair briefly. Strong fingers grab onto the strands for a moment that sends fire down Dean’s belly before moving on, gliding over his neck and down his shoulder, caressing the skin where his sleeve ends before moving on. It’s an almost itchy kind of softness when Cas reaches the inside of Dean’s elbow, goes further and—
Cas nods. Dean raises an eyebrow, sees a slight
After a few moments, Cas adds, "I barely ever dreamed of something like this, and it’s perfect."
“Thank you,” Cas says, and his eyes are shining.
“I picked some plants because they looked nice,” he says. “Some because they taste good—”
"Okay, hold on, I'll help you," Dean said and peeled off his jeans, then his shirt. Even only in his boxers he still felt overly warm in the small bathroom that was filled with hot steam. Carefully he stepped into the tub, facing away from the shower head and towards Cas.
There’s more lingering touches and a few position changes. Then, Cas is on top of Dean, looking into his eyes with his forearms framing Dean’s head as he sinks into him. Dean shudders, and Cas noses at his cheek as he bottoms out.
A week later Cas pulls him up the stairs and into the office.
Ben grinned at him. "Don't act all shy now, Dean. I've only heard the best things about you from Cas."
"Dean?" Sam looked at him alarmed. "What are you doing?"
"Cas."
“Castiel,” Castiel, says. “But the spelling is a bit difficult, so Cas is okay. Just not Cassie, please.”
He looked in the living room, his night stand, his closet, even the bathroom, but there was nothing. He ground his teeth together, then pawed through pockets and drawers for some cash. He'd have to buy some alcohol before work, or else he wouldn't get through the day.
"Hey Cas, I gotta go grab some new towels from the douche at the front desk, your shower has to wait a few minutes." Dean grabbed a key card and put on his shoes.
Sam looked at him, a pained expression on his face. "Did they use us against you again?"
“What’s not surprising?” he asks Charlie.
Dean watched Cas look at the gift like it would bite him, so Dean nudged his shoulder gently. "Come on, Cas. Open it."
Dean’s heart goes a bit fuzzy at that, and he hides his smile by taking out the butter and eggs.
Dean opened the fridge and grabbed a beer along with the last blueberry muffin he baked during a nervous night break down a few days ago. He recently discovered that producing a ton of food helped a lot with calming down, although their kitchen was now completely full of pie, muffins and quiches. Walking past the kitchen table he saw a note on it.
“What about him?” Dean asked and searched his friend's eyes. Gabe swallowed and looked at his matted dress shoes, then fiddled with a lose strand of his black dress pants.
Slowly, he tried to blink the pain and dizziness away, finding that his left eye stayed resolutely shut. After a few moments he understood which position his body was in as he regained some of the feeling in the number parts.
Sorry for the few days delay! I was sick (again) and it was kinda stressful here. Please excuse any typos or weird things you might find, I wanted to get this uploaded asap. Enjoy :)
“Either way,” Dean says. “I don't want to open late. We got an hour, and I want to hear what everyone thinks about the new drinks.”
"Serving.. lemonade?" Dean asked before taking another sip.
The next four hours went by quickly, and before Dean knew it he had shot off a text to Cas and was on his way. He had the windows rolled down, the warm breeze drifting through his sweat-damp hair. A random rock song was on the radio, and he tapped the rhythm onto the steering wheel.
Cas turned to him and held his hand out. Dean stared at him for a moment, drinking in the sight of him: his flat stomach, the vee of his legs pointing to his soft cock and the muscle packed thighs that framed it. Dean wanted to put his mouth on every inch of him, but for now he took Cas's hand and let himself be guided into the tub. Cas got in behind him, so Dean sat with his back to Cas's chest.
They were woken by sunlight and bird song. Dean turned to face Cas and tangled their legs together. He watched him with a small smile on his face and-
Sam dropped his pen on the table, jumped off the chair and sprinted to his brother. Sliterhing around the corner, he saw Dean standing in front of Cas' room, the door open and his brother staring into the room.
did you like it? :) i'll try and update again asap to make up for the kinda missing chapter you got now. :)
Dean looked at his own hand then, placed on the ratty comforter like an afterthought. It was more green-ish by now, swollen with the deep cut across the back of it crusted over.
Cas grumbled and reached for him with shaky arms, Sam lifted him up easily and helped him sit down on the bed again. The effort of getting up exhausted Cas immensely and he was shaking all over. Sam shot him a concerned look, then went to pick up his flannel from the bathroom floor. It had dried blood on it and he threw it wordlessly on the table, then he picked up his own shirt from the day before and handed it to Cas.
Cas now picks up the soap and gives Dean the same treatment. His hands are big and warm, leaving goosebumps wherever they roam and he, too, finishes with Dean’s legs, only to stand up again after. As much as Dean has always loved sex, this is a different kind of intimacy. They’re both too hurt, too vulnerable for anything physical to happen between them tonight, and Dean’s more than okay with it. He doesn’t want to push Cas or nudge too hard at the soft pink bubble they’re creating, but contently stands watching as Cas washes between his own legs, Dean’s cock not getting the message and thickening a bit as he gives himself the same treatment under Cas’ watchful eye.
Dean shook his head. He couldn’t believe Cas would risk this, and at the same time it was no surprise at all. He really, really couldn’t believe his luck of having Cas.
Dean followed him, his fingers throbbing. He was ashamed of messing up yet again at work. They entered a small office stuffed to the ceiling with crooked shelves filled with paper. A small desk sat in the middle, with two mismatched chairs in front of it.
Dean shook his head no and laughed. “No, I'm good with anything. I do love meat though,” he added and Cas hummed.
Before he could knock, the cat door opened.
“I wish I could help them more,” Cas says. “There must be something else I can do.”
Dean woke up feeling well rested, looking forward to Cas arriving later that day. Still sleepy, he rubbed his eyes and checked his phone.
"I'm sorry, I have to go. I'll call you tomorrow.  Good night, Dean."
"Good. Oh! The app says the car just reached your house. Put some shoes on, ideally, and just come here. The rest doesn't matter, to me or in general. I'll wait for you. I have to go into the garden for a moment and take care of Hannah, but if you want to or need to just call me back again. I'll see you in a bit."
"You're still calling her Mary? Dean, you need to talk to her about this."
“Okay, thank you,” Dean said.
“This sauce is truly outstanding,” Cas says, and Dean’s cheeks warm.
"Still," Cas says. "We haven’t spent a lot of time together lately."
His hand looked strong, tan with long fingers. Dean liked it.
He reaches up and glides his fingers along the edges of an ivy leaf swinging gently from its mother branch.
“I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to put you in that position.” Dean stared at a loose thread in the blanket on his lap as guilt crept in from all sides.
"Can you help me get him out of the tub?" Dean asked.
"I didn't pay enough attention while I was working on a car. I fucked up the safety and it almost came crashing down on me. Only reason I'm not mush right now is because someone pushed me out of the way."
“This was after Lucifer killed me,” Cas says.
"Best date ever," he whispered to himself.
"Dean, can you help me please? I can't lift my arms that high," Cas' back hunched but Dean immediately touched his shoulder reassuringly.
He opened his eyes with monumental effort and found himself confused for a moment before he remembered where he was.
"Come in," Dean says, and he gently steps away before opening the door. The humidity rolls over him in a warm wave, and he walks in. Cas follows suit, and Dean closes the door.
“You really did.” Ben shook his head and gingerly placed Dean’s foot back on the floor. His eyes landed on Dean’s left hand, and his gaze sharpened. “What the fuck happened to your hand?”
"Yeh, that's fine, thanks." Dean gave him his address and made his way to the cashier.
floofy) and brought them to Cas, who had spread the blanket on the grass and set the Tupperware next to it. Dean opened his arms and let the pillows drop, then Cas arranged them to one side while sitting cross-legged on the blanket. Dean joined him and pointed to the small blue plastic container.
“Can I hold you?”
you change, is getting healthy. Not for me, but for you. Please, Dean.”
"What?" He croaked, punching himself on the chest a few times. Sam just kept giving him that horrible smirk.
Cas picks at a loose thread on his sleeve. “I was a Sergeant First Class,” he says. “Everyone kept telling me how impressed they were by what I accomplished at a young age, but I don’t see it that way. They promoted me before they found out about my preferences, and I was honorably discharged at 29.”
"It took me years of secret hookups to even think about the fact that I'm not straight." Dean said, shooting Cas a sceptical look. "Don't think I'd be very helpful. Although my old man trying to beat it out of me probably didn't help with the whole self-acceptance thing." He shrugged.
Cas closed the card, and put it down next to the other things Dean had gotten him.
Cas’ face is grim, but it fades as he rolls out of Dean’s arms to grab his phone. “I like when you call yourself that,” he mumbles as he thumbs through their contacts list.
"Well, Dean," Sam said, looking angrily at his brother, "some people just make up their minds about the right decision very late. Being able to chose the thing that will benefit the most people over personal issues is also a skill that I'd appreciate in any friend."
“Yeah. He offered and my dumb ass said no and we kinda fought, but it makes sense. And then,” Dean paused and looked to Cas briefly for support, “then I’m going to therapy.”
“Pay attention to when and where you have to be to complete your tasks. Missing a day unexcused automatically counts as a failed program and you will not have the chance to continue. You are hereby dismissed.”
"Sorry," he said and moved to pull away, but Dean didn't let him. He cupped his face, before pressing a kiss to the center of his forehead. Another to his right temple, then his left. The tip of his nose, his eyelids, chin, both cheeks.
Both of them went into the kitchen where Dean was already busy tearing apart the fridge. When he heard them come in, he turned around and looked at Cas.
"White. And Ben told me once that my nose is indeed cute; however, I'm not entirely sure if it was a joke."
“Thank you for today. Good night, Dean,” Cas says and gets out. He waves as he closes the door, and Dean waves back.
“Cas?”
He walks into the ER that’s busy as always, and he feels monumentally stupid with his hat. He walks up to the reception desk and waits until the woman behind it has finished her phone call. She seems stressed.
Dean eyed them both warily, then got up from the sofa and ignored Sam's outstretched hand, who then frowned and got up from the floor himself.
"You wanna go eat breakfast now?"
"You're not," Cas adds. "Sam will still be there. Even if he moves out, you’ll still have him."
"I'd like to return the favor now," he said with red cheeks and sweat beaded on his forehead.
Cas raised his eyebrows. "I don't think so? Did you ever make it before?" Dean laughed and shook his head.
“Yes, I’m sorry, there was an emergency with one of the patients. They’re okay, but I couldn’t leave.”
While he was figuring out which buttons to use and which not (he once wiped all the new configuration Sam had made and setting that up again was a mess), Sam came towards him from one of the side entries, his phone in hand.
him talk. He knew first hand that someone won't talk if you pressure them, after all.
Dean gave a thumbs up before grabbing his glass and then stopping. "Uh, how do you want to sit? Not to complain, but I don't think my back can take sitting up for a couple hours."
“If you need to talk about anything, ever, I'm here,” Dean said and squeezed Castiel's hand, and Castiel squeezed right back.
An overstuffed couch with plenty of room for five guests is the centerpiece of the living room, and Cas always puts fresh flowers in vases all throughout the house.
"Okay," Dean said again and hung up. He got up, his aching body protesting, and looked for shoes. He jammed his feet into old sneakers that got kicked under the couch a while ago. He pocketed his phone in his dirty sweatpants, pulled his askew hoodie straight and made his way downstairs.
“Under one condition.”
Dean balled his hands to fists, again overcome by pure anger about what had happened to Cas. He was pulled out of it when Cas tried to shampoo his hair, giving a pained sound.
"I would say that I am. I can't find Dean, do you know where he might have gone? I looked everywhere in the bunker."
The voice was silent, so Dean furrowed his brows and made his way back to his car.
Cas takes off his wet and snowy boots, and Dean takes note of the jeans he’s wearing today. He offers to take Cas' coat, and tries not to stare--he's never seen Cas without scrubs
“Yeah?”
The motel’s clock ticks. Cars drive by, splashing through puddles, and it's almost dark as it continues to rain. The musty smell of the checkered sheets and the slight cold of the room are the things on Dean’s mind, until it gets warmer.
"I'm warm," he says as Dean watches him, and a blush rises high in his cheeks.
He spared only a few seconds to take in the rest of Cas: broad shoulders, strong thighs, bare feet. Slightly shorter than him.
"Did we hit a deer on the way and bring it too?"
"May I?" He pointed towards Cas' chest where Sam's flannel had slipped down a little, exposing a lightly bruised shoulder. Cas nodded.
The day the English Bluebells start blooming, he finishes by sealing the polish on the front oak door.
The man’s expression softens a little. “Anything hot and caffeinated, I’m not picky.”
Dean nodded and pulled him close by the back of his neck. "Very much so."
and the strong smell of antiseptic drowned Dean’s senses. He hated doctors, hospitals, anything that fell into these categories.
Dean closed his eyes against the guilt of letting Cas down, of worrying him this much. He couldn’t help but imagine if the roles were reversed, and he felt the fear for Cas’s health like a stab to his heart.
“Surprise?” Dean grinned at him before closing his eyes again. Cas hovered over Dean and kissed him, bit his bottom lip gently and dropped his head briefly when one of Dean’s hands found his dripping cock.
“Well,” Ben said, “thank us by cutting that cake, will you? It’s been staring at me for an hour and I can’t take it anymore.”
"The next Star Wars! Figured we gotta make a fan out of you ASAP.."
“There we go. Sorry, it’s easier to talk like this. Please, I’m listening. Oh, do you want a pillow?”
Dean shook his head. “Don’t apologize, it’s okay. Thank
Twenty-two minutes later, they pulled up in front of Cas's house. "Here we are," the driver said. "Have a good night."
Eleven dollars and fourteen cents. That's what Dean had left after having to repair his toilet. The old pipes just didn't hold up anymore and even though he DIY'd as much as he could, he still had to pay someone to help him.
"Are you okay with this? Do you want me to continue?"
“Thank you for today,” Cas says.
A few seconds later his phone vibrated, and he had a new text from an unsaved number.
“Will do.”
Sam nodded. “Do you need money? I can send you some. I’ve been saving the pocket money you’ve been sending me for emergencies, and I can help out if that’s an issue?”
Eventually, Cas moves. His hands glide down Dean’s arms and come to rest on Dean’s hands, and Dean intertwines their fingers without a thought. He’s looking at Cas, standing so close his chin is tilted slightly. He rests his forehead against Cas’ and their noses bump softly against each other. Cas’ left hand crawls up to rest on the side of Dean’s neck, and he lets the sensation of it flood his heart.
"Jerk," Sam laughs and slaps Dean on the back.
, a beautiful man with a wonderful spirit and a huge heart, scarred but supportive and caring every waking minute.
Dean mock saluted in response, and started heading down the stairs. He had to stop to pet Hannah when she wound herself around his legs, and made a mental note to wash his hands ASAP when he was home. Cat allergies were no joke.
Dean thought about it for a moment. "Do you want to dress up and sit here and maybe I could bring my really shit laptop and we could eat and watch a movie? Cuddle in the dark, all that?" Dean tightened his hold on Cas's hand, who squeezed back.
actually yell at me,” Cas added.
(See the end of the chapter for
While looking through a booklet for a science related club, someone tapped him on the shoulder.
"You're still pretty out of it, huh." Dean smiled at him and then continued to dry his neck and shoulders, carefully sliding the towel over the pink skin on his chest and belly. With clinical detachment he helped Cas dry his groin area and then moved to dry his legs and rub his feet, which felt icy against Dean's own.
“Priorities,” Dean mumbles, and Cas rolls his eyes at that.
"Around the corner. I had to park her while, uhm. While Sam carried you in."
Cas’ face softens, and his eyes are gentle. “You noticed.”
He closed the door behind him and checked his phone. No new messages. The angel frowned and put his phone back in his coat pocket. Time to continue looking for Dean then.
“Djinn,” Dean spits, and steps between the monster and the boy.
Cas still looks concerned, but the expression softens when he looks at his coffee. He looks past Dean at the clock, and sighs.
"You’re really settin' the mood here," Dean said and nudged him softly.
They sit in comfortable silence as Cas eats, and when he’s done he leans back. He takes another sip of his coffee, and fidgets. “Can I ask you something?”
“It's so beautiful.” Dean let his eyes roam over the garden. There was an old tree in the back left corner, and the sides and back were protected by the tall hedge.
"What happened?" Dean stood in front of the bathtub and stared at the hideous shower curtain.
Castiel Winchester
Cas looks at him. “For cock.”
“Better?” Dean asked and smiled at Gabe.
“I’m just here to provide muffins,” Dean says, and the man nods.
He drinks his water, and Dean looks at him like he’s hung the moon. Charlie drops their conversation and talks to Gilda; Sam’s talking to Eileen, and so Dean and Cas and their corner of the table are their own little universe.
The old warehouse Jody told them about is right outside town, a twenty minute drive from the city center where they picked up breakfast. An uneven gravel road leads them towards lone  and run—down houses, unkempt lawns appearing further apart the longer they drive.
"I've been tending to my english roses, they can be very sensitive and require a lot of care. It's been quite a challenge, but they bloomed for the first time today!" Cas pointed to a pair of white roses, which looked extremely delicate even to Dean's untrained eye. He whistled and nuzzled Cas's head.
“I only know the leading position,” Dean says. “Which means I’d put my hand on your waist.”
wearingmywings <3
“That one has a basement,” Dean says. “A bigger kitchen. Open floor plan.”
“It’s the consequences of your actions,” Dean says. “Call us if you guys need something, we’ll be in tonight but off the rest of the week.”
This time neither of them is dying, or disappearing. They’re here to stay, to love and live.
“Who is this?” a muffled voice came through the door, and Dean realized he was staring at a peephole.
“Castiel.”
Dean loved Sam. He missed him. But, he was too scared to talk to him more often. Sam leaving for California four years ago had been horrible, though Dean would never admit that to him. It had hurt him deeply, and he felt that ever since then, he and Sam just lost something between them. They’d had no contact at all for the first months because Dean was too upset to call, and Sam too busy. Later there was sporadic texting, a call for Christmas, but that was it. Dean was determined to try and change something though. Cas had quietly suggested talking to Sam a few nights ago, and Dean had been thinking about it ever since. Cas’s idea that maybe Sam never called because he thought Dean wouldn’t want to talk to him he had brushed off though. The worst Sam could say was no, although that would do its fair share of kicking Dean in the heart.
“I hope your day improves,” Dean says as he holds the door open for him. Cas hurries outside and Dean watches him.
Dean nodded.
When he takes his last bite, the bunker's front door screeches. There's a surprised little flip in his stomach, and he forces himself to stay put in the kitchen until he hears footsteps. He sets down his plate and Cas comes down the steps into the kitchen, a small plastic bag swinging in his hand.
A few days later finds Dean in the kitchen, closing the laptop. He saves the google maps locations on his phone and leans back. As he drains his coffee cup, Sam comes in.
Dean nudges him gently. “I’m here for any talks you want to have, whether it's feelings, dicks, cars or plants, though I know absolutely nothing about plants.”
Castiel hesitates, and Dean just waves him over again. He holds the door open and Castiel steps hesitantly inside. There’s snow stuck to his boots, and he’s getting the entryway all wet and dirty, but Dean doesn’t mind. He’ll clean it later.
“That’s not how it works,” Cas says but he takes Dean’s hand anyway and gets up. They’re standing too close together, Dean feels Cas’ breath on his cheek and takes a half step back. Cas shrugs off the coat, then the jacket, but his hands tremble too much to take off his tie. Dean steps forward again, carefully undoes the knot and lets the silk slip through his fingers. He drops it on the floor and traces his eyes across Cas’ face.
Dean comes to on the cold warehouse floor. He can’t see, but quickly realizes Cas is half on top of him, his coat spread over his head. Dean moves carefully to assess any new injuries but finds none. Endless glass shards on the floor around them reflect the moonlight streaming in through the collapsed ceiling. Cas stirs and Dean helps him to his feet. Together they turn around and face the Djinn who’s pressing a hand to a deep gash on his throat.
Dean looked around the room, Cas' sweatpants were still on the floor next to the sink.
’ on Cas’ coffee cup, and tells Charlie to only use that cup for when Cas comes by.
Dean's carrying one of the huge watering cans for Cas, helping him make his evening round. The sun hasn't set fully but it's not reaching the ground anymore, just dipping the crowns of the trees in molten gold. The air smells like damp soil, and Cas is cutting a handful of his roses for a small bouquet. Dean watches him dethorn them, his big but gentle hands swiftly cutting over the stems and binding them together with an elastic. He looks up and catches Dean staring, who walks over and drops a kiss on Cas' temple.
"I'm so sorry, Cas." Sam wrung his hands in his lap and looked everywhere but at Cas' face.
"You had plenty of pillows offered to you; you just never took them." Cas made his way up the dark wooden stairs, a bit creaky and with art prints lining the wall to the right. Watercolor pictures of flowers mostly, with a couple animals in between. The pastel colors contrasted the rough wood around them, and Dean really liked it. Everything seemed so deliberate, care and love in every detail of the house.
What a sight he must be. There was still grease from the garage all over his hands and face. Tim's side mirror had revealed his eyes to be red and slightly swollen. There was a tear in his pullover, right near the neck hole, that kept getting bigger even though Dean had tried to curse it into not doing that.
"I'm so sorry you were in that position. I don't think you're a bad person because of it, and it doesn't deter me at all from my feelings for you. I still think you're amazing, and an uneasy past doesn't change that in the slightest." Cas leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to Dean's lips.
Dean dropped his hands to his sides and turned to him. "Bad week," he answered honestly, and Ben nodded.
"'M not depressed. My dad used to call me lazybones, and that I run away from stuff and take the easy way. Think he was right, you know."
They had their own routine now. Dean would come by every Wednesday or Thursday, depending on Ben's scheduling, after his work at the VSI. He'd bring Cas the box with knitted goods and letters, and they'd sit and sort through them together. Dean would watch Cas get a little misty eyed at some of the cards, smiling at some others. They’d sort everything into folders, keeping written and painted art as well as pages upon pages of letters safe in plastic sleeves. Cas kept everything, and it didn't surprise Dean that a huge closet in his office was dedicated purely to everything people had sent him.
Cas's eyes were wide open, his hand caressing the short hair at the back of Dean's neck.
“My parents are dead, and so are my siblings. I had several, but we were estranged for large parts of my adult life. They were military and just disappeared one by one.”
"You gotta help me for a second here and stand up buddy," he said and Cas nodded, clasping at Dean's upper arms to carefully stand up. Dean slid the pants over his butt and tied the strings.
Cas gave a little wave. “Hello,” he said.
At some point Dean’s lungs reminded him he needed air, and he reluctantly slowed the kiss until their mouths separated, but only enough to look into each other's eyes. They held on tight, breathing heavily.
(See the end of the chapter for
I could be dead, Dean thinks. It was close, very close, judging by his colleague’s reaction.
“Pretty sure the worst part is the kid.”
Dean smiled in earnest. "He hasn’t yet. And, me too. It's bad enough something like this happened to him, but he isolates himself because of it, and as much as he acts like he doesn’t need anyone, we both know that’s not true. I want to try and make his birthday special. Maybe you can help? What's his favorite cake?"
Both men sat like this, tightly embracing the other, suffering and mumbling soft words of comfort, for minutes, maybe hours. Neither had any concept of time, the most important thing being the presence of the other, grounding each other in that moment of vulnerability.
Dean drives him home a few hours later with a Tupperware box of decorated cookies on Cas’ lap. The comfortable atmosphere had Dean smiling all evening, and his cheeks feel sore when he drives home again.
Dean could hear the smile in Cas’s voice.
“Can I use one of those? Wood isn't the most comfortable thing to sit on for a while.”
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean skims the mains again. “I’ll have a bacon cheeseburger. Veggies on the side too. Thanks," Dean says.
“He’s prolly just busy,” Bobby says. “You’re going over there tomorrow anyways, just ask.”
"Okay. I hope the neighbors won't complain because of the noise."
Cas nods and hands Dean his flip-phone. Dean makes the call, mentions a sore throat for the reason Cas isn’t calling himself, and Cas is excused for the day. He still looks a bit pale, so Dean just waits. After a few minutes he carefully puts a hand on Cas’ forearm. When there’s no adverse reaction he keeps it there, and waits again.
"It's fine Cas," he said and took the towel away. Cas looked up at him through half open eyes, his dark hair sticking up wildly.
Cas accepted the shirt and slipped it over his head. He slowly maneuvered his arms through the sleeves and tugged the hem down.
“I’m really messed up, Sammy.” Dean wiped at his thankfully dry eyes and shook his head. “I’m messed up and I did some really dumb shit, and I’m going to fix it, but I don’t think I can do it alone.”
He shook his head and looked away from Cas. "I know I told you some stuff, but I don't want to talk about him. It took me a long fucking time to accept that there's nothing wrong with me, and I don't want to think of him right now. I'm sorry."
The club's walls were also just bricks but plastered with posters and stickers from small bands, to an extent that the underlying wall was barely visible anymore. To the right of the staircase was a beat down door that led to the club's bathrooms, and between the door and stage a gigantic, dark red couch was situated against the wall. When the club was crowded the couch usually didn't offer any free spots, even though it could easily seat ten people at a time, twelve if everyone was tipsy and personal space became less of an issue.
The room was empty.
The days following were marked by Cas's constant presence in Dean's everyday life. They talked before Dean had to go to work, sometimes to get him into a better mindset, other times to try and get him out of bed in the first place. Cas would call during Dean's lunch break, which he only started taking after he confessed to Cas that he sometimes was shaking all over after work from pure exhaustion. Cas had told him that eighteen dollars wasn't worth the damage to his health, and he made him take a half-hour break with a snack. The best part about those was not only calling with Cas, but pulling out whatever he had made for Dean in the days prior. A turkey sandwich, fruit and vegetables with high-protein cream cheese, sometimes a muffin too. Dean was at Cas's house daily, getting help with his laundry or finally having his hair cut by the stylist who visited Cas. He was showering regularly, had some clean clothes, and was well fed.
“I'm sorry.” Dean turned sideways. He ran his fingers along the cool metal of the small pet door.
For one wild second Dean's brain jumps to what a firework with Cas would feel like, and there are blinks of images in his mind of wings and lips and strong fingers.
Dean scrubbed and scrubbed at the grime under his nails. Work had been exhausting; two sick colleagues from hayfever meant extra work for Dean. Additional money, too, but he was incredibly tired. He wouldn't miss his date with Cas even four broken limbs though, so even with an aching back and the start of a headache, he drove over to Cas's.
I'm so sorry this took longer than I planned (again). I lost my motivation a little because I was unsure how to proceed with the story (mainly how to get from point A to point B), but I've figured it out now and this will update quicker.
After Cas was safely on the bed, Sam went and picked up their first aid kit from the car while Dean raided the bathroom for towels and the mini bar for vodka to disinfect Cas' wounds.
“Fucking romantics,” Dean says as he takes another bite of his food. “It’s been what, a month since he said he’d ask her? What took him so long? I swear they picked a summer date because they want to use you for your plants, you know that, right?”
Cas gets up and hugs Eileen too, and Dean feels like dancing.
“I think you'll like it then. I'll be right back.”
“No, but if this conversation continues in this direction I’ll apparently be affianced to you.”
Cas looks bashful, as if Dean has just uncovered a secret.
“I love you,” Cas replied as if it was the most natural thing in the world. And maybe it was.
Cas noticed him looking, turned his head, and smiled at him. Dean mirrored his expression and they just grinned at each other like idiots.
Cas reached between them, and with a few strokes to his cock Dean was coming, long and hard, and clenched down on Cas so hard Cas’s mouth fell open. His hips stuttered briefly before stilling deep within Dean. They clung to each other as they came, sharing kisses. After a few minutes Cas pulled out slowly, tied off the condom and just dropped it on the floor. He pulled Dean to him, hugging him tight and Dean wound his arms around him. Together they waited for their breathing to slow, the flickering of the candles dipping everything into golden warmth.
“Why aren't you talking to me face to face? You know, whatever it is, I don't judge. I got enough baggage of my own to know what it feels like.” Dean shifted and his leg brushed the door.
Sam chuckled and slid his computer over the table towards Dean. "You should check some news sites for anything about Kelly. Also.. I think you need more sleep?"
“So in Wichita, do you think you guys will— hey Cas!”
"Sure," Dean said. "And yes to that burger place. I should be done here at five, but I'll let you know." Dean took another bite of his dessert, a Granny Smith apple today, and noticed his boss giving him the stink eye. "Think my break's over. I'll see you later."
Eileen nods, and Sam’s face softens. “We’ll keep working on the spell.”
Dean looks at himself, and grimaces. He looks awful. His face is cut up, though the blood is cleaned away. There’s a bandage around his head, his left arm is in a cast, as is his right calf. A tube is in his throat. He can’t remember breaking his arm or his leg, but he also can’t remember a whole lot besides the pain in his head, and his overloaded senses.
Dean huffed at that, but Cas continued, "I can only guess how Sam feels right now, he cannot understand the pain you're feeling over all of this because he never was in the situation you are in right now, not from your point of view. Don't be angry at him for something he can't understand, but try to explain it to him in a matter that will make it clearer."
“I should get going,” Cas says. “Don’t worry, I’m going home.”
“No.”
"Hey, look at me. Cas." The angel flicked his eyes to Dean's face, a second and then third tear making their way down his cheeks. The hunter wiped them away with his thumbs, a pained look on his face as he tries to grasp the amount of pain that Cas must have gone through and is apparently still trying to deal with.
“Hey.”
“I’m a veteran too,” he says after a few minutes. “I had to stop therapy because I lost my job and insurance. There’s,” Cas swallows, “there are some things I haven’t worked through yet. But I can’t afford help at the moment.”
They circle back to the car, several full bags in their hands. They bought a little stand with several fresh herbs in little clay pots, and it was absolutely Dean's idea, and he can't wait to put fresh basil on the homemade pizza later.
Dean felt his face warming at Cas' words and gave him a lopsided smile.
Dean stares.
After a minute the cat door was held open by a hand, and a yellow post-it was stuck to the frame of it. Dean bent down to read it.
“Gabe?” He asked and lifted his hand to grab Gabriel's chin. He turned his head towards him and studied the bruise on his left jaw, as well as the small amount of dried blood under his nose. “What happened?”
They name her Mary, and Dean loves her the first time he holds her. She has tufts of dark hair, brilliant blue eyes and falls asleep a minute after Cas places her back in Eileen’s arms.
“I don’t think I should-”
"Hey, do you have popcorn?"
Time spent at his apartment was pretty much never comfortable, or nice. An empty fridge was a staple of any Winchester home, along with an outdated kitchen with lime green cabinets, a third-hand couch with questionable stains and a cheap wooden bed frame holding a mattress so thin Dean woke up with a hurting back every other day. The part of town he lived in was generally considered cheap, unsafe and for the desperate. Even for his area, his apartment was lucky. He had a bedroom, a tiny bathroom and a small living room with an open kitchen. He usually just ate on the couch or standing up leaning against the counter, just like right now. Munching a bowl of off-brand cheerios with milk that was just this side of off. He polished off the bowl within five minutes, rinsed it and just left it in the sink. He put on his non-work boots and headed out.
“So, does your garden look like your front yard?” Dean chewed on the half-melted Snickers he’d found in his jeans pocket. The patio was warm through his pants, hot from the morning sun that had now wandered and was blocked by the roof. He had come to Cas’s straight from work, starved from missing breakfast and eight hours of physical labor. If you had no money for groceries, breakfast wasn't on the schedule.
