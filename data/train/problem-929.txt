Mycroft just shook his head.
“Uncle Myc!” shouted Rosie and went to hug him.
“But you hit him. You hit someone from the Met. You even broke his nose,” Sherlock interrupted again.
Rosie beamed and hugged Sherlock. “Papa’s proud!” she exclaimed.
“Yes, well, perhaps you should keep that truth to yourself,” suggested John.
“Are you mad at me for throwing sand at him?” she looked at him fearfully.
“What do you mean, “a boy pushed me”, Rosie?” worriedly asked John. “Sherlock? What happened?” He turned to Sherlock.
“That one in the green jumper,” she sniffed. “And he destroyed my sandcastles too.”
“But uncle Mycroft wasn’t,” she pouted.
“Sherlock, please. For me,” pleaded John and squeezed Sherlock’s knee.
“Don’t you ever insult Sherlock again. Do you hear me?” he said in a dangerously low and calm voice. “Don’t forget, I’m a doctor, I know exactly which bones I could break. I know how I can ruin your life. One more bad word about Sherlock and you would wish you had never been born. Is that clear?” He then turned to Sherlock. “Come on, we’re going home.”
“Papa said I could tell you about a mean boy at the playground,” Rosie quietly started after she ate her chocolate ice-cream.
Rosie’s eyes shot wide open. “Papa is a queen? So I really am a princess then?”
“But papa’s proud of me!” grinned Rosie, as if that was the most important thing that has ever happened to her.
Sherlock beamed. His John. His kind, good-hearted, loving John. His knight in shining armour.
It was a warm summer day and Sherlock decided to take her to the playground nearby. There were already a lot of children and their parents but Sherlock managed to find a bench near the sandpit.
If John hadn’t watched Sherlock, he wouldn’t have noticed the hurt look in his eyes before Sherlock quickly turned away from them. Usually, he would say something back, something witty and maybe even cruel, but not today. Today he promised John he would try to be civil and not insult anybody. Anderson was making it really hard for him but he had to at least try. For John. He would do anything for John.
John laughed a little. “Well, yeah, I guess I did. But he did have a weird nose. He might be grateful I broke it, that way he would be forced to get a nose job.”
“No, he’s just being a drama queen,” added Lestrade.
Rosie nodded and went to play in the sandpit. She was playing quietly for about half an hour, making at least ten different sandcastles, decorating them with pebbles, when suddenly a young boy, just one year or two older than Rosie, began destroying Rosie’s sandcastles. She at first politely told him to stop doing that, but when he kept destroying her creations she picked up some sand and threw it at him. He then pushed her into the sand. Rosie began crying and Sherlock came rushing to her, afraid she’d hurt herself.
“Sherlock, stop being so dramatic,” laughed John. “Maybe you should just delete it.”
“What for?” was confused Sherlock.
She grinned. “Okay. So, because he kept kicking my castles I picked up some sand and threw it at him.”
“Pinky promise?” suggested Rosie.
They were sitting in an ice-cream parlour when suddenly Mycroft came by.
“I think that’s enough, Anderson,” firmly said John.
“Rosie!” chastised Mycroft.
“Sherlock, language,” warned John but he quickly began laughing. “Really, Greg? Is Mycroft really important to you?”
Sherlock ignored him and tried to do his job but Anderson wouldn’t have it.
“Did you suddenly go deaf?” he laughed.
“Mycroft, the boy was being rude. And she already told him to stop. She took matters into her own hands. I’m quite proud of her.”
John kept laughing while Sherlock looked like he was going to be sick in a minute. “Lestrade, what exactly are you doing when you are supposed to be babysitting my daughter?”
John spent most of his days at the clinic while Sherlock babysat Rosie. She loved walking around with him and sometimes he even took her to solve cases with him.
“I heard you telling him when you thought I was asleep last month,” smirked Rosie in a very Holmesian way.
“Why did you hit him?” interrupted Sherlock.
Lestrade slightly blushed. Sherlock’s smirk turned into a grimace. “Lestrade! Are you shagging my brother? Agh!”
Sherlock chuckled and kissed John. “Thank you. No one ever did that for me.”
Rosie Watson was a very happy five-year-old. Her dads, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were spoiling her rotten. Physically, she looked a lot like John, but her character was the same as Sherlock’s. Nurture over nature, as John often complained.
As soon as they arrived to the crime scene, John saw Anderson making his way towards them. He sighed internally and prepared for the inevitable.
When Sherlock and Rosie got back home John was already there watching telly with Lestrade.
John smiled. “Well, I’m glad to be your knight in shining armour then.”
“Papa isn’t mad,” said John.
“Maybe I will!” declared Sherlock and stomped out.
“I did something that wasn’t nice, uncle Myc. Don’t be mad at me,” she said in a small voice.
“Uncle Greg!” shouted Rosie and jumped on the couch.
Sherlock smiled. “Of course, sweetie. I will always be proud of you.” He reassured her and kissed her goodnight. “Sweet dreams.”
Mycroft lifted his eyebrows. “A mean boy? Rosie, what happened?” He was quickly becoming concerned. Rosie usually didn’t call anyone “mean”.
“We didn’t do anything, we just talked!” defended Lestrade. “Honestly, Sherlock, do you think Myc would do anything in front of a child?”
Rosie pouted in a very Sherlockian way (one could swear he was her biological father, not John). “Rosie. Not Rosamund. Too long.”
“Yes! Ice-cream!” Rosie exclaimed with joy.
Later that night, when Sherlock was reading Rosie a good night story (yes John, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is suited for children!), she looked at him and quietly asked: “Papa, will you always be proud of me? Even when I do something stupid?”
Rosie gasped. “Papa! Uncle Mycroft is very important! Right, uncle Greg?”
“No,” smiled Sherlock. “He deserved it. And when we get home you can tell uncle Mycroft and uncle Gavin about him.”
“And can you imagine him as a child?” Anderson shuddered. “Even his parents probably wanted to get rid of him.”
Sherlock followed him, still shocked and confused. Why would John do something like that? For him?
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m not insulting them, John, I’m merely stating the obvious. It’s not my fault they can’t handle the truth.”
“You’re awfully quiet, Sherlock,” remarked John when they were on their way home. “You really shouldn’t believe anything Anderson said, you know he is-”
Rosie giggled. “Uncle Gavin? Papa, his name is Greg!”
“Uncle Myc, you promised!” reminded Rosie. “Papa said he deserved it.”
“How did he even get you to be his flatmate? Did he hypnotise you? I mean, who would voluntarily live with Sherlock Holmes? Really, John, I have no idea how you can put up with his obnoxious and creepy personality,” continued Anderson, oblivious to the anger that was boiling inside John.
“Sweetie, are you all right? What happened?” he asked her and checked her for any visible injuries.
“I’m talking to you, Freak,” shouted Anderson. “Did you finally come to terms that you are a psychopath who only solves crimes because they turn you on? Because they turn on a freak like you?”
“I promise I won’t be mad, Rosie,” promised Mycroft.
“Why is papa mad?” was concerned Rosie. “Daddy?” She looked at John.
“Hello, princess,” smiled Lestrade and kissed her nose. “Did you have fun today?”
"Of what?" Lestrade asked with a confused look on his face.
The genius' eyebrows furrowed with caution, and John watched as one of Sherlock's hands reached halfway out towards him and was immediately pulled back towards his chest. "Okay? I mean...Are you alright?" he frowned to himself, clearly unfamiliar if uncomfortable with expressing emotional concern outwardly.
John hummed in response, closing his eyes.
The suited man blinked, refocusing on the road and slowing at an approaching red light.
"Yes," John interrupted, something like jealousy rising to his chest. "He often comes across older than he is."
"Sherlock! You could get arrested for that!"
Sherlock forced his lips to lift to a hollow smile, holding the door open for his teacher and disregarding the sickliness settling in his stomach.
John chuckled. "To be honest I think I like the sound of that better," he joked, shaking his head.
John spotted Greg Lestrade almost immediately, rushing to where he was ushering his tutor group together. "Greg! Do you know what's going on?"
"John, please-" he pleaded, aware of the vulnerability in his own voice. "Please-"
"There is no reason. I don't need courtesy from
_______________________________________________________________________________

"You brought us here!" John cried, propping himself up on his elbow to face the young man properly. "You organised all this, the gorgeous cottage, the remote town, just so we could be ourselves, and be alone. Tell me that's not romantic."
"Do you think I'm going to break your heart? Is that it?" John's voice was sudden, tinged with emotion.
Sherlock ignored the jolt in his chest at the endearment, reaching immediately into the breast pocket of John's quilted coat and producing the small silver key to him.
Sherlock frowned in return, moving closer to Dr Watson's desk. "I don't know. That's the frustrating part"
"Did you ever tell anybody?" He asked after a long while of silence, shifting closer to Sherlock's body on top of the rustling covers.
"You're being late on purpose?" Sherlock noticed a look of confusion pass Dr Watson's face.
"Shit," Greg swallowed another mouthful. "Sure you could take him on though, you're a soldier!"
Gregory Lestrade had had his fair share of run ins with Sherlock Holmes.
"So, you deny any romantic affiliation between my brother and yourself?" the elder Holmes asked directly.
Sherlock fiddled with a loose thread hanging from his sleeve and focused on the direction of his feet until he heard an additional set of irregular footsteps behind him and turned.
Sherlock's head tilted, watching colour seep into John's cheeks, who had abruptly quietened, staring hard at the wall behind Sherlock's head.
"I know, goodbye"
"My parents are dead" Sherlock replied, blinking back at John.
"Have you said goodbye to John yet? It was your last Biology exam, after all. I'm sure he'd appreciate a visit from you, Sherlock." Greg suggested innocently enough, his eyes trained on the groups of students around them.
The teacher clenched his fists at his sides, flexing and releasing in a rhythm that almost began to feel therapeutic until he realised where he was, who he was with, and what was likely to happen next.
"Yes, but I can see what the secrecy of our relationship has been doing to you, John." Sherlock spoke with a voice filled with such wisdom John found himself completely awestruck by the reminder of the actual age-gap between them.
"So you just decided not to come in? You're missing important lessons"
"Morning, love." he smiled, feeling Sherlock's cheek against his heart.
Missed call (x6) Greg Lestrade
Confused at the tone of Sherlock's writing, John debated on a reply, typing out the start and then quickly deleting it, deciding to bite the bullet and call him.
"I can imagine you here," John admitted, looking up at the man next to him. "Running around with a tiny microscope, conducting your mould experiments and measuring the consistency of snail trails."
"He thinks he is more intelligent than me, John, did you see the way he looked at me today, and the way he looked at
"Well, either way, I'm glad you enjoyed it. You're filling out a bit too, in a good way." He emerged from the kitchen, walking around to the sofa adjacent to Sherlock's chair and throwing himself onto it with an 'oof'.
"Excellent." The other man grinned toothily, clearly relieved and shaking a stunned John's hand quickly; excusing himself to attend his second period meeting. "Thanks, John-"
"I could hardly disobey direct orders from my tutor and my teacher. Besides, Mycroft threatened to confiscate my taxidermy collection if I didn't come."
"I understand that, Madam, however there really aren't any other solutions I can-" The quiet voice drifted into hearing distance, as Greg hovered unsurely near the door to Mycroft Holmes' office.
"And don't say you don't know what I'm talking about, because you
Sherlock frowned with confusion back at him, watching the doctor lay on his back on his own side of the bed, turning onto his side and putting his hand under the pillow his head lay on. He looked up at Sherlock expectantly, and Sherlock joined him on top of the covers, lying on his back for a moment until he felt comfortable to face John on his own side.
"Mm, John. Not tired." His eyebrow furrowed, eyes still closed, and John pressed his thumb to the persistent dent between his eyes, immediately smoothing it out. He trailed his hand down Sherlock's cheek, his fingers falling naturally back to his hair.
John found himself wondering if it was just the mystery that attracted his interest in Sherlock Holmes...he had never felt...
Sherlock had the decency to step away, acting nonchalant as best as he could, and turning to tidy a stack of test-tubes which had been stacked haphazardly into their holding containers by a previous class.
Sherlock went still, and John feared he'd gone too far, knowing of Sherlock's difficulty to process emotion on occasion. He'd just about worked up an entire rambling apology in his head and was about to release it when Sherlock leant forward to close the gap between their lips, effectively silencing him.
Before John could reply, Mycroft had turned the corner and left, the click-clack of his shoes fading away from the room, his presence replaced with that of a young woman wearing a sharp pencil skirt, tapping away on her phone.
"Are you seriously smoking right now, Sherlock? Seriously?" John scolded as soon as he rounded the corner, raising his voice at the man with the lighter in his hand.
"No! I mean- I wouldn't want to... hurt his feelings?"
"A school trip?" Sherlock repeated, voice dripping with disdain.
"Right, good. Yes." Greg nodded to himself, "So."
Sherlock groaned, pushed down the hand-brake and pulled himself out of the car.
But his body thought otherwise, and apparently, so did Sherlock's.
Mycroft took one pointed look at the head-teacher who was settling down in his own leather chair, one which had clearly dimpled from his weight, and remained standing.
He nodded with a slight exhale of breath, staring down at John's feet directly opposite his.
"A teacher, apparently."
"Oh hello, dear" she cooed, pulling in her cleaning trolley.
"Neither do I," He said at last, but let his hand fall from the surface of bricked wall behind John's head.
"Of course. It's just...not a realistic situation." John shook his head, scratching his fingernails against the grain of the polished wooden surface of the bar.
"Okay--" he sighed, "Good, that's..."
His hands reached for John's again, managing to pull them apart this time, taking the initiative to thread his fingers through and wait for the shaking to steady.
"I do for my age-"
Sherlock smiled as the line went dead, pocketing his phone and looking back out the window to the dark night.
"Huh?" He blinked slowly, aware of an unattractive line of drool beginning to slide out of his mouth. He swiped at it quickly, eyes refocusing on the iciness of the blue irises across from him. His eyes fell to the defined bow of an upper-lip not too far away from his own lips.
"Good things are too often destroyed." Sherlock spoke in his baritone voice, his eyes speaking of sadness.
can help it, John." He hissed. "If people would stop getting in my way as usual-"
"Sherlock!"
John watched him for a while, until he too dropped to the floor next to him, slightly slower and less agile because of his leg, but hitching himself upwards , hands sifting the gravel from the ground in fistfuls.
My sincerest apologies for the amount of time it has been since my last update. Life very much got in the way, but it seems to be co-operating now, and we are now nearing the end of Fire and Ice!
John cleared his throat and uncrossed his legs in his chair. "I suppose. Not really, why?"
"I don't know," John turned back to the mirror to admire his new moustache. "I kind of like it, it's growing on me I think."
When Sherlock was predictably reminded that he would be working alone again by the vacant stares he was receiving from the eyes around him, he stretched back in his seat and then pulled his textbooks closer on his desk to send a clear message of the wish to be left alone.
Sherlock stood immediately, "Do I make you nervous?"
Once again he was struck by the grandeur of the building as he climbed the winding staircase, it really was breathtaking, no matter how many times you happened to step foot in the place. The thought of growing up in mansions like these made Greg want to question why on earth he was even allowed to be in the Holmes' presence. He knew that he himself, having grown up on a small shabby terraced estate full of poor working-class families, wouldn't have been given a second glance by either of the brothers if they hadn't of been introduced in other ways determined by the universe...
Sherlock looked at him. "Don't."
__________________________________________________________________________________
Sherlock met him at a summer camp his parents dragged him along to while Mycroft was off on some fox-hunting trip with his boarding school. It was clearly somewhere for the refined, the 52 acre stretch of land hosted golf clubs, spas and royal baths, cricket and tennis courts; anything you could possibly imagine in an upper-class lodge. Sherlock hated it.
"Sherlock, what is wrong? You are moping around like a puppy who's had his tail stepped on" Mrs Hudson tutted, pushing the sweeping brush in a circle around him as he sat refusing to move to accommodate her cleaning.
Eventually having settled wasting the day away indoors, he switched on the TV to a repeat of some crime drama from Thursday night and wandered over to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea.
"Lestrade sent me up here to say goodbye to you."  he said as soon as he entered the room, only just noticing that John had another student in his classroom with him. John looked towards Sherlock as he closed the door behind him and stood quietly in front of it.
__________________________________________________________________________________
John settled back in his chair, stretching his arms behind his head. "You could never hate me"
"Because I don't want you to be expelled, that's why" John huffed, stretching on his tip-toes to reach the title at the top.
instead of previous observers whom Sherlock had noticed immediately, accusing them of having as much stealth as elephants in a library.
"After, then? Will you wait for me? We can go somewhere, just us, please?"
"Sherlock!" Greg shouted, the wind carrying most of the sound away from his student's ears. "What the hell are you doing?"
"In this weather? You'll freeze to death" John insisted with a chatter to his teeth, hands rubbing together to trap the warmth in.
He passed him in a huff when he rounded the corner towards the exit, resolutely ignoring Anderson's sly comment about
And with that, Sherlock's walls came crashing down, those polluted waters burst free from the dams he had built and rebuilt himself, and rushed outwards, rushed towards John. And he knew he would never doubt John Watson again. Would never doubt his intentions, his focus, his overwhelmingly virtuous and willing heart. He would never doubt the security he found in John's eyes. Would never doubt the strength of the soldier, the graciousness of the doctor, the irrevocable pull of John Watson.
"Well, I think you'll find that if you refer to the syllabus-" Anderson started, and Sherlock laughed loudly to interrupt him. "What is so funny?!"
"What?" Sherlock breathed, feeling himself getting even harder at the image of John's hand wrapped around his flushed cock.
"Put it back," John raised his eyebrows at him, moving towards a collection of traditional leather bomber jackets, with badges sewn into the arms and breast pocket.
Surprised to be addressed, the teacher looked up to Sherlock, exposing the suppressed panic in his eyes. Sherlock had been driving for two hours before he noticed the sudden increase of shiftiness, John had been checking his phone, biting his nails, tapping his foot, glancing out of the window often, and a slight sheen of sweat had begun to form around his hairline.
Sherlock gaped at Mycroft. "What?"
"Yeah, it's pissing out." John brushed a kiss across her cheek. "Got colder, too."
"Look, John, look for God' s sake!" Sherlock waved the letter impatiently. "This is a letter from Lord Moran's younger brother Sebastian, written in the early eighties, addressed to 'Dear Steenie.'
"Right, right,
Sherlock nodded. "Just for the time being."
He heard John coming down the stairs and heading into the loo, and then the sound of running water.
Sherlock grinned, seeing the tooth marks on Henry's hand.
Sherlock heaved a sigh. "No, I'm not." He'd wrapped his knee with a compression bandage and that had helped, but it still hurt.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and winced as the pressure spiked again. Afraid he was going to vomit, he took a deep breath, then another, then another.
Maybe patience wasn’t his strong suit after all.
"Give me a week, John. Five – no, three days. Please."
He leant down, grabbed the tube, and climbed on the bed, kneeling between TWH's spread legs.
That was good.
The smile disappeared entirely. "It varies from guarantor to guarantor. Remuneration can be netted against the final purchase price – we state that quite clearly on our catalogues. And in any case, I'm afraid that information is confidential. We're a private firm, Mr Holmes, and not obliged to disclose our financials."
Tom leant close and whispered in Sherlock's ear. "Don't fall asleep, Ben." He slid his hand down from Sherlock's chest to his belly and stroked in slow, languorous circles.
"John –"
"Howeryeh," the old party replied laconically. "That's three-twenty-seven. Petrol today?"
The sudden illicit elation he'd felt upon calling Fann and begging off was nothing to the contentment that glowed like hot embers as he sat on this comfortable and expensive sofa in a corporate playground, watching grown men and women chatter and cavort like ten-year-old kids.
"Henry, please – please –" Tom shrank back as Henry plucked the tea towel from his shoulder and dragged the watering can forward. He shook his head as realisation dawned quickly. "Henry, please, for God's sake –" A thin wail escaped him as the towel settled over his face, and then cold wetness plastered the fabric to his skin.
Mary briefly met John's puzzled gaze before turning to answer. "It's called a trust fund, darling. You had a bit of money put into it when you were born, and again when you reached the age of seven. But now you have quite a bit more. Look at that."
"Thanks for letting me sleep," Mary said, tousling Nora's hair.
Sherlock gave a quick, negative shake of his head, as if to wish John away. John's heart plummeted toward the floor. But then Sherlock's eyes met his. "I forgive you," he said softly.
Slowly, Tom shook his head. No. No.
was Henreid. She'd introduced them both as he'd stepped off the plane:  Lance Corporals Henreid and Farrow. "No vehicles. Recent tyre tracks, though."
"It's really something," John said, stripping off his shirt. "Some art dealer got poisoned, and Sherlock thinks that Lord Moran is involved. Remember him, the tube bomber? Or previous suspect tube bomber. I still think he did it."
Oh, God, another tactical error. Thank God John wasn't around; he'd have been twitting Sherlock liberally over his slipups.
The sound system, discreetly hidden away, hummed out a very satisfying rendition of ‘O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion,’ a recording from St Paul, Minnesota of all places, but featuring one of the most extraordinary countertenors he’d ever heard. Reaching blindly for his drink, Mycroft scrolled through his correspondence, making notes here and there.
"Yeah, of course you." Benedict felt his chest loosening a little. This was something he could talk about with utter ease, and who didn't like hearing about themselves, even weird alternate universe versions of themselves? "Martin Freeman plays John Watson. He's brilliant, he's just like…well, he does a really great job at being you."
“Yeah, I’ll tell him,” Miranda said, a note of irony in her voice. “Go on, go kiss the kids.”
"The celebrated Mr. Holmes," said a purring feminine voice.
He put the phone to his ear. "I'm eating lunch. What?"
"Yes," Benedict said. "You don't seem too surprised. Do you kn –"
Playing gay still got the fish-eye in too many quarters. It was bad enough being photographed on the street coming home a bit squiffy after a party, or at lunch with Tom, but he truly loathed dealing in the cheap currency of rumour. He and Tom had decided to be discreet. His private life was firmly private, and Tom had too many decks stacked against him at the moment, and the more he was able to distance himself from unpleasantness, the better.
—" A heavy arm crushed Sherlock's windpipe, and he felt himself dragged up against a broad chest. "You're fucked next time I see you," the voice whispered in his ear, and the arm let go and heaved Sherlock forward.
Tom came to the table and picked his glass up. "I feel like we should toast."
"Yeah, he's been with Amanda for ages. They're great. And his children are lovely – sweet, naughty little things." Wistful, Benedict smiled.
"Up," John said sternly, and Sherlock finally obeyed with a groan. "Thank you. Unbutton, please." Swiftly, he seated the scope in his ears and laid the drum against Sherlock's chest.
with his lips, he'd have denied it vehemently.
"You murdered Mycroft's dearest friend, and my best friend's wife. What made you think that we could possibly forgive that?"
That was Martin's voice. Of course it was. He opened his eyes, and there was Martin, kneeling over him in a khaki-coloured t-shirt and a worn blue cardigan. No makeup; he must have washed it off. Benedict smiled tentatively. "Hey."
Benedict gazed steadily at her. "Don't tell me. Your whole life is on this phone."
Mycroft clenched his teeth. "We're going to hospital so you can drink a few litres of charcoal and have your stomach pumped, that's why. Get your goddamned coat, Sherlock."
"Why? You said it yourself – there's nothing to be done but wait. Besides, it's not Cumberbatch who's –" He broke off, tightening his mouth.
TWH, TWH, TWH, TWH. Most recent text three minutes ago.
Kate drove away, easing smoothly onto the motorway and accelerating. She turned on the radio and listened to something syrupy, pretty – Debussy, maybe – nothing Irene would have liked. Irene preferred the crystalline perfection of baroque music, its symmetry and seamlessness.
Morstan
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm absolutely fine. I was only in jail for an hour. Knowing your brother has its perks." John frowned at Sherlock's paleness. "How are you? Did you go to hospital?"
A maroon-jacketed, spotty young man was pulling up in Tom's car. He got out and held one door open whilst another maroon-jacketed, equally spotty young woman held the other. Tom and Sherlock got in, belted up, and Tom drove away.
spent the night here? Jesus, just walking in the door gives me the creeps."
"But you think it was pressure drop?" John tentatively pulled his hand away from his nose. He was getting used to the smell. One got used to frequent odours in 221B; the problem was that he thought he was becoming desensitised to it. More than once he'd brought a girlfriend by and watched, chagrined, as they'd wrinkled their noses in disgust. "Not the usual bachelor-flat fragrance, is it?" Sarah had chirped gamely. Hers had been by far the kindest reaction.
"What?" Jarred out of his reverie, Sherlock blinked in confusion.
Sherlock blinked and felt his knees buckle a bit. Casually, he reached out and rested a hand on the brass footboard.
"I'll use the other room and tell the staff to let themselves in with the tea. You sleep."
"He's not staying long, Mrs H." Benedict stared narrowly at Moriarty, but he was terribly afraid that Moriarty saw something – the twitch of an eyelid, his rapid pulse, the tense flexing of the muscles in his legs – and was just holding back his triumph.
"Hey." That emerged a little more strongly.
"Oh, no. I'm fine, absolutely fine," Sherlock said, getting to his feet. Wobbly. Still a bit wobbly. "You're very kind, Mr…?"
John jerked the scarf away and bunched it in one hand. Instant heat rose in his face. "Yeah. Noxious chemical compounds and rubbish skips, mostly. Your hat doesn't smell, does it?"
An evening with more pampered, self-absorbed, histrionic morons. Sherlock had once had a client whose daughter went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (a commonality in this universe even duller than Internet Explorer, imagine) and talking to her had been purest agony. He couldn't think of anything less fun than dinner with actors.
"Not obvious. Hey, quit sniffing at it. You're not meant to be that close to it."
"Right. Sorry." Benedict went back to the door. "I was just wondering if you wanted some tea."
"Of course I haven't! For God's sake!"
"I don't have a twin," the man droned with exaggerated patience. "I do have brothers, though, and fortunately I don't resemble either of them." He leant against the wall, the picture of forbearance.
"Maybe she was going to blow the whistle," John hazarded.
Nora sighed. "It doesn't fit you anymore, Dad." She shook her head at him, not with contempt or rebellion, but with a weary patience, as if John was a terribly slow learner. And she was right – it had got shrunk in the wash accidentally, but it was the principle of the thing.
"Sorry, I'll warm it next time. Shh." John listened, then straightened. "Okay, turn round a bit so I can listen to your lungs."
"Jesus." John reached out and grasped Mary's small hand, massaging it gently. His own family had fallen away in fits and starts over the years; now there was only Harry, still wandering in and out of bouts with the bottle. He wondered if Harry would come to his funeral, if he died first. He'd go to hers. Bad as the blood sometimes –
Sherlock sat back, chest heaving. "If you harm her – if you or your vile excuses for arse-kissing lackeys lay so much as a finger on her – then I'll kill you with my bare hands. I promise you that."
"No." Sherlock shook his head and clenched his teeth. "I'm just cold."
John turned to her and gave her a tight smile. "Why's that?"
"I don't think anyone's here," Sherlock said, and pulled his own phone from his pocket. He turned the light on and moved down the hallway, shining his light this way and that. "Small wonder Lord Moran doesn't live here year-round. The heating bills alone would wipe him out by April."
"John."
"It's quicker if I drive –"
Sherlock set the phone on the table and stretched out on the sofa, considering his dinner options. There were the contents of his fridge – nil, actually, so that was out. There was the usual fish and chips from the shop round the corner, only a text away. There was a Speedy's sandwich and crisps, another text away. And there was the five-hundred quid voucher to Corrigan's Mayfair, the gift of a grateful client. 'Take your best lady friend,' the client had said, to which Sherlock had responded with a wintry stare. 'Or your best fellow.' Sherlock said nothing. The client had loosened his tie and swallowed. 'Or they might deliver. I'll make certain they do.' So there was that.
Birds called to each other, invisible in the trees heavy with late-summer leaves as Sherlock let himself into Tom's house. He disarmed the security panel – must remember to puzzle out how he knew the code later – and trudged back into the room Tom used as a study. He took out the letter, opened it, and read.
"Tell me about your day," Tom prompted.
"You know what I mean."
“Yep.” Janine nodded triumphantly and took a drink. “God, let’s stop talking about Sherlock Holmes. I’m in the city this week and I haven’t got anyone but those tossers back at the pub to hang out with, and I’m sick of them already. What are you doing tomorrow? I don’t want to intrude on your Christmas plans, but if you fancied a stroll through the shops, I’m free.”
They'd agreed to keep things quiet. For now, at least. They were both getting good roles, seeing some acclaim for their work. No point in torpedoing everything before it even got off the ground.
"Considering the preponderance of valuables, I'm not surprised."
Benedict stiffened and turned back to Sherlock. "Tom."
Sherlock nodded hazily, though he wasn't certain that getting up and walking would be all that easy. He allowed Tom to take his hand and pull him up and then crush him close.
His phone chirped in the kitchen – Sherlock’s ringtone. Sighing, Greg heaved himself up and went to fetch it. He hoped it wasn’t urgent.
Sherlock beamed. "Nothing. Talk away." He moved past Tom into the bedroom and flopped down on the bed, toeing his shoes off. Comfortable. He was actually a bit drowsy.
Moriarty bit his lower lip and raised his eyebrows. "Not so much as a peep! Good boy, Sherlock." He leant close, and Benedict smelled mint chewing gum. "About time you've sorted out how to behave when the occasion demands it."
John stifled a tremor. Somewhere in that house, Sherlock was a captive, in Jim Moriarty's power. Moriarty might well have a small army lying in wait, but John doubted it. They'd done a concentric reconnaissance of the perimeter and if Henreid was to be believed, they had every electronic detection and tracking device it was possible to possess. There had been no camera interference, no laser wires, no sound detection; the place might as well have been deserted.  They couldn't have left already?
"It's fine," Sherlock repeated.
Though he tried for an air of nonchalance, Sherlock couldn't quite keep his eyes off John, who'd elected to sit in the row opposite Sherlock since they had the plane practically to themselves. There was a woman with two Abyssinian cats (heavily medicated but still complaining mournfully at their plight) who'd spread the cages and her possessions across two rows and was now watching a television comedy with an annoying laugh track on her tablet – otherwise, the flight was empty. They hadn't, unfortunately, been able to secure seats with the charter firm; a two-aeroplane outfit, they'd informed Mycroft's assistants that they wouldn't be available for another two days, but the pilot would be happy to speak with Sherlock then. Hence, they'd been obliged to take a puddle-jumper commuter flight, which Sherlock suspected was Mycroft's revenge for showing him up in front of John.
He would have liked to have texted John. But there were sure to be unpleasant revelations at this meeting, and it was just possible that John wouldn't be an asset. Too, it was possible that Sherlock could sort things out before John discovered the worst. He didn't want Mary to suffer, whatever she'd done. He had no faith in her and precious little love any longer, but she was still tied to John through marriage, through Eleanor. It was naïve optimism to believe that their parting wouldn't be acrimonious, but a tiny shred of hope remained that Mary would be grateful to Sherlock for preserving John from the bulk of the truth. Sherlock would remind her, if necessary. He wasn't above that.
"Thought you'd be out clubbing with a bird on each arm."
"Yes," Sherlock insisted. "He's coming back with Seb Moran and his other thug and God knows who else. We've got to be prepared. And we can't miss." Slowly, Sherlock toiled up the staircase.
"You're sure you're okay?"
He couldn't look after them now – they'd have to fend for themselves. John grasped the large brass handle and turned it, and the door creaked open, revealing only a pitch-black corridor. He immediately slid to the side and waited.
"A bit early, but yes, I'd say so."
TWH didn't move. He sat in the chair, trembling, trying to catch his breath but not quite getting there.
Sherlock sniffled and cringed away, noticing Henry's relaxed stance, the way his tongue crept out to swipe at the corner of his mouth, the confident upward tilt of his chin.
"When you've recovered," Mycroft said, "I have something that might be of interest to you."
"If he's avoiding us I'm certain he's got other ways of slipping out. Probably CCTV, as well."
They walked in silence to the place Janine had chosen, a piano bar with low lighting and pink banquettes. Janine ordered a Dark and Stormy and turned to Molly. “What’ll you have?”
As they pulled into the drive and rolled toward the house, Tom asked, "How'd you know the route?" The question was delivered in an incurious tone, though, as if the answer didn't matter much.
He paged through a magazine without seeing any of the pictures or articles. His last conversation with another doctor on Mary's case (he'd forgot the name of the doctor, a tall, stooped, wiry man with wire-rimmed spectacles), seven hours ago, clanged noisily in his head, obliterating any hope of distraction.
"Oh, come on," Henry said, and took a swig from the beer glass, draining the whisky in a draught. Ice clinked musically. "Not even Peter is that much of a prick. I tried to get him to come, but he's busy tonight banging some bird, apparently."
had happened. The odd bit was that during that moment of communion – sticky as the word was, it fit the situation best – with his doppelganger, he hadn't felt any of the known symptoms of electrical shock. On the contrary, he'd felt perfectly lucid and healthy, which was likely why none of the drug or shock-related indicators had occurred to him, and the myriad wonders of the realm of physics had done.
broke up with
A little dart of warmth pierced Sherlock's insides, and he found himself smiling.
"Maybe next Sunday, all right? No promises."
"Ah." Sherlock propped himself up on his elbows. "Well. Certainly I'm no expert on these matters –"
"Why?"
John stayed silent.
wasn't far away, and he couldn't ride properly with mangled hands. "Just untie me, okay? What time is it, anyhow? I haven't really been out for seven hours, have I?"
The nurse produced a pair of scissors and a large glassine envelope. "Would you like a lock of your mummy's hair?"
"No."
“Jesus, yeah. I mean, just once I’d have liked to shag him. We kissed a bit, but between you and me he wasn’t much of a kisser. Tongue like a board. Not in a good way.”
There was a pause. The ellipsis flashed, then stopped, then flashed again. It stopped. Greg waited, chuckling.
He'd always trusted his senses, and he wasn't injured; he'd be able to tell if he were. His brain was working normally – rapidly he scanned the sea of faces in front of him and focused on the blonde woman who'd tried to soothe him. Clearly in charge since everyone had obeyed her immediately when she'd told them to move, also no ID hanging from a lanyard round her neck like most of the others, therefore high up enough not to have to wear one. Short nails, chipped lacquer, bit of gunge at the quick; not afraid to get her hands dirty once in a while, casual but smart clothes, expensive tennis shoes. Two children, two cats, and a dog, staying in a hotel but brought her own candles to get the staleness out of the room.
"Good." Nora twirled her fork in her chicken curry, extra hot, over jasmine rice. "It was easy."
"You're not exactly easy to forget."
end with the point on the left. Your dominant hand is the right one." He passed the book to John.
"I know," Henry snapped. "That's what I just said. Keep up." He shook his head. "He didn't tell the Metropolitan police either. Not word one. I'd watch you, Tommy, after you'd get one. You never noticed that our dinners coincided with those letters, did you? Oh, God." Henry rose and began to pace in front of them. "Some people, like you, Tom…they manage for years, they grow up and they
"Consider your daughter, John. Spain isn't home to her. Living among strangers, a different language, a tutor, away from her friends – what sort of life would that be?"
Sherlock, sipping his tea, watched Tom's face. "What?"
many faults."
"Came pretty quick," John said. "Probably saw you standing there in a fog, though. What's on your mind?"
"You okay?"
The voice that came through was only vaguely familiar, but he held still and listened carefully.
It was just a day for disappointments, and that was all there was to it. Jim hadn't expected to see Mycroft Holmes, but he'd hoped for someone more imposing than the officious little man in a Hong Kong Cerruti knockoff who was arguing with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (a Conservative, in Ermenegildo Zegna, hilariouser and hilariouser).
"What –" John clamped his mouth shut, letting prudence be the better part of valour. He stared at the black-clad knees of the man holding him at gunpoint.
Relieved at the slight gain in personal space, Benedict kept his hands, loosely wrapped in the wire, pressed to the rough surface, and struggled into a sitting position. He turned his head a bit creakily and saw John lying on the ground, bound and gagged and evidently still unconscious.
He gasped. Oh, Christ!
"Yeah, hi. Look, I was thinking. It's possible that your murder victim might have had temporary trismus. It's not entirely unheard of." John met Sherlock's eyes and then looked away, concentrating on a spot just to the right of Sherlock's neck. "Most aconitine poisoning presents as a combination of neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal features, but it's not impossible. There's conium, and that disrupts the central nervous system and causes ascending paralysis. Depending on the strength of the aconitine dose, the victim might have experienced some paralysis, which could explain why nobody heard her. It's hard to scream for help through clenched jaws." John's face had grown steadily more crimson throughout his speech. He fell silent, then sniffed. "Erm…I did a bit of research on it last night."
She fixed him with a gaze of endless patience. "I like Tabasco."
"I think they cremated her."
They lay still until John started to get cold on the floor. "We'd better –" He got up with another groan. Fucking on the floor lost some of its allure the closer one got to fifty.
"It's Sherlock Holmes, isn't it? What did he say to you?"
"Yep. Shut up." He listened. "Good. Excellent. Temperature next." He pushed Sherlock's hair away from his brow and swiped the thermometer. Sherlock watched him intently, unmoving, his lips tightly pressed together. John met his eyes for a second, then looked away, taking his hand from Sherlock's head and turning his attention to the thermometer. "Thirty-six point seven, that's good. Blood pressure." He busied himself with the cuff, wrapping it round Sherlock's arm and pumping. "One-seventeen over sixty-five. Nice. Let me look at your pupils, then you can go back to sleep." He turned on his phone light. "This is going to be a bit bright." He shone the light into Sherlock's eyes, watching their response. The enlarged one seemed a bit smaller than before, judging from the little hazel blot on Sherlock's iris that John used as a measurement, and both reacted to the light. "Good. How's your headache?"
"I just need to speak to this man, Nora. And…well, I might need to…." John drew a deep sigh. "Nora, love –" Footsteps in the corridor interrupted him, and he leapt to his feet.
Amazing, the way genetics worked. Sherlock was an almost perfect amalgam of his parents. He'd teased Mycroft for years about being left at the Holmes doorstep wrapped in newspaper until Mycroft had produced a mouldering photograph of one Routledge Wakefield Holmes, balding, bewhiskered, and choleric in appearance – in short, there was a terrifying resemblance. Naturally, Sherlock had then accused Mycroft of Photoshopping the picture, whereupon Mycroft had presented a raft of documentation – birth registry, marriage certificate, war service records, et cetera. Sherlock had parried with the assertion that Mycroft could have had all that stuff made up, but he'd eventually conceded that Mycroft was actually a Holmes by blood. It had been a fun game while it lasted.
"Why wouldn't he come?" Nora wanted to know.
"Fancy that."
Henry grabbed his hair again, aggravating Tom's already thriving headache and the new pain in his thigh. "Shut up. Shut up. Shut up." He punctuated each short sentence with a hard slap to Tom's cheek.
Sebastian Moran shook his head. "Actually, Mr Holmes, I think it's best if you don't tell anyone where you're headed."
Benedict snorted laughter, then sobered. "I'm going to miss you. You're brilliant, John."
"Brother dear," Mycroft said without enthusiasm. "I thought that would get your attention."
"In your research," Mycroft persisted, "did you see any evidence that theirs was not a chance meeting?" Daintily, he plucked Sherlock's glass from the mantel and examined the wood for condensation.
"Ye-es, I know your tastes, your ladyship. Go put a jumper on, it's chilly in here. And make sure you wash your hands." John went to the fridge and got water for Nora and a beer for himself. He cracked it open and leant against the range, waiting for the microwave to finish. Cursing himself silently, he dragged out his phone and checked for messages – no more from Mary, and worse, none at all from Sherlock. Sherlock hadn't reacted at all to his news, either positively or negatively, and hadn't responded to two more texts from John. John hadn't wanted to inundate him, but it would have been nice to have heard
"Thank you," Sherlock replied. "Might want to move away from the centre – the springs are starting to emerge. You'll ruin your trousers." He fished out a bottle from a cupboard and shook the amber liquid inside. With luck Lord Moran's taste buds had been dry-iced an hour or so ago. He blew the dust from two tumblers and poured.
"Starving!" John hung his coat and went into the kitchen. Mary was whisking something in a bowl, and Nora had her homework spread out on the table, but appeared to be doodling instead of working.
life is here." Sherlock's eyes burned brilliant blue, the fine web of wrinkles around them making them somehow even bluer.
"He used to call me stupid."
"TW – oh,
"Nope, got it under control. Go make sure she's not watching porn."
"Look, I know you don't want to do it, but it's an excellent school. You've seen the reports, John. She's so bright, she needs an environment where she'll flourish. And she'll be –" Mary hesitated. "I think she'd be really happy there."
Nora poked her head out the door. "Are you okay, Mum?"
A dart of panic arrowed itself into Benedict's belly.
"Oh." Moriarty's voice was shaky. "He doesn't know. He doesn't know, Sherlock." He began to pace. "That is
"It's okay. He does love you. Can't you tell?"
Violet, always wilful, chose not to recall that incident, or previous incidents, or subsequent incidents. It beggared belief, but what could be done about it? Their access to her was limited, and she wouldn’t speak when they did see her. Sherlock and Mycroft had said very little about their encounter with her, and Sig was afraid to ask about it.
“I’m sure things will be sorted out in their own good time,” Gautam said, patting Martha’s hand and squeezing it gently. “Goodness, one would think they were your own sons the way you worry about them.”
"Sherlock? You upstairs?"
They went through a door and across a cold flagstone floor. Tom heard a click, and a rich waft of something sour drifted past his nose. He gagged, swallowed, implored his gorge to stay down, and felt Henry's arm tightening round his body. They went down a flight of wooden stairs, and he was dragged a bit further before Henry simply let go and Tom thudded to the floor, barking his knees and elbows.
What the
"At least she had a plan in place." John slipped the green dress into a large evidence bag. "We haven't got one."
"I haven't been fainting because I'm sick. I've been fainting because…well, every time it happens, I enter this really bizarre sort of, erm, spatial and temporal anomaly. Have you ever heard of the multiverse?"
Sherlock pressed himself against Mycroft. "Your pupils are dilating. You know, during the Cold War the Canadian government came up with a pupillometry device to determine the existence of homosexuals in their civil service bureaus. They'd show the subjects risqué imagery and watch pupillary response. They called it the fruit machine. Trouble was, it didn't really work all that well. Not everybody has the same response to graphic imagery, and some people can control mydriasis better than others. But the eyes are still a fair indicator of cognitive, emotional and sensory reaction. We read cues all the time, in the eyes, and in other ways as well." He grasped Mycroft's wrist and pressed his thumb against the pulse. Gatiss wanted Cumberbatch. Had wanted him for a long time.
"I won't," Kate whispered.
In moments she reached Fahan Street and kept to the shadows as she approached Jim's house. Earlier reconnaissance had revealed one person inside, and quick texts to her contacts in the other cities where Jim was likely to be had proven unfruitful. It was here, it had to be here. Odd as it seemed, this was the place where he felt safest, his home ground. Not entirely stupid – it hadn't been easy to find and it wasn't as if he had a huge office and tons of equipment, just his little laptop and a phone. And from there, access to anything he desired. A terrorist plot to take the biscuit, for example.
He'd keep his promise to Cumberbatch, though likely TWH would slam the door in his face. It shouldn't take long, and perhaps he'd be able to set everything to rights – if Tom had any sense of gratitude, at least. Though if he'd been really worried, he'd have gone to the police already. Honestly, the whole affair was scarcely worth his time, but he
John reached a hand to the mop of dark-auburn curls, cradling the genius' skull in his hand. He made sure to get direct eye contact with the boy before Sherlock could distract him any further with his pretty mouth and dirty tricks. John hummed in question, encouraging him to speak.
From: Greg Lestrade
Seeming to find something in John's words, Sherlock sprung forward to capture John's lips against his own. Surprised by the reaction of his partner, John eagerly pressed back, attempting to match Sherlock's erratic pace.
"Do you need to ask?" Sherlock gasped in return, somehow having lost his breath as his chest heaved up and down. John moved back to his lover's cock, and pressed the point of his tongue against the underside of the head, pleased at the delicious sounds Sherlock was making as he licked a wide stripe down to his testicles and sucked one gently into his mouth.
John released a breath. Even with Sherlock leaning down, he still had to move on to his tip-toes, and eventually felt the phantom presence of one of Sherlock's large hands at the small of his back, hesitantly hovering before settling against the moving muscles aside John's spine.
He did.
"You're fine" he smiled, tempted to reach out to trace the knuckles of Sherlock's gloved hand. "I'm sorry, I'm just finding all of this difficult to cope with, I know that's no excuse but-"
John shook his head, "No," he hesitates, and then jumps straight off the diving board and into the deep end. "You can call me John"
"Sorry, love-" John had apologised, "Can't find the bloody key."
"Yes. Get in." Mycroft said, hanging up.
John remained silent, his lips pressed together as if he were worried as soon as they opened all manner of things would come tumbling out with little control. Instead, he watched Sherlock carefully, watched his eyes which were unfocused but were attempting to land on John.
John thinks he is doing the responsible thing by considering giving a student a lift home, bearing in mind it was late and getting dark, and nobody is safe walking home alone in the dark, not even Sherlock. This is what he tries to convince himself as he asks Sherlock if he would like a lift home.
He headed straight up the stairs after a familiar nod to the usual bodyguard who stood in the entrance to the foyer. It was strange to think that he'd been there enough times now for them to stop checking him for identification whenever he walked through the door. Greg wondered if Mycroft had said something to his staff to let them know he was not a threat to him.
A long corridor full of doors. Yes, one of these will do. I’ll check them all if I have to.
I have to get up, exit this place. Climb back up the stairs, one step after another, aiming to the top. The banister the only thing keeping me upright, preventing me to fall back down. I’m almost there.
“Mycroft.”
Silence.
The poor paramedic that was attempting to take Sherlock’s vitals without much success looked at me like I was his savior, and seeing as Sherlock was trying to escape his attentions and that awful orange shock blanket, I probably was.
“Little brother,
Doctor Watson breathed no more. And I was scared that my brother would follow in his steps.
“It is.”
But I sense it. It’s here. Hope is strong, it never died. I just buried it deep down in some part of my mind palace.
That was the time
You have to understand that Doctor John Watson was not a simple doctor. He was a soldier, a Capitan. He was the type of doctor that you will find in the middle of the battlefield, not in a medical tent. He and his team were the ones that were always on the frontlines. The ones that were always called for special black ops, too. But now he wanted back, he wanted to give Sherlock more stability and peace of mind. Sherlock knew perfectly well what John was capable of and the dangers he had to face every time he was sent abroad. Still, he never said a word about it and always supported his husband.
“Little brother,
I cannot think about anything else as I approach the ambulance as calm as ever.
Silence again.
I cannot stand up anymore. The floor is soft. The pain is the same.
that it seemed to go still.
Despite all our best efforts, we found nothing. And we all were frantically working, following every trace we could find, when the day came the last survivor had to die, too. I can assure you that it was the worst day of my life. I still can see the scene vividly when I close my eyes. The day in which a video was sent to us as we were all there to see John being executed on a screen in my office, painfully aware that we weren’t able to reach him, any of them, in time. That day Sherlock walked into my office as he usually did at the time as he was helping us finding the soldiers, exactly in time to watch his husband being killed right in front of him. The moment I came out of my own shock and realised he had seen everything, it was too late. I think I’ll never forget as he just stood there, paralysed, eyes unfocused, face painted with shock. I’ll never forget how I wasn’t able to utter a single sound because of my own shock. Frozen, incapable of doing anything, scared for the first time in a very long time.
Idiots. The lot of them. How Sherlock can stand them I will never know.
He doesn’t sleep, but it’s not because he doesn’t need to nor for the nightmares. The good dreams are the problem: they make reality too hard to bear.
“I believe you will find my news most interesting. And please, remember to breathe.”
That was the time
So yes, it was I who caused the fall of Doctor Watson. It was because of me that Sherlock had lost everything that he held dear in life. Because of my decision to send him abroad one last time, in a fairly dangerous operation that needed his skills specifically.
But again his question remained unanswered. As minutes passed, Sherlock slowly regained the control of his body and his brain. And that was the moment that he realized what this meant. He looked at me with a horrified expression.
your back on me.
I've replayed this conversation in my head time and time again and deep down I know that there was something behind all of this.
“Say that again.”
Needles, drugs, oblivion. The result of my decisions right in front of me. My own eyes where staring at me from my own face covered in dirt, taunting, as I lay down on the floor. The Sherlock without a purpose. The Sherlock who had given up. The Sherlock who wanted to end everything.
“Oh, God, Myc. I stopped. I give up. And he was out there. All this time. And I just stopped.”
Why these words don’t make any sense?
“John is alive.”
My little brother was staring at me with a blank face, his brain deciding what to do with this new information. An information that he craved for but that he knew it will never come. That, slowly, his expression begins to change. And a lonely tear came down his cheek.
A duffel bag, a waving hand. A last kiss. And the taste of tears that never really stopped.
God, he sounds so disappointed. And not because of my presence.
Or maybe
“John is alive.”
This is all for him.
“It’s not possible.”
everything.
“Remember, Sherlock. You promised me. Whatever happens, a life is always worth living.”
That was the time
Shut up! Just, shut up.
“Holmes? You’re his brother? Really? I didn’t know he had one. He never speaks about his family.”
Sherlock my only focus. My mission.
He doesn’t eat. He keeps telling that it slows his brain down, but that’s not true.
Sherlock silenced him with a forceful kiss, his eyes heavy and hooded, blown black and icy blue. "I..."
"No buts," Sherlock stood, draining the last of his coffee and setting his hollow cup on the table. "We're leaving, John. We agreed before-"
The truth was, that he couldn't face going in, seeing Sherlock's face and forcing himself not to let his usual smile fill his own face, because he couldn't anymore. He couldn't put himself and possibly Sherlock in danger.
__________________________________________________________________________________
John lifted his glass to Greg and then watched him disappear behind people's heads. He flexed his fingers atop the bar, crunching his hand into a fist when it began to shake. He'd been trying not to dwell on the threat of Sherlock's brother, knowing that if he was as intelligent as Sherlock himself, he would figure out that John hadn't actually done anything illegal, and that technically those photos could merely display a moment of comfort in a time of distress.
"Yes. I'm calling to tell you that your gym appointment has been set back to 2.20pm. There's work to be done, I'd like you to assist."
John felt heat rising up the back of his neck and rushed to scratch at it, keeping his face tilted downwards. "Yeah, I -uh...I don't know either. Bizarre."
In actual fact, Greg was still holding onto the theory that Sherlock may have been created in a factory somewhere, and given the knowledge of a 50 year old at the moment of birth just as an experiment...
Sherlock hadn't been particularly observant of Sebastian prior to realising that John taught him for AS Biology, but immediately realised that Sebastian was what one would call a predatory gay. Sherlock's eyes traced the styled quiff raised straight up from Sebastian's forehead, the tightness of his skinny jeans, riding low on his hips to reveal a neon-banded underwear brand, collar up on his fitted polo shirt.
John cleared his throat, not looking at his student. "Yes,"
A small smack of lips filled the silence as Sherlock pulled away, his eyes large and inquisitive, head tilted and reminding John immediately of some sort of curious woodland creature un-accustomed to its environment. John smiled, kissing the corner of Sherlock's stunned mouth, stealing one more kiss accompanied with the presence of his hand on Sherlock's angled face before moving away.
"Sherlock, I really don't think we sh-mmph!"
Unable to speak, he looked down at his own hand and moved it to Sherlock's muscled thigh. He felt a slight flinch at the unexpected touch, and looked up to Sherlock's eyes which immediately softened when they met John's, then eventually returned to the road. Finding the urge to stroke his thumb continually against the fabric of the younger man's suit trousers, John looked back out at the blur of movement in the view of his own window and tapped his left hand against his own knee to imaginary music in his head.
go after all." He rubbed Sherlock's forearm. Clearly some forms of physical affection were acceptable.
"Hi, Daddy."
"Well." Sherlock rubbed his hands together. "It may be coincidence that in the early 1990s, Lord Stephen Moran, then a very young MP indeed, was one of the principal intermediaries during the back-door talks that were taking place between the IRA and the British government. Partly because his constituency was in Derry, but also because he had ties to the IRA."
" – but I suggest moving out of 221B as soon as it's convenient. Clearly the place is a firetrap – it's a wonder it hasn't burnt down around your ears already, considering the sheer amount of paper and volatile chemicals cluttering it up. Surely it's not money that's the problem."
"Why not?" Mycroft rose as well and strolled to the window. He parted the dusty curtain and peered down at the street. Sherlock's London was buzzing, buzzing, but he was disconnected from it. Entirely unacceptable.
Benedict marvelled at John's courage. Mycroft Holmes was the most terrifying person he'd ever clapped eyes on.
What was there to ruin, though?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, I've missed you, Sherlock," Moriarty whispered.
"And Mr Cumberbatch?"
The pink dress was gorgeous. Janine had an eye.
"Yeah, complete loss of consciousness," John said. "I thought it was ordinary syncope at first, and then when it happened again, I thought maybe it was a heart issue, and then I just started to panic. I…is Sherlock okay?"
"Hey, steady on there!"
"Mum!"
Sherlock jumped and glared to cover his startlement. Mycroft had long ago perfected the art at entering and leaving without fuss; doubtless he'd heard a great many incriminating conversations that way. It was a quality of his that Sherlock had emulated, obviously without saying a word to him about it. He didn't need a head more swollen than it already was. "God! I've been waiting ages, Your Lordship."
Clear sign of overcompensation anyhow, those knots. Sad, really.
"How's Sherlock?" Mary asked.
Sherlock heaved a dramatic sigh. "Very well. If you must. Honestly, John." He was silent for a moment. "Thank you," he added quietly.
Flunitrazepam 15 mg
Comforting sort of room, Sherlock mused, but lacking the personal touch except for a few framed photos on the shelves. No photos of girlfriend in evidence. Shelves dusted, so no incriminating marks, but – an irregularity here and there, a lack of symmetry in the placement of the photos. One missing there, one there, one there. On the furthest shelf, a photo of Cumberbatch in Great War costume – the moustache, like most moustaches, was terrifying – smiling at TWH in similar costume. Standing close to each other, but not too close, nothing conspicuous.
"Well, it was a mixed bag, John. Fists first, and I think they used an extension cord at one point – felt like that, anyhow. I managed to get out, obviously." He didn't add that Mycroft had expedited the process. He'd been well on his way to escaping. Probably. Almost certainly.
A broad smile crossed Janine’s face. “I’d better find something for myself too, then.”
"That's you, a pair of shoelaces. I can't quite work you out. You're no shining star in the brains department; you're nothing to look at – even less now." Moriarty glanced contemptuously at John's slightly spreading midsection. "And you and your little wifey have buggered Sherlock over on I've lost count of how many occasions now. It's boggling. Even to me."
Mycroft caught up with him quickly. "You're still limping."
Sherlock got his phone out. "I'm forwarding Mycroft's list of plundered art. Start checking pieces off. Look for a connection to Dedalus, or Meredith Howe."
"I'll arrange it." Mycroft walked to the door. He fumbled with the lock a moment, then got it unlatched. He stood still, his back perfectly straight. "You can see yourself out, can't you?" Without another word, he walked out, leaving Benedict on his knees in the middle of the floor.
"Seven minutes," someone said.
Sherlock shook his head. "That was Molly. They found atropine and pralidoxime in Meredith Howe's blood. It was –" Sherlock gestured toward the inside of his arm. "It was administered intravenously. A sizeable amount, apparently, but not enough to save her."
Mary's mouth tightened. "I'm not going to."
"If I were home right now, if I had the chance, I'd tell Tom I love him. I don't tell him nearly enough, and he's so generous."
John set his stethoscope aside and took Sherlock's face in his hands. "Abysmal fucking
"I was going to keep Sherlock company, but – are you his solicitor? Probably better if you two get right to it." She set the tray down next to Moriarty. "I'd have brought something nicer, but hobnobs were all I could find on short notice."
He'd had plenty of time for reflection on the plane, time enough to circle half a hundred trajectories of Mary's possible thought processes before reaching the baffled and furious conclusion that he didn't know her at all. And yes, so much of that had been a willful shutting-out of truth and fact; he loved her, and her past didn't matter to him, no matter what Sherlock had said. He'd managed to tell himself that for years, even as it niggled and ate at him – not in his brain where, once the notion had mutated into true suspicion, he could have clearly told it to sod off, but in his heart, where malignancy was checked by her daily affections, by his own, by their mutual love for Nora.
"Stop it!" Benedict cried. He couldn't take his eyes away from the gaping black bore of the gun. His body quivered with suppressed energy. The dots still roamed over John's body.
Moriarty cast a wild look at Mycroft. "You're just going to let him –"
Sherlock banged the loo door shut, stuck his hands in his hair for a hearty rumpling, remembered how awful it looked, then decided it wouldn't make a difference. Just as he'd finished, he heard the door opening and fled, unable to make more conversation with Brainless Adulterer Balthus Knot.
Nora frowned. "Well, you asked."
“I suppose.” Mycroft sipped his whisky and set it on the table. “Sherlock makes a point of inviting me to his silly dos, but I think he only does it because he realizes I’ll never go.”
A rush of warmth permeated Molly’s cheeks and neck. “Erm…but all the papers…they said….”
Sherlock slipped into his coat. Behind him, Sebastian was helping Lord Moran to his feet. Sherlock pivoted on his heel. "You don't use Diazepam frequently, do you, Lord Moran?"
"They don't do tours in August," the old man said, seating himself on his high stool with a soft grunt. "Mr Henry comes down in August, and again for the shooting."
He found an empty seat on the tube and pulled out his phone. He'd checked it a few times throughout the day, enough that Maisie had remarked on it, but it was 2011, everybody was glued to their phone, even more than he was, and he didn't know what she'd been on about.
"What?"
"Maybe he's a barber?" Tom hazarded. He selected a sandwich and started eating. Yum.
"Nevertheless." Mycroft coughed, his cheeks flushing. "I should tell you that I had to resort to…unorthodox methods to get to the bottom of things."
"Hold on, hold on, we're here. Won't be a moment."
that's your browser history, but I could be wrong, I guess. 'Loli-town' – hmm. Here's a site called 'The Lonely Doll.' Do you collect toys?" He glanced at the screen. "Ooh, this one takes three levels of security. It's called 'World's Cutest Babies' though, so I guess it's pretty innocuous. Oh, and – hey, this isn't on your browser history, but it
a fuck." He turned and dug in his bag, withdrawing a narrow garden trowel about thirty centimetres long, with a sharp point on the digging end.
"You're being stupidly resistant to this, and I can't think why." John ignored Sherlock's raised eyebrows and the expression that meant
"Oh, God. Can't we just sit a moment longer?"
Perfect. It was perfect.
"I mean how did you
"She promised me a cat video," John said.
Feeling a bit better, he opened the tin once more and plucked another chocolate free. One more wouldn't kill him.
All this finery seemed like a capitulation on Mary's part, an acknowledgment of yearning for the unattainable. "Mary, we can't accept this. Tell Trish thank you, but we've got to send it back."
Mary thought frantically.
John grinned. "True."
Henry lifted the trowel to strike Tom across the face, and Sherlock sprang. The top strip of tape still pinned him to the chair, but it wasn't enough to impede his movement completely. He lashed out with a well-aimed kick in his soft middle. Henry whooshed out a great gust of air and dropped to his knees, gasping.
Yes. Maybe it was propitious that Sherlock had backed out, and that Mycroft hadn't revealed more. Once Sherlock had got the bit in his teeth, it was impossible to dissuade him. Best that he stay away from Moran, for the time being.
John leant down and gave Nora a fierce hug. "No. No. I'm fine." He held her away. "You stay here, and I promise I will be back as soon as I can. Give us a kiss, all right?"
"'Steenie' is just for intimate friends, is that right? Or is it a family nickname?"
Henry pushed Tom ahead of him, prodding him with the sharp knife. Tom searched Sherlock's eyes anxiously, then moved close and pressed his cheek against Sherlock's, a defiant and…and admittedly a touching little gesture. Sherlock inhaled the sharp tinge of Tom's fear-infused sweat, and leant into Tom's body, just to reassure him a bit, but swayed a little to maintain his demeanour of disorientation.
Some readers have expressed confusion over the flashback dates. Accordingly, I have made date headers that precede the flashbacks for each chapter. I hope this helps! Thanks very much. :)
"That's right," Sherlock said smoothly. "We've come to –"
"Come on, love. Don't be like that." Mary took the nightie from his hands and began to fold it.
"More?"
"Just relax, gentlemen," a voice said, and a hot sting pierced the flesh below Sherlock's ear. "This will only take a moment."
"Inasmuch as she had friends, yes. I suppose so. A colleague, really, though. At times I facilitated her acquisition projects, when I was in a position to do so."
Sherlock wheeled on John. "When Moran got out of prison, he sank the last of his money into a communications startup called Dedalus. They started out as a small cybersecurity firm but branched into telecom, dark fibre, a dozen other ventures. The company went public a year and a half ago – the IPO was three-point-something billion."
Sherlock cracked a genuine grin. "That's about right."
John gave a wan chuckle. "No thanks."
"Right," Benedict said. "What did make you twig, anyhow? Was it…er…that bit in the drawing room?" He wasn't certain he really wanted to know, but it was a poor actor who wasn't willing to hear negative feedback.
Mary set the bowl in the sink. "Actually, this should be ready in twenty minutes, so clear your things up and wash your hands. You can watch television until it's done. John, could you set the table?"
Probably true.
"No – tomorrow. I'll have to look at about seventy-five thousand boring snaps of white sand and blue water."
A muffled snort erupted from Freeman's vicinity. "Right, just stay away from tumblr if I'm not there to supervise. I'm going back to sleep. Wake me when we get there. Christ, I'm glad we've got a bit of a break." He closed his eyes again.
he wanted to ask. What had Sherlock done, or not done, to provoke this visit? He couldn't trust it. It was transient. The entire experience was transient. That was all right. It was fine. Just a little while would be perfectly fine. He tamped down the delicious flood of possibility that entered his bloodstream in a dizzying rush.
“Differential pressure causes changes in the points of minutiae. They’re similar, but not alike. The real question is how can someone walk barefoot into a bank vault but leave no fingerprint impressions at all?”
Benedict looked up, and with a faint sense of dread saw the familiar door, saw Speedy's. It wasn't the set, wasn't Gower Street at all.
John couldn't stop the discontentment that gnawed at him. Probably therapy would be a good thing to try again, to make sense of everything. Maybe he'd make an appointment with Ella, if she still practised. He'd fallen out of touch with her.
Sherlock shrugged. "They usually downplay them, actually."
Molly got to her feet. "Jim, I'm sorry. I know you probably think I'm an idiot, and I probably am, but I've got to sort myself out. Maybe one day –"
didn't know Sherlock. Making himself vulnerable – ha. Sherlock had a shark's instinct for vulnerability, and didn't give a fuck about trampling on it if it suited his purposes.  Sherlock would have rolled his eyes at John's clumsy advances, or put him off with a sneer and a few razor-edged words.
"Well, if we hang around and wait for supper, maybe it will be." John tucked into the sandwich, which was even better than the tea. "Nothing for you?"
Frustration seized Benedict, galvanising enough for him to reach up with one bloodless hand and catch the bottom of Sherlock's – of
The tread of footsteps sounded again – across the carpet, into the corridor, up the stone staircase. Lug soles, reasonably heavy. Balanced steps, quick up the stairs, probably about thirteen stone, give or take. Familiar with layout of the house –
Sherlock tried to control his trembling with little success. It was, he realised, a panic-induced response to torture, made worse by familiarity and anticipation. In Serbia, they'd waterboarded him four times in twenty-four hours, making it clear that it was hardly the beginning of his interrogation, a tactical error on the part of his captors. He'd steeled himself and kept silent; perhaps if they'd told him it was the only torture he'd receive, he'd have talked. This was the same. He had to bide his time. They'd bound him to the chair in his shirt and trousers, no socks or shoes or jacket or coat, but likely those things were still on the premises, and his phone with them. The GPS was activated; Mycroft would –
Mary laid her hands flat on the table, her fingers splayed out around the photograph. "I went to see him the day after you two had that fight, you know. I knew he'd guessed. I knew why you'd quarrelled. I went to threaten him, and if that didn't work, to kill him." Her eyes clouded. "I gave him a chance to take it back, and he wouldn't. Even when I made it clear that I knew about the two of you, and that didn't enter into it, he wouldn't. So what does that tell you?"
Jim rose to his feet nonchalantly and gave the faux-Cerruti screw a shrug. "No hard feelings." Not
"And what did they tell you?"
"Right. Okay." John opened the bottle and slid his hand over his cock, stroking and rubbing. He bent to kiss Sherlock's mouth, all demand. "Are you ready?"
"There's tons of stuff here," John said plaintively. "It's going to take forever."
"All right," Sherlock said indifferently, though his belly rumbled in enthusiastic agreement.
John started awake from a combat dream, sitting up in the near darkness. He gasped at the sight of Sherlock sitting cross-legged in his battered leather chair, his hands folded together in contemplation. "Jesus, you scared me half to death."
PA most likely, clearly coddled him as much as the crew.
As he sank back, staring upward into nothingness, a bright light blinded him, and he shielded his eyes with his hand.
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!" Moriarty called merrily.
"I asked him if he wanted tea, but he said no. He told me not to leave the house."
"Hey, let's go to dinner tomorrow night, the three of us. Somewhere horribly posh to celebrate this nouveau riche thing."
here, but in the flat. In 221B. Christ, don't you remember me flipping out? Asking if it was a joke?"
"Oh, yes. She's very well, still blissfully married to Lestrade."
The safe clicked.
"No," Sebastian said. "Derry."
TWH leant his head against the window and was silent for the duration of the ride – four and a half kilometres, not five as Sherlock had supposed. Sherlock glanced at him a few times. His experience with kidnap victims post rescue wasn't vast; once the case was solved, he was gone, on to the next thing. He usually hung about long enough to see them delivered to paramedics and didn't bother much with conversation. They generally weren't up for a chat in their state, and in any event rarely had little illuminating information to contribute. Tom seemed no different from the typical victim. That was fine.
"Hm. It made for a tolerably diverting case in the midst of extreme boredom," Sherlock said. He twirled the stem in his hand, watching the bubbles, the liquid's low-protein, low-surfactant qualities causing rapid ascent, counter-rotational vortices near the axis of the glass, hardly a movement along the glass's periphery. He made a mental note for a cold case Lestrade had given him a few months ago, a man sealed in a beer keg. Kegs. Well, bits of him in different kegs. "Besides, Cumberbatch asked me to help you."
, offshore transactions most likely, buyers who didn't give a damn about the original provenance of the work. I doubt anyone would be able to locate them, much less repatriate them."
Not optimal. "I see."
"Like what?"
"No." Moran shook his head. "You did that. He's a soft-hearted fellow, you know. I don't think he could bear knowing what I'm going to do to you, even for all you've fucked him over. So I'm not going to tell him. He's got a bit of a guilty conscience as well."
, really.
"Thank you."
He looked up at her and understood that they were back at détente. They hadn't discussed the clothes that Trish had purchased for Nora, and Mary hadn't put them beneath the tree – he'd have noticed a pile like that. He decided to say nothing if Mary brought them out. It was ridiculous and exorbitant, but if Trish wanted to piss her money away on clothes for a little girl that would likely fit her for all of a year, that was her affair and Mary's. "Merry Christmas." He smiled, and half-rose to plant a kiss on her cheek. "Hungry?"
"Okay."
he split with Mary – what sort of damage would that incur? He'd love her no less no matter what, but he didn't want to cause some sort of downward mental health spiral.
Sherlock's room was dark and pleasantly cool, but Benedict's hunger was so intense it drove him out of bed. He went to Sherlock's closet and found a dressing gown, deep merlot silk, shrugged into it, and made his way into the kitchen. When was the last time he'd eaten? John's lovely breakfast, that was it.
, Sherlock wanted to snarl, but schooled his face into pleasant neutrality. "And you? Any significant others, or are you still friendless and alone?"
No matter how much it ached, God damn it.
"Do you know its origins?"
"He might yet, but if you deny it innocently enough no-one will believe him."
"You don't seem surprised."
"Why not?" Sherlock was thirsty, and a couple of glasses might be just the thing. It was shaping up to be a really peculiar night, even as the past few nights went. He sat at the table and watched Tom dash back and forth, getting glasses and more cooking utensils, then pulling out a block of Pecorino and a bottle.
“He likes trouble, no question.” Greg half-smiled.
Sherlock rose to his feet. "If you'd prefer prison, that's perfectly fine with me. Good day. John –" He turned and drew on one glove.
Sherlock towelled off, slung the wet towel over the tub, and went to the sink. It took some digging, but he found a fresh toothbrush and razorblade; no way in hell was he using Cumberbatch's stuff, even if they did look exactly alike. He brushed, shaved, and wiped his face, peering curiously at his skin. There were scars and discolourations here and there, a strange ruddiness to the top of his upper lip, a few tiny spots. Cumberbatch hadn't been blessed with Sherlock's skin, unfortunately – that perfection had been makeup.
"Fantastic." Benedict's grin got wider.
John set the scope against Sherlock's chest. "Nice deep breath. Good. Another. Now normally." He listened to Sherlock's lungs, then picked up the thermometer. "Want to pull your hair back for me?" That first time had been unconscious – he'd touched Sherlock's face and hair without thinking. Now it felt odd, slightly artificial. Sherlock obliged without any discernible change in expression. "Good. Blood pressure." It was good, and Sherlock's blown pupil hadn't diminished, but it wasn't larger. "You seem fine. I'll let you sleep three hours this time."
"Lovely."
Jim rolled his head back and forth, snapped his gum, and knocked on the door.
"He's not
"Well." John laced his hands together and looked round the flat. "It's home, you know. I don't think either of us are due for pipes and slippers warmed at the fire quite yet, but we can't run round London all the time."
"Okay. See you around, then." Jim went back to his car and slid inside.
– was between them, she was still his sister, and he owed her at least some loyalty. Trish had been rich – where, then, were the friends an affluent woman ordinarily had in droves? Her dead husband's family? Hangers-on, the sycophants that rich people always seemed to shoulder? She certainly hadn't seemed the loner type.
The other radiology tech, Kevin, grinned. "Wow – Hatman and Robin in the flesh." There were no words for how stupid that moniker was, so John simply offered Kevin a tight smile. Kevin seemed to realise that his overfamiliarity was inappropriate and turned his attention to Sherlock. "Well. Let's get you in, shall we?"
a prick. Seventy-five, eighty percent of the time, yeah. But the rest of the time –" John smiled. "I don't think he even realises it. He's got a lot invested in that prick façade of his. But I've seen him being unbelievably sweet with Mrs Hudson, and he's actually not bad with kids, though you'd think he'd send them away crying ten times out of ten. And he's…he's a good flatmate. A good friend. He'd cringe to hear me say it, but it's true."
sorry, my brain's utterly curdled. Luke."
"I knew it!" Jim hopped to his feet and executed a weird little relevé. "I
"I prefer Thai, or Vietnamese at a pinch."
A small knot of people milled aimlessly around the front of Baker Street, but it wasn't until Sherlock drew near that he realised why.
"Very well. I'll be in the library, John. Third door on the left." Mycroft turned and left the room.
The music Sherlock plays is from Boccherini's String Quintet in C Major, No. 6, Opus 30. You can listen to it
“Yes, he’s got fussy in his old age. That’s what I said to him, and he was furious with me.” Martha laughed, then shrugged. “I don’t know. It just hasn’t been the same since Mary died.”
The text had never come, though, and Sherlock had all but run into the terminal to see John waiting at the ticket counter, his hands stuffed into his pockets, baggage at his feet. He wore dark jeans and a woollen jumper in a delicate biscuit brown, and the new Melton wool coat, and though the fit of his clothes had always been approximate at best – everyone on Earth could benefit from a decent tailor – to Sherlock, he looked absolutely wonderful.
"Ian. Tom."
I'm just saying it won't be a bad idea to be prepared. Is that wrong?"
"No."
Benedict wasn't touching that one. Nobody agreed on the state of Sherlock's finances. "I like it there."
"Not yet." Wasn't quite a lie. "Sorry, my phone was off. I just saw them and decided to call you. Everything all right?"
"We're not staying," Henry said. "We just wanted to apologise for last night. We were pricks. Well, I was a prick, and Peter was a prick."
He was rational. If he'd gone round the twist, surely his fevered brain wouldn't have invented something so prosaic. Surely not. But a multiverse! It couldn't be a legitimate scientific phenomenon, it was too…too strange, too unpredictable. Impossible.
Rosie opened her mouth, and John positioned the syringe and released it between her tongue and her cheek. Rosie swallowed reflexively, screwed up her face, and wailed loudly.
"You got to know her well?"
the world's nicest guy. He was downright rude most of the time and exquisitely courteous only when he chose to be; it wasn't as if he didn't know the difference. Probably. But it didn't mean he didn't care, sometimes at least. But it wasn't fair to say John didn't have his own life. "I've got lots of imagination." He moved forward and kissed Maisie lightly on the lips.
"Sorry, I mean – it's short notice."
"Nobody. I told you, I didn't want to be chucked in the bin. I haven't said anything."
"Yeah, it's warm. Well, it is August." Tom stepped closer and gathered Ben close. "You okay? You're all stiff." He bent and kissed salty skin just under Ben's ear, pleased at the little intake of breath he provoked. Boldly, he slipped his hands down to cup Ben's arse, digging his fingers in a bit. "Relax. Kiss me."
"Coming up." John found the jam and a spoon and placed it beside the toast. "Scrambled or soft-boiled?"
25 April 2020
"You're paying it now," Sherlock said softly. "I couldn't be more pleased."
"No, Ben. Lie still. The paramedics are on their way. We'll get you to hospital, have them take a look at you."
Sherlock leant back on his heels. He was still hard, but the urgency and desire for release was ebbing. It was bearable. A peculiar sensation swamped him, leaving him feeling unpleasantly heavy and dismal, the same feeling he got when John ignored him or was angry with him. Ordinarily he'd retaliate by stomping round the flat or playing the loudest, most dissonant pieces he could think of or simply sulking, but he couldn't do that now.
"Mycroft wanted privacy," Sherlock said, relieving her of the carrier bags and glancing inside. "I told you they have equipment."
Sherlock scrolled through the other texts, gathering snatches of information here and there, but nothing useful yet. He had to be patient. Everything would work out eventually.
"I'm knackered, love. We'll have kebabs on Saturday night, okay? And easy on the shoes there, we just got those and you're scuffing them already."
He didn't wait long. Before half an hour had elapsed, John came back into the parlour, skirting Benedict's chair by a good margin, and seated himself on the sofa. He regarded Benedict in silence for a bit, and then took a deep breath. "Benedict Cumberbatch."
How many he'd murdered was a far more interesting question than Henry's methods or motivations. His eagerness to make both him and Tom suffer was beyond obvious, the letters were indicative of classic revenge-obsession and narcissism – probably Tom didn't even realise that he'd somehow inadvertently triggered Henry's rage – and it was disappointing to see exactly how much money smoothed the way in all walks of life, even a murderer's. Give him a really clever and moderately impoverished serial killer any day – they had to be so much more resourceful.
"Tom. Tom!"
John touched it; the wool was sturdy, but wonderfully textured, obviously expensive, the sort of thing Sherlock would have bought without a second thought. He flashed back to something Sherlock had once said about buying less but making sure it was the very best – that from a man who owned eight dressing gowns. "I'm not wearing it."
"It's nice to have someone you love by your side." Benedict couldn't resist a tiny bit of needling. He opened his hand again and held the spheres out, extending his other hand. "Ready?"
"Yes?"
There she was, in a corner, one hand resting on the lid of a piano, the other gesturing with a glass of champagne. The diamond bracelet on her wrist refracted the lights of a tall Christmas tree, sending tiny myriad pinpoints of brilliance onto the wall and ceiling. She leant toward the man speaking to her and laughed.
"Hello, my love." John kissed Nora's cheek. "Oh, you're so warm. Come here, let me –" Teasingly, he put his cold hands on Nora's cheeks.
"Just think about it. We wouldn't do it until next term."
On the other hand, he'd have to dissemble in front of Graham and Fi and the others forever. Chances were the connection between them would be discovered regardless of his participation and it would come up in interviews.
"Do not approach the house, Dr Watson," Farrow said.
though….
"I saw that you sent it," Mycroft parried. "Does it have any bearing on the case?"
Sherlock dismissed that with a wave of his hand. "I was jealous. I loved Mary, but I envied her. I could have said nothing –"
"I need to speak to you."
John set the rest of the groceries on the counter and sat at the table, unmindful now of the smell. It was ridiculous and he'd die before admitting it, but he loved watching Sherlock plunged into his work. When Sherlock worked, he was happy, truly happy; his eyes sparkled, his long body lunged and swooped, his hands flashed back and forth, and he drew John effortlessly into a breathtaking rush of fervid enthusiasm. And yeah, a lot of what they did was repellent to ordinary people, but there was a secret pleasure to be found in someone so willfully extraordinary. Most people played it cool about their interests; for Sherlock, the very idea of cool would have been met with a blank stare.
"What's the date?"
." Freddy Conran's breath was a nauseating admixture of curry, beer, and poor dental hygiene. He shoved the barrel of the weapon into Sherlock's mouth, splitting his lip and knocking against his teeth. Sherlock tasted metal and oil and tried not to gag as the bore pushed against the back of his throat. "Where's the fucking case, you fuck?"
They went down the steps, out the door, and onto the street. A car idled at the kerb, a different car than Lord Moran's, with an unfamiliar man behind the wheel. Lord Moran climbed unsteadily into the front, and Sebastian gestured for Sherlock to precede him into the back seat, though he'd prudently pocketed his weapon. If there was a time to run, it was now, but Sherlock's curiosity overcame him. John would have disapproved. He got in, and Sebastian slid in beside him.
Mary sagged, sighing. "No. Not really. I'm glad you're seeing him again – you've been happier, I can tell. Maybe ease up on the death threat chat, though."
They'd been driving for more than an hour, and John was aching to see outside. If Sherlock had been with him, he'd have figured where they were headed just by the number and direction of turns the van had taken. John had tried that and had got confused after five minutes. No point in making his head hurt; he'd find out their destination eventually.
tired."
"Oh. Good. Great. Yes. Bring an ambulance in, that's perfect. You're going to make a fake phone call to emergency services. I'm pretty sure that's illegal, you know." Desperately, he turned back to the window, staring at the curtain moving in the damp breeze.
They disconnected the electrodes from the monitor, but left them attached to Sherlock's body, gave him a flimsy gown, and a pair of socks with rubber bits on the sole. The nurse took his arm, and it was all Sherlock could do not to snatch it away. He smiled again – his face was starting to hurt from all the idiot grins, but the medical staff seemed to appreciate and even expect it – and forced himself to speak amiably. "Really appreciate this."
"I just need to sort some things out," Sherlock said, a pleading note in his voice. "I wouldn't ask if it weren't important."
Right; he still had a few things to learn, apparently, one of which was that grief hadn't a timetable. It wasn't as though he hadn't grieved himself. But burrowing into his house and cutting himself off from life wouldn't help John, or Nora for that matter. It certainly wouldn't bring Mary back.
"I just know horseshit whinging when I hear it," John replied, and his face cracked into a grin.
Tom stripped off his shirt and kicked off his trainers, then slid off his socks and jeans, revealing his own erection. He stepped into the shower and let the water run over his long, lean body. Tilting his head back, he shook his head under the spray and braced his hands against the glass sides of the enclosure. "Come on in. Water's fine."
rubbish."
Freeman looked at Sherlock's phone. "Is that – are you looking at pictures of yourself, you vain fucking numpty?"
"Not like that. I mean, she's very polished. The heels and the makeup and all. I don't like when women cake all that glop on their faces. I like a more natural look."
The carpet on the floor had been recently laundered, but not quite enough to disguise some telltale bloodstains ground into the fibres, nor the faint odour and gritty white powder of the quicklime that had settled into the seams of the leather seats. Sherlock almost laughed. Evidently Henry wasn't the sort to check on or revisit the bodies he'd deposited, if he was still using quicklime; had he been, he'd have discovered that quicklime was rubbish for disintegrating a corpse; it merely mummified the body, preserving it to a reasonable degree in the long run. DNA testing would be a cinch. If he'd done his research – and really, when did murderers, even the clever ones, do the proper amount of research? Never, that's when – he'd have found that potassium hydroxide or sulphuric acid would have done a much faster, cleaner job. Not that those methods were perfect, no caustic compound was despite what sensationalistic literature and tabloids would have the credulous reader believe, but quicklime –
"Yeah, of course." John followed Mary into the kitchen, uneasy, but loose-limbed and delightfully sore at the same time. Sherlock had lavished another two hours of attention on him, evidently without getting uncomfortably hard himself and refusing John's offers of reciprocation. It was just as well, given the recent concussion, but John was determined to repay him tenfold, a hundredfold, whatever it took to get Sherlock to become the same sort of sweating, thrashing mess that John had been not three hours ago. He couldn't wait.
Tom lifted his head and turned to Sherlock. His eyes were red, and tears had cut clean salt tracks down his dirty face. "Why were you like that?"
"Technically it's not a biohazard –"
John spared Benedict a last glance and moved past him. The bedroom door closed firmly.
"Don't stop looking for a connection to Lady Howe or Dedalus, John. Give me your knife again." Sherlock took the knife and went to the first cabinet.
John didn't speak until they'd swung onto the motorway going toward the Moran house. "Well. That was about as creepy as I'd expected it to be."
that expression pasted to his face.
Mary nodded slowly and let out a sigh that seemed to come from the tips of her toes. "Thought so."
"In a manner of speaking. I was here, then I left – and returned a short while ago. Come upstairs, Sherlock." Mycroft spun on his heel and rapidly ascended a curving flight of stairs, balustraded with elaborately carved wood that glowed from years of faithful oiling and polishing. "Come on, don't dawdle."
"What the
"Mycroft doesn't text if he can talk," Benedict said, his eyes still closed. It was a bit too unnerving to keep meeting that chilly gaze.
"It's your face," Nora said.
John grabbed for Sherlock's hand and buried his face in the bedclothes, keening. "I'm sorry, Sherlock. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
John nodded and got to his feet. "Right. We'd better get a move on, then. Why don't you have a quick shower and I'll think of some place to eat."
"Bored," he said, and turned his head.
Silently, apprehension written on his face, Sherlock got up and followed Mycroft outside, the security detail following. John found himself alone. He did a quick reconnaissance of the cottage – two bedrooms, kitchen, tiny but adequate bath – and went into the bedroom where Sherlock had laid his things out. Two pairs of jeans, a pair of decent trousers, shirts, socks, underpants, a cotton cardigan, extra pair of shoes. And, thoughtfully, a selection of paperbacks from the stack in his bedroom. There was his canvas dopp kit, as well, with his toothbrush, deodorant, razors, and shaving cream. He picked up one of the paperbacks, a medical thriller Sarah had bought for him, and went back into the front room to wait for Sherlock.
He didn't know, though, exactly how Sherlock felt about John, even if he suspected that John had managed to thaw that icy carapace. What could he say that wouldn't ruin everything? He thought a bit and then decided there was no point in stabbing John bit by bit when he'd already stabbed him once. No point and nowhere to go but forward, now that he'd fucked things up.
Sherlock almost laughed. How on earth would John react to that jittery, chain-smoking bundle of nerves? They were nothing alike at
John folded his arms and glared up at Benedict. "I will get a biohazard sticker if it helps."
"Concentrate on late November to her last entries in December. Notes, receipts, appointments – anything at all." Sherlock scraped up some amber-coloured crystalline particles from near the waistband and bagged it. He found more black hair, more red, and some blond. "Dry cleaners, John. Check for a dry cleaner's receipt."
"God, no." Mary wiped at her eyes. "John, please."
It was great. It was almost always fantastic. The excitement had amped up a lot over the last month or so – his Loki had received favourable reviews, and fans had been unfailingly gracious and sweet. He thought that one day, if his trajectory continued upward, he might get heartily sick of recognition and glowing admiration, but at the moment he was enjoying it more than he'd ever thought possible.
John pinned Benedict's wrists to the floor and swung astride him. His thighs clamped round Benedict's waist, he leant close. "Stay. Down."
"Tom, honestly," Mark said, and then fell silent.
Mycroft pulled back. "Will you?"
"Posh guy, huh?" Sherlock tried an ingratiating grin and took a huge bite of his sandwich. Needed ketchup.
"He paid you a visit, didn't he?"
"Nothing." John gave a short bark of a laugh. "Three days in here, we're probably going to end up killing each other."
"Oh, I think 'mastermind' is debatable," Sherlock scoffed, but his heart clenched again. Moriarty was clever enough to find Sherlock's weakness. And if John was with Cumberbatch, he'd found it already. He didn't value John, Sherlock knew, except as a pawn. Which, on reflection, made the term
He shook his head. "Are you – were you the only beneficiary?"
Sherlock set a box onto the floor near the front door. "You could have had professional organisers in. Don't know why you didn't."
Mary folded her arms and crossed her legs. "John –"
"Oh, my heart. When Seb insults Sherlock, you can see the hurt in his eyes…."
Sherlock. That was Sherlock. Half seven already, then. And yes, yes it was Moriarty. Benedict tried to shape his mouth into a
"It's John," Mycroft said.
Sherlock didn't suppose Mary would have been disturbed by the low turnout. On the contrary, she'd likely have laughed and cocked a cheeky, cynical eyebrow.
"I did, sort of. Agent Henreid is choking on her own blood back by the conservatory, and Agent Farrow is breathing his last on the lawn, a Sarin casualty. A few more people and we'll have a Cluedo game. What do you think?" Moriarty's smile was ghastly in the light of the phone. "Dr Watson in the kitchen with a rolling pin?"
He made his way firmly down the front walk, out to the road, and toward the little green and a taxi stand. At the last moment he passed the taxi stand, moving automatically, steadily, relentlessly, back toward the centre of London, back to 221B and its cavernous, yawning silence.
"Morans?" John asked. "Plural?"
"It was on top of the stack and you were too lazy to look for something more interesting," Sherlock replied. He squinted at his phone, then held it further away.
Eight thousand results. Not very impressive.
Kate wasn't stupid – not as stupid as Irene liked to think, at any rate. She knew that Irene had spent her whole life steeping in deceit, so much that her mask had become permanent. Irene was smart and beautiful and sexy, and Kate had never so much as looked at another woman since they'd discovered each other. Irene's job didn't matter; it was just another layer of deceit, easy enough to discern. And it might have been something Sherlock had said to make Irene flee – God knew she'd been playing a dangerous game for months – but she couldn't have dropped the façade for one minute to say she wasn't coming back?
"Sounds good. Glasses are in the freezer, too. They're beer glasses, but who cares. Thanks, Henry." Tom sat in his chair, suddenly conscious that he was wearing nothing but jogging shorts and that Graham was not only impeccably dressed in a beige linen suit but also ogling Tom rather avidly. "You look nice."
The cellar was practically empty but for some old furniture covered in dust cloths and plastic bags of what looked like blankets or old clothes. Last time she'd been down here, there had been a fairly new-looking partition – newer than the rest of the house at any rate – secured by a locked door she hadn't had time to force. It was likely storage for weaponry; she smelled metal and machine oil and the similar greasy tang of C-4 plastic explosive. It was also likely that whatever was in there would give her some advantage. It was a pity, honestly. She longed to make Jim's death slow and painful, but it would probably have to be relatively quick. She didn't have the means to kidnap him. But obliterating this house where his rotten soul had festered along with his foul body might go some way toward giving her a little peace.
The return text came almost immediately.
And Mycroft should have known. He'd been searching for years.
"Let's worry about that tomorrow. You hungry?"
A knot formed in Sherlock's throat. Four days of absence – an infinitesimal drop in a gigantic bucket. He'd lost weeks to ennui and malcontent and drugs and counted it as nothing, but four days without John had been endless. Seeing him now, so blessedly ordinary, his sturdy practicality in the midst of their lives of clamour and riot, his generosity, for not even Sherlock's own brother was as patient with Sherlock as John –
"Actually," said Sherlock, flashing another smile, "could I use the loo? I'm bursting."
," Sherlock hissed, and flung John's hand away. He gained his feet and half-stumbled to the loo, went in, and slammed the door hard enough to rattle the hall sconce.
"Sorry," Sherlock said.
"Fine, sweetheart. Where were we?"
promised. Though he doubted Cumberbatch could do a thing for John – he'd have to get Mycroft and Lestrade involved. Sherlock's reputation would be scarred for life. Maybe it was best that he didn't get back; he'd never live the shame down. He had a sudden reverie:  disappear as Benedict Cumberbatch, move somewhere else for a while – Florence, Stockholm, Boston – resume his career as a consulting detective, and carve out a new life. It was possible. Of course, he'd never see John again, but that….
"Cabs. You can always get a cab in seconds. Nobody else can do that. I've never worked that out."
"So looted Nazi wealth bought IRA weapons," John said. "That's nice."
"Time of death?"
"Mhm." Sherlock leant against the door. His head pounded rhythmically. "Same."
"Good Lord, what's this?" Another voice joined Henry's:  Graham Charles Lowe (why the man had introduced himself with both names was a not-very-interesting puzzle), looking down his long nose at Sherlock's supine form. To be fair, though he certainly wasn't feeling terribly fair, Sherlock
think I should do?"
"Yes. It hasn't changed."
"Oh, Nora, Nora." John shook his head. "You're great with her. Don't think I haven't noticed. I don't know if that's a special effort, but I've noticed."
Are you all finished with that, then?"
Benedict's mobile rang. Sherlock's mobile. Benedict scowled, fished it out of his pocket, and looked at the readout.
"Probably I should have saved him some eggs. He looks –"
He hadn't actually said anything – he couldn't breathe, let alone shout. Hard hands shoved him up against the wall, a heavy body pressed him into the unyielding surface. Sherlock scrabbled at the cloth over his head and inhaled a peculiar scent.
"She's not conscious." John looked shattered and old. "She's in ICU. We're just…we're waiting to see how the next forty-eight hours go."
"If you like that sort of thing," Sherlock shrugged. "He's not a complete washout in the intelligence department, at least."
Another few musicians would have helped, but lacking them, Sherlock closed his eyes and hummed the bright opening guitar notes,
"Yep. Come on, pal."
Mary shook her head. "I don't know. But he said it would be worth my while to attend. Trish wanted me to, and I think there's going to be some informal reading of the will later in the week, and she wanted me there as well. Apparently she…she called me night before last, but I missed the call. I was planning to ring her back when I got home from Paris, but…." She lifted one shoulder in a shrug, but her eyes shone too brightly. "
"Thank you," Sherlock replied, and shook her hand. "Are you particularly interested in cephalothoracopagi?" He pointed to the engraving on the wall, an anatomical lithograph of skeletal conjoined twins. "The Hunterian has some marvellous specimens."
“Oh, I don’t know. That was a bit mad.”
Mycroft's brow furrowed. "Stephen Moran," he murmured.
He felt Sherlock's hands on his face. Unmistakable. He opened his eyes.
"So. Letters? Any weird ones?"
John all right? Benedict didn't know. The last he'd seen of John was his prone figure on the floor of the cottage, unceremoniously dragged over its threshold.
This time, Sherlock allowed it, opening his mouth against Tom's, yielding to the warm pressure of Tom's lips and tongue. Tom's hand cupped the nape of his neck and massaged, and Sherlock couldn't deny that it felt good.
Sherlock smote his head. "I
"Erm…can you come down for a minute? I've got something of yours."
"No. If what Moriarty says is true, he's got eyes and ears on most mobiles. Possibly even encrypted ones. I don't want to risk alerting John. The further away they are, the better." Sherlock began to limp toward the door, still holding on to Mary. "Mary…I'm going to stay here with you."
“Do you want to stay for dinner? There’s lots.”
"I don't feel much of an obligation to be a generous host to people who break into my flat."
"I could have helped. I would have faced anything with you."
"It's okay, sweetling. It's okay. You're back home."
"Oh, come on," Moriarty said, rolling his eyes. "They haven't got their shit together enough to do that, nobody'd believe it. But yeah, Derry, Galway, Belfast, and Dublin will be the first to go – just long enough for people to start blaming the Real IRA. And then, one after another, boom, boom, boom." He clapped his hands together softly.
Benedict almost laughed.
"Oh, that's too bad. Anything I can do to help?"
He had more than many, many men could have possibly asked for – it was greedy and foolish to want more. He knew that.
? None of the information was the least bit practical; none of it would help him get back home. If he really was permanently trapped here, he'd go round the twist and take hundreds with him.
So sad, too bad. He dialled a number and waited. A voice answered.
He'd done his little trick that time at Bart's. Small, meek, clumsy. Don't notice me, don't look, oh God look at me. That had been fun, dragging Molly along and all, but it had been a test, too – would the great Sherlock Holmes discern the truth behind Jim From IT's affable mask? He'd even added layers, hoping for more than a superficial analysis, but he'd been disappointed on a few counts. Molly had asked him a few nervous questions –
They walked on companionably. Benedict gloried in the day, just cool enough to walk a long distance without breaking a sweat. Too, now that the pressure of his false identity was off and the return home was, he hoped, imminent, he was able to enjoy John's company without distraction or worry, and he was delighted to discover that John was lovely – quick-tempered, to be sure, but generally calm, considerate, and good-hearted. And if he knew that John wished that it were Sherlock walking beside him, Benedict didn't begrudge John a thing.

Enright stood too close to Sherlock in the lift. "Bit odd, this – isn't it, on a Saturday?"
John shook his head. "This is…crazy."
Damn it.
"Mm – fifty, fifty-five, maybe? She was my mum's youngest sister." Mary unhooked her bra and slipped a nightie over her head. She hiked the skirt up, pulled off her panties, and tossed them into the bathroom hamper. Grabbing a bottle of lotion from the dresser, she massaged some into her hands and elbows.
She considered a moment. "I don't know. I guess so. Lucie and I were mad at each other before Christmas and we're friends again now, so maybe. Are you mad at him?"
"Good enough to eat, then."
"H'lo?"
She was exaggerating. He knew she'd have loved to dress Nora up in those pretty things. And they
How the hell
"Yeah, of course I do. It was only a couple of days ago. But you – you know, you melt down from time to time, throw tantrums, and –" John shook his head. "I can't even believe I'm discussing this with you. Come on, Sherlock, let me go, all right? I just want to read."
John seated himself in the chair next to Sherlock. "If she comes back with another box of Nazi stuff, I'm gone."
"I'm Teeling, sir." Perfectly polite, Irish accent, dark eyes that watched him carefully. "Can I assist you?"
Sherlock groped for something appropriate to say that wouldn't inadvertently insult John. "She was very well-behaved."
Maybe she was stupid after all.
"His reputation?" Sherlock sniffed. "What about mine? Nobody's going to want to hire me if I ever get back home."
"I saw some plonk in the fridge. Want some?"
"Yeah, that doesn't mean that you take off running after we leave." John manoeuvred Sherlock outside. "Have a seat and I'll find a –" Sherlock ignored him and raised an imperious hand; a taxi slid to a stop. "Amazing," he grumbled, and slid in beside him.
" Mycroft rang off abruptly.
John locked eyes with Benedict and all but saw his thoughts:
Sherlock made no reply. He stopped at a door and pushed it open. "Here we are." The room was kitted out like an ordinary autopsy theatre, with the latest lab equipment and banks of brilliant lights. The body bag containing Lady Meredith Howe's remains lay on a central table. Sherlock switched the lights on and moved briskly to the lab setup, powering on the computers and scopes.
"You're still about seventy-five percent ahead of most people." Sherlock smiled at her, flinching a little as his dried, cracked lower lip started to bleed, and shame surged anew. They'd been friends once. Even after she'd committed an unforgivable sin, Sherlock had forgiven her. "Sherlock – I swear before God I didn't want this to happen." Too little, too fucking late though.
John shook his head, then waved his hand airily and gave that reflexive smile again. "Nothing. Nothing."
He debated for approximately four seconds, then sat down and typed his own name into the YouTube search bar.
Sherlock waited and watched. A few minutes later, Henry came storming out of the house, got into his Land Rover, swearing angrily, and sped off, bouncing over cobble. Certain that he was well out of sight, Sherlock darted to the door from which Henry had emerged and found it unlocked.
"Good night." Tom hovered in the doorway, then stepped away.
"What for?" Lestrade peered at Benedict. "Sherlock?"
? What's…." Horror stole over Cumberbatch's face. "Don't tell me you –"
"Of course." John turned from his magazine to kiss her forehead.
A frown furrowed John's brow. "Why would you –"
"Good." Loo pulled back and smiled at him. "Because you're tense, and I think you need to relax a bit." Slowly, her legs wound round him, pulling him against the lower cupboard. Her knees pressed against his thighs. "And I can think of a few ways to help."
He was sorry he'd come. He should have just popped the scarf in the post. "Well, I'd better be off. Have to get to work."
Moriarty swung his foot and kicked John hard in the calf. John let out a stifled yell and curled in on himself. "I said, do you
Sudden anger bloomed in Benedict's heart. Of course that was why. God, what an idiot he'd been not to see it. He met Irene's gaze, but it was difficult. He wanted to avert his eyes from the avarice and ruthlessness in them. Maybe it was wrong; surely Sherlock had his own problems, but Benedict adored Sherlock. Unfair, yes, perhaps. But….
"No. I wanted you to see her, and to observe what you can. We're leaving in ten minutes. The police are due in twenty. You'll have access to the forensic lab as you please when they've gathered physical evidence, but I need you to work quickly now."
John forced himself not to grip Nora's hand tightly. He followed the organ donation specialist nurse into the room and stood at the foot of Mary's bed.
"I'm afraid it is." Mycroft's eyes drilled into John's. "In fact, she's worked for him for well over seven years now. In further point of fact, I wonder if she didn't facilitate this operation of his. Were you aware that she occasionally worked for Lady Howe, acquiring art?"
"She's got you beat there, I admit it."
"Oh, yeah, absolutely." Molly heaved the case up onto a lab table. "Oh!" She pointed to Lady Howe's green dress, swathed in plastic and hanging from a hook. "God, I saw that out of the corner of my eye and it scared me."
"I told you I wanted us to take a holiday."
Good enough to fool John?
Sweat beaded between Sherlock's shoulder blades and accumulated above his upper lip. He was prepared for all sorts of humiliations, but he hadn't thought Moriarty would sink this low. He'd never been sexually assaulted, but that seemed a distinct probability now.
"She said three days at most." John took a deep swallow of his beer. He and Mary hadn't discussed telling Nora anything; they'd have to hash things out before speaking to her. And he didn't trust himself, at the moment, to stay neutral about her. His bitterness wouldn't help Nora in the least.
