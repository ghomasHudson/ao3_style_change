Sherlock stared. So the man was a psychopath.  Well... now was a good time for John to arrive. He had barely finished  the thought when the door was slammed open and John burst in, holding  his gun fast, pointing it at Ben the moment he took the scene in.  Sherlock used the occasion and Ben's surprise to disarm him, kicking his  hand and sending the gun a few meters away.
He gave a nod at Sherlock before taking his leave, a silly smile plastered on his chubby face. The consulting detective gave Mrs. Leverton a pointed look.
It doesn't feel like the place where he should be. And where else should he be? He can't move out of London, because he needs the city life. Where would he go anyway? London is home. London is where he met Sherlock Holmes, the city the consulting detective knew like the back of his hand.
Molly's friend Meena is mentioned on her journal (offical BBC site by Joseph Lidster). Langdale Pike, Wiggins and Shinwell Johnson are all original characters from Conan Doyle's works, although they're only a reference here; I used them just like the BBC alludes to ACD's works through case titles or minor characters. They're not exactly the same as in the original books. As for Moran, in the ACD universe he effectively wrote such books, respectively published in 1881 and 1884... xD
He lowered himself until he could snuggle up to Sherlock's chest and sneaked a hand into his trousers, biting a nipple through the fabric and grabbing his shaft. Sherlock started, then froze completely. This snapped John out of his voluptuous confusion and he pulled his hand back when he saw his partner was trembling.
"Mycroft is an idiot because he cares and will not admit it," she says. Mary tilts her head to the side. "You see, he wants to believe he is cold-blooded and heartless – impervious to
Still, he kept a high surveillance on the doctor. Sherlock would never forgive him if anything were to happen to John in his absence. His little brother had met people he came to care for and who cared for him, which wasn't granted to start with. Sherlock truly was insufferable after all, even if according to Mycroft, no one could ever be so endearing. He frowned. No wonder he'd never gotten a wife.
"Nope. Listen to me: the circumstances were such that it is perfectly natural that you didn't think of such things."
It was cold outside. Sherlock checked his watch again and frowned. 7.10. They were late. Repressing an impatient sigh, he walked out of the memorial and onto the clear white marble steps, looking down onto the Potomac River Tidal Basin. It was dawn. Soon the sun would rise.
Mary's simple question seems to calm everyone down. All fall silent. Unwittingly, you take May's hand in yours. She squeezes it back. Harry averts her gaze awkwardly.
Still, it was aggravating, not knowing exactly what Sebastian had in store for them. Nothing, perhaps. Maybe he was just messing with their heads.
Then he gulped. Moriarty wasn't merely telling Sherlock a story. He had used it to shape his very life. He had made him a "hero": and the hero in fairy tales is often the most fragile, or the weakest, the youngest. And notwithstanding appearances, Sherlock was indeed quite damaged. The fairy tale hero goes on a journey because he experiences a lack of something, and he must always meet someone who will help him: an auxiliary character. Sherlock had met John. The hero leaves home and must face the outside world, thus learning life the hard way, his experiences leading to profound transformations.
Silence. Sherlock is trying very hard not to fill in the blanks. He knows he could. With good reason.
John had laughed in amazement at your deductions about his past, he had followed you to a crime scene and had refused a bribe for spying on you (and God knows he needed the money). He had killed a man for you within two days of making your acquaintance. And so you had realized how much John needed this: the thrill, the danger, the action.
John froze. He looked at Sherlock, but he was too busy opening every drawer in the bathroom to notice. "
Sherlock had better things to do – and by better, he meant more fun. He went to the kitchen and prepared bacon and eggs. He would have preferred to avoid cafeine altogether, considering what five and a half pots of tea had done to John the last time, but John liked having tea in the morning and Sherlock determined that one bowl should be fine. He had pondered the matter very seriously and had planned what meals he could make for John if he ever turned into a manul again.
"The only despicable and repulsive thing in that room was Moriarty. Well, and maybe that Sebastian guy, whoever he is."
"Mr. Holmes! I am so glad you could make it so fast!" Hilton Cubitt exclaimed, walking up to them briskly, his complexion more sanguine than ever. He did indeed seem overly glad.
? Because Sherlock wasn't suicidal, of that John was dead certain. Well, not the Sherlock he knew, anyway. He'd been so sure the consulting detective wouldn't be the type to use drug, and yet he'd been an addict... so maybe he would commit suicide under certain circumstances.
attracted. Drawn to the lingering scent like a moth to the flame. He sits on the bed and spreads the shirt on the white sheet, distinguishing its shape clearly, now. It's just a shape. Just the shirt of a dead man.
"Why not?" John smirked, sliding his arms behind Sherlock's neck, his hands resting on the nape while he replaced the thigh against the taller man's groin with his own throbbing erection.
Sherlock stared down at the three letters. The two that had been sent to the police were unmistakably from the notepad in Henry's flat. The note that had been on Helena's fridge was a different paper, but it was clearly the same handwriting, though perhaps a little less shaky. Sherlock made no comment on the matter, however, knowing this would only earn him a stupid remark, such as 'Of course it's shaky, he was angry, wavering, considering commiting
"John, why don't you go and pay for our drinks?" Sherlock interrupted. His friend was about to protest, but Sherlock shoved his wallet into his hand and so John just did as he was told with a groan.
"I want to see the stars," Mary says stubbornly. "And I'll find them by myself if you don't want to help!"
"You too have people you care about," Sherlock countered defensively. "Humans can't live without caring even if just a little bit. Relationships. We can't completely avoid them. You can't end up feeling nothing unless you've gone mad. You know that. We both know that."
He was suddenly roused from his self-deprecatory thoughts when the door was swung open and Lestrade burst into the room. John jumped to his feet.
The cat reopened its eyes sleepily and blinked. With a lot of efforts, it brought itself back onto his legs, and approached Sherlock groggily. It looked him in the eye, then let its head fall with a soft thud on Sherlock's injured leg. Sherlock jumped and bit his lips. Straight away the cat was looking up and eyeing him suspiciously. The detective stared in bewilderment. Had the manul
John looks around and Sherlock looks at John. His gaze follows him as he scans the room then walks into the kitchen and opens the fridge. Sherlock already knows what he's going to ask.
No, Sherlock thinks. This is far more... relaxing, somehow. He doesn't rest while sleeping. Quite the contrary. This... feels comfortable, yes... And yet...
Sherlock felt his hand become colder and colder the more John pressed it. This was not getting anywhere.
"I did get his attention," Moriarty went on. "But you see, the Iceman's made of ice. He's boring. He doesn't want to play the game. That's why he's so alone, walled in his cold palace of aloofness. He's more intelligent than Sherly, in fact. But he's dull, so dull... except where his baby brother is concerned."
"I should really sleep on the couch," you say abruptly, standing up at once. She catches your wrist.
The D.I. wasn't sure what exactly. He woke up, saw the ceiling, and watched it without any particular will to get up. It was too hazy so early in the morning for his brain to formulate anything that might've helped him understand, such as "Why am I getting up?" or "Why am I in this bed?" or "Does me getting up really make any difference in the world, for anyone?" So he simply stared, lay there for a while, and got up.
He walked past you and completely ignored the look of utter loss you sent him as he went up the stairs to his room. Panic rose in your chest and this time, you were the one following him. He doesn't bother closing the door and starts packing.
John sat up, smiling. He moved back a little, replacing his knee under Sherlock's head with the rolled up towel, which he put below the base of his neck in order to stretch out his cramped muscles.
John's throat tightened as he saw the emptiness lingering on his friend's face. The damage was done. He wouldn't undo it with just a few words. Sherlock had believed all day long that John had left him.
John wasn't stupid. He knew for a fact that Sherlock was the most important person in his life. But he also knew they were not ready for anything more than friendship, and even achieving that with the lunatic git was a feat, really, with all the 'I'm a high functioning sociopath' crap. John was getting tired of it. It made him want to break the detective's defences all the more, and make him understand that being close to people wasn't a weakness, but protected you and made you feel warm and
Sherlock smirked and they exchanged an amused, knowing look. John leant in and kissed his lover briefly.
The last element which confirmed Sherlock in his deduction was that Lucy Porter, Brenda Tregennis's assistant at the flower shop, had given a quite long and very boring statement, in which she described her boss and friend as the sweetest and kindest person on earth, so simple, not vain at all, etc. If Sherlock hadn't been bored to death and stuck in his own room, he wouldn't even have bothered reading her statement. One detail, however, struck him – one tiny detail that made all the difference: Brenda Tregennis's flower shop had a very home-like feeling to it, said Lucy. She even wore slippers inside the shop; she wore her shoes only when she arrived in the morning and when she closed the boutique at night to go home.
Thankfully, John had been out of the way most of the time, and so Sherlock did not take it out on him. Perhaps he'd needed some air. Perhaps he'd guessed Sherlock needed some space. The consulting detective hadn't even noticed his friend was gone until he came back, late in the afternoon. John did not say where he had gone. Sherlock did not ask.
When reading such pages, you end up despairing. Even using Google doesn't tell you what his train of thought had been then. Doing some research helps, of course – understanding that Sherlock was talking about ciphers there, induction, famous cases in criminology... Goethe. Wittgenstein. It's eclectic. It makes no sense as a whole. Personal notes, written by Sherlock for Sherlock, and for nobody else.
The last thing John saw was her smile shimmering in the dim light, then the room tipped over and everything went dark.
They remained quiet until noon, at which point John stood up from the table, leaving his laptop, and went into the kitchen.
"Oh don't give me that look!" She chuckles. "It doesn't make me sad. It's such a good memory after all; one I'll have a lot of fun recounting to my kids. Kid. Whatever."
". That didn't say whether you'd live like him, or die like him. Oh, he had thought this through, hadn't he? Your final problem.
The words stripped his throat and John felt raw and exposed. He stood up too quickly and quashed the unacceptable sense of vulnerability that threatened to overcome him.
John didn't want this step to be a "compromise", but nodded nonetheless. "All right. I still want your word. It's important that you tell me if—"
A woman with a waxen complexion was sitting at his side. She looked like Harriet, but much older, dark bags under her red eyes. Very slowly, memories of his sister came back.
"Of course not," John replied bitterly, standing straight and stiff, hating Sherlock for being so oblivious, hating himself for being so foolishly jealous.
"What? No, of course not. You know Hilda is staying with mom – I mean, who would want to share a flat with their
But where had that led them to? Here he was, pretending to be dying so the man he loved but never confessed to (because he was too stubborn and too self-conscious and too
"Stop it! Just stop it, will you? What can we do, now? Couldn't you have swallowed your damn pride for once?"
Jérémie was flegmatically ignoring the dark glances of the man sitting next to him, who was obviously disturbed by the loudness of the music playing on his iPhone. But Jérémie was used to it, and merely adjusted his earphones, almost enjoying the venomous glare it earned him. Old people were so funny nowadays, so easily upset. He allowed himself a peek towards his fuming neighbour. The guy wasn't so old, after all. Well, to Jérémie, who'd just turned 15, he was still an old man. His clothes were unrefined and nondescript, but his uncannily blue eyes gave the teenaged boy the chills.
. John wasn't his, and was free to leave whenever he wanted. John was another human being, one that had effect on him, and even several effects, but that was beyond his own power.
John stops in his track, and breaks into laughter – but Mrs. Hudson seems half-serious. He kisses her on the cheek before dashing down the hall.
The consulting detective's frown intensified. He had not observed any signs indicating that John wanted more than what they usually had when they slept together. Sherlock would have noticed if John's heart rate had been quicker than usual, if his body had been warmer and perhaps a little sweaty, and even more if he had had an erection.
You shut your mouth. He freezes, towel in hand, hair still wet and dripping. A second later his worried eyes are on you, trying to see whether you were hurt or offended at his words or not. It is refreshing to see him so self-conscious and attentive. You take his other towel and walk up to him, bringing it to his head and drying his hair gently.
He thought he heard Sherlock catch his breath. Had this been too direct? But he might not get a chance to have the detective so close to him and willing to listen and
"Yes, just being allusive. The case must be really boring if he hasn't sent a PDF file with all the information yet."
"What, is it forbidden?" Sherlock glared. Mycroft was wearing that stupid V-necked Ralph Lauren jumper that made him look even more snobbish than usual. And he was still carrying that book. "What are
want to see him?" Sherlock spat. Still John did not seem to understand. Sherlock felt a pang of despair buried deep somewhere in his fury. "After what
"So that's why you came," he said, somewhat relieved that it wasn't about their relationship. John didn't want to discuss this again with Mycroft before he had a chance to do so with Sherlock – if ever, really. "See, everybody worries about you, Sherlock."
Almost a week. Had it really taken so long for Sherlock's words to sink in? Greg took a deep breath, and got up.
, he thought. Fair? Yes, fair. What had he expected, really? What was it he had wanted from John? The sex? Just the sex? Had he really asked him because he'd been the one to initiate it, and was the only one Sherlock could actually ask? No, that was preposterous. For many reasons it could only be John, but mainly because it was with him that Sherlock had wanted to try anything. To experiment. With him and because of him. John was central; he was fundamental, and not just random.
John was dumbfounded. The detective must've been seriously messing with his head, first acting all domineering and now
He unlocks the gun and aims it at you. Your eyes lock, and you cannot miss his determination. So you start to mirror his movements. You know he'll shoot. You recognize resolve when you see it. His hand holding the gun does not quiver one bit.
Sherlock crawled back hurriedly to avoid receiving the door in the face, and let out a low whining sound. John took a look at him, and Sherlock took a look at the scalpel, then at John's stitched hand. Their gazes locked.
Quickly you take off your trousers and put them in the bathtub, only realizing afterwards that you have nothing to change into. You repress a groan.
It turned out they had all been wearing red at one point in the week – something very noticeable, such as a coat or a dress.
Thinking that you took all the precautions to go undetected even by Mycroft, you cannot help but smirk. Of course it's high time he knew you were alive so he could be of some use, but you'll have the pleasure to contact him upon your arrival in Paris so he knows you were right under his nose and he didn't even notice.
Who cared for a palace anyway? Pirates ruled over the sea and the currents between islands. They didn't care for warm hands holding a gun to save their life, or for a place somewhere ashore that they'd call home.
He himself wondered what could possibly trigger those transformations. They hadn't quarrelled or anything this time, and John had just gone for a walk because the air was too tense in the compartment. Was that it, then? Unresolved tension? Well, then they were never going to stop transforming, Sherlock mused sullenly. John was so stubborn it was nearly impossible to resolve any tension at all with him.
No sooner had he stepped out than Sherlock jumped at the door and locked it. John just stood in the middle of the living-room, eyes fixed on the door handle. Absent.
. Two different ways of life. The one with Moriarty could have only been a one-to-one. The moment Jim decided to re-establish the symmetry, he'd already made up his mind. He'd already decided that he'd shoot himself.
"No... Look, I... OK. I'll be right there." He glances at Sherlock. "What? You want to come?" Another glance. "Hum, well... Ah, wait!"
And  so he had kept it a secret from his friend and colleague. However, he  knew John's help – his gun, and his talents as a shooter, more precisely  – would be needed eventually. That is why he ignored his texts until  the man he knew to be the killer offered to have a drink at his place,  and they arrived there. At this point, Sherlock texted John the address,  the floor, and even the door number.
an excuse." Sherlock leant back a little so as to look John in the eye. "Do you regret having sex with me?"
That was a blatant lie. All Sherlock had thought when stupid Sally's words had registered was: run. Then his eyes had scanned the room to see how many people had to be evacuated
"Well, he was more subtle, of course. He used it more as a symbol. But clearly he told you that your position was not common – that no one ever had been in such a position with me. From day one, he told you that I cared."
John blushed furiously, feeling the air rush out of his lungs at the unexpected bluntness. Sherlock's left hand had come to rest on his chest and was now creeping up until the detective traced his upper lip and teeth, which were still biting the flesh stubbornly. The hand that was teasing around his groin suddenly plunged in and John felt Sherlock's middle finger press against his prostate through the perineal membrane. He jolted and gasped, unwillingly allowing Sherlock to slip his left hand's fingers in his mouth, thus preventing him from biting his lip again. Thrashing and moaning wildly, he tried nibbling at Sherlock's fingers so he'd stop, get them out of there, but it only seemed to please his partner even more.
"Both." There is a smirk in his voice. His hands go on to your stomach. When John doesn't tease, his hands feel like a cataplasm, warm and soothing despite their roughness.
"I didn't say he sent it to the police," Sherlock replied dismissively. "Maybe he did. All we know is that he wrote it. Unless some professional imitator managed to fool my eyes, but that is unlikely. Lestrade is having it scanned and checked by a computer anyway. He'll text me."
She sighed. What else could she do? Even the apples hadn't work. There had to be something that would stir John. Other than the detective, that is.
You groan. Does he have to start being insufferable so soon? He seems to sense your annoyance and continues evenly:
She falls back onto the couch and thinks of the last time Sherlock lay there. She misses him terribly, so she can only imagine how John must feel.
of all people would be... well, romantic enough to kiss as he orgasmed. Then again, he'd never imagined Sherlock kissing or orgasming at all. As the detective fell in his arms, basking in the dizziness of the afterglow, his head resting on his good shoulder, John was so moved his throat was tight and his eyes burning.
He shivered. He had managed to annoy both Lestrade and John in the span of a minute. He wasn't too worried about Lestrade, because he was quite certain bringing him the culprit on a platter would be enough to be forgiven, but John...? Memories flashed before his eyes and he fidgeted a bit in his seat. He would never have guessed that one day he'd find his flatmate so beautiful. It truly was the word, he thought, remembering John's face as he lay back in rapture, coming completely undone in his arms.
When the drizzling turns into heavy showers, he tells himself the normal thing to do is to look for shelter, and so he takes refuge just in front of an organic food store. There are people standing there already, and they cast sidelong glances at him because he's drenched, and it doesn't really make much sense to take shelter now.
"Are you all right, my boy?" He asked in a worried tone, and Jérémie couldn't help but be impressed by his acting skills. He gaped, staring dumbly at the hateful comedian, and only then did he notice that his earphones' wire had been irremediably damaged in his fall, as if the mock sleeper had actually grabbed it as Jérémie tumbled. This was the last straw.
"Then why don't you hang out with other people?" she suggested casually. "People you don't intend to kill, for instance?"
Yes, Molly wished she could give him more – protect him and pamper this new vulnerable side to him that she'd never seen before. But she knew she could only do as he asked. Everything was in Sherlock's hands now, and he'd have to do this alone. She had to let him go.
"That's not the point. All I'm saying is that until now you've only been dealing with it for my sake. You haven't taken time to think it through because you always put me first and you did everything you thought would help
Sherlock shivered, a flash of sheer fear traversing his troubled blue eyes. He hadn't meant to offend John.
Sherlock was still pacing restlessly around the living-room. He'd been fidgety for the past week or so – he obviously hated being stuck in a flat all day. He really couldn't take the risk to go out at all until he left the country, and so had Molly do everything he couldn't manage from her couch on which he had taken up residence like a big, awkward cat. Toby liked him. She'd been very surprised when she had caught him poking Toby as they both lay on the sofa. She certainly didn't think Sherlock would be the type to like pets. On second thoughts, maybe he didn't.
And it was. John traced a nipple, pinched the other, blew on Sherlock's neck as he arched his back to the touch, tickled his thigh and crotch, brushed his hip... He teased. By now he knew exactly how to set Sherlock's body on fire, even if he was sure there were still many areas to be explored.
"Then calm down. You're lucky you didn't get a sucking chest wound, so try to keep your breathing regular, all right?"
But the taller man sat up on the bed and turned away from Moran, taking out his mobile phone and ignoring him again.
"Don't you feel any remorse? Do you even realize your very existence is an insult?" he told it venomously.
Naturally,  Lestrade didn't understand at all, and left, irritated. As for John, it  took him another two days to catch up, and fortunately, he was just on  time.
you in any way, that wasn't my aim. But I wanted to reach you before it was too late. I wanted to reverse the trauma so you'd realize you weren't alone and isolated from the world. I wanted to remind you how brilliant you were."
Sherlock swallowed and clenched his fists as he heard the door close behind his friend. He glared daggers at the toast, as if
"I'm not so surprised," John eventually finished. "I mean, Bill and I weren't together when we met Hilton. We were just a bunch of uni pals hanging out together."
"You'll have to tell me about that case you worked on – the five orange pips, was it? It still makes no sense to me."
"But he's such a child, he doesn't know how to flirt. He reacted like a kid to Lestrade coming to him for the serial suicides. I mean it, he really looked like a kid."
"Well... Her sister, Emily, has a farm and lives mainly from goose business. Don't snort, she seems to be quite well-off! She also has a bed and breakfast I think."
John had never been roused from his sleep by music – especially such mind-blowing playing. He wanted to get up right away and join Sherlock in the living-room. But maybe doing so stark naked wasn't the best of ideas. Getting up, he moved to Sherlock's wardrobe and opened it to find something, if only a shirt, that would fit him. He'd have to bring some clothes to Sherlock's room if that were to happen again.
"I don't want a drink, Miss Adler," he murmured, not stepping back out of her personal space. "I want you to tell me what you did to remove my flatmate from these rooms."
'Well,' said she, 'it's from the Good Folk I come, and they bade me tell Four Feet to carry me to No Feet at all.'
He sends a last smile to Emily and makes a mental note to stop doing that and give hope to women when they don't stand a chance. He sighs. Such a pity. She was very pretty.
"If you ever see someone falling in a chasm, don't jump after them. It is rather unlikely you'll have a chance to
"Hi! Molly. Yes, it's John. I'm fine. We're fine. Merry Christmas to you too. Look, Sherlock just ran off talking about a goose– he was in a hurry and didn't tell me much about it, but I gathered he got the case from you. Um. Yes, well... care to tell me a bit more about it?"
Well, that was something else, too. Sherlock was a man. John averted his gaze and fixed it on the scenery like his friend. The detective had been especially cold since the morning. John knew he'd been tactless when he'd rejected his touch so bluntly, almost violently... But Sherlock didn't understand. John wasn't gay, of that he was sure. ...right? He loved women, and never had any feelings, even the most basic, the most feral, for a man. Even towards Sherlock, he didn't... It's not like he felt the urge to shove him against a wall and take him then and there. The whole thought seemed utterly absurd to him, even if it made him blush in shame to actually picture it on a train with Sherlock sitting in front of him. But it wasn't out of lust. It wasn't sex, he thought; only that he wanted to possess the man completely. To envelop the porcelain body and never allow it to break. To stroke and play with the black curls, kiss the white face and perhaps make it pinker...
Then suddenly it was ripped and Sherlock gasped, hissing, trying to catch his breath as he was hit by the stench of sweat and blood. He felt a hand on his groin and screamed.
"Sherlock..." John murmured. He didn't know whether it was the light or the silence or his lover's trapped and broken-looking eyes, but he couldn't stop himself. In a second he was around Sherlock, hugging him, kissing him, caressing the back of his head and his neck protectively, wishing he could take away all his nightmares from him.
He is still drenched and dripping, but plugs in the hair dryer for you and waits for your answer, his eyes fixed on yours. He is still drenched, just a towel wrapped around his waist, for the sake of decency, for
There was the old man's disguise. But that one was too good just to walk down the street. And he was hunchbacked. Not inconspicuous enough.
"Thanks for the 'pathetically', genius," John groaned as he stood back up. Then he locked his gaze with Sherlock's, and added: "Is that what is frightening you?"
As he put the water to boil, he could hear John typing furiously on the keyboard, marking pauses sometimes, most likely deleting things that he'd just written because of mistakes or typos. Sherlock smiled unwittingly. The keyboard truly had been a good idea. Even if it did not help him find any solution to make John turn back.
doesn't keep heads in his fridge), not one of all the reasons Sherlock had told John's old buddy from uni (what was his name again? Mickael?) had driven John away. He'd stayed because his whole life was there, and he couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
"He was killed two weeks after I left for London. I had decided to shorten my stay, following some deductions I had made and had the bad idea to voice."
"You said you love me, right? Then now we're a real couple and it isn't a problem if we sleep together, is it?"
It took only a second for John's brain to process the information and send the signal for the proper reaction – suddenly spinning them, he slammed Sherlock's back to the wall and trapped him against it. Sherlock gave a gasp. John smiled and pressed even further, parting the long, lanky legs with his knee.
Elsie and "Bill" came back in time for dinner and Hilton joined them after he was done with a few phone calls in his study.
"He's been back on the streets for a while now. I don't think he's done anything bad lately – but we don't associate with former criminals, sir. He's one of Mr. Sherlock's informants and occasional muscles I'd say, but I didn't know they'd been in contact lately."
"Oh. I see," Hilton replied, stuttering a bit – obviously surprised by the categoric tone with which Sherlock declined the invitation. John frowned.
The skin of your face is warm. I imagine the rest of your body is, too. It was, last time I checked. But I won't check again. I don't want to wake you. I should probably stop touching you in your sleep, too; what would you say? But you look so innocent. Childlike. It reminds me of when we met - the way you struck me as a twelve-year-old-looking genius. You look lovely when you sleep, Sherlock. It might have to do with you not speaking.
"You're so lucky to have met such a kind man as John, and that he got besotted with you. Enjoy it while it lasts – such an obnoxious, twisted,
"Then don't try to," he advised as he subtly shifted to fit more perfectly against his flatmate's body.
Harry still comes almost every day as if he were an old man or a handicapped relative she'd have to take care of. Maybe that's what he's become, he wonders idly. He keeps telling her he's fine, though. Surprisingly, she doesn't seem to believe him.
Mary smiles up at you, clearly amused, and you wonder why you ever thought you'd be worse off with 'crazy' than with 'dangerous.'
It didn't make any sense at all. There was no pattern for the transformations, no possible way to explain them. So Sherlock had done the only sensible thing: he'd giving up racking his brain about it. He had looked, but there was nothing whatsoever in his mind palace that could help him shed any light on the situation. If he ever managed to explain it, it would be through the input of new data, and so there was nothing he could do for now.
When John opened the door to 221B, he prayed that Sherlock would be away on a case. He was well aware that it was wishful thinking: Sherlock would've definitely told him if he'd been onto something. But not today. John couldn't believe he actually felt
"You haven't been training him properly, dear," she told the ex-soldier as if having a tiger as a pet were like having a dog. "He seems awfully temperamental, doesn't he? Just like Sherlock."
As it turns out, they seem just find, Mrs. Hudson doing what you wish you could have done but know you can't: let Sherlock see her grief and love and relief, and hug him. You leave them there, Mrs. Hudson sobbing on his shoulder, and Sherlock not even stiffening.
But John couldn't. This was so typical of Sherlock, and yet picturing him trying to talk a horse out of something was so hilarious that he couldn't help it. Sherlock snorted.
"I know you're only trying to occupy my mind so I don't stiffen every time you touch a sensitive area."
It is strange walking these corridors knowing Sherlock walked them more than four years ago, not even thinking about John, just obsessed with the serial-killer and the way he managed to bring his victims to commit suicide.
John let his left hand roam across Sherlock's chest and caress his arms and shoulders, while his right hand kept playing the Double on his lover's throat very, very gently.
Except they were on different sides technically, and so they could play the game against each other. It would have been too bad if they'd had the exact same job. They would have been mere rivals, but as it were, they were archenemies. Each other's pendant and nemesis. So Jim played, and enjoyed himself greatly. Until he realized that the balance had been disturbed by the arrival of one John Watson. He realized he'd been wrong about something. They weren't exactly the same: Sherlock had
been turned on in the basement as Sherlock was being psychologically tortured and brought to his knees, and the dance that had cost him so much had been beautiful and ridiculously arousing in John's eyes.
"I didn't!" Sherlock intervened. "I tried to push him because that idiot wouldn't move! I certainly didn't intend to shield him with my own body."
He started as he felt Mrs. Hudson's hand on his arm. His eyes shifted to her, but he barely registered her presence. All he could read on her face was concern. Why was she concerned? There was nothing to be concerned about now. It was too late.
"I'm not actually homeless!" Shinwell protests, "I just... like the street. Old habits die hard, you know."
The way John lies down and puts his head on the pillow carefully, as if it were made of glass, is, without exaggeration, heartbreaking. That is, when you have a heart, naturally.
Then he thought, 'It is from fear of me that these men speak only good things, and not evil things,' and he sought among those people who lived outside the palace. And finding no fault-finder there, he sought among those who lived outside the city, in the suburbs, at the four gates. And there too finding no one to find fault, and hearing only his own praise, he determined to search the country places.
Sherlock had lied to him that day and told him to spread the word. Was Moriarty there, still alive, his snipers hidden somewhere and forcing Sherlock to tell John whatever the madman asked of him? But what was the point, since he was going to die anyway? Surely he must've known by that point...
It hadn't been easy, but Greg had been fascinated with him and, at the time, quite at a loss with a case he had. From day one the D.I. had seen Sherlock Holmes as a child, and dealt with him as such. Since the stick wouldn't work, he went for the carrot: tempting the man with cases, in exchange for him giving up drugs, had been the only trick Greg had come up with. Jealousy had never even crossed his mind in those early days of their acquaintance. He'd been genuinely dazzled by Sherlock's ability to observe and deduce things he knew he would never think of. It was strange and unnerving most of the time, but still so impressive he always wanted to see more. That, and also get the satisfaction of seeing Sherlock getting better thanks to him letting him meddle with his cases.
His phone vibrating in his pocket rouses him from his inner quarrel. John sighs. Harry bought him a new one – she seemed to understand he just couldn't use the one he lent Sherlock the first time they met. He ignores the twinge and reads the message.
"Good morning Mrs. Hudson! Sorry to bother you so early, but I was wondering, do you happen to know a place I could buy a ring not too expensive?"
The ex-soldier had then remembered that some people actually became bulimic instead, and corrected mentally.
But the smaller man didn't let him finish, and kept kissing him until Sherlock had clearly had enough and was ready to walk away there and then, leaving his stupid – and very naked – lover behind.
"Do you want to live in London?" you interrupt. There. You'll ask direct questions. Specific questions. Ones he can't avoid.
You're not sure what it is your hand did, but this time it earns you a scream. You watch, fascinated, as John convulses, his eyes rolling back, then thrashes and cries and babbles: "Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock Sherl–"
"Look around you! Doesn't it strike you as illogical? If he finally decided to kill Brad because it was his request, that is, if he killed him out of
It was as he entered the garden to the house that John realized why this situation was so foreign — apart from the fact that he was in love with a
"What the hell do you think you're doing?!" the cabbie shouts, opening his door and getting out, furious. John holds him at gunpoint. The man lets out a cry and steps back, trembling. "What the fuck? What the fuck is this?"
But the word died in his throat as the water surrounding him silenced his cry, flooding his lungs and ripping the last bubbles of air out of him.
She put down her glass and stood up sharply. "What, then?" she asked, starting to pace the room. She stopped the CD. "Is it really about
"What? No! Don't be stupid. I..." Now it is John who looks like he's been caught in a trap. He grits his teeth, casts his gaze down, clenches his fist. There is so much tension in his attitude that his body seems to radiate it. Tension. Determination. But also, fear. "I'm staying with you. I'm sorry. Kicking me out isn't an option."
"Not particularly. But buy another one, won't you?" And here she goes with her huge grin again, tilting her head to the side. She's both funny and adorable, with that expression and wearing this large greyish jumper that's too big for her. You chuckle.
. This statement is the result of inductive reasoning: until now, we have never observed any man who was not mortal."
Sherlock is standing behind you, waiting quietly. His silence is making you self-conscious. His gaze weighs down on your back and shoulders. How will you be able to sleep? You won't, for sure. "Here. The blue one. Do you want me to try to find your blue gown too?" How will you even be able to leave the room, lose sight of him? "It should be around here." You can't. How?
Sherlock steps back and takes his hand away. The void you feel just makes you want to hurl. You've got to get a grip.
Sherlock stiffened and looked up with something like horror in his eyes – disbelief, too. He hadn't intended to anger John. At all. He was certainly scared, but a little miffed, too.
, he corrected himself. Just someone to help out – prepare some tea, spread case files on his bed, cuddle on the couch...
"Mycroft!" Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. Mary was smiling. Crying, too, Mycroft noticed. He felt no guilt at all. Only pity.
"There's still some toast left, if you'd like any – who knows, you've slept, maybe you'll actually eat something willingly today! I'm off."
reading this here. If you want this file, you're going to your room, and not leaving it until you transform back. Am I clear?"
"Of course it's not all right!" Sherlock exclaimed, exploding at last. He pushed John back. "Did you even hear what he said?"
. He had known the piece as far back as he could remember knowing anything, and had listened to it countless times. Not since Afghanistan, though.
she wonders. Carefully, she stands and takes a step. The ground is soft under her feet, and surprisingly it is this detail that makes her realize she is dreaming.
"Yes," Sherlock said, taking on a serious expression. "You were the only one who had access to the room where the body of Harry Pinner was found, weren't you?"
"You were intrigued," Sherlock went on, "then in the cab to the crime scene of the pink woman, you became fascinated. You weren't attracted to me."
hell. He watched her and listened and thought that Moriarty might have overrated her sanity. Then again, the idiot had let himself get caught and tortured just to have a little private chat with the Iceman.
been graceful and wriggling his hips around definitely wouldn't help. But that really was the whole point, wasn't it? Power play indeed.
"I realised today that I hadn't actually asked you what you wanted at all. You said it was 'good', but that's rather vague too. So I'm asking you now. What do you want, Sherlock?"
"Then why don't you come lodging across from my hotel? To keep an eye on me. Isn't that what you do?"
He turned and put away the scalpel before emerging from the bathroom again, just in time to see Sherlock retreat to his room.
In the mirror, Irene saw a glint light up in her bright pupils. Funny, she thought, that contentment, pain, cruelty, scorn and pity all intertwined should give such a particular glow to her face, deepening its beauty subtly.
‘Brandy,’ they answered in unison, which caused Sherlock to send another glare Victor’s way. His friend ignored him and continued to smile at the barmaid charmingly.
And so when Yi Ling had run into the bewitching woman, she had no idea of who she truly was. She was surprised and flattered by her interest, and had been so captivated that she accepted her offer to have dinner together. They met again, and a week later Yi Ling was hired as Mrs. Salome Hupaetos's maid and live-in companion. She was her confidant and her unwavering support, regardless of what the lady undertook. She soon found that Miss Salome was not only splendid, alluring and overly kind to her – but also clever, cultured and cunning, her talent for bantering and eloquence quite impressive.
Just then Mrs. Hudson decided to pay them a little evening visit. John held back a sigh – oh, she was going to fuss.
Lunch was quiet without Sherlock, and John couldn't possibly talk much because he was supposed to be a university friend of Hilton's, and feared he'd ask the wrong questions if he was too talkative. So he let Hilton and Elsie carry most of the conversation, intervening sometimes to learn more about the bride of his 'old friend'. She was American and they'd married very soon after they met – love at first sight, they said. She loved the countryside and had told her husband she didn't mind the fields and the cows if there was at least the internet – they'd laughed and she'd moved into Ridling Thorpe after their honeymoon in France and Italy.
The Work always came first, naturally. But the point of the Work was to shed light, to expose: the thrill of it was dissection and the illumination of reasonable explanations so that by the end you had unravelled everything... and thus felt the emptiness again. You only longed for another case to fill the void and make the unbearable monotony and listlessness stop, even if just for a while. Until the next case. And the next.
"Mr. Leblainpié," Mrs. Leverton greeted with a nauseatingly sweet smile. "I am quite well, thank you. I do not see you so often in here."
Sherlock started and a shiver ran down his spine. His hands began to shake so he tightened them into fists. It didn't help.
John frowned at his friend's back and his face darkened. He wavered a second, then went for the fake obliviousness.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he fell back sloppily onto the couch, and John had to look away. The idiot just looked ridiculously
The consulting detective was perplexed to say the least. He never went out without a specific purpose. Finding himself on the street without any idea of what he was supposed to do was a new experience for him, and not a pleasant one either, in spite of John's presence. He felt like he had been transported into a Beckett play.
Another feral shriek was ripped from his throat as Moriarty kept going at him, stabbing his palm over and over again until he was so dazed from the pain he could no longer beg, and only screamed. Your breath caught in your throat as he arched his back, thrashing wildly, tossing back and forth in a frantic attempt to escape, and you observed the sweat and blood and tears mingle and running down his bare body.
This time he was the one thrusting his pelvis and grinding their two bodies together. John gasped, befuddled, but soon his face broke into a wolfish smile.
Sherlock managed his way down the stairs but his leg wobbled with pain and on the last step, he crashed.
His voice was deep, his tone mocking – the tone of a cynic. John's hand in his curls pulled the hair gently and curved around the nape of his neck, forcing Sherlock to lock eyes with him.
"Well," Mycroft said with one of his Holmesian (read superior) smile, "this is just the kind of things I can help with."
"Milverton," she spat, a tremor in her voice. "I know several people who've been blackmailed by him before. A friend told me she knew a woman whose husband committed suicide because of it."
Sherlock clicks his tongue. They have to sleep. If they keep talking he'll get annoyed. Now that wouldn't do. "You won't sleep if I don't sleep. Now. Close you eyes."
"You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!" the chief superintendent interrupted. Now go and fetch him in right now!"
He kissed the top of the beloved head, stroking and massaging the scalp gently. There was nothing to be said, nothing his lips and eyes and hands couldn't convey more effectively. It wasn't okay, and John doubted it would be before a while. He was here for Sherlock, but Sherlock knew that, and didn't need to hear it. Or did he?
It was a few days later that another not-so-customary morning occurred. His wife had come back from her sister's. Lestrade had gone back to work. Everything was as it ever was; everything was as it should be. One morning Greg woke up and as his eyes met the ceiling, as the feel of the sheets against his skin sent a shiver down his spine, he tried to sense the presence of his wife's body sleeping beside him. He could not. When he looked, the bed was empty. She had already gone.
Sherlock felt a shiver run down his spine and the bitterness of panic fill his throat, threatening to choke him. His gaze wavered. Seeing that he was misunderstanding his words –
Dropping some cash on the table, he stood and left, going to the bathroom where he'd spotted a window through which he could escape. Something was hammering in his chest and he no longer knew whether it betrayed fear, excitement, exasperation or pain. He tried to look for something to delete to alleviate the crushing sensation. But there was nothing to delete. No gesture, no memory, no sound, no smell – nothing. Nothing but John. And Sherlock couldn't delete John. He knew.
She can tell Lestrade is embarrassed and isn't sure how to reply to that, so she bursts out laughing.
Perhaps John wasn't as awake as you thought, or perhaps he did not expect you to resist and fight for dominance. And win, naturally. You must admit that you would be quite at a loss if John did nothing and waited passively for you to do everything; but luckily he isn't that type of man. If he were, he wouldn't come with you on cases, wouldn't kill to save your life, wouldn't tend to your wounds and keep an eye on your health. If he were, you realize, it wouldn't be as gratifying to have him submitting to you.
Sherlock wanted nothing more than to move and run to his friend and punch the abhorrent ex-soldier torturing him, but he didn't dare move because of the gun still aimed at his friend's head.
"It must be difficult for you to lie to everyone about this. I wanted to express my gratitude, Miss Hooper. I'm afraid I did not thank you enough the first time we met."
But John couldn't. This was so typical of Sherlock, and yet picturing him trying to talk a horse out of something was so hilarious that he couldn't help it. Sherlock snorted.
"Are you still feeling nauseous?" John asks, opening the window. Sherlock shakes his head and falls into the couch. It isn't quite true. But he's got nothing to throw up anymore anyway. John comes to sit next to him. "What did you watch?" he asks softly.
The room was erased and the whip and Moriarty's laughter, but John's screams still echoed in your mind.
being in denial – however, he had surprised her many times since John. Yes, 'John' had been a real event in his life, that she did not doubt - possibly the only true event worth mentioning at all. So maybe the detective was well aware, but didn't want to risk John leaving him if he tried anything. … She laughed out loud. She couldn't really picture Sherlock 'trying' anything either, truth be told. The man was just so... awkward. And was in fact a complete moron when it came to sentiments – he hadn't even guessed her present was for him until his eyes had seen the name tag, for Christ's sake!
Then he felt a sharp pain on his buttocks. And again. He winced and moaned, pressing himself deeper into the grass and the earth, trying to get away from the whipping. Soon he realized from the leather smell and the sensation that he was being flogged with a belt.
"He would've waited a while if he had turned down their offer this time," Chris says, ever the voice of wisdom. Mary rolls her eyes.
Falling back onto the bed with a yelp, as if someone were pushing him, John lets the hands ravage his chest, titillate each nipple until they're both swollen, red and erect, almost painful to the touch – ecstasy buttons sending shivers all over his body whenever stimulated. Slowly, one hand goes up to his throat, while the other falls to his crotch, palming John's hardness through the fabric.
With his back to Moriarty, he took a step towards the chair with his right leg and then swung his left leg up over before sitting down, arms leaning on the back, legs spread, looking straight into his enemy's pupils. The criminal wolf-whistled, and Sherlock had to close his eyes and shut himself away from the scene for a second because he felt the bile rising again in his throat.
"Well, they were just... letters, you know," she said. Sherlock could have slapped her, almost started to move, but luckily, she went on: "It was very simple white stationery, and the ink was red."
You hold the door of the coffee shop for him but stand there, not getting in, staring at him. He shrugs.
Sherlock almost rolled his eyes at his antics, but he had to focus on his opponent, who moved swiftly enough that he managed to slash Sherlock on the arm and the thigh. The consulting detective ignored the superficial cuts. The man now seemed more desperate, and kept coming at him without respite. Sherlock grinned. He’d run out of knives.
Sherlock was bored and had started experimenting in the kitchen while John desperately tried to distract himself by watching crap telly. Suddenly their semblance of serenity was disturbed by the entrance of Greg Lestrade, who did not seem very pleased.
John groaned, and became even more desperate in his rasping. Irene Adler’s voice had become sensual, seductive — no way in hell was he staying in this room while the unlikely couple got up to some sexy time. He would never recover.
"Sherlock,  I'm in love with you!" John suddenly burst out, now clearly exasperated  with his friend's attitude and utter lack of tact.
"Oh no," Ron answered as he opened the door to his sitting room and opened the window. Then he turned to Seb.
John wasn't undressing him. He was merely directing his hands to the buttons, moving the fingers around until they were all undone, making Sherlock do all the gestures and take the shirt off himself. The shaking wouldn't stop, but he let John lead his hands to his shoulders to make the sleeves slide down his arms, slowly. It was so foreign that he was mesmerized by his own moves, as if he'd never done them before, even though he'd repeated those very same gestures for years – since he always wore shirts.
Sherlock pressed him closer gingerly, hardly believing he was allowed to feel this man again, to smell his scent, to hear his voice...
He woke up abruptly, choking, coughing, gasping for air, and grabbed the first thing his hand came in contact with: an arm.
! Not immorality, no... something worse, something we share, because there's no such thing as good and evil in the face of boredom. Amorality, they say. They who crowd their little heads with nonsense... I say reality. Why do people always overcomplexify everything when they don't understand even the basics? Polluting their already anorexic brains with useless concepts. Such a waste of mental space. Minds like ours clarify things, they don't complicate them unnecessarily. But you lost that strength, Sherlock.
"You're such an idiot. Yes, you're right, I don't need you for this case, although you would certainly help me gain some time and catch the killer sooner. I did plan it. But I
Mycroft clicked his tongue. He couldn't be held responsible for Sherlock's immature attitude. But he still felt guilty about overestimating his little brother's capacities of cooperation. Sherlock had agreed to the game after all. Mycroft wouldn't have sold him for Queen and country otherwise. He believed in Sherlock's ability to overcome this whole ordeal brilliantly, if sulkily in appearance. Objectively, consulting criminal couldn't be less exciting than consulting detective after all. The thrill would be there, and as a bonus Sherlock would be completely out of Big Brother's reach.
Sherlock turned off the water and stepped out, drying himself absent-mindedly. John liked him in tiger form, but he couldn't possibly have sex with him as a tiger. So should Sherlock try to look more like a tiger when he was in human form? He frowned. John liked "fluffy". There was no way Sherlock could look fluffy as a man. He sighed in exasperation before putting on his blue gown and going back to the living-room with an annoyed pout. He ignored John, who was trying to surf on the internet but was having a hard time using the mouse properly, and fell into the couch. John looked up in surprise at the sprawled form of his friend, then smiled and went up to him. He jumped on his chest and grinned down at his sullen face in an attempt to cheer him up. Sherlock was probably already starting to get bored, after all.
"Let me finish. I also apologize for not having come to see you earlier. I had to prioritize some personal matters, as you must imagine. I hope you understand."
"You can't be Sherlock. Is there a hidden camera or something? Someone must have trained you to react like this."
There was no way John could not have suffered from it, all the more so as he must have felt betrayed by Sherlock, and terribly hurt to hear the truth from the consulting criminal of all people. Another genius, who knew something about Sherlock – and John – that John hadn't even noticed, even though he'd been the one closest to Sherlock all this time. How could he not feel like an idiot?
the sex, that he could go on without it. Admittedly today he had clearly said he wanted to try to be penetrated, but wasn't that even further proof? Sherlock could not quite believe John would want to do it out of sheer curiosity. There had to be something else. A reason. Perhaps what John wanted were further proves too, perhaps he fully intended to get so deeply involved into it that he could never deny it afterwards, that he would have to admit that he couldn't only be a straight man. And knowing him, Sherlock knew how much it would cost him.
John's gaze lingers on you. "I did that, too. Dig your grave. In the middle of the night. And I threw up afterwards."
John looked up to give him a frown but his gaze caught on his partner's lips. Sherlock really should stop smiling like that. John looked away.
"Umm... nope, sorry, that's not going to happen, John. But don't worry about my smile, you won't get to see it much."
so calmly by his side that he forgot all about his own pitiful predicament. If being in the same bed as him at night allowed Sherlock to truly sleep and have some rest, then the awkwardness didn't matter. Well, as long as no one ever saw them, naturally – for trying to explain such a peculiar reasoning to a third party, unfamiliar with their relationship and the unique nature of their bond, would surely fail. No one could possibly understand.
John wasn't as ordinary as he seemed on the face of it. In fact, what was truly extraordinary was that he only
. He's Mr. Punchline. He will outlive God trying to have the last word. - Does that make me special? - I don't know. Maybe. - Are you jealous? - We're not a couple. - Yes you are. There: "I'm not dead. Let's have dinner." - Who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but for the record, if anyone out there still cares, I'm not actually gay. - Well,
She also couldn't help but think how unfair this whole situation was. What was the point of separating two people who cared for each other so much? There wasn't any. It was absurd, meaningless, and plain horrible. There really was no justice whatsoever in the world.
"Well, you know, after detox I worked in that small café for a while, I became friends with the owner and-"
John felt something break in him and he grabbed Sherlock's hands, pressing them tightly in silent desperation.
He cupped Sherlock's face suddenly and thrust forward once to stop his erratic movements, forcing him to stand still against the wall, legs inordinately parted, shaking.
John walks away and almost laughs – the expression on the jogger's face is priceless. Then he remembers he attempted suicide barely a month ago, and forgets to laugh.
John stayed still and was silent for a second, then started trembling, clutching the detective's shirt. Sherlock panicked.
The groan clearly turned into a moan as he ran his hands under his jumper over his skin, feeling the muscles and the scarred flesh, still dancing in a tortured and jerky way, throwing his head back or to the side, pushing his own arm away and letting it come back to his heart nonetheless, creeping under the jumper or gripping the fabric, and it was as if he were fighting with his own shadow or somebody's ghost, fighting and dancing all at once, pushing back and pulling closer, throwing away and holding fast, ripping and grabbing, and soon his hair and clothes were a complete mess, damp with perspiration.
Mycroft remained quiet, his gaze heavy on Lestrade; Greg could feel the weight of his scrutiny. But he stared right back.
He moves away from her room, towards the kitchen, as if he'd been looking for her. From afar, he can hear her mumble some words on the phone, and come out of her room.
Sitting at the table on top of which he left his two wine bottles and a glass before going out, he starts scribbling something down on the notepad, and stops only to serve himself a glass of wine – he doesn't pay attention which he opens, but knows once his lips touch the liquid – the Bordeaux. He should have opened the Bourgogne first. Oh well.
Victor's gaze was intense but inscrutable. John held it firmly. A small smile made its way to the other's face.
he was being – he hated it, because it made everything harder, and only hurt more. It was so terribly understanding, so terribly tolerant and sickeningly selfless.
The woman seems surprised by his indifference, but he pays it no heed. His eyes stop on the red wines. Unlike Bill who always preferred rosé, a good Bordeaux was more to John's liking. Considering the different bottles, he picks a Saint-Emilion and a Brocard Bourgogne. It's not every day he indulges in such delicacies, but this is just the occasion. He wouldn't bother coming to this store just to buy himself a good bottle of wine. As he pays, he wonders absent-mindedly what Sherlock's favourite wine could have been.
"I'm sorry I was a bit rude myself," John was saying, sounding guilty. "Would you like something to drink? Cup of tea?" Too many words at once.
You look at the brown leather. "I don't know. Maybe I just feel there are some things I want to keep for myself, you know? If I come up with anything I want to share, I will. But I don't want to post random memories just like that. It'd be a bit pathetic."
He shook his head. No, the consulting criminal had been trying to confuse him, he should not let him win.
One doesn't. John meets him on the way back home, smoking at a street corner, a dog on his laps. The moment he mentions Sherlock Holmes, the man's face lights up.
Mary explains. You think she's very good at explaining things. Sherlock was too, of course. In a different way. You smile.
The detective let his head fall on John's shoulder with a soft thud to hide a blush he felt creeping on his cheeks.
"I'll have the Risotto al pesto verde," he said quickly, and at random. Chances were high that Sherlock would be on the run soon anyway; John couldn't remember one time when he had managed to finish eating before Sherlock was out of the place, chasing after a criminal or an idea.
At this, Sherlock turned to him, and John couldn't determine if he looked more surprised, annoyed, or... disappointed.
Molly sat in the same chair she had used the first time she had come to this office, and felt a lot more embarrassed. Probably the hair, she thought. She hadn't dyed it blond this time.
"Well the sooner we start, the better! Miss Blackwell, would you please write down the name and address of your blackmailer? And give John your contact details."
John stared, unsure of the meaning of Sherlock's words. Moriarty would not attempt to kill Sherlock before he was ready to die himself? What in the world did that mean? But most of all, such reasoning meant that if John were to die, Sherlock would die as well; that if John were to be defiled and broken, he would be too, and would never want to continue the Work, no matter how important it was to him. He would stop everything, and be so broken himself he would no longer be entertaining to Moriarty. John shivered.
Yes, but not since... Moriarty. Sherlock really could switch moods easily. John sighed and went back to the kitchen, considering taking his shower before he ate anything. He wasn't actually hungry, and he had just gone out of his way to get
"I don't see the point," John simply says. "Don't feel the need for it, at all. If there was something weird and thrilling about her, maybe."
John Watson had just got married to a certain Mary Morstan, a woman he'd just met two weeks prior to his wedding.
No. The first one is a nonsense phrase. It is as if Sherlock was announcing: 'NONSENSE'. After that, yes, all of them are the same, but always with a different encrypting method. And the last two..."
He didn't need to develop the full meaning of that sentence. His eyes conveyed most of it, and he knew Sherlock knew.
Sherlock fixed his eyes on John for a moment. He saw the concern of a doctor and the dedication of a friend. It was funny that John would completely forget his own issues, whatever these were, to only care for Sherlock. What Sherlock also saw there was an opportunity. It took him approximately three seconds to make up his mind.
"Sherlock!" John snapped. The consulting detective started a little, looking down at his flatmate with genuine surprise. In this instant, John caught a glimpse of it – doubt, and hurt. He hadn't meant it. God, if only he could take back his words. His words...
The manul now lay very still under Sherlock's arms, apparently persuaded. The glint in his flatmate's eyes was enough to tell John that he was only half-joking, and that maybe he would just be crazy enough to dissect him for the progress of science. Of course, he was wrong there. Sherlock was merely enjoying his newly-found dominance. He smirked smugly as the poor cat went even limper in fear of becoming his guinea pig.
Sherlock tried to focus his attention on the offered data, but his brain was terribly confused with the onslaught of electric sparks and painful jolts, waves of pleasure and shivers, and the fear, the fear that was beating frantically in his chest, right under the plexus, playing a drum rhapsody along with self-disgust.
He showed her to a seat at a table which offered the most delicious looking cold meal and a bottle of Champagne. She let herself fall gracefully into the chair, and added, a thin smile on her painted red lips:
I LIKE CUDDLING WITH YOU WHEN YOU ARE A TIGER, WHEN YOU ARE A MAN, WHEN I AM A STUPID CAT AND WHEN I AM A MAN.
come into the picture? John had no time to dwell on it. He now saw what his friend had been pointing at: armed men in the distance between the flames and the corpses, walking towards him. He looked back at the detective and saw him moving his long arms around, making signs that he should come over to hisside of the canyon, come to
John let out a manic little laugh. This was unbelievable. Completely unbelievable. "So this is your version of the 'if you hurt him I'll kill you' speech?"
Three years after her wedding with Joseph Openshaw, Adanna Ndiaye went missing and was never to be found. It was a blow to the poor man, who could no longer keep up his job as a teacher and opened a small bookshop. His brother, Elias, worried for his brother's health after his loss, dropped his position as co-founder of the Lone Star, and let Calhoun handle it alone, while he henceforth worked at the bookshop with Joseph. This lovely reunion of the two brothers who heartily disliked each other didn't seem to bother anyone.
manuls enough to cuddle with them. Of course he couldn't expect him to do as much in human form, because he might feel awkward.
"You keep writing and writing... You've done so much research, too, investigating past investigations. Yet you don't publish it for anyone to read. You write and nobody reads you."
"That's very kind of you, but I'm already breaking so many rules just talking to Sherlock. And now there's even John..."
"Evidence," Sherlock announced as he dropped the brown envelope on Lestrade's desk. The D.I. furrowed his brow.
John chuckles and shakes his head. He doesn't even look tired; only blissful and doting. Slowly the images of last night come back to you, and your eyes widen. Moriarty's voice. Seb's voice. Even John's. They're quiet now. For now at least, your head is filled with silence. You catch John's eye, and he searches your gaze.
In the room, the light is already switched off and Sherlock is in bed. You can't repress a chuckle. God, you're exhausted.
, Sherlock thought sullenly. But even John's smugness couldn't bring him to push him back as he was slowly falling asleep, becoming heavier against his back. Sherlock concentrated very hard to
More urgently, what could he do? Would he be able to make John turn back into a man this time, since his holding John had been the source of the transformation in the first place? As things were, they certainly could not have
The alert alarm in your brain drilled through the pain and told you this was a nightmare and that now would be a good time to wake up. But something primal, fervid and
He locks the door behind him, his long, slender fingers wrapping around the key deftly. His hand too seems so white in the shadows of the staircase, the blackness of the sleeve next to it almost making it glow.
"Is that why you are forgiving me this so easily?" Sherlock finally asked. "Because you think you are even more at fault than I am?"
His voice was tinged with panic, as if he thought John had done something he was unaware of and which would justify the guilt. John just shook his head, wordless. Sherlock furrowed his brow and leant in until his lips were brushing against John's ear.
"Seb," Sherlock says quietly. There is a softness in his voice that will surprise John, and he knows it, but he refuses to think about it now. This isn't the time. So, methodically, he focuses his attention on Seb and lets the rest of the room, with John, disappear in the background.
You would like to know what Sherlock's parents were like. Admittedly his mother is still alive, but Sherlock himself had so little contact with her, and apparently so little attachment, that you can hardly consider paying her a visit. And as far as you know, even Mycroft spends Christmas alone. It doesn't look like a very united family.
He opened the door with his card and crossed the sitting room, preparing himself mentally for all possibilities.
. For now, he decided to play along, and let John use him as a pillow. Maybe he did deserve this to some extent. Sherlock could hear the cogs in the machinery of John's little brain as he wondered if he could maybe just sleep for now and deal with this whole farce in the morning.
"Have some breakfast if you like – I mean, you made it after all – but then go back to your flat, Ron."
"You're still thinking that I would have never wanted the sex before the trauma, that you're taking advantage of me, and–"
"Good evening," Irene said quietly. Mary now stood in the middle of the room, a puzzled look on her amusing face.
That did not happen either. At dawn, Sherlock was ready to go, and they took the first train to London. They didn't have one moment of privacy that would allow them to talk, and when they finally arrived at the flat, Sherlock left almost right away, saying he had to go shopping. It surprised John so much that he did not even have the reaction to hold him back or follow him. Sherlock never went shopping; the recourse to such an absurd excuse only evidenced how adamant he was to avoid any kind of conversation.
Those pleasant thoughts and the warmth of the giant pet in his arms were lulling John back to sleep.
, he stressed mentally, sighing in contentment as he kissed his way down his partner's throat, his whole body pressed to his. That's when he noticed the trembling.
"Final": it meant the last problem, of course, the ultimate one; but also the most important one, their most important one.
"No, stop right there," the detective interrupted, pointing his bow towards John's face – and only then did the doctor notice that Sherlock's violin was out of its case, lying on the sofa. "You're going to apologize and tell me to call Mycroft or – God forbid –
Eventually, Sherlock follows John out of the bathroom and into the living-room, where he drops into the couch again and grabs the newspaper. Restless. Three years ago, he would have checked his website. But his website has not been updated ever since, and people think him dead. No one would contact him for a case. His hands twitch and yearn to do some experiments, but all his material is gone. There is nothing for him to do here. Nothing at all.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment longer before finally putting the violin back in its case and taking the plate and the pair of chopsticks.
"It's fine," Seb tells you with a wide grin that says it isn't fine but it's funny so he likes it. "I mean it could be worse. You could be keeping the shirt of a dead guy under your pillow or something freaky like that!"
John wanted to shout. What kind of wife wouldn’t tear to shred the stupid cat who apparently had more power on their husband than they did? Except that Irene wasn’t truly Ferdinand’s wife. Well, she was, but she was
Sherlock was stroking John's fur absent-mindedly. He was happy to see him here. Naturally, he realized that John was very upset.
Sometimes he moaned softly, or sighed. His voice was low, never quite coming out of his throat. It sounded trapped. His pale, nervous hands tensed every so often, then slackened and fell back on the white linen once more. He was moving his head around, twisting his throat so much at times that he seemed to be contorting in acute pain, or struggling against some invisible, malicious forces.
This time it was Sebastian who ignored him. Or perhaps he hadn't expected Sherlock's participating in his little monologue, and his next line had been so well-prepared that he just couldn't let go. So in he leant and whispered against black curls:
"I see," she finally said, moving back. She sat where she had been sitting when he had entered the room and stared at him. "Let's get a divorce, Greg."
He did not reply; he was waiting for her to go on and she relished how he appeared to be hanging on her words, his eyes scanning her face.
John put too much hope into him, admired him far too greatly. Sherlock just knew he'd disappoint him one day – irreversibly. One time too many. And if Sherlock thought he could deal with a straight John leaving him for a wife and children, he knew he wouldn't bear it if John just turned away from him, and left him
"Are you upset that he's no longer upset?" Seb suddenly asked one night when they were in bed. That was the only bed in the hotel room. Sherlock had considered telling Seb to sleep on the floor, like he'd done once for John Watson when they had been on a case that involved soap and poison and required that they spend the night in the bedroom of the victim.
"After you died I often woke up to the sound of a violin at night," John goes on, and through your sleepiness you can still tell that now he is mostly babbling, blurting out everything that comes to mind. He too must be exhausted. Slowly, you pull him closer to you, trying to make him settle down against your body for the night. "I caught a glimpse of you in the street every day. Every time it rained, I could smell your scent – I don't know why, you never particularly smelled like rain, and it wasn't raining when you jumped. Every time I opened the door, I would expect you to rush in and act as if nothing had ever happened, as if it had all been a dream. I hated that Christmas carol you played the only time we spent Christmas together – the only Christmas we got to spend together."
"I need to get back to the flat – I mean, the other one, the one across the street. Get my suitcase."
The tiger glanced at him as if he were an idiot – and maybe he was, talking to a tiger on his flatmate's bed in the middle of the night.
"Sorry Sherlock, I don't think I'm up for Chinese tonight. I'll just head straight to bed, if you don't mind."
After having pushed his clothes under the bed so that they would be hidden from view, he scanned the room for a way out. There was the door through which he had entered, of course, but it was closed. He tried to reach the handle, to no avail. There was no convenient nearby piece of furniture to attempt crazy jumps, and at any rate this was a modern lock, the door handle metallic. John would have had to find a way to hold onto that handle and pull somehow in order to open the door.
His eye caught something near the abandoned bottle of Champagne and the two glasses. Slowly, he approached and took the piece of paper that had been left between the bottle and the glass. There were only five words on it.
"Nothing. Just picturing Sherlock sprawled on a couch – it's hard to imagine when you don't live with him."
"Of course, but would you please just show this card to Mr. Holmes? He specifically gave it to me in case I ever needed to meet him here without prior notice. You see, he even wrote a note on the back."
Well, that wasn't enough, then. What can you do to help with the coldness? Deleted memories, he said. But now he remembers them. So what can you do? His hand in yours was warm this morning.
After the tour of the school area, she brings you to her own neighbourhood, showing you around as if you were the one about to move in. In truth, she probably just wants to show you everything that's been part of her everyday life for the past few years, just to share her past a bit more with you, before you start building something together. Somehow, you begin to feel a little guilty for making her leave all of this – you told her from the beginning that you wouldn't leave Baker Street, and offered that she visit the flat before you went to publicize your intent to marry at the Register Office. But she had declined, and said it would be more fun to discover the flat the very day of your wedding...
Sherlock, keeping their fingers laced, wrapped his arms around John's lower back gingerly, and started to sway softly. He sighed and brought his cheek against the smaller man's ear, and John revelled in the freshness of the skin being pressed to the side of his head.
Your eyes lock. He doesn't seem to understand. Or maybe he doesn't want to. Well, you'll have to spell it out, then.
Aiming the gun at it and keeping his distance, John turned around the beast to check its injury, if only from afar.
John had never been so desperate to find Sherlock since he had first met the consulting detective. To be fair, just this morning they had been kidnapped by Moriarty's henchmen and brought to a basement room where the madman had asked Sherlock to
"I was just thinking that it'd be funny if Mycroft had left any of his surveillance camera in the flat."
John's reactions. "The tip, then," he concluded as the latter elicited a moan, then a wail, from his writhing partner.
John brushed his lips against Sherlock's again, then sat back as his friend emitted a frustrated groan. He smiled.
Nothing was wrong with his room, it seemed: the tiger was just interested in Sherlock's clothes lying on the kitchen floor.
"Mycroft isn't Moriarty, Sherlock. He's your brother, and he truly cares about you, even if it's in a weird way. He acted for your own good. As for Moriarty... It's different, but in any case it's a bit hard to tell yourself you're not in denial when two geniuses have exposed your behaviour in front of you."
Fear. I can't tell if it's yours or mine. I'm scared. Perhaps you're scared too. Or maybe you're just acting.
"Then," said John, "when the next day you asked why I had done it, I..." He paused, closed his eyes, then opened them again. "I wanted to tell you it was because I loved you. But I feared it would scare you off. Then you made it so clear I was your best friend, your only friend, that it surprised me when you asked if you could experiment to understand your body and the way it related to mine better." He let out an unconvincing chuckle. "I accepted because... Well. I thought it might help you. If I refused you, I didn't know what you'd do. Maybe you'd never dare ask again. I thought... I don't know." He shook his head. "I wanted you badly. But I thought if I was careful, if I really made sure I wasn't doing this only for myself, it would be fine. It might really help you. I guess I was really conceited." Another mirthless chuckle. Sherlock couldn't stand it.
Molly sends him a knowing look and resumes cutting her vegetables when suddenly they hear the entrance door open and someone call out.
', which might have sounded a bit too aggressive. Or mocking. Either way, he wasn't trying to humiliate Sherlock.
Sherlock shakes his head, voiceless. A trapped animal again. Maybe he's too tired for this. He really should get some rest.
"You know," he said casually. "Whether you want Sherlock to die, so only the two 'pets' remain... Or whether you want only the 'good guys' to remain."
at the time either, because it wouldn't bring Sherlock back, and that was all John cared about. Now, things are a bit different. John has lost him so profoundly that he's desperate to cling to anything that remains of him, anything at all. And his memory
So they stayed there, cuddling, unsure as to what was awaiting them when they were found. When they heard footsteps coming closer in the corridor, John unwittingly tightened their embrace, and Sherlock pricked up his ears. He growled.
"You should take off your trousers," he says again, his eyes never leaving yours, clearly trying to keep some composure.
Before long he was looking back away again and thrashing his hips while running his hands all over his body. He hated the feel of his own sweat, the stickiness of his curls, the shivers and the blood draining away from his upper body, which seemed to be rushing to that particular area he certainly wasn't used to having stimulated. He tried to will away the threatening erection, and couldn't believe this was happening. He knew he was nervous, angry with himself for letting this happen, afraid of the outcome, and so bloody self-conscious that he realized he had never been so stressed and ashamed before in his life. He also knew that the part of the brain that interprets sexual arousal is the same area that interprets other arousal stimuli such as fear and anger. The only erections he had ever had were reflex ones or the very isolated morning ones. Having one forced out of him in such a way was definitely something he didn't wish to experience.
Emboldened, she pushed the door open. Her eyes widened in shock, and she dropped the croissants to the floor.
, too, John thought, but the kiss was so soft, and it felt so much like a tamed animal trying to test the ground and see whether it was safe or not to play with its master that he just gave up and allowed himself to become limp in the embrace.
"I'm fine, John," Sherlock retorted, standing up without taking the offered hand and with a lot more grace than the doctor. John was too busy admiring him to resent him for it. If he resented Sherlock for everything he did better than him, there wouldn't be an end to his resentment. Not that resentment was even close to what John was feeling right now. He swallowed.
"Of course, I understand," Hilton answered precipitously, his look apologetic. "Well, I shall go and get prepared. Please enjoy your breakfast – and don't worry about cleaning anything up, Maria will take care of it."
He regrets that Sherlock isn't the type to write down things or to keep documents. John was always the one taking notes and recording things. Everything Sherlock needed was on his 'hard-drive', he didn't keep track of things anywhere else.
"When I got here, I just ran to one of the doors randomly. I couldn't know which one Sherlock had taken. Well, had he been in my stead, he might have guessed, but..."
Now, that wasn't something John felt very inclined to do. At all. He groped for something to grab and stroke and possibly kiss, hoping to convince Sherlock that getting up wasn't necessary. Not just yet. His hand met silky curls and he smiled. He brought Sherlock's head closer to his and caressed his hair down to his ear, massaging the soft skin behind it, continuing down to the nape of his neck – and pressed a kiss to what was probably his chin. John heard a groan.
of the signals and hadn't wanted to risk what they had for, what? The same, with sex? Not worth it. Not worth risking losing Sherlock as a friend, flatmate and colleague.
"In any case,", Emily continued, "she is quite irritated at the moment, but if you want to talk to her–"
He was pressed yet again onto the wooden table none too gently as the devious pair of lips fastened back on his. This wasn't good. The more threatened he felt, the more excited he became, and this really,
Mary gives him a look but John doesn't see it. They arrived home about fifteen minutes ago. John helped Mary in the stairs and held the door for her, gentle as ever. She fell in the armchair and he prepared some tea for them, then came to sit next to her and started reading the paper. Mary knows he is careful not to turn on his laptop the moment he is home, or to go through the pages of Sherlock's notebook for the umpteenth time. It's silly, really, because that's what he's dying to do. But Mary is grateful nonetheless. John is such a considerate man. And an idiot, too. She wants to tell him she doesn't mind, even ask him to read out the notebook to her, because she enjoys speculating about the meaning of it with John. But today there is a more important matter to be seen to.
'It's not so much « moving on », though, is it' she mused. 'They didn't even get a chance to begin.'
Sherlock tried to get away, to escape the unwavering, assured gaze of his friend and lover. It really frightened him. What if he could never answer the confession? He just couldn't get it. The "love" he knew was one that led desperate people to murder, that was passionate and destructive and dangerous. Or something warm and fuzzy and mollifying that made you weak and dumb. But what Sherlock had with John wasn't the love he encountered in cases, nor the one he could research on Google – there were no clues, no bearings whatsoever. It was new and exciting. It was new, and terrifying.
Beds were boring to stay in because unless many people came to visit you, there wasn't much to observe. When sick and confined to his room, he would feel his brain slowly rotting as he desperately tried to put it to some use. He did not have many visitors, if any. In fact, Sherlock's bedroom, as a child but also as he grew up and when he had his own flat, was possibly the one place he liked least on earth, because it was the most terrifying one. Unless someone broke in and made it exciting, there was nothing to deduce in his own room. The living-room was good to think about cases, the kitchen acceptable for experiments. Bathroom and toilet served their purposes. But the bedroom had none. A quiet, private place to sleep. A room where there was nothing to be deduced. A room that brought Sherlock back to the frustrating reality of his body, to the fact that he too had basic needs, such as sleeping. Pointless. Dull. Yet necessary.
Well, there was always Mrs. Turner next door. Such a good woman. She was so kind she even used to let her use her computer to read...
Sherlock smiled contentedly. Not that he was fishing for compliments, of course... but still. It was always good to have John praising him.
is," Sherlock spat. John whimpered in protest. He couldn't understand why, but he hated to see his friend like this. He could see it in his white knuckles, in the set of his jaw: Sherlock intended to hurt. The manul couldn’t remember him ever appearing so… vicious. Sherlock wasn’t cruel. Tactless, sometimes, even uncaring. But not cruel. Not like that.
It seemed to him that it hadn't always been like that. At the beginning of their marriage, surely... Yes, there had been lovely mornings together. Greg closed his eyes. On that particular Christmas morning, 2011, he very much wished he had not remembered those happy times. It only made the absence all the more striking.
–and he fumbled a bit. Finally the belt joined the shirt on the floor, and he just had to get out of his trousers. He almost moaned in despair as he remembered
Yes, he thought as he relished the feel and smell of the skin he'd thought he'd never touch again, perhaps this could work. If John was going to profess his undying love every time he reached his climax or in the afterglow, Sherlock would gladly push him over the edge a million times.
Once they had closed the door, John went to the bathroom and changed into his pyjamas, only to find Sherlock fully dressed when he came out.
But Jim's henchman? He should have known by now. He should have been able to understand the sniper. But he did not. He simply did not.
"Good, good. And these gentlemen are from the police, I presume?" the man asked, eyeing their suitcase with some confusion.
"Oh, stop flying off the handle to every word I say! You're such a complete tosser sometimes. Most of the time."
‘Who was it who wasn’t supposed to hurt whom, again?’ she added scathingly. John wasn’t sure what that was about, but Sherlock’s brow darkened at the comment. John glared at Irene.
. And then he found it. Something must have betrayed his bewilderment in his gaze, for Moriarty grinned broadly.
"That's fine, Mrs. Cubitt. We'll just take a stroll through the country some time in the afternoon – and perhaps you could lend us your car so we can go to that tearoom again?"
It's already dark out when Mary decides she should do something about dinner. Stretching, she mentally lists all the kinds of food she can think of, dismissing each of them in turn. Finally she stops and grins. Well. That doesn't sound bad.
You put your head on the pillow delicately, hesitantly, as if the bed and the room and everything could be shattered to figments of your imagination if you moved too abruptly.
It is, and just like John made the effort at first to utter Sherlock's name, and then utter it in the same sentence as 'jumped' and 'dead', he knows he must not let his room become a taboo.
and that he couldn't shoot him anyway, and that if he wouldn't grab his gun, it could only mean that...
John shivered. Presently he became aware that he had no idea what was going on in that crazy little head; how Sherlock's brilliant yet sometimes completely clueless mind apprehended this whole situation. He'd been broken, but to what extent was he now back on track? John hadn't even had time to ask him about the five orange pips case... He stopped walking abruptly, realization hitting him. Sherlock hadn't used him as a distraction to ease his boredom and suddenly dropped him for the Work. He'd used that case as a way to
You weren't aware you were weeping, but suddenly you realize the wetness on your cheeks and you bury your face in the welcoming chest.
You turn to John. There's a canyon. Now it looks like a good thing. Yes, it's good. This canyon separating him from you. Makes him safe. He can't cross but that means the armed men can't cross either.
As he was staring in John's beseeching pupils, Sherlock was thinking. Hard. John truly did seem to be on edge, and the detective could see the desperation in his eyes. He must have cared more about Maggie Oakshott than he had thought at first, if this affected him so much. In which case, what could be done? Sherlock did not like the idea, but if John really was in love with Maggie, he had no choice: they had to find a way to make her understand. Sherlock hated that distressed expression on John's face even more than the idea of his leaving Baker Street. He tried not to think too much about how the flat would feel without John. He didn't exactly know why or how, but it would be different. Everything would.
"If I prove that Irene Adler is behind the murder of Harry Pinner..." He watched Victor hold his breath, his eyes widening. "...will you want to destroy me?" he finished, realising for the first time that he had given Victor everything he needed to know to indeed be able to destroy him, completely. He had let him meet John.
Picking up the manul from the armchair he was sitting in, Sherlock lay down on the couch, curled up, holding the cat against his chest. John mewled frantically in protest as he was grabbed without warning, but stopped when Sherlock embraced him like a beloved plush toy... or a pillow. The analogy wasn't very flattering, but feeling the beating heart of his friend under his paws, drowning in his scent, John thought that, perhaps, it was just fine. Sherlock found sleep boring, so his offering to cuddle suggested that he enjoyed it for what it was, and not just as a way to fall asleep. This in itself was flattering enough for John, who nuzzled up against Sherlock's collarbone and purred as a hand stroke him between the ears.
The people who were supposed to kill you are now holding you back. Voices cover John's dying voice. It isn't supposed to be like this. It isn't-
Sherlock realized who he was addressing just as said man hit John's head with the gun. Hard. The yelp of surprise and pain was muffled by the gag. Sherlock paled considerably.
"Then why don't you come lodging across from my hotel? To keep an eye on me. Isn't that what you do?"
"Yes," Mycroft replied evenly. "And I let Sherlock know. Indirectly, perhaps. Still, he was well aware."
Right. So this is what it's all about. You simultaneously feel the urge to slap him and to hug him. One part wants to shout back: you performed a fucking miracle, Sherlock, you're alive, what more can you give me? Another part just wants to embrace him without a word. But precisely. That's exactly what Sherlock is so frightened about. He must have seen it all already. Must have deduced it all.
But you don't want to. Somewhere in your mind, you know it is cruel to let him see this. You're being selfish. Still, you don't want to run. If you have to die, you would rather do it under his eyes. So that the last thing you see is him, the last thing you hear is-
The maid let out a cry. Sherlock moved into the bathroom to take a pulse. Victor gave the maid his mobile phone and followed him.
As he watches the symptoms, Sherlock soon understands that this is not even cocaine. Probably heroin. John looks very dizzy. The camera must have been hidden on a shelf because Sherlock can actually see John's face as he lies on the bed. He sees him frown before saying:
‘Ferdinand, didn’t I tell you? No live ones, for God’s sake! How do you expect to get this past customs?’
At this, John blinked... and laughed. It was a broken laugh and soon it turned into a sob, but this was just so much like
At this very moment John was drowning, and he came back to reality with a start. Right. The dance. This wasn't about wriggling his hips and looking ridiculous and lecherous enough to turn his friend on. This was about giving. Sherlock had felt despoiled of everything when dancing in the palm of Moriarty's hand, willingly, to save John's life. That dance had been an oversubtle form of rape. And so John couldn't just give his sexiest lap dance – not that he thought he could actually manage one that would prompt arousal and not laughter. It had to be more than that.
At one point it became unbearable, and he was about to say 'Enough.' when Sherlock removed his hand. John opened his eyes, and caught the worried look on his friend's face.
The manul closed its eyes in defeat. Sherlock picked a leg, held it up, and let go. It fell back onto the mattress limply. The cat was still breathing – quite loudly in fact – but it seemed to have gotten tired of it all and just given up.
"Yes, well, I'll try, dear. But even if he's not your brother, he isn't stupid. You should just send it to him. Even if he's very angry with you for some reason, he'll be too interested in it to get rid of it anyway."
There was that episode about the Lotus tree in the Odyssey, he remembered. Odysseus and his companions came to an island and Odysseus sent a few men to talk to the people of that land. The Lotus-eaters. But then the sailors ate from the lotus tree and everything went wrong. Sherlock opened his eyes.
to become a habit? They'd have to talk about it. They'd have to discuss the petting and the cuddling too...
"I know," Sherlock replied sharply, but he looked like a sulking child, and John knew he'd needed to hear it.
Since she has stopped working at the school – and she really tried to go on maternity leave as late as possible – she has been dawdling around the flat, rarely venturing out alone. John begged her not to. He seems to believe someone will jump on her at every corner and force a poisoned apple into her mouth. It doesn't make sense, and it annoys her sometimes, but she reckons it is sweet of him to worry so much.
"I was just on the phone," John lied smoothly, but she didn't seem convinced. "Merry Christmas!" he added joyfully, giving her a hug. "Weren't you supposed to be at your sister's?"
"Look, John, I'm sorry I introduced you to Sherlock if... No, what I mean is... You should still build your life the way you always wanted it."
On we go with Chapter 22! Only four more chapters to go and we'll be halfway through :) Actually I was completely taken aback when I copy-pasted the already published chapters on Word and ended up with 156 pages... xD I hadn't realized how long this would be in terms of words and pages – not very used to it, since it's my first story. Anyway, hope you guys keep enjoying!
Sherlock caught his name but wondered if he'd heard correctly. John's words were echoing his own thoughts too perfectly to be true... weren't they?
He was stuck on a train with a tiger, and supposed to get off at Victoria station in less than ten minutes.
"Hahahahaha! You don't get it, do you?" God, this woman was hopeless, really hopeless. Such an idiot.
"You're doing great," John says, caressing your cheek and chin, then down your neck to your shoulder. His hands stroked you down the spine, past the buttocks, and stopped on the back of your thighs. "If what aroused you really is what you just described, then I wouldn't worry too much. And if you ever feel like it, I'm pretty confident we can reproduce it. Mostly."
. She reminded him a little of Sherlock, in a lighter, friendlier way. "John would, though," she added more seriously, looking him in the eye.
OK, so maybe she wasn't that over Sherlock. But she had still given up. Hence her frustration with how the two men handled – or rather
, he arched his back and cried out as he fell into rapture, the ecstasy blinding him – and yet he just couldn't get enough and kept thrusting and thrusting, wriggling his hips and dragging Sherlock down into a bruising kiss. He gasped as Sherlock bit down on his lower lip and kept dancing in his arms, too far gone by now to realize how debauched he looked. He wailed and writhed and pounded against the taunting palm until he'd ridden out his orgasm, and fell back limply
"You owe me a lunch, though. If you don't want to go out, we can cook. Don't look at me like that, I've improved a lot! I'll see you tomorrow."
. What would Sherlock say if he found out his own brother had witnessed his first sexual experiences? John didn't even want to think about it.
"The man who dropped the goose as he ran into Molly at Covent Garden also dropped his hat... The hat is three years old, but a rather expensive type, so the man must have had money then, but not much since then, and so hasn't renewed his wardrobe. There is the possibility that he liked the hat, too, but since he did not pick it up, nor declared anything to the police – yes, I checked – it is highly doubtful. If you examine the lower part of the lining, you can conclude that he is middle-aged, his hair is grizzled, most likely recently cut, and he uses lime-cream."
Walking briskly through the park, John forgets all about Ella and resumes struggling with the fact that he's lost Sherlock all over again. Mycroft, that bastard. If he had video cameras, he must have known what he was up to, but he let him do it, so he would be taught by experience how pointless it truly was. Oh, he was Sherlock's brother all right.
The bad thing about December is that it is festive. John never thought he would consider festive was bad – and it wasn't, really. But walking around London with all those decorations only made him realize that he could no longer feel the Christmas spirit or anything of the sort. His previous Christmas had been a complete failure, and he could not believe it had only been a year. It seemed to belong to another time. Maybe it did.
Pondering this case, John is soon frustrated to find that nothing comes up. He is no Sherlock. A little annoyed, he folds the page and tries to read something else, but his mind has shifted to the consulting detective now, and he can't stop himself wondering: what truly happened that day at Bart's? Until now, he didn't care. Sherlock was dead, and there was nothing else to be said – no solace to be found. His brain couldn't even manage examining his friend's reasons for committing suicide. For lying to him. It was all too raw. It still is.
from the inside before. He knew how to observe and recognize the signs. But it was all so alien to him that he could not link any of it to what he felt himself; a bit like knowing the exact wavelength of a colour won't help a blind man picture it. Thinking 650nm doesn't make you picture red if you've never seen red. Well, it was strangely the same for Sherlock and feelings. From the inside, the experience was entirely different, and he had no bearings. He had a certain image of love, mainly from books and films and discussions he'd heard and most of all crimes and murders committed because of "love". But he couldn't identify what he felt with any of it. For these kinds of things, he realized, the point of view was crucial: just like two people kissing look stupid and grotesque from the outside, because it makes no sense to stick your mouth on somebody else's and keep it there for a while, moving it; but for some reason – or rather, for
Because John did get married, eventually. Greg was dumbfounded when he heard the news. The idiot had met a woman in a
Yes, it was. But this wasn't actual sex. It was nothing like the ordinary rape, violent and messy. This was
"Even I had to admit that after that, the atmosphere changed. I didn't know what was going on with my father, but I could tell he wasn't being a great host anymore. I felt ashamed of him, you know. In those two weeks between the moment I felt forced to kick Sherlock out before my father would lash out at him, and the day my dad was killed, I was ashamed of him. I couldn't forgive him how he had managed to ruin the holidays I had so carefully planned with my best friend. Most of all, I was angry with him on Sherlock's behalf."
this, will you? I don't want your compassion, I could feel the pain and the disgust in your eyes and I even
Once they had exhausted all the topics they could think of that did not include why Victor had felt the need to fly from Singapore to London to hire one consulting detective's services, John felt entitled to dive into the man's shared past with Sherlock. He realised now why he had felt so annoyed with Victor from the beginning. It wasn't just that he had once been a good friend of Sherlock's, the only one, in fact, before John; it wasn't even that he had interrupted them at an important time today. No, what bothered him...
"The one who put the apples in front of your door was a young drug dealer. His body was just found in the Thames. Obviously he was paid to do it, then killed to leave no trace."
Sherlock resumed scanning the room. There were not many customers, maybe a dozen, none of them sitting alone. Gamblers, scammers, traffickers. They certainly were in the right place.
And to stress his point, he kissed John's pouting mouth. It was so weird, that such silly and brutish contact with another person could feel so good. From an outer perspective, Sherlock could make no sense of it – it was like kicking a ball. He'd never understood the point, and had always refused to indulge in such boorish behaviour. Seriously, what was rational about kicking a ball
Moriarty walked up to him and winded the whip round his neck twice before squeezing deliberately. John's cry soon turned into a moan, then a hiss and finally barely a whimper, and you felt your own body being ripped apart as the air was squeezed out of your lungs. It sent a jolt straight to your groin.
"Let's go inside, shall we?" Mrs. Hudson cuts in, pulling the D.I. softly towards her own flat. "I'll make some tea."
Standing by the water, you suddenly realized there was no roof. In fact, no walls either: you were surrounded only by buildings.
"Why did you keep the message on your phone and post it word for word on your blog?' he retorted hoarsely.
"What are your fantasies?" he asked before he could think twice about it. He had been reading – or trying to read – the newspaper while Sherlock was "confiscating" his laptop.
talked, when he had walked in on them that morning, Sherlock naked lighting Victor a cigarette in their living-room. Or perhaps not talked, but... He shook his head, hopped off his friend's arms and took refuge into the hall by the front door.
Damn. Now you see it. On top of the table. Not good. How can you come up with an explanation for this?
after all. But John isn't one to back off before he's sure it's not just out of fear. If he is indeed gay, he doesn't want to run from it. He did fall for Sherlock after all, and one can hardly confuse him for a woman.
He laughs, overwhelmed. His voice becomes high–pitched and he thinks this is the best possible way it could have ended – he only regrets that he won't be there to see the look on Sherlock's face once he's shot himself.
"I know you know," Sherlock grumbled against his ear, and John could hear the pout in his voice. He smiled.
"So you won't return, you say. There will be no return of Sherlock Holmes!" He laughed again – an eerie, unnatural laugh. Not that anything could be considered natural coming from that man. "You haven't learned a thing. This,
make him worse too. They were an item, a true pair, and Mycroft had never imagined even in his wildest dreams (which, admittedly, weren't so wild) that his brother of all people wouldn't stand on his own, but would be one side of a coin. That when his name would be spoken, another one would inevitably come up.
"That was quite a trip," he said, sitting down on the gigantic bed. It wouldn't even encourage them to cuddle.
himself grew bored? He dismissed the thought. John could never be boring, because even when he was (and he had been, at times), he wasn't. That was perfectly logical, too.
He gets up nonetheless. Now he's got used to his nice little routine. After showering and shaving, he makes breakfast, eats it all, and goes to buy the daily newspaper. He starts reading it on a bench, then returns home to have coffee and finish reading there. Just in case he'd suddenly have to pay a visit to his smiley friend.
the cup between his two big paws so that he wouldn't have to bend and lap from a bowl. John was sending him half-amused, half-annoyed glances every now and then.
The scene is almost too perfect to be true. You like Mary's voice a lot; it is low and she doesn't sing especially well, but there's a nice ring to it. Through the window the sunlight is pouring over you. Blake looks a little dazzled, and, in your eyes, is definitely dazzling.
On the drive back (it seemed Mycroft had thought appropriate to have a car ready for her when she left the Diogenes Club), Molly took a look at the back cover of the book he had given her. She was befuddled: why in the world would he give her such a thing? Had he taken her for a complete idiot?
Sherlock provided the thrill, the  danger and the adventure. He gave the ex-soldier the opportunity to  fight, save lives, and elucidate mysteries (even if most of the latter  was done by Sherlock himself...) He'd rid John of his limp, had sparked  life in him again: out of a cripple, he'd made a hero.
mug. Your mug from the Royal Army Medical Corps. You liked it. Slowly, Sherlock opens the cupboard and takes out another one. A mug with a yellow chick on it. He puts another tea bag in it and pours boiled water. You watch him, voiceless, wondering how much you've missed if now Sherlock can do something so domestic as naturally as he used to put eyeballs in the microwave. He takes your mug and his and puts them on the kitchen table, then sits down.
When John came back downstairs an hour later, Sherlock was on the couch, his violin by his side, holding a cup of yellowish liquid and drinking through a straw, empty-faced. As John entered the room, his eyes lit up. The doctor sent him a weak smile and Sherlock scoffed. He put his glass down and picked his violin, pulling the strings tentatively, faking confidence.
"Boredom can make him inhuman, if that's what you're hinting at, I know. He isn't a high functioning sociopath, but he does have issues. Did."
Overwhelmed, John leant in once more, straddling one of Sherlock's thighs, and rested his forehead on Sherlock's, closing his eyes, still rolling his hips in a slow motion and swaying his torso. Sherlock's right hand reached urgently, almost desperately, and he ran his fingers over John's chest again with a passion the doctor had only seen him express on his violin.
She sticks her tongue at you and walks to the sofa, dropping into it, rolling on her belly and grabbing a newspaper on top of the pile.
And with those words, he went down the staircase. Only then did Sherlock look at John, his eyes already full of excitement. But when he saw John's sullen expression, his face fell.
You blink, for the second time in the evening. Not for the last time either, but you don't know that yet.
Being a manul without Sherlock around was no fun at all, John thought as he watched the stupid telly half-heartedly. He kept flicking through the channels, but he avoided doing it too much because he'd ended up pressing too many buttons once and had almost turned off the television. But the show he was watching was too crappy, even for him, and so he flicked again.
"Don't mock me. I wanted hell for Sherlock – true hell. Just having John Watson killed wouldn't have been enough."
Surprised by the relenting tone, John looked back at his friend. He never thought he would see him prepare breakfast. Maybe he wasn't trying to be insulting – no, John amended, he surely wasn't. Sherlock was terribly tactless, but his rudeness wasn't a sign of spite, just of candour. John jumped back onto the chair and smiled hopefully.
? Worried? Oh God, don't tell me this is some psychological inversion and that I'll have to deal with Big Brother from now on. Because I'm not putting up with his crap."
The tiger frowned, which only made his face look fluffier and more adorable – but this time, John repressed his laugh. He did not think Sherlock would be the type to enjoy being considered cute – and to be fair, he could relate.
Sherlock picked him up again, more delicately this time, and brought him to his own room, lying down on the bed by his side. It was funny how when they were in an embrace, or lying side by side, or touching in some affectionate way, all troubles seemed to dissolve into thin air. Bad feelings melted away in the warmth of their touch, and John thought that he had never been aware of how wonderful touching was, because you could not touch without being touched as well. Reciprocation was inherent to touching. And somehow... Somehow it made John feel better.
"Ow! Oh, so you want to play? Maybe I should just experiment on you to find out more about this whole transfiguration mess, um? Splitting you open would probably help, or examining your brain, perhaps? Since you understand me when I speak, there must still be something human that enables you to be receptive to speech, even if you obviously can't use it yourself..."
"I could tell you that, John..." Sherlock murmured in his deep baritone voice, his mouth hovering around John's ear. "But..." He gave a little bite to the lobe, making John jump and writhe under him. "... that would be lying, wouldn't it?" He kissed and bit and suckled on his throat, adding a love-bite to the already marked flesh. John bit his lip to stifle a moan.
Hello readers! I just wanted to notify you guys that I am entering boarding school on September 3, and that I will be very busy with my studies. Serious health problems also prevent me from being very efficient and quick when I write, so my updates probably won't be as frequent from now on. I do intend to post at least one chapter every two weeks, but I cannot promise anything: I'll try. In any case, you can trust me for not dropping this story: I enjoy writing it even more than you enjoy reading it, and I'll do my best to keep the updates as frequent and regular as possible. More than ever, reviewers are loved!
"The penknife with which Beppo had stabbed Pietro to death was hidden in one of the busts the art student had sculpted and he was stupid enough to try and retrieve it instead of just leaving it there in the house of some blessedly ignorant people..."
You look at her for a moment – really look at her, not like Sherlock would've looked at someone of course, observing and deducing their whole lives, because you're incapable of that. But still you look, and try to see who the person in those funny salmon-coloured dungarees is, reading a book in a bar even though she's trying to meet someone, sticking her tongue at the first person whose gaze she meets...
John ground his own clothed torso against Sherlock's unguarded chest, so pale but already reddening under the friction, his nipples sticking out, hardening and reacting madly to the stimulation.
"You'd be bored," Sherlock whispered, relaxing as he slowly but surely put the situation under control. "You won't do it, because you would be bored without me."
Shinwell Johnson was currently dating Molly Hooper, and had even moved in with her. He'd told Wiggins that he hadn't said a word about his link to Sherlock to her.
Did Sherlock believe himself to be some kind of colonel? More importantly, how was John supposed to report in this form? This was just ridiculous.
She didn't know how to finish her sentence, wasn't even sure she could say things clearly. Again, she cast a sidelong glance at Wiggins, still sitting in the corner imperturbably.
She slips out of your arms with a sigh to get a glass of water. She drinks it as if it were a Bloody Mary; as if she needed to get drunk.
"We always transform at night," Sherlock pointed out, "but you probably woke up in the middle of the night, and so realized it earlier than usual. Then since you came here, you're already back to human this morning."
playing that again! - Why not? - Because it's not actually possible for the victim to have done it, Sherlock, that's why. - Well, it was the only possible solution. - It's not in the rules. - Then the rules are wrong!
He was greeted only by the silence and started to feel awkward. He went to the kitchen and checked the fridge – empty, of course. They hadn't had time to go grocery shopping these past few days. John looked at his watch and asked again:
Sherlock furrowed his brow adorably, and wondered what kind of teenager John could have possibly been.
The flat Sherlock had decided to rent was the one Ludmila Dyachenko had lived in almost three years before. It was small and not very furnished, but that did not matter. Its asset was its location. It was exactly across the street from 221B.
"Here's the sentence: 'Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.'
At these words, Victor arched an eyebrow, and Angelo mellowed. "Good, good. You're most welcome, of course! And naturally, John, I never doubted you. We wouldn't want to get Sherlock hurt, would we?"
Sherlock could always see right through everyone, no matter how you tried to hide. He certainly wasn't used to being the one read like an open book. But he'd had such a twisted relationship with Moriarty. John could still remember how excited the detective had been upon first hearing the name (from the quivering lips of a dying man – it surely had added effect), and also his thrill at being targeted by a criminal mastermind – a real, clever one. A true
