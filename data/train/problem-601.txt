“That would not be advisable.” The call disconnected with a beep. John checked the history on his phone, but just as he suspected there was no sign of any call.
“You don’t seem very frightening,” he shot back instantly.  “Why am I here?”
“This is dull.”
John shook his head, something sad playing behind his eyes. "I practically tore the house to pieces looking for you before I ever saw that text. I thought someone had taken you. Maybe I overreacted, but maybe I didn't. If you'll remember, you just got out of the hospital yesterday from your last abduction."
“I knew what I was doing John. He barely broke the skin. Look, it didn’t even need stitches and it’s almost gone now.” Sherlock raised his head to show the thin red line, determined to prove his point. “Some of the other cuts are healed entirely. My arm doesn’t even hurt!” Sherlock began to wave his previously injured arm around. “I’m fine!”
“Sorry. I’ll shut up.” John kicked himself. He sounded like a pup with his first crush.
The alpha inclined his head slightly and smiled another bitter little smile. “You’ve met Sherlock. How many friends do you imagine he really has?”
“You’re serious right now?” John asked “You’re actually serious right now?”
Sherlock was fascinated by John. After a few moments he reached forward and began to trail his fingers across the other man’s chest, exploring John’s past with the tips of his fingers. John sucked in a breath at the contact, but seemed content to watch Sherlock with heavily lidded eyes as the omega caressed his skin. The most obvious thing that Sherlock noticed was that John was still very fit despite his injuries; the smooth lean muscles spoke of practical strength versus the intentionally bulked out look that some alphas tended to prefer.
“You’re very loyal, very quickly.” The man replied with a considering look on his face.
When John disappeared behind the barrels, Sherlock sucked in his breath. He wanted nothing more than to stand up and shout to John, to tell him that he was
"A murder we didn't need you on, actually," Greg spoke up without thought. The look that Sherlock shot him was practically poisonous. "We had to evacuate half the team because of you. This is an active crime scene. I have a job to do, and you managed to chase off most of my best people."
Sherlock, as it turns out, didn’t have to say anything at all. John stood suddenly out in the open, moving forward with those smooth, predatory movements as he made his way towards the centre of the room, gun clasped firmly in hand.
"I was completely fine," Sherlock muttered as he looked down at his lap, pretending not to have noticed the aborted gesture. "I can take care of myself."
chair and drinking
Sherlock's eyes were angry slits as he stood to look at Mycroft. “You know what I want. I want to live my life. If you can’t fix it for me, I will have to find someone else.”
Constructive criticism is absolutely welcome and appreciated!
to grasp Sherlock by the shoulders; desperately trying to show the other man how serious he was about this.  “Sherlock, if we were already in bed with my teeth on your neck and you changed your mind, I would stop. I would help you however I could, even if that meant helping you leave. I swear.”
Sherlock could feel the smile against his skin as John pulled his hand up between them, pressing a gentle kiss against his knuckles. “Thank you.”
“I have to register” Sherlock stated shortly.
“If you would simply answer my calls then this,” Mycroft gestured mildly around the room, “would be unnecessary.”
“Of course I did.” John snorted. “I couldn’t believe that he had even thought that I would agree to that.” John watched as Sherlock winced slightly at his words. “He seemed under the impression that that was the only way someone would agree to bond with you.”

He gathered his clothes quickly and darted out of the room, not even stopping to dress until the door had closed silently behind him.
in the market for a bondmate after all.
“Did you have somewhere specific in mind? We could get out, get a taxi or something. I want you to be comfortable.”
“I’ll get the boys on it and call if I have any other questions.” Lestrade said as he wrote everything into his notebook. “It would be helpful if you were to answer your phone.”
The scent of oranges and cloves was intoxicating in the closed confines of the car, nearly making John’s head spin as he sat near the omega. Not nearly close enough, some part of himself insisted forcefully, but John pushed the thought away firmly. He wasn’t going to spook Sherlock by attacking him the moment that they were alone.
“Well, that’s comforting.” John looked around the house. The grandma chic theme continued inside as well. There were vases of flowers and doilies on every table. Expensive looking knickknacks were arranged neatly on shelves and tucked into alcoves. The sofa was a rather alarming shade of pink and covered in plastic. “This is not what I would have pictured for Mycroft’s house either.”
Sherlock refused to move, focusing on maintaining his breathing as he slowly adjusted to his situation. This was very not good. Sherlock hadn’t been caught like this in years, and at least last time he had known exactly
John looked around the shop and spotted the sales assistant in one of the aisles shelving books. He was just moving towards her to see if there was a back door he might be able to use, when his phone began to ring. He looked down at the small device in his hand; there was no number on the screen. Against his better judgment John answered the phone, turning to keep an eye on the silent car as he spoke. “Hello?”
Sherlock was silent for a few moments as he stared into the middle distance. If John hadn’t been watching carefully, he would have thought that the man was ignoring him completely. The way he was worrying his lip ever so slightly with his teeth gave him away. “No.” Sherlock finally admitted as he stretched his legs out in front of him with a slightly weary sigh. “Not really. My apartment isn’t exactly… conductive to going into a heat. And I have very little desire to go back to whatever government bedsit they set you up in. The walls would be far too thin for one, and I don’t particularly want to drive everyone out of the building.” John suppressed a smile at the very faint slight pinkness that brushed across Sherlock’s cheeks, even as his voice and general demeanour suggested that he really couldn’t care less. “I suspect that wherever Mycroft is sending us will already be prepared with anything we could ever possibly need, and more besides.”
John wanted nothing more than to lie in his bed and not leave it again; which, incidentally, is the reason he was limping through the park. The temptation was strong and it was one of the rare clear and sunny days in London; he decided to escape the sad little room he now occupied in search of brighter pastures.
John looked up at the tall man. Biting his lip briefly he opened his mouth to respond just as someone burst loudly through the morgue door.
John was up in second, hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. “Lay down Sherlock!” The alpha hissed, pressing him back into the mattress. “Omega healing or not, you are still injured!”
John's face burned as red as he took in the picture that he must make, kneeling on the floor in the midst of a panic attack. He really hoped that Sherlock was right and that Mycroft didn't have cameras in the house. John would never be able to look the older alpha in the face again.
In retrospect, Sherlock could have been paying more attention his surroundings. His mind was still caught up in the puzzle that was Dr John Watson as he made his way down the darkened street towards home. The man in the green wool scarf didn’t warrant a second look, until he felt the hand at his shoulder and the syringe pressing into the side of his neck.

So when she haunted me — gave me marching orders into hell — I knew what needed to be done.
. Still.
Sherlock watches him from through the glass French doors. Sees his brother’s eyes widen, his jaw clench. Sees his hands ball into fists. Sees him end the call, then reenter the dining room like a man walking to his doom.
And then… They collide. Like ships that have passed in the night for too long. Like lorries crashing. Like a fucking asteroid hitting a shooting star. And it is wonderful.
He is yelling somehow, and his hands are shaking. His whole body is shaking, and it’s like being on cocaine all over again. His skin is covering live wires; sparking and shocking and burning up. He still can’t tell if it is anger or fear that is coming off him in waves, but it’s enough to make his knees go weak as his heart ricochets off his rib cage.
And then, there’s nothing more to it, than to do it. He dresses in his best suit, and winds his favourite blue scarf around his neck. He swings his coat around his shoulders, pops the collar, and even grabs the death-frisbee hat. He slinks back to his room, presses a final kiss John’s hair, and then he is gone.
It’s a week and a day till impact, and Sherlock has been vetted, trained, and analysed six ways from Sunday to make sure he is mentally and physically fit enough for this mission. After Serbia, what the hell else matters.

They fall into a peaceful sleep, because for that moment, and that moment only, the world is exactly as it should be.
With a world-weary sigh, as though thoroughly resigned to the fact that the world appears to be conspiring with his little brother to make that particular moment as vexing as possible, he excuses himself to the lobby to answer the call — heaven, hell, or the purgatory that was the Diogenes club forbid that he do something so low brow as to answer his phone at the table.

‘I know you do,’ Sherlock says, his voice breaking, ‘As do I. I’m so sorry, John. It’s all my fault. I killed our son.’

is the message,’ he sighs, steeling himself, ‘I’ll have to go. Do we… Do we know how long I have?’
In the end, it’s Sherlock’s way. Always his way.
Sherlock wordlessly passes John the stack of photographs, and watches him carefully as John appraises each one slowly, the crease between his brows deepening with every new shot. When he gets to the final one, the one of Sherlock walking in the lane, and Moriarty’s scrawled message, the pile slips lightly from his hands and lands on the counter beneath them. He visibly blanches, and a muscle in his jaw jumps.

In answer, his brother reaches back into his briefcase, and pulls a large envelope from it, and hands it wordlessly to Sherlock. Sherlock notices the broken wax seal, the sturdy quality of the manilla envelope, but nothing could have prepared him for what was inside.
It’s the second time John has buried Sherlock, and the coffin is just as empty as it was the first time, but now there is no hope that Sherlock might have fucked off to adventures unknown to play the hero. There is evidence, in the way of transmissions, up until the moment of impact. This time, there will be no miracle resurrection.
gotten to John.
The best mathematicians in the country tell Mycroft there are approximately three weeks before impact. He makes them all sign NDAs, and sends them on their way.
He punched me in the face.
He turns the kettle on, and sets about putting the shopping away while he waits for it to heat up, then makes a cup of tea to John’s exact preference, like he has done three times a day for the last two months. He carries it carefully to the darkened bedroom, and pads across the room quietly, kneeling down on the floor by John’s side of the bed, setting the cup and saucer on the bedside table. John is laying on his back in bed, staring at the ceiling, and making no indication he even notices Sherlock’s presence.
“Ah, Mr.–” he begins, but he suddenly frowns. His lips form “Holmes,” but his voice is cut off like a muted telly. He quickly clears his throat and tries again, but still in vain.
don’t have any cases going on. What else am I supposed to do?”
“Your back also feels cool to the touch,” Sherlock said, “but you still worry me. Come, doctor, diagnose yourself. What ails you?”
“You remember that mold you threw out?” Sherlock finally said.
But John was no longer on the couch, where he had begun his nap; nor was he on the floor, where he had subconsciously feared his nap would end. From what he could tell in the dim moonlight, he was lying on his back in a bed. Both the bed and bedroom seemed somewhat familiar, but he could tell something was off. The bedroom was the same shape as the one he knew in Baker Street, but, from what he could see in the darkness, the walls were decorated with intricate wallpaper, three paintings, and a grandfather clock; the furniture was a great deal finer, mostly antique looking. The bed was in the same position as he was used to: in the left corner of the room, but the mattress was very hard, and he was sure he felt springs in his back.
“Oh,” John said. “Are you planning on actually sleeping tonight?”
“Thank you, Collins,” Sherlock says through the window. He has also long since learned to be polite with Collins, no matter the efficiency of his driving. Sherlock turns on his heel to face the sidewalk and whatever the future has in store with this potential flatmate.
After all, John had never dreamed about a kiss or anything; Holmes stroking Watson’s foot with his ankle was the most physical they ever were. It was mostly from their shared glances and subtle remarks that he gleaned romance. He and Sherlock had just as many shared glances and even full on stares. Their conversations often contained innuendo that Sherlock didn’t seem to pick up on. They brushed shoulders more than strictly necessary. People were constantly mistaking them for a couple.
“You deleted him, didn’t you?” John said, rolling his eyes.
going to try lucid dreaming tonight,” John said as they trudged up the stairs to the flat. The adrenaline high of the solved case hadn’t lasted for very long, though it had been nice to be active again. “I know you want to learn something new, but it’s too much tonight.”
“John Watson,” the man says, smiling.
Watson turned to the fourth page of his newspaper. He hadn’t really been reading it; the words kept blurring as if he didn’t know how to read.
John got the kettle boiling and started rooting around for today’s new location of the tea. It was usually either a cupboard above or next to the stove – you know, a sensible place – but it tended to migrate whenever Sherlock was in charge of making tea, which he had already done for himself before John had come downstairs. All of the normal tea locations turned up empty. As he searched, his mind buzzed on.
“Normal Holmes-and-Watson things.”
“You really should, Sherlock, especially after an all-nighter. The couch is alright, but not great for sleeping on.”
“Right. You seem to have retained that little nugget of knowledge from your school days. I don’t know much about Tsar Alexander II, either, but-”

“What’s up with your accent?” John blurted out, as if that was the most pressing detail of their situation, “You've gone all posh for some reason.”
John took off his coat. “I thought you said you had to go to Scotland Yard, to finish talking with DI Lestrade?”
He glanced over to the living room table, where his cane was still hanging on the back of a chair, where he had left it, for the second time that night, before running after Sherlock without his leg giving him any trouble. He smiled.
Another shared grin.
“Actually, same-sex marriage has been legalized.”
“It’s Holmes,” Sherlock says as he approaches.
Leaving the vaguely oriental sounding music of the restaurant, Sherlock and John walked outside to find the pavement mostly deserted; it was the middle of the night, after all. For late January, it was fairly warm, but the air was still brisk enough to be refreshing.
“’Close?’ I need more information than that.”
“If I even have a Victorian dream, or dream at all.”
“If he has survived this long with you, I don’t think that will be a problem. He…” and out of nowhere, John’s vision blurred. The voice of 21

“I know everything about London.” Sherlock walked as if he were a king.
Waking up in the morning was the worst part of the day in Molly’s opinion. Her only consolation to getting herself out of bed every day was the opportunity to carry on her duties and research in the morgue. Still, even that consolation sounded pretty rotten when she thought about it: looking forward to working with

John wanted to say that Holmes and Watson apparently did things “offstage” while he wasn’t dreaming, but that was something he didn’t want to go near right now.
died on his tongue when Sherlock spoke.
DI Lestrade didn’t have any cases that he needed help with (or, that he admitted he did), so Sherlock was stuck in the flat for the majority of the week. He became the mid-thirties equivalent of a grounded teenager. John was disappointed, too, as he was looking forward to working with the police again. More than that, though, he couldn’t wait to see Sherlock in action again; he had never seen anything like him when he figured out half of the case based off of Jenifer Wilson’s jewelry and lack of a mobile phone.
Sherlock was sitting at the kitchen counter and had already unpacked a new lens for his microscope and was putting it to use; he gestured arbitrarily in answer since he couldn’t be bothered to speak. Speed walking, John retrieved a pair of dress trousers from the bathroom where Sherlock had been getting ready for the day, threw them in his general direction, grabbed the newspaper from the coffee table, and plopped down in his chair… facing
. They had already spent a lot of time together during their short acquaintance, so he felt that they had parted ways for the night abruptly, though there hadn’t really been anything terse about it. Sherlock was nothing like what John had been expecting to come from Mike’s recommendation of a flatmate, but he realized that anyone else would have been extremely boring in comparison.

“2010? Dear Lord, what is your London like?”
The only sound in the living room was the clack of keys against John’s fingers; he was researching a few technical details of the last case that had not made sense to him before he started his write-up. As suddenly as summer lightning, there was something moist touching the cartilage of his ear that was soon replaced by gentle compression surrounded in heat. There was a mouth on his ear. A very curious mouth, it seemed. John just barely kept himself from bristling. He was still so unused to this tender relationship he now had with Sherlock. In these early stages, any unthinking disapproval towards genuine shows of affection – even ear nibbling, a sensation John had never experienced before – could cause the loss of a lot of ground in Sherlock’s perspective on the various aspects of romance and love as a whole. Sherlock needed affirmation and John was going to give it to him… even if that meant jumping out of his skin from time to time. So, John turned in his chair, craned his neck, and met the lips that were there waiting for him.
“Actually, I’ve just thought of something. I can’t believe I’m just now remembering this!”
He sat up and reached out to the left for the button on his bedside table lamp. But the lamp was not there. Before he could make this discovery, he realized that he was on the side of the bed next to the wall, the right side, which was not his habit. Ordinarily, this would not have prevented him from turning on his lamp: a few scoots to the left and he would be at the other edge of the bed and the lamp would be within arm's reach.
By the time Mrs. Hudson finally answers the door, she is greeted by the pleasantly surprising sight of her tenant hand in hand with who she assumes is his new flatmate.
7. Lazy
John thought over everything that had happened: seeing the flat, examining Jennifer Wilson’s body, leaping across rooftops, shooting the cabby, and their two dinners in nearly as many hours. He wouldn’t hesitate to say that it had been one of the best days of his life, certainly the best in a while. There would obviously be times when he and Sherlock wouldn’t get along like all flatmates; they had already argued and bantered enough to pass as brothers. Even so, John hadn’t felt this much at ease since his last night in the barracks, surrounded by his friends, before getting shot. He still missed James, Bill, and his other mates, but he felt like this was a good step towards moving on from that life.
drifted into Watson’s mind, but he didn’t stop to consider. Holmes sat in his chair nearby, reclining luxuriously.
John wondered if he was expected to ask polite questions about this. He had been thinking far too much about Sherlock and his bed recently to prevent a slight blush at the very mention of the subject.
from the kitchen. A sound issued from behind him that John only recognized as a chuckle from his three months in Baker Street; he snapped open the newspaper in reply.
John knew that homophobia had been raging in those times; in his second dream, Holmes had mentioned the recent assassination of Tsar Alexander II. After looking up that date on Google, he figured the dreams were taking place around the turn of the 20
“Certainly! I have clients from all over Britain. My John and I have only known each other for eleven days and he has only had two cases to accompany me on, but I am sure his name and face will become associated with mine soon enough.”
he wanted to ask but didn’t.
“I… look, I don't remember that conversation… or that night.”
John attempted a slightly different angle on the couch and counted some sheep, but soon gave it up, kicked the blankets off, and stood. He stripped the couch, folded the linens in neat squares, and stored them in a closet near the bathroom where they looked like they might belong.
long! I was going to say that I wasn’t going to tell you, but I would like to avoid sleeping there tonight to see if anything changes without a fresh dose of bodily oils; I was up all night on my laptop last night, sitting in my chair, so it wasn’t an issue. So I’ll sleeping on the couch tonight. Just in case you came downstairs and wondered.”
They shared a grin.
“Now what’s the matter?” Sherlock asked, looking over his shoulder at him from the bookshelf.
“No point in calling another cab; Baker Street isn’t far from here.”
Despite his best efforts, John eventually fell asleep around 1 a.m. with the medical journal tented on his chest. When he looked at his alarm clock, it was just after 8 a.m. He sat up to stretch and his secondary pillow, the one he didn’t usually use, had a clear indentation. He blinked; the part of the blanket on that side of the bed looked completely unchanged.
“I am surprised you made it thus far,” Holmes said, cocking an eyebrow, “It appears that our universes are not completely synchronized.”
"Well, you don't have to just take care of yourself anymore, do you?" John smiled faintly. "We're a team now. We take care of each other. If you want to go chasing dangerous criminals all over London at least let me know first so I can get my gun. I'm here to watch your back, yeah? "
“Not in particular no.” john shook his head, confused. “Why?”
“Good.” Suddenly John was leaning across the bed. Sherlock expected him to immediately go in for a bruising kiss, and was surprised when John reached out a hand to touch Sherlock’s cheek, fingers trailing down to cup his cheek. “You are beautiful, do you know that?”
John strode up to a rather pretty dark-haired woman tapping on the blackberry as she waited on the sidewalk. She didn't bother to look up as she reached out with one hand to open the car door for him. "After you." Her voice was light and feminine, and exactly the opposite of the voice that John had wanted to hear this morning.
"Then why are you so upset?" Sherlock asked suspiciously, feeling like he was walking into some form of trap.
John blinked, surprised. “I got shot.”  He replied, carefully neutral.
“Well,” Molly started with false cheer, trying desperately to find a bright side, “if you have to register at least you know that they will find the perfect match for you. People like me… we have to make the best go of it we can.”
Mycroft looked at John with an unfathomable look as he continued his call. “You have fifteen minutes to find him, or you will find yourself to be redundant.” The alpha hung up the phone with a flick of his wrist and placed it delicately back into his pocket.
*****
Sherlock made a noise low in his throat, trying desperately to alert John to his presence. The cold burn of the knife held tight on his neck had the small sound dying before it could reach his lips. His hands and feet were still tied securely, and Robert held him with enough experience that he knew he couldn’t get away from the knife in time to avoid having his jugular cut. He was helpless to do anything but watch between the crates as John stepped forward, moving deeper into the room.
“Wait just a second.” John broke in, eyeballing Mycroft. “Sherlock is your brother then? After all of that toss about enemies, and arch enemies, you’re just his big brother?”
John looked at him sceptically. “I’m a little old for recruitment into MI6, aren’t I?”
Shrugging it off John replied. “Don't worry about it. I knew what I was signing up for. I just wish I could go back and finish up my tour with the rest of my mates. I don't know how they will make it without me,” John joked weakly.
John had learned more about the hidden inner workings of the English government in the last few minutes while listening to Mycroft bark orders over the phone than he had ever thought to know. However, he honestly couldn’t focus on the man, the orders, or the buildings flying by outside the window as they raced closer to Sherlock.
“Anything thing on the menu, whatever you want, for free,” he boomed in that deep voice. At John’s look he continued. “This man got me off of a murder charge. He cleared my name!”
“Mike!” he called in greeting. “It’s been ages! How are you? How are Helen and the girls?”
“Sherlock,” John let out an incredulous little laugh, “I’ve known you three days and it’s happened once. As far as I know, you’re due another.” Had it really only been three days? John felt like he had known the strange and brilliant omega for so much longer than that.
Angelo seemed used to Sherlock’s disappearing act John noted as he made his excuses to the still brightly smiling man. As he walked outside, he thought for a moment about flagging down a taxi, but the night air was cool and pleasant. Perhaps a walk would help clear his head, he decided. He could always get on the tube if he wanted to hurry back to his bedsit, he thought with a snort.
“I’m a simple man.” John laughed looking up from the menu. “I’ll order the spaghetti and be happy for it.” As Sherlock locked eyes with him, he suddenly realized what was happening. “Sherlock,’ he said with an odd note to his voice, “is this supposed to be a date?”
"What do you mean no?" Sherlock asked suspiciously.
“Christmas has come early.” Sherlock laughed as he rushed to gather his things. “Who’s on the scene?”
After what may have been fifteen minutes or five hours for all John knew, Mycroft hung up the phone. “They have confirmed 6 hostiles within the warehouse, though we are not ruling out the possibility there may be more. We have established a visual on Sherlock, he is a bit worse for wear but he has regained consciousness.”
“Is enjoy really the right word for that?” John asked.
“Exactly.” the man smiled predatorily at Sherlock.
Mike laughed, wheezing a little from the unaccustomed exertion as he cuffed John on what was thankfully his good shoulder. “Good as always, they are keeping me on my toes. How about you? Last I heard you were off getting shot at. What happened?”
“Of course John,” Sherlock’s answer was immediate. “It is important that we are always honest with each other.”
I'm already diligently typing away on the next installment so please keep an eye out for me!
John's alpha instincts were having none of it. He had woken up on the day after his bonding and his mate was gone. ‘We should be together, establishing our bond.  Where is he?'  Checking each room he passed, John fought against the steadily rising panic as instinct warred against his rational mind.
He could feel the knot began to swell as John moved inside him, each movement bringing a fresh wave of bliss crashing down over him as he hit that spot over and over. An endless stream of incomprehensible pleas and moans poured from his mouth as John set the pace. It was all he could do to keep his hands knotted in the sheets as the feelings rained down on him.
They were the only people for several feet in any direction. Everyone was giving Sherlock as wide of a berth as possible without actually having to go around the block to put the building between them.
Thinking for only a moment Sherlock responded “Yes.”
Opening his eyes, Mycroft reached into his pocket and picked up the phone to call Anthea. There were arrangements to make, and plans to change.
The man simply raised an eyebrow in response.
“Twice. That’s exactly how many times they can say no, and then its whoever the project wants to tie them to, like it or not. You know as well as I do how that really works out, all of that talk about the ‘perfect match’ be damned.”
“I hate that place.” John nearly spat. “The things that they do there- it’s not right. They lure in young omegas with the promise of a ‘perfect match’ and then they pair them up with the highest bidder or give them to some random whoever when they put up a fuss.” Sherlock nodded, it wasn’t news to him. “Even if the kid doesn’t want to go, unless they can find someone to bond with before their 21st birthday then they have no choice.”
“What about Harry?”
*****
“Why don’t you tell me Sherlock?” The blindfold loosened and slipped from Sherlock’s eyes with a whisper. Sherlock looked up at the dark haired man, taking in the coldness of the green eyes staring down at him. The hand at his neck was disturbingly tender with compared to an almost surprising amount of blind fury dancing in those eyes.  “Why do you think you are here?”
“Yes,” Mycroft acknowledged with a slight bow of his head. “I have come to realize that.” He turned to John with a slightly bemused look on his face; the type of look that one might give a particularly unusual or grotesque insect. “Doctor Watson, I do sincerely apologise for any misunderstanding.”
His shoulder hit first, barely breaking the fall enough to prevent him from breaking his neck as his head slammed down next. The sickening crunch and instant radiating pain from his shoulder as he hit made his eyes pop open with a gasp. He bit firmly at his lip to hold back a whimper of pain; the shoulder was surely dislocated. Lights swum drunkenly in front of his eyes as he stared up at the brightly lit ceiling above him. He was at the bottom of some sort of loading dock, the car sitting at the edge of the platform above him. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut tightly as he fought off the urge to pass out again. It would lead to nothing good, he was sure.
Rationally John knew that Sherlock was likely completely fine, he was a grown man.
“We are not finished with our conversation.”  The man responded with a faint frown.
Since the call had come in, constant stream of data flowed into the speeding vehicle as they raced through the London streets. John’s refusal to be dismissed from the search rated a curious flick of the eyes from Mycroft, who had then dropped it immediately in favour of working out the logistics of the rescue. CCTV had picked up the abduction, but hadn’t managed to get anyone to Sherlock before he was stuffed unceremoniously into the back of an old blue Corsa. They had tracked the vehicle to an emptied warehouse near the docks where there were agents waiting on standby.
Not exactly inspired, but not unexpected either. “Why do you think?” this could be enlightening.
“Please get into the car. My patience is wearing dangerously thin. I promise on my honour that if you come willingly no harm will come to you.”  The voice was clipped and impatient, John noted as he looked out the window one last time.
“The Omega Protection Statute may be a relic of a bygone era but it is still very much in effect. Every unbound omega must be registered for bonding by the time they reach 21 years. You are 32 years old Sherlock. I gave you as long as I could to find a suitable Alpha to bind to; you have had ample time to pick a mate of your own- a full decade more than most. Despite what you seem to think I'm not happy about the situation either, but I am being far from unreasonable here.”
It was true, Mike admitted to himself. Theoretically every match was supposed to be biologically cross referenced with all available alphas to ensure maximum compatibility. In reality however, many young omegas involved in the program found themselves permanently bonded to someone they would rather not sit with on the bus.
"I highly doubt that," Greg muttered. He couldn't even imagine the reaction if John woke up to find Sherlock gone. He felt a sudden surge of sympathy for the other alpha; he had seemed sensible enough the other day. The man obviously had no idea what he had gotten himself into. "You need to go back right now. Seriously, you need to find John and stay with him until your bond settles in. Half the block can smell you right now. It's too soon."
“So the freak has a pet then?” Sally taunted. “What did he do? Follow you home?”
John slowly removed his coat and shoes, leaving them at the door beside Sherlock’s. “Is there anything to eat; do you think?” John was famished; other than a few bites of invalid food at the hospital, he couldn’t remember the last time he had eaten a solid meal.
The man sat back again, and looked at John with interest in his eyes. “Well, if you were to ask him he would probably say his arch-enemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
Many many thanks go out to DamaSedalar for BETA-ing this chapter for me.
“Even you are aware that I am an omega.” Sherlock muttered. “I haven’t got a choice unless Mycroft gets off of the cake long enough to do his job which, let’s be honest, isn’t going to happen.”
The inside of the house was beautifully understated. Warm woods and colours created warmness even as the expense of the contents let you know that someone very successful lived there. It was all very impressive until they stepped into the study and the smell of death hit their noses.
“Well that
"It's fine Lestrade!" Sherlock snapped, moving to brush past the alpha. "If you feel like it's such an issue, I'll leave you to find the killer yourself. I'm sure your very competent team will take care of it in no time at all."
(See the end of the chapter for
John winced. "That was not my best moment," he acknowledged, "But Sherlock, I had no idea what was going on. You just left me. Do you have any idea what I thought?"
"If you didn't need me then you shouldn't have asked for my help." Sherlock hissed as he tucked himself further into that ridiculous coat.
“No!” John surprised them both by yelling. Taking a quick breath to regain his composure slightly he continued “It’s not that at all. Any idiot could see you would be brilliant at it, but the police don’t go to private detectives.”
“And why is that?” the officer asked, maintaining her stance and blocking Sherlock’s path into the crime scene.  John decided he really did not like the woman, and subconsciously moved closer to defend Sherlock if necessary.
As Sherlock walked through the door of 221B, he knew he was not alone. He looked up to meet the eyes of the man currently sitting in
some distant part of his mind whispered, sounding suspiciously like his brother’s taunting voice. Sherlock dismissed the possibility instantly. John Watson was an honourable man; of that he had no doubt. If John said that he would stop, he would stop. That was one of the most alluring thoughts that Sherlock had ever had, he realized suddenly. He could do this. No, he corrected himself; he
*****
he chided himself.
"You were not fine Sherlock!" John growled. "Even Lestrade was trying to convince you that you needed to go home!"
“Ah, Yes. The bravery of a soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?” John gave him a quelling look but refused to rise to the bait. John relished the small frown that appeared momentarily on the other man’s face before he continued. “I have a business opportunity for you.”
“That sounds like a description from one of your torrid little novels. It’s obvious you have no first-hand experience here” Sherlock snapped. “But even then, some might call that smothering and possessive; a constant presence always at your back, breathing down your neck.”
“That will do nicely.” Sherlock nodded with sudden apparent delight. “I should have just enough time to pop out for the riding crop.”
Robert stiffened behind him. Sherlock could feel him debating whether it would be better to stay hidden and maintain the slim advantage of what surprise he had left, or to come out now and square off in an attempt to bargain his way out of the room. Sherlock froze utterly still, holding even his breath until finally Robert grabbed Sherlock’s injured arm and dragged him up and into the light.
"It was a case, John. That's what I do." Sherlock bit back, eyes flashing dangerously "I'm not going to stop taking cases."
The other alpha’s laugh was grating. “That would be quite stupid of me, wouldn’t it?” He taunted John, digging the knife a little deeper into Sherlock’s skin and drawing a few fresh drops of blood. “This little bitch cost me my mate, and my pup. He’s lucky to still be breathing at all.”
Wetting his lips slightly with the tip of his tongue, Sherlock considered what he could possibly say. “I’m rather nervous.” He eventually responded. There, that was obvious enough to start with.
“That’s not fair” protested Molly weakly. “What has you in a snit about alphas all of a sudden anyway? Is it for a case?” Molly couldn't think of any cases that might need the details of her hidden fantasies but who really knew with Sherlock.
The grin that John shot back at the bed was almost wolfish. “First, I’m going to find a doctor, and then we are going to get you discharged.” John paused, and tilted his head curiously at Sherlock. “That is, if that sounds good to you?”
“Oh. Of course.” She looked away.” I just thought I would offer. It can be good to talk about things that are bothering you. “
Sherlock seemed completely unconcerned, which only served to make John angrier and more determined to get his point across. "You could have woken me up. You could have watched the telly. You could have done literally anything other than wander around London alone, the day after our bonding."
“I did,” was the quick response. “Mike is aware of a rather difficult issue I am currently experiencing and now here he is just after lunch with an old friend, an unbonded alpha in need of a pack in fact,  one clearly just home from medical service in Afghanistan.  It wasn’t an unreasonable conclusion.”
“Order whatever you like.” Sherlock said as he broke a breadstick in half, dipping it in the olive oil on the table.
That was rather interesting, John thought as he moved around to the other side of the desk. It wasn’t often that you saw an omega take on an alpha in a fight for dominance and win. Every time he thought he was getting a bead on Sherlock, the man surprised him.
John straightened his clothes and turned to the door. “Where are you going?” Sherlock asked incredulously. Surely he wasn’t just going to leave after that?
All John could really think about as the blood rushed loudly in his ears and his fingers dug rigidly into his own knees, was how
He narrowed his eyes at the intruder. “Get out."
“Then how did she find the body?”
“It’s barbaric, and I won’t be a part of it.” John snarled, startling a passing waitress as he slammed his hand against the table top.
*****
"Sherlock! What in God's name are you doing here?" Greg's voice was muffled slightly by the heavy cloth covering his nose and mouth. The heady scent of recently bonded omega hung cloyingly in the air; it was absolutely impossible to ignore as Sherlock swanned around the crime scene. Greg had already dismissed the other alphas on the team; their reactions had varied from absolute disgust from Sally to begrudging attraction from Jones.
After a moment some of the tautness drained out of the shorter alpha. "Sorry. I'm a little on edge, I shouldn't have done that." John’s eyes darted to Sherlock as if to assure himself that the taller man was okay.
interesting.  Outwardly he only responded by reaching into the breast pocket of his coat and producing one of the cards he kept there.
“Colleague?” he asked, incredulous. John thought it was rather interesting that that was the only noteworthy part of the sentence. What exactly was Sherlock’s role here?
Mike hesitated before he offered his next suggestion. “You could always sign onto the Omega Project.”
John couldn’t help the low growl that emanated from his throat. Why was he letting this man affect him so much? “People don’t just have enemies.”
Questions? Comments? Concerns?
John studied the simple white business card. “Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective,” he read aloud. “What does it mean? I haven’t heard of a consultant detective before.”
Mike Stamford shook his head bemusedly as John chased Sherlock without a second thought to the man left behind. He had had a few bad ideas in his time, but he rather suspected that introducing the two of them was one of the better ones. Humming lightly to himself Mike made his way out of the room, off to let Molly know about the cadaver left forgotten on the table.
This chapter bumped my rating up a little bit.
Surprised, John glanced at his watch, half past noon. “It’s a bit early for that, but” he looked at Mike’s hopeful face. “Ok, yeah let’s do it.”
“Now wait just a second.” John sputtered rounding the table as he gave in to his instinct to put some distance between himself and the omega. “Who said anything about bondmates?”
“One does not enter a knife fight without expecting to be cut John. I’m fine, it’s a surface wound.” Sherlock dismissed, staring at the alpha with narrowed eyes. “Now what did he do?”
“I would be surprised if you had.” Sherlock responded easily. “I created the position myself; I am the only one in the world.”
As he went to move, however, John growled softly. Sherlock froze. John reached out blindly, one hand snagging Sherlock's wrist in an attempt to draw the other man closer to him. "Mine," John mumbled under his breath, still deep asleep.
So smut isn't something that consider to be a particular strong point of mine. In fact, this chapter is almost 2k words longer than my previous chapters due to the fact that I was avoiding writing the bonding scene as hard as I possibly could without doing it on purpose haha. Hopefully I did it justice, please let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions for the future!
“The housekeeper,” Sherlock murmured to himself with dawning realization. He hadn’t actually met the woman, he remembered suddenly; he had put the case together from the crime scene and the information provided by Lestrade. He had had no idea that she was an omega, and certainly not that she was bonded and expecting.
He heard a voice yell his name. “John! John Watson!”  Turning around he saw a red faced and rather portly man attempting to flag him down.
*****
For a heartbeat nothing happened and Sherlock started to pull away in embarrassment, wondering how he could have read the man so wrongly. Suddenly there were hands running through his hair and pulling him closer as John returned the kiss with a low growl. John was careful of the still healing bruises and cuts even as he moved forward and firmly took charge of the kiss, pulling Sherlock deeper into the sensation of their mouths moving together.
“You misunderstand.” The woman paused before continuing, obviously trying to put together the best way to explain the situation. “The hostile has been removed. Sherlock appears unconscious but we are unable to get close enough to see the extent of his injuries. Every time we try, John lashes out. We can’t get through the alpha haze to reason with him.”
“Victim is an omega female, probably early 50’s, obviously well off.”  Pushing aside his discomfort with practiced ease, John leaned close to the body to better see the grisly wounds. “These fingers were removed, but it wasn’t a medical job by far. I would say bolt cutter or something similar. The ends were also cauterized, likely so she wouldn’t bleed out. Taken with the bruising on her face this reads like torture, but why?”
Mycroft’s answering smile was sharp. “What a tragedy that would have been.”
Sherlock shot him an odd look that John couldn’t quite read before turning to continue walking. They were nearly to the house before Sherlock glanced back at him. “Thank you.” And with that, he strode inside leaving John to trail behind.
“Mmm.” Sherlock hummed as he kicked off his shoes and wandered further into the room. “Mummy decorated it. She stays here when she’s in the city.”
Agent Booth gestured for John to stay put as he and Henderson split up to take the four guards down.  The guards obviously didn’t expect any trouble; they were almost relaxed as they leaned against the rust covered railing with their backs to the lot behind them. Their joking laughter made John’s blood boil. How dare they sit here and joke around when they had delivered Sherlock to this place, with God knew what happening inside?
Sherlock glared at the older man’s slightly mocking tone, but John either didn’t notice or ignored it entirely as he responded. “No harm done.” His words were mild and his smile bright, but something in the way he was holding himself indicated that he was not quite as sincere as he appeared. “If you hadn’t picked me up, after all, then I might have missed out on the rescue,” he paused a moment before continuing, “But also getting shot of course- for the second time I may add.”
“It’s up to you.” John looked closely at Sherlock. The other man turned his face away, opting to stare out of the window instead. When Sherlock didn’t respond John nudged his leg gently with a booted foot. “What are you thinking right now?”
There was something about the alpha that seemed familiar, even as John was sure that he had never seen him in his life. The man was immaculately dressed in an expensive bespoke suit, and obviously a few years older than John. His slightly ginger hair was thinning on top and he had a rather unfortunate nose under his critical eyes.  For a few minutes they said nothing, each trying to stare the other down, each refusing to be the first look away.  Eventually though the stranger seemed satisfied by whatever he saw.
“Apparently not.” Sherlock snorted as Mike Stamford walked into the room.
“You can’t read it in the creases of my shirt then? There’s been a murder in Knightsbridge.”   Lestrade scoffed, why else would he be running slapdash across London?
Tilting his head slightly John studied Sherlock for a few moments before apparently coming to some sort of decision. “How about you let me worry about that, yeah? You just tell me if what I’m doing feels good or if you want me to stop. Would that work?”
“I never wanted an alpha John.” Sherlock said, looking evenly at him. “I would not lie to you; If circumstances weren’t what they are, I wouldn’t be asking you to do this for me. But if you say no, in two days I will be bonded to someone that I have likely never met. You don't have to agree to be my mate; you have no obligation to me at all. But now you do know me, you know what I do. If you decide that you want to get in touch, you have my card and know how to reach me.”
John blinked slowly. “Does she come often?” what he really meant was ‘is your mother going to walk in on us?’
“There are several things I suppose. Mycroft, Robert, the case.” He listed mechanically. He stopped for several moments before hesitantly continuing. “And I might say that I’m slightly uneasy about what’s going to happen. I never expected to be doing this.”
Sherlock felt an odd warmth in his chest as he smiled a rare, genuine smile at the alpha.
Sherlock jerked awake with a gasp. Throwing the blankets away from himself, Sherlock sat up in an attempt to stop the nausea that was rolling through his stomach. He could feel his heart beating far too quickly, his neck throbbed in tune to his frantic pulse. Eyes darting around wildly, he tried to take in his surroundings as the words from his nightmares still echoed in his ears.
There was another bed in the room, blankets askew, but the slightly darker patch of wall between the beds and the lack of second side table indicated that it had been added to what would typically be a private room. They must have added the bed for John, likely worried that he would go into another haze if he woke up separated from Sherlock after everything that had happened.
“I know you’re still here.” Even his voice was slightly different, cold steel under a deep growl that somehow carried all the way to their hidden corner despite the fact that he had barely raised his voice over the sound of the gunshots still distant in the background. “There’s nowhere for you to go.”
Sherlock threw himself to the side, leaving a perfect opening for John. John took the suddenly clear shot as Sherlock’s body hit the ground, head banging hard onto the concrete. The sound of the gun going off was almost painful as it echoed around the large room. John darted forward with a yell, barely sparing a thought for the alpha on the ground with the hole in his head. He grabbed the unconscious Sherlock, pulling him quickly away from the body.
John managed a polite nod at Greg before turning to the car. Sherlock held firm, watching the shorter man for several moments with an odd look on his face, but ultimately he allowed John to pull him away from the crime scene without as much as a backwards glance.
He paused and looked at John quickly, as if to gauge his reaction before continuing. “So, soldier shipped back home early from the war, separated from his comrades in arms and not welcomed back into the family fold. You are displaying several signs of intense emotional distress, insomnia and that psychosomatic injury to your leg being the two most obvious. It’s common knowledge that any alpha without a pack for an extended amount of time suffers mentally and physically.  Beyond that, you are a doctor and intelligent enough to know the symptoms of the problem and the solution to it.”
Mike looked at him sympathetically. “Having a bit of a rough time then?”
There was no knowing how long it took for John to finally get himself under control. By the time he managed to breathe steadily, the shaking of his hands had started to recede slightly. Slowly he pulled himself up from the floor, resting his weight onto his heels.  As he did, he became aware of the fact that for the most part, he was still distinctly undressed.
“Let him go.”
For a moment Sherlock felt the pain in his throat, saw the brightness of the light in front of his eyes, and knew that he was dead.  Then there was a face hovering over him. An angel, his addled mind supplied in the split second before he registered the scent of cedar and bergamot. Suddenly, everything snapped into focus around him.
“It’s the law Sherlock.” Mycroft resisted the urge to yell. He knew this conversation was never going to go well but that would only make it impossible. “You knew this was coming. It’s not exactly a surprise.”
Looking at him evenly, the man eventually replied, “Military history is the easy bit, from the hair on your head to the way you hold yourself you scream soldier. However, you are also obviously familiar with the hospital; you have been in this room in particular several times before based on your reactions. That says student; so doctor then- far too obvious. You are still sporting a tan but not above the wrists so you were in uniform, not on vacation. That also indicates the shortness of time since you have been home, much longer and the lines would have faded away entirely. You move stiffly favouring your shoulder, that must be where you got shot, sending you home early. All of that adds up to two possibilities, one of which you confirmed when you answered Afghanistan.”
“Hello Doctor.” The man smiled with an insincere grimace. “Please, have a seat.” He gestured to the bench across from him.
No, the thing that had Sherlock’s attention was the conundrum of the man sitting next to him. The idea of throwing himself on the tender mercies of the Committee was simply unthinkable. John did seem like an excellent solution to the dilemma, though Sherlock didn’t like the idea that he would come with his own set of issues. He simply didn’t have enough data about the man to understand his intentions beyond the obvious.
"Yes. Sorry." Greg jerked his hand back as if he had been burned, and retreated a few feet under the suspicious gaze of the other alpha. Greg didn't know where John had come from, but he had known better than to try to touch Sherlock in his current state. "I won't touch him."
Sherlock gasped as he was abruptly cut free of the ropes binding him to the chair. It crashed away behind him as he was dragged away from the door and into a dark corner, hidden behind a pile of haphazardly stacked crates. They had barely made it before the door burst open and the brightly lit outline of John Watson slipped inside.
“Just as perceptive as they make you out to be.” Robert said in satisfaction. He finally stepped back from the chair, removing his hand from Sherlock’s neck as he went. Sherlock drew air deep into his lungs, feeling almost as if he had been underwater in the too close presence of the alpha.  “My pregnant mate Samantha,” Robert continued after a pause, “who you had arrested today.”
“There are clinics all over London.” Mike pointed out. “You are a damn good doctor. You will find a place.”
Sherlock chewed slightly at his lip. “I can try to notify you first next time, but I don't plan on it happening again for a long while; no sooner than another week or two at least." Sherlock offered, hoping that the alpha would accept the peace offering as it was meant.
“Exactly.” John looked away. “I’m not upset about it though. Clara has been doing great things for Harry, she always had a bit of a problem with the bottle but she’s been doing well. She’s a lot younger than me too; she just turned 21 this year. I was 17 when Harry was born and people always assumed she was my daughter; it was hard for her. I’m happy for them.”
In the end, the doctors released Sherlock with a bare minimum of fuss. Within a quarter of an hour they were being escorted out of the building by a smiling orderly. John wondered what exactly Mycroft had told them; he certainly wouldn’t have wanted to release someone who had only just woken up from a concussion.
The room apparently disarranged to his liking, Sherlock dusted off his hands. “Yes, the kitchen should be stocked. Mycroft is annoyingly thorough about these things.” He turned and walked through an archway into what appeared to be a formal dining room. John hurried behind him, just in time to see him walking through the swinging door and into a large kitchen.
Really, John thought, he should have figured that Sherlock came from money. Between the bespoke suit and jacket, and the brother who apparently ran the country, Sherlock’s affluence should have been obvious. Somehow though, it hadn’t quite hit him until he saw the complete disdain Sherlock had for the luxuries surrounding him. It was like he didn’t even see them.  After a few uncomfortable moments John forced himself to move away from the part of him that wondered just how well off Sherlock could be. He hadn’t known, and it didn’t change anything between them really.
“Don’t be dull Lestrade.” Sherlock dismissed him effortlessly before turning to John.
John looked pointedly around the car. “Well, thank God you’re above all of that then.”
She's a jewel, and this probably would have taken quite a bit longer to get out without her encouragement and advice.
“Right away sir.”  And the woman was gone.
It wouldn’t do to bring John into Mummy’s room Sherlock decided as he considered his options. It wasn’t so much that he objected to the idea of her room for her sake, most likely Mycroft was planning on replacing whichever bed they chose anyway, but the garish flowers and such only got worse in the privacy of her inner sanctum. In the end Sherlock brought John into the largest guest room, the colours a much more neutral combination of midnight blue and gold. It wouldn’t make Sherlock retch anyway.
“Right. Good.” John’s fingers rubbed absently at the cuff of his too long sleeve as he tried to figure out how exactly to ask the question on his mind. “Do you really want to do this?”
John couldn’t just sit here and do this, knowing that Sherlock was watching. He stood up and began to pace as he spoke, using the careful steps to keep time- to keep his nerve. “I haven’t done anything but pine for a pack since I came back from the war. Then here I was, just going about my life, trying to avoid biting a bullet for at least one more day when a perfect opportunity fell into my lap.”
Silence stretched for a few moments before John slowly answered. “I would say a private detective but…” the sentence trailed off.
they. He didn’t spare a thought for the idea that he was reacting so strongly over an omega he had only met this afternoon. He ignored the narrow eyes and the heavy looks of the alpha across from him, who certainly wasn’t acting very much like an enemy at the moment. He even pushed away the voice in his mind raging for the gun that they didn’t have time to fetch. John was rigid with anger, barely containing it within himself at the thought that someone had been stupid enough to lay hands on Sherlock.
However, just as he stepped through the door he shot a last knowing look at Sherlock. “Oh, I nearly forgot.  As to your earlier statement, your little adventure wasn’t last night brother mine. It was the night before.” And with a swish of his coat, Mycroft was gone.
Through the sudden spike of anxiety, Mycroft was careful to keep his voice cool and even. “Elaborate.” He could feel his heart beating a little faster as every possible scenario ran through his mind.
Sherlock stiffened, feeling the bite of bricks digging into his back as he was tossed against a rough wall.
In the meantime--So long everyone, and thanks for all the fish.
Sherlock felt a shudder rip through his back as the unknown alpha rubbed his fingers on the unmarked scent glands hidden there. He forced himself to calm down before responding flatly. “Robert, I presume.”
“I could make some kind of threat, Doctor Watson, but is that strictly necessary? I simply wish to speak to you about… a mutual acquaintance.”
he told himself as he left the bedroom. Deep down, he knew that the house was far too quiet for that.
“Do you want to see some more?”
“That is hardly the way to speak to family is it? What would Mummy say?”
“That would be rather nice, yes.” John answered. “I was hoping to get home at some point before sunrise.”  When did his life become a bad spy movie?
Special thanks goes out to Chemical_Defect who pretty much dragged me through the last few months by the hair and got me to the point where I could finally finish this. You're an amazing friend and I'm lucky to have you.
Sorry for the cliffhanger lovelies!  I hope you liked it! John's alpha is definitely rearing its head a little.
“Afghanistan.” John responded.
Fingers drummed on the handle of an old fashioned umbrella. “An interested party,” he answered eventually.
At first he tried to ignore the car, but something about it sent alarm bells blaring in his head. He had come to trust his instincts in Afghanistan; they had saved him more than a few times when something just didn’t seem quite right. John spotted a tiny bookshop just ahead and ducked quickly through the door; he felt almost silly hiding from a car on the street as he moved into the shop and turned to look at the window. He didn’t see the car for a few moments, and was just starting to really kick himself for letting his imagination run away from him when it pulled up to the kerb outside and stopped moving.
“Does anyone else live in the house?”
John's alpha immediately raced to the forefront of his half-awake mind. He needed to find Sherlock and he needed to find him now. His mate should be there, next to him and he wasn't.
Not so quiet uptown after all.
John is being selected for a suicide mission to save the bloody planet.
I open my mouth to speak, but what comes out is

… Gone, but not gone.
He makes his way out to the kitchen, and finds five envelopes neatly fanned out across the table, one of which has his name on it. He picks it up, about to slide his finger under the seal to open it, when the flat seems to shake.
That doesn’t mean he doesn’t try. He hosts conference call after conference call, searching for a solution. He meets with the greatest minds from the greatest universities, uses his considerable reach to find philosophers and astronomers — even

It is because of this sub-standard fictional essay that Mycroft begins exploring options on direct interference with the asteroid rather than avoidance, and connects with a nuclear physicist from Tokyo who believes that a collision between a large enough mass and the incoming asteroid just might minimise the impact and subsequent destruction of planet Earth. Mycroft signs off of the video call, and sits in his office for a long while.
Sherlock sifts through Mycroft’s drawers, and finds scraps of encoded notes that shows John is at the top of his shortlist of people with military background, strong moral character, and the aptitude to grasp a flight system in a very short amount of time. Mycroft needs someone he believes could both successfully complete the mission, and keep it secret from the general public to prevent mass panic. Sherlock sees his point, but
The Americans interject every few days with new findings from NASA, who assure everyone they are closely monitoring the situation, but Sherlock scoffs, because how closely can they possibly monitor a situation that is happening between Venus and Earth? Until then, he’d only known Venus to be the patron saint of prostitutes.
The day that the moving van ambles down the road, kicking up great clouds of dust, and pulls into the drive of Wilmington Place, more than half the population finds the least conceivable reasons imaginable to walk, drive, ride, or wander past the front gate in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the new, infamous neighbours, but the only souls around are a few young men silently unloading furniture and boxes, and before long, they leave the property as well, and it is as though no one had been there at all.

‘You said he would be safe,’ Sherlock says finally. His voice shakes, as if it is not sure to give way to panic or fury, ‘You swore to me that John would be safe here. Protection, 24/7, you said. Maximum security status, Mycroft.
It’s the night before liftoff, and Sherlock is enjoying his last evening on Earth. He doesn’t tell anyone the plan for tomorrow; truly, even if he had wanted to share it, no one would ever believe him. He chats with Mrs Hudson, makes plans with Molly to examine a diseased kidney the following week, solves a fantastical case for Lestrade involving a deli worker who moonlights as a strangler, and settles into 221B with takeaway fish and chips and crap telly.
He tries conversation again, ‘It’s okay love,’ he says thickly, doing his best to sound as though he is not being strangled by his emotions, ‘How about a wash, then?’
it was just that I hadn’t yet found
John thinks for a moment, then he offers a small smile, the first one he’s had in months.
As the pastor drones on about sacrifice, and servitude, and possibly some sort of metaphor for Jesus, John thinks back to the story Sherlock told him about Irene Adler asking if it was the end of the world, the very last night, if he would have dinner with her. He supposes he should feel grateful that at the end of the world, Sherlock chose to spend his very last night with John, but this does nothing to satiate the howling void in his chest.
Sherlock just stares at him as he bursts through the door.
Six months, nearly to the day after Hamish is killed, Mycroft shows up for one of these perfunctory visits, but even as his car turns into the drive, Sherlock can tell that something is different this time. The driver’s anxiety is nearly palpable when he goes ‘round the town car to let Mycroft out the back. Mycroft’s stride, though still measured and unhurried, had just the faintest trace of a wobble on the left step when his foot left the pavement.

It’s the end of the world, he says. The end of the bloody world, and there’s not a damn thing we can do about it.
‘So that’s it, then?’ John says angrily, ‘You’ve made funeral arrangements, and updated your will, and now you’re off to commit hari-kari on the end of Sebastian Moran’s rifle?’

He punched me in the face, but he was never good at understanding subtext.

Another day passes before Sherlock breaks into Mycroft’s office, in search of mischief as usual, thinking that if the world is ending, he might as well read
‘Oh, God,’ John whispers, covering his face with his hands, ‘I miss him, Sherlock. Every second of every day.’
rather than his actions that has made all the difference in the world, but somehow that just sounds callous in his mind, so he says nothing at all.
The thing about living in a small town is that even non-events somehow seem like big events, because even the slightest break in the monotony is a distraction, so needless to say, when the famous detective from London moves into the old Wilmington Place at the edge of town with his husband (! Of all things!), it causes nothing short of an uproar. Even the sleepiest country bumpkin has at least heard of Sherlock Holmes, even if they don’t realise that the reason they knew his name was because of his blogger and ‘homosexual life partner’, Dr Watson. They know he’s had some recent trouble with the law, and that he’d been called into a big fancy trial as a star witness when that madman had called him out personally. And, more recently, they know that he’s suffered an unimaginable loss when his adoptive son had been brutally murdered trying to clear his name.
They are a clash of teeth and hands and mouths, and they tumble onto the sofa, the door still wide open, and the faint sounds of the street below bleeding into the otherwise silent flat.
‘I’m assuming you bothered to trek all the way out here for more than just to comment on the state of my hair and countertops, brother mine?’ he spits, though with considerably less venom than used to be the norm back in London.
Mycroft doesn’t answer, because he can’t deny the simple logic of his brother’s words, and also he can’t find a way to articulate that it’s Sherlock’s
!’ from John to bring him back to the present.
‘What else?’ Sherlock finally asks quietly, ‘You wouldn’t bother coming all the way out here with that stupid look on your face if it had just been an invitation to play, and a glorified case of B&E.’
Subtext — I know I deserve this.
Together means
Or perhaps some
‘What choice do I have, John!’ Sherlock explodes, wrenching himself from John’s grip, the months of tension, and grief, and loneliness, and fear all coming out at once, ‘He has all but said that if I do not engage with him, he will cone after
‘There has been a new development in regards to James Moriarty,’ he states with forced calm, ‘Mr Moriarty has…
, Mycroft,’ Sherlock snaps, ‘The message is that if I do not re-engage with him, he will get to John, because he has
all compacted into that single syllable.
So, I jumped.
John stares at the floor, where the water is pooling on the tiles at his feet. The towel slips from his shoulders, but he makes no move to grab it.
I laughed at the time. He laughed. We laughed.
, well what I want to know is
Smith places his hand over my mouth and nose, and the world goes dark around the edges.
,’ is all he can manage, but his brother interrupts.
Sherlock nods.
It is, in fact, a short story from a Grade 7 student called Giles McGinty that holds the solution. Giles had written an essay titled ‘HOW I SAVED THE WORLD AND TOUCHED THE SKY’ after the Star Trek episode ‘FOR THE WORLD IS HOLLOW AND I TOUCHED THE SKY’, but instead of discovering the asteroid to be a spaceship in disguise, Spaceman Giles just plowed his rocket into the asteroid, leapt from his spaceship, and happened to be picked up by another passing spaceship. Giles had been given a grade of Below Expected, and a note in red pen to read a book and turn off the telly.
‘I remember,’ Sherlock replies, eyes prickling, ‘She was shrieking that she’d just used the dish towels to mop up chemicals from the table, so I grabbed my dressing gown, and wrapped him up in it. And you laughed, and said maybe I’d make a good dad after all.’
‘Remember the first time we gave Hamish a bath?’ John asks suddenly, sitting on the edge of the tub, ‘You were afraid he was too small for the bathtub, so we stopped up the kitchen sink, and washed him in there, and used a dish towel to dry him? Mrs Hudson was appalled.’
‘That doesn’t mean I…’ John starts, but can’t seem to continue, and his face seems to collapse in on itself, and he covers it with his hands. Sherlock watches curiously as John massages his temples, and scrubs his hands over his face before seeming to steel himself.
Mycroft meets him at the airfield. They have grounded all flights, and taken every conceivable precaution to keep the public from the premises. The brothers say nothing, because there are no words that could ease this moment, but right before Sherlock boards, he clasps Mycroft’s hand, and they stare into each other’s eyes for a long moment. Sherlock only looks away when he sees his brother’s chin begin to tremble.
John was…
Subtext — I don’t want to die
He reads the words, standing over Sherlock’s empty grave, his daughter in his arms, and he weeps.
. The Sherlock you know is a reckless piece of shit who is better off dead, rather than risking the lives of the few people he cares about in this pointless waste of a world. I’ve imagined death so often it feels more like a memory, John, but to have to fathom yours… That is not an exercise I am willing to partake in.’
‘I… I am being called back to London,’ he admits quietly, ‘The photographs… They were to ensure I go willingly. They… I… He will not get to you, John, I swear it. His quarrel… It is with me, and me alone. If I… Engage with him, one last time, I believe he will be satisfied.’
“Yes.” Satisfied by the response, his flatmate patted his shoulder and held up a glass of water. “Can you drink this?”
The breath left John’s lungs in a rush as Holmes turned his head and pressed his lips to John’s temple again. “You have no need to apologize. No need at all. ‘A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown, / A road through heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness.’” He swallowed. “John, I cannot begin to understand, but you do me honor with your trust.”
John tried to shrug. “It doesn’t matter. It’s way in the past.”
Oh, John had had enough of that. “Come in here and get it yourself.”
“That’s not the same man.”
John chuckled to himself, slid his hands over Holmes’ stubbly jaw, up into his mess of curls, and leaned in closer, rubbing closed lips over closed lips until Holmes sighed and moved closer, his hands tentatively going to John’s waist. John took that opportunity to flick his tongue over Holmes’ bottom lip, twice, then tilt his head and scrape gently with his teeth.
“I’m sure your mother used to do the same.”
Holding the gun rock-steady in his right hand, he allowed his left to creep slowly across his hip, seeking his med-pack. Gone. Damn! He must have lost it in… in –
“Not being anyone’s problem. Not…being.”
“Could be your half of the bed….”
“Really. Just you.”
Dressing carefully, aware of aches and pains across his shoulders and back (you’re not a young recruit any more, Watson), he opened the door and made his way downstairs.
Dark inside, the faintest hints of light flickering in; he was indoors, and perhaps it was day outside. But the background noise from outside was constant, pervasive – a sandstorm? Was he separated from his platoon? Were they under attack and, more importantly, were there any injured?
“Lucky guess.”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open and his mouth worked for a moment before sound came out. “John, you – you’re hard.”
“Huh?” He half-turned, glanced over at the wrecked detective leaning against the kitchen table, trying to catch his breath. “I – yeah, I still am. Does that bother you?”
“What?”
“Shhh.”
“May I hold you again?”
“You didn’t. And in the future we will remove the possibility.”
“Well, you’re a mess too, so that’s hardly a compliment.” But the words still resonated in John’s head, filled his stomach with a different kind of warmth. Similar to the one he’d felt in Holmes’ embrace last night.
“And?”
“Suicide.”
“And what makes you think you know anything about this?”
Strong hands gripped his shoulders; John hissed in pain and the fingers slid down to his biceps, fingers flexing anxiously against the muscle. John looked up into Holmes’ pale face. “What are you talking about?? Explain yourself at once!”
“All soldiers do.”
“Shouldn’t be.”
“I…don’t usually go back to sleep, after…”
“Juvenile, now that’s Sherlock!” But now the wheels were turning in John’s head. Now that she’d planted the damned thought, he couldn’t let go of it. “You’re being ridiculous.”
Sherlock was laid out on the couch with his violin when John stomped into the flat. He didn’t look up as John kicked off his shoes, so different from his usual fastidiousness, and tossed his coat over the back of a kitchen chair rather than hang it up. He didn’t look up as John put the kettle on, so John ignored him, as well.
“What else would deserve such a place of honor? Specially cleared, as though the medal is en route. And look – it’s arrived.” John reached into the mess on the desk, which had spilled onto the carpet, dragged down by a dying man’s hand. He gently lifted a letter and read aloud in a low, steady voice: “Dear Mr. Fishbyrne, it is our great honor to inform you that Louis Fishbyrne, Jr. has been posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in recognition for his extraordinary acts of bravery and service to this country,” he looked up. “Et cetera, et cetera.”
“You’re evading.”
A quirked lip. “I suppose…”
John looked up at Holmes’ cocked eyebrow and sighed. “Yeah, well played, great.” He shook his head. “This is – different. What you have is – amazing. Brilliant. What I have is deadly.”
Surprised into a chuckle, John still didn’t miss Sherlock’s quick appraisal of his body, the obvious distending of his jeans. “Tell you what,” John managed, before all the blood left his brain entirely. “I’m going to go upstairs…slip into something less…restrictive.” Sherlock snapped his gaze back to the doctor’s face. “Come with me.”
Watson drew a deep breath, let it out. “Yes. I am. Thank you.”
“Get home to Sherlock?”
“Your symptoms are not unusual, John, nor are they unsettling. In fact, I would be far more concerned for your psyche if you did not experience them.”
“Is too!  Wait –seriously, Sherlock? I’m standing here waiting for you to actually kiss me, and you want to talk about my tea getting cold?”
Taking a deep breath, John lay back against the pillow that had been propped behind his head. “Holmes.”
Slowly: “Holmes…are you suggesting…”
“Watson.” Uncharacteristically at a loss, he smoothed a reassuring hand down John’s back, feeling the tremors slowly intensify. “Watson, we’re on Baker Street. We’re having a thunderstorm.”
“Sherlock,” John gasped against his shoulder, his breath hot and damp against the bare skin. “I’ve thought about touching you for so long.”
“It is to me. I – have to laugh at it, Holmes. Otherwise it stays with me.”
“Come off it, Holmes! Every soldier contemplates suicide! At least once! I thought you just said my symptoms are not unsettling?”
Watson pulled himself up and reached for the glass; his hand shook so much as he brought it to his lips that Holmes unobtrusively placed his fingers at the bottom, steadying it as John drank. He had nearly finished when there was another intense burst of light, and John dumped the rest of the contents on his lap. “Christ!”
“Because the nightmares take on a reality of their own, Inspector, and when that reality comes true then the only recourse for some is to join it.”
“John.”
Holmes went to the bed and retrieved the topmost quilt. Speaking lowly and clearly, he approached John slowly, as he would a cornered animal. “John, you’re going into shock. I’m going to put a blanket around you.” There was no response. Sinking to his knees, Holmes gently spread the quilt across the soldier’s shaking back, and when John did not look up, left his arm around the other man’s shoulders. “Please say something.”
“Is not.”
"What? Why not? It’s the middle of the night and your stupid, damaged flatmate is up to his crazed war antics and woke you up because –”
“It’s quite possible that I was wrong.”
“I –” the taller man swallowed, looking everywhere but at John. “I – where’s my mug?”
“None.”
“Three-Continent Watson.”
“I love you, too.”
In that moment John’s heartbeat was louder than the thunder. He held his breath for a single moment, waiting. Holmes had been acting differently, tonight, especially considering the circumstances. John half expected him to ask to have a cup of tea made. But by some instinct, he held still, waiting to see what the taller man would do. And, another part of him admitted, it felt good to be enfolded in Holmes’ arms. Warm, almost safe.
“God, no! You don’t believe that, honestly, do you?”
Turning, he expected to help Holmes up off the floor; instead, his flatmate was already standing, quilt in his arms. Wordlessly he stepped forward and wrapped the comforting material around the soldier, wrapped his arms around the soldier, paused. Did not withdraw.
“I know what you said –” Sherlock mock huffed and took one exaggerated step into the kitchen –
“Whatever for? I do most of my living in the other parts of the house. Other parts of London, too, for that matter.”
Harry half-turned at that. “…never?”
“John.” Sherlock spoke so low that Lestrade could not possibly have heard him. John shook his head, his hands clasped together, fingers steady in his gloves, and continued. “I think you’ll find there’s been another suicide recently, Lestrade, if not last night as well.”
As if on cue, a second explosion tore through the building, rattling the furniture around him, rattling the glass in the windowpanes.
“This physician cannot heal himself, Holmes.” John gave a small, sad smile. “My symptoms mark me. Set me apart and remind me of a weakness, a brokenness I cannot fix. I am neither your patient nor your responsibility. They…I…should not be anyone’s. I should not be.” He looked down at his socks. “I’d considered that.”
“No, never. He talks about himself, his cases, St. Bart’s, himself, the morgue, Molly, Greg, himself, he even grouses about the Yard! But not once has he ever mentioned me. ‘My Blogger’ sometimes if he’s feeling generous, I suppose, but never ‘John’. Not once.”
“There. Wasn’t so hard to ask for, was it, then?”
“Hey.” John reached out, clasped his shoulder. “We’re all new at this at some point.”
“You’re not damaged, John.”
The day that followed the storm dawned overcast but bright: the air was clear and clean. Watson woke better rested than he had felt in a long time; but he woke naturally, without his alarm clock, and that was enough to arouse his suspicion. Rolling to his bedside table he picked up a note scribbled out in Holmes’ scrawl:
John looked up and their eyes met again. Very quietly, he said, “all right.”
“Are you saying Sherlock’s trying to be subtle?” John pushed back from the table, leaned back in his chair, but couldn’t quite ignore the frission of apprehension and, God help him, excitement that raced down his spine as he said the words. “You don’t know him, sis.”
John shot him a look that said clearly, bullshit.
Slowly, so that Sherlock could stop him at any moment, John tugged on the curls until Sherlock’s head was tipped back, and then leaned forward to lick a slow, wet stripe up the detective’s throat, over his trembling pulse, over his Adam’s apple, to the underside of his chin.
“Bossy.” But John gave him more, couldn’t stop himself from cupping the hardness there in his large palm, stroking slowly, maddeningly slow, teasing until Holmes was writhing beside him. Until Holmes began to reciprocate. Until Holmes was gripping John’s hardness in his palm, nervous, excited, feeling the firm flesh twitch in his long fingers.
“And the one before her?”
“You’re not. And I’m already here, and I’m not leaving. You. I’m not leaving you. Here. Like this. Like. Hmmm.” Holmes blew out a breath, frustrated with himself. Raising his gaze to try again, his eyes locked with Watson’s, and he could not think of a single thing to say.
“It does matter.”
Slowly the line of Watson’s body relaxed, one muscle at a time, from his neck to his calves, and slowly he forced himself to stand. “Holmes.”
The more John thought, in the cab on the way back home, the more all of Sherlock’s little evasions seemed just that. Shy, rather than rude. Insecure, rather than mean. Deliberately indifferent, rather than obtuse or genuinely disinterested. But what reason would Sherlock have to hide any interest in John? Unless he was especially interested in John?
He returned to the kitchen and was pleased to hear Sherlock’s door open, but the man did not enter the kitchen again. John watched his shadow against the floor as he stopped just short of the doorway. “Yes, just leave it out here.”
Holmes leaned forward and kissed John’s temple.
“This isn’t funny.”
Lightning arced across the sky again, and Holmes and Watson both winced. There was a pause, and Holmes squeezed encouragingly at Watson’s hand, urging him to continue.
“I – no. Well. Not really.”
Oh hell.
“Say my name.”
“I recovered because of you.” John was not in the mood for subtlety. Some part of him longed for the simple peace and comfort of that embrace. “Sherlock, I’m a wreck. If you want me to go, and deal with my flashbacks somewhere else, I will. This isn’t your problem. You don’t need to make a plan to ‘remove the possibility’ because I should have done that ages ago. I should –”
Footsteps on the stairs. And in his nose, the smell of …dust…rain…not sand. Someone in the hall. Realizing that all was not as it seemed, he still slid the safety catch off, muscle memory acting without ever having to look at the weapon in his fist, and listened. Blocked out the pain, the discomfort, his heartbeat, and listened. Deadly still.
John snorted. “The hell it will.” He tipped his head back and let it thump against the wall behind him. “You can go now. Thanks for the water.”
“John –”
“I…I cannot…how can you sleep if you are cold, John…”
“No such thing.”
“Then I will not sleep, but will sit up in your bed all night and keep vigil!”
“Yes, but –”
Dropping it immediately to the slippery floor, Holmes braced John’s hips as he leaned forward and very gently pressed his lips to the scar lines on John’s left shoulder. His flatmate’s head fell back on a moan. “Sh- Sherlock. No one else has ever done that.”
Glass in the windowpanes? And outside, was that a…streetlamp?
“Not…really….not anymore.”
At the groan, Sherlock’s breath faltered and his hands came to rest tentatively at John’s hips. “Do you – do you think that – this….um….” He was panting now, but his face was still flushed and his eyes too bright, too wide.
“Another locked-room murder, your favorite, eh Holmes?”
With an incredulous snort, John dropped his fork into his plate. “You’ve taken up deduction now, too? You’ve been following me around? What the fuck??”
“My line, Sherlock.”
Watson peeked up at him. “You don’t need luck.”
“Are you alright?”
“The hell it isn’t!” John sat up sharply, dislodging Holmes’ hands. “I could have killed you. They’d have scraped you off the walls and brought you out in a bucket, at this range. I shouldn’t be here, I’m not safe, there’s so much wrong with me. I’m a danger to you. I’m messed up, Holmes, don’t you see that?”
Orgasm crashed through him, whited out his vision, stopped his breath in his lungs, wrung him dry. Collapsing onto his back, John looked up at Holmes through bleary, satisfied eyes. For a moment they just caught their breath, together in this, together in Holmes’ bed, sated.
“You shot a man for me.”
And John cornered him, backed him into the space between the table and the wall, their bodies mere centimeters apart. “I said,” John breathed, “come in here and get it yourself.”
John twisted, took a big step backwards. “If you’re what?”
He looked up into the dark, dark eyes of Sherlock Holmes, who was standing stock-still, barely breathing, and then John Watson fainted.
“We can’t all have exacting military precision, John.”
And John turned, cast a sharp salute to the dead soldier, and left the room.
John set his mug down before he could drop it and moved forward before he could think. “I nearly killed you. I could have.” He slid his arms around Holmes and dropped his forehead against the taller man’s spine. Holmes stiffened at his touch.
“Hardly, Watson, and it does not bear debating. Your tea’s gone cold.”
“Approximately six hours ago.”
That gasp punched right into John’s gut, with an intensity that startled him. Suddenly it was all too much and not enough at the same time. “Sh – Sherlock, I –”
Holmes’ fist tightened on John’s body as the detective came, still thrusting, still moaning, body shaking so hard that the breath stuttered out of his chest, and his vision blurred. Pleasure was a delirious ride, surrounded by the warmth and feel and smell of John Watson. Everything –the soldier’s strength, the doctor’s gentleness, the friend’s compassion – and everything more, for which Holmes did not yet have the words. Everything he was desperate to discover.
“Watson.”
Those soft, wet flicks sparked electricity in Holmes, shooting across every nerve ending, centering in his groin. He shivered, startled, gasping, wanting more.
“Let me guess,” Harry went on. “When you’re in public, he sits near you but never addresses you, never makes eye contact with you. Never engages you in conversation, never laughs at your jokes. Seems especially disinterested in mention of you, brushes off your name, refuses to listen to any gossip, and ignores you more than anyone else?”
“You’re a brave man, John Watson.”
“And?”
“Witnesses?”
The next handful hit Holmes square in the chest.
Holmes reached out tentatively for John’s hand, arms still crossed around his knees. To his surprise, John took it. His fingers were cold and clammy, but they wrapped around Holmes’ warmer ones and held on as he continued to speak.
“So has yours. It’s different, to me.”
For the second time in ten hours, the tears rolled down John’s face before he even felt them in his eyes. “Jesus, Sherlock.” But it was hushed, behind his hands, broken.
“Then let me stay.”
It came out more of a croak, and he desperately tried to wet dry lips. “Holmes…”
He turned and followed Holmes back into the living room; he looked up at his flatmate’s back as Holmes set down his breakfast and picked up a battered pamphlet, stained in old, dark brown blood. “I found this in the bookshelf this morning,” he commented casually.
The roll of thunder was less intense now, farther away, but John still tensed minutely next to Holmes. He tipped his head back against the wall again. “You should go back to bed.”
John hesitated just a split second too long before opening his mouth to respond, and Harry laughed at him like she used to when they were grade school children, playing truth or dare. It wasn’t cruel or harsh, but more playful and affectionate. “Go on, John, go see what happens. What could it hurt?”
“Yes.” John’s eyes were half lidded in pleasure as he leaned closer, pressing himself more firmly into Holmes’ hand, pressing kisses and sharp little nips against Holmes’ jaw line. “What do you need? What can I give you?”
Holmes actually blushed, faintly. “On the head, it hardly matters.”
“You’ve kissed me twice now.”
~ Walt Whitman
This was ridiculous, John decided for the hundredth time. We’re men, we’re British men but we’re going to address this like grownups. He poured water over his teabag and assured himself that the flush over his face was the steam rising from the cup and had nothing to do with wondering, what happens if it’s true?
“You flatter me.”
“Please?”
“Because I’m right.”
His shoulder burned like hell though, when had that started? Had he himself been hurt?
Had he not been a military man, John would have squirmed. As it was, he waved a hand towards the tea mugs. “How did you know I was up? Were you going to bring me tea in bed, then?”
“I know.” A pause. “Because you’ll be there anyway.”
Quickly: “Tell me: do the nightmares come if you do not sleep alone?”
Sherlock blinked once, then dropped back, half shrugged, resting his hip against the counter, eyes averted. Interesting. “You give your own statements. I fail to see why I should have to do that for you as well –”
Holmes reached out and tentatively took John’s gloved hand in his own. “There doesn’t need to be, you know.”
Very quietly: “Sherlock?”
As a soldier John had never believed much in subtlety. Once decided, it was as good a thing as done. But if the blush staining Sherlock’s cheeks was any indication, something wasn’t as off as they had been pretending.
“I don’t know.” John shrugged, false casual, and shifted closer, bracing his hands on either side of Sherlock’s body and effectively caging him in. Sherlock tried to slide farther back and met the wall. His expression took on a slightly panicked cast.
“In your statements. In your press interviews. How come you never say my name?”
“Really?”
“I’m not leaving.”
“Yes.”
They eased onto the bed together, side by side, careful of John’s shoulder. By the time Holmes had unbuttoned John’s trousers, John had his hands in Holmes’ pants, and the consulting detective arched up into the touch, groaning. “Oh God, yes, John! More!”
“Watson, if you do not cease this nonsense –”
From years of training – and, more significantly, experience – he automatically quieted his breathing and slowed his heart rate, body utterly still in the dark, quiet room, eyes scanning for any hint of movement. Nothing. His eyes already adjusting, seeking a human form in any of the shadows lurking in the corners, the quiver of a single muscle that betray the position of an insurgent.
“What, leave? You wish me to leave?”
Holmes rolled his eyes and squatted near the body. “You know I abhor repeating myself, Lestrade. As much as I hate loose ends. If you refuse to provide me with sufficient information –”
“How come you never mention me?”
“What would you have me say?” The words were muffled. “I woke you up in the middle of the night to watch me cry like a child, because of a thunderstorm?”
“Housekeeper? Maid? Any hired help?”
“Upstairs?”
“Fuck, Sherlock.” John couldn’t help but breathe in his flatmate’s scent, his nose pressed against the collar of the man’s button-down shirt.
The next flash of lightning was dimmer; it glinted off the gun, still lying empty in the center of the floor. John leaned forward, the quilt slipping off his shoulders, to retrieve it; falling short, he climbed onto his knees and, bracing himself on his good arm, reached out and tenderly lifted the cold metal. Holmes could not help but observe the line of his flatmate’s body in the grey, pre-dawn light: the still-muscular shoulders, the slope of his strong back beneath the T-shirt, the trim waist. Rather than sit down again, John climbed to his feet and dropped the gun into his open bedside drawer and nudged the drawer closed. “Well, that’s that…”
Holmes smoothed John’s hair with the hand not around his shoulders. “You’re safe here, it’s alright,” he murmured, still out of his depth.
It was a strange thing to watch the great detective fumble. He released John’s arms, took a careful step back. “In – in your room, Watson, whatever. Should the occasion arise, I will be, um, stationed appropriately; the semantics do not matter.” He lifted a careless hand, seeking an artless gesture, which was lost in his awkward confusion.
“My –” Watson jerked the neck of his T-shirt open and stared down at the small, purple, ropy lines blossoming across his left shoulder. No wonder the roll across the hardwood floor had awakened so much pain. Something dropped onto the shirt, a dark spot, and then another, and for a split second he wondered if he was bleeding somewhere. It took a few minutes before he realized that he was crying.
“Not a significant one, no.” Holmes glanced up at the small smile hinting on John’s face. “Should I take that to mean there will be a storm tonight, then?”
“Considered what?”
Holmes cocked his head. “Spouting poetry, Watson?”
“You’re insufferable.”
There was silence, for a moment. Lestrade cleared his throat. “But why another suicide?”
“Yes, very,” John agreed, grinding slowly again, leaning back just a little to increase the pressure and to look up into his flatmate’s eyes. He groaned a little, in the back of his throat, to see the heated gaze. “Damn, you feel so good.”
This time, the blush wasn’t a hint; it was dark and pervasive. Sherlock tried to turn away but John leaned in, leaned his body against the detective, pressed his hips against Sherlock’s and felt the air leave the man’s lungs in a rush.
The tears had long dried, but the self-recrimination was sharp, clear, and ugly. Very slowly, Holmes lifted his hand to John’s wrist, felt for his pulse. “Everything is going to be alright, John, just take a deep breath.”
The next explosion rocked him back into action – he was already rolling to his feet and reaching for his gun when he felt the hand on his shoulder.
“‘Far, far out of reach, / studded, breaking out, the eternal stars.’”
If Holmes heard, he did not comment. Rather he arranged the quilt over Watson’s body, smoothed it slowly, deliberately. And then, as if reaching some conclusion, set his hip awkwardly down by Watson’s, as though to look into the other man’s face. Watson moved, to give his flatmate more room to perch, and instead Holmes surprised them both by laying out full-length.
“No need.” Holmes sat up and slowly, cautiously, put a hand up to John’s shoulder, recoiling when John flinched hard. “Did you hurt your scar?”
Holmes gently felt for his pulse again, and saw John try to smile. “I know what you’re doing.”
Gentler, now: “I’m coming in now, Watson.” The voice was close, separated from him by thin wood, and he stiffened, realizing he had never relaxed his grip on the gun. The doorknob jiggled, turned, and the lock slipped from its catch. The sudden appearance of a hand around the frame, right by Watson’s face, jarred him into motion again – instinct took over – he caught the wrist, threw his weight, ignored the burning pain his shoulder again, lifted the gun and fired, point-blank range.
He nearly dropped the kettle when Sherlock spoke from the doorway. Though he was still staring at the mug, John was sure he’d already deduced every single sentence of John’s inner monologue. “Is something the matter?”
“Just me. Yes.
“No, John.” Harry shook her head in a way that was eerily similar to Sherlock, save that strange soft expression. “He’s trying so hard to treat like you don’t matter because you matter too much. He’s trying way too hard.” Now her eyes refocused, met his with a direct gaze. “He doesn’t know what to do.”
“No, for –” A sigh this time. “Yes. That. This, all of this. Thanks.”
“I think not.” The first of the colorful leaves swirled at their feet as they began the walk back to Baker Street. “There hasn’t been a thunderstorm in several months.”
The detective did not answer as he ducked under the caution tape, then held it up for John to enter the scene as well. “Time of death?”
There was silence. John had pulled his knees up and wrapped his arms around them. He wasn’t looking at Holmes. Another burst of lightning and he dropped his face into the dark space created by his raised arms.
“Any signs of forced entry?”
Holmes groaned and deepened the kiss. Heat rose in John’s body, consuming, overwhelming. He broke the kiss, sucking in air, his heart beating wildly against Holmes’ chest.
“In the hospital we set up beds among the rubble. Pallets, of any soft material we could find. Hung the IV bags off broken pieces of the walls. I had soldiers with minor injuries sitting lined up in the hall. When there was room, and I had time, the locals came in too. When –” he nearly laughed again. “There was no room. I never had time. The locals came in anyway. I treated everything.” Now he was looking into his flatmate’s face. “Everything. Compound fractures, gangrene from botched amputations, open sores, distended organs from lack of nutrition, bullet wounds, children dying of diarrhea. Diarrhea, Holmes, do you have any idea how easy that is to treat? In England? You hardly need to go into the surgery for that.
“None – the neighbors thought they heard a struggle, but in this weather, everyone’s windows are closed all night. Starting to get right cold at night.”
“In Fallujah? Dead in two days.”
“Everything.” John gestured to the framed Medal of Honor hanging above the fireplace. “This is the father’s.” Then to the blank wall space beside it. “And this space for the son’s.”
Harry shrugged, but gave him a small, gentle smile that John couldn’t help but return. It had been so long since he’d really connected with his sister. “Maybe I am, maybe this stupid romantic’s heart of mine isn’t quite as dead as I thought it was. But John – what happens if I’m not?”
And then they were breathless with laughter – a little strained, a little too bright, but still genuine. This time when John stepped forward with determination in his eyes, Holmes held his breath, and was prepared for the spark of electricity that shot through him. He swallowed.
With a moan, the detective’s knees gave out, and he nearly slid down the wall until John caught him at his underarms. “Sit.” He steered Sherlock to a chair and turned back to the sink, resting his hands on the cool metal, breathing deeply. “Okay. Too much, yeah? That’s ok.”
Sherlock shook his head, still flushed. “John, the reason I – I can’t – I’ve never –”
Holmes and Lestrade paused, looked up at John, who was still standing in the doorway, eyes focused on the bookshelf across the room. “And quite possibly not the only one.”
“There’s one for the records.”
“Divorced. Four years ago. Away on a weekend with friends. Confirmed – she’s still gone.”
And if, as he dozed in the last sleepy stages of consciousness, cocooned in the warm arms of peaceful, oblivious sleep, he felt warm lips brush his temple in a clear gesture of comfort and affection – he simply accepted what was offered, and fell.
“Right.” John’s face was turned away, towards the window, and he felt Holmes’ breath ghost across his cheek. He rolled off his flatmate but did not take his hand from the lean chest. “Yes. Right. I just – I’m sorry.”
“Are – are you still hard?”
That was more like it. John limped past him into the kitchen, careful to avoid the beakers, poured hot water over the teabags. The silence hung heavy around him as he struggled for an opening line. ‘About last night’ didn’t begin to cover it. ‘I’m sorry I almost shot you’ was laughable.
The detective moaned, unable to stop himself, rocking his hips forward into that maddening tightness of John’s fingers. John levered himself carefully forward, his tongue licking a stripe across Holmes’ chest, pausing to bite at a nipple. Holmes gasped, arched his spine up off the bed. It was too much. He couldn’t get enough. Dizzying pleasure swam through his veins, headier than cocaine, and he was terrified that it would not last. That he would not ever get enough.
“What, he ignores me? Because the most important person in the world to him is him.”
The next explosion took them both by surprise, and Holmes even more when John hurled himself up from the floor, and the next second had Holmes pinned to the boards beneath him. They were pressed so close that Holmes could feel the unnatural stillness of the other man’s body; could feel the exact moment when that body began to shake.
The damnedest part of it all was, Harry was right.
“Because I think you’re perfect.”
“It’s not. John, forget it.”
“Yes.”
“Good morning.”
The words were out before Holmes had even registered them in his thoughts. John glanced at him, and Holmes was surprised to see amusement in his gaze. “Oh indeed. Very much so. All brave men hide in the corner during thunderstorms.”
A forced sound that might have almost been mistaken for a laugh. “No.”
“I – I’m so sorry…” John disengaged his arms and Holmes began to struggle. Thinking his flatmate to seek escape, John backed away, but Holmes caught his bicep, turned in his arms, and responded with an embrace of his own. “Oh, John.”
“Holmes, if that gun had been loaded –”
Another in Holmes’ hair.
Holmes caught up with him outside the building. “John.” Dark eyes searched a calm face. “That was brilliant.”
“You still think about it??”
John inhaled. “Thank you.”
A shaky breath. “Yes. I won’t bother asking how you knew.”
“I observe you.”
“Clearly not.”
“Local girl. Lives six blocks away.”
“Cab?”
“Inspector, it might be of interest to you to find out who the other soldier in the photograph is, and his parents, and see if his father is still living.”
Struggling to control himself, John eased up just a little, just enough to meet Sherlock’s gaze squarely and say, more levelly than he himself expected: “If you do not want this, I’ll go.” At Sherlock’s panicked startle, he amended – “I’ll go upstairs, and later on we can talk about it, or never mention it again. But say you don’t want it and I’ll stop right away.”
Abandoning his mug on the counter, John went to Sherlock’s bedroom door. “What are you on about, anyway? Do you want a cup of tea or not? Then get out here.”
A few heartbeats of silence, calm, security. And then –
“Tea? Is that all you came in here to get?”
. Holmes could be dead right now. Dead from his hand. Dead from his traumatized brain. Dead from –
Holmes shrugged with a brevity he did not feel. “Of course.”
“Trust?? I would have shot you!!”
John extracted his hands from Holmes’ (gorgeous, soft) curls and scrubbed them over his face. “I – um. No. Maybe. Still too much. I’m sorry, Sherlock. I told you I’m a mess. Why don’t you believe me.”
There was no stopping the blush that raced across his cheeks, nor Harry’s subsequent laughter, so the ex-soldier military surgeon did the best thing brothers do when confronted with their sister’s teasing: he ran.
“What’s this got to do with him?”
Holmes glanced down; Watson’s face was tuned into his shoulder. “This happens often?”
Holmes paused, filing that one away for later. His knees began to ache, and he settled into a seated position, pressed against his flatmate, one arm still around John’s shoulders. “Do you want to tell me about it?”
There was no response to that, so John settled for another kiss, which grew in intensity until he was pulling at Holmes’ robe, sliding his hands beneath for more skin. “I – I don’t know how this is going to go, Sherlock, I don’t know how much I can do for you, if I can –”
“I always keep the gun unloaded for precisely that reason, Holmes –”
John lifted the edge of the quilt and Holmes slipped beneath it, laying atop the blankets, by John’s side. He tentatively slipped an arm across John’s abdomen but did not move too close to the sore shoulder. There was silence as both men’s bodies relaxed incrementally. Thunder rumbled again, distant now, but John was lulled into a sense of security by the warm body at his side. Exhausted by the exertion of energy, the flashback, the panic, the shock, the retelling of difficult memories, he settled slowly into the sense of rightness, the way Holmes’ breathing was reassuring rather than alarming. Comrades-in-arms.
“Who?”
John dropped his gaze. “…right.” His voice was soft, and most of the frustration had gone out of it, but it was still very, very unhappy.
man nudged his flatmate backwards, towards the bed. When they reached it John turned and climbed back into the twisted sheets; reaching out to smooth his blanket, noticed that his hands still shook. He stared at them. “Damn.”
The news arrives like Sherlock always expected it would — via Mycroft.
But then Jamie reappeared, all grown up — his childish daring turned to intriguing danger — and I thought…
‘You’ve not looked at me in months, John,’ Sherlock replies tiredly, though still flinching at being called names, ‘It’s been even longer since you’ve willingly spoken to me. I think… I think parting ways at this time could only do you well, and perhaps finally allow you to heal. And I don’t begrudge you that. I understand completely.’
John still does not move or speak, so Sherlock simply swallows hard, and goes to return his still mostly full cup of tea to the kitchen, but as he passes by, a hand shoots out and grabs his wrist. Startled, Sherlock stops and whips around, and finds himself face-to-face with his furious husband.
Mycroft visits every few weeks or so, and John will at least attempt to hold stilted, awkward conversation with him. Mycroft is also grieving the loss of his nephew, but Sherlock sees him deal with it the only way he knows how: by throwing himself even more vehemently into work. He occasionally lets slip updates on the situation with Moriarty and Moran, and it takes every ounce of resilience Sherlock has not to grab Mycroft by the lapels and demand he tell him everything. Ignorance is his penance.
After a time, Sherlock clears his throat, and speaks, still gripping John’s hand in his.
Sherlock raises his cup to his lips, and takes a long swallow before he continues, still refusing to look at John, ‘John, I… I want you to know that I spoke with our attorney and Mycroft a few weeks ago, and updated my will in case something like this were to happen. You have been named the beneficiary on what remains of my trust, and on any accounts or investments that were not in both our names. The title of this house has been transferred to your name. I have written instructions for… After. No fuss, no service, and if… If there is a body, please give it to Barts for future study. And… And please know that, despite everything, I would not trade a single moment of these last twenty-two years for anything in the world. You, and… And Hamish were… Are… Everything. And I hope, in time, you will be able to forgive me.’
Sherlock nods, hating everything all over again — what is the point of living in a world in which John Watson could not enjoy a cup of tea.
More words, a few songs, and then it is over. The mourners depart, and John is left, holding Rosie to his chest. Lestrade nods at him, Mrs Hudson tearfully gives him space, and then he is alone, faced with the hard black granite headstone for a second time. He wonders briefly if they managed to changed the year of death, or if this is a new, but identical grave marker.
alone in this ‘pointless waste of a world’?’ John breathes, dangerously, ‘You selfish, fucking prick.’
Subtext — Forgive me.
Mycroft sits back down at the table, replaces his napkin in his lap with a flourish, stares morosely at his brother, then opens his mouth.
?) that Moriarty had indeed returned.
‘That doesn’t mean I don’t still love you,’ John repeats carefully, ‘And it certainly doesn’t mean that I don’t want you alive, or with me. I… Sherlock, these last six months have destroyed me. It’s like screaming into the void every moment, and no one can hear me, and I can’t seem to find a way out. I’ve never felt anything close to this level of all-consuming anguish. But… It was never about you, and I shouldn’t have said it was,’ he takes a deep breath, ‘You are still… You are still the best man, and most… Human human being that I’ve ever known. And I love you so much. So please… Just stop it. Stop this now, and let’s figure out another plan. Together.’
