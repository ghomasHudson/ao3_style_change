Dean woke to early morning sunlight streaming into his eyes, a throbbing headache and a seriously pissed off angel glaring at him fiercely. He straightened up slowly, wincing at the sharp pain in his chest. He didn’t look at Castiel.
“Hey Darlin’” He mumbled, still half asleep. He couldn’t quite remember her name. He sat up, blinking the sleep out of his eyes and set his hand on her arm. He was trying to remember what had happened last night. He’d gone to the diner with Cas and after that… After that he just came back to their room. He closed his eyes and winced, his sleepy brain just then putting two and two together.
“Why the hell aren’t you coming?” Dean demanded when Sam told them to go without him.
Dean dropped the gun and surged forward. He grasped Castiel in a tight hug. Dean was so much taller than her and it was strange to think of this woman as Cas, but at the same time she seemed so familiar. How had he not seen it immediately? Her movements were ones that he had known for years and despite the strangeness, the hug felt familiar too.
Why had he done that?! Why the hell would he kiss Cas?! It was Cas! Dean’s best friend, family even. Even with his pain addled mind he never would have – maybe he
When had he started thinking that? Cas was by no means
Cas and it was obvious, but it was also strange and Dean wasn’t sure why it was strange because nothing had really changed. Castiel was still an angel in a vessel and nothing was different and she was still just Cas, but –
any, except for the stuff that her other vessel already has on. We can’t very well strip Cas’s body and leave it like that Dean. And as for my stuff, our clothes are going to be way too big for her regardless, but she’ll practically drown if she has to wear my clothes. And nobody is going to ‘snoop’ through your stuff. Cas is just going to grab some clothes and leave.”
“Newlyweds?!”
“Cas! Cas, come on man, you’d better be okay. Open your eyes man. Cas, don’t fucking die on me, Cas. Don’t you dare leave me.” Dean wasn’t even sure what he was saying. He had no idea what was happening.
Castiel carried Dean up out of the basement, through the house and out the door to the Impala. She gingerly placed him in the passenger seat, raced upstairs to grab their things and drove out of Adams as fast as possible.
Things went downhill from there. Dean drank until he blacked out every night for the first week. Then he didn’t drink at all; or eat. He just spent all day with his face in books about spells, angel lore and anything that might provide even the slightest clue as to what to do now.
Dean blinked at her. Apparently she had heard his conversation with Sam after all. Shit.
“You came,” She said in awe, “You actually came.”
“Yeah, thanks Cas. I noticed.” Dean griped. “Hey Beatrice, we’re burning your shit! Come and get it!”
“There have been a few equipment related accidents and one suicide.” Castiel said, looking up from the laptop.
Castiel heard a voice praying. He followed the sound and found himself in someone’s dream. No, that wasn’t right, this wasn’t a dream. He had been somewhere like this before and he knew what it meant. The person who had prayed to him was in a coma. He was sharing their thoughts. Castiel approached the woman whose mind he now found himself in. She looked at him, his true form, with reverence and love.
Dean huffed. Sam surveyed him quizzically.
“Jesus Cas! Personal space man!” Dean said as he jolted the cart to a halt.
“What?” Dean was still stuck in his own head, thoughts swirling around like debris in a tornado.
Blinding white light flared through the room. An invisible force blasted Dean across the room. When he opened his eyes he saw Sam and Rowena on the far side of the library. Megan was gone; apparently blasted to atoms. Cas wasn’t moving.
“Like what Cas? Just start making out and shouting about how great a fake marriage we have?” Dean’s voice dripped with sarcasm.
“Good plan, but first dinner. I’m starving. I saw a diner on the way in that we could check out.” Dean stopped crouching over Cas and closed the laptop screen.
“Yes. What now?” Castiel looked at Dean imploringly. They got into the car and Dean started the engine.
It was Dean’s turn to interrupt and he blurted out, “It’s not about that Cas!”
Apparently Cas was done taking Dean’s shit. The angel stood in the ruined doorway with a murderous expression. His eyes flashed with anger and hurt. Dean couldn’t pull his gaze away.
“Just this once.” He said without looking at Castiel.
Cas was the fastest person Dean had ever been shopping with. He’d been on beer runs that had taken longer. She wasn’t interested in looking at clothes. She barely even tried them on. She also seemed determined to minimize the amount of change happening in the lives of the Winchesters. That or she really did miss her old clothes. Castiel, angel of the lord was back. She was clad in her typical black suit, white shirt and blue tie, and of course the damn trench coat. There she was, back in all her glory, God’s Holy Tax Accountant. There was something so familiar about it, despite the fact that Cas was currently blond and almost a foot shorter than him, that it made Dean’s heart ache. Staring at his best friend all he could think about was how much he had missed her these last few weeks.
“Oh good. You’re alive.” She spat, her voice deadly calm. Cas was always scariest when she used that voice. It was a voice she reserved for her bitterest enemies, or for Dean when he had done something particularly Dean-like. It was a voice that resonated with rage and power and the full might of a heavenly soldier. It was the voice of an angel hell bent, or rather god sent, towards righteous destruction. Dean had to stop himself from shrinking back at Castiel’s words.
“She’ll be back in a minute. She’s getting changed.” Sam said, “What did Rowena say?”
Sam didn’t want to believe that Castiel was gone either, but all the evidence said that there was no coming back this time. He had found a simple preservation spell for Castiel’s body, but it would only last so long before the effect wore off. They still didn’t really know what had happened. They just knew that Cas was gone.
His eyes flicked to Cas’s lips. Castiel breathed out in surprise but he didn’t move away. Dean locked his eyes with Cas. He wanted so desperately to kiss Castiel. He’s wanted it for a long time, he just hadn’t realized it. He’d been pushing it down and burying it, caught up in his own head and thoughts of a father who taught him what it meant to be a man. Dean leaned in.
They scoured through information on the property for about an hour. The couples hadn’t started to go missing until the property became a bed and breakfast. It was an old house and a few people had died there before the first disappearances.
“What the hell happened Cas?” Asked Dean. He was acting a bit odd, thought Castiel. He was fidgety and he kept glancing at her with an unplaceable expression then looking away awkwardly. “Where have you been for the past 2 weeks?”
“Sam called,” He said, “Rowena’s at the bunker. We should get back.” He started the engine and cranked the volume dial, effectively drowning out Cas’s next words. She glared at him and he pretended not to notice.
“How should I know? It happened a million years ago. She was probably unhappy. Word is she hung herself in her wedding dress.”
“Hi, I’m Dean Ulrich and this is Cas Hetfield. We’re reporters, can we speak to your parents?” Dean gave the kid a smile.
It turned out that the founder of Williams, William H. Merritt, had harnessed the spirit of an Irish witch named Thirza Byrne to ensure the prosperity of the town. Her spirit was tied to a branch of the blackthorn tree she’d been hanged on in the early 1600s.
“Cut the crap lady! Answer the damn question. Who the hell are you?!” Dean growled. He seemed to have gone from shock to earthshattering rage in a matter of seconds. “Because I know for damn sure that who and whatever you are, it ain’t Cas. Castiel is dead and if you so much as utter his name again I will blow your brains out without a second thought!”
“Dean,” Sam said closing the laptop, “We don’t know what this is yet, but I don’t think we’ll need divine intervention.”
“I’ll fix it.” He said impassively, “We need to talk.”
“Uh, just – why are you a girl dude? Why aren’t you back in your body? We didn’t burn it or anything.” He shot a glance at Sam when he said that. Castiel considered for a moment before shaking her head.
She was wearing one of Dean’s Zeppelin Shirts, one of the ones he usually slept in, and a pair of his jeans that were way too big. The shirt was slipping off one of her shoulders and it went down almost to her knees. She looked up at the Winchesters as she stood by the doorway with an annoyed expression. It was so incredibly adorable and kinda hot at the same time that -
“Well I think we can safely say we’ve got a vengeful spirit on our hands.” Dean told Cas as they walked to the Impala.
There was Dean, unconscious and bound with a noose wrapped around his neck. He was crumpled on the floor under a beam as if Beatrice had just been about to string him up when she erupted into flames. Castiel barely registered the broken bodies hanging all around the basement as she shot towards Dean. She knelt beside him and saw, with relief, the soft rise and fall of his chest as he breathed shallowly. She pulled the rope over his head and lifted him into her arms.
.” Castiel said, making air quotes and looking at Dean intently. “I would appreciate if you referred to me as such, out of respect for Megan.”
“Hey Cas?”
“The husband had children. A few members of the family still live in town. We should go talk to them and see if we can retrieve any more information.” Cas said.
“Everything helps ma’am.” Dean said. “We were looking into the house actually, the one that has since been converted into the Bed and Breakfast. I believe it was owned by the Green family until 1903?”
“Is there anything I can do to make it easier for you? If it makes you feel better I do also wish to return to my usual vessel as soon as possible. I’d hate to think that I am causing you any trouble.” Cas seemed genuinely concerned that this was her fault despite Dean’s reassurances to the contrary.
“Isn’t it Dean?!”
“Dean-” She was scowling, looking both confused and angry. She was about to draw Dean into a conversation about his, frankly uncalled for and inappropriate behavior for the second time that day. Dean cut her off before she could get further than his name.
“Can anything be done?” the angel asked.
“For all intents and purposes, until I return to my usual vessel, yes Dean. I am a ‘
“Dean, move!” She growled.
“Alright Dean.” She said simply. “Thank you for taking me to get new clothing.”
“Watcha got Sammy?” Dean said as way of greeting. He sauntered into the library with a coffee mug in hand. Sam looked up from his laptop.
“I need the keys.”
reacting to).
“Well, I recognize the spell. Very old, very powerful.” She said running her fingers over Castiel’s – Jimmy’s forehead.
“Dude, calm down!” Said Sam, taken aback by Dean’s, frankly uncalled for overreaction, “She can’t just wear her own clothes because she doesn’t
“Thank you Dean.” Said Castiel, putting the belt on. She pulled it as tight as it would go and the jeans bunched up a ludicrous amount. “This will suffice for now.”
“We can’t be sure.” Cas replied, “But your plan to draw her out isn’t working out very well.”
“Our condolences for your loss. I hope we aren’t imposing too much.” Castiel said with a sympathetic smile.
“You could be helping with this you know. You do have your own computer.” Cas said, turning to look up at Dean.
“Please angel, I will leave soon regardless. Take my body, you need it more than I do.”
“She appears to have been cremated, as far as I can tell.” Castiel pointed at the obituary on the screen.
“Hey, I called her. Where’s Cas?” Dean asked, suddenly worried.
“Oh yeah chuckles,” Dean growled, “You’re doing a great job keeping the town happy and healthy, except, oh wait you’re not because you’re actually just murdering people!” He raised his gun (loaded with witch killing bullets of course) and pointed it at the guy’s chest.
They headed up the steps to the Green’s house and knocked on the door. A kid about 12 answered the door.
“Yes, all the couples that were taken were married in the last year or so.”
“Mom! There’s a couple of reporters at the door!” The kid shouted into the house. A moment later a woman, the kid’s Mom presumably, showed up at the door.
“Are you sure Dean, you sound - ” Sam started.
Dean didn’t look any less confused. Cas sighed.
When they got back to the bunker Cas hardly waited for Dean to cut the engine before stalking out of the garage without waiting for him. Fair enough. Dean followed her into the library to see Sam and Rowena standing beside Cas’s body which had been laid out on one of the long tables. Dean’s heart gave a painful lurch.
“Alright, but that doesn’t explain why she’s killing these people.” Dean said after Sam explained everything he had learned.
“Cas, man, you’re not causing trouble. I shouldn’t have said anything. I was just trying to figure out the situation. I know this has gotta be difficult for you. Don’t worry about me. Forget I said anything. Just focus on getting better and we can get you back where you belong, alright?” Dean cautioned a glance back at Cas who nodded, that familiar faint smile playing across her lips.
“Um, do you actually want an answer or…” Dean faltered as Castiel’s eyes narrowed. He sagged slightly in his seat. Then he straightened purposefully.
“You mean, you
“Yeah, well maybe that’s because Cas is a
It didn’t take them long to get to the Green’s house. Dean fished through the glove compartment for their badges. FBI seemed overkill. Inspectors? Reporters? Yeah, reporters could work. He pulled out two badges and paused.
“4 people in Williams Iowa were found hanged in their back yards in the past 7 months. Police chalked it up to suicides, but get this, they were all hanged from blackthorn trees.”
“Oh and pick up some groceries while you’re at it.” He shouted as Dean marched off to the garage grumbling.
“Something like that. I’m not really sure of the exact date. And please, Susan is fine. Ma’am makes me feel like an old lady.”
“Vegetables are good for you Dean.” Cas said, sounding exasperated as she surveyed the grocery list. “We need eggs.”
When they got back to the bunker Sam was waiting for them, laptop in hand. He barely waited until that had the groceries put away before he flipped the screen towards them.
“I think there is. I would like to know what possessed you to act as you did.” Castiel was standing resolutely in the doorway, cutting off Dean’s only exit.
“Doesn’t matter, I don’t need your help anymore. I think you should go now.” Cas tears his eyes away and slumps back against the seat. From his peripheral’s, he watches Dean’s eyes and shoulders fall, looking like a kicked puppy. He stays there for a moment, waiting for Cas to say something else. When he doesn’t, the angel sighs. Then, in a flurry of wingbeats, he’s gone.
It takes a while, but they end up with five lines of broken dirt, each one many paces long. While Victor and Rufus poke holes in the soil for the seeds, Dean goes through every sachet inside the pouch and goes about sprinkling a few in each hole. He covers them up and pats them lightly until he’s gone through at least half of each sachet. When he starts bringing water to them with a bowl, May helps with that too, surprisingly staying out of his way. Ellen and Jo start helping while Victor and Rufus take a break for something to eat.

That is always a treat, as he finds that he does not often have the time to go there in between lessons, and certainly not in the last sol cycle since he began observing 1-M-7. There is no time for just doing whatever he would like while he is working on his thesis, or focusing on his lessons.
Dean has heard of these creatures before, but only in myth. They are said to be very dangerous and extremely aggressive, with few who encountered them or their colonies coming back alive. But Dean can’t imagine the sight before him being anything less than beautiful.

heights make him feel like throwing up. If he fell from this height, it would hurt, but he probably wouldn’t die, and Dean is going to cling to that thought to keep himself from passing out whenever he looks down.
It takes a while for Castiel to calm, Dean rubbing his arms and helping him steady his breathing, but eventually, Cas’s shock subsides. His brain no longer a complete mess, Cas finally finds the will to speak. “Thank you…” he says almost in a whisper, shame filling him. Dean just saved his life
“I couldn’t wake you up and I felt so… useless. As if I had lost my grace again.” Castiel says and Dean knows how much Castiel hated his time as a human. Dean did a shitty job of telling Castiel that he was always useful and… important to him.
There is a panel next to the circular iris door that opens it with a single touch. The weather report that came to his PADD this morning indicates that it will be a warm, sunny day – which is quite normal for this time of the sol cycle. Already he can smell the sunshine and feel the wind that races through the floating city.
“Where is that light coming from?” Dean pointed up the path, into the fog. The warm flickering light was small — and not enough to penetrate the white atmosphere.
Ellen touches his shoulder again and Dean goes still. He drops his hands and holds still for another flash of light, and then everything draws back up to the ceiling. Dean sits up right away, and Cas doesn’t tell him to lie down again. Ellen must know that’s the last of the lying down bit, because she pulls herself up to sit on the table again.

“He can,” Dean nodded in agreement, “And he’s got the whole seraph thing going on, flaming wings and all.”
Behind the trees is just another white wall. Dean almost runs into it head first. The trees are only five layers deep, and that doesn’t even count as a forest. The vines hang down over this wall too, and Dean desperately searches under it for a hint of another door. He can’t find anything, even as he makes his way along to the right.

But the
But this is something that he’s scared to bring up here. Dean doesn’t want to think about the chance that he might still be here next summer. But it’s becoming more and more likely, because he’s running out of ways to try and escape. He did try to go up the waterfall a second time, also at night while everyone was sleeping. That time, no one started yelling, but the

Dean raised an eyebrow, “Ye of little faith,” he teased, “Who says he has to be close to fight?”
The angel took him in slowly. Dean gasped at every new inch of heat around him, whining and gripping the angel’s thighs as Cas lowered himself to squeeze the sides of his waist. He could barely breathe by the time Cas was fully settled, panting heavily and holding onto Cas’s legs, leaving white underneath his fingers. “H-holy crap,” Dean’s head fell back onto the pillow in a moment of pure ecstasy, “You feel so fucking good.” Smiling, Cas leaned down and planted a wet kiss on the side of his mouth, his arms shaking slightly.
They’ve always been around, but still no one knows what they do with the people they take. No bodies, no bones. The tribes extend to the Plains, the Mountains, and the Seas. Traders come by every once in a while, and they all have the same information; the taken are never seen again.
“Could be.” Rufus puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder to keep him back when they come to a stop a bit of a ways from the door. “Don’t go rushing in on your own. You’ve gotta give them a chance to come out on their own first.”
To his surprise, he finds a few rudimentary tools have been collected and stored under the roots that make up part of the tent. Rocks and sticks are gathered with them, as if 1-M-7 were planning on attempting to make more. Castiel allows himself a smile now. There is no reason for him to be
“That’s not how it works Dean.” The angel walked alongside them, looking completely content and unperturbed by the apparent oven like quality of the environment. He still wore his full business attire, starkly contrasting the Winchesters haggard and minimal garb.
“Then why didn’t you show me before?” Dean ripped his gaze away from the angel’s wings, meeting his eyes.
Dean wove hastily through the bare trees scattered along the cliffside, rising steadily with each thud of his boots. His eyes roamed restlessly, taking in as much as they could in the half-second glances. He couldn’t risk being interrupted. His destination was set in front of him and he needed to reach it as soon as possible. He momentarily stared at the spot of interest, still several hundred feet ahead. It was an agonizing climb but it would be worth it if this worked out.
His feet are bare and fairly dirty. He will be given a good washing before he can be allowed into the enclosed environment of his new home. Castiel has yet to have the opportunity to view a full cleansing and he looks forward to being able to take notes of his own accord.
That doesn’t seem to bother him. Bill just keeps smiling, and he jerks a thumb over his shoulder at the door. “It’s a lot nicer out there, y’know? We have a big open field, and the bedrolls are really comfortable. They’re stuffed with fresh sweet grass. I bet you’d like that, hm? And we have big a pond to swim in. Do you like to swim?”
Puffing a small sigh, Dean sat back and took a small bite of an apple. He wasn’t hungry, especially after watching Castiel eat, but he wanted to occupy himself with

“Leaving in ten?” Sam asks over his shoulder and is already gone. Castiel follows him out of the kitchen, maybe he is already going to Baby, since the angel doesn’t need clothes or a bag anyway. Dean sighs loudly, he had thought that would be a quiet day, but apparently he would never have those again.
Once again, Dean’s stubbornness rears its ugly head. He doesn’t
“Happily,” She raised her hand, the lightning blooming into a full inferno, sparks and flames wrapping around her fingers. Dean waited, unmoving as words began to spill from her cracked lips. The spell shot towards him, straight towards his chest. Dean held his breath.
Cas shifted to wrap an arm around Dean’s waist, resting his head on the pillow, “Goodnight beloved, sweet dreams.” Dean hummed quietly before finally letting go and dozing off to sleep.
It was just… times like these that sucked more than others.

He sighed again, gently pulling the sheet completely over them. He stood thinking for a moment, fishing in his pockets among the vials until he finally found what he was looking for. Sam flipped open the lighter, watching as the flame sprung to life and danced in the moonlight, warming the cold atmosphere.
Of course the kingdom still needed to be ruled, the kingdom still needed their King. John Winchester returned to his throne, solemn but determined — he had a plan.
“Map.” The voice was clearly masculine, but there was a tiredness and fear in it that dragged his tone down to the level of gravel. “Map,” the man repeated.
The snow crunched softly under his feet as he scooched closer to Cas, using the cold as an excuse to draw nearer. His breath blew out in hot puffs, rising until it vanished over his head. Dean stopped when he bumped Cas’s shoulders, glancing to see where the angel’s eyes shimmered with starlight. There was so much knowledge in those eyes and wonder. He’d seen the universe itself form and yet Cas still stared at the world in admiration, like it was precious. Dean sighed as Cas looked on, turning his gaze to stare back up at the stars. His heart and mind calmed in the silence, a rare moment of peace.
“Nothing much. Just an old town. Not a lot of people there. And no one's traveled there in years.”
Dean waits, and he watches, and eventually he leans forward to knock on the wall again to get Cas’s attention. He doesn’t even get a twitch of an answer. Apparently he’s being
It was inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. Dean wanted to nod and agree but there was still one more thing. “Cas… you know I won’t live forever right?”
Dean can’t help but stare at them again. “Why’re you so dark?”
In a second, he grabs the knife from under his pillow, rolls onto his back, and kicks at the body adjacent to him. He hits something solid and shoots up, staring at the dark silhouette framed by the moonlight. The figure does not look the least phased and pounces on Cas before he can react. He cries out as the pair of them go tumbling off the bed and onto the floor, Cas’s knife knocked out of his hand. They both struggle, Cas punching and scratching as hard as he can. He manages to land a solid punch to the attacker’s face.
Dean trembled in the grip, craning his head back away from the creature as far as his position would allow.

“Dean the djinn got you. Sam and I got worried when you didn’t answer your phone and weren’t back at 2am, so we actually went to the bar and found your body outside, already sleeping.” Castiel explains and Dean’s eyes widen a bit.
Dean watched Cas blush. He was surprised to see that his wings also blushed, poofing up until Cas looked like a flustered ball of floof.
No, he can’t stop here. Dean grunts and pushes himself to keep going. Either the

He takes a long breath through his nose, letting the scents wash over him. There’s the salt of the brine, the tang of the creatures floating along and then—he jolts as a strong wave of fear hits him.
With great, heaving breaths, Dean throws the furs off and jumps to his feet. Both Ellen and Bill smile, but that quickly turns into surprise when he charges right for them. They jump out of the way and Bill falls back, right on his butt. Dean runs through the doorway, slapping the vines of ivy out of his face, and barrels straight into the stomach of another body. He stumbles back and looks up at him, eyes wide.
Once the sticks are sorted, Dean takes all the kindling to the piles they keep behind the camp and against the wall he once managed to escape over. They don’t like to keep kindling in the camp itself, because it’s a
Why was he so stupid? How could he miss that it was a wendigo he was hunting and not a werewolf. Stupid witness and stupid vampire that led him right into this mess. Now he is left with no choice.
Dean bites his lip and looks back to the pointy thing. “And… and what’s he gonna do with it?”
Victor and Rufus gather up a bunch of smaller bags into their arms. Dean watches them take those to the various jars around the campfire. He’s learned that’s where they keep seasonings, spices, and various vegetables and fruits that are used when they cook. Ellen stands up and follows them back, one little bag in her hands, and leaves the rest of the big bag to be gathered up by Dick. He slings it over his shoulder and starts walking towards the camp with it.

Castiel prodded at the corpse, leaning over it as he scrutinized the dead man. The angel didn’t answer but continued to squint as he removed the thin cloth and gingerly touched the gaping wound. Then he slowly opened it, revealing more of the innards.
Disappointingly, the kid doesn’t actually give Dean an answer. It closes its mouth and looks back down at the flat thing that it’s always holding, and it doesn’t say anything at all. Like a
He made his way towards it, keeping an eye on the tall surviving timber as he wove through the alleys. He glanced down at the charm on his wrist, the cool metal glinting. Sam was glad the magic seemed to be working, they had encountered no monsters so far besides the Uktena and he wasn’t really interested in wasting their time on simple matters. Who knew how long it would be before Cas was lost to them completely… how long until he could no longer discern friend from foe. Sam tried to chase the thought away. But Cas had almost
with a passion, he might say that the small one has really pretty wings. But he hates the kid anyway, so too bad. It just always stands there staring at him, or tapping at the flat thing in its hand, or uses a stick on it. And Dean’s patience with the small one is wearing very, very thin.
“I made so many mistakes Dean, but the best thing I ever did was to get you out of hell.” Fake-Castiel says and Dean’s eyes widen. He doesn’t remember anything from that day, besides crawling out of that hole, but Fake-Castiel looks earnest and that is, when Dean finally believes him. Fake-Castiel is his angel.
, actually, and it is no surprise that Castiel is utterly fascinated by the species.
They discuss their opinions and thoughts on the day and 1-M-7 as they head to the lift that will take them directly to the roof of the building. From there, they take off together, gliding down along the edge of the dome until they can break away and soar between the other rounded edges of the rest of the science sector. Since this side of the city is raised above the residential sector, they will be able to glide directly to the landing pad outside their unit.

“Okay,” Dean doesn’t question him. Instead, he gives him a nod then shoots off to search the reef. Although having awoken much more rested, Dean can’t help but feel tired again at the thought that he may be too late. But he’s not, he can’t be. He swims through the reef, yelling Sam’s name as he goes. There’s no response, making Dean’s panic rise.
freaky.
Dean turned and ran to the Flying Grounds without hesitation, cloak bellowing behind him as he wove through the castle’s many halls. He gathered his things quickly, strapping them to Impala’s saddle with the black wyvern helping drag his belongings to her side. When everything was set, Dean swung his leg over the saddle, gripping the pommel and fitting his feet into the stirrups. He took a long breath, bending forward and patting Impala’s neck, “Come on girl, let’s fly.”
Dean worries at his bottom lip, his grip on the fur going white-knuckled. He hopes they’re not here, wherever here is. Obviously the
“Ready?” Sam asked.
They still include his
anymore.
“Ready to let it go hot in here?” Rowena asks and there is this look again. Sam shudders under her gaze and then searches for his lighter. He has to save Dean first and maybe tomorrow he should think about… this.
Several tents built with woven fabrics and wood are clustered around a stone fire pit off to one side, close to the water’s edge. It is so
Dean turned towards the angel, concern suddenly imminent in his eyes, “Cas… you’re still resisting the spell…” Cas hesitantly met Dean’s gaze. A moment passed  in a silent exchange that caused a change in Dean's expression, his eyes flaring. “Why did you stop?! Cas you need my soul — use it!!” he exclaimed angrily, standing abruptly.
faster than the rest of them. But they’re all delicious. Most of them, Dean has never seen before. Luckily, though, most of the others have. They might not know them all, but they’ve seen some of them. Everyone from the sea tribe knew a lot of them. Apparently a lot of different gourds grow really well by the sea.
There is a room below where they stand on the bridge. Four simple walls with a pile of furs against one wall. The Aetherian from the preparation room enters through a door and places 1-M-7 in the pile of furs. She takes a moment to arrange him comfortably before leaving the room. It isn’t very big and Castiel is certain he would not be able to spread his wings fully in the space.
with him, but they’re somewhere else?
Dean’s family is only the four of them, biggest all of his parents’ parents died before he was born. Their tree still has a couple layers carved out from generations before them. There are handholds cut into the inside of the tree to climb up and down between the levels. But there’s only the main level that has a walkway built around it.
He was content to let Dean sleep, feeling his breath, hearing his heartbeat as the angel lay basking in the pleasant silence, Dean's soul singing a melody that placated his grace. It was a rare thing, one Cas had only begun experiencing in the past decade of his millions of years. Whenever Dean was near, his mind was brought to rest, anxiety calmed in the presence of such a bright and beautiful soul. If only he had known at the start why it was so.
He finishes counting, snapping the satchel shut. This should last him and Sam three days, maybe four if they stretch it out. He’d been trying to catch as much as he could for the both of them as they wander the ocean, to let Sam rest and heal. His stupid dork of a brother had injured his shoulder in a run-in with a group of extremely territorial tiger sharks. It’d been a scary situation at the time, causing Dean to jump in and fight off two while Sam took on the one. They’d both earned some more scars that day, but now, they could laugh about it.
Dean actually feels a little bad for her. May has absolutely no idea what it’s like to live on the outside. She always just stares at him blankly whenever he tries to explain how much
Really. It was just a thing he noticed.
Dean slowly felt Cas’s presence ebb back into his consciousness, the soft touch of it a comfort that settled warmly against his soul.
“What are they?”
“I know,” the angel huffed, “Please, I want to feel every bit of you.” Cas placed a shaky hand on Dean’s cheek. Dean looked up to meet Cas’s shining gaze. The smile on his face was light, free of any weight it previously held. No hard wrinkles or sad eyes, just happiness. Dean could not have been more grateful to be the reason for that smile.
To be honest, Dean kind of likes Rowena. She doesn’t take Dick’s pompous attitude, and sasses him right back. Some of the more amusing things are when they get into an argument. Dean isn’t always present for that, but it’s fun to see when he is. He likes that she doesn’t expect anything of him either. Ellen, Bill, and the others keep trying to get him to interact with them. Sometimes he has a question, sometimes he just sits in silence while doing his own thing. Rowena just talks at him.
for him? Just weird.
a thought.
“What’s your name?”
1-M-7 gets scrubbed from head to toe with clinical precision using a disinfecting soap and a cloth. His hair is washed with an anti-bacterial solution. In the midst of being washed off, Castiel notes a change in the room and promptly locates his mother’s

At least it is not an entire waste of time. Castiel still gets to visit the
.” The words feel weird on his tongue, despite how often he has practiced them.
Now he needs to hide too, but he can’t be near Sam. If Dean hides too close to him, they might be able to find him too, and that’s not allowed. Dean needs to protect him, by getting away from him.
Ahhh at last! This is where the main storyline for this fic ends. Though there will be an epilogue to tie things up and answer a question or two (and give y'all some sweet smut ;) ) it may take a little longer than my usual weekly updates to post it due to school obligations :/ but I will try and get it done asap! But thank you guys for sticking with the story this long! <3 Thank you everyone who commented and encouraged me and enjoyed one of my first big fic projects! It was an exciting journey and I definitely plan on doing something like this again :)

And, to prove it, she lifts her arm to show the hair there. But Dean already knew about that. He’s seen all the grownups here naked more than once, same with everyone back home, and they all have hair in those places. Some of the men are hairier than others, and some grow beards better than others. Dean can’t wait until he can grow a beard of his own. His

There is no hunting here, since the mammals that make it worthwhile are kept in a separate part of the facility, but fishing is still a possibility. It is absurdly easy to breed different subclasses of
, in particular, required assistance. It grew taller than 1-M-7 could reach, and Castiel suspects that he has never encountered it before. He appeared to not know how to use it. The members of the Plains tribe, 1-M-1 and 1-M-3, showed him how to both harvest it, cook it, grind it into flour to make cakes fried on hot stones over the fire, or used in making a number of different dishes. Since then, 1-M-7 has made it a point to prepare the majority of his own food.
“Don’t forget Rowena. She’s from that tribe too.” Bill nods towards the tent behind Dick. Dean looks over as the woman with red hair crawls out.
Cas pushed back slightly, looking Dean straight in the eye. His gaze was hard and calculating, like jaded sapphire. But then, it softened. A brief, relieved smile decorated his face as he stared into Dean’s soul. He glanced down, moving forward hesitantly until Dean could feel the breath on his lips. Cas glanced up, catching Dean’s eye. Dean couldn’t move, captivated. Not moving forward, not moving back, just waiting. Then, the angel moved forward, pressing his lips against Dean’s.
to him now that he’s not as big a pain in the ass, or that he hasn’t tried to escape in a while. He can’t, even if he wants to. He needs to be stronger before he can attempt it, so he’s been working out a lot. Pushing himself to get better, all so he can get out of this place.
Her stare was hungry, predatory and it was fixed on Dean. Sam’s grip tightened on his arm, his back straightening as he stepped in front of Dean, a protective fire in his eyes.
between their tribes. They are a
Instead of making a face at him like Dean really, really wants to, he chooses to duck behind the tree and wait until Dick moves on. He can hear Bill’s voice call out to Dick, but the words don’t make it all the way across the field. When Dean peeks out from behind the tree, Dick has left the bag in the middle of camp and is ducking into a tent. As far as he knows, no one actually sleeps in that tent. Dean hasn’t looked in it himself to see what’s in there yet.
Dean’s throat was dry and he just shook his head. “You can’t ask that of me… you can’t ask me to do that to you.”
Dean’s stomach turns uncomfortably and he feels like he’s going to be sick. He covers his nose and mouth with his hands. “That – that’s
“It means this is getting out of hand. What if he hurts you again, or kills you —”
“So this
Dean scoffed, “Well you hadn’t seemed very keen on it in the past. Thought you wanted to take things slow.”
“Shit. Okay, okay.” The employee quickly turned to unzip his backpack with trembling hands and withdrew a crumpled sheet of paper. He unfolded it and showed it to the man.
Dean returned his attention to the land again, refocusing on the powdered woodland. When he had finally relaxed again the sour taste grew louder. Dean’s brow furrowed as he glanced at Cas again. The angel’s face was harder than usual, jaw clenched and eyes narrowed in thought. Sighing Dean turned to him, “Everything good Cas?”

murmuring to each other on the level above him in their family tree.
“Thank you Dean for driving us here, how noble of you.” Castiel says, when Dean parks Baby in the parking lot of a motel. Dean looks into the rearview mirror and glares at the angel. Castiel doesn’t seem impressed and glares back.
“Why are you here, Human? I did not call you.” The being growled, lips peeling back from ivory-white teeth until two needle-like fangs slipped down from the roof of his mouth, fat drops of liquid pooling at the tips.
“But it’s not enough,” Dean whined, “I want to show you like you showed me, I want to make up for all the times I didn’t and when I was a dick and when I kicked you out and —”
brushes harshly against his own.
Not to mention that he’s had a long time to think about the last time he tried to run away after the test. Dean has realized now that the passageways are really long, and he has no idea how to open the doors if the

that Cas is back?
That little snake had nothing on this thing moving in front of him. Castiel was pure power and muscle, as quick as he was terrifying. Dean had no doubt in his mind that the creature could make good on his threat.
“Who is asking?” Stark asks and he already looks as if he doesn’t trust them. Dean gets out his fake badge before the guy can blink and nearly shoves it in his face. Sam is probably pulling another bitch face as he shows his as well, but Dean focuses on Castiel. Just in case Castiel holds his one the wrong way around. Again.
The angel leaned in closer, hovering over the hunter with wings extended and eyes and mouth aglow. Dean couldn't rip his gaze from him, that mesmerizing, tumultuous swirl of grace and power pouring down to devour him.
After a moment of observation for herself, approval tingles across his halo.
The voice made Sam stop in his tracks, eyes wide. He couldn’t see it’s source but the only place he could stare was at Cas. “
don’t open them for him.
Now there was just still air.
To his surprise, warmth puddles behind his ribs, his heart softening against his better judgment. How Dean breaks down his walls, Cas hesitates to think but for now, he knows what he wants. He sighs heavily, letting himself test the feeling of being vulnerable. “Perhaps,” he starts slowly, “Just this once, you can stay with me tonight.” Dean’s eyes widen and his mouth parts with awed surprise. Cas swallows and continues, “Today’s activities have worn me thin and I don’t see any harm in having a guardian angel to help me sleep.”
He began describing what had happened in a soft voice. Sam didn’t talk, just listening as he applied the oil. Dean started with the memory in the church then to the mirror, pausing when he got to Cas stepping out of the water. Sam didn’t push, just waiting for him to continue.

Rowena always tells him that he should ignore Dick, so he does his best to do just that. It doesn’t stop Dick from ranting at him as he heads through the trees, or from following him almost all the way to camp. Dean really does try and ignore it, though, but he’s just so
and Cas head over to the shelf. Cas is still poking at the flat thing in his hands, looking up every so often at whatever it is that Big keeps gesturing at on the shelf. Sometimes Big picks something up and shows it to Cas. Why doesn’t Cas already know what everything is? Has he never been in this room before? Is he here to
Dean tried to hide his shock but failed badly, “Oh! Well then I guess this was an exciting surprise.” He tried to give a friendly smile. Impala growled from behind him again. “Shut your face,” he muttered over his shoulder. “I’m here with serious business,” he straightened himself and cleared his throat.
1-M-7 is a very…
She looks down at him, her eyebrows drawn together. “But he…”
With that, the
“She better not mess with baby. If we get back and she’s all scratched up I’m gonna be pissed.”
Sweat beaded on his forehead, clinging to the canopy of his sun-bleached brows. Dean shifted in the jumble of blankets, kicking them off to the foot of the bed. The bed groaned protests every time he turned or wiggled. He’d stripped down to his boxers in his sleep, t-shirt cast over the side of the bed to the blue and orange rub below.
“I have a new case.” Sam says and he sits down at the table with his laptop. Dean starts the coffee machine, because he for sure would need some now. Bacon alone doesn’t cut it anymore. Sam seems to wait patiently for Dean to focus on him, so after he put some heavenly smelling bacon in the pan, he turns to Sam.
Something was here because something was living in this section of the island. The dip at the base of the hill had been worn down deep into a shallow bowl, sand gathered inside, larger and wider than he was tall. Crude clay covered pots lined stacked underneath a small lean-to made up of stripped, worn branches, shining with a layer of glistening oil.
While it is not considered a desirable career, Aetherians do have artists. The Science District of

It only grew deeper with each thunderclap. He didn't want it to end this way. Cas was afraid and he was afraid. He could feel the connection, this bond that intertwined their very being, grace and soul.
The Magician shook himself and nodded, “O-of course. Well then I guess I should introduce myself as well. I am Castiel, youngest and current White Magician — as the title goes.”
He is an
Dean laughs at his own joke. He brushes his hand against the smooth crystal, admiring how the light reflects off his claws. It almost matches his eyes, Dean thinks. He reluctantly turns away from it.
Dean’s voice faded briefly, “
A laugh huffs against his neck as he tries to turn his head. “Nice try, hunter. You’re all mine now.” Castiel’s eyes widen as he sees Daniel’s fangs slide out with a hiss. As the vampire closes in he throws his head back to knock his jaw, but Daniel veers away, switching his hold to grasp Cas’s wrists with one hand and hold Cas’s head down with the other.
“I guess we'll have to find out.”
“I didn’t…I don’t…Sh-shit you can speak English?” It wasn’t at all what Dean wanted to say, but that’s what he managed to get out.

Dean pushes past an older man who doesn’t look that old in the face, but he has thick gray hair curling over his ears. He sprints across the field, feet bare and the ground nothing more than soft grass and dirt under him. Normally he would be crunching over leaves, and twigs, and there would be various rocks around. Nothing is ever
Cas lowered his eyes, lashes blinking against his flushed cheeks as he easily took Dean in to the base, the bonus of being an angel with no gag reflex. He began to suck and lick, twisting his tongue around and tasting Dean as eagerly as before. Dean couldn’t hold back his moans, with each slide of tongue another noise was dragged from his throat and his head lolled back in the bliss. Then Cas swallowed and Dean cried out, the angel’s name spilling from his lips. “Cas, fuck!”
At the center of the ceiling is a big hole where sunlight is streaming through. Unlike the other room, this one is very green. Grass goes from corner to corner, and a small pond takes up one of those corners. Reeds and lily pads fill it. Moss and vines are crawling up three of the walls, but one of them is empty. It looks a little different, but he doesn’t know
He checks the time on his phone and slowly starts walking towards his car.
Charlie and Gilda have been together for years. They started dating in college but took jobs in different cities and despite their best efforts could not find a way to move closer again. It has caused Charlie a lot of hard break over the years and not seldom did she talk about quitting her job, finding one in a different field and moving across the country to be close to her girlfriend again.
“Thank you,” his voice cracks as he tries to hold back just how grateful he feels. No one but Sam has done something so kind for him. To Castiel, Dean is a stranger and still, he’s doing this for him.
The black dirt under his feet crunched as he finally approached the entrance. The door was roughly intact as he pushed through the wooden mess at his feet. The inside of the building seemed to have survived the worst of the fire, furniture was still recognizable and Sam quickly busied himself shifting through them. Box after box he looked through until he finally noticed a tall cabinet at the end of the large room. Small vials and glasses filled with liquids and plants of some sort lined the shelves, Sam immediately perked up.
, but they are looked down upon and mocked relentlessly for their views. His mother is one such person who speaks of them with disdain, and he does not wish to bring that upon himself.
Impala brushed her tail across the floor as she continued to stare up to the top of the stairs, where the blue glow emanated. She narrowed her eyes, rising to her feet and walking in a small circle as she observed the tall spiral.
has gone out during the season.
specimens do is not considered a priority. Those who express interest in the emotional well being of this specific species get labeled as Sapien Sympathizers, and that small subgroup of Aetherian society is mentioned quite often in Castiel’s new lessons – with no small amount of disdain.
This aggravated her more, her lip curling, “That book had hundreds of years worth of magic! Do you know how much knowledge you’ve just destroyed?!”
“And we saved the day! Drinks for everyone.” Rowena says loudly and claps her hands. Sam follows her to the little fridge, while Dean still looks at Castiel. Finally Castiel seems to register that and looks back.
Jo makes a quiet noise where she’s clinging to Ellen, staring up at the big
are a very social species and it is unlikely that a child would have stayed away from them for very long. But now 1-M-7 is more distraught then before, and Castiel feels…
Dean can tell that everyone else is listening in now. They’re all paying attention, because they all want to get to know him. He knows that they just want to make him feel comfortable here. His mind understands that, but his mouth doesn’t want to listen. And it’s more than that, really. They want to accept him into their tribe, but they can’t really do that without a name, can they?
“Are you finally going to sleep now?”
means, because Dean gives him his confused face again. Seriously, the kid needs to stop using big words that Dean doesn’t know.
He had to suck in a deep breath to keep from throwing the damn phone across the kitchen. “I had one beer, Sam. I swear. Don’t fuckin’ compare me to Dad. I’m not Dad, dammit!”
Once the washing is done, the Aetherian uses a blow dryer and a towel. That two ends up in the recycler when finished. Castiel has documented the whole process down to the last detail, and has made notes to ask which machines were used, and what all the others in the room are for. Which ones are used should the specimen be in poor health? Or disabled? Or worse…
In a flash, long teeth sank into the flesh of his left deltoid. Sam yelled, clawing at the wendigo’s face. It swiped his hand aside and bit down again. Sam couldn’t help the cry that was  ripped from his throat, arching his back off the floor and slamming his fist into the floorboards. He heard a small clunk as his hand hit the floor. Glancing over, he saw the torch, mere centimeters from his hand. Reaching for it, he wrapped his hand around it and swung it over, smashing it into the wendigo’s head. The creature released him, stumbling to the side, but still hovering over him. It quickly recovered, turning to hiss at him and leap for his throat. Sam reversed his grip, taking the sharp unlit end of the torch and driving it upwards. It sank into the wendigo’s eye socket, spurting a mess of red as it’s roar turned shrill.
Not that aimlessly walking around a party is not awkward, but he doubts Castiel even remembers his name, so he quickly lets go of the idea of joining him and his friends.
People by the fireplace.
He opens the glass door, steps outside, and walks towards the bench the two of them are occupying.
Lost in thought again he nearly trips over his own feet moving away from the others.
He's not going in there.
He overheard Meg complaining about Cas's notorious studying and how he never had time for his friends anymore.
He looks at Dean with wide eyes, before dropping his gaze to his feet.
Will he die in this world of screams and fire and smoke?
"Alright. Talk."
"I'm sorry this is no excuse and of course you don't care about why I broke into your apartment and we don't really no each other and ..."
"What's wrong?" Cas asks in what is probably an attempt to whisper and reaches up to poke Dean's cheek. He lets out a delighted chuckle when the soft flesh gives in and turns white under his touch.
Maybe this was supposed to be an easy let down.
"I'm sorry," he blurts out and Dean's eyebrows rise in astonishment and Cas' blanks.
Cas is distantly aware that he’s blatantly invading Dean’s personal space but the other boy is not moving away.
He has been wanting to say these words to Cas for a long time, but he was never brave enough to do so.
He was loading the dishwasher now, punctuating each word by shoving glasses into the machine like they had personally offended him.
"I still don't get why you're forcing me to be here. It's not even the actual party, so I am even more out of place than I would have been otherwise," he complains and looks around, expecting someone to object his presence. He kinda hopes for the excuse to leave. So far he has not seen Castiel, so if he gets away now, there could still be a chance of surviving the afternoon without making a fool of himself.
"Heya Cas, where did you leave the inseparable dream team?"
Great. Just perfect. How on earth is he supposed to come up with a gift?
The two of them line up to receive their names in silence and Dean waits for the  inevitable question of what the hell he's doing here to come up. He has worked with Castiel before, but that consisted mostly of him either getting caught staring or being incredibly clumsy and distracted. Dean sincerely does not want to know what Cas thinks of him, because however the man sees him, it can't be all that flattering.
They could hear the soft trickle of water getting louder as they trailed through the almost labyrinthine gardens. Dean and Sam had lost so many tutors running around these paths. Still, he listened carefully as they rounded the corner so he could hear Clarence’s inevitable gasp of surprise when he saw it. Dean was not disappointed.
His knees hit the mud and he topples over, loosing consciousness before he even hits the ground.
There's a notebook on the floor beside Cas' usual desk when he enters the library. Its light brown leather blends in perfectly with the dirty beige of the floor, so he doesn't notice it until he slumps down on his favorite seat in the corner of the room and unceremoniously drops his bag on the ground right next to it.
"We haven't worked together in quite a while now," Castiel comments as if he's heard Dean's thoughts and he can feel the blush creeping up his cheeks. It's Christmas time so the shop is jam packed every day, but Dean has specifically asked Charlie not to pair him with Castiel whenever he worked. Cas is a great guy and if Dean wasn't crushing on him like there's no tomorrow, he would probably want to be this guy's friend just as desperately, which is the most secure way to behave like an idiot, try too hard and embarrass yourself.
"I uhm," the words get stuck in his throat, so he clears it and tries again, desperately hoping that he does not look like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar,
The man brows furrow in confusion and he tilts his head to the side, squinting at Dean.
"Could've fooled me," he says and his voice sounds flat, "No really, Cas, good one. I totally believed you for a second."
Normally Castiel has no interest in such gatherings, but most of his friends are going too and he does not want to celebrate the New Year with his parents - as much as he loves them.
"You're disgusting, I don't know why I like you."
He hears Dean screaming for a medic, but the sound is distant and muffled like Cas is floating under water.
"What got you looking so grumpy, hot shot? Trouble in paradise?"
Now it was Deans turn to roll his eyes.
His gaze moves up and he finds Dean's eyes already trained on himself.
He is rewarded with a blush that has his smile growing even wider.
Once he's done he sets down the steaming cup on the table and slides on the bench across from the man.
They are going to spend at least the next three hours in the car together.
He doesn’t look at Cas, just stares at his feet, shoulders hunched like he’s waiting for Cas to start laughing, to hurt him.
Below the surface, where there is nothing but undisturbed peace and quiet.
And yet somehow, he can't.
Of course this is neither the time nor the place to ask, so he pushes his curiosity aside.
The mixtape is dark against the brightness of the snow and now that he's looking at his own scratchy handwriting it seems like a very childish idea.
Dean swallows harshly and Cas doesn't even dare protest the fact that Dean thinks his pain is an inconvenience, afraid the other man might stop talking entirely.
He internally debates whether lurking at the door or wandering aimlessly through the crowd will make him look less pathetic and is seriously entertaining the thought of returning home, when his gaze is met by piercing green eyes.
Cas is practically
Sam sighed, dragging a hand across his short stubble. “What do you think?”
child nods. Hah! Now Dean’s got him. He grins, big and bright. “Then tell me your name first.”
“Yes.”
The island haunts Dean's dreams, coaxing him back. He knows it's a bad idea, but when has he ever listened to that little voice in his head warning him away?
He stopped half way out the door, an odd shape passing over his peripheral vision. The hair on his neck pricked up as he took a slow step back. Sam was surprised he hadn’t seen it as soon as he entered the building, a dirty canvas draped over an odd lump in the far corner. Red stained the cloth — and a small hand could be seen protruding from under the sheet. Fuck.
She’s wearing soft moccasins, and her long tunic is covered in sparkling beads and dyed threads. In Dean’s tribe, they only decorate the important clothing they wear for ceremonies. They don’t have all the supplies needed to decorate

Mechanically, Dean nodded, too afraid of his traitorous tongue to speak. As soon as Castiel’s tail withdrew away from him, opening a path in the long loop of his body, Dean bolted.
With one knee dealt with, Rufus starts to tend to a scrape down his shin on the other leg. Dean takes his words and rolls them over in his mind. He tilts his head back and stares up at the clear blue sky. A type of bird he doesn’t recognize is flying overhead, a bit above where a few
Naomi’s thoughts turn colder, harder.
The Aetherian carefully turns 1-M-7 onto his stomach and removes a pointed tool from the collection hanging from the ceiling. She tugs the collar of the tunic down away from his neck and presses the tip of the device to his skin. It moves back and forth, but her hand and the tool itself block the view to see what is truly happening. He has a feeling he knows what she is doing, but he would like a confirmation rather than to simply assume.
. Why hasn’t Cas showed up yet? Where the heck is he?
. She’s just taller than him for now. Rowena is sure that Dean has another growth spurt coming, and he sure hopes so. May gloats every time she looks down at him, even though she’s not
“How are you gonna wear that?” he mumbled, “Or are you gonna Hugh Jackman this and go shirtless?”
Mother raises an eyebrow at him as she picks up her PADD.
“It’s just how I am.”
Finally, a new message pops up.
“No, whatever Dean. Go fucking fish with a beer in your hand. End up just like Dad.” Sam snapped, and the line went silent.
that caught him.
“You can come out from under there, y’know.”
“You are not real. I mean look, I have everything that I wanted.” Dean says and he seems surprised by his own words. Castiel wishes the blush on Dean’s cheeks was reserved for him, but then he sees the dark smile of Lisa. It really is Morpheus doing all this.
His stomach gives an aching gurgle and Dean closes his eyes, trying not to think about it. He rolls onto his side, and then onto his stomach. It brings him a lot closer to the pond of water that takes up a front corner of the room. Dean groans and shuffles around until he can crawl the rest of the way. The water is clear and the surface shimmers in the sun.
There’s a moment of silence before the vines part again. This time a man leans in. He has a blond beard and blond hair, tied back and kept out of his face by a braid that hangs over his shoulder. Dean isn’t used to seeing men with long hair. Even the women of his tribe tend to keep it shorter, or tied back all the time. It just gets in the way, and twigs and branches catch on it when you’re in a hurry and not looking where you’re going.
“Yeah,” Sam grinned, “cause he can kick your ass.”
to talk about them, or him, that way.
“Not anytime soon. You need to heal before we look for something.” Castiel says, but he is smiling so beautifully that Dean feels himself nodding. Dean was never good to admit a weakness, but he kinda likes to be cared for. He never had that, just when he was really young. After the fire he was always the one to take care of people.
A large strip of skin, running from his right hip, up and around to his left shoulder blade was a horrible, blistered mess. The burned skin was as wide as his forearm, the red sections of it where all the skin had peeled off bleed painlessly, while the rest was covered in a white, waxy substance that Dean knew to be severely damaged skin — it looked like he had gotten whipped by a fucking Balrog. Seeing the wound seemed to remind his body that it was supposed to hurt like hell. The adrenaline chose at that moment to wear off and the heat hit him like a brick wall. Dean gasped as his knees went weak and his arms shook. He tried to pull his shirt the rest of the way off, but his left shoulder screamed at him.
will sit him down and teach him the history of their village. Dean knows all about how their tribe split from the other tribe on the edge of the great flatlands, and how that tribe had left the one at the base of the mountain on the far edges of the forest. There was even a group of people from Dean’s tribe that packed up and left a long, long time ago to go live by the big waters.
Another thermos of coffee and a half a sandwich later, Dean started the process of hauling up the first line. It was slow going, and technically he was sure he was breaking about fifteen different laws, but no one was out here to call him on it either.
sure didn’t have a problem with taking him from his family and locking him up. None of them – child or not – is allowed to be
“There’s another one.” Donatello brings Dean’s attention back down. The band passed from Dean’s left to his right, and Donatello points in the direction behind him. “It comes from that direction and it’s exactly the same. Passes right over head, and –” He makes a whooshing sound and arcs his arm around to point in the direction Dean is facing in. “- goes down over there. It passes by late at night, and you only notice because it blots out the stars.”
“It’s okay Dean,” Cas soothed a hand down his thigh, “We don’t have to do that now. Whenever you’re ready.” The angel played absently  with the hair curling up to his navel, tickling slightly. “But if you don’t want that then can I ride you?”
“No.” Dean shrugs and rolls his shoulders. He’s young, but even kids get stiff after doing the same motions over and over again.
John frowned, “I don’t… but it is our only hope. We can only ask for a miracle.”
because of them, he’s gonna be
Dean hated everything about this. It all felt wrong and twisted. The feeling of being watched was still blaring in the back of his mind, and “Cas” wasn’t sounding like Cas. Dean already knew, he was in deep shit.
if his mother will not allow him to speak with 1-M-7 or any of the other specimens?
He doesn’t get an answer. Instead, Cas looks down at the flat thing in his hand. Dean has always hated when he does that, because it’s like Cas is ignoring him, and Dean
What he

Dean is pleading and he knows and hates it. He prays that he hasn’t just made the biggest mistake of his life. Helping a cecaelia—he’s been warned of them, and yet he still didn’t take the hint.
“Supai. Some ghost town out in the middle of nowhere.”
is why I’ve been hesitant… I… I want you to fully enjoy it, to not be burdened. Love should be a sweet release not an act of desperation. Now that we have that time, I don’t want to rush this, as you said,” Cas spoke quieter, his shoulders sagging, “I didn’t realize my negligence would cause you further worry.”
“Exactly. Met him once, kind of an asshole if you ask me. Anyway normally he just gives people some dreams you know, wakes them up after he feeds off of them and looks for the next victim. Since like now he doesn’t really care anymore and takes what he can get.” Gabriel explains and Sam strokes through his long hair. That doesn’t sound good.
Careful to not disturb anything around him and give away where he’s hiding, Dean stands up on his branch and rises up onto the tips of his toes. The see-through bridge that the
“Hey darling, are you all alone here?”
Reluctantly Dean pulled out. After that they didn’t move for a while. Dean relaxed and closed his eyes, breathing against Cas’s skin. The angel brushed his arms with an impossibly soft touch that eased the tension in his shoulders, making him sink further into the cushion of Cas’s chest. Cas continued to brush his arms with what seemed like the softest blanket Dean had ever felt. It took a minute for his brain to realize that Cas’s hands were also in his hair. He frowned, mind slowly processing before he lifted his head.
The dread was fully setting in now, her words echoing in his head. No, no, no, this couldn’t be how he ends! Maybe Hell or Purgatory or nothing! — but not fuel for a power hungry monster. No! He was fine with all other fates but this.
In the time that 1-M-7 has been in their care, he has lost a significant amount of weight. They have not given him a check up since he was last brought in, and he is not due for another until he has been here for a whole sol cycle. Visually, however, it is quite obvious. Perhaps Castiel watches 1-M-7 closer than his mother or her coworkers, but he sincerely doubts that anyone has failed to notice that he has thinned out, or that deep bruises have formed under his eyes.
“It was just…” Dean starts but he doesn’t know how he could end the sentence. He is embarrassed, because of course Castiel never wanted him like that, but then Castiel takes Dean’s hand in his, interlacing their fingers and Dean looks back to Castiel’s eyes and somehow then to his lips.
Dean is dead.
Blinking away the slight wetness in his eyes Dean reached out and cupped Cas’s face with both hands. “I love you, you know that?”
has dark skin like Victor and Rufus. Dean isn’t surprised. He’s looked at a lot of
But... He doesn’t want more freckles. They’re not that far from the village; Dean can see the walkways spanning between the massive trees from here. Maybe he should go back and get something? Ugh, but that would mean having to climb up the ladder, because no one will use the canoe-lift to bring up
“Not happening.” Dean turns around again, arms crossed. “
On the backside of the tree closest to the wall, Castiel takes note of another braided rope of vines dangling between the branches. Curious, he walks over and gives the rope a light tug. It appears to be secured up in the tree. 1-M-7 must have climbed the tree and used this rope to bring his supplies up with him. Castiel doubts that he would have been able to carry the thick rope easily on his own. But… How many more supplies does 1-M-7 have? Did he bring food with him? What is the rest of his escape plan?
He’d received a good tip from one of the local salts last night about one of their fish finders picking up a big school out near the Island a few miles offshore, but that was an area where most locals stuck to their P’s and Q’s. Too many good boats had run up on the jagged rocks lining a good portion of the shore, and there were rumors of waters able to tug you into the Island’s grasp. A number of people had died a few decades ago, and when the body count began to climb the locals took notice and steered clear, good fishing be damned.
“What do you need from me?” Cas had stepped closer to the table and was gazing down at her vessel.
“Unfortunately for you, we know Castiel, he’s - he was - a rather good friend of ours actually. So, I’ll ask you again, and this time don’t lie or else you’ll find yourself full of bullets. Who are you?” Sam glared at the woman expectantly. She looked confused.
“I’m sorry that my current state makes you uncomfortable Dean.” Cas said. Her stare pierced through him like it always did, despite her eyes being brown instead of blue.
“Don’t be ridiculous. We’re brothers. There’s no way we could pass as a couple convincingly.”
“I wish to be free. I don’t want to live like this anymore, tied to machines, unable to pass on, but unable to live either. I know that I should be gone, can be gone if I let myself, but I knew, somehow, that I should wait a little longer. Now I know why. It was for you, the wounded angel. You can take my body, just please, free my soul.” She said all this with such conviction that it was clear to Castiel that she did not know what she was asking him to do.
“Can I help you?” She asked suspiciously.
There was a man sitting in the middle of the floor chanting. As they watched, Thirza Byrne’s spirit took form, rising up from the floor. The blackthorn branch was clutched in the man’s right hand and the other was holding a bloody knife. He turned to look at the men standing on guard in the doorway.
“Don’t take another step.” Said Dean. His voice held the promise of violence should she choose to ignore him. She blinked at them, apparently startled by their reactions, then stopped coming towards them.
“There wasn’t much about that actually,” Dean said, not entirely truthfully. “It just said she died. What happened?”
“Yes, Hi Miss Green. I’m Dean Ulrich and this is Cas Hetfield. We’re reporters hoping to do a piece on your family history. We only have a few questions; it wouldn’t take much time.” Dean gave her a winning smile, the one he used to get into places he shouldn’t be. The woman sighed and stepped aside.
“Rowena, it’s Dean.” He said after the beep, “We’ve got a situation with Cas. We could use your help. Call me back.” Dean wasn’t sure what else to say. The situation was pretty weird and he figured it might be best for Rowena to just come see it in person. He hung up.
It had to be about the vessel. That was the only logical explanation. That didn’t make Dean feel much better, the idea that he had been treating Castiel, angel of the lord, like a girl; well she was a girl now, so like she couldn’t handle herself then. The whole thing made Dean feel like an asshole. And then, right when Cas had called him out, he’d kissed her, pretty much just proving her point. Shit. SHIT. He needed to talk to her; tell her he was being an idiot. His phone rang.
Cas is merely a substitute for Charlie.
"You did this on purposes," he grits out and points an accusatory finger at her.
Why does he always have to fuck things up?
Cas looks crestfallen and Dean feels awful.
It was an offense to all the hard work Cas had put into his own costume and the fact that besides him no one at the party had made even the resemblance of an effort successfully killed the sad remainders of his excitement.
Whoever it belongs to is as broken as the notebook's spine.
That's what he's trying to say.
She slams her palm against her sweaty forehead, but immediately draws back when she remembers its state. Momentarily distracted she looks down on her hand in disgust, before rubbing it against her pants.
"Nice costume, Winchester. Glad to see that some people still make an effort on Halloween," she turns to glare at Ash, who shrugs and pops a marshmallow into his mouth.
Technically, he could still watch the horror movies and stuff his face with food but doing it alone seems pretty pathetic in light of his actual plans.
If Dean has finally decided that he never should have started hanging out with the weird kid that did not know how to throw a ball, but knew most parts of the bible by heart at the age of seven.
His face is stoic and emotionless.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you! You're the best friend in the world," Charlie squeals.
All of his friends have entirely different tastes in snacks and he tries to be considerate as to make everyone feel comfortable.
It's low and pleading and almost inaudible against the rage of war around them, but all of sudden every word is crystal clear to Cas.
Cas finally manages to open the door and goes inside, and Dean thinks that is it when Cas looks at him again.
"My queen, I am here to humbly receive the name of whoever it is I have to make happy."
He prays Dean will believe him.
People sitting around a giant table that would fill up half of Castiel's childhood bedroom.
She sighs and Cas can practically see her fiddling with the sleeves of her shirt.
"I'm sorry," he repeats, "this is not about me and we are going to talk about this like adults, because even though I don't do it as often as I should, I can act like one. But please, Cas, don't make me do it right now. I just … I need a moment, okay?"
He should have known. Cooking has never been his strong suit and now he curses himself for not ordering in.
She glances at her watch and claps her hands together.
"We could throw him a "It's probably not your birthday"-party", " she announced excitedly, "Invite a couple of friends, get him some gifts, pie - of course - and just dedicate one random day to him. So what if we don't know his actual birthday? We can still celebrate him, right?"
Swallowing down his unease, Cas follows Dean inside.
Belatedly he realizes that he is staring, so he clears his throat, wills the blush away he can feel coloring his cheeks and forces his voice into use.
He sees Dean's sheepish expression and realizes how his words must come across.
Cas takes a step back, twisting his fingers together.
His job may not be all that exciting, but when his boss is not stressing him out, he quite enjoys being at work. He gets along with all of his coworkers and on slow days like today he's essentially being paid to hang out with his friends.
A glance at his watch tells him that Dean will be home soon.
The door to the library opens and a group of students walks in, talking animatedly.
"Oh my god, really?," Meg groans, "we've been stood up for ages, because of a 'lack of resources' when it takes five minutes to fix this?! God, I hate this company."
He is staring intently at his feet, purposely not making eye contact.
Because he had come out of the closet and the world hadn't ended.
She smiled warmly at Cas, willing him to believe her.
"Deep breaths," Charlie said way too calmly beside him.
The sentiment was gone as soon as Balthazar opened the door and almost died laughing when he saw Castiel.
Cas' plans for the evening actually consisted of doing his laundry and vacuuming his apartment, but that's so lame, he wouldn't even admit it in front of Charlie, let alone Dean.
The buzz of his phone brings Cas back to the present and he places the bowl of popcorn on the table in front of the couch to look at it.
Why had he ever thought this was a good idea? This was it. Dean was going to break up with him.
Dean takes a deep breath and glances at the ceiling, blinking rapidly, before meeting Cas' eyes again.
He turns the notebook over in his hands, knowing that he's stalling.
He doesn't want to know how long Dean has been dealing with all this pent up anxiety on his own when he blurts it out to a practical stranger.
He could feel it in his bones.
Maybe that's not it.
They barely know each other and no matter how connected he feels to Dean, especially since discovering the notebook, the other boy does not share the sentiment.
Dean glances pointedly at Marv, who is currently chatting with Lisa, who doesn't quite succeed in hiding her ennui.
The cool air makes Cas shiver, but he is grateful to have escaped the overheated living room. He's even more grateful when Dean steps closer to rub his arms in an attempt to keep him warm.
Sam was sitting on the couch next to Eileen, and he was constantly shooting knowing smiles in Cas' direction that were freaking him out, because they obviously meant that Sam knew how Dean would react to this (which was badly, of course, since Cas had overstepped his boundaries and everything was going to burn).
“But what about your angel?,” Cas asks before he can stop himself.
Instead of answering Dean reached for Cas' hand, pulling him into a hug and pressed a kiss to his forehead. Melting against his boyfriend, Cas allowed himself to forget his purpose for a short while. He didn't want to argue with Dean, and arguing about something like his birthday seemed ridiculous, but it felt weird to not know. They had not been together for long, only recently updating their relationship status from roommates to boyfriends, but there had been an instant connection between them, and considering they shared everything, not knowing such an important detail about the man most important to him just felt wrong.
It is absolutely impossible to listen to anything but Dean’s movements behind him: rummaging through his backpack or having whispered conversations with his classmates or the way he sometimes laugh to himself or jokes around or simply exists in a space that close to Castiel.
"Uh," he responds eloquently - because apparently he has not made enough of a fool of himself today.
"But it's soo boring to be stuck at home," she whines and an expression of absolute despair appears on her face, "Kara refuses to watch Harry Potter or Stars Wars with me, so I am stuck watching terrible Christmas movies instead. I don't know with which forgotten entity I messed to deserve this fate, but they are very very pissed."
The sky is dark and starless, the clouds covering it in its entirety except for a small rift through which the moon peaks shyly.
He turns around and can't help his face lighting up at the sight of the person who's just come in.
Cas used to have a crush on him when they were in high-school, but he wouldn't be surprised if Dean didn't remember him.
Dean shook his head, the look of love and affection in his eyes setting off a swarm of butterflies in Cas' stomach.
