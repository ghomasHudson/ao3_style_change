John looked up, caught Sherlock's eye, gave his cock a couple of decisive strokes. Sherlock moved his body to every little thing; John thought it was amazing to see how incredibly responsive he was.
He feels his chest tighten, strokes her soft cheek. ”It’s a bit difficult to explain. I promise I'll try, when you’re a little older. But we both love you, very, very much. And that will never change.”
But then, just as he was getting ready to leave, a car crash victim had come in and the following two hours had gone by in minutes. Time always seemed to stop when he was in surgery, being so utterly focused at what he was doing.
John smiled. It very much appeared like he was going to reach out, touch him. A memory flashed by, of John, putting his arms around him in by the kitchen counter at Baker Street.
Sherlock’s throat feels restricted, he raises his head too fast and then squints in pain as a sharp ache stabs him behind his eyes.
He’d killed him. It was the only option left. Had been an easy decision. For John. He owed it to John. For failing to see Mary for who she truly was. For falling from the rooftop and disappearing for two long years. For inviting John to share the flat in the first place.
”Come on, sweetie. You have places to go and people to meet.”
Every time he though about him, it physically hurt.
”What?” he asks, rubbing his eyes.
And then John begins to laugh, he actually
”Please, John. Do us both a favour and just go.”
He dialed Mycroft's emergency number, got voice mail. So much for his bloody talk about always picking up, John thought angrily.
Mark entertained with stories and gossip from the film making business, he was a film producer and worked for a major company, so there was plenty of material to choose from. When he finally stopped for breath, John turned to Charlotte, who was seated next to him.
”Ten days! Must have been a bad wound. And I can’t even imagine how you were able to tolerate ten days of rest.”
The restaurant was in Covent Garden, and the taxi had to drive around the block to access the one way street. The exterior of the building was unassuming. A group of attractive women in their twenties, dressed up in short skirts and high heels, stood outside smoking, but that was the only sign of anything happening there.
Eventually, they manage to make their way from the hard tiles of the bathroom floor to Sherlock’s bed.
”I’m gonna come,” he stutters, slamming hard into Sherlock, the hard slapping sound from skin on skin filling the room before he stills, tips over.
”I'm sorry,” he said. ”I don’t intend to be mean to you. And I agree, you deserve nothing but good things, Gabe. You’re a good person. But I think we need to reevaluate the nature of our relationship.”
,” John whispers. ”That’s it, love-”
He pressed send, then spent two hours checking his phone every thirty seconds. Finally it chimed. He had tried to brace himself for yet another excuse, but his heart still sank when he saw that it was just that.
Mycroft is silent for a long time - or maybe just for a few seconds but too long, anyway, for being him. Stays turned towards Sherlock, a thoughtful (condescending) look on his face.
”John,” Sherlock is eventually capable to produce. From the outside he can hear his own voice, it sounds strange, strangled.
And when Gabe had shown up in his life again, he had, for the first time in years, started to experience occasional days without a single painful thought of John. It was a powerful thing, being loved by someone.
”You’ll have to excuse me,
“Oh fuck, Sherlock-” he had to pause to lick his lips, his throat felt dry. “God, I would really want that too, you know. I... I'm just worried it might be too much. Something you'll regret. Or that I might hurt you. This is so perfect, just like it is. I don't need anything more, I hope you know that?”
Mummy’s made Mycroft distribute mulled wine and some sort of frosted cookies. John sits in a chair with his cup on the side table next to him. His phone has been buzzing nonstop; seven incoming and five sent texts during the last twenty-two minutes. If Sherlock really tried, he could make out what John’s writing by observing the movements of his fingers, but knows that it unfortunately would require more staring than is socially acceptable. He briefly considers taking up his phone to secretly film him, then watch it in slow-mo replay, but.. no, seems a bit…
in a relationship, way back then, he just didn’t realise at the time. Because it had been a relationship completely without sex, or even any sort of physical closeness.
Sherlock notices he’s been holding his breath. ”Yes,” he manages to whisper.
Picks it up and sees the notification on the screen.
A flood wave of uninvited emotions was coming his way now.
Sherlock bends down to kiss him again, finds his eyes constantly drawn towards John’s now open trousers, to the dark blue pants visible in the gap at the top.
But the numbness held him in an iron grip, and everything happened so fast, too fast, and then John was standing in front of him, Captain Watson with the straight back and forced composure. And Sherlock was overcome with a very odd sense of detachment. It was like he was separated from his body, observing himself, and maybe it was the drugs beginning to kick in sooner than he’d calculated.
He gets up, pours himself another glass of wine, and without asking, another scotch for John.
”Right on cue,” Sherlock said. ”I was just calling out for a doctor.”
”Love it when you talk like that,” John gasps. ”Bit naughty after all, eh, posh boy?”
And at some point, as always before, the sinking feeling escalated into a whirling, drowning sensation. It was like a deafening buzz in his ears.
”Yes… oh, Sherlock- please…”
”Did I ever tell you that you think too much?” John’s voice was a low, smiling murmur.
The only option left is to pull the duvet up over his head again. He closes his eyes. Thinks that happy endings only exist in fairytales. Thinks that he has been
Sherlock made a sudden move to reach for the bottle. He refilled John's glass, then his own. Through something of a miracle, almost all of the liquid made it into the tumblers.
“John. Oh John. Did Mycroft call you?”
”Sherlock, listen, the reason I called was to say that I really enjoyed seeing you last night. And I understand you’re angry, and that’s fine, but could we please not do this on the phone? In fact, I was thinking-”, John gathered some needed courage, ”-if you’re not too busy tonight, perhaps you’d let me buy you dinner?”
All he could do was to keep her immobile, calm and warm until help arrived. He was chatting away in the manner he always talked to badly injured patients, just nonsense small talk, anything to distract them from their fear and to lessen the trauma.
John had let his head fall back into the pillow, closed his eyes as he was trying to catch his breath and regain some sort of consciousness. He was drawn out of his coma-like state by Sherlock, still on his knees in between John's legs, but now leaning forward, his upper body hovering over John's. He had that distant, hazy look in his eyes and he was holding his own cock, stroking it desperately.
”I want to be with you,” John said softly. ”I want to be with you every single second that I can. I think about you constantly when we’re apart, you know. I love you, Sherlock, you know I do.” John was stroking his back.
”Alright.” John nods slowly, looks at Sherlock for a bit too long with an expression that he can’t quite pinpoint. ”Thank you, Sherlock. I mean, not just for this, but… It was really great to see you again.” A hint of a smile; he looks- sad? ”I can’t believe it’s been five years, doesn’t feel like it.”
”But I’ll give you-” he panted heavingly, ”-bonus points for effort!”
He turned to Mike again. ”What do you mean, that it keeps getting worse?”
’Meeting Mike at the pub, might be late.’ He hesitated before signing. Usually they would put ’I love you” at the end but that seemed weird now. He simply wrote ’John’. He left the note on the counter right next to the kitchen sink, Mary was sure to see it there.
It was the oddest thing, but coming back had felt like some sort of awakening.
”Sherlock.” John is the one to speak first. ”My God. Wow. Sherlock.”
John startles at Sherlock’s voice and the hint of anger there. When he turns his head to look at Sherlock, he sees something that looks like… tired defiance.
This is the first time he’s kissed someone other than Mary, ever since they started to date.
”Really?”
When Sherlock dizzily shook his head, John started to quickly unbutton. In an amazed blur, Sherlock watched John tear off his shirt and undershirt.
”Not until seven thirty.”
”What about James Sholto, then?”
After that, she just kept talking. Completely unprompted, the words kept flowing out of her.
He searched for John's eyes, smiled, and when he was certain he was at an angle where the Japanese wouldn’t be able to see it, he winked.
”John,” Sherlock continues, and John meets his eyes - still unreadable, neutral. ”Up for a walk?”
Mrs Holmes replies without looking at him. ”Sherlock, stop muttering and go check on your uncle, will you. I think he needs some help again.”
Of growing up in a world where nobody could be trusted to help you.
”I love you," Gabriel had whispered, their bodies connected, and Sherlock had felt a strange mix of bliss and panic stirring up inside him.
They had stepped inside the restaurant to discover there were only a handful of guests there, although the kitchen seemed quite busy preparing take-out orders.
John got back into bed, and Sherlock felt the by now automatic, anticipative tingling response to John’s scent, to John’s body so close to his. But this time, John didn’t put his arms around him, and Sherlock didn’t move.
”Uh, sorry, it’s just, you know. Rosie.”
. A rush of excitement shoots through his spine. It finally happened, after all these bloody years. Feels his heart rate increase, his chest expand at the thought.
are you talking about? You never said anything about… oh. Oh Sherlock. You are lying, aren’t you.”
”Alright then,” Sherlock sighs. ”If you must.”
The tongue in his mouth, the hips thrusting against him.
John leans back into his seat again, puts his sock-clad feet up on the table. ”I don’t think I’m in a position to judge. It’s been a long day. Especially for you, Sherlock.”
After forty minutes of interrogation, mixed with what John could only think of as thinly disguised threats about various things he should or shouldn't do (quitting his job had been one of the shoulds), he had been dropped off at Baker Street.
After John had told him he was engaged to be married, he had forced himself to stop thinking about it. He had not yet been able to completely prevent John from occasionally appearing, uninvited, in his masturbatory fantasies, or in his sleep during sexual dreams (those were the worst, uncontrollable), but he had been able to significantly reduce the frequency.
The snow in his hair had made Sherlock’s curls twist tighter than usual. His ears and the tip of his nose were red from the cold, he had a thick woolen scarf wrapped around his neck, and John was unable to form a single thought.
”Hi Harry, what’s up?” He notices that his left hand trembles, which is hasn’t done for years and years.
Sees Sherlock’s eyes widen, and thinks that he’s beginning to learn a little bit about what works here, what works with Sherlock. For Sherlock.
Strong gusts of wind were rattling the bedroom windows of the Knightsbridge flat. The alarm clock on the nightstand showed 03:17, solid darkness still outside. Sherlock was propped up against the plush headboard, his face bathed in the blueish light from the open laptop that was resting on his thighs.
John grabs a hold of Sherlock’s waist, as if to anchor himself for a moment. Then, he slowly runs his other hand down Sherlock’s stomach, past his hip and down to his thigh. ”Look how hard you are,” John murmurs, voice low and hoarse. ”All for me?”
It’s so nice, so warm to be under the duvet and so close to John. He allows himself to relax. ”Obvious.”
John lifts his (non-sticky) hand to stroke away the sweat-soaked hair that has fallen over Sherlock’s eyes; runs it over his cheek. Their eyes meet. John holds the gaze for a long moment, his hand still cupping Sherlock’s face, fingertips brushing over his jaw.
Sherlock suddenly felt like he was suffocating.
. Which is another word for having a forced conversation, trying to be a part of each other’s lives when they both know that’s not true.
“I liked what, exactly?” Sherlock asked, but his voice was trembling. John smiled. This was going to be fun.
”Stop!” John mouths. He stops.
“Doctor Watson only did what any good person should have done. We are all emergency physicians, and I think I speak for all of us when I say that it was the correct thing to do. We come from Tokyo, we're only here visiting for a few days, and Doctor Watson has been so very kind to offer to show us around the city and this beautiful park. Doctor Watson is a good man, sir, and we would hate for him to get into any trouble because of us.”
”No. I mean yes. I mean, I did it on purpose. As a joke,” Sherlock said grumpily.
He felt Greg’s gaze following him as he started to move across the room.
Sherlock thought that a pro bono case with a missing dog, albeit one with a murderous streak, really didn't make the cut, didn't even rate as a one, frankly. But he was in an excellent mood, and had nowhere in particular to be.
”Stop! God,
”Did you, John? That makes me very happy to hear. Thank goodness you’re back again.”
Then John seemed to have decided to step it up a notch. He was beginning to thrust harder, faster. Sherlock was hard again, his cock pressed tightly down against his stomach as John kept pushing into him.
She watched him, guardedly, then moved a bit closer. John tried to stifle a big sigh of relief when she finally slumped down next to him.
John moaned loudly as the head of his dick breached Sherlock in one steady motion. Sherlock was busy controlling his breathing, trying to prevent his muscles to clench. It hurt, a bit, but surprisingly little given John’s size. Maybe John had been right about taking his time with the preparations.
”If you want to, then, with this- I could actually stay here all the time. Only if you want to, of course, I mean, I’d be happy to keep my flat if-”
At this, Sherlock sprung to life. He was so angry he could hardly breathe.
To make matters worse, he was then hit with a flashback from that night when he’d let himself in - the night that had started it all. He got a vivid image of Sherlock, sitting in his chair, and- oh fuck. John tried all he could to push this intrusive memory out of his mind.
His words make John startle.
Sherlock quickened his steps, forcing Gabe to do the same to keep an even pace. They were walking though Regent’s Park, it was a Saturday afternoon in July. The heat was oppressive, and they were both sweating. Sherlock intensely wished he’d insisted on taking this walk alone.
”Wait! I didn’t mean-”
He beamed at Sherlock, who now looked less terrified, but instead thoroughly confused.
He looked at the screen, and then, in a moment of boldness added,
”Oh my god!” Sherlock gasped, but was then roused by a worrying thought.
A uniformed woman from the ambulance crew came up to ask them for their identity cards.
”No,” said Sherlock. ”That was, eh. Good. But-” he grew silent again.
“There's no need for you to either thank me or ask for my permission, love,” he said. “Just go downstairs now, so the fella won't have to stand outside in this godawful weather.”
John’s grip had been broken by Sherlock’s movement. They were just standing in front of each other, so close but not touching, and John was faintly aware that he was staring with his mouth open.
He’d practiced them at night. Practiced saying the words that his lips had never formed before; not to John, not to anyone. Whispered them out into the empty darkness of the cell.
But there was also something else in this kiss, and it was that thing that made John’s gut twist.
The anger helps. Makes it so much easier to just get this over and done with.
John got into the bed and laid down next to him.
He would yield himself completely. For once in his life, he would do exactly as people told him to. Maybe they would know things about life that he so obviously didn’t.
He moved one hand to the nape of Sherlock’s neck, tangled his fingers in the long curls, gently cupped his hand there. He put his other arm around his back, and tried not to show his hesitation when he was reminded of the scars there.
John collected himself before asking. ”About which things?”
”Fuck, John,
Then again, this entire situation was unlikely. Guilt, perhaps. Would probably try to call him in the morning, apologize profoundly. “I hope we can still be friends,” things along that line.
He had a hard time acting normal around Mary. He worried, irrationally, that she would be able to read his thoughts just by looking at him, just like Sherlock would have, and John tried to stay away from her as much as he could. But on Saturday evening, there was no escape from sitting down together to have dinner, Anna at long last asleep in her crib.
”You, my dear,” John sniggered, ”you fell off the bed. From a sitting position. Just like that.” He snorted with laughter. ”My poor baby!”
John tried for a moment to make sense of this, but quickly decided he couldn't.
he had wondered, the first morning when he’d woken up in his own bed, in his own place, feeling at peace for the first time in… he didn’t know. Too long. Way too long.
The man was simply gorgeous, that much anyone could see, fit like a race horse, with those full lips, and silvery eyes you could get lost in. He was clearly capable of passion, despite the aloof exterior - what with the composing and dancing and crime solving. Furthermore, he was also, as it had turned out, attracted to men.
They stood like that for a long moment, Sherlock looking at John, John just staring out into nothing. Then John lowered his face into his left hand, and Sherlock’s heart almost stopped when he realised that John was crying.
”Oh,” escapes Sherlock’s lips. ”Oh-” Squeezes his eyes shut, his whole body trembling.
He felt his eyes go heavy.
”Is there a doctor here?!” the man’s voice carried over the gusts of wind. ”Find a doctor! Call an ambulance!”
The sitting room was still, silent, a heavy fog of cigarette smoke lingered in the darkness.
”Are you?” Sherlock asked.
”Sherlock?” When he opens his eyes, John has moved closer. He is observing Sherlock with a deep furrow between his eyebrows. Sherlock starts when he feels John’s warm hand touching his face; his calloused thumb gently swiping away wetness from the skin beneath his eyes.
”I am,” he replied thoughtfully. ”I think I’ve learned a few things about myself,” he said, looking quite awkward at the topic.
The memories made him smile. He knew this place so well, the lingering scents of food products from all over the world, coming together into sensory overload. It was like it had only been a week or so since he last was there, browsing the colorful jars and cans and boxes on the shelves.
”That’s amazing,” Sherlock said, a dreamy expression in his eyes. John could tell he was already far away in his mind, making plans.
At the times in his life when penetrative sex had been a regularly recurring feature, he'd used to maintain a much more controlled schedule of all the things that went into being able to bottom. But since he'd just about given up hope that John would ever want this, he hadn't really bothered lately. Lucky stroke tonight, though.
“Sherlock, are you there?” No reply.
To not know where Sherlock was, or how he was doing, and not be able to reach him – it made John feel almost physically sick to his stomach. His entire body told him to act, to move. But there was nothing for him to do and nowhere for him to go.
“Excuse me, officer, may I please say something?” he asked in excellent English.
John’s voice broke, he cleared his throat and continued.
And Sherlock remembered his analysis of John, from years ago, their very first night, when John had shot the serial killer cabbie.
The way John’s chest was moderately hairy, his stomach almost hair free, but then had a dense line of rougher, blonde body hair. It trailed down from his belly button, downwards, appeared to continue below his trousers, where Sherlock had not yet been able to observe.
, alright!
Sherlock was idly leaning back in the leather sofa at Baker Street. A streak of sunlight made it through the open window, creating a lovely warmth where it fell across his arms and chest.
He notices John’s respiration change, quicken. He’s nervous, too, but he’s a soldier, after all. He’s braver than Sherlock, braver with words and emotions.
Sits there in the cold as the hours pass. Thinks about Afghanistan, and about night shifts in the A&E at Bart’s, when he was fresh out of Med School and terrified of the sudden responsibility placed upon his shoulders. Thinks about the stakeouts with Sherlock, the ones they laughed about together just a few nights ago.
Hears a pained sound from Sherlock, like a whimper, and for a second he thinks he might have hurt him somehow. But when he hears it again and realises it’s a sound not of pain, but of need and arousal, he has to rather abruptly push Sherlock off.
When the daylight gets too sharp for the sitting room curtains to suffice, Sherlock comes shuffling down the hallway, mattress tipping as he gets in, crawls in under the covers, close to John.
“I'd like that,” she whispered, smiling faintly between the tears that were once again trickling down her cheeks. “I'd like that very much.”
“You're amazing,” he breathed. “So beautiful. Now, be my good boy and suck that dick, will you, love,” he said, and the reaction it drew from Sherlock was frankly amazing to watch.
John couldn’t read his expression.
”Sherlock… took it very hard. For a long time, I think he blamed himself. He was just a small child - and we tried to explain it to him, of course, that accidents happen and it’s nobody’s fault - but it was very difficult to get through.”
The whirling feeling inside Sherlock grows stronger. He squeezes his hand harder around John’s fist, fucks into it once, twice and then stills as his entire body tenses up and he’s coming in hard pulses between their bodies.
On a whim, he decided to call Gabe.
It has really been an amazing experience, to write this fic with the real-time support from you guys. I can't thank you enough for your incredibly generous input; in the form of praise, constructive feedback, funny remarks, kudos, subscriptions, bookmarks and recs. THANK YOU!
The girl leaned forward to do the same. He noticed she wasn’t able to coordinate her lips sufficiently to blow the air stream in a focused direction, but choose not to try to correct her. He blew again, a bit harder. The girl did the same. She was looking back and forth between the butterfly and him, smiling.
”So, I was actually rather good at Latin, but I saw my chance to finally get a breakthrough with Sherly here. So, I asked him for help with the speech… and the rest, as they say, is history!” Gabriel smiled, looking pleased with himself.
John’s passcode ridiculous as usual (Rosie’s birthdate, first try). A tight band around his chest, restricting his breathing as he opens the message.
Entering the quiet, sparsely decorated flat, it felt less like a home than it ever had before, so great was the contrast from Baker Street. He’d felt something similar many times before, only now, it didn’t become him the slightest. Didn’t make him feel down the way it used to do. Life was improving by the hour.
What the hell, Sherlock thought.
, Sherlock thinks.
“You liked that, didn't you...” John did not break his intensive eye contact.
Gabriel looked away, sighed. Sherlock thought briefly about the experiment he wanted to get started back at Baker Street. He should probably try to pick up a few supplies on the way back. Pig eyes. They were remarkably similar to human eyes, would do for this particular thing. Maybe the butcher would have some to give him. They were usually very accommodating.
And just as John was about to lift his glass to take another sip of wine, feeling happier than in a long time at this comforting possibility, his hand stilled. Because at the entrance of the room, was the unmistakable silhouette of Sherlock Holmes.
”What’s this?” Sherlock asked, looking even more confused than before. He was holding in his hand the key that John had placed inside the little box.
It was chilly, definitely more than a hint of autumn in the air, and John thought that it might begin to rain in a while. The park was practically empty, apart from the occasional fellow dog walker or random person; empty, quiet and peaceful.
”I used to read your blog, you know.” He smiled, a weak smile. ”Then suddenly you were getting married! I’ll admit that was quite a shocker.”
”That’s grand, John, absolutely brilliant,” Caroline says, her voice genuinely happy now and Sherlock doesn’t even want to know what she’s referring to. What’s
”Right,” said Sherlock, then grew quiet, looked down again. ”Guess I’ll go by myself then,” he mumbled towards the phone, and John thought there was a touch of anger in those words.
”Do you have any plans for tonight?”
********************
But John didn’t like him smoking.
Sherlock tried to hide his face in the pillow, but since he was fully on his back, he only managed it halfway. He quickly covered his eyes with a hand. He struggled to make his voice sound normal.
Sherlock stopped, looked at John with that high-and-mighty expression that John knew all too well.
”Boyfriend,” he said in a posh, pleasant voice, meeting John’s challenging stare with steady blue eyes. ”I’m his boyfriend.”
. They need time, a lot of time, spent together. If Sherlock has learned anything these past five years, it is that his work is not enough. Not anymore. Maybe never was, he just didn’t know it. Not before John, who came in and showed Sherlock the difference between making a living and having a life.
This was not a one night stand he was the secret witness to, no. This was not the first time, and Sherlock and the guy, who ever he was, were not strangers. There was something too intimate in the way they interacted, and something too unhurried and relaxed in the way they were kissing.
While the actor’s attention was still turned to their little group, Gabriel suddenly spoke up. ”I thought your portrayal of Turing was simply brilliant,” he said with a big smile. ”Though I’m sure you get that all the time.”
No!! Do not ruin this moment, for fuck’s sake!
Terrible chills from those words. He thought again that he really, really wanted to live.
”Wait,” John says, looking worried. ”Wait - please let me finish.”
”Is it time?” John asks, as he notices Sherlock’s eyelids getting heavy.
”He doesn’t want me to. That’s the only reason. Otherwise, rest assured there would be nothing in this world that could stop me.” Oh fuck. The worst part of it all was that it was true.
He was also proud. Proud that he had managed to put Sherlock’s well being before his own, so that he could now look back on his actions along the way and still stand tall. Proud that he had done all the difficult things he’d needed to, in order for them to eventually get here, together.
”Not a word, John. Not a word.”
”God, I want you so badly.” John’s voice is different; darker. Rapid puffs of air hitting Sherlock’s neck, making him shiver. ”The things I want to do to you, Sherlock, fuck, will you let me?”
“Wow, Sherlock-” John smiled, reached out a hand and stroked his cheek. He wished he could find a way to make that furrow of concern and confusion between Sherlock's eyebrows go away.
John finally manages to get his thoughts in order enough to stop this litany. He turns back from the sink, proceeds to kneel in front of Sherlock to be level with his face.
“I'd rather not talk about her tonight, Sherls. Chapter closed. Book finished.”
“Oh, Sherlock, god, I'm going to come,” he managed to get out, and then, his body tensed up as he felt it happening. He felt the blissful nothingness of release take over him as he came so hard, came inside of Sherlock. From a distant place, he heard Sherlock say something.
All the pent up anger towards Sherlock, everything he’d ever done, from poisoning his tea to jumping off the roof and pretending to be fucking dead for two years, leaving him in a pit darker than hell; it had all merged into one sole point of focus. The singularity before the Big Bang. And then, the explosion.
”What?” John looked up in confusion.
His thoughts were interrupted by the door to the flat opening.
John felt exhausted after walking, and then running, around in the rain, trying to catch the damn thing. When it had finally appeared in sight, it had been quite difficult to actually get close enough to put it back on the leash, because the dog had seemed to think it was the funniest game ever invented.
With that, his mind was made up. He would return the favor. He would protect Sherlock by not pushing him, by not standing in his way. He would NOT be the cause of any more distress for Sherlock, even if that meant never seeing him again.
”In BXL, Mycroft made me go. Will likely be back mid month. SH”
”Lestrade has been keeping me busy, can’t complain.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
What the hell was all that about? He had gotten one chance with John, one fantastic opportunity, and he’d ruined it in the worst possible way.
”But what?” Sherlock raised his head to look at John. They’d had similar exchanges before, but never had there been a ’but’ in there. A condition. A threat.
”Still here,” Sherlock says. He’s taken his hand away from his face now, is leaning forward in his chair. ”Ten.”
life. You never want to hear it.”
, John hazily thought as they moved.
“-fourth or fifth from this bottle?”
Sherlock had always scoffed at the word
”No no no”, he heard John say, as he pulled Sherlock in even tighter. ”I’m so sorry.” John was holding him, rocking him slightly.
John waits, because it’s the only viable option he can think of. The sandstone entrance steps are not much to sit on, but it’s not like it comes close to the top ten of uncomfortable ways he’s spent a night wake.
”I prefer to text.”
Over dinner, conversation floated effortlessly, greatly helped by Mark’s offbeat humor and constant laughing. He asked John about his work, politely choosing not to push John with questions about Afghanistan, and the four of them talked briefly about Anna. Mary showed pictures on her phone, and everyone gushed over the cute baby.
He violently tried to push these thoughts out of his head. Of course Sherlock was alright! Or at least, was going to be! He was going to be alright and then he would come home, and this time, John would never let him down again.
He dialed Mycroft's number, two signals went through but then, voice mail again. John fought an impulse to chuck the phone into the wall. Then, fear came back to eat him up again.
Standing so close, he could literally feel Sherlock tense up at his question. There was no reply.
John was seething. ”We lived together for years, Sherlock,
They both startled at the sharp signal, cutting through the air. John didn’t take his phone out of his pocket; the ringing stopped but then started again. John took it out, turned the signal off.
”I understand this must all seem crazy to you, Sherlock, and that the timing sucks. And I’m so sorry about that. But you know, I don’t think I realized until I, er, saw you in a, er, relationship.”
”Yes, you too.” He sits up to remove his last pieces of clothing and then watches, in awe, as Sherlock slides out of his trousers and pants in one fluid motion.
Sherlock, by contrast, hadn’t had a case for a while and had spent his days in an ever increasing boredom. He’d counted the minutes until John would be back from work, but when he finally was, they’d hardly even talked, much less had sex. It made Sherlock uncomfortable, this disconnect between them. It made his worrying thoughts pick up speed again.
Then, just as abruptly as he began, he hands the album back to his mum.
Then Mycroft turns to Sherlock, who is still outside the door stomping off the snow from his shoes.
John thought and then immediately hated it and tried to push it away. When was the last time he had gotten a blow job? He couldn’t really remember. Before the baby, definitely. Maybe that reunion night with Mary after Christmas day?
John withdraws his fingers, sits up more on the bed. Fumbles around to find the condoms, rolls one on with a shaky hand. He’s harder than he’s been in a very, very long time. Sherlock takes a pillow and pushes it underneath his hips, then blindly pats his hand around the mattress until he finds the bottle of lube. John takes it from him, then applies a generous amount on himself and Sherlock.
After a while, they had parted ways, and Sherlock had decided to keep walking. It was such a beautiful day, sunshine and birds and butterflies in the park.
”You’ve met someone? So soon after your divorce?”
He notices John, quietly watching him, a thoughtful look in his eyes, and tries to come back to the present in order to act a bit
Sherlock knew he was grinning big now.
Smiling. Nervous. Hesitant.
THE END (of the beginning)
John returned to see that Sherlock had been cornered by a man and a woman. He recognized them from Bart’s, remembered that Sherlock had actually told him about them, long time ago, during one of their relaxed Saturday nights at home. Yes, he remembered now, and smiled. He knew Sherlock couldn’t stand either of them.
”You are so fucking beautiful.”
”No,” said John. ”He didn’t. But Mycroft paid me a visit last night.”
Sherlock shows John what he's got.
”Put that down, you need some sleep as well.” Gabriel gently tugged Sherlock’s arm and he obliged, closed the laptop and put it on the floor, then clicked off the bedside lamp.
”Mm hm,” John says, trailing a finger down Sherlock’s side, squeezing his prominent hip bone. ”
”No! Go AWAY!! I HATE you! You’re mean and stupid and I won’t go!”
No obsessive thoughts about Sherlock, nor about his own sexual identity. No fantasies about being out solving crimes with a consulting detective in a long coat. In fact, Sherlock hadn’t even entered his mind, up until now. It was just nice, being out, making new friends, having a good time. Maybe this whole thing was temporary, some sort of mid-life crisis?
” Sherlock whispers, his breath coming in hard puffs from his nose now. ”Oh, fuck. Is this happening?”
Standing absolutely still, protected by the darkness of the staircase, John could not stop staring at the sight in front of him. He felt like a deer caught in the oncoming headlights of a car, frozen, mind racing, brain not fully willing to take in the signals the eyes were transmitting. Sherlock was having sex. With a man.
Someone comes up, carrying a police megaphone, hands it over to what John guesses is the negotiator, a man a bit younger than the Commander, dressed in civilian clothes; a winter jacket with a hood and jeans. He takes the megaphone, holds it up.
”Brilliant and beautiful and kind-”
”You’re fucking mental!” John shouted. Mary had walked after him, now she was standing casually leaned against the door frame to the kitchen.
”Sherlock… no. You can’t- you can’t know what would have happened. You were very young, and you did what you believed was right at the time. Maybe Mr Trevor wouldn’t even have accepted your help. Maybe the blackmailers had just found another way, after you’d left. Maybe he’d had a stroke anyway. There are all kinds of things that could have happened. Point is - you
Not only more of this – the sex – but more of everything. Wanted to be close to Sherlock in everything in life, indefinitely. He hoped with all his being that Sherlock felt the same.
********************
He sees the typing bubble, appearing and disappearing, for almost five minutes. But no text comes. He begins to regret writing it, but then firmly decides not to dwell on it. He crawls in under the covers, falls asleep with a fluttering feeling inside.
”Alright, so what about the promotion then?”
John felt arousal shoot sharply through him at hearing those words, whispered so quietly into his ear. He could feel Sherlock's hot breath on the thin skin of his ear, and it didn't exactly lessen when Sherlock unexpectedly bit his earlobe, quite hard.
Sherlock couldn't believe this was happening. The feeling of John's dick, so very suggestively positioned, oh, it was absolutely fantastic. He tried very, very hard to retain his self control, because his entire body was screaming to move, to push down his arse harder against John's cock, to lift his legs up for a better angle-
As he said it, he drew his knees upwards, planted his feet flat on the mattress.
He sees John flinch as he says the last part.
”Certainly. Boxing first. You have put on eight, no ten pounds in muscle mass since I saw you in December, mainly in your shoulders and legs, which is precisely where a good fighter wants them. You’ve simultaneously lowered your body fat percentage by three percent, at least. Looks good by the way,” he added with a smile, causing John to feel his cheeks flush.
”It’s a key, love. You use it to lock and unlock doors, usually.” He smiled.
”I don’t know what to say,” John says. ”I thought… I thought that you felt-”
“Sometimes, particularly in between girlfriends, you use toys. You keep them hidden – or so you think – in your underwear drawer.”
She looks up to meet his eyes, sniffles loudly. ”Why can’t you and Mummy be together?”
”Still young,” said Sherlock. It had been a mistake to come here. Best to go now.
”You bet,” he said, staring into Sherlock’s eyes, careful to keep his expression stern. He was insanely pleased with himself when Sherlock averted his eyes, and he saw a pink blush spreading across his cheeks.
”Let’s wait it out under there,” Sherlock called over the drenching rain, gesturing to the roofed bandstand located right nearby.
John stops moving, just keeps his fingers in place inside of him; bends over to kiss him. Sherlock grabs his head with both hands, holds him there for a long time as they keep kissing. Breaks the kiss to look at Sherlock’s face, sees heavy bedroom eyes and flushed cheeks.
So when his phone suddenly pings, John’s heart still leaps up in his throat. He scoops it up from his pocket in some sort of supersonic speed, only to breathe out in disappointment one second later.
”Don’t feel you have to bother. It’s all just.. meaningless traditions, made up by ignorant people who needed something to cling to,” he says, because, a) he wants John to not feel out of place, and b) it’s what he really thinks.
Sherlock felt it too, felt it all over and everywhere. He heard himself whimper.
”I don’t understand why you’ve said, over and over again, that you-”
It’s highly unlikely that John’s willing to, say, take off his clothes here in the sitting room, and Sherlock urgently needs him to.
Clinging so hard to Sherlock's shoulder and neck, John squeezed his eyes shut in pure reflex.
Sherlock tried to shoot a polite smile back at her. He really had no idea what she was talking about. But it was, indeed, fun, getting the chance to meet with people who seemed to have a genuine curiosity about science and nature.
”Excuse us for a while, John,” Gabe mumbled and then took Sherlock by the hand and began to drag him away into the thick crowd. As they left, Sherlock turned his head to look at John; a thousand unspoken questions in his eyes.
********************
”Sherlock-” John began, but Sherlock didn’t want to talk. No point in talking, anyway, since he had nothing to offer that could make it better. Without a word, he dropped down to his knees in front of John, one quick hand opening his zipper, the other swiftly trying to get John’s flaccid dick out of his jeans.
“Won't take long,” he panted, and John thought that seeing Sherlock undone like this was hotter than anything he'd been able to imagine.
”Sherlock,” John said again, and just hearing his name in John’s kind, soft voice made him feel better. ”I can’t deduce things like you can, so it would be helpful if you told me what it is that you’re concerned about? Because you see, from my perspective, everything is absolutely perfect. This was- I can’t even put it into words. I think - no, I know - that I’ve never felt like this before.” He smiled a little.
”Oh god, Sherlock,” John moaned, and Sherlock felt his hands sliding and caressing all over his back and his behind. ”Oh god, you’re gorgeous. I can’t believe I get to do this with you.”
”Yeah,” replied John. This was what he was worrying about, the reason he’d brought it up. He wanted to go to the party, it’d been a long time since he’d seen the people from the Yard and from Bart’s, and he missed them.
”Perhaps you would like to come with me, say hello? You’ve actually already met her, once. We could take an evening stroll through Regent’s. I think you’ll like her.”
”When can we go to Sussex Downs?” Sherlock asked, breaking the kissing.
And all throughout, Sherlock had supported him. Last night, Sherlock had hinted at having had feelings for John for a long time. And even so, he had encouraged him, facilitated the marriage. Why, John wondered now.
With his right hand, he tilted Sherlock’s head slightly down. Sherlock could see him wetting his lips with a quick dart of his tongue. John reached up and let his lips, ever so softly, touch Sherlock’s lower lip in a featherlight kiss.
”Me too,” he eventually managed to produce.
Sherlock’s heart stops.
At this, John broke out in a loud laugh, and Sherlock shortly followed, his eyes lighting up with sparkles.
“You'll have to tell me to stop if it hurts too much,” said John, knowing very well that no pain would be an unrealistic goal.
John was waiting for him to say something, looked angry, upset. It was still raining, still dark.
All that work, wasted in a matter of an evening. And then John had said that thing and acted like he was actually going to kiss him. That, he couldn’t even begin to comprehend. Sherlock had never been able to form a proper understanding of what John was thinking about him.
That was… good, of course. Of course it was.
As soon as John heard the front door close, he picked up his phone. Text or call, that was the question. He figured it was more likely to get a reply via text, since Sherlock almost always let his calls go straight to voicemail; but then again, more likely to persuade Sherlock to meet up with him if they were talking.
”Sherlock,” said John as they were seated across from each other in silence, drinking their tea. ”I have decided something, and it’s not open for discussion.”
Sherlock leans forward again, looks at it for a short moment. ”I see.”
”Sure. I will text you when I’m back. SH”
”Um,” John says. ”I’m sorry but you don’t seem that way. You’re trembling, and your face is white as a sheet.”
They'd been standing up, kissing and caressing each other's bodies for a while, when Sherlock suddenly let go and spun around. John noticed that his movements still were a bit uncoordinated, a bit unstable, but all in all he seemed to be less inebriated than earlier. Good. That was good. And John knew he wasn't exactly one hundred percent sober himself.
”Sherlock-” John paused. ”Let’s not go there again, please. Let’s try to talk about this constructively.”
”Well, it’s just so unlike him. He’s behaving odd, for being Sherlock, that is. Suddenly he’s almost… nice-ish. He said ’thank you’ when Molly brought him coffee. He didn’t yell bloody murder when a lab technician dropped a beaker. And I almost forgot - you’re going to love this, John! The other day, he was in the lab using the microscope, and - brace yourself - he was actually humming along with the radio!”
The sounds got subdued, like someone had put a pair of earmuffs on him.
Suddenly, John is wide awake. His entire body goes stiff. A second later, shame is washing over him like a bucket of cold water.
”Don’t hold back.” John smiled, but his eyes were dark with desire.
Sherlock could see the way John was looking at him. Not much to doubt, there, really. Sherlock could see it, he could feel it. He could even feel it deep within himself, in that intuitive way that he was just beginning to discover.
John was up close now, too close, leaning over him. Bloody hell.
”Mummy, Sherlock’s right. You’ll bore our guests out of their minds with that,” Mycroft snaps. Sherlock turns abruptly to look at him instead.
”Don’t be absurd, of course it’s relevant,” she said with a shrug. ”But anyway, it won’t happen.”
”And I, in case you haven't noticed,” John laughed under his breath, ”am quite significantly stronger. You may be tall, and you may be a decent fighter, but against me you don’t stand a chance, love.”
”Alright,” she said. ”See the restaurant across the street? I’ll tell them they can find you both there. But you cannot leave, understood?”
Sherlock looks up, and John feels a strange mix of warmth and worry in his chest as their eyes meet.
”When Victor met me at the station, I could see that the last two months had been very hard for him. He had lost a lot of weight, and looked wearied, worn-down. Nothing left of that happy person he’d always used to be. The first thing he said to me was, ’Daddy is dying’.
”I’d be happy to help out, just say what,” he says. ”Where can I put my bag?”
“But whatever.” She exhaled. “Right now, I need to sleep. You can leave the phone on the staircase when you go. And call me before you come over here again, I'd like to be prepared, yeah?”
“You need sex on a regular basis. If you're not dating, then how will you get it? Your high moral standards, combined with your rather strong need for validation through sexual relations, seem counter intuitive to hiring prostitutes.”
Sherlock nods, and John sees his expression beginning to shift, from oppositional to wondering.
The present moment was all that existed to John now. With every forceful motion of in, then almost out, then in again, he felt himself getting rapidly closer to orgasm. He was slamming into Sherlock now, the smacking sound of skin meeting skin filled his ears.
Things were going spectacularly bad. Sherlock had envisioned keeping up his attitude of distant nonchalance from their conversation on the phone, objectively gathering more information about what was going on with John. But for the last two hours, he had been failing miserably.
In John’s eyes, anger.
”So maybe in two weeks then?”
”Do you really have to ask? You know very well why I can’t.”
”Optera axa?” she whispered back, instead.
”I just never imagined that I would be having a dick up my arse on my wedding night, that’s all,” he managed to say, before again breaking out in uncontrollable laughter.
Harry had seen it, though, despite his frantic efforts to conceal it. Had teased him about it, relentlessly, when they were still living under the same roof. And he had hated her for it; hated her with a burning intensity he’d rarely felt neither before nor after.
Just before Sherlock turned the corner on the staircase, John saw him put his hands in his hair to ruffle up the curls, in the same way he always did in front of a mirror. It was such a tiny, harmless thing to do, but it still caused John to clench his hands into tight fists.
Gabriel looked up in surprise, but he didn’t comment on what John had said.
* * *
John can’t help but smile, feeling worry turn into a warm sense of - well, pride, actually. Pride over this brilliant man in front of him, now the sole center of everybody’s attention.
“Miss you. I, um-" John pauses for a moment but is still turned towards him.
Happy flutter back in stomach. But after all this, must make certain. Cannot risk another
Sherlock looked at John with a smug, superior expression.
. It’s tearing him apart, to stand there and not have any idea what John is going to say. What does he
Because this much he’d learned: Sherlock Holmes lives means John Watson lives.
”What?” asked John.
Sherlock didn’t have to think for long about this.
”You did?” Sherlock’s face is buried in the crook of John’s neck.
“Please John, spare me the melodrama. You 'love' him, you say? Well, perhaps our definitions of that concept differ slightly.”
Dr. Riyat leaned forward a bit in his chair.
. What could only be described as-
”Mmm. No thanks,” Sherlock says. Maybe this was a bad idea. He considers just ending the call but then decides to push through the frustration and embarrassment. This is too important and, God help him, he needs the advice.
Cannot resist any longer. He sneaks a hand down in between them, presses it against John’s groin. Finds his cock rock hard beneath the fabric of his trousers. Rubs his palm along it; and
John waits a minute, lets him finish, then walks up to him again. Sherlock has slumped down, is now sitting right on the ground, arms wrapped around his knees.
John felt the usual pang in his chest, the way he always felt when someone asked him about Sherlock and he had to answer.
John tries desperately to stop himself but it’s already too late. He pulls, somewhat perfunctory, on his hair but Sherlock doesn’t move. John closes his eyes and lets himself be immersed in the unreal sensation of Sherlock swallowing repeatedly around him as he comes.
John woke up and immediately remembered where he was, and why. He grabbed the phone; nothing. No texts, no missed calls. It was 9 o'clock in the morning.
for once in a bloody while?
John would be walking through Regent’s Park on a Saturday afternoon, and a brown and white dog would come up to him, tail frantically wagging. In the dog’s jaws, a rabbit, almost but not completely dead.
“Mycroft, I-” John searched for words and for courage, fought the goddamn tears that were burning in his eyes.
It had taken much longer than expected to make his escape from the clinic. John's phone had kept ringing and colleagues knocking on his door, with lots of, ”Do you have a minute?” and ”Just real quick before you leave.”
”Take it off,” John whispers, and Sherlock quickly rids himself of the shirt, lets it fall to the floor.
”Oh just stop it. Act like a goddamn adult, for once. Let me ask you this. What the hell do you intend to do when you’re, say, sixty-five? Because I guarantee you, by then, even you will be too old to keep this up! What are your plans for when that time comes?”
Finally Sherlock managed to speak, but his voice was broken, weak.
Lord knows he’d been prone to say all the wrong things at times, oh God. John feels his gut twist. He’s jolted out of his thoughts by the rumbling sound of Sherlock’s voice through the megaphone.
”What? No! That wasn’t why-”
Sherlock had tried to avoid learning the specific date of John’s move; mainly by ignoring his calls and only replying briefly to his texts. (To some of them, at least. He was almost certain he had.)
John pulls Sherlock’s head down, prods into his mouth again and Sherlock meets him. Tongue licking tongue. Sherlock’s lips: wet with saliva, his and John’s. When John lets out a very quiet moan, it goes straight to Sherlock’s cock, straining against the restriction of his trousers.
When John got up to use the lavatory, he wobbled into the table and almost tipped over a glass of wine. He realized he was clearly drunk, more so than he had expected.
”Couldn’t be better, John! We’re expanding, did you know that! Second location opening in Notting Hill in a month!” Luigi beamed with pride.
Sherlock felt something break inside him. There was so much love in John’s touch, the way he stroked him over his hair.
”Is that so, John?” he said, his voice huskier than before. John felt his cheeks sting.
It was too difficult for me to-”
John is holding Sherlock’s hips in a steady grip, and is mouthing his cock through his pants. A dark circle has formed in the front; he’s leaking precome in no small amount. John nips at the wetness and Oh God-
John woke up from his thoughts to hear that Sherlock was currently on the subject of dog training.
Sees tears streaming down her flushed face, feels his heart break a little. This is hard for her. Hard for him, as well. Feels his frustration change, soften around the edges.
A fleeting brush of John’s hand against Sherlock’s arm, as he reached over him for his glass. Accidental? A moment’s touch of legs, John’s knee pressing into Sherlock’s thigh as he shifted in the sofa, removed just as soon as it had happened, not acknowledged.
”A cliffhanger? Who?”
”There’s a marriage involved.”
If – no! when! - Sherlock would come home, John would make sure he never even had a reason to turn to drugs again. He would do anything, he realized. Anything!
Sherlock made fists of his hands and dug his fingernails into the soft flesh of his palms. The nails were too well manicured to cause any real pain.
Back in Sherlock's bedroom, they quickly picked up where they'd left off. When John was able to breach Sherlock with two liberally lubed up fingers, he felt a tremble run through Sherlock's thighs. Sherlock was lying down on his back, and John had encouraged him to hold his own legs up, bent by the knees, in order for John to be able to work Sherlock with both his hands.
He laid down next to Gabriel and pulled the duvet up over both of them. Gabriel put a heavy arm around him, and then went back to sleep. Sherlock tucked his face close to Gabriel's neck, observed how their breathing synchronised without any conscious effort. Outside, the wind had subsided and given way to rain.
He startles. ”Huh?”
And then, another of John’s fantasies came to life, as Sherlock actually tilted his head up to look John in the eye, as he slowly took more of John into his mouth. John could see hazy eyes under long, dark eyelashes, and he just could not be quiet. No chance.
”What are you doing?” John asks, an uncomfortable tightness spreading in his chest. Sherlock keeps staring at him, completely quiet. ”Sherlock!”
Under him, Sherlock was moaning; a constant string of needy, high pitched sounds, waxing and waning in rhythm with how John was moving into him. Sherlock had his head thrown back, chin tilted up towards the ceiling, his pale, long neck so beautifully exposed.
Sherlock takes his time and John wonders anxiously if maybe he’s decided to sleep somewhere else. But then he hears footsteps coming closer, and he hurries to turn around, face the wall, tries to school his breathing into the slow, heavy rhythm of sleep. The door shuts close, the mattress shifts again as Sherlock very quietly gets back in.
”Just wanted to check in to see how you’re doing.”
He was surprised by Sherlock actually groaning, loudly, at this. Sherlock had laid down on his stomach, and was just in the process of making himself comfortable between John's naked thighs.
An hour later, they shuffled up the stairs up to the flat in silence. All three of them were too frazzled, too wet, too freezing to do anything but focus on getting inside the warm flat.
”I am sorry about this, I truly am. I always liked you, you’re a good man. Under different circumstances… well. Take care of yourself, John.”
John reached around to grab Sherlock’s ass, both hands firmly squeezing.
He had thought it was from Mary. But really, it had been from John.
She means well, but
”I got Billy to paint everything and lay the carpet, last week,” he smiled. ”But the rest, I did myself. It was a relief, actually, to finally get rid of all those papers.”
”Since when do you care about what people think?” asked John, confused. He didn’t withdraw his hand.
“Right now would be good,” he whimpered, in the far back of his mind feeling thankful for the timely coincidence that made this true.
Don’t want to die.
“On behalf of the police force, I'd like to thank you for your civil courage. Now please move along and leave this to me.”
It was probably in a large part due to fatigue and the release of the tension that had been building up the weeks leading up to yesterday, but now, John simply could not stop laughing. His abs hurt. Tears were streaming down his face. He just couldn’t stop.
John sits down again, not saying anything, his complete attention on Sherlock.
And even though Sherlock was in no way a stranger, it was, after all, their first interaction after the, eh, activities of last night. The moment where they had to look into each others' eyes and make normal conversation, unprotected by the softness of the night.
Gabriel turned to Sherlock and shot him a teasing smile. ”No we weren’t. What do you have to do that’s so important all of a sudden?”
Unreal, how much has changed since then.
need those things, and luckily, I have both in my bedroom. I'll be right back.”
What would happen if he just grabbed him, pulled that warm body down on top of him in the sofa, that would be…
”Up,” he says, breathless, and Sherlock obliges, raises his upper body so that John can free his arms from the shirt. Lies down side by side again, kisses along Sherlock’s throat. Licks his earlobe, then sucks it into his mouth, hears Sherlock breathe heavily.
“Good,” he said, trying to keep a pleasant enough tone. “Thank you for not making this even more difficult than it already is.” He searched for her eyes, pleading.
Eventually, Sherlock spoke.
. It wasn’t the first time, and it wasn’t the last.
The anger in his eyes returned again.
Sherlock reluctantly let go of John.
Sherlock looks at him, defiantly. ”I’ve never begged for mercy in my life.”
It was too much. It required a massive effort to remain still, to not give in to his mad urge to start thrusting in John’s hand. Sherlock tried to channel the restless energy into his breathing instead, inhaled and exhaled loudly through o-shaped lips.
”Come on, hubby,” he said, offering a hand to help Sherlock up on his feet.
,” he whispers as he comes back, catches his breath. ”Wanted to last but Christ, Sherlock, the sight of you, with my cock in your mouth…”
It took Sherlock a millisecond too long to reply.
”So, you’ll reconsider, then?” he asked.
Don’t want to be the reason good people cry.
”No…” he said. ”We always talk about what you want, what you need. I don’t know if it ever occurs to you that I have needs, too? Dreams, goals. Things I want from
A soft moan escaped Sherlock’s mouth, unwillingly, he felt embarrassed about this loss of control, but then John immediately responded by emitting a throaty grunt and pulling Sherlock even closer.
The summer night was warm and lovely, and they were surrounded by beautiful, well dressed people, most of them younger, but there still was a good mix to the crowd.
John looks at Sherlock, wishes he could see the expression on his face. He knows Sherlock is in character right now, that this is a show, but something tells him that this, what Sherlock’s saying now, isn’t. All those years in Sherlock’s past that John never had the guts to ask about. Didn’t want to pry - or maybe didn’t want to know. Sinking, sad feeling in his stomach.
Sherlock pauses to listen.
”But, he’s used to you being undercover, right? Why would he assume that you weren’t that time?”
That’s very good.
As John tried to move his other hand from where it was awkwardly positioned underneath him, he felt Sherlock shifting, too, and suddenly, there was a large hand gripping firmly around his own erection. His body responded on it’s own accord at this sensation, his hips bucked in against Sherlock and into his hand.
“Oh, definitely,” John smiled. “Anytime you want.”
He saw John eyes widen a bit at this, but ignored it, kept on talking.
The bed swayed a little as John moved again. Still practically lying down over Sherlock, John moved his hand to grab his own dick. Then, ever so slowly, he began to drag his cock up and down between Sherlock's buttocks. He was breathing hot air into Sherlock's neck.
John chuckled.
They were both sitting straight up now, on each side of the mattress, with as much distance between them as the bed would allow. John shook his head.
He'd have a glass of Bordeaux in his hand, nibble on things he’d steal from the chopping board, and would be more relaxed and unguarded than John ever saw him otherwise.
John must have nodded, he thinks.
He was clenching and unclenching his fists, and Sherlock wondered briefly if John might hit something. Probably not him, though.
Why, why, why hadn't John mentioned his divorce, that night in December?
Sherlock stepped into character and returned Mark’s smile with a big, teethy grin. Mark sat down and slapped his hand against the table in an excited gesture. ”’
“I don't- I don't know exactly-” Sherlock's voice trailed off again.
John kissed him, Sherlock kissed him back.
”I dunno, Danny,” he says eventually. ”I ’onestly dunno. But he did, and for that I’ll be in debt ’til the day I die.”
”Christ, don’t start with that again,” he snaps, lifts his head to look at John. ”You’ve been most thorough in your efforts to inform me, constantly, that you are
, he managed to think while he swayingly made his way to the loo.
”No,” Sherlock mumbles into his hair. ”You’re mistaken.”
”I see you’ve taken up boxing,” Sherlock said. ”And you’ve gotten a promotion. Chief physician of the Trauma Unit, that’s fantastic John. Congratulations.”
John leaned in towards his ear. “Eager, are we?” he whispered, and felt himself getting more turned on by just the thought of what might be awaiting when they got back to Baker Street.
Was John thinking about fucking him? He must be. Would he want to do it? Most likely, since John had a high sexual drive and a fairly flexible personality.
”Move,” he said, pressing at John’s thighs.
It was easy to talk about Anna for a while. He was so proud of her, and Sherlock was smiling when John told him about the adventures of getting her to try real food for the first time, or how she’d laugh when he’d sing to her. How she loved furry animals and music and soap bubbles.
This was going to be a difficult day to get through.
They didn’t say a word, just kept grinning foolishly at each other, and John felt Sherlock’s happy smile warm him deep inside; thawing his frozen core.
And when he, now and then, had let himself slip away from the world for a little too long, Gabe would text him with some transparent excuse of why he needed Sherlock to come home. Home? Didn’t really seem like the right word, although he knew that as far as everyone else was concerned, Knightsbridge was where he lived.
”I’m so sorry, but I’d better get this,” John says, excuses himself from he little group and begins to walk out of the room.
Sherlock’s heart, dropping like a ten ton weight in his chest.
”Yeah?” John says again, but this time it’s not so much of a question.
”I almost forgot. I wanted to give you this, should you need an extra bit of… understanding. Do be so kind to burn it when you’ve read it.”
John kept getting flashbacks from the kitchen and from Sherlock’s bedroom. It had been… unlike anything he’d ever experienced. He couldn’t stop fantasizing about it.
Maybe in a way, he'd always known this was going to happen. At least, on some level, he'd always wanted it to. He'd just never known it was a possibility.
”What?”
”Not only am I younger than you, I am also quite significantly taller, if you haven’t noticed,” he teased.
”I haven’t seen him in over two months actually.. and yes, it does feel weird.” John looked down to the ground, kicked some gravel around with his foot. ”I’ve been trying to get him to meet up for a long time now, but he’s never available.” He smiled faintly, shrugged, then looked up at Mike again.
He noticed Sherlock observing him pensively.
John smiled. ”Only this,” he said. ”No big deal. And I’m not actually gay, you know.”
”What can I tell you, John,” Greg said. ”Of course I invited him, but, you know. It’s not like he’s bloody likely to show up.” He chuckled. ”Though maybe now with that boyfriend of his, who knows.”
”Oh for christ’s sake, John! Don’t you think it’s up to Sherlock to decide what he wants to do, he’s not a child! We’ve been out like this a thousand times, he
”Given your, er, size and all, maybe it would be better to start, er.. differently.”
He was sitting on the plane, not even bothering to fight the tears any longer, watching John Watson turn into a small dot on the ground below.
”Hmm, yes, I guess it was alright,” said Sherlock. ”Harry’s was rather nice, too. And the one your old boss from the hospital gave. I liked her.”
”Careful, I’m driving!” Sherlock yells, but John can see in the rear view mirror that the corners of his mouth are pulled up, eyes shining. It makes John smile, too. Oh how he’s missed him.
Rapidly begins to unbutton John’s shirt; top three buttons and then grabs the tails and pulls it over his head. Stares. John is running his hands along Sherlock’s sides, then to the back of his thighs, his arse.
The Commander and Sally look at him with surprise -contempt? - but say nothing. In the corner of his eye, John thinks he can see Sherlock smiling, and it fills him with a happy warmth, just the way it has always done.
Sherlock moaned at John's touch, his grip around John faltering. Although John was absolutely aching to come by now, it still felt worth it. Worth seeing Sherlock in this state, completely undone, sweaty and tousled and panting.
”Yes,” he says.
John smiles. ”Never been more sure in my life.” He's finally pulling Sherlock close to his body again. Hands skimming over Sherlock’s back, finding their way to his buttocks, and that is enough to make Sherlock’s cock begin to fill again.
John still had his face buried in Sherlock's neck, so there was no way of reading his facial expression. But Sherlock heard his breath get faster, more insistent.
John laughed. ”Not getting any younger, Sherlock. Need to keep this old body in shape.”
”I’m well skint, ya know. Not a penny. ’is is the first time I’ave somming to eat for days.” The kid is beginning to slow down his speech a bit. ”Was only try’n to fuckin’ survive.” More silence, then a sudden sob cuts through the transmission.
Had not wanted Sherlock to know.
“What do you think I'm doing,” Sherlock said a little bit irritably. “I'm ready!”
A slender, fair skinned man in his thirties was approaching the bar where they were standing. He had black framed glasses, and was wearing black jeans, a red wool cardigan and a t-shirt with a Pink Floyd print. Mark shook his hand while they exchanged a few pleasantries.
With a strong rum drink in one hand, and some wine spritzer thing in his other for Sherlock, he made his way back to their spot. His steps felt lighter and easier, until he realized he still had one more thing to get through. Does it never end, he thought. How on earth did this get so bloody complicated?
Eventually, John increased the pace, and Sherlock started to slowly meet his movements, pushing down further on John’s hand.
“You know better than to underestimate me, John. Of course I know what turns you on.”
”It was mean of me to say that. I feel bad.”
Mike looked at him with a mildly resigned expression.
”Sherlock,” John said, sighing.
”Not happening,” said John. He wasn’t amused anymore by this, because now he really, really, wanted to get back to the action with Sherlock. He got up from the bed, grabbed the dog’s collar.
John paused and drew a sharp breath, like he suddenly came to think about something.
”I-” said Sherlock, then went back into frozen mode.
After walking for thirty minutes, John still hadn’t even made it out of the city. The snow on the ground was reaching up over his ankles now, and for every step, he had to pull his foot free from the grip of the thick, wet snow into which it had sunk.
”Christ,” John gasps, then grabs Sherlock by his upper arms to twist his body towards the faint light coming from a nearby lamppost. Blackish blood, mostly coagulated, in a trail from somewhere around his left temple and down over the side of his face and neck. Blood stains on his white shirt collar. ”What the hell has happened to you?”
”Sherlock,” John spoke gently. He was still a little bit out of breath, his voice was hoarse. ’Look at me.”
And then the butterfly took flight; large wings majestically flapping to gather speed, and then it, indeed, glided for a long, beautiful moment before landing again a bit further away.
No one, that’s who.
"You have to understand, Sherlock - you shutting me out again, that's sort of my biggest fear here."
As the first hint of daylight finds its way through the windows, John stops. He lets his eyes travel across the kitchen. Everything has been cleaned, dried and placed in its right place. The mess has been divided into two piles of keep and throw away, neatly stacked in a corner, John’s pretty sure he’s got everything right. He’s wiped down all the surfaces with the disinfectant he found in the cupboard, even swiped the floor. Pleased, he tip-toes in to use the loo, then goes to lie down in the sofa again. This time, sleep comes instantly.
John’s hands were starting to shake. The keys to Baker Street. Was it possible that Sherlock knew John had been there? After a moment of trying to not freak out, John decided that that was, if not impossible, so at least improbable. Even taking into account that it was Sherlock he was dealing with here. John knew he had kept extremely quiet, and Sherlock had clearly been, er, distracted at the time.
Sherlock had a bit of a hard time adjusting to spending the night away from Baker Street, which made it more difficult than usual to go to sleep. His flat had been his sanctuary for so long, and even though this place was, objectively, much nicer in every way, and bigger and had two bathrooms and even a terrace overlooking Hyde Park, it still wasn’t easy.
”Down,” he said in a firm voice. The dog jumped down.
Sherlock’s still looking at the picture, then moves his hand to touch it. With his index finger, he slowly traces the contours of the Irish Setter in the photograph. Around him, everybody sits quietly waiting.
”Oh, nothing, love,” John smiled, then took another bite of his excellent steak. ”I’m just very happy to be sitting here with you.”
”That thing you said, a long time ago, at the bar… Do you really like it?”
“Oh fuck, Sherlock.“ John growled. “Fuck, I'm not going to last if you say things like that.” He leaned in to kiss him, deep, sloppily, and there was an urgency present between them now.
John sat back and listened as the woman he had married told him, for the first time, about her past.
He was feeling increasingly stressed about the time. This had taken much longer than he had expected, and it didn’t seem likely that he was going to be able to leave within the next hour or so.
”Just before the end of summer vacation, Victor sent me a telegram.”
, Sherlock thought, and then,
In the backseat, only John and him, a thick bullet proof shield between them and the driver. It seems surreal, sitting there with John less than an hour after saying what he’d thought was their last good bye.
”Can I kiss you?” John whispered, his heart beating in his throat.
”What else?”
Sherlock moved his hands to each side of John’s head, leaned down and kissed him.
Sherlock looked up eventually, met his eyes.
”Is fuckin’ arlas, is wha it is!” The kid’s voice is angry, John feels the worry intensify again. He thinks that this, what Sherlock is doing right now, is like walking a tight rope.
”When I was what?”
He let out a short, forged laugh.
John reread the text and felt grateful for the slight opening at the end. Better than nothing. He wrote:
So a committed relationship without sex - that, John just hadn’t been able to even consider. But in retrospect, a great many times, he had wished he just could have…
And Sherlock had thought that maybe, just this once, ignorance was bliss.
”What happened was fine; a good time was had by all, I believe, and that’s all there’s to it. Let’s not make a mountain out of a molehill here.”
John. He didn’t come. A memory from last night flashed before him. Of sitting around, waiting for John to show up.
”John, listen,” she says. I just want you to know how glad we are to have you back by Sherlock’s side. After you left, he just… you know. Wasn’t the same. And now that you are back, I just wanted to say that I hope, this time, we can all be… open with each other.”
”Ah, John. Fine, thanks. I’m fine.”
”Before… Before I met you,” Sherlock said, quietly. ”I didn’t know it was possible to miss someone so much that one could feel it physically.” He was still looking down. ”When you were gone, John. It was like a part of me was missing, too.”
”Yes. Yes it did.”
This was not some sort of ego stroking on John’s part, no. It was just a piece of knowledge he had learned over time. Sherlock would tell him things he wouldn’t otherwise say. He knew - because Sherlock had even admitted it - that he would talk to John, talk out loud, even when he wasn’t there. Wonder how it had been during all this time apart? Had he been talking this way to what’s-his-name? For some reason, John’s gut feeling told him no.
, and
And please remember, it's all a work of imagination, and all for fun. Nothing has anything to do with persons in real life!
And yet, when he'd asked him about Mary, John had only replied ’fine'.
Sherlock thought about his own uncried tears - for everything that had gone so wrong, and for everything that should have happened but never had.
Sherlock had done so many things for John, at the expense of his own wellbeing.
Feels an urgency to the point of desperation, because what if this is something that will only happen once in his life? Doesn’t have a clue how this came about, but knows that
Are there perhaps certain things in the bedroom that simply makes John feel 'too gay'?
There will be angst, hardcore fluff and ditto porn. Not necessarily in that order.
”Come off it, will you! You always do this. It’s impossible to have a decent conversation with you. Why can’t you discuss this with me like a normal person?”
. John was standing in the doorway, a bit out of breath, flustered.
Sherlock smiles. ”How could I possibly forget? We both fell asleep in hay full of manure. The stench of cows stayed in my hair for weeks after.”
He let his hands continue upwards, slowly, teasingly getting closer to where he knew Sherlock wanted to be touched.
The champagne helped,
He’d kissed Sherlock, that day when they were moving. Had just left Mary, fuming, with Rosie and the movers and all the still not packed boxes, and jumped in a taxi to Baker Street. Actually, Sherlock had kissed him. Which had been a detail he’d desperately tried to wrap his head around all this time, not succeeding.
”Sorry,” Sherlock manages, his cheeks burning. ”God, sorry, didn’t mean to-”
Sherlock’s mouth feels dry. Needs to be more precise, apparently.
”The night before I was leaving, an unpleasant, rough-looking man showed up in the garden, someone from way back in Mr Trevors past. They went away to talk, and when Mr Trevor didn’t return, Victor and I went to look for him. Found him, passed out drunk, in the kitchen. And for some reason that neither of us could comprehend at the time, it turned out Mr Trevor had given him a job at the estate, as gardener.”
Sherlock walks into the kitchen, then stops abruptly. It’s - clean. It’s actually more than clean, it’s… It’s the way it hasn’t been for a very long time. Not since… John. He lets his hand brush along the worktop. It feels nice. Not sticky, not crumbly, not grimy. Looks like a proper kitchen again.
”As I’ve tried to teach you, repeatedly, although you never seem to learn: It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has all the data. It invariably leads to-”
John has an arm wrapped around Sherlock, and is gently running his hand in small circles wherever he can reach. When John drifts into sleep a short moment later, his fingers are still nestled in the soft, damp curls on the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
When Sherlock was in prep school, he’d used to bite himself, sometimes, when the unrest inside threatened to eat him alive. Now, he just lies there.
John felt nauseated, he couldn’t speak. Deep inside him, Mycroft’s words unfortunately rang all too true.
He shook his head for emphasis, but the motion made him feel slightly sick. He stopped, drew a deep breath.
”It’s a little bit complicated,” he said. ”But I’ve ran into him a couple of times, and I mean, it’s not like we’re not friends or anything. It’s just- I don’t know, Greg.”
When they got back to the flat, they stumbled back into the unmade bed, still fully dressed. The cool bed linen and the darkness from the expensive black out curtains felt like a blessing. Sherlock woke up after forty minutes, uncomfortable and sweaty. He quickly undressed, downed a glass of water together with some ibuprofen and paracetamol, and then fell asleep again.
Sherlock’s heart was thumping, his mouth dry.
”So, that was refreshing,” Sherlock said, and John chuckled.
“Sherlock.” His voice was thick from sleep. ”It’s only four thirty here, can I call you back in two hours?”
First sensation: John’s body getting tenser, heart rate increasing.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied, causing John to giggle uncontrollably for a while.
Sherlock grabs his T-shirt to wipe his hand, his stomach. Wipes John’s hand too, sees John smile when he does.
And John closed his eyes and pushed his dick against Sherlock's pink opening.
Sherlock put his phone back down in his lap again, turning his attention back to Gabe.
“Don't be stupid. It's always been you, John Watson. Only you. You keep me right.”
,” is all he manages to catch before John is out of the room, and Sherlock’s heart is sinking in dark, muddy water again.
”Where’s Mike and Sherlock?” She takes a sip of her coffee, leans over to look at a photo of Kate Middleton, wearing a hat and holding a white rabbit.
Sherlock turned his gaze away from John's eyes, and instead directed it, in a most obvious way, directly at John's crotch. The worst part of it all was that it only caused John's jeans to strain a bit more. Damn it damn it damn it.
”Murdered any more animals, lately?” Sherlock said, with a straight face but an unmistakable glimpse in his eye.
********************
”I don’t,” smiled Gabe. ”But you have to admit he’s kind of hot.”
. This is why he shouldn’t drink that much. No - in fact, this is why he shouldn’t drink at all. Resolves to never drink another drop of alcohol again.
The screensaver was running, it was a computerized illustration of protein folding. On the screen, a long green string was slowly morphing into a three-dimensional structure, rotating around itself, now completely assembled into its native state.
”That was quite obvious. Even you should be able to see how.”
Sherlock was not at all prepared for how hard it would hit him.
He tried to get a grip on himself.
********************
”I’m sorry if I was the cause of that,” said Sherlock, almost whispering.
”Of course,” he says. What is this is all about? She gestures to him to follow her into the small laundry room just next to the hallway, where she stops, looking at him sternly.
, but that, unfortunately, was not good enough for John to accept.
”Looking young is a cross I have to bear, I’m afraid. I’m thirty-two.”
”God…” John whispers, and then realises he probably sounds a bit, well. Emotional. Maybe he is.
Coming back, a small tube of superglue successfully retrieved, John senses that the atmosphere has changed. Sherlock is still sitting where he left him, but is not looking up when he reenters the room. Choses to ignore it, and quickly sets to work bringing the edges of the cut together, as best as the circumstances allow.
Sherlock debated with himself, then reluctantly sat down again.
”Went back to London. I had a room at Montague Street back then. Spent the next seven weeks locked up in there, with my chemistry experiments. Victor tried to call, a number of times, but I guess…. I guess I didn’t.. pick up. I figured it would be better for them if I.. just… went away.”
By the time Gabriel had moved out of Baker Street and settled into his new flat in Knightsbridge, a month had passed and they were already so used to each other’s company that Sherlock had just sort of tagged along, without it ever being discussed.
John felt a wave of gratitude. Mike was a good friend.
It was winter in London, and an arctic chill held the city in an iron grip since a few days back. The snow on the streets was piling up, making the traffic slow and chaotic despite the frantic plowing and salting.
It was so incredibly intimate to be allowed to touch Sherlock like this, and John decided to lay down next to him instead. He needed more body contact, and got the feeling that Sherlock probably did, too, being quite exposed in the current position. He laid down on his side, and came face to face with Sherlock, who had turned simultaneously.
”Children? What about them?”
”Oh.” Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows. He looked taken aback, as if this was something he had not at all expected. ”Can’t you do that some other time?”
”No, I’m sorry Sherlock. I can’t. I realise that I’m popping up out from nowhere and all and I’m sorry, but I really, really don’t think you should be alone.” John realises he sounds worked up, tries to soften his voice. ”Please let me follow you home tonight.”
John was just returning his gaze, not really knowing what to say. In the back of his mind – no, actually right up front – a mad desire was gaining force. Good Lord, how it turned him on. Christ, how he wanted to do what Sherlock was asking. It took him all the self control he could muster to not physically throw himself at Sherlock right this moment.
”Very funny,” Sherlock says with a smirk. ”Mummy hid my coat somewhere and I haven’t had a chance to look for it. She says it’s too thin for this weather and that I’ll catch my death in it. One would think that after forty, one would be trusted to dress oneself.” He sighs dramatically.
The first night he’d spent at Baker Street, ten weeks after everything happened. That was when he’d found John’s note. Good thing he’d been alone.
As a child, he’d actually used to be heavily into butterflies for a period of time. Maybe he’d been around seven years old. He had read everything the local library had to offer, and then made Mummy use her connections with the university to order paper copies of articles in journals like
”No, I mean- Mary and I. We’ve agreed to take a break from the city. Decided to give Bingham a shot. Mary wants Rosie to grow up somewhere quieter, some place where there’s more nature and stuff and just an easier lifestyle and no commuting and-”
“John...” he said, it sounded both like a question and a plea.
… And Sherlock would have reached down, closed his fist around John’s erection-
It wasn’t so much the silence, no. It was the emptiness. It was the lingering memories, the shadows, the ghosts of the way life had been when John had been in it. The kettle boiling, a spoon clinking against the inside of porcelain. John’s footsteps in the stair; Sherlock had always been able to tell from the way John walked up the stairs how his day at work had been.
John reaches out, puts his hand on Sherlock’s arm, his throat tight. ”I’ve missed this. Missed you. Very much.”
"No you don't have to apologize. I, er, I think I know why you needed to. But it still gets to me sometimes, you know." John sighed, cupped his head, placed a kiss on his forehead. It felt so impossibly good being back in the bed with John's naked body, warming his. It even felt kind of good to talk about these things, because it meant he didn't have to wonder about it.
Earlier, Sherlock had heard the lid of the lube bottle being snapped open. John must have managed to apply more using just one hand, because he felt John’s fingers slide, deliciously slippery and warm, in and almost out of his hole. His hips were moving on their own accord now. Sherlock’s moans and grunts mixed with John’s heavy breathing and occasional encouraging words.
John felt lightheaded, like he was fainting.
”You did? You, eh, felt that way, before?” Sherlock asked.
But of course Sherlock still noticed every little detail about John, and he had quickly picked up on the fact that there was something slightly different with John’s behaviour tonight.
”In love?” John was struggling to keep a straight face in front of Mike now.
”Headset!” Sherlock shouts back, and almost instantly, two people are fitting him with a small headset, placing a phone in his coat pocket, and Sherlock drops the megaphone to the ground.
“What the fuck do you want?” Gabriel's face was full of contempt, but John was pretty certain there was a fair amount of fear there, as well.
He reached up as far as the shirt would allow, and then traced downwards, slowly taking in the shapes of convex and concave; of muscles and bones playing under John’s bare skin.
The room smells of Dettol disinfectant (lavender and orange), washing up liquid (apple), and John (too complex a scent to put into words). John who apparently still cares about Sherlock, enough to come with him, enough to stay up all night to clear up his mess. And enough to make it to his interview with two -no, probably just one, given the traffic situation at the last intersection this time of day- one minute to spare. In trousers that look like he’s been crawling around on the ground in them (because he did) and a wrinkly shirt that looks like he’s slept in it (because he has).
In a surprising turn of events, Dr. Riyat had turned out to share his passion for quantifiable measures. For the first two months, he’d encouraged Sherlock to keep a record of different situations and how they made him think and feel. It had been quite interesting, actually.
“I saw what you did! You killed this beautiful creature with your bare hands! People like you should be locked up!”
“I'm not!” Sherlock looked annoyed. He had his arms crossed tightly over his chest.
“Oh my god,” Sherlock whispered above him.
”It’s no big deal to lose a few toes. Fingers, on the other hand-”
More laughter.
In a vivid mental image, not just any man popped up, but Sherlock. He visualized Sherlock, on his knees in front of John in his chair, sucking him off. He saw himself stroking his hands through Sherlock’s soft dark curls, gripping them, guiding his movements and setting the pace. Imagined what Sherlock would be able to do with that usually so poisonous tongue of his.
”Well,” he forced himself to say. ”Then you should go get them.”
”But”, John continued, ”I guess I kind of knew that anyway. I just, er, didn’t really put too much thought into the matter. It never… came up.”
The pulse point just below his ear, a spot that Sherlock loved to put his lips against, feel the soft skin, inhale the familiar scent. Many times, he would look at Gabriel and see two simultaneous images: the grown man in front of him and the eighteen-year old boy he had once been.
* * *
”Oh, you don’t know?” Mrs Holmes says to John. ”That’s Victor Trevor.”
At first, Sherlock just lets himself be held, notices his heart rate coming down, minute by minute. Then, he puts both his arms around John, pulls him closer. John’s body against his, feels so good. Inhales the scent of him.
, before losing control, coming right down Sherlock’s throat and-
He unhooked the leash.
”Right, forgot about the hip,” John said. Sherlock had told him over dinner - which seemed like forever ago, not just a couple of hours. John has not had any contact with Mrs H either, not for years, and now he wonders how he’d been able to so completely shut off the people he once cared for so immensely.
”I want to fuck you.”
Sherlock has the megaphone in his hand within what John perceives as seconds. Then he turns to the officer standing nearest, a blonde pretty woman who doesn’t look a day over thirty.
What the hell, John thought and in quick succession poured the first and second and third shot down his throat. Anna had just turned three months old, and was sleeping significantly better at night, which made it so much easier to leave Mary on her own with the baby for a night. He’d have to make it up to her tomorrow though, but it was worth it. It was just nice to be out, chatting and laughing with his colleagues like old times.
that bloke? he wondered, curious but simultaneously annoyed with the burning feeling of jealousy that shot through him.
Sherlock held up an index finger in a warning gesture, not meeting John’s eye when he spoke.
John felt himself getting painfully hard, a tight strain towards his jeans.
Kicking him hard, without mercy. Losing control. It was the part of himself that frightened John more than anything, the part he’d worked hard to push away somewhere deep down inside. He’d thought he’d succeeded, but today had proved him wrong, once again.
- would have seemed almost too good to be true.
Slowly adjusting from the initial shock and disbelief, John started to take in more of what he was seeing. Who
The way his pectoral muscles flexed, hard and well defined, as John was moving his hands over Sherlock’s body, in big, sweeping strokes.
He stops abruptly, mid-sentence. ”Oh God.”
When they parted a short while later, John stopped at a spot where Sherlock couldn’t see him. He let his eyes linger on the tall skinny figure in the long dark coat as he made his way back to the black front door of 221b Baker Street. It was only after a while that John even noticed the sting at the back of his eyes.
he wondered, feeling a jolt of panic at the possibility.
“From the way it was looking, I think the living part can be debated,” John said, and Sherlock heard himself making a strangled sound in an effort not to laugh.
He had to do it, though. Might as well get it all cleaned out in one swipe, and then be done with it.
She puts it down on the coffee table with a heavy thump, squeezes in to sit down next to John in the sofa.
”I love you so much,” John whispered to his lips, and Sherlock practically melted inside. It was still hard to fully grasp that all this was real.
You sit here and basically tell me that you loved me, yeah, but this rather contradicts it, don’t you think! I must have meant nothing to you!”
Stood in front of Sherlock, posture straight, shoulders back. A soldier’s power stance, drilled into John’s entire being until it was completely automatic in threatening situations.
He stares at the screen for a moment, tries to think back. Can’t remember seeing anything from her, lately. Although, given the massive amount of texts he’s received from Rosie the last week… maybe it got lost somewhere between those?
”Don’t you worry about that now,” John said, and Sherlock sighed, then smiled.
”Pull yourself together, man!” Sherlock complained, but he was giggling, too. ”And do tell, because I’m dying to know. Why did you laugh, last night? As far as I know, there is nothing particularly funny with neither me nor my dick?”
”Perhaps you are a psychopath after all.”
The girl laughed again, seemed delighted. Perhaps she found the latin names funny sounding. Children were so unpredictable.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all your lovely support along the way of this little story. Your kudos and kind and encouraging comments have really brightened up my days, and made writing so much more fun. Thank you!!
”And I.. um. Things happened so fast last night, and I- I thought- I really don’t want to part without being upfront with you about-”
Sherlock watched as Gabe walked his fingertips lightly across his swollen cheek, checking the damage. It wasn’t right.
Who the hell is that? Nobody John’s mentioned, which makes it more concerning. Holds the phone in his hand for a moment. Yes, no? Yes.
”Hm.” John didn’t know what to say. His mind was running on high gear now, jealousy and regret mixing together with this new information. It confirmed what he had suspected, but it also added to it all in a bad way.
Another officer comes running towards them. ”We’ve got a face match on AFR. Name’s Daniel Russo, 23, in the records because of a car theft and DUI last year, sentenced to community service. Unemployed, last known address was at his mother’s in Liverpool but hasn’t lived there for years.”
They’d had sex very close to every night that John had spent at Baker Street. There had only been a handful of exceptions, and only because Sherlock had been in the most intensive phase of a case, and had been up working and forgetting the time, and then being startled by John coming into the kitchen for a quick cup of tea before going to work because apparently, it was already morning.
Ridiculous, he'd tried to tell himself. Sherlock and he had been friends, sure, very close friends and John was certain they’d always remain that way. Maybe they wouldn’t see each other as often, but that was certainly normal too, right? Life changes. Simple as that.
As he moved his hips, he came in contact with Sherlock's groin and was pleasantly surprised to notice he was already hard again. John reached down a hand and put it on top of him. As he touched him, Sherlock's cock immediately grew harder in his hand, making them both groan. It was amazing, being so intimately close to Sherlock.
”I’m sorry honey, but you look pale.”
Would he still have married Mary? And what about the other stuff? If he had known, known for sure, that Sherlock not only preferred men but also was human enough to want sex, even love.
“I'll deal with this, John, thank you for your kind concern,” Mycroft had said at the end of their brief conversation.
”I’m sorry, Mary,” he whispered to her.
Mary put her left hand on the back of John’s neck, let it rest there, looked at him with kind eyes.
John had never laid a hand on a woman, never in his life, and albeit very tempting, he wasn’t planning to start now. However, he walked up to her, in two brisk strides, got in really close, his hands in tight fists.
His eyes had quickly scanned over Sherlock’s entirely naked body, but now seemed to have gotten stuck on the one very prominent feature in the middle section. Sherlock was standing absolutely still, his head bowed down.
”Yes, of course. Rosie.”
”I’m sorry if I-”
”Sherlock,” John’s voice was gentle, kind, ”I am hardly going to shag someone who is crying.”
- Sherlock doesn’t know what to make of it. Worry begins to stir in his chest again.
In ideal weather conditions, the walk would probably take about an hour and a half. Now, he figured most likely three, maybe even more. John pulled the hood of his parka over his head and put on the gloves that he had shoved into his pocket this morning in a lucky guess. With a determined pace, he started to trudge through the ever building snow.
in imperative singularis, and
Sherlock observed Gabe as he sat slumped down in the chair across from him, uncharacteristically scruffy-looking. He hadn’t bothered with his hair today, dark circles under his eyes, his facial skin a bit red and blotchy, unshaven. He was dressed in a pink Lacoste polo with the print ’Game, Set and Match’ across the chest.
John felt his stomach twist upon hearing those words.
”I love him! You don’t understand the connection we have. And while I sympathize with your worry, this really has to be up to Sherlock to decide, not you.”
“Really? Tell me then.”
”Oh my god, I love you too,” he said, leaned over to meet him in a desperate, open-mouthed kiss.
”These people simply do not understand! A dog needs clear leadership, firm guidance, an alpha leader to show the way. In such a short amount of time, I have made progress with Sadie that they haven’t been able to do in years!”
”Oh god, I know that!” John interrupted, feeling horrible for Sherlock. ”You do not need to explain or excuse yourself to me. You know that, right?”
”Her? Wow, yeah, great. Well, it was really lovely to see you again Sherlock-”
She sighed, stepped away from the door.
It made for an entertaining five minutes, before the woman abruptly left with tears in her eyes. The man followed her, but not before spitting out a ’You belong in a mental institution!’ to Sherlock.
There is something else, something sharper, pointer, in John’s eyes as he says it, but Sherlock can’t put his finger on what. Also, it doesn’t help that John is using strange words that Sherlock has never heard of. Deducing John will have to wait a bit, he decides. He needs his focus now to get through telling this story.
Was that rhetorical?
John keeps twisting and turning him around to see better, to be able to evaluate, but the light is too poor. Takes up his phone and turns the flashlight on. A quick check of the wound, and then he aims the light into Sherlock’s eyes to check his pupillary response (
”No John, you really shouldn’t have,” Sherlock mumbles behind them. ”Pearls before swine, etcetera.”
Mycroft did not reply, but he nodded once and gave him a firm pat on his good shoulder.
John smiled again, and then moved to grab Sherlock in a strong grip. He coaxed him downwards until he was sitting up at the edge of the bed, and then, with his hands, John made him turn around. It resulted in Sherlock standing on all fours on the bed with his arse turned to John, who was now standing up next to it. Sherlock felt the bed sway as John put one heavy knee on the bed, next to his thigh.
The old alarm clock on the nightstand shows 11.35. Is alone in bed.
The moment had finally presented itself, and he would be damned not to take it.
”It’s been too long. Dinner Friday night?”
Things he had dreamt of having with John, but that had never happened and now never would.
”Then why are you here?”
Wanting to test out a little bit more about Sherlock's response to dominance, John gripped the soft curls at the back of his head and held them firmly. At the same time, he began to slide his fingers suggestively in and out of Sherlock's mouth. It pleased him to no end to see how these two things combined, turned Sherlock into an absolute trembling mess before him. His moans turned into whimpers; he was holding his body very still except for his hips, insistently grinding against John's belly.
She looked pleadingly at John, as if he was about to scold her for that.
”We sure are, love,” he smiled back, stroking his fingers through Sherlock’s unruly curls. ”We sure are.”
”Er, what is it that you want, then?” he asked. ”What do you want in your life that is currently missing?” Yes. That seemed like the appropriate thing to ask. Sherlock felt secretly pleased with himself. Great question. Caring, open ended.
“Oh my god, Sherlock. Bloody hell.” He fought to clear his mind enough to find the right words.
, John sometimes thinks.
”Since your brother told you about my promotion… can I assume he also told you about my divorce?” He held his breath for Sherlock’s response. It took a while before it came.
Hell, all he wanted was to be able to focus fully on Sherlock. He wanted to be allowed to resume his job of keeping him safe and well, and he needed to promptly eliminate the competition that had presented itself in the form of a smug, good for nothing junkie.
Sniffling sounds. Muffled.
At this point, Sherlock looked as if he was about to pass out or maybe have some sort of panic attack. John knew he had to do it, anyway.
”Danny. I’d do anythin’ for Greg. An’ I would really, really like to ’elp you too.”
John noticed Sherlock looking increasingly more uncomfortable, and that only spurred him on. He was certain now that he was on to something, and he was not going to let it go.
Surprised, John turned to her.
”Sherlock. Christ.” John swallowed, tried to focus his mind enough to speak coherently. ”You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. You’re absolutely gorgeous.”
”Yeah, that’s it,” John whispers. ”That’s it.” He still has his hands on Sherlock’s arse, guiding him into place as Sherlock sets the pace.
”I mean, thank you, but it is what it bloody is. Very soon, I will have to go back there, share a bed with an assassin nobody knows the real name of. Oh, and let’s not forget, who’s also having my child. So it’s pretty damn far from alright, the way I see it!”
“Hello to you, too,” John said, trying to sound as indifferent as he could.
”John, I’m very sorry,” he mumbled to his neck, unable to meet his eyes. ”Terrible shagging etiquette, that.” He felt absolutely mortified.
”Next YEAR?” Rosie says indignantly, then understands. Clever, clever little girl, John thinks proudly.
Finally, he sat down at the desk, took out a white notecard. On it he wrote:
Sherlock’s serious expression suddenly shifted, and instead, he smiled briefly, put his hand over his mouth.
“Doctor... Watson, was it. While it seems you acted out of moral obligation, I strongly suggest you leave matters like this to the park rangers, next time.”
John’s breath. Shallow, rapid, hot against him.
John tuned out their odd conversation. What had just happened? He had been one second away from kissing Sherlock. Would Sherlock have pulled away if they hadn’t been interrupted? John didn’t think so, and his entire body felt electric at the possibility.
- He abruptly turns around, pretends to look for something to keep Sherlock from noticing.
He hadn’t seen him for so long that the sharpness of his visual memories of Sherlock had begun to fade.
John happened to say out loud the first thing that came to his mind, because to be honest, at this point he was not really fit for conversation.
She was talking while scrolling through Instagram on her phone.
The realities they both had tried so hard to block out; they were still there.
The first time Gabriel had said it was when they had first tried penetrative sex. It was about a month after Gabe had leaned forward and kissed him and everything had changed. It had been a sunny Friday afternoon in October. Most of the other students had left for home over the weekend, but they had both told their parents that they needed to stay and study for the upcoming test.
In fact, the urge to say these words had only come over him a handful of times in his whole life, and only ever with two people. One was Gabriel, the other was John.
John decided to try the direct approach.
he repeated, lingering on every part of the word. “Where the hell did that come from?”
”No!” John hurried to say. ”Seriously, don’t! It’s almost eleven o’clock and it’s going to rain. If that dog runs off into the park-”
”John.” Sherlock stops in his tracks, and John stops too, turns towards him for the first time since they went outside. They’re on the side of the road, the light from a nearby house casting a faint light over them.
”Sherlock, please don’t do this. I’lI willingly admit, I’ve made so many mistakes I’ve lost count, but I don’t think it’s really fair to lay all of this on me. To be honest, I think I wanted you from the first day we met, but you know what Sherlock?”
********************
”Thanks Mark, but it really doesn’t matter. It’s just, you know, part of a game that I don’t care for that much anyway. The acting is what’s important to me.”
”Good,” Sherlock cut in, and John noticed through his haze that Sherlock was a bit breathless, too. ”Because I happen to share that sentiment.”
Slowly, carefully, John pulled out. Sherlock winced. He was going to feel this for a couple of days. John didn’t notice the pained expression on his face, because he was busy staring down at what was sure to be a graphic sight.
”Relax, John, god. It’s all good, top quality stuff, it’s fine,” he said, expecting this to calm John down.
”It overwhelmed you,” the therapist said, as a statement and not a question. ”The pain you felt when you thought you’d been rejected by this person that you love.”
Actually, he felt furious. What did he ever do to deserve Sherlock standing there and not even dignifying John with a word. Sherlock had been completely shutting him out of his life, avoiding him at all costs, lying about where he was just to get out of seeing John for a few hours - hours that John knew very well he would waste in front of his laptop daily, googling mutations of mold or whatever.
It was awkward, discussing this with him. John sure as hell hadn’t told him anything about what had happened between them, that night, and he didn’t think Sherlock had, either. Still, he still got a weird feeling that perhaps Greg knew. He tried to put it out of his mind, too embarrassed to consider that possibility.
”Was he your boyfriend?” John tries his absolute best to sound completely relaxed, upbeat even, as he says it, but on the inside, it’s such chaos he’s faintly worried he’s going to be sick.
Of course Sherlock noticed. And of course he had to comment on it, too, the annoying git.
However, he still felt insanely jealous. He had to find a way to reach through to Sherlock. It was unacceptable to just let that bloke have free reign.
”You don’t want to?” he asked quietly, causing John to let out a short, breathy laugh.
John chuckles, places another kiss in his hair. ”Not called a genius for nothing.”
”But it’s New Year’s Eve,” Harry says. ”Just going to sit there in your gloomy little place, then, alone with the bottle?”
”What? No! How could you even- no!”
Don’t want to end up like this again.
”Um-” he said.
”So it has nothing to do with failed mountaineering, then?”
Through the roar of his blood, he can hear himself breathe. It sounds like he’s running.
. He adds,
John made a vague gesture towards it.
”Have you thought about this, about us, before?” John murmurs into his ear, then moves to bite his neck.
He sighs, rolls his eyes for dramatic effect. ”It’s impossible to answer that question because the measurement lacks defined reference points. Also, establishing reliability and validity in a scale usually requires a minimum of three items per factor. With a single-item scale like the one you’re proposing, there’s no way to compute, for example, internal consistency reliability. The question of validity is also problematic, and would need to be established through examination of convergent validity, preferably with a physiological measure such as-”
John thinks about the house he shared with Mary, warm and thoughtfully decorated -by her, of course, maybe not exactly what he’d gone for but he’d liked it. Liked the comfort. Not much of that where he lives now.
Caroline laughs. ”At least she
”I take it you’re still not talking, then?” Greg asked, and John squirmed.
He doesn’t, of course. Instead, tries to go as much unnoticed as he can. Hides in corners, hides in the kitchen. When he couldn’t locate John, he hid for thirty minutes up in his old room. He sat on his bed, looking at John’s bag, feeling equal parts excited and embarrassed over the fact that his family are assuming things that are not true. Also embarrassed about the fact that he wishes they were. Pathetic. Should be able to settle for at least having John back as his friend.
The scene is so familiar: Sherlock, sitting on the toilet seat, head leaned back against the tiled wall. He has his eyes closed, occasionally squeezing them shut harder from pain.
As soon as the detox was underway, Sherlock had come back to reality. The hallucinations stopped, so did the paranoia. But he was tired, more tired than John had ever seen him, he slept and slept and slept.
”Fuck-” John’s hips momentarily loses the rhythm. ”Wish I’d known. Would have had you everywhere-”
“Here,” she said, reaching out her phone to him, with a defeated look on her face. “It's late. I imagine you want to call him.”
Mycroft's expression was stern.
The flat is covered in a soft, muffled silence, their breathing the only sound to be heard. Just the two of them, together in this place where the edges between past and the present seem to blur.
-” he hears John whisper. Sherlock pushes John’s hand away and replaces it with his own. Wraps his fingers around John’s cock and begins to stroke him, as hard and fast as he can manage from the position he’s in. The sound of John’s ragged breathing fills his ears.
”So fucking beautiful, you are. Can’t believe we’re doing this-”
He tried to shake off the uncomfortable feeling that had come over him. Could there be any truth in what she was saying?
He feels his body tensing. Shit, she’s met someone and she’s going to introduce Rosie-
With all his might, he pinched himself, pressed a piece of flesh together so hard it would surely leave a big mark. It still did not work.
”But, John… did you and Sherlock ever talk about, you know, relationships and stuff?”
John appeared to balance on the edge between angry and agitated, speaking in a voice a bit too loud. ”The truck is already at the house. They’re loading the boxes, right now as we speak. The whole place is chaos and there’s still stuff left to pack.”
”Go ahead, ask ’im how we met. He was the one who got me out of jail. Was Christmas, just like now. Me ma and pa was, like, done with me, me brother too. Got jibbed. But Greg helped. He got me out, got me some proper scran, some new clobber even. And some time later, he got me a job.”
”John,” Sherlock says again. ”Wasn’t your interview at ten?”
John felt sick, had to take take a few deep breaths to ground himself.
John saw Sherlock closing his eyes for a second, not making any attempt to move away from the touch. He was breathing so heavily that John could actually see his chest heaving underneath the thin shirt.
Leaning over as much as he did, he occasionally felt Sherlock’s cock brushing up against his stomach, and every time it happened, Sherlock would let out the most amazing noises. It was almost too much to bear.
This was exactly what everyone on his list had raised concerns about. Most, only as a vague hint; some, like Dr. Riyat, as a blunt question. Sherlock had argued, every time, tried to make them see that John wouldn’t do that to him. Tried to explain the kind of wonderful, unique sort of person that John really was. They had still seemed wary.
And he was standing on the tarmac, watching from outside, hearing himself make a bad joke about his name.
John waves his hand. ”Sorry, Sherlock, never mind. Please, go on.”
in imperative pluralis.”
As the thought came to mind, Sherlock went from happily relaxed to sharply apprehensive in no time at all.
John laughed. “Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Gripping the-”
”Yeah, you like that, don’t you?” John teases, and Sherlock just nods.
”Wasn’t necessary, he came around anyway,” Sherlock says. ”Anyone could have done what I did.”
And although he knows he shouldn’t, there’s also something else in all this that’s making his skin crawl.
Gabe rose to the challenge.
“Thanks,” he said, trying his very best to sound pleasant. “So, how is he? I've never asked. Has he, er, met someone?”
”Oh,” said Gabe, looking relieved. ”He’s been busy.”
* * *
Sherlock sighed, got up again, opened the door slightly. The dog barged in through the narrow crack, jumped up in the bed again, laid down with a heavy thump.
. You said starving, and I got the feeling maybe- you weren’t just talking about - food.”
His other hand on John’s back, sliding upwards, cupping John’s neck. Moved in closer, into a hug. They had never been this close before, not like this. He felt John relaxing into his arms, dared to lower his chin to rest it atop of John’s head. The scent of John was making him dizzy.
Leans forward to kiss him, sloppily, keeps massaging, pressing, and Sherlock groans into his mouth.
He’s still so hard it hurts. He turns on the tap to drown out the sound, then pushes his pyjama pants down to his thighs. With his chin lowered, resting against his chest, he takes himself in hand, sets a furious pace. Recalls how John’s cock felt against his leg… A shiver shoots down his spine.
”What is it that you are afraid of?” prompted Dr. Riyat, rousing Sherlock from his thoughts.
He walks up to her bed, sits down next to her, which makes her yell even louder.
”John,” Sherlock said breathlessly, having pulled away a few inches from John’s face. John looked at him and was met by heavy eyelids and hazy blue green eyes. ”John, have you figured out yet what I would like to do?”
Sherlock closed his eyes but couldn't help to let out an outdrawn, needy whimper.
Proud that he had not stopped moving forward, even when times had been at their darkest.
“Not so much deduced as observed,” he said, raising his eyebrows slightly. John felt a nervous flutter in his stomach, despite having been the one who had pushed this.
“What can I get you?” John asked as nicely as he could force himself to. Man, this was surreal.
The champagne turned up the buzz, and an hour later, John found himself standing with the others by a neon lit bar in the restaurant’s large outdoor space.
Everything is already in order, this breakfast has always been one of Daddy’s proudest moments as far as home making and traditions go. The usual things on the table, with scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon still on the cooker to keep hot.
Make or break, he briefly thought to himself before leaning over to pull her into a gentle hug. She tensed up but then relaxed, and he felt her thin arms wrap around his back.
John picks up the tumbler but doesn’t drink from it, just holds it, slowly swirling the content. ”You know, that thing you mentioned, before-”
John felt a strong desire to make this really good for Sherlock. He looked up, caught Sherlock's gaze. It was at once hazy and intense, and all of a sudden, John knew what he wanted to do.
Gabriel wrapped a long arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled him close.
”Please, John-” Sherlock stuttered out. ”I’m ready, fuck me now-”
His child. Wasn’t that the strangest concept. He had gone through almost forty years now, and in many ways, he was still thinking of himself as a child. Hell, he was often still treated like one, as well.
”It can be difficult,” she says after a while. ”It took me quite a while to get over my ex-husband, even though I was the one who ended it.” A pause. ”…maybe you still have some feelings for your ex?”
He turned to look at Sherlock, as he was standing next to him, watching as Greg moved between the friends that were all there to celebrate him. It dawned on John that he, not Greg, must have been the reason for Sherlock to show up this evening - he hated social events like this. John was suddenly so overcome with emotions that he had to turn away briefly to get them under control.
He notices John studying his face, thoughtfully. ”How are you feeling, now? Could you go back to sleep after I left?”
“You won't,” Sherlock replied, and then proceeded to push his body down towards John.
An unquantified amount of time later, Sherlock opened his eyes to meet John’s. Noticed that the post-coital daze was slowly subsiding, being replaced by a look of increasing worry.
Mary turned to John.
Right next to Sherlock, another student is seated. He’s dressed exactly the same, apart from the shoes. Golden hair, broad shoulders, a light tan and a smile that surely must have gotten him a lot of girls, John thinks as he studies the picture.
John thought about leaping up to Sherlock, wrapping his arms around him and never letting go. He wanted to take him by the hand and lead him home, home to Baker Street, and kiss him until they had forgotten everything else and there was nothing left but Sherlock and John and
For once, John felt uncharacteristically out of his depth, unexperienced, so unlike the rather strong confidence he had acquired over the years regarding his skills as a lover. But what John lacked in ability, he figured he could make up in effort. That was how he had gotten through Med School, and that was how he dealt with every challenge that life sent his way.
”Go sleep in the sofa,” he heard Sherlock whisper to the dog. ”Good girl!”
”I haven’t got the faintest.”
Sherlock exhales.
Sherlock has gone outside again to smoke, and perhaps John should be concerned but in the light of Sherlock’s previous vices, this one doesn’t seem worth the fight.
A moment later, Caroline starts to laugh, too. They’re in there, laughing together at his inadequacies and social shortcomings, and Sherlock closes his eyes in a vain attempt to protect himself from the sharp pain inside.
And then he finally woke up, was able to act. He yanked the door open and ran out in the corridor, heard the front door downstairs slam shut as he turned the corner in the sitting room.
It was just nice to be outside, enjoying this particularly splendid summer afternoon. Plus, he’d always liked dogs.
”Shut up Mycroft!” he shoots back, angry now. ”At least I weren’t too fat to fit in my school uniform.”
John feels dizzy, he notices that he’s so tense he’s trembling, his hands have gone icy cold. In the pit of his stomach, a very strange sensation, a jumble of panic and hope and confusion and anger and-
* * *
”John?” Rebecca pulls back a bit, her hand still warm on his leg. ”Is everything.. alright?”
”Yikes.”
”John, are you alright?” asked Mary, ever the perceptive one. John had to struggle with himself to speak.
********************
Mary saved him from himself, back when they met. He’s not sure if he’d still been alive if he hadn’t met her. At the same time, he can’t help but wonder how things had turned out, otherwise, had he still been there when Sherlock came back.
“I'm sorry I got a bit carried away... It's just that, oh, fuck. You turn me on like crazy, you know.”
He bucked his hips up, let out a drawn out
“But you are,” he said. “Why? Why is this embarrassing you, Sherlock, I haven't known you to be the blushing type. Come on. Tell me what you've deduced.”
There might have been a point in time when Sherlock would have happily accepted just about anything at all to have John back in his life again. A time when the idea of having John back both as a friend and as a- as some sort of- friend
Then John stopped, raised his head, looked Sherlock in the eye.
Seven days, eight hours and fifteen minutes, to be exact. The torture in Serbia had been easy compared to seven days and eight hours and fifteen minutes locked up with no one and nothing to save him from his spiraling desperation.
At some point, he would have to get Sherlock to talk about what he had gone through. Had there been other types of abuse as well? He knew all too well that many forms of torture did not leave visible scars.
But of course he could never shut up, no, not when John would first try to plea with him, coax him, but then become angry, his voice tenser, his breathing more controlled. And as expected, John had used his trump card.
Mike drew a deep breath. ”You know John, maybe this is completely unrelated to whatever is going on between the two of you. But the reason I’m telling you this is that I’ve also noticed Sherlock acting differently, these last couple of weeks. And it seems to keep getting worse. Molly sees it as well, and as you know, she’s a lot more perceptive than me about these things.”
Sherlock felt a little bit jolted by the sudden outburst of aggression from John. He intensely regretted having brought this up.
”For Christ’s sake, John!” Mike had spoken up at lunch one day, surprising him with an unusual level of frustration in his normally so mild tone. ”You’ve really got to get your act together. It’s been a year, and honestly, no one is going to do it for you. This job is just what you need, I’m telling you.”
”Stop… fussing,” he says, but with no real emphasis behind the words.
A crowd of ten to fifteen people had gathered around it, and from somewhere within it came a woman’s panicky screams. As John approached, he heard a man’s voice calling out.
This has not happened John very often, and when it has, there has always been a perfectly reasonable explanation. Like being completely pissed, for instance. But now, shit. He can’t count how many times he’s had that conversation with patients, always reassuring them that it’s something that happens to every guy once in a while, perfectly normal.
She laughs. ”See you next year, Daddy!”
Another sip, glass almost empty now. Head in a bit of a blur, he should probably stop drinking now.
Sherlock got up out of the bed. Got up so abruptly that his feet got caught in the sheets and he almost took a nose dive to the floor, but luckily, managed to free himself in time.
But wait. Another image from the night. Elusive. He tried to focus. It was from a hospital room. Not this one. Two chairs and an examining table. Lots of people there, talking in stern voices to him. ’You need to calm down, Mr. Holmes,’ someone had shouted. But there was something else in this memory, he felt certain. Something about John.
“I guess you just have to learn to choose your battles, John. They're idiots. I've learned a long time ago not to let them get to me.” He turned to John, and John was happy to feel Sherlock's hand brush against his knee.
********************
“John-” Sherlock interrupted. “I expressed myself poorly. I meant to say that I usually don't like people touching me. You, however-”
An eternity ago, Sherlock had allowed himself to think that it would last. That they would be living on Baker Street, together, for all years to come. That no matter what happened outside - rain, fire, criminals - it would be just the two of them, in their chairs, taking a well deserved rest in front of the glowing coal in the fireplace.
. John was leaving today.
He got her phone number, then started to jog towards the southern part of the park, closer to Baker Street. Approaching Boating Lake, an area where the open parkland turned a little more dense with trees, Sherlock heard a dog barking. The bark was consistent with the breed as well as the size and age of this particular dog. He sped up and kept moving in the direction of the sound.
. He just can’t take this. Sits up abruptly in the bed. ”John. I know what you are going to say, and frankly, I’d rather you just didn’t.”
”And after the fire, and in the train car. And on your stag night, and at your wedding, I got this ridiculous impulse to just say it, but then again, it was your wedding so it seemed kind of pointless… and at the tarmac, I came really close-”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. ”Why in God’s name would I want to do that?”
The days and nights had clearer borders now, were more defined, instead of seamlessly slipping into and out of each other like they had used to, before.
When Sherlock finally had been released from the hospital, Baker Street wasn’t empty, but it wasn’t how it once had been. John would hardly speak. He’d go to work, come home, usually with take-out enough for them both, and then spend the evening in silence, with his laptop and headphones.
Sherlock thinks that he can’t keep this up for much longer.
”We really don’t have to do this right now,” he mumbled. ”You know that, right? Given all that has happened and all, perhaps it would be best to-”
”Go to sleep, Sadie,” he called, pleadingly. The only result was that the dog now started to whine on top of the scratching.
”Yes…” John murmurs back. ”God, I can’t wait. You have no idea how much I want you.”
He had still cried that night, slumped down on the bathroom floor.
John let one hand fall heavy down onto Sherlock's cock, and felt a sense of pride when he found it hard and hot. This time, Sherlock briefly leaned his head back and moaned. Hearing this sound from Sherlock, this sexual, needy exclamation, made John shiver. He let his fingertips play along Sherlock's shaft, then pressed his hand down harder against it.
”That’s the plan, more or less.”
”Well,” Sherlock says. ”Best of luck with your interview tomorrow. They’d be lucky to have you.”
That was what he'd said. What a load of crap.
John’s cheeks heated up, again. Oh it was getting bloody tiresome, that.
”It was a lovely speech your mother held,” said John. ”Funny and clever. It’s easy to see where you got it from.”
John looked at Sherlock and was taken aback by how beautiful he was. The colored lights were playing across his face, over his pale skin. His dark hair had some kind of product in it, it was gleaming and John wanted to touch it. They were standing so close to each other that their arms were touching, and John could feel the scent of
The hours in the pub had passed so quickly, and now it was almost midnight. Although he definitely felt more sober now, he was still swaying a bit when he walked.
“Alright, so maybe it does. So what. I guess you missed that talking about sex is also on my list of turn-ons.” He met Sherlock's gaze and was very pleased to see that he'd managed to get him to waver. Only for less than a second, but still. A small victory. He was going to take back control of this thing.
Thankfully, she always had been. Mary seemed to never cross that line, and eventually, John was able to relax a bit in that knowledge. He still worried, though, about how Mary would react when he’d move out.
”What?” Sherlock asks, appears a bit bothered by the attention. John lets go of his hand.
”I’m glad to hear that,” John said gently. He was. He shifted a bit in his chair, trying to find another way to place his legs under the small table.
”Then why don’t you go over there to provide some loving comfort, John? You seem to be quite the expert at that, from what I gather,” Gabe said bitterly.
John repeated the motion, now with more precision. Slowly, slowly, he moved his hips so that his cock glided along the length of Sherlock's. It caused his entire body to tense in anticipation.
”Don’t. Don’t bring Janine into this, that was a completely different thing.”
John shook his head, exhaled slowly. “I hit him, Greg. Hit him hard.”
It was a great relief to finally be on his own, alone with his spinning mind. He got out of his clothes and stepped into the shower, exhaling as the hot water enclosed him.
The woman turned her head to look around.
Waiting for a chance to give his order to the bartender, John thought that he’d rather have a root canal, anyway, any day, instead of struggling through this kind of conversation. But then it dawned on him what he had accomplished. He’d managed to tell Sherlock! This should be a cause for celebration, not agony. Now he knows!
”Erlock!” the girl exclaimed.
A very brief reference to self-harm in this chapter.
They’re dark brown with some sort of fur lining, but he honestly doesn’t have the faintest idea of what else to make of that. Sherlock would of course have been able to deduce her entire life story from them. John gets.. a bit fuzzy inside, when he thinks about it.
In the early morning hours, John awoke. For a blissful few seconds, he did not remember, but when it all came back to him, it felt like a knife stab in the guts.
, John thought.
, but surely that wouldn’t please Sherlock. But oh how it hurt now-
The uncomfortable feeling in his stomach was quickly escalating into fear.
And in the privacy of Baker Street, nothing was standing in their way.
John looked down. He was hiding something, but what? Something about gay sex, Sherlock deduced. The only thing in this world that could make John Watson blush, he knew that since long before. Maybe it was just too difficult for John to say. He’d figure it out later.
The ride out to the airport, armed security agent by his side. Numbness had claimed him, he was calm, felt nothing. He was leaving, no way out, nothing to fight. It was the way it had to be, the price he had willingly accepted for keeping John safe and happy.
”Morning,” John mumbles, feels his heart sing.
”Do you miss it?” he asked. ”Do you miss working there?”
John laughed a little, too. It felt good, breaking the awkward tension that had been building up between them as Sherlock had rattled off his far too accurate deductions.
”What, John?” Sherlock was panting heavily. He knew what John was trying to ask, but couldn't understand why was he being so impossibly vague about it.
He was jolted alive by the wave of panic that hit him when he looked at the screen. The clock showed 01:10.
“That is not what I'm referring to. John, allow me to be blunt. To my brother, you were the sun in his universe. For five bloody years, you were all he ever talked about. The only one he would listen to. When you walked into a room, you were all he would see. And yet! Who was it that gracefully accepted to be the best man at your wedding? Who stood by you in every step of the way towards your marriage to Mary? Who even took a man’s life to keep you and Mary safe? My brother, the dragon slayer.”
Beautiful, brilliant Sherlock, who melted John’s heart when he turned to him and smiled.
Everybody was facing Mark, though he didn’t seem to notice.
John locks his eyes on Sherlock, decisively. Makes sure to wipe away the grin, schools his face into a stern expression. He sees Sherlock’s smirk disappearing, his eyes widening.
”What time is it?”
At that, it was John's turn to well up. He walked up to her, pulled her into a hug.
Sherlock felt that sinking feeling return. He had to ask, even though he dreaded the answer.
”And guess who’s here, John!” he said in a sing-song voice to John’s ear, quiet but still loud enough for John to hear over the music. Greg leaned back and met John’s eyes, smiled suggestively, and John damned himself for blushing.
There had been some new detective series that Mary had wanted them to watch, but thankfully she had fallen asleep on the sofa just fifteen minutes in. John spread a blanket over her, turned the telly off, and made his way upstairs. He took a quick look to see that Anna was doing alright in her crib, and then went into the upstairs bathroom, locking the door behind him.
John is opening and closing his mouth for a while. Maybe he
Whereas Sherlock had a unique type of beauty, the man next to him was good looking in a more conventional way. His face was clean shaven, with high cheekbones and an angular jaw. His smile had a boyish charm to it, small dimples forming at his cheeks, and revealed a set of perfectly straight, white teeth.
”John!” Mary hissed from across the table. He didn’t care.
”What- no!” John said. ”Of course not. But-”
”Hey,” he says. ”You awake under there?”
John reached into his pocket.
Or was it wrong to show his hand so quickly? Perhaps he should have held back his feelings a bit more? Maybe if he hadn’t tried to have that conversation - but then again, Sherlock seemed pissed off with him before he’d even began. No way to know.
“To freedom.” John emptied his glass, coughing a bit as the strong liquor made it's way down his throat.
On the - fairy few and far in between - occasions Sherlock’s had sex in recent years, it’s never been with someone he knows this well. Trusts this wholeheartedly. Had forgotten how different it was; almost like another thing all together.
Sherlock didn’t think Billy would really fit into this clean, modern space, but he kept that to himself. ”I’ll consider it."
”Can we go back inside? If you want, I’ll tell you the story, later tonight.”
Greg nodded. “You did what you had to, John. If you hadn’t, there’s a high chance we’d be dealing with a murder right now, and not just this.”
, John.
“No, of course not,” he interrupted, and tried to look as if he meant it. “That would be ridiculous. Of course he should come. He's welcome to come in, too, if you want to invite him up,” said John, intensely praying that wouldn't happen.
John let his dick slide out of his mouth. ”I’m getting there, love,” he said in a raspy voice. ”Just have some other things to do first.”
But then he can’t continue, although he wants to - or rather, feels that he needs to, to make John understand.
. And then John got angry and they fought about it, and John rambled on about how the money was good (which was true, incidentally. They swam in money now, in a way that they had never, before) and how he needed to have a meaningful occupation, and blah blah blah.
They ended up kissing in the sofa for a long time. Just as John was going to offer to make some tea, Sherlock looked up at him.
Sherlock’s voice comes out as barely a whisper. ”Good.”
Oh Sherlock.
”The finest
They haven’t talked about what has just happened, but then again, neither of them is the talking type and the review can wait.
”I didn’t know.”
” Sherlock whispers as they’re finding a rhythm.
- he’d never thought any of this could be possible. John laughs.
”Janine wanted to get rid of the cottage. You know, it was too much work for her, and she was never there anyway. And we both love to be there. So I thought… Your name is on the contract for fifty percent of the ownership. I hope you don’t mind. I know maybe I should have asked you, but I wanted it to be a surprise…”
Without planning to, Sherlock found he had moved his hands to hold onto John’s hipbones, where they protruded through muscles and skin and blue denim jeans. And oh dear god, John was not late to follow.
With a shopping bag in each hand and a slightly elevated pulse, John stepped out on the London streets and began to make his way to 221B Baker Street.
”I haven’t, erm, showered, or, you know-”
been yesterday, and that he could get another try. So many things he would do differently.
However, seeing the damage on Gabe’s face made him angry. John had no right, taking out his anger with Sherlock on him. Hell, what even gave John the right to try to control Sherlock like that.
And then, in the morning, he would put one foot in front of the other, again and again, and do all the things he deemed necessary. After that, who knew what would await him down the road. He didn’t particularly care.
, he thought,
Everything had felt so
And the odd chance, no matter how small, of getting to spend some time with Sherlock, well that was too good to pass up. But, being trapped for an evening seeing Sherlock with that bloke - just the thought of that almost made him feel sick.
. That was what John had said, last night. Now he remembers.
gained speed, Sherlock averted his eyes, buried his face in John’s neck. He felt a blush starting to spread across his cheeks, and regret building in his chest.
John looked up to the sky for a moment, sighed, a heavy exhale.
The girl must have sensed his excitement, because this time she didn’t giggle at the name.
The unrest in Sherlock’s stomach is getting worse; is beginning to spread to his chest and to his throat, restricting his airways just a little bit. This is not at all going the way he was intending, and he has to do something to turn it around.
The words were spoken so nicely, but Sherlock’s stomach still tied in knots when he heard it.
”If I have done something wrong, please tell me so I can make it better.”
In the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw John following the exchange with ill concealed amusement. He still had the rabbit in his hand. The dog had given up, and had lain down practically on top of John's shoes, panting heavily with it's tongue out.
“I wasn’t coming back. That was the whole point. Mycroft said the mission would mean my guaranteed death within six months.”
Eventually, John got up from the bed, went into the bathroom. Sherlock could hear him brush his teeth, then getting into the shower.
John laughs a little again; Sherlock sees his cheeks turning pink, his pupils blown.
But then Sherlock stops laughing, relaxes under his grip, and John lets go of his hands. For a moment, everything stills. They’re silently looking at each other, and John sees Sherlock’s eyes shining with love and desire.
He’d heeded their advice, anyway. Did not trust himself to know what was right, anymore.
Then, he heard John’s steps approaching. He came up to Sherlock, stood behind him. Sherlock did not move, just kept facing the kitchen counter, desperately trying to collect himself enough to be able to turn around to face John.
And when Sherlock sits up, folds his long muscular legs underneath himself and then begins to crawl downwards, John grabs a fistful of the white sheet, squeezes the fabric tight to ground himself.
But Sherlock loved it. John had been amazed to see how Sherlock had instantly seemed to relax when they got out there. It was as if all the tension and anxiety that would normally haunt him, would just wash off as they stepped out of the Land Rover and onto the graveled driveway of the small, privately located cottage.
Sherlock breaks away from the kiss. ”John, I-”
He just wasn’t used to this, and hearing Sherlock - Sherlock! - complimenting his dick as he was sitting naked on top of him, well, that was more than enough to make his cheeks heat up.
“No, love, I'm pretty sure it's you he wants to see.” John did his best impression of a smile.
She kept talking about treatments and statistics and what the latest research suggested, but John found himself unable to pay attention, his mind constantly drifting off to the last couple of months and the very uncomfortable feeling in his stomach.
Waves of guilt came crushing down, made it difficult to breathe. He should have pushed Mary harder for her phone, he thought. Or he could have taken his laptop and sent Sherlock an email, if he'd only had the presence of mind to think of it. And how could he have been so stupid to think the talk with Mary would be so quickly over with, made promises he couldn't keep.
”Good,” she says, then hushes her voice even more. ”I don’t know why Sherlock finds it so difficult, with us. Daddy and I, I mean.”
John was placing more kisses along his back, as if it could make the scars go away. He then wrapped his arms around him, held him impossibly tight. Sherlock squirmed to turn around on the bed, stretched out his long legs on each side of John, and hugged him back.
Sherlock smiled, seemed to relax.
Sherlock's words and the intense intimacy of it all went straight to John's dick. He reached down a hand inside his pants, gave it a few rapid strokes just to ease a bit of the maddening tension that was building up.
It looks like Sherlock is smiling, but he buries his face in John’s neck before he can really tell.
”Losing you was the worst thing that I have EVER been through. I was so fucking angry with you Sherlock, that you could do something like that to me, I just can’t-”
John had seriously had it with these misunderstandings.
”Wait,” John whispers, breathily. Wrangles himself to a more upright position. ”Sherlock, what- what are we doing?”
His arms were tightly wrapped around John’s back; it was drenched in sweat.
It could have been awkward, leaving the sofa and walking upstairs together, but it’s not. It is, however, not so easy to get his feet to cooperate - a wee bit difficult to walk quietly. Or straight.
He felt Sherlock’s body move in closer against his own, felt the heat and the tension rising between them. Noticed Sherlock’s respiration quicken and become more shallow, as he kept on kissing him, slow and wantingly.
”There you are! Fuck’s sake, been looking all over. Called you like ten times.”
Mycroft looked very angry again.
”Oh, right, forgive me,” Sherlock begins. ”Can I get you something? I'm afraid there’s not much to eat but, um. Some tea perhaps?”
She had her arms crossed, a cold smile glued onto her face.
”John…” he began. ”I know you lived with Sherlock for a long time, and I don’t want to make it sound like I know him better than you, Lord knows I don’t. In fact, I hardly understand a thing about what goes on in that man’s brain.” He chuckled, then paused, searching for words.
John tries to replace the image with something else but instead, the emerging panic just grows stronger in his chest.
”Oh but we both know that’s what this is all about, John. I told you in the taxi, I saw it. Everyone could see it. You had jealousy written all over your face. And then you went to see him last night, of course, and now you think-” she paused, shook her head, smiling.
John kept looking at him.
Smells coffee and bacon, suddenly recognises that curious sensation of actually being hungry. Still hesitates, though, because- how should he act? Had preferred greatly to get a moment alone with John. Thinks that perhaps he should wait until that’s possible.
But instead he had not only accepted, but had been making a significant effort to be nice when he was over, being so friendly, laughing with Mary, complementing her looks even (
”You’ll be pleased to hear that I didn’t! So I guess that makes it a good day for you and a bad for me!” Greg was smiling, and John winced a little when Greg leaned in way too close to his ear, in that way that people only did when drunk.
Jealous as a friend, well, yes, maybe so. He had known instinctively that John would have a hard time adjusting to the dull, ordinary, family oriented lifestyle in the suburbs. But John knew Gabe wasn’t coming along with him on cases. It was not like he had replaced John on that account.
Where
This was all John had been thinking about during his taxi ride back home, and he had fallen asleep, exhausted, next to Mary, filled with fantasies of what it would be like to take it further next time-
”I don’t think one is supposed to, frankly,” John smiled. ”Besides, I have a very vivid memory of you, sitting on the bed last night, assuring me that you were absolutely not drunk but just ’a tiny bit tipsy’.” John fought an attack of laughter. ”And do you remember what you did right after that, love?”
”Like in the porn flicks,” he gasped, then wondering why he’d said that, realizing that perhaps Sherlock, being Sherlock, had never watched porn. He needn’t have worried.
”Attention everyone! We’ve got a major motion picture heartthrob coming our way!”
He blew a careful, soft puff of air towards the butterfly. It didn’t move.
”Don’t see it.”
”I want to hear all about it, later,” he said, and John didn’t reply. Instead, he just looked down again, marveled at what he was allowed to do with his hand, and at the reactions it elicited from Sherlock.
”Just precious, wouldn’t you agree?” Mrs Holmes says. John can’t take his eyes off the picture.
This is the first time in many years that he’s here for the Christmas Eve madness. Has usually shunned it like the plague, but this year, it was difficult to refuse, what with Daddy’s coronary bypass last summer and all. Time’s running out, he knows it. Tries his best not to think about that so much, it’s just the way life goes. Still, chose to come, this year.
, Sherlock thinks, but doesn’t say it. Doesn’t want to give Mycroft the satisfaction of seeing him affected.
Sherlock twists his torso, manages to stretch his arm just far enough to open the bedside table drawer. Turns back to drop lube and an unopened ten-pack of condoms on the bed. This conjures a few fleeting mental images about Sherlock and his sexual history - the one John up until a few days ago didn’t think existed - but he’s too turned on right now to let himself get distracted by that.
.. that was what his mates in the army had begun to call him, after a while. He’d acted like he hated it, would never in a million years have admitted that it actually had made him secretly proud.
"Still, though," she says. "That’s no excuse for him to fuck you up like this. He must have known how you’d react. Pisses me off, to be honest.”
”It’s obviously nothing near what you just gave me, but then that would be a bit hard to match. I hope you’ll like it anyway.” He looked expectantly at John.
For reasons unknown, someone had put a flower garland of that Hawaiian type around Greg’s neck. He was wearing a white shirt and was grinning happily as he pulled John into a hug that almost squeezed the wind out of him.
He runs his hand over Sherlock’s hair, vainly tries to push the curls in place.
From the window in his office, John had already seen a very near crash when a taxi had failed to slow down in time for the red light. Although in London, the cabbies were usually excellent drivers, many of them were still inexperienced with how to handle the car in heavy snow.
The evening has dragged on forever; in fact, this day feels more like a week, and Sherlock can’t wait for the others to finally just go away. But when, at last, Mycroft and Caroline say goodnight and disappear upstairs, Sherlock realises that now there’s just John and him left in the sitting room - and that, in all likelihood, means he’s going to have to finish what he started on their walk.
Beautiful, John thought. He’d never considered dicks to be aesthetically pleasing, but this… even Sherlock’s cock was beautiful. The top of the head was glistening with moisture already, and John felt a sudden, very strong urge to take it in his mouth, taste it. He’d never done anything like that before, however, so maybe it would have to wait.
In a passing memory from what felt like ages ago, he could hear Sherlock's smiling baritone voice.
”Don’t be ridiculous. It was just sex.”
”No, what would you like to do?” he panted, still careful to keep his voice level down to a whisper.
“Do you have, er- “ John paused for a second, caught his breath. “We need a condom. And lube.”
Or maybe it was just the absolute overload of the situation and the realities of it all.
Flickers through images in his mind - the way their bodies had moved together- the taste of John’s skin - the overload of all his senses when John had taken him into his mouth- John’s come on his hand, his chest-
So, it was nice, having John look at him like that. The last few days, since after that fight, had been hard. John had spent almost all his time working, just coming back to sleep, basically.
“Sherlock!” he whispered, fully turned away from the people around him. His eyes were shining, and Sherlock thought that hearing his name in John’s voice, was a more beautiful sound than any music ever composed.
John? Didn’t notice him getting up. Why has he left? Everything had been so much better if he’d been here, because then he’d been able to assess how John is going to go about it all, now, after… after all this.
She stops, looks at him anxiously.
John didn’t even reflect on the fact that he hadn’t felt any urge to correct Luigi in his assumption that Sherlock was his boyfriend.
But he hadn’t given in to the obvious solution.
He exhaled, sending hot air through the fabric and Sherlock's breath hitched.
Sherlock’s eyes widen. ”Tell me.”
”What do you want me to do?” he whispered, head all dizzy. He wondered if he was going to actually faint.
”Oh, I’m so terribly sorry last week was stressful for you. Because, you know, I just had the time of my life, socializing undercover with those lovely mafia bosses.” He scoffed.
”Maybe I am,” said Sherlock, holding his gaze for just a beat too long, and John thought that there really was no mistaking.
