Tony groans and rolls his shoulders again. This late, Steve’s probably already in bed. And with having to get up so early, Tony’s not even going to get a good morning snuggle or snog or anything. Maybe going to bed is a wash. He could go down and get a head-start on the latest software patches for their GPS, or maybe work out just why exactly the targeting system in the left repulsor has been on the fritz. It’s six hours to California. That’s enough time to just sleep on the plane, and there’s always concealer for under-eye bags.
Steve answered, groaning and shifting his weight, getting better leverage, pressing in and in and out and in.
The elevator arrives at the penthouse, but Tony can’t seem to find the energy to unpeel himself from the wall. Eyes drooping, he considers just curling up to sleep right here.
It hits Tony in an instant, and suddenly he understands why Steve drank so much, why he’s being so pushy and insistent. “Oh, babe. You know, you know I can say no to them. I’ll say no to them. I don’t have to go.”
“Just gonna help you relax a little more. You just keep your eyes closed, ok? Go to sleep if you can.”
All the time that had expanded in the lead up to the collision of ball and glove collapses in with a whoosh and Steve’s hands drop, absolutely gobsmacked. “What. The. Fuck? Jesus fucking Christ on a shit cracker, what the fuck have I done? Fuck me. Fuck fuck fuck.”
“What does that even leave?” Steve asks, but Bucky’s already walked past Tony, tossing off a careless wave as he exits. After a moment, Steve crosses to Tony and hauls him to his feet, smiling wryly. “Glad I could amuse you.”
fighting your opponent and trying to outmaneuver and outsmart him. That’s a lot to ask, especially with such a dangerous opponent. So using radio waves, I’ve linked in a new control interface which I’ll be operating from here.”
“What time is it anyway?” Tony asks, sitting up and giving Steve an eyeful of flexed abdomen and blacksmith’s muscle.
“No. And I didn’t think to get his number since, you know,” Steve says, gesturing at the space between his door and Tony’s. “Didn’t think I’d have trouble finding him.”
At that, Tony loses it. He snorts, and then giggles, and then bursts into all out laughter, collapsing to his knees when his stomach can no longer support him.
Steve hears the bathroom door close, but he doesn’t bother to open his eyes. It hardly seems worth the effort. It’s only when he hears Tony’s raised voice that he rouses himself a little, blinking around at the door. Through it, he can only catch about one word out of five, but they sound agitated. “(Muffle rumble muffle) idiot (muffle growl muffle) can’t believe (growl expletive mumble) fucking hell.”
He perks up a little when two guys manage to get out onto the bases, both of them toeing dangerous leads in hopes of scoring a run. And then Steve whoops. “Come on, Murphy. Give those Yanks whatfor. Make ‘em cry for their mamas.”
“You’re one to talk,” Tony huffs back, spacing his words between complimentary whines and grunts. “You just assaulted, like, ten emergency personnel.”
Behind him, Bucky slaps Steve’s shoulder. “This guy majored in studio art and spent his off hours getting into fist fights with bros who didn’t know how to take ‘no’ for an answer. I don’t think you need to worry about bro-culture.”
“On the one hand, I think a test run wouldn’t be amiss, but I’m also concerned with you hurting yourself before the battle. It’s your call, Colonel.”
“I’m from Manhattan. And I didn’t say I didn’t like it. My exact words were, ‘What a mouth on you, Rogers.’” Tony leers a little, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. “I think that’s really quite a compliment, don’t you?”
“I doubt it. I’m still in black sheep land, and I think they’re maybe going to Cancun or something.”
In the sandbox, the little bot scanned back and forth with infrared and ground-penetrating sonar and blessedly, beautifully, it located the payload. The shovel arm activated and started digging. Tony nearly wept.
Within the crypt was an ornate coffin dressed in gold leaf, etched with scenes of battle. A weapon. Steve needed a weapon. There! A torch. A stake, once he snapped the wood, muttering his prayer over the wood, ragged and sharp. “Panem nostrum,” he said, gripping the heavy lid with his free hand. The vampires crawled behind him on the floor, all of them looking sunken and dry as desert mummies as the prayer did its work. With a mighty heave, the last of his strength, it seemed, Steve yanked the coffin lid aside. Without pause he drove his makeshift stake down down down for the heart. Beheading could come after the thing was subdued. A scream. A crash.
Sam shushes him, but they’re all still giggling like idiots. “Tony!” Steve whispers, but it’s not really a whisper. Too loud for that. It’s more like…
“I’m not sure if that would be any kind of story. Man gets sick in Romanian town. Lives in the lap of luxury. I don’t think the readers would much enjoy that.”
Unthinking, he dashes from the cab while it’s still in motion, rolling across the pavement and pushing himself up to a sprint before the taxi driver’s even begun to cuss him out. There are a few firefighters forming a perimeter around the building, but he barrels through them like a linebacker. Mrs. Sullivan is huddled in the ambulance under an orange shock blanket, and her husband is glowering beside her, staring up at the building. Closer to the door, the landlord is chatting with a police officer.
“OoooK?” Steve is still blinking, trying to make sense of the guy’s million-mile-an-hour motormouth.
For some reason, Steve was reminded of the rumors he’d heard last year about a German officer, Kriminalrat Blut. Blut, it had been rumored among the ranks, claimed he was a vampire, that he drank blood, was active only at night, and could transform into any number of things, including bats, wolves, and mist. Like many of the occult rumors flying around Hitler’s upper echelons, Philips had been dismissive, but Tony, Steve remembered, had been a little more apprehensive.
“Pater noster. Pater noster. Pater noster.” Steve whispered, but his world was being consumed by Tony’s icy eyes. Tony’s icy, beautiful eyes.
Tony gasped as Steve’s hands circled closer to where he most wanted them. “Could grow it back. For you. You might like–ah–everything down south though.”
At just that moment, Thor appears, dressed in normal Earth clothes and breathless, and he slips in through the hole the bird thing has put into Tony’s beautiful tower. “Anthony! A most fortuitous blessing upon you. Steven must be so pleased.”
“I…I…what? You call this a blessing?” Tony gestures to his trashed bedroom, the candles melting onto the carpeting (thank god nothing is on fire yet) and the flowers now being tugged through the air by the draft. Thor steps further into the room, glass crunching underfoot.
Tony lets himself into Steve’s apartment without knocking, and revels for a moment just inside the door, savoring the fact that they’ve grown so close. His little fire hiccup has done wonders for their relationship, and Tony’s never really felt this way about anyone before. He’s thinking about asking Steve to move in; he knows his apartment has the better light, and it’s bigger, too. They could convert his parts storage room into a studio and rent out a storage space so that Tony isn’t forever dragging motor oil over every surface. Steve probably wouldn’t like motor oil on his paintings.
Tony continues talking even as Steve gathers up supplies and starts heaping them into his fabric supermarket bags. He snatches his vacuum out of the closet, and turns to Tony, offering everything he’s got.
“For that, Sir, you would need a private airstrip as well, and unfortunately, that is prohibitively expensive in New York City, even for you.”
Steve’s not sure whether he should laugh or cry. He takes another glance around the room and finally locates the sink. “Hold on just a second,” he says, carefully tiptoeing back out. “I need to make a call.”
And then the presents get doled out. A small mountain appears before him and he feels queasy with both residual illness and apprehension. “I didn’t have a chance to—”
him, of spending weeks humping through the wilderness with him, seemed almost like a vacation compared to Steve’s usual missions to destroy Nazi facilities and do away with dastardly experiments.
Tony’s already shoving his way over scattered mechanical parts and at least three laptops, dropping the bags on top of his coffee table, which is also covered in a layer of circuit boards and soldering wire. “Jesus fucking Christ,” Steve says as he steps in, glancing around. In spite of Tony’s grimy state, nothing in the apartment seems particularly filthy. Just incredibly disorganized and haphazard. Steve can’t even locate the doors that would lead to other rooms, since there are several pieces of sheet metal propped against the walls. “Where do you even sleep?”
By the time he makes it to the apartment, he’s ready to fall over. He hopes Tony isn’t home, wanting to delay the inevitable disappointment, but his luck clearly was used up long before December rolled around, because Tony’s on the sofa clicking away at his laptop.
After a moment more of gaping, Tony closes his mouth and sets his pointed chin in a determined line. “Aye, aye, Captain,” he says, tossing a jaunty salute and turning to face his foes. Steve takes the stairs three at a time to gather up his cleaning supplies. He has a feeling they have a long night ahead of them.
Something about that hits a little to close to home, and Steve pulls Tony into his apartment with sudden urgency, yanking him so close that it almost feels like there’s no delineation between them; they are of one body. “Don’t fucking scare me like that,” he says, deftly peeling Tony’s shirt over his head. “Don’t fucking do that to me. I only just found you.”
“You—fucking—asshole,” Steve says between kisses, nipping at Tony’s jaw, digging nails into his thin t-shirt. “What—the fuck? Smiley faces? Fucking—smiley faces, Tony?”
“Sounds promising,” Steve returned, in German as well, but keeping his sentences as short as possible to cover his accent.
Tony had honestly not known that Steve was capable of giggling so much. He isn’t usually quick to laugh, and Tony always feels accomplished when he manages to make Steve even just guffaw. This drunk giggly Steve is new to him, for all they’ve been engaged three months. Normally Steve stops himself at one beer, so this is…an experience.
Steve sighs and rips off the paper, reveling a velvety jewelry box. He carefully pops it open, guilt eating at him for having failed to get Tony anything, but inside is not any glinting gold or silver. Instead, it’s a small square of post-its. Frowning, Steve squints down at the first one. It reads: IOU one tray of Xmas cookies J. The one after that: IOU one back rub, 30 min. IOU fresh-cut flowers. IOU dinner at restaurant of your choice. IOU one xtra special blow-job supreme. IOU one week of cleaning duties. IOU 10 “I love you”s. The entire coupon book—because that’s what it is—is chock full of sweet little favors, tiny ways in which Tony is willing to show his love and care to Steve.
Steve felt the ache in his ribs and his lungs, the stiffness permanently hindering his hips, and knew he only had the one last ride in him. He shook his head. “If you’re to be Merlin to my Arthur, I’ll put my fate in your hands. I trust you, Tony.”
“No, honey. You’re not an idiot.” But all of Steve’s attempts to soothe Tony only seem to make him cry harder. They wind up on the couch, Steve holding Tony and rubbing his shoulders until the sobs subside into hiccups.
“Uh…would it help or hinder my case to know that my parents are rich and I’ve had a butler and cleaning service literally my entire life until moving out?”
They’re kissing again before he can finish his thought, and Steve groans and pulls them back onto the sofa, so that Tony can straddle him. There’s nothing elegant about their love-making. It’s clumsy and hurried, knees knocking and fingers slipping, losing purchase. At one point, Tony leans so far back he nearly tumbles off the couch altogether, but Steve bends forward and catches his waist, pulling him back in, always pulling him closer. He climaxes after only a minute of frantic stroking, and then flips them so he can suck Tony off, hands splayed over Tony’s chest and knees caging his shins.
“Sorry,” Steve says sheepishly, and he backs away, looking down at his bare toes. And now Tony feels like a jerk, because the puppy is back, and really it’s unfair to him that Steve’s eyelashes are so long.
“Don’t pin this on me, Mr. Let’s-go-up-for-a-romantic-getaway-in-nature. You were the one who said it would be fun and sexy to take the motorcycle.”
“Oh?” Curiously, Steve propped himself up and took a proper look. When Tony had said he waxed, he meant everywhere. Only a neatly groomed thatch of pubic hair remained at the base of his cock, and his balls and ass where completely smooth. Boldly, though not without his ever-present blush, Steve ran a finger down and down and down, taking in all that smooth olive skin. “No peach fuzz,” he murmured, and a moment later, Tony guffawed and then burst into a real laugh, quickly quelled.
Steve sighs and begins cracking windows, wafting the cookie sheet through the air to clear the smoke.
Steve sighs and feels some of the tension bleed out of his shoulders. He’s never had a lover who figures out his moods as quickly as Tony does. It's nice, not to have to vocalize his feelings on the days where the words don’t quite work right for him. It's nice that Tony can just take one glance at him and go into protective mode. And so long as protective mode doesn’t involve cooking (Tony is still only barely able to make scrambled eggs on a good day) the things he does for Steve make it easier to breathe. It's nice.
“It’s more I thought you’d like it than me wanting to go there,” Tony says into his soup, the steam beading on his goatee.
Tony led Steve into a well-appointed room, thick with velvet hangings, heated by a crackling fire. Outside the shutters, Steve could just see the flashes of lightning, but the storm seemed so far away. With the door closed, Tony descended immediately, kissing Steve teasingly, nipping at his lips, running icy hands over Steve’s jawline.
Steve snorted and finally rolled off, carefully clutching at his cock to take the condom with him. He removed it, tied it off, pitched it with perfect aim into the trash can next to Tony’s desk, and then flopped down. With the heat of Steve’s body gone, Tony became instantly aware of how sticky he’d become.
Just like that the spell is broken and Tony rolls his eyes. “Gee, thanks. Does this mean I get to sit at the big kids’ table now?”
Steve saluted as Ross beat a hurried exit, and Tony immediately brightened even more, as though the whole of his being had been clouded over by Ross’ presence. “While I appreciate the general’s offer,” Tony said, “I’ve already got the armor set up in my DC workshop. I’d love for you to come, take a look, and give me your input. We’re working on an accelerated time schedule, so no time like the present if you’re free.”
In addition to the banner, there are balloons (one of which is most definitely a dick), streamers, fairy lights, a stack of party hats, and several six-packs of bottled beer, slightly soggy from having been left to sweat at room temperature. The room, however, seems deserted.
“We should eat the food,” Tony says, but he makes no move to rise from his melting repose. Steve grunts agreement and sinks further into the chair. The fire crackles merrily and Steve nearly dozes off, his eyes fluttering. Between one blink and the next, there’s a tray of food under his nose, smelling wonderfully of cream and butter and sweet apples. Steve looks up to find Tony smiling fondly at him. “You drove us through all that crappy weather. Think that means you deserve a meal.”
Next Saturday finds them at a craft store, debating what kind of tree would be best. They’re on a limited budget, which in some ways helps. All the real glass ornaments are right out, and after inspecting the LED light strings, Tony declares he can make something comparable with scraps from his studio. In the end, Steve buys a few packs of pretty origami paper, two pairs of skinny scissors, and a pack of wire hooks. They’re really going to do this the old-fashioned way. The tree is a little bit tougher to come to a consensus on, but after some debate, they choose real instead of fake and settle on a little four-foot spruce (“I am not climbing a ladder to put the star on, you freakish giant,” Tony declares), grab a base for it, and awkwardly haul it home on the T.
But Steve is only mostly asleep. When Tony starts to move, he turns over and looks down through slitted eyes. “Blow jobs now?”
And suddenly eight months have gone by and Steve still hasn’t put away his misguided ideas of “faith” and “hope” and “admiration.” And somehow, Tony can’t break the…the
That brings Steve crashing back to reality, though he can’t bring himself to jump away, not when Tony’s warm and wet and breathing right in his arms. He tapers off his kisses and presses his forehead to Tony’s, exhaling slowly, only to breathe in machine oil and metal tang and petrichor.
He closes the door, just shy of a slam, and Steve blinks at the little silver 204. Bucky smacks him again and says, “Come on Casanova. Pizza is calling.” Steve turns and fishes out his keys, and even with Bucky’s ribbing, he can’t seem to erase the dumb smile on his face.
“Steve, are you finished?” Bucky asked, his smile just as unnerving as the others’. Was the change really so quick? Or was something of the living Bucky left in there?
Bucky’s laughing, too, lounging and looking pleased with himself. Steve’s crossed his arms and looks caught between irritation and amusement. “Ha ha. Laugh it up. I see how it is. See if I give either of you free beer anymore.”
Tony’s hand appears in front of his nose bearing a small wrapped box. Steve nearly wants to cry. This all turned into such a mess.
Tony squeaks and begins shucking his wet clothes, awkwardly hop-shuffling his way over to the fire as he strips. “Aaaah,” he sighs, as the heat licks at his skin, and Steve grins. At least it hasn’t turned out all bad just yet.
“I bet you cook, too, don’t you? You’re like some world-class chef. I can see it written all over those chiseled abs of yours.”
Tony glances back from where he’s taping tarp down over the window frame. “Why would you want to be romantic for me? I don’t get it.”
Tony ducked his head and looked away. “Last time I visited, she thought I was Howard. Tried to throw a pen at me for ‘getting fresh with Lenore.’ After that…after that I had a hard time visiting.”
“Oh, honey. You didn’t kill it. It…this kind of thing happens with real trees. They’re already dying when you buy them, and sometimes they turn brown before Christmas gets here. We…probably should’ve given it food, or something. I think you’re supposed to give them food. Shoot. I didn’t think of it when we were out last weekend.”
and it’s the same blush he gets when Tony manages to gather up his courage and use all those romantic words Steve likes to hear, like “You’re beautiful” and “You make me happy” and “I love you.” “Steve?” Tony asks, popping the mask, because he definitely hasn’t said anything yet to make Steve blush like that.
“Love you, too.” They lay there a long while, Tony gently stroking his hand through Steve’s hair. He watches the way the street light and passing cars throw flashes of yellow and white on the wall, feels the way Steve’s chest rises and falls with each breath, listens to the rustling of sheets and the rattling of the radiator on the other side of the room. He thinks Steve’s fallen asleep, so he slowly disentangles himself to rid Steve of his jeans. At the very least he can be comfortable now, especially given that he’ll probably have a terrible hangover come tomorrow.
Tony turns so he’s facing Steve and runs a gentle hand through the short hairs on the back of Steve’s head, enjoying the texture of them, scratching lightly until Steve’s eyes droop heavy with pleasure. “You, Steve Rogers, are not dumb. I wish you’d said that this internship was bothering you so much, though. I had no idea.”
Tony wanted to tell Steve he was great, he was sweet and kind and caring, and Tony loved him. He wanted to tell him all that. But his tongue was melting into his teeth, and his eyes couldn’t stay open anymore. Under Steve’s gentle massage, he finally, finally slept.
“I was going to surprise you. With delicious pie. Apple pie. For you, Steve. American as apple pie. Right? Right.”
Another crack. Tony sets aside his phone and wonders if he should go get the bat Steve keeps under the bed or something. That was definitely the sound of something hitting the window, so Tony slowly stands up and creeps closer.
“Clint’s handiwork,” Steve says sheepishly. “Bruce made your favorite. Or, uh, I suppose it’s probably packed into Tupperware in the fridge. And Nat picked up that tiramisu from that place you like.”
“I started off with the obvious: weight. I’ve redone the outer plating in an alloy that lightens the total load by 35%. With the bonus of adding that lovely golden sheen. I hope you don’t mind?”
Tony punched in a key code and waltzed in with an utterly cavalier air. A middle-aged woman was waiting for him at the front door; she was round and hard with edges that screamed no-nonsense.
Clint steered Tony into a chair, and a moment later, something heavy fell over his chest and legs. He looked down to see a length of heavy red fabric. Thor’s cape. He was wearing Thor’s cape. And under that he was…naked? Except for socks. He was still wearing socks. Not naked.
He woke with the first creeping fingers of gray dawn feeling restless, anxious, tired even though he’d slept the night through. Bucky sat beside him, eyes wide open and pale in the light, his cheeks somehow gaunt. Steve nearly spoke up to ask what was wrong, but at the last moment, remembered himself. As they packed their gear, the farmer’s wife appeared in the door with thick slices of dark, coarse bread slathered in soft goat cheese and a few eggs fried in bacon fat. She didn’t speak, but only watched them with dark baleful eyes, sunken deep into her wind-weathered face. They ate with haste and then set off down the road toward Sighișoara to find the mysterious black-haired American.
“But nothing. We’ll make it work. I’ll think of something. You wanted to do something romantic? Well, I can’t think of much that’s more romantic than larking off to Denmark for three months together.”
Bucky recovers while Tony is still curled on the floor, clutching his stomach and hiccuping with joy. “Well, since your TV is busted, Rogers, I’m gonna go bug Sam until he lets me watch the game on his. You two boys have fun. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”
Steve left it alone, studying the black, wrought-iron sign over the main gate. “Maria Stark Foundation.” Pages and pages of Tony’s history carefully kept hidden away. Steve wasn’t sure if he’d ever be permitted to read them all, but he wanted to try. Oh, how he wanted to try.
Steve hands were on him. Smooth, strong, sure. And then he started kneading. Gentle squeezes along Tony’s triceps, soft circles across his shoulder blades, firm strokes along his lumbar and glutes. The warmth seemed to shoot straight through him, setting off some sort of chemical trigger in his brain. Little by little, his limbs melted into the mattress.
“Well, the only way you’re gonna see what this talented mouth can do is if you let me watch the rest of the game on your TV.”
“Steve! You woke up! I’m so glad!” Tony rushes from his seat to take Steve’s elbow and support him. “You’re probably still sick, so no overdoing it, but we were just about to have Sam’s soup and open presents.”
“I know it seems like it’ll slow you down, but this is the latest. The military doesn’t even have these connectivity speeds yet. Fractions of a second between you and me. And megabytes of data! So much more than has traveled previously at this speed and in this package size.”
By first light, Steve was a bundle of tightly strung wire, all the more tight because he was angry at his own nerves. Bucky noticed his snappish mood and wisely chose not to comment, packing their wet parachutes as best he could in an oilcloth bag while Steve rustled up a cold, tinned breakfast. With it bright enough to read landmarks, even with the rain, Bucky shimmied up a tree to help get their bearings. He shouted down landmarks to Steve, who computed those all into a map, consulting his compass constantly. Most importantly for their purposes, Bucky could just see a huge building on a hill in the distance, most likely the fortress at Sighișoara. With a bearing and a general idea of where they were, they set off toward civilization and, Steve thought with a breath of relief, Tony. Illogically, he couldn’t help but feel that if they could only find Tony, everything would be okay.
“Don’t move. Stay right where you are.” Tony didn’t mean to sound quite so testy, but he must’ve because Steve immediately freezes and gives Tony the kicked-puppy face. “There’s glass on the floor and you’re drunk and I don’t want you to get hurt.”
“Mm, want to join me for a bath?” He felt Steve’s gaze on his face and glanced over, only to see a flash of hesitance there. “You can tell me about your day,” Tony continued, turning so he could take in more of Steve’s expression. “I’d like to hear it.”
“I’m thinking more,” Steve replies, wiping at the sweat on his brow. He’s not quite sure what he did with his button-up, but it’s probably mixed in with Tony’s hopelessly pink whites. Steve’s undershirt is completely soaked through, but he’s guessing from the glances Tony keeps stealing that the view is appreciated. The big upright fan they set at the end of the hall to help things dry out sends a cool breeze across his skin and he shivers, hunching in a little.
“No, it’s fine. I know…” Steve has to pause and take a deep breath. He can do this. For Tony, he can do this. “I know all this is new to you. Just, in the future, keep in mind that baking is chemistry, and chemistry—”
The very thought sent Tony’s head spinning, and he very nearly lost his balance right into Steve’s chest. He caught himself at the last moment and ended up holding the fabric of Steve’s shirt instead. “Well then, I’m yours.”
“Nonsense. I know we’re a B&B, but we do like to take care of people who get the wrong side of the weather like this. You should see the folks who come through when the Nor’easters start blowing.”
“And just why the hell is it so early, anyway? Isn’t the whole point of having a private jet not having to get up at the asscrack of dawn to catch a flight?”
“I’m always free these days,” Steve said, only half-jokingly. He was, in the most technical sense, a consultant for the military, but they rarely listened to his opinions anymore. For all that he’d piloted the Iron Man through the War, outside of the armor, most of the higher-ups still saw a scrawny, asthmatic weakling. A few gave his opinions due weight: Danvers always took him seriously, perhaps because she was aware of the pain that came with being underestimated. But on the whole, Steve’s name and the reputation attached to it were the most useful thing about him as far as generals like Ross were concerned. Until now.
That was Bruce. Bruce was back. “I brought you some melatonin and a mild muscle relaxant. I know you prefer not to have that kind of thing in your system, but you’re so keyed up, I worry you might not get to REM before your muscles wake you back up again. Will you take it for me?”
“Can we?” Tony looks up with his big eyes, one of them ringed in solid black, and Steve guffaws again. In retaliation, Tony punches his shoulder. Steve leans down and kisses Tony, maybe a little more thoroughly than is strictly appropriate for a public bathroom, but he doesn’t care if Tony doesn’t. When he pulls away, he looks up and checks his jaw in the mirror. Sure enough, a little smear of grease has transferred.
“Can I help you?” she asks pointedly, flicking her red hair and looking like she’s gearing up to rip him a new one.
“When you said you had some extra property in New York, this wasn’t exactly what I imagined.” Steve stared at the building, which certainly wasn’t tall, but was eye-catching insomuch as it was completely surrounded by skyscrapers and yet it had a proper yard in the heart of New York. No. Yard wasn’t the right word. It had grounds, the same way Buckingham Palace had grounds.
“It’s fine,” one of the firefighters says, waving her hand. “Just next time maybe explain the situation before you play ten-pin with us.”
So instead he tried every trick in the book. Counting sheep. Counting breath. Imagining he was a melting snowman. Tensing and relaxing focused muscle groups. Listing the periodic table. He never got far though. The thought spirals intruded again and again. For hours he fought it until, rumpled and so dry he felt like a corn husk, he peeked out from beneath his blanket and saw that the sun was rising.
Steve thanks him and then it’s back out into the fat, icy rain. Steve can barely see through his visor and behind him, Tony is shivering in a way that doesn’t bode well. He puts on a little more speed than he probably should on wet asphalt, but the streets are virtually deserted. No one wants to be out in the storm and rush hour is still two hours coming.
“So I’ve also installed a new operating system. Think of it as an enhancement of your neurophysio interface. As the machine stands now, you have to multitask your mind into moving different systems independently
Tony absently listens to Steve fumbling at the lock while he turns to the larger problem at hand. The window is busted, but it’s the middle of winter; he can’t just leave it like this.
Steve stares down at the screen of his phone for a moment, wondering if he should text back just to be an asshole. Sam does have a point, but Tony had distinctly said he’d be picking Steve up. Or at least Steve thinks he said that. Actually he’s not 100% sure. Maybe he only imagined that and really Tony’s waiting for him to knock and thinking he’s been stood up.
“No, that’s not…” Steve stops, shakes his head, and relocates his hands to his hips. “Can I help you?” he repeats.
“It was my dad’s mansion back before he moved corporate headquarters out to California. It was just gathering dust so I figured, you know, might as well,” Tony replied, shrugging nonchalantly in the way he did when he was trying to pretend something didn’t matter that much to him.
In his usual way, Steve snaps from sleeping to waking, though he doesn’t flail the way he used to. A few too many mishaps in bed have trained him into clamping his arms down in the moment of waking, a measure meant to keep him from accidentally punching Tony with all the strength of a startled supersoldier.
They were careful as they laid out things to dry. The chutes went up in the hayloft where they wouldn’t draw attention to how Steve and Bucky arrived. Their clothes went over the wooden gates keeping in the sheep and goats, all of whom watched with eerie silence as Steve and Bucky went about their business. Steve wanted to mention the unnatural quiet, but he dared not speak in English or French and was wary of testing the limitations of his German. He could tell from Bucky’s frequent glances, though, that Bucky didn’t trust their shelter either.
Thor nods and laughs and agrees and then promptly bails on paying for their dinner to return the bird to Asgard. The cheapskate. It doesn’t really matter. Steve’s hand is warm in Tony’s, the ring a heady reminder on his finger. Tony has JARVIS order pizza, and he and Steve retire to a guest room, where the night continues on more or less as Tony planned it except with less chocolate and more sappy grinning. He maybe cries and grins during
“Quia tuum est regnum, et potestas, et Gloria, in saecula. Amen.” With the Amen, Tony fell to his knees, as did the other vampires, joining Bucky where he was for the moment helpless on the ground. Steve stepped past them all, looking at the ornate crypt door they had come to. “Drakul” was inscribed upon it, and Steve took up the Lord’s Prayer again, muttering it with all his heart, cringing at the way Tony twisted in agony.
“Huh,” he says, twisting as though he might just catch a glimpse of it. “Guess it’s from when I slipped and fell. The first time. Or maybe the second. It’s fine. It doesn’t hurt too bad.”
“Babe, have you looked in a mirror today?” Steve wheezes between his swallowed laughter. To soften the blow, he reaches up and cups the clean side of Tony’s face, his lips still wriggling uncontrollably with his laughter.
Sex had never been like this before. It had never left Tony feeling so utterly powerless and powerful all at once. Steve above him, sweating, ruddy faced, panting with exertion he shouldn’t be feeling given his supersoldier body. Everything about him glistened pink and wet and new, his hair in disheveled spikes from where Tony had been pulling at it. Steve filled Tony’s whole world, and took him further and further, higher and higher, sent the blood roaring in Tony’s ears like a maelstrom. Steve, fucking him in earnest, his pace relentless, the slap of skin on skin, higher and higher and higher and his hand on Tony’s cock, there, squeezing, stroking, oh god, the crest…
“Was that what this whole weekend was about?” Steve asks, leaning back just far enough that he can look up into Tony’s eyes.
Bruce was the first to move again, standing from his chair at the table. “Tony, you’re not looking so great. When was the last time you were able to sleep?”
Tony snorts, blinks, managed to dislodge himself. Half asleep on his feet, he stumbles out, only to come up short. A banner is draped over the living room flatscreen.
“Ah. Well, that’s the other reason to have me keyed into the system. In the event of your death, rather than self-destruct, the armor will switch to remote piloting. I won’t have great control of it, not the way you do, but I’ll be able to do enough to get it out of danger and direct it back to base. I’m calling it the Avalon protocol.”
“Maybe have a little faith?” Steve’s bashful expression had softened just a little, a smile hitching at his mouth, making him look a little more boyish.
“Not horny,” Steve murmurs, his hand petting leisurely up and down Tony’s chest. Then he harrumphs. “Well, yes horny. But just, just love you so much, Tony.”
“Steve?” It’s like panacea, a hit of ecstasy, like the very nectar of the gods itself. Steve twists, ignoring the hands grasping at his arms and shoulders. He’s suddenly surrounding by people, all of them pulling him in different directions, but beyond the line of blurred faces, he sees him.
Tony? That wouldn’t be any better. That would be agony every bit as bitter as Tony as an undead bloodsucker.
“Everything is fine. He’s in the laundry room. You go on down and give him a piece of your mind for being thirty minutes late.”
On cue, a young man entered. He was dressed in a tailored charcoal suit, and he had a neatly trimmed moustache; with each step, he bounced on his toes with a youthful enthusiasm Steve couldn’t ever remember feeling, even when he was all of nineteen. “A pleasure and an honor, Colonel,” Stark said, extending a firm handshake. “And please call me Tony.”
Steve saw red, perhaps unfairly. No one should be taking on this burden unnecessarily, and more selfishly, the old girl was Steve’s. He didn’t want to give her up while he still breathed. He started to object: “Now hold on just a—”
, beheading was effective. At least it was a plan, and he thought he could manage it. He set down his silverware and picked up his napkin, blotting at his lips. “That was delicious.”
Steve hummed and pulled Tony in tighter. “Good,” he said, rocking them both a little. “I’m gonna ask her what you were like as a toddler.”
“You’re damn right it is,” Tony says, grinning like a maniac and helping Steve to his feet. “You’re paying for our Valentine’s meal, after all, seeing’s as your weird Asgardian bird ruined ours.”
he sees shining from Steve’s eyes when he looks at him. So for Valentine’s Day, Tony’s going to pull out all the stops. He’s going to do everything Steve’s stupidly romantic heart could possibly want.
Below the clouds, the countryside was black as pitch, and through their descent, Steve began to feel his clothes soak through with icy water. It was raining over the border. Satisfied that no one would see them, Steve pulled his parachute, his enhanced eyes tracking Bucky above him. It would be easier for him to find Bucky in the dark, so it was Steve’s job to keep track of their positions and move through the mountains if they landed far away from each other. Below, the mountains loomed closer and closer, blacker and blacker, until Steve bellowed out his warning for Bucky.
“..sicut et…et…Pater noster. Pater noster. Pater…” His brain moved through syrup. He couldn’t remember the words, and Tony’s touch was so sweet and gentle.
“Nothing,” Steve says with an enigmatic smile, and then pulls Tony in close, burying his nose in helmet-tousled hair. “Just wanted to do it.”
And the hurt was as if it was Steve’s own, his own heart aching with the words, squeezing like he was a skinny beanpole all over again. “Panem nostrum cotidianum…da…da…” Pushing against the weight became harder still. He didn’t want to hurt Tony. He loved him. Why was he doing this?
“You can’t send Cap out there alone! He needs somebody to watch his back!” Bucky spoke out of turn, but Steve had to admit he had a point. Deep in Axis territory with shells falling everywhere, even Captain America might not get very far alone.
In Colonel Phillips’ tent, he stood at attention while Phillips chewed a cigar and stared angrily down at missive after missive. “Churchill wants you in the Carpathians. Disputed territory on the Hungarian-Romanian border. Heavy shelling. We lost a major asset there and haven’t been able to reestablish contact since we started bombing.”
He has every intention of showering, but stops short in the hallway, confronted by a scene he’d never expected: Tony sits at the kitchen table with Sam, Nat, Bucky, Rhodes, and Pepper, all of them in hideous Christmas sweaters, playing cards. Red and green taper candles are lit along their fake fireplace, and there’s a mound of presents under the table. Something is simmering on the stove, and for the first time since he fell ill, Steve can smell properly enough to know it smells amazing.
“Steve?” Ms. Ortega says behind him, but he’s digging for his keys, frantically trying to open the door. “Steve! Steve, what are you doing?”
“Find,” Tony grunted, and the bot happily rolled off to the mock test range. “Not perfect,” Tony murmured, slumping down against the table to watch. “Just functional. Just need you to do your job. Can tweak later.” It’s little treads bumbled across sand and rocks, grinding a little in a way that, just for a moment, sent Tony back five years in time. His fingers clenched compulsively at the table before he forced himself to let go.
Shaking his head, Tony stands and walks the tray to the sink, grabbing a spatula to scrape the failed gingerbread into the trash. “No. I, I don’t think I can… I’m tired, Steve. Can we just not go? Or you can go if you want, but I’m just… gonna tinker with that one match-game app.”
Something cracked in Steve’s mind. The twisting thread had grown into a writhing snake, and finally, it was pushing out of its box. Blut. Vampires. The ache in Steve’s neck redoubled, and suddenly, he wondered if what he felt wasn’t a lovebite at all. Ice trickled down his neck as he glanced around again, now mindlessly shoveling food into his mouth as reality descended on him, and the horror of what he was seeing gradually became clear.
Tony nodded and opened his mouth numbly, feeling the soft acrid weight of pills on his tongue. Someone put the straw back between his lips, and he swallowed convulsively. It was so nice and warm. He almost believed sleep was possible.
They play another round of cards before Steve begins to feel exhausted again, and then Tony clears everyone out like they’re a pack of vermin. Night is falling outside, the snow is coming down harder, and Tony switches on
“Let’s get you out of these wet things,” he growled, yanking Steve’s bomber jacket off. Steve’s clothes fell to the floor with wet thuds, but Steve could hardly be bothered to worry about ruining the lush furnishings with the way Tony was lighting his flesh on fire. It had been months since their last encounter, and while Steve didn’t expect that Tony was maintaining any kind of fidelity, Steve hadn’t been able to bring himself to relieve his needs elsewhere.
, when he said it. It just got me thinking. And maybe…maybe I’m barking up the wrong tree. And if I am. That’s okay. Your friendship means the world to me. And I don’t want to ruin that friendship. But. I have feelings. For you. And I’m sorry if what I did in the kitchen made you uncomfortable. I don’t know what I was thinking. They were just…there. And so perfect. And the little panties. It made me think…well, it doesn’t matter what they made me think. I think that was pretty obvious. I mean, I was pretty obvious. But maybe I wasn’t? I–”
Right up until it’s not. A week later, Steve comes home ready for another weekend of the Christmas list to find Tony standing in front of the tree, crying.
Steve turns in the doorway and catches Tony’s eye, leaning against the doorjamb and crossing his arms. The movement has the intended effect when Tony freezes, his eyes trained on Steve’s biceps and pecs.
Tony nods, but never meets Steve’s eyes. He’s so damn young. Of course, Steve is young, too, but he had to grow up quickly, what with his mom dying at seventeen and his two years in the military. Sometimes on bad nights, he wonders if he and Tony are moving too fast, if they’ve jumped the gun, if Tony will lose interest and leave him, and moments like this feed those fears.
“Oh my god, thank you. I really…if they’d given me more warning I would’ve…you know…been responsible and gone out and—“
The ball is descending from the apex of its parabola now, drawing nearer and nearer the frantic outfielder. Even Tony is holding his breath. Time stretches, expands to fill the gaps, and they all freeze as ball and glove approach impact.
Steve hummed thoughtfully into Tony’s skin and wriggled down the bed, one hand sliding beneath his own hips to undo the fly of his jeans and begin the process of shimmying free.
“Then to the fortress.” Steve could feel eyes on them as they exited the market, not only from the villagers, but also, strangely, from above. Steve didn’t dare look up, loathe to show any signs of fear, but his hackles raised. Even worse, he couldn’t discuss the townspeople’s obvious anxiety with Bucky. The further they got up the hill, the fewer people on the road, and those they did encounter hurriedly crossed themselves and disappeared down back alleys. Bucky grumbled lowly, “Guess word travels fast.”
And they date. And fight. And kiss and make up. And hang around Avengers Tower with the other Avengers, draped in each other’s laps and sticking noses in each other’s business and forming the kind of family Tony always secretly hoped for when he was a kid and gave up on entirely when Jarvis died.
There’s no time for words, not when hands are still grabbing at him, threatening to pull them apart. He yanks Tony down and kisses him, angry and frightened and cherishing all at the same time, teeth dragging across Tony’s lip until flesh gives way to tongue, and then the hands are gone, all save Tony’s voracious touch.
“Murder,” Tony says cheerfully, and then plows on, clearly unaware of the stricken look of horror on Steve’s face. “So my parents kind of disinherited me until I can prove that I can make a living doing what I want, which is making cool things. Like robots. And artificial intelligence. Clean energy sources. You know. Cool things.”
Steve lifts a knowing eyebrow and then snaps down the visor of his helmet. Tony does the same and then fastens the collar of his leather jacket. That is something Steve was absolutely unwilling to compromise on, even though he always rides around New York like a maniac, armed with only a T-shirt and sheer luck, helmet laws be damned. Today though, they are both decked out in riding leathers and heavy-duty blue jeans. Tony swings on behind Steve, cinching his hands around Steve’s lean waist. Through the helmet mic he says, “Let’s go, Hot Stuff.”
On dragging toes, he slumped his way through the living area to his bedroom. No Steve. The bed was made, the sheets military flat. Tony would miss Steve’s body heat, but they didn’t always share a bed, so it wasn’t like he had any right to be disappointed or lonely. It was fine. Or at least it would be fine once was he was horizontal.
“Jesus fucking Christ, what the fuck kind of a call was that, ump? Are you blind? Good god, you scum sucking two timing traitor asshole. Did you not see the ball? Fuck me, this is terrible.”
“Jan says I’m being a coward, so I’m just gonna come right out and say it. I’d like to have a relationship. With you. A…uh, sexual relationship. And a romantic one. But, uh, I saw the peaches, and Jarvis said you brought them from Japan, and he had this…
“Your shoulder is solid black and blue,” Steve says, reaching out and touching without thinking. Tony’s skin is feverishly hot and swollen where the bruising is worst.
Heart pounding in his chest, Tony rose and stumbled out of the bedroom into the main room. If he couldn’t sleep, he damn well wasn’t going to stay in the dark. He weaved back and forth to the kitchen, eyes on his feet, so of course he he ran straight into someone.
“Just a second,” he blurts and snatches the bathrobe from the bed, shrugging into it. It fits around his waist just fine, but it’s short on his legs and wrists, and gapes where his shoulders push the seams to their limits. Tony smirks and leers shamelessly, already bundled in his robe and curled in the wingback armchair next to the fire.
Tony’s face lifts a little, and he glances up, a smidge hopeful. “I’d like that. Just us. For this first one.”
“The Rupicola blesses this union,” Thor booms, clapping both Tony and Steve on the shoulder. “Fortune is upon you my friends.”
Only then does Steve seem to realize he’s alone in the living room. He blinks cow-eyed for a moment, and then scrambles to his feet. “Well, uh…” Hands to his pockets, shoulders hunched, Steve looks amazingly vulnerable for a man who’s 6′2″. “Happy birthday?”
Steve frowns into his stew and hesitates, unsure if these descriptions are neutral or jaded with a careful veneer of disaffection. If they’re neutral, that’s one thing. But if Tony is bitter about the holidays and hiding it, that’s another. It’s their first Christmas together as a couple—last year their relationship had been too new and they’d decided to do their own thing—and that means putting together a bunch of family traditions to try and make it work. Steve had always thought this would be fun—he’d liked doing it with Peggs and her British Christmas—but from what Tony’s describing, there’s not much they can pull in from his side. Oh god…
“We can always go next year, Tony. It’s not like Massachusetts is a bad place. Even if they do have the Red Sox.”
“Soviet spy sent here to look for the same thing I was looking for. We ran into each other, and since our goals align…” Tony shrugged against Steve’s back, his hand dipping below the water to where Steve’s cock was already half-hard again. “She’s deadly, probably not trustworthy, but for some reason, I trust her.”
“Positive,” Steve says, giving his most winning smile. It seems to have the desired effect because Tony slowly nods and then looks between them, as though realizing for the first time he’s still in only his underwear. He jumps away from Steve and turns toward the stairs, his ears wonderfully pink.
Steve blushes a little, hand automatically rising to the back of head. “Well, I’m from Brooklyn. What’s your excuse?”
When Tony was done playing with him, they rose from the bath, though Steve was so lassitudinous he could barely stand. Tony supported him at the waist, helping him along back to the bedroom, where he dressed Steve in warm flannel pajamas and a silk smoking jacket in blue and then led him back out into the fortress, down candlelit hallways lined in shadows.
“I do not know how it came to Midgard, but this is the Asgardian Rupicola. It is a great omen of true love, and comes to roost only where a couple will consummate their dedication to each other.”
“Here Tony,” Steve said, setting down a bowl of oatmeal with banana coins on top. “Try eating a little for me. Just enough to help settle you.” Tony tried to reach for the spoon only to have it swim just out of grasp. Like an eel. He frowned down and tried again but it stubbornly remained out of reach.
Enraptured by the vulnerability, the humanity, of what’s before him, Tony stalls out again, blinking dumbly in the dim light of New York. It takes him a long while, certainly long enough to be creepy, before he finds the energy to stumble forward and put a hand to Steve’s shoulder.
Boxed up and down $400, Tony bore his peaches straight to the airport and onto his private jet, and within thirteen hours, they were in the Avengers mansion common kitchen, laid out for all and sundry to see. He took momentary pleasure in the bemused shock from Jan, Thor, and Hank, the disapproving sniff from Jarvis, and then promptly forgot about his huge, pink peaches. Until he came in later that night for coffee.
“That’s okay. This is nice, too.” And just as quickly Tony’s laughter died away because Steve dove down and replaced his hand with his mouth, kissing and sucking his way down Tony’s balls to his perineum and then down his crack to his hole.
“Are you kidding me?” Steve breathes, and he can feel the way his eyes have widened in horror. He looks back down at Tony, who has closed his eyes and laid his head back down, limbs spread and palms up. “What are you doing?”
Tony removed his hand from his face, eyes darting toward the portrait before he looked up at Steve. “Yeah. Yeah, I’d like that, I think.”
“I can think of some ideas,” Pepper said, her fingers twining with James’. “A brush with some dastardly Nazis, saved by Captain America, a heroic escape aboard the zeppelin. Perhaps a special guest.” She traded a look with Tony, as if her words had particular significance. Of course. Someone must have made them like this. If Steve could find that person, would that undo the curse? But how would he even go about it?
Tony texts a photo back, a selfie that’s maybe a little too zoomed in, because Tony’s right eye is bugged like a mad scientist in a C-movie from the forties. A moment later, his phone jingles jauntily.
Steve grunted assent but didn’t add his own thoughts. The town was visible in the distance, gray on gray on gray. It was as though all the color had been washed out of the world. Yet he felt strangely drawn toward it, a low thrumming he could feel in his chest.
Finally, he eases his grip and turns to the firefighters and Mrs. Ortega, all of whom are staring at him with a range of expressions varying from wry amusement to perturbed indignation. He grins sheepishly and pulls Tony deeper into the shadow of his body, shivering as rain seeps through his jacket.
“Tony!” If Tony was here, nothing was impossible. Steve could do anything. At the top of the grand staircase, where previously there had been nobody, Tony stood. He was dressed uncharacteristically in a red silk smoking jacket and a pair of fine slacks that looked as though they might belong to a matching tuxedo.
“Because you’re both the thickest men I’ve ever met?” Jan guessed, though her palm rubbed soothing circles up and down his back. “Steve, just go to his room. Bring lube and some condoms. Use your words. For all Tony knows, you’ve just got a thing for peaches.”
Gasping, Steve turns his face until he can press his lips to Tony’s jaw. Tony’s wriggling in his tight grip, and for a moment Steve eases up, but apparently all he wanted was to swing his legs up, which he does, wrapping his knees over Steve’s hips and hitching himself high.
“You saved my ass. Seriously. I don’t know how to thank you. How do normal, non-rich people thank each other?”
Tony gave him a signature irritated face, causing Steve to laugh even more. “So here I thought I was giving you some new exciting experience, and you’re telling me been there, done that?”
“God, you’re amazing.” Steve leaned in to kiss Tony’s neck as he began to move. Tony’s hands were still pressed to the wall, and Steve was so hard at knowing that Tony was splayed out here, wide open and moaning just for him. “You want it hard, baby? You need me that bad?”
“Mmmm. Already so excited?” Tony licked his lips and reached back to give Steve a stroke, teasing the other man.
“Didn’t anyone ever tell you those who make me wait don’t get to come?” Tony countered, kissing Steve through a grin.
They were both short of breath, panting and shaking in the spray of the shower. Steve pulled out of Tony gently and then shuffled them both over to the corner where there was a bench to sit down. Tony immediately draped himself over Steve and stayed there, listening to his lover breathe and the water all around them.
Tony was surprised at the force of Steve moving him, but he was turned on even more at his boyfriend handling him so roughly. He was hard now too, and he used his new leverage to push his ass back against Steve’s crotch.
“I could be, under the right circumstances.” Tony slid the shower door open and stepped inside. The shower in their penthouse was just as extra as Tony; spray nozzles everywhere, mood lighting, sound system, room for an entire football team.
Steve moved his hands from Tony’s cock and hip to support his body as the engineer’s muscles weakened with his release. A moment later and Tony collapsed forward onto him, both of them sweaty, sticky, and short of breath.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. He rubbed Tony’s back in light circles with his thumbs and kissed the side of Tony’s head. “I ever tell you how perfect you are?”
Steve stood first then helped Tony up. He hugged Tony and then kissed him slowly. They were both thinking how lucky they were.
Tony licked his lips and pulled his fingers out. He stood up and crossed back to Steve, squeezing out more lube as he walked. He crouched down and started coating Steve’s cock in lube, stroking while Steve stroked himself. “Let’s go, then,” Tony finally announced, pushing Steve’s hands away.
It had been about a week since they’d had sex. There was so much going on these days, and the way Tony worked made it hard to fit it in… pun very much intended. So Steve was ready to go quickly, and Tony’s teasing only made him want it more. He grabbed Tony’s hands and moved their bodies forward so he could make Tony brace himself against the shower wall. Water was splashing them from all angles, feeling incredible on his sensitive skin.
Tony rolled his eyes and rolled over, letting Steve spoon up against his back. “You’re lucky you’re cute, Rogers.” But there was a smile in his voice. Steve laughed softly and squeezed him tight, resting against his boyfriend for a much needed nap.
“Yeah, when he dropped me off at the airport, Clint told me to have fun at the Mile High Club. And when I asked him what that was, he said that you’d tell me.”
One of the great things about dating a super soldier was that he could time his orgasm perfectly. His refractory period was also a huge plus, but in instances like these Tony loved the option of telling Steve when to come and so they could climax together. He rode Steve a little faster, grunting out a moan each time he bottomed out on Steve’s cock. “Almost there, baby…” he warned, digging his fingers into Steve’s hips.
Tony used his other hand to give himself a few strokes, mostly for Steve’s visual benefit. After he’d done as much as he could in that position, he turned around and lowered his chest to the ground. His ass was facing Steve now, and he used one hand to spread his cheeks while the other slipped three fingers into his hole. Steve grabbed his own cock, kind of forgetting he had that option for a moment, and stroked along with the rhythm of Tony’s fingers. He was making needy little noises without realizing it, but the blissed out grin on Tony’s face let him know that his lover was appreciating his response.
Tony hummed, in what Steve assumed to be a yes. They lay there recovering for a bit before Tony sat up with a protesting groan and climbed off Steve. He took off his shirt, the only piece of clothing he was still wearing, and spread a blanket out on the floor to collapse onto. Steve followed suit, finally getting out of his own clothes and joining Tony naked on the blanket. They’d shower before the plane landed, but they both needed a nap first.
“Fuck, Tony, are you ready yet?” Steve’s breathing was heavy already, and he wasn’t sure how long he could stay still on the couch.
“It was never quite this good though. And never as comfy. And I certainly wasn’t able to take a nap and a shower after.” Steve gave him a kiss, trying to keep his smile hidden ineffectively.
Suddenly all the sensations went away, and Steve blinked a few times in surprise. Tony had stopped moving, let go, and stood up. He was standing next to the couch stepping out of his jeans and briefs, leaving them in a pile at his feet. Steve started to sit up to take his off too, but Tony made a noise and leaned forward to push his shoulders back down. “Not so fast. I want you just like that.”
Steve had slowed down since he was only holding Tony still with one hand now, but he was close, and he could feel Tony’s balls tightening each time he slipped his hand to the base. One thing he had to admit, clean up would be a breeze this time. “Come for me. Wanna feel you tighten on my cock. Wanna fuck you hard after you’re spent and sensitive.”
“Says the guy who yelled at me for not leaping across the room into your arms,” Steve replied, quirking an eyebrow at Tony.
Tony wiggled his ass a bit and turned his head to wink at Steve. “Thought we could both use some stress relief.”
He climbed back on top of Steve and lowered himself onto his erection with expert skill. It literally took Steve’s breath away, how good Tony was at these things and how fucking gorgeous he looked while doing it. Tony grabbed Steve’s hands and placed one on his hip, the other on his cock, and he started to lift and drop his body. He started slowly, but only for a few motions. His body was familiar with Steve’s, and Tony knew exactly what he wanted.
After a considerable amount of grinding, Tony finally paused long enough to unzip them both. He wasted no time pressing their cocks together and squeezing them both tight in his fist. He grunted at the sudden friction, and Steve let out a low moan. Keeping his hand in place, Tony started to thrust shallowly forward, rubbing his own erection against Steve’s and his hand. Steve whimpered softly and closed his eyes, listening to the sound of Tony gasping and hissing a little with each rock of his hips. He was starting to feel dizzy and was glad he was firmly against the couch.
It felt like Steve was teasing his prostate forever, and Tony was a whiny mess. His cock was leaking and his hips were pumping on their own, and he could hear himself begging for Steve to fuck him already, but he was sure he hadn’t opened his mouth. Everything was hazy and wet and he could feel Steve’s hands on his hips, and suddenly he felt Steve’s cock push into him and… fuck, it was all perfect.
Steve’s eyes opened and he looked up at Tony breathlessly. He nodded, temporarily unable to form whole words. A few more thrusts down onto Steve, and Tony dropped hard, landing perfectly so Steve’s cock would hit his prostate as he let go. He let out a broken cry, dropping his head back and slamming his eyes shut as he squirted onto Steve’s shirt. He could feel Steve coming inside him too, Steve having let go as soon as Tony had stopped moving on him.
Sweating and wracked with nerves, he finishes his break with no game plan for this, the most important part, and returns to his cubicle. Around two o’clock, Carol stops by with some documents and glances down at him. “Are you feeling okay? You’re sweating up a storm. And you look pale.” Before he can answer, she presses a hand to his forehead. “Holy shit, Steve. That’s a hell of a fever.”
Tony’s been programming smartphone games to make his income while he works through graduate school, and half his December has been bug fixes to holiday specials. Sometimes he doesn’t come to bed until after midnight, looking hollow-eyed and gaunt.
“I remember her sitting for this, actually. She was so irritated with Dad. Said it was a total waste of time and why couldn’t they just take a photograph? And Dad…” Tony’s eyes grew far-away, and Steve suddenly realized he was reading a page he’d never read before, glimpsing one of those things that Tony kept so very carefully hidden. “Dad said Peg had been going 24/7, 365 since the war, and she could afford to rest a few days to get a damn portrait done.”
JARVIS brought him to the penthouse without a word, and Tony emerged into a seating area lit only by the New York skyline. Late then. Late enough that the city seemed quiet. Maybe so late it was early. Tony had just been looking at a clock. Why couldn’t he remember what time it was?
“You know,” he had said, his town drawing the concentrated attention of all the Invaders, “doctors have theorized that the origins of vampire myths lie in illnesses like porphyria, rabies, and tuberculosis. And then there are texts… Saint George’s Testament supposedly indicated he’d righteously slain a vampire. And there are mentions of those who consume human blood in Leviticus. Is it really so outrageous that some Kraut claims he’s a bloodsucker?”
They came to a grand dining room, the table already loaded with roasted meats, potatoes, soups, vegetables, meringues, jellied fruits, and more. Steve had seen such sumptuousness only at Churchill’s table, and his stomach gave a rumble at the spread. He hadn’t eaten such good-looking food in months, maybe even years. Jarvis, James, Pepper, Bucky, and Natalia were already at the table, though the head and its right-hand were left free.
“You want me to order a pizza for tonight? Crack a few beers? We can sit and watch whatever movie you want.”
the previous chapter. Happy belated winter holiday festival thingy. So long as it's up before New Year's, it still counts, right? Special thanks to MusicalLuna for emergency betaing for me and assuring me that I could still write a thing. This is...quite a bit schmoopier than the rest of this series, but I was in that kind of mood.
Tony’s brain stutters like a backfiring engine and then he drops to his knees, grabbing at Steve’s face. “Are you asking me to marry you?”
Steve is caught like a deer in headlights, his heart suddenly thundering in his chest. For a moment, he gapes at the door, his jaw working like a fish’s mouth, but then he raises his hand and knocks. From the bathroom, the conversation suddenly dies off, but Steve can practically feel Tony through the thick oak. After a moment, the lock clicks and the handle turns; Tony appears, looking through the open crack with his eyes huge and terrified.
“J, lab’s yours. Get the specs and test footage to Pep, and tell her to work her magic. Do not disturb orders on my quarters for the next four hours. I don’t want to hear or see anyone or anything unless the world’s ending, and even then, tell them to see if they can get Johnny Storm first.”
An eternity later, Tony did come down, though he clung to the beautiful haze of where he’d been, letting it fill his body with easy lassitude. Steve was on top of him, chest-to-chest, still inside. His warm breath spread across the thick muscle of Tony’s trapezius, which ached with the first twinges of a love bite.
Steve cranes his neck, but Tony disappears in the press of the crowd, and seeing through all the bodies is nearly impossible. They shouldn’t have come on a game night, but a few drinks out had seemed like a good idea, especially since Tony had finally turned twenty-one and they could do this in public now. So Steve had come straight from his tiny cubicle to the bar, only to meet  a cloud of beer fumes and raucous shouting about the football game playing on all the TVs. Maybe some place a little closer to home would’ve been quieter, but Tony  wanted to meet near Steve’s office building.
“I already have a list of several likely candidates, Sir. There’s a young woman at MIT, up-and-coming, who seems particularly promising.”
“You want I should help warm you up?” he offers with a smirk and a wink, and Tony’s eyes darken. Then he glances to the door.
“FUCK YEAH!” Steve roars as the outfielder misses his leap by six inches. The ball bounces off the backboard and goes rolling away and Murphy clears home base. Steve pumps his fist and in that moment, Tony sees a very different kind of parabola as the remote slips free of Steve’s grip and goes flying right into the TV, jutting there like some sort of obscene arrow.
Bucky approached a baker and, flipping a Reichsmark through his fingers, began asking questions. Steve resumed his stern face and rigid stance, trying to look as intimidating as possible—not a hard feat with these bent, weary people all around. The baker’s face grew more and more terrified, and she shook her head urgently, objecting in what sounded like Hungarian. Bucky’s tone grew sharper still, demanding an answer. Shaking, the woman pointed toward the fortress before collecting her wares and fleeing. The neighboring seller in her stall, filled with greens Steve didn’t know the names for, glared at them and began chewing Bucky out, this time in what was clearly German.
Tony came and came and came, bearing down on Steve as he tried and failed to catch the breath he’d lost. He didn’t care. He didn’t care. The world was a white wash of wonder and he was away, floating, never coming down. Above him, Steve groaned and grunted and bowed, his sweat dripping down onto Tony’s chest.
At New Haven, they pull over so Steve can stretch his legs and Tony can caffeinate. The weather is absolutely perfect—clear blue skies and crisp air, the trees they pass slowly shading toward yellow. Standing next to his bike, watching the line of Tony’s throat as he drinks his coffee, Steve feels contentment settle in his chest like a bird come to roost. Impulsively, he grabs Tony’s arm and swings him into the cradle of his body, careful to steady the hand holding the coffee. Tony looks up with startled eyes, but accepts Steve’s kiss easily enough.
Tony rolls his neck and tries not think about how it feels like several of his vertebrae have ascended into his skull. “Turtle turtle,” he mutters nonsensically, slumping against the elevator wall as the private lift rockets up. His back aches from sitting in his office chair all day, ergonomics be damned, and his temples throb with the threat of a migraine.
“I love you,” he says, kissing Steve’s forehead. “I love you.” His nose. “I love you, I love you, I love you.” Cheeks, chin, lips. Under Tony’s whispered “I love you”s, Steve drifts off into a peaceful sleep.
As though a whistle had been blown, the team leaped into action. Clint slung his arm over Tony’s shoulders and turned to look at Steve. Nat was already at the refrigerator, pulling out a gallon of milk. Bruce brushed past them both going…Tony wasn’t sure where. He blinked and when next he looked, Steve was right in front of him.
“It’s Christmas?” Steve glances at all of their friends fathered round the table. “But you all… Your families.”
“It’ suits you,” he says with a growl, fighting to keep Tony’s hands pinned while he paints more dots on Tony’s skin and shirt. Somehow, Tony manages to get a bit of paint on his fingers and he promptly uses them to smear paint down Steve’s neck. After that, it's a paint war that quickly devolves into kissing with occasional smears of paint spread by questing fingers.
“Ruined? What about how I fucked up the cookies or killed the tree. I was terrified I was ruining it for you.”
“Well, godmother, technically. But I just called her Aunt. Uh. Sorry, I…sorry I never told you. It just never, uh, never came up, I guess.”
Natalia’s hand at his ankle, her fingers a vice, her nails like claws. Steve tried to kick her off, his foot lashing into her nose. He heard a sick crack, but there was no blood, only red rage in her eyes. Still, it was enough that she loosened her hold of his foot, and he bolted forward, scrambling down, down, down.
Tony could feel a thought spiral pressing at the back of his brain, but he closed his eyes anyway because Steve had asked it of him. A moment later, the bed dipped behind him and there was heat at his back, a great swatch of warm naked skin.
He nearly touched the portrait before he caught himself, and instead only stood closer than was strictly necessary. What was a picture of Peg doing in this place? He knew she and Howard had worked together after the war, but that hardly seemed to warrant having a hand-painted portrait of her in his mansion. But then…for the briefest moment, Steve’s treacherous mind whispered “fondue” and he was caught between mortification and deep-seated jealousy.
Six months later, when Tony asks Steve out on a date, Steve brings a huge bouquet of lavender and blue and yellow irises, as well as an obscenely large bag of chocolate covered espresso beans. “I know chocolates are traditional, but I figured with your caffeine addiction…”
“Oh my god!” Tony says, dropping down from the dryer and nearly wiping out on the slick floors. “Our date. I’ve gotta…our reservations, shit. I…”
what it is you ask? For you, an adventure! For us, life and death! I hope you find your American! I hope you learn what our fear is!”
They reached the double doors, and Steve braced himself to open them, waiting for Bucky’s signal to enter. After trading a meaningful look, Bucky shoved his shoulder into the door, pushing its heavy weight back enough for Bucky to slip through. Steve followed, pushing the door shut as he took three-o’clock. Almost instantly, the racket of the storm disappeared.
Could he be saved? Could the others? How did one cure vampirism? Steve wracked his brain, trying to remember
In the town proper, the residents scurried quickly, heads wrapped, bodies bundled against the cold rain. Only a few, ancient vehicles dotted the landscape, with the majority of people traveling on foot, several urging along scraggly donkeys on rope bridles. Steve and Bucky, with their bare heads, were given more than a few suspicious glances as they walked the cobblestone streets. They followed the general flow of traffic until they came to the town market, where wizened people bowed over wares. Tubers, goat cheese, shoes, coats, rare precious tins of sweets. Everywhere there were drab signs of hard times made only harder by the shelling. Evidence of that, too, was everywhere. Buildings with holes, piles of rubble, windows veiled in blackout curtains repurposed from patched old sheets.
“You guys didn’t… I don’t…” He’s completely overruled. The soup is good, albeit completely lacking any sort of Christmas tradition. The chilies, onions, and ginger in it do wonders to make him feel cleared up and warm.
Tony’s workshop was located in a building on the Virginia side of DC. The brick façade was emblazoned with “Stark Industries,” the letters done up in a futuristic font, a star emblazoned in the “A” of “Stark.” To reach the bowels of the building, they passed a series of gates, all of them locked with a fancy key card technology. Perhaps keeping Ross’ warning in mind, Tony didn’t speak as they made their way through the building, passing laboratories and fields of cubicles, production lines and executive offices. In the very heart of the building, Tony ushered him through one final door, on the side of which awaited a cave of wonders the like of which Steve had never seen.
“A bit, but I’m feeling much better, I promise. It’s not often I’ve gotten to have this kind of luxury on the war front. I confess, I’m feeling a bit spoiled.”
For dessert, Tony’s a little more suggestive. Chocolate dipped strawberries, chocolate fondue (Steve told him the fondue story one night, drunk on Thor’s moonshine, and Tony hasn’t forgotten), perfect white peaches split in two, bananas sitting suggestively in their peels, and ice cream on the side. There’s no booze—Tony’s been cutting back and Steve only wants to get tipsy once in a blue moon anyway. Besides, he wants to remember this. He wants
The kid spits indignantly at that, but seems resigned. “If you want a place to stay,” he says, whipping out a map from under the counter, “you’re gonna want The Knoll. Mary’ll treat you right.” He walks Steve through the route and then offers them the map free of charge.
When Tony’s finished his shuddering, Steve rolls onto the carpet and pulls Tony down with him. They lay in a sweaty wet heap, breathing in and out and in again. In a half-doze, adrenaline crash hitting as hard as a battering ram, Steve murmurs, “Show you pie tomorrow. God you’re hopeless.”
Tony is drowsing on the couch when a sharp crack wakes him. He blinks around blearily, trying to figure out what caused the sound, but the apartment is silent and dark. It’s late and he hadn’t meant to sleep, but he’d wanted to wait up for Steve. Tony glances at the glowing green numerals of the DVD clock and frowns; speaking of, Steve was supposed to be home almost forty minutes ago. Tony gropes for his phone and checks for texts, but there’s nothing. How unlike Steve.
“Oh, I think I’m still hungry,” Steve said, reaching for a meat pie. He could put away quite a bit, and he tried to think up a plan as he stuffed himself. He was supposed to be the man with a plan! He could do this.
Suspicious, Tony glances back at Steve again, and then returns to the window frame. He stretches up on tiptoes to get at the top edge, and suddenly Steve is there pressed up behind him, warm and heavy. Chest to back, pelvis to pelvis. He tapes down the top edge for Tony and then drops his hand to Tony’s bare shoulder. “’Cause,” he says again, and his breath is so hot, his touch so inviting. Tony shivers and tries not to press back into his crotch.
Steve is slumped down into the embrace of the couch, birthday hat askew, fast asleep. It’s the most endearing thing. A glistening trail of drool trickles from one corner of his mouth. His shirt rides up where he’s slid further and further into gravity’s embrace, revealing both boxer-brief waistband and tantalizing abs. He’s managed to kick off one sock, as he usually does in bed. Someone had tried to drape a blanket over him, but the blanket has puddled on the floor, only one corner still trapped under Steve’s ass.
The call for departure came at 20:00, and he met Bucky on the airfield, boarding a rickety prop plane that would carry them deep into enemy territory. Bucky looked energized by the prospect of a mission, and Steve, too, felt a certain sense of anticipation. Maybe, with such a long journey back to safe territory, he and Tony’s heated affair might deepen into something stronger, something more committed. Steve allowed himself to daydream on the notion as the plane soared through clouded skies. Five hours later, they were over their drop zone, and Steve and Bucky jumped into the black night.
“‘Cause you, uh…” Steve turns back and finds Tony has taken a few steps closer. He gestures up at his nose and then says, “you got a little something. Just here.” Then points at his cheek. “And here.” And then at his hair just in front of his ear. “Here too.”
Steve steps forward to meet him, freeing his hands and pulling Tony close. “We’ll reschedule. For next week.”
Steve glanced down at the silverware in his hands. Was it real silver? Did that have an effect on vampires? And what if Steve
“Steve.” That was Tony. His voice somehow soft, right at Steve’s ear, almost inside his very head. “Steve, why are you hurting me like this? Don’t you want to be family? Steve, we’re meant to be family.”
Steve grins at that. “Really really.” Reading his signal, Natasha, Bucky, and Sam all rise and make for the door. Steve trails them with Tony at his heels.
Blushing slightly, Stark turned to him. “I’m sorry to go on like this. The moment I heard they were searching for a new engineer to work on the Iron Man armor, I completely cleared my schedule. Don’t tell Ross, but I would’ve done it for free if that’s what it took.”
But he loves Tony, wants to watch Tony grow and change, and to grow and change right alongside him. So he stands and carefully removes all the decorations, trying not to wince when Tony retreats to his workshop, a closed door between them.
It’s Murphy’s law, really, that sends Steve tumbling down, and Tony only just gets his hand out in time to cup the back of Steve’s head and keep him from whacking it hard against the wood floor of the hallway. They both land winded, Tony sprawling on top of Steve, legs akimbo, and after a moment, they’re both laughing, the bizarre tension of the night somehow broken. Downstairs, their poor neighbor bangs at the ceiling with a broom handle, but that only makes them laugh harder.
Tony held up a hand, silently asking Steve for patience. “You’ll still have completely control of the armor’s movements. I promise. But think of it this way. Our fighter pilots only very rarely fight one-man, right? Usually there’s two: one to pilot, one to monitor the skies and fire the weapons systems. Sometimes there’s even more. Sure, there are one-man planes out there, but they’re much more dangerous because the pilot has to do so much multitasking. So I’m asking you to think of me as your co-pilot. I’ll be able to speak to you and you’ll be able to speak to me, and moreover, I’ll follow your orders to the T.”
Within, the grand hall was filled with standing candelabras, all of them lit. A plush red carpet lined the central staircase, vaulting up into shadowing halls and corners. The air smelled faintly of incense.  Steve looked up into the Gothic vaulted ceilings. “What was that you were saying about one of my pulp novels?”
Tony turns in his seat and grins up and Steve’s jaw drops. It isn't that he hasn't seen Tony covered in grease before. Hell, the first time they really met, Tony was up to his elbows in sticky black oil. It’s just that in public, Tony normally makes an effort to be, if not presentable, than at least attractive. The black smear that spreads from his hairline down the side of his face to his jawline is decidedly…well, Steve thinks it's attractive, cute even, but he has a biased opinion. He blinks and realizes Tony is talking, shouting really, through the din of the bar.
Stark was certainly a change from Reed. Reed, of course, was just as passionate about science, but his gaze turned to the stars while it seemed that Stark’s was still here on earth with his fellow man. His lively chatter carried them to a black town car pulled up at the curb, which Stark ushered him into before following, signaling to the driver up front. A partition rolled up between them and the driver and they were off to wherever Stark’s workshop might be.
With his shirt gone, Steve dug into his pockets, producing several condoms and a small bottle of lube, which Tony plucked up curiously. He couldn’t help the laugh. He really couldn’t.
But he wants this Christmas, their first together as a couple, their first as two people engaged to be married, to be special, so he goes all in. He writes up a game plan and presents it to Tony, outlining each step with military precision.
“Well, at least I know I don’t need to punish you. She’s going to eviscerate you. I’m never going to see you again. She’ll send you to Mt. Everest to live out the rest of your days sans wireless. She’ll,” Steve pauses, eyes glittering gleefully, “she’ll take away your phone.”
Tony was just getting ready to open his toybox and relive his peach fever dream when there was a knock at the door. He huffed a breath of frustration and then carefully slid his dresser drawer closed, cinching his robe a little more tightly as he crossed his bedroom. He expected Jarvis, though in hindsight, he couldn’t have said why. What he got instead was a broad chest, a flaming face, perfect blue eyes, tousled hair.
Steve raises an eyebrow at him, his mouth pulling to the side in displeasure. Then, eyes still locked with Tony’s, he leans forward and sets a soft kiss to the bruise.
Thor opens his mouth to answer, but suddenly, Tony’s door bursts open and Steve barrels in, shield at the ready. He’s in his civvies, but that doesn’t stop him from immediately putting himself between the bird thing and Tony.
“Well, it’s been more than a decade since I last donned the armor for a combat situation. I’ve worn it for ceremonies a few times since then, but even that…” Tony has probably seen the reports. He probably knows the state of Steve’s body. “I know with the adrenaline of combat, I’ll probably be able to push through, but I don’t know for how long. And then there’s concerns about collateral damage. This is New York City we’re talking about. I don’t want civilians getting hurt, and if I die, the suit is rigged to explode. Back during the war, that was to keep it from falling into the hands of the enemy, but we’re on American soil right now. I don’t think we need to worry about anyone grabbing it for nefarious purposes. Is there any way we could put pay to the self-destruct protocol?”
He opens his eyes to catch Tony’s warm glittering stare. “Yeah,” Tony says, nose buried in his own cider. “It’s not too shabby.” And then, because he’s Tony, he also glances significantly at Steve’s crotch and wriggles his eyebrows. “Plus the view’s great.”
“Thank you calling them all. For bringing them. I’m so glad, so glad it made you happy to have them here.” They hold each other and cry a bit while the angel on the TV recounts George Bailey’s early life, but finally Tony pulls back and presents the box again.
Mollified, Tony settles back into Steve’s lap and sips at his rock spider, lips coming away dressed with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
Steve looks at the guy, takes in his earnestly hopeful expression and his fidgeting hands, and then sighs. “Sure. Let me just…I’ll gather up some stuff and bring it over. Ok?”
“Hopeless romantic? Me?” Steve says, grinning between kisses. “I’m not the one who filled the bedroom with flowers.” JARVIS tactfully shucks Tony’s left arm repulsor so Steve can slip the ring on and then they’re kissing and laughing in the chilly February draft, right up until the Rupicola lets out a deafening screech.
Steve scuttles down the stairs, wincing as water squelches on the tile. He turns the corner and finds Tony laid out on his back in only a pair of black boxer briefs, phone clutched in hand and water and soap suds trickling around him from the laundry room door. “Tony?”
Tony shrugs under Steve’s hands, but he doesn’t pull away. They stay huddled close until Tony’s coffee is gone, and then they head back out again. As they steadily roll north toward Hartford, the air grows damper, and a bank of clouds appears in the distant west. Steve eyes it warily, but he thinks it’s bearing south. They’ll probably be fine.
“We’ve just gotta, um, gotta get a plastic tarp and some tape and a sheet of oh my god Steve, get your hands out of my underwear, your fingers are freezing!”
“That so?” Steve steps in a little closer, loosing one hand so that he can trace the line of Tony’s collar.
Reaching through the crack, Steve takes Tony’s phone and clicks the “End Call” button. He tosses it in the general direction of the bed and then gets his arms around Tony, holding tight and breathing in the sharp scent of rain and Tony’s cologne. He barely registers Tony speaking through the pounding of his blood in his ears.
“He found me,” Steve replies, leaning against the wall and grinning at them all. Now that all the mechanical wares are organized into plastic tubs and drawers in the guest room, Tony’s place is actually pretty large, and the windows make it nice and sunny. Steve is wishing he was on this side of the building just for the great light.
“Wonderful!” Stark beamed. “My car should be waiting at the entrance.” He gestured Steve ahead of him and fell into step as they moved to the elevator. Though Stark easily matched Steve’s stiff pace without any hint of impatience or frustration, there was still something frenetic about him, a restless energy which, if they were perhaps in the safe dark of a discreet establishment, might have advertised something entirely different to Steve.
“Why didn’t you get his number, Rogers?” he mutters at himself, glaring at the silver lettering on the door. He tries knocking again, so loudly that Tony’s neighbor pokes her head out and glares.
As if to complete clichés, a storm gradually drew down the valley, lightning flashing on nearby peaks. Daylight fell away, leaving Steve and Bucky stumbling up cobblestones slick with rain, glowing almost green in the ominous lightning. Not a townsperson in sight. They crested the central hill just as the rain picked up, and Bucky approached the portcullis of the fortress. As if sensing them, a low, narrow side door swung open, though still Steve and Bucky couldn’t see anyone. Trading looks, Bucky drew his pistol, as did Steve, though he loathed to use it. His shield was too distinctive, though, and he would only pull it out in a worst-case scenario.
As he stepped into the kitchen, he beheld Steve, who immediately caught Tony in his azure blue gaze. He had a peach in hand, and his other hand was fingering the satin lining of the ridiculous box. The moment he had Tony’s attention, he moved into action. The hand that had been at the box rose and oh so slowly slid the panties down off the peach, hooking them on his finger and twirling them ponderously through the air. He’d chosen a bright red pair, and Tony’s eyes followed them round and round until another movement caught his attention. Steve had brought the peach to his face, lips to the fuzz, nose to the stem, and he was inhaling.
Maybe bringing back the enormous peaches from Japan had been a subconscious thing on Tony’s part, but then again, maybe it hadn’t been. He’d been picking through the designer food court at Maruzen and the huge pink blush of peach fuzz had caught his eye. Peaches were a special treat, right? Especially when they bruised so easily coming up to New York from more southerly climates. Peaches would be a nice treat. And they were so…pink. Pinker than any American peach he’d ever seen. And…they were packed in underwear. No one had ever accused Tony of having good impulse control anyway. He had to have them.
Tony’s next breath was shuddering again, his eyes too bright, and Steve could see the kiss coming. He welcomed it and wondered what might have become of this in a different life, in a kinder life. He’d known Tony only a few hours, but somehow, he felt as though he’d known him since the beginning of time, as if this very moment was destined to happen again and again. Their kiss was a soft one, a gentle one, and it ended as easily as it had started, Tony now crying in earnest.
“Sleep,” he said again, now a command. As if to make it a reality, he shifted in his bed, turning onto his other side and pulling the blankets into a tight burrito around him. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on his breathing. It was all going to be fine. Just get some shut-eye and then work on tweaks. And Clint’s arm guards. And a stronger stretch material for Bruce’s pants. Something flame retardant.
“I never want to move again,” Tony says, slumped on top of the dryer, feet dangling. “We must’ve hauled fifty gallons of water.”
Steve shook away the dark thoughts and focused on the town which sprawled before them, nestled in a valley between blue, wooded hills and mountains. Tony was waiting for him. It would all be better once he found Tony.
And in the center of it all was the Iron Man armor. Looking up at it, Steve could see already that it looked significantly different than the last time he’d seen it.
“Yes, I am. Now stay there while I clean this up.” Tony picks his way back across the floor and flips on the lights, flinching at the sudden brightness. He’s aware of Steve’s eyes on him, even as he grabs the dustpan, vacuum, and a pair of his leather welding gloves. Gloves on, he carefully starts plucking the larger shards up and putting them in the dustpan, and once there are no large pieces to hand, he plugs in the vacuum and runs it over the carpet several times. Once he’s satisfied, he shines his camera flashlight down on the carpet and looks over every spare inch of where the glass was, checking for stray grit or shards. Satisfied, he stands up from his crouch and turns to find Steve still frozen in the entryway with the door wide open, a dopey grin on his face.
“Imagine that,” Steve said, tone still teasing. He sobered a little though as he leaned down to press his forehead to Tony’s. “Do you want to? Visit her, I mean.”
“Which is why you’ll still have complete control.” Mollified, Steve turned back to the old girl, tracing her fresh rivets.
“What did I do wrong?” Steve moaned into his hands, trying desperately to hide the burning of his cheeks. “He was right there! Why didn’t I…?”
Damn the man for talking sense. Against his fiery temper, Steve felt reason warring and winning. “So you’d be in charge of weapons?”
, Steve heard behind Tony’s words. After a moment longer looking at Peg’s too-sharp eyes, he turned to Tony. “I bet she’s real proud of you.”
“But the cabin!” Tony says, and Steve turns to look at him quizzically. If he didn’t know better, he’d say Tony’s nearly panicked.
And then he was going up. There were arms under his shoulders and knees, a furnace of heat against his side. Thor’s cape draped over him in what was probably a ridiculously dramatic affectation. He would’ve laughed if he could’ve.
“Now, see. The thing is. To prove to my parents that I’m actually worthy of my inheritance and my cut of the company, I kind of have to prove I’m a responsible adult. And apparently the way one proves one is a responsible adult is not through earning a living wage, but rather through cleaning one’s apartment properly and feeding oneself on more than coffee and doughnuts. Do you see where I’m going with this, Steve?”
Hail stones are bouncing off the ground, big as quarters. Steve winces as the windshield on a car across the way cracks under the deluge. Further down the block, another car is blaring and blinking, its alarms tripped by the insistent, inclement weather. A minutes passes and then another. Tony doesn’t finish his thought.
She spat at Bucky’s feet and turned her face away, crossing herself. Bucky didn’t offer an apology, but he did drop several coins on the table. “For your trouble. And the baker’s.” He said, turning away. To Steve: “The fortress, they say.”
“And I trust you,” Steve murmured, his attention almost entirely on Tony’s hand where it toyed with him. “So I guess I’ll trust her.”
Steve dashes back across the hall and calls Sam, Bucky, and Natasha. “I need the cavalry,” he tells them and then exits again, locking his door behind him. He makes his way back into Tony’s place and finds Tony standing in the center of the chaos looking profoundly confused. Steve points imperiously at the sheet metal and says, “First thing’s first. Let’s get this shit organized. Do exactly what I tell you.”
“Oh my god!” Tony breathes and then leaps up, dashing for the bathroom. Steve follows, pressing past a man who's exiting. Tony is at the brown-stained sink, staring at his reflection with abject horror. He speaks without turning to Steve. “I met a potential investor today. I can’t remember if it was before or after the taxi. Oh my god, Steve, what if I looked like this when I met with her? What if I had this horrible stuff on me the whole damn time.”
“Steve,” Tony says, nodding once and standing up on his tiptoes to try and see over Steve’s shoulder. “Steve, you’re…wow. Your apartment is really clean. Like really clean. That’s…wow.”
Carol is a stalwart sort and waits patiently until Steve emerges from under his desk. “Home. Right now. I don’t want to see you again until the doctor gives you the all clear.”
When he turned to follow Tony and Bambi, he discovered that he’d been left behind. Worse, the old mansion had three different hallways and a staircase all branching away from the foyer. The right-wing looked well-lit, so Steve took off at a trot, hoping he’d catch up before they realized he’d been lagging behind. Soon however, he started to suspect he’d taken a wrong turn. There were no offices, no plaques, nothing to entice donors. Maybe this was storage?
Phillips eyed Bucky the way he might eye a cockroach in the kitchen, champing on the cigar with even more ire. He’d never approved of such a young boy attaching himself to Steve, but it was the least of his worries as the war effort went, and since Bucky was already on the frontlines, not much could be done. At least not while Steve protected him. “I suppose you’re right. Can’t go losing Captain America to the Soviets either. They’d cut you apart like a lab rat just to see what made you tick.”
Tony was treated to the pleasure of watching Steve’s blush crawl down his chest to his nipples, but in retaliation, Steve loosened the robe belt, baring Tony to the humid air between them. “It’s…I…you underestimate how long I’ve been thinking about this.”
Bundled off to bed, he drifts in and out of consciousness, feeling like his head has completely detached from his body. Every time he opens his eyes, though, Tony is there. He provides everything Steve could possibly ask for and many things he wouldn’t, including but not limited to hot tea, cold water, ice cubes, soup, barf bucket, the entire first-aid kit, and a laptop open to WebMD.
“Hi,” says the guy, and Steve freezes, now definitely wishing that he’d thrown on a shirt because it’s hot mechanic guy from next door. Hot mechanic guy waves awkwardly and then runs his hands through his hair. He’s black up to his elbows, and Steve watches in fascination as the engine grease makes hot guy’s hair spike up.
With a sigh, Steve fights his way through the crowd, ostensibly toward the bathroom, but with the gentle curve of his trajectory aiming for the bar. Finally he spots black hair sticking out every which way. No wonder Tony blends in so well. He looks minuscule next to the linebacker sitting on his right. Steve’s heart flutters with a wash of protective feeling and he reaches out as soon as he's in range to touch Tony’s shoulder.
“That’s right. That’s right! Tony! Tony, I…uh…” he turns back to his audience. “Guys, what’s romantic?”
Tony shudders under Steve’s touch, his breath leaving his lungs in short bursts, his stomach flexing beneath Steve’s fingers.
He watched Bucky’s six as they entered back to back, Steve swinging the door shut behind them. Bucky skirted the edge of the inner courtyard, approaching the huge wood double doors covered with ornate wrought-iron filigree. Above them, the stone parapets loomed huge, and the rain picked up even more, lashing in sheets. “Stevie, I feel like we’ve walked straight into one of your cheesy pulp novels!” Bucky shouted over the din of the storm, no longer afraid of being heard given that any sensible person would be sheltering indoors.
“Tried,” he said, tongue thick. It was hard to get the words out. “Tried last night. Laid in bed. Counted. Stuff. Couldn’t.”
“Oh? You did, did you?” Steve asked, sauntering a little closer and hooking his arms around Tony’s shoulders.
“Tony!” Steve takes off again, bowling over two firefighters and hitting Tony like a freight train. He enfolds him in a hug, squeezing so tightly that he feels Tony’s toes lift off the ground and brush the tops of his boots.
Decorating goes so smoothly Steve is almost suspicious. Tony has a knack for the geometry of six-pointed snowflakes and promptly snips out two dozen intricate patterns while Steve folds origami cranes and balloons and pinwheels, all of which go up on the branches, along with Tony’s makeshift LED strand. They top the thing with a metal star punched from scrap copper. It all looks hideously mismatched and folksy, and Steve declares it’s exactly what a tree ought to be. Tony looks disbelieving, so Steve whips up some rock spiders and forces Tony down onto the rug, where he wraps him in a blanket and force feeds him cookies while
Steve breathes a little sigh of relief, because with Tony’s slight frame, he’d been worried the kid wasn’t even eighteen yet. He inhales and says, “Shower. Impress your parents. Come over after they’re gone and have some of the pizza.”
Line by line the profile appeared: likely composition, likely blast radius, size analysis, potential solutions. Not bad little bot. It wasn’t gauging size correctly—something was probably off in the camera aspect ratio, but that was easily fixed. Tony typed back orders and watched with eyes that felt on the verge of shriveling up into dried peas as the bot began procedure. It pried away the main engagement plate and started snipping wires. Beautiful. As dexterous as he’d hoped. And the test was going much better than last time, considering last time the bot had run right over the dummy bomb and technically blown itself up.
“Steve,” Tony finally managed to unfreeze, stepping forward to catch Steve’s flailing hands and stop his verbal vomit. “I…uh, yes? I mean, first. Could you pinch me? Just here?” He held out his arm expectantly and after a moment, Steve bowed to kiss his knuckles.
“You,” Steve says, pointing at Nat and looking at her a bit cross-eyed, “you a pretty dangerous lady. Pretty. And dangerous.”
Steve snorts and sighs in relief as the pitcher finally manages to strike out a third batter. The teams switch places, and it might be top of the fourth, but the Mets are already dragging their heels as they head into their dugout.
“Course not,” Phillips groused, though this time there was at least an edge of humor. He shuffled a few more papers and then said, “You leave on a night jump tonight. Dark flight, dark jump. Civvies. Don’t need your damn star-spangled ass attracting attention. Additional brief is on your desk. Read it. Do your duty. Dismissed.”
Tony gestures to the tree, which, now that Steve’s looking, is a lot worse for wear. Half its needles have made their way to the floor and the rest are a sickly shade of brown. The paper snowflakes, which at first had looked so crisp, now wilt downward with exposure to humidity from the tree stand and heat from the radiator. Steve’s origami has held out a little more sturdily, but in the sparse branches, the little cranes now mostly look lonely.
For a moment longer, Steve holds Tony’s gaze and then buries his face back in Tony’s throat. “Love you,” he whispers.
“Requires precision. I know. And I can be precise! I’m precise all the time! I just…” He doesn’t finish his sentence and instead peels away the template, biting his lip when half the dough comes with.
Steve writes out a list of every Christmas activity he can think of and hands it off to Tony so he can pick the things he’d like to try. Tony still hasn’t really outlined what Christmas was like for him as a kid, and the activities he’s picked out feed more of Steve’s suspicions that Tony’s holidays have been pretty bleak, even before he was snipped out of his family’s lives. Tony’s picked out tree-trimming, caroling, cookie making, gingerbread house building, lights on their balcony, the local Christmas parade, Mass, Christmas goose, volunteering at the soup kitchen, and presents on Christmas morning. Looking at it all, Steve feels suddenly overwhelmed. After his mom passed, his Christmas celebrations had inevitably been with Bucky, and for that, usually he just brought a casserole. His only Christmas decoration has been a fake tabletop tree that came pre-decorated.
