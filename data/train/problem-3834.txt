Sam sighed over the phone, rubbing a hand over his face. “Dean, I can’t even take you seriously when I can only see the top quarter of your face. You’re like an old man fumbling with technology and honestly, it’s disappointing.”
Dean sang softly, lifting Cas’ chin. Cas looked up at Dean, and his eyes were shining brightly in the late afternoon sunlight.
“Why didn’t you wake me up, Cas? We gotta get going on this case,” Dean whispered, because suddenly, the moment seemed too fragile to be talking at a regular volume.
“Alpha?” Dean whispered. Castiel clutched him tighter, and Dean shifted, trying to find a comfortable position. “Castiel!”
Dean wanted to reach out to her, to offer some comfort through touch, but Castiel was sitting right across from him, and he didn’t know how the strange alpha with a claim on Dean would react. “Lisa,” he whispered, and she looked up at him. “You should try to eat, okay? You’ll need your strength.”
“Excuse me for not being up to date on
When Sam and Dean returned to the bunker, Cas was waiting at the war room table for them with a basket full of something that smelled absolutely
Biscochitos (a traditional Mexican/New Mexican Christmas cookie, y’all should look them up they’re delicious)
Charlie laughed. “Santa Claus!”
When they arrived in town, it was bustling with people. Mothers carried crying children along the sidewalk, men in business suits stalked their ways into bars, and groups of teenagers sauntered about like they owned the place and weren't about to do something stupid. A couple of people whistled at their car when Dean drove by, and Dean winked at them. (Though, the whistling was probably for Baby.)
” but it just came out “
“I told him I loved him last night,” Cas blurted out, and Sam hit the brakes. His mouth opened and closed around nothing as Cas rambled on. “He fell asleep in the bath, so I woke him up and then he came and cuddled up to me in bed and it just felt so
There was a low keening noise. Dean vaguely registered that it was coming from him.
“I-I just, I really like you, Dean, and I-I just c-can’t…” Grace began, hiccuping from both the liquor and the crying. Cas looked at her in concern and Dean tried not to think about how cute he was when he was worried. He was surprised when those concerned eyes turned onto him.
part of this
hey y’all :) with in-person school starting up again, things have been a little hectic. I haven’t been able to write much, but this fic IS DONE and I’ll work on writing the second fic as soon as I can
Cas shrugged, folding the corner of his napkin towards the middle. “Just to be more convincing.”
Dean rolled his eyes and was about to follow his brother when he felt a slight pressure on his wrist. He froze, muscles tightening, his blood pumping loudly in his ears.
Cas’ hair was messed up (like it always was), his bright azure eyes gazing softly at Dean (like they always did), his lips perfectly pink and just the slightest bit chapped (like they always were).
A few drinks later, Dean winced as the music suddenly stopped. He looked to his left, where Sam was sitting a moment ago, and saw nothing but empty space. Everything in the bar flashed bright, until he was sitting in the Roadhouse.
Sam looked down, caught. “No?”
Dean shook his head and ran a thumb over Cas’ knuckles before leaning onto his shoulder. “Stop talking.”
“Yes, sir?” Dean asked quietly, and Sam cowered behind Dean.
Well, the peace and quiet outside his mind, that is.
, this young lady was just going to give me her name,” Dean said, but the woman was already getting up to leave.
Was the line some kind of joke? Was Dean too much of an idiot to get the punchline?
“Don’t ruin the moment with low self esteem, Dean,” Cas interrupted, pressing a kiss to his pointer and middle fingers and then pressing them to Dean’s lips.
Well, if these were his last moments, might as well put them to good use.
“Ready, Tisiphone?”
that he let out a huff of laughter.
Dean squinted at Cas and attempted to take a drink of his coke. He cursed when the straw wound its way around his lips and when he finally caught it and took a sip, he looked up to see Cas watching his every move and licking his own lips.
I may have accidentally started to lean towards a secret agent vibe in this chapter, sorry not sorry :)
Dean stuttered a little bit, his brain short-circuiting from the emotional whiplash Cas just given him before he mumbled, “You’re...off.” He sighed again and ran a hand over his face, because Cas had him pinned and Dean was a sucker for those baby blues.
legs are squished, but whatever.”
Dean leaned forward too, because this woman was getting more and more intriguing. “Can I get your name?”
Luke laughed from the backseat, leaning forward in between the driver’s and passenger’s seats. Alastair snickered as he put the truck in reverse.
Y’all know how parents aren’t allowed to have favorite kids?
“Sounds delicious.” Dean wandered off to the kitchen, and Charlie looked at Sam with puppy dog eyes that rivalled his own.
Castiel gritted his teeth, twisted his hand until it felt like his wrist was going to break, and began to saw away at the rope binding his hands.
Castiel stiffened and looked away. “I couldn’t allow both of the tributes to go without an alpha,” he said quietly, and glanced up at Dean as if to see if he bought the answer. Then Castiel quirked an eyebrow and the word

on his side in retaliation.

“Please come to my room, we need privacy to discuss my plan.” Sam pointed at her awkwardly, remembering Charlie’s earlier claim that she came armed with a plan. He hoisted her Hello Kitty duffle bag (which was
“Don’t worry Cas, I trust you.” And he did. Dean had rarely trusted anyone in his twenty-something - how old
Wait. Dean might die. For real this time.
too old for me. That’ll be sixty-six sixty-six.” The kid snorted. “The number of the devil, eh?”
“Cas, what happened?”
Cas stood just over Charlie’s shoulder, his head tilted to the side in a way that reminded Dean of a raven. “Just a bit to the right, then I think it’ll be perfect.”
Sam nodded. “We’d like the twelve foot trees, please.”
leave a comment? let me know what you think! <3
Dean chuckled and ruffled Charlie's hair. "Morning, kiddo. Time to go to bed."
Dean’s breathing was just starting to even out when he whispered, “Hey, Cas?”
“Well that was...unexpected,” Cas said as they both settled into Baby.
“Let’s put the king sized bed to good use, hmm?” Dean asked, raising an eyebrow, and all he got was a quick, desperate nod out of Cas before they were attached at the lips.
“Um, h-here’s your suit. If it doesn’t fit just, uh, le-let me know, I guess. I’ll try to get you another one,” Cas said, squirming under Dean’s gaze and looking pretty much everywhere but him.
"Remind me to never trust you again, Charlie!"
Dean hummed along to the song on the radio as he approached the store. He didn’t usually like country, but every other radio station had mysteriously gone to static and this was the only one working.
Ellen pulled him into a short, professional hug, and then released him. The man popped a lollipop seemingly out of nowhere and began to suck on it while he considered Dean and Lisa.
Before he could delve deep into overthinking that thought, Cas nodded in answer to his earlier question. "Three seventy five. I'll start on the dry ingredients, I guess."
Apparently, Cas had been hanging around Sam for far too long, because the puppy dog eyes he gave Dean nearly broke his heart. Dean rolled his eyes in an effort to save his dignity and grabbed the muffin.
maybe he could last a little longer.
A young man with messy black hair and a trench coat ran through the crowd and up to the stage, almost tripping twice in his haste.
“How does she not remember?” Cas asked Dean quietly.
Dean shook his head and crossed his arms. "I am not riding in that poor excuse of a car. I'm taking my Baby or not going at all." Charlie bounced back against the seat and let out a breath of frustration.
“Oh,” Castiel said, blinking. He hadn’t meant it like that, but then again-
kissed, not how Cas wanted to, and with the way Dean was pretty much drooling while looking at Cas and then immediately looking away, it wasn’t the kiss Dean wanted either.
Well, the kinda-lie.
Sam made a little squeaking noise. “Alrighty, then. Well, she and her ‘pain in the ass’ partner scouted out men who were easily swayed from their partners, wiped the memory of the partner so the vic would die knowing their love didn’t remember them, and then Aphrodite would match the partner with someone else.”
, Dean couldn’t handle that. Things were starting to bubble up inside him and a heart to heart
Cas blushed and moved his hand away from the paper to color lightly with a tan colored pencil.
“Maybe,” Dean said, eloquently, and he took a sip of his beer to avoid saying something vulgar. “I could buy you a drink, though. To make up for it.”
Cas was still laying in bed, looking at the ceiling.
Sam banged on the door of the bathroom and was met with some muffled off-key singing from Dean in response. Sam rolled his eyes as he recognized the song as yet another Taylor Swift song and walked down the hallway.
moment was ruined by Dean’s cell ringing from somewhere in the room.
Sam came to see him before he left.
umm...after that chapter is probably not the best time to ask but...
Dean stared at Cas for a couple heartbeats, watching as Cas’ eyes bounced back and forth from Dean’s face to the road like he couldn’t decide if he wanted to look at Dean or not.
“I have some security camera footage, but before you ask, no, they are not the same person. One of them is even a man, so there aren’t any gender issues with whatever the thing is.” Sam replied, and Dean heard some typing on the other side of the line.
2) my beta and I have a (small) idea of where this fic is going to go, and it WILL take a while to get there, so I will be updating on both Wednesdays and Saturdays from now on (or, I will attempt to, anyways ;))
Laurel flushed, then immediately let go of Cas. “Please do, who am I to stand in the way of young love?” She sighed dreamily.
“It seems as though we don’t even have to try to appear as a couple,” Cas observed, and Dean snorted.
Castiel complied, eyelashes fluttering, because the subtext seemed to be saying
“So,” Lisa continued. “I didn’t know you had an alpha.” Her dark eyes glittered with forced amusement. She was trying to seem carefree, to emulate the feeling of their former friendship, and Dean loved her for it. “When did that happen?”
Charlie pouted, crossing her arms and sticking her bottom lip out. "I like to treat my friends, Sam, and look! Each wrapping paper corresponds to who it's for!" Charlie pointed to a medium sized box that had bacon on it. "That one's for Dean," she said, before gesturing to a small box with little bees on it. "That one's for Cas," Sam was inspecting the bee wrapping paper with a smile when a heavy box thudded against his arm. "And this one's for you!"
Cas practically
“Okay,” Lisa said once they were back in the bathroom huddled by the water. “So, we can talk in here when we need it, and probably in the bathrooms once we get there too. How do we want to play this whole thing?”
He stumbled to the front desk, got a room for the night, and then went and collapsed on the bed, face first.
“I’m gonna say no to
“Dean!” Dean’s dad -John, Castiel had put together- bellowed. The door handle stopped moving for a second, and Castiel held his breath.
this whole fake relationship thing was an awful idea.
“What-“ Sam started, before he cleared his throat. “Well, I’m glad you guys are all okay. Are you coming back tonight or later?”
Pretending to be a beta with Lisa kept Dean from being bent over at any time by any alpha or beta who wanted to use him, and his tenuous claim on her mostly protected her, too.

Castiel looked around at the ever darkening room, trying to either come up with a plan or find something to do besides just
Sam sighed. “‘
of wings, Charlie was alone in the room.
Gabriel sighed and lowered his hand. “I was convinced that while Mother and Father were out you’d be spending your time jerking off,” he explained bluntly, and then he saw the book in Castiel’s hands and looked horrified. “
Cas’ smile disappeared almost as fast as it had appeared. Dean mourned the loss momentarily before realizing Grace was talking to him.
Castiel nodded glumly, brain still coming online. “Are you in trouble?”

Of course he pulled that one. Out of all the prompts he could’ve chosen, he chose the damn
Dean parked the Impala and after giving her a small smile reserved only for her, he walked quietly into the kitchen.
Charlie was the first to shake out of her daze. “Dean, whatcha got there?” She asked, shuffling over to peek into his box.
Her hand dipped into the bowl, and he held his breath, grabbing onto one of Sam’s bony shoulders tightly. Like he could protect him, if he just held on right enough.
Why would he stay?
Dean was about to stumble out of the bar and into a motel room with Grace when he caught sight of a familiar set of blue eyes.

“Sure thing, just let me put my stuff in there first.” Dean said, taking his sweet time finding the key to the trunk and opening it. He then began to slowly (
, and honestly, Dean would be happy to bury him in a shallow grave.
Cas’ eyes remained fixed on Charlie, his brows pulling together, as the other three sang their way through the dark, the only light coming from the twin beams of the headlights.
Dean shrugged, handed his phone over, and strutted into the bathroom, drumming his fingers on his leg and bobbing his head.
Cas’ eyes widened and his head swiveled towards the front of the car. “No,” he squeaked, and yeah, Dean was
Dean smiled sympathetically at her. “There have been some murders recently around town, and the victims were last seen exiting this bar with a stranger.”
Plus, if Castiel decided to use him, maybe Dean could make a blowjob sound appealing enough that he wouldn’t have to suffer through full blown penetration.
thanks so much for all the support!! <3 you guys are awesome
“Aphrodite was infamous for her many lovers, but apparently some of them broke her heart. She’s the goddess of love and blah blah blah, so maybe she decided that she didn’t want anyone else to be broken-hearted because of infidelity? I don’t know man, why don’t you ask her why she was doing it?” Sam asked, and Dean and Cas looked at each other before looking at the splat of black on the floor.
“Wait, Dean, no! I assure you, I have no nefarious designs toward you. I merely wish to talk to you.”
It was posed as a question, but Dean knew never to refuse an alpha. “Yes, alpha,” he nearly whispered, keeping his head low as he scrambled to his feet and followed Castiel, glancing back at Lisa to see worry and fear writ plain across her face.
Dean sighed again and opened his door before casually jogging to catch up to the man who was failing miserably at the part of jailbreaker.
Sam shook himself out of his mini-drooling session, putting on a straight face to keep from smiling like an overly-excited puppy dog. “I found the recipe for Winchester Surprise that Dean keeps hidden in his room.”
Dean nervously ran a hand through his wet hair, spiking it up at odd angles. He took a deep breath and walked out into the bedroom.
Dean nodded, and suddenly he was leaning forward and planting a kiss on Castiel’s cheek.
“Fuck it,” Dean finally said, grabbing a sock (that was disappointingly one of his clean ones) and shoving it in Castiel’s mouth with two fingers.
Castiel seemed to assess him for a moment before he motioned to the bed. “Come on, sit. I won’t bite,” he smiled, and Dean couldn’t help but think
“He’s good with his hands, huh, Dean-o?” Alastair interrupted, winking suggestively in Dean’s direction. “I would know, now, wouldn’t I?”
“No,” Castiel said, firm, picking up the fork Dean had dropped and placing it in his nearly finished bowl of mac n’ cheese. “You’re not going anywhere.”
Dean waved his hand sluggishly. "It's comfy, and it's a beautiful view." Dean mumbled, barely awake, gazing at Cas with soft eyes. Cas smiled down at the hunter.
“I wasn’t ‘jacking off’ at all, Gabe-“
“Uh huh,” Dean said, pulling out his phone and bringing up the picture of Charis’ (supposed) late husband. “Have you ever seen this man?”
Cas groaned softly, a noise that left little cuts all over Dean’s soul with how gravelly it sounded. “It is at times like this I hate urination.”
“Alright, but are you sure you’re oka-“ Dean hung up before Sam could finish.
“Just eat something,” he pleaded. “It’ll help.” It was a lie; he was completely certain that he couldn’t manage food, and he couldn’t expect Lisa to be doing any better.
With that, he hung up, threw his phone face-down on the couch, and leaned back to enjoy his movie.
Dean just about died.
Dean turned his neck, cracking it a little bit. Cas and Sam both looked at him in horror. “What?” He asked, making a face. “What are we thinking here? Witch? Ghost? C’mon, Sammy, you gotta have
supposed to mean?
“Hands at ten and two, now just press gently on the gas-“ the car put on a sudden burst of speed, and both of them jerked backwards against the seat “-I said gently!”
“I will never, ever leave you, alright, Cas? And God help who or whatever tries to kill me, because when I come back I will be majorly pissed. And I know
“So…” Dean said, kicking his feet a little like a kid on a chair that was too big for him. “We should probably lay some ground rules for our, uh-r-relationship?”
Castiel pressed his lips to a spot just behind Dean’s ear that made him shiver again. “I know, sweetheart. I know.”
Dean tried not to think about the traitorous part of his brain that wanted to fall asleep like this for the rest of his life.
Dean nodded and walked towards the house, the earth tilting and swaying dangerously as he moved forward. He heard Sam shuffling along beside him, but couldn’t look over at him or he might end face planting in the cold gravel.
Dean immediately backtracked, throwing his crazy train of thought into reverse. “It’s a joke, Cas. Innuendo.”
You guys are awesome! I hope you know that :)
Dean stopped twirling to take a bite of his cookie. "'Tis great, m'lady." He said, a mouthful of crumbs tumbling out of his mouth. Cas and Sam wrinkled their noses in unison.
. Dean couldn’t tell if he loved it or hated it. It was a mix of something sweet overlapping with something incredibly sour, like someone had smelled the awful thing and was too lazy to really do anything about it, so they just sprayed it with something nice smelling to cover it up.
Dean sang, his face turning red.
“I’ll tell you if you answer my question first.”
The man slumped back in his seat, defeated.
Dean forced out a laugh and a whoop as Alastair flew onto the main road, making Dean hit his already tender face on the window. “Newest car had a dude in it, didn’t know ‘till after I was driving away. Dad’s gonna ask for a random or some shit.”
He opened the door to the bathroom and heard the unmistakable sound of music coming from an old record player.
The gravel crunched under his feet, uncomfortably loud and threatening capture in the semi-silence of the night.
Whoa whoa
“W-what if we’re overdressed? What if we’re
It seemed as though no matter what he did, no matter who he trusted, it always came back to bite him in the ass. And this time, it could’ve gotten the Winchesters killed.
Dean raised an eyebrow at him. He swore he recognized that man from somewhere-
Sam obeyed, turning in the opposite direction while Dean watched, numbly, as Luke put Alastair in a chokehold.
Meh, that line seemed to have been blurred a long,
Charlie watched as Dean stalked down the hall, wrapped in his blanket that he had discarded in favor of playing games, and fought the urge to happy dance right then and there. Cas stood awkwardly breathless at the head of the table before turning pointlessly in a small circle and mumbling a goodnight to Sam and Charlie.
, qui- Cas, I’m furious! Sammy, c’mon man, I’m your brother!” Dean exclaimed and he fought the urge to run a red light purely out of rebellion against his goody-two shoes little brother. “I mean, seriously? It only has
A knock sounded on the door. Castiel picked up his book and sighed loudly, like whoever was on the other side had interrupted some very important reading time (instead of some very important
“He is,” Dean agreed, the tension leaking out of his shoulders as he focused on his little brother. “Sammy’s a good kid, he shouldn’t be here.”
There was
“Alright, let’s just push off the wall, then. Nice and easy for our first time.”
Laurel gasped. “My, my, Castiel, that is positively breathtaking!” She practically ripped the piece of paper out of his hands and brought it up to her face, all up-close-and-personal. Laurel gracefully grabbed some small glasses from a pocket in the folds of her skirt and perched them on her nose. “I can definitely see the resemblance to one of our...
"You couldn't have just gone with it, dude? Seriously, she's
“No, you’re just so cute when you’re trying to be all proper,” Dean said, and Cas’ cheeks reddened.
Dean fell to the ground on his ass, and then immediately began to scramble back up to catch up with the man. Well, then he realized that the man was tripping over him (his crotch getting right in Dean’s face for a moment) and face planting into the compact dirt.
Dean paused for just long enough for him to see Castiel turn a bright red before turning back to his work, choosing to ignore the comment like the mature nineteen year old man-child he was.
I hope you enjoyed it :))
Dean hummed in agreement and pressed the buttons to preheat their oven. He stood up and turned around, leaning on the counter. Dean was about to say something about mixing the wet ingredients (with a smirk, because he has the dirty mind of a middle schooler) when his eyes widened.
I am ALMOST DONE with this entire fic, I have two chapters left to write and then the posting schedule may be updated...
“Hey there!” The woman called. “Just a moment, please,” her head disappeared behind the door again.
also this is where the lore starts to get a little questionable but whatever
Cas' eyes widened at the 'your angel' comment.
Dean deflated. “I’m brainstorming, okay?”
Cas sighed. “Well, I liked your sculpture.” He said under his breath as Dean moved to get up to grab some cardstock and scissors.
Cas sang out loudly, and he immediately raised his (now empty) hands to his mouth.
Melissa stood right behind Castiel, her hair matted and sticking up wildly like she had put her finger in an electrical socket.
(Castiel hated bananas. Eating the fruit was like deepthroating a mushy...maybe that was just the way Gabriel ate them. The point is, they drove him
Dean sighed when he stepped in the shower. He let the scalding water hit his head and run over his body for a moment before he moved to start his

particular anxiety-inducing train of consciousness, Cas sat down next to him.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay, I’m right here.”
The woman glanced at Dean, who was panting next to her from all his super-spying and looking over at a large pond with swans in it (because the place totally needed fucking
Dean flushed. “Well, yeah. And I already have a match, so you can go to hell.”
Please enjoy:)
“I am. May I ask your names-” she squinted at Cas’ badge and Dean’s badge, which he had just managed to gather the wherewithal to get out. “-agents?”
Dean meant to laugh, but it came out as another yawn.
“Dean, I don’t know what a good tree looks like in terms of Christmas trees.” Cas said, squinting up at the top of the tree. Dean sighed audibly.
The stranger managed to pluck himself out of the -ouch, were those rose bushes? Who even kept rose bushes this far out of town?- and began running again, this time with a limp.
Dean shut his laptop and stood up, hoping to defend his dignity. “I don’t watch Hallmark movies! It’s just...a-a guilty pleasure?” Dean winced. That’s not how he had meant it to come out.
thing to say that he couldn’t help it.
hadn’t wanted to do this.
“Well, um-shall we?” Cas asked, breaking the awkward silence that had fallen over them before motioning to the door.
Charlie laughed, shaking the man’s hand. “We love our tree, thank you. It
, his legs swinging back and forth as he whisked a bowl full of something. His eyes were tracking Dean as the elder Winchester twirled around the kitchen with a pan of cookies and an oven mitt in one hand and a single cookie in the other. Charlie and Sam shared a grin as Cas laughed when Dean hit his hip on the counter.
A string of screamed curse words could be heard from the other side of the door, presumably from downstairs, and Castiel turned around, covered Sam’s ears with his hands, and led him back to the bed.
“Dean,” Castiel said softly, turning down the volume on the TV. Without the sound buffer, they could hear some music (and maybe some snoring?) coming from Meg’s bedroom, but Dean chose to ignore it. “What do you need?”
Dean resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at Cas.
“Dean? Are you awake?”
“But,” Castiel continued, stirring Dean from his thoughts. “I admire your loyalty. However, if you ever needed a place to stay, you could stay here.”
Dean made a small sound of contentment as he wiggled in closer to Cas’ body heat.
Dean turned and continued walking, tugging Sam’s hand along behind him, tempted to call Cas’ name.
Ah. That explains a lot.
If anybody has any other ideas for presents between our two favorite idiots (or even Sam and Charlie), please leave a comment and I’ll do my best to incorporate it somehow.
"The hell?" Dean exclaimed, readying himself for an attack from any number of monsters. He got hit again in the stomach, but this time he managed to grab whatever was hitting him. It was soft, light, and smelled like fabric softener.
“I’m s-“
“No,” Dean retorted, startling a surprised intake of breath from Lisa beside him. You didn’t say no to an alpha, ever. It just wasn’t done. Dean chanced a look up at Ellen, and saw her giving him a sad smile. “No,” he said again. “It’s a valid response. We’re going to die, I don’t see why I have to be polite about it.”
“Not in trouble, just somethin’ I gotta take care of,” Dean finally said, leaning forward and pressing his lips gently on Castiel’s, feather-light.
say?”
Charlie nodded. “Nothing I couldn’t handle, Samuel, you should give me more credit.” Sam chuckled.
Castiel gasped in a breath and attempted to comply.
Dean blinked. “Erm-“ he stuttered, face heating. No one had ever really asked him that before, save for those people that had looked down their noses at him, like he was an animal, when he’d ask permission to use the restroom in his own house or ask to be fed. There was no bite to Castiel’s words, and that threw him off guard. “I think I need to-“
Cas nodded again, snapping his fingers multiple times. With each snap, a dozen more ornaments appeared on the top half of the tree, perfectly placed, dazzling in the light.
When he got to the first floor he closed his eyes and listened for any movement, but when he didn’t hear any, he sprinted to the kitchen door that he had come in through.
“Um-“ Castiel said, and a worryingly loud clattering came from downstairs followed by a groan of agony and a whimper.
breakfast. Thank you, handmaiden.” Charlie saluted Dean with her fork and he rolled his eyes again and mumbled under his breath. She winked at Sam.
type of gal when it came to Christmas stuff.)
Nope, Dean wasn’t gonna go there. He sighed.
let me know what you think!! theories, anger at cliffhangers, love...anything is welcome :)
Dean stiffened, and began searching his room for a gag he could use on Castiel. “I ain’t reading no books. If you got any problems with my hospitality, you can go ahead and shove it up your ass.”
Well, alright then. Dean guessed they were driving.
“Now, sleep,” Dean said, carefully climbing off of Castiel. Castiel opened his eyes and blinked, shivering as a wave of cold air replaced Dean’s comforting body heat. “I guess I should ask if you need anything first.”
“C’mon, Dean, she’s really been looking forward to this.” Sam said from out of nowhere, kicking Dean softly in the ribs.
Once John had found out, he had started making Dean work more and more in the garage until eventually Dean had just dropped out of school.
Besides, Dean wasn’t really that funny.
“Hey, there, stranger! What are y’all looking for today?” A thin man with kind eyes and an elf hat came strutting up to the driver’s side window as Sam pulled into
Castiel wasn't sure if the sentiment was meant for him or just something the stranger said whenever he woke up, but his face instantly turned red regardless. The boy shook himself out of his sleep, then looked around, squinting.
Cas shrugged, like it was no big thang. “Just a simple Greek memory spell. I’m not sure how she managed to make it work so well, but it was broken when you admitted your feelings for me through prayer.”
“We don’t have much, I was supposed to go shopping today. Sorry,” Castiel said, shrugging as he sat down with a plate much smaller than Dean’s.
The water still stayed in the bucket, like there was a clear lid keeping it from spilling out onto Dean’s face.
(he was unconscious, after all, but that’s no excuse), and as Dean dragged him unceremoniously to the waiting Lincoln, he no doubt got rocks and dirt in places where rocks and dirt had no right to be.
Dean could feel his mouth quirking up, just the slightest, and his mind returned to his body a little bit. He was aware his hands were clutching Castiel’s pants, and he could feel their coarse fabric, like they had been washed too many times. He could feel the soft carpet under his knees, and he wasn’t just observing anymore.
Dean looked confused. “Dude, I bought most of this stuff anyways.”
“So, a date, huh?” Dean asked, and Cas stopped laughing and looked at his beer, face downcast.
at this restaurant. Besides,” Sam said, smirking. “I’ve heard they have a five star rating.”
it’s a day early, ‘cause I’m going to be traveling all day tomorrow, so...
“Oh my
Castiel tilted his head and nodded, and Sam’s face almost looked scared for a moment before he schooled his expression, pulling his knees up to his chin.
“I’m nineteen,” Castiel said, and Sam tried to hide a smile but failed miserably. “What?”
Dean Winchester, you should be able to figure it out.”
Cas glanced at Dean. “Yes?”
Aphrodite sighed, cupping Cas’ cheek with her hand. “You
“Where are you guys going, again?” Dean asked suspiciously as soon as he had regained the ability to talk.
“Too easy.”
“Can we go back to the hotel? I’m tired,” Dean said after a moment of thinking of all the ways that Cas reminded him of the ocean, and Cas pulled back just to give Dean a look that said
He stood up, wincing as the movement sent a wave of stinging through his side, though the pain would probably be gone over the course of the next day.
“Dean,” Castiel said suddenly, pulling Dean from his thoughts.
“It’s late, maybe he and Cas are finally working out their...problems,” Eileen suggested, and Sam perked up.
When he finally got to the warm library (so warm that he could feel that weird pain in his fingers that meant they were defrosting too quickly; not that he was complaining), Castiel shook off the snow and took in the peaceful atmosphere of his favorite place on campus. He might hate studying, but libraries had always been a favorite hideaway of his. He walked towards a near empty table and sat down, ready to begin his torture.
“Yes, Cas, brushing your teeth is something that you have to do before bed. If we’re going to be sleeping together, then you have to do it.” Dean paused, halfway through untying his shoe. “I-I mean, if we’re going to be sleeping in the same bed. ‘Cause we wouldn’t be
“Am I going to have to tie you up, Castiel?” Dean asked, his voice a mere growl, ‘cause he was through with today’s bullshit.
else, but Castiel was an optimist.) He heard pages turning, someone humming softly to a song he didn't recognize, a stifled fit of giggles coming from one corner followed by a "shhh!"
The question was warranted, but it struck Dean as so incredibly
Cas shrugged again, looking completely petrified of the ingredients covering the counter. "Dean, wh-?" Cas asked, his voice small.
Castiel took it and held it up to his ear hesitantly. “Hello?”
Dean started at the sound of his name, then immediately regretted it. His head was
“I have a wondrous scheme to get our boys together.” Sam motioned to himself. “No, not you, you fool. I have a full-proof plan to get Dean and Cas together by Christmas.”
Dean sighed, and crossed the distance between them with his arms out. He folded Cas into a hug. “Fine, fine, just don’t act all hurt and gloomy, you’re making me sad.”
“Hi, Castiel. Did Dean already go downstairs?” Sam asked, his voice small as he sat down on the other side of the bed.
Cas nodded. “If that’s what you would call both of us almost dying, then yes, very exciting.”
(while it lasts)
“That’s when I started singing too!” Cas exclaimed. Dean looked at Sam, who’s eyes were wide.
Cas sighed, tears welling up again. “I just-” he started, but his voice broke and his throat felt like it was swelling shut. Dean shushed him gently, pressing his lips into Cas’ hair again and humming softly.
Dean winced and shared a glance with Sam. He was sitting on the old, battered couch in the barn, Sam on his right and Alastair and Luke on his left. Crowley and John were standing in front of them and arguing like they had been for the past forty five minutes.
“Do you need help?” Dean asked, putting a hand on the man’s shoulder.
” Dean said instead of putting the kid in his place. He forced his lips together and the rest of the lyric came out muffled.
. Cas couldn't even figure out how to put the skates on and sat next to Dean, quietly observing the people laughing and smiling as they drifted across the ice.
sorry for the late update (again), but... Life, yet again. :/
literally had the word
“You coming?” Cas asked when Dean opened his door. Dean nodded and took a deep breath before he joined Cas in the parking lot. The smell of salt was distinct in the air, and suddenly Dean wondered just how close they were to the beach. Cas turned to him. “Are we a couple again, or just friends?”
old, was he?)
Cas felt his lip quiver slightly, but schooled his expression before anything else could slip through. “How are you, Dean?” He asked, his voice tight.
“Up the stairs,” Dean said into Castiel’s ear so he could be heard over the TV, and he was sure he felt Castiel shiver.
Yes, it would indeed be very bad. Naomi and his father, Chuck, would have the police on his ass almost before he even began to consider where to go (because he
Cas beamed back at Dean as they both went outside into the crisp air, song lyrics bouncing around in the back of Dean’s brain. Before he opened the door to Baby, he looked back at the bar and gave in, singing
"Pillow fight!" Charlie screeched through the dark, bringing another pillow down on Dean's back. Sam assaulted Cas with a pillow as the angel let out a string of obscenities that made Dean proud.
“Good morning, honey,” Cas said, his fingers wandering down the side of Dean’s face before finding their way back into his hair.
Dean smiled at him, a dimple Cas had never seen before showing up in his cheek before he shook his head and sat the tray in front of Cas on the bed. “Your hair…” Dean said, spinning his finger in a circle on the side of his head. His voice was the sound wave version of happiness, and Cas realized how little he heard Dean talk like that.
Cas thanked the man and grabbed the room key, gently steering Dean to the elevator with a hand under his elbow.
and a heat suddenly unfurled all over his body. “Later, Sam.”
please don’t murder me?
Castiel, the angel?
Dean pulled it away from her prying eyes. “Nunya beeswax, Charles.” He glanced at Cas as he said this, and the angel looked back at him, utterly baffled.
“And here you are, sulking with me when you could be engaging in sexual activities with that very pretty young woman.” Cas continued while Dean’s mouth was opening and closing around words like a fish. “I’ll be right back.”
Dean stifled a yawn, the exhaustion of the day catching up with him. “Okay. I think I believe you.”
San shrugged, yawning again. “I guess you guys can go to the bar, just try to go right when it opens so you don’t have to deal with too much of a crowd. Be careful, though.”
“And?”
He ran out the door and was immediately hit with a wall of rain. He squinted, looking for
“Di-did you already turn off your angel-ness?”
The thought made him stutter a little bit, and Cas looked at him with his head tilted in that adorable way of his.
Sam leaped up, fidgeting nervously with the rope that was hanging limp in his hands. “I’m really sorry. I-I can’t let you go. I want to, I really do, ‘cause you’re cool and I think you’d be good for Dee, but I can’t.”
.” Charlie said, covering for Dean, who had begun sputtering out random words and sounds.
Cas huffed, before settling back into Dean’s side. “If I’m acting that way, it’s because I’m
“We always are, Sammy. Always are.” Dean said, and Sam hung up. Dean sighed.
Sam looked over to Charlie to see her with at least two cookies in her mouth and three more in her hands. She looked at Dean and Cas in awe.
Dean wasn’t sure what to do.
Sam announced, gesturing for Cas to sit.
They still acted like they were together, though, because while petite, dainty Lisa was obviously omega through and through, Dean could pass for a beta most of the time.
Sam pressed a small golden charm on a length of twine into Dean’s hand. “It’s a good luck charm,” he told him. “It’ll keep you safe.”

Dean couldn’t lie and say the rose petals didn’t add a nice touch.

Grace took his money and the tears immediately stopped. She stood up and spat in his face, walking off towards the door with her middle finger in the air.
Charlie flipped him off from over the top of the curtain before waltzing out in a pair of jeans and army boots that looked the same as every other pair of jeans and army boots she had tried on in the past hour. "I really like these jeans, Dean." She did a squat, checking out her butt in a full length mirror. "Whaddya think? Good enough for hunter stuff?"
He looked so...peaceful when he slept. When he was awake, Castiel had a tenseness that he seemed to carry like a weight; when he was sleeping, he looked relaxed, like he could finally escape into a world without worries.
one more chapter guys!! I don’t know whether to be excited or dread it :)
Dean had never made cookies before. Ever.
Cas wasn't really sure what to expect. Maybe a shopper here and there, a bunch of shops inside a building (no different than a main street in a small town, really.)
Castiel leaned forward, imperceptibly, and Dean found himself glancing down to his lips before he could stop himself. They were plump, and slightly chapped, and Dean was actually surprised by this. The dude worked at Walgreens, why the fuck couldn’t he just lift a chapstick from the counter or something?
Dean rolled his eyes and pronounced every word. “I’m. Just. Tired. Today. Charles. Leave. Me. Alone.”
Castiel saw it happen in slow motion; the glass quivering as it hit the floor, the spider web of cracks appearing and then shattering like a broken puzzle.
Cas was wearing an all black tuxedo with a cobalt blue tie, which may not sound like a lot, but
last night instead of something to help the case.
“Soon to be Agent Trevor as well.”
“I love you.”

“Yeah, but I guess they didn’t want to show. I mean, why would they? Who
Now, Dean had thrown the measly amount of food they had (the moldy bread and cheese in the refrigerator didn’t count) into a bowl and prayed to a God he didn’t believe in that he’d be there the next day, able to make something out of the gift packages given to each District on Reaping Day. And that Sam would be there to eat it.
It was a twisted thought.
he had done what he did.
Dean attempted to wave a hand, but he was really just too exhausted. “Listen, I’ll pay you back for the food, and the first aid stuff, and the trouble I’ve caused you, but I should probably get going.”
“Look at me, please.”
Tisiphone roughly grabbed a handful of Dean’s hair and pulled his head up, his neck straining at the awkward angle. “I’d take a deep breath if I were you,” she growled, and Dean’s eyes widened.
sausage, so he steered clear of that. He was about to take a bite of his eggs when Dean stood suddenly.
the final chapter will be posted on Friday!! :))
Sam sighed and put his hand out, tilting it side to side. “‘s okay. There aren’t many kids my age so I don’t have many friends, but that’s alright because my grades are really good and I have Dean.”
Dean turned to the angel sheepishly. “It sucked, and you know it. I think I’m gonna try something else.”
Cas said, folding his hands on the table and looking so fiercely determined to win a game that Dean choked on his coffee.
and I made a bunch of prompts for charades. Shall we vote, my knights?” Charlie said from the head of the table, two hands on the wood like she was delivering some very important news. Cas and Dean sat to her right, and Sam sat next to the chair saved for her on her left.
Dean almost added ‘with
“Dean, you do love alcohol, no matter how many times I try to dissuade you.” Cas said from the back seat. Dean
The guy had
“Thank you, and thank you for all your help,” Dean said as he walked towards the door. Ambrosia waved at him, and when he opened the door, the melodic bells tinkled again.
Dean looked at him with soft eyes, and noticed he was scared. Dean contemplated going over to give Cas a hug, and almost did, but that would certainly be a non-platonic, non-bro thing to do, so he settled for humor. "Oh, c'mon Cas, they're just cookies, they won't bite. Worst thing that can happen is they don't taste good."
…” Dean sang, using the shower head as his microphone.
He was thirsty as fuck, too. He was glad he was decently flexible, because even though his hands were still tied, he was able to reach over to the nightstand to grab his mug from the night before-
Dean shifted on the bed, worrying a throw blanket between his fingers. He looked up and met Castiel’s eyes, something he knew Castiel would recognize as a gesture of trust since most alphas would punish him for being so presumptuous. “You just wanna help?” he asked, his voice small.
“Thank you,” Cas said, leaning his forehead against Dean’s.
. Do you realize how much you make me laugh, or how much Sam and I need you to keep us from slitting each other’s throats?” Dean gestured loosely in Sam’s general direction. Cas’ ocean irises flitted back and forth between Dean’s eyes, searching for any sign of deceit and maybe even something else. Dean took a deep breath.
Charlie looked at him in confusion. “It’s a drive-up light show, Dean. We stay in the car.”
Cas swallowed loudly. “I can’t say it or I’ll give it away, Dean.” He laughed nervously, and the laugh died on his lips as he re-folded the paper and dropped it to the floor.
He shrugged it off; the neon signs in the front windows weren’t buzzing, so maybe they didn’t open ‘til like eleven or some shit on the weekends.
Long after the meal was over and Ellen and Castiel had wandered away, Dean and Lisa sat in the empty dining car in silence.
“Good morning,” she said, leaning in close to the microphone.
He was mentally preparing himself to gently rock the stranger's shoulders when the man let out a snort, followed by a groan. Castiel watched with wide eyes as the stranger sat up straight and rubbed his eyes, the side of his face red and lined with indentions from laying on the textbook for hours. His hair was sitting flat on the right side of his head, the top and left side totally messy from Castiel's wandering fingers. The boy smiled sweetly through a daze, mumbling a "Good morning, beautiful," in a deep voice that was still woven with sleep.
He chanced a look over to the female omegas, where he saw Lisa, standing next to one of her friends. They were tightly holding hands.
Time to pull out the big guns.
Cas gave Dean a wary glance before saying, “Winchester.”
Dean was about to say something along the lines of “yeah, yeah, adios,” but then his brain registered what Sam had meant.
Castiel let go of a wheezing laugh that tap danced dangerously close to the line of sounding insane as he slowly turned around, looking above the toilet to see the window.
“What, Cas?”
“How old are you, Sam?” Castiel asked softly as the sudden urge to take care of this
“Dude, I think
slowly, letting his anger out through his eyelids. He took a deep breath.
A door opened somewhere in the hallway.
“Dean,” Castiel said on an exhale, the bed shifting as he slowly moved towards Dean’s back. An arm draped gently over his shoulder, a hand plastered across Dean’s ugly, ugly chest. Castiel’s stomach was glued to Dean’s back, and he could feel the other man’s breath in his hair. It sent a shiver through him, which bid another wave of tears. “You’re not going to die.” Castiel’s voice turned stern; a tone Dean had never heard before.
But if
Dean shifted and scratched the back of his neck. “Nope, nothing that I can think of.” Dean squinted at Cas, suddenly suspicious. “Is there something you wanna get off your chest, buddy?”
Dean snuggled into Cas’ side and placed his head over Cas’ heart. “I guess this means I should ask you on another date, then?”
That is all.
The houses lit up green, then red, then a rainbow of all different colors. They seemed to undulate, almost like a crowd at a football game Cas had seen on TV. The wave stopped, and the lights began to pulse gold.
Dean swallowed his mac n’ cheese. “Yeah,” he replied, voice hoarser than he meant for it to be. “I just-“
Cas had started to walk towards the garage, all victorious and proud of himself, when Dean added, “And I let Sam drive
He sighed as he laid down on the floor next to the bed, so
Dean glanced at the curious expression on his brother’s face before scoffing. “It’s an
And Cas had become addicted to that look, wanting it, hoping he could get it again by saying three simple words that he physically couldn’t keep inside any longer.
Dean nodded as he gently wiped some blood off of Castiel’s side. There weren’t that many scrapes along his torso, but they were fairly deep and were bleeding a lot more than they should be. “Mhmm. He’s gonna make a demand soon, once he wakes up. Speaking of, when were you gonna tell me your stepfather was

Dean would die before he let that happen.
Sam shuffled towards Dean’s bed, laid down next to him, and curled up into Dean’s side, clutching the stuffed dog Mary had given him before she-
The man pointed across the hood of the truck. “Just over there a ways, you’ll know ‘em when you see ‘em.”
The kid behind the counter looked at him like he had lost his marbles (which, maybe he had). “I got a girlfriend, man. I don’t swing that way.” He said, reaching for a package of bacon to ring up.

Dean looked up at Sam. “N-no.”
Well then. It’s not like Dean needed to breathe, anyways.
Dean opened the door and felt the truck rock as he got inside. “The strip mall in town, that’s where she is.”
Castiel’s face darkened. “It’s a small District,” he mumbled, and Dean looked at him, confused. Then Castiel was standing, tossing the pillow he had been fiddling with onto the bed. “It’s not of import. Shall we go to lunch?”
Castiel glanced at his mother, held up his finger, and replied to Dean in two simple words.

After a delicious breakfast complimentary of the hotel, Dean dialed Sam’s number. Sam picked up on the second to last ring and looked like he had just woken up.
Sam grumbled something and shifted into a sitting position.

Castiel heard John walk away and he relaxed.
Cas fussed with his hands, shifting himself to both get Dean comfortable and to hide the rapidly rising heat between his legs. "My-my legs probably aren't very comfortable, do you want-"
Castiel nodded, and he said something that sounded vaguely like ‘I’ll just wait here, then’ but Dean couldn’t tell because he was already getting out the door and closing it behind him.
“God, I wish I could kill
She’d been an omega, like Dean, and she’d been reaped. She’d been beautiful and kind and loving, the kind of person that made you wonder why the Capitol hated omegas enough to throw them into an arena and make them kill each other.
Well, that certainly wasn’t what Dean was expecting. He didn’t quite know how to react, so he looked out his window and asked quietly to the darkness outside, “Do you need me to drive?”
Dean blushed and looked away. “Yeah, about that-“
Cas sighed. “I believe so, I’m just concerned for your well being. Is there something you’re not telling me?”
He, at twenty-one, was entered six times. Sammy, at sixteen, once.
The one where Sam and Charlie begin step one of their diabolical plan: picking a Christmas tree.
“You want to leave before dessert?” Cas asked, closer to Dean’s face than he was the time before. Dean licked his lips, and Cas’ blue eyes followed the movement.
didn’t enjoy the feeling.
Cas blanched, then looked down at the ice below his feet. He looked back up at Dean with...hurt in his eyes?
In a totally platonic way, of course.
"Tell me something only you would know," Sam said. He glanced at Cas and all the color drained from his face, as the angel was still repeating "I love you, Dean," and looking at Dean with empty, burned out eye sockets.
The Impala promptly swerved a little bit as Dean reached over to straighten the steering wheel.
“That’s not-“
“Ah yes, here it is! Room four-oh-seven,” the concierge announced after a few moments of frantic keyboard clacking and internal crises. “Please enjoy your stay, gentlemen.”
Cas took a deep breath, nodding as he squeezed Dean’s hand. “Okay,” he said, releasing Dean’s hand to grip the steering wheel.
Castiel sighed. He’d been hoping to avoid this. “Carver Edlund,” he said quietly, and Sam looked like he was about to either pass out or get up and scream. “But his real name isn’t as cool, his real name is Chuck Shurley.”

Dean held up a hand and sighed. “Just stop talking. Let’s get this over with.”
Except Dean wasn’t in his chair anymore.
“Cas kept randomly bursting out into song, and he asked me to help him.” Sam said, licking his finger to turn the page of the book he was reading. Dean put a hand behind his neck and toed the floor with his slipper. “Dean, is there something you want to say?”
Dean mulled it over. On one hand, being friends would be easier, they wouldn’t have to pretend to be together, and they wouldn’t have to worry about a backstory, or acting in love, or being affectionate, or-
Dean, who was looking down at his phone, nodded distractedly. “Yeah, I’ll whip up some hamburgers, sound good?” He was texting Cas, asking the angel where he had gone.
this is a chaotic chapter. you have been warned.
I know I haven’t been the nicest to the boys, but I promise it’ll get better :)
“I already knew how to drive, I had read about it and put it to practice whenever you went out. I just figured you would take pride in knowing that you taught me.”
The first thing Dean noticed was how large the room was. It was at least twice the size of any motel room he had ever stayed at, and he marveled at it before he noticed something else.
Cas shook his head. “He might’ve been asleep when I said it,” he admitted, blushing a little bit.
you guys are awesome!!
Castiel looked surprised. “Do you want me to stay?” He asked in his deep timbre, and Dean wanted
something he was prepared for.
“There we go, nice and easy, sweetheart. Good job,” Dean encouraged him, and Cas smiled.
Cas said quietly, his voice barely a melody on the breeze. Dean smiled, more to himself than to Cas, as the angel’s eyes were still trained on his skates.
Gabriel barged in through the door with a hand over his eyes. He opened his fingers comically and peeked through the space in between them.
"Allow me to help." Cas appeared out of nowhere and nearly sent Charlie careening over the handrail. Cas snapped his fingers and suddenly Charlie's arms were empty and her gifts were sitting in a neat pile on the table below. Charlie looked down at her now box-less hands, before looking up at Cas in awe.
Castiel looked back at him, utterly baffled.
"Listen, Cas, you're here so I can teach you how to make some delicious cookies. And baking them is the fun part, or so I've heard." Cas relaxed at this, then looked at Dean with a smile.
Alright y’all, things are starting to get REAL spicy!!
He smiled widely, grabbed the angel’s hand, and mimed walking. Dean pointed at something, and then laughed soundlessly.
“Mornin’,” Dean said, and he shimmied a little bit to stretch. Then he stopped mid-wiggle. “Wait, morning?”
Charlie grinned, happy her plan was working.
An awkward silence fell over the group as they all considered whether or not Cas was trying to make a dad joke (heh again).
would be his soulmate. Not her.”
“So get this,” Sam interrupted, his face lit up an odd color from his laptop. Cas pressed his lips into a thin line and glanced at Dean. Dean barely refrained from patting his hand. “Most of the vics over there were men in their late thirties, and they were last seen leaving a bar with different people. People that were not their partner.”
Sam sighed and grabbed a book. (A
Dean was rolled onto his side by some strong hands and he spit out some more water, coughing hard as somebody patted his back gently.
“Up and at ‘em, Sammy.”
“IIIIIIIIIII-“ Dean sang from somewhere behind them, and when they turned around, they saw Dean singing to a very uncomfortable looking Cas with a nutcracker ornament as a microphone.
They soon discovered that
Cas had upended the whole bag of flour into the bowl, causing a cloud of white to engulf the kitchen. Dean coughed, waving his hand in front of his face to clear the air.
- at Castiel, saying, “Just take the goddamn phone.”
“Sounds good, Charlie!” Sam said, pulling pine needles out of his hair, looking like a chimpanzee-sasquatch hybrid. “Do you know which ornaments you want at the top?”
The woman opened her mouth to speak but then closed it, her eyes widening. Dean tensed up as a figure approached him from behind. “Ready to go, love?”
"What's up, Dean-o?" Charlie asked as she approached Dean. The hunter jumped at the sound of her voice.
Sort of.
if you liked this fic, stay tuned for the second one. I’m not entirely sure when it’s gonna be posted (it might be a while; sorry, Life™️ happened), but it *will* be posted!!
Cas released his grip on Dean, albeit reluctantly, and Dean (regretfully) flew out of bed and ran to the bathroom just in time.
some of you may love me and some of you may hate me after this chapter, but I guess we’ll see :)
Dean melted into the kiss, bringing his hand to the back of Cas’ head and deepening it, tasting salt water and something he couldn’t place, but was so very

Cas smiled. “My husband and I will have the merlot, then. Thank you.” The waiter took their drink menus and walked away.
John snorted and took a swig of his bottle, the liquid making a loud sloshing sound as it disappeared into his mouth. “Right,” he said, before turning to the four boys sitting on the couch. “Move.”
Castiel seemed to understand the weight of the words Dean had uttered, because he leaned forward a few more inches and pressed a feathery light kiss to Dean’s forehead.
The rest of their time arting (yeah, that’s a word now), Dean snuck glances at the drawing Cas had made. It was a man with a sharp jawline and high cheekbones, short hair and large eyes. It was shaded beautifully, and Dean admired the angel’s amazing artistic gifts in the short looks he could steal.
Charlie tsked. “Dean kissed Cas
When Dean got home, it was well past midnight. He had spent a few hours just driving around, enjoying the peace and quiet being on his own brought him. It allowed him to think about Sam, and Castiel, and what the
The man actually shut up for once, which was nice. Dean finally had some peace and quiet to think about what to-
“I mean-you took care of me like you had done it before, aren't you going to do the same for yourself?”
“Dean?” Castiel asked, head cocked to the side in a way that reminded Dean of a cat. “Are you all right?”
. He knew the only reason Charlie had bought the quirky little bug was to obnoxiously clobber anyone and everyone who got near her car. "Now come use your big, strong, muscle-y muscles to help a girl get her stuff inside!"
Dean took one hand off of Castiel’s wrists to push Sam farther behind him. “Yes, sir.”
“Dude, you’re like,
“Eileen, I found it!” Sam declared, managing to waltz into the kitchen with his abnormally long legs.
“Dean, since when do you have ornaments?” Sam asked incredulously. Dean put a hand behind his neck as he glared at his brother.
“So get this, it looks like this witch only kills guys who cheat on their significant others.” Sam said through a mouthful of lettuce.
“We’ll go check out our room and then we can get dinner and lay some ground rules, ‘cause Baby is probably safe, and we need to know how to act like a couple,” Dean whispered as the elevator doors opened.
, how could you do such a thing?” Aphrodite asked quietly, seemingly almost at a loss for words.
Suddenly, hands were pinning Castiel’s shoulders to the bed and there was the gentle yet stern voice whispering in his ear. “Calm the fuck down, Cas.”
Dean smiled, macaroni and cheese steaming into his face. There was a certain peace the dish brought him, the way eating applesauce in the hospital had reminded him of a time when his mother was alive and his father loved him.
"But Dean, who was Charlie talking about and why would they sa-" Cas was interrupted when Dean held up a hand.
“No shit, Sherlock.” Dean took a big bite of his bacon burger (his brain tried to say that ten times fast and failed miserably) and groaned softly, his eyelids fluttering closed.
“Goddamnit, son,” John slurred from the living room, and the only part of him that Dean could see was his hand on a bottle of something.
Dean got up too, and was about to shake Ambrosia’s hand as well when she pulled him into a hug. “You are so lucky to have someone so in love with you. Congratulations again on your engagement,” she said, and Dean just smiled towards where Cas had walked out the door.
life’s been pretty shitty lately, not going to lie, but here’s another chapter because your guys’ reactions give me life.
Charlie stopped, her brain short circuiting. Before she could stumble through an answer, Cas plowed on. “You’ve been acting really weird, and I can’t help but notice that you and Sam have been sharing some particularly worrying looks.” Charlie breathed a silent sigh of relief. Cas hadn’t figured out her and Sam’s plan.

Dean spit the wine back out into the glass and took a bite of steak instead (why is wine so tart, anyway?)
Dean walked into his designated bedroom. It was large, larger than almost the entirety of Dean’s living room at home, and had a king sized bed placed in the middle with a plethora of pillows that were all different shapes and sizes.
“Should we call Sam? See what he’s dug up?” Cas questioned, before studying Dean and adding “If we went to the bar without knowing what we’re up against, you could be in danger.”
, Dean. And any husband in their right mind would be jealous if their true love went on a walk on the beach with someone who wasn’t them! I’m just playing the part!” Cas whisper-yelled, barely audible over the crashing of the waves and the buzz of people, but his words rang over and over in Dean’s ears.
One of those papers had Sammy’s name on it.
Right?
“You and Sam almost
. But yeah, also the cute little hand holding.” Charlie said, guiding Sam over towards a table with a speaker on it. Nobody had been manning the DJ spot when they had first arrived, but an older woman with fluffy earmuffs had (finally) shown up.
Castiel was sitting on the bed, looking at his hands. Dean clasped his hands behind his back and lowered his head, still unsure how to present himself to the alpha.
Well then. What was

smiled. She leaned over onto Dean’s shoulder and snored, which, okay then. Maybe she had done some pre-game and Dean just had to catch up.

Castiel burst into tears. Dean grabbed his head and gently maneuvered it until the angel was crying into his shoulder.
Next, Dean grabbed the casual black pants and the loose green button up Castiel had laid out for him. He looked at himself in the mirror and barely recognized the man staring back; the man in the mirror looked like a Capitol beta or alpha, not a District twelve omega.
Sam rolled his eyes and hung up. Dean whirled around and collapsed onto the bed. He circled his finger up in the air and then pointed in Cas’ general direction. “Do your genie thing, Cas. I want you to make me into a prince.”
The song continued in the background.
Dean’s lips twitched up into a smile, but he felt eyes on him, so he turned away from the view to see a pair of blue eyes staring at him.
“Yeah, no,” Dean said, shutting his laptop and getting up out of the chair he had been sitting in. He was a mere foot away from Cas, but it felt like more. “I’m the only one that drives Baby, and I’m not gonna let you drive her when you’re first learning, she deserves better. What if you crash her or something? I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”
“Uh-it was-good. Great. Wonderful.” Dean squeaked out, looking at his feet and shuffling past Cas. Cas tilted his head. “Listen, man, I’m gonna go take a shower, alright? Can you put these away for me, please?” Dean held out the bags to the angel.
"Charles, you are one crazy chick." Dean called as soon as the two were in earshot, and Cas caught Charlie's stare with sad eyes before dropping it in favor of his holy tax accountant shoes.
The man nodded curtly. “Can you ask Sam if we have a reservation?” Cas asked Dean, his voice barely a whisper. Dean nodded and whipped out his phone.
, period.
“I learned from my brother. He went to culinary school before -“ Castiel cut himself off and pushed his eggs around with his fork. “He taught me how to cook.”
Cas nodded immediately, making Dean wonder if Cas had the ability to watch his dreams. He blanched. Dean sure
Dean groaned and paused whatever cheesy movie they were about to start before grabbing his phone and answering the video call.
Dean blinked at Cas once. Twice. Thrice. “You can do that?” Cas nodded. “What would these...basic human needs consist of, exactly?”
“Dean!” Cas’ voice came through the parking lot, and Dean saw him walking towards Baby.
“I’m just...gonna go inside. It was nice talking to you-“ the woman cut herself off, then smiled, and Dean realized he hadn’t given her his name. She brushed some sand off her dress and hurried off.
Cas looked taken aback by the question as he was cut off mid-bumbling explanation. “Well, it was an anonymous site, so I just have a username.”
“I’m fine, why, you want to join me?” Castiel said, searching for a weapon or something when he realized there was a shower and that the white curtain was swaying slightly.
“But tax evasion is a federal crime, Dean. Not all humans are criminals,” Cas pointed out, though he seemed happier after Dean had run his hand through his hair.
Dean could feel his anxiety beginning to boil up inside his chest, and before it could bubble over, he grabbed his awful sculpture of a tree (he thought it was a tree; he wasn’t really sure anymore) and forced it back into a ball of clay. He always felt like destroying things was what he was meant to do, whether it be monsters, clay sculptures, or his relationship with his best friend.
“Hello.” Cas said after a minute, looking at Dean like he would hold the answers as to who this woman was. Dean shrugged in response.
book, is there?”
“Caaaas,” Dean said, his voice bouncing playfully like a song as he brushed some of Cas’ crazy bed head off his forehead. “Cas, baby, it’s time to get up.”
Dean was by no means a weak guy.
Dean scowled and pushed it off.
“Of all the people to cheat on, you chose the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful man I have ever met. He’s an
Cas tilted his head. “Should we...knock?”
"C'mere, Cas.” Dean said, pointedly ignoring his brother. He chose blue paint, and drew a swirl on the angel's cheek. The color brought out his eyes, just like Dean involuntarily knew it would, and he was quick to get some gold to draw a circle on the length of Cas’ forehead. Dean took a step back, putting his index fingers and thumbs together in a rectangle to look at Cas. He
“Some person,” Cas sighed, and he looked at Dean with puppy dog eyes that rivaled Sam’s (which is pretty impressive).
Dean was taking shots like his life depended on it, trying to get to a socially unacceptable level of drunk so his date would actually be just
The stranger smiled, a genuine smile that caused his emerald eyes to sparkle, sending Castiel's stomach into a swoop. "I'm Dean." Dean stuck his hand out for Castiel, and Castiel shook it.
Cas smiled softly, the faintest red painting his cheeks. “I learned from the best.”
“Sure, it looks terrific!” Charlie said, covering for the angel who had apparently lost all ability to form coherent sentences. She glared at Dean. “Now skip this poor excuse for Christmas music before I shove the tree up your ass, Dean.”
“Dee?” The voice asked again, smaller this time, in shock or awe or relief, Dean couldn’t tell.
John had put him in this stupid situation, droning on and on about the family business or some shit while Dean stood at attention to avoid getting hit. (It didn’t usually work.)
Cas’ eyes widened. "I can't taste anything, Dean, I just eat the particles. Why am I here?"
“CPR,” Melissa added helpfully, and Dean smiled over at her, hoping to betray his gratitude. She seemed to get it, because her face lit up with a smile, her perfect pearly white teeth almost blinding Dean.
Dean rolled his eyes. “He really
The man was persistent, though, Dean would give him that. He got back up and started limping slowly, barely putting pressure on his left side. Dean sighed and got up, his mama bear instincts kicking in.
“Dean, these are my pet cats,” Castiel sighed, making a grand gesture at the two felines. “This is Echo - “ a point at the black cat, whose tail flicked “ - like the Greek myth. And this - “ he gestured to the orange cat, who had decided to make himself at home on Dean’s foot. “That’s Bob, like, erm,
"Hon, I'm lockin’ up for the night. Time to wake up your boyfriend and get a move on before the storm gets too bad." Mrs. Moseley smiled kindly at Castiel, then looked almost wistful as she glanced at the stranger and Castiel's fingers that were still running small canyons through the sleeping boy's soft hair. Mrs. Moseley winked at Castiel before turning back the way she came.
Perhaps both.
Dean’s head suddenly felt too small, like his brain was trying to pound its way out of his skull and he sucked in a desperate breath to make it stop. His mouth filled with water, and he hadn’t realized it before, but the water was fucking
If it got him this, Dean wouldn’t mind waking up to screaming seagulls for the rest of his life.
“Here are those cokes, gentleman. Are y’all ready to order?” The waitress appeared out of nowhere, and Cas and Dean both jumped.
Dean shook his head to clear his rapidly clouding brain and scrambled off of Cas. He was completely sure the barely-there whine he heard from the other man as Dean climbed off him was a figment of his imagination.
Castiel shrugged. “What makes you think someone will pay?”
Dean turned around to see the angel putting two fingers to his forehead, and Dean could feel a cold seeping into his veins. He suddenly felt a lot better, and realized Cas was looking pale.
,” he hissed, and Lisa seemed to remember herself because she blanched and her eyes darted up to sides of the building in front of them for cameras.
were the best Christmas movies to ever exist, Cas became the deciding vote.
He relaxed when he recognized the woman from the restaurant. She smiled at him, and gestured to the barstool next to her. “Nice to see you here, Dean.”
Dean sighed and motioned for Cas to get out of Baby. He opened the door for the angel and then followed him inside.
Dean sighed and sat next to her on the couch. He sunk into the cushions a bit and immediately stood back up. “I’m not lying, Lise. Just- you gotta keep it together, okay? You don’t know where cameras are, you can’t let them see.”
Dean watched him for a moment, contemplating, before he put one knee on the bed and swung the other to Castiel’s other side. Castiel choked in a breath, because Dean was
Cas reached across the backseat to pat Dean’s hand. Dean leaned into the touch a little bit before pulling his hand up to his chest and crossing his arms.
Nobody said good morning back.
Dean sighed. “Yeah, yeah. But why do we have to be the ones to be the bait? Why can’t it be Sam and Eileen?”
, he kissed Cas softly on the cheek.
Dean rushed back into the war room with a small box in his hands, and when he saw the tree, he stopped short. “Holy shit.” He gasped, almost losing his grip on the box.
Dean held Sam’s hand and watched Alastair and Luke talk, and then Alastair snatch the bag of money. Luke shoved Alastair, and they began to argue heatedly, and then Alastair was dropping the duffel bag and taking a swing at Luke’s head.
He let out a laugh in disbelief, sitting back on the bed with nothing but the handle of the mug in his hands.
please don’t hate me?
The waitress smiled at them both before hurrying off for their drinks.
Castiel was fairly sure that nobody would pay for his ransom, especially if it was a large number.
“You must be Castiel,” the woman smiled warmly, taking one of Cas’ hands in her own. She barely glanced at Dean before her gaze returned to the angel’s face. “And you, Dean.”
The stupid little piece of paper had five stupid little words on it:
like Dean…
“Thank you, Charlie.” With a
Dean looked up at the angel as he snorted the
Before Castiel could confirm, the door opened.
Updates coming soon!!
Dean looked pained, Cas looked extremely embarrassed, and Charlie looked thoroughly confused.
When Cas had gone wherever he goes when the rest of them are asleep, Charlie and Sam high fived.
Dean reluctantly hopped up and searched for his phone. When he found it (in between two couch cushions, which,
Sam said from behind the tree. Dean shivered, like he was absolutely
Castiel looked back at Dean nervously. “Cas, what the hell?!” Dean asked, running a hand through his hair.
Dean, he knew he did, he had seen enough peoples’ Heaven to know what love looked like, but
Cas hummed. “It is currently one a.m., you slept for about eight hours.”
Dean was immediately drawn to the floor to ceiling window that showed the city, glistening in the mid-morning sunlight like an assortment of precious gems.
Dean plopped his basket down on the counter. The skinny millennial behind the register looked at Dean with disinterest before yawning and looking at his phone.
“You know me so well,” Dean said, hopping up and beaming at Cas.
Dean’s jaw dropped at how perfect Cas looked sitting across from him in a diner, chewing on a fry and smirking at Dean in a way that made Dean think of the prelude to some very interesting activities taking place in a bedroom.
Naomi had left the keys in the ignition, as she was just running into the store for one cosmetic thing or another, and really, would it be all that bad if Castiel just hopped over into the driver’s seat and rode off into the metaphorical sunset like his own Prince Charming?
Dean scowled at her. He was through with her crap enthusiasm, especially when he was having himself a problem between his legs.
please enjoy this
“Where is he, Sam?”
Dean almost left the bar right then and there, all alone, and totally not sad at all that his date hadn’t worked out. But then a tall, dark haired woman approached the bar and Dean decided that
Dean." Dean would've laughed hysterically if it weren't for the situation, so the best he could manage was to pat Sam's shoulder mechanically.
"Goodnight, Dean." Cas whispered as he brushed some hair out of Dean's face. Dean smiled softly in his sleep and mumbled something along the lines of
A slightly muffled
“A person,” Dean repeated. “Not a...demon? Or an angel? Or another hunter?”
“Does this...“ Castiel hesitated, trying to figure out how to word what he was trying to say.
Cas nodded in agreement. “Have you seen any suspicious activity recently?”
Dean cracked an eye open to find a pair of blue ones watching him intently. The blue eyes looked away, embarrassed at being caught, but Dean kept looking. He had had no idea that blue had so many shades until he saw Castiel’s eyes.
It soon occurred to Dean that he said none of this out loud. He cursed for Sam to hear before pushing past his brother to look at the man slumped against the bar.
Cas smiled apologetically and straightened the cuff of his jacket. “Sorry, I wasn’t really sure what you would like to wear.”
“Where do we have to go and why?” Cas asked, ever the logical one.
"What kind should we start with?" Dean asked, looking through his phone.
Dean actually
Castiel was just floating through life at this point.
“C-Cas, that’s fine! God, you scared me, I thought we were under attack or something.” Dean laughed a little bit longer, and wiped a tear from his eye. “Alright, well, we’ll just keep driving until we find a motel to stay in for the night. Then we’ll figure out where we are tomorrow.”
apron stained from bacon grease and other things he’d rather not examine too closely.
“You okay in there?” Dean said from the other side of the door. Castiel made a sound of confirmation, but Dean must not have heard him, because the door handle wiggled. “Cas?”
Sam thanked the man and pulled to the right, onto a road surrounded by small pine trees. Charlie hummed happily along to some song she had stuck in her head while Dean and Cas avoided looking at each other.
“-so I was thinking we go back to my place, Dean, are you coming?” Grace was asking, and Dean blinked at her blankly before his brain (finally) caught up.
(See the end of the chapter for
The kid looked at Dean skeptically as he grabbed the money. “Get outta here before I call the cops on your tweaking ass.”
Especially over a building?
book, too, because if this date was going where he thought it would, Dean wouldn’t be back for a while.)
Castiel groaned, and Dean let go of his shoulders. His body
“Oh, Dean, it’s fantasmagorical! I got a new car, I got you all some gifts, and I came to spread some Christmas cheer!” Charlie announced, motioning to the stack of boxes and bags on the table. Dean chuckled again before looking around.
, do you understand?”
“Well, we’ve been working the case, obviously,” Dean said, ignoring Cas’ look of confusion.
Dean took a couple steps back, putting a safe,
Well,
“Hey there, mind if we talk?” Dean asked, and the woman whipped around. She was pretty, with black hair and dark blue eyes, contrasted by a blood red sundress.
“Time to dance, my dear.” Laurel whispered loudly in Cas’ ear, and Cas looked over to Dean for help.
Dean gritted his teeth, grabbed his ankle with both hands, and
Dean turned to Sam. “Cas and I are soulmates? I’m sorry, I can’t do that. What would Dad say? What would
Cas tilted his head. “It is a nice hotel, Dean, and Miami is a city where older people go to live out retirement.” Cas looked like he was about to drop some major angel knowledge (which, why would he need to even know about where retirees tended to flock? He was an angel of the Lord, for Pete’s sake) so Dean held up a disappointed hand to stop him.
Dean made it all the more enticing. The wrongness of it all, after Castiel had tried so hard for
” Sam whisper-yelled, pumping his fists in the air and nodding his head like he was dancing.
), Dean looked at Grace apologetically. “I think I’m gonna stay here with my wingman, he’s a little bit...down, I guess.”
Luke cocked his head. “How so, Dean-o?”
Cas' hair was ruffled wildly from his wiggling, framing his face that had only the slightest flush on his cheekbones. His bright blue eyes were almost totally engulfed in his pupils, but Dean was sure that was just them adjusting to the newly lit room. Cas sucked in a sharp breath and began to squirm underneath Dean.
“As for this little fucker,” Dean’s father snarled, and Castiel tensed up. “How much do ya think your parents’ll pay, huh? They want their sweet lil’ boy back, they’ll needta pay.”
Maybe this was Castiel’s chance to live a little, to have some excitement in his life while helping some people.
“Yes I know you’re tired, but Charlie specifically brought games for
Yep, that was definitely Cas, thrown across his midsection like a rag doll, his head resting on Dean’s chest. The angel’s eyes were wide open, and they were watching the wall across the room. He had a small smile on his face, and Dean felt reluctant to ruin his peace.
Just as he was about to let himself get worried about Cas, the angel returned. He fell over in his seat and smiled at Dean when he sat up.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean said quietly, sitting down next to Cas on the bed. Cas stiffened, but didn’t avert his gaze from the wall. “You doin’ okay?”
“Your dad couldn’t last long enough to help, hmm?” Alastair asked, barely even moving his head.
Cas straightened his tie, only managing to make it more crooked. “I’ll do my best to act human,” he said quietly.
Maybe all the training with John hadn’t been a waste.
Dean glared at Charlie for a minute, and Charlie glared right back.
Cas had super-angel hearing, and looked up at Dean with curiosity eating at the desolation written on his face. “I-uh. Yeah...no! I mean, yeah. I guess,” Dean tried to recover but gave up halfway through, shrinking back into the booth.
Dean sighed. “Thanks for your input, doc, but that ain’t exactly an option right now.”
“Alright, well you two go there as a couple and see what you can find out. It looks like they went to dinner here with their significant other, and then the next day went to that bar you guys went to today, then they died.” Sam said matter-of-factly, oblivious to his brother’s tomato-shade face.
The shy smile he got in return was one of his favorites so far.
He sneezed.
“Ca-Cas, can you do the ornaments now?” Sam breathed, gazing at the tree like he was looking at the love of his life (or some really good kale).
He paused, seemingly waiting for Dean to respond, but Dean didn’t. He was too busy processing what the hell was going on.
The realization hit mid-Snoopy dance.
Charis smiled widely in his direction for a moment longer before she seemed to remember that she had company. “Oh, gentlemen, that’s my cue! Thank you for coming, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave now,” she said, turning a distinct psycho-killer smile onto Dean and Cas.
Dean faked a smile. “I’m fine, Sammy. Send me the wife’s info and we’ll go talk to her tomorrow,” he said through gritted teeth as he waved at Cas.
He matched up with Cas?
It couldn’t be butterflies. Dean Winchester did not get butterflies.
Cas looked up at him, tilting his head to the side and squinting through watery eyes. “May you what, Dean?” he asked, his voice higher pitched than usual with emotion.
distance between himself and Cas. Cas let go of a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding, a long, steady exhale through his nose. Dean barked out a small laugh, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck.
“And this question is…?”
Nope, not worth it. He could sell it online for a lot more.
Castiel shook his head, wild black hair swishing this way and that. Dean sneezed, sniffled, and then focused back on him. “You’re not paying for anything, for one, and two, you’re not going anywhere until you get some sleep.”
ing in his chest. "I'd love that, Dean."
these all sounded like personality traits he was familiar with.
Dean laughed and put his head against Cas’ forehead. “That was easier than I thought it would be, honestly. But we seriously need to fix this spell.”
please enjoy! :) <3
It was no more than the ghost of lips on the light scruff of Cas’ jaw, but electricity flowed through Dean from where his mouth had touched the angel. Cas looked up at him slowly, pure astonishment written all over his face.
. “I forgot to introduce myself, didn’t I? I always do that,” he said, snapping his fingers. Then he held out a small hand, and Dean, Lisa, and Castiel eyed it warily. “Gabriel, your fantabulous stylist for tonight’s parade and the interviews the night before the Games.”
"Hello, Dean.” Cas said, his gravelly voice rumbling in the quiet.
by the thought of organizing, and reached up to steady the tree.
“I woke up and I-I found Sam. H-he was dead,” Cas said, which, okay, that wasn’t what Dean was expecting, but he would be pretty torn up about finding Sam’s abnormally large dead body, too. “Then I looked up, and you-“ Cas’ voice broke as his lip quivered.
Dean hesitantly stuck a hand out to the handle. If he locked it, Castiel may take it as disrespectful and try to break in while Dean was changing, which could result in Dean being naked for all the wrong reasons. If he didn’t lock it, then he was pretty much inviting Castiel to watch him dress, which Dean supposed was better than the alternative, but may still end up with sex and Dean’s ass in tatters for the arena.
Bright and early the next morning, Dean rolled off of his mattress and gently shook Sam awake. His little brother, who had just turned sixteen.
He hoped Dean liked lemon muffins as much as he did.
“I’m not going anywhere with you,” the (pretty) man said, jutting his chin out. Dean sighed, because he
It was too damn cute and perfect for Dean
“How old are you?” Sam asked, curiosity gleaming in his eyes.
Well, shit, he hadn’t meant it like
kidnap you, but you already know what I look like, so I can’t let you go. I’m gonna have to take you back to Dad,” Dean said quietly, thinking out loud, and if he hadn’t been driving, he would’ve either put his head on the wheel or hit the dashboard until his knuckles bled.
Cas froze, and let out a soft laugh as a group of people walked by. Then he pulled away from Dean and squinted at him. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
Although all the information Sam just gave him was
Not as well as Sammy, but the general idea was enough to make Dean give in.
Sam’s expression softened. “Cas, there’s no one he would rather be with than you. I’m sure he’s-“
His voice was so soft Dean could use it as a pillow.
. Sam smiled at the man.
Sam took a large bite, which, in retrospect, was not one of his Stanford-level ideas. He spit the muffin right back out.
Dean sighed and shook his head. He lifted his head to see Cas’ eyes wide and wild, a deep pink blush painting his cheeks and making the blue of his eyes pop. Dean shushed him once before leaning in and pressing his lips to Cas’, gently, tenderly, and
Instead, the next lyrics came from the backseat. “
Sam stopped laughing and looked at Charlie, baffled. "We don't have any lights, Charlie."
"Cas! No!"
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll find us a motel, since
“Shall we?” Dean asked, already throwing open the door to Baby.
“Mmh?” Castiel startled awake, instantly disentangling himself from Dean. “Oh god, Dean, I’m so sorry!” he exclaimed.
there is a TON of information in this chapter, keep an eye out ;)
Well, Dean may be not the most in tune with his emotions, but that was an utter fuckton of bullshit.
,” Sam said, and if it had been one of those old school phones, he would’ve slammed the phone back down on the receiver.
Dean sighed. “I’ll have a coke.”
Sam looked through the page one more time. “All it says is that the person cursed must kiss their soulmate to break the spell.” Sam looked pointedly at Castiel and Dean. “So you both must be cursed, we just have to figure out who you’re guys’ soulmates are.”
Maybe Castiel was going crazy.
Cas may or may not have laid a kiss on Dean's forehead before he walked out of the hunter's room and closed the door.
The man on the page looked vaguely familiar, and Dean had the distinct feeling of the man’s name being on the tip of his tongue.
face as Tisiphone put the bucket above his head.
The underwear wasn’t anything special, it was just regular boxer briefs, but they were soft and fit Dean perfectly. He was surprised that the front or back wasn’t missing, as he had seen Capitol omegas wearing on the television sometimes.
“Dean, what the hell?” Charlie asked, turning around and looking at Dean. “You just suddenly became a grinch again. I thought we made progress!”
and it took everything in Castiel's power to remember he was in a public setting and couldn't burst out in laughter that reverberated around the room. He bit down on his finger, chest heaving in a silent fit of giggles, and was
Dean smiled apologetically at the man. The man sniffed and Dean fought the urge to slug his mustache off his face.
It had been about a half an hour when Castiel started getting antsy, his knee bouncing up and down quickly as he tried to avoid working himself into an anxious frenzy.
Cas smiled, soft enough that it made Dean feel certain feelings, before sticking his bottom lip out in a pout, eyelashes still dusting the top of his cheekbones. “But I don’t want to,” he said, his voice dangerously close to a whine but not quite there.
"Dean, just bake the damn cookies." Charlie glared at Dean, then Cas, and the two immediately backed off.
He downed the rest of the room-temperature tea before hugging the mug to his chest and listening for any movement in the house.
Dean blinked and looked back at his bowl of Winchester Sludge. The name had changed since Mary had died; it used to be Winchester Surprise, back when Dean was a kid and Sam was a baby and the Games were a distant fear for both of them. Mary used to put a secret ingredient into the dish that made it special, and it tasted different to Dean each time he imagined what the secret ingredient was.
please don’t hate me?
“My apologies, I just wanted to make sure you were all right,” Cas said solemnly, and he sounded stone cold sober.
Sam looked back at Dean with a look he could only describe as
Updates soon!!
“Well, damn, Cas, I can’t control the weather!”
“You did good in there, Cas,” Dean said, and Cas turned that smile onto him. “Since when did you become such a great actor?”

Weirder things had happened, actually.
Dean glanced up at him, something flashing in his impossibly green eyes as he raised an eyebrow suspiciously.

Dean pulled up to the building, turned Baby’s engine off, and gawked. He’d been staying in motels most of his life, after all.
Dean glanced up at Castiel, who was beet red and looking away but motioning to the bed. He sucked in a ragged breath and walked forward, sitting down on the bed, waiting for whatever the alpha was going to say. Or do.
also THANK YOU GUYS for all the kudos and comments. every comment I get makes me smile, no matter how bad my day is. :))
Castiel stopped for a moment, contemplating.

Dean only realized the sun was setting when some large string lights above his head turned on, the rink soon flooded with a soft light. He looked up and sighed, thoroughly confused about what he was feeling right now.
He couldn’t help the dominoes that had fallen when Dean had blipped on his celestial radar, but finally having (and taking) the chance to be close to Dean, to be
“Heya, Charles.” Dean chuckled, wrapping his arms around the girl and planting an audible kiss on her fiery red hair. “How’s it goin’?”
Dean did as he was told, though. His omega school had taught him as much.
Dean blinked once, twice.
Dean wasn’t going to think about it. He couldn’t. He had to focus on things he could do something about.

“I love you, too.”

Alastair snickered. “It’s a ransom, idiot.”

Dean looked out the window at the rapidly setting sun, and suddenly got very antsy. He looked over at Cas, and was surprised to see the angel looking at him, his hands fiddling idly with a sugar packet.
A foot bumped against his under the table and he startled, looking up at Castiel before remembering that he wasn’t supposed to look an alpha in the eyes and dropping them to his empty plate. “You need to eat,” Castiel said, his voice oddly… kind? But with an undertone of that alpha authority that Dean couldn’t really disobey. Dean scooped a chicken breast that didn’t look to be too richly seasoned onto his plate, and was occupied with sawing it into little pieces to make it look like he’d consumed some of it when Ellen walked into the room.
knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep, but
Charlie smiled wide. "Sam said we could break into the eggnog when we get back to the Batcave!" Dean smiled and nodded, returning to his singing that rivalled his shower performances.
“The holding hands part or-“ Sam began, but Charlie interrupted.
Dean grunted in agreement with Charlie, Sam chuckled, and Cas just stood a little too close to Dean for comfort (though the hunter neglected to move), staring at the tree like it was the next messiah. The night had begun to settle in as the group got back on the road, black and deep blue bleeding into the setting sun. The four had mindlessly slipped into the same seating arrangement as before (with far less complaining from Dean).
smile, he felt something he hadn’t felt in a long time.
“Oookay, then. I’ll meet you guys outside.” Sam stretched out the “o”, then turned on his heel towards the door. Before he stepped out, though, he smirked over his shoulder and whispered what Dean thought was “I knew it!”
favor,” she announced, oddly somber. Maybe, Dean thought, she didn’t like sending omegas off to their deaths every year either.
Dean pointed to the steaming cup of coffee in Cas’ hands first. “That’s a good place to start,” he said, then continued to point at all the different foods with his half-eaten piece of bacon. “Eggs, sausage, toast, and orange juice are all good,” Dean explained. Then he sighed and looked at his piece of bacon in adoration. “Bacon is the food of the gods, so obviously you have to eat some. But if you don’t, then that means more for me!” Dean then narrowed his eyes at Cas. “If you don’t like bacon, I will kill you.”
Dean hummed a response, but Cas was already asleep.
Dean looked apprehensively at Cas before grumbling something.
"I love you, too, Cas. You gorgeous, fantastic, oblivious son of a bitch."
Dean made sure John was standing with the rest of the spectators, then made his way to the group of male omegas waiting, front and center, for the drawing.
The blush on Castiel’s cheeks deepened even more. “When he came in that one time? I asked for ID so I could get his name. Just in case.”
Logically, Dean knew that he should listen, that they should keep up the ruse of Castiel being his alpha and Dean being a good, obedient omega, but he didn’t want to. He was angry. Angry that he was there, angry that Lisa had been drawn, angry that this strange man had announced a claim on Dean and it had just been accepted, angry that he was going to spend the rest of his short life before he was sent in to die in servitude to Castiel, with his stupid blue eyes and tousled hair.
They pulled up to the restaurant, sand scratching under the tires as the sun began to dip low on the horizon. Dean shut Baby off but didn’t get out.
“I-uh-I’ll go get you some cocoa.” Cas said suddenly, and let go of Dean’s hands.
there’s a surprise in the meaning of one of the names of you look hard enough (or just ask google politely) :))
Dean sighed. He figured it was probably socially unacceptable to go around stabbing (maybe) demonic old ladies in broad daylight.
Whoops.
“Cas, man, sit down. Are you okay?” Dean put an arm around Cas and led him towards a chair. The angel leaned heavily onto Dean, before collapsing into the metal chair.
Dean exhaled loudly. "That's for sure." He said under his breath, moving to put his pan of cookies into the oven.
was he going to go looking for Dean.
When Sam had pitched him the idea about fake dating Dean, Cas had been reluctant to accept. Dating itself was still a puzzle to him, how to show affection without it being deemed ‘tooth-rotting’, as Charlie put it (what teeth had to do with dating, Cas will never know). He wanted to do the
When he was done, he walked back out into the main part of the room. Cas had turned off the overhead light, so the only light was coming from the lamps on the nightstands.
“Listen here, you little shi-
Dean clenched his jaw, but didn’t respond.
"Goodnight, Dean. Sleep well." Cas said, reaching for the remote to turn the volume on the TV down. He tensed when he felt a hand on his cheek, and he looked down at Dean.
“Shit!” Dean cried, and he jumped forward, nearly propelling Cas into the other set of still-closed automatic doors. “Who the hell needs two sets of lazy-people doors?”
Castiel awoke to the sudden jerking of the car, and he sat up abruptly, looking around with blurry vision.
Well, fuck. Dean hadn’t meant to do
Dean was suddenly feeling very exposed as he squinted at the camera, as if he stared hard enough he could see who was watching on the other side.
Cas looked up at him as Dean seemed to realize what he said. “But that doesn’t matter right now,” he said quickly, before squeezing Cas’ arm and pulling him back towards his chest. “Right now, you need to know that it wasn’t your fault. It’s an occupational hazard, and we just have to deal with it if we want to help people, which I know you do.”
But he was gonna do it anyways because goddamnit he was
Lisa’s brow furrowed. “Dean-” she started to say, but was cut off by the bathroom door sliding open. They both whirled around to see who was intruding, and Lisa made a soft, scared noise.
“That woman is very...feisty.” Cas said quietly as Dean took Laurel’s place.
“Dean, since you fucked this up like everything else in your miserable little life, I’m going to give you a chance to make somethin’ right,” Dean’s dad started, and Castiel watched as Dean stood up straighter and cowered away at the same time. “Call Alastair and get him to come here so we can go to the parking lot where the Impala and get it ‘fore people start gettin’ suspicious.”
Dean was starting to observe how happily the bees on his pants were flying around when Castiel set a plate of eggs and bacon in front of him.
Cas blushed. Dean just watched in confusion as the woman winked at him then turned around and hurried away.
As he rounded the corner back to his and Cas’ table, he saw that Cas wasn’t in his chair anymore.
Dean had to know. There’s absolutely
And rang.
Cas interrupted Dean’s mental tirade on his brother with a soft nudge underneath his jaw. Dean looked up at the angel sheepishly, ready to say something extremely platonic to counterbalance his accidental-on-purpose declaration of love, but just as he was forming words, Cas pressed his lips onto Dean’s.
Dean chuckled. “Am I not allowed to appreciate beauty?”
Dean felt the hairs on the back of his neck stick up with the implication, the idea of there being something
Dean glared at Sam. “Obviously I’m in a bad mood! My big-ass brother is giving me literally

Castiel shook his head. “Nothing, nothing. It’s just… much larger than I anticipated.”
Alastair put a hand to his chest, feigning offense. He pressed down on the gas harder, and the dark landscape outside the truck became a blur.
Not exactly a situation Dean wanted to see Lisa in, although he supposed Castiel would mean that that wouldn’t happen to him.
“I’ve been, Dean. It was mildly unpleasant.” Sam deadpanned, rolling his eyes. “Who’d you get a match with?”
, I can attempt to lower my ability to control this vessel so more basic human needs can take over.”
(or fake his, at least; maybe Cas was just getting good at this acting stuff) but his words had held a certain tone that made Dean think that he was mad at him. (Dean was supposed to be the one that was mad at Cas.)
Castiel took a deep breath and grabbed the mug by the handle before smashing it down on the ground.
MOVIE NIGHT!!!
Aphrodite hummed as she worked, some intricate song with the same basic melody as the bells to her bar. With a snap of her fingers, the rose petals in her basket were replaced by myrtle, which she laid on the bed around Dean with care.
“I don’t care, Sam, and you know what’s even better? I don’t care that I don’t care!” Dean snapped back. He looked at Cas with something that looked like-
“Dude, use your angel-ness to look at pictures of Christmas trees or something. ‘Cause Sammy and Charlie ditched us, and like hell am I gonna let them find a better tree.” Cas trained his ocean eyes on Dean, a faraway look passing over his face as he searched the vastness of his knowledge for Christmas trees.
“Now I’m going to tie you to the bedpost,” Dean continued explaining, looking in his closet for the rope he
“I’ll get it,” Sam sighed, and opened the door. Dean led the way inside, and he must have kept walking, because next thing he knew, he was standing outside his bedroom door.
Castiel studied Dean as he slowly typed something out on his phone. His face was already bruising a galaxy of blacks, blues, and purples, his lip was busted, and Castiel wouldn’t be surprised if he couldn’t see out of his left eye the next day.

Cas stopped unbuttoning his shirt with one button to go. Cas breathed a sigh of relief, before shuffling back to his seat, eyes on his feet.
Cas looked deeply disturbed. “I’m a few millennia older than her, so that’s a bit awkward.” His eyes widened as he realized what he said. “Not that I’m
“O-okay. But Sam-“ Cas was cut off when Sam hurried away towards the registers.
“Besides, you guys are grown men, you'll figure it out."
Dean threw him the bird over his shoulder, and he heard some music turn up as the truck squealed away, leaving skid marks on the light asphalt.
Plus, he still really needed to pee.
“We’ve never been before, what do you suggest?” Cas asked, and Dean looked out the window to keep from laughing.
He made a small
“Are you guys alright?” Cas asked as he walked towards the door of the car, his face scrunched up in concern.
as he realized someone was rubbing his back soothingly. He leaned into the touch and sighed again, this time in content. “Heya, Cas.”
thank you to every single one of you that left a comment, kudos, or subscribed :) you guys helped me through a lot of writer’s block and tough times and I appreciate it more than you know <3
“Dean,” Cas breathed, and he stopped right in front of Dean with a mix of awe, pride, and hurt on his face.
Cas took them with a soft smile. “Of course, Dean.”
He quickly got dressed in a regular black and white tuxedo, because apparently, this French place was so pompous that he needed to wear an actual

there so badly he could feel it eating him from the inside out.
“What’s yours, or should I just call you lost boy?”
“Put the kid in his room, and put the other one in yours, then get your ass back down here!” John demanded, the bottle disappearing behind the couch as he took a drink.
no seagulls were harmed in the making of this chapter
An hour later, the smell of something burning and the sound of slightly muted cussing floated down the hallway.
Dean saw right through his bullshit (since when did Sam actually
At that, Dean suddenly remembered that there was a certain blue eyed alpha in the bed with him, who was molded closely to Dean’s back and had one heavy arm slung possessively across his waist.
Probably liquor. Dean sure hoped not.
Dean hung up on him, turning to Cas. “So, we have some time to kill until Sam finds something, huh? What do you wanna do?” He asked after checking the time. He still had a few hours before his meeting with whoever the hell
Eew, drool? Since when did Dean
) room.
Dean snorted around a bite of burger. “Yeah, right.” Dean looked up at Cas. “Oh shit, you’re serious,” Cas nodded slowly. Dean cleared his throat and set down his burger (things were really getting serious). “Um, okay, what do you mean?”
“Cas? What’re you doin’ here?” Dean asked, sliding into the booth across from the angel. Their table was situated in the corner, away from the crowd, and Dean breathed a small sigh of relief for the reprieve from the mass of bodies.
Charlie blanched. "That's the one thing I didn't bring, dude! You guys are supposed to have lights!" She blew a strand of fiery hair out of her face, then smirked as an idea came to mind. "I guess we have to go into town to get some. Leave the boys to their
, he had to pee so bad it was starting to hurt. Plus, they had a meeting with the vic’s wife in-Dean skillfully maneuvered his arm without moving Cas to check his phone-
When he came out, Cas was humming quietly to the song playing. He looked up when he felt Dean near him, and Dean turned the volume up.
Dean was still chuckling when he realized Cas had turned and was looking at him seriously. Dean froze, and looked behind him for something out the window, because surely Cas was staring at something over his shoulder.
Just as Castiel was going to ask some important questions that could help him figure what the hell was going on, like
“Since when did you become the boss?”
The man wasn’t helping
Castiel sighed again before opening the passenger side door and getting out of the car, stretching his back, his dress slacks straining against every movement. He really hated having to wear a suit all the time when he was with his parents and he truly considered taking the jacket off and chucking it into oncoming traffic.
Harold side-eyed her like she was losing it, and Dean would be lying if he said he didn’t, too.
“Ah, yes, this way,” the man took off into the dimly lit restaurant, and Dean realized they were supposed to follow him. He grabbed Cas’ hand and dragged him into the dining area.
(See the end of the chapter for
He should be down there, walking through the garden, getting flowers for his own garden right outside the window so he could watch the bees buzzing as they went about their business. But instead, Naomi and Chuck were making Castiel stay inside, even on the most beautiful days, because of his ‘fragile psyche’.
“Love you, Sammy,” Dean whispered, hugging his brother close one last time.
it was something totally different. And not being able to show it in ways he wanted to when it was just them, just Dean and Cas, was a painful burden he would never wish upon another creature.
Dean smelled. A mix of motor oil, leather, and cloves filled Castiel’s nostrils, and Castiel clenched his jaw.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s nose twitched, and he blinked
“Definitely!” Dean and Charlie answered back at the same time, way too brightly to be definitely okay.
Cas could feel his skates slipping out from underneath him, and looked at Dean with fearful eyes before he fell gracelessly (too soon?), the world around him seeming to slow down. Dean reached out to catch him, but let go of his walker at the same time, and ended up falling right next to Cas. Cas winced as he hit the ice on his back, and looked over at Dean, who had grabbed his hand to try to keep them both upright.
theme song began, Dean instinctively stretched his arm over the back of the couch, his hand barely reaching the other side of Cas' head. Cas straightened his back as he felt the tips of Dean's fingers on the back of his neck, but then he settled back into the couch and popped some popcorn in his mouth.
Castiel’s face must have betrayed some of his pure, unbridled happiness and surprise, because Gabriel made a face and hightailed it out the door, closing it softly behind him.
Enjoy!

Cas looked around. “I-I’m not sure. This was supposed to be near your soulmate.”
was what scared him.
Then Dean noticed the abundance of omegas, and he could tell that they were omegas because they wore a collar around their neck. He had heard of omegas wearing collars in the Capitol, and it had been something he had had to learn about in his classes, but it was never something that had been strictly enforced in their district. The omegas that had been collared had always been treated the worst, reduced to little more than toys for their alphas to use and discard once they broke.
Charlie twirled a lock of hair around her finger as she typed a message back with one hand.
Dean contemplated for a moment. “If I was, would you talk to me?”
“He’s always up to something, Cas. I wouldn’t worry too much about however he’s acting,” Sam said, obviously distracted on the other end of the video call.
“You sure?” Dean said, and maybe he was prodding a little much, but how could he
Dean looked at him for a long moment, something Cas couldn’t quite place passing through his eyes before he toed off the slippers he had been wearing. Dean went around to the other side of Cas’ bed and folded the covers away from where they were tucked into the top corner. He climbed into the sheets, then unfolded the covers even more and patted the spot next to him, suddenly very interested in the loose thread on the cuff of his flannel.
“I thought I lost you,” Cas repeated quietly, and Dean saw some tears glistening on his eyelashes. “Once the spell was broken, I managed to get Tisiphone off of you and take the bucket off your head, then I smote Aphrodite. I tried to heal you with my grace, but-“ Cas made a strangled sobbing sound. “But I couldn’t, so I tried the next best thing.”
Dean growled quietly, low in his throat, the primal sound of an animal being denied it’s desires. Cas’ pupils dilated, and he whined softly.
“-I already got the love of my life a present.” Cas said to nobody in particular, raising the hand that held a box wrapped in white wrapping paper with a small green bow.

whispering “You’re part of the family now. I mean, I don’t know why I didn’t do it earlier, you were always part of the family, but now it’s-” Dean hesitated, looking for the right word. “-
“You were being a jerk,” Cas mouthed back with a grin, and Dean laughed, a beautiful laugh, one where he threw his head back and laughed with his whole body.
Cas blinked at Dean, reaching for the cup of coffee on the tray. “Anyways, you were sleeping, and angels don’t do that either, but I figured you’ve been under a lot of stress lately so maybe that was the reason? Well, either way, I guessed that you could probably use some sustenance,” Dean said, gesturing to the tray of an assortment of breakfast foods. He snagged a piece of bacon and started munching on it happily.
Dean sighed and ran a hand over his face. “Take your shirt off.”
“D-Dean Winchester,” he replied, voice barely more than a whisper, and Ellen took a deep breath before turning back to the microphone.
"I'm gonna murder Charlie." Dean mumbled. He didn't let go of Cas' hand as he pushed off the ice again towards the wall, bringing Cas along behind him.
“Get Eileen to help you,” Dean grumbled.
The lights turned an ocean blue, and Dean sucked in a breath. The change in color stood out on Cas’ hair, shimmering like he was underwater. His eyes popped beautifully for a moment, then the lights went out as the song ended.
Castiel leaned forward. “Elevator,” was all he said, and then the doors dinged and opened, revealing a long hallway with multiple doors all along it.
Cas had never made

Shit.
had to be the thing to slip. Not that he misses his mom, or that he wishes he and Castiel could be more-than-friends cuddling, or that he wishes he could do all the things Alastair has done to him, but he has too much conscience to be that evil.
Dean could hear the tight smile coming over Sam’s lips as he refrained from cussing Dean out further. “Hey, Cas. So I heard you guys had an exciting time.”
, Dean,” Castiel continued. “I did not want to send you off to the Games alone. My influence in the Capitol on your behalf will give you an edge in the arena. My intentions are pure, I assure you. I simply could not stand by and watch you die when I knew I could be able to help.”
“It’s what I do, sugar. If I talk, are you gonna bust me?” The woman asked, leading Dean down a walkway and into the garden.
Castiel almost asked, but instead he pursed his lips and nodded curtly, only daring to turn up the car radio when Naomi was out of hearing distance.
Dean’s face scrunched up in a
thinking his date had stood him up, all the while Dean was chatting up two different women and getting absolutely hammered.
(Who was she kidding, it was the God honest truth, but not in the context of what Cas was asking, so she was still proud of her quick thinking.)
The boy did so, with his head down. Dean caught a glance of his face, and he didn’t think he had ever seen a pair of eyes that were as blue as that boy’s.
Dean almost got hit in the face with the door, because he was
“Dean? Did I do something wrong?” Cas whispered, and he actually looked scared that he had messed something up, so Dean shook his head and grabbed Cas’ hand across the table. Cas flinched, and almost knocked over one of their empty plates, but then he relaxed.
honeymoon suite.
“You need some ice,” Castiel said, snapping Dean out of his thoughts and bringing his eyes back up to Castiel’s blue ones. “Your face is going to swell.”
She stayed in the position for a few seconds before Dean finally snapped his fingers. “A monkey!” He said, and when Charlie relaxed and nodded, Dean smiled back happily.
Castiel looked nervous. “Sam untied me. Said something about me being good for you or some shit. I won’t try to escape though, promise.”

"Cas!" Charlie squealed. She ran to hug the angel, throwing her hands around his neck and burying her head in his shoulder. Cas smiled softly and patted her back awkwardly before Charlie let go. "Merry Christmas!"
“Uh,” Dean said, because really, he was feeling capable of giving presidential-level speeches at the moment (not). Dean glanced at Cas, who was dutifully watching the TV stationed above the bar. In an absence of thought (or maybe just because it was
