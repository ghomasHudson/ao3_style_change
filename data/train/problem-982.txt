, that there are only two ways John - so ordinary and charmingly terrible at this - would've finished the question -
Sherlock makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat. "Hurry up," he frowns, and John laughs against his mouth, pausing to kiss him again, mouths open and soft, and Sherlock reaches his free hand up to cradle John's cheek.
And it's something in his tone, maybe; Sherlock jerks and gasps, "Mary!" eyes wild, searching John's. "She's - not ... dead?"
?" he asks, incredulously, catching sight of the photos properly for the first time, and Mycroft doesn't make any move to cover them.
Mycroft smiles, thinly. "Those recordings are accessed only in emergencies," he says, like John's being particularly simple, and John snorts. "You don't have my blessing," he adds.
Sherlock waves a lazy hand at him in reply, and something about the flourish of his wrist makes John smile again.
Sherlock, frowning in concentration, is lying stomach-down in the middle of the room, left leg stretched out behind him and his right leg folded under him somehow so that his right heel is poking out from under his stomach, just above his left hip and
"Shut up," he whispers, nose brushing Sherlock's cheek, and Sherlock turns his head into the kiss, slow and sweet and full of promise.
John's other hand grips his hip, firmly. "I think," he says, like he's pondering it, "I'd like to have you over your armchair," and Sherlock's breath catches - at the phrasing (a semantic preference for
. He can feel it building, low in his abdomen, in the base of his spine, his nerves prickling and he makes a choked noise as he starts to come.
"What Mycroft said at Buckingham Palace," John says, slowly, and Sherlock tilts his head, an invitation to continue. "Is that - true?"
Back in the plane, Sherlock has his face in his hands, trying to hide his pain. As much as he tried, he couldn't stop crying. Not this time. He can't shut it off. It hurts too much. This is what he feared the most. The tears roll down, as much as Sherlock tried to stop them. Stop all of this. He was slightly shaking, silently sobbing. Sherlock heard somebody walk, but he ignored it.
"Mycroft?" his voice is not strong enough, it's shaking and Sherlock is scared that Mycroft will notice. He's not stupid, he will.
"It's too early!" John said, a little bit panicking. It was way too early. Mary groaned again and gasped, her waters just broke. John's eyes widened and he looked at Mary scared.
even if Sherlock won't hear him. But does he want Sherlock hear what he has to say? John wasn't sure.
Mycroft sighed because there was only one sentence that could bring Sherlock back and he didn’t want to use. He hoped he wouldn’t need to. But nothing was helping, so there was no choice. He silently apologized and spoke:
A black car pulled up next to the gate of the graveyard. A tall figure exited the vehicle and slowly entered the field.  His posture said that he was from high intelligence. It was weird to see him without his umbrella, but he did it. He didn’t need it.
When the car stopped, they reached Mycroft’s house. Of course, they couldn’t go to Baker Street. This night was the most dangerous of all. Nobody could look after Sherlock tonight except for Mycroft.
"Sherlock..." he whispered. John might be losing him, but he didn't want to think like that. He can't and he won't. Not again. Sherlock opened his eyes to look at John. His chest clenched with pain seeing John like that. He slowly stretched his hand up to John's face and wiped away that one tear. John didn't even realize he was crying.
"Two years." John repeated his voice a little bit louder and breaking in the end. He was started to shake a little bit as he could feel tears in his eyes. Anger that John had, disappeared. He just wanted to know why. Why Sherlock didn't tell him. Why Sherlock didn't trust John enough to include him. John could slowly feel his heart breaking again but this time with different pain.
And he always felt something warm. On his hand. It was always there. Sometimes it would disappear and it would be cold all over again. He could feel himself slipping away. But then the warmth always came back, and he was holding on it.
The happiness continued, with a bit of emotional notes included for a bit sadder parts, but it was their life. Full of everything. Sadness, happiness, madness. Anything.
And that was when Sherlock noticed that everytime he touched John or other way round, he could see colors. Not clearly, but for sure it wasn't black and white anymore. And every time they became much more brighter. Sherlock touched John on purpose to see the colors. And he could see them better everytime. Sherlock was convinced that John was his soulmate.
"Sorry! I'm so, so sorry!" he says while the man tries to dry himself with a napkin. "Please, let me just go to the kitchen and, er, dry that off for you." With one smooth tug, Sherlock pulls off the man's bowtie and walks away, tying the bowtie around his own neck. Then he notices another man put his glasses on a menu he was just reading. Sherlock approaches him. "Finished with that, sir? Allow me to take it for you." The man didn't pay attention while he waved Sherlock away. Sherlock picks up the menu, the glasses and walks away, putting on the glasses as he goes. At a nearby table, a woman's small handbag is open beside her. Sherlock sees that there is an eyeliner pencil on the top. He steps closer and offers her the menu he is holding while taking the one she has. "Madam, can I suggest you look at this menu? It's, er, completely identical." The woman takes the menu as Sherlock quickly picks the eyeliner pencil, drawing moustache. When Sherlock looks back at John, there is already a woman sitting opposite John. Even from the distance, he could see that John was struggling with words and nervous. Sherlock quickly picks random bottle and walks to John's table, interrupting.
Molly was just about to leave her work, but the last minute she decided to stay for a little bit longer. The TV was on, showing news and weather while she made herself coffee and while it was making, decided to go to the bathroom. She just walked out of the room to hear only four words. Molly turned to look at the TV and her heart's beating quickened in fear, her face full of horror.
"John, there's something... I should say; I-I've meant to say always and then never have. Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again, I might as well say it now." He hesitates for a long time, then draws in a deep breath and raises his eyes to John's.
That's how Sherlock Holmes lived. Everyday waking up in question, if he will meet the one his mother told him about, or walk for another day in complete dullness. He tried not think about it that much, but he couldn't help it.
This other time John as always bought apples. He brought everything back to the flat and put apples into the the bowl they had. And they sat there for more than a week. John ate them, but he saw that Sherlock didn't even touch them. John was getting suspicious. Was this another experiment? It looked like it.
I would also like to thank a very special friend to me, Isi! Without you, these series won't be a thing. Thank you for encouraging me to write this and even make it into a fanfiction! :)
"John, what is it? What?" Mary asks John worried, seeing how bad John is reacting. Sherlock breathes in again, seeing that his chance to express his feeling was long gone. He speaks again, this time awkwardly:
"I will just go. I'm sorry to disturb you." John said and left the room as quickly as possible. Then John went to find Sherlock's doctor. When he did, he told the doctor that Sherlock was awake and he didn't miss the fact that Sherlock didn't remember more than three years of his life. While doctor was checking on Sherlock, he called Mycroft. The doctor didn't tell him anything; John figured it would be easier to tell him when he is in hospital. When Mycroft arrived, it was more like he deduced everything just from John's expression, but John still told him everything which left Mycroft speechless.
"I just don't want you getting hurt again." Mycroft silently whispered to the empty room. After Mycroft found out and saw how heartbroken his little brother was, he didn't want Sherlock to be so much hurt again. He was trying to keep Sherlock safe, but it seemed that he didn't want his help. Mycroft slowly turned and left.
His whole chest was heavy with everything. He could feel pain all over it, he couldn’t breathe properly. Sherlock was full of emotions. Rage, loneliness, anger, grief, regret, self-pity, hate, pain, strongest of them all being sadness and love. He couldn’t think about anything else than John. His imagination was working whole speed and images of John’s last moments ran through his head which made him shake violently.
"I don't know." Sherlock slowly said. He honestly didn't know. It's obvious Moriarty will want to end Sherlock for good, but other than that, nothing. He slowly turns away and climbs into the car. John wants to grab Sherlock's hand, to say something. He wants to come with him, to the flat, to 221B, but he is stopped. Mary is here. She is his wife and he now has responsibilities. If Sherlock will need John, he will call him, right?
"What about Mary?" John asked. During this time, in hospital, John lost respect for her. He didn't care about her anymore. She was nothing.
“You.” John responded his voice really low, sending chills through Sherlock’s whole body and he felt a big throb in his pants. John took slow steps and stopped right in front of Sherlock. He then leaned in really quickly and kissed Sherlock with passion.
Sherlock finally found the right floor. He saw John and his pace slowed down. He couldn't help but admire the doctor, even if he looked like a mess and pacing around. When John finally saw Sherlock, his shoulders lowered and he just felt more calm than seconds before. His whole appearance calmed John.
“Will be there soon.” Sherlock nodded and walked back to their room. He changed into something more comfortable and waited for John. Shortly, John came in. Neither of them said anything. John quickly changed into other clothes and laid into the bed. His head didn’t even reach the pillow when Sherlock snuggled closer to John, hugging him. John just let out a sigh, his hands quickly getting lost in Sherlock’s hair. The doctor leaned to kiss Sherlock on forehead and whispered silent ‘Goodnight’ then closed his eyes and fell into a peaceful sleep with his soulmate in his hands.
The feeling is brilliant and John never felt something so much more amazing than this. He’s such a mess, gripping sheets as hard as possible. Sherlock sinks deep again, John’s cock hitting his throat, which makes John arch up again.
"So he didn't tell you?" He laughed more and then looked at Sherlock again. This time, Sherlock was looking back at Moriarty. "What a shame, you will both die without saying things you always wanted to say." John's face dropped. He looked down, his hand lowering just a little. Sherlock closed his eyes and took slow breaths. The pain had eased, just a little and he could finally move more. Just a bit more. "You both amaze me. Even after all this time?!" Moriarty smirked. "Oh right, our beloved doctor got married. That got into the way." He said as if apologising.
It's been already a month. One month without Sherlock. It felt like ten years. By that time, John had realized a lot of things. Things he was scared of. Maybe that would scare others too. He wasn't sure. He didn't know what to do. John was lost.
John waits for Sherlock to wake up from a coma while Sherlock is lost in between coma and consciousness.
John was getting anxious and Sherlock was drifting into his mind palace again. He couldn't believe John called him, saying that John needs him. Maybe he said this because of what was happening. He found so many excuses as to why John called. Thought he didn't knew the real reason.
“The truth.” Sherlock responded. John stayed still then put his book away not meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
"And then what?" Sherlock meets his gaze for a moment, then looks down thoughtfully before raising his head and gazing off into the distance. He simply shrugs.
"Interesting thing, a tuxedo. Lends distinction to friends, and anonymity to waiters." Sherlock drops his French accent and carefully watches John. John looks down, his eyes brewing up with tears when he stands. Sherlock instantly knew that he did a wrong thing of pulling an act of a waitress. Mary tries to grab John's attention, but there is no use. Sherlock slowly lifted his hand, expecting John to take it, but John is looking at the table, breathing heavily. John then looks up at Sherlock and briefly lock his eyes with him.
"When Mary shot you... W-When I thought I will lose you, again. Sherlock-" John turned back to look at the detective, his eyes full of tears and he was shaking just a little bit. "Sherlock, I heard your heart stop. I saw when it happened. I thought that this time, this time I will actually lose you." John took a sharp breath.
Maybe everything will finally be over. Maybe his life will finally be over. Maybe he won't have to let everybody around him down. Maybe his heart won't burn with the pain anymore.
"Well, short version..." he hesitates while John looks up at him. "Not Dead." A lot of emotions cross John's face. Happiness, anger, pain, shock, betrayal, relief, disbelief, and love, but sadly, Sherlock didn't notice the last one. Sherlock's face drops as guilt flashes on his face. He doesn't know what he should say or do. John took a shaky breath. "John, I'm-"
They both got comfortable with each other really quickly. And everybody were really confused, since John had trust issues and Sherlock wasn't really social. But it just sort of happened.
Suddenly John sat up. His heart dropped. What if Sherlock saw colors, so bright, just like he did when he took Sherlock's pulse? And by asking what he was supposed to see, he gave the impression of not seeing them. What if this why Sherlock is distant and careful with him.
There he was. Lying on the bed and not moving. The only thing ensuring that Sherlock was alive was the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor.
The man slowly made his way towards Sherlock who was leaning into the gravestone. His own heart felt pain seeing his little brother so broken. He stopped when he was right next to Sherlock. Mycroft slowly walked to his brother and put a hand on his shoulder. Sherlock didn’t even react. He didn’t say anything, he didn’t look up at his brother. He completely ignored everything. Mycroft crouched down and slowly ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair in a comforting manner. He used to do it when Sherlock was just a little boy to comfort and calm him down or make him go to sleep faster which always helped.
"Yes, I know. Let's go." Greg helped John to stand up and they both slowly walked out of the building towards his car. This was going to be a long night.
Sherlock was happy he was holding John in his arms, but sad that under these circumanstanses. He hated himself for enjoying his hug, but the detective couldn't help himself. Sherlock loved John and holding him was the only thing he could do. Sherlock admired how John cared for Mary even if she lied to him multiple times. He was just like that. He was good.
" The imagine changed and they could see bloody Sherlock lying on the ground, his hands sealed with chains and he was unconscious. John's eyes widened and his heart started to beat faster. "
“Ah! ” John screamed, powerful orgasm washing over him, his seed spilling on Sherlock’s hand and John’s stomach. The view made Sherlock come, he reached his climax, groaning John’s name. He rode his orgasm out, slowly stroking John for him to ride out his own.
Sherlock sits down and closes the door. The car starts driving. Mycroft looks at his little brother and even if Sherlock is good at hiding his feelings, he knows that his brother was hurt, he can see it. That was what Mycroft feared the first time he met Dr. Watson.
Sherlock felt the familiar feeling of shoulder rest against his shoulder. He slowly placed chin on the chin rest. Carefully, he picked up the bow with his right hand. He could feel his hand shake a bit, but Sherlock ignored it and slowly raised his hand with the bow in it. The bow touched the first string and he played the first note. Sherlock made a little pause and started again. This time he played two notes and stopped again. When he started again, he added one more note. After this pause, his song finally started. It was slow, it was telling a story. It felt like a start, an intro to something. And it was. Because after that followed more happier notes. The song became just a little bit quicker with every note. Indeed, it was much happier than before it started. Sherlock knew exactly what this part meant.
Just then, Sherlock walked out of their bedroom. He was wearing his shirt with its sleeves rolled up a bit and simple trousers, barefoot. His hair was still damp after the shower. Sherlock looked more gorgeous than ever. The view made John’s desire grow as he watched Sherlock walk up to the table and take the cup that was ready for him. Few fantasies ran through John’s mind and his arousal just grew bigger. John took a sharp breath as Sherlock was about to walk away from the table.
"Promise me." Sherlock whispered now. He was scared. He thought all of this was not real, maybe it was his mind palace. Maybe he was still in hospital, or maybe even in coma. Maybe none of this was real. Maybe he's still in plane, on his exile and his mind just wandered further than he believed was possible.
“Won’t you eat?” John asked him, basically choked out his question. He coughed quickly and continued on eating his breakfast.
"What is this?" Sherlock asked, his voice ringing through the flat. John take one piece of the pie and giving it to Sherlock and said:
Sherlock took one step and then stopped. This happened always. It was getting harder for him to breathe. He could feel his hand shake even more. He got a bit worried, because how will he play the violin if his hand was shaking so much? He cursed at himself and took one step forward, but stopped again. The aching pain in his chest got bigger. Sherlock was sure that it wasn’t there before, but here it is again. Always back when he entered this place. But he couldn’t stop now. He was here, he had only one thing to do and then he could go. Sherlock took a big breath and slowly started walking down the path. The familiar grey gravel path. The one that brought even more sorrow. The one that crunched under his feet. The path that was wet because of the rain.
"Sir, may I help you?" Maître d' approached him. Sherlock took a little glance at him and instantly knew that the man was an expectant father. The man's phone beeped.
"Twins?" John asked looking at Sherlock for answer, but he couldn't see his face, since the detective was facing the ground.
Now John was left all alone. He didn't know what to do. He felt betrayed, heartbroken. Mostly, he hated himself for not admitting what he felt to Sherlock and blamed himself for the jump. John tried to move on, he really did. But one year passed and nothing happened. John just couldn't do it.
"You're not seriously going alone there." Greg asked John, as he was sitting in his chair, still shocked after what he just saw. His chest ached while seeing Sherlock in this condition. Even if he couldn't see colors, he already knew what that dark thing all over Sherlock's face and clothes could be.
“I love you.” whispered John, as he stroked Sherlock’s hair. He left a gentle kiss on the detective’s forehead, thanking him silently. Then he laid closer to Sherlock, the detective, even asleep, snuggling closer to John and hugging him. John closed his eyes and smiled.
Sherlock reached fourth part. His face dropped a bit. He lost his smile again, he got more serious. This part included Sherlock’s feelings and his questions.
This time, he will only come back in the morning. John has nothing to worry about. Mycroft is there, Sherlock is safe. It's his brother after all.
"It's just for some time. He will be gone soon." Sherlock answered not looking at Mycroft. He started to irritate the detective. "If this flat was the only place he could stay, so be it." He stood up and walked pretty close to Mycroft and pretty pissed. "I'm not going to take it away from him." Sherlock walked back into his room, leaving Mycroft.
“You’re wearing too many clothes.” He said his voice low again. Sherlock took a slow breath, waiting for John’s next move. John’s hand slowly travelled down Sherlock’s chest, until he took a hold of his jacket which he took off, Sherlock eventually having to let John go. He looked up at Sherlock, whose eyes were shining, waiting, silent plea visible in his eyes that were full of lust, want, and love. John didn’t do anything else, searching Sherlock’s face for any sign of uncertainty. “Only if you’re sure.” he whispered and stroked Sherlock’s cheek. The detective leaned into the touch, his eyes never leaving John.
"What, no snipers?" John asked sarcastically. Moriarty grinned even more. Sherlock was silently deducing Moriarty. He knew that something was up. Something was not right. Moriarty was up to something. He didn't have any snipers, as if he was sure John won't shoot him. But was he really?
John cursed at himself for thinking about all of this, while he was making dinner. Mary had a bigger stomach now and it was harder for her to move so John sometimes did things for her. This time, he made dinner for both of them.
"I have several news." The doctor started and looked both at Greg and John. John was trying to control his breathing. He knew that something was wrong. Something went not as planned. He knew it. He saw it in the doctor and he felt it.
"Oh god." he whispered, but his thoughts were cut when he got a phone call. He quickly fished his phone out of his pocket and answered without looking at the caller's ID. "Hello?"
John groaned and leaned back, breaking the kiss. He looked Sherlock in the eyes, not seeing their colour right now. John slowly took Sherlock’s face in his hands and the room around them changed, everything appearing in colour. John smiled and leaned in slowly, gently kissing Sherlock, with as much passion. They both closed their eyes, feeling heat radiating from each other, completely lost in the moment.
"Well hello there, doctor Watson." Moriarty walked out of shadows. John quickly took his gun out to point at Moriarty, who only smiled at his movement. All of this reminded of the first time they all met, just some things had changed.
John suddenly stood up and went to search for his gun. Mycroft instantly knew what John had decided. As much as he despised the doctor, he knew himself it was the only chance in saving Sherlock, but he
"And what are you going to do with us?" Sherlock slowly asked, his voice was hoarse and breaking in the end. He couldn't show his weakness, but it feels that Moriarty already knew it. That's why Sherlock is here beaten up. That's why Moriarty asked John to come. Sherlock is bait, for John. And both of them are going to get hurt.
John would have laughed if he could. He was in love with the most ridiculous man. And he was happy. But for how long? And he realized just
The doctor took a long shower, made himself dinner. Visited Mrs. Hudson, had tea with her and a little chat, although it was hard to talk with her, since half of the time she was worrying about Sherlock and crying. It wasn't helping John either.
Sherlock opened his eyes. The words just didn't stop ringing in his head. His head shot up. He could sense that somebody was here. He moved a little but the pain stopped him. The detective slowly laid his head, controlling his breathing. He could hear steps, like someone was running around and searching for something. Sherlock's mind worked too quickly and his head shoot up to see the only person that could be standing in the doorway.
"Sherlock?" Mycroft was here too. Mycroft visited Sherlock more often now. He was scared for his little brother, so he always checked on him. It seemed that he didn't got any better. Not getting worse, but not getting better either. Always staring into  space and half of the time never really here. Mycroft sighed. "Sherlock." Mycroft waited for Sherlock, while he finally looked up.
John lost it. He couldn't believe that it all had to end like this. All he wanted was all those endless cases with Sherlock. The adrenaline. He wanted it. He didn't really want to die because of Sherlock. And he certainly did not want Sherlock to apologise for whatever he was even apologising. But the look on Sherlock's eyes. John knew it was all over. Their stories were over.
"If he wakes up..." John stopped and looked at Mycroft and saw him looking at him. I hope you will be there. "...give me a call." John only gave a small nod and went back to Sherlock.
"What is it, John?" She was waiting for the doctors to tell her what happened, but instead, John showed up. "Please, tell me if the baby is ok." She silently pleaded him. His face was sad and Mary knew what he will say.
"Do you see it too?" Sherlock whispers to John. John slowly looks around. Then his eyes find Sherlock's again and he silently says:
"I can't lose you. Sherlock, do you hear me? Don't leave me. Don't you dare. Not anymore. I-I need you." He let out a shaky breath. "Come back to me. P-Please. Don't leave me alone. Just come back." John kept his eyes closed, his head down. He was holding onto Sherlock's hand as if it was his life. Then John inhaled deeply. "I-I love you, Sherlock." John managed to say in whisper.
He could breath in. He felt everything. He was back. Everything was back. He could feel the pain but it didn't matter.
Suddenly, Sherlock's breathing become heavier. Every breath was more painful. The pain went through his body stronger than before. He looked down to see blood pouring out of the wound. Sherlock's knees became weak and he felt darkness surround him. This time Mind Palace couldn't help anymore. Sherlock fell down losing his consciousness the second he reached the floor.
Sherlock felt so relieved when he saw John kneel in front of him and hug him. Sherlock whispered his name. And then three more words came out of his mouth.
Mycroft was here too. He came to visit at least once a week, sometimes visiting two days in a row. The image of Sherlock all beaten up and in coma was unbearable. One time, Mycroft walked out to sit in the waiting room. Sentiments never got better of him, but this time knowing that his little brother might never wake up... Well, it broke him into pieces. He kept cool and collected, but he was breaking apart, even if nobody saw it. But Sherlock would have been able to see it.
"So what do you need here, Mary?" She sighed. Sherlock slowly leaned in to have a better look of her face. It was full of lies.
John let go of Sherlock's hand and just sat there, looking at the detective. Everything around him was silent; the only sound was the heart monitor. John slowly looked up at the heart monitor and saw no change in it. The same pulse, rhythmic heart beat. Nothing new. And like this for a whole month.
Sherlock slowly leaned towards John. The doctor saw Sherlock getting closer and he leaned himself until their lips finally met. They both closed their eyes. Sherlock could feel John's soft lips against his and he melted into the kiss. John didn't wait and he answered Sherlock instinctively. John pulled Sherlock closer to him, feeling his body with his own. The kiss was slow and gentle. John tilted his head a bit to the right, giving Sherlock more access.
. I-I always did. It never changed. I wish you could know how much you changed my life. I felt as if seeing colours." He let out a small laugh. "That time when I checked your pulse after you jumped... I saw colours. I did. Even if just for a second, but I did. Now I know." John smiled and looked back at Sherlock. "They were so bright. But now I know. I know for sure." John closed his eyes and looked down.
The song was getting quicker every second, more emotional notes echoing through the whole graveyard. It was getting intense, Sherlock’s hands were moving faster, he could even feel his body move in sync with the song.
Sherlock wished there to be a switch so he could turn off his emotions and get to his life before all of this. But, of course, it’s impossible. He can’t turn off his emotions like Mycroft could. He’s not good enough. He’s stupid, Mycroft always told him that. He was just a little boy and he is one now. A lost boy, who wishes for love. Love that is not accessible to him anymore. Was, but not anymore.
John swallows. He told her about the drugs so this is not what she is getting at. But what else could it be?
From his window he can see the undulating landscape, the incredible, larger-than-life hues of colour - sprawling fields of blooming lavender (
John has chosen Mary, they are going to be a family soon. Therefore Sherlock must find something to exonerate Mary, to make her enormous, boundless, massive, tremendous betrayal palatable to John.
And then he knows it is over. He made a mistake, again, meeting his deepest fears alone, without someone at his side. He should not have started this experiment on his own, should have talked it through with John but no –
For a moment he allows himself to think that he might say it now, before it is too late, before he will never be able to say it. And stops. He stops before the words leave his mouth and goes for a joke. Tries to leave John with a laugh on his face.
Suddenly Lestrade remembered that day one and a half years ago when he had left in a hurry the run-up to one of his biggest professional scoops, and had moved heaven and hell to get the joint police forces including a helicopter to Baker Street only to find Sherlock desperately worrying over his best man speech.
It comes as a surprise. Not that she is clad all in black, holding a silenced gun – Walther PPK, his mind palace willingly provides – small smile playing around her lips. Not that she shoots him. Not that she apologises for doing so although she is not sorry. Not really.
When he comes back into the room, he realises what it is. The smell, a hint of her perfume. Claire de la Lune.
‘Most of them are by local artists. Provence is still a Mecca for artists, there must be something in the air and the light that draws them here.’ She walks over to the left wall by the window. ‘My personal van Gogh corner. He is so ubiquitous by now. This is the problem with things you see to often - you stop appreciating their beauty.’ She points to the painting of the nighty sky. ‘Did you know it was painted here?’
I am sweating and trembling and then I start to laugh almost hysterically. ”I was just thinking of something I once said to Mycroft. About your moustache. I said that I couldn‘t be seen wandering around with an old man. And now look at me …“
I try to shake off these thoughts and think about Magnussen instead. Nothing has been solved. My improvised stunt in the flat with Mary patiently waiting beside the fireplace, watching my performance like a discerning critic, only bought us time.
“John! What the hell are you staring at! Run!“ And then he was dragged away, through a door, along a hallway full of flickering shadows, their feet sounding hollowly on the marble tiles, over a balcony to the neighbouring roof, “Jump, John, your legs are long enough!“, down another flight of stares. No torches here, the house seemed cold and empty.
She gets up and looks over her shoulder. ‘Think about it. There is no immediate danger but I would really, really like him to wake up.’
He knows what she is talking about: telling patients and their loved ones that there is no hope left.  ’I have seen friends in such situations, close friends as well, and believe me, I can tell the difference. I do not wish to lessen the meaning of friendship but if someone is truly in love with a patient,  I can see it. Always.’
He stretches his legs towards the fireplace, lights his pipe – no smoking prohibitions here, tobacco not being a forbidden substance then – and starts puffing little clouds towards the smoke-darkened ceiling. Better than any nicotine patch. And there is morphine and cocaine, he thinks dreamily, available from any good chemist, not something to be acquired illegally in filth-ridden alleys or behind rusty warehouse containers.
He flinches from the soft female voice that suddenly sounds very close to him. ‘Starry Night, oil on canvas, 1889. I am sure you know it.’ She speaks good English with a French accent.
Sherlock ran into his bedroom and pulled the suitcase from behind the wardrobe. He opened the doors and started throwing in things.
So, hospital. ICU. The warm electric smell of medical equipment and a trace of Eternity by Calvin Klein. Female nurse or doctor. Three, no, four bags on the I.V. pole. No pain. So morphine via PCA again.
Sherlock is trying not to hear the moans, the groans, Mary swearing, John talking to her in his best bedside manner, hiding his own nervousness because his daughter is going to be born in a fucking car in a fucking London tunnel, of all things.
John’s grateful laugh, full of relief, was the best thing that had happened so far in this city which he still could not find romantic.
“Yes, do keep up, John. Our plane is leaving in two hours time so you should start packing.“ He clapped his hands in a gesture of encouragement. “It just popped up out of the blue. The man we are looking for is an author of travel books and is suspected of having married six women in different countries, using them as a source for first-hand insider’s tips and then cheating them out of their money before disappearing from the face of the Earth. He is English and based in Birmingham. Fluent in six languages, elementary knowledge in further nine. This is what we know.“
Yes, this is brilliant, well done, of course it hurts like hell, but as long as he gets the work done, it is fine. All is fine. Never better.
They enter Sherlock’s room. His heart rate is back to normal, the breathing even, his fever not alarmingly high.
There is a black hole in my mind that sucked up everything from the paramedics arriving in Baker Street to me waking up two days after surgery. And when I finally wake up I am alone.
At first there is just light. Nothing hard or glaring, more like the sun shining through mist, soft, subdued, muted.
She smiled wistfully. “John, you remember the Christmas party when Sherlock got so angry because you wanted to visit your sister instead of spending the holidays with him and he deduced my present and said all those bad things? And only then he grasped that the present was for him and he apologised with a kiss? I guess this is exactly the same thing. Just without the kiss.“
How could two people love each other so much (well, John did, and by now he thought Sherlock might feel something akin to love for him as well) and yet so fundamentally misunderstand each other? Constantly? About the things that mattered most?
“To think that I nearly gave him the address of Luigi Betti’s secret dining place. Best food in Venice, four tables in a private apartment where Casanova once lived. Mr Holmes, Dr Watson, you saved both my money and my reputation. How can I express my gratitude?"
John gets up and walks to the door. His hand is already touching the doorknob when something makes him stop abruptly in his tracks.
John silently ate his beans on toast, mopped up the tomato sauce with the rest of the bread, drank his tea, and put the dishes into the sink. He felt Sherlock’s inquiring look on his back but refused to turn around. If necessary, he could be as stubborn as Sherlock.
, drinks two cups of coffee. He looks at the old calendar on the wall. 1989, the year Grandmère died. Nobody has taken it down, freezing time within the house forever. But it does not feel odd or uncomfortable to stay in a house in which it will be always 1989. He does not mind these things.
‘He was killed in his office. I found both of you. Him, I could not save. Shot to the head. But you … well, the killer had second thoughts,’ he swallows, ‘and yet, you almost died, Sherlock, it was touch and go. I think they had given up on you.’
I swallow, feeling very silly all of a sudden. ”Sometimes I wish I was making no progress at all. That I could remain like that, an old man who needs help, who needs someone around him all the time.“
John threw the cap back into the wardrobe, stuffed a pair of trainers into the suitcase, raising his hand to Sherlock. “Not another word, I will take them, full stop.“
John has learned his lines perfectly. I have set up Billy Wiggins to create his own recipe for the punch in order to put everyone to sleep. Appledore is not far. Magnussen will send his helicopter as announced in a message I received shortly after that surreal meeting in the Italian restaurant around the corner of the hospital.
So much blood. Femoral artery, hopefully just a nick, not a clear cut, in case of clear cut loss of consciousness between 30 seconds and 5 minutes max, if not restricted death after 3 minutes in case of adult male.
‘I was so angry when you waltzed into that restaurant, playing a French waiter, for God’s sake, after having put me through hell for two years. I was as good as dead myself, worse than after Afghanistan, worse than before I met you because I had met you and I knew what my life could be like and that it was over and would never come back.
Sherlock stands there and keeps looking out over the little town and the white cliffs peeping through grass scorched yellow and trees desperately clinging to their leaves.
They continued to drink coffee, and Sherlock amused John with stories about famous murders committed in the city, and John answered with some interesting anecdotes about Casanova and his time in the infamous piombi in the Doge’s Palace.
“Exactly.“ Sherlock turned towards him, a strange look in his eyes. “I delete things I do not need.“
He remembers childhood summers with Grandmère Vernet who was the best cook he ever met and the worst painter he ever saw. But her passion made up for any lack of skill.
‘Indeed. A silenced gun like the one I heard at Magnussen’s. Unloaded of course. But I am sure it was a bullet from that very gun that got stuck in your brother’s chest.’ The anger makes it almost impossible for John to continue. ‘And that got me thinking. I know, compared to you and Sherlock I am just a brainless idiot, but still. Think of an empty shell of a man, tormented by grief and guilt, drowning his misery in a bottle most evenings. He desperately tries to cling to his work if nothing else. And one day, just like that, a funny, cute nurse shows up, new part-time assistant, cheery, positive, sassy, with a kind word or a smile for even the most tedious patients. Just what the sad little doctor needs, right?’
Mycroft Holmes has naturally pale skin like most redheads have but now he looks positively ashen. ‘A gun?’
I stop myself when I feel shame creeping over me, grab my violin instead and play something atonal enough to make Mrs Hudson bang her ceiling with a broomstick.
Yes, the downside. The downside is that he is alone, locked up with his brain and his feelings and memory of a man falling backwards – not him, not this time, bullet to brain, not the chest, dead as a doornail.
Sherlock vehemently shook his head, sending his curls flying. “Not me, G … Greg, not me. This is about John. It’s him I’m worried about.“
Although this is a dreaded scenario, in the end it proves to be fun. John once called him 'a drama queen' and, while Sherlock was slightly insulted in that moment, he must admit that his friend was not that far off the mark.
“Yes. He forces me to watch them with him and this morning I got a bit fed up with it. Four evenings in a row, this is getting slightly obsessive. I was a bit not nice about it and then I suddenly realised he did the same with Mary.“
I look up in alarm because by now I know every inflection of John‘s voice and I know when something big is going to happen. This is one of those times.
John sits down beside the bed again. He puts his tea mug on the nightstand and takes a deep breath. Then he covers Sherlock’s right hand, which is still too warm but not in an alarming way, with his own. This is something he has never done before, and it seems strangely intimate, and yet so very right.
But what if he really wants to go back to her? What if this ‘ thing‘ between us is just the result of my needing his help, of John being relieved at my near-but-not-death?
‘Sherlock, I need you to wake up. Please. I know you suffered a terrible shock and you are in pain but please, for me.’
The first time, it meant going away for two years, coming back and realising he would not be getting his old life back. The landscape had shifted, people were not what they had been before. Maybe he should have stayed away for good.
He turns around and walks to the window, leaning lightly against the cool glass. ‘Shouldn’t we discuss this outside? He might be able to hear us.’
‘Of course you are, John. I get the feeling that there are unspoken things between you and Sherlock and that it might be helpful if you talked to him.’
The thought somehow brings back his earlier sadness. Sherlock tries to distract himself by entering a bakery, buying a small
This knowledge combined with the eerie silence in the room made him run to the stairs, bursting into the room – a bedroom? – and finding a cruel variation on the worst moment of his life.
There is something in the back of this throat that does not want to go away. There is dust in his eye although no wind is stirring.
I have other things on my mind while I am pacing the hallway, the linoleum squeaking under the soles of my shoes. I have not slept for at least two days because the moment I close my eyes the film starts again.
I once told Lestrade that writing the best man speech was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I had no idea.
He abruptly stops the car, sends it slithering against the kerb, John jumping out and squeezing himself in the back with Mary.
John shrugs. ‘He never told me. Chasing thugs, I would say. Solving cases in exotic places. Things like that.’
Where did this come from? He is not a religious man but his parents took him to church and at school they used to read the Bible; and sometimes Scripture is surprisingly to the point.
"John, I'm not going to tell him anything. And as a matter of fact, no, it's not. It's not a crime scene. Not the way you mean. This is a murder-suicide. This man killed his wife, then killed himself, and that's what the coroner's going to find and that's how the case will be recorded."
John let go of the soft pink nipple with a 'pop' sound and move to the other one, which he sucked on with the same look of concentration, as if he was doing the most important thing in his life.
The man was put in a chair in the tiny room, he was aimlessly staring at the wall, looking almost catatonic.
"Yeah well, if you had performed the operation yesterday like you were supposed to, I'd be sucking carrots through a straw in my arm, wouldn't I?"
The next day, John waited patiently for Sherlock's appointment. He had searched the place one more time and made sure the keys were not actually there.
"Lestrade, why haven't you been calling me? Is London clear of criminals all of a sudden, or have you by some miracle become competent at your work?"
"Now where and why would a suburban husband get a gun like that?" He whispered more to himself than to anyone around. He was so deep in thought that he flinched slightly when his phone started ringing "Here we go" he said wearily and stood up straight to answer.
"John… I think I love you." Sherlock whispered into John's hair, because it was that moment that he pieced it together and figured it out, he loved him… Shit.
At that, the attacker seemed to grow reluctant. He clearly hadn't expected an audience. And with one quick move and a sweep of his dreadful cape, he turned and disappeared in the bushes to his right.
Sherlock knew Mycroft could not take it. His love for John was an eternal imprint that would never be wiped away, so he wandered the streets, watching the aimless succession of night and day across the heavens, until one night, he heard it.
At that precise moment, thunder struck loudly outside, and all the lights went off, drowning the place in complete darkness.
"It's not a good time, doc." He said with a huff of annoyance, as if John was the cherry on the top of his shitty day.
Still, he can't find his pants anywhere. He squints in the faint dawn light and takes another look at the bed, and bloody hell. He can see part of his black pair of pants peeking from under the muscled naked torso of his neighbor, trapped and impossible to retrieve without waking the person trapping it.
"I can't John, I'm still in prison uniform, and the only person who knows I'm undercover is my obnoxious brother."
"Ready to beg already?" he smiles, his hand stroking Sherlock's stomach, right below his navel and above the beginning of his pubic hair. His whole body feels like it's combusting, but he cannot… will not succumb to John's evil scheme.
A cloud of dust and death engulfed everything around him. His heart was racing, but his hands were still steady, as he took deep breaths, inhaling the scent of blood and decay around him. For a moment, everything was in slow motion as he crouched with his medical supplies hugged to his chest, and then a yelp came from somewhere and his entire body was on alert and moving. He stared ahead but he could only see silhouettes running amidst the screen of sand that covered everything, then he heard a whisper to his left. He crawled to where the sound came from. It was so dark that he was startled when he felt a body right in front of him.
Sherlock looked back into the lenses. He couldn't stop staring at the shimmering nebula that was the essence of John. It had to be a miracle, had to.
Suddenly all that mattered in the world was getting his hand there. He swiftly pulled Sherlock's trousers down his thighs, while still kissing and teasing at his nipples.
John's mouth fell open. He must have looked like an idiot staring at the man like that, but he thought he really could not be blamed for it.
At this point, Sherlock is almost shouting, his wrists still caged under John's hands, and suddenly, words tumble out of his mouth without thought or permission.
Sherlock had grown bored of food too quickly for John's liking. He had been struggling more and more to get food into him recently, but he found some ways to convince him.
I had so much planned, but it turned out the sex scene is soooo difficult I am surprised I even got it done! I do hope It's good enough though, I'm still not entirely happy with it
Too soon though, Sherlock was wiped clean, but Greg hadn’t had his fill, so he pushed the soft thighs further apart, stretched his tongue as far as he could, and pushed it inside the loosened wet entrance to get whatever was still in there.
He wondered how the hell this thing still existed in the modern world. The wooden boards were held together with frail ropes and alarmingly creaked under their feet. Halfway through, Sherlock glanced ahead to see the estate they were supposed to be staying at, but the moment he lifted his head, his foot slipped between two of the wooden boards and he lost his balance. Before he knew it, two strong arms held his waist, pulling him up on his feet.
The music was deafening in his ears as he closed his eyes, a blurred swirl of images rushed through his head. For the last time ever, he could hear the murmur of the unseen world. Voices around the earth, begging, crying, laughing, moaning, whispering…
"You got backbone, showing yourself like that, mate. I appreciate that. It'll make it easier." Greg said casually. "I got to tell you though, I feel fine. You might want to check your orders because I sure don't feel like I'm dying."
"Morning" Sherlock smiled and snuggled even closer. They lied in each other's arm, taking in each other's warmth for some time.
Sherlock sat at the edge of the bed, hands steepled under his chin while John changed into a pair of pajamas. He suddenly became aware of John standing by the bed looking at him
Philip huffed in annoyance and led him up the stairs and into a spacious bedroom on the second floor. The two bodies were lying side by side as if in an embrace on the bed. They both had gunshot wounds. The woman right through the temple, and the man through his forehead.
"I love you" he rasped out unintentionally, the words just came out of their own accord and Sherlock's heart sank in fear as John froze beneath him.
"Yes, and I don't think this is the best subject to discuss right now, yeah?" Susan snapped, then gave them all a fake smile as she tried to recollect herself.
And so it was. At 8 pm sharp, Greg Lestrade was standing outside 221B exactly. He had no idea what had been waiting for him, but he was shivering with excitement at the possibilities.
"You don't want to do this Costello," he said, while his brain frantically raced to come up with a plan "do you really want to answer for this on top of the trouble you're already in?"
"Huh. Bad news, I'm afraid." He turned the screen to him again "180 milligrams per deciliter, you're definitely diabetic."
As John tended to the few patients at sickbay, things seemed to deteriorate next-door, as Smith's radio could be heard from where he stood by the door.
"But you can feel me… You felt me" Sherlock felt like he was drowning, desperately reaching for something to grasp in the cold water.
The moment the door is shut behind them, Sherlock feels a million different emotions at once. Too many to identify and file, but all he wants is to be with John, kiss him, and hold him even for just a bit. It might be the last time he could.
"Are you okay?" Sherlock asked him, his voice cracking as they inhaled the dust now enveloping the room.
"Well then, afraid you'll have to fend for yourself with Mike after all." John says as he twists to lie on his back, hands supporting the back of his neck. His muscles ripple under golden skin. Sherlock stares at him with a mixture of arousal, anger, awe, and a hint of amusement. John Watson is one huge problematic, infuriating distraction. But he has something Sherlock needs right now, and Sherlock hates that he has to say yes.
"Search for the bags. They must have gotten rid of them as soon as they got the drugs. The location should give us a clue."
Also.. sorry to any Brit reading this, i'm sure this is super cringe-worthy to you guys, forgive this ignorant non-European who has no idea what she's talking about.
after John. Why? Sherlock didn't have time to think, he got up and launched himself at the attacker, grabbing him around the waist before he could reach John.
Greg tried not to feel thrilled about the prospect of 'next time' but failed. He turned around and left the flat, heart still pounding.
He didn't know how long it was before he felt himself being gently held. Familiar warmth and scent kept him from panicking again as he opened his eyes. He was still on the floor, with John staring down at him, and everyone else standing around them. Sherlock grunted in paint as he tried to get up. John's arm circled his shoulder protectively.
"No" Sherlock said again, seemingly unperturbed at the remark "One of the officers intentionally left his keys behind for the inmates to find. He wanted the riot to intensify so that everyone would assume inmates got to this office and killed this man. Very convenient isn't it? You want to blame your crime on someone else and you have a whole bunch of criminals at your disposal."
"You know you could have solved this case from your flat, but you were too bored weren't you Sherlock" Mycroft said, sighing in exasperation "I hope you had fun being tortured by the Italian mob and getting stuck in a bloody prison riot."
Sherlock followed him through the white halls, and let himself be guided to sit on a bed behind a curtain
"Ugh. Don't go all soft on me now Lestrade. Just keep bloody Anderson out of my face and we'll call it even."
Sherlock was bent over kitchen table, torch in one hand, eyeballs in the other. His hands were working animatedly, but his favorite pastime was quickly turning dull after seven entire days of no cases from Lestrade.
After what felt like an eternity, he opened his eyes to find John still stroking himself desperately. Without thinking, he descended, placing his forearms on either side of his torso and leaning on them to take John in his mouth. It wasn't long before he felt him shiver underneath him, bitter creamy shots of fluid filling Sherlock's mouth as he felt John still licking lazily at his hole. He swallowed with relish and closed his eyes in utter bliss.
"Yes, come on in, love. He's upstairs playing that godforsaken violin of his. Just keep it down boys, I have to be up early tomorrow and I know that old bed upstairs creaks so much."
"Well, let me see" Sherlock huffs in annoyance as he remembers "Your stupid hospital just replaced the morgue registrar who used to give me access to my specimens." He complains as if it's all John's fault.
John’s tongue licked at the tip of the pink erection, and his fingers hooked themselves around the edges of his trousers on either side to strip him completely naked.
At any rate, this was how Sherlock started working with the New Scotland Yard. Greg and Molly had come for dinner at Baker Street. Though Sherlock had not seemed very interested in most of the conversation, he had turned his head suddenly like a cat once Greg mentioned a particularly difficult case he was working on. Sherlock had asked a couple of questions before announcing "It was the brother in law." They all stared at him until he impatiently explained how he reached the conclusion.
His limbs felt like fluid as he shifted to face John again. John smiled adoringly at him as he took him in his arms, and they both fell asleep like that.
Sorry about the lousy deductions, but I really wanted Sherlock to be in character, this is why we all love him right?
John had thought he wouldn't come either. It was too painful to even think of what had happened the other day at the park, but it was a battle of pride and pain against an unfathomable urge to breathe the same air with Sherlock one more time. It was a lost battle of course, John knew that much.
John slumps his body next to Sherlock, panting. He starts to giggle as he turns his head to look at Sherlock.
Hey, so I've just had this idea and was so excited to start with it, it's really a short start but I just wanted to set it first. Thanks to whoever's reading, have a lovely day.
John doesn't get to kiss, or hug, or spoil him like he wishes he could. What he gets is heated nights of mind-blowing sex, moments where his brain cancels everything expect the divine body he is worshipping, and on very rare occasions, milliseconds where Sherlock's beautiful face is so open and fragile after a particularly good kiss, that it melts John's heart.
"There is no doubt Lidiya's body was moved from the house to the woods. Lidiya had her choker on when she was carried past the window, but Bill found it in the house. If it had fallen, then it would have landed outside or in the woods. The truth is, Lidiya was carried out of the front door to the outside, and that's where Bill found the choker."
As Sherlock stand to leave, John turns and gets the chain holding his keys from the hook on the wall.
"You're not insane" He hoped he didn't sound as dazed as he felt. His idiotic heart flipped when John smiled at him, his eyes crinkling slightly, before he started the car and began to drive.
He blinked again, and there was Sherlock, staring down at him with fearful eyes. He watched as a tear fell from the lovely face and landed softly on his cheek. He wished he could lift a hand and touch him, maybe crack a joke and make him laugh with that rich silky voice, but his body was frozen, a fly suspended in amber. So he just stared at the shifting color in Sherlock's eyes, the milky softness of his face, and the warm pink of his lips. He then realized they were moving, saying something.
The heavenly smell of sex wafted and filled the room and Greg's nostrils. Unable to take it any longer, he undid his trousers and pushed his hand down his pants to stroke his hard-rock cock, but he did it slowly, teasing himself with an erratic pace to relish every moment of it.
John shook his head repeatedly and closed his eyes as if he couldn't stand to look at Sherlock anymore.
True, they were only flat mates, best friends as John put it, nothing more, but Sherlock had grown used to having John close all the time. He just couldn't risk spending three potentially tedious days at home without him. Also, he actually quite liked complaining to John and driving him insane. Bickering was one of their favorite activities together.
John made his morning round, discharging patients who were in no need of staying over much longer at the infirmary. By now he was getting rather good at identifying those who were feigning just to avoid the yard for a bit longer. Unfortunately, he could not accommodate them as the infirmary was already overburdened and understaffed as it is.
"I have been watching you, detective inspector. I know you have been after me, but you can't stop this. You see, I'm at the verge of acquiring groundbreaking findings."
John nods, trying to calm his racing heart. He watches Sherlock watching James leave, not knowing what to say.
"Don't wanna cause any trouble… you know, with your girlfriend." John said between bites of dumpling.
Sherlock didn't care, he had John, alive and safe, in his flat… in his bed, and he wanted to stay locked with him in their warm cocoon, to kiss and touch and smell him every waking minute of his life.
Greg had to let it out and confess to what had been driving him insane for the past couple of months. He wanted John Watson at any cost. Just one night, one chance to have that body. It wasn’t that he had feelings for him or anything, it was just good old undeniable, desperate ofrce of lust for a particular army doctor.
"It's a key to my flat, so that you don't have to pick my lock and sneak in anymore." John says simply.
What had he hoped? What did he want to say? Why is he suddenly staring behind Sherlock at the door to his flat like he wants to run away?
"No one can be that clever" Sherlock rolled his eyes, though he felt his cheeks flush like they did every time John called him brilliant or amazing or fantastic.
"Sorry, we kind of started without you" Sherlock smiled cunningly and gestured at a chair opposite the bed.
"Well yes… with the riot and all. They breached cell block, I heard it on the radio." John said, though he felt unsure under Sherlock's skeptical gaze.
"John, um ... I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m really not looking for any ..."
Sherlock's brain stuttered for a moment, his memory recalling data that he had yet to be aware of storing. There was another photo like this one, same style, same black and white effect… a photo of the couple from yesterday.
It hit him like a ton of bricks. Everything suddenly fell into place in his head, and the euphoria of it made his heart thrum madly in his chest. He moved away from the window, standing in front of John to shield him from the man he now knew was the murderer.
He reaches a hand into the pocket of his coat to feel the key that John gave him, and his heart jumps to declare war and take over all rational thought, once again reducing him to a shy teenager.
Greg stared in agony as golden skin glittered with sweat, he hungrily watched the muscular shoulders moving gracefully, the blonde sparse hair on John's chest barely visible on equally golden complexion, he waited desperately until John finally… finally pushed down his trousers and pants.
He waited as the nurse tied the apron behind his back, feeling Sarah's eyes on him. She had been giving him this assessing look for days now, constantly asking him what was wrong. It set him on edge for some reason.
"You going out for a walk too? I'll come along, need some fresh air." Bill's voice came from behind and Sherlock turned. His cheeks were flushed from the wine he had, and he had a knowing smile on his face. Sherlock's heart jumped at the thought that Bill might have guessed what was going on, but there was no time, he had to follow John and keep him as far as possible from that unsavory woman.
He hears his door open and his stomach twists. It's stupid, he's known Sherlock for months now and they've had sex for God's sake. He just needs to somehow convince him that they should be more than this, that they could have something better and stronger. If only Sherlock would let him, John would give him everything and anything.
John thought of calling for back-up, but he was too desperate to catch the psycho with his own hands, he could not tolerate the idea of not confronting him after all this time. Sherlock didn't even seem to consider the idea of calling for back-up.
"I'm so glad you made it. I was telling Greg how bad I'd been feeling about being so dreadful to you at the hospital, but well, you know. Greg made me so worried"
It occurs to him that Sherlock must have deduced his past with James by now. He looks at him, but Sherlock's face is closed and expressionless.
"There's a guy outside, says you wanted him to change the locks. Want me to call him off?" Dimmock said.
Also.. I intentionally made Sherlock younger cause this case would be like a 5 for him.. but maybe a younger Sherlock with less experience would find it harder I guess..
John lifted his head and looked at her beautiful green eyes. He needed to ask a question, to talk about a feeling that had been tormenting him
They both groaned as their erections lined up, hot skin on skin. Sherlock started moving, already feeling his body shivering with rapture.
John made it to the station just as a wide-eyed, disheveled man was being hauled into the investigation room. He didn't wait and followed without a word, snatching along the hastily typed brief from a grumpy looking Sally Donovan.
"Absolutely. Put him through." John answered quietly and with a practiced motion took out his phone's battery and shoved it in his the pocket of his jacket.
But what would he do? Confess his feelings? Start a relationship? He doesn't know how that works. It sounds awfully boring and pointless and unnecessarily complicated. He will ruin it as he ruins everything in his life. John would be sick and tired of him in no time.
“I might have an idea” Sherlock whispered to Greg with a strange smile before he followed John out of the crime scene.
"What? Where?" Greg hastily put a hand on his mouth and his eyes darted to his wife in panic, and as she moved closer, he fidgeted in his bed and something fell from under the blanket onto the floor.
"Yeah, they're out there. You see them, but most of the time you just walk on by. Nobody likes to think of the old life… You know, what they gave up"
"Shut up." Sherlock says, fighting a smile. "Fine. I begged. Don't get used to it though. Now, will you talk to Mark for me?"
Halloween! As if the world was not already brimming with useless banalities, Sherlock thought, once again wishing he was back at Baker Street conducting an experiment or waiting for a good case. But John loved Halloween, Sherlock had noticed that. Last October he had brought a bunch of DvD's, all with ludicrous titles involving zombies and vampires. Sherlock had been forced to join in the marathon that time as well, at which he proceeded to fall asleep on the couch and wake up to a very awkward situation, his head resting on John's shoulder and his face almost buried in his neck.
Little did John know then that he had created a monster. Sherlock spent hours staring into his new microscope, marveling at everything he saw. He made it a mission to cram everything he could on the tiny slot and stare at it for hours on end.
Again, this is short, but I promise I have interesting plans for next chapter. Hugs to anyone reading <3
They walked in comfortable silence, their hands occasionally nudging, and Sherlock found himself hopeful again. Maybe John could forgive him after all.
He found him sitting on the kitchen table, peering through the lenses of the microscope John had given him as a gift just recently.
John sat through Nurse Anderson's daily whining about everything that ever happened to him. He smiled to himself as he thought of how many push-up's he could give him if this was the army. He sighed thinking of the good old days.
He didn't know how long it was before he came to, but he opened his eyes to the hottest thing he'd ever seen. John stroking himself desperately while just looking at him… just staring at Sherlock, taking him in, and drawing pleasure from the mere thought that he existed. John shuddered in his arms as he came, and they both collapsed into each other, breathing the same air.
"I was young and he was my teacher. I thought I was in love." John shrugs. Sherlock doesn't want to ask why he's telling him this, because he is desperate to know.
John could only hear gunshots, screams, and a chopper outside. When he opened his eyes, Costello was on the floor bleeding, but Dimmock was nowhere to be seen. John shifted and realized he was being held tightly in Sherlock's arms.
Cycling to work every day was not the safest, and definitely not the most practical, idea in a city like London, yet John did it every day. He needed this small rush of adrenaline every morning.  He needed to feel his muscles working and the cold air hitting his face before he could dive into endless chaos of his regular work day. This morning was exceptionally satisfying. John felt the heat as his muscles worked at maximum capacity, avoiding cars and maneuvering through traffic.
So, it was only natural that he seized the opportunity to take this job. A prison doctor may not be the best pay or the easiest circumstances for a retired soldier, but it provided just what he needed. The full use of his skills as a doctor and a soldier, though the latter was not officially in the job description. Since he had started this job, his nightmares have been less severe, though not completely at bay, and he hadn't been feeling like he was going insane.
His hand slows, pulling himself through the aftershocks, and John leans forward to kiss what he can reach (spends a bit of time at the little dip between Sherlock's collar bones).
- Sherlock, on his side - John, straddling his lower leg, holding the upper one up against his chest as he rocks into him, urgently -
- of John above him, Sherlock's legs high around his waist, arms tight around his shoulders as John pounds him into the mattress; pressing John up against their front door, hesitant kisses become steadily more
Did he imagine an easy early-morning kiss on the way out the door, just their mouths touching, a mumbled, "Tell the bees I want you back for lunch" -
Sherlock turns his head to the side, cheek catching on the leather, as John slowly spreads him open, and he clenches around John at the thought, the filthy
(John - so impressively perceptive, especially being rather indifferent to prostate stimulation himself - happily,
. He folds the memory up carefully, precise, crisp creases; and while there's not a moment of intimacy with John he'll ever forget, he files this with his other favourite moments of sexual congress with John (the first time John touched him, eyes darting over Sherlock's face, licking his lips nervously, breath stuttering as badly as Sherlock's; the first time John had penetrated him, slow and careful, as he pressed Sherlock into the mattress; the first time he'd climaxed twice, his eyes wide and shocked, John's dark, impressed and so,
He leans over, bracing one hand on the bed beside Sherlock's side and drags his cock back up and down again, and Sherlock shuffles, spreading his legs, just a little. He pushes against Sherlock's entrance again before pulling away.
"Always," Sherlock breathes, eyes slipping shut for a moment, before he shakes his head, just once, and refocuses on Mycroft. "You think that Eurus, that Sherrinford, is what I could've-"
"You know, of course," Mycroft says, pausing to inspect the tip of his umbrella, "that not returning ... affectionate overtures," he grimaces, "is not the same as being
It's quiet, just John's heavy breathing and the wet noises of Sherlock's mouth, until he touches his lips to John's bollocks, and John swears, breathlessly, "
Conversation clearly over, he hums in the affirmative (Sherlock usually makes the tea, but John clearly needs to get
the next time my parents are in town." He levels a stare at John. "How was that?" he asks, with mock curiosity.
Sherlock reverses his position so John can grab his other leg, pulling it across him again, and Sherlock sighs, closing his eyes.
"That," Sherlock says, sliding off the edge of the table and dropping gracefully to his knees, "Will not be a problem."
He closes his eyes for a moment. "Get up here," he says, roughly, and Sherlock shakily gets to his feet, pushing down his pants and straddling John's lap. Sherlock wraps his hand, slick with pre-ejaculate and spit, around his own cock, tugging quickly. He's already breathing hard.
John looks between the laptop and Sherlock, runs through a quick check of the obvious (only finished a case in the early hours of this morning, eaten and slept since, Mycroft hasn't been by recently, no more than the usual level of irritation at John's slow typing) -
Sherlock waves a hand in front of his face, dismissively; tries to re-fit the facts as John smiles at him, without looking up from the paper -
"I," Sherlock says blankly, blinking, rapidly, "That is-" he swallows, and John loves him all the more for it, reaching up to kiss along his jaw -
"Very clever," John says, drily, and Mycroft tilts his head to the side. "Look," John says, bracing his elbows on the desk, "He's your brother. I
clear, but he loves Sherlock's mouth, loves touching a thumb to the corner of his stretched lips as he works his mouth over him, and he does it now, fingers resting against Sherlock's throat as he swallows, convulsively.
He kisses a path across Sherlock's chest as Sherlock comes back down, hands stroking Sherlock's thighs gently until Sherlock takes a steadying breath (and when John reaches up to run fingers still smelling like Deep Heat through Sherlock's hair, he wrinkles his nose for only a moment).
"You're close, aren't you," he doesn't really ask, as Sherlock begins to pant, "I know you, Sherlock." Sherlock's mouth goes slack with pleasure and John tucks his mouth in close to Sherlock's ear. "Oh, that's lovely," he murmurs, and Sherlock grabs his forearm - not stilling his hand - as he starts to come.
"John, you know I listen to very little my brother says," Sherlock murmurs into his glass, but he doesn't have to be a consulting ... consulting thingy ... to
"That's it," John murmurs, reaching out to rub his hands up and down Sherlock's thighs, and Sherlock jerks, twisting in John's lap. "Just like that," he adds, and Sherlock makes a hoarse noise as his chin falls forward. John slides his hands down a bit further, towards Sherlock's knees, and presses them apart.
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at him, but follows him into the kitchen, hopping up onto the clear(-ish) tabletop. John steps into him, grabbing his hips and tugging him towards the very edge of the table.
"Wasn't at all what I was expecting," John sighs, with mock disappointment, and Mycroft narrows his eyes at him.
The lines around Sherlock's eyes deepen in amusement. "John, this wasn't quite what I had in mind-" and John reaches down to help him up.
Sherlock's chest is rising and falling as he watches John. He crawls forward to kiss him again, murmurs, "C'mon. Get your kit off," and Sherlock barks out a laugh, even as he shoves his loose pyjama bottoms and pants down.
He adds a bit more lube to the hand still slick with Sherlock's drying come and kneels above him, legs outside Sherlock's, and drags the head of his cock between the cheeks of Sherlock's arse, nudges against Sherlock's rim, where it catches, resists.
. And if you have a problem with that, we should sort it out before we're family." Mycroft grimaces, and John points out, a little tetchily, "Yeah, I'm not exactly thrilled, either."
, topics to pick from - Mary, and if he's ever had second thoughts; John's previous ... encounters - now that sexual history is apparently on the table; whether he's ever thought about Sherlock -) Mrs. Hudson taps on the open door.
Mycroft crosses one foot over the other, toe digging into the floor. "Met her?" he prompts, ignoring them with practiced ease.
John groans as he starts to come, hips pushing up as the pleasure crests, and Sherlock strokes him through it, his come landing on Sherlock's tongue, his bottom lip,
"Feeling that?" John asks, quietly, and Sherlock gives a tiny nod. "Other side?" John asks, and Sherlock takes another big breath.
"Oh, Christ," John swears, under his breath, "He'll never get that." He tugs his chair forward, touches Sherlock's arm (can't

Sherlock nuzzles in against his bollocks, mouthing at them, before lifting back up and replacing his hand with his mouth again. John's hips push up, instinctively, into the touch, and Sherlock hums a little in encouragement, until John fucks up into Sherlock with short, sharp jabs, his grunting desperate and
He touches Sherlock's rim with his slick fingers, dipping just inside with one fingertip, before replacing them with his cock. He presses in again, and when the head pops in, John lets out a shaky breath.

Mycroft places two pictures side-by-side, head tilting slightly as he considers them, and John sighs. "Was there a point to - hang on, is that
Sherlock pulls back a little, panting, soft and warm against the inside of John's thigh. "Not good?" he asks, warily, and John lifts his head from the pillow for a moment.
Mycroft doesn't move for a long moment. "Five minutes," he finally says, moving towards the door, and John jerks his head, just once, in thanks.
"I'm turning in," John murmuring, hair noticeably greyer, laugh lines deeper - then, at the non-committal grunt, smile slowly becoming
As he'd hoped, John runs a hand through his hair, fingernails scratching lightly over his scalp, and he tilts his face up to kiss the curve of John's collarbone.
that. But he doesn't need your protection." He pauses. "Well, not from me. Legally, your protection might come in handy," he kids, and Mycroft's gaze is withering.
John glances over at Mycroft. "Sherlock, you're," he pauses, searches for the proper medical term, "off your bloody face right now."
He collapses beside Sherlock, on his back, and Sherlock pulls one arm away from his face to rest his hand on John's chest, as he rubs his face against the pillow.
Ah. Yes. Rings a bell. But the battle between the desire to make John laugh and to understand this wages
He sits back on his heels and shoves the right cheek of Sherlock's arse up with the palm of his hand, just to watch the way it jiggles when he lets go, and makes a noise like he's in pain.
Sherlock grabs the back of his shirt and tugs it up and over his head, dropping it beside them, and John grins at him again as he tugs him towards the bed. He pushes Sherlock down on the bed and gets a knee between Sherlock's, catches it on the edge of the bed and props himself up over Sherlock.
and frowns at the simplicity of - "sad?" he ventures (and it's not a particularly impressive deduction, even he can admit).
"Partners," he amends, with a curl of his lip, and John leans forward, chest warm against Sherlock's back, to press a series of kisses along the line of his jaw.
them, until they're gripping Sherlock's arse cheek. He leaves Sherlock's hand there and swaps hands, bringing Sherlock's left hand down to join it.
"I don't mind," John murmurs, before pulling a confused face at himself. Perhaps his mouth is behaving traitorously, too. "Have you ever - you know. Wanted to?" he adds, and Sherlock touches his fingertips to his mouth for a moment (and the door to a room he rarely lets himself visit bursts open before he can slam it shut - images -
When he turns around, mugs in hand, Sherlock averts his glance, murmurs his thanks when John places one of the mugs in front of him -
"She's ... grieving for him, yes," John tries again, "But. When you ... lose ... someone. You grieve for them, and you grieve for the future you've lost."
with a title if you're going to give it away-" he breaks off, stomping over to the couch and collapsing, dramatically, in a huff.
He takes another sip of his drink, and John works his jaw for a moment, as he gathers his nerve, and Sherlock's
Sherlock turns his head into the kiss he knows is coming as John reaches down and strokes his cock again. He huffs out a tiny breath through his nose, and John kisses him again, before pulling back a little to watch his hand, to watch the way the head of Sherlock's cock is swallowed up in his grip, as he strokes him, root to tip.
Sherlock finally sits up again, wiping at the corner of his mouth with his thumb, and John throws a forearm over his eyes, lets out a choked-off laugh, and Sherlock lowers himself beside, onto, John's chest, head resting on his shoulder.
Sherlock pauses, studies it for a moment, before leaning in and placing a series of kisses from base to tip, open mouthed and wet, just a little sloppy. His tongue darts out and he licks delicately at the head of John's cock, and John's hips jerk forward, helpless and shivery.
"Every woman you've deigned to pay attention to," John insists, "But you know Mary's ex-boyfriends. You know her favourite colour. You know which of her family members she still talks to.  Christ, Sherlock, you know her
(and he's almost certain that John feels the curve of a smile on his lips when he presses a kiss to John's still-trembling chest).
." John drags his hands down Sherlock's legs again. He clenches his fists, digs in his knuckles and pushes back up towards Sherlock's hips again. "
I swear under my breath while the chauffeur is doing his best to navigate the London traffic, using shortcuts only known to people who do not have to be afraid of being stopped by the police. I try to phone John, he does not answer. Fuck, this is not good. Of course he has a newborn on his hands but then his sister and her friend should still be there …
He shakes his head. ‘No. He did not tell me and I … you know … we once have been close but this was before he … went away.’
For the first time sadness threatens to overwhelm John and dispel his anger. ‘The doctor realises that he is not happy, not happy enough for a man who just got married and will be a father. And of course, the lovely nurse sees what is happening and it pisses her off big time. And then … well. Then the lovely nurse threatens to shoot a man who has some information on her– this is at least, what I think – and the detective comes in and she shoots him first. Strange, isn’t it? Shooting someone who can fold such lovely napkins for your wedding.’
And there it is again, the sense of hurt and betrayal I remember from that night. His voice, his face, his foot kicking the chair - and Mary standing there like a statue, waiting, dismissive, calculating.
In one fluent motion I get up from the sofa, walk over the coffee table and press him against the door, my forearm blocking his windpipe.
‘John, please. Why did he take the drugs? Was he in some sort of distress? Did he feel ill before he was shot? Did he behave in a strange way?’
He shakes himself out of his reverie. She is petite, geometrically cut dark hair with a fringe, wearing a frilly white summer dress strangely at odds with her 1950s existentialist hairstyle and yet she looks stunning.
And then, after a flash of inspiration, he started digging in the back of his wardrobe until he found a T-shirt that had sneaked its way into the tumble-dryer and had never been the same. He had only kept it on the off chance that one day he might be required to pose as a … anyway. He held it up. Nice colour, the same as one of his favourite shirts. And the material was elastic, no problem there. And so it went into the suitcase.
He remembers his first deductions about her, words swirling in front of his face, dissolving into the darkness until only one of them remains. LIAR.
“What is this film even about?“ scoffed Sherlock and threw a balled sock at the television. “People behaving ridiculously and sleeping in the streets of a half-sunken Godforsaken city because they got lost after being invited by some creepy guy I would not have followed two metres in broad daylight, much less into his shady bar. And his father was obviously a sadist. I would not have expected ever to utter these words but can we please continue the Doctor Who marathon?"
”Without her baby, carrying two suitcases. She took a taxi and booked into a hotel room in Bayswater.“
When John goes home in the evening to get some hours rest, Mary is not there. He finds a note on the kitchen table:
When he comes to, the fire has gone out and the room is uncomfortably cold; the pipe lying on the well-worn burgundy red carpet. He sits up, remembers what he saw last before he slept, faded, dissolved, whatever describes his condition best.
in the north and walks along Rue Nostradamus. Grandmère used to tell him about the prophet and his predictions but he has never understood how people still can give any credit to this nonsense. But he fondly remembers warm evenings in the garden, the scent of oleander and lavender, crickets chirping, Grandmère’s brittle voice telling him about Michel de Nostredame who was not just a prophet but also an apothecary and a doctor and an astrologer. Maybe this has somehow taken root in him and has directed his own penchant for chemistry, nudging him from early on towards a science that once was connected with the ancient traditions of alchemy.
He remembers the look of shame on Mycroft’s face. Was he ashamed about his own stupidity, or his lack or care in placing Mary Morstan in John Watson’s life?
Christmas. Oh, yes, this is brilliant. Presenting his parents as the perfect married couple, teasing but in a loving way, just like...well. Do not go there. Here be dragons.
And even earlier, the remark about the confidante, a word he would never use himself. A word for spies and agents and people who work undercover, in a world of darkness and deceit.
I count the days in the calendar. Check the expected date of delivery. That was two days ago. Daily examinations now, CTG. I pace the flat, from the door to the window to the fireplace to the kitchen, start experiments and throw them away after having ruined them. I cannot concentrate. Will it always be like this from now on?
When the warm drops hit John‘s face his mouth turns into a smile. Then his eyes close, his head dropping to the side.
Sherlock suddenly remembers the way Magnussen seemed to call up information, said he was reading. Not with the glasses, he does not think it might work. What else could it be?
”Mary is not the only one who hides behind a facade, Sherlock. You do the same except your armour is a coat with up-turned collar and a scathing voice and biting remarks. And there is another difference. You do not hide a murderous past but something precious. Something you told the world you did not possess. But I know this is not true. Jim Moriarty for once got it right.“
On leaving the bakery he turns to the right and nearly stumbles over a blackboard someone has inconveniently placed in the middle of the pavement.
But then there was another sound – he would not have heard it except it was so quiet in the room, the penthouse floating high above the city like an untethered airship.
Greg's face lit up as he took out his wallet, where he had a photo of the woman who had nagged John for days about her husband. Molly had beautiful brown eyes that glittered with a strange mixture of innocence and mischief. Greg stared at the photo with so much affection and pride, Sherlock suddenly understood how he had known about John.
He doesn't know why he does it, but he just lies in John's bed to think. John's bed is made neatly most days, smoothed evenly with the sheets all tucked in like a hospital bed. But on rear occasions, John wakes up minutes later than usual and has no time to put the sheets in order before he gets ready. Sherlock loves those days. First he examines the imprint on the mattress and the way the duvet has been twisted and pushed to accommodate the body that has been sleeping there in the night.
John thought if anyone was allowed whatever experiments they desired to make, it would be his Sherlock. He was intelligent beyond belief, incredibly observant of every little detail. The beautiful brain was somehow unique in every way and absolutely magnificent, and John wondered if it had anything to do with what he once was.
Sherlock feels his tongue now probing the ring of muscles slowly at first, but then John takes up his pace and starts stabbing his tongue in there hard, making Sherlock's whole body bounce with the movement.
"I think she might have dropped it when she left to go on her walk. You know, before…" Bill fell silent, staring sadly at the choker in his hand.
"Today we're going to be conducting a social experiment." Jefferson suddenly said in a terrifyingly mechanical tone, reminiscent of a documentary's voice-over. John and Sherlock exchanged a look.
"Because Johnson knew something he shouldn't have. The same thing I've been investigating at the infirmary"
Done, phew! for some reason this last chapter was like "fuck you, you can't write me" and made me so frustrated, but here it is at last!
"Oh god!" Rupert screamed, "The bandaged man must have cut the line! We need to leave now! I'm not staying here waiting to be butchered by that freak!" He wailed and just like that, turned around and ran away.
"Come on, don't do this! Damn it, come on! Tom! Come on!"  Suddenly, the doctor lifted his face, desperation painted in his eyes… eyes that for some unfathomable reason connected with Sherlock's. Sherlock stared back… what? What was going on? He couldn’t be looking AT him! Yet the doctor's desperate eyes remained on Sherlock, as if pleading. Sherlock averted his eyes and looked at the man who was now standing on his side and staring down at his lifeless body as if it were strange to him. "Time of death 11:06 am"
"Yeah, I haven't had the chance to get dinner. Thought I'd bring some Chinese for us to have before we discuss the cases."
Is he now admitting to himself the real reason why he's been missing John Watson like he's never missed anyone? The real reason behind this crippling misery, and why all he can think of is John's deep blue eyes.
The kiss became deeper and more heated, and John gradually moved, leaning his forearms on the matters to kiss him properly.
"Dr. Stamford, this man is asking for Dr. Watson and I'm afraid he isn't around" the receptionist said, looking at Mike, apparently hoping he would ask Sherlock to leave
"Let's stay calm, everyone." John said. He seemed the only one to have maintained his composure. The others were all breathing hard and Rupert was sniffing repeatedly.
"You must have planned everything when Bill sent the invitations last month." John said. "Does it have to do with Amy? Your friend who committed suicide?"
The trip to the hospital was a 10-minute battle to keep medics from poking at his face and forcing him to stay still. He refused to lie in a stretcher or sit in a chair, and once they arrived, he fled their gloved hands and entered the hospital's reception area running
He had had his keys with him when he arrived at work in the morning. He usually kept them in the pocket of his lab coat. He hadn't missed them until afternoon, after Sherlock had left, could it be?
"You're the reason we never see Johnny anymore. You have to stop keeping him all to yourself all the time!"
"So you're telling me a young, married couple whose idea of a hot Friday night is watching the biography of the father of the Antiviolence Movement keep an unregistered, loaded 32 in their flat?" John was speaking enthusiastically now, unable to contain himself, everything was so obvious, all the pieces were falling into place. "I don't think so. Someone did this. This is like the other ones, Greg. They're all connected."
Usually, Sherlock loves to lie back and indulge in the attention John lavishes on him. It's become a new sort of addition to him, to wallow in the various pleasures those clever hands send through his body. John has learned every sensitive spot and every caress that make Sherlock gasp and writhe in his arms. He knows how to bring him to completion over and over again, having memorized the map of his body and its secrets.
John picked at his fruit salad as he sat opposite Sherlock, who seemed to just enjoy watching him eat.
They take a cab to the posh hotel where the event is to take place, and John spends the ride thinking of what he is going to say, and how he can talk to Sherlock without scaring him off.
The moon-pale face only made an appearance in the haze of dreams that invaded what minimal shuteye John was able to get between intervals of tormenting insomnia. He had never felt more tired, and everything he did was mechanic and devoid of feelings.
His trail of thoughts was cut when John started waving. Sherlock looked at where John was staring and saw someone standing by the house. They were still too far to make out who it was, but Sherlock could see that the stranger was in a long black cloak and their face was… could it be? Sherlock took quicker steps, squinting his eyes to take a better look. Indeed, the stranger's face was completely covered in bandages, leaving only their eyes. It was silly, Sherlock knew it was just a person who'd possibly had an injury, but there was something wrong… something hostile and blood chilling about the way he lurked there. John seemed to get the same feeling, because he stopped waving and his hand went down slowly as his brow furrowed in confusion.
Not good, very not good. John started replacing the gauze quickly and efficiently, trying to clear his head.
"I'm just saying, potential flat mates should know the worst about each other beforehand." Sherlock answered, sighing as John traced a finger down his face.
He closed his eyes, and took an unconscious step back. Somehow, it felt the same as the day he had found them there, the same stab of pain and loss all over again. He couldn’t suppress a startled gasp at the feeling of a warm hand on his shoulder.
He felt an invisible force drawing him into the sad eyes. He wanted to stroke the soft hair and hold the trembling hands. Sherlock got closer and listened to the murmur of thought:
John had never kissed or been kissed like that before, all of his senses were invested and engrossed in savoring the taste and texture of Sherlock's mouth beneath him, he didn't know how long it lasted, but he couldn't peel himself away from the perfect lips.
"We're fine. Let's check if Lidiya is already inside." John said as they all went inside the house, just as thunder started rumbling and rain intensified.
Sherlock came closer, still hidden from sight. He knew John felt it, though he couldn't see him. He sighed as Sherlock lied behind to him and wrapped his arms around his lean frame, a cherished treasure under his watchful gaze.
He turns around to look at John, who is lying on his back, slightly propped up on his elbows. The sheets have slipped off his body and formed a puddle between his thighs. They only cover his groin, but the delicious V lines leading downwards are visible, maddeningly so.
Of course, they pretended it was for the case, but in reality no progress was actually happening. Jefferson Hope was nowhere to be found. Fortunately, a list of all his clients was found in his flat. Excluding those who have yet to complete a year of marriage, and those who were no longer together, all couples were made aware of the threat and were assigned protection in hope of catching the psychopath red-handed. However, Hope had yet to attack any more couples, and so, all they could do for now was wait.
Then John did something amazing again. He lined up their erections and started moving, still devouring Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's grip became tighter and tighter around John's back as he felt his whole body throbbing with pleasure and need for more.
John kept staring up at him, torn between amazement and disbelief, but everything Sherlock said made sense so far. Maybe he was telling the truth after all. John did feel like this man did not belong here the moment he laid eyes on him.
At first Sherlock didn't seem to pay him any attention, but then he suddenly lifted his head and eyed him suspiciously. He seemed to be trying to decide on what he wanted to say. John simply watched the strangest expressions of confusion and puzzlement pass through the pale face before he finally spoke.
"I'll just…" John gestured at the stares with a nod of his head, his hands occupied, carrying the box and food.
Today is one of those days, and Sherlock sighs as he shuts his eyes and buries his nose in John's pillow. The smell sends shivers down his body, and he can't help remembering the feeling of John's hands on him. He is forced to admit that he misses them so much it almost hurts. His skin burns with yearning when he remembers how John touches him, peeling away his clothes to trace the exposed skin gently with his fingers. He shuffles and adjusts his legs as he feels a delicious shiver running through him and heat settling between his thighs.
He was engulfed by the taste and smell and sound of his lover, it wasn't long before he was relishing a creamy warm liquid as Sherlock came with a shout, and it wasn't long either before John was having the best orgasm in his life.
He sipped his tea as he skimmed through the medical files of the new arrivals. Nothing unusual. They were all healthy enough to fight and maim each other however they wish inside these walls, except… John stopped at one file. It was the mugshot that drew his attention: A pale face with eyes that could only be described as intelligent. He did not look like the other addicts, thieves, and rapists, if anything he looked posh with those shiny curls. John's eyes slid on the information listed below the picture. The inmate had diabetes type 1, which meant he needed insulin shots on a daily basis.
"That's hypoglycemic. Your body's reacting to the insulin like you're not a diabetic. Are you sure it's Type 1 Diabetes you've got?"
At the hospital, Sherlock watched John prepping for the surgery. He looked better. His eyes were clear and hands were steady. Sherlock stood by him through the operation. He did not even fight the temptation to listen in to John's thoughts.
"They were found at approximately 11:30 am today. Neighbor had a break down and she's out of it, can't really give a statement now." He said as John kneeled on the edge of the bed to examine the gun in the husband's hand. Crime scene personnel were passing by around them, some of them glaring at John meaningfully.
"Humans change, Sherlock. Sentiment doesn't last. You will regret it." He paused, seemingly reluctant to continue, but he did anyway "and your loss would break my heart."
Sherlock extended his bared arm, eyes searching John's face inquisitively, just as Anderson entered the room carrying some files. He rummaged in a drawer for a moment before he spoke to John.
"I know, that's why you eat mine" John rolls his eyes as he hangs his coat and puts a bag of takeaway on the table. He pretends it bothers him, but he intentionally gets extra portions of food because he knows Sherlock likes to eat off his plate or just pick at whatever John's having, and John has a feeling it's the closest thing to a meal Sherlock has all day.
He was thrown back on the bed by the force of it, and he could feel the sheets being drenched in blood around him. The last thing he saw was the terror on Sherlock's beautiful face before he closed his eyes and gave in to the oblivion.
I'm sorry for the late update. The magical fairies of inspiration seemed to have abandoned me lately, hope you enjoy this though!
Soon, they were completely gone. Sherlock huffed in annoyance. He looked at Bill, only to find him sporting the most annoying smile, accompanied with a quirk of the eyebrow.
Greg started slowing down, taking down his pace to lick and kiss rather than fuck and suck. Just as he licked at Sherlock’s perineum, he felt John’s tongue brushing his mouth. Unable to restrain himself, he pushed forward and sucked on the warm pink tongue for a moment, at which he felt himself shake with pleasure and come violently in his pants. It felt so good it almost hurt.
They stood there, chest to chest, connected in every way, and it felt like heaven. Tenderness quickly turned into passionate heat as John licked into his mouth. Sherlock simply followed his lead, ready to receive whatever John gave him.
Dimmock's smile slid quickly off his face as he moved aside to let John pass "Of course. Go ahead" he said, and turned to go, leaving John with Smith, who wasn't nearly as much of a git.
"No. Shut up about it already" John said, though he was rather amused by this. He had replied similarly to "Higgins, Harper, Herbert, and Hannibal"
He turns to ascend the stairs, but then the temptation to turn the other way… just to the left, suddenly grows wildly. He knows John is home, can deduce it from the smell of tea, the position of the door mat, and the fact that John was on call yesterday and must be off today.
Sherlock looked at the lovely face filled with doubt and confusion, and at that moment he knew, he had to help John Watson.
But John wasn't entirely paying attention. He preferred to discuss what was really important at the moment. He had no time to waste talking about jurisdiction and suspension.
His heart was beating wildly as if it was trying to escape the cage of his ribs, and his brain was shutting everything down except for the delicious kiss. But he wanted more, he needed more of the taste of John, the smell of John, the feel of John. Unconsciously, he lifted a hand and grabbed John's collar, tugging him towards his body. John was still sitting on the floor next to the tub, and huffed a small laugh as he was being pulled inside.
"I figured you had deduced everything that was going to happen and was prepared for it" He tried to shrug but winced as he remembered he had a shattered shoulder.
But right now, Sherlock wants to be the one in control, to take John apart and put him back together again. He deepens the kiss, and John makes a delicious sound that dissolves into the hot twists and turns of their mouths. Sherlock is surprised to find himself biting on the delicious pink lower lip, but John doesn’t seem to mind in the least, moaning softly and breathing harshly against him.
"As a matter of fact I did." Sherlock said sounding too calm, given the situation they were in. John turned his face to glare at him, why couldn't he shut up for just one minute!
Yet something didn't quite make sense to Sherlock. Why would the murderer pass by the window and go around the house into the forest to dump Lidiya's body there? It was as if he'd wanted them to see him for some reason.
That was all he could say, and he thought of how meaningless that phrase was. "Passed away" as if to make it better and less horrific, as if to indicate he had gone somewhere else rather than ceasing to exist. What was the point? Why couldn't he just say "died?"
"Yeah well, tell him to shove off. You know why I'm here." John's tone turned serious "It's a crime scene."
They kiss, and Sherlock's hand magically manages to place his tea on the counter as he melts into John's lips. He moans softly, he loves it when John tilts his head a bit. It makes the kiss is deeper and even sweeter.
Susan started screaming in horror. John got up and was out of the door in the time it took everyone to comprehend what was happening. Sherlock followed immediately. Once they were outside, they went around the house to the dining room window, but there was no one there.
They fall silent for a bit, sipping on their drinks. Soft music fills the big hall, and some people head to the dance floor.
Sherlock looked everywhere except for the corner where John sat. He took the first opportunity to follow Molly into the kitchen. It seemed that no matter where he turned, he couldn't escape the wounded gaze. He wanted to talk to John, apologize, soothe, but he didn't know how.
"You know, I was wrong to tell my boys to get me a toe. I should have asked for that sharp tongue of yours to be cut off, pretty boy"
"Let's get back. I'm scared." Susan finally spoke. Her face was pale and there were tears in her eyes.
"Alright then." Rupert said calmly. "If I had Lidiya's body, then how the hell did we find it in the woods? I was right behind you, I could not have had the time to put the body there, go back and then follow you. And if I had carried her body, you would have seen it of course"
You have a surgery tomorrow; Mr. Lestrade. It's not major, but you're anxious. You have been carrying his file around all day." He pointed at the folder under John's left arm which said Lestrade on the front, and continued "It's got coffee stains on the edge there. You've been reading it and going over the procedure in your head since morning. You're questioning yourself. Something happened earlier at work that made you second guess everything"
The moment he reached the door, he could hear the inmates successfully breaking in the room he just left, but as expected, the old door did not budge no matter how much he tried to open it.
"To fall to Earth. You take the plunge, the tumble, the dive… You jump off a bridge, leap out a window. You just make up your mind to do it and you do it"
"I would appreciate it if you didn't move. No need to wake him up." He nodded at Sherlock "This is more about you, really."
"Beeeeeeeep" the heart monitor squeaked as the man's soul seeped out of his body slowly and gently. Sherlock waited patiently by his side, wishing he could make it easier, faster. "Kill the alarm!" the surgeon bending over the man shouted, his voice laced with a hint of hysteria, and Sherlock looked at him for the first time. Deep blue eyes framed by surgeon cap and mask moved frantically over the body laid down on the table.  The indigo eyes filled with healer's concern and focus startled Sherlock, and he couldn't resist. He strained his senses and listened to the doctor's rushed thoughts as he worked.
"When John arrived, he walked in on you while changing. What he actually saw but couldn't remember was you without the fat suit. Proof that you were not overweight at all. John didn't piece it together then, but you couldn't risk it, what if he remembered later? It was a loose end in need of tying up, so you decided to commit two murders instead of one. Your first attempt in the woods was a failure, and you were beginning to panic that John would be leaving before you could get rid of him, so you cut the phone lines and then the bridge."
"Oh, you're here" Sherlock said with a breathy voice as he let go of John's mouth, and John just looked at Greg, his eyes dark with lust.
It was the same man, the same huge black cape and bandaged face, but this time, he had an axe in his hand and was preparing to attack.
"Just listen to what he has to say, alright?" Greg's tone was pleading "He is not delusional, he just needs help. If this really turns out to be just him seeing things then you're the only one who can convince him." he said as he pulled over by a small house that looks as if it had been recently renovated.
The man's face broke into the most beautiful smile John had ever seen. It was like a flood of light, blindingly gorgeous, and John smiled back.
"I'm one of the bad guys, remember?" Sherlock answered with a smile as they left the room and headed for the visitation section. The electricity was out, which could only mean that the police was surrounding the facility and attempting to strip the prisoners of their defenses.
"Brilliant" John could not help saying each time Sherlock made another of his deductions, and Sherlock immediately blushed and returned the compliment with a look of absolute adoration.
"Go ahead" Sherlock smiled as he knew the best part of the case was about to be revealed. "Tell us why you can't possibly be him. You have proof, don't you? Go ahead, say it."
Later at home, John was changing when his eyes fell on his badge. He gawked at it for a few seconds then smiled. It said J. Watson, not John Watson.
At Mr. Lestrade's room, Sherlock stood unseen, watching John remove a tube from the man's mouth and giving instructions to the nurse. Lestrade coughed weakly.
For a moment, Sherlock did not speak, he felt caught in the electric blue gaze, his eyes unconsciously fell to the parted lips where small huffs of breath were forming tiny clouds of fog in the cold air. How very distracting.
"I got news for you, Sherlock, 'trust me' means absolutely zero inside these walls. The only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it."
"Oh, I'm okay, John. In fact, I'm more than okay. I now know who killed Lidiya and tried to kill you three times."
"So was either of you able to get a look at that psycho when he attacked you?" Max asked, interrupting their hushed conversation.
John had been staying with him since he had been discharged from the hospital. It had taken a lot of sulking to convince him to stay at Baker Street at least until he got better, but Sherlock was eventually victorious.
Dinner was brief and everyone talked amicably. They laughed as they told embarrassing stories about each other from their days at uni.
John felt his jaw clenching, adrenaline pumping in his system. He looked at Sherlock, frantically trying to communicate, trying to come up with a plan.
This time, they both start laughing, and when they stop, they find the man standing right in front of them. John wonders if he really should recite Hail Mary.
"This is Susan. She's our talented actress" Bill pointed at the prettier of the two women, she was blonde and had piercing green eyes. Wedding band mark on her finger, recent, Sherlock noted.
"But I don't want to do this anymore, can't do this anymore." John whispers as if every word is costing him so much.
"Greg Lestrade. Glutton, hedonist, former celestial body, and recent addition to the human race" he said with a proud grin.
"I warned you Sherlock, don't get involved" Mycroft said. Sherlock didn't answer, but kept staring at the canvas of twinkling buildings and streets spread underneath them.
your work right now, so consider yourself married to me until this case is closed." Almost immediately, he regretted the poor attempt at humor. Alright, change of topics… Go!
He packed his things and got out of the break room. Striding to the exit, he noticed a tall dark figure at the end of the hallway, right by Greg Lestrade's room. No patient could possibly be out roaming the hallways at this hour, and it certainly did not look like a staff member either. John came closer to take a better look at the man who had his back turned to him.
More and more functions shut down as John worked his flies and shoved his hand down his pants greedily. He was reduced to one single feeling… one utter pleasure. John stroking him and kissing his neck while he supported most of his limp weight.
"Don't worry. Johnny doesn't like her. Obviously." He looked smug as he said that, but the pain in Sherlock's heart became just a bit less excruciating at his words.
"Okay lads, you'll have to go upstairs and see which room is left for you to stay in. Everyone else arrived before you and called dibs, so I suspect you got the smallest one."
"You know, I've never really shared with anyone who you are or what you do. I mean, Anderson and Donovan obviously know by now, but I never told any other… colleagues"
Sherlock felt an odd twinge at the faith this man was obviously putting in him. Why did he care what this stranger thought of him anyway? He quickly wore his usual cold expression and slipped into his element.
John climbed into the tub slowly, straddling Sherlock's thighs, and finally, he was kissing him again, hands buried in his hair, pulling gently, and making Sherlock squirm.
"He does look like that, doesn't he?" He has this habit of turning his face away when he laughs and John adores it.
"Alright. Why don't you come with me so we can look at these cuts and then we'll see about Dr. Watson, hmm?"
"Never better" Lestrade answered, his cough turning into a gruff laugh. John laughed too, said something to the nurse and they both left the room
"I do not pout! And I am certainly not adorable!" Sherlock objects indignantly, "Besides, you can't deduce my face expressions based on the sounds of doors opening and closing."
He gestured with his hand, imitating the shape of a gun barrel with his finger and pointing it in an angle that was consistent with the blood splashed behind the victim.
He chained the bike outside Bart's and walked in. After changing quickly into his scrubs. He headed to the OR and was quickly handed a file and steered to look at an x-ray.
"God, this is the solar system thing all over again isn’t it? Just enjoy the view. Look, isn't it amazing?" he gestured at their surroundings.
He jumps a little when he feels warm fingers tickling his open palm. "Are you alright?" John says as he traces his fingertips along prominent veins on the back of Sherlock's hand, making him shiver at the soothing touch. He nods slowly, watching John's soft movement up and down his hand.
"Oh, God forbid." John is still grinning. He stares at his tea for a moment, evidently thinking up a plan to exploit the situation, before he speaks again.
What were the odds, really? But John was driven by complete and utter desperation. He could not resist it, he was literally sick with yearning. A constant fever was ever aflame in his heart, and a shiver ran through him insistently. He wasn't even denying it anymore, he had met the love of his life, and he had to see him again.
"It didn't give way." Sherlock said, pointing at the two pillars on either side. "Look at the marks. Someone cut the ropes off with something sharp… like an axe."
"It's alright John, I saw the way you and Sholto were looking at each other. This isn't serious anyway. It was just a bit of fun… a little game." He says even as he feels his heart breaking with every word. He fights to keep his expression cold and unaffected.
"This my Molly" He said, uttering the name with reverence "When I took the plunge, I couldn't get a job… No past, no training, No I.D. But she didn't care, she stayed with me, supported me, helped me catch up on education and whatnot. And now I'm a bloody police inspector, do you believe it?"
"I keep forgetting how much you still haven't tried" John said while opening the bag and taking out the fruit "and I wanted you to try it"
What's more, some of them were outrageously horrid, even more so than John's real middle name. Sherlock must have deduced it was a stupid name, based on his absolute refusal to share it.
Oh, this must be what pain feels like. Sherlock's eyes remained closed as he analyzed the different sensations. Sharp nails dug into his right arm and side. He suspected it was because he had been lying on them. There was more. His head felt like it was too full and too hollow at the same time, a dull thud of ache played an agonizing rhythm through his skull,
"Sherlock, what happened" John was now supporting his full weight and they were both sliding to the floor. Sherlock's eyes were closed, but a soft smile was making the beautiful face look even more heart-breaking.
He was silent for a moment as he took another bite "You wake up all smelly, and aching from head to toe and hungrier than you've ever been, only you have no idea what hunger is or any of that stuff... so it's all really confusing and painful, but very… very good"
"Like," John gets even closer, his breath a warm huff on Sherlock's cheek "When I hear the front door open and close, but don't hear anyone going up the stairs or entering Mrs. Hudson's flat, I deduce that a certain neighbor of mine is lingering outside with an adorable pout on his face."
"Yes, but what happened? Why didn't he just run?" Sherlock said as he took in his surroundings, searching for a detail that could explain, or kick start his trail of thought.
Sherlock looked around him in desperation, his eyes fell on the computer sitting on the desk in front of the receptionist, and reached for the colorful wires,
"Wish Amy was here with us. She would have loved this." Bill said, his eyes twinkling with sudden unshed tears.
"But I have a friend, he's a police detective. And… for the past two years or so he's been obsessed with a string of deaths."
Eventually, John gave up and told him he could come along as long as he stayed behind him. Fortunately, His Highness conceded.
This is all stolen from an episode of Case Closed. Though when I watched it in my language it was simply called Detective Conan, and yes that's a reference to ACD, as this brilliant anime is inspired by him.
Somehow, everything stays the same afterwards. Sherlock still breaks into John's flat and goes through his things and eats all his food. They still watch crap telly upstairs at 221B and have tea and talk about Sherlock's interesting clients. But every once in a while, Sherlock gets that look in his eyes, stares at John's chest and hands and licks his lips, and they just end up in bed, rutting and moaning and driving each other insane with pleasure.
"Thanks" He gave her a smile, feeling guilty for having been so edgy with her on top of everything else. Sarah did not deserve this.
"All of them had similar photos! He said even as he started striding towards the wall, his body acting of its own accord. He took the frame off the wall, and pointed at the tiny signature in the corner of the picture.
He opened his eyes and realized the head Sherlock's cock was poking out of his underwear, already wet and slippery, and without thinking he started kissing it slowly.
He turns to look at whoever interrupted and his heart skips a beat. Platinum blonde hair, angular nose, square jaw, clear blue eyes. A rush of memories floods his brain and he forgets how to speak for a moment. The newcomer keeps smiling pleasantly and looking between him and Sherlock.
Snippets of two different worlds flashed before his eyes, he didn't know which one was real. They were both equally terrifying.
"I don't know, we were just about to head back to the house because of the rain when he showed up. I thought it was a prank or something."
Following the source of the voice, he found himself in a clearing. He blinked rain out of his eyes to see John and Susan facing a man.
Sherlock was too befuddled to say anything, and suddenly, Greg's eyes lit up with a mixture of amusement and recognition.
"Do you think this one will make a mistake?" John asked, the look he gave Sherlock was startling, it was a mixture of fascination and barely suppressed hope. But there was something else in the navy blue eyes… a hunger for adrenaline, for danger.
For a moment, Sherlock is tempted to go back there, but then he remembers the fresh fingers waiting for him in his fridge.
"What is about me?" John asked just as he felt Sherlock shift in his arms, his head was resting on John's right arm and his face was tucked under his chin, but he started moving back, still too groggy to understand what was going on. Hope moved the gun slowly to point it at Sherlock, and John's heart sank.
"My patient's wife. She wants me to reassure her. Tell here everything is going to be just fine, and that I have every confidence... and I don't. After all this time, and after all this work, I suddenly have this feeling that none of this is in my hands. Nothing. And if it isn't, what do I do with that?"
When he opens his eyes, John is straddling him. He looks predatory as his eyes survey Sherlock's body sprawled on the bed. His hand, now coated with Sherlock's semen, strokes his own cock desperately. Sherlock wants to help, touch, anything, but John is already groaning on top of him, his semen shoots long creamy stripes on Sherlock's heaving chest.
He had fallen asleep in a chair by Sherlock's bed after tending to a severed toe. Officers claimed he had sustained it by stepping on a sharp tool. Rubbish.
When their lips parted, John realized he wasn't breathing, and he let out a shuddering breath, eyes still closed, and hand still cupped around pale perfection.
Sherlock hopes his face doesn't betray the stab of pain he feels at the sound of John's name. He blinks, trying to collect himself.
"Yes I can." With every word, John is moving closer, his eyes repeatedly dropping to stare at Sherlock's mouth as he licks his lips. "You're home early, you're supposed to be at Bart's playing tea time with cadavers, yet you've come home at this hour, something must have happened. Also, you've practically slammed the door shut behind you. I'm surprised Mrs. Hudson didn't come out to scold you. She must have had her 'soothing herbal tea' already. Oh, see? Another deduction. I'm on fire today."
Greg’s eyes went wide and he swallowed as he understood. He didn’t argue, but got up from his chair, feeling beads of sweat running across his forehead. He stopped by the foot of the bed staring at Sherlock, who had his legs open and his hand moving, stroking feather-light on his cock.
"I don't believe you" he glared, eyes now twinkling with unshed tears. "Do you feel that?" he added.
Back at the hospital, John took Sherlock to the laboratory. It was a spacious, spotless room with bright white lights. Cupboards covered most of the walls, and a variety of equipment sat on the white tabletops.
Everything that happened afterwards was a blur. Sherlock's most basic instincts took charge. He lifted a foot and shoved John away to the other side of the bed, simultaneously pushing himself back on the floor. The murderer's axe wedged itself right in the spot where John's head was a second ago.
Thanks to everyone who left comments and kudos, and if anyone has a comment, feedback, or just wants to say hi, please go ahead, I love hearing from you guys :)
They sat in awkward silence for moments, but Molly was not having any of that. She was jumping about, trying to entertain everyone.
"Eating is boring" Sherlock said with a pout, reaching again for John and wrapping his arms around him.
Once has was finished with the procedure, he stepped out of the OR and into the adjoining empty room. He sat and tried to take long deep breaths as he stared at the floor.
‘Sorry, but I am not really interested in religion or turbulence theories.’ He realises his words might sound a bit rude. ‘There are things one appreciates without caring about them in general. What is the price?’
“I wanted to come to Venice, this much is true. And I wanted to come to Venice because I came here on my honeymoon. No, Sherlock, stop it, you promised. But it was not to walk down memory lane, it was to - and this may sound silly to you - to exchange my memories for something better. I wanted to be able to think of Venice without being reminded of a marriage that never really was and you nearly dying and leaving forever and … all that.“ He pressed his lips together, gathering courage for the last difficult hurdle. “I wanted to come here with you.“
This is not what I expected. He stole my part. I am supposed to be the rational one, the analytical one. So why does he not protest, does not even try to contradict me? The thought is ridiculous and yet I cannot shake it off.
But he needs more, he needs a trigger, something as disgusting as the man himself. Imagine Magnussen humiliating John, hurting him, John turning to Sherlock for help because he must have a plan, he always has. Why did John choose him of all people to trust?
Mycroft shrugs. ”Or he sent her away. Ten minutes after she had left the house, Ms Harry Watson and another woman visited John and have not left since then.“
But John was not finished yet. “You never had a case here. But there are other reasons for going to Venice."
I realise I never told John that I love him. I want to do it now. But it would be cruel. I remember all the cruel things I did to him - frightening him to death in that lab, dying in front of his eyes, shutting him off again and again. This time I will not be cruel. A lie of omission as a last act of love.
John laughed. “How could I disagree with my best man during his speech?“ He dug his hands into his pockets and walked on, slowly, head thoughtfully bent. “I never told you but it was beautiful. The speech, you know. The beginning was … um … very much you, but then … all the things you said. I never really thanked you for that and I’d like to do that now.“
Some animals are most dangerous when they are in danger of losing their young. Or when they are wounded and fight back for their lives. Mary is like a wounded animal that has lost its young. She will not just give up and board a plane to South America to start a new life. First she will get her revenge if nothing else.
He opens a drawer in the intricately decorated filing cabinet and takes out his book of lists. He likes making lists. He has one about the shortcomings of his own mother and he also kept the one of people who hated Mary – he really should have seen it coming – and now he looks at a new one, captioned:
“Apart from the cheque? Well, if you could pull a few strings with Maldini’s evening wear rental …“ said John looking from himself to Sherlock. Their dinner suits definitely were worse for wear.
Apart from that fateful dinner at the Landmark restaurant which he preferred to bury in the deepest recesses of his mind and the occasion of his own wedding (well, put that on the best-forgotten-list as well) John had never seen Sherlock in evening dress.
He remembers the dungeon-like padded cell and chained Moriarty - how very Victorian - how much he hated Moriarty drooling over him, the horrible stench of his breath, his flamingly insane eyes but, mad as he may be, it was he who gave Sherlock what he needed – an incentive to live.
But this - not wanting to delete things he needed. It was not the words, those were quite typical of Sherlock, it was the way he had spoken them. As if he was not talking about accumulated random knowledge that might come in handy one day but about something else.
The doctors at the hospital told me it was going to be hard. John told me as well. And although my knowledge of the human body told me the same, I did not realise how slow my progress would be. Every step is an effort, the way from my bedroom to the living-room or from the sofa to the kitchen a river to be crossed, a mountain to be conquered.
John stood rooted in the spot while Sherlock was walking away. Something was off since they had got here. He remembered when in the Caffè Florian Sherlock had mentioned romance, being his old distant and cool self. Romance, but not for me, was the implication. And John had felt rejected, which was ridiculous, but he could not shake off the feeling.
I move liked an old man, supporting myself on walls and shelves and the backrests of both our chairs. In the beginning the pain is so intense that I have to force myself to breathe regularly when I am moving. I can feel John‘s eyes on me wherever I go and it makes me self-conscious.
While Sherlock can only provide one of these. Well... maybe two. But this is simply not on. Not now, not ever.
‘I see. These scars were probably caused by violent beatings and not treated appropriately or in time. But surely you can see that for yourself. So at some point Mr Holmes has been the victim of one or several attacks. The fact that the scars are only on his back indicates that he had been constrained in some way which, in turn, indicates that he must have been a prisoner. Probably not in a British prison since to my knowledge torture has been forbidden for quite some time.’
But then Sherlock had been quite gruff this morning, and John would not look a gift horse in the mouth.
After that everything starts to blur, a jumble of images floating through his brain, John and Mary and the baby in a lovely, pink bunny suit and they all take a walk like a happy family, Mr and Mrs Psychopath and their high-functioning uncle dragged along by an over-eager dog into a crowded market and –
He swallows, pacing frantically in front of the windows. This is going to be hard, very hard, even harder than the fucking speech and that was a tough one. But he could always rely on his mind, on his big fucking brain, and he will put it to good use. He remembers half-forgotten deductions about different scenarios, how he used to play through various possibilities until he found the only one that made sense. This is what he is going to do.
No! Something is wrong. Sherlock slaps his cheeks to rouse himself from his self-pitying trance. Think, he tells himself frantically, just think!
When we are alone, I try to read John‘s face but the strange look from before has disappeared. As has the frown. He seems softer and a bit older, more John. He sits in the chair beside my bed, supporting his elbows on his knees, his chin on his folded hands.
”When did you last change your clothes? I never knew you to be careless with your personal hygiene. John will not be happy.“
“No, John, this is not thrilling or exciting or scary or whatever you want to call this silly story. They are both clearly wrecked with guilt because they did not save the little girl from drowning. So they go on holiday to a seemingly romantic place that is full of old blind women and disgusting dwarfs dressed up as Little Red Riding Hood wielding knives? Really, John??"
“You did not even wait until we were introduced to Mrs Bianchi. You could have used the opportunity to leave the house undetected. Not for long, though, since the authorities would have caught you soon as all the bridges and ports are under observation …"
‘Sherlock, I just realised we only hugged once. Once in all these years. Which is weird because best friends hug each other all the time. It is something you do, when saying hello after some time or to congratulate someone on a new baby or a new job or when your team has scored a goal or to comfort your mate when life is shit. But with us, it was different.  And you know what? It was me who did not want it, who shied away from it. Never you. You kept touching my arm to alert me to things, had me dig your phone out of your breast pocket or leant closely over my shoulder to have a look at the laptop. You were the one who took my hand when we were running away from the police. It was always me who tried to keep his distance. Because I was afraid of people talking, of maybe feeling something I did not want to feel, of giving myself away’- he laughs sadly- ‘you know, I enjoy sex. Very much and as often as possible. But intimacy, well that’s another matter.’
Sherlock realised he was still wearing the bloody shirt. He took it off, balled it and threw it into a corner. He might have taken it as a souvenir, no need for that now.
John measures her with his eyes. ”With Sherlock you can call a spade a spade. No, you should. You even have to. He does not suffer mollycoddling and lying doctors. I am speaking from experience.“
“Come on, an old guy ogling a beautiful boy on a beach? And no police around to get him arrested? What kind of world is this? You mean then it was fine to ogle beautiful boys as long as you died afterwards? What a load of rubbish. Granted, the music is acceptable, but as for the rest … John, did we really give the Doctor Who set back to Molly?“
They are driving into a tunnel, Sherlock and John in the front seats, Mary in the back, moaning, telling him to go faster, then a cry, ‘Stop! At once! I cannot … fuck … my water just broke …’
How probable does it seem that a woman like Mary Morstan chose to become a nurse and accidentally got a job in the same surgery as John Watson, friend and flatmate of a deceased consulting detective – the only one in the world (that’s me, by the way, hello) younger brother of the most powerful man in Britain, only antagonist of Jim Moriarty, the most dangerous spider in the web? According to his estimate the probability is virtually zero.
Jim Moriarty. In his flat. Talking the usual sexualised rubbish and blowing his brains out just like he did on the roof, presenting a crater-like hole in the back of his head, still very much alive …
It is like old times and then it is not. John insisted on moving back in, he has re-occupied his chair, his dressing gown is hanging from a peg in the bathroom, his medical journals are strewn over the all-purpose table where we usually sit and eat or work on our computers.
He eats the dripping melon contemplatively over the sink, enjoying the sweet, slightly watery taste. Afterwards he washes his hands, dries them on a towel.
This is not Sherlock but a statue, attached to monitors and IV lines disappearing into various parts of his body.
“No“, he gasped, “thank you. I’m fine. Just a bit dusty in here. So you were talking about the films …“
Sherlock stared icily down at the man who was about a head smaller than himself. “We are here on a business trip. This is my assistant. We do not require a romantic view of the canal."
John does not pay attention to the scowling grandmother, walks faster, concentrating on his hatred and nothing else.
“Stop it, Sherlock, stop it.“ Lestrade opened the door of an empty office and shoved Sherlock inside before closing the door behind him. “I’m an open-minded man, I really am, but still I do not want to hear anything of what Mary and John or you and John are doing in front of the television. This is getting a bit too kinky for me.“
He swallows. Before the fall – he still finds it hard to think of that time, to dress the unspeakable in simple words – he had seen Sherlock’s naked back more than once. No scars then. No new injuries since his return last November, he would have noticed. So it must have happened in between, during what John called, as he now shamefully remembers, ‘playing hide and seek’.
Sherlock finds himself strangely restless. He takes a shower, puts on shorts and a T-shirt and starts walking to the end of the garden. There is a little gate in the wall behind which a path leads to a small forest of oaks. It is already hot but the trees provide at least some shade. The gravel crunches beneath his feet and he is walking like an automaton, almost as if driven by a force he cannot resist. He knows where he is going and does not at the same time.
‘Oh, the van Gogh, yes.’ He clears his throat. ‘I am not very familiar with his work. Not at all, to be honest. I … this just reminded me of someone, something.’ To his eternal embarrassment he finds himself blushing.
Sherlock hated this. He hated being indebted to Mycroft which is why he had postponed the request for two days. But it was no use, he had to bring himself to write the words even if it killed him.
Yes, it had been wrong to come Venice, to try and give John what he wanted. He had thought he could bear it after he had born the wedding and all that came afterwards but now he realised that there were things even a high-functioning sociopath could not bear.
He looks into the fridge, sees the foil-covered baking dish and closes the door again. He walks from the kitchen through into the living room, upstairs into the bedroom, feeling restless and agitated.
In the afternoon Sherlock walks the short distance into town, mainly to distract himself but also to buy some food. Now that he is living alone again he puts more attention to feeding himself because he must. It seems he cannot shed his inner Doctor.
Nothing more. No invitation to have a look at her, no word about what is going to happen next. I try to be happy that all went well before I realise I snapped my bow in half with trying.
I smile back. ”Very much so.“ I close my eyes to indicate that I am tired which is not exactly an act.
Suddenly they were facing each other and John squeezed Sherlock’s upper arm. It was a sort of manly gesture, something mates did, but then it was not. Because John never touched him like that.
A pale, slightly bluish moon is shining through the window, bathing the picture in an eerie light. So very different from the golden sunlight. For a second he allows himself to imagine this light on John’s body.
And then they suddenly stood in the street that was dark and deserted, Sherlock with blood on his white dress shirt, John in a dirty dinner suit.
This is not a case although I wish it was. I can solve cases. I cannot solve what John Watson is doing to my heart.
‘I touched you when you came back, right? Throwing you to the floor, hands around your throat, my fist in your face, my head … giving you what I thought you deserved.’ The bitterness is threatening to engulf him. ‘You know what you deserved? A punch to the face, and then a hug. But you only got one half of the deal.’
He awakes on the plane. Mary is there. Mary is pregnant. Why was she not pregnant in his Victorian escapade? He made a mistake there, surely, because she is pregnant now and he deduced it himself, he is not stupid, all the signs were there – as was the sign of the liar and yet he did not observe as he should have done.
Fuck, I think. So everything I did, the foolhardy escape from hospital, the brilliant performance in this very room, all for nothing.
The next day they set out to have a look at the house of Mrs Laura Bianchi, the rich ex-wife of a Roman property mogul who had bought a beautiful palazzo near the Rialto bridge. The house in the calle del Paradiso seemed a bit understated but Sherlock told John that behind the inconspicuous exterior the rooms were exquisitely furnished with antiques and the finest tapestries in Venice.
What if Magnussen was not so very much unlike himself? What if he had a mind palace of his own? Actually, this would be clever because if there were no archives or vaults in which he stores his knowledge, nobody would ever be able to steal it. His assets hidden safely in his own brain. Clever.
He coughs and rubs his neck the moment I loosen my grip. I envy him his calm. He was always far more composed, even as a teenager he had a certain majestic pompousness that could not be shaken. But when he looks up, there is something in his eyes I had not expected to see there.
The moment Magnussen opens the doors and sits down in the chair I know. Long before John. He looks at me with an icy nonchalance and I relive some moments of the past.
This time kissing is not enough and we end up sweaty and half naked on the sofa, not caring for Mrs Hudson or Mycroft or anyone else‘s sudden appearance.
John nods, lost for words. Sherlock being shot is bad enough. But to learn that he has been the subject of violence, probably torture, is unbearable.
He heard steps in the hallway. Someone slowly approaching, stopping in front of the door to his right. John.
A sticking plaster was enough, no stitches required. Mr Blaine had been taken away by the police and Sherlock had explained to Mrs Bianchi the danger she had been in. After some furious shouting, accompanied by some highly imaginative Italian swearwords, she was reduced to tears and issued an impressive cheque.
John took his time, not sure about what to do next. He could not bear the thought of going to sleep with this - whatever it was - standing between them. The whole Venice thing had been a mistake, John’s clumsy attempt at showing Sherlock what he felt and what he was unable to express with words.
Then he is back in the past, in his Victorian sitting room, his mind mirror of 221B. He conjures up John to pull him from his drugged slumber on the floor. John who is disappointed and angry, demanding Sherlock to be better than he truly is. Painting him in a shining light for his magazine stories.
He does not admit to himself what it is he is searching for. But he is sure he will recognise it the moment he finds it.
So much had happened since then and not once had John found the courage to tell Sherlock how he truly felt. The funny thing was that Sherlock who had always been so distant, who thought caring was a weakness, who treasured his intellect above all other things, had been the one to strip himself naked in front of a whole wedding party, laying bare his emotions as he had never done before.
‘I am quite sure that Sherlock would prefer to see you when he wakes up. The hospital keeps me constantly informed about his condition, so no worry there. But from past experience I can tell you that Sherlock usually does not take well to seeing me when coming out of a –’
What now? He had chosen those films with care, all of them very different, to draw Sherlock out, to make him curious. John was not good with words, especially not where emotions were concerned. If he had, maybe his life would have been different, most of all the last five years.
Gemma listens to him, interrupting him not even once, sitting there quietly, hands folded in her lap, head slightly tilted to the right.
“John, please. Can’t we just enjoy the atmosphere for a moment? I’ve never been to Venice before and it’s quite nice. That is apart from the tourists and the pigeons and the singing gondolieri."
John took a tissue out of his pocket and pressed it against Sherlock’s temple. Then he put his lips to Sherlock’s ear and hissed: “Why the fuck did we have to come here for that?“ He nodded towards Mr Blaine. “You could have solved this case lying in your bathtub. Or in your sleep. This is ridiculous. No more than a 0.5 on your scale."
A female doctor is coming in, the Eternity woman. Nice change for a fragrance, Claire de la Lune would make me vomit.
It had been obvious that John wanted to re-visit the city but it would have felt awkward for them to stay in the same place where he and Mary had had their … sex holiday.
I try to remember what happened. The mist slowly brightens. Me pulling out the CVC and the other needles, somehow getting into my trousers and coat (they disposed of the bloodied shirt), dragging the I.V. pole to the exit and hailing myself a cab. Fast forward. Baker Street, getting into a shirt with Billy Wiggins‘ help, ordering him to return John‘s chair, positioning the perfume bottle on the side table, then setting up the projector in Leinster Gardens, waiting.
John nods his head. Remembers all the things he left out, he could not tell her – dancing in the darkened living room, putting his hand on Sherlock’s knee in front of the fireplace, hugging him for the first time in his life, feeling the tension in Sherlock’s body –
Sherlock manages a nod. His brain is still fuzzy; he is floating on a cloud of morphine but he is awake. His mouth is still terribly dry but he has to try.
“Sherlock, you are hurt.“ John got off Mr Blaine’s back who desperately struggled to force some air into his lungs.
‘It is the view from his window in the asylum here in Saint-Rémy. He painted it in June 1889.’ She takes the picture from the window, leaning it against a chair. ‘It is not what his eyes saw when he was looking out. This is a village of his mind. But to him the sky might have looked like that. There are dozens of interpretations, people talking about the religious aspects or the fact that it seems to precipitate something called the Kolmogorov theory of turbulences but …’
Sherlock stared at him incredulously and John felt himself reminded of that day in the kitchen in 221B when he had told Sherlock he was his best friend.
Gemma sends the nurse away. ‘I do not care if you have been pouring out your heart to him or read from the telephone directory,’ she smiles. ‘Whatever you did, you got a reaction. And even if he reacted to something inside himself instead of your words, this is a good sign.’ She looks over to the heart monitor. The heart rate is slowing down.
He started walking, not sure where he had to go but soon the streets got livelier and he looked for signs that could lead him back to the hotel. He found his way to the Piazza San Marco with the brightly-lit Caffè Florian and from there to the Ponte Accademia and their hotel.
There must be something there, this is not the whole story, Mary and Moriarty and Mycroft, there must be a link, a connection which he must find, and then everything will make sense.
Then there is a sound, a voice. He knows that voice, he could pick it out of a hundred, a thousand, of all other voices.
He holds the cup to my lips while I drink gratefully. The taste in my mouth slightly improves and I can finally speak.
The heart monitor is beeping, the ECG spiking, Sherlock’s hands suddenly twitching, his head rolling from left to right.
But there is another danger to John. Mary threatened to kill everyone who came between her and the man she loves, who made John stop loving her. So what if John himself stops loving her?
He is gripping my upper arms and carefully turns me around until we face each other. ”Sherlock, what is all this about?“ His left hand cups my face, the thumb softly stroking my lips.
Her look is impenetrable but friendly. ‘May I offer you a cup of coffee? It is only my second day here and I am glad about every customer. Which does not mean you have to buy anything, no pressure.’
So is John, at least from a medical point of view. As long as there is no brain damage – and John really hopes there is not and actually Sherlock’s heart did not stop that long to suggest such an assumption – he should have woken up by now.
But what now? Magnussen still has a hold on her and danger to Mary means danger to John. Or is it not that simple?
Sherlock feels his control slipping, reality bleeding through, no, not 'real' reality but John is there and Mary and Mycroft, and the only thing that matters is the feeling, no, the certainty that there must be a connection between his brother and the woman known as Mary Morstan. Probably not her real name. Not fictitious either, the closer to reality, the better, so a name taken from a gravestone perhaps. He would not put it past her. Nice touch of old-fashioned spy dramas, flickering black and white images, accompanied by dramatic music.
He is not alone. He does not hear or see anything, there was nothing outside to create this impression and yet he knows. The air has changed. There is something intangible pulling him towards the living room. Something that has been there the night before, someone who has a key, given to him by another someone who fears his brother might be drowning in honey and lavender.
Molly stopped talking because she realised she was alone in the lab. That is, she and a box full of cupcakes.
John walks back to the hospital, wearing himself out in order to overcome his anger. He feels slightly dizzy, his head is pounding, he can fell sweat trickling down his back. His fingernails biting into the flesh.
A styrofoam cup with coffee is thrust in front of my nose. I look up. Mycroft‘s face is motionless, but he nods his head towards the door of John‘s room. ”They will let you in soon, Sherlock. He will be fine. It was touch and go but he will be fine.“
When he is finished, she leans back. ‘I see. So what you are telling me is this: Sherlock pretended to commit suicide and left London for two years in order to dismantle a criminal network. He came back and found his former life had irrevocably changed. You had moved out of the flat you shared, taken on a job in a surgery, and met a woman. You married this woman. Sherlock was your best man and did everything in order to ensure you had an unforgettable wedding. On the evening of the same wedding, he left without saying a word. You did not see him for the weeks that followed, until you found him in a drug den, on the morning of the day he was shot in the chest during an investigation. Is this the gist of it?’
There are voices, light shining into his eyes, a sort of hospital and John is there, Mycroft, Mary hovering in the background. But no, this is not right, he has things to do, he is not finished yet. Then everything is getting blurry again, a car, a cemetery with old trees and leaning gravestones.
For a moment Sherlock allows himself the impossible dream of John coming to save him, of John throwing Moriarty over the edge and Sherlock throwing away his stupid hat – the How People Want To See Him hat - and jumps into a new life.
This is where Lestrade became really, really curious. “What … films, Sherlock?“ God, the poor guy, he thought, having to cope with Sherlock’s death and return, then with Sherlock getting shot and John moving back to look after him while he was on the mend, then with Mary’s sudden disappearance some months after Christmas. He had always suspected more than a failed marriage but neither Sherlock nor John had ever spoken about it. And now John, the poor sex-starved bastard, was watching … films.
The house stands on the outskirts of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. As a boy, he used to accompany Grandmère to the market where she chose the finest fruit and vegetables, the tastiest cheese and juiciest meat and never ever let herself be outsmarted by the traders. As far as he knows, she never set foot into a supermarket in all her life.
Sherlock’s eyes are open. Slightly unfocussed. Lips still moving. John carefully places an ice cube against Sherlock’s lips. He hesitantly licks the cube, water slowly dripping down over his chin and John’s fingers. One minute, two minutes. Then he turns his head away.
‘What is happening? His fever is not that high.’ John is looking at Gemma Wood,the consultant, mid-thirties, red hair, pageboy hairstyle, competent and nice, pointing at the heart monitor with its spiking line.
Before John could say anything, Sherlock produced two gilt-edged invitation cards for Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr John H Watson - Sinful swing nights in Venice - RSVP. Host: Mrs Laura Bianchi, Palazzo Minuti, Calle del Paradiso, Venezia.
John is holding Sherlock’s right hand that has no venous access with both of his own, maybe even clutching it but he cannot let go, he is afraid. He is a doctor and should be able to keep his professional distance but this is Sherlock.
Stuck in a clean little cell with nothing to stimulate his brain, not even drugs – although he might give it a try, tell the warden with the Financial Times in his pocket about that big upcoming Government contract for this IT company in exchange for a little favour –
Maybe this is something Sherlock might say about himself. He feels like a failure because he could not protect John. He let himself by led astray by … what? Feelings? False hopes? The idea that for once in his life he could get the thing he really wanted?
The attic is dusty and cluttered, full of  useless stuff they just put up there in the hope it would magically disappear. Did not work, though. They have been living together for less than two years and yet they have accumulated so much junk.
Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John went to the reception, got his key and asked casually if Mr Holmes had returned.
A plane drones overhead, on its way to or from Marseilles airport. His throat tightens and he has to drink a glass of water to dispel the feeling.
"I should like to bury something precious in every place where I've been happy and then, when I was old and ugly and miserable, I could come back and dig it up and remember."
Well, this was over now. The receptionist watched them entering their names in the hotel register. “We are sorry, signor, double rooms are nicest, but you said …"
He gets up and starts pacing the cold room, hands in pockets, no noise from the outside, no horses' hooves on the cobbles, no cries of street vendors, no shrill whistles of the city’s policemen. Must be late at night then.
I watch him marching over to Mary, taking her hand and leading her to the waiting car. I am not sure what I am feeling. Relief. Gratitude (Mycroft being more brilliant than ever but I would rather bite off my tongue than tell him that). Heartache. Insecurity. Anger, this time directed at myself.
In the morning the picture is golden again. Sherlock pads into the kitchen, breaks off a piece of the
Looking into his suitcase he found that there was no clean shirt left. Just the purple t-shirt that had taken too many rounds in the tumble-dryer. He pulled it over his head. Bit tight around the chest, bit too short further down, but it would be sufficient to sleep in. Maybe the hotel could send someone to buy him a shirt before they went to the airport in the morning.
Sherlock did not like to think of those two weeks. God, he had been jealous! He had crouched in his chair and snapped at Mycroft when he dared bring up the subject of the “newly-weds“ so when Lady Smallwood turned to him he had grabbed the opportunity with both hands. A case to make him forget what the Watsons were doing and if he was able to spend some time in a drug den, all the better.
“Both, Mrs Hudson, that’s the beauty of it. By the way, how is the weather in Venice at this time of year?“
Suddenly I remember a quote I once read, no idea from where it came but it seems I put it in some far corner of my mind palace instead of deleting it completely. It is horribly sentimental and absolutely perfect.
John started to fill his suitcase methodically with rolled-up socks, folded T-shirts, a pair of jeans, pathetically self-ironed shirts and a baseball cap.
John let his head sink on the desk and buried his fingers in his hair. That is, until the new receptionist - tall, skinny, ginger, not an assassin - told him that Mr Birdwhistle had arrived for his flu jab.
John gasped when Sherlock opened the door, wearing his black dinner suit trousers and a very tight-fitting purple t-shirt John had never seen on him before. It made him look ten years younger and John suddenly felt very awkward.
He is so still. This is so very wrong. He needs to be like quicksilver, talking all the time, running around with his big coat billowing behind him, using his long, elegant hands to emphasise his deductions, letting his voice rumble deeply or smack his lip to stress the plosive at the end of a word.
I try to speak when he realises my difficulties and gets a plastic cup with a lid and straw. It reminds me of those coloured children‘s cups with cartoon animals on them you can buy in theme parks. Must be the morphine.
What he does mind is that he has been here for ten days. Ten days since Mary entered the plane with her daughter in her arms. Ten days since he told Mycroft he was going to Saint-Rémy. Ten days without a call or a text or any message from John. He had given himself two weeks before returning to London and starting to work again. By now he feels more like staying here the whole summer. Or even into autumn. Autumn is a lovely time in Southern France.
