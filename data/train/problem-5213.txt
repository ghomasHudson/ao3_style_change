"That's cool. Wish you'd let me in there sometimes." Sam said, truthfully.
"I'm good as well. Is-" Castiel hesitated only for a second, but Sam already knew what the question would be.
Dean smiled at him again. Castiel smiled back at the response written on Dean's face. "I want to know how you feel when I look at you."
Anticipating more pain, Dean clamped his eyes shut and tried to look away, "No, no, Cas."
Sam didn’t say another word until he stepped inside the room. Taking in the sight of his brother in the defensive position he was in, facing the wall and away from anyone who might approach, he quietly sat down on the bed where Dean’s legs were drawn up towards himself.  Dean’s tear-streaked face told him enough. He spoke softly and slowly. “Dean. Has something happened to Cas?”
He looked up from his laptop and cleared his throat before quietly saying, "Well, hey there. How was work?"
"Jesus, what is this, an intervention?Huh?" Dean asked, deflecting.
Sam asked where Cas was on the drive back, first thing. Dean dismissed Cas's sudden disappearance as more of his now frequently unreliable behavior. It wasn't a hard sell, though Sam did wonder at Dean's withdrawn mood change. Those were never easy to pin down with Dean though, as he was not the most forthcoming with his inner thoughts.
Just as the cassette he was listening to needed a flip (even in Heaven?)Dean was startled to find the seats next to him and behind him simultaneously occupied by his father in the passenger and his mother in the back. He had only seen them together once before and even that had been short lived. And here they were in what was once their car here for the sole purpose of talking to their son. They welcomed him to Heaven. They supported the decisions in his life. They reinforced how proud they are of him. They dared to broach the hard stuff. But they have lots of roads left to tread.
"No, Dean. It's difficult to answer how I am feeling because I often do not know what I feel when I am around you."
"I suppose he will." Castiel said. "Do you think it will bother him?"
Dean nodded, "That's a big part of it. Can't get too attached, someone will get hurt. And that's if something supernatural doesn't happen."
He was annoyed still, but less so, though he wasn't ready to give Castiel a pass.
Sam listened and then faced forward and sat for a minute, more satisfied now that Dean was slowly starting to open up. So when he asked the next question, there was no edge, no teasing, no judging. "Is this why you haven't had a real girlfriend before?"
Dean smiled at that. "Where have you been?" He asked, genuinely interested and not irritated.
He didn't know how long he curled up on Cas' bed, holding the pillow that smelled faintly of him to his chest. How could he do this? Even after all this time, their relationship ended like it began, and how it continuously played out in between: secrets revealed at the worst possible moment. Always given in a moment where course correction was not an option. He lay there, haunted and allowing himself to feel. Or was he forced to feel? Did it matter either way?
Not long after Dean woke up, he gently placed his left hand at the side of Cas's head. He let his thumb softly play with Castiel's sideburn, back and forth, until eventually Cas opened his eyes to meet Dean's.
"Cas..ooohh, ahhhh.." Dean moaned and grunted. He had endured so much pain at the hand of his best friend.
Meg and Sam looked around as they heard the sounds of the angry clash between Dean and Castiel inside.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Noting Castiel's coat around Dean's shoulders, "I will take leave of you. But not before conveying my sincere disbelief at your choices, Castiel.
Dean didn't respond, and Castiel noticed that Dean had tears watering his eyes. He kneeled down and touched Dean's cheek with his thumb when one fell. "Dean, you
Castiel stood facing Dean, who now stood to meet him face to face.
Meanwhile, Crowley continued to close in on Sam and Meg, assessing that it was Castiel who had been "poking" his boys.
Dean could only listen in awe as he looked over his shoulder at Castiel. Before Castiel could continue, Naomi was gone. Castiel looked back at Dean and he said,
Sam continued,"Cas, is this a new thing? Or have you always appeared in Dean's bedroom?"
Castiel followed Dean around the side of the house, where Dean thought they'd have a bit more privacy. Castiel asked, "Dean is there something wrong?" Dean immediately pulled Cas in an embrace and began to kiss him. When they parted, leaning their foreheads together, Dean said, "Been wantin' to do that all morning. Had to before you left."
After a moment of silence, Castiel moved his hand slightly, tentatively in the direction of Dean's. Dean boldly took Castiel's and quietly interlaced their fingers. This small simple connection was like fire for them both, especially for Castiel. "I don't know what it is I am feeling. You make me want to experience this world."
Dean smirked as he looked at the wide-eyed stare Cas was giving Bobby as he made to grab some bacon. Cas merely replied, after suddenly feeling less comfortable, "Your customary behavior will suffice, Bobby. I appreciate the effort you have made for this feast."
Castiel quickly frowned. "What makes you say that?"
Dean smirked. Cas continued, “And I always thought you would end up with one of those women you bedded.”
"Cas, how are ya, bud?" Dean asked approaching him.
"Well-" Sam cleared his throat, "That uh. It's somethin'"
"You want it? Go ahead and take it." Dean shouted at Castiel. He added, "But you'll have to kill me first. Come on you coward. Do it! Do it!"
Sam knew that he could now speak, and that he needed to choose his words carefully or Dean would draw inward again and be closed off. “He finally told you. I’m so glad that you have that Dean, that’s an amazing gift.”
Dean’s face flushed and he got up and left the bar saying, ”I’m goin for a walk. Later, Kev.” It’s not like he wouldn’t see him any time soon or that there was anywhere he had to be any longer.
A few days later, Castiel found himself sitting at lunch with Metatron. He had gone shopping for groceries as a means to try to appease Dean. Dean loves pie.
Dean frowned,”How long?”
As they continued to kiss and explore each other, dark clouds formed overhead. They didn’t stop kissing. Touching. Tasting. Dean lay his head on Cas’ chest. It wouldn’t be so bad, laying here forever. Consumed by a starving need and drenched in the pouring rain.
in fact, far from it."
Dean looked down, blushing lightly again. Apparently it wasn’t something he could withhold here in Heaven. People he cared about caught big events in his life and were watching some of the time. Someone saying the words “I love you.” to Dean marked a first in his experience. In life, he had certainly emphasized shallow flings and  quantity over deep commitment and quality. Though in his later years, he hadn’t done much of anything at all with anyone. Sometimes, you have to be a master of loving yourself, and Dean has been at least capable of being content. Up until he wasn’t.
"Good morning, Dean." Cas said, softly.
"I know you will." Sam said, and that was the end of that line of conversation.
Castiel replied, "How is it I look at you that's different than humans look at you?"
Dean cleared his throat, “Yeah, well, he ain’t mine.”
"Please don't think me too forward, I know we've only just met. But your reputation of ill-favor from up there does precede you. And don't think I'm judging you harshly for it,>
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Dean shyly responded, "Stay with us. With me."
"Sam, hello. Are you-alright?" Castiel began.
And after this, he had no doubt that he would utilize the rest of them.
"I still don't see why we can't just lay low, maybe sit this one out." Dean said in response to Sam's enthusiasm for connecting with the other hunters and throwing back some beers.
Dean smiled fondly at Cas as he said that.
"Dean. It is good to see you once again." Castiel said, in his dark foreboding tone that wasn't much fun.
Dean opened the top stairwell door and was gone. Sam continued pressing forward. Maybe another twenty or thirty minutes passed by, he couldn't be sure. But at some point,
When they pulled apart, their foreheads together, Dean said, "Don't leave me, Cas."
After helping Bobby clean up the table, Sam and Dean grabbed the few things they'd brought with them and headed to their car. After Sam got in, Dean looked over to Cas and said, "Hey, Cas, come on."
After a period of staring down at his hands playing with his beer bottle, he looked back up to find Jo gone, but Kevin Tran was in her place. He seemed to have prior knowledge of the conversation up to this point when he said, “One of the Angels looks upon you with such favor. I can read the light around you.. Shouldn’t be shocked it’d be you for him Dean. Just don’t screw it up by being you, yeah? ”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I'll do my best, Sammy." Dean said, not taking his eyes off the road ahead.
Castiel appeared at the top of the stairs leading into the library. Sam looked up, noting the calm yet uncertain demeanor the angel was portraying.
Sam and Dean circled back with Kevin so that they could attempt to complete the trials that were leaving Sam a shell, eating away at him. Piece by piece.
Dean softly whispered, "Shhhhh."
"That's what I thought. So you understand that I'm a little blown away here." Sam said, still no exasperation.
Even wounded from the inside, Sam refused to pull a punch. Not wanting another fight, however, Dean just said,"Whatever, Sammy. You should get some rest too. See ya later."
Sam shook his head and softly scoffed, "Sure Dean. Fix it all with a drink and a stranger."
Dean smiled back, "I know, Cas. Kiss me again."
Sam, speaking for the first time asked, "So, I thought you left last night, Cas. When did you get back?"
“There’s time now, Cas. I’m sorry I never said anything.’” Dean said.
Dean thought about it, "It's like when you look at me, you see all of me. And how I am is ok. The good and the bad."
The party resumed, and before long, it was dark outside.
“I want to know.” Dean said.
Bobby looked up at Sam in confusion, "That all you can say? And here I thought you were the more emotionally savvy of the two of you."
"Now Dean, you know that I cannot answer that question without knowing precisely when we are discussing."
"I care about where you go too, Dean." Castiel said.
Castiel began, it was his responsibility. "Dean, I wanted to speak with you."
Dean felt like it was killing him to answer. “He’s gone, Sam.”
“I love him, Sammy.” Dean said unapologetically.
"It is. I want that." Dean said.
"Still haven't wrapped my head around all of it yet. I'm way out of my element here, Sammy." Dean admitted.
Castiel smashed his fist into Dean again, showing no outward sign of emotion. On the inside, however, he was practically screaming at Naomi
Dean replied, "It is. It would be really nice if we were alone."
"My vessel's physical appearance is pleasing for you?" Castiel asked.
"What? She didn't ask to be a nephilim, Metatron. She is an innocent in this." Castiel firmly stated.
"I want all of you. Of that, I am certain." Cas said, honestly.
After drawing his last breath on Earth and closing his conversation with Bobby in regards to what the rest of his existence might look like in Heaven, he found himself standing before open highway. Only this time, not only was there no time, but there was not one of the past earthly limits that would have weighed heavily upon his shoulders and mind.
Cas tilted his head to the side in a very Cas-like way. “How long what Dean?”
Castiel stared at Dean with even more intensity than before. "I want to have you, Dean. I do not know how to make that happen."
Dean looked up at him for a minute before looking back to the cityscape, taking a drink from his close to empty bottle. That was ok, there was a couple more in the impala.
Laying down fully, Dean turned to Cas and said, "Sounds like a plan. Get the lights will ya?"
Castiel got up, after admiring Dean's form in only his underwear, in order to purposefully pickup his button down shirt that he had strategically hung on the back of a chair.
“I want you Dean. So much.” Cas said in reply.
Castiel looked over at Sam who was laying with his back to both of them and then nodded. Dean asked, "Listen, you think you can be around this Saturday?"
"Yes, you said that. I can tell that there is more you want to say." Castiel said.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Dean cleared his throat, grabbed his beer, and made to rise.
"Just go outside Sam. Some things it's better just to see for yourself than to hear from somebody else."
Castiel was nearing the breaking point. "No!"
was nearing and it required alot of his blood. He wasn't sure what more he could give, and he didn't like the feeling that Cas was around part time at best, nor
Dean pressed forward, kissing Castiel. Castiel had experienced nothing like it. This was the reason God placed humans at the highest rank of all of His works.
Dean grunted drinking a cup full of coffee but didn't argue.
the feeling that Dean was pulling away and into himself even more.
They walked in quizzically and found Sam helping Bobby set up a spread of typical American staples at the kitchen table. Sitting down, Dean asked in a joking manner "What's the occasion? We usually don't get this kinda service here."
Bobby looked up at Sam, carefully considering how he should answer, "I don't think you have to worry too much about that part."
When no one said anything, Cas acknowledged what Sam said, "Thank you, Sam. I'm glad we have your support, and I know Dean is as well."
“Cas.” Dean said simply.
described the sweet girl as a nephilim that needed to be murdered for the sake of all of heaven, Castiel was even more wary.
Melissa, the wife of one of the other hunters they were somewhat close with asked "What's with your brother and that guy?"
Castiel flipped the lamp switch off and then nestled into bed like Dean had. Dean gently grabbed Cas' shoulder and guided him to turn himself on his side with his back to Dean. He then began to scratch and draw soothing circles on Cas' back. Cas then said, "That feels very nice, Dean."
Dean felt heat hit his face again and he started staring out his window while driving.. There is never really a good age to discuss one’s love life with one’s parents.
Meanwhile, Bobby looked around at the room of people in various corners and rooms and glanced at his phone at the time. It had been almost an hour and a half since Dean had gone out with the angel so he moved his chair outside quietly onto the porch and looked around until he saw them sitting, under the full moon and the light from the pole overhead nearby. "Oh my." He said to himself, taking a sip of his own drink at the intimate site in front of him.
Dean turned, startled, and left his gaze on where Sam had been standing. He contemplated for a moment, what Sam had said, and hating the feeling of transparency.  He turned his attention back to the target and released the entire clip into the heart.
Sam said, “Alright.”
Castiel stood this time and faced her. "How dare you speak about him that way, he is God's creation. And I know Dean's heart. One word from him is
Dean smiled, "Alright Tiger. Go do your thing."
Cas was shocked by all of this. Now that he had him in his arms, he didn’t know what to do. “How come you didn’t say anything?”
"Listen, why don't we take a walk outside?" Dean said with a smirk.
Lowering yourself to lay with this human is beyond anything we could have foreseen."
Dean turned around so fast, Cas was a little taken aback, however, he remained poised as always.
A guy that Sam recognized well came up, clapping him on the back pulling him to the center of the group and Dean smiled, hands in his pockets heading toward the unoccupied kitchen. He was familiar enough with the house and its where he knew how to self-serve.
Dean scoffed, “Is that all you can say? One of our best friends died and you are telling me to be grateful I have his last words?”
"I know ya do. Gotta keep some things for ourselves though. Now, that's enough of the girly talk, let's get the party started." Dean said as they pulled to a stop.
Cas responded truthfully, "I never will again, Dean. But where will I go at night."
Dean was not impressed. "No, you look. You two been pickin' at us since we sat down so let's just clear the air. Cas and I are-" the whole table was staring at him at this point. "-we are trying something together. So if you two could please leave it be and carry on with breakfast, that'd be just swell."
Castiel was gone before Dean could let go of a single breath.
Castiel's hand found his and he froze. Castiel's fingers interlaced with his own and he quieted.
They were met with the sound of cheers from several of the hunters. And more than a few stares from the girls and women that were invited along. Sam spoke up and said, "Hey, fellas. Who do we have to kill for a drink around here?"
Unbeknownst to them, Sam had been awake for most of their conversation, and only just shut his eyes as well.
Cas smiled at the pet name, "I'll see you-"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Does it matter?” Cas said, no point or malice.
The Sun was beginning to go down and their legs felt good getting out of the car as they headed to the door of the house, letting themselves in.
Mary spoke up from the back, “But he can be, sweetheart.”
Cas looked back at his hands, "Oh. You mean like go on a date together?"
It was the first he had spoken directly to him since the last time they’d seen each other, where Dean listened to the words Cas had so contentedly, quietly held onto for an undetermined length of time.
Naomi, losing her patience, "End this, Castiel!"
"I'm sure you got a million questions for him, but right now, we gotta just ride it out and let em have their thing. Now I don't know bout you, but I sure could use a stiff one."
In unspeakable pain, Dean looked pleadingly at Castiel, eyes showing only innocence "Cas, this isn't you. This isn't you."
"Nuh uh, Son. That ain't how it works. Ya can't just drop a bomb like that and change the dynamic without talkin about it."
By the time they reached home, they were worn out and it was time to sleep in their motel room they chose near where the article mentioned a series of deaths by beheading.
Taken aback, Sam said,"Look, Bobby, I don't know what I should say here. Dean has never done anything like this before."
Castiel watched every movement of Dean intently, as he always did, and Dean noticed. "I like the way you look at me."
Thanks for the feedback, we are pressing forward with this!
is that you won't sire a child with it." Naomi said, disdainfully.
He leaned his forehead until it touched Cas’. They closed their eyes, and Dean just listened to the sound of the calls of seagulls and the tide. He felt Cas take his hands out of Dean’s and felt them at his waist. Dean leaned forward and the two shared their first kiss on the beach. They heard the sound of seagulls calling and the ocean moving toward their feet. When they opened their eyes, Dean said, “You were always the one Cas. Always.”
Crowley shouted and shot at it wildly.
“Yes. Years.”
“Dunno yet, I’ll tell you when I get back.”
“Take it, it’s yours.”
“I’m sleepy,” Ethan said after the movie ended, “Can I go to bed?”
Dean glanced over at Cas, his daughter fighting sleep in their laps and his niece sucking her thumb under his arm. He shrugged a little.
Dean didn’t want to address this question, he flipped the pancakes onto three plates.
He didn’t know if giving a kid salt and iron to defend herself was exactly good parenting, but it was a lot better than leaving her unarmed if something
Sarathiel nodded her agreement, “We need the books from the Men of Letters’ Bunker. The next human we fish for could go inside the Bunker for us and collect books. We would need someone to open the door.”
It took her longer than she wanted to get out of Sioux Falls, unable to get her bike to full speed with how poorly she could control it with one arm. It was still bleeding too, she’d have to stop and patch herself up. Just a little further, if she could get further away she could stop.
She watched him for a moment, then said, “Do what you want.”
“I’m sure you’d do better riding on the back.”
“You can’t really stay right? The other angels, your superiors, they’ll come looking for you, drag you back.”
“Yes, it does always seem to be some day.”
“You’ll grow to like it.”
“I am being hunted by heaven, Dean. I have no allies left. I fear that if I leave this Bunker I will not live long.”
She looked up at him and shrugged, not really knowing what he wanted her to say.
“Yes. Hell is a vast place, the souls are kept in a singular part. Even angels cannot enter wherever they wish, they must use special doors. The demons were no fools and lifted great walls between the doors and their souls. It was necessary to besiege those walls and tear them asunder. That is why he remained there for forty years, it took a great deal of time to succeed.”
He sat on the other side of the couch and sipped his drink, watching the cartoon play for a moment then paused it, “Hmm, a hard turn from your previous mood,” he said, with a raised eyebrow, ignoring his own capricious moods, “Might I suggest a movie that isn’t about a little fish missing his father?”
“I don’t give a damn how you
Sam sat down, “Probably more like a vessel. That’s what it was before, but that’s us, and we already knew about all that.”
He heaved a sigh and gestured vaguely for her to continue, “Go on.”
He looked pleased she knew the game, “Do you play it with your father?”
“Can you hear what they’re saying? You know Enochian.”
He took his bowl and wrinkled his nose at it but ate anyway. “The boy looks somber.”
He peered through the circular window set in the door to the Bunker and grinned, swinging it wide, “Hey, Cas.”
“You saved Sam for
“Yes.”
“Can I have your lighter, daddy?”
“Ok, come on, bedtime, you can look over the sigils while I tuck her in, Cas.”
Cas glanced at the hand on his shoulder and smiled.
“Not a ton. We’re gonna need more stores. I’ll have to get them in a week or so. I’ll go as soon as we figure out where Castiel is. If he’s gonna try to jump me on a supply run, I at least want to have a heads up. But for now we’ve got some cans still, enough to fill our bellies.”
?” he laughed, “Yeah, alright. It’s a dumb movie but the kid’ll like it.”
Nothing happened.
Incredible thanks AS ALWAYS to chemcat92 for her work storyboarding and beta-ing this story. Her insight is incisive and appreciated.
“I hope so.”
“Not like before,” Cas said hurriedly.
She looked from Cas to her father and worried her lip, “Are angels like monsters?”
She glanced up at the deadly skies devoid of dark, feathered wings; at least for now. As far as she’d seen, it was just her and them now. As easy as it would be to stop the constant scrabble for food and shelter and be done with it, old Winchester stubbornness dictated that if there were monsters to hunt, she’d hunt them. “Just come and get me, shitstains.”
She approached it slow and steady, good arm aiming her gun in case she needed to fire it again. If those claws could cut her this deep, maybe leaving them… would be a waste.
“You would if you hadn’t been hiding out in heaven.”
When she was beyond convinced it was dead, she rolled off of it, sitting up. She wiped her hands on the long grass then grinned at Crowley.
“Well… I’m already packed, I’m gonna hit the road.”
Dean bit his lip, then acted before he could think through the implications, he leaned forward and kissed him.
“If my superiors are with me, I may not be able to speak with you.”
She heard the shrieking coming closer and glanced over her shoulder to see that it was almost upon her. Its wings outstretched, black feathers dull and crumpled, feet with enormous claws pulled up to snatch her like a horrifying hawk. It shrieked and the talons snapped for her.
Cas smiled and took that as assent to pull Dean to him and kiss him again. Dean wrapped his arms around him and Cas held Dean tightly. Dean felt like the world was spinning around them. Cas tasted the way the stars looked out in the middle of nowhere. He made Dean’s head buzz and his blood surge.
“Why not?”
“What doesn’t, Crow?”
He shrugged and hit play, stony faced while they watched the rest of the movie, his two companions sniffling in their little cuddle. He glanced at them and frowned.
Crowley changed the subject, “You’re rubbing your shoulder again, does it still hurt?”
“Your mojo out?” she asked.
She tilted her head and looked at him for a moment, “Ok, you take the sawed-off and head into the field, I’ll take the rifle and the knife. Try to get its wings. You can’t kill it like that but it’ll do damage. And even you should be able to hit it if it’s right up in front of you. We ground it, I jump it.”
“Not to escape at least.”
“Cas, Jesus Christ listen to me.”
when Moose kicked it.  He must have been intolerable.”
“You wanna stay up and watch with us, sport?” Dean asked.
“You were called The Righteous Man for a reason, Dean,” Cas said, “Your soul burns with a just cause, it enraptured me from the first moment I laid eyes on it in Hell. I only meant that may be... difficult for a partner to live up to.”
“What are you hunting?” she asked, laying her head on his shoulder.
“Alright, come on, don’t be like that. Why’d you jump the demon?’
“Well lucky you then, you got housemates. This would be a shitty place to stay in alone.”
She turned on the flame for the stove and slowly stirred the lumpy Hormel tamales, distributing them into bowls and calling for Crowley when they were warm.
“Is he?”
“But not of a Tulpa? I admit I am surprised you tell her stories of your hunts, although I would assume that in reality it was not quite as innocent as your telling.”
“Hardly, there are fledgling angels, I was fond of them,” Cas said.
Dean huffed a laugh, “Sure can. Give me the director’s cut.”
“Fuck, Crow, I know. I know about magic, I lived
“He said, ‘Aid Dean Winchester.’ Take it.”
“Beat it, kid.”
A shiver went down his spine, the hair rose up on the back of his neck..
“You got your ass kicked by a seven year old?”
She shook the bowl in his face. Begrudgingly he took it and started to eat. “Your weapons are over there, in the bag.”
“Don’t have much of a choice,” she said, looking for an opening, “Not a lot of options.”
She smirked, “What, you figured it out all by yourself?”
“Hiya, Cas. How’s the kid?”
“What the hell is this weapon? Some sort of nuke?”
“You’ll eat my damn pancakes and you’ll like them.”
“Of course.”
“Whatever, Cas. If you needed to bail for six years, you needed to.”
If he got caught, he and Sam would both get sent away, and the next time his father got a hold of him he would get the ever-loving shit kicked out of him. Maybe it was time to give this a shot. Making a few hundred at the truck stop sounded easier than losing Sam. At least no one would ever know.
“Are you enjoying being in the field again?”
She glanced at him and nodded, then went back to her rummaging, of course she’d noticed. She found another can of beans and walked back past him, picking up the pot she’d abandoned on the floor. She dug her pocket knife out of her jacket pocket and jimmied the can open, dumping the contents into the pot. She put it back on the fire and squatted to watch it.
“... you know I watched my dad die.”
“I don’t eat, Dean.”
Dean hummed along to the Led Zeppelin on the radio while he flipped the burgers that sizzled in front of him.
“I hardly need you teaching me,” he snapped, “I corralled the demons into an order that was twice what I had found, I bargained the souls from countless stinking humans, I trained fleets of hellhounds!” his voice rose to a shout, “I was the
“What was your transgression? Getting caught by the demon?”
“Afraid of the dark, little Winchester?”
He smiled a wide lascivious smile and purred, “Crowley, they call me Crowley.”
“Good because warding is a delicate business, one scratched out sigil and the whole house of cards comes down.”
“Skin healed fine. Don’t hurt any less.”
“Good girl, eat up,” he said, cracking open a beer while she drank her milk. They were quiet for the first few minutes of the meal while they both wolfed down their burgers with matching gusto.
“You sure? You were pretty beat up.”
She got right to work when she woke, preparing to leave. She could have stayed at that house and hunted more deer, but she couldn’t ever stand to stay anywhere too long, the feel of the too dead bodies got to her without fail and she would move along.
“As the box says. Did you label them?”
“A demon?! Like a real one? We gotta call dad.”
Dean’s blood ran cold. “Where’d it go?”
“Castiel? Castiel is one of them?”
“Why did you help?” he asked, getting the last of the blood off of Cas’ face.
Sam looked at Dean for confirmation. Dean didn’t know if he could confirm, he shrugged, “He ganked a demon.”
As far as she could figure out, there were two components of the plan. The first was the big one:
“It kills bears and coyotes, and it’ll take out their wings, knock ‘em out of the air.”
Crowley shot it in the foot and it howled and stumbled. Bobby leapt at it, digging her dagger into its back. She wrenched it out and drove it down again for good measure.
Sarathiel hadn’t cleaned the blood off herself;  dried now, it stained her twisted form as she circled, advancing on Bobby. Astor mirrored her on Bobby’s other side. She was going to get pincered.
“You were saying it was weak,” he prompted, “The last one I saw wiped out half an army of demons.”
It was only then, when he knew Dean had returned to his room first, that Cas knocked and came in, handing Dean his beer.
“Serves him right,” Dean says, winking approvingly at Bobby, “If you’re gonna hide in people’s closets and pretend to be a monster, you gotta be ready for a little hunter to kick your ass.”
Dean edged around the dumpster, knife held up. He expected at any second for something big and awful to screech and leap out at him. But when he rounded the dumpster he saw who was talking. A boy about his own age was sitting on the ground, bloody and holding his ribs.
“Yeah I can
“Is he a hunter?” she leapt up and jumped to the other end of the couch, rolling off of it and bouncing around the library swinging an imaginary knife.
“What’d you think I was gonna ask.”
She gave him a very Dean-like look and got up on her own, “I want Lucky Charms.”
It was as she’d left it. A picture of her and her dad on the dresser. An old polaroid of her grandmother in a frame on her dad’s nightstand. Cas’ trench coat hanging on the hook.
Cas did not have to say it, Dean, eyes boring into his own, said it for him, “You. Why is it always you?”
“Ah- I see…” he looked away then glanced back at Dean.
“It is of utmost importance that I remain in the lines, I am told,” Cas said, looking up at Dean.
“Well, tell us about the ritual,” Sam pushed.
She pushed him back by the shoulders so she could look him in the eye, “Ethan, I promise I’m going to get you back to your mom. Ok? I promise.”
anything else he'd encountered in his long life. He was walking unknown territory, and he would have an answer in possibly seconds.
Dean nodded, "Think I might head out for a bit. Get some air, clear my head, ya know?"
Dean gulped at that. This was more than he had felt for any other person and he was out of his league here as well. "Same here."
Castiel suddenly looked as if he had been slapped, "Have I done something to have offended you?"
Metatron eyed all three of them, gulped, and quietly closed the door in defeated submission.
Dean, for his part, buried what he had heard Cas say. Was it him? Did he even mean it? Was he even aware of what he said? These were questions that circled his mind but he forced silence towards. Looking at Sam, this wasn't the time to quibble back and forth between what he felt or what someone else might or might not feel for him. The trials were runningrampant repercussions upon Sam's body and they were powerless to stop it. Cas said it himself, "Sam, you are damaged in ways that even I cannot begin to heal."
Dean put his left arm around Castiel's shoulder and gently pulled until Cas' head was leaning on his shoulder, and his head was on top of Castiel's.
Castiel balked, "But I'm not-I haven't-" Metatron continued, "It's one of the reasons I was glad we came across each other. You and I, we have one key thing in common,
Dean moved over to the far side of his bed and gestured for Castiel to join him. Castiel nodded and began taking off his coat and shoes. Once the pants and overshirt followed, Dean pulled the covers back and Cas got in the bed next to him.
Sam turned to glance at Dean, head cocked to the side. He asked, all seriousness, "There somethin' bothering you?"
His phone buzzed so he stepped out of the library to answer, so as not to wake her.
“Yep.”
She ignored Crowley. She didn’t want to kill him, but she couldn’t deny Ethan’s only request.
Dean smirked at him, “Castiel, angel of the Lord, funniest angel in the garrison, all that?”
is saving people. Hunting things is… incidental to this larger calling. A necessary labor at which he is well trained, not the mission of his soul.”
. It is hard enough to keep the boy un-eaten and
at him. He almost hated himself for it. How many chances was he gonna have for this?
She helped him zip up the pajamas when he had them on, “Alright, Ethan, bed or food?”
“As well as I could.”
Dean nodded, “I gotta get you up, alright, probably can’t take you to the ER, right?”
“Yes, I must.”
She grinned, regardless of melancholy and winked, “He sure is, and he won’t ever let you forget it.”
No longer mocking, voice having almost a tremor he explained, “I saw them come through a wall. Their claws just ripped right through it, along with my… the person I was with.”
“Hellions.”
Cas smiled at him, a small and tender smile, “Of course, Dean.” He let his knee continue to rest against Dean’s. Dean looked away, but didn’t move his knee.
“I think you broke some ribs,” Dean said, getting a wash rag and wetting it in the little sink by the microwave, “Not a lot that I can do about that.”
“Hey! I said DINNER!”
“Ethan’s a god, you’re a demon, I’m the last living man.”
Dean grinned at him, “Not acting much like an angel, angel.”
He was very pleased with this game, especially when she played until she fell asleep on the sofa. He took a blanket from the back of the sofa and draped it over her, watching her for a moment. He found that she looked particularly like Dean while she was sleeping; they had the same freckles and the same forlorn features.
“Dinner!” He shouted over his shoulder, loud enough to be heard up the hall of the bunker.
Bobby clambered to her feet, looking up at the two creatures hanging in the sky above her. It was the two she had seen that morning, Astor and Sarathiel.
“Going through inventory, thought I’d better make sure we got everything we need.”
Cas watched her leave uncomfortably, “Dean…”
“Show me again,” he said and handed the rifle back.
“There was a - wait- dammit,” he shoved Sam back onto the bed and grabbed his bag, rifling wildly through it and storming back outside with a gun and flask. Sam, of course, followed him.
That left the part she needed to tackle: aiming. According to the lore Uncle Sammy had written down, a powered-up Ethan would get pulled to a different time. He couldn’t do much to control it unless he’d stolen the lifeforce of three people. That meant that unless she could find an alternative way to aim, she and Ethan might get out of the apocalypse but there was no telling where they’d end up, or when they’d find themselves right back here, hiding from Castiel.
Dean focused on the easiest part of that, “You know most angels of the lord would be way worse babysitters than I was when I was twelve.”
“Yeah and your mom was a witch right? Dad told me.”
“You aren’t enough of a leader for ‘em huh?”
“Maybe we could find really bad monsters and you could kill those. I’ll help, obviously.”
Dean glanced at his little brother snoring beside him, “Can we talk outside?”
She hefted her rifle and headed into the barn.
He turned on her nightlight and left her door an inch open the way she liked. He lingered awhile, half to watch her sleep and half because he didn’t want to face Cas just yet. Finally he headed out, going to the kitchen instead of the library to wash up from supper, hoping he could have a few minutes to himself to think. Cas, however, was waiting for him there, sitting as still as a gargoyle.
“It translates to something like,
She grunted, not following him.
“I patched you up last time, didn’t I? Where did you keep your arsenal? I need some spell supplies.”
Crowley smiled right back, offering a hand to pull her to her feet, “Why, yes we did. Now let’s harvest him before his friends come.”
Dean jumped up, “You ok?”
“Probably not. You are bleeding a lot… you may have, with no medical attention.”
“As I said… there is unrest in heaven. I had nowhere else to go. As you know, the Bunker provides some respite.”
She nodded, “Cas, you wanna help?”
Dean sat on the bed, legs outstretched and leaning on the headboard. He closed his eyes and took a sip.
Dean left Cas to lean against the wall of the motel, dropping his room key he was shaking so hard, in such a hurry to check on Sammy. He swore and scooped it up, getting the key in the lock and flinging open the door.
“Alright, but he can’t, can he?”
The guy laughed, “Your highschool ID?”
“Do not worry. Your brother is safe. The demon was alone.”
,” Dean said, “We skipped the first twenty minutes.”
She fell asleep halfway through and Dean kissed her temple then stood up, “Come on, Cas,” he said quietly, putting his hand on Cas’ shoulder and leading him out. “Leave the door cracked open like this, and leave the lamp on.”
“How could I guess?” She asked, “Just tell me what you want.”
“Fuck,” she muttered. Sure the punctures had been deep, but she didn’t think she’d lost enough blood to pass out.
She shrugged at him, not able to negotiate how to go both where she wanted to go and where he did. She’d been so close to him for the last month and he talked
“What did you hunt?”
She pulled herself up and looked around. Sunlight came in through broken slats in the walls and cut dusty shafts of light into the rotting hay. She looked away.
Bobby wove the Indian Scout motorcycle carefully through the stalled cars that littered the broken highway. It was getting worse close to Chicago, the roads were crowded and hard to maneuver through, the slow buzz of her motorcycle the only sound she could hear.
She pulled the trigger and the crossbow sprang, punching back into her shoulder. The bolt wobbled in the air but struck true, piercing through Hannah’s throat. She screamed, blood gushing out. She careened toward Bobby, a dying, jerking mass of wings and claws. Bobby rolled out of the way, barely missing being slammed into.
“Put it on the list,” Dean shoved his list over to Cas, who diligently wrote down his ingredient.
She growled.
is in that panic room. To get a soul all the way to Kansas? I am not certain. And I would not see the boy himself removed from his containment and taken to the Bunker, Thaddeus warns that he is canny and longs for freedom. He has come close to escape on his own already”
“I am a warrior of the Lord. I think I may be good at it.”
“Dean?” Cas asked.
“Settle down, I’m just saying you don’t have to go hunting after something that’s well on its way to starving all by itself.”
She reached out and laid a hand on the spell bag, her fingers curling into the leather.
She took the pot off the fire when it was hot with a stolen oven mitt. She carried it to the kitchen and found a bowl, dumping the warm beans into it and finding a real spoon. She carried it back to the living room and handed it to Crowley.
“It’s just a fish, isn’t it?” Crowley asked dismissively, leaning on the door frame with an eyebrow raised.
“And you were here with her alone?” Cas’ smile faltered imagining Dean alone and broken-hearted, trying to father on his own. Had only he known.
“Put that down,” he snapped, “I saved your life, it isn’t polite to threaten people with bookends.”
“Certainly.”
“You like her?”
“Jesus, Cas, can you drop it?”
“A waste,” he commented, but watched her regardless.
“She is well, sleeping of course at this hour,” Cas said, “She missed you greatly, but I found it no trouble to care for her. How did your hunt go? Was it successful?”
“No proof you’re not just as bad with a knife as a gun. And no reason I can’t do both.”
“Yes, we played -ah- she called it tag. She is a clever tactician for one of her age.”
“Eight,” he said, “How long do we have to drive?”
She glanced between him and the bike and narrowed her eyes, “Come on.”
She took his spot, sighting the rifle, and squeezed the trigger. The bottle shattered off the fence. “My dad taught me, I practiced alone after he died.” She reloaded the rifle and handed it back, “Keep at it, you’ll need to be able to shoot.”
“No- no you can call me Cas.”
“Hello, Dean,” he said in the hallway, answering the call.
The hallway was very dimly lit and Dean was not moving to take them to the library or war room to talk. Even bloody as he was, he was not shoving his way to a quick shower and bed. Castiel found himself not minding the limited space available in the hall, so he said nothing about it.
“No.”
“His family?”
“A lot of people have said that about working with Crowley,” he mocked.
Crowley pulled her up and they scrabbled at the door of the dungeon, finally flinging it open as Castiel rounded the corner toward them, terrifying in the Bunker’s flashing red emergency lights.
“Why not just meet me at the Bunker? It isn’t like we’ll have time to stop. Give me the key.”
Incredible thanks to chemcat92 for her work storyboarding and beta-ing this story. She is an asset and a brilliant editor!
“Course I can, I think it’s about that time.”
“Crow?”
There’d been close calls before sure, where Sam had been in danger or late home from school. But this was different. He’d left a note. Dean was supposed to be looking after him  and he left a note and said he wasn’t ever coming back.
Her heart constricted, “Sure, kid. What kind of story do you want to hear?”
The man nodded blankly and turned back to his truck.
“Yes, I believe it’s a sure thing.”
Castiel stood, frowning slightly in his dirty trenchcoat, “Hello, Dean.”
“An angel feather,” he said, “From an angel your father killed on a playground.”
“Of course, we’re getting out of here.”
She stumbled to her feet and laughed, even as she fell back, catching herself on the wall, “Yeah, your mojo’s out. Or you’d have flung me into a wall.”
Dean leaned closer, never closing the distance, like he was caught in Cas’ orbit, “You keep dying on me, buddy. I want you to stay.”
Dean held his gaze for a long moment then turned away and headed out of the bunker.
Sam’s eyebrows drew together, “We’re going to talk anyway.”
Dean didn’t really need to know what he was going to say, obviously a monster, and Cas was definitely not human, asking him not to call his dad should be a red flag. But he ignored it.
He sighed, “Why not? It’s the end of the world. You don’t want to have a little fun?”
“No,” Crowley cut her off, “I am quite certain it hasn’t found any souls to eat.”
Its ribs were protruding sharply from its abdomen, its belly distended and sick, limbs emaciated and shuddering.
Before she’d gone a block, a shadow crossed overhead and she cut her engine right where she was, taking the time to drop the kickstand only so it wouldn’t clatter. She seized the side bag off the bike and pelted into the nearest building, not bothering her usual sweep for animals. She raced to a back room she could barely see with the light coming through the broken window and closed the door, slamming the lock home. She scrambled for her weapons, holding her sawed off in her hands so tight her knuckles must have been white, listening.
Bobby swallowed and looked around the Bunker around her. Oh, she knew every inch. It all reminded her of the legacy she carried, and the hard decisions hunters always had to make. A sacrifice for the greater good. She’d read the Men of Letters’ notes, lots of sacrifices had been made here. Ethan was dead either way. She wondered if her dad had ever had to kill someone for the greater good.
“Sorry, Castiel.”
She pulled a face, “Don’t be stupid. Get up. You’re coming with. Supplies.”
“Yeah, it’s my friggen room, where did you think I was gonna go? Go take a shower, Sam, you smell like ass.”
Sam glared at him, the picture of indignation, “So is this.”
“Then we draw a little of my blood and mix it with the other ingredients, paint these symbols on his forehead and… finish the job.”
“How is Sam?”
“Well we gotta keep our stuff in nice condition, right, sharpen all the knives, clean the guns, see what spell shit we’ve got.”
“I see… and if she asks me to tell her stories about monster hunts?”
Bobby glanced at Crowley and he shrugged, as lost as she was.
He stared at her from the grass, breathing hard, bleeding badly, a look of shock and pain distorted around his teeth.
He fidgeted and then looked back at Dean, “In my time observing you… I saw how well you cared for Sam. What you are willing to bear for his well being.”
“Can we go to a concert?”
“Cas and I are on our way, kiddo,” he said into the walkie. He pulled his t-shirt back on and threw one to Cas so he wouldn’t have to button up his dress shirt again. “We’ll make sure you’re ok. You got salt and iron?”
She closed it behind her and turned on the light.
Dean threw his head back and laughed, Cas smiling unsurely at him, “Damn, I missed you, Cas.”
“But Astor’s thing just said it needed grace, you’d just be a human right?”
Dean laughed, leaving the food to pick up when he got Cas back. “I’ll call my dad, he’ll know what to do.”
Hannah screeched above them and Bobby curled up against the pain in her shoulder and her ears. Hannah leapt from the car and landed beside it. They could see her clawed feet in the dirt. All she would have to do was bend down and it would be over.
Sam nodded and closed the door again.
She took them out of South Dakota, as straight south as she could manage, no use going north and deeper into the cold.
“Good so far, it might be a ghost, definitely something funny going on at the cemetery. Shouldn’t take long. Couple days.”
He didn’t say anything, just picked up the plates on the table from dinner and ran a sink of water to clean up.
“Dean, you’ve returned,” was the first thing Cas said when they came inside. Dean blushed.
He saw the scuffle on the floor and threw out an arm to stop Cas.
“It is not one that I relish.”
“Just hemmed in.”
“My power came from hell, alright? And hell is empty.”
She laughed and danced around, spying him down the hall and charged a third time.
“Yeah, well you fucked off for six friggen years,” Dean snapped.
“I don’t know what that means, Dean.”
She growled and drew her real knife.
He nodded in satisfaction when the little feet pitter-pattered down the hallway. Bobby careened into the kitchen and half-fell half-leapt into her chair, grinning. A hole stuck out in her smile where she’d lost a tooth.
She got up and walked out into the South Dakota cold to get it.
She flipped open the leather cover and paged through it, she was sure she remembered right.
“Not what I’m talking about, Cas.” He waggled his brows, “We’re here, alone. Can any of your keepers see you?”
.’ But, come on, Crowley wouldn’t kill Ethan in his sleep.
“I meant when she was older.”
Before she could open the door to the garage, a horrible, winged form burst through it. Its giant, winged body filled the whole hallway. The Baby Ray snapped her teeth, screeching.
“The end game?”
She’d lost her anger by the time she got there, replacing it with bone-deep fatigue. She wiped the dust from the porthole window and leaned her forehead against it. The footstool she’d moved to look out this window when she was little was still there, kicked to the side. She didn’t need it now, but it was a dim reminder of how many hours she’d spent staring out this window.
“What’s this?”
Crowley sneered, “He can see my true face, you little gremlin, probably for the same reason the Hellions wanted his blood.”
“Come up with a better one then,” he snapped.
“If there was a spell anywhere, it would be here. We could… “ His eyes were bright.
“When did your father kick it anyway? How long did he make it?”
“I hadn’t bothered to imagine it. So are you the last living Man of Letters?”
Crowley smirked, “I suppose you’d like it better if I said you look like a Hunter.”
“Who did you leave with the boy? I do not trust Hannah. She is too hungry.”
“About leaving your progeny at home?”
“Can you stay til morning?”
She got up when Ethan did and found him a new t-shirt to wear, “Let’s go get breakfast,” she said, “Come with me to check the sigils and then we’ll eat.”
The boy was pale, with wild dark hair, slightly matted by blood. He gasped when he saw Dean illuminated by the flickering light. Blood ran down the side of his face, but if Dean didn’t know any better he would say that his eyes, shining a spectacular blue looked… reverent.
Cas held him close, “Yes… they will… always drag me back.”
“You’d die. To finish the spell we have to kill you.”
“I found a spell in an old Turkish book to steal the power of a god.”
“The Bunker.”
“Yes,” he said, eager when Dean looked at him in understanding, “They have been with me at every moment. I wanted to come before you were hurt, I could not. I only just got away.”
He opened his eyes and sneered at her, “I’m awake, cut it out.”
“Ok,” she said, confused, “What are you here about?” She pushed her hair back off her forehead.
“Alright, Winchester,” she muttered to herself, “Get up and go. There’s a kid in there.” She stood up and shot her sawed-off into the air. It echoed in the field.
Dean leaned against the refrigerator and sighed, then grabbed a bag of chocolate chips to add to the mix, “Unrest in heaven… I know what you said last night but, you bringing me back into this shit?”
Cas broke away, “I must go. Goodbye, Dean.”
She nodded, “So there aren’t many people left.”
She didn’t go upstairs, she didn’t need new clothes at the moment and the second floors were starting to be unstable in places, no need to risk it now.
She clocked Crowley glaring at them but she ignored him, not interested in wasting time while they were out in the open with a kid. A real, living kid.
She stepped back and lit a match, tossing it among them. They went up in flame, heat blazing her face. She closed her eyes, letting the fire warm her, orange behind her eyelids.
He knew how to do this, he’d done it with his dad a hundred times.
at you?”
“It doesn’t matter right now,” Crowley said, glancing back at Castiel who finally smashed the door open, silhouetted in the door, wings outstretched, claws bared.
“Person or demon?”
“You heard that?” Dean asked, grinning while he blushed.
She smiled at the name, “Sure. Headlight and noise from the bike for all them to see and just darkness for us.”
“It’s stealing a god’s power, what do you think I mean?”
“Lucky us,” Crowley said, going back to his reading.
“Feeling a touch of ennui, are we?” He asked her.
Cas glanced up at him then back at Bobby, “Hello.”
Dean ran a hand down his face, “I’m going to bed.”
“Moose is Uncle Sammy?” She carried on when he smiled in assent, “Ok, well he didn’t arrange the books out here.”
“What’d he look like?”
“Your father was a lot mouthier than you, you could have at least made a good story out of that.”
Bobby wrenched her hands free and dove for Ethan’s limp form instead, red light overtaking her. Her last sight was of Castiel pouncing on Crowley, claws bared, as she disappeared.
“I can see that.”
A few days later, the motorcycle rumbled under Bobby while she barreled down a mercifully empty highway. The cars had been going fast when they’d come so they were crashed in ditches, roofs torn off of most of them. It left the highway clear for her to cruise down, stopping only when the asphalt was broken and needed to be carefully maneuvered over. She’d just looted new tires, she didn’t want to damage them.
He should get his phone, try to call his dad. Sammy was at Stanford, he couldn’t help. And he wouldn’t want to hear his big brother die over the phone.  His phone was in his jacket across the room anyway, might as well be a mile away.
He did the same, removing his tie and letting her treat and bind the wound on his chest.
“Your soul bleeds black?” she asked.
The creature screeched and fell, Bobby on top of it, holding her dagger, blood splattered over her. She brought the dagger down a few more times, ravaging its back.
“I was the King of Hell!” he sneered, although he still kept his voice low.
Dean had been gone for less than two hours, trying to get the sister of the guy who’d gotten chewed up by some sort of monster to spill more information. He even got the information. He’d been proud of himself damnit.
She paused right before she’d become visible and looked up, checking each of the windows of the house for someone watching before she rolled across the open dirt path. She whipped her feet in behind her after she was in the car’s cover and clutched her knees, eyes clenched shut, listening for the doom song of wings.
Crowley groaned, “Squirrel’s little kitten aren’t you?”
“Yes, Dean.”
“Dean, it’s like four degrees outside, and snowing.”
“No, of course not, is that blood on your jacket?” Sam shoved him off and stood up, “Dean what’s going on?”
“Why not?”
“Hey, man,” he said, nodding to the guy at the door, “Forgot my ID.”
“Alright, Bobby Winchester,” she muttered to herself, “Get up and go to your bike. Come on, don’t be such a baby. Worst case, you die, no biggie.”
“Yeah, me too,” Dean said, “Alright, she oughta get up from her nap now anyway. How’d you get her to go down?”
“Like you said, it doesn’t matter if we’re involved or not. If it goes south we’re all in it anyway.”
She put Ethan down on the sofa and almost collapsed. Now that she was here and death was not winging its way down on her, the full pain of her wounds came soaring back. She would rather have knives under her fingernails.
“Dean I- I have a question I find I would like to ask you.”
“Excuse me,” he rumbled, “It took you equally as long.”
Dean poured himself more whiskey, “Well why do they want Michael anyway? What’s he gonna do?”
Cas smirked back, “I am not in the garrison now, Dean.”
“So… if they
“Dean, why would a fledgeling be in a garrison?”
Crowley glanced at the book and then back at her, “You are going to love the real world, Bobby.”
She walked forward and shoved him back against the couch, seizing the knife off his belt roughly as he squabbled with her. She got it half lifted to bear before he got his hand up to her wounded shoulder and dug his fingers into the holes left by the beast.
“What?” He asked, raising his voice as the Baby Rays rent the iron in the door.
Bobby broke the moment, looking up at Cas, “You’re an angel?”
“What if you got orders to stay away?”
“Ok, I’m gonna come back there, but if you jump out at me I’m gonna be pissed,” he warned, covering up his fear with bravado.
“It’s cold.”
“She’s four.”
He leaned on her and pressed his small face into the soft fabric of her shirt, “I don’t wanna.”
“It’s- it’s alright. Heaven stuff right?”
Bobby lurched the motorcycle around so fast the rear tire skidded and she almost fell. She wrenched on the accelerator and snapped forward, the monster bearing down. This little bike wasn’t meant to race, it seemed so slow, like she was dragging through mud. It would not be fast enough.
“You’re still my best friend, Cas, even if you were a dick for six years.”
“Please,” he whispered into his hands, blood from his nose dripping onto his fingers, “Please. Please Cas, keep him safe. Please.”
The walkie on Dean’s nightstand buzzed to life, “Daddy! Help!”
Dean wasn’t exactly inexperienced, but he had never felt this sort of stirring in his chest before like he did looking up at Cas. He felt like such a
“Sure, Bobby, what are we looking for?”
Well, I caved. I have more to write on this one I guess. Next chapter might get a racier. Let me know what you think!!
“I wouldn’t go but Sammy called, I’m the only one in the area, people are dying.”
“So am I!” he complained.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
“One angel? We iced archangels before, we can take one winged freak.”
“His family’s a piece of shit.”
But they did not come, nothing came.
“I need to go,” Cas said, but tilted his head and looked inquiringly at Dean instead of leaving, hand still holding Dean’s.
“You’re not wrong, but it’s the best I got.”
Dean stepped close, kissing Bobby’s hair while she was in Cas’ arms, putting all three of them in close, warm proximity.
“What’s the ritual?”
She did not pause her work, lifting the tip of the knife over Ethan’s heart, “Are you sure, Ethan?”
“Absolutely intolerable, you are,” he said, but left to get himself a drink.
Cas closed his eyes as Dean cleaned him up, “I will heal more quickly than a human, but I cannot call upon Heaven’s power to aid me.”
“You have not improved your ability to hold a coherent conversation. But yes, clearly they can starve.”
“You don’t think it found-”
“...Can you run away, Cas? Come with me.”
“Why?”
“What? No!”
He was proven right when even this made her gasp, “Daddy did bad things? Did he poop his pants on purpose?”
Dean kicked the radiator again to get it to come back to life. It shuddered and choked out a little warm air and Dean tugged Sam over to hold his hands out in front of it.
Dean laughed, relieved they weren’t sniping at each other, “Bet you were a cute fledgeling.”
Cas chuckled, “Dean, you have always been soft in that regard.”
He waited for the man to pull him or hit him or something. He didn’t.
Ethan followed her to the kitchen, scrambling up onto the counter and sitting happily while she opened cans, “Bobby, can we watch more movies after we eat?”
But he was faster and batted at the back of her bike. It slid out from under her and she tumbled to the gravel. She was saved only because she had not had time to gain any speed, so the fall did little more than scrape her up. She rolled and landed on her feet, dagger-claw ready.
“Yes,” Cas answered bluntly.
“No Spaghetti-o’s,” Sam said, going back to his own textbook.
“Why did you come here, Bobby?” He asked, snapping his teeth, “I would have thought you remembered what we can do. I saw you watching through the door.”
He growled impatiently, “I will leave you here.”
“Be safe, Dean. Were our situation different I would come with you.”
She looked over at Crowley who was crouched behind a car a few feet away and shrugged, dropping to the dirt and army crawling one car closer to the house. When she was safely behind it, she came up to look through its broken windows at the front door.
They both looked at each other, not daring to breathe for a second.
She’d been reading for maybe two hours with absolutely no luck when she took mercy on Ethan who was falling asleep in his hard backed chair, “You hungry, kid?”
“Yes, how is the hunt going?”
Cas smiled, “Ah! That
Cas fidgeted, “Ah well I- I assume you will not stay here long.”
“Yeah, that too, she was just a baby back then. She napped through the whole thing, I made Sammy come watch her.”
“Alright, you remember what it was called?”
“You are resourceful,” he said, “I will give you that. Dean never managed to kill any of us. Of course we were stronger then, gorged on souls. It was you who killed Efram and cut off his claw a year ago? I wondered.”
He shoved his own claws into a bag and scowled, “You would prefer if I dressed more like a lumberjack?”
Let me know what you think!! Comments are always appreciated.
“I think-I think I require… assistance.” The voice sounded like this was a foreign concept, but it was young and more lost than angry, not exactly like an angry spirit.
Dean lost his edge immediately, “Whatever, I’ll do it when I get back.”
“Yes.”
“Where do you think we’re going?”
He snuggled closer to be held, “Something fun.”
She watched him for a moment before she stood up. She clicked on her old nightlight and left the room. She didn’t want to talk to Crowley for a while. Seeing Cas - seeing Castiel had opened a gaping old wound. Jesus Christ she missed them.
Bobby had her cousin Eddy, who had half a foot on her and was wearing a ghoulish mask knocked to the side, pinned to the floor and was pummelling him while he wailed.
“Wait, tell me a story.”
“What?”
“If you will have me.”
“Sarathiel,” Crowley supplied, “I never liked her.”
“That you?” He asked, “Probably not. Probably just… a light that’s going out.”
“...Did you think that I was another demon tricking you?” Cas asked, tilting his head.
She nodded and rubbed at the wounds the first monster had left in her shoulder over a year ago.
Cas remained motionless in the hallway, looking at the spot where Dean had disappeared around the corner. He did not need to sleep and felt more anxiety than he had let on about watching over Bobby. Of course, it should not be much trouble, but an error here would cut him from Dean’s heart forever. It was his child.
They both listened to the whisk scrape the bowl for a long moment.
Bobby looked at him and took a long, steadying breath.
Cas closed his eyes in resignation.
“Yeah?” he softened, “You think? You’ll like her.”
“Yeah, Aunt Eileen and my cousins. Mary and Eddy.”
“How ‘bout a movie?”
“Might have been. And there’s no proof that they will still be there.”
Even not moving and bloody on the ground, she could tell it wasn’t dead. It still filled the street with a bone-deep sense of dread, so thick it was like a smell: sickening and unnatural.
“Crowley!”
“Yeah, what are you doing?” she asked, hair a wild mess from her nap.
She glared at him, wavering in indecision.
“Yeah yeah yeah big and lots of wings I got it. Cutest thirty-eyed monstrosity in the garrison, I bet.”
“...Yeah, buddy.”
“We will be there shortly,” Cas said into the walkie, pressing the talk button with his hand over Dean’s.
She shrugged, “I guess we’ll get a better idea if we find more. Now get working, old man, I wanna clear out of here.”
“You lived here almost a decade alone and didn’t finish it?”
“Were they hunters?” He asked, his tone suggesting he knew very well the answer.
“Yes, that of a young Egyptian boy, he was my first vessel. Luckily he survived what I needed of him and I was able to return his vessel to him shortly after inhabiting it.”
“Freaking werewolves,” he whined, letting himself pout only because he was alone. Oh he was bleeding a lot. Maybe too much. Maybe this was it.
“Ethan!” she screamed. They had to get to the garage which was the only other exit.
living with Dean bloody Winchester while he was
She looked curious, “Where’s Napoli?”
Cas painfully lifted his arms and let Dean help him out of his shirt. He had a stab wound on his side that pulsed red. If Dean needed any proof after the light show that he wasn’t a human this was it, if he were a kid, this would have killed him.
She pushed aside the branches, heart hammering in her chest. “I won’t hurt you, are you there?”
“I know you would, Cas, someday.”
“A rugaru!” She announced, punching at nothing.
“See, they’re fine,” Dean said.
Bobby looked around the library and shrugged at him, “You can look. I’ll look if it makes you feel better. But we’d better get into the real old archives.”
“Shut up, we got to kill it to get you your own knife.” When he didn’t immediately respond, she handed over the shotgun, getting herself hunkered down under a tree where she couldn’t be swooped at.
“You remember? Who the hell are
She considered this and sat back down, motioning for him to continue.
“Yeah… he was the first.”
“He’s canny, strategic, and he has many allies.”
The corner of Crowley’s lips turned up, “You think I’ve come into your room in the middle of the night because I’m
“Why’d he go hunting? He should have brought me with.”
!? That is my bloody luck, of all the little maggots still left on the Earth it would be a Winchester.”
The creature howled and lunged, the heavy claws hanging from its hands slashing at her. She threw up her knife, striking one of its hands, piercing it clean through.
“Was he now?” Crowley asked, moving next to her to read the journal over her shoulder, “And you believe our little Ethan to be what? His son?”
“You lived here for years.”
been nice to have another person around. She, however, found it difficult to be anything but relieved. She listened to the quiet around her after his motorcycle had stopped rumbling, enjoying that she could hear the wind in the long grass.
The screen door on the house clattered as it was thrown open and Bobby and Crowley heard something pelting across the gravel that did not sound like a Baby Ray’s clawed feet. Hannah leapt away from them and the others shouted in Enochian. They could hear fighting and rolling in the dirt.
There was no reason for her to be in Chicago, but then there was no reason not to be in Chicago either. Maybe the Field Museum was still up. Uncle Sammy said it was unmissable.
He shifted in discomfort, “It has been… difficult to keep the peace. They want a real leader, an archangel.”
Cas nodded a little and looked at him, “Where is her mother?”
A shadow passed overhead.
“Shit, really?”
“There, see, that’s using sense. We can just wait them out and enjoy each other’s company,” he said it with odd emphasis, lifting his brow suggestively.
Sam poked his damp head out, wrapped up in a big towel, “Yeah, what happened.”
“Who did? I can’t imagine it was your lughead father or his tweety bird feathered boyfriend.”
She shrugged, “Who cares, it’s the end of the goddamn world.”
She brought him to her own room for now. It had been a few years since she’d been here but it was the most well maintained. She changed the sheets and tucked him in, checking on the sigils that were still painted on the walls. He was asleep the second his head hit the pillow.
He made a petulant little face, “Then I suppose this is as far as we’ll get tonight.”
Cas drew back, fearing he had grossly misstepped, “Dean, I - I did not mean to imply you were… violent with your partners.”
The ground was wet and cold in the trees and it was hard to follow the blood. She got lost twice, having to go all the way back to the house and start again, before she found the deer collapsed and dying. She drew her knife and ended its suffering. She was lucky it was just a small doe, if it had been a buck she’d have had to clean it here. As it was, she could crouch and get its hundred pound body over her shoulders to haul it back to the house.
“Just get on your bike.”
“I will do my best, and I can cook well enough to keep us alive.”
The streetlight flickered.
“Not so chatty, hm? A pity. Sit down.”
Castiel sighed and lifted her out of her chair, carrying her back to her bedroom. His heart constricted gently when her head nuzzled his shoulder and she fell asleep before he’d even laid her down.
“Why can’t you-” she mimicked his hand motion from before that had done nothing but look stupid. She’d been told by her dad the broad strokes of demons throwing him and Uncle Sammy across rooms.
even know how this works? We hunt through these archives and figure out how to get out of the
“Yeah, he’s fine. Get your pajamas on.”
“Yeah, yeah here it is. Look familiar?” she turned the journal around and showed Crowley an old photo of a dark haired man, “Ethan Snider.”
Bobby shrugged at Ethan, “Alright, buddy, let’s go and watch our movie, your turn to pick this time.”
“Tulpa it is,” Dean said, feeling Cas’ eyes on him as he told a cartoonish and bloodless rendition of his and Sam’s adventure with the Tulpa in Richardson.
“How’s Bobby?” he asked, coming so very close to Cas as he crossed the threshold, closing the door behind him.
“I am-” Cas licked his lips, “I am glad to be with - to be here.”
Bobby snorted, “Yeah, he ain’t exactly a looker,” she said.
“Yeah, didn’t want to… you know.”
“Why? You don’t trust me?”
Cas could not resist a smile at the gentle and paternal tone Dean’s voice got when Bobby was upset or fussy or tired.
His phone buzzed on the table and he glanced at it while she was picking herself up, “Hey, my friend’s here. Come on, let’s go let him in.”
“No, to have my grace taken like that would almost certainly kill me.”
She screamed, falling back and scrambling to her feet.
“We’ll work that out, for now I’m, uh, I’m glad you’re here.”
“Hey! Do you have any table manners at all?” he snapped.
Cas smiled and did as he was told, going to the kitchen for snacks. He returned with the popcorn and sat on the other side of the couch from Dean, who put Bobby down to snuggle in the middle.
option. Either we take this way out or Castiel breaks in and kills us all. The boy dies here either way - this way at least we get to live.”
“Huh? No, I’m not mad, definitely not mad at you,” he said soothingly, “But it’s bedtime.”
She shoved Ethan and Crowley in front of her into the dungeon and slammed the doors behind her. It would buy them time at least.
Cas laughed, “Yes, you are correct, of course. Perhaps then it is more accurate to say that you have left her with your…” he trailed off, his courage failing.
“Cas? I miss you, buddy. I didn’t even get to see you last time. Just… is Sammy ok? Do you know? Can you give me a sign or something?”
“No, course not.”
They stayed there, looking at each other, faces inches apart. Dean’s eyes flickered down to Cas’ lips.
She saw Bobby immediately, standing there outside the junkyard fence in the long grass.
He nodded, “I do, but we’re too far. We have to get closer.”
She shrugged, “Only funeral I know.”
“He came to find your brother, Sam Winchester.”
He wouldn’t hurt Ethan. He said he wouldn’t.
But its wounded leg didn’t heal and it only snarled at her, not advancing, opening and closing its mouth, many rows of teeth gnashing.
“...Amber, her name was Amber alright?”
She drew a knife out of her belt and tossed it up lazily. She waited until it was pummelling back down at her face before snapping it out of the air. “You getting us out, Crow?”
His head was tilted as he regarded her, curious, no hint of mourning for his fallen comrades.
“You get Thaddeus?”
“If your father were here he would undoubtedly agree with me.”
“When do you think it started?” Bobby asked, compassion blossoming for the boy.
“Let’s get you washed up and in a real bed, huh?” she said, carrying Ethan down the long hallway. “Watch the doorway, Crow, there’s a -”
She couldn’t help but glance up at Crowley before returning to her notes on Henry’s spell. She couldn’t do the spell the way Henry had. It required an angel feather, which wasn’t exactly something they could get. Too bad, since it would be a neat escape hatch from their current existence. But the spell also used a sigil painted in blood on the wall.
Her hands tightened on the rifle and her eyes hardened, “Get out of here, go into town.”
“When are you gonna leave?”
“Or near Bobby.”
“About the wound? I was not planning to advertise my state of weakness.”
“What was he, seven or eight years old?” He said, purring, “You want to put him in even more danger than necessary?”
“...There was a time I didn’t get cold.”
He followed her, making a face, “Excuse me, in case you didn’t notice, I was speaking to you.”
,” Cas said, “But to awaken them will take a great sacrifice.”
She made an odd, confused sound and went back to the kitchen for heavy kitchen shears, before sitting again by the fire and beginning to cut up the jacket.
Astor looked uncertain, “It would be a hard thing. We have so few souls that someone would have to go hungry,” he paused and scowled, “
Bobby shoved her mouth full, not able to explain the melancholy that sat between her shoulder blades, that she could feel pushing down on Ethan, to Crowley or to anybody. If he didn’t know what she meant already, he’d have to catch up on his own.
Crowley shrugged and dumped the bowl into the sink and slunk out, mood turning sour without anything Bobby could read as a warning.
“Yes, pet.”
“How about English.”
“Burgers,” he answered, glancing at Dean.
“Fuck yeah,” he said, “Missed it. Gets your blood moving.”
“Dean,” Cas replied, fingers almost, but not quite, curling around Dean’s own.
Dean was flooded with a rush of emotions for his baby brother and wanted to scoop him up and kiss his stupid floppy hair and hug him like a kid. But he resisted and acted like a man about it, punching Sam’s shoulder, “I won’t get caught.”
“I know how much you like being out in the action, Cas, can’t be fun to be stuck here.”
“Different how?” Dean demanded.
“How long do you think the Bunker will hold out against the Hellions?”
“That’s ok, I got a flamethrower!” She shouted and made her best flamethrower sound effects while burning the imaginary rugaru. She looked up, “Dad did you see - dad?” she asked, looking at the spot on the couch he’d been a moment before.
Crowley raised his eyebrow, “Woman, I suppose.”
“Ok, and then what?” she asked.
“Yeah well… the kid gets up early.”
Cas did know, and did not make him explain himself, “Dean, working while your daughter is safe and cared for by an angel of the lord is not the same as leaving two children to care for each other in a motel room.”
At a total loss as to what just occured, Dean asked, "What the hell just happened?"
“I never thought I’d see you again either.” Cas said in response.
Dean could only watch with clouded eyes as the angel blade dropped to the ground, and Castiel retrieved the angel tablet basking
Dean gave him a one-sided smile and Cas said, "This is nice."
Dean took the opportunity to adjust, driving for what felt possibly like hours with nothing but the music blaring and the wind blowing in his hair. The outside temperature was perfect. No oppressive heat and no biting chill. As he continued to drive, with no destination in mind, he began to reflect on the events in his life that had lead him to where he was today, as well as the people he had met and who had left an impact upon him in life.
At the sight of the sadness in Dean's eyes, he quickly added, "But I will always return to you."
Metatron made to follow him, but before he could get Castiel to stop or consider coming back around, Castiel was in the wind again. Perhaps more importantly, albeit unbeknownst to team free will or the players in heaven, Metatron was without an accomplice to join his illicit cause.
always do. You leave me every time." Dean shivered a little bit and crossed his arms, continuing to look out at the view.
Dean moved to lower Cas onto his back in the sand. He took Cas’ coat  off his shoulders and his tie from around his neck on the way.
expression. "So, sorry Dean," was all he managed to speak.
"Yeah, that was a blast. Can't believe you would just dump that on me and leave." Dean said.
"I believe they're playing my song." Crowley snidely commented.
have to help me with this. I don't know what it means sometimes. Many times, actually."
He closed his eyes and listened only to the faint sound of the seagulls’ call against the waves gently beating at the sand. This was nice. Maybe he could just lay here, forever, with no pains of hunger and no threat of thunder. Dean didn’t hate the rain on Earth. Was there really none in Heaven?
And so, Dean met with Jo Harvelle. Dean smiled with her, remembering their last intimate moment together in life and he even made her laugh like he could back then. He thanked her again for the amazingly noble sacrifice she and her mother made in saving Sam and Dean from the hellhounds. With a drink in hand( a habit that Dean still carried with him even into Heaven) sitting at a bar that would remain uncrowded, Jo turned to Dean and said, “I like this soft side of you. I wish I was the one who brings it out of you.” Dean smiled and tried to reflexively deflect as he had always done, “Who says ya can’t?”
"I'm sorry she said those things about you, it doesn't reflect well upon us."
When Castiel didn't say anything right away, Dean added, "Ya know, I take that back. I can believe it because that's what you
Dean didn’t say anything confirming or denying it, like he always did. “How could he possibly love me?”
Dean felt himself growing angry and he tried to stand again, "Listen lady-"
Dean turned to him, "Aww, come on, Cas. I know you spent the night with me, but it's like you just got here. Can't you stay for just a little while before we head off? Let me fix ya somethin to eat first."
Sam approached him and said, "Look, I think we've both had a long day, and it's time to crash. But tomorrow, we're gonna have a talk, you and me."
With that they both returned to the party, leaving Dean and Cas outside again. They had been silent for a while.
Naomi and three other angels stared at him, Naomi began the conversation, "Hello, Scribe. Have a seat, and we will discuss what brings you out of the shadows after hiding
“Billie was after us. She was going to kill us both and we couldn’t escape or take her. When we were cornered, Cas told me things.” Dean cut off, his eyes clenched shut.
Dean made to stand but Castiel placed an assuring hand on his shoulder. "Let me handle this."
Dean smirked at his little brother. "That right?"
Looking for his phone, Dean rhetorically asked, "What time is it?" Then he whistled when he found it. "It's almost 10 in the morning. Need to get goin." Dean quickly yanked up yesterday's jeans and t-shirt.
Dean just stared open-mouthed for a second but he did recover and say, “ I don’t know what to say.” No need for the pretense of ignorance, it would just dig a deep hole that would look sad and cowardly.
"Can't help it. I'm really happy with this." Sam said.
Dean looked out his window as they turned down the road that would end their long journey from their last case. "Not really, Sam. Just in my head that's all."
Sam tried to ease the tension "Dean, look, it's ok. He was just-"
"I caught that, Cas, thank you." Sam said.
Dean didn't know what he should do or even wanted to do. "Cas. Cas! Get back here you son of a bitch!"
"It really is." Dean said pulling back taking him in. It had been a long while that their paths had intersected, especially given the decline in the level of bad he and Sam had been fighting lately.
In the corner off to the side, not talking to a single person was the first angel Castiel.
"It's ok, Cas. Dean hasn't either, you are in the same boat there. You can figure it out together." Sam added.
"I am open to your instruction in this area." Castiel said.
Castiel knew that they were toying with him at this point, so he decided honesty was the best policy "It is a recent development and Dean and I are growing closer so it is he who I choose to spend my time with."
had an external appearance that could definitely be construed as reflecting what was within. This further justified Castiel's initial suspicion of him; and, when Metatron next
For the first time in a long time, and, for an angel, that is saying something, Castiel felt heat rise to his cheeks in embarrassment. Even though he didn't realize that was the word associated with what was happening, he felt it nevertheless and he looked away instinctively. Metatron smiled, gleefully "It's true isn't it. You and that Winchester boy. Oh how
How ironic: the very thing that brought him into contact with Hunters, Prophets, and even Angels was no longer a blip on anyone’s radar. It was a lot to unpack for someone like Dean, who was driven for results as a dedicated hunter in life. He is going to have to face every one of these people at some point, including himself.
Dean stood up, pulling Cas up with him. "Come on. Let's go home."
Hearing Jack from down the hall, Sam stood up and said, “I’m gonna go fix something to eat for him, and talk to him about what happened. Do you want anything?”
Sam, no longer wanting to tease and certainly not wanting to argue with them, said, "I think that's great that you and Cas are getting closer."
for so long."
"It does Dean. I will make more effort to refer to this body as part of myself, as in a way, it is myself. I must go now." Castiel said, slowly lifting his head from Dean's shoulder.
Not wanting to disappoint Dean, Castiel agreed to stay but firmly reiterated that he would have to part ways after he'd seen Sam and Dean off.
I don't know what will become of it. I don't know where I will live, but I do know that I will not be returning to heaven with you regardless of his
"I very much am, Dean. It's just I don't have a lot of experience with that so I don't know what to wear or how I should conduct myself." Cas said honestly.
Looking back at Dean, he asked, "Is everything ok? Is there something we are up against?"
"Agreed. I need to leave as well." Castiel said, fixing his tie around his neck.
Turning to his father, Dean said, “Yeah, I just don’t see how you are like a completely different person here. All our lives, you told us that love and ‘the life’ don’t mix.”
The rest of breakfast was spent talking about what lay ahead of them. Dean and Sam were headed back to Kansas to investigate the a recent rash of murders to see if there might be more to them than meets the eye. Castiel also talked more about where he was going than usual but still left details vague.
Most of the room took that in and were suddenly a lot less suspicious or judgemental.
"Yes, let me finish. In spite of all that, your slate is clean. Neither of you have any baggage. It might just work." Sam said.
"Well, actually it was you that-" Cas began, but his lips were silenced by Dean's locking with his.
Cas smiled at that, "I can do that. It sounds like fun."
Sam, tired of the cryptic crap, "What are you talking about?"
"Sammy will be ok. After we get through this, he will be. But with us? He will be fine."
Alot of the other hunters scowled. Some of them didn't even know who this stranger was. Even among those that did, some of them had never encountered an Angel even in their line of work. Only Sam and Bobby truly understood.
So many thoughts of what he’d say if given the chance had circled through his head and they all came rushing to the door at once. He was left speechless as a result. He slowly walked to where Castiel was standing ten yards away, only stopping when he was within arms’ reach. The wind was blowing Cas’ hair and his coat was billowing open and his tie was blowing to the side.
He could have cleaned up properly but wished to distract her from her sorry feelings. He waved his hand and cleaned up the kitchen with a small
She clung close to his leg watching him peel back the pull tab top and dump it into a plastic bowl to heat up in the microwave. When it was warm he poured it into a cartoon patterned bowl and set it in front of her at the table.
It was Dean who flinched. He stepped back and tried to smile casually, “Guess I’ll just have to be glad to have you while I got you, man.”
. Why do you think I didn’t try to burn the sigil off Ethan’s arm. That won’t do a damn thing.”
“What happens if I have a bad dream?” She asked, burrowing into her father’s flannel shirt.
Crowley made a face. She supposed she should split the beans with him even if that meant both of them would still be hungry.
“We need to get away from this nest,” Crowley said.
“Why? Shooting doesn’t kill them.”
He watched her, hands on his hips, looking annoyed, “Hello? Are you going to possibly elaborate on that detail? How did you kill it?”
The buildings shot shabbily up into the sky, she wasn’t close enough to see much more than skyline now, still being in the suburbs. She knew, however, when she got up close they’d look broken and bedraggled with no one to look after them.
She dismounted and walked to the trees, “Kiddo? Hey, we don’t have time for this. The Baby Rays are gonna come.”
Nothing came and she relaxed for a single moment until she was forced to watch Crowley try to make the same journey. He wasn’t nearly as athletic as she was and he couldn’t manage the quick roll she’d made, crawling instead, moving so madly it would have been funny in any other circumstance. Instead, it almost made her heart stop.
Dean looked at their hands, “Cas?” His tone suggested he was not concerned about the blood.
“K,” She said and burrowed right back into Cas’ neck.
would be worth seeing.
“Is there?”
“Yes, Dean, I can supervise her while you go on your hunt.”
A big man stepped out of his truck. This guy, maybe, how was he supposed to know?
The force of the impacts pushed the emaciated thing back as they never would have if it were at full strength, giving Bobby time to draw her dagger-claw and race behind the creature, sprinting toward it. It turned and swung its heavy claws at her, missing her by only inches as she dropped back into the grass.
She began to eat slowly, remembered she was very hungry and shovelled the rest of the food into her mouth.
“Who?” he asked, incredulous.
She looked away and continued to the kitchen. She knocked the old bread and cereal aside, going for the cans instead. She found a can opener in a drawer and opened them, sniffing the contents: beans, peaches that were close to turning foul, Hormell tamales; before she ate them cold, looking curiously around the kitchen.
Dean stared at him, a crease appearing in his brow.
She took Ethan’s hand and walked him up the hallway to his room. Crowley followed them both without comment, lurking just outside the door as she settled Ethan in her old bed and tucked him in, kissing his forehead.
“Holy shit,” he whispered and ran back to Castiel, “You killed a demon. Like a real one.”
Dripping with black blood, she inspected her gory prize, a black claw the length of her forearm, sharp and glinting in the sun.
She couldn’t resist laughing at him again, “Jesus, didn’t you need to be able to handle a gun as a demon-king? Or did you just snap your fingers at everybody?”
The door to the house swung open and a pale creature emerged, stretching in the morning sunlight. His wispy hair was wild and dirty. As he walked out into the yard the sun shone behind him, lighting it up like a halo about his head. Even with his mouth split open to make room for all those fangs, she recognized the angel he had been: Astor.
“No, I’ll figure something out.”
“A week at least. He is so young and small. He does not have endless blood to give.”
Dean grimaced, “I know you are, Sammy.”
She screwed up her little face and pouted, thinking. “Wait, can I ask you a question?”
“You are going to have to trust me at some point,” he said, grabbing her wrist.
“I miss my mom too.”
He sighed and nodded, “Yes, that seems for the best. Where are they kept?”
“I’ll be alright,” she said, with no idea if that were true, “I’m gonna clean up the kid. There’s whiskey in the library if you want it.”
She felt she would always be moving along. She needed a new heading, something to aim for even if it was frivolous.
“I’ll teach you to drive it.”
Instead he watched her eat her bowl of Lucky Charms and drink the sugar milk. Halfway through she was flagging, by the time she finished she lay her little head on the tabletop.
Dean handed over the needle and sutures, “Here you go then, if you wanna help. Sew me up.”
“Yes.”
She mumbled and nodded but didn’t remove herself from Cas’ shoulder.
Dean laughed and scooped her out of her chair, swinging her in the air and catching her properly, “What? Course not. Nobody’s got a cooler car than us.”
She slashed wildly, Baby Ray blood spraying out as she struck home. Astor stumbled but did not fall. Claws bit across her back, slitting open her jacket to flay her skin. She screamed, falling to the grass and rolling away from the savage, clawed feet.
“No, as you’ll see if you threaten me with any more bookends.”
“You will be good at it.”
She had her shot but ran instead, pelting through the grass toward her bike. Castiel roared after her, wing already healed over. She mounted her bike and shot wildly behind her, hearing him screech and fall again. It bought her time to kick the bike into life and move.
“Where are you going?” Crowley asked, lazy smile on his face.
The usual revulsion at beholding these soulless bodies welled up under Bobby’s skin when she drew near, but the situation was too close to how she had found Eddy and Mary to give in to it. She edged forward, looking at them, the boy was in denim overalls that hadn’t yet rotted away, the tiny girl was halfway beneath her brother, her clothing so small there were still snaps at the shoulders.
“Traitor!” She laughed and leapt up, purposefully slow on her feet so Ethan could tag her and jet off.
“You got a couple of allies left.”
“Sammy, let the guy rest. A demon nearly demolished him.”
She lifted her eyebrows, “Ethan Snider was Chronos. A god. A time-traveller.”
Cas looked up at him, face illuminated by the streetlight now that they were out of the alley, “Only if you must.”
“Nah,” Dean said, so tired he said what was on his mind, “Stay.”
“A truly idiotic idea.”
She took a moment to lay back on the hot concrete and close her eyes, liking the yellow sunshine through her eyelids. It reminded her of summer days with her father. He would practice shooting outside and she would lay across the warm trunk of the Impala and sleep.
She looked at Crowley who had come up beside her, “Crowley, he’s freezing.”
“Are you sure you want to talk about this in front of your daughter?” Cas asked.
He got Castiel’s arm over his shoulder and helped pull him up. Castiel whimpered and leaned against him pitifully. “Alright, I’m gonna take you back to my room, Cas.”
“...Ah, thought he’d make it longer.”
“You’re a soldier?”
She didn’t have anything else she could say to him. At least they were
! It just sucked.”
“Two cans of soup, spoiled probably,” Crowley reported.
starve and one was more starved than this one over a year ago… then either they have a food source or they starve at way different speeds.”
“Run or hunt?” He asked, watching the skies.
“Yes, Dean.”
Her gaze snapped to him, “Shut it about my dad.”
“All practicality and no panache. I’m sure we could find you something more flattering.”
Dean watched him, belatedly calling out for Bobby, “Breakfast!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We discovered a weak point, I did not discover what had created the weakness, but it allowed us to break the walls and pour through and begin the battle in earnest. I lost many soldiers fighting through their ranks. Your father even fought me, when last I reached him.”
“Gotta get the fuck outta here.”
“Who-who are you?” He flexed his fingers around the handle of the knife. He didn’t know what sort of thing messed up the lights and hid in alleys.
“About the Leviathan, working with Crowley.”
“Burn through all that grace of yours?” She taunted, scuttling backwards now that she was unarmed, trying to get to her bike. It leapt at her and she tumbled back down the ditch, scrambling up its embankment ungracefully while the creature pulled its claws from the mud where it had landed. She ducked when its wing tried to catch her, falling to her stomach on the tarmac to avoid it, scraping her knees and palms.
“It’s their name in Enochian. Don’t make me say it again.”
“Thaddeus,” the companion answered, “The boy is tired. We cannot drain him now. Hannah will need to stay hungry.”
Dean slid his hands up Cas’ shirt and held his waist, tongues sliding together
Something touched Bobby’s face, waking her up. Adrenaline spiked through her body and she struck before she consciously decided to, hand curling around the handle of the knife under her pillow and slashing at whatever had gotten in.
“Excuse you, I look impeccable.”
“That’s just tag!” She said happily, “I’m the best at tag!”
“Yeah and Mary and Eddy.”
Dean got up and headed out into the freezing Michigan winter. Maybe he could con his way into a bar and try to hustle pool again. He couldn’t steal food for the whole week if they didn’t have a car to skip town. He shoved his hands in his pockets and chewed his lip. Bar it was.
“Want me to tell you about my dad? I miss him.”
“Hey!” Sam said, very much not laughing and plucking Bobby off of his son, “What’s going on?”
Dean picked Cas up, Cas’ legs wrapped around Dean’s waist as he carried him out of the Library and down the hall toward his bedroom.
“Yeah, yeah, so Ethan gets the same curse as his dad, jumping unpredictably through time. But he goes too far forward, ends up here. His dad could probably figure out what to do, dodge the monsters until he skips outta here. But the kid gets found right away.”
“Because I took the spell ingredients and won’t let you kill Ethan… I won’t really kick you out of the Bunker, you know.”
She reeled back, horrified, “No.”
“They’re my favorite, what’s your favorite?”
“That was a dirty trick,” he scowled, “Didn’t daddy teach you any manners?”
She opened the journal and flipped to the back where she’d added pages for her own notes. She’d moved the pages with the relevant hunts back there too to make a little time travel section. If they were going to do this, then she wanted everything she could find on time travel in one spot. As a Winchester, it was easy to get caught in tight spots with no time to leisurely browse for crucial information.
He leveled the gun at Cas, who stared at it, still leaning all bloody on the wall. Dean opened the flask and tossed some of the holy water on him.
“Yeah, get out of here.” She slid off his lap and let him kiss the top of her head then she raced off.
Dean laughed, “Alright, I sort of got my ass kicked. I’m all better now, thanks to you. I ought to reward you.”
She slid the knife back into her belt and stood up, Crowley lifted an eyebrow and smiled but she turned the other way, “I’m gonna check the door.”
“Do you know how to hunt?”
“...Dean?” Sam asked, unsure.
Dean made a face at her and handed her a napkin, “His name’s Cas, we -uh, we go way back.”
Crowley nodded to himself, “Being a god would explain why he can see my real face. And what Castiel was doing with his blood.”
“It was very simple, I told her a story as you suggested.”
His eyes widened and he followed after Bobby as she bolted up the stairs with Ethan and down the long hall to the garage.
“Yeah. Six months old.”
The big man, burly and six and a half feet tall, flannel stretched around his muscles, reached out and seized Dean’s arm.
Cas glared at him, “I beat the demon didn’t I?”
“Alright,” Crowley said, smirking despite himself, “Why wouldn’t the boy just have disappeared? Eventually doesn’t he get taken to another time like his father?”
“Can you blame me for being worried? You didn’t come with great news. It’s not like you came down asking to stay because you missed me.”
“It is, but we don’t need much.”
It was still plenty light enough that shoving the sliding door open flooded the floor with light. She shot at the movement in the corner on instinct, hitting it squarely. The shuffling animal fell bloody to the dirt. She left it for now, taking a slow circle around the barn for anything else, then slinging the rifle across her back to climb the ladder into the loft.
“I don’t know how we’re gonna get out of this one,” Bobby said, voice breaking.
“Yes, I would like to hear more about your hunt.”
Dean couldn’t sleep all night, he let Cas have the other bed and made Sam share. Sam was out like a light but Dean just stayed up, watching Cas sleep.
She looked at him, his own face imploring, “Use your sense, Winchester, don’t be naive.”
She screamed in delight and tagged him before pelting away. Cas tilted his head and smiled, before walking after her, “Yes, very good, Bobby.”
Cas met his eyes, “I - I was supposed to allow them to take Sam. I was sent to observe weeks ago. As part of my training before I am assigned a garrison.”
“How are those healing?”
“I’m Dean Winchester,” He said, pulling the kid to sit up.
She rifled through the cupboards, pushing aside fetid flour and brown sugar that was like a rock, pulling out a canister of salt.
“Hey, kiddo,” she said softly, forcing herself to her knees beside the youngest child, “I’m sorry. This is all I can do.”
She left him on the couch and walked to the fireplace, squatting to stir her Spaghetti-o’s. “It’s morning. Gotta move,” she said again.
“Not looking your best,” Bobby mumbled, circling it, lashing out with her knife every time it tried to strike, “What? Can’t clean yourself up? Seen you do it, what’s wrong now?”
“What the hell are you doing?” Crowley asked.
“Castiel?”
He listened too and scowled, “Wings. I suppose you’ve got that knife you made.”
“Hunter’s funeral.”
Dean unzipped the med pack and laced a needle to sew it closed, “This is gonna hurt.”
“Course you can, want me to tuck you in?” Bobby asked. Hearing the parental words coming from her own mouth made her feel strange. She recognized maybe she should feel like she was stepping into her father’s shoes, but she didn’t. She felt a lot more like Cas, not sure what to do. Her father was always so certain.
“Can we go get something to eat?” Sam asked, “Might be warmer at a restaurant or even just a grocery store.”
“Your foot’s sticking out, goofball,” he said, picking her up when she scampered over, “So you heard us, huh? I’m gonna be gone for a few days, Cas is gonna look after you.”
Dean could feel that it was a mistake while he made it, but that didn’t stop him. For no reason he could articulate he went way out on a limb for this kid who said he was an angel and killed demons, “Don’t call dad. Cas asked me not to.”
“You know that mark on your arm? We’re looking for a way to take it off. Then, when you’ve got your mojo back, we can all get out of here. If we can get back to a time with more people to help I bet we can even get you back to your mom.”
A strained voice responded from the ground behind the dumpster, “Yes.”
She looked up at her father who smiled at her so she smiled at Cas too, “You gotta check all the sigils before I go to sleep.”
to attack
He glared at her petulantly, “We get the boy and go to the Bunker. They must not be able to get in.”
Nothing happened.
“K, so what happens next?”
She whooped and giggled before snuggling happily into her father’s arms, “Why’s he staying here?”
He snatched a book up off the library table and smiled devilishly, “The spell won’t take ten minutes.”
Crowley’s smile was all teeth, “The food alone will be magnificent, can you even remember the taste of fresh food?”
She squared up, shooting again, aiming at its face.
She spent an hour looting the other houses in the cul de sac, then siphoned some gas for her bike before heading back out.
“Yeah!”
“What are you gonna do? Don’t steal again.”
“The fuck did you just say?”
Cas sat up and pulled up his shirt, peeling back the bandage to reveal healthy, unmarred skin, “Yes, it appears your tending did me well.”
“Oh, kitten, if you’d seen what I have you would know that when an apocalypse starts you should always look for a Winchester at the center of it.”
He stumbled over his words, “Dean- I-” his nerve failed him, “Why did your relationship with Bobby’s mother fail?”
He shot again and the bottle remained right where it was.
Bobby frowned and crouched down to his level, brushing the hair out of his eyes, “You don’t want to see your mom again? I thought she was nice.”
The man walked straight toward him and Dean came to a halt. He thought he was ready for this. Holy shit.
Cas sat beside him and left his hand on his face, fond as anything, “Barely, you got your ass kicked.”
“You mind if I stay here?”
She took them to a supermarket first, parking the bike and getting her sawed-off, checking and loading it first as always before she was ready. Crowley didn’t move. She watched him expectantly.
“It’ll just be a few days, you sure you’re ok with her?”
“You want to? With me and Bobby?”
She looked over, tilting her head in confusion, “No.”
“I heard you praying to me,” Cas growled into Dean’s ear.
“....I know what state we’re in.”
As she knew it would, the sound of the gunshot split the quiet air. Red burst from where the deer had been hit but she’d hit its belly, not its heart. The deer bolted, blood splattering the grass where it ran.
Two shots left, but the weapon worked.
“Nah, this one’s on you,” Dean said, finally freeing him of his tie.
“What?” She shouted back, pelting into the room at full speed, launching off a chair and vaulting the table. She landed and rolled behind a bookshelf, smirking and huddling against it like she was hiding.
“Cas? You know Castiel?”
She drew her leather handled dagger-claw and scampered back enough to stand, swinging it at Sarathiel and clipping her forearm. She screamed again and Bobby’s vision went black at the edges. It was not particularly loud, but it felt unnatural, her very soul shivered as her wounded shoulder stung like it was fresh.
She opened her mouth to reply then closed it, cocking her head to the side, “Crow, you hear that?”
“What the hell do you mean, it’s mine?”
She walked through the gathering dark to a tree beneath the once-white house. Clover grew here among the grass. She laid the child down and righted her little toddler skirt. She returned  to the barn for the brother, laying the siblings beside each other.
“Old peaches, bad; beans, ok. Just black beans.”
A smile curved Castiel’s lips, “He turned his knife upon me and stabbed me. Fortunately, his paltry weapon could do very little.”
Dean stared him down, wanting to be angry, but his anger died looking at Cas’ contrite, sorrowful expression. He sighed, “Are we good?”
“What?”
“Tonight, it’s important.”
The grocery store had been looted while everything was happening, so the best things were gone and anything fresh was long rotten. They wouldn’t even be able to rely on the canned goods soon. It had been too long.
Dean clapped Cas on the shoulder, grinning at him, practically bouncing with glee, “Change of plans, Cas!”
“She’s three, she’s gonna sleep through it. You wanna hold her?”
, Crowley, that’s why I asked you.”
She laid her head against the cool metal of the door when she’d touched the last perfect sigil. She needed to get up. But it was so much easier to stay here, head pressed to the cool metal, even when she could hear the threat scratching at the door. She touched her Wounds and sank deeper into a trancelike state, becoming so still she almost felt unable to move.
“Bothers me!”
She nodded, “We don’t have long.”
The monster lurched and she struck, slamming its own claw through its chest. It screeched and smokey light flashed in its eyes and out of its mouth as it shook and finally fell to the ground. The dread that had choked like a suffocating cloud had dissipated; the body on the ground now nothing but old meat.
That's how Castiel found him when he approached, passing the car. His breath caught in his chest, the angel braced himself for something that was more terrifying to him than
"I know that, Sam." Dean said, keeping his calm.
"Considering angels do not really need sleep, I'd say I slept pretty well." Cas replied with a smirk.
"I will go wherever is necessary." Castiel replied.
"It's a turn of phrase, I guess. It just means I care aboutcha and just.." Castiel stared into Dean's eyes, unblinking. "I just wanted to know, that's all." Dean finished.
"Same. Go get 'em Tiger."
Dean gulped, then made for his beer again. Castiel's eyes did not leave Dean's face.
Dean continued to walk in the forest near the cabin with the bar inside.  He realized that he couldn’t feel heat from the Sun bearing down upon him or wet air making him sticky in his clothes that would have been inappropriately heavy for such a hike back on Earth.. He could get used to this, he thought to himself, as he sat down on a huge rock overlooking a green expanse of grass in a clearing in the forest.
answer. Even at the cost of my Grace. Good night." Castiel said, turning his back on her.
Dean inhaled and adjusted his grip on the steering wheel before answering, "I don't think so. Maybe. I haven't really looked at other guys-like that. At least not much."
Castiel stood up, "I'm sorry, Metatron, I cannot continue to have this conversation."
Castiel looked at him with resolve and he said,"I did mean that, Dean."
Castiel regained some composure, "It's not like that at all."
Staring intently back at Dean, Castiel's neck angled in a way that was not natural for any person to do. But that was Cas.
"Well now that's not true there was-" Bobby started, and all three were staring at him and so he quickly finished "-that one time." And moved on "Look, I just thought that with your friend here, we could all enjoy a nice meal before y'all go about your business."
Night Bobby." Dean yelled, seeing Bobby raise his glass to him from across the room, he mounted the stares to the spare bedroom.
Mimicking Dean’s hand movement, she brought his chin up to meet her gaze. “It’ll be ok. It always is here, one way or the other.” Being the empathetic friend that she is, Charlie didn’t press or make him feel like he was on the spot. She stood, wished him good luck, and then walked back towards the tall grass rather than back in the direction of the road. And just like that, she was gone and all that was left from where she’d been standing last was ethereal light.
me tell you this. Your actions this time in giving yourself to this ape are unforgivable and you have transgressed upon our sacred laws. The only blessing
“Dean, you have nothing to apologize for. We will figure it out together. No regrets.”  Cas said wiping Dean’s cheeks.
Taking a deep breath, inhale....exhale..."You think you can stay with me?"
Dean rolled his eyes at Sam for the hundredth time as Sam tried to "headshrink" him again as they drove the Impala to Bobby's house. They were attending a rare and much needed gathering of the hunters in their circle to celebrate a downward slope in demonic activity. They all knew the bell would eventually swing in the other direction sooner or later, so no time like the present to get together for work without working.
Dean stared at him. Before he could say anything in response, Cas said, “I think it’s possible that I loved you sooner. But I didn’t know what it was I was feeling before then.”
Bobby smiled, eating and watching things unfold.
"Dean, I have watched enough of the Netflix to know that we should not be engaging in physical activity yet." Cas chastised.
"I am interested in you Dean." Castiel replied.
Jo didn’t even need to punch a hole in that one. For all of his efforts to keep things unseen, Dean was actually quite see-through to anyone that knew him. Jo said, simply and gently, “You need to go talk to him. It’s been long enough.”
Castiel replied, "I'm glad you did. I look forward to our next meeting, Dean."
Castiel had known this, logically, but for the first time he now understood. Could it be like this forever? Is there more?
"No, no, no, no." Sam said quickly. "Dude, come on. There's nooo way you just stumbled into this thing with Cas."
"Look, it just happened. Wasn't planning this. 'Aight?" Dean said.
Castiel looked at Dean, smiled and then picked up his silverware to eat some eggs. Dean was taken aback: wait, had Cas done that on purpose?
“I’m gonna be there to tell him.” Dean declared, making for the door and wiping his eyes on the back of his sleeve.
Sam watched this and winced, wishing Dean was capable of being this demonstrative always. At least with him.
Dean’s jaw tightened. John continued,”And I hurt and I was angry all the time. It’s a lousy excuse. But if there’s one lesson I should’ve taught you, it’s that if you do find that person that loves you completely-you fight like hell to hold onto them.”
At that, Dean smiled again, and Castiel was pleased. Dean regarded the angel in front of him before saying softly. "I'd like to try somethin' between us, Cas. If you'll have me."
left you before."
“Hello, Dean.”
Trying not to overreact and with no need to rush, because he knew his brother would be up and doing anything and everything he could if there was even a remote possibility that Cas could be brought back, Sam gently asked, “Can you tell me how?”
“Well, I have known that I loved you since I escaped Heaven’s control. It was my love for you that broke me free of them.” Cas said softly.
After briefly hearing without much detail that Castiel had been under the sway of other angels, Dean asked, "What broke the connection?"
When the kiss grew to something too heated for him to stare without having a reaction, he cleared his throat to announce his presence.
She smiled wryly at him and took a seat next to him and he naturally shifted the angle he was sitting to face her. They talked about things that had occurred after her death, and the differences in apocalypse Charlie compared to the one he had always known. She smiled wistfully while listening to him tell her about her alternate self and her relationship with Kara. After it became apparent she was lost in thought, Dean brought her back to the conversation by gently lifting her chin to look at him. “Not everyone ends up with someone in the end. You know there isn’t anything wrong with that right?”
He regretted not having the fortitude to stick around long enough to have seen Dean's reaction. He knew it wasn't fair the way he
Dean reached up and put his hands at Cas’ neck, thumbs along Cas’ jawline. The first tear fell from one of Dean’s eyes. “I’m yours if you’ll have me.”
"This is why we had to cleanse your mind repeatedly, Castiel. You are so arrogant in your beliefs that you think yourself above your superiors, well let
Dean blushed slightly, "Well, yeah. If you're interested."
Cas replied clearing his throat awkwardly, "Well, I did leave. And then I appeared in Dean's bedroom around-" Dean began choking on his food and then said, "Hey hey hey, we don't really need a play by play there Cas."
“No one has ever said that to you before, Dean. I know it’s always easier to give love than to receive it, but you were everything to him and he would have done anything for you. You had the love of an angel. Do you understand how incredible that is?” Sam asked.
After coming to as much of a centered view as one can through the biased reflection that a metaphorical mirror, Dean was able to glean readiness to connect with the first person that his mind focused on after he reached solid ground on himself.
"Oh, Cas saved Dean from hell once upon a time. They've had a "profound bond" ever since. That's all."
Castiel closed the distance, standing directly behind Dean. Dean felt Castiel gently draping his trenchcoat around Dean's shoulders.
“It’s hard for me to pinpoint the exact date and time but-”
Dean sighed, "Man, you know me so well. And you're still interested." Dean laughed.
Sam stood watching Dean in the shooting gallery at the Men of Letters Bunker. He stood watching Dean standing completely still, not having fired a shot in a while. His brother was so clearly deep in thought that Sam desperately wanted to interrupt him. To make him speak and tell him what was going on in there. He knew that it would likely start a fight or at the very least drive dean further into himself, and Sam had strength for neither. So he made to take his leave, but before he did, he spoke softly to Dean on his way out, "You
Dean suddenly stood. Sam looked at him straight on for the first time. He looked like hell, his eyes were red rimmed and he looked older than he had in awhile. However, Dean was determined again.
“How could I? You were always so far ahead of me I couldn’t catch up.” Cas said smiling.
Slightly intrigued, Dean said, "What the hell."
"Well then, better get me shut eye. Night Sam."
Dean smiled softly at that, feeling heat rise to his cheeks. "I can read you too, Cas. And you're right. There's sure as hell more."
"We can figure it out together like we always do." Dean said.
"Smart ass." Dean retorted, only just now withdrawing his hand.
"Hello, Sam. Dean and I were just kissing." Cas stated facts, as always. Dean put a hand over his head.
"Just wanted to make sure because you're changing the whole dynamic here."
Turning the key to his door, returning to his lare of endless worlds constructed through words on paper, "Marv" jumped when he saw who was waiting for him.
"You might wanna try going out to the bars a little less. Just take it one day at a time, there's no need to rush. I don't want to see either of you hurt." Sam said, truthfully, as he glanced at Dean.
Dean let out a choked sob and Sam moved behind Dean so that he could hold him. Dean didn’t resist him, but such was the depth of his loss.
Almost beyond visible recognition or speech that could be understood, Dean made one last plea to the friend that was killing him, "Cas. Cas.
"That's something I wanted to talk to you about, Cas." Dean said, steeling himself up for the next part.
Dean sighed. It was alot to unpack. "I wish you wouldn't talk about yourself that way. It's so mechanical. The body of the man you are in, I am attracted to him-to you. But I wouldn't be if you weren't in him. You-are the one I want. Does that make sense?"
"Now don't get yer panties all in a twist, just remember that you're here to be in good company with people who understand what it's like. Take advantage of that before you go feelin' sorry for yerself and have a good time, why don'tcha?"
