There was something more, he thought – something else he had meant to add. But the ground was rushing up to meet the soft sensation ghosting across his forehead, and he couldn’t bring the words to mind.
“…the use of ‘he’ in this section seems unnecessary and unclear,” Grant had continued, “and I think we should consider revising these paragraphs to make the language more inclusive.”
Two images enlarged on the holo table: what looked like an abandoned warehouse labeled “New Brunswick, New Jersey” and a mid-rise office building labeled “Toronto, Ontario.”
“You got shot again,” Tony said accusingly, quickly shimmying out of his jacket so he could press the fabric to the growing pool of red on Steve’s abdomen. “How did you make it in the army so long if you keep getting shot all the time?”
“Jesus. Fuck,” Tony cursed viciously. His expression had hardened in an instant, but his touch was gentle as he spun Steve toward him and pulled the fabric of away from the wound.
He growled in frustration at the silence on the other end and then stepped back, taking a deep breath to center himself. Objectively, they had been in far more dangerous situations. Not three weeks previously, for example, Steve had been held hostage for several hours by an office worker who thought his boss was turning people into zombies. Tony had harangued the FBI SWAT team in charge of extraction to within an inch of their lives, but in the end, Steve had managed to keep the gunman calm long enough to avoid any casualties. The former Captain Rogers was cool under pressure – not to mention a crack shot – and whatever was going on in this house, he was probably handling it more than capably.
“Over here, assholes,” he shouted, waiting a split second for two guns to pivot in his direction before he squeezed the trigger. The agent behind Tony dropped immediately, and Steve dove sideways to duck behind a couch. Just before he landed, a second shot rang out, and something that felt like a scalding pebble kicked through Steve’s lower left side. He was just adjusting his position to return fire when he heard a third gunshot, and his heart stopped.
"Uh. I don't think that'll work. I keep digging myself deeper. I'll just drive you into the snow and then roll back over you."
“How is he?” Tony asked, in what he thought was an admirably casual tone under the circumstances. “Other than toasted like a very chiseled marshmallow?”
wasn’t Tony’s speed. Either way, he got to have these moments of closeness – got to hold Tony in his arms, watch him come apart, maybe even brush his fingers across the calluses on Tony’s hands. That was more heat than he’d had since he’d woken up in SHIELD’s bad simulacrum of the world he actually belonged to. That was enough to get by on.
“Steve, what happened last night?” Tony asked, sitting up carefully and running his fingers over a fresh bruise on his right arm.
“Uhh,” he continued, eloquently, “right, the sketch. The sketch seems to have been completed sometime in 1943. It’s accessible nowhere in the world except for in the library of Brooklyn Community College, where Peggy Carter made a generous donation just before her death. On their own, many of the documents in the collection might look unremarkable - just another paper trail, plotting out the places where a human life brushed up against the bureaucracies of war - but it was by paying attention to the personal coordinates of these materials that I got turned on to the importance of the 107th infantry regiment…”
Tony stopped pushing, though his hands remained fisted in the shoulders of Steve’s jacket as the yelling around them slowly subsided. Steve took a series of deep breaths, drawing his attention to the scuttling of stilettos, the tinkle of dropped china: all the signs that he was on the floor of a New York ballroom, not huddled against a barricade in the desert, waiting for the air around him to explode.
Tony took a minute to throw his books and notepads haphazardly into his bag and then cleaned off the chalkboard with one hand while he pulled up the photos of his dad’s notebook on his phone with the other. By the time he walked out of the room, he was already swiping over to the final page - the one he’d transcribed as “making a new shield.”
"You've got til Monday, lady, and yes I'm fully aware Chi Omega is having a party on Saturday night, which means you're going to want to get it done by Friday." Tony sipped his coffee again.
“I’m okay, big guy,” she promised. “Steve and I are both okay, but we need the Doc right now to figure this out. So deep breaths.” She reached out slowly and took one of his hands in hers, running her thumb rhythmically against his palm. The green receded slowly from Bruce’s face as he followed her breathing.
“No that’s my fault,” Tony replied quickly. “I should have asked.” He held out the hand with the ice pack. “May I?”
“That building in Toronto was not short on personnel,” Natasha demurred. “Maybe not enough to take down a high-security target, but enough to give us another warning shot. I think it’s more likely the threat was a decoy than a bluff.”
"I may be slightly exaggerating, but I've never seen so many people in here at once." He leaned back in his chair and petted a leaf on Pepper's spider plant.
The silence stretched between them, the elevator doors still standing ajar, and then Steve felt Tony’s posture stiffen.
“But this is a wonderful event, my friends!” Thor boomed, and it sounded like he was getting ready to open his door until Natasha called out,
When the doors to the Tower elevator slid open, Steve walked through them without looking, his face still buried in a gym towel. He’d just gone through three reinforced punching bags in an effort to work off the frustration from his latest SHIELD mission, but even the resulting full-body ache wasn’t enough to weigh down the anxiety buzzing through his chest, and between the towel and the nerves, it took a moment for Steve to notice that the elevator was already occupied.
On the far side of the hall, Jasper Sitwell’s hand shot up, and Tony let out an involuntary groan which he hastily stifled with another cube of pilfered cheddar.
Steve started to cross his arms across his chest before realizing that he would risk crushing the biscuits. He settled for clasping his wrist with his free hand instead, widening his stance slightly and taking a deep breath. Come on, Rogers. Take it on the chin.
You know, the reason the Classics department isn’t allowed to meet without a mediator? These are not the actions of a man of peace. You don’t call for curriculum review in the Year of Our Accelerating Institutional Austerity, 2018 unless you want to see blood on the walls.”
Fuck. What had that looked like before hours of super-solider healing? Trust Steve to describe having half his head turned into a Rorschach painting as “receiving minor contusions.”
Steve placed the paper carefully on the counter and peeled off one of his gloves to retrieve his phone.
“Well then you’re officially one of us,” Tony replied, trying to add a quick smile to smooth over his abrupt departure. “Thanks for the coffee - and the one-man AAA roadside rescue. I owe you a drink...in a totally professional way. Something extremely neutral and workplace-appropriate: the Men’s Warehouse of drinks, if you will.”
“What do you need?” he asked softly, his hands hovering near Tony’s elbows but keeping a careful foot of distance.
“So what do you say, soldier?” Tony asked, a new, sharp note in his voice that cut through the narrow space between them like a shard of glass. “Can I give you the world’s most life-affirming blowjob? I’ll pull out all your favorite stops.”
“Huh,” Tony acknowledged. “Would you look at that? So that means – and I’m saying this totally casually, by the way – because there is definitely not a part of my soul that’s trying to crawl its way screaming out of my body at this observation – but that means these two corpses –”
Steve fought a wave of vertigo, feeling suddenly like he was standing in a muddy tent on the front, staring down Colonel Phillips over another map of what HYDRA had taken from him. He had to grit his teeth to push the scene back, and he found himself grabbing onto the image of Tony opening his eyes on the streets of New York – that one perfect moment when Tony breathed in again.
Steve startled, and it was a sign of how deep in his thoughts he must have been that Tony had caught him unawares.
He needed just one moment. His skull was pounding, but the sight of Tony – vibrating with energy, pinched with suppressed fear, but warm and pissed off and alive – was like coming up for air. Since he’d seen the footage from Malibu, Steve had been aching to see Tony’s chest rise and fall, to see the glow of the arc reactor that meant his heart was beating. The need had been so strong that Steve had barely been able to acknowledge it; and though he hadn’t let himself work out the odds, he knew this could be his last view. Maybe that’s why what came out of his mouth was:
So much for that theory, Tony thought ruefully, his stomach doing an utterly unforgivable somersault when Steve’s eyes caught his in the mirror.
“I ran bioscans on each floor as I came up,” he told them. “We’re alone for now. But if that blast was supposed to take us out, it won’t take long for whoever ordered the hit to figure out it didn’t work.”
“If these guys are too stupid to snap you up, I’d love to give you a crack at some real tech,” he told her with a wink. “I’ve got a decryption program that makes SHIELD cyber security look like a baby gate.”
. By the time Steve met Ward’s eyes, the agent’s expression was aloof, but Steve could swear he had caught a sharpness there just a second ago.
Tony let out a sigh of relief and pulled him gently to his feet, letting Steve keep pressure on his own side so that they could retrieve their guns. He hovered near Steve as they made their way into the stairwell, one hand ready to grab his shoulder if he needed support.
“You're going to tell us where to find Fury,” Ward commanded, cocking his gun and keeping it trained on Tony. “You’ve got until the count of five, and then I start shooting appendages.”
, Simmons had finished. Steve was already working it into position against the strap pinning his right wrist – he just needed a little bit more time.
“Giving SHIELD the supernatural strong-arm,” Tony said to Thor. “A bit surprising after how many times you volunteered for the ‘trust fall’ portion of Hill’s team-building exercises.”
“We should set a trap to draw out the remaining ornaments,” Steve decided. “I want eyes on the perimeter – where the hell
Steve sat back on his heels. Clint swore. The archer’s face looked as empty as it had in the briefing room, but there was something soft in the motion of his hands as he reached forward to close Harrison’s eyes. He had just finished when Tony flew through the open side of the helicopter, landing in a crouch. He didn’t raise his faceplate, and Steve wasn’t sure whether he could have met Tony’s gaze anyway. The Iron Man armor straightened, and Tony shot one furious repulsor blast out the door before turning to face the front window.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said with a sigh. “I know it was selfish of me to tell you that way. I shouldn’t have pressured you to say – I know you can’t feel the same way. But it doesn’t have to change anything. I mean, I can’t change how I feel, but I hope we can still be friends –”
“That’s like…the sixteenth time you’ve tried to fire me,” Steve said out loud, but he clasped Tony’s arm to signal his acquiescence. “Okay, help me up.”
Bruce smiled and shook his head, but any further reply was headed off by the arrival of a middle-aged man wearing the most nondescript suit Tony had ever seen. The new Dean of Faculty – Coulson, Tony heard someone whisper – gave a small wave from the front of the hall.
But he didn’t pause to hear the rest, because Tony had taken off after Simmons, and Steve stepped out after him. Tony beckoned for the two agents carrying the stretcher to stop, and as he leaned over Harrison’s body, the side of his face was just visible. The lines at the corners of his mouth were pinched tight, and Steve felt something painful squeeze through the numbness in his chest. As Steve approached, Tony straightened and waved the stretcher on.
He’d managed to wait to confront Tony until they’d made it out of the gala and back to the Tower, but it had been a close thing. Waves of adrenaline were still coursing through his body every time he remembered the moment, halfway through the dessert course, when he’d looked back from his scan of the dance floor to see that Tony had disappeared from his side. In the ten minutes before Tony reappeared again – hands full of whiskey sours and a blonde socialite in a plunging red gown – Steve had told Happy to seal the exits, called Fury to have agents on stand-by, and barely stopped himself from clasping Tony’s arms in relief when he finally recognized his voice. The more time had passed, however, the more the relief had given way to frustration. And by the time they made it back to the penthouse, Steve could feel his teeth grinding at the casual way Tony was tossing his jacket over the back of the couch.
Tony woke up to the feeling of a hand brushing softly across his forehead. It took a moment to register the shape of the fingers – and for some part of his brain to notice that they didn’t fit with the scenes his memory was conjuring – before he was shooting upward in a jolt of fear.
“When we meet again,” he boomed heartily, “I will have to hear more about your adventures with the Berseker staff. The last time I held it, I felt so crazed for battle that I tried to use my friend Volstagg as a javelin. I forgot we were in the banquet hall. Cleared a full seven-course meal with one toss.”
And the look on his face was so fond and smug (and hot) that Tony could have kissed him again right then — and for every day afterward.
“Excuse me for a moment,” Steve said, digging into his pocket to pull out the phone that had just started playing the chorus of “I Will Always Love You.” Steve had put up a show of annoyance about Tony’s new hobby of hacking his phone and changing his ring tone to songs from
"Yeah, but usually for other people, not me." Tony tried to pull out the spare chair with his hands full of coffee, but it was caught on the cable for Pepper's UV lamp. Pepper plucked one of the cups out of his hand. "Thanks." Tony wiggled the chair loose and sat down. He looked up to see Pepper sipping at the coffee. "Hey."
“Tony,” he managed as the floor tipped ominously toward him, “Fuck. You have to get out – please. Stay awake.”
“I’ve trusted May with my life on missions, and I’d do it again,” Natasha said finally. “But she was
And though no cross-examination the higher-ups could devise would ever drag the admission from him, Steve
“Tony,” Steve managed, feeling a halo of pain radiate up his scalp. “Are you okay? Was anyone hurt?”
“You know, I was managing just fine before this whole band of underemployed, overpowered babysitters moved in,” he said instead.
“Hey,” Tony repeated, and this time he gave Steve’s hand a tug, using his other hand to tap the spot where his arc reactor had been years ago. “Come here.”
“I didn’t know what we were dealing with yet,” Steve replied guardedly, still not meeting Tony’s eyes.
He had just caught up to the fork in the corridor where Steve had stopped, and Steve divided his attention between checking each direction for signs of Clint, Natasha, or Zemo and checking the rate of Tony’s breathing. They’d gotten caught by a wall of gas on the floor below, and based on the tightness in Steve’s own chest, he had to believe that Tony was feeling the effects more heavily than he was showing.
They shared a long look – searching each other’s expressions for confirmation of something neither of them could have named out loud – and then bolted for the door. Once they made it to the porch, they paused momentarily to notice that the dark stains had disappeared from their clothing. Tony reached out, as if to touch the undamaged fabric of Steve’s shirt, before pulling back. And then Steve placed a hand on Tony’s lower back, and they sprinted to their cars.
He took a deep breath of the remaining pocket of air and then swam back down to the bottom of the door, wedging the edge of the shield in the small gap where it met the floor. Bracing himself against the frame, he kicked down at the shield with as much force as he could. It was hard to get momentum under water, but the shield jolted enough to raise the door an inch. Steve knew it would get easier as water filled the corridor on the other side, so he watched through the window, staying as still as possible to conserve oxygen.
“Jesus Christ,” Tony breathed, lunging toward Steve and rolling Rumlow the rest of the way off of him. “You fucking idiot.”
“Oh, now he’s concerned about his well-being,” Tony muttered, ripping the lid off of a pudding cup and stabbing a plastic spoon into the dessert. “Where was that healthy sense of self-preservation when you were offering yourself up to your mortal enemies with a goddamn bow tied around your neck?”
“We all are,” Wanda added. “If Clint had told me being an Avenger would involve watching so much sad
“Oh yeah, solider? What’s that?” Tony asked, his voice teasing, and God, Steve wanted to say anything other than the words he had planned.
“Water’s not normally my style,” Rumlow mused, “but luckily SHIELD has been gathering very helpful information for us. So we know all about what the Ten Rings did to your little boyfriend. Did you hear about that? I’m happy to refresh your memory.”
“Well now you’ve definitely jinxed us,” Tony replied. “Everyone knows that when you’re inside the faculty meeting, you have to call it ‘the Scottish learning’ or it’s bad luck. Quick, leave the room and turn around three times while spitting over your shoulder. I’ll guard your cheese.”
“Whoever is running the Mandarin broadcasts, they’ve been using a new spread spectrum to hide their transmission locations. But I created a program that generates random frequency-hopping patterns and tests them against the spectrum. When I got my matches, I used them to make this.” Skye gestured to a world map, which had about a dozen blue dots in various countries. “Now some of these are almost definitely dummy signals, so I cross-checked each location against local chatter – police scanners, package deliveries, anything that might indicate a bunch of shady characters had moved into town. That left me here.” She clicked, and all but five of the blue dots disappeared.
“Luckily, Barton, little HALL-O here is solar-powered,” Tony said, patting the bot, which swiveled one if its laser-equipped arms toward him in response. “So you can all suck it, because tonight I’m going to be drinking the sweet apple cider of victory.”
"You know, he was mentioning how much he liked the live music at that new brewery, so I think you two would really get along." She winked. "Maybe even
Tony folded early this time around, partially because Clint was squinting one eye in a way that meant he was going to bet big, and partially because Tony wanted to watch Steve’s face as he checked the bet. Tony had learned more and more of Steve’s tells over the years: the vertical furrow between his brows that meant he was worried, the crossed arms that meant he was remembering something he couldn’t talk about. The data set grew regularly these days, filling out with the little signs that let Tony predict how Steve was going to move and what he was going to need. But still, for the life of him, Tony could not read whatever it was that flashed across Steve’s face in moments like this one, when he glanced up at Tony as he thumbed the edge of his cards. The expression came and went, leaving a sensation like a hot coal in the center of Tony’s chest.
The Avengers didn’t have the best track record with Thanksgiving. The first time the dinner had ended in disaster, it had been Steve’s fault. One rainy fall Sunday, just months after the Battle of New York, Steve had been picking at a bowl of mint-chip ice cream, feeling tired of getting looks of sympathy about the holidays and absolutely exhausted by feeling sorry for himself. If Bruce and Clint hadn’t chosen that particular afternoon to ask him whether there was anything special he wanted for Thanksgiving – raising the question with just enough gentleness to make Steve’s jaw tighten – he probably would have said, “I’m a sweet potatoes guy” and left it at that.
Tony was almost finished fashioning a battering ram out of a footstool, the fire poker, and three hacked-off chair legs when he became aware that someone was standing behind him. He took his time turning around and kept his face carefully neutral when he saw who it was: a gorgeous redhead, leaning against one edge of the demolished chair, her black dressing gown pulled slightly back to reveal the bullet wound in her stomach.
By the time Tony made it back to campus, it was in the awkward period between lunch and dinner, and Tony's stomach was in the middle of an argument between the probably-never-actually-met-a-poultry chicken nuggets he'd picked up when he stopped for gas and about fourteen liters of coffee. Deciding that adding sugar was the only way to make it a fair fight, he shouldered his bag and made his way to the Byrne Dining Hall.
“Yeah, me neither,” Tony agreed, at a loss to account for the nervousness in Grant’s posture. It seemed unlike him to keep it to himself if he'd hated the whole thing.
“Only about a dozen times a day during my final year of grad school,” Tony responded. “Though to be fair, that was more of an escape route than a research plan.”
“We don’t know each other very well, Dr. Stark,” Coulson continued. “But I don’t judge you to be the kind of man who tells tales about his colleagues out of school. So I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that you might have more pressing things on your mind than your colleague’s classroom performance - like, I don’t know, just to introduce an example chosen entirely at random: finishing the research talk you’re scheduled to give around this time next week?”
“You’re overreacting,” she said, raising her voice to be heard over the crowd of people gathered in the living room of the Delta Phi sorority house. “You’ve only been here for fifteen minutes. How much could you possibly have ruined?”
Thank you so much to everyone who has been reading and sending kudos/words of encouragement! Writing this has been a much-needed escape, and it means so much to know people are sharing it with me.
Tony noticed that Steve had to hide a small smile behind his hand and added a mental hash mark to the “Iron Man vs. Director That’s-Classified” tally that he kept running in his head during briefings.
of the old floorboards echoing the clock strikes, so that both sounds seemed to resound through the house. Steve’s jaw clenched – in annoyance and something else he preferred not to name.
Tony tapped the end of a pen against his cheek rapidly as he reread the page. He knew Carter had briefly worked at the S.S.R. office in Brooklyn, but he’d never heard of any connections to the community college.
“I know you don’t want to talk to me,” Steve continued doggedly. “You’ve made that very clear. But Bruce is worried about you. I’m – everyone is worried. I know I can’t stop you from treating your life casually, but you can’t ask us to watch you hurt yourself and do nothing.”
Great work so far, Steve thought grimly. Operation: Be Smooth, Rogers, For Once in Your Goddamn Life was obviously going to be a huge success.
"Look, James, I don't really understand what's going on here, but you're in danger. I think SHIELD is monitoring Stanley College. I don't know why, but you said something to me, and then right afterward - those men in the van? Look, I think maybe the Captain America initiative never ended, or they're still trying to… I'm not sure. But I think they're -"
“You’re awake,” he managed, wrapping one of his hands around Tony’s. “The doctor said you’d be out for hours, so of course you had to show him up.” His face pinched toward a smile and didn’t stick the landing.
“I’m going to make a fool of myself,” Steve muttered, staring at his reflection in the mirror with an expression that could only be described as morose.
Clint gave him the finger, and Natasha rolled her eyes. But Steve hummed non-committally in a way that sent off an instant warning bell in Tony’s mind.
With horrible precision, Steve’s memory conjured the moment Ward had caught him watching Tony – that sharp edge Steve had seen in his gaze. Ward had realized how Steve felt, and they had hurt Tony to get to Steve. The burst glass and the collapsed house with Tony trapped inside: it had all been because of Steve.
The web of sketched faces and redacted forms did not make more sense in the morning - nor did its comprehensibility increase in any noticeable way over the following month of occupying Tony’s study floor.
“Two.” Rumlow gripped the back of Tony’s head and shoved the tub into place. Tony let out a strangled sound.
Steve knew there was no way to be sure he wasn’t handing over the keys to a weapon of mass destruction, but it didn’t matter. He looked around at his team, his expression hard and desperate, willing them to understand: I made the sacrifice call once. I ordered you to close the portal. I can’t do it again – I’m not that strong.
On seeing the blood on Natasha’s face, Bruce let out a growl that sounded distinctly Hulk-y, his whole face going green in a flash. Natasha made her way toward him, speaking calmly as she approached.
“Yes, sir,” the cool voice acknowledged, his tone tinged with what sounded like the faintest hint of amusement. “System diagnostics show no indication of either an electrical or mechanical failure. I’m running further analysis now, but I do not believe you or Captain Rogers to be in any immediate danger.”
Steve cupped Tony’s face with his free hand, brushing a trembling thumb over Tony’s cheekbone. He had to fight down a wave of fear so acute he could barely breathe, his nerves screaming through every limb.
“Objectively scary stuff,” Clint nodded. “And what does it say about you that you came all the way out here to see it – on Christmas Eve – alone?”
“Strangely enough, I figured that part out,” James offered, the barest hint of a smile tugging at the side of his mouth.
Tony sighed so loudly that Steve turned back to face him, his forehead furrowed again, forming the little crease that Tony did
“I happen to know that Sharon’s interests lie elsewhere,” she explained, brushing her fingers along the side of her head, as if to tuck back strands of hair that had not actually gone astray. Tony blinked at her for a moment and then broke into a broad grin.
“I get shot all the time, Stark,” Clint said. He kicked his legs up onto the table: a move that Steve suspected was calculated to show Tony how quickly he was healing. “You’re not that special.”
“Ah ah!” Tony protested, “not so fast, Colonel I-Could-Outrun-A-Racoon. You’re going to tell me why it took me three years of research and forty-eight years of life to find out my father helped found some covert, document-redacting, archive-evading organization called SHIELD.”
If the contrast between the song and the scene struck the lone occupant of the car as ominous, his face didn’t show it. Not that anyone had ever accused Special Agent Tony Stark of having the stoic demeanor typical for a man in his line of work (indeed, most of the critical notes in his FBI records were variations on the theme of “stunning lack of professional decorum”). But at the moment, Tony’s short bursts of energy appeared to be focused almost exclusively on a small flip phone and a bag of dried blueberries. Each glance down at the phone was followed by a quick shot of blueberries or a rapid beating of fingers across the bottom of the steering wheel – the cycle proceeding according to some internal rhythm that seemed incompatible with the tempo of holiday radio.
Grant’s brow furrowed, and he shoved the last notebook into his bag with so much force that the leather creaked ominously.
Harrison nodded slightly, and Steve pulled the trigger as smoothly as he could. Harrison gasped, his eyes going wide as the chemicals hit him. The men were almost at the door now, so Steve couldn’t offer Harrison much time to recover before he pressed the rifle into his hand and pulled him to his feet.
“Yeah, you were doing so well that you blacked out in your garage after dropping your suit through several stories of your home,” Clint pointed out with a grin. “We’ve all seen the footage.”
“No,” Steve said firmly, at the same time that Clint exclaimed “arm wrestling,” and Tony answered “square roots.”
“Yep,” Steve answered, leaning down to kiss Tony’s forehead. “I love that you make messes,” a kiss on the right cheek, “I love that you invite messes to move in,” a kiss on the left cheek, “I love that since I met you, you’ve made every mess of mine your mess too,” a final kiss – as gentle as Steve could make it – on Tony’s lips. “I love you, Tony.”
Tony was relieved when he heard the cafeteria doors close behind him again. Grant could go back to charming the entire student body and faculty with his stupid hair and his
He watched Tony’s face go from confused to hurt to angry as he spoke, all the gentleness disappearing from his features.
“Steve!” Tony yelled, throwing the rifle aside and falling to his knees in front of Steve. Gentle hands brushed over the sides of Steve's face, and a distant part of his mind registered that he should really be able to see the hands - that the hallway shouldn't look like it was collapsing in around him.
“I had a plan. I was going to ask you to dinner: some place nice, but not so nice that I wouldn’t know what kind of wine to order us. I was going to tell you that I don’t have much practice with taking my time – don’t have much practice having time to take, really – but that I wanted to take my time with you. And then I was going to see whether you’d have me. I had the whole thing mapped out. I actually tried step one on your legs –”
Steve hauled himself upward, ignoring a new string of profanities from Tony, who moved quickly to brace Steve's shoulder and hold him upright. Steve ran his eyes quickly around the room. Luckily, HYDRA’s hideout was not up to code, because the overhead lighting was connected to a circuit breaker through cables of exposed wiring. Steve gestured toward the wall.
Tony shrugged and took a deep sip from each coffee to keep them balanced. He restacked them, shifted his bag back onto his shoulder, and walked the other way, to the far end of the row. He turned back towards Pepper's office and nearly collided with someone else. "Good lord. I've never seen this place so packed. Are they giving out free weed in the foyer?"
He stood up and walked over to the open doorway, standing casually in a space where minutes before there had been nothing but brick.
Tony grasped Steve’s forearms, whether to steady himself or out of surprise, Steve couldn’t tell. But he didn’t let go; so when Steve stood up from his lunge, he found that he was looking down into Tony’s eyes from very close range, his fingers still pressed against the slivers of skin exposed at the hem of Tony’s shirt.
“What? Boy Genius, you’re killing me with this monkey,” Tony responded. “You built a set of automated forensic drones in your dorm room and you’re coming to me with monkeys. Coulson, I’m hiring your team.”
“’Twas the night before Christmas,” Tony began, “forty-three years ago, and our erstwhile colleagues at the Bureau were filled with the spirit of the Cold War season. That made for a decidedly un-jolly holiday for the owners of this house, one of whom had just been IDed as a Soviet spy – code name the Black Widow – and was about to be arrested on suspicion of treason. So on a cold winter’s night, they made a lover’s pact: that no hands but their own would ever tear them apart.”
“Remind me never to sign up for a mission on Christmas again,” Tony groaned as he eased his way back under the blankets. He settled in a few feet away from the small mountain of fabric surrounding Steve, only to wince when a spring in the couch connected with his bruised tailbone. “I’m getting too old for this.”
She tossed him the keys and then sauntered over to curl up in one of the chairs by the fireplace, pulling her shins toward her chest so she could rest her chin on her knees.
, Tony found himself thinking, but the noises around him were fading too fast for him to be sure if he’d said the words out loud.
Morale seemed to improve after Tony emerged from his workshop, but the team remained on edge as the final days of the Mandarin’s one-week timeline elapsed.
“Yeah, so I’m just going to…go be over there now,” Tony said, in what he felt was an impressive display of self-possession for someone staring at the retreating ass of Steve Rogers.
“You’re messing with our heads,” Tony replied, keeping his gun trained on the other man’s chest. “And I don’t know if this whole ‘House of Usher’ vibe you’ve got going on is a cover for something more sinister – or if someone’s been experimenting with some very dangerous imaging technology – but you need to tell me what the
“I could say the same thing to you, pal,” a voice said behind him, and Tony whirled around, gun raised.
“That was a little rude,” Grant observed as Tony pulled him away, though Tony noticed his shoulders relaxing as they moved away from the table and the active threat of extracurricular strategy games.
“Help us understand it, then,” Steve retorted. His shoulders hadn’t relaxed in the slightest, and his jaw was clenched as he leaned forward across the table toward Fury. “You want us on the mission, so tell us what we’re helping you protect.”
Exaggerating the protective curl of his body, Steve let his mind go cold and quiet under the pain as he timed the rhythms of Ward and Rumlow’s hits: kick, kick, hook, pause, kick, kick – now. Steve grabbed Rumlow’s fist as it descended, twisted, and hauled it backward, using the momentum to break the arm, pull Rumlow’s throat forward, and slam it into his waiting elbow. In almost the same motion he rolled Rumlow’s body toward Ward’s incoming kick. Ward was momentarily thrown off balance when his foot landed sooner than expected, and Steve used the opportunity to grab the gun he had tucked into his holster. Rumlow was trying to strike back at him now with his unbroken arm, so Steve slammed the butt of the gun into the back of his head, dropping him.
“Okay,” Tony said, “I am willing to admit that putting repulsors on the Iron Man ornaments was not my best idea.”
“I would do a lot of things differently, Tony, but not this,” Steve said instead. “I would make this choice every time. Now please, go. I told you if someone came for you, we would be there. Let me keep my word this time.”
“I made them mention the donations in the announcement because I hoped someone would come,” he reiterated. “I watched Rogers out-stubborn asthma attacks, scarlet fever, and half the assholes east of Manhattan, and no one was ever able to tell me why everything that’s left of him can fit in this box.”
Steve stood in the middle of the library, staring at the remains of the doors he’d kicked down, arms crossed in contemplation. He hadn’t been able to raise Tony by shouting through either of the room’s exits, and he still wasn’t sure whether moving through the identical rooms was getting him farther away from their original entry point or getting him nowhere at all. Half of his instincts were telling him to stay put: when you’ve gotten separated from your men, running around without a sense of direction only makes it worse. The other half were screaming at him to tear through every door of the house until he found his partner, because absolutely anything could be happening to Tony, and how dare you sit around here, Rogers – if you don’t move your ass before you’re too late again, you’d never survive it, and who could say you’d even deserve to –
“Bring the fancy crackers!” Clint yelled, his voice muffled by the cushion he’d dragged off the couch and face-planted into. “No wait!” He lifted his head, revealing the beginnings of an impressive shiner over his left eye. “Make tater tots!”
Steve heard the sound of wheels clacking along the floor, and when Rumlow came back into view he was pushing a cart holding a set of tools and a deep metal tub. Tony’s eyes widened, and he leaned backward slightly in his chair.
James fingers twitched on his lap, and Tony looked up to see all the colour had drained out of his face.
She paused a moment more, murmuring something in Russian, and then she turned to carry Tony toward the exit.
Tony started moving immediately, and Steve placed one hand lightly on his chest to remind him to stay close. When they got to their feet, Steve ran through a rapid inspection of their surroundings, his fingers still brushing over the lapels of Tony’s tux. Most of the guests had been escorted out of the room by Happy’s team by now, with just a few stragglers gawking around the exits. Pepper was exchanging heated words with the man in charge of door security, who looked like he was seriously considering changing his name and leaving the country.
“I’m Clint, by the way,” the man offered, settling himself into one of the chairs and kicking his feet up on a side table.
Tony answered by grabbing a fistful of Steve’s shirt and pulling him into a kiss. It was open and hungry in a way that had Steve pressing forward, holding tighter to Tony’s waist as they tangled together.
Natasha reached up to take his hand, which had gone tense as it hovered at the side of her head, and gave it a squeeze.
“I mean, feel free to take an ogle to go,” Tony continued, his voice slowing to a teasing drawl. “It may shock you to hear this, but I don’t mind the attention. Go ahead: get your fill. I’d say ‘no sweat,’ but you’re clearly past that point.”
“Or he thinks he has another way of getting them,” Natasha mused, picking a tempura roll off Thor’s plate. “And he wanted us to be looking for an explosion instead.”
It was, however, the first time that Steve had encountered Tony sleeping in a way that left him quite so open to the element of surprise. Steve slung his gym towel around his neck, moved carefully into a spotting formation, and then called out the words “expense reports” in a clear, slightly urgent tone.
“Well, the joke’s on him, darling,” Tony said, running his thumb up and down along the edge of Steve’s hand. “Because I’m going to make sure you get every last drop out of this ‘til death do us part’ business. I swear to God. I’m going to get you thrown out of so many government offices: you’ll feel like you’re flunking the draft again.”
"The students are fine, Tony. They're after me. Which is why you need to go." James grabbed Tony's arm and started dragging him out of his office.
"I know, but at least this way I can tell myself I'm trying to teach you a valuable life lesson about procrastination."
hadn’t hacked into Steve’s mission report, so there was no way he could have known that Steve and Natasha had barely avoided an explosion in the computer bay of the ship they’d infiltrated.
“My apologies again, friends,” Thor beamed at them, tipping an extra pour of New Holland Ichabod into Bruce’s glass. “But the resulting explosion was quite spectacular.”
“Electrified,” Steve started to say, but the word cut off in a hiss when the metal bands snapped apart and Steve sagged forward into Tony’s arms.
Steve realized he had been staring at the nervous, precise way Tony’s fingers beat out the tempo of his thoughts, always just a bit faster than his words. He tore his eyes away, only to notice that Ward had been watching
No one had ever accused Tony Stark of being too patient. So when the team had to wait a full twenty-four hours for news about whether their latest mission had been a success, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him that Tony’s response was not what they might call “chill.”
“I submit that I am taking this exactly as seriously as it deserves to be taken,” Tony retorted, leaning back in his chair and scrolling idly through his phone. “This is not my first proverbial rodeo, Pep. I broke a hundred death threats before I got my learner’s permit. That’s why I have Happy. That’s why I have a whole security team – not to mention a decorated Air Force Colonel who, I happen to know, loves to be called at all hours of the day when I need the smallest little thing. So really, I fail to see why this threat is any different from the last dozen or so would-be Lone Gunmen just because the person who sent the tip used an embarrassingly childish codename.”
"I…" Dr. Grant's cheeks flushed slightly. "I thought you two were arguing in the library earlier, and I wanted to make sure she was okay. She assured me she came out the victor."
“Not when I knew him,” Arnie retorted, waving his hand again to indicate that Tony should take a seat. “When I knew him, he was taking night classes in life drawing and getting his scrawny ass handed to him behind every brownstone in the borough. The skinniest, scrappiest son of a bitch I’ve ever seen.”
“Seems like you all come as a package deal,” Tony reflected, his eyes softening as he glanced to where Fitz had drifted back toward Simmons. “I can understand that.”
"I'm not the one in trouble," Tony breathed. He sat so they were knee to knee. "Okay. So let me explain this. I found this note in my dad’s things - after you mentioned something about SHIELD - and at first I thought it was a code name for a weapons project, but now I know it’s a whole goddamn secret government agency -"
Steve did know what she meant. It was how they worked in the field: he took the brunt of the frontal assaults while she watched his back to catch the knife between the shoulder blades. And it wasn’t just Steve. It had seemed natural to all of them to trust Natasha to be the eyes in the back of their heads. But there was no way she could have seen this coming. Steve was the only one who knew what HYDRA looked like up close – the only one who could have identified the creeping sensation they sent up the spine.
Dr. Grant's expression flickered like he was trying to figure out if Tony was making fun of him or not. "I'm used to the YMCA."
“Your sacrifice of small talk is appreciated,” Tony acknowledged graciously. “I would have run the gauntlet myself, but I couldn’t risk getting cornered by Mace. He keeps trying to fill that last spot on the budget-audit committee, and I am
“The night after the interview, I called the suit in my sleep. Honestly, I can’t remember where I thought I was this time. Sometimes it’s the cave or the sonic paralysis – or everyone’s favorite, the wormhole special. But this time Pepper was right next to me. She was asleep right next to me, and I called the suit because my strung-out subconscious can’t take one goddamn night off, and I could have —”
“He’s never going to forgive me for this,” she told him. “I’m not sure I’m going to forgive myself.”
"I have that honors student of yours, Ms. Lewis, in one of my classes," Dr. Grant said, slightly awkwardly.
Taking a moment to estimate distances from the reflections in the tub, Tony fired one shot at the metal tray Steve had thrown at Ward and then spun in the opposite direction. As the HYDRA guards pivoted toward the clatter of the tray, Tony ducked into a crouch and picked them off with two quick squeezes of the trigger.
Tony groped back in his memory, trying to picture what else had been in view when he had last seen the notebook in question. Maybe a metal case of old Kodak film, he thought as he picked his way through the piles, or what had looked like a partial model for a park?
doing,” Clint replied, waving his hand at the space between Tony and Steve. “I’m not doing whatever this is. Good luck finding a conflict mediator, or a marriage counselor, or maybe an exorcist – whatever brave soul can help you get the bad vibes out of this slow-motion train wreck – but in the meantime this candy and I are moving on to less awkward pastures.”
Rumlow plunged Tony’s head forward into the water, and a hot wave of anger boiled over Steve. Tony was struggling against Rumlow’s fist, and Steve could hear the frantic thrash of air bubbles surfacing as if it they were rupturing inside his own chest. It took every ounce of will he possessed not to try to fight his way out of the restraints by brute force.
“I live to please,” Tony replied. “The locals must have found the story suggestive too, because just over a decade after the neighbors they’d known as Charles and Natalie Rushman died, everyone in town was willing to swear – cross their true-blue American hearts and hope to meet Joe McCarthy in the afterlife – that the reason the next three owners of the house had fled the state was that every Christmas Eve, the former residents returned to recruit a pair of unsuspecting lovers and stage an encore performance of their romantic demise.”
“Everybody’s fine but you, Steve,” Tony assured him. “And the doctors said you should be able to move to the general floor in a few hours. So shut those baby blues and let the serum do its job, because there’s a whole team of keyed-up superheroes waiting to see you, and they’re emptying the hospital vending machines fast enough to cause a run on the Frito-Lay factory.”
Steve might have expected that a man like Tony Stark – whose tendency to ditch corporate functions to go base jumping in Hong Kong was the stuff of
Tony took up a position on the opposite side of the elevator from Steve, and Steve crossed his arms tightly across his chest, wishing, not for the first time, that he didn’t always take up so much space. Clint stood in between them, muttering something that sounded like, “I’ll show you a horse,” after which a long silence fell.
“We saw the news of the cowardly attacks on Stark and the Director,” Thor said, clapping his hand so firmly on Bruce’s shoulder that Bruce wobbled in place.
"Hey. Can we talk?" Tony pushed James backwards into his office and tugged the door closed behind him.
“Okay,” Tony observed, “so ‘unlawful entry’ has been upgraded to ‘gunshot wounds,’ with a side of ‘Tell-Tale Heart.’”
Tony traced his fingers along the still-unfamiliar contours of Steve’s beard and brushed a stray lock of his hair back from his face. The ends were still the tiniest bit damp, and Tony tried to suppress a shudder at the memory of ice water working its way up Steve’s body.
It took him a few minutes to understand what he was seeing. The first pages were so dense with notations and calculations that Tony’s eyes did quick circuits of the words “vita radiation,” “nitramene,” and “vibranium” before landing on the ones that made him let out a distinctly unprofessional whoop: “Project Rebirth.”
“I have a solid lead on Barnes. FRIDAY picked out his biometric scans from some surveillance feeds in Bucharest. I can have you on the jet to Romania as soon as you’re ready.”
Rumlow chuckled, and Tony gave Steve a small shake of his head – whether to say, “I’m fine” or “stop being so dramatic,” Steve couldn’t tell.
The mission had gone wrong from the start: bad intel, a junior HYDRA agent who was far too twitchy with self-destruct buttons, and the first Code Green in months. After picking up the pieces of their weapons and uniforms, the team had flown back to the Tower in near silence, shuffled through a cursory medical check, and collapsed across the furniture in the common room. It had been a solid fifteen minutes before Clint had flopped over and pawed at the remote long enough to turn on “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” and another twenty minutes before Steve heaved himself off the couch to raid the kitchen for snacks.
“Or SHIELD has actually been getting tons of intel about the Mandarin, and Fury’s just not sharing,” Tony suggested, drumming his chopsticks absently on the edge of the table. “Hell, Director Need-to-Know could have the Mandarin locked up in some secret facility right now, tucked away with all the other under-the-table projects SHIELD makes disappear.”
“Yeah, well, we have that in common,” Tony pointed out. “If I remember correctly, you just walked willingly into a trap set by your mortal enemies – an organization that cursed your name for most of the twentieth century – armed with nothing but a hot bobby pin. So I guess we’ve got ‘near-suicidal stubbornness’ going for us.”
“Good afternoon,” Strange intoned. “The first order of business the FAC brings before you is an amendment to the faculty handbook that would allow for online meetings in extenuating circumstances. You will find the proposed language on page two of today’s agenda.”
“Also, calling in the refs is a pretty bold move,” Bruce added, “considering that the miniature murder bots guarding our Christmas tree are in flagrant violation of rules ten through fifteen.”
“Do you think they’re ready?” Clint asked, leaning against the fireplace a few feet away from the spot where Natasha had reappeared.
“Gee, Tony, I wonder what in your recent history would make me think you would avoid dealing with the knowledge of your own mortality by finding someone inappropriate to flirt with. On a totally separate note, doesn’t Natalie Rushman live here now?”
But now his nerves were crawling with the anticipation of an archival find, and the thought of reading through sophomore attempts to describe the Teapot Dome scandal felt like death by a thousand accidental substitutions of “Hoover” for “Harding.” He was too keyed up to lesson plan; last year’s seminar discussion of the “top five historical rioting strategies and how to apply them today” had taught him the hard way that adrenaline and course prep were a dangerous mixture.
“Our mission almost went sideways,” Steve resumed. “It turns out Rumlow had separate instructions – something about data extraction. He missed the rendez-vous point, so we went to look for him. When we found him downloading files, I lost my temper, and a grenade almost blew up in Nat’s face because of it. I can’t stop replaying it. It was like I was back in that helicopter again – people getting hurt because I can’t see the whole field.”
“So that’s a ‘no’ on ‘being pinned to the floor’ then,” Steve clarified, running one hand slowly down Tony’s chest and hooking a thumb around the waistband of his sweatpants.
“It’s part of the job to stand next to each other when the fight starts,” Steve said firmly. “You know that, because you’re the one who knew we’d all show up in New York. You’re the one who invited us all into your home. You made us a team. That means your enemies are our enemies. And if someone comes for you, we’ll be there. Every time.”
But the final words were swallowed up by a crack of thunder, which seemed to chase the sudden flashes of lightning through the hallway. The edges of the sheet-draped furniture and dusty window frames blazed into view, sharp and flat against the white glare, before flickering back to darkness. Steve felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up and whirled around just in time to catch a halo of flaming red hair silhouetted against the sitting-room windows. His hand jerked instinctively toward his holster, but in another second the outline was gone.
“But that’s my point,” Tony retorted. “Grant is brand new – I bet the ink is barely dry on his final transcripts – and yet he comes charging into every meeting like he knows exactly what’s wrong with the college. No way you make yourself that vulnerable as a VAP unless you’ve got an angle.”
“Did that counter try to mug an old lady, Cap?” Tony asked lightly, pouring himself a mug of coffee while he examined what he could see of Steve’s face.
Tony shut his eyes. The knot in his stomach had disintegrated into what felt like a swarm of needles, and Tony allowed himself a moment to acknowledge what it must mean that hearing Steve say those words could sting so badly.
“Don’t fuck around, Rogers. Four,” Ward warned, and Rumlow’s hand twitched threateningly back toward the back of Tony’s head.
“Oh and Tony? If you hear any more whispering about Dr. Grant’s schedule, you can feel free to come straight back to me. I take a personal interest in the careers of our more vulnerable faculty members.”
“Or what?” the other man grinned. “You’ll shoot me? Wouldn’t be the first time. Wouldn’t even be the first time
“I can’t talk about any of this over the phone,” Rhodey replied. “But just take my word for it: you don’t know what you’re dealing with here. This shit is dangerous. Promise me you’ll drop it until I can talk to you somewhere secure.”
By the time everyone had finished, Tony was already bouncing impatiently on the balls of his feet, a perfect rendering of Caravaggio’s “The Calling of Saint Matthew” etched into his pumpkin.
“This isn’t going to be another ‘21 Reasons Why Nikola Tesla Could Get It’ saga, is it?” Bruce asked, wearing an expression that Tony found to be melodramatically long-suffering. “Because I have exams to grade.”
The house that locals called the “Red Manor” rarely had visitors these days. Once a favorite stopping point for romantically inclined tourists and bored teenagers, the Manor now risked being swallowed up by the woods around it. Most of the east wing was covered in ivy, its tendrils stretching out toward the mossy shingles and cobwebbed balustrades that marked the slow creep of overgrowth across the remaining traces of human habitation. The windows of the house were dark – on this night as they had been every night since county officials condemned the property ten years earlier. Other than the odd rustling in the leaves, the only sounds that could be heard for miles around were the muffled notes of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” which drifted aimlessly from the car parked in the front drive.
James flew at two of the men, catching them both across the chest and knocking them down. But instead of swarming him, the rest of the group pushed right past and took off towards Tony.
“And we all agreed that what you did was really fucking stupid, so the healing has already begun,” Sam added from a chair to Steve’s left. He reached forward to give Steve’s shoulder a gentle squeeze. “I’m getting a little tired of falling asleep in your hospital rooms, by the way. This shit is bad for my neck.”
Careful is my middle name, Tony thought to himself wryly as he watched Rhodey leave, swiping right to answer the call and settling into his chair again.
were going to make a fool of yourself,” he managed finally, the experience of dozens of teen-magazine interviews rising up to lend the words a light, self-deprecating touch. “Just walk into the party with me: you’re guaranteed to be upstaged.”
“What about you, Cap?” Tony asked, trying to draw Steve out of whatever hole his eyes seemed to be boring into the couch.
“Hello, Stark,” Wanda said, and Tony choked off a curse. She was just over a foot away, placidly sipping from a mug of tea and occupying a spot that Tony was very sure had been empty a second earlier.
“So there’s a shadowy ‘they’ involved, and whoever ‘they’ are, ‘they’ played us,” Tony agreed. He was practically vibrating with energy, Steve noticed, bouncing on the balls of his feet and tapping one finger rhythmically against the place where the arc reactor glowed through his shirt. “They pulled out a little Orientalist song and dance to distract us, and it worked, so let’s put Edward Said on the Avengers reading list, and let’s get busy figuring out who these bastards are. They’re changing tactics, and I want to know why. Cap?”
Well, that was absolutely not going to stand. Years earlier, when he and Steve had first started dating, Tony might have succumbed to his weak spot for Steve’s sassy moods. But he had spent weeks preparing for this coup. He whirled back toward his pumpkin, muttering to himself as he got HALL-O set up to go. He ignored the sly looks Natasha was casting his way every time she peeked over at Steve’s pumpkin. He didn’t even acknowledge Thor’s attempts to push a glass of beer his way: Thor’s strategy had become increasingly dependent on getting other people drunk, and Tony was not going to allow any distractions to come between him and the prize (a cardboard crown that read
"A large is too small. Two larges is too much. Two mediums is just right. Don't judge my coffee choices, young lady. I saw you with one of those weird, pink unicorn drink things last month."
"It's adorable that it's only dawning on you now that this school has the fine-arts budget of an amateur magic show.”
Darcy groaned and leaned back against the shelf, making the whole thing creak concerningly. "I should go back to Poli Sci."
bit when he took a hard hit during that afternoon’s game and came up holding his wrist awkwardly. Or maybe one time — just
“Just your bodyguard, from the looks of it,” Happy responded, nodding down at the spot where Steve had felt the bullet slice against his ribs.
“That’s cheating,” Clint protested, waving the arrow he’d just been using to pick off the marshmallows he’d lined up across the kitchen island. “We put electricity on the ‘forbidden items’ list after Thor fried half our pumpkins into a pulp trying to carve his with Mjolnir.”
“He said our marriage license was a national embarrassment!” Steve protested. “And you’re the one who threatened to buy the building he lived in and turn it into a gay strip club.”
"Well, anyway… I just -" Dr. Grant waved vaguely. They stared at each other for a moment. Dr. Grant gestured at the chest press machine. "Need a spot?" he asked, too sweetly.
Steve gritted his teeth and forced his arm upward to level the gun at Rumlow again, but he was suddenly tackled from the left by Ward. He lost his grip on the gun as he went down, Ward landing a punch strong enough to knock the wind out of him. Steve struck back, but a stab of pain behind one eye hit him so hard he curled inward. He felt Rumlow haul him up by one shoulder, and a kick caught him square across the jaw.
“I’ve been trying to figure out what you’re doing here with him,” she replied. Seemingly unbothered by the gun Steve had trained on her head, she brushed by him and started to make her way down the ladder – the same ladder, Steve noted with annoyance, that had absolutely not been there minutes earlier.
“Because I wanted to tell you that I woke up in this century alone,” he said, “and that you were the first person stubborn enough to make sure I wouldn’t stay that way. Now I wake up to a kitchen full of people who tease me about my lists but who know why I need them – who will eat dinner rolls that taste like soggy chalk just to make me feel at home.” He paused. “People who stay by my side for eight straight hours at the hospital.”
But if Rhodey finished that sentence, Tony didn’t hear it, because at that moment he heard a sound that narrowed the whole world to one agonizing hope.
He knew he should probably let Steve finish. Steve had never officially come out to him – maybe he hadn’t told anyone how he felt about Bucky at all – and it looked like it was taking him an immense effort to get the confession out. But Tony didn’t think he could stand to hear the truth confirmed just now, not when he was still reeling from the recognition of his own feelings on the matter.
Tony brushed a hand across the lid of the box. A minute ago he’d been eager to start scouring the container for anything that could be of use to him. But after Arnie’s speech, he felt strangely hesitant to break the seal – to be the first person in years to witness the remnants of Rogers’ life: one of many chewed up by the weapons Tony spent his days studying from afar.
But the YMCA was quiet, as long as he didn't come right before or after normal working hours, and it had a hot tub and a faculty discount. There was an older guy trotting steadily on a treadmill, a teenager piling weights back on the rack, and an astonishingly stunning ass, thrust up towards Tony in a steady and flexy downward dog. He resisted the urge to whistle.
“I’m okay,” she replied with a sob. “The armor – he got me out. Search and rescue just came, and they found his phone. But Steve. The whole house is gone. God. He was still inside, and he tried to call the armor back, but I don’t know – I don’t know if he made it.”
"Shit!" He slammed on the brakes, and the ABS kicked in, but it wasn't doing much as his car fishtailed around and slid onto the other side of the road. He went backwards off the road and onto the graded shoulder with a soft crunch.
“I think it was a tactical leak,” Steve acknowledged, “to motivate her mark. She knew I needed a push. Because I’ve messed up the past two years, and I needed to tell you: pretty much everything I’m thankful for in my new life is here because of you.”
He had been waving the pudding cup accusingly as he spoke, and Steve reached out to take it, almost succeeding in suppressing another wince at the renewed tug against his side. Tony growled in annoyance, moving Steve’s outstretched arm back against his chest and tucking the pudding cup in his hand.
So Natasha had come to New York City for the weekend, taken him out dancing, and drunk him under the table. And that was the last time that anyone who wasn’t a combative journalist had talked to him about the Avengers.
“Steve!” Tony shouted, and some part of Steve’s mind not being squeezed in a vice realized that Tony must have removed the duct tape with his free hand, which was now gripping Steve’s left arm.
“I’m sorry,” he managed, his voice thick in his throat. “Tony, I’m so sorry. What I did…I could have gotten you killed.”
Tony’s feet hit the floor almost before the final thought had formed. He made it just two steps before his knees buckled, but it didn’t matter, because Steve had started moving as soon as Tony did, and when Tony half-jumped, half-collapsed into his arms, Steve caught him. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips as Steve pressed him against his chest, and then they were kissing each other with a desperation that allowed for no other sensation.
“I tried to run away from something that was bothering me. I thought it would be easier for everyone if I dealt with it on my own. But you made sure I had company anyway,” Steve said, his voice so earnest that it made Tony’s chest ache. “Please let us do the same for you. If you don’t want it to be me, I get it. But let me call Rhodey. Or Pepper, she could —”
“Steve,” Pepper managed, her voice shaking almost too hard to be understood, “I’m sorry. I couldn’t find a phone. Someone came… Tony got me out.”
“I love what’s attached too,” he finished. “I love all of you. And I couldn’t keep pretending I didn’t want the whole thing.”
Steve and Tony straightened carefully, and Steve stepped into position on Iron Man’s foot as Tony’s arm wrapped around his waist.
“The devil take Lord Hammer,” Tony grumbled, his eyes still lingering over the tense lines of Steve’s shoulders. “That a man so bereft of any higher faculties should be so blessed in material goods is a feature of the divine order that surpasses human understanding.”
“Okay,” he said, straightening up and gripping the handle of the broom to pull himself together. “Tony, if you eat that banana and drink another glass of water, we will all let you choose the movie for tonight.”
“Technically, I didn’t fall, and so that doesn’t count as a win,” Tony told him, his voice every bit as calm and breezy as Steve didn’t feel.
“Dear Mrs. Barnes,” it read. “I can’t even find the words to tell you how sorry I am –” Then there was a dark spot and a small tear in the page, as if the pencil had pressed too hard on the next words. The remaining paper was blank except for a lonely sign-off: “More love than I can say, Steve Rogers.”
not getting the jokes,” he said, taking a seat on one end of the couch and booting up the projector. “You can keep electrocuting things, or you can come lie down and explain the punch lines to me until you pass out.”
“Uh, about that,” Steve replied, the corner of his lips tugging up into a small smile. “I should warn you that I
Ah, there it was. Well, Tony supposed it had been too much to hope that Steve was still so confused by twenty-first-century technology that he had somehow missed the endless replays of the interview on social media.
“Oh my God,” Steve managed, rushing forward to turn Tony gently onto his back and press his hand to the wound. “Oh God, Tony. What did you do?”
“Unfortunately for you, you’re not unarmed,” Tony replied, gesturing toward the device in Sitwell’s hand with a jerk of the gun. “You bastards used that to kill a SHIELD agent who was practically a kid. His name was Agent Harrison. And if you were going to put an explosive in Steve Rogers’ head, you really should have put one in mine. Because that’s the only way you could have stopped me from tracking you down.”
Tony jogged across the street to Crawley Forum. What he wanted to do tonight was raid the noodle bar in the student lounge and hole up in Houghton until three in the morning, but first he had to sit through an hour of bureaucracy. It was best to show, though, if only because absent faculty members were the most likely to be volunteered for things.
“It would appear so. Skye ran the video through voice and face recognition searches, and she thinks he’s an English actor. Trevor Slattery. No priors and no hits in the SHIELD databases.”
adorably) called “going steady,” and Rhodey had been selected for a cadet exchange program in Germany. And so just at the moment when Steve had decided to move out and give his best friends more privacy, Tony found himself down a roommate.
A loud bang ricocheted down the hallway outside, and James snapped into deathly serious. He grabbed Tony's arm and manhandled him behind him. "Stay behind me," he commanded. "I'll get you out."
It was true that Steve had been the one to suggest that they make their own decorations for the Tower this year. But it was also true that Steve’s contribution (a hand-drawn series of family holiday cards to hang on the fridge) had been the only one that hadn’t tended to produce chaos. Thor and Natasha’s idea to braid garlands had started out innocently enough. But then they’d decided to add “motivational mead” to the creative process. Ten hours later, they’d produced so many strings of spruce, holly, and taffeta that the garlands had to be looped around every available surface, twisting around lamps and chair legs until the common room looked like it was being slowly strangled to death by a festive boa constrictor. Bruce – in a complete failure to learn from the previous Halloween’s Saltwater Taffy Incident – had concocted a spiced eggnog so addictively good that each new batch he made disappeared almost immediately – setting off a cycle of recrimination and dairy-based hoarding. And Clint had stayed true to form by making an extremely explicit, themed pin-up calendar of himself, which had been quickly banned from all common areas by a 4-2 vote (“I think these poses are courageous,” Thor had explained, “considering your very small human sizes”).
“It’s not because of the team,” Tony continued, in case he had interpreted Steve’s expression correctly. “Well, it’s not only because of the team. Mostly it’s me. I know I’m not…easy for people to care about. I got my convoy bombed, got kidnapped and tortured, poisoned by the thing I invented to save my life – oh and didn’t tell anyone, that was a real crowd pleaser. Then after flying a nuke into space I picked a fight with a terrorist on cable news. You’ll be happy to know you weren’t the only one pissed about that little stunt. But even that wasn’t enough to drive her away.”
And with that he whirled away, leaving Tony blinking in confusion as he watched Grant stalk down the stairs and whisper fiercely into his phone.
“You wouldn’t believe the check-out lines at Macy’s,” Steve said. “If I had to hear one more angel sweetly singing over the plains, I was going to start taking hostages.”
“Yes, sir,” Dr. Grant replied, and Coulson’s eyebrows bobbed upward ever so slightly at the honorific. “I wanted to draw the faculty’s attention to the use of gendered language in section two of the handbook. If you’ll turn to the passage in question…”
Tony stared at him a little longer, his eyes flicking down to the place where an angry red line still striped across Steve’s ribs. Then he nodded in acknowledgment and turned away to flop onto the couch behind him.
“It is very entertaining,” Thor affirmed, clapping a heavy hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I liked it almost as much as the video challenge Barton showed me for the Best Human Flails.”
"Definitely not." Parker's eyes went wide and pleading, looking like a combination between an iPhone emoji and Puss in Boots. Tony expected violin music to start swelling any minute.
“Seriously, Nat. I don’t really have a plan. I can’t exactly pull him aside after a team meeting and say, ‘Tony, I know you just broke up with the woman who may be the love of your life, but I fell for you almost the first day I met you, so would you like to go steady?’”
“Don’t bullshit me, Barton,” Tony yelled. He realized dimly that he was pressing one hand flat against the arc reactor, as if the device could stop the horrible knowledge taking shape in his mind from getting to his heart. “If you lie to me about this, I swear to God –”
He took a deep steadying breath. Tony was alive. They had hurt him, but he was alive. And Steve had to keep him that way. He tried to catch Tony’s eye to communicate this determination, but Tony’s gaze was fixed on Steve’s nose, where Steve could feel a small trickle of blood moving toward his lips.
“Nothing about you is replaceable, Tony,” Steve insisted, and Tony wondered when that voice – so gentle and stubborn and unworried – was ever going to stop making his heart leap into his throat. “I’m asking what
“Tony you can’t ignore my calls just because you know I have bad news,” Pepper’s voice launched in immediately.
“Well fuck me,” Tony breathed, and Steve felt another thrill of giddiness when Tony continued to grip his arms, though he looked steady enough on his feet by now.
“Yeah, how dare he ask questions about his new workplace?” Bruce raised an eyebrow. “The absolute gall.”
Steve walked over briskly, digging a pair of gloves out of his pocket. As soon as he had them on, he held out a hand to ask Tony for the paper. Tony chewed on his lip for a moment and then handed it over, leaning back against the counter as Steve read it through.
“Now you’ll say I’m getting ahead of myself planning for years of inside jokes, but I’ve got a good feeling about our next album. And you know I called it right on Banner showing up for the giant, flying alien crawfish situation, so my track record’s not bad.”
“Thor, we talked about this, buddy,” Bruce said, a small smile playing on his lips. “On Earth we show our appreciation by rinsing out our glassware and putting it carefully in the dishwasher.”
hadn’t just lost yet another round of Get It Together, Rogers, For God’s Sake: You’re A Grown Man. Bucky’s eyes would be rolling out of his head.
Grant chuckled, and this interaction was getting away from Tony somehow. He’d come here for a fight - or to get crucial, constructive critiques of his work - definitely not to stare at the way Grant’s eyes crinkled just slightly at the edges when he laughed.
“You’ll be fine, Rogers,” he said out loud, his voice draped in the off-hand tone he’d been carefully knitting together for months. “Everybody’s going to be at least three drinks in by the time we get there, so their world is going to be shrouded in the forgiving haze of those horrible Pink Panty Droppers that Barton always insists on making. Besides, you’re coming in on the wings of glory. No one’s going to be able to see anything other than the star quarterback, recently returned victorious from the field of the state, national, regional championship — or the Nestlé Hot Pockets Bowl — or whatever it was you won today.”
“As long as you want, Steve,” Tony told him. “Just please: try to stay alive long enough to get tired of me. Try not to –”
“Wait!” Steve gasped. He made a small lunge against the restraints. “Please. You have to believe me. If I could tell you, I would.”
“What? No. Absolutely not. I am not a young man, Rogers. You had one opportunity to have a go at me and you used it to knock me down more times than the lead singer of a mid-nineties, one-hit-wonder, indie band that you’ve definitely never heard of – seriously, if I actually said their name right now, you’d think I was mumbling random syllables just to screw with you.”
“In that case,” Steve said slowly. “There’s just one more stupid thing I’d like to try.” He paused, taking a deep breath as he scanned Tony’s face. “I really want to kiss you right now.”
Tony stayed on the chest press machine just long enough that he could claim a set, then cleaned it off and made a beeline for a treadmill. He put his headphones in, started his Best of Black Sabbath playlist, and started to jog.
His pulse had started hammering automatically in response to Tony’s change of tone, but his mind couldn’t quite catch up to whatever conclusion his heart had drawn. Tony’s mouth opened and shut quickly, and then he dragged one hand roughly across his face as if to clear the expression.
“You sure you’re feeling all right?” Natasha inquired, looking at him slightly askance. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Harrison’s eyes struggled to focus on him, and Steve swore quietly to himself as he heard the sounds of more gunmen approaching down the hall.
What Carter had left behind in her donation was hardly a mountain of evidence, but it was surely enough to suggest that Steve Rogers
“Language, Captain,” Garrett smiled. “What kind of an example does that set for America’s youth? Rumlow and Ward here will be as gentle as you like – or as inventive. It’s all up to you.”
Grant was still loading his notebooks into a worn leather bag as Tony approached, and Tony found himself idly noticing the flex of Grant’s forearms underneath his rolled shirt cuffs. Luckily, his sunglasses concealed the angle of his gaze when Grant looked up to meet his eyes.
And whether it was because his brain hadn't quite kicked back into gear or because he'd watched a fatal bullet wound disappear from his stomach hours earlier, Tony did something that had never felt possible before. He stepped forward to close the distance between them, pulling Steve forward by the front of his shirt until they both stood under the arch.
Steve felt a sudden tightness in his chest, and before he knew what he was doing, he had reeled backward, leaving Tony swaying slightly in his wake.
“Seeing that armor plunge off a horse and disappear into a hoard of Hydra soldiers has filled me with enough
“No!” Tony yelled. He was lurching forward, but Steve had already tossed his shield into the air. It collided with the control panel, and the door between them slammed into place.
On the display, the man who had called himself the Mandarin in the broadcast weeks ago was sitting at a long, cluttered dressing table with his face angled toward a large mirror. He was talking, seemingly to the person recording the video. But his voice didn’t sound anything like the measured, lilting intonation the Mandarin had used when issuing his demands. This time he sounded British – and extremely drunk.
As he rebundled his scarf around his neck to prepare for the cross-campus trudge to his office, Tony made a concerted effort to put James Grant and his soft, snowdrift-conquering smiles out of his mind. He needed to focus on the essentials: like figuring out what Steve Rogers' role was in Rebirth and discovering who in the hell had been goofy enough to name a weapons project “Captain America.”
They were all showing the strain in their own ways. When Steve had declined Natasha’s offer to fight, she’d dragged Bruce out from his lab – where he’d been hunched over a set of equations for beta decay reactions – and taught him eight new ways to incapacitate an assailant without Hulking. Clint had been baking his way through the “cookies and bars” section of the cookbook Pepper had bought him for his birthday, and every time he finished another dozen, Thor would arrange them into smiley faces on plates and distribute them to each member of the team. Rhodey had even come over for the day. Ostensibly, he needed to go over some upgrades to the War Machine armor; but really, Tony suspected, he wanted to give Tony something to do that didn’t involve setting off semi-controlled explosions.
“That’s very sneaky of you, Rogers,” Tony replied. His voice was a bit slow, he noticed, and he couldn’t quite muster the focus to wag a finger for emphasis. “I don’t know if it’s good for you to be spending so much time around spies.”
“Hey,” Tony said, squeezing Steve’s hand, “what’s going on? I know my hair’s probably a disaster, but you’ve seen me much worse than this.”
“You can get in line,” Clint muttered. Then he threw them both a mock salute. “Good luck, kids. And remember: margarita time waits for no man. Don’t make me send May to collect you.”
“Hmm?” Tony asked absently. “Oh yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.” He was still staring down at the paper, and all the lines of his body that had been relaxing since they got home had snapped taut again. Steve felt his own chest tighten at the sight, his jaw clenching as if preparing to take a punch.
And whether it was because the ornaments had somehow sensed a threat to the tree or because they had successfully subdued all the stuffed animals in the vicinity, Steve’s ears suddenly picked up the low whine that meant hostile décor was incoming. As Tony held his position, Steve saw Natasha, Rhodey, and Thor leap out from cover and take aim at the three diminutive Iron Men that were shooting toward their creator’s head.
Steve didn’t respond immediately, so Tony let the offer hang. His phone was vibrating, and he looked down at the screen to give Steve cover if he wanted to decline the confidence. Pepper was calling for the second time, which could only mean bad news about the board meeting. Well, never doubt Tony Stark’s ability to avoid a reality check. He shoved the phone back in his pocket.
“I never got the sense that it bothered Agent Carter too much that so few people came to see the papers,” he continued. “But for myself, I would have liked them to get a bit more air.”
“Not a chance,” Tony hissed, gripping at the fabric of Steve’s shirt as if worried Steve was going to physically shake him loose. “Don’t you dare say it.”
Tony hadn't been to the gym in an embarrassingly long time, but when everything else failed, sometimes that shot of endorphins would ease him into an emotional state approximating what Bruce assured him other people experienced as “patience.” If it didn't, at least the day wouldn't be a complete waste.
Tony’s eyes flashed, and Steve felt the start of a flush creeping up the back of his neck. He hadn’t meant to bring up the woman from the bar – wasn’t sure why that part of the night had even been on his mind – and he knew that last remark had definitely been over the line.
“We’ll need to strategize about the press conference next week,” he tried, proud of how casual his voice sounded.
James snorted, then seemed to think better of it, and he quickly schooled his expression into something more neutral. “I’m on call as a volunteer firefighter,” he explained, his voice taking on the even carefulness Tony had first noticed at the YMCA.
“Well, okay,” Tony tried again, plucking at the collar of Steve’s tee-shirt, “if you won’t knock me out, maybe you could…you know…knock me out.”
When they finally broke for air, it came in sharp pants, and Steve had to squeeze his eyes shut against the heady relief of feeling Tony’s breath brush over his lips.
“So were you even going to call us in if Romanov hadn’t tipped us off?” Tony asked. “You remember you’re an Avenger, right? Fought off a hoard of genocidal aliens together…share a coffee maker in the mornings…ringing any bells? You were in trouble – you jumped out of an elevator and then got caught in an
But the edges of his vision were closing in like a noose, and Steve was out cold, moments before he could see Tony fold upward into the form of Natasha. The phantom inspected Steve’s slumped body with a smirk, twirling the gun around her finger.
“Tony!” Steve gasped out, shoving the glove back in his mouth as the pressure spiked to a new intensity in his head.
Tony had leaned over to adjust the settings on Steve’s bed as he spoke, and by the time he finished, a dull tugging sensation across Steve’s chest had loosened – the pain subsiding almost before Steve could register that it had been bothering him.
“Oh, you mean the list for people who email the faculty listserv to say that proctoring software is - how did you put it? ‘Cop shit’? Yeah, you’re going to be getting a really uncomfortable new desk chair delivered to your office in the next few days.”
“Let me guess? Super soldiers,” Steve grimaced. An idea was taking shape in his mind, and he found himself giving words to it almost against his will, even as another part of his mind was twisting desperately away from the realization. “That’s why they want me: as a back up. If the TAHITI drug doesn’t work, they can try making something with my blood. But they knew I would never let them take me alive to extract it unless –”
Nearly tucked behind a stack of binders on top of the filing cabinet was another frame with a faded sketch of Lake Como that looked vaguely familiar. Tony couldn't put his finger on the artist, but it looked like it could be an original.
“I’m not in trouble, Tony,” he confirmed. “Well, not any more trouble than you are, seeing as we’re both going to be trapped here for at least another few hours.”
“Thank you,” he said, swinging his leg over the bike and starting the engine before he could lose the will to go. “Try not to pick too many fights without me.”
Tony's heart jump-skipped into overdrive. Any hope that this was a prank Dr. Grant was playing on him evaporated. Those men meant business - that much was horrifyingly clear.
“Tony, for the twentieth time, I am not knocking you out until the news comes,” Steve replied patiently.
“Nat said you gave her a very generous severance package,” Steve replied, a small smile tugging at one side of his mouth.
In fact, Steve had just made up his mind to make a tactical retreat from the scene when Tony had jumped up to show Steve a new design for Hawkeye’s body armor and promptly folded like a piece of paper. Steve had barely had time to catch him under the arms before he hit the floor.
Steve was still hovering in the hallway, his stance turned halfway toward Tony and half back toward the gym. Tony suppressed the urge to check the expression in his face again and continued addressing his communication to the rest of the group.
“Sounds good to me,” Tony nodded. “I can grab one of the sixty-four weapons Natasha travels with and we can regroup. Which way do you think it is?”
“I’m right here, big guy,” a voice said. And Steve realized he must have spoken the name aloud, because there was Tony, smiling in a way that didn’t quite soften the lines of worry around his eyes. Steve let out a deep breath, hearing the beep of a monitor slow gradually as he oriented himself. He was lying in a hospital bed, IVs attached to his left arm and a large bandage wrapped around his midsection. Tony was perched on the edge of the bed, and – with the exception of the dark circles under his eyes and a bandage on his right hand – he appeared to be unhurt.
“God, I know,” Tony replied, running his hands through his hair with a grimace. “I know! Every rational part of me says that I should put a pin in ‘Rebirth’ and move on. But I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something here. You know when you wake up in the middle of the night halfway through writing the next paragraph, because even in your sleep, your brain keeps working the problem? I’m dreaming about these files, Bruce.”
“I’ll uh – I’ll do my best,” Tony replied, finding himself at a loss for what to do with the look of assurance in the old man’s eyes. Arnie gave him a final nod and then tottered back toward the door.
Steve’s head whipped around immediately at the note of urgency in Tony’s voice. His eyes scanned rapidly across Tony’s face then skipped down to the drink Tony had let drop to the floor. Comprehension dawned over his features, followed quickly by a look of white-hot rage that made Tony gasp out loud.
Steve whirled back around and crouched in front of the agent where he had lurched forward toward the ground. Steve scanned quickly for any sign of injury. He hadn’t heard any shots fired. Had Harrison been hit earlier and Steve hadn’t noticed? Tony was there in a second, dropping into position so that he could put the armor between Harrison and the warehouse.
The image disappeared, quickly replaced by a commercial for paper towels that was midway through its jingle. The terrorist must have hijacked the feed – that meant this was no backyard shed operation. Tony was already compiling a list of words to have JARVIS run through SHIELD and CIA databases, and he was just about to pull up a broadcast-satellite map when he realized Steve was talking again.
Tony cocked an eyebrow and brandished one of the coffees threateningly. "Was that a very thinly veiled commentary on my age?"
“The police tried to take the shooter into custody, but he took some kind of poison,” Happy told them, holstering his gun as he walked over. “They called 911, but it doesn’t look like he’s going to make it.”
“I’m afraid it’s more business then pleasure,” Steve apologized, and Tony jumped back to his feet immediately.
“You should tell him,” Pepper had said, her voice soft and sad in a way that made Tony want to build another company just so he could give it to her. Tony hadn’t thought he was confessing anything in particular – he had been talking about the way Steve’s face screwed up with concentration when he programmed the coffee maker – but she had known. Maybe she had known for a while.
“Thank God,” Tony murmured, and then he cupped Steve’s jaw with his free hand, leaned forward, and kissed him.
“Tony?” Natasha’s voice echoed down the hall, and Tony whipped his head around to watch her run into view.
A real smile finally broke across Steve’s face at the memory, and Tony felt like someone had loosened a metal band strapped across his chest.
dead. And then I wasn’t. It took me a long time to figure out what happened in between. Fury ordered me not to tell the Avengers, and I thought he must have his reasons. I know now that the secrecy was a mistake. I trusted the system, and the people who trusted me paid a price.”
As it turned out, only three people entered the room. But one of them was Sitwell, who was clutching a small device that looked an awful lot like the remote trigger for an explosive. The plans that didn’t involve “frontal assault” got a little fuzzy at that point.
"Sure, yeah, okay," Tony agreed, still looking at his feet and wondering how on earth his car had magically propelled itself up a snow-laden twenty-percent incline.
He turned and walked out of the workshop – to go find people who ate and slept like functional adults, Tony assumed – and Tony turned back to the electrical sensors.
Steve looked up from his sketch to see Tony watching him from the other end of the couch. Ever since the night at the gala, it had become more common for Steve to stick around for an hour or two after the workday wrapped up. Tonight, they’d been sharing an assortment of take-out noodles and pot stickers while Tony reviewed some new designs on his tablet and Steve doodled in a notebook.
“I think maybe we should try to head back up to the surface,” Steve said, trying to avoid any hint that the suggestion was driven by anxiety over Tony’s heart rate. “Nat and Clint may have already found Zemo. Hell, he might not even be here at all.”
One week later, Tony’s kitchen counters were still covered in cryptic post-it notes, an assortment of bakery boxes, and the unused Crock Pot that Pepper had made him buy the month before (something about “a last-ditch attempt to keep him from dying of the kind of lifestyle diseases that used to kill malnourished, eighteenth-century cabin boys”).
“In Malibu, I assume. That’s where she usually is these days. We broke up a while ago. It’s okay, Cap.” Tony added the last part quickly, clearly sensing some of the guilty pressure building in Steve’s chest. “It was bound to happen eventually. I’ll always love Pep like crazy, and she’s saved my life in more ways than one. But I think she always hoped I would walk away from this some day. I was never going to be able to give her what she wanted.”
“Rumlow got cornered and tried to distract Steve by taunting him about Barnes,” she said. “But Steve went right for the bomb. He caught the brunt of the blast with his shield, and Wanda helped contain the rest. The burns were bad at first, but he’s healing.”
“I have no idea why Pepper threatened to staple the definition of ‘low-profile’ to the inside of your jacket,” Steve greeted Tony, wandering away from the counter. “You’re so naturally subtle.”
Steve reached up and clasped Tony’s hand. He laced their fingers together and then brushed his lips gently across the places where Tony’s knuckles had cracked against the door.
“Oh, I’m sorry. I ‘don’t need to worry’ about the woman whose honey-blonde tresses fall perfectly into place after every backflip like she was anointed at birth by Vidal Sassoon?”
A huge thank you to everyone who has been reading, kudos-ing, and leaving words of encouragement. This was my first attempt at something like this, and every note has meant so much to me. Thank you for spending time in the little world of this fic!
“I just never could resist a nice pair of ankles – or the ability to stage a murder-suicide in under an hour.”
“I needed a distraction.” Steve chuckled, and then winced when the movement set off a fresh burn of pressure across his stomach. “And you’re one to talk: did you set fire to our hotel room?”
The foot traffic outside the store faded to a dull whisper as Steve strained to pick up the small intake of breath from the other end of the call.
“Was that an attempt to butter me up, Stark?” he asked. “Because if so, I would estimate that your chances of getting on my good side are going to be inversely correlated to the amount of time you spend in my office.”
Steve felt flecks of pudding spatter onto his arm and realized he had crushed the plastic cup in his fist. He gasped in a deep breath and forced himself to relax his hand, trying to hold himself steady as the edges of room whirled around him.
“Dr. Grant is great with the students,” Tony offered suddenly, leaning forward to fiddle with the angle of a lamp on Coulson’s desk, “irritatingly great, actually. He shows up to all their lacrosse games and glee club performances. It’s embarrassing.”
But they were already so close together, their knees almost knocking against each other each time they shifted. If he touched Tony now, with the gash from Tony’s fight with the Hulk still sharp and angry on his cheek, Steve knew he would risk communicating far more feelings than just reassurance.
It had taken a while for him to admit the extent of the damage, because it was the opposite of the problem he’d expected to have when the two of them had gotten thrown into living together senior year. Before that August, Steve and Tony hadn’t really moved in the same circles. Steve had lived in a cheap, off-campus apartment for the first three years of college with two fellow athletes, Bucky and Sam, and Tony had stayed in the dorm rooms with his best friend Rhodey — largely in an effort to choose the living situation that would irritate his father the most. But then Bucky and Sam had gone from the occasional hook-up to what Steve (not
“I can get to Barnes to make sure Zemo’s people don’t try anything,” Sam said. “I might have an easier time convincing him to come in than someone he knows anyway. Every time he sees Steve, the likelihood of someone’s car ending up as scrap metal seems to go up at least 200% – no offense, Cap.”
Tony was about to tease Steve about coming crawling to the espresso machine at last when his smile suddenly turned to a frown. He couldn’t think of any reason why Steve would need caffeine this morning, he realized; nor did he feel entirely sure what morning it was — or how he’d gotten back to his room.
“The fuck you don’t!” Tony retorted, his eyes snapping up to meet Steve’s. Something in Tony’s expression speared through Steve's chest like a second bullet, leaving a burning trail through his center. But almost as soon as Steve registered its presence, it was gone again, a blank stare falling across Tony’s face like the slamming of a door.
Tony didn’t have time to shoot back a sarcastic reply, because the Winter Soldier was ripping a door off a nearby mini-van. He hurled the sheet of metal at Tony, and Tony veered into a dive, catching a glancing blow off his left arm. He twisted with the momentum and then flew forward, dodging a flurry of punches to his head until he could grab the Soldier’s arm in one gauntlet. It was tough work hanging on, and Tony had to grit his teeth against two particularly vicious kicks to his left knee. But after a few moments of grappling, he was able to line up his free hand to deliver a repulsor shot to the Soldier’s chest.
As they neared the end of the count, Steve looked over at Tony and felt his breath catch at the raw expression in his eyes. He brought his hands up instinctively to cup Tony’s face, and Tony tangled his fingers into Steve’s hair, pulling him into a kiss that was as fierce a promise as any they’d made during a year’s worth of firefights and hospital recovery rooms. When they came up for air, Steve left his forehead pressed gently to Tony’s, relaxing into the feeling of Tony sweeping his fingers across the nape of Steve’s neck.
He had just lifted the ledgers from the cabinet shelf, when he suddenly let out a gasp, the books thumping to the floor as his hands flew to his left side. A horrible grimace passed over his face, and Tony felt a sensation like a poniard pierce through his chest. Steve caught himself a moment later, his arms dropping so quickly that the motion sent another wince across his features, but it wasn’t fast enough to stop the horrible idea coalescing in Tony’s mind.
“I don’t believe anything you’re saying,” Tony insisted. “So you can cut the ESP-KGB mind tricks and open the goddamn door!”
am I looking so fuckable,” Tony answered, trying to shape the tension in his voice into something more like disdain than nervousness, “and the answer is: ‘I am always fuckable, and it’s never for you.’”
Coulson must have understood some additional message in Clint’s movement, because he too relaxed marginally, unclasping his arms and letting them fall lightly on the edge of the island.
Clint swayed visibly enough that Natasha caught his arm. Her own face had gone very still and pale, the red line of blood on her cheek standing out in stark contrast to the set line of her jaw.
Skye turned her attention back to her laptop, fingers flying over the keys to bring up a series of additional images on the holo projector in the middle of the table. The team took seats on either side as she began her explanation.
“I’m not sure I’m fighting the right battles,” Steve said finally, snapping Tony out of his reverie.
After depositing Clint onto a nearby roof where he could get into sniping position, Tony dove at the Solider and knocked him backward into a parked car. The Solider retaliated with a flurry of bullets, but Tony twisted into the air, whirling through an evasive maneuver until he could blast the gun out of the Soldier’s hand.
Tony broke eye contact, his shoulders twitching partway toward a shrug. Sensing he’d made about as much progress toward convincing Tony of the truth as he could reasonably expect to make, Steve decided to beat a tactical retreat.
For a moment, Steve hesitated as he stared after the retreating form of his partner, the outline of Tony’s movements barely separated from the shadowy house by the searching beam of a flashlight. Then he pivoted firmly back toward his car with a shake of his head.
“Sure, yeah, of course,” Tony replied, tucking the notebook into the inside pocket of his overcoat. “I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Shit, Cap,” Clint swore. Natasha gave Steve’s foot a squeeze, and Rhodey threw a small smile Tony’s way. They’d just gotten to the part of the movie when what had looked like disaster and fracture turned out to be collaboration, and it was a little cheesy, but, then again, Tony had been experimenting with letting himself fall for things that were a little cheesy sometimes. He nestled his head onto Steve’s shoulder and took one of the ginger snaps Thor was passing around.
“I’m here and I brought the files you asked for,” Steve said evenly. “So let Stark go, and we can do this the easy way.”
Tony narrowed his eyes, spun around to confirm the appearance of the brick wall, and then spun back to his host.
“I’m not worried about the missions, Tony,” Steve interjected, heaving a sigh of exasperation. “I’m worried about
“So you admit I saved half the Eastern Seaboard,” Tony replied, marking the point with an emphatic wave of the banana.
I never wanted to leave, Steve meant to say. But when he opened his mouth, all he could hear was a wet huff of air.
story about the afterparty for the men’s World Cup quarterfinal, Steve was less surprised to find himself on the receiving end of Tony Stark’s attention than he was to realize that the tabloid photos had totally failed to do justice to his eyelashes.
“You built a neural network that analyzes squash,” Bruce said flatly, “and you attached it to a laser.”
“Cap, please,” Clint begged. “None of us want to see Tony pass out – well, okay, only if it happened in a really hilarious way and he recovered very quickly – but that price is too high. You know he’s just going to make us watch
“Go to sleep, Tony,” Steve said, and Tony must have been even more out of it than he had thought, because the sound of his own name felt like a physical touch. Tony found he really did want to close his eyes and sink into it. He barely heard a line of the movie before he was drifting off, feeling the warmth of Steve’s presence above him, almost as if someone were ghosting fingers lightly through his hair.
“No, I mean we should split up in a way he won’t expect,” Steve continued. “He could have picked anyone close to you to threaten – Rhodey, Pepper, Happy – but he picked Bucky. That means he wants the two of us to go separate ways. We don’t know what he has planned, but we’ll give ourselves back an edge if we don’t take that bait.”
"Good." Tony slipped inside and took the chair opposite him. “So how are you settling in, Phil? Enjoying the Dean’s life? I don’t personally know what that’s like - you’ll be shocked to learn that no one’s ever considered me for an administrative role - but I imagine it involves a lot of scheduling meetings that could have been emails and politely denying funding requests.”
Steve thought he saw something mist across Tony’s eyes, but he couldn’t be sure. The more fully he became aware of his body, the more he noticed the pull of his skin cells contracting in uneven loops around the burns on his torso, and it was taking a considerable amount of energy to keep Tony’s face in focus.
He stopped mid-sentence, his throat closing off on his next words, because he could hear crying on the other end of the line, and it wasn’t Tony.
“Could be worse,” Tony allowed, and he found, somewhat horrifyingly, that he meant it. He’d been chatting companionably with James ever since the snow bank, and it wasn’t making him feel like knocking himself out with a paperweight. In fact, it was kind of...nice, really. Almost cozy, after the adrenaline of hunting for the notebook and the stress of navigating the disastrous roads.
“I’m always nice, Brucie,” Tony said, giving his friend a wink over the top of his sunglasses. “I’m a one-man faculty-welcoming committee.”
Tony turned to see Dr. Grant storming out of the cafeteria after him. He was so tired and frustrated that he snapped out, "What? Do you want my shoes and my favorite cereal spoon too?"
Her voice was light, but she held Tony’s eyes the whole time. And if Tony had still been entertaining any doubts about whether she’d figured out what happened between him and Steve, they were gone now.
“I could demonstrate some of the options on you right now,” Natasha offered, even more casually than before. Bruce choked on a handful of popcorn, and Thor had to pound him on the back to clear it.
Steve couldn’t lift his head to look, but he could picture the image. He’d first seen it on the front lines, when a young French solider had gotten thrown into a tree by a landmine. Steve had pulled open the man’s jacket to check for wounds and watched the hemorrhage expanding across his midsection like a dark nebula.
He gestured toward the wingback chairs in front of the fireplace, where the logs obligingly burst into flame, crackling and popping as if they'd been ablaze for hours.
The door burst open, and it was time to go. Steve kept the shield in front of him as he surged forward, waiting to start throwing it until they had cleared the door and he could keep his body more closely in front of Harrison’s. The SHIELD agent grasped the strategy quickly and stayed tight to Steve’s back, picking off gunmen over his shoulder.
“Understandable,” Tony nodded. “The first time I met her I forgot my own name for a minute, and I’m pretty sure she was only using her powers at half strength. Well, I hope those two crazy kids figure it out. They deserve something good.”
He reached into the pocket of his jacket in search of his keys but found only the boxed edges of an old baseball ticket. A quick pat-down of his other pockets yielded no better results, and Steve cursed slightly under his breath as he peered through the windows of Tony’s car and then his own to see if the keys had fallen out onto his seat. No luck.
“Let’s just say you fit the bill,” Clint answered, ticking off the qualities on his fingers, “erratic behavior, reckless disregard for clear signs of danger, that kind of…manic glint in your eyes.”
“Don’t even try to pull the aww-shucks, old-timer card with me, Cap,” Tony fired back. “Your joints only qualify as old if you count the 70-year ice pack you applied. Your ligaments are probably sprier than ever after decades of RICE.”
The swirling of the room had bubbled up into a rush of giddiness, and Steve felt a smile break out across his face. Tony finally looked up at him, and something about Steve’s expression must have set off a similar sensation, because when he reached up to brush Steve’s cheek, his fingers shook.
“Well, you’ve got me there, Tony,” Steve replied. Slowly and deliberately, he turned over his cards to reveal a king and a ten.
“Sure, Tony. You got it,” Steve nodded. “We definitely didn’t play three rounds while you were in Tokyo last week.”
“All right, good, challenge accepted. This bodes extremely well for the success of my seduction strategies,” Tony said in a rush, pressing quick kisses along Steve’s jaw as Steve walked them toward his bedroom. “God, you could just toss me like a Frisbee, couldn’t you? Is it strange how hot I find that?”
Steve’s heart did a horrible flip-flop in his chest, his stomach churning with a mixture of hope and terror.
He was about to make good on his promise when an alarm started blaring over the loud speakers. Either the team had arrived, or some HYDRA agent had finally noticed the sounds of Steve’s escape.
This time, it was finally Steve. Just hearing the voice was like catching his fingers in an electrical circuit, but Tony risked a glance in Steve’s direction, eyes moving rapidly across the new, thick beard that looked slightly singed around the edges; the taut, discolored patches of skin on Steve’s forehead and arms where the burns were still healing; the spot near his upper lip where blood always trickled from Steve’s nose in Tony’s nightmares.
“This you?” Tony asked him. And he must have been doing research of his own, because when he reached across the table to show Steve his phone, it was displaying the
“A bit dramatic,” Tony observed, letting one of his hands run across Steve’s jaw and down his chest to rest protectively near his injured side.
Because truth be told, the event had turned chaotic long before Steve had gotten involved. As soon as Tony had announced that Stark Industries was going to be phasing out weapons development and diverting resources to a clean energy program, the room had erupted in flashbulbs and shouted questions. Tony’s friend Colonel Rhodes had shuffled uneasily out of parade rest, Pepper had clutched her clipboard hard enough to turn her fingers white, and – in Steve’s defense – no one had previously introduced him to the broad-shouldered man he’d just knocked backward into a podium.
“I must have misread your signals then, because I was pretty sure you were interested in what I might do from the bottom,” Steve whispered, his lips teasingly close.
Steve broke off, discovering that he still couldn’t describe the rest of the events out loud: their decision to make a run for it in spite of Bucky’s injury, the whine of the device arming itself, the look on Bucky’s face when they both realized Steve wasn’t going to make it in time to shield him from the blast.
“Important to the stakeout,” Tony continued. “Come on over here, Agent Smartass, and I’ll tell you all about it.”
Harrison still had his hands locked around his skull as they took off, his body rolling to the right as he curled in on himself.
“Your ass,” Steve agreed, a smile tugging at his lips. “And I love your ass: don’t get me wrong. But what I started to realize over time was that I, um.”
Tony’s mind was whirring through the gear changes of about eighteen – wait, twenty-three – possible explanations for what he was seeing, and he could feel the puzzle pulling his attention mercifully away from the rattle of anxiety he’d started to feel when the door slammed behind him. He holstered his gun and slid into the chair opposite Clint (or, in eleven out of the now-twenty-eight hypothetical scenarios, Ghost Clint) and watched him over the top of his folded hands.
Steve swept the smaller man up easily in his arms, running over to where Rumlow and Clint were waiting. He was just getting the agent arranged on a stretcher in the helicopter when he heard the sound of more blades warming up. Shit. That meant the terrorists were going to mount a pursuit. Steve looked over at Tony.
Steve seemed to notice his grip for the first time and let go with a grimace. He leaned forward to shut off the tap, his head tilting just enough for Tony to see the bruises mottling the left side of his face.
“We are looking for brave recruits for an epic contest of wits and skill!” Thor announced. He clapped a hand on Clint’s shoulder, sending him into a momentary stagger, and then hauled him back upward by the fabric of his shirt.
“Don’t you dare ‘okay’ me, you bastard,” Tony growled, dropping out of sight in what Steve assumed was an effort to gain leverage at the bottom of the door. “We are not doing that right now.”
When the box arrived, Tony dove into its contents immediately, eyes scanning rapidly across each item in search of any references to “Carter” or “Rebirth.” Finally he came across a clear plastic sleeve containing a collection of loose sheets of paper. The page that was visible at the top of the pile contained two short paragraphs of handwritten notes, the second of which mentioned a “reunion with Peggy Carter.”
“That is a flagrant violation of the treaty protecting adolescent activities,” Tony protested. “According to the Geneva Convention, I am required to inform you that all references to my freshman dorm room – or to any matters concerning my physical appearance at age fifteen – will be considered an act of war, and thus open to retaliation. I have photo evidence of your attempt to grow a mustache junior year, and I am not afraid to send it to the Joint Chiefs.”
Steve felt a shiver run up his spine to the back of his neck – his hair standing on end as it had when the lightning flashed through the lower floor.
“You know, it usually takes people longer than this to grow suspicious of my ability to meet deadlines,” Tony remarked.
Tony finally looked away from his argument with Clint, and he locked eyes with Steve just as he started to walk into the elevator. He started backpedaling almost immediately, but Clint was tight on his heels, and Tony only managed a one-foot retreat before he collided with an armful of snacks.
, if a person wanted to demonstrate that he had a working knowledge of any pop culture that postdated Jerry Lee Lewis – and thus that he was not, in fact, born with the soul of a 94-year-old man – that person would be able to tell me who their favorite Spice Girl was.”
Steve looked up from the gladiolas he’d been selecting to see a middle-aged woman beaming at him across the counter, and his stance shifted as he scanned for any signs that she had recognized him. Normally he wouldn’t worry about going incognito in public – bodyguards didn’t tend to draw much attention when they weren’t standing next to politicians or A-list actors – but ever since the incident at the silent auction, Steve’s face had been popping up in the occasional news story about his client, Tony Stark. No one but Steve and Pepper was supposed to know that Tony had taken this impromptu trip to Richmond, and if Steve got made while running errands…
"Oh." Dr. Grant stood, and Tony instantly felt bad. He'd been expecting him to snap back, not concede. "I'll just spray it down for you." He cleaned the seat then stepped back a bit, still hovering, and Tony had no choice but to adjust the weight down a truly embarrassing number of notches and take a seat.
Steve wasn’t surprised she had noticed. Hell, he’d practically spelled it out for Tony the other night in the kitchen. If his reaction to one little touch on the cheek hadn’t been obvious enough, the line about brunettes might as well have been skywriting. But then Tony had gotten the call from Pepper, and Steve had remembered all the reasons why Tony was probably looking for ways to let him down easy. If Tony had been ready to move on, he could have dated anyone he wanted. Whereas Steve –
Just as Steve was formulating that thought, two things happened in quick succession: Tony walked through another of the metal doorways, and a deafening noise erupted through the hall. Steve reached out to steady himself against the wall as shockwaves rumbled through the floor beneath them. Zemo must have blown the explosive. A second rush of sound followed: a dull roar of flooding water that was coming far too fast.
“So many times I’ve failed to be fast enough or sharp enough,” Steve continued, as if Tony hadn’t spoken. “But I won’t let that happen with you. I won’t live without you, Tony.” A horrible parody of his usual soft smile stretched across his face, and Tony felt like some kind of alien insect had crawled under his skin. “Don’t be scared. I’m going to go first, so you don’t have to shoot me.”
Pepper was in the middle of giving him a fond eye roll when her expression froze, and a moment later Tony realized why: the last voice on Earth that he ever wanted to hear was calling his name over his left shoulder.
Tony whirled toward the freezer, where Clint and Natasha had taken to stocking a range of post-battle ice packs. Selecting one of the soft-sided ones, he reached out to turn Steve’s face toward him. But as soon as his fingers brushed Steve’s jaw, Steve flinched backward as if Tony had shocked him.
“I know, right?” Tony grinned, setting his new bot on the kitchen table triumphantly. “It scans the pumpkin wall for structural integrity and irregularities in surface texture, and then it matches the results against a database of classic and contemporary art.”
“Just...can’t believe how lucky I am,” Steve whispered. And that was too much — Tony was only human — and so he grabbed a fistful of Steve’s shirt and hauled him into a kiss, feeling a thrill of delight when Steve’s lips parted automatically for his. It was soft and sweet, Steve’s hand cradling his cheek the whole time, but when they pulled apart, Steve’s smile had slid into a smirk.
They both knew what he meant, of course – in the same way that Tony would always hear an echo of her brother’s voice in the way she said his last name. For a moment Tony wanted to ask her, “when you saw what I saw, did you know it would make me do this too? Did you know I’d have to get in a car every time he got hurt?” But her being there to greet him seemed like its own kind of answer to that question.
“Fury doesn’t like to share his view of the field,” Tony pointed out. “It’s becoming a bit of a pattern.”
He lunged to the side to grab his phone from where he’d left it marking his progress through a stack of midterms. He plugged in the number listed at the bottom of the BCC web page and leaned back in his chair, drumming absently on the edge of his desk as the phone rang.
“Yeah, well, the last time I took a break, a bunch of fake terrorists showed up to try to kill me, Barton got shot, and Cap took a header from a helicopter. So forgive me if I’m not feeling terribly relaxed,” Tony snipped.
Natasha’s hand was still clutching the remote, hovering suspended in the air where she had changed the television display. Watching its stillness against the backdrop of the frenetic movement on screen, Steve felt like the order of operations on which he had built his new life was hanging in the balance too. Everything he had done since waking up seemed to be tottering on its base as he watched the car flip over and over again onto the concrete.
“The man is so full of righteous causes they’re bursting through his shirt seams,” Tony insisted. “Which would be annoying enough – where does he get off emerging from grad school so chiseled and clear-sighted, instead of slouching out under the weight of a hundred overdue library books and half a decade of repressed shame like the rest of us – but he also seems determined to take the whole faculty down with him.”
James wrinkled his forehead in confusion, and Tony judged that his chances for making a graceful exit were plummeting by the second, so he opted for a jaunty salute and then pivoted toward the door.
“I’m sure most of you are here for the free wine or the extra credit, so I’ll make this as short and sweet as possible.”
“HYDRA,” Tony cursed, remembering the other part of Natasha’s message. He used the repulsors to push himself off the ground into the air. “Cap, we’ve got to run,” he yelled. “Barton, company’s coming. Do you have eyes on Romanov?”
“You’ve got my back,” Steve responded calmly. Tony paused, studying Steve’s face, and Steve mentally kicked himself for how quickly Project: Don’t Be So Obvious, Rogers was getting off track. But Tony just tightened the arm around his waist.
“I’m ruining everything!” Tony complained loudly into Pepper’s ear, causing her to wince and give him a shove on the shoulder.
“Look, pal, I’ve seen it before,” Clint observed. “You’ve probably gotten pretty good at keeping up appearances – making it seem like you’re eccentric, passionate, too smart for everyone around you. But deep down, you don’t believe that’s true. You think you’re careless, obsessive, always clinging to people and then pushing them away so that you can pretend being alone is your choice. So that you won’t have to feel guilty when the next risk you take turns out to be the last one.”
Tony choked on the words, and Steve squeezed his hand. He knew the end of the sentence before Tony finished it, because his own throat was tight with the memory of a portal stitching itself shut in the sky, the unbearably small speck of red that was a body plummeting to the ground.
But a few blocks out from the college, the visibility was so bad that Tony was considering pulling over and seeing if ten minutes would help. Just as he was thinking about looking for a spot to wait it out that wasn't just putting him in more danger of being rear-ended, the tires lost traction, and Tony felt the car start to skid.
Tony let out a long breath, and there was a horrible moment when Steve felt like he was plummeting toward the ground, only seconds away from impact. But then Tony reached out to take Steve’s face in his hands.
“I do miss them,” Steve said quietly, and Tony stilled immediately. “Every day after SHIELD found me I wished Bucky would show up and give me hell for moping around. Sometimes I can almost hear him telling me to quit being a drama queen, and I wonder whether it’s better or worse that the serum will never let me forget what his voice sounded like. I still get a talking-to from Peggy sometimes, and I’m grateful. But she’s lived a whole life now, and I’m still stuck between two. We can’t seem to meet in the same time. Either she’s decades beyond me or she’s back in the past.”
By the time they got to the banks, Bucky had been long gone, and Tony had been regarding Steve with an expression that reminded him of the night he’d dragged Tony up from the lab: a look that was both searching and guarded at once. Steve had seen that same look so often in the following weeks that he started wondering whether he’d given too much away. He knew how desperate he’d felt when he called Tony’s name, or as he tried to cradle Tony’s head with his arms – he could only imagine what he’d looked like from the outside. But he was so worried about protecting his own secret that he’d never thought to connect Tony’s wary expression with the decrease in Pepper’s appearances at the Tower.
