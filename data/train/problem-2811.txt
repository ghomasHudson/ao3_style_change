Gabriel sucked in a shrill gasp as he watched the bright red punch drench his daughter from the waist down. Jessica shrieked and backed away as quickly as she could, but it didn't make a difference. Her brand new rainbow dress and white shoes were now red, wet, and sticky. Her whole outfit was ruined, and so was her pride. Everyone in the immediate area paused to look at the mess that Sam had caused with their mouths covered and eyes large. Even the people on the dance floor turned to see the commotion. Oliver was too stunned to move. And poor Jessica couldn't do anything but stand there with her mouth open and her dress dripping red liquid. Gabriel's heart shattered into a million pieces. No! How could he let this happen?! His daughter's first date was an utter disaster because Sam couldn't get himself under control!
– before following the kids away. Once Jude and Jess were out of hearing range, Dean turned to give Sam and Gabriel a severe glare.
“Yeah. That's what I want,” he nodded, “That's what that ring means. That's why I said yes. So give it
Gabriel was quietly bustling around near the refrigerator, arranging a bunch of things on the cleanest part of the counter. Sam yawned and scratched his head in the archway as he searched over Gabriel's work. There was a gigantic pad of paper propped up on a stand and a few plastic things that Sam couldn't quite identify. The man edged closer to his boyfriend in the kitchen, feeling more confused than ever.
“What does that Naomi lady want from us, uncle Gabe?” Jude whispered, “and who were all those people she talked about?”
The first thing that came to Jude's mind was the ritual happening down stairs; how his family was trying to capture a warlock – that may or may not have been Clare's actual father – so they could make him break a spell before Crowley took a turn for the worst... but all of that stuff seemed too heavy to bring up. Jude didn't want to talk about bad stuff and it seemed like Ollie didn't want to either. Maybe this was a good time to tell Oliver about the only good news that had happened to Jude in the last two days.
“There's my boy,” Eddie exclaimed, reaching back to hook an arm around Oliver's neck and tug him into the circle, “Here he is, the lil champ. He went and got himself an ol' ball and chain.”
– Gabriel’s entire life with Sam flew threw his head in under twelve seconds. It left the archangel cradling his skull and squinting his eyes, blinking toward the charcoal ground in a daze. Lucifer. They were defending the cabin from Lucifer, then Gabriel broke the scythe. Breaking the weapon must have knocked him out cold, and taken most of his memories with it.
Jude sighed with relief and muttered 'thank you,' before carefully backing out of 'Ms. Porter's' driveway and heading toward the interstate that would carry him home, to the bunker.
Jude's mouth fell open. Death? The warlock spoke to... death? But how was that possible? Was death an actual person or something?
“Si,” Jane acknowledged, sounding exhausted and anxious, “but that is not why I am calling, Gabriel. I... I need your help.”
If Jessica hadn't called for him, Jude wouldn't have tried to sacrifice himself. He would have been able to come back with their uncles and see his parents again. But now, Jude was a vessel for Darkness itself. He was trapped in his own body, forced to destroy the world with his own grace, and from everything Jessica just heard in the study, it sounded like there was nothing anyone could do about it.
“His dad messed him up pretty good. Tried to get him to do things that he didn't want to do. Made him think he was bad...” Jude admitted, turning back to Castiel with large, innocent eyes, “Pop?”
Clare bit his bottom lip to keep from laughing. Jude was so cute when he was excited about something. Even though the demon was still a little disoriented, Clare dragged himself off the bed, took another drink, and shrugged.
With Bobby, Crowley, and Rowena's help, the garage was clean in no time. While Clare's parental group gave the place some finishing touches, Clare decided to take what was left of his wedding cake to the kitchen. It was just a short walk from the garage, and the trip allowed him to see Dean and Sam wishing a few farewells to Michael and Adam in the hallway. The archangel and the youngest Winchester brother were each holding some luggage, looking like they were prepared to leave. Clare caught a small bit of their conversation as he lingered in the kitchen.
"It says 'lubricated latex condom,'" she read, scrunching her nose and looking back up, "What does that mean?"
Dean wanted to make sure he could fit inside Cas without hurting him before actually trying it. He pecked the angel's neck and shoulder with kisses while he continued to prod the tight hole open, wanting to keep Cas satisfied until he could work his way in. Once he thought that Cas seemed loose enough, Dean carefully guided his cock toward the entrance. He had to add a few more globs of spit and give it a good push, but his dick eventually fit inside, causing Cas to cry out in the meantime.
Jessica gave him a small smile, but Jude could tell that his statement wasn't very effective. Poor Jess. She really wanted to get married to Ollie...
Papa gave Jessie and Ollie – and eventually Jude, too – some apple slices to let them feed the unicorn. And one by one, the horse nibbled on the fruit from their palms, making them each giggle at his ticklish movements. When he ate the last piece from Jude's hand, the pretty unicorn neighed and bounced his head a few times before slowly turning to gallop away. Ollie's brown eyes were wide and he was holding both hands to his mouth, looking so happy that it made Jess's whole heart feel good again.
Though he seemed hesitant to answer, John eventually turned around to face Jude and Jess after he closed the motel door behind them.
Jess nodded feverishly. Ollie's face blurred as tears built up in her eyes, too. Both of them were crying and smiling, staring lovingly at each other as they thought about their sweet little girl. A few more tingles echoed from Jess's stomach, as if the baby could sense the loud celebration. With a sniffle, Jess unwound Ollie's arm from around her shoulder so that she could bring it down to rest over her glowing stomach.
Clare and Jude remained side-by-side through Charlie’s entire birthday party; through the gifts, the cake, the conversations and, of course, Jude’s first meeting with his cousin Katherine. Luckily, the newborn was still asleep by the time they came around to her, so there wasn’t an option to hold her. Clare was sure that if Jude was given the chance to hold a newborn – something he wanted so much, but belonged to someone else – his poor heart would crumble beyond Clare’s ability to repair it. Katherine, or ‘Baby Kate’ as Gabriel called her, bore a striking resemblance to Adam. She had his brown hair, the same shape of his nose, and a few other features. But Clare was still skeptical about her being biologically related to Michael and Adam. Like Cas said, that blip on the angel radar could have been anything… right?
Luckily, Dickie obeyed him and followed him back out into the hallway. Jude firmly closed the door behind him when he left, making sure that not even the dog could get back inside. The teenager tried to catch his breath and calm down as he made his way back through the bunker. Whoa, that was so scary. What if that had been Dad or Papa instead of Dickie? Jude looked down at the brown and white Jack Russell Terrier prancing next to him and smiled a little, feeling so grateful that dogs couldn't talk.
Dean shared another look with his angelic husband, who seemed equally concerned for the demon and their son. There wasn't much else they could do for the boys other than be there for them.
“They seem content. Steady heartbeats. Lungs are working. They have decent room to move,” Michael paused to smile a little before looking up at Jude, “Your daughter is enjoying the pizza.”
“Okay. Here's the deal,” Dean began, taking a big breath and glancing at every face before him, “Jude, Jess, remember how I told you that your parents are hunters?”
“But, I do not understand. Why would Crowley withhold this information from Clarence?” Cas asked, sounding genuinely concerned.
Luckily, it seemed like Sam wasn't the only one that felt completely lost and uncomfortable in this place. Gabriel was still clinging to his arm with a death grip and searching the trees around them with paranoia, as if he thought some kind of creature was going to jump out and carry him away. Dean and Cas, on the other hand, appeared to be more upset and confused than anything. Dean exhaled deeply and scratched the back of his head, spinning in a slow circle before looking back at Gabriel.
“Yes I do,” she denied, raising up so that she could look him in the eye, “I've seen it. I had a dream where I was in a dark house and there was nobody there. I was alone, Papa. I'm
hunters. We hunt ghouls, ghosts, vampires, werewolves – all kinds of bad things. And we either help them become good... or we get rid of them.”
“I'm not sure. It appears to be a little plastic man in a blue outfit with a red letter on his chest. There is a small piece of red fabric attached to his shoulders as well... Is he some kind of celebrity? A magician, perhaps?” Cas asked, sounding genuinely lost.
“N – no, you're doing fine,” Jessie nodded, “It's just... I've never done this before so it... it kind of hurts.”
want to have you,” Daddy said with a nod, “but I was afraid because I was so unprepared... and I really didn't want you to get involved in what your uncle Sam and I do... You know what we do, right?”
As Charlie scampered off to meet the twins getting out of the car, Jude noticed his parents walking into the garage. They looked pretty happy, always glad to see Jude come home. Their journey to him was interrupted, however, when Gibson and Grace ran up to great them.
“Which part of town is that bastard in?” Clarence asked uncle Crowley, “Lemme guess, he's in South Side, isn't he? That place is a cesspool. All the weirdos come from South Side.”
“Yeah, anyway,” Sam moved on, grabbing the second-to-last present and holding it out to Dean, “This one's from Bobby.”
In the bunker garage, Dad, Papa, and Oliver were standing and chatting around Ollie’s red truck. Charlie’s shrill voice alerted them to Jess and the baby’s entrance, and all the men smiled toward them. Papa dashed over with both arms open wide.
Ollie followed uncle Gabe to his mommy and daddy but Jude stayed next to Papa. He didn't want Papa to be hurt. Why didn't Papa just heal himself like always?
the sound of Jessie's laugh. Hearing Jess giggle was one of Jude's favorite things. It made him feel so warm and bubbly. And luckily, the memory of it was able to help Jude relax enough to transfer himself to a different place... but it wasn't the inside of the Impala. Jude ended up on the side of the road a few miles from the bunker, where the Impala drove passed him in a blur. The teenager watched the shiny black paint disappear into the night -
“I brought everything we had on magical beings,” he explained, holding up a leather bound book, “including Dad's journal.”
if they knew this was happening! Jess turned to look toward Lucifer a few yards away, where his red eyes loomed over a shining white grin between the bars of his cage.
he little girl suddenly stopped wiggling in his arms. Sam looked down at her, wondering why she seemed so calm all of the sudden. She was staring back up at him and her usually emerald-copper eyes looked sort of
,” Dean spat, his fingers twitching at his sides as he stared boldly down at his little brother, “You can make-believe all you want that we weren't the cause of their deaths, but we
Dean gulped in the small silence after Bobby's emotional rant. He spared another quick glance at Castiel, who rubbed their son's back affectionately, before turning to give the old man a warm look.
All the adults glanced down at the child next to Jane, making his pale freckled cheeks grow pink and his brown eyes drop away. Sam eyed the little boy the most, though. Oliver may have been cute now, but that didn't stop Sam from imagining him being older and trying to take advantage of his daughter... Jane pulled a small piece of paper out of her pocket and held it out to Dean, who took it and glanced over the numbers written on it.
While Cas slowly came around to sit down, Dean grabbed a nearby bottle of water, cracked it open, and drank the whole thing in a single go. His body was so warm that he could feel the cold liquid go all the way into his belly and zigzag through some of his intestines. He hoped the cold drink would prepare him for the potentially uncomfortable conversation, but it didn’t do much other than take away his dry mouth. After putting down the empty bottle, Dean clasped both hands together and stared at the floor near Cas’s dark shoes.
Papa only smiled and leaned over to peck a kiss to the side of Jude’s head. Dad came around to kiss the other side, probably wanting to show he agreed with Pop’s comments.
“What? Don't tell me all these years of being married to Castiel have weakened your deceitful gift for lying,” Crowley challenged with an arched eyebrow.
Of course, Dean couldn't answer. He was blubbering like a baby in Cas's arms; crying and biting his lip to keep in sobs, trying to see Cas properly through the tears. Holy shit, Cas really knew how to phrase everything so perfectly. Dean's heart was thumping in his chest, sending emotion like warm whiskey through his veins. Damn. Cas must have really loved him. Maybe, deep down, Dean already knew that. And that's why he felt so bad about telling Meg the truth... Dean sniffled a bit, finally getting his water works to stop as he clung to Cas's hips.
!” Rowena hissed, repeatedly shoving Meg's shoulders and making her stumble backward, “Just who the hell do ya think ya are, bargin' into me son's home like this?! Chattin' to me wee lamb like nothin' ever happened?! Ya've gotta ripe pair of bawbags on ya to come struttin' in here without so much as a formal greeting! I should turn yer
Cas didn't seem to mind the playful insult. He just welcomed Dean's horizontal embrace and smiled back at him. Their mornings usually always started out like this; gentle cuddles, soft whispers, just enough conversation to ease into the day. Ever since they moved into the bunker – and finally got their own bedroom – Dean and Cas always started their morning with quiet murmurs of affection.
The conversation in his head only made Dean feel lonelier – and a little crazy. But it was all he could do to fill the void. Despite the awkwardness, he was happy to talk to Sam in his mind. It might not have been real, but it did make him feel a better. Just like the real Sam always did… God, Dean hoped that kid was still alright…
“Well, we didn't know you were going to deliver such idiotic news!” Papa griped, “Carrot-top, you can't turn your back on your education. Your mom is helping you pay for it and everything!”
Jessie was next in line. She was still dressed in her pajamas with her blonde hair a mess. She seemed kinda bummed about Clarence leaving too, but still managed to smile when he stepped up to her.
“Hey,” Jess muttered to Jude as she ushered her boyfriend to the counter and let go of his arm, “Ollie, I'll be right back, okay?”
When Clare gently opened Jude's bedroom door, he was greeted with the sight of his tired angel sprawled out over the bed. Jude was still wearing his white pants and unbuttoned dress shirt, looking as if he had simply flopped over in exhaustion. His mouth was open, letting out faint snores as he lay in a peaceful pose. And Clare thought that watching Jude walk was good. It had nothing on this precious view.
“Dean,” uncle Cassie gasped, yanking uncle Dean down by the sleeve of his jacket to make him kneel on the ground too, “This – this sigil! I've seen it only one other time.”
? Again, Dean searched the spot his son was pointing toward, but he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. There weren't any glowing men in the area. Just a bunch of college kids, old guys, and dads with their children. Still, Dean stared as hard as he could, hoping to see whatever his son was seeing.
“I ain't got no ultrasound machine,” Bobby admitted, “but if you've got a pregnancy scare, this oughta do the trick.”
me if they knew I sent these kids out into that black hole by themselves,” he breathed, sounding a bit terrified, “and Cas and Gabe would bring me back so they could kill me again!”
“Aw, Jessie, it's not your fault,” Ollie instantly denied, gingerly wrapping an arm around her shoulder, “Besides, Paris isn't going anywhere. If we need to go home, we can always come back.”
The lady sighed and straightened her dress before kneeling down to her son's level. She gently took Oliver by the sides and turned him toward her to smile at him and rake her fingers through his orange-red hair.
“I feel like I just lived through my own personal version of National Lampoon's Family Vacation,” uncle Dean mumbled with a smirk as he rang-out the bottom part of his shirt.
When Ollie lifted his head, Sam could see the red around his brown eyes. The kid was clearly close to tears, but holding them back. In that moment, Sam tried to channel his husband and daughter. What would Gabe say to cheer Ollie up? What would Jessie say?
. Sam could feel the archangel's dick with his own when he bucked against him, all the veins thick with blood and muscles tense. The man had to release Gabe's mouth so that he could pant, finding it difficult to even breathe properly when he was so aroused. He slipped his lips down the side of Gabe's neck instead, pecking his body with rushed sloppy kisses as he made his way downward.
“What's up, Pinky?” Gabriel suddenly blurted, staring directly at Dean, “Did you and baby-bird squeeze in a quickie before moseying on down here? The two of you smell like sin and pie.”
To the angel's tremendous surprise, when Death looked down at the scythe in his own body, a calm smile of relief blossomed across his frail lips. When the horseman raised his head, Castiel could see genuine reprieve and gratefulness in his gray eyes.
He carefully got up from the table and stepped around to lean over and give his son a gentle hug from above. He pecked a tiny kiss to the top of his head too, before reaching down to slide the container of pie closer to Jude.
“Well, I can't be certain,” she began carefully, “but that shadow seemed to swallow them up, like it was taking them somewhere. I caught a glimpse of the other side just before Fergus brought us home.”
“Uh, well, Gabe and Cas haven't even gotten all of the pieces yet,” Sam mentioned, walking up to join the discussion.
When he regained his sense of awareness, the first thing Castiel could feel was nausea. Using what little strength he had left, Cas rolled himself over just in time to vomit on the ground. He was on his hands and knees, shaking and trembling as he regurgitated violently on the side of a dirt road. Inside his grace, Jude was trying his best to move in the confined space, physically stating his own distress. Cas cradled his large stomach with a quivering hand, trying his best to get the sickness to subside for both their sakes.
Jude felt a hint of a smile on his own face when he looked up at his boyfriend's pretty eyes. It was nice to think that Clarence always took care of Bobby when Crowley wasn't around... With a few goodbyes, Rowena linked her arm around Crowley's and the two of them vanished in a puff of black smoke. Their departure seemed to leave the kitchen in a somber state. Again, no one seemed to know what to say. It was only after Bobby coughed loudly and inched toward the study that Jude snapped out of his worried trance.
“Perhaps you can focus more on the procreating details, and less on the wild sex antics between you and your partner,” Michael suggested with a grim undertone.
Jessica's heart dropped as she stepped up to look down at the table, realizing that the surface was covered with scattered magazine letters. Was it really a ransom note? Who would have done that? Who would leave some kind of threatening message on Ollie's doorstep? Jessica raised her eyes to look at her boyfriend and found that he was paler than she had ever seen him before. He looked downright terrified. When they met eyes, Ollie gestured toward the pieces.
Dean shared a brief look of surprise and concern with his younger brother. Bobby wanted them to put a portal to hell in his garage? Did he understand how dangerous that would be? If the demons found out about it, they would be using that thing like a highway! This was ridiculous. Dean couldn't stand all this shady behavior from Bobby and being away from his angel. He wanted answers, dammit!
“I see no need to explain my actions to the likes of bacterium such as yourself, but if it means speeding up five minutes...” Death sighed, “I don't make deals often. But when he came to me and offered to kill as many demons as he could get his grubby paws on, I simply couldn't turn him away. I'm extremely old and my... job... is slowly losing its luster. If a worthless being wants to help me further the end of a race, so be it. I assume he cursed a blade to make things easier for himself.”
“That is why your father, Gabriel, Sam, and I are leaving immediately,” Cas explained, “We plan to summon and kill Death within the next twenty minutes, and then...”
“I know that!” Ollie nearly shouted back, though he was still fidgeting with his own nervous hands, “And I'm going to finish paying for the classes I've taken, but I can't do it anymore -”
Everyone turned to look at the king of hell in the back, who was suddenly pale. He glanced along every face with a sense of guilt.
. John was right. This was the way things always should have been. Not just because everyone was happy... but because Cas was with a woman. With Meg. Dean never gave Cas the chance to experiment; to go out, try being with the opposite gender, live a societal 'normal' existence. No, Dean took him and knocked him up without so much as a warning. '
“Papa?” Jess said, sitting up in Gabe's lap to stare at him in question, “Why did you yell at me? Why did we leave?”
Sam's eyebrows curved together as he helped his nephew get out of the Impala. Glowy man? Who was that? Was it some sort of imaginary friend that Jude created for himself?
Being careful, Jude leaned forward to lay them both down. The angel rolled off his husband, gradually pulling Clare’s erection out to keep most of the fluid inside himself. Once he was on his back, Jude stared down at his own glowing body and waited. His heart was racing like crazy behind his ribs, fueling the thoughts in his head. This was it! This was the moment their child would be created! And he would be able to feel every little sensation in his body!
Clare sighed and slowly slid his fingers out again. Jude was about to ask what he was doing – when he felt the tip of Clare's erection rub against his entrance. Shock and arousal flooded Jude's system, making his hands clutch the superhero sheets even tighter. This was it! Clare was actually going to do it this time! He was going so slow; inching in little by little, filling Jude up to the max. Oh, God, it was so big! It felt so weird – and
"But he's sick," Jude almost whimpered, his large eyes housing genuine sympathy, "He just needs to be healed, Pop. That's all."
“If you really do have Gabriel and Castiel's grace, now would be a good time to distribute it,” he suggested.
“Right,” she agreed, backing up to look at him again, “Hey, did your dads linger around in your room before bed?”
Damn, Gabriel's ass was so tight. The peachy lube made him feel so wet and warm inside. Gabe's entire body was shimmering in the light and tensing up with pleasure. And just knowing that he was satisfying Gabriel just as much as Gabe satisfied him made Sam ache with lust. Gabe
The archangel leaned casually against the plastic window and began to converse with the female in a friendly manner, casually addressing the fact that he was trying to obtain a set of crime scene photos. Castiel lingered in the foyer and watched from a distance to make sure he didn't need to interrupt Gabriel's scheme. It genuinely surprised Cas that his mischievous brother would be this considerate. Again, the angel couldn't help but think that Sam Winchester had something to do with the change in Gabriel's demeanor.
Jessie looked at the food on the plate and could see a bit of steam rising from the pastry. It looked really delicious, and cherry pie was one of Jess's favorites. Hmm. Maybe having some dessert would help her feel a little better...
As usual, the animal shelter was loud; full of barking dogs and meowing cats. By the tone of their excitement, it was morning feeding time, which meant that Ollie was handing out food. Jessica's assumption was proven right when she spotted his red hair bobbing along the top row of cages across the hall. The voice of his boss echoed from the back of the building as Jessica and Dickie ventured out of the closet.
A few seconds after he asked, Dean heard a small ‘ding’. Then, the room was filled with dim yellow light. It was coming from inside the cage; the source being a frail, scrawny body lying in the center. Dean watched the weak light travel from the boney figure, up into a funnel at the cage ceiling, across the room through a tube, and down into a large empty jar. The light faded once it was inside, making the area go dark again. But Dean had just enough time to see the clock rigged to the jar. Though he wasn’t sure if it would stop the spell, Dean rushed over and smashed the clock with the end of his angel blade, morphing the annoying ticking sound into peaceful silence. Afterward, Dean walked over to kneel down next to the cage and the limp body inside.
“It's yours,” Dad winked, “For calls and texts only, okay? Oh. And make sure you check the contacts.”
After tossing on his clothes for the day, Sam exited his and Gabe's bedroom in search of the rest of his family. Usually, Sam was the first one awake; other than Gabe and Cas, of course. But it was about nine-thirty now, so others were bound to be up. He started off by checking on Jess and Jude, who were both awake and talking in Jessica's. Sam couldn't help but cringe when he heard the last few sentences of their conversation.
Just like it did in her dream, the room began to shake. Loose tools and metal cabinets in the garage started to rattle, adding terrifying sound to the already chaotic scene. Jessica quickly braced both of her hands on the hood and turned her grace on, lighting up her hands to get ready to fly the Impala – and her entire family – to safety. She could feel and hear the large crack beginning to form between her feet, snaking its way across the concrete floor, but she didn’t look down this time. She closed her eyes and focused on the task at hand instead.
Ollie seemed too stunned to reply right away. He only blinked at Dad with confusion as the red slowly disappeared from his face. Jude found his reaction kind of amusing. Did he really think that Dad would be mad at him? Jude's dad would never get mad at Ollie; especially not as mad as Ollie's dad would be... Ollie slowly reached out to take the black bag with a nervous nod.
. Both of them had followed the angel into the diner and were now running for him, holding their weapons at the ready.
“Whoa, man,” Gabriel said quietly, shuffling his steps, “That was deep. Like, 'Pink Floyd' deep. It gave me a headache just thinking about it.”
“I think he said some guy came to his house and gave him the key and the map. Said the guy kinda looked liked dad, but Bobby was drunk at the time, so he doesn't really remember,” Sam mentioned.
; because of his and Cas's history. So what, Dean and Cas had killed a few angels? Angels killed each other all the time! Did they really think that Dean and Cas's kid would
Meg seemed equally awed and ashamed. She gulped and shook her head in confusion, timidly looking away.
“Ew. Somebody must have listened to that new Justin Bieber album, 'cause they blew chunks in the sink,” Gabriel murmured.
Sam and Gabriel both smiled down at the pitiful dog in their daughter's tiny arms. Aw, the poor guy wasn't even wagging his tail. He clearly didn't like being covered in toilet paper.
Dean glanced from Cas to the archangel, feeling a little bit of hope flicker in his chest. She wasn't dead? She was still alive? Before Dean could ask the archangel if it was true, Gabriel was leaning forward to press his lips to the little girl's temple. The lights in the room flickered and a rush of air and energy fill the space as the archangel's lips glowed against the child's head –
All three sets of eyes turned to gaze at the archangel, who could feel the weight of his decision tugging at his stomach. His feet shifted around on the gray dirt as he glanced among his family.
Dean raised up the false bottom of the trunk and tossed his pistol inside without even looking at it. For the first time in his adult life, Dean didn't want to be around any weapons. The sight of blades and bullets made him feel sick. Dean didn't want to be the one holding a gun. Not if it made his son afraid of him...
Castiel searched his brother's worried face, feeling the same wave of shock and fear crest over himself. Though they had not witnessed it, Cas and Gabriel both knew that Sam had been injured somehow. His raspy voice was still playing in both of their minds as gunshots continued to echo from inside the confines of the warehouse.
Oliver and Jessica both blinked at him in shock. He had sold his favorite car? And he wanted to give Jess and Ollie the money from it? Really?! Ollie carefully took the envelope and looked inside, where countless paper bills were shoved inside.
Dean tensed immediately, unsure of who would be brave enough to just walk into a king’s quarters without knocking. The sound of heeled boots clacked into the room, escorting the curvy figure they belonged to. It only took one glance for Dean to recognize Meg. The demoness was wearing the same meatsuit he remembered from the last time he saw her; short, brunette, brown eyes, resting bitch face. Her ruby lips were turned downward when she walked up to stand next to Cas and look Dean over.
Jude's sentence stopped abruptly when he tripped over his own feet and landed flat on his ass. Clare covered his own mouth to prevent his laugh from falling out as he watched the poor drunk angel roll around on the floor. The sight was hilarious, but now Clare was starting to feel a little guilty. Jude was waaay too drunk. Maybe he and Jessica had given him a little too much alcohol. To help his poor husband, Clarence reached down to scoop both arms under Jude before hoisting the guy up into his arms. He quickly walked Jude over to lay him on the bed afterward, where Jude bounced a bit.
"Me too," Sam replied to the phone, "Anyway, I'm really sorry for messing up your night with Jess... And I was wondering if maybe you would like to take her out on another date soon, since I ruined the first one."
sad. Poor Dad. He probably didn't even have to use the bathroom. He probably just wanted to check and see if uncle Bobby had figured out a way to find Papa and Jude yet because he missed them so much...
One of Sam's hands fell between Gabriel's open thighs to take hold of the archangel's erection again. Gabe let out a throaty gasp when Sam started to pump it, seeming surprised and eager. Sam stroked Gabe's dick as fast and tightly as he would his own, wanting to give Gabriel all the pleasure. Gabe rocked right along with Sam's thrusting motions, clinging to the man's face and hair with trembling hands.
Jude gulped down the taste of watermelon and cradled his own warm stomach. Even though he felt like exploding with panic, Jude forced himself to take slower breaths. The last thing he wanted was to put his children in harms way. If staying calm would help keep them calm, he would do whatever it took.
“I know it is, buddy. Trust me, I know,” Dean replied, remembering how terrifying his own first flight on a plane was, “but Papa and I got you something that might help it not be so scary.”
Jessica heard the lady’s voice ask the question but couldn’t answer. She could feel moisture threatening to cloud her eyes and was too afraid to make eye contact with the stranger in her house. Thankfully, Oliver was kind enough to cover for her.
"You're different than I thought you'd be," Clarence hissed behind him, sounding disappointed, "You're too soft... Just an innocent kid... I guess you have your faggot parents to thank for that - "
Clare could feel his heartbeat picking up speed when Crowley turned to face him. The king’s eyes were tinted with regret when he spoke again.
“Goodnight, Jude. Don't stay up too late, okay? And remember, we're just right down the hall if you need us,” Daddy said, scooting toward the tunnel out.
The man's voice was deep and accented, though Jessica couldn't tell which country it was from. He was obviously talking to Rowena and Jess was glad. Because, at the moment, she couldn't find the nerve to turn around. Beside her, Rowena gave a giggle.
Jessica was about to ask why they couldn’t drive, but remembered that the keys were probably somewhere with the rest of Dean’s possessions. With a heart that sat like a heavy rock in her chest, Jessica slunk forward and put her hands back on the cold hood of the car. It was nice to see Cas’s hands rest near hers. His glowed blueish-white and hers turned gold as they thought of Jude’s house only a few miles away, and took their family away from what was left of their home.
Normally, angels – archangels, especially – had to drink a shit ton of alcohol for their vessels to even get a buzz. When they left the club, Gabriel knew he must have consumed most of the bar's entire stock, because he was stumbling in the parking lot like a newborn giraffe on an ice skating rink. He was so glad that his daughter was there to escort him to the car – and that the smile had returned to her precious face. Gabe was genuinely worried that his baby girl was embarrassed by him getting up on stage in girly clothes, but talking to Clarence must have helped her. Jessie seemed more like her usual bright and bubbly self by the time they headed home.
As he looked down at the wet, warm baby in the crook of his arm, Clare felt stronger than he ever had before. His son was there, nestled comfortably in his arms, in the safest place possible. Nothing was ever going to hurt him as long as Clare was around. Nothing would ever hurt his daughter, either. And he would sweetly tell her that as soon as he got to hold her, too.
Dean exhaled with relief, thankful that his brothers-in-law still had no idea how kinky he and Cas were…
," Ollie emphasized, sounding like he had just heard the craziest idea ever, "Plus, I don't want to make my dad upset... I promise I'll take it back to my dad's house next weekend and stash it there, but I need a place to hide it for now. Please, Jude? Can you just hide this bag in the bunker for me? I'll do anything you want!
“Hey there, lil' nephew,” Gabriel said loudly, reaching up to tap on the tight bump, “It's me, again! Your uncle Gabe! Say, do you know how to do the Macarena? What about the electric slide? The whip? The nae-nae? Can you moonwalk, yet?”
The angel softly laid his hand on the hood and fastened his eyes to the sleek metal, as if he was feeling it with celestial energy. Cas was touching the Impala the same way he always touched Dean, gently and affectionately, being careful not to hurt it. Dean secretly enjoyed watching the angel handle his car that way, like he was touching his lover's body. Was it right to find the interaction so damn sexy? Cas eventually lifted his hand and turned back to Dean and he seemed slightly surprised.
“A race car,” Jude answered, digging around in his pocket to get it out and hold it up, “Look, Daddy, the doors open too!”
“Yeah, but I – I had a surprise for you,” he admitted softly, looking sad, worried, and terrified all at once.
Clare firmly gripped his fiance's hand when Meg finally spun around to face them again. She seemed highly impressed by the room she was standing in. She withdrew a hand from her jacket pocket to gesture around.
Oh. Ollie looked really familiar today. He was always familiar to Jess, of course, but today he looked even more so somehow. There was some peach-fuzz on his cheeks, probably because he had forgotten to shave or something, and he was wearing a red shirt with long sleeves that really brought out the cocoa in his eyes. She had seen him look exactly like this before, but when? Where? It seemed so long ago, she could hardly remember which dream it was from.
The eerily hopeful voice was enough to make chills inch across the demon's skin. Oh, God. It worked. The warlock was in the salvage yard... Oliver paused his recital of the Latin to turn around and look behind them with a gulp. Jude turned around next, to glare at the bastard with the fiercest scowl Clare had ever seen on his sweet face. But Clare, the main focus of the warlock's attention, was momentarily paralyzed with fear. '
forget his child’s birthday… if he had a child… Though his own heart surged with pain at the thought, Jude ignored it to reach over and pat his friend on the shoulder.
separate potion bottles. Clare looked between both glasses, seeing that the orange color and slimy textures in each looked identical. It was the same potion in two different bottles, but why? Would Jude have to take it too? That didn’t make sense. They needed his grace to carry the baby.
Once again, an explosion of cheering and applause came from behind Jude, but he was barely aware of it. Because as soon as Clare finished the song, Jude jolted out of his seat and dashed over to clobber Clare with a gigantic kiss. The angel grabbed both sides of the demon's face and dove in, forcing Clare against the back of his chair so that Jude could lean over and furiously make out with him. It was the only way Jude knew how to properly thank his husband for that amazing, breathtaking song. It was so beautiful! Jude would never be able to get that melody out of his head!
Jude chuckled and started to follow the group as it migrated toward the exit. Grace, with her new Kalimba in hand, raced through the crowd to get to Jude and hold her arms up. Jude swiftly picked up his little girl to carry her through the bunker, eyeing her adorable face as he went.
Putting on his best smile, Jude stood up from the bed and reached out to take Clare's free hand. It was all tensed up, like he was full of anxiety, but his fingers willingly greeted Jude's.
“It's alright, buddy. Clare just needs some time,” he reminded as kindly as he could, “Why don't you just keep him company until he's ready to talk?”
Sam had not been in very many committed relationships – and Dean hadn't either, really. It was just unspoken Winchester knowledge that you didn't get close to someone unless you wanted them to die. Hell, they had talked enough about that today at Bobby's group therapy session. But now that Sam was with Gabriel, Dean could see just how much that archangel meant to his little brother. When Gabriel was around, it was like the sun was always shining on Sam's face. The kid was all smiles all the time. And when the trickster was gone – like he was in that very moment – there didn't seem to be a trace of sunshine anywhere. Sammy's face was bland and troubled, as gray as the clouds on a stormy day. There used to be a time when Sam's face lit up when
Sam blindly searched around the wall for the light switch and turned it on before shuffling over to the bathroom sink. The whole counter was cluttered with numerous toothbrushes, hairbrushes, bath toys, and damp towels; the messy result of a bathroom having to be shared with four grown-ups and two toddlers. Sam yawned again as he rinsed his hands off and dug around the mess for his own toothbrush. He was hoping to at least get rid of his morning breath before speaking with anyone.
Even though they had just experienced a very emotional and dramatic moment together, the three of them all nodded to answer the children. Castiel did not want to share the private encounter on the bridge with anyone else. Though they accepted the reply, Jessica was studious enough to see that Meg was crying. But instead of pointing it out, the blonde angel smiled and nodded toward the kitchen.
Uncle Sammy didn't say anything back but uncle Gabe came rushing over to kneel with Jude and Daddy near Papa.
Uncle Dean took a second to glance at all the people around him, even Rowena, who had followed everyone outside. He momentarily shared a defeated look with Crowley before lowering his head.
“Cas said they had to go to India for some spices or whatever. Didn't I tell you that?” Dean replied.
“The entire building is warded,” Castiel informed him, as he smote the last of the demonic onslaught, “We must find a way to get -”
“Holy shit... Our son is seventeen...” the man breathed, his green eyes dropping, “Damn, I'm getting old...”
theirs. The only thing those bastards saw when they looked at Dean was a gay man. A sexual minority. An alien. A freak. Someone who wasn't normal...
"Hey. What are you guys doing in here? The party is out there," she said, sounding genuinely confused.
Everything was still, silent, and dark as night. The candelabras in the corners weren't even lit. Jessica held up her own hand and allowed her golden grace to shine and light up the room enough to see where she was going. She had hoped that her dad and boyfriend would be there, but they weren't.
Jude could feel his own face turning red. Ugh, why did Papa always have to bring up embarrassing childhood memories? Thank goodness none of Ollie's cousins were there to hear that...
An odd sense of deja vu came over Clare as he shook his head. Hadn't they walked down this same corridor before, in suits while Jude was drunk? Didn't that happen just a few days earlier?
Dean eventually threw his hands in the air and pouted as he dug the SUV keys out of Sam's bag and marched to the driver's side. In the meantime, Gabriel caught a piece of the kids' conversation and stopped to look toward them. Jessie and Jude were telling their friend all about their Grandpa John and about what their dads did for a living. Gabe gulped when he heard the word 'hunters' being thrown around. Oh boy. Sammy was going to be really upset if he heard that Oliver was learning all these 'family secrets'...
The only thing Jessie could do in response was let out an airy giggle. Once again, her head was too busy swimming to really focus on thoughts. It wasn't until uncle Bobby cough loudly that she remembered there were other people in the room. Bobby, holding a lit candle in one hand and a large globe in the other, gave each of the teenagers a glance before looking down at Ms. Jane with a frown.
Dean carefully wrapped some tin foil around what was left of his niece's birthday cake, trying to cover as much as he could so that they could save it in the fridge. Geez, why did Sam and Gabriel get such a big cake? It was carrot cake – Jess's favorite – and Dean figured the cream cheese icing had to be kept cold. But man, it was going to be difficult to fit it in the fridge. Behind him in the bunker kitchen, Sam and Gabe were already putting away the rest of the food they had at the party. And gossiping like teenage girls, as usual.
A giant wave of ecstasy flooded Jude almost instantly. It was so massive that he barely felt the warm fluid splattering up his own stomach. All he could do was lay there and feel Clarence all around him; on his chest, between his legs, against his pelvis. Even Clare's scent was swirling in his lungs as he breathed. In all the times they had sex, Jude had never felt so close to Clarence. Having Clare inside him made all the difference in the world.
Jude turned away when they started kissing, wanting to avoid seeing the gross tongue thing they always did. To give them privacy, the teenager eventually continued his trek down the hallway in search of his parents. Dad and Papa were, as usual, hiding out in their own bedroom. Like Sam and Gabe, Dad and Papa had left their door open and Jude could hear their voices as he walked up. He tip-toed inside to watch his parents with a smile.
Dean nodded. He agreed with his brother. Dean couldn't stand the thought of his son being hurt in anyway by anyone, especially soulless demons. But did that give him the right to kill in front of his child? Jude was probably going to be scarred for life; forced to look at his father in a different way. Dean was already starting to miss the admiring stare he always got from Jude's baby-blue eyes.
A new smile returned to Jude's face after hearing Dean's statement. He hugged his daddy's neck tight and Dean took the time to smell his child's comforting scent again before lowering him to the ground. Once he was standing in his little boots, Jude walked over and took Cas's hand. In the meantime, Sam met Dean at the trunk and the two of them quickly and casually popped open the false bottom to grab a few handguns. They tried their best to slip the guns into their waistbands without their children seeing... just like they did every time they went out.
“Oliver, you be a good boy for the Winchesters, okay? Always listen to them and mind your manners,” she said quietly.
Another huge contraction made Jessica's muscles seize up. There was no way she could ignore the sensation to push, now. Her uterus was practically pushing for her; forcing her to bear down against her will. The wave of pain made her grip the gurney and glare down at the arguing men near her ankles.
wasn't there yet, dammit! There was a bag full of gifts in the truck that Jude and Jessica still needed to open before the day was over! How in the hell was he supposed to find the damn place when it was completely hidden from view?
In Papa's arms, Dickie whimpered and hung his head, looking really sorry. But Papa wasn't done punishing him. With the flick of his wrist, a golden leash and collar appeared in Papa's hand and he slipped it over Dickie's neck.
“I w – would tell you if I knew,” he nodded feverishly, making the tears and sweat drip from his chin, “but I fled, Castiel. I abandoned Heaven. It – its no longer our home. I do not know where your son is!”
"I brought the camera," Papa announced to Ms. Jane, holding up the clunky device, "I thought we could take a few pictures of the kids before they go."
“Well, from that beautiful display of huntin', I'd say your middle name is pretty well earned, kid,” he joked.
Jessica took a breath and nodded, feeling the cool night breeze toss her hair around in the dark. She thought that planning to go see the house would make Oliver happy. But he only looked worried.
But the blade never connected with Clare’s body. Because Jude caught it in mid-swing. The pregnant angel had flown from the recliner and was now standing between Clare and Lucifer, his entire body glowing solid white. The curved metal of the scythe made a ‘
Dun. Dun. DUUUH!!!! XD Yep. That Bastard is Clare's father. But you probably saw that coming though, huh? Lol. ;D “But how can that be?” I hear you asking, “Crowley killed him in the desert! How is he still alive?! And how does Rowena know him?!” Not to worry, my beautiful ducklings! All your questions will be answered soon enough! ;) But I will go ahead and ruin one theory for you: Caldwell is
A loud bang echoed around the room, making Jude squeak and yank Gabe even closer. From the safety of his uncle's arms, Jude could see more and more gray light and smoke entering the room. It wasn't until he heard a few more bangs and screeches that the little boy realized that the walls were coming apart. They were being
Just when Jessie was about to close her eyes, the door opened and Daddy came back inside. Jessie only lifted her head up long enough to see that he was holding her bunny rabbit and baby blanket in his hand. Aw, maybe Dad left so that he could go and get Jess's favorite things. He was such a good Daddy.
,” Crowley groaned, pausing to shake his head, “As much as I would love to get you into a hot bath and scrub you clean, this is much more important.”
“We took a trip to the beach and built sandcastles,” Lucifer hummed sarcastically with a smile, “The hell do you think happened? That nephilim brat nearly took us down.”
Sam exhaled but smiled a little bit. It seemed that Gabe's flirtatious persuasion had worked like a charm yet again. Unfortunately, the giant moose and the archangel were interrupted by Castiel, who popped around the back of the SUV to tap on Sam's shoulder.
The man gave his angel's hand a quick squeeze before starting for the door. Sam was trapped in the middle of a monster hug, being smothered by Gabriel, Jessica, and Dickie when Dean walked by. It took Sam even longer to pry himself away from his family than Dean did, but he eventually wiggled free and followed his older brother to the door, leaving Gabe and Jess to stare at him woefully.
Sam kept the polite smile on his face as he flashed another look at Gabe. Welcome here anytime? That was a really bold statement. What if Jane decided to visit while Crowley and Rowena were here doing magic? What if she came over while they were in the middle of a case? What if she dropped by while Gabe and Sam were having sex? Jane's smile softened with admiration.
“Adam, Michael,” the seraph said, turning toward the gentlemen and gesturing into the room, “You are welcome to use this space for as long as you like.”
Oliver huddled close with Jess so that they could steal another peek at all the money in the envelope.
Wanting to ease Dean's distress, Castiel flew inside the police station in the hope of catching Gabriel before he ruined the Winchester's case. In the foyer, Castiel spotted the archangel strolling to an open window, where a desk-worker was going about her business. Cas assumed that Gabriel was going to do something disappointing, perhaps tell her that the Winchesters were on their way with fake ID badges or reach through the window and try to grab something – but what Castiel found instead, was that Gabriel was actually
“Whoa, shhh,” Sam consoled, brushing Jess's blonde hair back to wipe her face, “It's okay, baby Rabbit. Did you have a bad dream? Who was trying to take you away?”
Dean and Cas both turned to the doorway at the sound of their son's tiny voice. Jude seemed to have been looking for them because he carefully stepped down into the room and walked over to hold up both arms, wanting to be held and included. Dean instantly scooped up his son and gave him a meaningful hug; wrapping him into the most tender embrace he could muster. The baby-like scent in Jude's hair filled Dean's nose and he could feel the kid's heart beating against his own chest. Dean was hugging his son and staring at Cas in front of him, feeling overwhelmed with emotion. Cas had given him so much; so many amazing, life-changing things that he would never be able to repay.
Luckily, Sam and Gabe made it over to their daughter before she had time to spill the beans. But the damage was already done. Every kid in the area was gawking at the blonde girl in the red sundress.
“Okay,” he allowed, “Go get him and bring him back here. Papa, Sam, Gabe, and I will wait down in the basement for you.”
“Yeah, right. You’re already dead, Sammy. Stop complaining,” Dean winked. He got to his feet and reached out a hand to Cas. “Let’s go, Cas. Pretty sure there’s an Impala on the other side with an eternity of road-side diners calling our names.”
Castiel could tell that his son never fully recovered from the incident at the zoo. Jude's behavior strongly mimicked that of his human father, to the extent that Cas practically mistook Jude's private anguish for Dean's. Castiel had become so accustomed to feeling his husband's self-loathing tenancies that he almost didn't recognize that the emotion was coming from their son instead. The angel was painfully aware that his precious child was subconsciously riddled with unnecessary anxiety and guilt. And Castiel desperately wished to comfort his son and remind him that his earlier actions were both unintentional and not of great consequence; that while breaking the polar bear enclosure seemed dangerous, no one was hurt in the process. But Cas feared that Jude may disregard his words even if he stated them out loud.
“No, you didn't. But someone else did,” the demon explained, “I came here to save you and your brother, but it seems the candy-coated archangel has taken over the rescue mission.”
“Can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’ve got faith in Michael,” Dean mumbled, shrugging his shoulders as he glanced toward the window, “Dude swore he’d protect us, and I think he will.”
Jude held onto his own otter and forced a nod. He tried to keep the sound of that promise on loop in his mind, using it as a way to stay calm as he watched Clarence finally turn to walk away. The blonde demon was welcomed by Bobby, Crowley and Rowena, who ushered him to the truck to help him load his guitar and get inside. Clare paused at the door to search for Jude's eyes and gave him a wink before climbing into the vehicle.
Though the greeting was directed at Clarence, the demon didn't respond. Instead, he started taking slow steps through the small crowd to get to the mirror across the room, gently pulling Jude along by the hand. Jude, of course, followed his love to the window, where they both peered in and saw the warlock for the first time.
“J – Jude made God come back. When he was three,” Dean admitted, “I mean, he – he kept seeing Chuck everywhere. I thought he had an imaginary friend or something, but... Then Chuck actually appeared in the motel room and talked to us... If Jude could do it then, maybe he can do it now.”
Luckily, Clarence seemed to take Jude's plea to heart because he didn't move a muscle. Jude quickly ran toward the bunker corridor as fast as he could, not wanting to keep Clare waiting much longer. The teenager was on a mission. He knew he couldn't keep Clarence with him, but maybe he could send a piece of himself with Clarence instead. Inside Jude's room, the two stuffed otters he got from the zoo years before were sitting on the top shelf of his bookcase; hands still clasped together with magnets and smiles still sewn on their mouths. Jude grabbed both of them and sprinted back out the door, holding them close to his chest.
Not wanting to worry her new husband, Jess tried her best to sit up and brush the blonde strands of hair out of her face. Though the nausea was still prominent in her belly, she forced herself to shake it off.
Dickie's bark drew Jude's attention back to the bookshelf. Now that he was close enough, Jude could see the very edge of the moose's antler sticking out from the top. Whoa, it was a long way up. Jude really wished that Jessie was there in that moment. She could fly up and get it in two seconds flat. But Jude didn't like using his grace. He would rather climb the bookshelf like a normal human than to accidentally break something with his angel powers.
With a shout of raw arousal, Cas finally came. Pure white semen pulsed from the head of his dick and splattered up Dean's heaving chest while he cried out with pleasure. Dean kept rocking into him, stimulating him from the inside for maximum effect. The look of utter bliss on Cas's face was the best part. Dean loved seeing his blue eyes go hazy and his cheeks get all pink.
“Why don't we go get some dinner, Jessie?” he offered, holding on to her and carefully maneuvering through the crowd to get away, “I saw a little cafe across the street when we came in. I'll order you a big plate of salad with extra carrots, and maybe a little glass of wine? Then we can share dessert? How does that sound?”
Lucifer was slightly disappointed that Death was able to guess his plan before he had time to reveal it, but at least he could still wow her with the answer she wanted. At first, Lucifer wasn’t sure if he should reveal the truth to her. But, then again, maybe she would side with him once she heard it. Though it was against his every instinct to be honest, Lucifer gave in and spoke it out loud.
The smile returned to Jude's mouth at full power. Wow. Clarence was so honest and sweet; willing to do anything for Jude. Jude was so lucky to have him.
Dean was a little confused. Was Cas double crossing them or something? Why would he speak so highly of demons one moment and then trash them the next? Cas seemed to notice Dean’s apprehension and took a deep breath. He glanced down at the angel blade in his hand as he began to talk.
Sam and Dean shared another worried look. Bobby rarely ever asked them for help. The old man was usually able to handle things on his own, so whatever he needed help with now obviously had to be difficult.
“What?” he asked innocently, “Am I not allowed to document this moment for future enjoyment? It's not every day I get to watch my mother ruthlessly murder someone. Besides, my Instagram followers would love to see -”
"We need a strand of yer pretty hair, love," Rowena said, waltzing up to hold out her hand and smirk up at Clarence.
The sound of tiny grunts and whines came from the moving blanket in Clare's arms. Ollie saw a pair of tiny hands waving and grasping from inside the fabric, gaining momentum as Clare carefully stood up from the chair to walk over to the bed. Jess already had her arms out, ready to comfort Charlie before the baby got too stressed out. Ollie's mom and Gabriel were both instantly on edge.
Jude smiled and nodded instantly. Of course he wanted to see his babies! He wanted to see his whole family! Papa wiped the leftover tears from his own blue eyes and took a deep breath before walking over to open the pantry door. Jude could instantly hear various voices of his family from the other room, though he couldn’t make out what they were saying. Instead of coming back to help Jude up, Papa grabbed the end of the twin-sized bed and began to pull it out of the pantry. It scooted effortlessly across the wooden floor into the kitchen, where the voices quieted as Jude emerged. Jude watched from the safety of the mattress as his Dad rushed over to help Papa pull him out. When they met eyes, Dad smirked.
“I can't watch this shit get any worse. We need to go gank Death right now,” Gabriel huffed, speaking mostly toward Sam.
When Eddie's green eyes flitted toward Gabe, the archangel smiled smugly and waved. But of course, instead of being glad to see Gabriel, Eddie's eyes narrowed and his voice sank.
When Sam finally had his emotions under control, he knew that he had to get back to Jessica. But before going back in to be with her, he decided to walk to her room and get a few things. The small trip would give his eyes time to dry up completely so that she wouldn't know that he was crying. Sam wandered down, grabbed his daughter's stuffed bunny and the baby blanket Bobby gave her, and paused to glance sadly into Jude's room before getting back to his own.
Oliver nearly jumped three feet off the ground and dropped everything in his hands. Clearly, he didn’t expect to hear a voice so close, and Jess had accidentally startled the daylights out of him. After seeing that it was her and regaining his composure, Oliver swiped the back of his hand against his forehead and exhaled.
“Well... In that case, welcome back,” the archangel mumbled sarcastically, “I hope you brought your big girl panties with you this time.”
Jude's sweet face lit up with a smile and he instantly grabbed his dad's hand. The kid's fingers felt so small and fragile, even though they had the power to break Enochian cages. Dean strolled down the hall with his grinning child in tow, feeling so proud and
Anyone else might have thought that Clarence was about to go to Disneyland for the first time, by the way he was acting. The sad part was that the more excited Clarence behaved, the more depressed Jude looked. Obviously, Jude didn't want his new buddy to go. But Dean couldn't do much to help his child this time. Clarence had been ready to go from the moment he stepped foot in the bunker...
Once she was ready, Jess met up with her parents in the control room – where they highly praised her and reminded her of how beautiful she was – before flying to the Mexican restaurant to wait for Ollie. Dickie invited himself too, as usual, and sniffed around a dumpster in the back alley as his three humans walked around to the front of the restaurant.
After parking near the curb, Dad got out and walked around to help Ms. Jane to her feet. Ollie escorted Jess out too, and everyone met at the front of the store. Anyone could tell just from the looks of Jane's dirty dress and messy hair that she had a rough few days. But still, there was a hopeful look in her eyes. Jessica would recognize it anywhere, because it was the same shiny twinkle of hope that Jane passed down to Ollie...
way more than it hurt him," Dean explained, "I guess the point I'm trying to make is that love is complicated, kid. It takes time, effort, forgiveness, and a whole lot of devotion. And you'll know it when you feel it... Know what I mean?"
A shiver raced down Jude's spine. Kill? Raphael was going to kill them? But, Jude didn't want to die! Why would uncle Gabe say that?! The little boy glanced up and down his uncle from behind... and noticed the yellow glow coming from his hand in his pocket. Oh. Gabe's ring was still glowing. That meant Dad and Papa were on their way and uncle Gabe knew it. Maybe he had a plan after all...
with us?” he breathed, “What if they give us grief for being a same-sex couple again, Gabe? What if it happens in front of
On the page, there was a drawing of a pair of rocks. Both of them had squiggles around them, like they were glowing, and there was a faint line drawn between them. After looking at it, Jessie nodded.
Jude smirked and kissed the demon's cheek before backing up to look at him properly. Man, he was so handsome. He had such a sharp jawline and perfectly pink lips. Light stubble, piercing eyes, warm skin. So much different than when Jude first met him...
No one answered, of course. But a few more rays of sunshine burst through the clouds to light up the darkened ground.
The little boy reached out to hold his Papa's soft hand, noticing how big it was compared to his own. Jude bet that Papa had pretty handwriting like Grandpa John did... When he stared up at both of his dads, Jude felt a little strange. What if the thing Grandpa John wrote was true? What if something bad happened when Daddy and Papa weren't around and they couldn't make it in time to save Jude?
Dean and Cas looked at each other and smiled, silently agreeing that their son's improper grammar was the cutest thing in the world. Dean's hand slid up to rest on top of Cas's, where he caressed the angel's fingers with his thumb.
The two of them were quiet again, sitting in the rays of afternoon sun that stretched through the blinds of the kitchen window. Once again, Jude was the highlight of Clare’s thoughts. Where was he? Did he fly home to be with his parents? Or was he all alone somewhere; trying to cope with his emotions all by himself? That wasn’t right. Clare didn’t want the poor guy to be alone. Not when the situation was partly Clare’s fault, too…
"Are you ready to go, Jess?" Jane asked sweetly, giving her a warm smile, "I'll be taking you and Ollie to the dance in my car."
Dad left the room and disappeared down the hall, leaving Jude to sit with his cousin in silence. Huh. What was Daddy doing? Maybe he was going to go and get uncle Sammy or something. In the meantime, Jude turned to look at Jessie while he played with Bumble Bee's tiny wings.
“Dean, she hasn't done anything!” Cas argued, “She just came to thank Clarence for saving her and then -”
babies, the worry was doubled. How was he going to juggle two infants at once? What if it was more than he could handle? Or more than
As he expected, Jessica giggled again, which made Gabriel's heart soar with joy. She leaned back and wiped her own tears away with a smile.
While he rattled off profanities, Bobby was shooing Castiel toward the kitchen, quickly pushing him out of the study. The angel glanced back toward the floor – just long enough to see that the man was in the process of painting a devil's trap on the rug – before complying with Bobby's demanding shove. They stumbled into the kitchen and Cas could see the heat on the man's face.
After revving the engine once more and turning it off, the driver kicked up the stand and leaned the bike to the side. He swung his leg off as he stood up, maneuvering around his guitar case strapped to his back before starting to remove his helmet. The moment Jude saw the mess of blonde hair shake away to reveal Clarence's chestnut eyes and pretty smile, he forgot how to breathe. Holy hell. Jude almost couldn't believe that the sexy motorcycle driver was his own boyfriend...
Clare nodded. He agreed with letting Meg learn everything that happened, but Jude wasn't so sure. What if she ended up hating Clare even more than she did before?
The rock that had manifested in Dean's stomach the day before was back. It sat heavily in the bottom of his gut as he shared a stare with the angel he adored. Dean felt that he didn't deserve to be told things like this; to be loved so deeply by someone that all his past sins were automatically forgiven. But, more important than that... Dean knew in his heart that Cas
“You'd best not be expectin' me to sit next to this yammerin' idjit fer eleven hours,” he warned gruffly, eyes narrowing, “I ain't puttin' up with his smart-ass-ness and the stench of his girly perfume fer that long, dammit.”
Jessica looked up to her uncle Dean and could see the surprise and disappointment on his face. What where they talking about? Who was the guy that hurt uncle Crowley?!
“Gracias, Gabe,” Jane smiled, looking so gorgeous that Gabe could have momentarily mistaken her for Eva Mendes, “Are you sure you don't want me to reimburse you for Oliver's ticket?”
Dean put a picture of Cas? On the motel nightstand? Where would he put his son's bike? Would he have to stow it in the trunk of the car? Dean couldn't keep living this way. He couldn't keep traveling from motel to motel, uprooting his child every few weeks to move, not having any privacy or places to put things. It was getting ridiculous! But how was he supposed to fix it? How was he going to find a permanent place for them all to live?
Crowley's smirk softened and his fingers tightened around Bobby's. Beside them, Chuck leaned closer to glance between them.
Sam and Gabe stood by while Bobby and Dean grouped around Castiel, all preparing to fly back to Bobby's house.
What Dad said seemed to snap uncle Dean out of his frenzy. He looked down at Jessie and the panic disappeared from his eyes. Uncle Dean reminded Jess of a soldier all the sudden; like he realized that he had an important job to do and he needed to set his panic aside to focus. After taking a few big breaths, uncle Dean nodded at Dad, looking more like the strong hero that Jessica knew.
Sam gulped, feeling his own dick twitch between his legs. Shit, Gabe's hands were so soft. They were rubbing against his tight abs and hard nipples, making it difficult for Sam to focus on anything else. He couldn't possibly fight his own urge much longer.
“Easy there, miss kitty,” Gabriel said, holding his hands up in surrender, “I don't know why you're here, but -”
The words ‘ice cream’ caused Charlie to get all excited. Her arms and legs flailed, and she nearly dropped Ollie’s unicorn. The look of pure joy on her daughter’s face made Jess laugh. Grandpa Gabe had definitely rubbed off on his granddaughter.
” It was all happening so fast that Jessica barely noticed that most of her family was gone. When the water went down enough for Jessica to catch her breath and stand up on the ground, she realized that she and Ollie were the only two people left inside the wet canal – and that the baby stroller was turned upside down on the floor. Jessica's heart leaped into her throat when she saw it. Oh no! The baby!
“What are you doing here? I thought you guys were finding outfits for the weddings,” Clare explained.
"If you had just stayed home like you were supposed to, it wouldn't have happened!" Gabe pointed out, "But no, you had to go and be Mr. Protective Moose. Why did you even leave, Sam?"
want to feel better. Right now, it felt like she was getting sicker by the minute. Ollie nodded back before reaching down to take her hand in his loving grip.
With Gabriel surprised and Sam livid with jealousy, the witch finally closed the door and rounded the truck to get to the front, where she placed a large book on the hood. Castiel knew from a single glance that it was full of magic spells. Jude carefully raised his head from his Papa's shoulder in order to steal a peek at the old book. Before Rowena could open it, Dean jutted forward to slap the cover shut.
Sam carefully raised his head to look around the quiet motel room for his archangel. Dean, Cas, and Jude were all piled up on the bed near the door. Dean and Jude were most likely asleep, and Cas was probably meditating or something because his eyes were closed. Sam's sight wandered all over the large room, searching the table, the floor, the dark bathroom, and the archway of the kitchen, but there was no sign of a shaggy blonde head or golden eyes. Sam looked back to the empty spot on the bed beside him and swallowed harshly. Where did Gabe go? What was he doing? And why did he leave without telling Sam?
“Dean, it gives me great joy to know that I will spend the rest of my existence with you,” Cas reminded, “You are precious to me in every way... I only wish we could have kept our child at home a little longer.”
,” Castiel denied, taking two large steps closer to the demon on the railing, “Meg, Clarence loves you. He needs you. You are his primary life giver -”
Clare had never been so worried in his whole life. Even when Jude was possessed by Darkness, Clare had faith that Jude would make it through. Now, it wasn’t just Jude’s life on the line. It was Jude, their two children, and their entire family. Because the devil was outside as his children were being born.
From the corner of his eye, Jude noticed Clarence starting to move. The demon slowly stood up straight from the back of the door and there was a softer look in his eye. He seemed really gentle all of the sudden; more calm and determined than he had been all day. Jude watched from the bed as the demon strolled over to his desk chair and leaned over to dig around inside Jude's jacket pockets. Clarence retrieved both the potion of courage that he got for his birthday – and the condom that his Dad gave him earlier. Jude's heart rate increased dramatically at the sight of Clare holding both items. Whoa. Was Clare actually thinking about... having sex with Jude?
"I was, uh, gonna wait until we dropped you off to give you this," he whispered, pulling out a tiny box, "but now is as good a time as any. Here you go, baby bunny. From me and your dad."
Dean paused to look away for a second, unsure if he could continue. God, this was harder than he thought it was going to be… Dean stuck his free hand in his pocket and felt the tiny bottle there.
Jude might not have been much of an angel anymore, but he still had his grace. She was right there, in his arms…
“Ah. Well, as much as I hate to be the bearer of bad news, I feel I must inform you that Castiel is not alone,” he mumbled carefully, “Metatron has infiltrated your little hideout.”
Sam searched his archangel's glistening face with sudden worry, wondering why he sounded so heartbroken.
“Yeah. The store with the nice owner who let you sleep there sometimes,” Jude recited the story with a comforting grin.
Jessica didn’t need to hear the rest of his demands. She already knew what he was after. He wanted that damn scythe in the basement. But Jessica didn’t want him to have that, either. If Lucifer got his hands on that weapon, everyone in the universe would be in danger, especially Grandpa Chuck. But now, he had Charlie. Jessica’s child. What was she supposed to do?!
“It is the real one. Why else would the king keep him locked in that room? You remember the king ever keeping one without killing it before? And what about Dean’s face, huh? It was all shiny and clean when we took him. You think the king would have kept a fake one in such good condition?”
“Sam usually takes the couch,” Dean informed, coming to Bobby's aid, “and I take the floor. It's only for one night.”
To make sure his assumption was right, Gabe stepped forward and gently slid his hand over Jess's bare stomach. He met her grace with his own, letting it shine from his fingers and move freely through hers. Gabe could feel there, lodged on the left edge of her uterine wall, was a tiny little bundle of rapidly multiplying cells. A fetus, just starting to bloom. It took Gabe another second to find his own voice, because it was lost somewhere between frenzied excitement and utter astonishment. And when he eventually spoke, it came out wheezy and full of joy.
Castiel took a deep breath and eased down to sit next to his son on the bed. His thoughts were immediately transported back to the dawn of time, when his father spoke him into existence. It was such a long time ago. But Castiel never forgot how he learned to fly – and who had the most influence on his abilities.
“Or not,” Gabe innocently corrected, “All I'm saying is, let's give it time. She doesn't have to go to school right now. Or ever, if she doesn't need it. Jessica is okay. Jessica is
“Darling, I'm going to need your globe,” he said, “And some rubbing alcohol. And those left-over Jellyfish parts, if you have them.”
Sam finally heaved a great sigh before he swooped down and – to Dean's utter horror – quickly smacked his lips against Gabriel's. The sight of it made Dean's insides curdle like spoiled milk. Ugh! The two of them kissing just wasn't right! But, thankfully, it was just a small peck, quick enough that it was over in a blink. And then, Sam was on his way, tromping off toward the mass of vacant tables while steam rolled off his flustered face.
“Hold on to that feeling, Clarence,” he instructed, carefully letting go to slowly reach behind him, “It will help you get through this rehabilitation.”
the pain she was receiving. Looking at her made me start to question my own actions. Made me imagine what life could be like if I only stopped my crusade and spent my time with her... I kept Meg longer than any other demon that fell under my possession, because... She became pregnant...”
Jessica giggled along with the rest of her guests as she painted Cas's nails blue. Aw, Ms. Jane was so cute when she swooned over men in her rich Spanish accent.
Papa picked up the laptop and gestured for Jess to follow as he started out of the kitchen. Jessica happily closed her science book - which she honestly thought was very interesting - and scurried to catch up with him. Dickie was waiting in the hallway for them and joined them in their journey to Jessie's room.
Gabriel smiled humbly as he patted Oliver on the back. The kid was giving him the hug that he never got to give his own father and it made Gabe feel all warm and fuzzy inside... The bedroom door squeaked lowly nearby, making Gabe and Oliver both turn to see who was coming in. A tiny blonde head of hair poked its way into the room and Gabe smiled at his daughter's beautiful face.
Her tall, slender reflection greeted her with a smile, beaming from above the most beautiful dress she had ever laid eyes on. The middle hugged her torso, perfectly outlining her slightly curvy silhouette. The flowy, ruffled sleeves laid loosely around her shoulders, extending out from the heart-shaped bust. And the deep V in the back met near the middle of her spine, cascading down into the long train that swooped down around her feet on the floor. It was perfect. Exactly the way she always imagined it.
Jess gulped and looked down at her own body, only able to see her round stomach below. No. She couldn't be in labor yet. It was only Wednesday night. She was supposed to have the baby on Friday... right? Hoping to figure out what the hell was going on, Jessica carefully maneuvered her hand down between her own legs. She felt along her own body, and noticed that she was feeling a lot more wetness than usual. Sticky, gooey wetness. When Jess retracted her hand to look at it, she found mucus and dark red blood painted on her fingers.
what to make for his daughter and her future husband! The archangel sneaked a kiss to his moose's sleeping face before quickly changing out of his dress and into his usual jeans and plaid, and dashing for the kitchen. For once, he was glad that the bunker was still asleep, because he was about to make something that required both human sustenance
“Put her head through first,” Bobby said, as if he saw Clare’s hesitation and heard the question in Clare’s head.
Although it looked like Jessie wanted to keep trying, she did what Jude said and carefully handed the baby to him. Jude’s daughter felt extremely small against his chest. She was wet and limp, but looked heartbreakingly beautiful. Jude kissed her moist forehead before holding her close to his own mouth. He was going to try something that he had only heard about once before. It was something out of an old lore book, but there was no better time to put it into practice than now.
Even after his hips slowed to a stop and he rested flat against Cas's chest, Dean still found himself wanting to kiss him; wanting to stay high with Cas for as long as possible. In all honesty, he felt kind of guilty. How could he ever think that Cas wanted someone else? Even in his deepest, most secret fantasies, the only thing Cas wanted was Dean. No over-the-top strip teases. No sex toys or lingerie. Not even women. The only things that turned Cas on were bees, the Impala... and Dean.
Jude’s mouth tumbled open. Heartbeats? Those little raindrops were heartbeats? Jude’s terror instantly melted into pure joy as he raised his head to look at Clare. The demon looked just as surprised and happy, standing there with his own mouth open and eyes slightly glistening. The hearts of their children were beating. They were alive, just inside Jude’s grace… but unfortunately, the emotional moment didn’t last long.
Dean and Sam glance at each other instantly and the older brother could see the same underlying suspicion and worry in his younger brother's face. It was clear that Sam could see it too; that Bobby was acting a little bizarre. Usually,
As usual, Jessica's door was wide open. The little girl must have woken up by herself this morning, because she was already playing with some toys on the floor. One of her dolls was propped on top of a plastic Batmobile – which she probably borrowed from Jude – that she pushed around various other toys. Gabriel smirked at his baby bunny and leaned up against the doorway to take in the lovely view. Ugh, Jessica was so sweet; mumbling 'excuse me' to her stuffed animals as she rolled the plastic car around them, making sure they were unharmed. That charming politeness had to come from her Daddy. Sam was the nicest guy Gabriel had ever met. It was only fitting that their baby was the same way...
Jude gave his angelic parent one more tight squeeze before letting go and raising up to meet eyes with him. Castiel gazed at his child with humbleness and appreciation, but also curiosity. Why did Jude feel the urge to voice such a loving statement? Perhaps the events surrounding Clarence and the warlock had stirred his own emotions. Before Castiel could ask his question aloud, Jude turned to walk toward Clarence a few feet away. The angel watched his son kneel next to the upset demon as he backed into Bobby's house to join the rest of their family once more.
“N – no,” Dean huffed, feeling moisture rise in his eyes as he looked to the king. “You – You have to come with us! Please! Cas!
"Yeah. With that witch helping, it'll get done in no time. Witches are the best," he grinned, pausing to smile fondly to himself, "The coven I grew up with always told me that my mom was probably out there looking for me. She might have left me when I was born, but at least she was nice enough to leave a note. That means she cares, right? I just want to meet her, that's all. See her face. Ask her questions. Maybe hug her... Have
Being as cautious and respectful as possible, Castiel strode into the room with Meg. Her eyes finally broke their hazy stare to watch him come in, of course. The angel decided to occupy the floor with the demon, sitting a few feet across from her with his back against the wall. Seeing him join her on the floor must have been amusing to Meg somehow, because another smile spread on her face and she raised her drink up to take a sip.
Sam apologized meekly as Dean stomped out and snapped the door shut behind him. The older Winchester was met with the sight of the cluttered motel again and had to pause and take a deep breath. Being kicked awake, having to wade through an ocean of toys, and accidentally walking in on Sam in the bathroom wasn't the best way to start the morning. But there was always coffee. Coffee would make things better, right?
Oliver's mother rolled her eyes and muttered an insult about his father under her breath, to which all the women around her nodded in unison.
Jude laughed, too. It would only be a matter of time before the twins started getting into trouble. Clare pressed his lips to Jude’s bare shoulder again, leaving them there for several long seconds before raising his head to look at Jude in the mirror. Without saying a word, the demon brought his other hand forward, revealing a small gift in his palm. It was wrapped in Superman paper, with a big blue bow on top.
Jessica appraised herself in the mirror one more time, adjusting her long golden curls around her shoulders and giving her reflection a small wink, before taking another breath and opening the door. She was greeted by the back of Ms. Jane's clothing shop; the larger open space, where most of the wedding and prom dresses were stored on mannequins and racks. The fitting rooms were curved in a circle formation, with comfy seats gathered in the center. And that's where most of Jess's family was. Dad, uncle Dean, uncle Cas, Aunt Rowena, and Ms. Jane were all sitting patiently, watching the door open with anxious eyes.
“Jessica,” Lucifer purred, “My, my... I never thought that the daughter of my brother and my vessel would look so... full figured? Is that phrase still acceptable? Or do the kids prefer 'booty-licious' now?”
“I use it to kill every angel I encounter. As retribution for it taking your life,” the king assured, blue eyes flitting back to Dean. “… I shall return to you soon, Dean.”
Jude could tell that his boyfriend was excited about Chicago just by the twinkle of determination in his earthy eyes. Clarence was the only person in the room wearing a smile, too. Everyone else was still somber from the events that had taken place – and were
Clarence's rude questions were really starting to get on Jude's nerves. Jude didn't want to talk to this person if he was going to be a jerk. The teenager turned to the side and pointed at the open doorway, wanting so badly for the guy to just leave.
And even through all of the emotional happenings, Dad didn't move from the wall. There was a touch of genuine fear in his eyes that Jess noticed right away. Was Dad still not ready for her to go to the dance? Why was he so zoned out? Why wasn't he happy and celebrating like everyone else?
- he wouldn't want his dad to freak out. It wouldn't be fair of John to deny Dean the opportunity of loving whoever he wanted, regardless of race or gender, just because he didn't approve of Cas. That was for Dean to decide, not John... And Dean recognized that this was another chance for him to be a better father than his own. He had to let
With everything in place, there was nothing left to do but wait for Jane's family to arrive. Dean, Sam, Gabriel, Jessica, Jude, Clare, and Castiel all stood in the control room and stared toward the main entrance, awaiting the bombardment of Jane's family. It came in a wave of loud Spanish chattering. Gabriel answered the knock at the door and welcomed several unfamiliar faces into the bunker. There were seven people in all; an elderly man, a man and a woman who were married, three young females, and one woman who looked very much like Jane. Jane herself made her way in to hug each and every member of the Winchester family. Castiel was secretly relieved that she was not sick from drinking the night before.
' just like he said – and the box popped open. A giggle escaped Jess's smiling lips as she lifted the lid to look down inside, where another tiny present was hidden. She took the tiny object and unwrapped it to reveal a small pocket knife, just like the one that Daddy had in the glove box of the Impala. Only this one was made of purple metal.
“Gabe,” the man said, giving him the most comforting look he could muster, “I'm... I'm glad your dad finally answered you.”
“Ugh, would ya just look around, puppet?” Rowena said, gesturing to the crowd, “See all of these faces?”
“Yep. We've got the whole lot to ourselves,” Ollie beamed, “Tell me again why you want to get married at the playground?”
Papa's glowing hands slowly released Jude's head and lowered to his sides, letting Jude finally stand up straight and stretch his back. Though his blue eyes were still a little apprehensive, Papa sighed in defeat.
“I think Papa is going to meet us here later, Jude. He's got a lot of things to do right now,” Dean explained, “Hop up. Let's get you out of there.”
The older angel gasped and leaned back to look down at Jude’s face in shock. Jude blinked up at his Papa, seeing that his face was wet with tears and smudged with blood. Only after staring at Jude for several seconds did Papa exhale and sob one more time.
Crowley and Bobby both rolled their eyes at Rowena's dramatic statement. Jessica's parents, however, felt the urge to intervene.
! Dammit, why would she put herself at risk like that?! Clare clung to Jude’s hand and stood still when Meg turned to face him. Her eyes were super soft, mouth set with determination. How could she be so calm?!
The angel carefully rolled over on the bed to face Dean beside him, hoping that changing his position would dull the pain in his spine. But it did not help. Soreness continued to throb from the small of his back, echoing around to the front of his torso. Unable to remain asleep, Castiel exhaled and blinked his eyes open. His glowing body was nearly the only source of light in Bobby's study, save the tiny sliver of daylight peeking from between the closed curtains of the window. Dean was resting peacefully on his back next to Castiel and they were both still naked from the passionate intercourse they had shared only hours before.
"That sounds perfect," Sam agreed, "How about Gabe and I take you guys at about one o'clock tomorrow and drop you off? I promise I won't come back until you're ready to leave."
' He knew he needed to put it in a way that wasn't so obvious. Maybe mask it with a personal question.
Clarence instantly started to freak out. Oh, shit. Why did Jude have to start a sentence like that? Whatever came out of his mouth next was sure to be awful! How was Clare supposed to prepare himself?
“Your guess is as good as mine, dude,” Dean shook his head, “I mean, it sounds like he really wants to, but the only thing holding him back is the fact that Crowley's a demon.”
With Papa's help, Jude quickly got out of bed and hurried out of the pillow fort. When they got through the maze of pillows and blankets, Papa led the way to the kitchen down the hall. Everybody was wake and talking inside; even Ollie and Jessie, who were sitting at the table with bowls of cereal. Jude raced over to join his friends, glad to see them awake again.
Jude’s voice was shaky with emotion; sincere and pained to the core... but Clare couldn’t stop the chuckle that fell out of his mouth. Jude was the kindest, most beautiful soul in the world, but he could be pretty dumb sometimes. The humorous sound made Jude’s eyebrows snap together in confusion.
All of the ladies giggled as the first female agreed, but Castiel was a bit lost. Boom-boom in the bedroom? What did that mean? Was it an analogy for something? Did it refer to sexual intercourse?
The angel could feel a smile on his own lips as he inched closer to his teenage son. It was eerily uncanny how similar Jude and Dean were when it came to sleep. If Cas only spared a single glance at Jude, he could have mistaken the teenager for his father. Single arm tucked under his pillow, mouth slightly open and snoring, spiked oak hair tossed in all directions, freckled nose scrunching every so often, closed eyelids flickering... Jude was Dean made over. But of his physical attributes, there was still one thing that drastically separated the two of them.
“There's nothing we can do,” Michael replied, still holding onto Clarence's arm, “This is Jude's fight, now.”
“It’s gonna be okay, Gabe,” Sam whispered before pecking a kiss to the top of his husband’s blonde head, “I’m here for you.”
Clare opened his hands and shrugged as if he didn't understand why Jessie's dad was so annoyed with the flirtatious talk. Fortunately, Jess had gotten used to her Dad's over-protectiveness and was able to wave it off. The teenage girl grabbed a grapefruit and settled into a seat across from Clare at the island with a warm smile.
“Relax, moose,” Gabe soothed, reaching up to pet Sam's hair again, “This is going to be fun. Especially for the kids.”
Castiel smiled as he got up to follow his happy son to Jessica's room. The angel leaned into the doorway to watch the two children interact, finding them irresistibly cherubic. Jude entered his cousin's room and walked to her bedside in a calm, respectful manner. Dickie was sleeping at the end of her bed but never stirred, even as Jude reached over to gently tug on Jessica's shoulder.
“I – I'm so sorry!” she wept, her arms trembling around her parents, “I – I tried so hard! But I couldn't – I couldn't stop it!”
“Well, you’re not a naïve girl,” Lucifer pointed out in a purring tone, “And I’m not here to make you eat anything. I only want to borrow something from you.”
Cas's expression contorted and he shook his head in confusion. Man, Dean really wished he could put this in a way Cas would understand. The man sighed and slid his hands over to grasp Cas's fingers, holding the bumble bee with him.
There was a distinct shift in the air after the last word reverberated off the garage walls. An icy chill raced through the area, making goosebumps rise on Sam's skin. Bobby and the Winchesters all stared hard at the stone arch in front of them, watching as the empty space in the center began to change. A red mist appeared at first; a crimson fog that infected the room with the scent of sulfur mixed with cinnamon. But then, the red mist disappeared – leaving a pitch-black void in its place. It was like looking into outer space without stars; a literal black sheet of nothingness. Sam swallowed nervously as he stared at the intimidating passage.
“Yeah. But I'm pretty sure his soul came here, to Heaven. Jimmy's probably happy in his own paradise right now. At least, he's supposed to be...” uncle Gabe trailed off, “Anyway, angels need human vessels. And when it comes to archangels, they need really strong humans... which is why your dad was supposed to be Michael's vessel and Sam was supposed to be Lucifer's...”
Jessie thought for a second about Jude's question. Who was someone that she loved the same way her parents loved each other? There was only one person she dreamed about doing grown-up stuff with all the time.
“Wow,” Dean breathed, hugging Castiel close in their horizontal position, “Best. Valentine's day gift. Ever.”
Jane only rolled her brown eyes and shook her head with a smile, finding humor in Gabe's sarcastic comment.
Sam felt a smile lift across his own face as he recalled Jessica's creation from his own memory. Gabriel was so cute when he was pregnant; so round and golden. The pregnancy and the birth were both extremely difficult, but holding Jessica for the first time was the proudest moment of Sam's entire life...
As Jane and Crowley swooned over the twins, Clare looked over to meet eyes with his husband across the room. Jude was oddly content, standing with his shoulders back and arms loosely crossed. His ocean blue eyes held happiness and peace as they looked to each other. Knowing that Jude was happy – and alive – was all Clare ever wanted.
Dean slung Bobby's duffel bag over his shoulder before reaching down to loop his pinky finger around Cas's. The angel smiled at the action and glanced up to meet Dean's eyes with affection. The two of them were leading the way through the hotel lobby to get to the parking lot with Sam, Gabriel, and Bobby following quietly behind. Well,
Dean was surprised to see an honest smile appear on his child's face. Jude nodded again, seeming glad that Chuck was giving him advice and a nice shiny new necklace. But Dean still felt a little angry. He was glad that Chuck was able to calm Jude down and make him feel good of course – but what about everything else? What about Earth? The wars? The plagues? The famines? The freaking apocalypse? Where was he when his people needed him? Where was he when
“Well, he sorta knocked up Crowley's hellhound Juliet. And these are her pups. This is Pete,” Bobby said, pointing to the one at his feet, “Willy's the one who just violated you. And Humphrey is the one tryin' to fight with himself over there.”
“You know, about a week after we started dating, Cas and I went to an interview together,” Dean began with a smirk. “We’d had sex twice before that, but I swear, I had never been as turned on by anyone as I was that day for you. I kept glancing at you, watching your mouth move when you spoke, noticing every ruffle and fold in your pants when you walked, seeing the intensity of your blue eyes when you looked at me. God, I wanted you so bad, I didn’t think I could wait until we made it back to the motel…”
? Dad must have caught it too, because he turned his narrowed eyes at Clare. But before his parents could protest, Jude grabbed Clarence's soft fingers and stepped toward the door.
Ah, Jude has such a sweet spot for family. :) I know that it's probably a little weird that Cas and Gabe are sending out invitations less than a week before Oliver and Jess's wedding, but I think it might have slipped everyone's mind until then. Lol. XD For those who are unaware, Justin Trudeau is the current Prime Minister of Canada, and he's an intelligent, well-mannered, classy heartthrob. But he's got nothing on Sam Winchester, of course. Gabe's gonna be paying for that comment he made for a while yet. Lol! XD I know that I only mentioned Clare's hellhound once (in the very last chapter of 'Faith') but she's finally got a bigger role to play now. Aaand some more training to go through. Lol. (Don't worry. Jude's hand is fine.) ;D I really hope that you all are cool with Michael and Adam coming to the weddings. As you can tell, my version of Michael is much nicer than the one on the show. Those of you who are familiar with my other works will probably recognize the setting of Adam's house from 'Creation.' (Easter eggs!) And yes, Mike's still wearing the denim jacket. ;D (Can't help it. The image of Matt Cohan in denim is permanently seared into my brain, and I can't see Michael any other way. Lol!) In this fic, Adam is currently a nurse at Windom area hospital. He followed right along in his mom's footsteps. ;) I really hope that you all are still enjoying the story! There are plenty more fun times ahead! Thank you all so so so much for keeping up with this fic. I owe you guys so much... The next chapter – which contains a certain bachelor party – will be out soon! ;D
Still, everybody was worried about Clarence. Dad said that they were all going to take turns keeping an eye on him. 'Suicide watch,' uncle Bobby called it. Though he had come back to the bunker, Clarence still wasn't talking to anyone. He stayed in the same room he chose earlier, where Jude heard him playing the guitar. But he wasn't playing the guitar anymore. He was just sitting in silence, staring at nothing. Many times, Jude tried to gain the courage to go and talk to him; to offer some kind of comfort and let him know that he was still important to other people. But Jude's stupid bashfulness kept holding him back. Jude was so worried that he might make things worse somehow...
“I feel I must check on Jude and Clarence. Because of everything that's going on,” the seraph clarified.
Dammit, he hated being human! Not only was his weak mortal body threatening to give out, but his mind and soul were bogged down with anxiety. 'What if's were circling in his head like angry vultures. What if the kids couldn't find Michael? What if they did find him, but he wouldn't help? What if something happened to Bobby and the other adults and the kids were left all alone? What if Darkness succeeded? What if Jessica was hurt? What if she was dying?
“Mmph,” Gabriel grunted, sounding exhausted but pleased, “There's my knight in shining armor. Have you finally come to rescue me from all this work?”
For a second, Sam didn't know what to say. He didn't want Jess to know that he interrupted her conversation just because she was talking about Oliver - even though that
“Sure,” Clare sighed, scratching the back of his messy blonde head before saluting the room and dipping out. “Hope you feel better, Dean,” he called on the way.
The day after his cousin's wedding, Jude woke up with a dry mouth, red eyes, and a severe headache. But he was also swaddled in the arms of his sleeping fiance, so his day didn't start off too badly. He stared at Clare's handsome face for a few minutes before the pain forced him to climb out of bed. In the back of his mind, Jude knew that his grace had the power to heal whatever was causing the headache – most likely a bad hangover, as he couldn't remember much from the night before – but he didn't want to tap into his super powerful grace. Especially not around his sleeping fiance. Instead, he wandered out of his room and down the hall to his parents' bedroom.
. Usually, the sight of Cas's bare-naked ass would get Dean's motor running. Even now, he couldn't deny that the sight of Cas's hardened nipples and tensed stomach was turning him on. But his nudity was not what caused Dean to feel queasy...
“Jude Robert Winchester,” Clarence said boldly, letting go of one of Jude's hands to reach into his suit jacket pocket, “My Superman. My Jaybird. My guardian angel. My best friend. My whole universe...”
“I... I still don't think it was wise for us to allow Jude and Clarence to share a room tonight, Dean,” he mentioned, voice low and honest.
“Love you, too. We will,” Ollie smiled, starting for the exit as the rest of the guys followed him, “Have fun,
“I don’t know if you can hear me,” the man began, his eyes on the floor. “I hope you can… I just want you to know I’m sorry this happened to you. It’s not fair. It’s not right… But I’m gonna make damn sure that the person who did it pays for it.”
Jude and Clarence had been trying to start a family since their honeymoon. They had sex in every way they could think of – grace on, grace off, demon-aura on, demon-aura off, Jude riding on top, Clare giving it from the top, during a full moon, during broad daylight, indoors, outdoors, under the effects of aphrodisiacs and potions, going at it sideways, doing it upside down – but nothing worked. Until they were almost ten months into their marriage. After a certain bout of sex in which Jude had his grace out, he felt a tingle in his stomach. Jude knew that they had finally conceived because his grace stayed alight around his stomach, just like Jessie’s did when she was pregnant with Charlie. With Jude’s belly aglow, he and Clare immediately told the family that they were pregnant, and everyone came over to celebrate. Rowena bought a bassinet, uncle Sam got a book shelf with baby books, and Clare and Jude were already thinking of baby names…
“Whatever. I don't care if you take the groupies with you on the road,” he sighed, “Just as long as you get it done.”
While Jude lay naked next to Clare with his eyes fixed on his own stomach, his emotions stewed, simmered, and eventually started to bubble over. Debilitating sadness that had firmly embedded itself into his heart was morphing into rage. They had tried everything. He and Clare had attempted each and every plan that they –
“That's okay. I'll just talk to you,” she said, backing up so that Ollie could keep working, “So, um, I don't know if you heard about it yet, but Clare proposed to Jude last night.”
In a flash, Dean was suddenly lunging across the room, stomping over to barrel into the cart of pie that loitered by the far wall. Castiel flinched at the sound of the metal tray crashing to the floor and the sight of pastry flying through the air. Obviously, Dean's anger had not faded in the least... After demolishing the cart, Dean bounded toward the bedside table, smacking the porcelain lamp from the surface to rip the wooden box from the wall. The lamp smashed to pieces on the floor, adding destructive sound to Dean's aggressive behavior. The man was on a full-scale rampage, destroying every tangible thing in the room.
Clare carefully maneuvered the towel into Jude’s arm, revealing their newborn son tucked neatly inside. Gibson was all clean, now – probably washed with the warm water that Papa had requested – and was gurgling and cooing to himself as he laid in the nice dry towel. Jude instantly drank in the sight of their baby, seeing the shape of Clare’s chin and Jude’s small nose in his features. Although seeing Gibson was amazing, Jude felt a twinge of panic as he looked around the gathering crowd.
Less than two hours after Jude and Gabriel disappeared, the oldest Winchester found himself in the lowest dungeon of the bunker with Cas, Sam, and the bloodied angel Alexander. Sam left Jessica upstairs in the kitchen with Gabe's dog, wanting to keep her far away from the graphic action that was surely going to take place. Cas tied the other angel to a chair with some Enochian handcuffs, so the guy wasn't going anywhere. Dean assumed that he and Sam would get to ask Alexander some questions, but so far, Cas had taken the whole thing over.
“I don't know where they are, babe. I'm trying to get this damn camera to work, okay?” Dad grumbled back, smacking the device in his hands a few times.
With the chair open and facing Jude, Clare took a seat and brought his guitar into his lap. He briefly ran through a bunch of song options in his head until the best one jumped out at him. After rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, Clare smirked, got his fret fingers into position, and gently started to strum the tune to “Here Comes the Sun.”
While Aunt Rowena bustled around to get a few things out of her bag, uncle Dean and uncle Cas walked over to join everyone at the table.
“Just spit it out, you sulfur-sniffing cockroach!” Gabriel suddenly shouted, seeming just as irritated.
Gabe must have enjoyed teasing Sam, because he didn't stop right away. He giggled and rocked his ass once more, acting like a true trickster. But he eventually gave in and reached down to guide Sam inside him. The sensation of piercing Gabe's tight hole electrified Sam's entire body. Jolts of pleasure radiated from his erection and he let out another moan, pitching higher and sounding desperate, even to his own ears.
His parents had been right all along. Jude always thought that the buddy system was just an annoying way for Dad and Papa to keep track of him and Jess, but he was wrong. They used the buddy system for safety. There really was power in numbers, especially when fighting the Darkness. Michael gave Jude a slow nod, agreeing with his quite statement. Uncle Bobby, however, still seemed agitated.
“Don’t… Don’t ever sacrifice yourself for me, Cas. Please,” Dean whispered. “We either both survive, or we die together, alright? We die together or not at all.”
Ollie looked at Jude and scratched his orange head. They both thought about their favorite stories. Hmm. Which one would be the funniest to hear uncle Gabe tell? Maybe Cinderella? Or The Grinch? Before they could say, another head popped into the pillow fort. It was uncle Sammy, with messy long hair and a red shirt.
“Daddy,” Jude said again as all three of them drew to a stop in front of him, “Ollie wants to ask you a question.”
Crowley lowered the angel blade in his hand as he looked down at Dean in front of him. The demon gave a slight shrug and stuck his free hand inside his pocket.
Dean glanced over his shoulder to give his little brother a weird look. Really? The kid was defending Gabriel's scent? Sam's face turned a bright shade of red as his eyes flickered away in embarrassment. Obviously, he didn't mean to say that out loud. Dean huffed a breath before returning his attention to Bobby's statement.
Grace quieted down just in time for Clare to see the figure in the doorway. Crowley, probably having heard the babies crying, had come to inspect the room. There was a touch of worry in his brown eyes until he saw Clarence looking at him, then he snapped back into his usual pompous self, straightening his suit jacket and raising his head a little higher.
.’ Why did Michael have to say that bullshit? Why did he have to be an asshole?! Why did he have to be
The nice realtor immediately led them through the front door – the same Jessica had seen many times. Stepping inside was easier than she thought it would be. While Bethany began a long rant about the house’s history, layout, and convenient location, Jessica was preoccupied with the sight of the living room.
After giving him another quick hug, Jess let go of her Dad and dashed around the front of the Impala to get to Ollie. His red locks were tossing around in the breeze and the sun made the peach-fuzz on his face all shiny. He held his hand out when he saw her coming up to him.
Since Papa already knew she was awake, Jessica wiggled her arms out from under her blanket and gave a shrug.
“I... um...” Cas uttered, hesitantly letting go of Dean's shirt to stumble backward, “I'll – I'll just be, uh, over there, Dean.”
While Castiel pondered on the growing existence of his offspring, a familiar rumble echoed up to him from below. It was the sound of an engine. A sound that Cas had come to adore. The angel turned around on the stack of cars just in time to see the Impala roll slowly back into Bobby's salvage yard. Even from the higher elevation, Castiel was able to see Dean sitting in the driver's seat, and the sight of him made a flicker of worry race through the angel's entire being. Dean had returned. And now, it was time to find out exactly how he felt about this situation...
“And delicious food to eat, in case you didn't notice,” uncle Gabe added, gesturing to the full table, “Chop-chop, gumdrops.”
The air fled Gabriel's lungs in a whistling breath. Two days ago? That was the day the Winchesters traveled to Kansas City. That was the day he heard that terrible noise in his head. The screeching prayer that worried every angel in the family... Was that the sound of genocide?
For five solid seconds, the entire parking lot was silent. The word 'yes' had been teetering on the edge of Jessica's mouth, but now she had to swallow it very hard. Wait. What? Ollie wasn't proposing? He was going to
Jude tremble and clung to Ollie's hand. Deal with the Winchester? What were they talking about? And why did they bring Jude and Ollie here? The lady at the desk looked down at the little orange-haired boy next to Jude and her smile went away.
Jude gasped and jumped, realizing that his vision was completely compromised. What happened? Did the power go out? Just as Jude was about to call for his uncle, he caught sight of a faint blue glow. It was coming from the floor just ahead, drawing his eyes forward again. It was a candle on the right side of the hallway, but the flame was solid blue. It flickered and swayed around a little like it was dancing, casting the cool glow on the floor. Where did
“We didn't stock the bunker, Crowley. It was all in place when we got here,” Sam sighed with a smirk, “You and Rowena have been spoiled by Bobby's collection.”
“Wait. So, he's gonna call you both 'daddy'?” Gabriel asked, “That'll be pretty confusing for him. I say we should call Cas 'daddy' and call Dean 'mommy'. You know, just to make it easier on Junior.”
Dean's lips traveled all over Cas's shoulder, down to his collar bone, nipped at the center of his chest, and finally came to rest over the faint line etched across the top of his stomach. The jagged mark was left there when Jude was born. It was a scar from the wound Cas gave himself when he delivered their son from his grace three years ago. The line never faded away from the angel's body even after all this time, and Dean was kind of glad it stayed. Cas's scar was a powerful symbol of how deeply a parent could love a child...
Clare kissed Jude’s collarbone a few times as he dolloped some lube onto his own fingers and brought them down between Jude’s legs. Of course, Jude allowed it, separating his knees even further to give Clare better access. By this point, the two of them had sex so many times that this preparation was second nature. Jude knew the feeling of Clare’s fingers all too well. They were thin and gentle; a stark contrast to Clare’s erection, which was always much larger and lacked control at times. But on this occasion, Clare seemed to move even slower. His lips eventually found their way to Jude’s ear again, where his tongue flicked Jude’s earlobe.
Bobby paused to huff a breath, making the hot air fog in front of his mouth as he pulled a hand from his jacket pocket and held out a folded piece of paper. Sam eyed the paper as Dean took it and opened it up, noticing that it looked like a page that had been torn out of a book. A
Billie allowed the scythe to disappear from her hand before crossing her arms again. She slowly swiveled her head to look around, causing her curly black hair to spin with it.
Before Dean could even blink, Cas suddenly disappeared from the bed. The man's hand lunged out to touch the warm vacant spot beside him in a fit of worry. Where the hell did Cas go? Did he really have to pee that bad? Dean's questions seemed to be answered when he heard a door slam and the sound of water-on-water echoed from down the hallway. Yep, Cas really
Gabriel lowered his head and finally smiled – a wicked smile, full of vengeance – as he raised up his own blade. With the plan set, Dean turned to look at Cas again. The angel seemed less than enthusiastic about the situation but agreed to go along with it. The two of them shared one last, loving look before Cas disappeared; flying up to take out the demons on the roof.
“It doesn't matter,” Meg suggested sadly, shaking her head, “The point is... I heard about what you had to go through. All that – that pain and suffering. All because of me -”
Sam gulped, fearing that the news of his and Gabriel's marriage would piss Lucifer off or freak him out or something. But to Sam's honest surprise, Lucifer only gave a pitiful smile. The guy seemed totally calm about finding out that his vessel was wed to his brother. Maybe he already knew somehow...
“And follow it up with the reason why you didn't help my son when he was possessed by freaking Darkness,” Dad growled.
Everyone in the room looked toward the Jack Russell Terrier, who was prancing happily around Jessica's small feet. Sam was right. The trickster's dog was also glowing; emitting a golden hue similar to that of his owner. Gabriel gulped and scratched the back of his head as he briefly gestured to the canine.
As everyone converged toward Bobby to free him from Lucifer's grasp, Gabriel flew over to get there first. His hands lit with golden grace as he reached out to yank Lucifer away from Bobby. The old man coughed and rubbed his own chest as Gabriel stood defensively between him and the devil.
Being as slow and delicate as possible, Castiel carefully slipped out from under Dean's arm and leg. He was careful not to jostle the bed, wanting to keep Dean in a peaceful state. Luckily, the man only flinched a little and snuggled deeper into the bed, remaining fast asleep. Once off the bed, Castiel rose to his feet and stretched – which brought a trickling sensation to his awareness. Something hot and wet was running down the back of his thighs. The angel gulped and turned to look at his own body, where he found remnants of Dean's semen slowly gliding down his legs. Cas's mouth fell open. There was so much of it! How many times did Dean ejaculate inside of him? Castiel never realized that a man's body could make so much semen so quickly.
Meg was no longer anywhere in the bunker. Castiel did a fast but thorough investigation of each and every room, but the demon was nowhere to be found. Upon hearing this information, Dean suggested that they extend their search field to accompany the area outside of the bunker and that of the neighboring town of Lebanon. With his husband's hand in his own, Castiel flew both of them out into the Kansas night air.
Dean eventually slid the photo back into the bible and placed it in the drawer the same way he found it. He didn’t want the king to think he had been snooping through his stuff while he was gone. Instead of making a fourth lap around the room, Dean finally sat down on the floor and propped his back and head up against the cold wall. A yawn escaped his mouth almost immediately, reminding him that Cas had been gone for way too long. It was nearly ten o’clock at night now. By Earth standards, anyway. Dean wished there were a bed nearby that he could crawl into. He eventually closed his eyes and felt his head start to bob a little bit, sinking lower each time. His brain was so exhausted from adrenaline and anxiety, it started to shut down. Dean remembered yawning once more and rolling to the side…
to be comfortable enough to tell Jude about the worst parts. There wasn't much that could top that. If anyone needed consoling, it was Clare.
With the house beginning to burn around them, Bobby and Gabriel took the liberty of escorting the kids outside. The gathering smoke was making it difficult to breathe, but Dean, Sam, Cas, and Crowley stayed inside long enough to coat the warlock's corpse with salt and make sure it would catch fire too. Dean would have been lying if he said that seeing the bastard burn wasn't satisfying. After everything the warlock put the Winchesters through during the past few days – and even long before they even knew him – it was finally over. Dean stood inside the blazing house and stared at the destruction for as long as he could before Cas started to tug him toward the door. The man covered his mouth and finally tore his eyes away from Caldwell's blackened body before ducking out of the house behind his husband.
Everything went as planned. The ceremony was perfect. The photos were perfect. The food, the music, and the dancing were all perfect. Even the sunny weather and romantic sunset created a warm and loving atmosphere. It was as if the whole universe bowed down to Jessica on that day; rearranging itself so that she could have the most beautiful and fun-filled wedding ever. There was nothing that Gabriel would have changed... except, maybe the end.
Clare lunged forward to wrap Jude into a crushing hug, holding the angel tight to his chest so that he could feel Jude’s heart beating against his own. The mere thought of losing Jude terrified him. But finding out that it had actually happened?! Right under his own nose?!
“So you called every gay-rights activist in the area and convinced them to rally against the principal or something?! Really Gabe? What kind of example does that set for Jude and Jess?” Sam asked, planting both hands on his hips like an annoyed housewife.
Damn, this wasn't going to take Dean very long at all. The heat and the friction of sliding into Cas's soft ass over and over – and the sight of Cas's glowing mouth moaning with every thrust – was enough to get Dean to the edge. The man suctioned his mouth back to the angel's as he picked up speed, clinging to Cas's hip bone with one hand and hugging him close with the other. Oh shit, Dean could feel an orgasm swelling up in his balls already. Just a few more thrusts and his gun would be firing.
Dean turned around to look at Sam, who gestured an arm for the group. There was a wide split in the air that looked just like the one Dean fell through. Gabriel was the first one to get there. The archangel practically shoved Sammy through it first, and then followed right along after him. Dean watched them disappear inside just before the loud screeching started. Dean groaned out loud and dropped to his knees, covering his ears from the impossibly loud sound. He had never heard anything as high-pitched and painful as that! It almost reminded him of hearing Cas’s real voice for the first time; how it shattered the windows and made his ears bleed.
! Before Jude could even take a breath to pray for his Papa's help, he was already falling through the air. He dropped like a heavy rock from the top shelf and expected to meet a hard collision with the floor -
Jude was so sick of hearing that phrase. He heard something like that every few minutes and it was really starting to wear him out. That voice in his head – that ugly, mean, rude voice that wouldn't shut up – it kept saying such hurtful things. But why? Why was it talking to him? Why did it want him to end his own life?
Having breakfast in the bunker kitchen with Dad, Papa, Sam, Gabe, Michael, Adam, and Clarence was interesting to say the least. The elder angels shared tales of ancient battles while the Winchester brothers discussed victorious tales of their own. Hearing about epic fights with demons, leviathan, and other beastly creatures was entertaining, but Jude found himself wishing that Jessica was there so that she could break up the old stories with simpler conversation. The older folks barely even touched their food. They were too busy chatting, laughing, and poking fun at each other to notice their meals were getting cold. Jude and Clare eventually announced that they were headed to Bobby's around noon, and almost none of the others paused their roaring tales to wish them farewell. Jude's Papa was the only one who stood up to hug the young men before they departed.
Cas nodded in agreement as Gabriel and Sam started down the hall after the kids. Dean looked back at his angel in wonder, curious to know what Gabe was talking about.
Cas carefully let his legs slide out in front of him and straightened his back, unfolding his body to reveal the blood-stained trench coat in his lap. Dean's eyes traveled down to the ruined fabric that Cas was holding in his trembling arms and realized that the whimpering sound was coming from inside it. The coat was wrapped around something small. Something wiggling and making noise...
She was in Jude and Clare’s bedroom in less than a second, flashing over to throw her arms around both of them and fly them to the car in the garage. Their previous horizontal sleeping positions were changed to sitting positions as she shoved them into the back seat with Oliver. Jess caught a glimpse of Jude waking up with a gasp and covering his mouth like he was going to puke before she flew into her parents’ room.
Jessica's heart nearly leaped from her chest. Oh. Oh! Ollie was going to do it right now! He was going to propose right now! Jessica felt the urge to turn and look for her parents, to see if they were watching, but she couldn't turn her head. She was too focused on Oliver's lovely brown eyes.
A skewed, bizarre look came across the warlock's face, making the long scar on his cheek twist oddly. He was smiling, but his eyes were narrowed, as if he thought that Clare had said an offensive joke. The guy let out a small, hollow chuckle and shook his head as he took a tiny step closer to the three other men.
“No, Robert, don't interrupt,” Crowley silenced Bobby's outburst with a raised hand, “It's true. We all know how evil I am.”
The demons clearly didn't like taking orders, especially from a grumpy old egotistical hunter. But somehow, Bobby's little threat actually worked. The main demon gave a nod to the others.
“I... I didn't think about it before, but Sam's right,” Gabriel breathed, “We're gonna have to cut the baby out of you.”
“The park?” he read out loud, “Oh, God. Don't tell me he wants you to meet him there just so you can have sex.”
While Jessica tried to help her cousin, she felt Michael and Lucifer grab hold of her shoulders. The teenager fought against her uncles to stay with her cousin.
Even though Jess's prayer rang out toward her cousin, Jude didn't reply anymore. Her graceful voice was bouncing back to her as if the mental room she and Jude had been sharing was vacant now. She called out to him a few more times but her awareness was eventually pulled back to Bobby's kitchen, where Ollie was lightly shaking her shoulders.
, hiding the ocean blue that Dean loved so much. And the strangest part was that Cas's eyes had been closed for at least fifteen minutes. The angel's face was expressionless as always, lips and eyebrows in straight lines. What the hell was he doing? Sleeping? Meditating? Dean loudly cleared his throat in an attempt to wake Cas up. But it failed. Cas was currently blocking out everything; Gabriel's witty comments, the case involving kids... even Dean...
:) How's that for a twist? I guess the best/worst part, is that nobody in the story will ever know. :) But you do! Hooray for you! :) It's been almost three years since I first wrote this story and I've written a pretty long Destiel Mpreg fic since then, so when I was revising the part about Dean thinking that he could never give Castiel a child, I was thinking to myself,
“I love you too,” he replied, raising a playful eyebrow, “but if you try to take this ring away from me again, I'll have to spank you.”
Jude smiled and bobbed his head again, seeming happy about her answer. The two of them were quiet for another few seconds. Jessie glanced over at Jude's Batman nightlight glowing in the corner that marked the bat-signal on the ceiling over their heads. She was so glad to see his nightlight back on. Having Jude home made her so glad.
Once Cas's small speech was over, there wasn't a dry eye in the whole crowd. Everybody had teared up at the way the angel talked so precisely and soulfully to Dean. The man himself was sniffling too, subtly wiping his eyes with the bend of his quivering finger. With a gentle smile, Chuck leaned forward over his bible.
Sam actually felt pretty good after he said it out loud. Wherever Gabe was, he probably knew how Sam was feeling anyway. After seven years of commented courtship and five years of actual marriage, it wouldn't be hard to guess. Sam just hoped that Gabriel wasn't as hysterical at the moment.
Castiel had fought in many heavenly battles and listened to many people cry out his name in vain. But hearing it in Dean's voice was overwhelmingly worse. Though he couldn't see the Winchesters from his current position, Castiel imagined that Dean was surrounded by demons; trying his best to keep himself and his brother alive with what little ammunition he had taken with him. But his bullets were eventually going to run out. What if Castiel couldn't to get to him before the demons descended?
Dean took another deep breath and searched the car again. After a year's work, she was finally ready to roll. It took several trips to auto parts stores, lots of consulting with Bobby, hours upon hours of labor in the garage to get the transmission working and the brake system fixed – but now, it was done. Just one week shy of Jude's eighteenth birthday, his car was finally ready for its first trip.
While Dean drove, Jude was already coloring happily in the backseat, but Jessica seemed more interested in watching the scenery fly passed her window. Sam stole several glances back at his daughter during the trip, noticing that she was staring up at the sky with a curious expression. The weather was overcast that day, kind of cloudy and drizzly, and it seemed to be upsetting her.
Though the man was being honest, the angel didn't seem to believe him. Cas only stared down at the plush toy and sat in silence. Dean wished he could find a way to convince Cas that everything would be alright. Because even though Jude wasn't a child anymore, he still needed his parents in his life. Wanting to comfort his husband, Dean walked around the bed to stop in front of Cas. He knelt down on the floor, shifting himself into the angel's view by taking hold of Cas's knees and looking up into his beautiful, tear-filled eyes.
Gabriel definitely heard his angelic brother's voice. The trickster plucked his lips away from Sam's to turn a glare toward Cas. Dean was overwhelmingly proud to see that Cas could still get one-up on the archangel. It was about time someone put him in his place.
“Ugh! I get it!” Dean grumbled in annoyance, trying to shoo away mental pictures that were attempting to crawl into his head, “I know that part already, dammit! I just want to know
Gabriel and Dean continued to hold their stare for a good measure of time before the archangel finally sighed. Gabriel scooped up the dog into his arms and gave it a gentle kiss on the head.
Despite Sam's constant refusal and pleas not to break the rules, Gabriel ended up unlocking the door with some grace and pulling Sam all the way into the enclosed area. The place was totally vacant, apart from them and Dickie. Once they were inside, Dickie shook his head and accidentally sent the stuffed moose flying out of his mouth, making it soar away and land with a tiny 'splash' in the pool. In a worried frenzy, the dog dove in to swim to it and pulled it to safety. In the meantime, Gabriel took a huge dramatic breath and gestured to the inviting space.
Clare's eyebrows curved upward and his smile softened. His eyes were welling up with tears too, and it made Jude want to reach out and hug him. But he knew he had to finish saying his vows. With the sounds of various sniffles coming from all around the study, Jude looked back to his paper.
Jude gulped, feeling the hairs raise on the back of his neck. That Darkness was more than just dark? It was
Instead of arguing with her skeptical husband, Jessica started to dig around and see what kind of other goodies were lurking among the metal trays. Chocolates, macaroons, cakes, pies, donuts, butterscotch candies – Jessica felt like she had fallen into one of her Papa's bedtime stories. It all looked so good! Which one was she going to start with? She wanted to eat it all at once! Jess decided to start with the tiny square cake bites and work her way in. She went through about six of them before looking back up to Ollie. He was still watching her with suspicion, like he was trying to figure out what was wrong with her. But Jess was just happy to feel better.
. Jude's glow was different than everyone else's, even his own celestial father. While Castiel's grace held a blue-ish hue, Jude's was solid white. Pure and heavenly, just as Cas always imagined. And while his two tiny wings were wide and dark like Castiel's, Jude's feathers appeared sleeker and more radiant. Dean had used the perfect adjective to describe their child. Jude truly was holy...
“Yes,” Crowley agreed, finally joining them at the table, “There will already be one live animal at this wedding. No need for more.”
“Because, like a lost little pup, you need a place to live. And we've grown quite fond of your mangey arse over the last week,” Crowley explained, still smiling with his dark eyes narrowed, “If you're willing to listen and obey, we can train you to be one of the most dangerous hounds on the block.”
After calling for their daughter, Gabriel walked back over to sit on the end of the bed and wait for her. Sam watched the door as he finished straightening up his tie, waiting to see Jess drag her bunny inside with a head full of messy morning hair. Her Daddy knew that she was bound to be exhausted after the exciting night she had with 'Grandpa.' But surprisingly, the sound of fast-paced footsteps came rushing down the hall. Jessica popped into the room carrying Dickie – who was completely wrapped in toilet paper. The poor dog looked like a makeshift mummy with stray wrappings and all. Jessica was wearing a gleeful smile when she pranced inside and held him up.
Jude's sapphire eyes refilled with hopefulness as he turned to dash back to the table. Once the kid was out of hearing range, Dean exhaled and brought the phone back to his own ear.
“Hi,” Sam replied with a smile, “My partner and I are just trying to get some information about this school for our daughter. We're thinking about enrolling her in the fall and we just have a couple of questions about it.”
Uncle Cas suddenly stood up from his chair, which made Jessie and uncle Dean both pause to look at him.
Even Castiel could tell that Dean was lying. His voice was high and fake, holding too much worry. And it was clear that Jessica didn't believe him either. Her small hip jutted to the side and she crossed her arms, resembling Gabriel to the point that it made Castiel cringe.
,” he said a little louder, hoping his voice could pierce through the fog of Darkness and reach his boyfriend, “Y – you never gave up on me... Remember that? … You never stopped fighting for me, and I'll never stop fighting for you,” Clare promised, “C'mon, Superman... The world won't make it without you...
Castiel turned his head at the sound of Sam's breathless exclamation and realized that the entire garage was now lit only by the nearby candle and the grace of all the angels. Gabriel and Jessica were both alight with a golden glow, shining brightly next to Sam. Gabriel's large wings – all six of them – were on full display at his back, fanned out behind him like a forest canopy. And Jessica appeared to have a wingspan of her own. Her feathered appendages were significantly smaller than that of her celestial father – In fact, they were barely big enough to wrap around her tiny frame – but they strongly resembled them in terms of physical appearance. Jessica also had six wings, three on each side, and they shined with the same golden hue of Gabriel's grace. The little girl spun around and giggled as she caught glimpses of her own shimmering feathers.
The dog next to them raised his head and perked his ears up when his name was spoken, making Jessica giggle in amusement. She let go of her bunny and blankie and hopped down to turn and face Dickie, who tilted his head back at her.
And judging by the tremors that rocked Bobby's Singer's house every few seconds, it wouldn't take Darkness long at all to complete the job.
“That's, um, that's not important,” the trickster replied, “Just tell me how you do it. Tell me how you say no.”
“Son,” Papa whispered, gently holding Jude's head, “I'm... I'm very sorry for pressuring you to fly.”
Dean's rage dropped a few levels as he watched his angel stand up from the bed. Cas must have been able to see how frustrated Dean was this morning, because the guy smiled sweetly and gave his hand a tight squeeze before going to deal with the trickster in the kitchen. Dean watched Cas go, secretly admiring the graceful way he swept passed all the toys on the floor. Man, Cas was always so nice. Even when he didn't know what was bothering Dean, he still did everything he could to help.
Jude watched their interaction with a smile of his own, seeing Adam look down at their joined hands with studious eyes. The guy raised his head to look at Michael's face again afterward, this time with an expression of realization.
Bobby's study was dimly lit with morning sunlight as the man briefly raise a hand to wipe the sleep from his eyes. He was surprised to find that he had slept all night long and actually felt well-rested for once. But even more shocking than that was the fact that Cas was actually
"You think what I say doesn't matter just because I'm not part of this 'house'? Or because I'm just seventeen?" Clarence said, his voice low and serious, "You couldn't even imagine some of the things I've done, man. Yeah, I know a lot about sex. Because when you're a kid on the street in the dead of winter, you'll do anything to get a hot meal and a warm place to stay...
? And Bobby, Sam, and Gabriel had purchased all of them? That was the nicest gesture Castiel could imagine... Dean seemed to feel just as touched as Cas did. The two of them shared another look of understanding and the angel could see the underlying pride in the man's powerful stare. Their son wasn't even born yet and he was already receiving gifts from people that loved him...
, spare us the science lecture, Mike,” Papa interrupted in a loud groan, looking back to Adam, “Listen, all you gotta know is that when sex happens with grace, babies get made. Hell, when Sammy and I were making Jessica, we -”
An uncomfortable silence rested amongst everyone as Bobby's question was left hanging in the air. The elder hunter had a fair point. Unless they stopped whoever was in charge of sending the assassins to kill them, Castiel and Jude would always remain in danger. Castiel cringed at the thought of his small child being the victim of a premeditated attack. He would never allow his infant son to become a target of such reckless violence, especially at an extremely young age.
Dean took a second to gather his own thoughts. It was clear that Crowley was positive that he killed Clare's dad, but what if there was a chance the guy survived? What if he was still out there, and responsible for this new wave of kidnappings? Where had he been this whole time? Crowley wasn't the type of guy that would half-ass a murder, especially if he was murdering someone responsible for messing with his 'workforce.' Maybe this
“Hey, man, it's for his own good,” Dean shrugged, “The guy is crazy in love with that demon bastard and its killing him to say no. I'm sick of everybody in this family being disappointed and sad all the time. We deserve some freakin' happiness, Sammy. And if marrying Crowley makes Bobby happy, then by God, I'm gonna make sure it happens.”
Gabriel chuckled and rubbed his hands together as he gazed the huge stack of pancakes. Dean rolled his eyes. It seemed like every little thing the trickster did pissed Dean off to no end. Ugh, why did he have to be so animated and flamboyant? Better yet, how could Sam find any of that attractive?
Sammy tossed the newspaper on the table in front of Dean, laying the front page out in his view. Dean instantly saw the headline, '
Though she was soaking wet and shivering, as soon as Jessica laid her pretty eyes on her parents, she came running at them full force. Sam and Gabe both opened their arms to catch her and wrap her into a giant hug. Sam's eyes watered as he kissed his child's head and held her close to his own heart. He was so glad to hold her again and know that she was okay! Sam noticed that as they were holding her, Jessica was starting to sob. It wasn't a happy kind, but a very upset kind of cry.
“What does it matter to you, why I need things?” Crowley retorted, “Look, Singer, that hat is my price for keeping those plaid-wearing parasites safe from the scribe of God. Unless you want that angel to get to them first -”
As soon as he found himself in such a familiar and comforting environment, Jude stepped closer to his parents and Clare. Jude was proud of his boyfriend for being able to take everything in without question. Though he had never really met Jude's Grandpa, Clarence still respected him like a patriarch. Jude took his hand once they were close enough, silently stating his gratitude.
To Gabe and Sam's sheer horror, Jess popped from one side of the playground to the other; flying gracefully to the top of the jungle gym in the blink of an eye. High-pitched gasps filled the space as all the other children followed her with open mouths and pale faces. Gabriel's stomach dropped. Oh, shit. This wasn't good. All of these kids were going to tell their teachers and parents. The word was going to spread about the blonde girl on the playground who could fly.
Gabriel's heart sank at the sight of guilt on his daughter's precious face. Sam wore that same look for years before they met and it always made Gabe feel bad. None of this was Jessica's fault. If anything, it was Gabriel's fault for not explaining to her that being an angel on Earth wasn't normal.
The sound of Gabriel's determined voice was followed by multiple sets of footsteps. Clare blinked to focus his blurry sight, watching his entire new family flood Bobby's front yard. He was partly happy that they were able to show up and save his sorry ass, but he still didn't want them getting in the way. He was so freaking close to having Jude free just now! Clare didn't want anyone to ruin it!
The adorable sound was just enough to pull Gabriel from his dark stupor. He glanced toward the scythe in his hand before dropping it to the floor with a loud clang and holding both arms out for Charlie.
“Oh man, I wish Clare and Jude would have stuck around to see that,” Ollie leaned over to say to Jess.
Crowley chuckled a little bit, making the devilish sound echo hauntingly through the garage. Even though the bastard was laughing at him, Bobby stood his ground. Crowley may have been able to make the man blush, but Bobby sure as hell wasn't afraid of no demon.
Castiel raised his head at the sound of his own name to see Gabriel reaching his hand out. Cas blinked a few times before handing a balloon to his brother, who automatically attached it to the end of a tall bookshelf.
After making sure Papa's hair was nice and neat, Dad looked up and noticed Jude standing by the door. He smiled that warm grin when they met eyes, but then it sort of faded when he glanced down to see the costume in Jude's hand.
Dean was digging around in the trunk of the car now, searching for a pair of walkie-talkies that he knew he had thrown back there at some point. But there were so many guns, stakes, random-ass bottles of holy water and shit back there, he had a hard time finding them. Dean was already pissed enough without having to comb through their extensive collection of hunting supplies. Geez, he and Sam really needed to clean out this damn trunk. Where the hell were the walkie-talkies?
“It wouldn't,” Dean agreed, “What's done is done. Killing the person responsible for ruining your life won't change what's already happened.”
Dean smirked and nodded, so glad to see the happiness return to his angel's pretty face. The man helped his husband stand up again before walking back to the dresser with him. Cas gently laid Jude's bee among the other things on his dresser before taking in the sight of it all, sliding an arm around Dean's back in the process.
Meg was obviously referring to the conception of her own child. Once again, Castiel pictured the event in his mind from Meg's point of view; how she was bound to a mattress and taken advantage of repeatedly. How she was virtually unaware of the size of her stomach until she was left on the side of the road to sober up. Castiel could practically feel the panic she felt; thinking that her body was filled with wiggling worms. So afraid to look at what she pulled from her body. Utterly terrified that the sound of the high-pitched shriek would alert her captor of her whereabouts... Only to find out, years later, that she had given birth to a beautiful son. And feel even greater shame for ever leaving him...
On the couch, Jessica exhaled with relief, seeming overjoyed to hear the news. She instantly started to gather some of Charlie’s things, while Oliver picked up Charlie herself. Adam, with Katherine in his arms, got up to speak to Michael at the door, while Gabe flashed over to crush Sammy in a hug. Bobby silently and politely straightened up Jude’s kitchen while the family snapped into action. Jude, Clare, Jane, and Crowley came out of the bedroom with the newborn twins in hand to see what was going on. When Dean met eyes with his son, he gave the kid a hopeful look.
“Dude, don't get me started on Egyptian festivals, okay? You don't want to know about the freaky shit that goes down in those things,” the archangel said, sitting his beer off to the side, “Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that little Cassie is an angel just like me. Granted, not as powerful as me, but he's still pretty bad-ass on his own. Now, you and Sammy-boy might think you are curses that will bring a plague upon both our houses,” – The hair on the back of Dean's neck stood up at the Romeo and Juliet quote – “but you won't. Cas isn't gonna abandon you, just because you think you might get him killed. Hell, the kid's already died for you plenty of times. Pretty sure he wouldn't mind doing it again.”
Cas only narrowed his eyes and tilted his head a bit, wearing his classic 'I do not understand' face. Dean smiled, because he absolutely loved seeing that look on his angel's pretty face, and stepped around the bed to plant a kiss on the edge of Cas's cheekbone.
For the time being, Dean dismissed the weird question about the glowing man. Whoever – or whatever – it was didn't seem to be very important to Jude anymore. The only thing Jude cared about in that moment was waving at his favorite TV characters and seeing all the pretty floats. But Dean tucked the thought of the glowing man in the back of his mind, just in case he needed to deal with it again.
Ahh, finally. I think we can all breathe a little better now that the warlock is gone. Especially Clare. ;) I know that his sudden turn on Clare might have seemed a little abrupt, but Caldwell genuinely had no idea that Clare was going to marry Jude. And he was not on board with the homosexual lifestyle. (Sound like Eddie Thompson, much? Lol) ;) And I couldn't help but give that final kill to Jessica, because after everything he did, the warlock deserved to die by a woman's hand. Plus, Jessie really needed that kill. She blamed herself for what happened to Crowley, and now she feels like she righted a wrong. :) I promise that the warlock is offically dead. We won't have to see or hear from him ever again. :) And yay! Crowley is back! The old sass master is safe and sound. ;) I really hope you all enjoyed the chapter! Thank you so much for reading and commenting! The next chapter will be out soon! :)
Clarence's jaw nearly hit the wooden steps of the porch. Shit, Jude was right. The warlock had already died twice, and both times were because he was so focused on Clarence that he didn't even think about other people swooping in to harm him. Clare really was Caldwell's weakness... While everyone considered Jude's statement, Clare noticed that Jessica was staring hard at the crushed cars in the distance. She blinked at a particular stack of rusted metal and an eager, proud smile slowly bloomed on her face in the morning sun.
Aunt Rowena and uncle Crowley returned in less than twenty minutes with armfuls of books, equipment, and a few jars of ingredients. Staring at all the things on the table in the kitchen made Jessica wonder if all of this witchcraft stuff would really help. It had always helped before, but this time seemed different. This time, her parents and uncles weren't around to make sure everything went according to plan.
It was so light and open, filled with sand colored walls, light blue furniture, and a pure white bed. The bed itself was huge; big enough to hold at least four people comfortably. He and Clare would be able to wrestle on it without ever falling off. And it was situated facing a set of double doors that led out to a balcony.
Hearing Sam phrase it like that gave Dean chills. The word 'death' should never apply to Cas or his unborn son. Wanting to get away from the terrible feeling in his gut, Dean wandered over to the couch bed and gently sat down next to his angel. He leaned over to wrap his arms around Cas's stomach too, tucking both hands under Cas's soft back and carefully laying his head down on Cas's big stomach. Dean's ear was pressed against the tight warm skin – and he could almost hear a heartbeat. It might have been Cas's and it might have been his son's. But either way, Dean adored the sound. And he couldn't believe that anyone could be evil enough to want that precious sound to stop...
After his fervent request, Clarence quickly opened the motel door and led the way back outside. Jude could feel the hard breeze brush over his whole body as he followed his boyfriend toward the street. It was clear that Clarence was telling the truth. He seemed to know exactly where he was going; guiding Jude around with total awareness, even though Chicago was pitch black. Somewhere nearby, a car alarm was going off, echoing in the darkness and making Jude nervous. He would feel a lot better if he could see where it was coming from, but he couldn't see anything! It was so dark outside; like space without a sun. And it was getting cold. It felt like the temperature was dropping by the second.
After awhile, Jude started to forget why he was fighting in the first place. He was nearly convinced that Darkness was right. Giving up would be so easy. Fighting was so much harder. It took so much of his energy and willpower to keep fighting. Wouldn't it be easier to just let the Darkness take him? Besides, who would notice if he was gone? Who would care if he wasn't alive anymore? Things would probably be better if he wasn't around. He would never disappoint anyone else ever again. He couldn't hurt anyone either. Jude was sure that the world would be a better place without him... until he heard a familiar voice.
Bobby nudged his husband's shoulder, silently reminding him that they were in the presence of a child they had just taken in and that he needed to make a good first impression. As usual, the gesture made Crowley change his tune.
For a second, everybody just stood there and gazed cautiously at the unmoving figure. Nobody said a word for a long time and it was really starting to get on Gabe's nerves. What was with all this ridiculous tension? They were here to talk, not have a staring contest.
The angel blinked strangely when Dean reached up to rake his fingers gently through Cas's dark hair. He seemed to be a little lost by Dean's purring words and affectionate gestures, but nodded anyway. Before Cas had time to speak, though, Dean was already plunging their mouths together, kissing him with as much sentiment and emotion as he could. Their tongues were circling and Dean's hand was firmly clutching the back of the angel's soft head. It was the kind of kissing they did in private, raw and unfiltered. Cas was kissing back just as hard as Dean, reaching up to clutch at the man's shirt. For a brief moment, they were lost in it, completely unaware of Gabriel standing next to them and all the staring people moving around the room. Holy shit, Dean loved kissing Cas like this. Making Gabriel watch it was just the cherry on top.
“Well, thanks for the lesson in demonology,” Gabriel cooed, voice full of sarcasm, “But is there a point you're gonna be getting to soon? Or do you just love hearing the sound of your own voice?”
“Wait. I’ve gotta tell you something before we go in,” Dean almost whispered, raising his sight to the angel before him. “Cas… I, um… I… Well, I – ”
His mom eventually walked away from the door, her footsteps fading in the direction of the kitchen. In the meantime, Oliver finally finished getting his pants on and reached over to grab his socks and shoes from the end of his bed. He sat down to slip them all on, feeling a rush of nervousness take root in his stomach. Oh, man, there were going to be so many people at the playground; so much of his family all in one spot. Would they all be able to sit so close to each other for the whole duration of the wedding without tearing each others' throats out? The last thing Oliver wanted was for his crazy family to make the Winchesters uncomfortable. After all, the Winchesters were his
Castiel saw Gabriel's throat quiver with a gulp. It seemed that their Father's answer had silenced whatever retort he planned to deliver. Still, the archangel wasn't ready to bridge the gap to total forgiveness yet.
They both knew that Jessica's dreams sometimes came true; that she had premonitions about the future in her sleep. So the fact that she was laughing made them hopeful. At least
. The creature no longer looked like a girl in a bikini. It was suddenly a carbon copy of Oliver's father. The familiar figure looked up at Oliver with a huge smile.
After a few moments of total silence, Jessica shared a look of confusion with Jude. Why was it so quiet all of the sudden? Where did everyone go? The two young adults slowly turned around to face the store, and met the stares of all the adults. Jess's parents, Jude's parents, Rowena, and Ms. Jane were all blinking at Jude and Jess with tears in their eyes, not saying a word. Jess assumed that it was because she and Jude were standing side-by-side in their wedding attire for the first time ever, and that the sight of it was probably overwhelming for them. But wasn't there something that anyone could say? Poor Jude's face was turning into a bright red balloon...
Cas exhaled a little and looked away before clearing his throat. His eyes eventually wandered back to glance up and down Dean's body when he started to actually speak.
“H – helped?” Meg repeated with a horrified stare, her eyes leaking tears without her realizing it, “No... I was forced.”
A quiet creak on the floor boards caught Jude and Clare's attention. They both turned to see that Meg, the demon who was completely unconscious just moments before, was now sitting up on the mattress. She was heavily medicated, barely keeping her head up and blood-shot eyes open, but she was slowly blinking at the two men in the room with her. Seeing the woman's hollow face again – along with remembering the last time he had seen her in person, and all those horrible things she said – made Clarence nearly bite his own bottom lip off to keep the tears inside. He instantly threw himself at Jude, twisting both arms around the angel.
Castiel took a breath of relief as he reached out for Bobby's shoulder. The angel quickly flew the man to the dining area of the White Swan Hotel, where food was still flying through the air. It appeared that everyone in the room was in the fight now, adults and children alike. The floor and walls were doused in all manor of substances, as were all of the people. Castiel spotted Dean hiding behind a chair, tossing grapes toward Sam and Gabriel, who were barricaded behind a table.
Dean turned to give Crowley a warning glare. Seriously? Crowley wanted Cas to repeat out loud the very thing that was making him tremble like a scared child? What an asshole! Dean opened his mouth to refuse on his husband's behalf – but his words were lost when he felt Cas jut up from the chair. The angel rose to face Crowley with balled hands and a lethal look.
Crowley tilted his head to look down and straighten out the hem of his suit jacket, but Dean could tell that he was finding a distraction so that he wouldn't have to look Dean in the eye when he spoke.
Jessie and Ollie hid their smiles with their hands and turned away, probably fighting off the urge to laugh. Luckily, Papa seemed to understand that Jude was uncomfortable with receiving kisses in public, because he nodded respectfully and backed up. Dad came around the car just in time to put his arm around Papa and lead him toward the tables, all while planting a kiss to
To make himself feel better, Dean rolled up his sleeve and fiddled with the coat strap on his forearm. Looking at the familiar shade of tan brought back so many good memories of being alone with Cas; sharing time with him, talking to him, smiling, laughing, kissing, holding him… Dean eventually laid his head down on it and silently prayed that his family would be alright.
The sound of Cas’s voice calmed Dean’s soul in an instant. The man steadied his vision to see his soulmate’s dark blue eyes blinking at him and was overwhelmed with relief.
gets to have endless phenomenal sex with his husband. Meanwhile, Gabe couldn't even get Sam to say something in a Canadian accent. Unbelievable. Where was the justice in this?
Castiel gulped, feeling his own smile vanish. Jude? Oh, that's right. Cas had been worrying about Jude just a few minutes prior. How could he have forgotten so quickly? The orgasm Dean gave him must have been pretty powerful...
Though he wasn't quite in the mood for entertaining guests, Jude obeyed his parents' wishes to stand in the control room and greet Jane's family when they arrived. Gabe, Sam, Jessie, Dad, and Papa were all talking as they waited for Jane to show up, chatting about last night's parties and rearranging the bunker to accommodate 'civilians'. Jude yawned as he walked up to stand with the group.
Sam smiled at his daughter with beaming pride. She was smart and sassy even when she was tired, and could fix a problem without ever saying a word. Man, she really was Gabriel's daughter...
Then, the demonic aura flickered out of Meg’s body. Her hand slipped away from Cas’s face, painting five red streaks of blood across his cheek, chin, and bottom lip from each of her fingers. And she was soundless and still in the angel’s arms. Dean could feel hot tears racing down his own face as he looked from Meg back up to Cas. The angel only sat there with a blank look on his face for a few seconds, seeming unable to process that his most cherished ally and friend had just died in his arms. The blood on his face and clothes made Dean ache on the inside.
As if Dad's voice put a spell on her, Jessie's eyes closed and her whole body relaxed. Her baby blanket felt so soft in her hands and Papa's sweet smell made her so calm. It didn't take long for Jessie to fall asleep next toDickie on her parents' bed...
how much they love you... Take me and your Papa for example," Dean said, briefly gesturing toward the empty kitchen doorway, "When we first met, I really liked him a lot. It didn't take me long to fall in love with him. But I didn't say anything about it because I didn't think he felt the same way... Until he turned against his own family to save me and Sam. And I realized that he
“They were on sale! I couldn't pass that up!” Gabe defended, narrowing his eyes at Sam, “You're still mad about the Prime Minister thing, aren't you? I'm sorry, okay? I won't invite him. Your massive dick is the only one I want to put in my -”
“Listen, little man,” Dean began, setting the bag in his hand down on the floor so that he could take hold of Jude's tiny sides, “You, Papa, uncle Gabe, and Jessie are all angels. Do you know what an angel is?”
When Dean heard the news, he quickly wiped the tears from his eyes, gave Jessica a tiny peck on the cheek and stood up to walk out of the room. Sam moved out of the way to let him by and waited for his little girl. Jessie wasn't crying, but Sam could tell that she was still very upset. And it broke his heart. He quickly wrapped an arm around his daughter's shoulder to pull her close.
Dean smirked and glanced up to meet eyes with Cas, who was watching their embrace with a smile of admiration. By sight alone, Dean knew that Cas was just as happy as he was. And they were both equally prepared to teach their child how to fly.
They were back in the storage room among Cas’s precious things again. Dean recognized the vending machine and paintings instantly. Cas didn’t say a word as he reached down to snap the final bind from Dean’s ankles, freeing him completely. Dean remained sitting on the floor as Cas trudged to the door and stopped to raise his hand toward it. In a hoarse voice, Cas chanted some kind of spell in Enochian, which made fragments of symbols appear on the door. Though he couldn’t confirm it, Dean assumed that the king was putting up a ward to keep all the demons out.
“Fearlessly?” Clare scoffed, shaking his blonde head, “Jay, I was scared to death. It beat me up and threw my past in my face, trying to break me down... but every time I looked up, I saw
“The scary people,” she cried, reaching up to cling to Sam's neck and shoulders, “It's the people with the mean faces, Daddy! No! Don't let them take me away!”
Yeah. Lots of things happened in this chapter. I really hope that I was able to balance out the constant shift of funny and serious throughout. There was a lot of emotional ground to cover, starting with Jess's baby talk. I think I read somewhere that when it comes to telling children about sex, it's best to just explain the truth very carefully, and I tried to let Gabriel do that for his little girl. :) Yes, Jude favors Superman over Batman. Believe it or not, that will actually be a reoccurring theme in this story. And if you made it all the way to the end of this chapter without wanting to punch me for the hellacious gas station scene, (pun intended,) then you are officially one of my favorite people and I want to hug you. *hugs* :) Onward to chapter four!
“Shh, it's okay, little man,” Dad soothed, hugging Jude close, “He's not going away forever. He's just gonna live with uncle Bobby. You can still see him anytime you want.”
"No. Sorry," he muttered, shaking his head, "I never heard my dads talk about anyone named Meg before."
“No,” she muttered breathlessly, slowly shaking her head, “No, I... I got rid of you... You can't be here... This isn't real...”
Jude spun around at the sound of his daddy's voice. Daddy and Papa were suddenly sitting in the pillow fort, waiting by the tunnel that led outside. Jude gasped when he saw both his parents again.
“We caught him. He's downstairs, in the trap,” Dad admitted, his hollow voice giving Jude chills, “and just from looking at him, I'm eighty percent convinced that he
“Alright, that's enough,” Bobby hobbled in to say, tipping his hat up so that he could fully observe everyone in his home, “Look, I dunno about y'all, but I've been doin' some thinkin', and I'm pretty sure we won't be able to finish the job ourselves. It's time to call in the big guns.”
