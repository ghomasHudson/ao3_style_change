.” Sherlock flinched, the prodding that didn’t stop soon giving him the start of a headache on top of John’s harsh words. “Yeah, a pretty shit way of warning a bloke that they’re going to ask him to sign his own husband’s death warrant.”
“I’ve always paid my own bills. Caring for family isn’t supposed to earn me a bloody paycheck.” He spat, because this was the place he could. A place where he didn’t have to reign in the anger and practice such constant patience that was required in his position. A place where his raised voice wouldn’t scare Rosie or earn him the timid looks from his husband for the days that followed. “It’s not who I was raised to be.”
“What are you staring at me for?” Sherlock demanded quietly, standing in the hallway having just changed into pajamas and gotten Rosie to sleep. “It isn’t my fault I’m rewearing my dressing gown again. Mrs Hudson didn’t bring up the washing and I don’t hear you volunteering to go fetch it at this hour.”
He thought, but contained himself as best he could. John would not yell at him when he was in pain, which was terribly cumbersome given that he only ever wanted to yell at Sherlock, anymore, when he was causing himself pain. Or, in that particularly vile instance, allowing John to do so.
“What about your army pension? You receive that check each month because your military career ended earlier than expected with a gunshot wound to the shoulder and psychosomatic limp. Do you have a problem with that money?”
John sighed. Sherlock was certainly struggling if his composure was slipping so easily. “They’re probably down with Mrs Hudson, begging for the milk from Rosie’s cereal bowl.”
Plus, John wasn’t sure they could traumatize her anymore by medical appointments after two recent rounds of ambulances, paramedics, and almost week-long stays in hospital.
“Watson-“ A disembodied voice called out as he neared the front door, and he turned towards the sound only to frown.
“I don’t know what to do with him anymore.” He admitted. “I want to try the new medications but I can’t do that if he refuses to be honest about how much pain he’s in. Even after he lost consciousness he vomited, twice. Once on the bed at home and once in the ambulance. It killed me to do it but I asked Mrs Hudson to at least strip the bed but likely she’ll do the washing too.” All while dealing with Rosie’s inevitable tantrum. “The idiot is lucky he didn’t aspirate again.”
‘Still yours’ echoed through John’s mind and he smiled widely. Yes, he certainly was. Sherlock was irrevocably his. After everything that had been twisted free and taken away from them, that remained a constant unmovable force. As long as theirs hearts were beating, Sherlock would belong to John and John would do all in his power to deserve that degree of dedication.
The look on John’s face was startled, and he shook it off as quickly as it appeared. “You git! You utterly clueless git- I’m not talking about the jumping off the bloody rooftop.”
The relaxed breathing hitched for a moment and John worried he’d pushed him too far. Reading Sherlock wasn’t easy, given that John wasn’t Sherlock, and gauging how much a chronic pain patient was suffering was equally difficult. After the day before, John deserved Sherlock’s complete rejection and a demand for a full body massage until the sky fell. But then the tall man was unfolding and slipping down onto the floor in front of John’s legs and sitting back waiting, the hunger in his eyes a match only to John’s own.
Ah, yes. That was the kid’s name. He was only- quite coincidentally, if someone bothered to ask John- a year or so younger than Rosie, and named after Sherlock in all but the replacement of Holmes for Moore. It was one of those things they didn’t talk about, like the circumstances behind Sherlock’s marred back, what John was doing when he got shot and Emily’s death. But, if he was talking, then he was willing, right? Why else would Sherlock offer up such a juicy tidbit if not to-
“Is there any way you could stay for a while?” John asked, almost ashamed to do so as he knew that Mycroft had already carved out an hour from his busy day of being The British Government to follow up on Sherlock’s appointment. “Maybe it won’t be necessary, but, after today he’s probably- and I just- bugger!” John rubbed his tired eyes with his palms. In the past he called Lestrade to help get Sherlock into his wheelchair or the tub in a pinch, but that wasn’t how he preferred to operate given Sherlock’s ongoing distaste for the DI. If John wanted to preserve some of both their dignity, he knew he had to do it himself. Only, on the most difficult days, that was not possible.
“I am aware of that, Doctor Watson,” Sherlock’s brother said stiffly, barely concealing his own hoarseness. “but there are still accommodations that can be made to the flat to ensure he is not in any more pain than necessary. Or, to ensure you are free to be with your family instead of spending time with laundry or dusting or
“He won’t be there.” John said, hiding his sigh as a groan from his old bones protesting rising out of the chair. “We should get going in case we can’t get a cab right away.”
'' Mycroft scoffed and John looked down at his husband’s IV clad hand with shame. “This isn’t your fault, Doctor Watson. He lies and manipulates people into believing he is confident and sure when he is, in fact, at his most insecure. Sherlock would have hidden the fact that he had been hit by a bloody train if it meant he could prove to you that he was capable of engaging in intimacy.” To his credit, Mycroft did not appear anywhere near disgusted as John felt.
Oddly enough, that was the thought that made John smile with honesty behind it. With conviction. If he was giving Sherlock any pure joy, it was in the form of Rosie. To John, it seemed she was doing a bit better- though many conversations still needed to be had and appointments needed to be made- but to Sherlock she was perfect. As far as John could tell, in his husband’s sometimes child like eyes, she always was.
Freezing over his lover’s body, doing his best to move as little as possible, he forced himself out of the headspace of sexual being and into that of a doctor. He knew that it was unlikely that Sherlock would offer this information up on his own, but John had to know. There was no way to deny it any longer.
He took a deep breath and reached for his belt, undoing it slowly. “You’re mine, and I say that you’re going to suck me. Do you understand?”
As that breath passed and John relaxed ever so slightly- flailing his arms for emphasis instead of directing them at Sherlock’s cheek, jaw, or nose in the form of fists- and Sherlock felt ashamed for entertaining the thought. That wasn’t who John was anymore. He went to therapy every week to learn to keep the anger at bay, and Sherlock was nearly as proud of that work as he was of his own.
Nodding thoughtfully, instead of jumping high enough to touch the ceiling and cheering with victory, John took a few sips of his tea while he let a new idea turn over in his head. “It must be the morphine. The oxycodone hasn’t had enough time to make any difference. Do you think we might need to call Doctor Fletcher and see if she would be willing to increase the dosage of your morphine tablets instead? They’re not as strong but perhaps they could be a better daily option than something that you’re afraid to take because it might knock you on your arse. The beast you know and all that.”
Sherlock lived through a series of tonic-clonic seizures without waking, a hospital-acquired infection with a high grade fever (requiring three rounds of antibiotics that decimated his immune system) and more morphine than John cared to contemplate. He lived through putting permanent pins in his broken wrist, then reopening the incision to sample and flush out the infection to the best of their abilities. It took nearly four weeks from the time he was hospitalized hours after being hit by a cab- just one time too many- to finally get to go home.
John jumped a little when the first points that were designed for shock did just that, and the following vibrations tickled enough for him to hold back a laugh that made an odd noise in his throat. “Christ, these things are weird- and look at these legs. It’s like I have kickstands.”
Sherlock raised his brows and not his lip playfully. “Oh, that? They’re the temporarily attached metal taps on the stabilizers to assist in associating the electrode pattern with the braces making ground contact. In conjunction with any reverberation that manages to travel upwards past your point of injury, it should gradually lessen your anxiety and uncertainty regarding each step.” His otherwise casual tone quickly became serious and a bit grave. “John, I implore you, do be confident in your steps. Without proper momentum the cane won’t be enough to stabilize you and the joints will have no movement. Understood?”
His heart felt like it had been broken in two, and still John knew he could hardly imagine what Sherlock was experiencing. Given that he had lost consciousness only moments after being shot, John had only ever experienced an eight. “Love, that’s not going to be enough. This is serious. You have to go, love.”
John checked his watch to verify when it was time to abandon the only cuppa he would drink hot that day and made his way back to the kitchen. It wasn’t about him anymore.
John couldn’t argue that, but the differences were too subtle to complain too much about, and could so easily be explained away as other things. Separation anxiety. Exhaustion. Depression. The increased demand of parenting a gifted special needs child. None of it necessarily meant Sherlock wasn’t Sherlock anymore. Only that he had... evolved. Grown up, a bit. Channeled his brilliance and yes, by God, he was still absolutely brilliant.
As the waiter set their drinks on the table, Sherlock came back and sat down again. He arranged himself artfully in his chair, leaning back and crossing his legs. He draped one arm over his knee and rested the other on the table. The buttons on his expensive-looking black shirt were barely holding.
John whimpered when he felt Sherlock lean forward. Sherlock's mouth was hot and wet on John's hip. John shuddered with anticipation. Finally,
John leaned closer to Sherlock. "Good." He put one of his hands up to take hold of Sherlock's black silk lapel. He heard Sherlock's breath hitch. "Thank you for giving me a second chance," he said quietly.
"Sherlock, that was incredible." John turned to Molly. "You played beautifully, too. I'm John," he said, holding out his hand.
John didn't move yet. He waited until Sherlock looked at him questioningly. He put his left hand up to his face and scratched a nonexistent itch on his forehead. As he pulled his hand away, he paused to tap his third finger with his thumb. Three times. Sherlock's face broke into a brilliant smile.
John tucked himself back into his underwear but left his jeans unbuttoned. He took both of Sherlock's hands in his. "Come here, gorgeous." He pulled Sherlock up onto his feet and wrapped one arm tightly around his waist to steady him. "I want you on the bed. I want you comfortable." He kissed Sherlock firmly on the mouth and guided him into their bedroom.
John walked quickly toward him, heart pounding in his chest. "What are you doing here? Is something wrong?"
Sherlock looked down. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw John start to reach out to him, then pull his hand back. The ache in Sherlock's heart surged.
After he'd cleaned his shoe, John dropped onto his couch and draped his arm over his eyes. He was exhausted. He drifted into an uneasy sleep.
John put a confused expression on. "No, sir. Don't exactly get much traffic here. Are you looking for someone?" John gasped. "Are you looking for that prince they were talking about in the village?"
"I know. I'm sorry, I know I said I was just going to call, but I couldn't return this to you over the phone." He held out Sherlock's watch.
. He opened his eyes. "It happened while I was in country. With my commanding officer, Major Sholto. There was something between us from the moment we met, but neither of us had ever acknowledged it. One night I went to Sholto's tent to deliver a message. Before I knew what was happening, we were on his bunk. With our tongues in each other's mouths. And... our hands in each other's pants." John looked up at the ceiling. "That's when the mortar fire began. We jumped up and straightened our clothes. The field hospital was hit hard. I was trying to save a dying colleague when I was hit." Sherlock squeezed John tighter. "I woke up in a different hospital. I never saw Major Sholto again."
." He circled his tongue over Sherlock's nipple and was rewarded with a gasp and a shudder. "I think about you all the time. I
John closed his eyes and whined. Sherlock nipped at John's neck. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, pulling their bodies together roughly, desperate for friction. Then he growled in frustration. Sherlock had abandoned his habit of bending his knees when pressing against John to compensate for their height difference. The result was Sherlock's cock pushing insistently against John's belly, and John getting no friction at all. John tried for a moment to pull Sherlock lower, but Sherlock wasn't cooperating.
John cried out. "Oh! Sherlock!" Sherlock squirmed under John's body. John moaned in response, shoving his hands into Sherlock's hair and kissing him heatedly.
John came out of the barn leading a chestnut gelding with a white blaze. Sherlock's heart stopped. He tried to breathe normally while John hitched the horse to a small wagon. John got into the seat and drove toward Sherlock. He stopped next to Sherlock and leaped down. He was smiling until he caught sight of Sherlock's face.
John smiled back. "I don't know where we're going. But I think we'll know when we get there." He leaned over and kissed Sherlock. "And I think you'd better start teaching me to speak French."
John fidgeted nervously. "I... I can't stop thinking about you. Monday was... well, I haven't connected with anyone like that since... well, ever."
John's hands slid out of Sherlock's hair and gently moved down his neck, across his shoulders, and onto his upper arms. Sherlock shuddered at the contact. "Sherlock?" John's eyes were searching his. "Is this what you want? Just say the word and I'll stop. It's all right."
The other cocktail waitress screamed. The bartender leaped out from behind the bar and was next to the injured waitress almost as quickly as John was. Blood was pooling at the back of the young woman's head, and she was unconscious. John grabbed the bartender's arm. "I'm a doctor. Get me a clean towel!" he ordered. The bartender stared at him. "Now!" John shouted. The man ran back to the bar. The other waitress was standing over them now, her hands over her mouth. John pointed at her. "You! Go call an ambulance!" She ran to the back of the bar.
John took a deep, shuddering breath. He couldn’t help sinking his hands into the silky black hair again. The feel of the demon’s tongue against his skin was dizzying. It took everything he had not to get distracted. “Well, if you’re going to give me pleasure I’ve never known, don’t you think I should be screaming your name? Bit awkward to be screaming, ‘Oh, you, you, you!’ don’t you think?”
John moved to Sherlock's side and led him back to the bed. Sherlock removed his cloak and sat down. John bent down and pulled Sherlock's boot off. He stood back up.
John grinned. He gestured at his own body, sweating and dressed for jogging. "What does it look like?"
John nodded. "Yes, I think so." He stroked Sherlock's hair. "Oh, Sherlock, I've never been so terrified. Not even in battle. I thought I might lose you." He buried his face in Sherlock's cloak.
His shoulders flexed with a little shrug, lifting and dropping his wings. “The usual. Superior strength and dexterity, long life, imperviousness to human disease.” He deliberately dropped his chin to look through his lashes at John. “The ability to hold my breath for extended periods of time.”
else. He rinsed his hair. As John washed the rest of his body, he saw Sherlock's smile. His dark, curly hair. His gorgeous eyes. The way his shirt strained over his chest, the buttons barely holding. A surge of heat rushed through John's entire body. He turned the water to cold.
He looked into John's eyes. The light from the window was catching in Sherlock's eyes, making them glow a vibrant mossy green. John looked down, chastising himself again.
Sherlock reluctantly took John's hand and allowed him to pull him upright. He stood with his weight fully on his right leg. He stifled a cry of pain.
"Well, if I can cope with your bisexuality - and with you bringing your flock of inane females into our home, and listening to them screech, as you do whatever it is you do to them - then I think you can cope with me being gay and not bringing anyone home at all." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "As for interest? I
“Right, thank God for that!” shouted Sherlock. “Congratulations, you two. Took you longer than John and I! And, talking about John and I, well we are going to bed! We have some celebrating to do - in person.”
“Shh, John, relax, you are not well and you need to get better, just sleep.” Sherlock spoke calmly and clearly even though John’s words had made him shiver slightly. What was he dreaming about? Who was he imagining? Was it that red-headed cat loving vegan? The short, dainty nurse who had draped herself over him every time they were together?
Sherlock hugged him close. “John, I missed you last night, I really couldn’t believe the summons by mother and father, but they wanted to get all their legal stuff done before Christmas, and the Solicitor just happened to be ‘dropping by’.”
He moved his head toward John’s groin, taking a deep breath before licking over the head of his cock, his warm tongue leaving a path of saliva glistening over the glans. He felt John’s hands tighten in his hair - there came a sharp, quick breath as they began on the path towards no return.
"I think I would wait for hell to freeze over before he made a move on me. And, well… I suppose I just haven't been brave enough."
Once again Angelo moved forward to take them both into a crushing hug but John, ready this time, managed to side step so Sherlock got the all-encompassing hug, whilst Angelo managed only to grab Johns elbow patting and thanking them for the custom.
Sherlock knew that John might not remember the day he ‘spent in bed ‘ with Sherlock,  would undoubtedly forget the words he had spoken once he had recovered, but he knew deep in his heart that the words spoken by John were true.  The delirium had removed all trace of awkward embarrassment. Yes, they would be revisiting this topic very soon, as soon as John was well, and in full control of his faculties. He pressed more water to John’s lips before kissing his forehead and taking up sentry in his armchair, ready to tend to John’s every need.
A screeching whistle broke the air before John finished the sentence. The rapidly deflating balloon that his dad had released in surprise now fluttering to the breakfast table, wrinkled and worn out.
“It’s after twelve, Sherlock, it’s the solstice today!” John was giddy, now able to speak but not realizing that he sounded like a child who had indulged in too many blue coloured candies.
, and the cherry on the cake when John got into Bart’s medical school, was a day of his mum and dad phoning everyone they had ever known, bragging about their perfect son becoming a doctor. There just never seemed the right moment to burst their bubble.
“Whoa Sherlock” John Laughed as he stumbled back. Sherlock’s hand had shot out to steady him before he fell back out of the door. John righted himself, catching his breath then rooted to the spot, just stared at Sherlock. The silence was deafening. Neither seemed to know what to say or how to move. John could feel the heat from Sherlock’s hand on his arm, like a scorching sun, amplified through a magnifying glass. But instead of pain it brought pleasure. John instinctively leant into the touch, and Sherlock’s other hand moved slowly to rest against his other arm, his eyes piercing John’s as though he could read his thoughts if he tried hard enough.
John had come home the day before, staying in a flat with three of his mates for the duration of the year  suited, but he did miss his parents, and they had practically begged him to come home for a ‘get together’ for his 21
"No, John… you look…" Sherlock let out a loud exhalation of breath. "I just - … I have always wondered what Captain John Watson looked like. You look... good." He turned his head slightly. His ears went pink as he realised the compliment might have been a little too friendly.
John felt suddenly a little self-conscious. He had showered with extra care, shaved with more precision than usual before dressing in a pair of his favourite jeans and V neck jumper. He felt like he was going to an interview, a meeting where he might be studied furiously, where each micro emotion might be observed. He felt silly, this was Sherlock. He would take it in his stride.
"Sherlock?" John said. "You look... different." How could this man who wore a suit everyday look so different with a new hairstyle and a retro suit?
“A-hem…. Can I have your attention everyone…. Can we please just all take a glass of champagne from the tray…. I, think….” He stopped momentarily, looking at Sherlock, who nodded almost imperceptibly… “Well, I think Dr Watson and my brother have an announcement to make.”
“Sherlock, this might be a moot point now, but I needed to tell you how much I loved you, and how much I wanted to kiss you”
As John reached the built up city once again, he felt at peace, at one with the world and as he walked through the beauty of historic London, he recognised the need that to step into the unknown. He knew that he had to tell Sherlock about his feelings. He was convinced in his heart, that the foundation of their friendship would not come crashing down. They had been through too much! But, well he just felt like a tit. He didn’t want Sherlock to grin or laugh, or even worse, to look pitifully at him as he made his declaration. He just wanted quiet acceptance, for Sherlock to understand why he sometimes acted like a school girl on prom night. Sherlock could be told, then they could go on, just the same, without an elephant in the room. As he thought about Sherlock, he felt a calm envelope him. He felt warm and grounded, He felt brave.
John’s heart flipped. He knew at once what Sherlock was trying to tell him. Sherlock’s eyes softened as the atmosphere started to crackle.
“Well, you are hot John, very hot.” Sherlock wondered if he imagined that John’s fevered, flushed face had blushed, a pink tinge reaching the tips of his perfect ears.
"You can stop here. We're almost on top of it." John took another step forward and crouched down. He pushed the leaves aside to expose a wooden hatch. He pulled it open to reveal a stairway. "You don't have to go in. I just wanted you to know how to find it quickly."
John knocked repeatedly on Sherlock's door, to no avail. He let his forehead fall against the door with a thump. "Sherlock!" he shouted. "I know you're in there. I saw your car in the basement. Open the door!"
"Good. So have I." Sherlock kept his left arm around John's chest as he pulled the right one back. He raked his fingers upward through John's hair. John let his head fall forward, sighing. He shuddered as Sherlock's mouth slid wetly over the back of his neck.
When John finished taking care of Sherlock's head, he pulled up a chair and sat down next to the bed, taking Sherlock's hand in both of his. After several minutes had passed quietly, Sherlock looked down at John and giggled.
Watson, 75, is a prominent physician. He began his medical career with the U.S. Army, serving in Vietnam until 1973, when he was wounded in action. Watson was awarded the Purple Heart, among a number of other awards and decorations. In 1978, he founded the Watson Clinic, one of the first medical practices in the area to cater specifically to the gay community. The clinic is now run by Watson's niece, Dr. Andrea Watson-Turner.
Sherlock continued, "You're close already, John, I can tell. The way you're thrashing against me. I can feel you trembling. You're incredible." He moved his hips again, shoving his cock against John's arse. "You feel how hard you make me, John?"
People didn't like Sherlock. Without exception. And John was the most incredible man Sherlock had ever met. He deserved someone like himself. Not someone like Sherlock. John would eventually see this truth. And he would send Sherlock away. Sherlock didn't know if he would survive.
Sherlock leapt down from the second level of the storage shelves. As he straightened up, he smiled. "After all this time, you still think you can sneak up on me."
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably but didn’t look away. His voice was flat. “Whatever you think you feel, it isn’t real. Your orgasm releases chemicals in your brain to discourage you from immediately abandoning a mate you may have impregnated. It means nothing.”
John stepped back, taking Sherlock's hand. He picked Sherlock's dressing gown up with his other hand and led Sherlock to the bathroom.
John carefully put the condom he had taken from the drawer on Sherlock and then shifted lower on the bed. Sherlock's hands clutched at the dressing gown as he watched John. Sherlock was still trembling.
Sherlock flexed his hand on John's cock, his thumb pressing against it and his fingertips stroking down the shaft. John's hips bucked upward, nearly throwing Sherlock to the floor. "Oh! Oh my God, I'm sorry! Are you okay?"
Sherlock walked with John across the street to the cafe. John couldn't help noticing that Sherlock looked both ways before stepping into the street this time.
“Let’s get this bit over with while we’re at it.” He tilted his head down and pushed his thick, wavy hair aside to reveal the horns at the top of his head. “I’ll thank you to keep the ‘horny’ jokes to yourself. I find them tiresome, and I can assure you I’ve already heard them all.” His horns were curled and delicate, ebony with intricate scarlet patterns.
. He must have been injured in the fall because he had then dragged himself into the trees. He'd done an exceptional job of covering the evidence. He could have stayed hidden from almost anyone. Anyone except John Watson.
When Sherlock saw John, he froze for half a second before wrenching himself free in a sudden burst of strength. "
John yanked the sheet higher, pulling it to his chest as his heart clenched. “Then you’re some kind of... rape demon?”
John dimly registered the sound of Mrs. Henderson's chart clattering to the floor as he sprinted down the hall. He rounded the corner and made eye contact with Sherlock. He was at the other end of the ER, thrashing against the grip two large police officers had on him.
Sherlock nodded, smiling shyly. They walked together for a long while, eventually circling back near Angelo's. As the hour grew later, John suggested stopping for dinner at a small Chinese restaurant just around the corner.
“It would behove you not to try my patience further. While my stated intention is to take that big, fat cock of yours down my throat and give you the greatest pleasure you have ever known, do not for
John took him into his mouth. Sherlock was overwhelmed. He writhed against the pillar, crying out wordlessly. After only a few minutes, Sherlock was on the verge of coming. He whimpered helplessly, trying to warn John. "J-John... oh, God... close, John!" He barely got the words out before he was coming hard in John's mouth. John swallowed around him, not letting go until Sherlock sagged against the pillar, panting.
The room spun. Sherlock opened his eyes. Somehow his back was now against the door. Next to his head, his left wrist was pinned to the door by John's right hand. Stunned, he stared at their hands for a moment. Then he looked at John's face. John was smiling at him wolfishly. "You see? I'll take care of you."
John took a deep breath as he burst out of the stairwell and onto the roof of his building. He was still trembling. The night air was cool against his sweat-drenched body.
John looked down, watching his own fingers tangling in Sherlock's hair. Both of them were quiet for a long time. Sherlock was getting heavier and heavier against John's chest as he relaxed.
, damn it!" The Vega strained, but the engine wouldn't catch. John let go and slumped back against the seat with an aggravated groan. He yanked the key out of the ignition and hit the dashboard again. "
"I just don't know what the point is. He's been gone a week already. He'll have crossed by now. Or he went north instead."
," he moaned. He wrapped his arms weakly around Sherlock and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder.
John's heart was pounding. He let out a breath he hadn't known he was holding. He leaned forward onto the back of the seat in front of him.
John felt an answering warmth sparking in his own body. He yielded, lowering himself carefully into the car.
Sherlock laughed. He stood up slowly and leaned in close to John's ear. He lowered his voice. "You're not getting away that easily, John. I'm nowhere near done with you. I promised you I was going to
John didn't respond. He picked the bread up and took it to the dining room. The doorbell rang. He stood listening to his mother chatting excitedly with her friend for a minute. He sighed.
John should also be referring to trousers as "pants," but I thought "trousers" would be less confusing.
After a few more minutes, John took a deep breath and stepped back. "Let's get you back to the house." He shouldered Sherlock's pack and helped him up the stairs.  Sherlock watched John close and hide the hatch. They walked slowly back to the house. John brought Sherlock to the bed and set down the pack. Sherlock took his cloak off and sat down. John bent down and removed Sherlock's boot. He stood and hung up his own cloak. He removed his own boots and went to Sherlock. Sherlock laid down and John crawled into the bed next to him. They put their arms around each other. John closed his eyes.  He spoke quietly. "Sherlock."
They walked across the club, side by side. Their quarry was seated at the bar, an empty seat on either side. They couldn’t have asked for a more perfect moment to strike.
Mike turned to Sherlock and pulled him into what looked like a bone-crushing hug. John's heart leapt. He smiled through his tears at the shocked look on Sherlock's face.
Sherlock finally took half a step back. He looked dazed, his hair riotous. John chuckled breathlessly. "We should probably call a truce before one of us actually kills the other."
Keeping John's wrists pinned over his head, Sherlock reclaimed John's mouth and continued thrusting his hips against John's.
John was still sweating heavily from his morning jog as he rode the elevator to the twelfth floor. He let himself into Sherlock's apartment and tossed his key onto the entryway table.
"Nothing, nothing!" Sherlock tried to reassure him. "Two guards came by, but they didn't notice me."
." Sherlock crowded John against the tiles, putting his hands on the wall either side of John's head. He leaned close to John's ear and spoke in a gruff whisper. "Do you have any idea how you look when you run? Your sweat-soaked clothes cling to you. Every muscle in your body flexes and releases. I've never seen anything sexier. You drive me
John sensed it as he reached the crest of the hill. He stilled, listening, but he heard nothing out of the ordinary. He drew an arrow and readied his bow. He crept forward slowly and looked out from behind a tree. The pale predawn light glowed on the stream below.
John closed his eyes as his heart tightened painfully. He was glad Sherlock couldn't see his face. He forced his voice to stay steady. "I know. I know you go to England for Christmas every year. I understand, Sherlock."
"Hngh." John realized he was still holding the door open. He quickly closed and locked it. He turned to look at Sherlock again. His face felt hot. "I... I've never seen you... dressed like that."
"Once or twice," Sherlock answered quietly, his expression softening immediately. Desire burned in his verdigris eyes as he watched John pour lube onto his hand and stash the bottle under his pillow.
"Me too." John rose up on his toes and kissed him softly. He dropped back down and held the watch out again. "So, what does 'WSSH' stand for?"
. They talked for countless hours, whether it was over a meal or tangled together Sherlock's bed. Sherlock hadn't just let John into his bed. He'd let John into his heart.
Sherlock and John laid together while the sun rose. When the light from the window was bright, they reluctantly got up and dressed.
Sherlock laughed quietly behind John. When they reached the bedroom, he yanked John back by his hand, capturing him in a scorching kiss.
John smiled to himself when he heard the huge crash of breaking glass behind him. The poor bastard must’ve been holding a nearly-full bottle. Greg didn’t seem to even register the sound, lost as he was in Sherlock’s kiss.
Sherlock smiled ruefully. "She wasn't a 'poor girl,' and I assure you I didn't break her heart. I'm quite sure she's glad to see me gone."
"No, John. I'm fine. And truthfully, if you had, I wouldn't mind." Sherlock put his clean hand in John's hair and pulled him into a languid kiss. John put his arm over the side of the bed and retrieved his handkerchief to clean them up.  When he was finished, John shifted his weight to the side and rested half on top of Sherlock. He laid his head on Sherlock's shoulder. "I love you, Sherlock."
Greg gasped for air, his dark eyes wide but unfocused. Sherlock used his grip to turn Greg’s head and made an outrageous display of kissing him, leading with his tongue and keeping his eyes open a bit longer than expected. When he did close them, he softened his entire body in a show of bliss, his expression enraptured.
Greg responded beautifully to John, melting at his touch. Sherlock was off his barstool and had both hands on Greg’s shoulders. He stroked down his back and then ran his hands up onto Greg’s chest, embracing him firmly from behind. Greg gasped against John’s mouth.
Sherlock continued running his hands over John, exploring his upper body. The fingertips of his left hand were calloused. He bent down and dragged his tongue from John's pectoral to his collarbone. John arched his back and let out a choked cry. He realized all of a sudden that he didn't want to do this on the couch. Not the first time, anyway. He grabbed Sherlock's head with both hands. "
John touched Sherlock's arm, halting him. "Why don't we take a break, my darling?" John smiled at him encouragingly, but Sherlock could see the concern in his eyes.
ask you to hide again, Sherlock. I almost lost you last night. I could have lost the most important person in my life while keeping him a secret from
Sherlock reclaimed John's mouth in a deep kiss. He wrapped his arms around John and held their bodies tightly together.
He lifted his forearm and glanced at Sherlock's watch. Tanisha's lesson would be finished soon. He needed to make his escape before Sherlock caught sight of his face and read his intentions on it.
He finally dropped into the hollow. The glove fell from his mouth as he buried his face in in his hands for several minutes. He took a deep breath, slid his pack off his shoulders, and pulled the boot out of it. Sherlock took his vielle case out of his pack and pulled his other glove off. He opened the case and checked the instrument for damage.
Sherlock moved into John's space. His eyes were smoky gray in the light filtering through the kitchen window. He lifted one graceful hand to John's cheek, pushing his fingertips into John's hair.
The three men sat down for dinner. Mike and John reminisced about some of the mischief they'd gotten into when they were young. Mike seemed to be deliberately bringing up stories that John found a bit embarrassing, grinning conspiratorially at Sherlock when John objected. Several times, Sherlock had to remind himself to eat because he was so enraptured by John.
He parked his car next to Sherlock's at Loose Park and nervously checked his pocket as he walked toward the rose garden.
John's heart was pounding. He was gasping for air as he went outside. As he watched the crest of the hill for the riders, he focused on slowing his breathing. He was Sherlock's only defense. He had to get his fear under control. He picked up the rabbit he'd tossed onto his animal cleaning bench as he had run to the house. He pulled his hunting knife out of his belt and sat on the bench, one eye on the crest of the hill.
"Nice to meet you, Molly." John turned back to Sherlock. "This is probably one of those cliché questions you always get, but I can't help myself. Don't your arms get tired?"
. He looked up in time to see Sherlock’s mouth drop open in surprise as the first loop dropped from between John’s teeth. He was definitely on the right track, then. He took the second loop between his teeth and pulled.
Sherlock appeared in the doorway. He hadn't bothered to put anything on. John's dog tags rested against his chest. "Looks like the salad survived," he said, gesturing at the bowl on the table.
John was just registering the subtle filigree-like scarlet markings on the spade-shaped tip when the demon swiped it away again.
John locked eyes with Sherlock. He nodded once and, drawing in a deep breath, turned and walked away.
The ambulance arrived quickly. John looked up as two paramedics came through the door. As they approached, they recognized him.
Sherlock's heart ached as he watched John. He felt an incredibly strong connection to John, even though they had known each other for such a short time.
"It's not exactly a hardship, wearing a vintage Patek Philippe." He stroked his fingers over the face of the watch. "Not really comparable to those old dog tags, I don't think."
He walked out of view, leaving John utterly wrung out. John heard him drop heavily into the chair next to the wardrobe, still breathing audibly.
"John and I have been working out how to get you two safely out of the country," Mike said. "I'm going to visit my sister in the village this afternoon. Her husband is about your height. I'll get some of his spare clothes for you."
-and said the words, “I’ve taken the liberty of contacting Georgina regarding her schedule and gotten a list of possible dates and times for Rosie’s first haircut.”
He rolled his eyes. “Right. Fine.” It was his fault for asking the wrong question to hop around the minefield of Sherlock’s possible moods. “Are you wanting to shower or should I draw a bath?”
“What’s your pain?” John asked when he got up to put their plates in the kitchen and came back with tea.
“Of course not, John. Don’t be an idiot.” He said. “These are for locks of Rosie’s baby hair. Our daughter does have quite a lot that needs to be cut, I’m afraid. The breakage is becoming quite unfortunate.”
Of all the nightmares that John had suffered through since being shot in Afghanistan, it was by far the most terrifying. Being unable to save faceless, nameless dying soldiers on the battlefield was horrible in its own right, but nothing compared to what he had experienced every night for the last twelve months. Familiarity did little to help and predictability only filled him with dread when his head hit the pillow. The only respite was found in sneaking half of one of Sherlock’s sleeping pills and a swig of brandy, which John knew was, at the very least, a bit not good.
His therapist appeared thoughtful and then nodded. “That makes sense to you, given Sherlock’s history with opiates?”
“Much better.” He agreed, and enjoyed another moment or two before his arm began to ache from supporting so much of his weight. Perhaps after a time he wouldn’t feel the need to put quite as much on it, instead trusting his brace, but for the time being it took the brunt of the pressure. “I need to lay down for a bit before supper. It was a long day.”
“No, not really.” John said, even though it was only a half truth. “His tolerance is through the roof. If I wasn’t administering his tramadol or morphine myself, I wouldn’t know. The pain takes more out of him than the pills do.”
Sherlock settled in on his side on the remaining sliver between John and the back of the sofa, and proceeded to snake around him for comfort, only serving as further evidence that something was terribly wrong.
John handed him the plastic condiment container he bought for his medications. “Can you swallow these?”
The tortoiseshell cat that Sherlock had decided should be called Dominatrix for her aloofness and ability to render him motionless at her will, tactlessly took her place on his lower back and the black kitten John had named Lucifer, after he had been bitten for the third time in two hours, curled up in the crook of his neck. The addition of animals to their already messy flat would not have been John’s first choice but they made him slightly less worried to run errands on four or five days on the pain scale, as he always cleared his schedule on any that were a six or above. What disturbed him most of all was how not long before, hearing Sherlock say “It’s a six.” meant he was referencing a case that was beginning to get interesting.
“Sherlock remains under the asinine belief that you are going to leave him if he doesn’t find a way to satisfy your
“Hello John. Come in, please, I’ll make you a cup of tea.” She said with a warm expression, and John thought she seemed well rested. Rosie must not have kept her up too late.
Hesitant to leave him, but defeated by the knowledge that he would have to leave either way as his phone and the medication had been left in the kitchen. John got up, whispering further apologies into Sherlock’s damp curls. He found both his mobile, rang Anthea for a code to the safe, and reached for the pills before instead drawing his fingertips over vials of morphine.
In their closet, John never bothered counting how many shoe and shirt boxes there were full of old lockets, framed photographs, engraved trinkets and yellowed invitations and thank you notes there were, only settling to tell himself the amount was
Sherlock kept both eyes closed and his voice sounded groggy, but leaning over him allowed John to hear what he said. “Five when I keep my eyes closed, but up to a seven whenever I’ve tried to open them.”
When the front door opened just before six in the morning, it wasn’t Sherlock’s husband that came up to their flat. Thankfully, Mycroft had realized he was unwelcome and Lestrade had to have known the trial run of Sherlock forgiving him had proven to be a wasted experiment. Instead, it was Molly that carefully inched her way into their bedroom with a small cup of prescription medications in one hand, a cup of tea in the other, and a bag of still warm toasted bagels tucked under her arm. She didn’t say much of anything as she watched him swallow the pills, likely told he needed to be supervised for choking or dependability, but Sherlock held back his annoyance. He needed the opportunity to ask.
Not wishing to worry her, as Sherlock had been her acquaintance during the worst of his drug addiction, John kept his explanation vague. “She sent him home with a new medication for the worst days that should be very helpful if he agrees to take it. Mycroft is sending a massage therapist to see both of us this afternoon.”
Mycroft stifled a humorous chuckle. “It’s Baker Street, John. There is only so much that can be done without tearing into the integrity of the building. Finding a jetted tub to fit such a narrow space was not an easy task, I assure you. Should I be sending someone to bring you a few changes of clothes and your toiletries, as well as to feed those nasty little beasties that my brother claims are cats.”
“Climbin’” Rosie shrugged, the lie would have almost been believable to John if Sherlock’s continued chortling hadn’t given it away.
“Hey, have a good day?” John asked in vain, trying to put on a happy face. “Any cases from the blog?”
“Aluminum and a new type of plastic that is strong while lighter than styrofoam.” Mycroft said in the distance outside of John’s thoughts of if he should either let Sherlock down as gently as possible or wait until his boredom and depression took over again to put them in the closet.
Sherlock did oblige, sipping it down over a half hour or so while John ate his toast and tidied the room. His husband slowly inched himself up the headboard until he was sitting flush against it and seemed to be a bit more like himself. Only then did he ask the question on his mind. It was easy to read the man he loved when Sherlock was tired and unguarded, but once he gained some awareness and a degree of relief it was far easier to cloak his suffering.
John Watson hadn’t wanted to go back to therapy so soon after bringing Sherlock home. No, he took that back. He was a father to a toddler and a husband to a man with new physical challenges. He hadn’t wanted to go
Sherlock shook his head carefully. “The cafeteria serves cake.” He explained and Mycroft smiled in response, taking Sherlock’s free hand.
It was an obscene understatement but what else could he say besides letting wild accusations fly? What good would that do if Sherlock clearly couldn’t be arsed to care? Why would
It felt… it felt good, if he was being honest. Accepting the lack of grounding each time he stood was the first reason John had hated the leg braces at at physio but somehow the familiar use of the cane from well before his paralysis seemed to calm that anxiety. It was like his body remembered the shape of it in his hands meaning he wasn’t going to collapse from his psychosomatic limp, and one might say- if they had a particularly dark sense of humor that John certainly could appreciate- that it was just like riding a bike.
to shag in the dark because you didn’t want me to see you cry and I didn’t want you to look at my shoulder. We
Again, Sherlock slowly retreated, leaving John in the middle of the living room. The ridiculous wheeled mirror Sherlock’s grandmother had left him had made its way out into the sitting room and was soon positioned in front of John.
The next thing that should have rang louder on John’s radar was the presence of cardstock and ribbon swatches on Sherlock’s desk, but as he fretted over Sherlock crawling all over the sitting room floor at Rosie’s insistence that they play lions, it was hardly a priority. It may have skimmed the surface of his mind for a moment or two before John decided to blame nostalgia. They’d used the same card stock and ribbon samples for their wedding invitations as well as all of Rosie’s birthdays and Sherlock’s parents' fiftieth anniversary party. Reminiscing over those times was a perfectly acceptable use of time, so John let it go.
She went on and John listened as intently as he could, soaking up anything that wasn’t all doom and gloom, until they reached the end of the path that signaled they were nearing the end of their stroll.
Mycroft smiled sadly, and John knew that was the way most of them had smiled as of late. “I hope it helps
“And, you weren’t shot four years ago only to flatline on the operating table then go into cardiac arrest again the following day.”
It was odd not to have Sherlock chiming in about every scoop of rice or slice of protein going into Rosie’s bowl. He found, instead of relishing in the freedom, the prospect of it made him a bit uneasy. John wasn’t the type to track every serving of each food group that he put in front of a toddler, but he refrained from asking Sherlock while he laid back nursing a possible, though thankfully unlikely, concussion.   If John- a bloody doctor who graduated bloody medical school and became a bloody army captain that ended up with one of the most popular bloody blogs in London- couldn’t figure out how to put takeaway on a plate for a toddler, they were all doomed.
“Oh god,” John loosened his hold on her enough for Rosie to finally get away and he put his head in his hands and brushed back his stringy hair. “That girl is going to give me a heart attack. A stomach ulcer at the very least.”
“How have your pain levels been over the last week, Mr Holmes?” Doctor Fletcher asked, looking at Sherlock with the same tight lipped smile that she always wore while dealing with her moodiest patient of the day. Oftentimes, her only patient of the day.
John smiled a bit wickedly to himself and began ever so gently kneading the strained muscles with his thumbs while Sherlock hummed contentedly. It was a delicate balance, because the tension was obviously genuine but the nerves were on a hairpin trigger. Just when Sherlock needed a deep tissue assault that only an army doctor could stage, he could barely stand more than a gentle rub. Every twinge of pain was increased tenfold, and exhaustion brought his endurance for such down to hardly any. But by the look of his slack faced and preening  lover, John was doing a damn good job finding that sweet spot between pointless pleasure and healing pain.
Snapping his neck up, and out of his thoughts, John wasn’t sure how long he had been quiet. Only that he lacked a leg to stand on, so he sat himself back down.
For some reason, John couldn’t find the mirth in Rosie managing to injure her father to the point in which he had to lay down and close his eyes while watching her.
They were both giggling, delighted playing with the pirate bath toys and that should have made John happy enough to grin like an idiot to himself, but instead it was bitter sweet. John never participated in bath time, the only exception being the month after Sherlock came home from hospital. It always felt too- not personal because that would be indicative of something else entirely. What it felt was too special and too sweet, and John tried to stand out of the way to allow Sherlock those moments. They made him happy, clearly, and John believed he deserved those times.
“Hush, you.” She scolded him and they stopped to wait for traffic. “I’m sure you’re both very tired, dear, but there is no sense in letting your marriage fall to the wayside when at the end of the day when babes move away to start their lives, that’s really all any of us have got.”
“When is Lestrade releasing John?” He questioned, his throat hoarse. John was the one who turned off the air purifiers and cracked the windows before bed, which meant Sherlock had been breathing increasingly dry and stale air throughout the night.
But yes, Sherlock did corner John in the kitchen after breakfast while Rosie was practicing her penmanship-
“What the hell are you doing?” He demanded, and John felt sympathy pains as Sherlock shakily pushed himself up out of his chair and stalked into the kitchen where he had been putting together a tray to take to their coffee table.
The only part of his mind not relishing in the sheer normalcy of the day was focused on how thin Sherlock looked in his new suit. It was needed, of course, given the fact that his old ones had been taken in as far as they went but no longer fit properly. And he had been courteous enough to go for a slightly less slim fit, though one wouldn’t be able to tell just from a glance and it didn’t appear slouched or sloppy in any way. It covered the fact that his waist and hips had wasted away with the rest of him, because one and a half stone of muscle atrophy on a man who never had any weight to spare was a really really big deal.
“I’ve already taken the afternoon off, John, and Anthea is having a late lunch delivered in a half hour or so.” Mycroft leaned forward and put a hand on John’s knee, the touch unbelievably growing familiar over the span of Sherlock’s struggle. “You don’t have to do all of this on your own. Sherlock may be your husband, but he is not just your responsibility. There are many people that owe great debts to him. Remember to allow those the privilege of paying them.”
"Right… well, what’s he like? You're my best friend, Sherlock. I won’t have anyone messing you around."
Then, as John was about to close the door, a horn beeped as another car drew up. “Aah, our last guests.” Sherlock and John moved forward to collect coats and hats from the children and from Greg, then Harry, Clara and Martha Hudson as they came through the door.
“OK, John, I’ve been thinking of what you asked me, and I want to say that nothing would make me prouder than to adopt Rosie…. But on one consideration. Will you marry me?” Sherlock held his breath.
Unexpectedly, Sherlock was ripped back to the present confused for a moment what was happening, then realizing that Johns lips were covering his own, soft, cool. Sherlock gasped.
Greg Lestrade had also been invited. Sherlock had almost fallen over laughing when Greg had come in to NSY not long after the Holmes family had made the invitation. Greg had explained to Sherlock that his ex had been awarded some tickets for a cruise over Christmas as part of a prize draw, a draw she hadn’t even remembered entering. She had never let him see the children on Christmas Day but it seemed that, as the cruise was only available for her and her new partner and the dates were not transferable, the children would simply have to come to him. “What extraordinary luck,” Sherlock had muttered. Then as Mycroft walked through the door right into the middle of this exchange on pretence of business, it was an obvious conclusion that Greg must, absolutely must bring the children to Christmas at his parents’. Smooth, Mycroft, Sherlock thought. Best few thousand you have spent in a long time. Mycroft had smiled serenely at Sherlock, the glint in his eye bringing an unexpected lump to Sherlock’s throat. And so it was: Greg was thrilled beyond anything not only to have Christmas with his children, but to be able to have them share in a real family Christmas, and a chance to get to know Mycroft better too. He was a happy man indeed.
"So… John… is everything okay? Does this - … does this change things between us? I wouldn’t want it to affect our friendship."
As Sherlock’s mind wandered, John studied him. Wondering what he was thinking, he had once called Sherlock a machine, ughh, God, even the thought of that comment now made him feel nauseous. He knew now that Sherlock, wasn’t only not a cold and uncaring automaton, but he was probably one of the most sensitive people he knew. John now knew that he hid that sensitivity to protect himself from the pain and rejection he had felt throughout his life and felt privileged to be one of the few people other than Rosie to see this gently, nurturing side of Sherlock.
“Well, today, this afternoon? My sister is in Hastings for the next few days so I thought we could join her? Anna has a car on standby from Mycroft so it will be safe and luxurious for the trip, we won’t need to pack much, and I already have things like baby sun block and a hat and little sun glasses, I bought them a while ago, just in case, you know?”
She continued, “You have a grounding energy; you breathe life into him when he is burning up and out of control with excess heat. You calm him. You are in tune with the compassion of nature, beauty in its raw form, you speak, people hear and trust you; touch and they feel your healing, compassionate hands. You will guide him and his will guide you. You are so lucky to have him. In two days’ time on the 22
John was bathed in heat, the radiance engulfed his very being, wakening his nerve endings, sending shocks of ecstasy deep into his core. He felt as though he were being wrapped in a cocoon of secure warmth with an extra side of … hmm… hot.
“He loves her. He pretends to be this fusty middle-aged man, but he can’t fool me, he has a soft spot in there somewhere.”
For a moment Sherlock looked confused, he had certainly picked up earlier that John had something on his mind, but that feeling had passed with the easiness of the night. “John what is it? Are you ok? Please tell me”
Sherlock stepped back to see John properly, “I feel that this Christmas will be the best ever Christmas for my brother too,” he said, his eyes twinkling with mischief.
"Yeah, but... you said... I mean, I asked you if you had a boyfriend... you said... you said you were married to your work – at Angelo’s, that night I had my first case with you."
Sherlock sat, quiet as a mouse on the third stair from the top, hunched over, rigid, unmoving apart from his chest forming a rhythm with his rapid breaths, listening intently to the sounds below.
They had lounged one night in their respective armchairs, each nursing a glass of Taliska. The single malt had been a thank you gift from the distillers on the Isle of Skye after a case of embezzlement had been solved in hours by Sherlock. The Bottle had been forgotten at the back of a cupboard during the bad times, but had been unearthed recently when Sherlock was searching for a lost set of pipettes. The Malt was fine, an odd aroma really, reminiscent of the seaside, all seaweed, fresh and salty, but the taste, mmm the taste, a luxurious mix of smoke and pepper with an aftertaste of fine malt barley. The whiskey soon released their tongues, allowing words both happy and sad to pour from them, each taking it in turn to purge their souls of some of the things that had remained unsaid. The warmth and anaesthetic properties of the alcohol taking the edge off the situation.
“Sherlock! John! it has been too long” Angelo somehow managed to pull them both together into a tight embrace, John’s nose and mouth shoved against the hard wall of Sherlocks torso as they were squeezed together and praised as being Angelo’s most special customers. After a few seconds, they were released, John gasping for air, blushing furiously.
The polished wood glinted in the muted light of the chandelier fixed high above, the crystals throwing fractal patterns on the ceiling and cream coloured walls. Dust motes dancing within air caught in the spotlight momentarily until their orbit plunged them back into obscurity. The green of the potted plants seated firmly against the balcony rail seemed at odds with the austere rich chestnut of the staircase. And the red and green patterned carpet made him think that someone had vomited Christmas over the stairwell.
Once again John could say nothing, he just didn’t know how. For so long his feelings had been a kaleidoscopic cacophony of emotions. A blur that he could never quite hold onto for long enough to sort out, what if he was wrong, what if his confession sent Sherlock running for the hills. What if Sherlock was happy with the situation but John realized that he needed more. He was terrified of ruining the only real love apart from Rosie that he had ever experienced.
With that Johns parents departed into the lounge. Leaving John and Sherlock standing together looking at each other in confusion. “I was so sure they would hate me Sherlock. They, they like you, they don’t care that we are together.”
John’s heart plummeted. This was an odd night. Here they were, standing outside their home, the taxi waiting patiently as the fare trundled upwards minute by minute. One minute, everything had been fine - and now, not only was Sherlock
John drew back, his heart plunging into the depths, John tried to step back, to run, to hide. “Oh this had been such a mistake.”
“Wow, time flies when having fun John said” as he silently tried to message his desire to leave now to Sherlock. He knew that Angelo would happily talk well into the night if they didn’t take their leave.”
It sort of made sense… in a mad way.  Of course!  He relaxed, then smiled. He leaned down, smoothing the hair from Johns faced, rubbing his thumb across John’s jaw. John leaned into his touch, “I love you too, John.”
John, gaped not quite willing to acknowledge that he didn’t even know what the summer solstice was and therefore didn’t know whether he should be celebrating it, or how he would do such a thing.
"Come on," he said. "Help get me out of these fatigues... shower with me... then let me take you to bed."
As he glanced to his left, he noticed the small spider spinning her web. Of course, he knew the science. But, looking at the fragile thing now, suspended in the corner, it was a thing of beauty. He caught his breath as he watched her creating a unique piece of work that would be demolished as soon as the cleaner spotted it on Boxing Day. He felt sorry for her. Sitting quietly making her web, trying to stay out of the way, but still managing to provoke such extreme reactions in anyone who should see her. Hmmm, he knew that feeling well.
The children ran rampant through the house, exploring and squealing with delight. Sherlock and Mycroft played duets together then, instead of nodding curtly, hugged uncertainly.
"'Alan Turing'? Okay…" John had noticed Sherlock's reaction; it made him feel a little uncomfortable. "Sherlock, is everything alright? Is this costume okay? I mean, you ah… you didn’t give me much info, and I didn’t have much time to hit the costume store. I can… change, if you want?"
Sherlock pressed more water to John’s lips, and then went to the bathroom, returning with a cool damp flannel, wiping across John’s fevered face.  John was wearing only his boxers, and a thin sheet, an attempt to help control his surging fever. Sherlock tried to avert his gaze from John’s body as he tended lovingly to his needs. He realised now, as he wiped John’s brow, that John was really stunningly beautiful. His gorgeous eyes, that opened intermittently, were unfocussed in delirium but still lovely. He took in the strong line of John’s jaw, the juncture where it met his neck, before his gaze moved down to John’s chest. The beads of sweat from the fever, caught in the hair there, glistening like dew drops in the early morning sun. The ragged breaths, the rise and fall of his chest caused Sherlock to inhale sharply as his love surged forward before he was able to capture it and push it back in again. He forced himself to look away, wouldn’t allow himself to look further. It felt like a breach of privacy, after all John was not really ‘here’. Sherlock had no right to steal personal looks and was sure that John would be mortified if he found out that Sherlock had looked at him like that, examining closely each and every curve, each muscle, sinew, tendon, every inch of skin.
Sherlock stood at the bottom of the stairs, waiting for Rosie to see him. “Sh’lock, Sh’lock!” she screamed… Where is Father chrintmas?”
“Hello, Rosie.” Sherlock scooped her up, smiling at her delighted squeals. “I missed you last night, we will have double story time later! As for Father Christmas,” he said, slowly enunciating the sounds for her, “Well, you must be in bed early tonight, to see what he will bring… you have to be patient.” He laid a kiss on her head, and placed her carefully down on the floor.” At her age, she didn’t even really understand the concept, but John was adamant that Father Christmas would come to visit, and Sherlock was secretly pleased that for the first time ever, this dusty old house would host the fat man in the silly red suit.
John and Sherlock snuggled on the luxurious sofa, hand in hand, whispering plans for their ears only. Clara sat in Harry’s lap, smiling at her good fortune, not daring to imagine how different things could have turned out. And Mycroft – Mycroft and Greg – well, at first they sat in arm chairs either side of the roaring fire, and as the day became evening and became night, their chairs had moved closer. They flirted gently, but no one in the room was foolish enough not to feel the sexual tension in the air.
“Mmm, you feel so good. I love your smooth skin. You are so gentle but so strong, a contradiction.”  John’s breathing had become a little more rapid as he spoke to his bed partner.
All eyes rested on Sherlock, then John, who looked at each other, then giggled like children…. There were gasps all round… Mrs Hudson took a handkerchief from her sleeve and dabbed at her eyes.
John took Sherlock’s hand, and as they turned they were met with a gust of freezing air as the door was flung open again. Greg pushed in his son and daughter… “Come on you two, let’s get warm…”
"My sexuality shouldn’t surprise you," Sherlock said, frowning. "Just because you're not comfortable with yours, doesn’t mean I am not with mine… it is but a small part of who I am."
His hands smoothed over the fabric, rough and hard wearing, but also comforting, as his mind wandered back to Afghanistan. Bullets flying; the sounds of catastrophic destruction, invading every part of his being. And the pain – oh God, the pain. It had been bad. Not straight away - adrenalin had taken care of that - but when the infection and subsequent sepsis had set in, there had been almost nothing but pain.
It was this, his love and affection for his dearest friend that got him through his ordeal. When Mycroft had finally manged to secure his release, saving him from that hell hole, it was John he dreamed about in the nights following.  And when he had got home, the devastation he had felt when he had discovered that John had moved out of Baker Street, moved in with ‘that woman’, had been lessened by the knowledge that John, ‘his John’ was safe.
Sherlock watched mesmerised as he saw John stretching out his legs, moving as though he indeed was wrapped around another person. John reached out his right arm arcing it slightly through mid-air, and resting it lightly on the bed in front of him as though he was resting it gently along his lover’s waist.
It had been a while for John - but his hand instinctively knew what to do. The long thrusts from tip to base became quicker in time with Sherlock's gasps and breaths.
The sun-beam slipped through the gap in the curtains, dust motes dancing lazily as John stretched. “Mmmm, pffff,” John puffed out an exhalation. 21? “Bloody hell how did that happen?” Clenching and unclenching his fingers he felt the knuckles crunch and winced, his mother’s voice creeping in to his head. “You’ll have arthritis by the time you’re 21 if you keep cracking your knuckles like that”, John grinned. Well, 21 and still no arthritis. He did feel knackered though. The last week had been a roller coaster of exams and assessments. Half way through med school, just another three to go before the next stage.
Sherlock’s expression dared John to disagree - but John simply stared, astonished by Sherlock’s sudden declaration.
Sherlock felt a mixture of surprise, shock and also a little sadness as he saw John play acting the love scene in front of him. A scene he would never get to share. Should he leave the room?  Looking over at John, his hot sweaty skin gleamed in the streaks of daylight that were now pouring through the curtains, Sherlock sighed.
The virus hit John’s body like a train running on full steam and out of control. Within hours, John was febrile and delirious.  Sherlock had eased him in to his own double bed, much easier to tend to him with the kitchen and bathroom so near.  He had dragged his arm chair next to the bed so he could stay close at all times. And each and every half hour through that first night, Sherlock had pressed cool water to his lips, ensuring that John was taking regular sips, administered paracetamol and mopped John’s burning body with cool damp towels.
The air in the room was suddenly full of nervous energy and sexual tension. John looked Sherlock up and down, stopping at his groin, where an obvious erection was vying for attention against the expensive but narrow cut of the costume trousers.
He turned slightly to examine his profile. His arse looked good in these. They were a bit tight, and hugged his thighs and arse rather closely. But it was definitely in a good way.
When the shit hit the fan, when Mary was killed and John had hit rock bottom, he had been there for him. His own heart was breaking, not because of the loss of ‘her’ but because John was struggling. John was grieving.  John was in pain, therefore so was he. To the outside world, he, Sherlock Holmes was cold, aloof, uncaring, and he didn’t give a damn how they saw him. He knew that his heart, in fact his whole universe was dedicated to loving the man, he would never be able to call his, but who he could look after and cherish, if only from afar.
“Yes John, the longest day of the year, a time where the earth’s axis is….. Sherlock had slipped into his mind palace to purge the room in which he kept facts about space, the solar system and other ‘useless information’ (for John’s benefit).
Mycroft couldn’t keep the smile of his face as the young child hugged his leg. John shook his hand, “Happy Christmas Mycroft, thank you for inviting us.”
John sat back in his armchair, considering the instructions. Sherlock had left little direction as to the nature of the costume - so John could only presume it was 'anything goes'.
Sherlock almost choked. Curls? Curls? Who was it John was draped around in his mind? He felt a stab of jealousy. Sherlock cast his mind back over John’s recent and not so recent conquests. Hmmm, not one of them had even slightly wavy hair, never mind curls.
Their mouths crushed together - tongues searching, tasting each other and John’s semen at the same time.
. Wine was poured and conversation was easy. Both Sherlock and John relaxing into the child free evening. John giggled at a comment made by Sherlock who then had to hide his sudden intake of breath behind a cough. Johns laugh, was like liquid silver and it glazed Sherlocks insides in a luminescent glow. For so long John’s heart had been broken, Sherlock had wondered if he would hear the laughter again, but it had come gradually and now was an omnipresent sound in their home, ever present but never faltering in the physical effect it had on Sherlock.
“Oh God, Sherlock, yes, yes of course. Oh, I don’t know what to say. I really didn’t see this coming.” Tears sprang to the corners of John’s eyes.
Sherlock woke every morning waiting for the proverbial axe to fall. As soon as his brain came on line, he awaited the moment where reality slammed back into him, to reveal the person who was lonely, and bereft of friends. His breath would hasten his heart beat accelerate. Then he would hear the small sounds of Rosie playing in her room. Rosie who slept even less than he did, but who was happy to play if she had something to engage her young mind. His relief at that moment, never failed to fuel his fire and extinguish the doubt that had plagued that dark age. Now he was, well, he was happy. Mmmm, yes happy. A word people use every day, but until recently, a word he had never fully comprehended. Sure, he had experienced, delight, and excitement; the odd moment of joy. And over the past six months or so, he had laughed a lot more when Rosie, or more usually, John did something hilariously silly. But now, yes happiness. It was a constant, only interrupted by that momentary lapse of uncertainty each morning as he woke.
"Shit... sorry Sherlock, I think I’m just shocked. I can’t say I haven’t wondered. I mean... you're a good-looking bloke, and there doesn’t seem to have been anyone. I thought you were asexual… or just not interested. Then when you just blurt out that you're gay, it's like... wow. Okay. That came from nowhere."
Sherlock blinked rapidly, realising that he had gone for a trip down memory lane whilst John had been removing his coat and gloves, and was now standing, waiting patiently.
He drank in the memories of John’s laugh, oh! His laugh, that light childish giggle. He allowed it to quench the thirst left by days of miniscule sips of foul water, given just to extend his suffering.  As his captors drew close, shouting and cursing into his face, he let his memories roam back to the moments when John had leaned over his shoulder, cheek almost touching his, light breaths rippling on his smooth skin, as John, looking at his laptop, murmured agreement or ‘usually not’ at a comment he was trying to enforce.
Sherlock bowed his head slightly, reducing the distance between his head and John’s. “John, what is it? Are you ill?”
As the last strains of the music dissolved into silence, he huffed out the breath he hadn’t been aware he had been holding. Old habits die hard and all that. To make a mistake whilst playing, even in practice, would bring criticism and frustration from their parents. He sighed in relief, then smiled inwardly.
, he would chuckle and say... “well maybe not, but I have a wonderful young man”. He wished that he had come out of the closet sooner. He had had girlfriends, on and off from 14, lost his virginity to a girl at 15. And then to a boy at 16. He had never thought his bisexuality to be a problem, but his parents were old school.
“I’m so sorry, love. God, I’m so sorry.” John rubbed Sherlock’s back as he failed to entirely hold back several wails, curling up into himself in a fruitless effort to soothe what John could only imagine was agonizing cramping. “Sherlock, do you need me to call an ambulance? Where is your pain now?”
“Sinus. Everything’s burning. My nose, my throat, and even behind my eyes.” Sherlock scrunched up in pain as John held his hand to resist the urge to try to wipe the pain away.
The blow was lower than low, but that was what Mycroft had found Doctor Carlisle to do. After John nearly killed Sherlock, and still wanted to find a way back into his life, a therapist of Mycroft’s choosing was part of the deal. He’d spent hundreds of hours in that room over the last few years and what happened to Sherlock was a foundational topic of conversation.
to worry about how our families would take the news and if we would have to elope because no one would be willing to come to the wedding. Hell, if this had happened any earlier then I might have had trouble being the one to make your medical decisions in the hospital and push for the right diagnosis. Those nurses hated me by the end of it.”
For all the heartless bastard the world believed he was, Sherlock Holmes had an affinity for mementos. Sentiment in a physical form, allowed to exist outside of his cluttered mind bursting at the seams with what it
“You said I didn’t have to sleep.” Sherlock pouted and he could not have been more relieved to see his husband’s beautiful face distorted with something other than pain.
The discomfort and remorse that crossed Greg’s face made John feel a bit bad, but it didn’t make his statement any less accurate. It technically had been his fault that Sherlock had so many seizures in hospital, after having talked John out of continuing to keep him sedated. That also meant it was Greg’s fault that he’d spent so much time in blinding and deafening pain. Not that that was what Sherlock was upset about, explicitly. It was- John supposed he would call the matter adjacent.
His request was granted and slowly Sherlock’s hands released until the detective stepped back to look at him, awe in his eyes. “John you look-“
Tears. Struggling to speak. Crying out. Immobility. On the chronic pain scale, described as the worst pain most people could possibly ever feel.
John huffed a chuckle as Rosie’s tiny fingernail found the right divot in the plastic and popped the turtle open with another squeal of delight. “Two spares it is.”
Though, to be fair, John wasn’t entirely incorrect. She and Sherlock did tend to find themselves in trouble when they were together. Be it cocaine, arrests, or shared week long bouts of insomnia while ranting their way through deductions and conspiracy theories, when they were running about London self destruction tended to follow. But now, they both had children. That had to count for something, though Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure what that something was. Maybe that they were maturing and each had a tangible and
“It was nice? That’s wonderful.” He said, and penguin walked over to the kitchen table to set down the takeaway and packages so he could perch Rosie on his hip. “Why was it nice? What did you do?”
Immediately he regretted his words, not even considering Sherlock’s flinch at the suggestion, but chose not to say anything. Some things were best simply left alone.
“I want to,” Sherlock said through grit teeth, and rolled his hips into John in a way that left him wanting nothing more than to pound into his husband until they were the only things that existed in their own little world. It was not unlike the two of them to go from one round straight into the other. Still, another series of betraying gasps and even more tears told John all he needed to know.
He sat back, straddling Sherlock's thighs, and took a moment to look. Sherlock was stretched out between the headboard and John, wearing nothing but John's dog tags. His chest was rising and falling rapidly, his eyes burning with arousal.
John was heavy and warm, halfway on top of Sherlock. Sherlock continued stroking his hair, listening to his breathing become slower and deeper. He marveled at his good fortune and made a silent vow that he would take care of John. Keep him safe. Give him
When Sherlock opened his eyes again, it was dark outside. The only light in the small house came from the fireplace. The house smelled incredible. John had placed the rye loaf on the kitchen table. He was putting flat bread into a small bag. Sherlock looked into the fireplace and saw two potatoes roasting. The pot of rabbit stew was hanging above the flames.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut for a moment and took a deep breath. He tipped his head back and looked at the ceiling, letting the breath out slowly.
Sherlock knew he needed to leave. It was tearing him apart to know that John would be hurt when Sherlock disappeared, but he couldn't stay and continue to endanger him. Sherlock couldn't bear the thought of John suffering because of him. He would wait for John to go to sleep and steal away into the darkness. The problem was that Sherlock was finding it increasingly difficult to imagine a future for himself that did not include John Watson.
John sat up and looked at him. "Sherlock. I've heard quite enough about what other people think about you. I don't care about them. And I don't want someone like me. I want
John’s hands made their way into his glossy black hair, and found that it was thick and silky-soft. His hips pushed upward instinctively against the heat of the demon’s abdomen. John was already rock-hard. Immediately, he was desperate to get rid of the sheet and the layers of clothing between them.
Sherlock reclaimed John's mouth, kissing him deeply as he continued rolling his hips gently. Waves of pleasure coursed through John's body. Suddenly, Sherlock sat upright, still straddling John. He grabbed hold of John's tie and gave it a light tug. John groaned again. Sherlock pulled John's tie loose and threw it down onto the floor. He yanked his own jacket off and threw that down as well. John's arousal surged even higher as he watched. He was gasping for breath.
Sherlock took John's face in his hands, pushing his fingers into John's hair. He bent down and kissed him. He employed every technique he had learned from John's kiss downstairs until John was trembling under him. He finished unbuttoning John's shirt and pushed it off of his shoulders. He then tossed the shirt to the floor. His eyes raked over John's body, taking in every detail. "May I touch you?"
John was spellbound as he listened to the orchestra play. Twice more, Sherlock played solos, this time sounding almost... playful. John's heart pounded wildly both times. A pretty, dark-haired young woman played some lovely cello solos as well.
Sherlock bent down and put his forehead against John's again. He closed his eyes. "John, I don't know how to do this."
John pulled Sherlock's nightshirt off and dropped it. Sherlock brought his hands up. He trailed his fingers over John's upper body. John surrendered to Sherlock's touch, leaning over him and closing his eyes.
John wrapped Sherlock's hand around them both of them together, gasping in pleasure. "Oh, you feel so good, Sherlock!" He kept his own left hand over Sherlock's right, guiding him.
"I know! I know. I need to get the room alone so you'll be seen by the smallest possible number of people and not have to talk to anyone." He looked into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock could see his fear. "But I'm so scared of losing you."
"None of those things are in any way your fault," Watson interjected. He handed me a perfect cup of tea and sat down next to Holmes, taking his hand.
John's vision whited out. He gasped deeply and stopped breathing. His back arched as he came over Sherlock's hand. When he finished, he moaned and panted as he began breathing again. "Oh,
Sherlock paged through his music, preparing for the Brahms symphony while John watched. When the house lights went down, Sherlock stood and tuned the orchestra. Lestrade came back out, and they began.
Sherlock looked stricken. "I wouldn't tease you like that." He put his hand out and grabbed John's sleeve. "I'm serious. It's wonderful. Your home. Everything has a purpose. There's no wasted space. Nothing frivolous. It's
John glanced around. Sherlock was right. Most of the ER staff was staring incredulously, not even pretending to work. John met Sherlock's eyes. "I don't give a rat's ass," he growled as he pulled Sherlock back into his arms. He felt Sherlock gasp slightly and melt against him.
Sherlock grabbed John's shirt, holding him in place. "I'll be waiting," he whispered before kissing John heatedly. He let go. John staggered back unsteadily. Sherlock grinned at him.
John busied himself with stoking the fire in the hearth back to life. He hung the pot of rabbit stew he'd made the night before above the fire to warm. All the while, he willed himself not to notice the beautiful young man undressing behind him. He thought to himself:
Sherlock suddenly released John's wrists and dropped to his knees. John groaned loudly. His right hand grabbed at the shelves as his left dropped onto Sherlock's head. His fingers immediately tangled in Sherlock's hair.
John sat up a bit and looked Sherlock in the eye. "Are you telling me that the great Sherlock Holmes can't deduce bisexuality?"
John reclaimed Greg’s attention by stroking his hand down from his shoulder to hold his arm just above the elbow. The effect on Greg was immediate. He turned to meet John’s eyes, his body swaying almost imperceptibly toward him.
John didn't know which one of them moved first. It didn't matter. They crashed together, grabbing at each other desperately. Sholto pushed his demanding tongue into John's mouth immediately. John responded by shoving Sholto backward until the backs of his knees hit the side of his bunk. He threw Sholto down, and was dragged down with him when Sholto kept a tight hold on John's shirt.
John was quickly losing any semblance of control in the encounter. Had he really agreed to this? If he didn’t pause this now, he never would. He managed to claw back enough self-control to put his hands on the demon’s shoulders and push him back.
The man's eyes followed John's gesture to the car rounding the corner at the end of the block. He visibly deflated. "Oh... God... I'm so sorry! Are you hurt?"
you are." He took hold of Sherlock's cock, causing Sherlock to convulse with pleasure. "You're the most extraordinary man I've ever known. I didn't know it was possible to love someone as much as I love you." He dipped lower and took Sherlock's cock into his mouth.
, Sherlock grasped John's aching cock and licked a broad stripe across the head. John cried out in relief. Sherlock took John fully into his mouth. John put both hands back into Sherlock's hair and was rewarded with a moan around his cock. As John clenched his fists in the wet curls, he felt Sherlock put his hands on John's hips and go pliant.
John took the elevator to the twelfth floor - the top floor of the building. When he stepped out into the hallway, he realized that there were only two apartments on the twelfth floor.
"Good. Now, relax and let me show you." He smiled wickedly and lowered his head again, kissing one of John's surgery scars.
After a few minutes, he looked up. There was anger and concern in John's eyes. Sherlock tried to give him a reassuring smile. "It's all right, John. Really. Please eat your supper, it's going cold."
When Sherlock woke again, the sun was high and John was gone. Sherlock sat up slowly and looked around. John was pulling food out of his pack for them. When he saw Sherlock looking at him, he grinned and came over to him.
Sherlock showed no mercy, working John hard. He moved one hand to John’s bollocks, holding them with precisely the right amount of pressure. His other hand clutched John’s thigh.
, his fingers digging into Sherlock's hips. He shoved himself up against Sherlock, his still-clothed but
He was watching a young boy throw dirt clods at the birds when two king's guards came around the corner. Sherlock was seized by terror, his heart suddenly pounding. He tipped his head slightly lower, hiding his face further but still watching.
They spent the afternoon under the trees. John told Sherlock stories about his childhood, his time as a soldier, his injury, and his recovery. Sherlock listened raptly, occasionally asking a question. He was particularly fascinated by the stories about the mischief John had got up to with Mike when they were children. He felt himself falling more and more in love with John with each passing moment.
Angelo shook John's hand vigorously. "Nice to meet you, John." He turned to Sherlock. "I've got something in the back for you, Sherlock. Come on over. I'll get it."
Sherlock tucked John's left wrist between John's own right wrist and Sherlock's left hand. He then dragged his right hand down John's arm, continuing down his chest and stomach before plunging his hand into John's underclothes. He took hold of John, dragging his thumb through the precome on the head of John's cock.
John held his hand up in surrender. "Or you could keep them if you like," he said in a soothing tone.
"I'm going to do some chores, cut some firewood. Sleep as long as you want. I'll be right outside if you need me."
John hung his bow on its hook. He took the pack off his back and set it next to the bed. He hung his quiver up next to his bow before turning to look at the prince. "I told you. I'm not stupid. Just look at you. Look at your boots, for God's sake! I've never seen such a fine pair of boots."
But he was enjoying Sherlock's company immensely. He'd never met anyone like him. When Sherlock offered to buy John dinner, he accepted, reluctant to break the spell that seemed to have fallen over them both. But the battle continued.
"Really, John, must I spell out every detail?" Sherlock raised his hands in exasperation. "The siren call of domesticity! If you date, you could wind up falling in love with someone. If you fall in love with someone, you'll want to live with them. You'll want to
John went back to the barn to see if he could make himself useful while they waited for Mike. He'd insisted that Sherlock rest on Mike's bed while John worked. He decided to muck out the horses' stalls. When he'd finished, he walked outside. The sun had dropped low in the sky.
John's mouth opened on impact, allowing Sherlock to explore it with his tongue. John moaned and pushed his hands inside Sherlock's dressing gown, clutching at the back of Sherlock's shirt and pulling him even closer.
Sherlock's cries had devolved into whimpers. He continued to shiver intermittently under John. John shifted his weight to Sherlock's side so he wouldn't get too heavy on his chest. Sherlock's hands fell away from the balusters to rest limply against the pillow.
The closer they got to the shore, the busier the streets became. John did his best to keep Sherlock from being jostled by the traffic. When they were close to the ships, John found a corner where Sherlock could wait while he looked for a ship that could take them across the channel.
"Indeed, John... here you are." Sherlock felt like he'd been struck by lightning. Every atom in his body seemed to be vibrating at an alarming rate, threatening to liquify him in an instant. John - John looked… gorgeous. All Sherlock could think of was standing to attention,
The two men pushed back from each other gasping for air, then they just giggled. They fell into each other’s arms and held each other whilst the excess energy was released.
The time Sherlock had spent after ‘the fall’, had made been made bearable only by the fact that John was safe.  That even though John believed him dead, Sherlock was keeping him safe.  In the darkest moments, when each breath felt like an inhalation of glass splinters, the sunlight soothed him when he imagined John’s face.  He, Sherlock Holmes, detached, cold and untouchable, allowed himself to feel.  He allowed the butterflies in his stomach, to unfurl their wings when thinking of John’s eyes, allowed them to flutter lightly, over the pain of the red hot searing flesh, flesh that had been beaten and broken by his captors.
A tree? Of course, the tree was a festive decorative addition but not for them; it was decorated meticulously and situated in the drawing room, where the adults would stand around drinking expensive champagne and brandy on Christmas Eve. They would laugh at poor jokes and clap politely after they as children were forced into an ‘impromptu’ concert, that they of course had been forced to practice for weeks. They had then been ushered back off to bed, leaving the adults to Christmas cheer. He smiled slightly as he thought about himself and Mycroft huddling on the landing, peering through the rails, deducing the behaviour of the drunken guests. They had collected enough ammunition to ruin characters and careers, break marriages and ruin families, but why make others as miserable as themselves?
Christmas! As a child, he had seen pictures in books, adverts and bits of films on the television (not that the watching of television was encouraged of course) where families would get together, sing, and laugh, hug and kiss. In those films, there were always decorations hung on every surface, garish and bright, but beautiful nonetheless. A tree would always take centre stage, dressed in gaudy baubles and draped with sparkling foil tinsel. The trees would be surrounded with bright gifts, wrapped with as much ribbon as care. The gifts would be surprises, not always good surprises, but surprises nonetheless.
John smiled, at her excitement, and forward planning. In turn Sherlock relaxed a little more, knowing that Rosie would be fine, and in fact would have a wonderful little holiday. And so, it was, later that afternoon, a giggling Rosie was strapped into her car seat into the back of the black limo followed by “Anna and Mrs Hudson.
When John had met the love of his life, he had fallen instantly. It hadn’t been straight forward, the man was, shy- well romantically and sexually. Otherwise he was a bolshie bastard. But John had persevered and the first night they had tumbled into bed had been wonderful, messy, a jumble of arms, legs and blushes from his inexperienced lover, but it had also been prefect. They had spent every moment of free time together since.
Sherlock smiled at her unselfconscious attempt at the word ‘Christmas.’  He knew John had been teaching her every day, and her speech was coming along well - with some interesting words thrown in for good measure.
“Please hold me, come closer,” John said to him, eyes locked on his but seemingly unseeing, glazed by fever. “I’m cold! Please--” John’s shaky voice almost pleaded.
“Aaah, its quiet”, John sighed, rolling his shoulders to unfurl his tight muscles. He looked around and quickly tidied Rosie’s toys away into her toy box and put her books back on her shelf before going to make a cup of tea.”
John looked at his parents, pulling back from the bear hugs, his mouth gaping open. You- you don’t mind? You still, you still love me? Tears now trickled freely down his face, mum, dad… thankyou…. I love you both so much.
Sherlock felt bound to John, felt as though he was the ivy clinging for life to a solid wall, yet craved to be closer still. He felt like he was home, like he had put down roots. Feeling John’s very presence running coolly within his veins, the sturdiness and strength holding him tight, holding him in place.
There had been moments - too many to count now - where he and Sherlock had collapsed laughing in a heap, especially following a case. A moment where if Sherlock had been a woman, John would have leaned in for a kiss. But the one thing that stopped that, John suddenly realised, wasn’t Sherlock being a man - but that Sherlock supposedly wasn’t interested in men.
Mrs Hudson sat happily, eating mince pies and drinking sherry whilst sharing stories about ‘her boys’ with Mr and Mrs Holmes. The children crashed following a sugar high whilst watching ‘The Snowman’ on the huge TV that had appeared unexpectedly on Christmas Eve morning.
They sat on the floor in the waning light for some time, until the air became cool and they both began to shiver.
Sherlock jumped slightly at the order - but his own cock stiffened in arousal as he took John further into his mouth, increasing his suction and thrusting hard.
John couldn’t speak. He wanted to stay in character, but his heart was beating hard as he felt Sherlock's breath on his cock.
John laughed as this was his plan since Mrs Hudson had come up with her idea. Tonight, he would tell Sherlock how he felt. After, all tomorrow was the solstice, He didn’t know much about it but presumed that somehow midnight to midnight was ‘the magic time’. He chuckled quietly to himself not certain why he had developed a sudden interest in the supernatural, or, well whatever it was.
John was a little non-plussed by Sherlock’s reaction to his uniform. But he decided to steer the conversation away for now.
The text alert sounded just as John finished brushing his teeth. One quick last look in the mirror, and he strode out of the flat with purpose, every bit the soldier he was dressed as.
In the early hours of the next morning the two men lay together, ragged and sweaty. The heat from their bodies cooling in the night air. They had kissed, touched each other, and whispered words and thoughts that should have been shared months ago, realizing that they had felt the same for each other for so long, vowing to talk more in the future. For now, they needed no more. The physical attraction was almost painful, once they had gotten this far, but the need to just be in each other’s arms, tasting each other, and falling asleep knowing that tomorrow was indeed going to be a very special day, the first day of being this close. But unlike the Celestial bodies above, John and Sherlock knew that they had found their correct orbit and wouldn’t be distancing themselves again. John still wasn’t sure whether he believed in dream interpretation, but he certainly now believed in a little bit of magic.
“I wanted this for so long, wanted to hold you in my arms, wanted to feel your skin next to mine – I love you so much, Sherlock.”
Mycroft smiled. “Welcome to our parents’ home, John.  Please come in, you are the first here. Let’s get this door closed. Mother and father are in the drawing room, when you are ready.”
One last kiss to his parents and he floated out of the room. Never, ever had he envisioned this scenario.
When the food arrived, they grinned as the aromas of garlic, tomatoes and onions filled the air around them. They had never had a poor meal at the hands of Angelo. The food was simply divine. Both men grunted and hummed in appreciation as they ate. John cherished these times when Sherlock's appetite reared its head, allowing Sherlock to tuck into his meal with gusto. At some point Angelo, had whipped over and replaced the spent wine bottle with a fresh one, and by the time they had finished their entrée and Tiramisu dessert, they were both sated, a little more than tipsy and feeling very contented. They sat and chatted some more whilst Angelo brought coffee, and sat a while with them reminiscing over old times and enquiring about
“John. About this boy’s night out? I don’t really think I am up to that really”, Sherlock muttered from the doorway, glancing up, unsure, not wanting to disappoint John.
Deftly he undid the belt, easing the buckle free but leaving the rest of the belt in place. He then turned his attention to the trouser fasteners, and within moments had access to John’s cock through his pants. Sherlock gasped as he saw the large bulge straining at the stretchy fabric.
the earth and sun will be closer than at any other time of the year. And you and he will be closer than at any other time too. If there are things to be said that remain unsaid, take this opportunity, as this day brings great power and a little bit of magic.”
“Come on through, come on through.” Charlie and Sophie, aged five and seven respectively, were a little shy but Martha Hudson held out her hands.
John’s heart sank, as he imagined his parents on the phone cancelling his party to his disgruntled relatives who had been denied of a sausage roll at short notice.
The following morning John felt that the universe was giving him a helping hand. He and Sherlock had not been on a case in over a week and were a little stir crazy, tensions running high, especially on Sherlock’s side. Mrs Hudson had noticed and had chatted to Anna one of the nannies before approaching John and Sherlock first thing with her proposal. “Boy’s Boys, listen up. My God daughter is really very special to me and I have hardly seen her these last few weeks. She is growing so quickly. I was wondering, well I know how protective you are of her, but I was wondering if you would let me take her away for a few days. With Anna, of course! She is happy to come and work through. It will be like a little holiday. I thought we could take her to the beach and buy her ice-cream and I promise to look after her boys.”
“When will your friend get here John?” His dad asked breathlessly in-between puffs into a long yellow banana shaped balloon. “He’ll be here at 11. He would have come over with me yesterday but... well I wanted to chat with you lone first.” John looked at his parents for any sign that they looked upset, but they just looked intrigued…
When he opened his eyes again, he wasn't sure how much time had passed. He looked at the faint light coming in through the windows. It was different now that the Plaza's Christmas lights were on. Brighter. Richer. He watched it play over Sherlock's body, the light and shadow shifting as Sherlock's chest rose and fell gently with his breathing. John trailed his fingertips over Sherlock's collarbone and down his chest. As John's fingers passed lightly over his abdominal muscles, Sherlock jerked and snickered. He captured John's hand with his own. "That tickles," he muttered with a sleepy grin. He laced their fingers together and rested their joined hands on his belly.
"Good." John's fingers continued across Sherlock's collarbone and onto his upper arms. They traced back onto his shoulders and down his chest. Sherlock could feel John's breath against the left side of his neck. He was trembling with desire, but he waited.
Sherlock clamped a hand onto his other shoulder to keep him in place. “At least let him finish explaining, Lestrade.”
One of the nights that John thought about the most was the night he'd attended a Philharmonic concert for the second time. The music had been lovely, but the truly memorable part of that evening had been taking that fine tuxedo off of Sherlock piece by piece afterward.
John looked up at Sherlock's window and sighed deeply. Lightning streaked across the sky to the west.
John put his hands up in surrender. "All right... Sherlock." John bent down and pulled Sherlock's right boot off. "You should probably change into something more comfortable. Do you have a nightshirt in your pack?"
John watched as Sherlock stripped down to his underclothes and began washing. The candlelight played across Sherlock's body, catching in the droplets of water on his chest.
"I just need to check if I got the height right. We need to get you mobile as soon as possible. It's too dangerous to have you laid up." John was still grinning at him.
John was true to his word. Sherlock didn't see the glen until he was almost at the edge of it. John showed him the way down into the glen. The trees closed around them. There was a little clearing next to a spring at the bottom.  John pushed dry leaves into a pile on the clearing, one end higher than the other. He took off his cloak and draped it over the leaves. He led Sherlock to the makeshift mattress and helped him sit down. He put fresh water from the spring into their water skins and brought Sherlock's to him.
The man was watching. John didn’t remember him boarding. Surely he would have noticed him. He stood at the other end of the carriage, one arm raised to hold a rail. Jet-black hair fell in thick waves around his angular face, just brushing his shoulders. He was all in black - expensive-looking suit, shirt, long coat - with the exception of the crimson silk scarf artfully draped around his long neck.
Sherlock had turned his head so it rested against his upper arm. His eyes were closed and his mouth was open as he gasped for breath. He'd surrendered to John
When Sherlock had finished and sagged limply against the wall, John sat back. He was desperately aroused and trembling. Then Sherlock was pulling him up, back onto his feet. Sherlock pushed John backward until he dropped down onto the couch.
John snickered. His eyes were wet. "Go on to the house, then. I'll put your horse up. And I'll milk the cow while I'm there. Supper's on the table."
Sherlock flopped back down. He reached across John to capture his left hand, weaving their fingers together. "I'm completely serious, John. I'd never seen anything sexier. It's a wonder I survived, really."
"But did I hurt you, Honey? I didn't mean to fall on you." He pushed Sherlock's hair back from his forehead.
Sherlock draped an arm around John's shoulders. John's hands were stroking Sherlock's sides as his mouth began to move over Sherlock's chest and stomach again. "I have wanted you so badly for so long," John whispered against Sherlock's body. Sherlock's head fell back against the door again.
"Well, then I promise to never ask you to 'play a tune.'" John broke into a grin. "I know what it's like to get the same awkward responses every time people find out what you do. I bet you've never had someone drop their pants in the middle of a dinner party and ask you to diagnose the frankly terrifying growth on their ass."
Sherlock stretched his body over John's, holding himself up on his arms, one on either side of John's head. "You said I'm like an angel when I play. You want to
John looked into Sherlock's eyes for another moment, searching for any sign of deception. When he found none, he smiled back shyly. He turned and made his way to the bed. Sherlock followed. John sat down. He lifted his eyes to Sherlock's again.
John took Sherlock's hand in both of his. "Sherlock, two weeks ago you asked me to think through what I want. I have. And what I want is
He scanned behind the bar to see which member of the staff looked like they’d been hit by a lorry. There he was, standing uselessly in a puddle of liquor and broken glass. John made eye contact and watched in satisfaction as the man’s chest rose dramatically with a deep gasp.
