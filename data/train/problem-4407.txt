"I'm a fucking traitor to a man I'm marrying soon." He hadn't admitted it, but Michael didn't smell right he didn't smell bad but he certainly didn't smell right.
Dean let out a small whine and frowned because he wanted to growl but it was true. He was nervous and honestly scared.
Sam's eyes widened and he steadied his cup before it fell over, but Michael and Raphael's cups did indeed spill.
Michael looked back where Raphael had halted his assualt. Chest heaving and eyes rimmed with furious Alpha red
"So am I." Gabriel smirked a little "Charlie, the maid is covering for me. If my father asks around I've requested to be left alone in my room as I'm feeling a little ill from the excitement of the last week. Take care of Deano and keep an eye on Cassie alright?"
"You certainly smell wonderful little Prince. I'm sure those ropes aren't comfortable as you're trying to hold off your heat. Silly Omega," another few gentle pats of his cheek "Just get it over with."
"He did no such thing!" Castiel roared the sarcastic joke lost in the air as Dean's arm was shifted a little higher behind his back. The Hunter let out a hiss as pain shot through his shoulder but said nothing "I'm here to make it right Dean."
Gabriel paused outside a set of beautifully carved light wood, marble and silver doors, as was the theme of most of the castle.
"I wish your way was possible. I'm just so bored with her, Gabe. It's whacky how little she has to contribute to a proper conversation." Cas groaned
It was electrifying and intoxicating. Cas wanted nothing more than to drown in those eyes for eternity.
The four remaining Princes of Heaven stood before their Kingdom, with heavy hearts. Before them lay the casket of their fallen brother Raphael, an angel that had foolishly betrayed his family, making them suffer terribly for it.
Pulling out the letter he began to read and his wings drooped slightly before positioning back to a normal relaxed but ready state.
Dean had just finished breakfast with Michael and his brothers, it had been quiet, and awkward until Gabriel flung a grape at Castiel causing him to growl and throw one back. Balthazar had laughed and tried to stay out of it until Gabriel threw a hard boiled egg at him and it landed in his drink, splashing orange juice over his shirt. Of course then Balthazar threw some cheese back at Gabriel, missed and hit Michael right in the nose, what happened next Dean had not expected.
"Lucifer? What is wrong?" The Omega asked in a quiet whisper, nose twitching as she could smell how distressed, sorrowful and empty his scent was
"If you don't want to hurt me. Let me leave. Let me go home." Dean hissed a glare coming to his face "Keeping me here may not be hurting me physically, but it still hurts to be away from my brother and husband!"
The Ministers wings were trembling as he shook, stepping forward he cleared his throat, going through the official coronation ritual.
His voice croaked with lack of use as he looked around the little Cabin he and their precious leader had shared.
Dean had nothing against what most called 'His Kind' really he had high respect and only ever treated Omegas well.
"Michael?" Lucifer asked worry Lacing his voice as he looked around almost expecting danger to be chasing the Other Alpha.
"Gabe, it's not that easy and you know it. As much as you are right, as much as--" he struggled to actually say it out loud, even though all his brothers knew.
Dean bit back a whimper as he heard the door scrape open and the sound of heels clack up and stop in front of him.
"Ok. So you're a Cas, but not our Cas. Explain scar face." Dean quipped, green gaze looking the Angel over. He looked and sounded like Cas, but he had a scar over one of his eyes, over the side of his mouth, his tan trenchcoat replaced by a black look alike, shirt was black also. He was almost Cas, but the haunted expression in this Angel's eyes was much different than the haunted expression Dean had grown accustomed to, in the eyes of his Castiel
"We needed something else heavy!" Castiel's gravel filled voice called from behind the wall made of cotton
Chuck was done interfering. If Raphael had a problem with his brother and future King, then they needed to take care if it themselves.
"Listen, Cassie, everything is under control. Like you said, we got a hand in one of the largest banks. Half of our industry now has a solid cover." The blond leaned forward, arms rested over his knees as he clasped his hands together.
Dean paused a moment. He wasn't sure what his favorite color was... He had reasons for liking all kinds of colors, but one color seemed to be front and center in his mind.
John remained calm even though his tone was flat and cold. Everyone knew he was keeping a growl back.
The thought alone made Lucifer even angrier then when he started the day. He already had barely seen his best friend since they arrived home, now he had to deal with the realization that there was no stopping this wedding, the planners and florists, caterers and tailors were arriving tomorrow  and Michael was as good has hitched.
"Is he alright? He was rather angry  when I told him of Dean's disappearance, and then I only made matters worse by treating him like a child." Michael explained as he ran a hand through his hair, his gold crown in his free hand, feathers unkept
Lucifer Novak, known discreetly as 'The Devil' in newspapers, leaned back in his chair. He looked up at his baby brother, the distress in his brother's eyes and seriousness of his voice did not go unnoticed.
They were what was important right now. They would be burying their brother in a few moments, they would have to give some gravesite speech, or listen to others drone on about their dearly departed.
"I don't know. I get fired from a lot of things... Something about not being a proper lady." The beta huffed looking up timidly st Michael
"Benny-" Dean's voice tampered into a whisper, lulling the necklace out he gripped the smooth pendant in his hand, pressing a kiss to it as a tear slipped down his cheek "I can't go through with this.I thought I could pretend. I thought I could force myself to go through with the wedding, with ensuring peace, but it hurts. It fucking hurts so damn much, it's hurting Me, it's hurting Castiel, it's destroying Michael, and Lucifer when he's here can barely stand to look at me. We need to stop this."
"It's with great joy I announce that today we venture homeward! While I know we lost many, some fathers, mothers, sons or daughters, we will hold them dear to our hearts and show our people across the nation of Heaven that they did not die in vain! They sacrificed their lives for the freedom of Angels! Those of you who are breathing, rejoice in the life you kept!"
"Just kick his ass already Michael!" Dean called down from the stand. The Omega's face was distraught as he leaned over the edge of the railing. Lucifer pulled Dean back and whispered something to him to which Dean nodded and frowned.
"A discussion? Do all your discussions end in shattered glass and broken furniture?!" Michael raised his voice just a little, not meaning to sound angry, he was just so concerned for Dean. His future mate was still young, and had undergone some of the worst experiences anyone could go through
"It's beautiful really." Dean gave the Alpha a small smile. Really marrying Michael couldn't be so bad right? They had already shared a somewhat intimate moment, what was a lifetime of them?
Dean didn't even look at Raphael at all but motioned for Michael to come closer. The Alpha did, as Dean reached down, took his face gently in his hands and leaned forward to place a kiss on the Crowned Prince's forehead.
The older Winchester kept his eyes trained on the ground, staring at Michael's well polished brown boots, not saying a word.
Dean blinked several times and shook his head, regretfully swinging his legs over the side of the bed and slipping his bare feet into his slipper, pulling the blanket more around him Protectively
The Beta demon smiled down at Lucifer from her place and handed him her passport. Proving she was who she said she was and that she was indeed a tailor, or technically a seamstress.
Dean followed the angel into the room, the room was large and opened into a cozy living area, a fireplace, large couch and a couple of comfortable chairs, a fuzzy rug and glass coffee table sat in the middle of room. Very cozy and relaxing.
As Spring arrived Heaven was no longer at war with the Kingdom of Hell, the King had declared a surrender after Heaven threatened to call for the aide of the Forces of Purgatory.
His eyes stayed straight ahead as all kinds of people watched him, the smell of so many people and their false smelling perfumes made his eyes water, his nose itch. The prince hated it.
As they began to enter their carriages Dean couldn't help but linger, looking over his shoulder one last time as Michael swayed on his feet a little in the heavy rain. They were the last carriage to pull away, and as they Did, Dean looked back out the window and watched as Michael fell to his knees with a look of such raw pain on his face that it made the Omega Prince's eyes grow wet with tears.
Even though the young Alpha was taller then he was, Gabriel still pulled Castiel into his lap and wrapped his four gold wings around Castiel and his wings of deep space black.
The sky was beautiful and the moon was bright, the waves lazily nipped at the sand like a teasing lover, the moon reflecting over the earth made the water and sand shimmer beautifully.
"I don't know how I feel." The young Angel explained with exasperation "It was merely hours after I got his sent I went mad into the worst rut since puberty!"
Raphael's scent was so strong with anger that the eucalyptus and wintergreen scent stung Michael's nose, making his eyes water. This battle was dragging on and Michael needed it to end.
"Don't/ ever/ call me that Dean." Castiel's voice was deep and calm, he gripped Dean's bare arms tightly as he looked into Dean's eyes with emotions neither Prince dared to name
"Hush now." Michael muttered "Let's get you taken care of now that things are-" his voice dropped off as he turned his head, taking in the scene before him. "We should get everyone taken care of." He whispered noticing Castiel move his wings to envelope himself and Dean away from the world. He was happy for them, really.
"Regardless you are in succession to be King. It is only polite to bow to you young Winchester." Castiel continued as he shifted his weight, his arms at his sides awkwardly
"Potty training?" Dean repeated looking up between the two from where he sat. "Garth, Bess just found out she's pregnant. Potty training ain't for a while. Right now focus on helping her deal with morning sickness and nasty ass cravings." Dean stood, wiping his hands on an already greasy rag
"Let me go with you. To find the Witch." Sam took a step forward and Gabriel shook his head. Wings hidden under a dark cloak, a tall angel with brown wings took a step towards the two, his hand at a sword on his hip
He had to be untouchable and unwatchable. Invincible or things could go south and end with the blood of his children on his hands.
"Alright, Dean, I'm sorry. This is my request to you as a King. It's for Michael's own good. You're to marry him as soon as you're presentable to the public anyway. No one but us and him in the end will even know that you two have been together. Just do as I request." Chuck pleaded his wings dropping
Dean snorted as he laughed, the baker showing them his cakes gave him a near offended look that made Dean cough behind his hand and quietly apologized.
But he barely saw his father all day, one or both of them would get pulled away for various things and it was starting to really pass the Omega off.
Shaking hands found the pill bottle in the nightstand, and took a palm full with another gulp of a new beer, trembling fingers carefully lit another joint and brought, what he wished was relief, to his lips. He used to find relief in these things, something to keep his mind numb of anything other than survival and Dean.
Ah, there it was... so Dean wasn't gay. Calling a man a gunsel was the equivalent to calling a woman a bitch. Though he figured Dean wasn't actually meaning it, perhaps even just going with what was socially acceptable, Mike knew if Dean was actually a homosexual, he wouldn't dare use that word. The faintest hint of a blush that had started to form on Mike's cheeks swiftly disappeared as he got the evidence for what he had assumed all along. And that was perfectly fine.
"I'm not very hungry right now.. But thank you for the invitation Ma'am." Sam smiled as Kelly hummed quietly to herself. Sam's eyes fell back on Michael, the young Alpha was trying not to stare, but Michael was so, broken looking in this moment, his scent soured with sorrow and grief.
"I'm going to order pizza!" Cas nearly shouted and pushed passed Dean to get out of the tent. Effectively knocking the old hunter over onto the pillows that lined the floor of the tent.
"She's yay tall," Dean took a deep breath and lifted his hand "Alpha, smells like Roses and... Sulphur. Roses and sulpher. Red hair, eyes full of hate, green-brown eyes." Dean finished and Lucifer took off to find the bitch.
"We won't grow to love eachother because he loves someone else! He loves someone else and so do I! But we can't be happy and we can't change it and I don't know what to do. Dad I'm lost." Dean muttered through his tears, before Deam could expound further he was pulled into a tight embrace by John, both Winchester's held eachother tightly, neither saying another word
"Just worrying about Dean is all." Sam replied closing the heavy old book in his lap. His nose twitched as he looked up at Gabriel with a pensive stare "Are you alright? Did That Demon corner you? You have his sulfer smell lingering." Sam's own scent became defensive and before he could say anything else Gabriel shook his head
"Come on guys. Emma your Mom is gonna be pissed and then Grandpa Bobby is gonna give Daddy a fucking earful for being late to work"
The Omega focused on breathing, in, and out. In, and out, but it didn't stop the visible flinch the Prince had when the voice started so very close to his face
John turned his head at the sound of horses. Gave the Crowned Prince a little head nod and followed his son inside. Once in the doors Chuck was already there and scooping John and Kate off, not even giving Dean a moment to speak.
When the boy had run off Castiel sighed and mounted his horse. He needed to remain calm and in control. He needed to know his place, he was not Dean's mate, or even a possible mate for the Omega, he was the Prince's soon to be brother in law.
"Stand down Raphael!" Michael roared, pupils slits, the icy color seemingly glowing. The Alpha Prince's scent was tainted with anger, burnt cinnamon accompanied with rage clashed with Raphael's angry and sharp Wintergreen and Eucalyptus. Filling the little battlefield with the clashing scent of Alphas, and making the Omegas in the crowd shrink towards the back and exits.
"You would be impressed if I got myself one of the beautiful cars that sits beside my brother here." He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder to the sleek black car.
Michael turned and watched as Dean came down the aisle on his father's arm. He would be lying if he said Dean did not look beautiful, but he also did not look comfortable, confident, or anything like the real Dean Michael had grown to be close to. This Dean put in a false confidence, but there was fear in his eyes as he forced them to stay straight ahead on the alter.
Dean didn't look up from the water but moved his boots behind him, fixed his rolled up pant legs and let out a little hum of acknowledgement.
Castiel didn't look up from the paperwork as he responded with a gravel filled "I hit a telephone pole in an attempt to not hit a dog."
This Dean Winchester is under my protection. I am Castiel, Angel of the Lord. I am the one that gripped this bright soul from the Pits of Hell, I am the one that has faught alongside and Protected the Righteous Man, I am the one that Bears his name proudly and rebelled against the forces of Heaven, Hell, Death, and God Himself. You, you are a pathetic excuse of a being to call this beautiful soul your own." Cas declared taking a defensive stance as the angel in the black trenchcoat charged him.
"Kick his ass Michael. I won't be wed to a sexist cruel pig." Dean whispered in the Archangel's ear as he cast a sideways glance to Raphael with a sneer.
Being with Michael would strip the Prince of his crown, which by the way was being threatened because someone even simply suspected that there were feelings between the two.
"Because Cas, it was fucking December and we were told this apartment had working AC." Dean confessed as he wiped the sweat drop from his lovers nose
Michael's nose twitched as she walked past him, maybe it was his imagination, his stress over Dean's situation that had come to light, but the maid Kelly Kline had something different about her scent and it drove Michael up the walls.
Dean popped straight up with a gasp, green eyes wide, hands shaking as his head whipped every which way to get a look at his surroundings through the haze of sleep in his eyes
Padding over to his bed he quickly got all of the pillows and blankets situated before climbing into the middle.
Little mini Michael's and mini Dean's running around the castle, some with wings, some without, little princes and princesses... The thought made Michael smile, but shocked him as well. He had never fully thought of settling down. He knew it was coming, he knew a child was expected withing the first two years of he and Dean's marriage, but, part of him was mostly shocked because the image in his head it wasn't he and Dean with a bunch of children.
Michael made the one mistake that had been trained out of him when he was younger, he took his eyes off his attacker for only a second, his icy eyes flicking upward to see Lucifer had moved closer to the railing, his wings stiff in anticipation.
"No, no books this time, even though Lieutenant Singer might hate us for it, I won't let some old detective gum our work just so we did our job the way chapter 59 suggests." he smiled, trying to subtly change the topic. Dean looked a slight bit upset by Singer's comment - but that relationship was to be asked about at a later time.
"You should sit Dean." Dean felt the voice rumble in through his fingers where they were splayed over blood sprinkled armor before be registered what words were actually being spoken
"If it were that easy, do you think I would cross realities to find you?" Castiel hissed, lips brushing Dean's ear
How in the blue hell a family managed to get so deeply rooted and intertwined in the economy of an entire nation was beyond the young former officer. But he had to prove himself. And that was exactly what he was planning to do.
"I told you when we met, when we spoke looking over the ocean, I'm an odd Alpha alright?" Michael gave Dean's shoulder a light squeeze, brushed some of the hair back from Dean's forehead, and placed a gentle to kiss to the Omega's forehead.
"Fine. Fine. What makes you think the Witch can help? Dean and I are marrying for peace between all the Kingdoms not just Heaven and Earth." Michael asked his voice a loud whisper as he watched Sam closely
If Sam was honest Gabriel was his favorite Prince of Heaven. He was easygoing and knew how to lighten a mood, and make someone laugh. But he also was kind and considerate about the things that upset others.
Breakfast went by in a thick blur of near suffocating silence. Nearly the quiet sound of chewing, the small clink of silverware of the occasional scrape of knifes against the glass plates.
Sam gave Dean an apologetic look before shooting a glare to John and storming out of the dining room.
For an Omega raised as an Alpha, Dean was kind and motherly, like an Omega, but built and stubborn like an Alpha.
"I'm not Babysitting you Castiel." Lucifer chuckled in a hushed tone, even with the tiredness starting to show on the Alpha's face Castiel knew Lucifer was alert "I'm simply ensuring no mishaps happen to the young Prince in my charge. I wouldn't want some Omega to lure you away and slaughter you in an alley with your knot out."
"We have tea, and go riding, every Saturday that I am home. Though right now she and her father are on holiday in the cooler regions." Sam explained as Dean tapped his shoulder signaling his little braided crown was finished. The Alpha now had a braid on either side of his head, connecting at the back of his head and held by a loose ribbon Dean had had with him.
"Dean." Michael's voice became heavy with concern, saturated with such worry that it made the freckled Omega wince
Michael reached forward and placed a warm hand on Lucifer's cold cheek, the moon rising high and the stars twinkled
"I am fine Sam." Dean said with the slightest of a smile before his bottom lip stuck out as he fussed over his hair
Dean's body relaxed as his shaking hands came to wrap around his brother's waist and pull him closer, his nose buried in his taller little brother's neck as he breathed in deeply, the sharp scent of pine and leather mixed with fear and relief came in familiar waves as Dean found comfort in Sam's familial scent.
"Get rest little brother." Michael smiled laying Castiel back and covering him with the fur blankets.
Dean put the shirt back on and climbed into the cozy nest he had created, the smell of Castiel lingered on the coat was actually rather comforting.
"Not all of it is strictly work. My tongue is good for more than sweet talking." Dean laughed, tongue resting between his teeth as he smiled "I prefer to call the dames doll or sweet cheeks, Baby is indeed reserved for my precious car." Dean mused as he continued, "As for the gents I'm good at getting from 'em, well, I'm great at acting, and you'd be surprised how many gunsels you run across in some of these swinging places. I can play my part if need be, and I don't mean reckless gunmen." Dean commented, keeping his eyes on the road.
Michael tried to offer the Omega prince a smile, but it felt strained and more like a grimace. Out of the corner of his eyes though the Archangel noticed Castiel's eyes widen like saucers, and his lips part in shock as he watched Dean walk towards the alter.
"I'm going to need an heir eventually but I'm not doing anything with this slut." She growled before smiling at Alistair "Make sure I am provided with an heir. I have things to attend to."
"Where is King Winchester? I'd like to speak to him." Michael piped up as Dean gave the Alpha an odd questioning look
Again Adam nodded in agreement at Sam's statement only making Deam frown and Gabriel laugh rather loudly.
He wasn't ready to settle down. The thought of having children terrified him, moving to a foreign country made his heart stop, the idea of marrying a man ten years older made his stomach churn, the very notion of sharing a heat with an Alpha, well, being knotted and claimed was the lowest thing on his to do list.
Michael focused on the aromatic tea in his hand, his eyes flicked up noticing Kate watching him closely.
Castiel looked at Michael, wings ruffled in an aggressive and challenging manner, his jaw set and Castiel took a challenging stance.
Dean stood and motioned to Charlie who seemed to know what the wave was about as she grabbed Dean and Michael's hats and coats.
The halls, the kitchen, the Prince's bedroom, Michael's bedroom, the library, dining room, throne room and balconies, the gardens and court yard.
Sam's nose twitched as something tickled it, he felt comfortable right now, warm, surrounded by warmth like morning sunlight, and surrounded by the warm smell of spring grass and chocolate, a weight on his chest that he welcomed, long legs tangled with someone else's and the young Alpha felt content for the first time since presenting.
"Behold little Prince, the room known as the Queen's Study." He pushed open the doors wide as he folded his four large wings close to his body and smiled widely.
"If you are challenging him, Raphael than say it and it shall be done. If not take a seat and respect your future King, and your brother." Chuck finally said as he set his fork down as he shot a glare at Raphael
"Don't apologize Dean." Castiel spoke so gently and sincere that Dean had to fight back another wave of tears. He felt so weak and vulnerable right now and it scared him.
"Thank you for your concern baby brother, but leave it be." Was all he added before stalking down the hallway.
"Alright! Alright! I get it." Sam wished he could glare at his older brother, but he knew trying to move when having your hair braided can end painfully.
Blinking a few times Dean nodded, eyes readjusting to the sudden light as Castiel's wings moved back, bringing the Alpha and Omega out of their trance and back to the gruesome reality of the world around them.
"I will take the King and Queen on a small tour, if you boys would spend time with the Prince's? Get acquainted with your future brothers in law!" The small king smiled his graying feathers twitched with excitement on all six wings like gray flowing waves.
Trying to catch his breath Sam pounded on the door in earnest. Chest heaving as the 15 year old put his hands on his legs and leaned forward a little bit, his scent pouring concern and relief.
His silver band of a crown was in his hand, his other hand only kept messing his hair further than the traveling had.
"That doesn't answer my question." Dean bite out setting his jaw to glare at his kidnapper "And if you know me you know I won't die without putting up a fight."
Maybe the war wasn't over. But then again maybe Hell just wanted to make Michael so distracted by stealing his bride that they could swoop in when everyone thought it was over and overthrow the throne. That was not going to fly on Lucifer's watch.
"She should treat you as Royalty since that us what you are." Sam once again shifted his weight and tucked some loose hair behind his ear.
"After breakfast I would like you to pack for a trip to Heaven. You will be escorted by our finest Beta warriors and will arrive before your heat. King Chuck has already assured you a safe place to have the heat away from Alphas and when the heat ends you will meet your future husband."
"Good morning. Come in please." Dean mentioned as he waved them in before going to work on his hair in the mirror.
The Archangel said nothing for a while until suddenly someone touched his arm, without thinking he spun around grabbing the person and slamming them into a delivery cart, one hand holding their arm, the other arm held up under their chin, his wings out in aggression.
No one especially the young Prince Dean had expected the boy to have hot flashes, and experience his first heat at 14.
"No. I'm a Prince actually." Gabriel rolled his eyes, placing the tray on the glass table by the crackling fire
A shuddering sigh escaped the Winchesters lips as he ignored the rest of his battered body and slipped into his night clothes.
"Dean is sad, Sam is sad, Mom and Dad are hiding it but they're a little sad." Adam's voice cracked "And I Don't know why they're sad! They just tell me it's fine, that they're fine and they aren't! Dean is all beat up and hurt! No one tells me why they're sad because I'm just a dumb kid that won't understand! Someone hurt my big brother." Adam's face was twisted in distress and his usually neutral scent that children had was braided with confusion and sadness
But Kelly, Kelly Kline was the light at the end of the tunnel, and she wasn't actually a Train. She was the sunrise after years of darkness, a drink of water to a dying man in the dessert, the first breath of fresh air after being buried, a gentle breeze in the heat, the sun after the rain, the thunder in a storm, the waves along the sand, the flowers in the meadow. To Lucifer Novak Kelly Kline was his reason to move forward, move up, get on top, and to stay alive.
"Michael, I am loyal to you and you alone. I have followed you to the ends if the world, and I will continue to do so, if you asked me to quench the light of the sun into the Sea I will do it. If you request the moon, I will bring it, I will lay down my life for you Michael. I know I can't change the fact you are to Marry Dean, I know I cannot stop the challenge for the crown that was set before you, but know I will lay my life down before I serve another. You own me Michael, my Prince, and my King. You own my life, my soul, and my heart."
The sobbing did not come necessarily quietly, intact they sounded pitiful as they ripped themselves from Michael's throat, shaking shoulders and wings. The moonlight filtered through the curtains and as Michael finally had no tears left to cry he made his way slowly to the window.
"I shouldn't of overreacted Kellie." Lucifer tried to explain to the stable lady. She was the only Omega that Lucifer ever treated properly. Sure he would talk to other Omega's, but all Omega's other than her were just... Omegas.
He had really only remembered this Beta maid bringing him food, making him drink water, and making sure he got cleaned.
With a mumbled good night Michael turned to head down to his own room, he paused outside Castiel's door and felt as if he should knock, but didn't for fear of not wanting to wake him.
"And if I refuse to do this? Do you even realize what it is you are asking me to do? I refuse to do anything to make Michael uncomfortable. He is to be my husband, I am not some whore for you to use." Dean was still so appalled by the very thought that Chuck would ask him to take advantage of and seduce Michael.
"I /don't know/ Charlie. Michael, as my soon to be mate and Alpha, will get to finally determine what I do with the baby." Dean explained taking the broom and sweeping the glass into a pile, ignoring the smear of his hair cream on the tile floor
As the Alpha and Beta came into the Hall Charlie let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding and began to ramble on
"I need to get a search party out immediately. Father needs to be informed, and I just-" Michael looked up as Gabriel's hand rested on his shoulder
Dean had grabbed Michael's sword from his hand, holding it up to meet the Queen's blade. His hands trembled a little with a mixture of rage and fear, permeating his scent, souring the vanilla and burning the leather. A growl erupted from his chest as he used the sword and pushed the woman back out of his space
His name was Michael Cohen, a freshly baked detective for the FBI. He was assigned the Novak's case - an impossible riddle filled with dead ends and several detectives quitting after recovering from sleepless nights and literal torture before him. The entire thing was all speculation, suspicion. The Novak's didn't even exist in the US until last year, but no one could find anything other than the maybes and possiblys from other countries.
As soon as the  pizza arrived, everyone got into their pajamas and piled back into the fort. After a squabble with what movie to watch, and Mary Ellen nearly spilling fruit punch on the pillows, everyone settled in to eat dinner. Of course Miracle pouted, huffed, and whined outside the fort the entire time. Grumpy he wasn't allowed in until everyone had finished. The kids fell asleep half way through 'Meet the Robinsons' so Castiel cleaned up dinner and Dean scooped them up and carried them to Mary Ellen's room and tucked them in.
"Why did someone hurt Dean? Is it because he's not an Alpha or a Beta? Is it because he's getting married to that Michael guy? Dean is the most nicest brother in the world! He reads me stories and sings to me and teaches me stuff. He's nicer and stronger than any dumb Alpha or Beta." Adam was practically sobbing at this point
The young Alpha jumped slightly and gasped out a breath as he turned to look at his older brother Michael
"My brother is fine." Sam's expression softened, tension releasing from the teen's shoulders "I never got a proper chance to thank you Castiel. For finding Dean, for pulling him out of Hell."
"Gabriel." Castiel muttered again looking at his brother with so many emotions "I want to support Michael, I want to support our father's decision but, it hurts so much." Tears laced Castiel's voice, swallowing the sharp lump in his throat
This whole corruption thing got out of hand. First a salesman or two, then a garage, then two, then three, then an entire company, then an officer. They got noticed by the public, the media and the police. Someone had to die. A first scandal. Now an entire bank and they just barely got away with it. The bank just barely surpassed their media conference with local newspapers without giving away where those thousands upon thousands of dollars came from, it was a bit of a mess that took way too long to dig out of and keep it quiet.
Dean hesitated for only a split second before straightening up and stepping inside. Trying to mask any nervousness he held and push it out of his scent.
He was infact very warm. Dean stayed close and let the large wings envelope him in soft warmth. Letting out a low hum Dean stopped himself, he wouldn't let it develop into a purr. He didn't purr.
"Why is there a ring of socks around the tent?" Dean asked yet another question as he noticed nearly all of he and Castiel's socks of every kind in a circle around the fort.
The sound of metal on metal echoed heavily through the air. The citizens of Heaven were silent, each creature on baited breath waiting to see who would rule them.
"Would be better if I was in my own home, doing I dunno, planning my wedding." He bit out with a low growl that sounded more like a purr followed by a whimper of discomfort as a hand came in contact with his cheek.
Gabriel looked at Castiel when he heard the boy growl and realized his baby brother had snapped at a stable boy.
Lucifer flicked his wings and took a step forward, so many emotions rolled off the Alpha General that it made Alistair both sneeze and tremble
"Well, if she is the one to make this guy settle, I'll know in time. I mean, if Luc can get dizzy with a dame I'm sure I can." Gabriel smiled as he turned the radio up laughing as the swinging notes of saxophones and the deep voice of some man started through the vehicle.
"You marry my brother. But know that a piece of me, a valuable irreplaceable piece of me belongs to you forever."
"Dean." Michael finally broke the heavy silence that had settled between the Alpha and Omega, his voice finally cracked the fog of Dean's mind, but also the empty peace the other Prince had established with his gaze at the Crystal creek, his feet in the cool water, little fish and tadpoles poking at his exposed shins.
"Still dunno why you married a dude named Lucifer. And after all the shit he put you through when y'all were in school." Dean wiped his hands on his pants and smiled at Jack again
"The Omega? Perhaps he's only in his room. Or went for a walk in the gardens, maybe he went to the kitchen." Raphael said logically as he tilted his head. He took a step towards his older brother and placed a hand on Michael's shoulder, his purple wine colored wings shifted a little as he looked at Michael's face
"She went into labor! That's amazing! And about damn time. No offense to Eileen but she was huge y'know?" He laughed and then groaned an 'ouch' when Cas slapped his shoulder
"I am not that naive Lucifer. But I appreciate the concern." The young angel paused and removed the silver band of a crown from his wind tossed hair, eyes cast to the mud on his boots "Do you think we will find him? It has been an entire month."
Michael dropped Sam off at the door to the lad's guest room, gave the young man a bow and headed off to flag down Charlie. He knew Dean was in a fragile state and sending any maid in to clean his room would cause issues for the Omega right now.
"Am I alright?" A bitter chuckle slipped passed Dean's lips "I'm so suck of everyone asking that. I do not grieve over the traitor Raphael. I grieve fro his brothers and the horror he forced them through. If I had been in Michael's position I would have rather fallen upon my own sword than take the life of my brother."
"I know Dean." Sam mumbled into his older brother's shoulder "I'm not going to cry over a dead body..." Sam whispered though he did not shed tears, his voice wavered "We should uh... Give them Space."
Michael scanned the crowd, never fully taking his eyes off of Raphael. The Alpha was concerned when at first he did not see Lucifer, but then he saw his General move from the shadows, standing just behind King Chuck.
He wasn't in love with Dean. But he did consider himself to be Dean's friend at least, the Omega was something else for sure, he wasn't shy, he would fight anyone if the need arose, even Alphas. He was sarcastic and brash. He was the opposite of any Omega that Michael had ever met.
"It's in the old laws. True Mates, it's a profound bond separated not even by the afterlife. It's in your laws that if True Mates can be proven, that it doesn't matter what they're social status, gender, or presentation are, they can be married and mated. Protected by the Laws." Sam stated with a confident look "In addition to that royals are protected by that law as well, as social status means nothing to Fate. The other Kingdoms have to obey the laws. It's one of the few ancient laws all the Kingdoms have shared since the beginning. They also must honor all marital treaties that are not carried out by the True Mates Law." Sam raised an eyebrow at Michael as he watched the older Prince's wheels turn
As night fell Castiel waited patiently, the Impala wasn't back and wouldn't be for quite some time, so the angel explored the bunker a bit.
Balthazar's wings twitched impatiently and the moment the doctor finished the poor beta man was pushed out the door by the sandy blond Prince.
"But she won't con me knowing that baby brother," Gabriel added making sure that he was smart enough to know if she was only after the family money or secrets. "I'll know if she's the same. If she ain't, then, guess it stays flirting, chasing, competition and sex." He winked again before shooting up and shoving his hands in his pockets, rocking on his heels.
Sam and Gabriel moved out of the way as the newly proclaimed King fell to his knees with a thud infront of Lucifer, to engrossed in the scene before them to noticed the glowing red connecting the two of them. The general huffed a painful laugh, blood trickling from his lips as hs weakly took Michael's hand
"I've searched for you Dean. You may not be my Dean Winchester, but you're like him. You like pie yes? Your brother Sam and mother Mary? You like Batman and Hatchet Man, Dr Sexy and your 1967 Chevy Impala your father gave to you. That car is more your home than any four walls could be, even with the safety and stability of the Men of Letters Bunker, Baby will always be your home, a safe place to run to if things go wrong. You enjoy beer, pool, and a good time. You're a cat person despite your minor allergy to them, you would love to have a family. Children are a soft spot for you, and if you were granted a normal, safe life, you would want as many of them as you could. You've saved the world, and my life, the life of your brother, and more innocent lives have been saved by you than you could ever count. You put on a strong face, you put on a brave act, but you're a vulnerable little boy that wants the love and affection that he never received growing up, but had to dish out. You spend your days protecting others, but when it's just you, you want to be held and Protected. You want to be assured that everything is ok, that someone has you for once. I KNOW you Dean Winchester. You may be in another world than where I came from, but you are the same as the man I grew to love."
Lucifer's wings twitched and so did his fist. His heart didn't stop shattering as he thought about what he had done. He had pushed Michael away, he had to, Michael was betrothed and it was an act of Kingdoms.
Sam barely moved out of the way as the marble let out a dull thud and loud crack in the quiet hallway.
"I had no choice!" The lamps shattered along with the TV as Castiel's eyes turned white with rage "I can fix it! Come with me." His yelling fell into a near whisper, despair and desperation filling his tone as grace filled eyes watered over with unwashed tears. The sorrowful look reminded Dean so much of his Castiel that he felt his heart lurch with pain. Whatever this Cas had been through, he obviously lost his Dean, they had probably been together since he wore the amulet along with a ring. But Dean wasn't his hunter, and the poor angel needed to understand that.
Dean wasn't afraid of the older Prince anymore, in fact Michael seemed just as nervous about marriage as Dean, but then again... Michael wasn't the one that had to actually carry a pup.
A sorrowful smile came on Michael's face as he looked over what was left of his army. Almost a third of the thousands were left standing.
"I'm sorry my Prince but I came alone. I haven't seen the Omega since this afternoon. But if I see him I'm sure to let you know." She tilted her head as she brushed a stray hair behind her curling horn "You also needn't apologize for the young Castiel's behavior. Young Alphas are always head strong and, passionate." She purred pulling her robe a little tighter and her wings closer to her body
Dean gave Michael's warm hands a tight squeeze and tried to breath, tried to smile, but he couldn't. He felt he was going to cause a scene with his panicking if something didn't happen soon.
"He cut his hand helping me clean up some glass. I got it cleaned and He'll be alright, but Michael..." Charlie met the soon to be King's eyes with a stern look "He has a lot on his mind. I know you're going to he his husband but, but whatever choice he decides, support him. Even if it isn't the one you would choose."
"Michael! You lived! Thank God because I do not want the throne!" Gabriel hugged his brother all four if his gold wings ruffled up in excitement
"You don't know that. You don't want to raise someone else's child. Alpha's don't like raising other people's children. It's some dumb territorial thing in your DNA. You don't want to marry me anymore." Dean whispered blinking a few times to try not to cry again
"Who is it and what the fuck do you want?" He asked sitting up, he pulled warm fuzzy blankets over his shoulders to trap the warmth of his nest to his body
"Oh? I've heard of him, nearly every Alpha wants him. I've seen him to, very pretty... But not very obedient. Humans are disrespectful little creatures, not to mention he was raised as if he was an Alpha... He won't be a very obedient Omega." Lucifer scowled crossing his arms over his armored chest.
Lucifer's Auburn eyes fixed his glare on the girl before jerking his head as signal for her to leave
The Beta Demon simply smiled at the eldest Prince, it was unsettling, Michael found it slightly unnerving but maybe it was simply because he was tired and worried.
"In my experience-" Dean lifted his eyes and his jaw fell open "What the fuck is that ugly ass thing? Thought Soccer Mom SUVs were ugly but... That's a full ass pimp car." Dean laughed slapping the cloth over Benny's chest as the car in question was parked infront of the open garage door, letting the Autumn air in.
"What kind of affairs?" Chuck sat on the edge of a chair as he looked up at his son. Gabriel had always been a mystery, raising him had been nearly a full time job. He tended to terrorize any nannies and teachers they brought in for him. But after Chuck's dear Cassiel passed, Gabriel had matured and helped take such good care of Castiel and little Samandriel, until the youngest had gone missing... Chuck shook his head dismissing that rabbit trail of thoughts "Why would you want to consort with a /witch/ of all people?"
Sam's hand rested heavy and warm on Dean's shoulder, the concern from his younger brother met his nose, the smell of pine smelled wet and uncomfortable. Full of sorrow.
Taking another deep breath Lucirer bounced on his feet a little and rang the doorbell, removing his hat and hiding it to his chest as he waited for his spitfire to open the door.
"Whatever. Go to sleep." With a chuckle Dean slapped a hand over Castiel's eyes and the Angel wrinkled up his face
"I need to put together four search parties. One will scour each direction. We will also most likely need to send word to the Omega's Father as he belongs to his father still until the wedding." Lucifer explained after he rose from bowing.
"Than I shall take you back to your room." Castiel whispered and Dean could nearly feel the shattering of the other Prince's heart under his hand.
"Hope you got your dancing shoes on sweetheart. I didn't forget how you wanted to go dancing again." He smiled widely as he rounded the front of his car and got in. Starting the red vehicle up he pulled out "As for my week, same old same old y'know? Balt Is back from Europe for a few days, We got new partners with the bank you work at. I picked up something special for you day before yesterday, you can have the present in a bit promise." Lucifer winked as they headed for their favorite joint
"H-how much did you overhear?" Dean asked his voice shaking. This was it. This was the end of peace and the start of a war, his future marriage was over, his father would be disappointed and who knows, maybe he'd be hidden away in the woods somewhere to shamefully live out the rest of his miserable days
Gabriel gave Michael a silent thank you as his eldest brother defended him. But seriously all of this was out of hand.
Dean snapped his head to the side and grabbed the hand in his mouth and bite down as hard as he could.
Dean had to almost wipe the drool away as he watched his Angel's back muscles and the way his skin looked with those black wings inked down his back, shoulders and arms.
He didn't have much as to personal belongings in it, a few little trinkets here and there, a few pictures he held dear in the nightstand drawer, his car keys with a giant bee Keychain Dean had gotten him. Some spare clothes he never wore. It was the closet Cas went to, he didn't usually change, but he felt more comfortable clothes would be in order hopefully when Dean came to talk to him, as the Winchester generally did.
Castiel nodded and hurried down the hallway following the smell of rich vanilla and leather, it was so inviting that Castiel stopped himself from drooling over the taste of it.
Dean blinked several times and scrubbed away at the tears with his bruised and scraped open palms. The pain if pushing the bruises on his face he hardly felt, but the pain in his heart and chest at the raw concern for him that came from Castiel made a gasped sob escape Dean's lips.
"I know. But when is the best time to start potty training? How do you know when the child is ready? Is potty as difficult as TV portrays it? Are girls or boys easier to train?" Garth rattled off his questions with a shrug of his shoulders, hands buried deep in his pockets "I want to be prepared"
Dean and Castiel held hands, staring over the ocean a couple of weeks after the failed wedding of Michael and Dean. They weren't married yet, but would be very soon. They decided they would wait until Lucifer was well enough to leave his bed and attend.
"I understand." He spoke simply and finally a tear slipped down the Alpha's face his wings seemed to drop a little, the ends resting in the cool sand
The Winchester sucked in a shuttering breath as he shook his head, running a hand through his hair as the other rested on his stomach for a moment. He was over reacting.
Castiel suppressed a growl as he neared the demon that was going on about how he was innocent and had never even seen the Omega Prince.
"Yes Milady, he is a pretty little thing" Alistair purred beside Dean and it made Dean shift and try to move again.
With a deep breath Lucifer stood shakily to his feet, his armor clinked but he couldn't quite hear it, he had a balcony as nearly every bedroom in this castle did, upon stepping out onto it the cold night air whipped his hair and blew through his feathers, there was no beach on this side of the castle, as that view was on the royal family side of the building.
Gabriel put a hand to his chest in mock offense "Brother dear I thought you would think higher of me." He winked stepping out of the vehicle he noticed the nice sleek Auburn boattail and let out a low whistle
Chuck sighed rubbing a hand down his face as he searched for how to word this to get Dean to do as he wanted without causing an issue
Dean was taken aback by this question. It didn't matter did it? There's nothing that could change this arrangement, Michael wasn't that bad either, he and Dean actually got along pretty well.
"Women must feel pretty left out if you reserve that pet name for your car." the grey-eyed detective teased with a chuckle.
"You in a gown." The Alpha laughed as Lilith suddenly grabbed his lowest wing and pulled it out to measure. Michael let out a high pitched Yelp and flinched away
"But onto serious matters and why I came to find you. There is a mess in Dean's room that needs to he cleaned. I felt he wouldn't want anyone else to clean it up."
Dean burst into the office, happy to be in a place with moving cool air, nothing like the humidity of the late summer New Orleans air outside. The Winchester gave a little nod, wink and tipped his hat to the lady secretary at the front desk, she giggled and hid her lipstick smile behind a delicately manicured hand before turning back to the large phone on her desk. Strutting through, Dean didn't bother to pay anyone else mind. He just wanted to know why the hell his uncle was giving him a partner. So his last one had quit, said Dean was too overbearing and while he solved the cases he was given, was too immature to be paired with the older man. Dean couldn't give less shit. The guy he had been paired with, just didn't like the crowd Dean danced with, and didn't like that Dean got all the attention from the dames in any joint they swung into.
"Either attack me or lay down your sword Michael. You're a coward." Raphael hissed as he tried to catch his breath
Eventually, Cas set down his glass and reopened his books. He had promised to not mess up the balances even though they had to leave Italy.
"You can't what? Tell Dad and Michael? I'll be there with you. We'll do it together." Sam said quickly searching his brother's face for what he had no idea
With a shudder the Winchester crawled back into bed and burrowed into his nest, of course it wasn't perfect anymore, the pillows had been moved when he woke up, the blankets weren't warm anymore and the smell of Chuck's anger lingered in the room, making the smell of the fireplace and clean sheets.
"I appreciate what you are doing for your people, our people." Kate began as she placed her hands on the railing "It wasn't an easy decision for John to make. But it needed to be done."
"We were almost married Dean, formalities mean nothing to me when it comes to friends and family." Michael added taking a seat beside Lucifer, watching the blonde's face for any sign of discomfort
Dean groaned as he rolled over. Peeking a vibrant and slightly glowing green eyes open at the sound of the door creaking
"No." Michael lied as his gaze hardened "Why do you ask." He stated it rather than ask as he knew where Raphael stood. Raphael was the Alpha Archangel directly below himself. It was no secret he did not agree with Michael ascending to the throne, in fact he made it well known that he should be on the throne instead.
The smell fo anger came off Sam and John in nauseating waves that made the Omega Prince want to curl up and die.
"It's a pleasure to meet you my dear Omega Prince." She kissed his hand and Dean couldn't help but feel majorly uncomfortable.
"Michael-" He whispered, voice dying off as Abaddon kicked Lucifer onto his back, pressing her neat black heeled foot onto his chest, bending down and pulling the to tight muzzle from the General's mouth
"He's fine. Dealing with everything." Chuck spoke pulling a chair away from the desk and sitting in It. Wings dropping as he hung his head and thought about how to word this
Dean let out a startled yip as suddenly something was put over his eyes and a blindfold was tied behind his head. The burning smell of the Alpha was so close and Dean had to fight the urge to lean towards it, instead a rather undignified whimper clawed out of his throat as the scent and heat of Alistair moved away from behind him.
"Nah I'm just being dramatic because I'm uncomfortable." Dean muttered stepping over and sitting beside Cas, he ran his hand through Castiel's hair and made some fake gagging noise as he wiped Sweat from his Angel's forehead "How can you even be wearing a shirt right now? It's hotter than Hell in here."
Alphas weren't with other Alphas, offspring couldn't be produced, likewise Omegas were never with other Omegas, not when they were often married off to Alphas and Betas.
Castiel blinked several times behind his thick black glasses that reminded Dean of your stereotypical nerd type.
Dean cracked his eyes open and lifted his head slowly, he didn't want a repeat of the sudden pain and nausea caused by him whipping his head around.
Dean let out a small huff and shook his head letting out a chuckle as he looked down at the tumbling waves
Castiel smiled softly as Dean stared at their chests, the red light of the short string illuminating the darkened space as Castiel's dark wings canopied them away from the commotion.
"One at least does. That's the trip I'm going on after the funeral tomorrow. My father may have had them hunted down and executed but I have on good authority one still lives. Off on an island a days journey from the Capital. From here."
Gurgling around blood, tears in her eyes, red hair a fiery mess around her face, the black faded from her eyes as she looked up at Dean.
Neither Prince said anything for a long while, they simply sat there, Dean's hand on Michael's cheek, Michael's hands limp in his lap, wings trembling as both of them silently cried, foreheads touching in a display of intimacy though the romantic or sexual implication was gone. Simply two friends, stuck to marry eachother, each had a heart that belonged to someone much less tangible.
As if on que the doors once again swung open with a crash, every head turned in near unison as a tossing sea towards the door.
Upon entering the gates to the castle a huge grin grew on Michael's face as his brothers, Castiel and Balthazar both fluttered down from a balcony they had been talking on.
Vaulting through the window Dean hurried to the edge of the gasping hole, that seemingly swallowed his angel. At the bottom lay two bodies in a crumpled ball of blood, grace, and dark feathers.
"Doing alright. Dean told our father that he was-" Sam's eyes narrowed at Kelly, who simply raised an eyebrow at him "Nervouse about the wedding." Sam changed what he was going to say, not sure if this maid could be trusted with Dean's current situation.
"You, my dear Bitch, are going into heat. You'll be begging me to do something to you by morning." Alistair hissed.
He left his bathroom door open so he could hear what his brothers had to say and watched them both closely in the mirror.
His whole head throbbed with the sudden movement, a sharp pain jolted down his spin and his vision blurred and swam around, he could feel his heart in his ears and quickly closed his eyes with a long groan.
"Alright Cas. We'll see you at Dinner." Dean forced a tiny soft smile to tug the corners of his mouth
"Lucifer and I? Close enough... It isn't what you think." Kelly assured him as she watched her future king collapse in an uncomfortable wood chair. This was the side of Michael she had only heard Lucifer speak of. The one that was just a man, just a boy that wanted what was best for his family and his people. Just a man with to much weighing him down. That was how Kelly knew he would be a great king.
"I can play with Uncle Sammy?" He asked pointing in the window of Bobby’s shop where his uncle Sam was talking
"No need Dean." Castiel kept his hand on Dean's cheek and wiped his thumb over a tear that slipped down the other man's cheek "You don't need to say anything at all." The Alpha spoke softly and his eyes watered a little.
It seemed so dark in the cold morning, but also on the verge of turning a fascinating and lively blue. So many emotions seemed to roll in those waves and against the black of the rocks and the white of the soon to be melting frost Dean couldn't help but compare them to a younger Alpha Prince's eyes, the Omega pushed aside the pang of guilt at thinking that with his future husband beside him, forcing himself to think it was simple fascination at never seeing such a color.
"Than don't Dean." Sam released Dean's shoulders as the door opened again. Without looking at the door Dean hissed out
With Chuck behind bars for the rest of his life, the Kingdoms were at peace and beginning to thrive, Hell was on the verge of a Civil War as people murmured about the scandal for the throne between Crowley and the now deceased Abaddon, but overall everything was going well.
Castiel stood, taking one step towards Dean before the front door burst open, blasting off its hinges windows shattered. Standing in the doorway was Dean's Cas. Eyes ablaze with the wrath of God, angel blade at the ready. The sillhoute of his wings stretched proudly behind him as his eyes glowed, halo mixing with the flashing lightening behind him.
Gabriel stopped in front of the door he had been looking for, an undecorated door, as were all the doors, but the simple white lettering reading the Angel's name and rank;
"How hard it is depends on the kid. Emma, was really easy, Ben was more difficult but he's out of pull-ups even at night now. Sammy was semi difficult but-"
Both Prince's sat in silence for a very long time. Castiel's wings pulled Dean closer as the two breathed the same warm air, noses so close to eachother they were brushing slightly. Castiel watched as Dean's light nearly blond lashes brushed his freckled cheeks everytime he blinked, and Dean couldn't stop staring at the way Castiel's eyes scanned his face as if searching for something unknown but only to the Alpha.
Sam looked up from his plate, tucked a stray strand of hair behind his ear and with a spiteful glower returned Raphael's venom
Alistair chuckled a deep sinister kind of chuckle. It made Dean freeze and his breath hitched, his heart stopped for a second and it sent a freezing cold shiver straight down his spin, filled his scent and mind with fear. The word danger rocketing through his mind. Tearing at the seems and he felt the urge to get away stronger than he did before.
Michael didn't know how long he stayed at his brother's graveside. When he lifted his head, heavy with rain, wings shivering and dripping, the entire sky was a tumbling black, the rain never ceasing its heavy assault on the Prince. The tears long gone from his icy eyes, washed away by the rain that matted his hair to his forehead. With trembling hands the Prince stood, removed the crown from his head with a solemn expression
"Dean I'm so happy you're home and safe." John mumbled into his eldest son's neck with a softness to his voice that was rare for public settings.
Castiel held onto his horses reigns and watched as Dean was swiftly taken inside. His heart pounded as the urge to run to the Omega, to hold him close, pet his head, kiss his hair, and keep him away from the world roared through his body.
Gabriel stared at Crowley for a few moments trying to wrap his head around how easily the Fallen King had told him where this Rowena the Witch was. Feeling it unwise to press the Alpha on his true intentions for supposedly righting wrongs, the golden feathers Archangel bowed with a small thank you and hurried off.
Castiel was at a loss what to do and suddenly Dean felt warm arms and fluffy wings around him. Dean was pressed to the Angel's chest and his wings to rival the night sky were wrapped around him.
Dean still was winning as he pelted the various food at Michael, the Alpha finally, out of breath, admitted defeat and surrendered.
Gabriel sat behind him and began the process of smoothing the dark fluff down and petting his brother's wings in a soothing and comforting kind of gesture.
"Your Highness!?" A maid called and Gabriel beckoned them in as he quickly stood up and shook his wings out
"Will it be dangerous? This Witch, will she even be out there? Where you pointed to the other day. Will she be there?" Sam pulled his cloak a little tighter around his shoulders, the sea breeze whipping his hair around, the young Prince's eyebrows were bunched together in worry
"It won't." Cas repeated as he blinked a few times, Lucifer was heard commanding different small groups in which directions they would go. Time was of the essence and the Prince had been missing since early evening of the day prior. Now they were up nice and early and were going to find the Prince, and bring him home.
"I said. Shut up!" Gabriel snapped his voice rising a little "I've come to you for help, willing to make a deal and you do nothing but belittle me and speak of scandel." Gabriel hissed, anger souring his grassy scent "Show another Royal a little respect." He spat hands pulled into tight fists where they rested on his lap, wings tensing and rising up a little bit.
"Give him Time Sam. He'll see he's safe and he will heal. The only thing we can do for him right now is be there."
Dean peeked over the frame of the shattered window from where he hid in the room, a large crater had been punched into the parking lot. Car alarms blared, street lamps were shattered, trees uprooted, bits of asphalt lay everywhere on fire. The rain doing nothing to put it out as another round of thunder and lightning strikes.
Gabriel's wings shifted one or two long gold feathers shook loose, Sam watched them flutter to the marble floor.
"You're going to get them stuck like that. You're also stinking up the courtyard with distress. You smell like your mate died." Gabriel smirked even though his eyes held understanding
This was one of Lucifer's areas of expertise that Michael highly disapproved of. It came with being raised how the other Archangel had been, but Michael knew that was an excuse. This whole scenario was a damn nightmare.
What would his father say? How would His father react to knowing that his eldest son, the one that refused to be a typical Omega, the son that was built and trained like an Alpha, that was headstrong and bullheaded, had been bred like some animal to a random Demon?
Looking around the hall Dean peeked his head into the kitchen, fresh brownies lay cooling on the stove indicating his husband had at least been there recently, and his car was still in the garage.
"But I had already had my rut two weeks prior. I had two in a month and Dean is the reason for the second." Castiel frowned and dropped his face into his hands "His scent, his smile, they drive me crazy I can never seem to get it out of my head, my nose... His laugh is infectious and I never seem to get it fully from my ears! All green seems to pale in comparison to his eyes, the sun is dimmer without his smile, scents are dull unless it's his. I never knew I fancied the smell of Vanilla mingled with leather until I met Dean." Castiel raised his head from his hands and his eyes were wet, his scent wasn't that of bitter burnt coffee that indicated his anger, instead it was that of watered down coffee and the lingering scent of paper, wet and ripping.
"Don't challenge me little brother. You are not the next King for good reason." Michael growled out his eyes holding a dangerous look to them as his wings rose to meet the challenge
"I'm sorry you're witnessing Raphael's insolence. Please come with me and I will show you the gardens or the libraries."
"All of this. All of this for some heavy ass gold to wear? For an uncomfortable chair to sit in? To hold the lives of countless beings in the palms of your hands? All of this, to hold the word on why and when and where to go to war? To put more people's lives in the dirt? For a little bit of land? More heavy gold? To prove that you can? It all seemed so unlike you brother. You were a man of the people once. What changed?"
Dean was very very surprised when they crossed the border without incident, and when they went through the city without a problem.
Dean turned his attention back to his husband as he hauled him up, apologies like a chant spilling from his lips with every anguished sound of pain that his Cas made
Lucifer was right, though, Cas wasn't getting much sleep as of late, though he wasn't entirely sure why.
His six, pink and blood red wings flapped hard in anger and then spread out fully. Slamming things off of the table and knocking a chair over, hands bawled into fists, knuckles white as his blunt and short nails dug into his palms. The dull sting didn't bother him as the Archangel let out a roar of raw emotion and sorrow, as he slammed his fist into the mirror.
"I did. It was a long and rather uneventful day. My first full day on duty back from the war... Is it sad that I miss the thrill of it? At least compared to how calm and smooth everything seems to be running?"
This news didn't exactly /hurt/ but it certainly was a surprise. Michael's eyes glanced to the bed, covered in pillows and blankets in a nest, then there it was, nestled among the silk sheets was the trenchcoat.
"What is it?" Dean tilted his head, Castiel still didn't look at him but his wings shifted, the feathers moving in a constant nervous abyss
"Don't." Dean growled his eyes opening as he lifted his head to meet Sam's gaze in the mirror reflection "Don't give me that pity shit."
Frankly Dean was surprised that he felt safe around Benny. Alpha's were not something he wanted to be around, except the Novaks, and his brother. He also knew if his father was here he'd be okay with that, but other Alpha's made him nervous the last few days he'd been back.
The Prince took his time getting clean, using the sweet smelling soaps and oils that were tradition for human Omega's to bath in the morning of the wedding. Personally he didn't like them, sure they smelled nice, and they were his mother's before him, but he felt they made him smell wrong, he didn't like the way their scent cloaked his own, though he was now sure his nerves and pregnancy would be fully masked through the soaps he was messaging into his skin and scalp.
"Sam and Jack have retired for the night. It's only us." Cas added this time holding his hand out again for Dean to take.
Another deep sigh as Cas messed up his hair even more - why his brothers were able to keep a hairdo for an entire day was beyond him. Castiel gulped, he hated when his brother went all businessman on him. The way Lucifer could just turn on his anger and dominant behaviour like switching on the light, was terrifying even to close family members. Cas' eyes never left the doorway until their oldest brother was out of sight.
"I told you Dean. I am not making you call me that. Not even in the company of the strictest Kings must you call me Alpha. I am Michael, nothing more." Michael laughed at the end hoping to lighten the mood as he took his own horse. Ths Crowned Prince mounted and Dean did the same without much word.
As the rain thundered and poured, Michael let out a desperate pent up cry of rage, sorrow, and heartache, only heard by the dead, and drowned out by the thunder.
"Thank you Lucifer. But really, they are all enough behind us you needn't be so formal." Michael gave the Knight beside him a small smile
"Maybe. I've barely even seen Sam or Mom or Adam. I saw a glimpse of Castiel earlier as he and Balthazar were pulled away. I heard Gabriel wasn't feeling well so he's not been around. It's just been wedding people, to much cake, and Michael. Not that there's a problem with Michael. We've become really good friends but I can't help but feel everyone is being whisked away from me on purpose." Dean paused and looked at Benny. Crossing his arms the Prince blew out a breath "I'm probably in my own head."
"Are you sure Alpha?" He asked a little uncertainty in his eyes, but all else seemed to be purely Dean, Chin high, shoulders back, riding his horse like he was born riding
"Right now I believe you understand what is happening to your body." Alistair's sleazy voice purred from somewhere behind Dean.
The hunter hesitated but took the hand, as soon as he did the Angel pulled Dean into his chest, running a hand up and down his back and between his now shaking shoulders. The two stood like that for a moment until Dean pulled away, confusion painting his tears stained face as he stared at the shirt the angel was wearing
It was as if some instinctive part of him that was always restless was finally at ease. His mind whispered mate and omega as The Winchester opened his eyes. Squinting as sunlight filtered through curtains, the window opened a little to let the crisp spring air in.
Meanwhile Sam stayed with Gabriel late into the night, they didn't talk about much, Sam was simply company. Which the young Prince didn't mind at all, he enjoyed Gabriel's company. Even if Gabriel didn't know it.
Dean took his seat at the table, across from Michael, who to Dean at least, look exhausted. But the Alpha was doing a wonderful job of hiding it. Perhaps Dean picked up on it because he was Omega, or because he was the same way, or maybe it was because he had seen his father in the same place, or because he was going to marry the angel he didn't know, but he knew Michael hadn't slept a wink last night. Or hardly any night since his disappearance. There were smiles all around the tables and greetings to Dean.
The Human King was also more outraged to hear that Abaddon had been the one to have Dean kidnapped, as she felt the young Prince should have been promised to the ruler of Hell.
"I have ready laid out new clothes and towels. Be fast the seamstress will be here any minute... Heads up though, Lilith is a creepy ass demon bitch that really has no scent except artificial perfume. Regardless she has a cold and rather uncomfortable smile and always these clicky painted nails and to much lipstick. Still her wedding attire is phenomenal. Just a heads up Dean."
This could potentially, if Hell was behind it and not someone else, be a declaration to resume the war they all agreed was done.
"He'll be alright." Gabriel smiled patting Michael's arm "Wanna come in my room? I have hot coco and donuts..." Gabriel smiled up at his older brother
"Fucking a you gotta be kidding me! Son of a bitch!" Dean squinted in the dark and felt his way to the bedroom, Cas heard more loud swearing as Dean stubbed his toe on the leg of the bed, but did find his phone.
Peeking through the window Dean was once again surprised and shocked by the amount of Angels wandering about. Buying, selling, chatting, little Angels with little wings chasing eachother or chasing pets.
When she straightened up and tucked a strand of blonde hair behind one of the horns that curled around and under her ears she turned to Michael.
"Yeah I think we did have the same sergeant, Howlett right? James Howlett... Though he went by Logan for some god awful reason. Him and Barton were real harrasses." Dean chuckled with a shake of his head. "Good to know I'm not working with some old timer that won't get that things don't gotta be straight by the books y'know?" Dean glanced over the top of the newspaper at Michael as he took a seat at his desk, the chair was uncomfortable, obviously used and it creaked and was heavily annoying. Dean had sat in it ten seconds and was ready to throw it out the bureau window.
"Don't do that Castiel. Greet me as a brother." Michael chuckled and noticed his baby brother did not want to meet his gaze "What is wrong?"
"We went to look at the case because a couple had been killed, we ended up losing the other family. It was a couple and their-" Sam swallowed thickly, eyes watering with tears "Their 12 year old daughter died also. We weren't fast enough and the spirit killed her, Dean held her as the spirit-" Sam looked down at his boots "we lost them, but no one else will get hurt now. Dean's not taking it well."
"Gabriel you cannot actually be serious. You don't even know if Crowley can be trusted, but you'll go off this information he gave you? It's rather vague don't you think?" Sam braced one hand splayed over a map, the other fisted over his hip as he stared at the older Prince. Gabriel had to be mad to do this, ludicrous to even think of doing this on his own "Does your farher know? Or Michael? Castiel? Balthazar? Anyone?"
Michael waited after he knocked for his brother to answer. He felt he owed Castiel an apology for his outburst and wanted to explain that he understood that instincts can take over and it's perfectly natural.
Still Dean kept walking hoping he'd recognize a part of the castle or run across Charlie, a gaurd or any of the Princes... Even if it was Balthazar or Raphael.
He had had two wives. Micheal, Gabriel, and Balthazar's mother, then Castiel and Samandriel's mother. It was a mess of things, the circumstances leading to the marriage of Castiel's dear mother Cassiel. He had named Castiel after his mother even. But everything around that time, and around the birth of his youngest, of whom the world was sure was dead, was shrouded in things he rather not think about.
"Alright." Michael wanted to reassure Dean that he didn't need to rush into a decision, that he could take as long as he needed to figure it all out. But he felt the human didn't want further reassurance and soft sympathy.
Dean let his hands rest on Castiel's chest and closed his eyes as he felt the strong and unsure heart beat of the Alpha he was sitting with, wings canopied them in a darkness illuminated only by the slight glow of each other's eyes.
Sam was saying something as he grabbed Dean by the shoulders. Dean shoved him off and shook his head
Michael watched Dean, his face was blank of all emotion as he mounted his horse in thoughtless but instinctual movements. He waited as Michael mounted his own horse before whipping the reins, Impala charged through the woods like a sleek black bullet, leaving Michael in the dust.
Michael's eyes were wide as they fell once again on Lucifer and the Alpha's current state. How, how had that happened? What had happened? The Archangel was pulled from the spiraling onslaught of questions by Dean's grip on his arm, the Omega's short nails digging into his flesh through his black suit
"Now…" the blue-eyed Novak started as Gabe had parked the car. "Let's see what you're capable of. If there's candy on the wall I will hit you with the first best thing I can grab, brother dearest." Cas chuckled, feeling as carefree as he hadn't in a while.
"Watch your mouth boy!" The demon, as Dean could now see raised her hand and slapped the opposite cheek "You are not to speak to your Master like that."
As Gabriel explained his situation with Kali, Cas got up and chose a record he actually liked. No funky swing or jazz. But good old classical music. As he closed his eyes and swayed softly to the music, he crossed the room and sat back down. "Kali sounds like your kind of riddle. Just impossible enough to still be interesting." the moppy-haired man laughed softly, picking his cigarette back up. "But in all seriousness, if she's the one to pin you down, I'd be more than happy to meet the fellow Italian acquaintance of yours. An Indian woman in New Orleans... why's she here?" he asked curiously. "I mean, jumping my brother aside..."
He was tied tightly to a chair, restraints on his wrists, ankles, chest. The demon Alpha before him leaned to close to the Omega's face for comfort and laughed. He wreaked of Alchohol and anger, of Omegas and sweat.
"Castiel enough!" Michael ordered to which Castiel did not listen. The black winged angel took two strides forward, placing himself between Abaddon and Michael "You are responsible for the kidnapping and torture, of Omega Prince, Dean Winchester." Castiel growled as he looked at the Alpha demon in disgust
"Not everyone needs to know right now. But Michael and Dad do. They'll know what your options are. Maybe you could-"
Dean nodded, took a deep breath and began to describe Abaddon. The entire time, the arena was filled with deafening cheering or booing, the sound of metal on metal and thunderous roars from the Alpha
The human stood on the pier for a while watching the boat shrink, Gabriel waved to him, to which Sam gave a hesitated wave in return.
As soon as Dean's boots hit the ground, the Omega looked up quickly at the wonderful scent of old books and coffee beans.
With a deep breath the Angel's deep black wings lowered slightly and the young Prince let his breath out.
"Probably." Benny smiled a little, his smile dropped and his hand grabbed the handle of his sword at the sound of approaching footsteps.
"Let me go! I've never even met royalty before! I'm just a soldier, who served in the war! Same as you man!" The demon hissed and squirmed.
"You don't mean that. Y-you don't actually mean that Dean. I'm the one, I'm the one you're supposed to love!"
Dean only nodded, keeping one hand on Castiel's chest, the other still gripping the demon blood soaked dagger. The freckled and blood splattered Prince simply hummed his response, eyes traveling back to thw demanding Omega Witch that held the entire room in enraptured silence.
Castiel blinked a few more times, his mind not wanting it to fully register. A frown fell on his face as he looked at Dean
"I know. I'm a little brother also, my big brothers pull the same shit-stuff." Castiel corrected himself. But the human that was buried in his side snickered behind his hand
"But I like the scent of chocolate and fresh grass." Sam said with a serious face that only made Gabriel's wings flex as he stared into the other Prince's eyes
Dean shifted his weight from to foot to foot, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, other hand in a fist bouncing off his thigh. The hunter opened his mouth to speak, but thought better of it. His eyes dropped down to the floor as he wasn't sure what he wanted to say, or at least how to say it
The mansion was a good 20 minutes away from the city center, but the buzzing nightlife was another 30 minutes across town. Main street at some point turned into one bar, restaurant and club after the other as soon as banks, shops, the post office and the such were left behind.
An idea struck him, a place that perhaps His beautiful Dean would be. The bunker in Kansas. Of course Dean would be there, probably with Sam, if he was alive, and anyone else that they valued.
They needed to find the Prince as soon as possible. Waiting for the signal, which was a nod and shout from Lucifer, Cas and his squad filed out after the Alpha general.
Please pardon a LOT of odd typos and /this/ on words. I will be going through to edit all the chapters when I finish the story
Kellie in Lucifer's eyes was different. He had met her in his wandering child years and they grew up together. He protected her and that was that. When he had met Michael when they were almost teenagers he had gotten Kellie a job at the stables as he himself became a knight. He felt bad that his friendship with Michael had kind of pushed their friendship aside.
Earth was out of the question. The reason Dean was here in the first place was to bring Earth and Heaven into closer alliance and reinforce armies, through the marriage of he and Dean.
The people would most likely revolt. They would demand to know reasons, details, and would never accept Michael, their future King, with an Alpha. Let alone a none royal Alpha as Lucifer.
Michael knew he would get no answer, no real answer from the man resting inside that decorated box, under the land he once swore to have the best interest in mind.
"You have two weeks to bed him." Chuck spoke seriously and upon Dean opening his mouth to protest once more Chuck held up a hand to stop him "You have the body type of an Alpha, I'm sure it won't be to difficult." The King said this time relaxing, wings shuffled to their relaxed state and his eyes softened
Castiel's head whipped over to the entrance. Eyebrows knit together in a pinched look of concern and confusion as he slightly tilted his head "Hello Dean."
Hours turned to days which soon turned into two weeks, which turned into nearly four months, before they finally found where Dean was.
After Lydia, around the time Emma was turning two he found out his friend Lisa, that he had been om again off again with was also pregnant. Since they were on and off both dating others often they had a test done and Dean, was in fact, the father
"I'll gladly show you you Highness. I'm Charlie by the way." She turned and waited for him to appear beside her
Dean followed Charlie back to his room as the Omega still after a month had a hard time finding his way around the winding white hallways.
"No clue. But Gabriel always told me, there are only two appropriate things to experiment with. Food in the kitchen, and your lover in bed." Cas chuckled and shook his head as he put the lid on "He's a fucking idiot."
Michael sniffed and wiped his cheeks with his hands as he blinked a few times, but the tears kept coming and the hurt just got worse. In addition to all of this there was still the ever present Dean problem.
Castiel was busy talking with Lucifer about the possibility of rain and Dean knew he hadn't heard him
Dean turned around at the sharp smell of his Father and the sweet smell of his step Mother. With a sweet delicate smiled Kate pulled Dean into a tight loving hug.
Michael turned the corner as a panicked looking Dean came at him full force, colliding right with his shoulder, closely followed by Castiel and Gabriel whom looked just as confused as Michael felt.
He was one of Hell's finest interrogators to ever be spawned. He could anyone to do or say anything with the right amount of cuts or burns. Last Lucifer knew the deranged Alpha was given any Omega he wanted in all if Hell to satisfy his wants and keep him happy.
"Don't you 'Barbie Boy' me Mr." Dean shook his head but held the flashlight as Cas examined the contents of the blender "It's mostly crushed I think..." He explained as he poured the mostly slushie looking concoction into two coffee mugs and grabbed a couple of plastic spoons from the drainage rack by the sink
He had to go pick up Kelly, he was taking her to dinner and dancing at a bar that was by one of their more private businesses, owned by some Norwegian runaway that went by Loki. His real name was Thomas Odinson, but that wasn't important, Loki did a good job and that's what mattered. He became the face of the bar after Gabriel had been caught and taken to trial. Gabe the kid the Loki identity even. Lucifer didn't care so long as no one got caught and persecuted for their more illegal activity. Lucifer was actually kinda proud of Gabrielfor taking that precautionand getting a patsy. Regardless, Lucifer liked taking Kelly dancing there. She seemed to love it.
If his fiance decided to keep the child, Michael would help him raise it, if he decided to carry the child and hand it over for adoption, Michael would ensure that the best possible family took the child in, if he decided it was to much and he couldn't do it and abortion washers right way to go, Michael would be with him through the process.
"Yes. I may have, confiscated it from the laundry room about two weeks ago. It's rather comfortable." Castiel responded matter of factly making Dean quirk a smile just a little
"You are not my Master. You will never be my Alpha. S-so get out bitch." He snapped staring into eyes darker black than any demon he had ever met. Her fiery red hair was tied up in a bun and she wore a tight long sleeved floor length silky black dress, her nails long and nicely manicured, horns were small but came out slightly from above her eyes on her forehead.
Michael shook his head, rubbing his sore shoulder as he tried to get his wings to stretched out Regardless of how uncomfortable his minor injury felt
Suddenly it seemed, both angels started falling to the ground, still kicking and clawing at eachother, wings beating and hitting one another. With a loud crach the earth seemed to shake, asphalt from the parking lot shot up everywhere and Dean had to run and duck for cover as debris rained down, crashing into everything and anything.
"Loop holes. I'm fed up with our brothers being torn apart. This kingdom needs a new chapter, and some updated laws." Gabriel's tone hardened with determination as he laid out some of the maps "After the funeral tomorrow, I'm going on a trip for a couple of days. But I need loop holes in our laws first. Enochian mating laws are as old as the sky we fly in, and the stars we worship." Gabriel stated as he opened up one of the books on law "We take tradition, very seriously, laws rarely rarely change." His eyes flickered over the pages as he carefully turned them
"Doesn't matter Sammy. I'm fine now. I'm safe now. I'm here now." He whispered looking down at his hands, the palms were scraped and his knuckles bruised. He blinked a few times and it hurt one of his eyes with how swollen it was.
"Get dressed, and we'll talk more later alright Dean?" Michael spoke snapping Dean out of his troubling thoughts. The human opened his eyes and blinked a few times stepping back from Michael
"I am going to check the guards and knights. Check over the list of wedding planners arriving tomorrow and inform the gate guards to check for credentials before allowing anyone in." The young Alpha straightened up and nodded to his two older brothers before turning the corner and hurrying away.
While Michael wasn't angry, and not exactly hurt that Dean had fallen for Castiel, he was a little shocked that his little brother actually/ went through/ with conducting an affair with Dean.
Michael ran a hand through his dark hair once again and sighed. He really just wanted to maybe go for a walk with Lucifer, talk to the blond Alpha, something. But of course the reasons why he kept licked away. He was engaged to be married Afterall. He didn't need what could never be swirling in his head, the 'what ifs' the 'maybes' the 'one days' no. He was to marry Dean. Who knew, maybe he would grow to love the Omega... Hopefully.
"No one truly Banishes me." She purred stepping around Lucifer and Sam and further into the room "Is that anyway to speak to me Charles?" A frown graced her face
"I'm alright. I'm alright." Dean assured the Alpha with a gentle hand to Castiel's chest, the Angel's beating heart heavy under his fingertips. Dean's eyes met the concern swimming in Castiel's, wishing to drown in those seas forever.
The medic reached for one of Lucifer's wings, his own wings tucked close to his back. The Beta Medic halted suddenly as a threatening growl came from Lucifer's throat, dying out in a bloody cough
"That's the point Angel!" Dean laughed, but his laughing turned into a startled yelp as Castiel flipped them over, straddling Dean's hips as he kept Dean pinned down
Dean shifted his position again to sit cross legged in the chair and began to fuss with his little brother's hair.
"Dean." Castiel's voice was very serious as he looked at Dean "How did you explain where Mary Ellen came from? It's not something she's ready for."
"I can bathe alone I will call if I need assistance." Dean gave Charlie a stiff smile as he gently closed the door behind her. Stripping down and stepping into the relaxing water with a sigh, Dean leaned his head back with closed eyes.
He strutted over to the mantel where Lucifer had left the two filled glasses for the two. Taking them both Gabe handed one to Cas, swirling the other as he looked into it, free hand shoving into his pocket.
Every brother had a preferred car, which made it an unwritten rule not to take 'someone else's' car.
Dean's laughter at something Charlie said quickly died out as his eyes fell on Michael. An uncharacteristic quietness fell over the freckled Winchester as he took his horse, Baby's, reigns from Kelly. Michael frowned and gave a sigh as Charlie appeared very closely beside him.
Chuck nodded again and dismissed his children and their guest. Once the door was closed Chuck looked down the long table to Crowley. The demon was already looking at the King with a curious yet slightly knowing look.
It would of convinced Michael, if Lucifer's voice had not tempered out into a whisper, his face was set in a glare, but Michael noted the tears glossing over the amber eyes of the General.
Howling from the wind against the window only seemed to mimic how Castiel was feeling. Alone. He hadn't felt this completely alone in a long, long time.
"Trying to escape, much how I assume you are." Castiel smiled, it was a slightly strained smile. Most likely because there was so much unsaid between the two Princes. Benny must of sensed as such for he excused himself knowing Dean was safe with the other Alpha.
The smell of blood, of sweat, of aggression, filled Lucifer's nostrils. The Alpha's nose flared, he picked up a scent to his left and swung his head to look at Dean.
The hunter finally turned around, the question of 'What's wrong' on his lips, when he stopped. Friendly greeting gone, expression hardened as he reached for the angel blade that was beside his bag on the motel bed
The Crowned Prince couldn't dwell on it much as he turned to see Dean approaching, laughing and smiling, Charlie by his side and Benny, a human gaurd from John's kingdom Michael wasn't very acquainted with, close behind.
A few moments later the door opened and Lilith peeked her head out, white eyes looking at the two Angels with confusion and her leathery wings twitched. The demon tightened the rob around her and opened the door a little more with the tilt of her head.
"You know what? Why not. If it's only to see the ominous and mysterious Kali you've been drooling over, then so be it."
"Dean Winchester." Castiel's face appeared in the fort entrance "You have been to Purgatory and Hell, seen Lucifer face to face, still think gas station food counts as a date, and took on God himself. I think a 6 year old and a 4 year old, you can handle." Castiel winked and then padded off with the dog.
"You married that, that wealth pathetic excuse for a version of me! I'm the one you should be with!"
"It's because of me is it not? Because they assume you, an Alpha Archangel and Prince, may or may not have feelings for a-a rude, arrogant, selfish Alpha General that was raised in Hell. I am nothing. Whomever challenged you should know that-" Lucifer paused and in a quick instinct that was embedded in his very bones said something irrational and hasty "He should know that the only thing between us is professionalism. If this means I cannot be a friend to you, so be it." Lucifer narrowed his eyes "I hope they know the only feelings I have for you, are Platonic." The words hurt like knives as they left Lucifer's lips.
The drive was a bit relaxing, the radio humming music quietly, window cracked letting the warm and humid summer air over his face helped to cool his anger.
"First Dean being Kidnapped for four months, and then Raphael challenging you. I am proud of you though Michael." Chuck placed a hand on his eldest son's shoulder, looking up into Michael's face
Michael sat on the table, hands in his lap staring at them intently. He was shirtless and bandaged, silent as his icy eyes avoided his brother's
"I agree to this crowning." Eve spoke as her gaurds parted their ring around her to show the woman. Hardly a dark hair out of place from the commotion
He deserved someone that would love him, or grow to love him. Not someone who had fallen in love with their little brother.
The hunt Dean had returned from was one of the few they had that went sideways and unfixable fast. Cas realized now how badly it had gotten to the hunter, the angel just wanted to reach out, touch him, pull him close, kiss his hair, tell him it was okay. "Get out Castiel."
Dean frowned, glaring at Chuck's back, the angel King was on his nerves, and doing a full on tap dance.
"Sure thing Kiddo come on. Grandpa Bobby is gonna be pissed I'm late." Dean laughed shaking his head and walking Ben inside
Michael moved his sword, the fire extinguishing. He didn’t bother wiping the tears from his face, no need when more would surely be shed tonight.
However, once Dean mentioned Barton and Howlett, the frown on Michael's face disappeared only to be replaced by a sincere chuckle and smile to go with it. "I swear those two drove me mad. They always made you feel like such a curve, but if the goal was to fill someone with daylight, Howlett never disappointed." Mike joked, hinting at the very few but very obvious talents the two sergeants had. "Books? Winchester, if there was a book on how to catch a mafia family, I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be sitting here." he chuckled, adjusting his watch and rolling the sleeves of his light grey dress shirt up another bit.
"Thank you Cas." Dean mumbled turning his head into Castiel's chest, breathing in the smell of the girly ass lavender laundry detergent Castiel .ade the boys buy, the warm smell of Castiel and the after scent of gunpowder and sweat that still lingered after a hunt. It felt safe, felt like home. Castiel felt like home, no matter where Dean was, with Sam, Jack and Cas he was home
Once at the bottom of the stairs Castiel had to take a step back and breath slowly. The smell of Dean, of his heat and his distress was so strong, that the Alpha could practically taste vanilla on his tongue. It was so heavy in the air that Castiel vaguely heard Lucifer order their men to stay at the top of the stairs and keep a look out.
Hours ticked by, Sam and Jack eventually ate and retired to bed. Sam exhausted from his hunt, and Jack wanted to watch TV in his room.
As much as the smell of the Alpha on the far side of the room seemed, the only smell Dean actually wanted near him was coffee beans and old paper. It was weird, but that's all Dean wanted. But honestly, the longer he stayed here, with Alistair, the less repulsing the Alpha seemed.
"This way." Gabe mumbled, he tried to pull his hand from Sam's gentle grip, but Sam tightened his hold and shook his head
So that could only mean good things right? But Dean couldn't shake the smell of ocean spray and winter rain from his nose as Castiel stood beside his oldest brother.
What did Lilith mean 'there are bigger plans for you' and why did she give off such an unsettling vibe?
Decided to at least check in his children, as he was a decent father, at least in his mind, he knocked first on Michael's door.
"Ben, I told you to put your shoes on so you can go to Uncle Sammy and Aunt Eileen's until Mommy gets off work" Dean grumbled as the dark haired freckled 4 year old paused his cars and looked up at Dean
Dean released him and wiped his mouth with a hand towel, spitting again into the trash to try and get that vomit taste out of his throat
"But uhm, take me the long way so I'm not seen mkay? Mkay come on." Dean spoke quickly as he slipped out and headed down the hall, Benny close behind.
With a smile he looked at Michael, but the sad look in the Crowned Prince's eyes made that smile slip into a frown
He would live it. It's how Dean would of wanted it right? For him to keep fighting the fight? To save the earth? To do something, anything to make a difference, to save a life.
"It was a pleasure to have this discussion." Chuck added with a smile, his nose twitching eyes flicking to Dean's bed that was flooded with pillows and blankets before he turned and left the room.
The door opened a smidge and Sam without even thinking pushed himself into the room, bursting the door open so that it hit the wall.
When Dean didn't respond Castiel gentle closed the door, releasing a breath his shoulders slumped his steps felt heavy as his dress shoes clicked down the bunker hall into a room the Winchester's had given him a while ago.
The Omega rested his head on Castiel's shoulder and put an arm around his neck as he was carried out of the basement, and out of the farmhouse, set upon Castiel's horse. Dean said nothing but kept a deadpanned expression and his chin held high as the other soldiers fell into line behind Castiel, Lucifer close on his right.
"You can deal with a stuffy nose and watery eyes if it means we don't have to deal with a little girl begging one of us to become pregnant."
The tall young Prince ran down the hall, jumped over someone that he had knocked into and than slammed into the door of Dean's chambers.
Sam opened his mouth to talk again when both Alphas looked up at the sound of the bathroom door opening and Dean came out hesitantly
Dean ignored Gabriel's smug grin and slightly sad eyes. He really did. For two days he ignored it, instead simply enjoying the fact his family was visiting...
"Tell me Dean, what's different?" The Alpha's nose twitched as he held still for his brother "Were you with Castiel last night?"
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"You like attention from an Alpha don't you boy?" Abaddon cooed again pressing a kiss to his forehead, sticky with her lipstick as she then patted his cheek. Her hand slipped from his hair and Dean whimpered, only to blush madly in embarrassment.
"He'll ruin it by not telling her. They always want to know. They always end up making tracks out of sheer fear if they only learn the truth later on. It never works, but who am I to tell a grown man what to do," he sighed, shaking his head in annoyance as he closed the heavy book in front of him with just a bit too much force.
"Let's get you into some proper clothes." The Alpha spoke gently and lowered in wings to appear smaller and less threatening.
So instead he lifted his wings and flew into the air, he spun as he reached the clouds and instead of continuing up he looked down, his eyes narrowing as he spotted where he wanted to go.
Castiel nodded and Michael made a note to his brother's slight change in scent and the subtle way his wings dropped.
With a sigh he wandered around the garden for quite some time just trying to get his mind off of this. To get his heart off of it.
I started this fic on December 18 of 2018, and I now finish, and mark it complete on December 18 of 2020.
"Hey." He huffed out, one arm stayed wrapped around his middle, the other hand gripping Michael's elbow.
"Have I led you to believe that Dean? The last thing I wanted was for you to be ashamed of who you are, the unchangeable parts of you, I never wanted you to be ashamed of that." The Alpha Human's voice cracked as he spoke to his son, heartbroken.
"I'm sure you can find time to talk to him tonight." Benny added keeping himself alert, scanning the bushes, paths and trees for any potential threat
Dean heard the noise and immediately the screams made him flinch. The smell of agression outside his door and the sound of the clamour and chaos sent a chill down his spine and fear into his heart.
"Dean, Sam practically already knows and Jack has asked me about us. Just sleep." Cas whispered Into Dean's hair, rubbing soothing circles into the hunter's back as Dean's breath evened out into sleep.
"Do tell dear Prince! Were you graced with the presence of your future husband? Or of the dashing Castiel?" Charlie asked with eagerness as she sat on the edge of the bed with a mischievous glint in her eyes
He found the four winged angel sitting on a balcony, chewing something with closed eyes, he was talking to Castiel and Dean didn't feel right interrupting... So he ended up just listening.
Dean opened his eyes again and came face to face with the Alpha.  His eyes held nothing but curiosity and something Dean couldn't place, but it made him try to move away.
Chest heaving as his eyes glowing white with rage and grace scanned the parking lot for any sign of Dean, the angel, that beautiful car, something!
"You're right. I heard Lucifer is doing much better and has some movement back in his wings. Rowena is truly doing a good job." Dean remarked turning to look at his Alpha. Which was a way of referring to Castiel that to anyone else made him feel sick, but not with Cas.
Everyone was quiet a moment. Especially Dean who, by now would have been talking all about whatever came to mind and cracking jokes.
Dean smiled gratefully at Charlie and dismissed her to her other duties. He bathed quickly and changed, styled his hair how he liked it and stepped out of his chambers.
Everything going on was just taring the Alpha apart. After a few moments he drew his knees to his chest and his six pure white and shimmering wings wrapped around his body, his face buried in his knees.
But the Angel's thoughts kept going back to Dean. The pain he was in, it wasn't often that it was a child that died on a hunt. Adults sure, but a child? It was common knowledge that the hunter had a soft spot for kids, and for one to die in his arms...
That was when Castiel noticed the elder Winchester had tears down his cheeks "Dean." Cas reached a hand out, took a half step forward, Dean took a half step back
Sitting up the Crowned Prince stretched out his arms and wings, spine letting out a series of gentle pops.
"It is under control, so deep breaths, you look nice Son." John whispered back as the double doors were swung open by guards, everyone stood, and the music began.
After Dean closed and locked his bedroom door, he let out a gasped sob and leaned his head against the door.
The only noise was the trembling shuffle of Lucifer's feathers, and the light hiccups coming from Michael
A throat cleared and both Michael and Dean looked up quickly as Chuck looked at the two with a raised eyebrow and small smirk.
Castiel halted and steadied his horse before he heard Lucifer order the men to the nearest inn for the night. The town was filled with monsters and Angel's and demons. The typical kind of people one would find on the border of Heaven and Hell, with Purgatory only miles away.
The Archangel dropped his sword and fell to his knees from a mixture of sorrow and exhaustion. Reaching forward he closed Raphael's eyes and pulled his brother's bloody body into his arms.
"Speaking of brothers, Kali Darling, this is the runt of the litter Castiel. The baby." Gabriel laughed as he introduced them "Cassie, this is the beautiful Kali, goddess of far away lands!" He sang doing an odd little spin as he hands waved around motioning to her. Much how ladies on TV showed off new cars or grills.
With a groan Dean tried to roll his shoulders, only to discover that his hands were bound. So were his feet, something else was tied around his chest, and he was in a chair. When his emerald gaze finally cleared he focused on the room aroung him it appeared to be a typical barren room with peeling wall paper, carpet under his feet, stained and musty smelling, a bed was tucked in the corner with what looked like fresh sheets and blankets, two lamps stood proudly opposite eachother in corners of the room, a small tv nestled on some stand or desk stacked against the wall, it was on but quiet.
What felt like hours later, Dean was standing in front of a full length mirror, white suit trimmed with silver and lace. It clawed up his throat and along the shoulders of his suit. As traditionally Omega as he allowed them to go without wearing a full on gown.
Dean flicked his brother's ear and sighed "That is all. Do you think I would go to bed with anyone? An Alpha nonetheless? After what I've been through? Sex, dear brother is the farthest thing from my mind! May the Gods be gracious enough to ever make it appealing to me again, it won't be so soon." The older Winchester grumbled and made a point to tug a little to quickly at his younger brother's hair.
"Good night Raphael." Michael stated sternly and narrowed his eyes at his brother, wings lifted slightly.
"Do not threaten me Chuck, you cannot threaten war over something so stupid as your own fear. Accept what was said and call off the wedding. I cannot put my son through more heartache. If he loved Michael, or could love Michael I would continue to allow it. But he's expressed that it only hurts more people for them to marry. Do not tear your own children apart. Haven't you done that enough? You allowed Raphael to challenge Michael and agreed to allow them a duel. What father lits their sons against eachother?"
Michael scoffed, one set of wings stretched up with his arm as he reached it towards the bright and free blue sky
"Kali would be impressed by what?" she asked, an amused smile playing her lips as she walked towards her lover and the stranger next to him.
"And you will be dead now shut the bloodh hell up!" The Demon Alpha hissed eyes flashing red as the demon backed down
Gabriel reached forward and removed the silver band from the nest of dark hair that stuck out ten ways from Monday that Castiel considered hair, and removed his own bronze colored band, setting them both down on a side table
Michael entered the the castle through the servants entrance. He tried to shake off as much water from his wings as he could, but with six drenched wings it was rather hard.
"Michael will understand, Dad will understand- Castiel? What does Castiel have to do with this?" Sam asked suddenly very confused as to why Dean was so concerned about what Castiel thought of the matter.
"What does it matter? He saved my life, I owe him as much as a friendship." The Omega explained "So what if we shared a hug? I was in need of comfort as what has happened to me was pressing on my mind last night. The Prince was in need of comfort upon hearing the news of Raphael's attempt at the throne, of which I had not known."
"Whatever you want Dean. It's your body, your life, and ultimately your call on what you do with it and the the one growing in you." Michael said softly and simply. He didn't want to influence Dean's decision and make him regret whatever he decided. He wanted Dean to be sure of what he wanted to do about the baby and Michael would support him and be there for him through all of it no matter what happened.
"I mean, no fair. I was going to ask you when we went to Bobby's for the 4th of July. But you're freckled ass had to ruin it." Cas gave Dean a little kiss on the cheek as Dean's mouth fell open in shock
Dean had no idea how long he had been tied to that chair and blindfolded. But he was hot, sweating actually, he couldn't sit comfortably, and the rest was just plain embarrassing.
He was only 18. The thought of having pups kinda very much scared him completely. Would he admit that to anyone?
Michael and Sam sent Castiel each a shrug, while Dean made a motion with his arms for Cas to hug the man back.
"You are too sweet, stop showering me with presents, Luc. I-- we're going dancing?! Have I mentioned that I love you?" she laughed, pressing a kiss to his cheek as the blond drove. "How ever did I deserve you… thank you, Luc. None of this would've been necessary, but thank you." she smiled, resting her hand on his as he was changing gear. "You have no idea how huge a gift you've already given to me."
Both younger Princes nodded and Adam grabbed Sam's hand and they both hurried out and down to the lush dining room.
Finally the scent was strongest outside a door to the far end of the hallway, without even thinking the Angel of the Lord ripped the heavy door from its hinges and into the wall behind him. Sparks flew as the few lightbulbs in the hallway shattered and the single bulb in the dark and damp room shattered.
Dean had been keeping track of the minutes in an attempt to keep his mind in check, but it was hot in here, his clothes were sticking to the sweat on his body, and everything ached. Then there was the smell, over however long he had been in here, tied up and alone, the lingering smell of that horrid Alpha suddenly didn't smell so bad.
Sam wanted to say something, anything, but he had never lost a brother before, sure he had lost his mother but he never really knew her and was but a baby.
Castiel was avoiding eye contact, his eyebrows nearly touching as he stared at his eggs. Balthazar had wine in his glass as he chatted joyfully to a maid, Gabriel was quietly moving his food back and forth with his fork, Michael ate in silence, Chuck seemed lost in thought his players untouched, Raphael, for once, seemed content and more smug than usual, Sam just simply scooted his chair a little closer to Dean and said nothing.
Castiel hurried away from Dean, needing to escape before he did something out of character, such as kiss the Prince again. Rounding a corner the Alpha leaned against a tree to catch his breath, once he stopped moving he realized tears were streaming down his face, when had the tears come?
Something was burning, or at least smelled that way. There was the sound of a steady dripping somewhere behind him, the whole room had the wretched smell of angered and aroused Alpha and it made Dean's head shoot up.
"Alpha, your Highness?" Dean spoke a little louder and Lucifer stopped mid sentence as he raised an eyebrow at the Human Omega.
Castiel hated seeing Dean so broken. Ever since he pulled the bright and Beautiful soul out of Hell, Cas knew Dean was cracked. But the cracks in his soul made him human, made him the man he was. Castiel knew if Dean didn't have to dwell on and suffer through these things, then the Winchester could be happier. When he finally worked through and let things go, the angel had seen him happy.
The roads were pretty empty as they usually were. Barely every second family owned a car, if even. So most days, after lunch time, the roads remained empty until after 4 pm. It was a dusty, humid summer day, the roads glimmered with heat as Dean drove them all the way down town.
"How? How can you ease this pain? How can you say you aren't ashamed to have me, and what I am for a son? I wasn't supposed to be this way, and now look at me. I'm pregnant with a child I never wanted, drugged into consent, and still I must marry for some annoying Queen of an unrelated kingdom to Earth, or Heaven, to be happy. Earth and Heaven have had a mutual agreement with Purgatory for centuries! Why now of all times because Hell can't stay peaceful must I marry Michael! Both of us will live miserably never truly loving eachother as mates should!" Dean ground out, gasping for a breath at the end the tears came and he hated it, scrubbing his face he hated this raw vulnerability he had, the carriage had come to a stop some time ago, but the driver made no move to get the door and escort them inside, obviously noting an important conversation was taking place that was best left uninterrupted
"I have done no such thing! I have been granted the throne of Hell, as Crowley is dead. I simply came to show that my Kingdom is not a threat to Heaven."
"You know the rule Mikey, anything shared with me in private, remains as such." He looked up at his brother and future King with a smile "Trust me, everyone comes to me to vent and get it off their chest. Even you. So what our baby brother needed to talk about remains private."
Dean jumped slightly when Michael stood beside him, the Omega Prince had been so enthralled by the ocean he hadn't noticed the angel come to stand beside him.
"I'm so happy you're safe and alright!" She nearly burst into tears as she spoke, a little gasp came out as she hugged him tight
"I'm glad you're alright Dean." Michael spoke softly and Dean finally returned an ever so slight smile "We will talk once you're bathed and dressed."
Dean walked along just trying to clear his head, his nerves. He was planning a wedding tomorrow. Soon he would be married, he'd have a mate, a husband, and he'd be lying if he said that thought didn't frighten him.
"Castiel." Michael's voice wasn't angry, wasn't even all that sad. It wasn't a question, wasn't an accusation, but the younger Angel's name was stated as a truth
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Mike sighed deeply as he seemingly weighed Dean's suggestion. "I'm not aware of any women in this story. Far as we know this family's sealed shut completely. But, if we find out which bar they own we might find out a little more about the barkeeper's boss." Mike suggested promptly after Dean tossed the pile of paper on their shared desk.
"Of course." Lucifer opened the door further and moved so that the four winged golden Alpha could step in and with a quick glance down the hallway Lucifer closed the door
Maybe he was over reacting, maybe he was being dramatic, but he could never have what he wanted. It had always been like that.
Kelly beamed as she took a seat in Lucifer's car. Each and every minute they spent together felt like heaven.
"You're Highness," Lucifer spoke, his voice a bit deeper than usual as he cleared his throat "I shall remain here. Call if I am needed." The Archangel added as Castiel turned his gaze on him
"I said. Get. The fuck. Out." Dean ground out, green eyes filled with pain that Castiel just wanted to take away.
"Thank you brothers. I hope he's comfortable..." Michael had a hand on his chin and his eyebrows furrowed.
Sam would he heading back to his family's Kingdom after the wedding, As Earth was where Dean and Castiel had agreed to Honeymoon. Dean insisting it was beautiful this time of year, and yearning to show Castiel where he grew up. The Alpha of course would deny nothing if he could provide it. Including the two coming to the decision Dean would keep the child, and they would raise them as their own. It had been a hard decision, but Dean felt it was the right one, even if Charlie disagreed at first, her mind had been chance upon the couple saying she would be an amazing Aunt. It didn't make what happened better, and the nightmares and fear would never truly go away, but Dean was healing.
"Listen Michael. Abaddon tried to have me killed due to a scandal. The blackmailing failed you could say. She wanted the throne and I faked her assassination attempt as successful so that I could lay low. Hell is in Chaos with her at the throne. Not a ounce of civility among them!" Crowley hit his fist on the armrest of his chair and shifted to lean his chin on his hand "Help me get back on the throne, and by gones can be bygones. /Besides/" Crowley cooed pretending to look at his fingernails before only his eyes flicked back to Michael "I know someone with a bit of magic to help assist with the struggles you're facing."
"Because he threatened to expose me, it would bring a lot of heat on him, but he'd do anything to prevent Michael from being with another Alpha." Gabriel swallowed thickly
The Prince's fingers of his spare hand twitched at his side as his wings shuddered and he forced them not to move.
"I just want to go home Cas." He sounded so broken, so hurt and before Dean even knew what happened he had been scooped up in the Angel's arms. Castiel my have been an inch shorter, but he was still an Alpha, and still an Angel.
"Wait! Angel come back Don't leave me with these creatures!" Dean called throwing a hand out towards Cas as he stood outside the fort "They're to much for me!"
After finding out Lydia was pregnant, when he was 18, he made sure to try and not be so irresponsible with his dates and weekend flings. The two had been young, and Dean had been an immature kid pretty much. He hadn't meant to get her pregnant, but shit happens when you're drunk and careless kids.
"Go to sleep. I'm sure De will be up early wanting to meet his new little sister." Castiel pointed out running his fingers through Dean's grey streaked hair
While it was a simply kiss, it felt like it contained the world. Like everything Deam had ever imagined and more. They shared the words they could not speak in that moment they kissed. Dean was betraying everyone and everything, he had no idea what to think anymore, what to believe. His life was like a ball of yarn falling off a knitters lap, unraveling and doing so fast.
"Ah. Well Chill little bro. You're making my nose twitch and my stomach churn with the amount if wrath coming off in your scent. You smell like burnt fucking coffee."
They didn't need to exchange any verbal words. A simple look told the other every. Lucifer would Eliminate the threat and return with her head, or return in pieces.
He opened his eyes quickly as a hand touched his shoulder. Meeting his step mother's eyes in the mirror
"I prefer not say." Dean spoke with a setness to his voice but his eyes flicked back to the tattered coat beside him
"Today's excitment has over exerted him. The Omega was feeling worn out and a little under the weather." Gabriel quickly answered easing the tense look Castiel was giving him, the concerned frown Michael had, and the oddly intrigued look in the Demon King's red eyes. Gabriel's wings twitched under the scrutiny, something he certainly /did not/ like was a lot of attention at once.
The whole entire day went by and was rather boring. Lilith was the only one of the people to arrive today, as scheduled, the florists would be arriving the next day along with the bakers.
Gabriel began to pace as the wheels turned, he had an idea, but he hadn't the Faintest if his father would help. Though he supposed there was one way to find out. Slipping his boots on and fixing his hair the golden winged Archangel hurried down the halls towards his father's room, before he reached there however he happened upon their guest he had nearly forgot about.
"You can't stop me. I NEED him!" The dark Castiel as Dean had coined him hissed out, an angel blade slide down from both his sleeves "Don't make me kill you."
"I need to-" He tried to push past Michael but the Alpha had a firm grip on his elbow. "Let me go Michael! I need some air!" He yanked his elbow away and took off in another dead run down the hall and out a door leading to a garden.
"Talk it out while we clean." Her voice was soft as she glanced over at the nest Dean had created of the bed, Castiel's coat front and center with his pillows.
"He went to find some Witch that can see Red Strings that connect True Mates. He said she had been here before and introduced your father to Castiel's mother and-and I your father forbade him from going but he hated seeing everyone in so much pain and-"
"Have a seat, join me for tea. I offered your eldest brother Michael help in his private matters and the pillow stuffing turned me down, but this. This, is a surprise. Gabriel, the third eldest of Heaven's princes, the mysterious Alpha no one truly knows much about, has come to me for up on something? Pray tell me Gabriel, does it have to do with your little secret? Your family's cover up?" Crowley cooed as he took a seat
