Steve stared at Jarvis, and Jarvis stared back, made out of a myriad of colours, so powerful he was almost blinding.
He opens it, because he wants to get this over with, but he misjudged Steve, Steve who throws the shield at him and cracks his sternum and watches as Tony falls to the ground, chest heaving, searching for air that doesn’t come.
“Jarvis, where is Tony?”
But how?
Finally, he inched closer to the fireplace. Steve stood in his way, arms crossed.
In the end, Gretl manages to bite the dust before Tony. And now he can’t let himself go, because there is a baby, and he promised to keep her safe. He puts her in his arms, near his skin, huddling for warmth.
Tony turned around, reaching for a piece of metal, and any inappropriate thoughts of Steve’s died a pitiful death.
“You’re very courageous, St—Rogers. My knight in shining armour. You know what, I’m going to promote you to Captain of the guard of the moving castle, what do you say, Rogers?”
“So, I made you a thing! Your adventure with the frying pan got me thinking that you need something to protect you if you ever get into danger again. I can’t let you destroy all our pans either. And what better than a shield? I got some good metal and made this for you. Here!”
Stark was gone half of the time, always looking charming with his sparkling eyes and unruly hair. He never came home with anyone, and Steve couldn’t decide if he preferred not seeing the victims or if he hated the idea that Stark killed them somewhere in the night, leaving them to rot in some dark alley.
Right now, Tony takes Steve in his arms and smiles into their kiss.
That had more effect. The maw turned into a grimace, and the flames diminished in size.
Steve would have to ask Jarvis about it, but not now, because Stark was walking down the stairs, clad in a flamboyant attire. Steve couldn’t help but notice that it went up to Stark’s neck, hiding any marks. Clean and clothed again, Stark exuded a different kind of beauty than before. There was something less artificial about him, as if he’d lost one of his fake layers, revealing a little more of who he was.
“We need to move as soon as possible. It’ll be taxing, but we don’t have a choice. Janet’s even stronger than I thought she’d be. I’ve never seen her grow like that before. I wish I could say that I won our fight, but honestly, I don’t know. I got some hits in, but she did too. She’ll be recovering in her own castle for now, which should give us time to relocate. I hope.”
Tony stops smiling. He hunches in on himself a little, as if he's just now realised the gravity of the situation. Steve's eyes twinkle. Steve can barely keep the smug smile away from his face, it's fucking laughable. Tony can read him like an open book.
Tony was pacing, raking one hand through his hair, tapping a staccato beat on his chest with the other, talking a mile an hour, trying to figure out what to do.
“I’m glad to see you’re yourself again, Steve. Small you was stunning, but this is the real you.”
“And what I’m doing now is exactly what I was doing before. I’m doing what I believe is the right thing, and the right thing is not the same as what is best or most convenient for me, or what I would like to do. No. the right thing is to protect as many people as possible, to protect
“WHERE IS HE?”
Their last conversation is etched into his brain, Steve’s resentment and bitterness stark on his face and in his voice.
Tony’s eyes widened as he looked behind Steve.
They were hurt badly.
He whispered the last part of his sentence, feeling the tell-tale chill run up his spine at the mere mention of the forbidden magic. If Stark dealt in that kind of magic, then Steve had to leave. Immediately. There was a good reason black magic was prohibited.
, he thought,
With those words, he buried Tony in his arms, pressing his face into his neck, and breathed in, letting the tension of the last months release as he reassured himself that Tony was, really, going to be okay.
The robot—or was it a suit of armour, just like Tony’s?—raised its hands, palms facing towards Tony. There were the same kind of glowing lights on the palms as on the chest, and they were humming, too. Tony couldn’t see any weapons, but the glowing palms did not bode well. He spoke:
It was time to leave. Stark turned the circle next to the door to the red part, gave Steve a paper with an address and a drawn arrow pointing up, and bid him good luck before ushering him out of the door.
It was more a jagged mound of sharp-edged black stones, piled high under the sun. The castle was more dead than alive. It wasn’t moving, ink-black save for the sickly yellow rocks protruding here and there, yellowish smoke oozing out of them like the dying breath of a sick animal. Sulfur smoke, Steve knew, highly toxic. He stayed away from the smoke and its stench.
He should move over the hilltop pass to get some protection from the wind, he realised. Judging by his speed up to now, it’d take him another hour before he’d be on the other side of the hill, just enough time before the last dregs of light would be gone.
“I never loved you, Jocasta, because I was already head over heels for Steve. You never stood a chance.”
It was coming closer, he realised.
Gretl.
While picking through the paints, she told Steve about Stark:
It wasn’t a lie, not really. Jarvis didn’t need to hear any more negative opinions about Stark.
Steve was on the streets of Ma’Hattan, in front of a grand shop window with golden letters proclaiming this was the consulting office of the Great Magician Potts. Around him, expensively dressed people walked, drove, rode to their respective destinations. A tram sped past. Steve looked down at the paper and noticed that the arrow was pointing left. It was a magical arrow. Of course. Steve was probably meant to follow the arrow to the given address.
The scarecrow hopped around a bit, seemingly looking for something. He leaned in towards several shelves, fluttered around the kitchen, all the while making little impatient sounds.
The ice groaned around him. There was a thud again, followed by the bluest light Steve had ever seen.
“Tony, what happened?” Steve desperately tried to bring him back to the present.
“Jarvis, do you think that Stark is in love with Natasha?”
He hadn’t been ready for the compliment.
Sharon presses on the wound, and now that he turns his head, he can see that she’s asking for help. They’re alone on the court steps, now, the bystanders long gone. A few U.S. Marshals are standing around them, guns drawn, but there’s no EMT in sight.
It’s freeing, to lay all the cards on the table. He can’t let Steve down more than he already has, and now at least Steve will know what he thinks.
Stark winced, and Steve winced with him.
“Don’t look at me like that. It happens, okay? Anyways, long story short, she recognised me and immediately attacked me. You know the rest.”
But more importantly, Natasha knew?
Steve, unperturbed by the change in subject, glances at the window.
James helped Steve down onto the couch, asking him about the Witch.
He didn’t know what to do with that piece of information. Should he be glad she knew, or should he be anxious that she would be concerned about him? Should he try to contact her? He hadn’t talked to her in months, his previous plans to send her a letter when he arrived at Ma’Hattan completely forgotten when he met Tony and Jarvis. Thank God James had told her, she would be worried sick otherwise, with Steve disappearing off the map, without a word to his sister.
Stark disappeared down the stairs, taking the sheet with him.
No. The curse. He had to see if the curse was gone, had to give Tony his heart back.
James had told her about Steve?
Cap looked confused for a moment, until his face broke out in a wry smile.
Jarvis, at these words, burned brighter. He turned almost entirely blue, his flames spewing out of the fireplace, licking the ceiling. His voice morphed, became deeper, more monstrous.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was halfway up when he felt something slip past his hip and onto the floor. When he looked back, half expecting to see a blob of Stark’s body (His hip? A part of his leg?), he was met with the sight of the soppy towel a few steps lower.
There were sounds, too, he realised, muffled by the thick wall of ice around him, but there. Deep sounds that reverberated through his prison, the vibrations traveling all the way to his core. Thrumming sounds. They had to be very loud, for Steve to feel them.
Time to see if Steve is feeling murderous again or if they can actually get something constructive done this time.
What really distressed Tony, however, was that Steve had seen the Witch of the Waste so close to his home. He’d been very upset at first, wanting to know if the Witch had seen Steve, if they had talked, if there was any chance that she could have known that Steve had been in her vicinity. When Steve had assured that no, she hadn’t seen him, and she hadn’t shown any sign of feeling his aura or her own curse or anything like that, Tony had been mollified somewhat. Until he had realised that the Witch was looking for him and his home, and that she was very close to succeeding. For all they knew, she could be standing outside the shop window right now.
door.
“Damn right I can take care of myself! I don’t need you to—”
“Of course I will, but only if you accept mine in exchange. I love you too, you know.”
— once, and now he remembers.
No weather for sleeping outside.
After Steve had gotten some sleep, he went back to the kitchen to see the dog still sleeping, Tony looking somewhat better than the day before. He was less pale, but Steve could see the mark on the base of his throat where Tony’s collar was open. It was a harsh reminder that they were on a finite timeline.
He needs to find Gretl.
Steve found he preferred his hometown. The buildings were simpler, the streets narrower, but it had its charm. It was cosier than the capital, more homely.
“Seems like he can’t tell us in this form. Can you turn into a human?”
Iron Man and Tony stared at each other.
Steve decided to follow Jarvis’ lead. The fire demon seemed to want to make Steve understand something, and he was curious to know more. Did it have something to do with the pact? Or with Steve’s curse?
“You’re welcome. I’m sorry about messing up the jars. I’m sorry—I’m sorry about getting angry earlier, too, that was uncalled for.”
“I know where I want the blue door to lead to, but the red one… What about moving to Brooklyne? This is where you’re from, right, Cap?”
Tony was still holding his hand. Steve was gripping his hand right back.
“Why are you
“Come on, Avenger. You need to get out of bed.”
The others, though… They’re dangerous, yes, but Tony’s faster. And stronger. He could snap Clint’s neck in the blink of an eye. Natasha, if she saw him coming, would prove more of a challenge. Tony would let her tire herself out, then he’d sweep in, hold her down, and bite at her femoral artery, let her bleed out.
he thought.
“Why do the customers from the port pay so little? I know the spells and charms they buy should cost more, but every time I mention it to Stark, he evades the question. He can’t give them all discounts, can he? That just defeats the purpose of a business. How does he even get the money to buy all of the ingredients? Or his expensive clothes? Or his inventing material?”
There was nothing.
And true enough, there was an injured raven perched on his shoulder, its feathers dull and matted with blood and grime. Tony didn’t look good at all, but at least he was alive.
Steve soon lost himself in the cleaning, dusting, and arranging of the furniture and supplies. He didn’t have any paintings he was willing to sell yet, but he left a space for future paintings in one of the corners. He left another corner free for Tony, where he could have a counter and sell spells or talk or do what he wanted to do.
Steve always forgave Tony, but they never really recovered from the war, and the fissures left after Steve came back from the dead and Tony got rebooted never closed. Tony can almost hear them open wide, the cracks groaning as the fissures turn into faults, that turn into open maws that leave Steve and Tony on opposite sides, unable and unwilling to close the gap.
He needed to help Tony. He didn’t care if he was running towards his death, or a trap, the only thing that mattered was Tony.
Steve figured it couldn’t hurt to tell him, since nothing bad had happened. Besides, he had the feeling that Stark wouldn’t let it go, if his intense gaze was anything to go by.
It was as if Tony wanted Steve to think badly of him. Why?
“Thank you, Jarvis, but I’m going to figure this spell out.”
“She’s one of my best friends. Pepper Potts, you might have heard of her, she’s a powerful witch that specialises in helping those in need. I might have used her name when I created my fake identity in Ma’Hattan. But she doesn’t mind, since we have a different clientele. Anyways. She knows the King, and she’s friendly. She’ll help you.”
. You conveniently forgot the worst year of m—our life and then you go and make the
Tony’s eyes lit up with recognition.
“I’ve felt more alive these last few months than I’ve felt in years. You came in, and with your paintings and stubbornness and kindness you made this place a home. You helped me with the King, you got me home after fighting the Witch, you protected our home from intruders. You’ve been guarding me since you came here, you won’t let me lie to you, you saw through me and you stayed. You can’t know how grateful I am that you stayed. “
Stark had gone pale as a ghost, his hands rising slightly, his chest heaving.
. He stepped inside the property. A man was waiting for him by the front door, gesturing him inside to a tasteful waiting room. Steve didn’t have to wait long before he was called to the witch’s study.
Tony came back long after lunch, his skin pale and clammy. It looked like the marks were having a greater effect on his health, then. He didn’t bother covering them up, the collar of his tunic half-open. There was an air of disheartenment about him. He dropped down on the chair near the fire, gazing at Jarvis.
“I understand, and I admire your loyalty, Mr. Rogers. Let me give you a warning, however, because if what I fear is happening, then I must tell you about it, so that you can try to hinder it. I’ve heard from the King that he’s looking to make Tony court sorcerer, because he wants Tony to confront the Witch of the Waste. But I know what few others know: that Janet and Tony have history. They were inseparable when they were younger, and I was there when they started their relationship. We were all taking magic classes together, and Tony was one of the brightest minds of the University. He was undoubtedly the most brilliant in our year, but Janet was very smart as well. In addition, they both came from wealthy and old families, and they both had a fire demon. It was almost inevitable that they ended up together. Janet wasn’t evil, at that time, you see. She was just a highly intelligent woman. But the danger with fire demons is that they can corrupt one’s heart. Hers was easily swayed into the evils of black magic, and the demon infected Janet, until evil completely took her over. Her heart is black as coal, now, and she goes by the name of the Witch of the Waste. Her decline happened over the course of several years, it was slow and gradual, and when Tony realised what was happening, he ended their relationship before she could corrupt him in turn. But I see now that she has managed to plant an evil seed in Tony, and that the seed has taken root. Please help him kill it before it kills him.”
He couldn’t do anything right, could he? He couldn’t give food and water to someone who needed it, he couldn’t even remember that there was a bloody dog in his house if the dog didn’t bark at him! What was wrong with him? All he had done today was listen to Jarvis and Tony tell him their terrible stories, then listen as a man who had been
He gathered the flowers that were left and noticed something odd. One of the bigger ones still had part of its root, which shouldn’t have happened, since Steve had been careful to cut them when he picked them. Steve gave the other flowers as food to Jarvis but kept the odd one. He put it into a vase of water, he wanted to see if the root would develop. If it did, he could plant it in a pot. He’d picked the flower because it had been so different to the others: wrinkled dark green leaves with a violet midrib surrounding a cluster of white-purple flowers in the middle. The leaves had reminded Steve of an exotic kale, and well, maybe it was edible.
Wait, did he think that Steve was skilled in painting?
“I thought you would want to see Natasha instead.”
It’s better than doing it to Steve, he tells himself.
At his curt words, there was a flash of anger in her eyes, which she schooled behind a smile as fake as Steve’s was.
“Stark, how come your armour looks like that? I don’t see how you operate that thing without energy supply. And why are all your devices so… different?”
He had to believe in it. He was fighting the good fight, because even if he was going to lie about Stark, it was for a good cause. Stark needed time to break his own curse. Him dying would make the world a worse place to live in.
Steve turned to him, feeling his eyes widen. Stark knew?
He’d been cursed instead of killed, just like Steve, James and Tony. And Steve had been the one to deny the cure to his curse. He stammered out a greeting, unsure of what he should say, what he should do in the presence of yet another powerful sorcerer.
Jarvis pulsed, but kept quiet.
What?
In the land of Americanah, where such things as magic suits of armour and levitating cloaks really existed, it was quite a misfortune to be born the eldest child in a family. After all, everyone knew that you were the one who would be pursued by bad luck, that you were destined to fail your endeavours. As it was, Steve Rogers was the eldest of two siblings, which entailed that he had the dubious honour of being the failure of the family.
They were losing him, Tony was losing the fight against the curse.
His suit breaks apart under Steve’s rage, the shield cutting and ripping.
Tony nodded, his eyes taking on that otherworldly glow again. He was gearing up for something big, Steve knew.
Apart from the hushed conversation James was having with…
He made it three steps, and that was when a robot in red and gold burst in, blocking the entrance. Tony aimed the gun at the glowing light in the centre of the chest, looking for any sign of allegiance to the Axis or the Allies. There were none.
When Stark had come back that evening, Steve had told him about it and apologised (he’d thought that it was better to tell Stark than have Stark discover it on his own). But Stark had told him that it was fine, that he knew the girl’s grandmother, and always gave her a discount. A
You can’t really appreciate the true, explosive,
Stark was kinder than Steve had expected.
“That must be it. The spell must have slipped by when you had the door opened, magic and time and space is always a little tricky with that one. It’s fine, we’ll just have to go there and try to find where the spell came from. Maybe someone has the other half. But not today.”
The man was trembling, his left hand clenching and unclenching, and Steve recognised the distress he’d felt when he realised he couldn’t tell anyone about his curse.
Her stingers, because that was what her hands had turned into, were the size of Tony’s body. She attacked him viciously, not giving him the time to grow bigger. He was struggling, Steve could see, losing feathers to the stingers, doing all he could just to stay out of the Witch’s reach.
It was the damn dog.
Steve’s brows draw together, his mouth trembles into a frown, and Tony realises that he’s lost feeling in his legs.
“Not that I don’t understand his choice—you are what could be considered handsome— but a store-owner?
Still, Tony wants to see how that particular turn of events came to be. He starts on the task of hacking the nearest computer to understand when and where exactly  he is. There's an inhibitor of some kind in the walls, ceiling and floor of the room, no,
Tony can feel the thrumming of the ventilation, but to his eyes, the speck of dust is animated with its own life. It’s almost like it’s dancing, swooping gracefully and spinning around its own axis, carefree in its lightness. It’s the perfect antithesis to how Tony’s feeling.
There was an air of abandonment about the mansion. The shutters were closed, the gate locked with a rusty chain. Stark’s steps faltered ever so slightly as he walked past the property.
Tony shivers at the frigid voice. It’s good enough. He isn’t in the mood for jokes or anything other but the truth anyways.
“Don’t you think it’s a bit easy to point Stark as the culprit here? Why would he even make those people disappear?”
He did, and after twenty minutes of walking, he stood in front of an old and respectable mansion. On the front gate, he could make out the letters V and P intertwined in each other, and a subtle sign that read:
He put Steve’s hand on his heart, and Steve could feel the healthy beat under his palm. Steve curled his hand into a fist and put his other hand on Tony’s cheek.
Steve looks at him, searching his face for something, and leans even closer, their breaths mingling. His eyes drop down to Tony’s lips, and then they’re kissing.
Steve was breathing hard, but he took the time to inspect the shield for any scrapes or dents. There were none, and he felt oddly proud. Using the rim had been an excellent idea, if he said so himself. He traced it with his finger. It was sharp enough that it could cut if enough force were applied. The shield was more than a mere defensive tool, Steve realised. Tony, by making it light and solid, had ensured that Steve could use it on the offensive too. He could deal blows, use it as a blunt weapon. He would have done quite the damage, had he been in his old body. With this body, it was less considerable, but not inconsequential.
Tony pulled his gun out and flipped off the safety switch, creeping closer to the door. He slipped the key inside one of his trouser’s seams. It wouldn’t be found if he was captured. He wasn’t going to take any risks, nothing here was indicative enough for him to feel safe just yet. It didn’t feel like he was still in Gotland, though. The gym felt
The question was so unexpected that it knocked Steve out of his daze. He took a step back, dislodging his wrist from the stranger’s grip, and spluttered. He didn’t know what was going on, he’d been fighting for his life not two minutes ago, and now this man wanted to drink a cup of tea with him?
On his way back, Steve asked himself if this man could have been Stark. He’d been a magician, after all, and he’d flirted with Steve.
Why was Stark so adamantly against confronting her? He wasn’t helpless against her, not if the King thought he had a chance to battle against her and win. Why would the King ask for him, otherwise? Was Stark such a coward, that he didn’t even want to try?
Steve’s lifeless hand is glowing orange—
Tony hopes that Steve will take the leap somewhere private. He’s 70% sure that this is how it will go, because he’s heard enough about Steve’s love-life to know that he isn’t really the kind of guy who advertises it for the whole world to see. Then again, Tony has come on very strong to Steve. Maybe he’s even being a bad influence.
“Look at that, you’re alive,” Steve murmurs. He smiles. “I was starting to wonder.”
Tony looks back to Steve, who is staring intently at Tony again.
“No. I don’t want to hear your lies, Tony. You’ve been lying to all of us, to me, for all this time.
people in cold blood. Honestly, I don’t even know why I haven’t left this place weeks ago.”
“Tony? The clock is ticking. You have eight minutes before someone starts asking questions. Get up.”
He suppresses a shiver. He shouldn’t even need to shiver. The room is at an optimal temperature. The sheets are warm enough. His body isn’t cold. He still hasn’t opened his eyes.
Jarvis’s words only half-appeased Steve. It was good that Tony wasn’t hurt, and that James was rid of the curse, but he didn’t like that Tony had put his health in second place. He shouldn’t be so careless with his body.
Steve had never seen Jarvis this agitated before. Nor that weakened. What was happening? Had the armour’s destruction taken a toll on Jarvis? Or had Jarvis helped Tony with his magic as well?
“Fine, but I still need to meet Natasha. I really miss her and I want to see her.”
“You’re right. We can continue this conversation later, after we’ve moved. Alright. Steve, do exactly as I say.”
Tony forces himself to breathe.
He opens his eyes. Steve is staring right at him. He’s crouched by the head of the bed, his face inches from Tony. His head is slightly tilted, and he doesn’t move when Tony recoils.
The Natasha voice teased him.
Steve’s sitting up behind him, one hand still in Tony’s hair, playing lightly with a strand.
“Would you look at that!”
Steve doesn’t want to talk about it, just wants to know if they’ve destroyed planets already, how many, who broke first, did you break, Tony, why did you do this why did you use me why why why why
Steve picked up a feather from the ground. It was shiny, black and smooth.
One of them was telling the others about the calamity she was sure was about to strike Brooklyne. She was loud, and Steve could hear everything she had to say.
He stopped in front of the dining table. There was a stack of papers, several pieces of charcoal on top, left there by Stark a few days ago when he’d rushed out in the middle of drawing diagrams and complicated designs.
, he tried to comfort himself. It didn’t really work.
She paused, gloating.
What was he thinking, leaving through the red door, right into the Witch’s domain? On the fated day of his death? He should be fleeing into the opposite direction, as far from the Waste as possible, just to gain more time.
“Leave me alone,” Tony says. He regrets his words almost instantly. The quiet hurt on Steve’s face is almost too much to bear. With Steve like this, so close, so crisp, Tony almost forgets. He screws his eyes shut again. Sometimes it helps.
“No, I’m fine, I was just a bit tired.”
how fire was supposed to work. The flame grew stronger as it burned the log, and Steve realised with surprise that it was eating the wood. If he looked closely, he could make out a fiery tongue swirling around the wood, pulling it onto a maw that grew and grew as it consumed its fuel. In less than a minute, there was a hearty fire illuminating and warming the whole room. The fire was glowing a strong orange-red now, with hints of purple and blue-white in its centre. The maw was nowhere to be seen, but Steve still heard the
The form that emerged from the darkness was so far from what Steve had imagined that he stopped short. It was—it looked like—he didn’t know
Stark was agitated, looking between Jarvis and Steve with pursed lips and unhappy lines in his face.
“I will, okay, I will. Please concentrate on burning while I help Tony,” Steve hurriedly answered. Jarvis seemed to accept the answer and closed his eyes, turning dormant, glowing so faintly Steve would have thought the fire had died down to embers. But when he saw that Jarvis was burning through the logs faster than he used to, he realised that he was recuperating. Good. Now to take care of Tony.
When he arrived at the harbour, he hid himself between crates, and observed.
“I can’t!
He woke up at dawn, his body aching and tired. He had to sort through Natasha’s clothes until he found a shirt and pants that were small enough for his new stature. His red leather shoes still fitted him, which was a small mercy, since Natasha had taken both her pair of shoes with her. He took his own coat, the warmest piece of clothing he owned. It was too long on him, reaching almost to his shins instead of mid-thigh, but with the sleeves rolled, it did its job. He took a small bag with food and the meagre amount of savings he had scraped together over the years, wrote a note that said that the shop would be closed indefinitely due to urgent personal matters, put it on the door, and locked all the doors and windows.
He was woken up by the sound of a door closing. He blinked, tried to remember where he was, and sat up straight when he realised that James wasn’t in the kitchen. Had he gone out? Was there something wrong?
He doesn’t deserve any of it.
Stark was glowing now, his hair rising up in a threatening halo, his eyes icy blue. He was floating a few centimetres above the floor.
, having left before Steve could answer,
They wouldn’t have been in such a hurry if Tony hadn’t made a stupid mistake in converting from the old Swedish time-measuring system to the one currently in use. Thankfully, Pepper had spotted the error just in time for them to go into a mad dash into the cave, Tony dropping everything but the parchment and a torch.
Jocasta.
? I thought you were out of the weapons business, but instead you build world-ending bombs? How…
Having said his piece of mind, he stormed out of the kitchen and into his bedroom.
Now that his mind was free of insidious whispers, Steve could enjoy the view of the city beneath him, glimmering in the sunlight. It was beautiful, the copper roofs reflecting the light in fiery orange, deep green, and almost black flashes. The wealth of the town was undeniable, everything glittered and shone.
Sometimes, there’s blood on civilians, frightened children and teenagers and adults, sobbing and pleading for help. When Iron Man swoops in, they open their arms in relief and cling to him in unconditional trust as he flies off with them. They’d be so easy to control. He’d fly up, high into the sky, carrying them away from safety and into his claws. Higher and higher, until they don’t have enough oxygen, until they gasp for air, their throat working beautifully. He would only need to open the faceplate, let them see his teeth, and their confused fear would turn into terror. They’d struggle, then cling to him even harder as they realised that they'd fall to their death if he let them go. He’d lower his neck. Maybe kiss their jaw, lightly, before trailing down until he found the jugular. He’d bite them slowly, let them feel every millimetre of his teeth sinking in. Maybe they’d trash, or scream, or maybe they’d freeze, base instincts telling them what he knew all along: that they were prey, and he was a predator. He’d take his time, sip slowly, languorously, until their grip on his armour slackened, faltered, slipped away.
When they’re both ready for sparring, they circle each other, both waiting for the other to attack first. Tony suspects that Steve wants Tony to make the first move, to gauge his skills, and react accordingly. Tony wants Steve to go first because then he’ll have a baseline of what a normal human should be able to do and dodge. Steve will go easy on him, and Tony needs that to understand how much of his strength he needs to keep under wraps. If none of them sets this in motion, they’ll turn in circles forever. Can Tony risk to attack? He’s watched Clint and Natasha, he can copy them. But would it be weird for him to be as strong as Clint? Or as fast as Natasha? Maybe he should tone it down. But not too much, because then he’ll come across as a weakling, and that is something the hunter in him bristles at.
Steve trusted Tony. He could do it.
His feet were getting heavier. He needed to rest. But if he stopped, he wasn’t sure that he’d be able to stand up again, so he continued, carefully stepping on stones and using the silvery moonlight to lead the way. It was almost ethereal, this dark hill with glints of grey and silver and blue on the stones. He looked up at the sky, the moon a great circle of light amidst the twinkling stars.
He coughs. First, make sure that Steve is okay.
Jarvis and Stark couldn’t agree on that last part. Jarvis was sure it was a spell, while Stark was adamant that it couldn’t be, because what kind of spell asked the caster to finish it? You either made your own spell or learnt one from someone else, but you never completed someone else’s spell. Jarvis wasn’t so sure about that. There were other kinds of magic, sorcery that Stark didn’t know of, he argued. It had to be a special spell, that had sneaked into the castle somehow.
Jarvis, after studying the now sleeping dog, resumed his quiet burning.
He does good as Iron Man, and that almost makes up for the fact that he’s a monster that doesn’t care who he kills.
Steve wondered what he’d thought if Tony had looked like this for their first meeting. He would have run away in horror, he knew. Steve was glad he could see the man underneath the masks and lies, that he knew his appearance didn’t mean much. Tony was gorgeous, even like this, because in the end, what counted was where his heart lay. And Steve knew Tony was a good man with a heart of gold.
Who turned off the lights?
Steve whirled towards Jarvis.
Sharon is screaming something in Tony’s ear, but it’s just distorted enough that he can’t make sense of her words. Her hand comes into his field of vision, dripping red. Was she hit too? No, it doesn’t make sense, she wasn’t anywhere near Steve when the sniper shot. Tony’s gaze follows her hand down Steve’s collarbone, past the star, and to the crimson mess of the stripes.
Cap cleared his throat at Tony’s inquiring gaze.
Tony opened the red door next and walked out. Steve followed him, curious to see where they had moved to.
Tony left after Steve had assured him that he wouldn’t let anyone in, and that he would have his shield ready.
work well with others, since you seem to be content in working with him.”
Steve didn’t want to be instrumental in Jarvis’ death. He liked the fire demon, who had protected him and let him enter the castle all these months ago. Besides, he and Tony were on very good terms. They’d lived together for years, and it was obvious that Jarvis was Tony’s best friend, and that Tony meant the world to Jarvis. He couldn’t imagine how Tony would react to Jarvis’ death.
Stark didn’t seem angry, only amused, which made Steve feel just foolish, and not foolish and panicked. Jarvis had done his best, but Stark was skilled in magic. Steve should have thought of that earlier.
He's perfectly fine with pretending he knows even more than he does. It's so fun to destabilise his opponents. Show them just how outclassed they are. Really, he doesn't understand why his pathetic former self never did that. Wasn't it boring, to talk to all the passably intelligent people he called his friends?
Odd, he thought. Ice shouldn’t be yellow. Or green. It was blue, and white, and black, and grey, but not green.
He needed… he needed something warm, a nice fire, and maybe something to eat, something to hold so that his hands would just
“Then we have everything we need to make this happen.”
Cap crossed his arms, frowning, and Tony got the distinct impression that if Iron Man didn’t give a good explanation, Cap was going to take Tony’s side.
Or did she decide to vent her frustration on Steve? Just because Tony had propositioned him? That was messed up.
In a few hours, it would be time to open the shop, but that was not happening anymore. He should leave before then and make sure that no one saw him and started asking uncomfortable questions. He would need to travel by foot to save money. It would take longer to reach the capital city than with horse carriage or automobile, but it would be worth it. When he’d be in Ma’Hattan, he’d find a way to be useful, earn some money. And if all failed, he could always make himself a new life there. The city should have many opportunities, even for a sickly first-born like himself.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over him. He saw Stark and immediately jumped at him, I tried to chase him away, I didn’t know you were walking here, my lord, Mr. Rogers.”
It took the better part of fours hours to clean everything and sort out the empty bottles and boxes and jars. There were jars with all kinds of stuff in them: powder, gels, creams, some of them had stones. He even saw one with a lone eye. After that one, he stopped opening the jars.
Cap looked as gobsmacked as Tony. Multiple universes? Tony had never even thought of that possibility. This Reed fellow sounded like a very interesting man. But if Tony was from a different universe, then that meant that the key transported people from universe to universe, which wouldn’t really be useful for the army. It was a great discovery nonetheless. Tony wondered what the main differences between the universes were. He asked Stark.
Tony screams as Extremis kicks in and forces his heart to beat again. He lost concentration, he slipped, he hit enter. Steve is trying to keep him close, but his grip is weak again, his hands cold and dead against Tony’s trashing form.
Steve woke up with a crick in his neck. He really shouldn’t have fallen asleep in his chair like that. Well, hopefully it would be over before he had to greet the day’s first customers and—
Tony shuts off half his nervous system in his attempt at alleviating his pain. It’s too much, too soon after the pleasant numbness from a second ago. It feels as if his heart is trying to claw its way out of his chest.
to be the dog.
But why would she…
Tony's just about to enjoy his first daiquiri of the morning when the blue glow envelops him.
“Just give up.”
“Tony? Thank God! Do I need to fight, where is she?”
Did it have something to do with the curse? What was the last condition again? That he would have to become honest? Was that something Tony was missing, honesty? They weren’t physical things, which almost corroborated Steve’s earlier theory. But how would he know which thing was the right one? Should he try to find a hidden meaning behind Tony’s words? Listen to every word he said, notice everything that could be meant in more ways than one?
Steve needed to talk to him, ask his name, know where he stood. He wouldn’t let someone that was linked to the Witch court Natasha. Who knew what she had planned? But if the weredog had attacked Tony out of jealousy or protectiveness, well, that would be better. And if Natasha loved him too, there was a bigger chance that he was one of the Witch’s victims rather than an accomplice.
Stark winked at him, still laughing, and Steve couldn’t find it in himself to ask him to stop.
Steve barely spared a thought for James, who was lying half on top of the table—he would survive, his situation wasn’t urgent—before he ran up the stairs to retrieve his shield. He put on sturdy pants and a leather jacket, both marine blue, before putting on his shoes. He didn’t have the time to help James, he would have to make do on his own.
He ran until he saw a black shape in the distance, and then he ran some more.
Those weren’t very optimistic words, Steve couldn’t help but notice.
His arms finally give out, and his face mashes against Steve’s. Their lips meet, for a fraction of a second, enough for Tony to imagine heat and wetness and intent, and then his fall continues, and their blood smears past Steve’s jaw, down his throat, as Tony’s brow crunches against a step.
Tony’s strength left him, the last of his magic aura exhausting itself to give him his human appearance again. His legs gave out.
Tony would sell his soul over and over again if it kept the people he loved safe. It’s not enough to be willing to die for them.
“Poor Janet’s heart was getting weak, you see, and I needed a replacement. She was useful, sure, but she’s never quite had the temperament needed to do the things I wanted her to do. She was evil, and cruel, but there was only so much I could do with her. You took care of her for me, good riddance. Your heart, though, Tony… I’ll be able to do great things with it. A troubled past, the right motivation, guilt, lies, it’s perfect. To think that you would have given it to me, had I accepted your offers earlier! You fall in love too easily, it’s always been a fault of yours.”
He lived in the small but lively town of Brooklyne with his sister Natasha. They’d never known their father, and their mother had passed away recently, leaving two orphans to tend after themselves and their small shop. After months of grief and trying to make ends meet, they came to the conclusion that one of them had to move out. Naturally, Natasha was the one who would go and take the opportunity to study and become a master in the trade she would choose. Following careful deliberations, they agreed to send Natasha to the prestigious Shield guild to learn witchcraft and martial arts. It was with a heavy heart that Steve bid farewell to his sister, knowing it would be a long time before they saw each other again.
“To help Tony, you must understand how the Witch of the Waste lost herself. Only then will you be able to prevent Tony from going down the same path. Fire demons only make contracts because humans can give them something they lack, something that gives both human and fire demon great strength and better health. Find out what is it that Tony gave Jarvis, and you’ll have your clue.”
And that was another thing Steve wondered about. Why had Stark and the Witch been in a relationship? What had Stark seen in her? Her looks? She was the opposite of Steve from before the curse: petite, dark-haired, dark-eyed. Maybe that was what Stark liked?
Natasha-voice sneered.
She’ll manage.
The trickiest part about blood, though, is when it’s his teammates’ blood. Because civilians he can drop off and forget, but his team is never far. Right next to him in the Quinjet, sitting on the same couch on movie nights, smelling like blood and painkillers and disinfectant. Sometimes the bandages peek through their clothes. Sometimes they’re stained red. Tony can’t allow himself to look at them for too long lest he gets lost in his need.
The man moaned in pain, shuddered, hunched in on himself, and started breathing faster. His teeth were sharper than a minute ago. Steve lost track of what he’d been thinking, faced with the man’s agony.
Stark was now just as red as Cap. They turned to look at each other, hope evident in their eyes, and Tony congratulated himself on a job well done as the blue enveloped him.
Who did she think she was, inviting herself into the castle? And
Tony waited for the couple to come to a decision. He was getting the hang of this “think before acting” business.
What does he think Tony would even try? Steve has assumed control, and Tony doesn’t want it back. Not that he has ever really been in control since the start of the incursions.
“It wasn’t a hallucination? It was really you?”
Didn’t Stark give her updates on his well-being? Didn’t she know about the curse? What was safe to tell her?
He can’t realistically visit him every day in his cell. People would talk. This is the perfect opportunity to see him with his own two eyes as opposed to through a video camera lens.
He looks at the screens in front of him.
Steve hated this, hated feeling so helpless. Hated that he had helped the curse come one step closer to its fulfilment.
Stark and Jarvis looked at him with the same calculating gaze. There was a twinkle in Stark’s eye and his mouth curled up.
“The mermaids, the mandrake, and the wind that would make me honest. I’m a bit unsure about what exactly must happen, but I think that if something close to what is written in the poem happens, the condition will be fulfilled. I’ve already caught a star, so the next one in line is the mermaids. I hope that I need to teach someone to hear the mermaids singing to fulfil the condition, but I think that if I just hear mermaids at all it’ll count, because hearing mermaids is already very rare.”
“Good morning, you must be the wizard Anthony Stark, my name is Joy O’Casta, how can I help you?”
“There is one thing the Witch of the Waste hates, and that is flowers. Janet loved them. When we were together, we bought this shed, and came here every spring to plant flowers. Her dream was to have this field conquer the desert, until there would only be a sea of flowers left. We were here when I understood that her heart had been taken over by evil. She always loved flowers, but that day, she was cutting them down, saying they were ugly and weak, that we were wasting our time, that we should let the desert reign. She wasn’t herself anymore. We ended our relationship right then, right here. She has come to despise flowers. I guess it reminds her too much of her old life. Of me.
He doesn’t even have the time to ask why they’re breaking into his workshop when they could just have opened the door. No, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye are already circling him, and Steve stands there, asking him who broke first, and Tony can’t help but point out the obvious: Steve did, and he doomed them all in the process.
Twenty seconds left, now.
Besides, he could always get used to his body as it was. He’d spent months in it already, and if he was careful, it wasn’t so bad. There was a distinct advantage, which was that people underestimated him a bit. Or fussed over him more.
Then he looked around and frowned. He could have sworn the cave had been darker than this just a moment ago. In fact, now that he was watching it, the key was glowing brighter and brighter.
You can’t fight your way out of everything, Tony wanted to scream back at Steve. How can you think that being dead and free is better than being alive? Does the phrase
Not thinking about it, he reminds himself.
into a million lights.
“You’re a beautiful fire demon, mister…”
Eventually, Steve found himself in the main hall, a cavernous space empty of everything save a black marble throne. On it, the Witch was sat, clad in a tight-fitting leather suit, in black and yellow. In any other situation, Steve would have called it tasteful clothing, but now, it only accentuated just who he had to face. Her insect wings were spread wide, and for a second Steve stared as they reflected the light in a shimmering rainbow.
“I’m happy for both of you. But tell me, how is he?”
Steve, not even sexually (this is a lie), he needs to get his fangs on Steve, he can’t control himself. He gravitates toward Steve, circling and circling like a shark smelling blood in the water. Because that is precisely what he is. He’s looking, waiting for the smallest opening. At the tiniest hint of a weakness, he’ll be all over Steve. He knows it. He can feel it in his bones, in the stolen blood flowing through his veins.
“It’s me, Tony. I’m on your shoulder.”
Steve ignored the last sentence.
At first glance, the room around him bore a striking resemblance to the old gym in his family mansion. It had the same kind of wallpaper, the extra thick one that could withstand a little wear and tear.
Love, Steve Rogers.
But he’d saved Steve. He couldn’t be the man that ate his victim’s hearts, could he? Besides, it didn’t matter, because he was gone. Steve was just glad he was alive.
He only needs to be patient. If he’s lucky, Steve’ll get injured a few times more between now and the end.
The Witch’s magic wasn’t gone, their curses were still very much active.
Tony was even more graceful in the armour than he’d been out of it, looping and swooping around the Witch, who had lost the advantage, since he was significantly faster, and could hit her from afar. She screamed angrily, her face distorted in the blue and yellow light, and thrust her stingers into the clouds, a loud crackling announcing that she had channelled electricity into them. She hit Tony, and sparks flew as electricity arched through him.
“Is this what you’re looking for? What do you want to do with—”
He needs to get up.
It wouldn’t hurt to check, though.
There’s something on the tar next to Tony. A charred bit of leather, the yellow reflecting the blaze. He touches it.
Steve caught him before he could fall. He looked down at Tony and smiled.
smart he is, and…” He never finished his sentence, averting his eyes.
Iron Man let out what was definitely a nervous chuckle.
Tony desperately needs to know.
He was right, Steve noticed. Stark would recognise Jarvis’ magic, since it was tied to his own, so Jarvis decided to leave the armour instead of alerting Stark. It made Steve feel warm, that the fire demon went to such lengths to help him. He would have to thank Jarvis thoroughly. And leave before Stark saw him.
Oh God, what if she was looking for Tony? His house was just a few streets further down, she was almost on his doorstep already.
And it wouldn’t hurt the King not to know. Since Tony had just been appointed court sorcerer, it wasn’t as if the decision could still be swayed by anything Steve did or didn’t say. Which was why Steve kept his mouth shut, bowed again, and let himself be dismissed without complaint.
He wondered how much time had passed already. His mind wasn’t…it wasn’t working very well. He knew he should be afraid, should be terrified, should be out of his mind with dread. Should try to fight this. There was something, no, someone he needed to get to.
“Please leave immediately.”
He was bleeding heavily.
He had to contact her in some way and tell her about the situation, before some of the regulars at the shop sent her a concerned telegram or letter that would only serve to worry her. On the other side, she couldn’t know about the curse, because she would surely want to help him, and he didn’t want her to jeopardise her education just for him. Maybe if he told her he’d finally decided to travel the kingdom a little bit, since she always went on about how he needed to see something else than the same three streets.
Maybe Stark was lonely.
The weredog was still in his corner, still sleeping. He had been sleeping for a long time now. Was it something magical? Did he need much rest after turning into a human?
Tony looked down, breaking eye contact, mouth twitching down.
good.
He’s not an alcoholic, he just likes the taste of alcohol. It’s different.
Potts, as in the Great Magician Potts? The man that Steve hoped would help him?
“Hey, I’m sure you know him better than you think. You and Iron Man are good friends, are you not? Nothing has changed, now you just know who the pretty eyes behind the faceplate belong to.”
Steve was glad that Stark wasn’t intimidating like her, even for someone with his status, power and wealth. It felt like Stark was still down to earth somehow.
It took an embarrassingly long time for Steve to realise that the man facing him was none other than the former Sorcerer Supreme, Stephen Strange.
He left through the black door, Steve practically biting his nails as he realised that he was going to be alone in the castle with the very real possibility that the Witch would come knocking. There was Jarvis, too, but the fire demon looked as distressed as his master, the flames spluttering and changing colour, as if he didn’t know what to feel.
There was nothing out of place wherever Steve looked. What could possibly have targeted Jarvis alone?
The moon was full, thankfully, so he wouldn’t break his neck by tripping over some unseen rock.
“They are. I knew that she had cursed me when they first started to appear, years ago. I thought I had more time, but then the curse caught up with me, and now they’re growing faster. You’ve seen it yourself, they’re more widespread than a few weeks ago. They—they drain my energy, slowly but surely, and one day they’ll have taken everything I have, and I’ll be dead.”
. Years, and he hadn’t told anyone, had hid the marks behind a supposedly cosmetic spell, until Steve had barged in and exposed him inadvertently while cleaning his house. Had he been planning on never telling Jarvis about it? Not miss Potts, not King Rhodes, no one?
“Stark sent me to convince you not to make him court sorcerer. He said to tell you I’m a cousin of his, but we’re not related.”
Tony doesn’t know if Steve will be able to focus his anger at him, or if it will explode again, just as it has done before, and lead to another death.
And why exactly was Steve thinking that? It had nothing to do with Natasha, nor with anything important.
Into the time gem and Tony should get away but he killed Steve and he can’t move at all and the gem shatters and blows Tony away and
Tony spends precious time he doesn’t have looking at his sensors, trying to understand how much space he has.
The light fractured and shattered in front of him. Was light supposed to…oh, it was the ice.
He was trembling so badly that he couldn’t even stand up without help from his shield. He needed… He was so cold
It was nice, he thought, to have a nickname. It was quite flattering, too. Not to mention that no one had ever given Steve a nickname before (apart from his mother, of course, but that didn’t count). He could live with being called Cap.
Jarvis was surprised too, asking her what she was doing. Had Tony asked her to fetch something from the castle?
You never intended for me to find out, did you? You were perfectly happy lying to all of us, manipulating us, keeping information from us. You’d have done so until we all died in a blaze of glory, wouldn’t you?”
He needed to take a break, to gather his thoughts. Usually, he would take a long walk, or work at the docks, or exert himself. But he couldn’t do that anymore. Besides, any kind of physical effort only reminded him how weak he was, and he hated it. He wanted to find a large log and rip it in half, in an effort to release his anger and helplessness, but he was barely able to
“Good morning, sir fire demon.” He couldn’t be too careful with his manners. The fire demon looked amused, though, and crackled a bit before answering:
It descends into Steve’s outstretched hand, and settles there.
Steve didn’t have the energy to think about it. He just wanted—he just wanted—
“Tony. If our friendship ever meant anything to you, you’ll tell me what you’re thinking,
There was a knock at the door.
It was pretty, though.
“No, don’t worry, my home is your home, captain. Next time you want to fly a little, ask me, though. I don’t like letting people into my workshop unsupervised.”
He took Stark aside, thanking him again for the help with the heart. He also made sure to add, loudly enough that Cap would hear them: “I think you and Cap should talk about your feelings. They’re more reciprocal than you might believe.”
liked that idea.
“Well. This is embarrassing. I’m sorry for that tantrum down there. And… thank you for cleaning me up.”
on this. His entire body sings with it. He could do anything, right this moment, he’s unstoppable. This, this is what Tony needs. This is what he craves. This is the only food that will truly, deeply, satisfy him. He can’t get enough. He laps at the gauntlet, on the palm, between the fingers, sucking them down to the knuckles. He cleans the gauntlet, uncaring of the dirt and dust that comes with the blood. The blood is all he can taste anyway. It fills him up, lifts him higher than he’s ever been. It’s everything he imagined it would be, and more.
It’s mid-afternoon and Tony is alone in the team kitchen, sipping on a glass of water, looking out through the window. It’s a beautiful day.
Steve hurriedly took a cloth that had been left by a fleeing person and wrapped Tony in it. There was still no sign of the armour, it had to have been destroyed. Steve would thus need to carry Tony all the way home, but how would he do that? It had been hard enough to drag him from the kitchen to the bathroom, and now he’d have to walk uphill with a shield and an unconscious man to carry?
The green part of the circle led to the Hills.
“Jarvis, I meant to ask you. What did Tony give you in exchange for the contract?”
Steve didn’t really have a choice, did he? He had to help, since this was partially his fault. He braced himself for what was likely to be a painful journey to the bathroom. Steve wasn’t looking forward to carrying Stark, he could already feel his heart beating faster. Reluctantly, he put Stark’s arms around his shoulders, dragging him sideways from the stool. Stark was heavier than he looked. He was also more muscled than Steve would have thought. But he couldn’t ignore it now that he was touching the man. His arms, chest and abdomen were well-defined under the slime.
He’s wasted three minutes already.
He stands up, because if he goes down, at least he’ll go down with as much of his dignity as he can have, and because he won’t be able to tell Steve without an anchor, without touching him. So he walks over to Steve, and Steve stills, eyes on him, silently pleading him to tell him, and Tony breaks, because Steve isn’t even angry anymore, he’s just lost, and he doesn’t deserve to hear what Tony will tell him next, but he wanted to know, and Tony can’t deny him any longer.
“Yes, well, since Strange disappeared when he was sent to confront the Witch of the Waste after she threatened the King, the position is open. And the King wants me. But I really, really can’t accept his offer. So I’m going to ask for your help to convince him I’m not suited for the position. All right?”
Tony looked at him, eyes electric and inhuman. Gone was the darker glint, replaced by an alien glow. He was clad one of his suits, but instead of the familiar red and gold, it was colourless, shining silvery grey. Wisps of it slithered around and on him, hiding his body, infecting it, twisting him into someone that Steve couldn’t recognise. In place of his heart, there was a black hole with tendrils emerging from it. He’d coloured his hair black again, his teeth too sharp, hands turned into claws. The silver goo was enveloping him from head to toe.
What a pity. He’d hoped to meet the man that Natasha loved, because she’d never loved easily, much less used the word to describe her feelings towards anyone. This was the first time he’d heard about her talking about love, and he was curious to meet the man worthy of that affection. It would have to wait, however. Maybe he could help them when he got rid of his own curse?
“What, Cap, don’t you like me anymore? I thought you didn’t want me to die.”
Ultimately, Steve is only super-human.
Steve’s blood turned to ice.
He could pretend to be his own cousin, running the business while Steve Rogers was away on urgent business. His name couldn’t be Steve, though. Roger, maybe? Roger Stevens?
“I’m sorry. I think Stark should tell you himself.”
His hands are trembling, his head throbbing with a phantom pain. He locks down the workshop, locks down the whole tower, because he needs time to think, to figure this out, stop the time loop. He needs time before Steve comes in and tries to kill him.
The marks. The curse had to have something to do with the marks, Steve was sure of it. But what kind of curse was it?
Did she know what Tony had given Jarvis? Steve didn’t know what to think. Why did so many people around him know what he was thinking, what he was looking for? And how would he even find out?
Had Steve heard that right? Was Jarvis telling on him? He turned to Jarvis, outraged, but his budding anger turned to confusion as the fire demon made a puzzling grimace at him. What did he mean? Had Steve done something dangerous? Was this something Stark should know? And if so, why?
That was the moment Jarvis chose to wake up, crackling loudly in the peaceful moment, and effectively killing the mood.
Steve gripped his outstretched hand, barely appreciating the warmth and firmness of Stark’s hand before they crossed the threshold, the door closing behind them.
“It’s okay, we’ll work it out. Can you tell us why she kept you with her?”
Steve held out the cup, unsure of what to do now that it was evident that something was seriously wrong with the marks. Steve had suspected, of course, but it was another thing to see it confirmed.
There wasn’t any way that Steve could move the fight, he realised. Not without bodily throwing himself out there and dragging them to the land again. Which was a ridiculous notion. Because Steve wasn’t strong enough to drag two adults anywhere. If he’d been his old self, however…
Tony considered lying, but there was a good chance that the man behind the armour, or his possible acolytes, would recognize his face soon enough. Didn’t mean that Tony was going to tell him his whole life story, though. Maybe it didn’t seem like it, but Tony was on a top secret mission.
But Tony didn’t have shrapnel in his heart. He stared at the paper, throat tight. There wasn’t a guarantee that it would work. But, God, he had something that might help him. Getting thrown here was already more than worth the pain. Jarvis would be overjoyed. Hell, Tony himself was clutching the paper to his chest, heart beating painfully against the plate. This was possibly going to change his life. He didn’t know how to thank Stark.
Steve cut him off, he wasn’t important, what was important was Tony’s health.
Tony slipped on the wet stone, stumbled into the wall, and fell head-first into the opening in front of him. He reflexively let go of everything he was carrying to soften the fall, but that meant that the torch snuffed itself out as it came in contact with the ground, and Tony was plunged in darkness. He pushed himself up with a groan, his chest aching at the sudden motion. He had to light the torch again. There was no time. He fumbled for his gun, half-formed thoughts about powder and sparks battling with a rising sense of dread. There was almost no time, a few seconds at most. He glanced around in desperation, hoping for a miracle, and stopped short at the sight of a thin ray of moonlight shining on the damp surface to his left. As he watched, the ray ever so slightly shifted, and Tony knew he’d found the
