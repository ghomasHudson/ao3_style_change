No, I am not in heaven.
“Room 24, here are the keys,” the innkeeper smiled, and gestured to the stairs.
“Now, shall we try the whole thing at once?” Sherlock said, his arm already around John’s waist.
“Nicely dipped,” Sherlock said, straightening his back, retuning to his normal height.
“Okay, let’s just keep calm, relax, Sherlock, look at me,” John said as he locked eyes with Sherlock.
“No, we are not saying goodbyes, not now, remember, we would go to that bar that you liked when we finished this case? I said I would pay for it, I said we could…” Sherlock said as tears swirled in his eyes, but he bowed his head, understanding that fantasy is not reality.
John kissed him gently on the forehead at last, both of their breathing fast paced and breathy.
Quickly placing his hand on the trackpad, Sherlock clicked to the former tab that was open.
He felt his stomach tighten as depression kicked in. The feeling of falling down, down, down... and never getting up. He closed his eyes, but immediately saw the shadows and the writhing outline of John.. the psychotic, wicked smile that hung on Moriarty’s face.
“Just one.”
Sherlock slammed the room’s door shut with a bang.
“Yes, or do you want to end up here again?”
Taking in a deep breath, I shifted my position so that I could lay down in the tub. I looked at my surroundings one last time. To die in 221B. A perfect way to finish my story.
“Hello? We’re trapped in an elevator,”
Wiping cold sweat from his forehead with the back of his palm hastily, he grimaced as he tried to divert himself from his terrifying thoughts. What if they never got out? What if they were stuck here and the firemen couldn’t get them out? What if the lift started falling down? What if… what if…
"I'm sorry for not being grateful. All the time. I must be such a pain to live wit-" Sherlock said, but let out a gasp as John dove into his arms. Slowly, he wrapped his arms around him.
“Do what?” Sherlock said, his voice still a little husky.
Calm down. Calm down.
He stood there, still trying to process it.
Sherlock got back to 221B, the light in his eyes faded to a bleak stare, as he sat on his chair, wrapping his thick coat around him, John’s aura still clinging to it.  He stared into the distance meaninglessly, letting his vision lose its focus.
“Fine.” Sherlock snapped, stomping out of his chair.
"Yes, what? I was thinking we could stay in the inn for a night to celebrate..." Sherlock whined, training his puppy eyes on John.
“That’s great. You know what that means?” John asked.
He curled up in the middle of the bed, stroking the duvet and humming to himself. Rolling onto his back, he sniffled as tears fell from his eyes, sliding down to the pillow.
“Useless Sherlock, how many times have you not solved my crimes? You wouldn’t have lived if it wasn’t for your big brother,” Moriarty said, circling me.
“Sherlock?!” John said frantically.
Even though having therapy sessions can be tedious, I know it’s for the benefit of me. John and Lestrade give me cases, I’m allotted to do simple crime investigations if I’m well.
“How are you so sure- I- I’m just so-“
within 5 minutes, he found his spare keys in the garden, under a garden gnome. Smirking, he tried to use the keys on his front door, his hands starting to feel numb as he shakily inserted the key into the door.
"I'll check on him now. Thank you- Mycroft," Mrs Hudson uttered, as she put down the phone and dashed up to Sherlock's flat. The door squeaked, as Mrs Hudson peeked into the room, to see Sherlock staring into the distance, his eyes reduced to slits.
“Sherlock, you’re going home soon, did you hear that?” John said as he rubbed Sherlock’s shoulder gently.
Several minutes later Sherlock broke the kiss and the two men leaned on each other, breathing heavily. “You’re a bloody idiot,” Sherlock managed through ragged breaths. “How long?”
“Yes, love?”
John paused momentarily. He couldn’t very well just ask Sherlock after that comment. What if Sherlock turned out to be straight? It would completely ruin this small friendship -was it a friendship?- that they had formed. “Well if it’s that simple a question, why don’t you answer it?” That would work, not too obvious.
John forced his eyes up from his feet to look at Sherlock’s glass blue ones and it gave him all of the courage he needed. “It’s you, Sherlock.”
“Boring,” Sherlock mumbled against the doctor’s neck as he continued his ministrations.
John quickly hopped from the bed to grab the tube from the drawer before returning to his position between the younger man’s legs. He slicked up his fingers and dragged his index finger from Sherlock’s balls to his tight hole and circled it gently, watching the other man squirm beneath him. “Is this okay?” John asked hesitantly.
John’s already flushed cheeks turned a shade darker as he mumbled his reply into his friend’s shoulder.
Sherlock had had lovers in the past of course, back in University, but the high from the relationships was quickly replaced in his life by the drugs which now were replaced the work. The work was what kept Sherlock sane, without it he would surely still be making countless reckless decisions in order to keep his mind occupied.
"Keep me posted, yeah?" The DI said.
Sherlock’s vision went black for several seconds. He had had lovers in the past and it had entailed blowjobs, but the knowledge that it was John’s mouth around his cock made everything that much more exhilarating. Time seemed to be standing still, the only movement that mattered was the slow, wet drag of John’s lips up and down his length and the flick of John’s tongue over the tip each time. Sherlock tugged against the scarf that held his wrists captive, he could easily slip out of the soft material, but he had absolutely no wish to do so.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide and his lips fell open slightly. “John,” he whispered softly.
“You know I don’t have a regular sleep schedule, I’ll be fine,” Sherlock responded, looking at his fried with a great deal of concern.
“It’s okay. I didn’t mean to pry or be rude. I guess I’ve just had a long day,” John sighed, thankful Sherlock had broken the tension.
Sherlock adjusted the water temperature until it was satisfactory before turning back to the older man. Sherlock gently removed John’s clothing trying not to make the moment seem to intimate, but not wanting to rush him either. When John was stripped down Sherlock walked him over to the shower and stepped in behind him, still fully clothed.
The younger man threw his head back with a loud moan and another firm drag of his nails down the doctor’s back. John was certain that Sherlock had drawn blood with the last one but couldn’t bring himself to care as he repeated the motion. He was angling his hips just so that he barely grazed Sherlock’s prostate with each trust, driving the younger man to the brink of insanity.
~To be continued… maybe~
John flinched a little at the threat, it wasn’t like Sherlock to be so hostile. “Sorry, I was trying to be a good person. I’ll just stop then,” John snapped before rising from the desk to gather the materials for the lab and remained silent.
John slid Sherlock’s length out of his mouth and looked up at him for a moment. “Do you have lube?”
After several moments of lying silently in eachothers’ arms Sherlock spoke again, “John?”
John smiled cockily into the younger man’s neck and shifted his hips forward, not stopping until he was buried deep inside of his lover.
Sherlock cleared his throat, he knew he had no reason to feel nervous, but still, the feeling persisted, “Go on a date with me?”
“Sherlock, stop this right now,” John’s voice was bordering on anger and it took Sherlock by surprise enough to make him look down at the army doctor. “It is not your fault, Sherlock. Mary made the decision to save your life for a reason. Mary saved your life because-” John’s throat closed up a little, was he really going to do this right now? “She saved your life because she knew. She’s always known.”
What Sherlock did not know though, was that every Friday the rugby team would hang out behind the wall and joke around, reading some of the fresh ink. And it just so happened that only an hour after Sherlock had left, Mike Stamford discovered the tiny scribble.
And this is how the detective found himself in an upscale club in central London with his lips attached to those of an attractive blonde- who he was trying to convince himself he was attracted to for reasons other than his similarities to his flatmate.
Around noon the next day, Sherlock was aware. He couldn't move and he couldn't speak. But he was aware. And he felt the hand that was holding his. He was confused. Who would be doing such an intimate thing? And to him, of all people?
“John, I’m the reason that your wife is dead. I had to do what I’ve always done and act clever even when everyone told me to stop. And now Mary is dead because she saved my life.” John could see a couple tears trailing down the detectives jaw and he went to speak, but Sherlock beat him to it. “She shouldn’t have done it. You need her.”
“Sshhhh,” John soothed the younger man, running his hands up and down the sides if his narrow body, “I’m going to take care of you, Sherlock.” John, true to his word, leaned down and took the entirely of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth, the tip hitting the back of his throat as he fought back his gag reflex.
John smiled brilliantly, “I don’t think I’ll ever tire of hearing you say that. I love you too, Sherlock.”
“John, I’m going to help you bathe, is that okay?” Sherlock placed his hand on John’s cheek to move his head up so he could look into the vacant blue eyes of his best friend. John simply nodded and returned his eyes back to his downward glance.
“Nothing. I didn’t mean to say that. I suppose my brain is exhausted,” Sherlock tried to brush it off.
The doctor smirked into his lover’s skin. He, John Watson, had reduced the great Sherlock Holmes to a moaning and mess beneath him. “What do you need?” he teased, his breath ghosting over the younger man’s nipple.
“Sherlock,” John spoke, his voice rough. It had felt like hours later when the sobs had subsided and Sherlock had thought his companion had fallen asleep. It appeared his was wrong.
“A while,” John managed, this time looking into the younger man’s eyes.
John sighed, “Mike. Of course it was Mike.” John took the flier and ran down the hall to Mike’s locker, looking for the boy with murder on his mind. When he finally found him John shouted, “Mike! Why on Earth would you do this without talking to me?”
Sherlock froze momentarily, eyes wide, before melting into the kiss and taking John’s lower lip between his teeth and biting softly, forgetting the man he had abandoned in the hallway. After several moments the kiss broke and both men pulled away breathless, leaning their foreheads together.
When he was spent, John collapsed onto the bed next to his detective. They were both breathing erratically and they looked at each other, eyes full of admiration for the other. “You,” John struggled through heavy breaths, “are amazing, Sherlock Holmes.”
“You heard me,” John retorted, looking down at his lover with his best Captain Watson smile. He leaned in closer, kissing up the man’s bruised neck until he reached his ear. “Your Captain told you to say please. I want you to beg for my cock, Sherlock. One little word and I’ll fuck you until you can’t move,” John whispered filthily in his ear. He continued his mantra as he licked and bit down the detective’s neck, relishing in the moans but making no attempt to progress any further as he waited.
John rested his elbows on his knees gripping his phone in both of his hands tapping his thumbs on the screen waiting for a reply. But after 15 minutes without one he stood up. "Mary I'm going to check on Sherlock, I don't know when I'll be home, don't wait up." He called pulling on his coat before sending another text reading. "I'm on my way over -JW"
It was several minutes later when Sherlock finally pulled away, “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.”
John just barely nodded. His wife.... yeah. John had one of those, didn't he. Bloody hell he'd screwed up.
John had always enjoyed science, in fact he intended to pursue a medical degree in University, so it came as no surprise that John was always excited to go to biology class on lab days. Except it wasn’t his favorite class because of the academics, but rather the fact whom his lab partner was.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, unsure that he was understanding correctly.
The other boy’s eyes went wide, he hadn’t expected the anger. “I-I just thought that you would want to know.”
Sherlock stood straight again, removing his gaze from the microscope and turning toward his lab partner. “I happen to be gay, John.”
John laughed a little, “Unsettling? No, not at all.” John paused for a moment and pulled his head back from the microscope to allow Sherlock a turn. When Sherlock was no longer looking at him John gathered the courage to finish his thought. “I just feel bad for the bloke because I already have feelings for someone else.”
John’s hands were clenched into the sheets as he tried desperately to keep himself from grabbing Sherlock’s curls and shoving his cock down the detective’s throat until he choked. He did however save that thought for another time. When Sherlock’s gentle caresses had finally reached the tip, he switched to long and soft licks, making John’s body jerk with the sensation. “Sherlock, please,” John begged.
Sherlock was slipping deeper and deeper into the darkness. Even within his deep subconscious, he could sense that he had only so long left. He hoped when someone found him that it wouldn't be John or Mrs. Hudson. That was the last thing that he wanted.
“W-we should talk,” John gasped, fighting desperately to keep his mind clear enough to think properly.
John looked into his lover’s eyes, so full of emotion behind the arousal, and gasped. “I love you too, Sherlock Holmes. Of course I’m sure.”
“Oh, sod off,” Sherlock breathed, his breath hitching as John quickly inserted his finger the rest of the way and crooked it to brush the detective’s prostate. He waited only momentarily before removing the finger entirely and reinserting it beside a second, pushing them in as far as was possible. Sherlock hissed at the suddenness but it turned quickly into a moan as the pain melted away into pleasure. “Now that’s what I was expecting from Captain John Watson,” Sherlock smirked, watching as John’s pupils dilated. “Oh, do you like me calling attention to your rank, Captain?” Sherlock’s voice twisted seductively around the title, observing once again how John’s body reacted. This was going to be fun.
Lestrade burst through the door of the flat to find John sobbing as he was hunched over Sherlock. Just behind him was two men with a stretcher.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, walking back across the room to his friend, coming much closer than the older man had expected.
When John was dry Sherlock quickly pulled his sopping wet shirt from his body and wrapped the towel around his head in an attempt to minimize the amount of water that would trail the floor as he led John to bed. When they arrived in Sherlock’s bedroom, the detective handed him a pair of lounge pants and a t-shirt before tending to himself, grabbing clothing and returning to the bathroom to change. When he returned the towel had been abandoned and his wet curls laid in a mess atop his head. John was seated on the bed, looking up at his companion now, but he still looked lost.
John reached up and untied his lover’s wrists, moaning when the hands went directly to his back and nails dragged firmly down his back. John pulled out torturously slow before snapping his hips back with an obscenely loud noise at his hips made contact with Sherlock’s arse.
“Fine,” Sherlock looked up at him this time and John saw why Sherlock had been unwilling to turn his head previously. It looked as though the boy had been crying.
Sherlock vaguely felt pressure on his lips. Had...had someone kissed him? He was very confused. Was he imagining all this?
John pulled back slightly to look into Sherlock’s eyes, “What do you mean, how long?”
The men remained in silence for several minutes, only the sound of their breathing between them. Sherlock slowly tipped his head down so his nose was almost touching John’s now dry hair and inhaled slowly, John had always calmed him simply by existing. Sherlock dedicate the smell of John’s fresh washed hair to his memory, safe keeping for the next time he was feeling overwhelmed by the world around him. John centered him. Brought him back to reality. Sherlock had always hoped that something greater would develop between him and his best friend, but after the fall, after he had betrayed his friend so greatly, nothing had ever been the same and the possibility faded away with Sherlock’s hope. John had fallen in love while he was gone and Sherlock had stood aside as the only person he had ever loved got married and started a family.
“God, Captain,” Sherlock moaned. “John just fuck me already. I’ll be okay,” he begged.
John Watson on the other hand had never been one to hesitate in the realm of romance or sexuality. This of course changed entirely when he fell in love with Sherlock Holmes. But could one really blame him? Sherlock had told him up front that he considered himself “married to his work” and denied advances that he hadn’t even been making at the time. The reason John normally had such a sense of self-confidence was because he had rarely ever been turned down, his charming yet domineering Captain John Watson persona had never failed him before, but how was he supposed to confidently pursue a man who had made it quite clear that he was not interested?
Sherlock very slightly heard his phone go off through the haze of his mind. Part of him knew it was John and that John was probably worrying. But another part of him said that thinking that was irrational. John didn't care. John had left him. Sherlock took another hit of a drug he couldn't remember the name of. The name didn't matter. It helped the pain.
It took several minutes. Both men were on their backs staring at the ceiling when Sherlock gave in and placed a hand softly on John’s shoulder. It seemed as though the dam broke with that because in an instant John’s face was pressed to the younger man’s chest and violent sobs were released as his body shook violently. Sherlock wrapped his arms around the doctor, one hand going to card fingers gently through John’s hair. Sherlock made no attempt to speak, he just remained a solid presence for the doctor to rely on.
John burst through the door. "Sherlock?" he looked around to find Sherlock on the couch. "Oh god... Sherlock!" He rushed to his side, oh no... He shoved his fingers into the others pulse point feeling for something, anything. There was a heartbeat. It was faint, but it was there. "God Sherlock! Can you hear me? Sherlock!"
Sherlock immediately stopped his ministrations and pulled away from the blonde’s neck and looked at him with wide eyes. “What’s wrong?”
The next day as John was arriving at school he received a text message from Mike Stamford. The rugby captain looked at it for several moments trying to understand what he meant. ‘You’re Welcome’ was all that it said. John quickly tapped out a response before grabbing his bag and heading into the school.
“Are you okay, Sherlock?” John asked, voice full of concern.
“That’s the thing Mike, I don’t even know if he fancies blokes,” John whispered.
The beeping heart monitor proved Sherlock could hear him. John chuckled. "You're going to be alright. Don't strain yourself." John yawned and tangled his fingers in Sherlock's. "I'm sorry, I'm so stupid."
John waited in the lobby. Lestrade had been sitting with him for a bit, but he had to get home to his wife as it was getting late.
The moment their lips met both men knew that things were going to work out. Their lives would continue on. The pain, the heartache, the loss, would all be manageable so long as they had each other.
"I can't feel your aorta."
“It’s a neat fiction that works in two directions,” Sherlock said.  “For all that I am proficient in duplicity, I believe I tell the truth far more often than the two of them combined, if you count their lies of omission.”
“It was a pleasant time,” Sigeursonn continued. He turned towards John, looking him up and down where he sat with the egg on his upon his lap.  John thought of setting the egg aside so he could stand up and shake hands properly, but he didn’t want to be seen as too cavalier with the egg.
"We'll both have to become more accustomed to having people in the flat.  The incubation of a new egg is generally a fairly social time, with the broader community coming together, as one of the parents is always out of commission.  In our case it will be Mycroft, Mummy, and perhaps one or two of the cousins who will be looking in on us."
“Then we should consider Johannah too, fairly close to your name meaning, and a similar sound.”
“Not with the way you’re covering her,” Annborg said.  “You’ve got about ten minutes though before she starts asking for food.”
“We can wait,” John said.
Sherlock shrugged, tilting his head up as he sipped at his cup.  The overall effect was that he looked like a reclining bird of some sort, perhaps an ibis, and John choked back a laugh at how appropriate that was.
And now, only hours after the man’s wife had died, Sherlock had almost thought it appropriate to make a love confession. Not one of his best moments.
Sherlock had never once in his life begged to be fucked. It always tended to be the other way around, he liked to have men beg for him. Make them plead until he fucked them or let them fuck him. Other men had been more than willing to do so, desperate in their wanting, sometime it had even seemed too easy.
Sherlock was lying on the couch, blacked out. He had felt it coming and welcomed it with open arms. Nothing mattered any more. The only man he would ever care about didn't care about him. At least not in the same way. Not in the way he wanted him too. He didn't want to live without John there with him. He just simply could not.
“I just wanted to ask you something and I didn’t want to do it in class,” John cleared his throat awkwardly. This was it. Be brave, Watson. “Sherlock, I- the person I have feelings for-” John kept his eyes to the ground unable to look the dark haired boy in the eyes.
Sherlock hid his face in John’s neck to hide the blush that that was so present it was travelling down his neck, “Maybe.”
“Of course I had to, John. I couldn’t leave you like that, I-” Sherlock quickly halted himself, he definitely couldn’t say that right now.
“Oh,” John whispered with what Sherlock was sure he was misinterpreting as disappointment.
John rolled his eyes at the snarky comment but really couldn’t bring himself to care that much. The view he was enjoying now was better than anything he had ever seen. He trailed his strong hands up Sherlock’s smooth legs and to his hips, gripping them tightly and guiding him as he lifted and lowered his hips. “You’re beautiful like this, Sherlock,” John breathed.
“Hey, John,” a student came to stand near him as he spoke, John thought his name was Jeff, but honestly he wasn’t sure. “Did you make these?” The boy handed John a flier that had a large image of what appeared to be the confession wall, but it was the writing in the photograph that caught John’s attention. Underneath the photograph someone had typed ‘If this is you or you know who this is, please contact Mike Stamford. Information will be rewarded.’
They arrived at the hospital and Sherlock was wheeled into the ER as fast as the men and women's feet would take them. John however wasn't allowed to follow.
“Well, I don’t know, John ‘I’m Not Gay’ Watson. How could that message possibly have been misinterpreted?” Sherlock teased.
“Yes, John. Fine. I should be the one asking you that.”
Everything suddenly clicked in John’s head and he felt a sudden and intense surge of jealousy. Sherlock had clearly not been expecting him because he was bringing someone into the flat. Someone who was responsible for the state of Sherlock’s appearance. John cleared his throat awkwardly, “uh, I was just uh... “ he stood and set the paper down on the table, “going to bed.”
It was John, John in his doctor uniform.
"I wanted.. to check on my brother," Mycroft said, choosing his words carefully.
I pushed the stool away, my jaw was immediately jerked upwards, the pain spiking through my whole body, taking away my breath, as I let out a yelp, the whine escaping through my trembling lips, my feet trying to find the floor. I pulled on the noose with my hand, scraping my neck, oxygen escaping from my whole body. I exhaled, the pain like a million knives stabbed into my body then slowly pulled out with a flourished jerk, oxygen snapped out of me.
John’s neck. Writhing in agony, John whimpered, the blood flowing from his left temple.
I blinked, and felt the blood boil in my veins as Moriarty got closer to me.
“Yeah? I’m- im fine,” Sherlock mumbled, throttling out a few fake chuckles.
“Sherlock, behave, or I’m dragging you to the clinic.” John said firmly as Sherlock threw away his blanket and stumbled to the toilet. He banged the door shut as he coughed and almost choked on his bile, not reaching the closed toilet quick enough. He coughed into the sink, and the red tinge of blood in his cough slowly disappeared down it. Blood was never good. He knew that. He heard John trying to unlock the door, banging on it.
“Goodbye, John. Do not come to find me.
“No, I don’t know what- what do I do? He’s not responding to me and I- Like I-“ Sherlock stuttered, his voice breaking, his tears streaming down his face.
“Dear John,
It was mid-afternoon as John and Sherlock headed to a restaurant and picked up some sandwiches and snacks, walking down to the meadow, the birds chirping and the flowers gently tipping from the wind. Laying a cloth under a tree, they sat down and ate their lunch.
Walking up the stairs, he gently pushed John’s former bedroom door open. The bed was made, the bedsheets were still John’s. The room was empty.
"Well that's it guys, cased closed, thanks Sherlock," Lestrade said cheerily.
Yes. I had to kill myself.
“Coming right over,” Mycroft said.
“Your medication,”
“Now, tell me why did you find me in the wee hours of the morning without notice.” John said as he perched on the side of the sofa.
Flashes of light, blinding me. The ringing in my ears so deafening I can't hear anything else. I can't move, as my arms struggled against something restricting me. I can't breathe.
“Hypothermia,” Mary mumbled. “I think it’s hypothermia, cold, shivering, breathing rapidly and slurred speech! He’s just wearing his overcoat and a t-shirt, of course he got hypothermia! It’s minus one degrees outside!”
I flicked the army knife open, and ripped my shirt’s cuff open with my other hand, to reveal those deep red scars that impinged my skin in stripes. With precision, I sunk the knife into the outer layer of my skin. I felt the blinding pain of the knife entering my skin, and the numbness and emptiness I felt was replaced by strong feelings that made my head burst. I heard the voices in my head abuse me.
“Damn being off duty, I’ll pay you double,” John demanded.
I hear the beeping noise of a machine, the rhythm irrational, exactly like my heartbeat, thumping hard.
“Two hours?! Seriously? Fine,” John spat, his brows knit together in annoyance.
"What?" Mrs Hudson said, not entirely believing Mycroft now. "When? How?"
“Now try me,” Sherlock said, fixing John’s hand on his back.
Receiving the lukewarm mug from John’s fingertips, he took a sip as John went into his room and got a thick blanket, coming back to remove Sherlock’s overcoat before tucking him in the blanket, its fringes almost dropping to the floor. He sat on the arm of the chair, smoothing Sherlock’s hair to the back, and fixed a curl that bounded out of place.
“I. Am. Fine.” Sherlock growled.
“Christ, Mary’s in this house, not now!” John said, pushing him back but he couldn’t resist, leaning in himself to kiss him. Pulling back, he looked at Sherlock’s handsomely chiselled face, the features softening, those eyes, as sharp as an eagles, looked vulnerable and relaxed for the first time.
“You just lean back when I relax my arm, I will not drop you.” Sherlock purred.
“No,” Sherlock said turning away from the cup. “My throat hurts,”
“No, I’m off duty,” the driver repeated.
The defined sounds of fine leather shoes echoed through the space.
“Give me- a- minute,” Sherlock sputtered, as he coughed hard, trying to breathe normally.
In a rage, he stifled his cries by burying his head in his lap, his hands tugging at his hair. The memories of being in the hospital never, ever go away.
Triggered by my memories, I let out a gasp of terror, letting the bloody knife slip from my hands to the floor.
“Yeah,” Sherlock whispered, rearranging his pillows.
“That was part of the choreography,” Sherlock said, the ends of his lips starting to form a smile.
“Kiss me,” Sherlock whispered, and closed his eyes. Letting out a sigh, John bent down and kissed Sherlock on the lips, diving in again and again.
John’s dead.
“I don’t know- I- I just-“ John stuttered.
“Sherlock? Are you okay?” John asked in a drowsy voice as he plodded down to the living room.
“It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m going to call.. I’m calling..” Sherlock stuttered, the words falling out of his mouth in a disoriented heap, as he took out his phone and called 999.
The thumping of my heart increased, I feel like I'm being strangled.
Mycroft jumped up from his seat, startled, and began dialling a number on his other phone.
With one hand, I violently rubbed my face, getting rid of the tear stain, but what I really wanted to rub away was my sentiment.
“Okay, we’ll send along an ambulance, keep doing CPR until the paramedics arrive, thank you,” the operator said calmly.
They danced around the flat, John felt his gaze meet Sherlock’s, his eyes a shade of dark green in the dim light, his curly hair bobbing. John felt Sherlock’s pull him closer, hold his hand tighter, their feet moving in unison. As the dance ended, John dipped Sherlock gracefully. Sherlock was pulled back up, both of their breathing fast-paced, their chests rising and falling rapidly, the gaze they shared intensified. Sherlock leaned in, kissing John on the lips for a few seconds, letting go of them reluctantly.
“Mmm,” Sherlock mumbled, stifling his whimpering.
“You’re not making sense. I am calling it now.” John said as he dialled 999.
“I’m sorry that I didn’t notice earlier,”
—————————————
As he stretched out his arm to feel his forehead’s temperature, Sherlock’s hand snapped around John’s wrist, slightly twisting it.
“You’re not okay,” John said, Sherlock sensing the tinge of panic in his voice.
You’re nothing.
Need to breathe.
“You’re always saying you aren’t gay, you don’t like men, in front of other people, when both you and me know that we’re meant for each other! HAVE YOU EVER- THOUGHT- WHAT I FEEL ABOUT IT?” Sherlock snapped, crashing into the toilet, locking the door behind him, as John heard him whimper and scream.
He felt the pain that he felt in that terrifying ordeal again, his lungs burning, and breathed strenuously, clawing and gripping his chest, beads of sweat trickling down from his hair. He heard his heart monitor beep rapidly and irregularly, making him panic even more. He felt John dabbing at his sweat, slicking his sodden fringe from his forehead.
The gesture calmed Sherlock, as he closed his eyes, and slipped into a fretful slumber.
What is wrong with you?
“WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?”
“We’ll start now. Lesson number one,” Sherlock said, extending his arm for John to get up. “You trust me, right? I promise I won’t make a fool out of you.” He said, his eyes softening.
“I- could teach you.”
What is this place?
“I-im sorry,” he muttered, guiltily looking at the toilet floor that was stained with his vomit. He felt dizzy, as he clutched his chest, coughing again and again.
"Sherlock, you have to change out of this coat,” She said, wringing his arms away.
“She-Sherlock Holmes,” John stuttered.
“No one deserves to forget the feeling of a hug,” John said as he stared into Sherlock’s emerald eyes.
Letting out a scream, I dug my fingernails into the scalp of my head, feeling the greasy touch of my unwashed hair slip through my fingers.
“Get well soon,” Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, laying his head on his shoulder.
“Seriously?” John shouted, as he rapidly pressed the floor number.
"This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful ... really useful..." John mocked, quoting Sherlock.
“Learn how to hold your partner. You do this, and- this.” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand and placing one on his own waist, the other one gently entwined around his hand.
I can’t let John know. Always overreacting and feeling sympathetic for me. I don’t need that.
“Why did you do it?” John asked Sherlock, who laid on his lap on the sofa, as John read a book.
John woke up from dozing off on the couch with a start, hearing the buzz of his phone from the coffee table.
“Alright?”
Where is John? Where is he?
Sherlock’s POV
My hands trembled, my knees knocking against each other, as I unraveled the rope. I was terrified. Yet I needed to do this.
After 5 minutes, they were gone. I felt chills over his body, my breathing rapid. Cold sweat broke out on my back.
“Finally, John! I got an interesting case, I’ve got so much to tell you about…” Sherlock said as he erupted through the door of their flat.
“I really do want to kiss you but you’re not well enough,” John mumbled sheepishly, letting out a slight chuckle.
The water spilled out of the tub, Sherlock barely noticing until it reached his shoes. Snapping back to life, he turned off the tap hastily, sloshing into the water as he poured into the soap. He shivered as he sinked into the tub, chills slithering up and down his body.
“Gasp!” Sherlock woke up, beads of sweat dripping down his temples, feeling the dampness of his pillow. His curly hair stuck to his skin, greasy and wet.
“Stupid Sherlock,”
“Sherlock.” John shouted. “Go take a bath.”
“I guess you have to type the blog now,” John joked, looking ruefully at his bandaged hand.
"I do, and all the times you just ask me to spy on your brother! Don't you have better things to do? Mycroft Holmes-"
I took out a piece of sturdy rope from the cupboard, for I used it for an experiment a while back.
“John? Whats- Sherlock?” Mary said, emerging from the bedroom.
“It’s not your fault. I’m an idiot, I- let you down. I can’t let you blame yourself, John…” Sherlock said in a rasping tone, his vocals still strained from the drowning. Slowly, Sherlock reached up and wiped away a tear from John’s face with a delicate swipe of his swift finger, and fingered John’s damp cheeks.
Electric shock!
"Yes, thank you," John said as he climbed out of the elevator, with a disgruntled Sherlock following him.
“I can manage, go away,” Sherlock said, getting up from his chair, as he stumbled, holding onto the bookshelf, breathing quickly.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered.
—————
“Gosh, if Mary saw what you did,” John said playfully as he put his hands on Sherlock’s.
"Oh, shut up," Sherlock said, bumping his shoulder at John.
“JOHN!” Sherlock screamed as he saw John stumbling and leaning on the wall, falling to the ground slowly with every laborious breath he took. He fell the the ground, cold sweat rolling down his face, clutching his abdomen, his shirt stained with deep red blood.
"No, what?" John said, confused.
So I’ll go to him.
Saying nothing, John hugged him again, even more passionately and warmly.
I hope this chapter wrenched your heart out of your chest and threw it on the ground and shattered it
“That isn’t needed- I’m a doctor,” John said, scouting his pockets for his medical ID, handing it to the doctor.
“It’s nothing,” John said, smiling as he turned to get Sherlock’s bag.
“Now, try holding me,” Sherlock said, his arms slightly tilted forward.
Unmoving, Sherlock blinked.
Arriving at John’s street, he couldn’t feel his legs anymore. He slowly made his way to his house, snow starting to float daintily all around him.
Two hours. Christ. How was he going to survive that? The walls felt like they were towering and closing over him second by second, the light was way too bright, blinding him, the blood rushing in his head, he could hear it. He could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage, thumping harder and harder. His throat felt like it was gripped. Tightly.
“Take my hand, you can grip it if you feel nervous or scared, I promise, it’ll help,” John whispered as he slipped his hand in Sherlock’s. The gesture made Sherlock stop in his tracks, as he tenderly wrapped his cold fingers around John's.
One last time.
It was only a 10 minute walk to John’s house, so he decided to take the trudge and started walking on the dark and empty street.
Electric cable.
As he set to leave Sherlock to sleep, he felt Sherlock grip onto his fingers.
Wait.
“For better or for worse, in sickness or in health,” John whispered.
I violently tried to grip his neck, but he disappeared into thin air again. Frustrated, I scratched my arm that was ridden with cuts and fading specks of former injection sites, rimmed with dark blue veins.
“IVE GOT IT!” John yelled, his voice muffled by his coat as he thrusted the door of the flat open, both of them stumbling into the corridor, wheezing and coughing. Sherlock laid onto the wall behind him, having taken in the worst of the fumes in the room that the criminal left behind to buy himself time.
“You sure?” John asked, his hand on his back, gently rubbing it in circles.
“Sherlock, don’t fall asleep, it’ll only make it worse,” John said crisply, taking off his overcoat, which was drenched with the damp rain and snow, and wrapping his dressing gown over him, and turning up the heater.
He gargled water from the tap and spit it out, trying to get rid of the taste.
Feeling as if his eyelids were made of iron, Sherlock didn’t even have the energy to look at John.
—————
"Better?" John whispered, his softened eyes unlocking Sherlock's cold and precise ones, those pupils that jerked at every direction to take in information, were still and focused and John's.
I used all my strength to gently crease my lips upward, forming a smile, as my eyelids felt like lead, fluttering shut for the last time as death swept me away from the world.
“Address?”
“He’s been quite fine last night, didn’t hyperventilate or cough up a lot of mucus,” John said, eyeing Sherlock who had one eye open.
“Mate.. you okay?” John’s gentle voice soothed his ears.
“Did he drown?”
“All right. Call 999, I’m coming over, I’m just 5 minutes away from Baker Street,” Lestrade said calmly.
“T-thanks,” John muttered as he let the phone drop to the ground, and continued chest compressions.
He turned around to the tub. To see the thing he feared the most. Sherlock. Unmoving.
“See and not observe, yeah.” John said aggressively, rolling his eyes.
Sherlock giggled, his face and ears blushing with redness.
Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night, heaving and gasping for air. He felt that as if someone was wrenching on his neck. It was so painful to breathe. He tried to sit up with all the energy he could muster, just barely propped himself up halfway before falling onto the bed again. He felt nauseous, and gulped some saliva down his throat. He clutched his chest as he tried really, really hard to breathe normally and without pain. He winced in pain as breathing got no easier. Grabbing a tissue from the bedside table, he heaved up a cough, which hurt his throat even more. Black specks started to form in his eyesight as he tried to breathe normally. The sweat trickled down his neck. Heaving up a final cough, he looked down at the tissue.
“I know.. John’s.. passed away.. but you still have to eat and drink,” Mrs Hudson said, trying to comfort Sherlock, who was breathing shakily.
By now, John stopped coughing, clearing his throat, as he saw Sherlock still hacking and wheezing, his face turning red from the exertion. “Mate? You okay?” John asked.
“Just a sip,” John encouraged.
"Not really," Sherlock mumbled as he gently led a butterfly up his hand from a flower. "Isn't it gorgeous? It's a painted jezebel," He said as he observed the butterfly closely, letting it fly away.
“It’s mostly gone,” Sherlock said as he set John’s mug on the table, the smoke wafting in the air in pale white wisps.
“No.”
Oh God.
"Mrs Hudson, you don't und-"
What now?
“Will you be with me?” Sherlock said, sitting up, his gaze turning to John.
He could hear every click his leather shoes made on the whitewashed floor, gathering speed as he reached John’s bed.
“No.”
“Alright then.. call the nurse if you or Mr Holmes needs anything,” the doctor said, leaving John and Sherlock alone.
We would be reunited.
“John?” Mrs Hudson squealed in surprise by the bang of the front door, John rushing in and scaling the stairs rapidly.
Check out the next chapter!! I hope you liked this chapter :)
“You promise?” Sherlock said.
"Fine," John said, smirking, raising his hand to playfully ruffle Sherlock's hair.
Without hesitation, Sherlock dove in, cupping John's face in his palms as they kissed. Letting go, Sherlock laid on John’s lap, closing his eyes as John stroked his hair, lulling him to sleep.
“Go to sleep now,” John said, smiling sympathetically, as he gently kissed Sherlock on the cheek, and put his hand on top of Sherlock’s.
The door creaked as he gently shut it behind himself, closing his eyes and taking in a deep breath.
“Splendid, now, left foot, walk forward, and turn..” Sherlock tutored, leading John to the right steps.
“Did you like that?” Sherlock asked John, his eyes glinting with mischief.
“Not to worry,” Sherlock said, heading over to the windows and closing their dusty curtains.
“Okay,” John said, concerned.
"Mm, text me if you have some interesting cases," Sherlock said, tossing his phone in the air and placing it into his coat pocket with one smooth motion.
“They’ll be here soon, they’ll be.. here,” Sherlock said, reassuring John, pressing his already blood-soaked scarf into John’s wound with more pressure.
“That was the most tedious crime I’ve encountered,” John said as he walked into the elevator with Sherlock.
The door was thrusted open from the inside, Sherlock almost stumbling to the ground by the sudden motion.
"Your theory is just absolutely stupid," Sherlock said stubbornly, gesturing with his hands.
Sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side.
“This lift is out of service.” The lift blared as John and Sherlock felt a sudden thud, then no movement from the elevator.
Letting go of the grip he had on John’s hand, he hastily rubbed away the tears that clung onto his eyelashes.
“You’ll be fine in a couple of weeks,” John said.
“Please? For me,”
After this time, I still think about taking drugs. I have the urge to cut myself. I still think about killing myself. But John keeps me occupied, of course, so that I would be safe.
"You can be such an idiot sometimes, but I think I- love you," John said, almost unaware that the last three words slipped through his mouth.
“We’re not gay,” Both of them said in unison.
If I- leave this world, I’ll join John again. In another.
Sherlock opened his mouth as if to form a word, but John shook his head, and squeezed his hand in relief as the paramedics wheeled him to the ambulance.
“You have to. Also, what is that cough of yours? You’ve had it since we were trapped in that room. Are you getting a cold?” John said firmly, walking over to Sherlock to check on him.
John yelled, running into the bathroom.
Call Lestrade.
“Overdosing again, brother dear, how many times has it been?”
My chest and neck felt like they were on fire, burning through the layers of my skin, the pain.. the pain.. can't even describe it..
“What are you doing here? And why are you wearing a t-shirt when it’s snowing? Your face is pale! Come in,”
“Yes. Okay,” Sherlock said, avoiding eye contact as he walked past the doctor.
Two weeks later
“Show yourself, Moriarty!” Sherlock shrieked.
Ignoring Mrs Hudson, I panicked as the blood from the fresh cuts started to seep out of the fabric, their crimson shade contrasting with the crisp white shade of my shirt.
He opened the door slowly, weighing his whole body on the knob. The sweat on his back trickled down. Seconds were passing with a sluggish pace.
—————————
“Yes, hello, Lestrade. Something?” Mycroft said worryingly, sitting down in his armchair.
“Maybe,” Mrs Hudson said, beaming, closing the kitchen door as she left.
John’s cheeks turned a bright red, but unhesitatingly avoiding the offer.
It wasn’t even morning, it was 4am.
“Oh poor Sherlock, always losing control of yourself. Is sentiment coming again? Or has it always been inside you?” Mycroft’s voice was crisp and sharp through the thin air.
“Damn it, I’m calling the police,” John said as he pressed the button that had a bell symbol on it.
"Sure, you guys want to hang around or head back to London?" Lestrade asked.
Picking up a half-opened packet from the floor of the living room, he recognised it immediately.
“NO,” Sherlock yelled, his voice hoarse.
Burns.
“No, I-“
"Take my hand," John said, relaxing Sherlock's sweaty fists and slipping his fingers through his.
“You want to go to sleep?” John said as he saw Sherlock yawn.
He thinks you’re worthless.
“Okay, calm down, I’ll tell you what to do, is he conscious?”
This was it.
“I definitely will be.” John said as he turned to Sherlock. He kissed him on the forehead tenderly, and hugged him unexpectedly. At first, Sherlock didn’t know how to react to it. Slowly, he laid his head on John’s shoulder, and wrapped his arms around him. This wasn’t so bad. He was never really hugged, ever.
“Hello, my friend drowned and he’s not showing any sign of life, I’m doing- CPR on him,” John said as beads of sweat rolled down from his hair.
Mary and John looked at each other, remembering that hypothermia could be incredibly dangerous.
"You mean asking me to spy on him?" Mrs Hudson said sarcastically.
Dead.
—————————————
You’re useless.
Coughing, Sherlock bent over, exhausted. The doctor swiftly inserted a nasal cannula and secured it under his chin. The bursts of oxygen it provided relaxed Sherlock from his tense state, as he inhaled and exhaled  slowly, he was relived to be breathing on his own.
“Sure,” John answered, shifting onto the bed, holding Sherlock’s hand as Sherlock fell into sl
Overwhelmed, I fell onto the floor, my arms and legs spread out. I could only see the ceiling, caked with layers of paint, with nothing but the white surface that turned grey as it reflected the weather outside. My tears and sweat was dripping from my face, onto the carpet, turning it from light red to deep red. Staggering, I got up, my vision blurring, the silhouette of Moriarty appearing right before my eyes.
An hour later, a fireman wrenched the lift door open, to find two men sitting on the floor arguing about something on the phone.
“Splash!!!” The noise from the bathroom flooded into the living room, startling John.
"It's- nothing," John uttered, his eyes trying to divert from Sherlock's nervous gaze.
When I exited my room, the flat was empty again. John’s armchair that faced mine was empty as usual. I hadn’t seen him in two months. I wish I could reverse time to the days where John lived with me. Does John even care about me now? He left you.
Till the next time,
"Sirs, would you mind getting out first?" The fireman said, very much amused by these two men.
Hyperventilating, I let the tears fall from my eyes, whimpering as all my grief and pain rushed into my heart, as I gripped the rope tightly in my hands. I ripped off my dressing gown, and got a stool to reach the ceiling beam, tying the rope around the beam firmly with my clammy hands.
Sherlock dragged himself into the bathroom, thrusting the tap open in the bath, as he sat on the toilet, going back to his thoughts.
__________
“You sur-“
I picked up the syringe with shivering fingers, as I slowly positioned it on my forearm, finding a vein to inject it into. Slowly, I protruded the needle into my vein, feeling a chill run down my spine as the contents of the syringe was emptied from the barrel. Throwing the needle aside, I tilted my head upwards as the pleasant feelings kicked in, the tingle of warmth and the feeling of safety wrapped their hands around me as if embracing an old friend. I exhaled deeply; a relaxed smile creeping on my face.
He needed him.
“Yes, I do,” John said, heaving himself up.
“Thanks- for everything,” Sherlock said, looking into John’s worn out eyes, rimmed with dark circles from caring for him.
No not really I’m sorry if I did that 😬
“Put immediate surveillance on my brother now,” he demanded.
I found myself only sitting in John’s chair, delving my face into the cushions, curling into a ball, staying there for the whole day. Mycroft came up one day. He doesn’t, and can’t help me anyways.
Too painful to watch, Sherlock turned the other way. He heard the terrifying howl that John gave when he took his last breaths..
I needed to do this. I can't imagine a life without him...
“That was your whole plan, wasn’t it? To teach me to dance so you could kiss me,” John said, playfully pushing Sherlock’s chest away from him.
Moriarty’s voice boomed from all directions.
I let it flow, my tears, trickling down my face, soothing me. Breathing in.
Sherlock tried to form a word, a hoarse whisper that sounded something like “yes” was mustered, but his deep, baritone voice that often purred in John’s ear was lost.
“John’s not here anymore, Sherlock, it’s just you and me.. and me.” Moriarty whispered.
He’s always there, to be there for me, to keep me safe.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before Sherlock could answer, he kissed him passionately on the lips, slightly tip-toeing to reach him. Slightly shocked, Sherlock slowly dove into the kiss.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, as John groaned in pain, panting as his knees knocked together, tears flowing down his face. They held hands, both of their hands trembling in fear, grasping one another’s with a tight grip.
Sherlock woke up, his eyes adjusting to the bright hospital lights. He inhaled. There was less pain, and he needed less effort to fill his lungs with oxygen. He saw John dozing in a flimsy hospital chair next to him, one of his palms was on his, his fingers softly laying on his IV.
“No,” Sherlock rasped, holding the coat even closer to himself.
Immediately, he threw off his jacket and used it to support Sherlock’s head. Unbuttoning Sherlock’s wet shirt hastily, he immediately started chest compressions, checking his pulse from time to time. When it did no use at all to resuscitate the unconscious Sherlock, he dialled 999 with his shaky hands, clamping it between his shoulder and head, as he continued to press on Sherlock’s chest.
—————————————
“Did you eat anything unusual?” John asked him.
Alone again.
“Your lips are blue! And you’re breathing irregularly, tell me, what else are you feeling?” John reached out for Sherlock’s wrist. Sherlock dodged his extended hand, as he started coughing continually.
“I promise… I’ll not hide our relationship- again. I’ll not hide it from anyone. Please, I’m sorry,” John said.
"Hey, what are you doing? Stop it," John demanded as he wrapped his hand around Sherlock's wrist, wringing it from his face.
“Let’s go back to the inn,” John said as he started packing up the picnic.
“I am here to inform you that he is dead.”
“Thanks,” Sherlock muttered.
“Sherlock, can you hear me?” John said, moving him from the armchair to the sofa, lying him down and raised his legs above the chest to provide better blood circulation. Mary bundled him with blankets and a hot compress as he groggily opened his eyes.
“For two hours or so,” John said, bending down to kiss his cheek.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I need oxygen.
“John!” He said as he went on his knees, patting his shoulder. Panicked, he shook him with his hands.
“Now go slay that dance with Mary,” Sherlock whispered, putting his palm on John’s cheek.
“Sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side, Sherlock.” I recalled Mycroft hissing in my ear, as 6-year-old me was sprawled on the ground, my knees grazed with blood, trying not to cry, in the courtyard of my childhood home.
“Obviously,” Sherlock said, enunciating every syllable, as he scrolled on his phone.
Shivering, Sherlock stepped out of the bath, as John settled him down to sit on the toilet, he started a bout of coughing.
But all I felt was a single tear roll down my paper-dry skin, as it tumbled into my mouth, tasting like saltwater.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock moaned into the kiss. “Yours.”
But this wasn’t just anyone and Sherlock had to remind himself of that. This was John. John who had gotten so jealous Sherlock had brought home a man from the bar that he had managed to get Sherlock into bed with his arms tied above his head. John who had marked up his neck in a way he had never allowed anyone else, but hadn’t thought twice about allowing. John who was looking at him like he was something to eat. John who loves him.
Sherlock heard the voice clearer now. He knew this voice. This was John. No. Not John. He didn't want John to remember him like this. Sherlock willed his eyes to open slightly. "J-John I-I-" Sherlock's voice cut out and his body fell slack. He was out. He had very little time left.
"I don't know if you can hear me but, I just. It took you almost... me almost losing you, twice for me to realize I've made a huge mistake. I..." He took a breath. "I love you Sherlock Holmes.”
“You are the one who asked for this, “John bit harshly into soft flesh at his lips.
He tried not to let his brain think of the peculiar nature of this situation. He was naked as the day he was born with Sherlock Holmes pressed to his back, fully clothed, as he bathed him. Long ago John had fantasized about showering with his best friend, but he had never imagined that it would look like this when it finally happened. So much had changed between now and then. John had moved out of 221B, gotten married, had a child. But now life was changing again and he had no idea where it was headed.
Sherlock heard John's voice and tried to will himself to speak. But he couldn't move his mouth. He couldn't force his vocal chords to make a single sound. 'Dammit Sherlock! Say something!' He told himself.
"Get him in there now! N..now!" John sobbed not wanting to pull himself away but knowing he had too.  "Sherlock, it’s going to be alright. Sherlock Please hold on."
John heard the heart rate monitor pick up and he picked his head up looking over at it then back to Sherlock. God he was going to be okay wasn't he.
Sherlock smiled as he leaned down to press their lips together that was different than the previous ones, if was slower, more intimate. Sherlock removed himself from his lover’s lips only briefly to finish removing his shirt before removing and connecting their lips once again. Sherlock rolled his hips down, mimicking his earlier actions on the sofa. Sherlock slowly began to explore John’s skin, his neck his collarbones, his soft yet muscular chest and coarse hair that lightly coated it. Sherlock slowly inched his way down the smooth expanse of skin until his lips met the edge of John’s trousers and poised his hands on the button before looking up at John for one last confirmation.
When Sherlock had returned John opened his eyes to see the man before him in a completely different state than the one he had been in only moments prior. The arousal was still there, but it was now hidden behind a layer of confusion that mingled with hope and… love? No, it couldn’t be.
Again, without a reply from Sherlock the pit of his stomach twisted. It was taking far too long for him to haul a cab. As minutes ticked by and he became more and more anxious. "Oh Hell." he said finally breaking into a full on sprint towards the flat. If he kept at this pace it would take him somewhere around 15 minutes to get there. He knew something was wrong. He had to get to Sherlock.
Sherlock's heart started racing. The monitor next to his bed was going crazy. John cared about him... John... John loves him... John loves him! God why was he incapable of speaking or moving? Why couldn't he tell John he loves him to and throw his arms around him and kiss him?
John looked up again and smiled softly. The corner of his lips just barely tipping up. "Oh Sherlock. How could I ever be so stupid."
All John could focus on was the thump of his feet on the pavement like the second hand on the clock ticking as time passed by. He skidded to a stop in front of 221B twisting the handle slamming the door behind him as he rushed up the stairs. "Sherlock? Sherlock I'm here! I'm coming" He called.
John’s heart sank, clearly Sherlock didn’t feel the same. He had made a fool of himself. He knew he should have kept it to himself, “It’s okay that you don’t feel the same, Sherlock. I just wanted to tell you. I-uh, I need to go to practice.”
Sherlock knelt beside John and placed his hand gently on the blonde’s shoulder. “John, let’s go home. I’ll help you.”
Sherlock's heart sped up again. What did John mean by that? What was he saying? God Sherlock was confused. He couldn’t comprehend what he was hearing.
“Bedroom?” Sherlock questioned after several moments.
“Please, John,” Sherlock moaned, suddenly free of his hesitations. “Please, John I need you. Please fuck me. I need you to fuck me.”
“Known what?” Sherlock was now the confused party as he looked down at his friend.
Sherlock’s heart sank a little, “I suppose you must find it rather unsettling to know someone wrote that about you.”
“From the moment you returned, she’s known that I would never be able to love her the way that I love you, Sherlock. She knew that if I had to live without one of you I would always choose to have you,” John was crying now as he looked up at the detective. “She saved your life because she knew it also meant saving my own.”
“John,” Sherlock gasped at the suddenness. He took in his new position, his hands were once again pinned to either side of his head and John had his knees anchored on either side of Sherlock’s slim hips with his strong calves hooked over the lean muscles of his thighs. Sherlock was effectively trapped and he was loving it. John looked down at his lover, eyes displaying the most maddening combination of arousal and needed that Sherlock thought he had ever seen in his life.
“Sherlock,” John looked at him confused. “You’ll ruin your clothes.”
“God, John,” Sherlock gasped at the suddenness of the action.
Sherlock pulled his head back, appalled, “Sorry? For what?”
Sherlock looked wrecked, his neck and collarbones had countless bruises that would definitely visible no matter how the man attempted to arrange himself tomorrow, his lips were swollen and parted slightly, a dark pink tink covered his cheekbones and traveled in a lighter gradient across the rest of his face, and his eyes were alert but not in their normal way, Sherlock looked as though most his mind was floating far beyond his reach and what remained of it was this moment and his arousal and John. The rest of the world could have burst into flames and Sherlock wouldn’t have noticed or cared because John fucking Watson had him tied to a damn bed and it was more than he ever could have dreamed of.
Sherlock smiled at the man in front of him, his eyes shining with love and adoration. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, “ Sherlock leaned in to connect their lips in a chaste kiss. “I love you, John Watson.”
When they arrived Sherlock gently, hesitantly took the widow’s hand and directed him out of the car, into the doors, and up the stairs. When they were safely inside the little piece of the world that John had always sworn seemed safe from the outside world despite the mayhem that overtook it frequently, Sherlock gently removed John’s jacket and directed him toward the bathroom.
Of course, after Sherlock had realized he had fallen head over heels for his flatmate the work did little to distract him from that. So for four years Sherlock had had an itch in his mind palace that he had been entirely unable to scratch. It was infuriating honestly. Surely after four years there should be some sort of relief, but it seemed that with each passing day the urge only intensified.
When he finally got back there it was 3 in the morning and John was physically and emotionally drained. But he sat next to him and took his hand in his again. God he never wanted to let it go. He placed a gentle kiss on one of his knuckles then rested his head on the side of the bed. Knowing that Sherlock would not be coming to within the next couple hours, John drifted off to sleep for the night.
“What about you?” John averted his eyes again.
John awoke and remembered where he was and gently stroked the rough pad of his thumb over the smooth skin of Sherlock's hand. His face resting on the edge of the bed and his eyes growing heavy. "I'm sorry Sherlock. Please don't leave me." John said quietly.
John chuckled, “And here I thought you were insistent outside of the bedroom.”
Before too long both John and Sherlock were packed in the back of one of the ambulances that had shown up. There wasn't much the workers in the back could do but try keep him on oxygen as they made their way to the hospital.
“I-” John paused, unsure of how to proceed. “Thank you. For taking care of me. You didn’t have to, but you did and I really appreciate it.”
Regardless of John's words Sherlock continued to try to speak. He managed to gain control of his jaw. "J-John" Sherlock stuttered out, his voice raspy and heavy.
“John,” Sherlock moaned, frustration coating his voice. “This is ridiculous.”
John was shocked at this response, “I just don’t think that’s as true as you may think it is.”
“What do you mean?” John furrowed his brow in confusion. Why would he be anything less than kind?
“You mean riding your cock?” The detective quirked an eyebrow, “I’d have say you’re rather biased.”
“Sherlock, are y-” John spoke softly before being cut off.
“Ah,” Mike gave his friend a small smile and grabbed his shoulder. “Well, does it hurt to know all of your options mate? Maybe that fella is the one who wrote the message.”
John opened his eyes and looked at the beautiful man in front of him, “Of course, Sherlock. Nothing would make me happier.” John connected their lips once again. The kiss was slow, passionate but not sexual. It was the kiss of men who were finally at peace.
John attempted to walk past Sherlock without making eye contact, but when he was only maye one step away from each other the detective’s deep baritone spoke, “John.” The doctor’s eyes immediately snapped up and he was instantly lost in the current deep blue shade of Sherlock’s eyes. They were mere inches apart and he glanced from his eyes down to Sherlock’s lips. In his new level of closeness he could clearly see that the man’s lips were swollen and the jealousy that was coursing through him took control and he leaned forward to capture them with his own.
Thank you? -JW
John sighed, Sherlock had a point. Sherlock couldn’t know for sure, but John had a feeling he knew that the doctor had never been the begging type in the bedroom. John gathered his wits and grabbed a fist full of the detectives curls and pulled him up for a long and deep kiss. “Be careful what you wish for,” he practically hissed before quickly taking back control of the situation and flipping the detective onto his back.
Sherlock peeked up from the microscope momentarily, “What, is she lesbian?”
“You clearly had… plans,” John managed.
John gave his friend a small smile, “Yeah, maybe.” But he knew it couldn’t be true. There was no way that Sherlock Holmes was in love with him.
“Hey, partner,” John smiled as he sat down next to the dark haired boy. Sherlock simply nodded his response without turning his head and John frowned, had he done something wrong? “Everything okay?”
“You want more? I’ll give you more, Sherlock,” John’s voice had turned almost dangerous in a matter of seconds and Sherlock felt his cock somehow becoming even more interested in the situation as it strained against the tight material of his trousers. He struggled in an attempt to lift his hips and make John more aware of the material that still covered the bottom half of his body, but his attempt failed and only make John’s wicked smirk turn more sinister as he leaned down and attached his lips to one of Sherlock’s nipples, biting at it, just the right side of too hard. John grabbed Sherlock’s scarf that was conveniently draped over headboard where he had most likely flung it before going out earlier that night and used it to tie the younger man’s wrists together above his head and then wound the ends around the headboard, effectively trapping him.
“Hello, John,” Sherlock didn’t meet his eyes and John looked at him with confusion.
“Honestly, John, you’re the first person I’ve ever allowed to leave a single mark,” Sherlock looked over at his doctor, his eyes had widened a little bit at that and his breathing accelerated, clearly a little aroused by the information despite the very recent orgasm. “If I cared about visibility at all I wouldn’t have let you leave them in the first place. I do rather enjoy your possessive streak. I hadn’t expected that one.”
This... this was John. Sherlock felt his heart rate speed up therefore making the monitor beep faster. John... John was here... John was holding his hands... John kissed his hand... John... didn't want to lose him..?
“Hey, guys! Come look at this!” Mike called out to the team. The young men gathered around where Mike was pointing to see, fine letters that read ‘I’m gay and hopelessly in love with the rugby captain.’ “We have to find him.” Stamford insisted.
“You..?” John questioned of the abrupt stop.
Sherlock smiled gently down at the army doctor and nodded, John was generally too proud to ask for comfort, how could he deny him when he was desperate enough to ask for it? Sherlock moved to the other side of the bed and laid down before he realized he had no clue what the protocol was here. Did John just want him to be here with no physical contact? Did he want to talk? Did he want to be held? Sherlock decided he would stay still until John initiated the next movement.
“Oh!” Mike suddenly understood. “Well why didn’t you tell us? Who is it?”
“Yes?” Sherlock asked, trying desperately to not let the anxiety and hope show in his voice.
“Of course it matters! You’re John Watson for crying out loud! If he’s attracted to men, there’s no way he isn’t interested in you!” Mike’s volume was becoming embarrassing, at this point students were glancing their way from all areas of the hallway -more so than they already had been- to see what all the fuss was about.
As he sat there squeezing Sherlock's hand he thought about how stupid he was. How dumb he had been, especially after Sherlock came back, to get so invested with someone else. God he actually loved this man in front of him. More than he could ever love his wife. This man had saved him, make his life loads better from the first minute. Now he was so stupid as to leave him alone and let him do this to himself. God was he stupid.
“Well, I had to do something after you completely shut me down by saying you were married to your work,” John argued.
John had calmed down enough to take the initiative to grab Sherlock's hand and keep it firmly in his. He had to be quiet though. He knew ambulance protocol. He was a bloody doctor after all.
Sherlock dipped quickly out into the hallway and John heard another voice that confirmed his hypothesis and took a deep breath, closing his eyes to calm the intense jealousy within him. He had no right to be jealous, Sherlock had made himself quite clear multiple times that he had no interest in John. And what had John done in response? Kiss him. Good one, Watson. Now he’s out there shooing away someone he actually likes so he can come in here and deal with the problem you’ve created.
“Thank you,” John breathed. He couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes, knowing that the bottom of the shower would be tinged pink from his wife's blood running off of his body. So instead John focused on what he feel, hear, and smell around him, a tactic he’d learned in the military to help him out of these moments where he felt disconnected from reality.  Sherlock’s thin fingers were stroking through his hair, the soap suds trickling lightly down the side of his face, the smooth material of Sherlock’s wet button down against his back, the soft smell of the shampoo, the sound and feeling water hitting his body. Slowly John was coming back to himself as Sherlock began washing his body, but he remained still and silent.
John grinned, his stinging eyes being soothed by the tears that were now pricking the corners of them. "Oh Sherlock. I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry. Please forgive me.”
“Honestly John, I didn’t think it would be this easy to make you beg,” Sherlock smirked. “I was really hoping for a little bit more from you.”
Somehow John knew this was his fault. There had to be some connection with him and what Sherlock had done. “Sherlock! Sherlock come back to me please!" John pleaded. He picked up his phone like he should have done the moment he got there and phoned Lestrade. When the DI picked up he practically yelled into the phone, "I NEED AN AMBULANCE NOW GREG. 221B NOW." He didn't even give time to hang up he just dropped the phone and put a hand to Sherlock's cheek.
John placed his lips on Sherlock’s and pulled the other man closer to him until their chests were pressed together. “God, how have we been so stupid?”
“John, I need...,” Sherlock moaned. He didn’t even know what it was he was asking for, he just knew that he needed something, anything.
