Cas’ wings made an aborted motion that Dean suspected was originally intended to wrap them around himself, but he stopped before he could accidentally smack Dean with a face full of feathers.

. He is. I recognised his mark as soon as it appeared on my forearm.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure my parents and tutors wish me and Sammy were more formal than we are, but they’ve never tried to stop us from being friends with someone, regardless of status. It makes us ‘more approachable as rulers’, apparently, not that I’m complaining. Nobles tend to be much more stuck up.”
got an assignment in today just one + a quiz to go over the weekend (then the essay next fri but I got plenty of time for that lol)
But he didn’t,

“Yes, you do.”
“Wait— you’re saying
Sometimes, though, it’s clear what has happened almost immediately. Usually, those situations are cleared up almost instantly, either by Dean and Cas displaying some form of slightly-too-romantic-to-be-brushed-away-but-not-romantic-enough-to-make-Dean-panic act of PDA, or by them outright correcting whoever it was that had made a comment about what a good ‘friendship’ they had.
“That didn’t seem to stop the Inquisitor from giving Jace the position when his true heritage was revealed, so
The warm feeling that pooled in his chest whenever Dean sent him a grin wasn’t exactly

this is not starwars related bc idk I didn't think of it being may the fourth till after i'd written lol but even if I had realised I probably wouldn't have had any ideas anyway. also I realised I missed sams bday so I'm sorry to all the sam girls, I respect y'all even if I'm not one of u (wheres my dean-coded cas girl gang at amiright zskdjhbkvj)
, it wasn’t exactly every day that Dean went around spilling the family business to people that weren’t directly involved in a supernatural attack.
Deans free hand lifted up to rub the back of his neck, but he didn’t make any attempt to loosen the hand he had entangled with Cas.
“Of course, love,” he says, before leaning forwards gently.
“Can you even
Dean hadn’t dared ask for a moment alone with Castiel. They had the rest of their lives to get to know each other, after all. The wedding and reception were for their kingdoms, for their families, and the honeymoon was for getting to know each other well enough to work out if they would genuinely get along.
marriage that someone was so invested in made him feel slightly weird.
Dean rolled his eyes, but angled his head obligingly, and their lips met with the sort of sleepy ease that they’d become accustomed to.
“If they’re looking for a kitten and don’t find one at the first shelter they visit, they’ll go to more. Kittens aren’t exactly in short supply.”
The decision, however, was taken (quite literally) out of his hands a moment later, when he finished coughing only for Sam to spy the latest blood-soaked petal and snatch it out of his hands before he could hide it from view.
She quirked an eyebrow at his words.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Sammy.”
Dean groaned.
Dean frowned slightly, moving his hand to brush a gentle thumb along Cas’ cheek.
“Castiel, Dean
Dean just blinked stupidly in response, and the man tilted his head slightly before elaborating.
“It is as much my name as any other word would be.”
Cas shrunk in on himself, and Dean felt a little guilty.
If he’d played up his annoyance at how monumentally all of those said dates
the concept is this: me + a group of fellow writers all choose a fandom (i have a mental list of ones that i feel fit the vibe). we then cowrite a story in which ~2 chars from each of our chosen fandoms attend a dinner party hosted by Hannibal Lector. that's it that's the fic FRKSDJHSHA
also I completely forgot this au existed but decided I wanted to add to it again so <3
Dean wasn’t sure why he was so nervous.
“Well, yeah, I mean—”
“So you never considered what it would be like to join me in my nice warm bed one night?”
Cas, despite Sam’s insistence that he was being an idiot, avoided bringing the topic of soulmarks up with Dean for as long as humanly possible.
oh also me and mum just watched the s3 coven ep today (and also the dreams ep) and I'm so mad that people got angry abt ruby as she is a Vibe and i don't like that the writers had to make her evil. although lbr she probably would've died anyway because she's ~female~
, not someone with a ‘crack in their chassis’ like Castiel — or Dean

acknowledging everything that was between them, and Dean felt laughter bubbling up from within him. When it sprung free, bright and joyful in a way that seemed at odds with everything he’d been through in his life, he was slightly surprised, but it didn’t take Cas long to join him. Their laughter filled the hospital room, and Dean found himself grateful that no one came in to check on them. He wanted him and Cas to stay private for a little while longer, without any nosy nurses butting in on their moment.
“You don’t wanna lose him. Don’t worry, brother, I get it. I just hope you work things out.”
that was wrong about what you just said, because
love him was laughable at best. Bobby might be an exception, but Bobby had practically raised him and Sammy, so that changed things. It was hard to hate someone when you’d seen them before they were tall enough to reach the kitchen counter.

“I don’t think I’m ‘not enough’, Dean. I know that there’s nothing broken within me despite my lack of interest in sex, and I know you’d happily give it up if it was the only way to have me. But I don’t
Castiel, who had just suffered through another valiant attempt by his body to expel the flowers that were choking him from the inside out, tried to smile reassuringly at Sam.
Smol sick fic
god i truly do be incapable of writing pretty much anything but fluff atm honestly
“Then… why are you out here in the middle of the night? Most family members stay out this late to protect graves, not actively endorse the person robbing them.”
i remembered that halloween being a Big Deal in America meant that Halloween drabbles outside of my planned one (aka one written and posted on the day) would probably not go awry fhzdbjsn. it's becoming bigger here but mostly bc capitalism and also the americanisation of media— while i've worn costumes for school free-dress days, i've literally never been trick or treating before. i was invited once but my mum said no bc she was worried abt safety, didn't want me to come home with a shittonne of lollies (i probably wouldn't have a lot of houses don't even bother having any), and also was like. annoyed that American culture & traditions has become so common here gjkrdfsb. last year we had the most trick or treating groups we've ever had (which compared to the grand total of, uh, 0 we had in 2018, isn't exactly hard) and we'd exited a 112 day lockdown literally 5 days prior (the longest continuous one in the world at that stage (and possibly still currently)!!! what joy!!!! but also it worked really fucking well at the time, we had a glorious period of 0 cases, then international and interstate travellers fucked us over again)
(Ultimately, all his planning ends up being useless. Turns out, carefully constructed love confessions fly out the window when your hindbrain takes over and you end up jumping the intended target of said confessions in the kitchen one morning.)
And sometimes he said nothing at all, just staring wide-eyed at Dean as he flailed and made awkward noises before beating a hasty retreat, worried he’d do something he couldn’t take back, like pulling Cas close and kissing the tear tracks away.
human socialisation, sometimes.
Apparently not, though, if he’d been killed by a two-bit vamp dressed like a sideshow attraction.
I also started a second reddie soulmate fic this morning bc I was struck with inspiration so I don't feel guilty abt only just hitting 100 words for this (like i shouldn't anyway, that's the whole point of this 100 words is the Goal™, but I feel pride in so consistently going over the word count)
“And that is perfectly okay, as is you caring as much as you do.”

“I’m glad,” Cas admitted, and Dean chuckled softly.
He was
As he looked across at Dean, all his planned-out explanations and questions flew from his brain. He tried to collect his thoughts, but Dean was growing more and more closed off by the minute, and he had a horrible feeling that he only had a couple more seconds before Dean would give up and walk off again. So he mentally scanned through everything he’d been thinking over in the last month or so, re-figuring out his main concerns and worries, then blurted out the first question that came to mind.
“Well, then my rescue will take a little longer than it otherwise would, and I’ll still be fine.”
sky u know exactly why this exists today flkvsjhdf,k although I'm very excited abt soulless cas au its made me Feel Things so angsty vibes it is
Also I’m posting early bc I need to make myself dinner and wanna get through a bunch more episodes of hannibal tonight, I have priorities fjsjxjs
At Sam’s question, Castiel recalled Dean asking the exact same thing, back when they had only met a handful of times. Funny how the brothers could mirror each other so well even unintentionally, although Sam’s question seemed less out of the blue than Dean’s had been.
“Oh, yeah. Uh. I could just. Make you a honey latte if you want?”
Sam and Dean are shooting him slightly concerned looks at this stage, with Dean in particular pushing him to stay back at the motel if he’s not feeling up for a hunt, but outside the burning in his chest and the heavy feeling in his lungs, he feels completely fine. It’ll go away soon.
. An open relationship.”
“Dean, I do not wish to make you feel uncomfortable. If you aren’t yet at a stage where you feel you can indulge in public displays of affection with me, that’s perfectly fine. Although I enjoy being physically close to you, I wish for this relationship to move at whatever speed you need it to.”

“It’s only 9:30 Dean, don’t be ridiculous.”
but also its a reassurance that i didn't realise i needed that what happened with my ex best friend truly wasn't on me, that she was the one that had changed in a negative way, and that her issues weren't something only I was seeing/affected by
a surprise, however, was his discovery that he couldn’t free himself from his restraints.
Sam doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to. All it takes is them meeting each other’s eyes for everything that’s happened while he’s been stuck out here is communicated instantly.
“I didn’t realise you needed my permission for that, Sammy, I would’ve exercised that control a hell of a lot more often when you were an annoying toddler if I had.”
Cas would’ve liked watching the storm, probably, in that same way he found most things about earth beautiful. He would’ve sat uncomfortably on the ground next to them, looking almost adorably out of place in his own body, and Dean would’ve found himself watching Cas just as much as the rain outside. He’d probably have shared a fact about what bees did when it rained, as earnest as he always was about his favourite insect, and maybe their hands would’ve linked across Miracle’s back, a solid weight reminding each other that they weren’t alone.
“Spill what, Charlie?”
Cas leant in to peck Dean’s lips briefly, then pulled away as they reached the doors of the course.
this was part of the deal. They’d talked about it, when Cas was first considering things, and Dean had made it clear that he’d never loved Cas because of his powers. But the crushing feeling of
, he’d had fun so far, getting tipsy with everyone and winking at the girls (and one guy) that had hopefully hit on him before informing them he was an almost-married man and they’d better go looking elsewhere.
(“Dean, I spent half the night staring into your eyes.”
The fogginess he got if he went too long without sleep, and in the mornings before he had his coffee, he could do without. If he could retain both the ability to sleep beside Dean every night and the alertness he’d had as an angel, things would be a little easier. Actually tasting food was nice, but having to remember to eat even when he was entrenched in activities was not. And general bodily functions were just
“You can just call me Cas.”
“Well… not
That… didn’t really clear things up for Dean.
“So I just comb through with my fingers and some water?” He clarified, and Cas nodded in agreement.
And he’d known that from the start, had known it since he’d shown the first glimmers of free-will, so it shouldn’t be a revelation.
“So you know the guard… well, then?” Cas asked, shifting his hand to interlock their fingers after a moment, and Dean flushed lightly as he looked down at where their hands were joined.
Castiel slumped in his seat, brow slightly furrowed.
tried to hit on Cas but had backed off when Cas made it clear he wasn’t an option. Good to know. He just hoped she had more luck with the next attractive man that entered the bar.

Dean hummed thoughtfully, looking up from his laptop at Castiel. He
She blinked, obviously surprised. She’d been trying to convince him Dean had been staring at him as much as he’d been staring at Dean over the course of the semester, but he hadn’t quite believed it. Today’s incident just further cemented the idea that she was delusional in his mind.
This could be seen as related to chap 69  but was mostly bc I paint my nails as a grounding tactic sometimes lol— Dean sometimes needs a hand getting out of his own head
A small smile rose to Cas’ lips, and Dean reached out to take a sip of his (

They weren’t alone on the beach, and noises from the various other resort guests filtered across to them, but a bubble of peace enveloped them anyway.

It was now Castiel’s turn to blush, but he didn’t make any attempt to still Dean.
“No, I— I like it.”
As he looked across at Dean, all his planned-out explanations and questions flew from his brain. He tried to collect his thoughts, but Dean was growing more and more closed off by the minute, and he had a horrible feeling that he only had a couple more seconds before Dean would give up and walk off again.

“I feel like you are approaching this from the wrong end of things, in some ways. Rather than focusing on why you struggle with PDA specifically, you should instead try to overcome the general barriers towards affection you put up in your mind even when you are in private. Once you are more comfortable with non-sexual intimacy as a whole, it will be easier for you to engage in those acts while in public.”
“Yeah, but all the ways that we could prove we haven’t interacted are easily faked. Emails can be deleted, as well as texts and phone calls, we might’ve never met on campus so that professors weren’t aware we knew each other, our friends could be lying to cover for us. And that’s not even accounting for burner phones and emails. It seems ridiculous, but some people go… very overboard to get out of doing set work.”

The next morning, before Deah had had a chance to start cooking properly, Sam cornered him in the kitchen; meeting his eyes calmly. It wouldn’t do to spook Dean now, before Sam got the answers he needed.
Dean didn’t know why
Dean took a deep breath in and nodded.
Then Castiel shifted so one of his arms was rubbing soothingly up and down Dean’s spine, and he found himself
“I’m good with all non-sexual intimacy, or at least all forms of it I have experienced thus far. Kissing is okay, but not on areas that are considered overly sexual. Any further than that makes me… uncomfortable. I will, of course, tell you if any of these boundaries change, or if you do something that I didn’t realise was something I’d react badly to.”
“I woke up and you weren’t there,” he explained. “What did you think I would do?”
Chaps 125, 127, 129, 144, 155— Cas isn't in class :(
They were each other's homes, after all.
“What was I supposed to do, Sammy? He called me up after you left for college and fuckin guilt-tripped me into coming back to hunt with him whenever he needed a second pair of hands!”
Dean flushed.
“And again, if it
time).
She started walking towards the two of them anyway, and Dean had to grit his teeth when his purposeful aura of ‘not interested’ did nothing to dissuade her flirty grin.
this idea came to my brain today and seemed amusing in that slightly-crackish fluff way so I decided to start it. i may at some point go back and like, fix the start of this so the dialogue starts off more canon-ey but I couldn't be fucked today lol. this isn't the section I really wanted to write but setups important or some shit idk
“And? A lot can change in 10 years.”
Cas frowned.
true love’s kiss looked like had served as an effective way to both get Sam to shut up and spend an enjoyable and uninterrupted few minutes with his favourite angel.
an overly angsty au, the chars don’t give in to said coercion at any point (although they may consider it at times), but if you have issues around that sort of thing then I’d rec sitting this au out 💜
He was still having a little trouble unlearning that one, unsurprisingly, but he would get there.
“Well, come on then, babe! I can’t exactly go grab the box for you, I’ve been gravely injured. I don’t even know that a band-aid will fix it properly.”
“I mean— I
“And I you.”
Things were looking up.
what podcast is it? You said ‘media franchise’ so I’m assuming it’s more a story-based one than knowledge-based, but I can never tell with you. Do story-driven podcasts even exist?”
Dean’s face softened, but it still had a distinctly teasing edge to it.
“Considering we just got married, I had my suspicions, but it’s always nice to hear that confirmed.”
Cas had mentioned wanting to experience the more simple joys of life without the weight of a hunt overshadowing them, and Dean had been unable to do anything but agree when he was met with the force of the angel's bright eyes. The first of these ‘simple joys’ he wanted was apparently a beach day with friends, so they’d organised one the next time they were near enough to one at a convenient time.
Despite what Cas had told him about soulmate bonds never being wrong, Dean knew that he didn’t have a hope with the angel.
“I told you, we won’t go high,” Cas said. “Today the aim is to just get your feet off the ground.”
its a struggle bc like, i feel like i should b leaning back on my established aus when i don't have writing braincells but at the same time i don't wanna give bad quality updates to any of them so i am reluctant to do so at the same time. its hm.
Dean, for all people seemed to assume otherwise, was a tried-and-true morning person.
He doubted he’d even have noticed if anyone walked in the room.
But other times, when he felt himself slipping into the now-familiar darkness brought on by sleep, surrounded by the warmth of the duvet and Dean’s embrace, he knew that he’d traded the sleepless nights for something much,
Cas could tell, Dean knew, and he didn’t know if he should feel guilty about that or not. He never wanted Cas to think he was ashamed of him, because he

not having the courage to do more than flash a quick smile Cas’ way before their lecture, Castiel apparently had no qualms about approaching him at the end of class.

With those (slightly ominous, at least to Dean) words, Cas kicked off the ground.
Dean knocked their shoulders together gently, a soft smile on his face.
when he found himself holding an arm out to Cas on the bed in a clear invitation.
“Iss cold,” Cas whined, stretching his limbs across into Dean’s newly vacant side of the bed.
“I mean, it’s clear we both feel things for each other. This…
Dean froze, body thrumming with an entirely different sort of nerves than before. There were only two things related to the agency that would cause Cas to forget himself enough to call Dean right in the middle of class, and Cas didn’t seem upset enough for one of them. That meant…
Hopefully, he’d wake up tomorrow feeling as bright as he usually did, and then he could blot today from his memory, term it an unexplained and temporary dip in his emotions without having to consider it any further.
“I like this particular tea sweet!”

Chaps 112, 113— Dean goes to the initial meeting and meets Cas outside the door
“Castiel, everyone’s favourite former angel of the lord, at your service.”
But to have a completely static and unchanging name the way that he did, especially one that was longer than a syllable??
“I can,” Cas responded dryly. “We’re both fairly emotionally compromised even at the best of times.”

He’d just have to try again tomorrow.
“It’s okay if you can’t say it back, Dean. Just knowing the sentiment is returned, that’s enough for me. I know this sort of thing is difficult for you.”
nuh uh’ phase, and that didn’t always flag with people as the clear overcompensation that it had been. There was a reason it'd worked effectively for Dean for so many years, after all. Who knew?
Sam blinked.

“I almost feel like we should be collecting these for a craft project,” Dean joked. “How much do you reckon an angel feather pillow would sell for?”
Dean chuckled, his own grin matching Cas’.
Cas’ eyes really were impossibly wide and blue in moments like these, and Dean found himself scrambling to reassure the ex-angel that nothing was wrong.
to be at least, and I’m…
shocked to find that it would work perfectly no matter what. It was a real start, and that was a helluva lot better than what they’d had previously.
“Dean, why exactly are you calling me about this?”
“Care for me in what sense? Because, well, I care for Sam greatly, but I wouldn’t sit holding his hand while he was unconscious.”
play Quodpot, you know. It’s friggin’
just made him look like an idiot.
this didn't quite work how i wanted it to but eh
this is the start of a five + 1 fic theoretically however I don't have all of the five planned out yet so we shall see. if I can't think of more scenarios I might cheat and make it a 3 + 1 fic but that's less fun
basically ignore any badness lol
Chaps 120, 139, 143, 172, 184, 193, 201, 206— they movin faster!
Cas’ eyebrow raised; the confusion gone from his face.
“Well, when we were out at the farmers market this morning and I wandered off while you were talking to the beekeeper, I walked past a stall selling them and noticed they had a bee shaped one. The chick running the stall noticed me looking and… convinced me into buying some.”
He isn’t quite sure what he was expecting, honestly. A part of him was worried that it would feel strange, that he wouldn’t enjoy it— that it would somehow make all these feelings inside of him go away, as though the years of devotion and love they’d built between them could be destroyed so easily. Another part of him thought it would be the most amazing first kiss he’d ever had, because how couldn’t it be? It was
was supposed to be the one with self-esteem issues. Were you ever gonna tell me of your own volition, or were you gonna just stick around watching me having one-night-stands regularly while convinced that this is something that I don’t want?”
The grin that split Sam’s face was positively huge, and a second later Dean found himself wrapped up in a tight embrace that screamed ‘proud younger brother.’ Sam pulled away a moment later, mindful of the boundaries Dean had set up around ‘chick flick moments’, but the smile stayed firmly on his face.
He liked holding his boyfriend’s hand, okay? He was
related to a hunt to do for such a long stretch of time was… disconcerting. A part of Dean wasn’t sure he liked it.
“Keep moving forward, calling upon you every free chance I get, until I annoy you into helping me.”
“Oh, yeah? Did he have any thoughts about what he’d use?”
Rather than responding immediately, Dean dropped a kiss onto Cas’ forehead and stepped back from the bed.
GOD i love this au,,,,,,, i have so many thoughts on it ssdfkgjdfh
Dean grimaced, wanting to offer comfort but not sure how to go about it.
“Yeah, but some of this shit’s actually helpful, and it’s probably good to have on hand. And it’s not like it’s
“Oh, because you’re the foremost expert on all things Cas now?” She asked, before softening a little when his cheeks flushed darker and he stammered out an awkward response. “He’s okay, he just picked up a bug from a co-worker. He should be back in class next week.”
imagined trusting a decade ago, back when he and Cas first met. Sam was a familiar presence behind him, and he smiled at Charlie in her position behind Cas. He met Cas’ eyes again, then grinned when he saw the look of slight concern on his angel’s face. Cas could always read him so well.
i feel kinda weird updating, i liked this being at such a nice round wordcount x,fdnzb,

. They were a gift God bestowed upon humanity to foster connections.”
“I don’t want to inconvenience you and Sam though, and I’ve always been perfectly fine without a birthday before.”
Although he’d made a big deal out of celebrating Cas’ birthday, Dean didn’t actually have many grand plans for the day. Sam and Eileen had initially been planning to pop over for dinner, with all their other friends and family members unavailable till the coming weekend, but an emergency with a younger hunter had led to them sending their apologies the day before.
Dean blinked.
this was almost a hp au because the fanfic I've been reading today is a hp one (a series i rly love just updated for the first time in ages but i was actually already rereading it before the update zdlvfdh) b u t i couldn't get the vibe right so y'all get this mess instead (oh and in case it wasn't clear by past chapters/ans what my view is, fuck jk rowling and her transphobic bullshit)

And by the time the sun rose in front of them, they were blanketed in a comforting silence as the fear gave back way to the initial feelings of pure joy and love that had surrounded them when they had received that vital phone call.
Cas looked like he was going to protest again, so Dean took a step away without letting go of his partner’s hand.
Cas fixed him with a stare that clearly conveyed ‘I’m sure you know the answer to that already and are only asking it to seem cooler and less knowledgeable about this topic than you actually are, so I will not dignify it with a response’ before absent-mindedly picking up the fork Dean had placed in front of him at some point in their conversation.
“You’re not wrong, it’s a sweet shirt— I’ll make a classic rock fan outta you yet. Does our new friend have a name?”
“I don’t really know what you want me to say, Dean. I thought— Well— It seemed fairly self-explanatory to me.”
“One honey latte it is.”

Chaps 120, 139, 143, 172— They have achieved lift off!!
“Not Cas?” Benny finished, and Dean nodded awkwardly. “Yeah, man, we can hang out still.”
“—It’s just, it took me so long to even realise what the dreams meant, and I figured you would’ve said something if the bond was reciprocated, but I know I’m not exactly your ideal partner—” Cas barrelled on, apparently not registering Dean’s response, and Dean found himself freezing.
There was a moment of silence when they pulled apart, with both of them looking seriously into the other’s eyes, then Cas spoke again.
So I’m writing and posting this from my phone and I’m tired from socialising and travel,,,,, sorry for the terrible writing/formatting that has probably resulted from that

how low they were, his brain automatically started telling him they were higher than they were. Cas left him in silence for a few moments, staying hovering in the same position mid-air, but he eventually spoke up.
sometimes took actual years figuring everything out.
“I… didn’t know how to bring it up, exactly.”
“I’m not sure you realise this, Sammy, but it wasn’t the most ideal time for a heart-to-heart!”
Not that Dean was complaining. The first time he and Sammy had arrived back to see Cas standing in the kitchen, a freshly baked pie on the bench as the angel smiled that wide way he did when he was genuinely proud of achieving something on his own— Well, let’s just say Sammy was lucky he didn’t suffer as much mental scarring after that incident as Dean had wanted to inflict on him. He found it hard to resist his angel at the best of times.
Cas shifted so that he could properly glare at Dean.
, it’s a bit of a surprise, but soulmarks aren’t exactly unusual, you know? I’m not gonna judge you for it, or anything. And I know you’ve seen mine.”
Castiel, on the other hand, had taken to sleeping as though he needed to catch up on all the years he hadn’t been, back when he was still a fully-fledged angel. He clung to Dean every morning, groaning in protest at his boyfriend's attempts to quietly extricate himself, and would glare petulantly when he inevitably succeeded.
Cas shrunk in on himself, annoyed with his apparent inability to hold awkward conversations without blurting out the first thing that came to mind, but didn’t back down from his line of questioning, no matter how shocked Dean seemed by it.

Guilt would get him nowhere, however, and Cas knew why he had to go in, so he settled himself by cleaning up the toast and boiling another mug of water to make Cas some fresh tea. He stayed as quiet as possible, wanting to let Cas sleep as long as he needed, but was met with a pair of blinking blue eyes when he walked back into the living room.

It wasn’t all a struggle, though. Jimmy was okay with checking out for the evening to let them have dates, even if he couldn’t guarantee he’d sleep the whole way through them, and Cas was a lot freer with his affection on those nights, which spilled over to Dean.
The roughness in Cas’ voice didn’t seem to reassure Sam, and he studied the ex-angel seriously for a moment before sighing.
are there dozens of hogwarts/Harry Potter aus involving dean being scared of flying and Cas helping him get over it? yes. do I care? no
“Cas, you can do whatever the fuck you want now, remember? That comes with the whole free-will deal.”
Cas furrowed his brow, suddenly very confused.
It takes approximately two seconds for Dean to be in his personal space, hands on Cas’ hips and their lips pressed gently together. Their foreheads remained pressed together even as the kiss broke off, and Dean couldn’t help but grin.
Dean made a gesture that was supposed to convey ‘Nah, everything’s cool,’ but that he
Cas was sat awkwardly on the bed, his normally hidden wings splayed out behind him, with a pile of dark feathers scattered across the ground. He had his back to the door, and despite being contorted in such a way that the top half of his body was almost facing Dean, it was clear that he had no idea that the hunter had arrived. Instead, all his attention was focused very intently on his wings.
I didn’t just wanna write for a new fandom in this with no prior warning tho, lol, even tho this is literally just a ‘write every day’ work and not specifically a spn one. Spn is still very dear to my heart and I imagine once me and my mum manage to watch another episode it’ll once again be consuming my every waking moment. In the meantime, if tomorrow/the day after I write an It drabble, y’all spn folks can just skip over it if soft gays from the demon clown movie aren’t ur vibe. but also even if u dislike horror reddie is iconic and y’all should 100% read fanfic for them.

“Is that so?”
Dean made an agreeing noise, then a thought crossed his mind and he stopped in his tracks.
Maybe one day he would be free to be himself.
So Dean consciously slowed the kiss down, pulling himself back until their lips were just brushing gently. His eyes fluttered open, and he couldn’t help but feel pleased when he saw how blown Cas’ had gotten as they kissed. He knew his probably matched, but he a part of him still swelled with pride at the thought that
“I just… I don’t want you to think you’re not enough, exactly the way you are. You’re- you’re my

I've also been barely around it because the group involves my ex best friend and i didn't know how to handle stuff.
Dean had expected Sam to be when he figured out what Dean had done to save him. He just hadn’t expected

, but they definitely stemmed from his belief that Dean would be happier without having him for a soulmate.
Cas cocked his head slightly, one eyebrow raised.
Dean froze for a moment, a wave of repulsion washing through him as he fully considered the implications of both his and Cas’ words, before making a conscious effort to shake it off as he reached to take the pan off the heat.
So, he went on dates.
I’m writing and posting this from my phone and then collapsing into bed I’ll do all my usual clean up shit and comment replies (if there are any djsjsk) tomorrow ✨

Because yeah, Dean was a little bit silly about it sometimes. This entire exercise was proof of that. But that didn’t stop the fear he felt from being very real, and the near-constant teasing he’d faced over the issue hadn’t made him any more inclined to give flying a go, especially when he felt he couldn’t trust his friends to take him and his boundaries around it seriously.
The third thing he does, after accidentally falling asleep in Cas’ mostly unused bed in the early hours of the morning, is sit down at the dining table, look Sam straight in the eyes, and tell him on no uncertain terms that he is going to find a way to pull Cas back out of the Empty, with or without Sam’s help, and he’d like to know which of the two options he’d be taking.

It was incredibly clear he was a man on a mission, and time was no concern for anyone up here.
Dean paused, surprised.
and they left him with a vague sense of longing when he awoke.
“Huh indeed.”
“I’d ask if I’m really that obvious but I know what the answer would be and I don’t wanna hear it.”
He used to just get up out of bed, head to the kitchen for a drink or pull out his laptop to quietly watch a couple of episodes of whatever he was feeling that night, eventually exhausting himself enough that he had no options
It was this frustration that led him where he was now, standing awkwardly outside the room the maid’s had informed him was Castiel’s. He hesitated for a second, but gave in to his desire and reached out to knock awkwardly on the heavy door.
Dean grinned before nudging Cas with his shoulder fondly.
A light flush rose on Cas’ cheeks, but he didn’t drop Dean’s gaze.
any physical changes, not like he would expect in the wake of a spell landing, but with the adrenaline from the fight he hadn’t really thought of it beyond an instant ‘Oh cool, I’m not dead, now let's gank this bitch.’.
“Want some more easy ammunition?” He asked, and she raised an obvious eyebrow at the thought that that was even in question. “I… may have dropped a mug the first time he came into the café.”
“Benny was the son of one of the previous royal guards,” Dean explained, “So he’s been training at the castle for most of his life. We actually trained together when I went through combat classes, and we’ve been friends ever since.”
“She came over to say hi and I noticed her shirt. I thought you would like it, so I told her about you.”

However it had been decided, Dean wasn’t going to complain. He doubted he’d have been able to walk as elegantly as Castiel seemed to be, the years of court training never fully getting rid of the gait his bowed legs gave him.
He had a feeling Cas would be reminding him of exactly how happy they both deserved to be very, very soon.
Of course, he hadn’t accounted for the possibility that he’d develop a

Dean sighed, honestly a little embarrassed.
Thing is, Dean knew it was sometimes ridiculous. He was willing to do almost anything to get a smile out of his partner, too in love with the soft looks he was rewarded with to care about the personal effort or loss that was involved in that quest.
“Are you alright, Dean?”
“Come on Cas, I think it’s just about bed-time now.”
Dean had known this day was to come for years now, even if he hadn’t known the exact details. Love matches were uncommon in royalty, and he’d never harboured any illusions that he would be able to form his own. He just wished he’d gotten to meet the guy he was to spend the rest of his life with in-person, before all the stress and formality that would come with their ceremony surrounding their nuptials. But he didn’t exactly get a choice in these things.

this would theoretically b where i finished the full fic if i ever properly finish it up and publish it separately, so unless i go back and fill in the gaps in future drabbles this might be the End Of This AU. or i might add a fluffy established relationship drabble or two. we shall see.
“So?” Sammy asked, a bright grin on his face.
Dean hesitated for a moment, then decided that admitting to his shame was probably better than her hearing it from Benny somewhere down the line.
He could try to leave now, of course, slipping out of his bonds and hoping he’d make it out of the camp without being noticed, but that seemed risky. While staying in place fighting the goblins head-on was no safer, at least he’d have the element of surprise on his side.
“Aw, shucks, Cas,” Dean said, ducking his head as he felt his face heat, but his dropped gaze didn’t conceal his red cheeks or genuine smile from Cas’ view.
For as long as he can remember, Dean’s been hiding the mark on his right forearm.
this just popped into my brain today, idk if its going anywhere but i do have ideas!
“Ah, and you decided you needed a bit of a pick-me-up before spending a few hours in his company? I can relate. I love my younger brother — Sammy — but he’s got a boundless amount of enthusiasm about him, and it can be a bit much to deal with sometimes.”

“Ah, those days suck. You having issues with the coffee machine?”
As he spoke, Cas brought his hand up to rub at his eyes in an incredibly human gesture, forgetting his forearm was uncovered in his frustration at his own inability to explain things with any modicum of ease. It wasn’t until he heard the clatter of the antiseptic hitting the floor that he realised what he’d just done.

It was obvious that they needed a different plan of attack. Jack had tried calling Cas to him, annoyed that he hadn’t thought to somehow prevent the angel from leaving that first time, but at least Dean now had visual confirmation that he was out. That he was

Predictably, Sam’s second attempt to pull Dean away from his research for an hour failed as miserably as the first had. He left it another day, texting Eileen (who was off on a salt-and-burn for the weekend) about his lack of progress with both Dean and the research, and they formulated a different plan of attack.

And that was without even getting into that whole ‘free-will’ thing. What’s the difference between expectation and choice when the individual placing expectations on you had the power to manipulate your every move? Who was to say that every single decision he’d ever made in his life hadn’t been manipulated by Chuck because of whatever stupid scheme his power-crazy mind had thought up this time?
