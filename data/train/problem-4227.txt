The aforementioned man decided to slip into the kitchen at that moment. After he kissed his future wife on the forehead and snatched the coffee from her, he plopped down at the table and looked around—probably for the previous topic of conversation. Before he could even open his mouth to ask about it and before Dean could even answer the question, Castiel chose to reappear to the three of them.
Sure, Dean had heard about that sort of stuff, but he still raised a brow and asked, "People can do that?" Castiel looked hesitant to answer, so Dean dropped it—not like he wanted to make himself look suspicious with, what could be considered, interest. "Must have a lot of juice to keep you out, huh?"
Pastor Jim nodded toward the brothers as he passed them, but didn't stop to talk, but Castiel noticed. "Who was that man?"
, he and Sam were stuck with the most socially awkward angel.
“Your soul is marked for heaven. Foul language isn’t going to threaten that, Dean.” Castiel shot back and looked at Dean as if he was a dumbass because he actually believed that.
Most humans had rolled over for the heavenly host, but there were resistance movements across the world. From what little information they received from public service announcements, those who rebelled against the heavenly hierarchy were sometimes able to kill off a few angels before they were discovered and removed, but it was never enough to make a dent in the angelic population or cure the world of the angels. Dean didn't think humans would ever make a dent as long as he was alive. Maybe in the future, but not with how the world was now, it seemed. And because resistance movements never lasted since people feared their angelic oppressors or since they were forcefully ended in bloodshed, one of the few times that Dean had ever screamed at his father was when he found out that John had formed a group of people to resist the angels.
What the hell were you supposed to say to that? What could someone possibly say to an angel when that celestial being admitted that the reason he decided falling from the good graces of heaven was totally worth it because he believed in
He hadn’t noticed that his eyes had dropped to the floor, but when he looked back up, Castiel had flown off, and, really, what a surprise that was.
anymore—The Holy Year had been the best for humanity. Petty human problems such as disease and pollution were cleaned up and the nasty human conflicts immediately ended because who the hell wanted to argue with beings that literally crashed to Earth and didn't bat an eye about it? Those who had no faith before The Crash had flocked to churches in order to repent for their ignorance and the religious had fallen to their knees to worship the gods among mere mortals.
Uriel spoke up and stared at his brother with an expression mixed with fury and disgust. “You’ve been compromised, Castiel.”
"What can we do for you fellas?" Bobby asked and even he attempted to be civil, too.
It was around the two month mark of Castiel in the house that everyone learned to accept his presence and was finally comfortable to have him around. Rather than awkwardly dance around him in the kitchen, Jessica actively tried to involve him with their daily routines or conversations. And it dawned on Sam at some point or another that Castiel had been alive since pretty much the dawn of time and, since Sam was the nerdiest nerd to ever nerd, he asked the angel a lot of questions about history or about how the world worked or whatever topic he came up with that day. To Dean’s shock, Castiel actually enjoyed the conversations, loved to talk about humanity and their history. Jessica and Dean teased them both to no end, but, hell, he learned a lot when he eavesdropped every now and then.
was spooked and told you to run, it was best to turn tail and run and not ask any questions and that was exactly what Dean and Sam did. It would’ve helped, though, if some invisible force hadn’t tossed both brothers into the walls on each end of the sanctuary.
“I used to help people, Dean. No one knew about it, of course, but I would watch over travelers. That had been my main purpose in heaven. If they were lost, I would help to point them in the right direction. If they were too hot, I’d let them have a cool breeze. I would help some edible plants grow around them if they were in desperate need of food. I…” He stared down at his hands. “I did more. But now…all I do is watch humans cower when I walk by or stare at me spitefully like you used to do. I…it makes me very unhappy.”
Bobby apparently didn't appreciate his tone because he shot a scowl back at Dean. "For someone that doesn't want to be in charge, you sure do know how to bark orders." He rolled his eyes and slid out of the car. "See y'all soon, idjits."
To travel, a person needed both special permission to do so and some bank to back it up. So, most of the time, the people who traveled across the nation were members of the church. Now, there were some people, such as professional hunters, who had the chance to do it from time to time, but since motels were nonexistent, hunters had to find people to hole up with. Professional was a loose term when it came to people like Dean, but there were some hunters out there that earned the title and when they needed a place to stay, it was with church officials. As stated before, Dean was an unprofessional hunter and hated to keep with people of the church because most of them were pompous and loved to hear themselves talk. So, when they had the chance, they holed up with some other hunters or friends of the friends and if there wasn’t anyone around that they knew then they camped out.
Dean stayed in his bedroom and never answered anyone, not even when Jessica knocked on his door and told him that dinner was done.
"I don't know. I just--" Lenore wrapped her arms around herself and took a deep, stabilizing breath. "I've been looking for her for so long. Heaven is the last place left to search. I cannot go there." She turned her head and looked down at Castiel, the glow in her eyes an obvious plea. "But you can."
Sam runs a hand through his hair and makes a strangled sound in his throat. “I didn’t. I don’t know why. It was like-- like I forgot I could or something.”
“He insisted.”
"And what does that mean?"
“But--” Aaron started to protest.
When he found Dean sleeping in an armchair with a pile of books nearby, Castiel wanted to whisper it in his ear as he covered him with a soft blanket.
“Is Dean well?” Castiel asked.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel’s smile was brighter than the sun in the cloudless sky. “I think you are correct.”
Dean treasured every morning. Castiel did not always sleep. He would spend the night writing his records, continuing his research, or combing over the Metatron’s prophecy. He would work in the bed while Dean slept. Every time Dean opened his eyes, Castiel was beside him. Some mornings, however, Dean would wake up to a sleeping Castiel, arms wrapped around him like he was something precious, something worth holding.
Cas was already sitting in his seat and watching Dean with that head tilt by the time Dean figured out he was standing around like a dumbass. He closed the door for Cas, then moved to settle in behind the wheel.
Oh. The ‘turn down the volume’ gesture. Dean finds the fact that Cas uses it and that it works adorable. Dean remembers teaching Cas that move.
“About time.”
Cas stands up straight and brings his closed fist to his chest. When he opens it, he reveals a bright, blinding sphere of light. Beams of light containing every colour of the rainbow cut through the Empty’s nothingness. It extends and lengthens in Cas’s hand until it takes the shape of a sword. Cas grasps the handle and glows along with it. The light releases Sam and Dean and returns to Cas. Instead of two white wings like before, there are six, each one a different colour of the rainbow.
Aaron opened his mouth to reply, but Dean spoke first.
Joshua entered the room. He picked his steps with deliberate care, struggling to remain upright on the unstable floor. When he knelt on the floor on the other side of Dean, Castiel could not muster a greeting.
It still hurt. Castiel shifted his legs, trying not to cry out. “I’m can be useful, Dean.”
“Aw, don’t be,” Dean said, “I wore it like a mark of honour.”
"Cas," Dean said, "you look like a spaceman. And you're gonna have to wear some shoes before you get tetanus or something."
The blacksmiths were heard before they were seen. The sound of hammers against metal rang down the path. During working hours, the noise rarely stopped. All the blacksmiths needed to complete as many weapons and pieces of armour as possible. The army was hungry for resources.
"Are we gonna keep going in circles, here?" Dean made no effort to back away from Castiel's closeness. "You're Cas. It doesn't matter what else you are."
Before Dean could reach it, the portal opened. A mass of beige fell out, landing hard. The flowers trembled at the impact, a shockwave felt all across the meadow. The second the whatever-that-was landed, the portal collapsed around itself and disappeared.
“Yes, yes. That would be down this way.” Frank pointed around the corner. “Follow me.” He started down the hallway.
Sam squinted at Dean, unable to see his face in the dark. “Are you drunk?”
“Cas!”
“I’m thrilled.” Dean finished his journey to the door. Meg tracked every movement.
“I know it hasn’t been that long and everything is so new but--” Sam closed his eyes. He took a breath. “I’ll always go as slow as you want and wait as long as you need. I don’t expect you to say it back but--”
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.” Dean casts his arms wide, encompassing the entirety of his Heaven, his bleak, quiet, Heaven full of vast open spaces. “This is it? Where are all the people? If you did have a wife, wouldn’t she be here? And where’s Ellen and Jo and Charlie? Did Kevin make it here? Where’s…”
Every last hound converged on Dean. By the time Castiel realized what was happening, by the time Castiel turned around, he had already lost Dean. The hellhounds ripped into Dean’s armour, claw marks appearing from nowhere, and Dean fell to the ground.
“Good.” Castiel’s voice was a whisper now. “Aim.”
Sam helped him. The pungent smell of bleach permeated the air as Sam applied it to the ends of Castiel’s hair with a brush, his lips pursed in concentration. Sam grabbed another strip of aluminum foil from the pile of tools next to the sink and started on another section.
It’s afternoon by the time Baby is patched up and they finally end up in the garden.
“You’re hurt,” he says, weakly reaching up and pointing at the wound near Dean’s shoulder.
Dean nods. “Yep, I’m heading into the garage in about twenty minutes. I wanted to make you breakfast, though. You seemed a little out of it this morning so I figured you needed a pick-me-up.”
“Not gonna happen. He’s all mine, at least until after he pushes this pretty little angel blade through your heart.” Verna spins the blade between her fingers, angling the deadly end towards Cas. There’s a saunter in her walk, so unlike Dean’s.
He does. This is a dream, after all. Dean sighs, mouth quirking up into the hint of a smile before leaning in to press their lips together.
be him.”
“You deserve good things too, Dean.”
Even in sleep, Dean remains the most beautiful human Castiel has ever seen -- the soft rise and fall of his chest, his lips slightly parted, palms pressed together almost in prayer beneath the pillow. His soul shines bright, vibrating a melodic sound, calling out to Castiel’s grace.
Dean pulls back at some point, desperate for air, dragging his mouth down Cas' jawline and panting against his skin. “Can we?” Dean gasps, kissing the notch of skin beneath Cas’ ear. He doesn’t finish his sentence, but Cas doesn’t need him to.
Dean falls to his knees, crying out in pain. “She’s one strong motherfucker, you gotta hurry. Get the lighter, it’s in the front pocket of my bag.”
“That’s okay, I just wanted to see you.”
“What do you mean?” Cas’ eyebrows crinkle in confusion and he tilts his head in that ever so familiar way that makes Dean’s heart warm with love for him.
Doubt is a fickle thing. At the first instance of it growing inside him, intertwining with his grace, Castiel leaves. He flies away from Earth, the planes of heaven to the far stretches of the galaxy until he’s outside looking in -- far from his brethren and most importantly, Dean. Here, the Milky Way exists as a twirling speck of dust, sparkling with thousands of stars, all in the process of dying, some of which Castiel placed with his own hand, spun into existence from sun-rays, morphed into stardust.
Kevin scrambled to his knees. He gripped the gate with both hands and pressed his face against the bars. The whites of his eyes shone.
Pushing his bowl away, Dean sighed. He tapped his hands on the bartop a few times before he glanced at Ellen. “Okay, but you’re gonna need to share that whiskey.”
“I can’t,” Cas breathes.
“Wait here,” Garth said. “Keep your eyes closed.”
For a reason unknown to Dean, he desperately needed Castiel’s approval of Lawrence and Lawrence’s approval of Castiel. Dean chose not to examine his feelings. Instead, he finished off his beer, nodded to Castiel, and returned to the bar.
Blood rushed in Sam’s ears as he placed the ring on his bedside table. Completely awake now, Sam failed to reply. He could tell that Dean was close now, teetering on the edge of saying how he felt, and all Sam could do was stare at the outline of Dean’s face beside him.
Cas kissed Dean.
“What kind of idiot doesn’t wear his damn armour?” Dean muttered.
Dean worked his jaw up and down, struggling to find something to say.
“From a distance. He still doesn’t like me.” Dean reached a hand out to Seraph, who huffed and retreated to the back of his stall before Dean could touch him.
Sam knew about Dean and Cas. Dean lost the last sliver of hope that Sam hadn't noticed Dean’s feelings for Cas the night he drunkenly blubbered all over Sam’s shoulder about it. It wasn't pretty.
“Baking is relaxing,” Cas said, “and you enjoy the result immensely.”
“Balthazar.” Castiel was not bound by Balthazar's magic but he knew any uncalculated movements could bring disaster. “What
Dean’s treacherous mind made him wonder what that would sound like in a completely different context and that was not helping with the relaxing. Not at all. He forced his fingers to become less tense.
“Make sure you give those back when we’re gone,” Dean said. "Say I forgot it or something."
“Hey.” Ellen squeezed his hand.
Castiel nodded.
“Good. Now I would
With a deep, stabilizing, breath Sam returned to his chair. He looked at Castiel. “Will he help us?”
“Been better,” Sam said, his voice distant even to himself.
But Dean doesn’t hide. He stares right back, trying to reflect back even half of what Cas so easily gives. Dean tries because Cas is here, Cas is real, and Cas deserves everything.
Captain Singer sighed. “Are we gonna get started or do I have to listen to this?”
Dean did not understand but, when Castiel looked into Dean’s eyes with a real smile on his face this time, Dean learned he loved it when he made people smile.
"Hey. Hey, c'mon buddy, don't cry." Dean used the hem of his flannel to wipe Baby Cas's eyes dry. "If you cry, I'll cry and then Sam'll make fun of us."
"Yeah," an uncooperative person— also known as Dean— agreed, "I guess I'll try."
“You-- You just say stuff like that,” Dean muttered into his lap. He took another breath, deeper than the last. “Well, why don’t you come with me, then?”
“He’s just a boy,” the first guard said.
“Let me know if you come up with some good lines. I’m running out.”
“Hey,” Balthazar said, sitting directly beside Castiel, “I wasn’t expecting your call so soon.”
"So what? Nothing we do is legal." Sam waved a dismissive hand. "We'll have a big ol' party. Invite Jody and the girls; Garth and his wife; Max and Alicia. It'll be fun."
“Yeah,” Benny said. “I ain’t much help with the healin’ but I do swing a weapon alright. And I know Andrea’s been itchin’ to get outta here. So, if Sam’s headin’ out there then…”
A hacking cough wracked the werewolf. He spat blood at Dean’s feet, then looked up with a smile. Blood dripped from his teeth.
“I don’t know what that means.”
A little while later, Sam ordered himself another beer and another water for Dean. They spent the night in Andrea’s Tavern, talking about anything and everything: their future plans, the latest gossip about the castle servants and knights, the fact that neither of them knew much about farming despite the fact they lived in a farming village most of their lives.
“Have you heard about someone named Metatron?”
“Did you know,” Sam said as he entered the room, “you got Ash to quit now? Guess you’re stuck with me.”
“Hey.” Pamela found Jo’s hand with no trouble. She held it tight. “I just like to flirt. You know I’m committed.”
“You told me to not return to your office for a long time.” Castiel took a tentative step inside. “Has it been long enough?”
“You are the Angel.”
“What? A guy can’t keep a snack for later?” Dean rolled his eyes.
"S’alright, chief," the bartender said. "You look like you need the hard stuff."
Still panting, still covered in the sheen of sweet, Dean kissed Cas and whispered, “I love you.”
Wow, this doctor seemed, like, super fond of Dean. That was nice.
Dean’s world has long since expanded beyond his car and his brother. Those are only two pieces to the larger whole of Dean’s life. There’s more to it than that. Family doesn’t end in blood.
Don't be afraid to tell me what you think! I love interacting with readers. :)
Castiel stared out over the dance floor. He did not reply. Dean grinned and let up on the teasing. At least, for as long as it took him to check on the still sleeping Aaron. He ordered some water from Jamie. Aaron would need it.
“What,” Sam began, his breaths uneven, “what did you do to me?”
“Yeah, now c’mon.” Dean raised his left hand. “Take my hand.”
A rusty shovel slammed the female vampire's head, distracting her long enough for Castiel to free his arm. She snarled and spun around, her foot hitting Dean square on the chest. The kick sent him flying into a dark corner. Castiel fought the urge to run after Dean and leave the enemy unsecured. As a result, Castiel hesitated, giving the vampire a chance to recover. He fell into a defensive crouch, cursing his mistake.
Since his brain had yet to kick on, it slipped his mind that they had a temporary…guest—and that had been the most polite way to put what the angel was—and he almost broke the cup he grabbed from the cabinet when he saw Castiel seated at the kitchen table where Jessica had left him before they went to bed. It was eerie how he sat still at the table, no movement whatsoever—not even the rise and fall of his chest. Not only did it disturb him, it also added to his crankiness. Unfortunately, the man seated at their table had infinite cosmic power and could smite Dean if he was annoyed by complaints.
“Oh, I know about Azazel.” Zachariah had the nerve to tilt his head up a little and stare down at them. “I’ve known about him the whole time, Castiel. Azazel was the demon John Winchester sold his soul to.” He then looked between Sam and Dean. “So, boys, you must’ve made one hell of a deal not to sell your souls. What’s Azazel’s plan, hmm? What does he want from you?”
“We didn’t know…” Elizabeth repeated in a whisper. She paused and then reached out to grab his sleeve, pleading for him to lie when she asked, “Did we really…
After what Castiel said about Dean, about all the faith he had in him and humanity, the least he could do for Castiel was shut up when he needed him to. “Yeah, sure, Cas,” he carefully dropped back down onto the floor so that he could start to finish up repair on the sink.
“Don’t strain yourself, Castiel. Here I am.”
Castiel tilted his head to the side and turned to examine said picture. When he turned back around to face Dean, he frowned. “Absolutely not,” he sounded pretty offended that Dean even asked that question. “Heaven is not one place. Well, for a human soul, I suppose it is.” He must have seen how confused Dean looked because he backtracked and tried to explain better. “One soul has its own personal heaven. Therefore, heaven is made up of many heavens. And, of course, there’s the garden in the center.”
“Wow.” Dean croaked as he stumbled to his feet. “Uh, thanks,” he mumbled and watched as Castiel walked over to repeat the same process with Sam. “Are you okay?” He asked the brunet as he went to help his brother to his feet since he had fallen down once Tammi wasn’t pinning him to the wall anymore.
to babysit Dean and Sam.
"We can and we will, boy." Zachariah taunted before he completely disappeared.
Six minutes into the song, Castiel commented on the music with, “This is a very beautiful song.” Dean craned his head to look over his shoulder at the angel, but his blue eyes were focused on the windshield of the car rather than him. “I wished they would’ve allowed you to keep music. It’s always amazed me how you’ve been able to use it as a way to express yourselves.” He said wistfully.
“Well, hey, at least you care enough to make us feel comfortable. I haven’t met many of you guys, but most of them are dicks.” Again, Dean tried making Castiel feel better and he had no idea why. Hell, maybe it was because, in the back of his head, he knew he’d be stuck with the angel for a while and it’d be better to get along with him rather than hash it out all the time. Or maybe it was because he didn’t like to watch a grown man cry…or an angel in the body of a grown man. “Especially that dude with you the first time we met. What was his name?”
“I don’t understand. What am I doing wrong?” Castiel questioned.
It was hard to believe, but Dean was actually kind of excited to show Castiel his collection of classic rock tapes.
Dean has some less than platonic desires around Castiel. So, of course it makes sense for him to try and get laid...with people that are not Castiel. Yeah, nice work on that one, Dean.
“Thank you.” Castiel muttered as he stepped over the charred ring. “I think it would be best for you to leave before Azazel decides to return.” He looked down at the floor, clearly disturbed. “I need to leave. I have to speak with Zachariah immediately and inform him about this.”
Dean meets Sam’s eyes, finds him looking back, despondent. Looking over at Cas, Dean remembers Purgatory, remembers his prayer, remembers the relief he felt rounding the corner and finding Cas there, waiting for him. He’d held onto his anger for so long, let it fester until it ate him up from the inside out and turned him into someone he doesn’t like.
“We got a king? That work?” Arnold asks.
He leans back, taking the sight of Dean in -- flushed cheeks, swollen lips, messy hair, and pupils dilated in arousal. “Gorgeous,” Cas murmurs, approvingly. He smiles when Dean blushes more, ducking his head. Cas feels Dean’s fingers brush his own, as they slip under Dean’s t-shirt and pull it off in one smooth motion.
— the threat of rejection born in his own lingering self-hatred still clings to him.
“I’ll be right back with your drinks, let me know if you need anything.” She takes their menus, and her gaze lingers on Cas a little too long for Dean’s liking before she flounces away, braid bobbing behind her.
Somehow they manage to strip down and make it into the shower without tripping over each other. Dean’s hands are back on him the minute they get under the hot steam, touching his chest, fingers tracing the dip of his collarbones. He rolls a thumb over Cas’ nipple, getting Cas to gasp, open-mouthed into the kiss.
“What about you, Cas?” Dean asks. Cas looks over right as Dean is taking a long drag off his beer, lips spread obscenely over the head of the bottle. “What are you gonna do since you’re not helping out Jack anymore?”
like Dean. And despite all pretense, Cas’ weakness has always been him. He slams his eyes shut and shakes his head, even as Dean audibly sniffles, starting to cry and presses his forehead against Cas’, bumping their nose together.
Dean turns towards the noise, gun cocked and instantly goes lax when he sees Cas sitting up against a tree.
He’s worn this for a while, what year
sees Dean. Dirt streaks cover his face, dotted over his cheeks and forehead. There are tear stains by his nose, gaps where the dirt washed free, skin shiny in the low light. There’s a wide gash right below his collarbone, seeping blood into his shirt. But it’s Dean,
This is what he’ll miss once he leaves, the casual touches, the softness Cas knows his Dean has inside him but refuses to let show. He hopes that one day someone will be able to bring that side of him out. Cas will do what he needs to in order to make sure Dean has that chance. After all he’s been through in his life, Dean deserves something good, even if Cas isn’t there to witness it.
The bed feels cold now, with Dean’s absence. Cas’ heart is still pounding from the events of the past few minutes. He feels incredibly stupid that his body betrayed him in sleep, clinging to Dean like that. He’s still reeling from the Djinn dream, his mind confused after spending a few days of bliss there. He groans to himself, the sound loud in the empty room, and heaves himself out of bed and into the shower.
Despite the lack of noise and a few missing pieces here or there scattered throughout Heaven that Jack and Cas haven’t gotten to yet, everything is almost perfect.
About how you feel for Dean, how you always have. And I don’t like secrets, they only cause pain.” Verna pauses a few feet from Cas, tilts her head and taps a finger on her lip. “It seems as though you’ve already caused him so much pain, but you won’t any more.” Verna’s face darkens and she tightens her grip on the angel blade.
Dean smirks and revs the engine and stuffs a handful of M&M’s into his mouth. “Thanks for not ruining my car.”
Cas squeezes back and nestles his head in between the crook of Dean’s shoulder, lips soft against Dean's neck. “Holy.”
“Don’t know if it’s serious, but Sam told me it felt right, so he was gonna go for it. Kid deserves something good after all the hell we’ve been through, and if she makes him happy that’s all I could ever want for him.”
On Earth, Dean had dreams of one day retiring to the coast, toes in the sand and all that.  Somewhere warmer, maybe Northern California, where the roads cling to cliffs and look down over indigo crashing waves. It wouldn’t have had to be much, even just renting a small cabin for a few weeks and taking some time away post-Chuck. A break, he’d wanted a break. A place where he could find solace, a little peace of his own Heaven on Earth with Sam and Cas at his side.
If this is the future, Cas would be more than okay with this.
“I understand,” Cas admits.
“Have you ever thought about cooking, as more than just a hobby?” Cas asks.
Cas gets up from his spot on the opposite bed and crosses to the mirror. Gingerly, he reaches out and touches the smooth surface, jerking his hand back almost immediately after making contact. “That’s... strange.”
It can’t end like this.
“Maybe? I’m not sure. It seems like she had a secret and she was cheating, but that doesn’t match the other vics.” Sam pulls up another article of a similar death from a few weeks prior and angles the screen towards Dean. “Stacey Lane. She was just a teenager, but it turns out after an investigation of her laptop that she had been hiding her sexuality from her family. She wanted to tell them but didn’t know how. I think it has to do with confessing, that if you don’t do it in the amount of time the spirit thinks you should, they come after you and punish you for being dishonest.”
Now, with the heat of the shower and his own thoughts of Dean floating around his brain, his desire has returned.
He adjusts the sign, tilting it up so it’s even again and then looks over at Dean, the hint of a smile playing on his lips. “Shall we go inside?”
Cas nods, thinking about earlier, about his astonishment at seeing the ring on his own finger. He’s still not quite sure if this is
“See you,” Cas answers, a little breathless.
“It’s very pretty,” Cas says.
“Yeah?” Dean says, a little breathless. Unable to help himself, he reaches out and claps a hand on Cas’ shoulder, squeezing tight, feeling the warmth of him beneath the trench coat. He’s finally here, with Dean, and everything feels like it’s falling into place. “Let’s go inside.”
“Yes,” Cas breathes. His teeth catch Dean’s bottom lip and tug. “Anything you want, Dean. Anything.”
“Shit.” Dean steps back and over, rising up on his toes and starts to saw through the rope binding Cas’ hands. “Cas?” He tries, louder. “I know you can hear me, and wherever this djinn sent you I’m sure it’s grand. But you gotta get out of there.”
Dean ducks, but not quick enough, and he feels the hot white flame of the Djinn’s hand graze his cheek. It lingers on his skin and sends a deep shiver down his neck. Darting back and away, Dean flings his leg out, hitting the Djinn in the thigh and causing it to stumble back a few steps. Regrouping quickly, the Djinn jumps forward before Dean has fully recovered, and gets him around his neck. A glowing hand reaches for his face, but Dean shoves an elbow straight back, striking the djinn hard in the sternum. Crying out, the Djinn’s grip loosens and Dean slips out of its grasp.
He comes nearly a minute later, barely managing to warn Dean with a sharp tug on his hair, before coating his mouth and chin. The sight of Dean on his knees, come dripping off his lips, and his cock hard and aching pressed up against his stomach is too much for Cas to deal with.
Weeks pass and on the outside, Cas’ life with Dean is seemingly perfect. But it’s the little differences, adding up one by one, that make this new peaceful future feel off.
Often, Cas wonders if Dean yearns for physical companionship in ways Cas cannot fulfill for him, though he would be eager to if Dean would have him. If that is the case, Dean doesn’t search it out. Dean stays to the house mostly, and when he leaves Cas finds him fishing or visiting with his family and friends. Miracle stays at his side, even on the dock, wagging her tail and barking excitedly when Dean catches something, large bass usually that Dean cooks later on that evening for dinner. Sometimes they’ll both head over to Harvelle’s to chat with Bobby, Ellen, and Jo. They visit with Sam and Eileen often, now that she’s arrived, and Dean’s parents, usually when John is gone. Cas knows that as much as Dean respects his father, he intends to avoid him, even here, as much as he can. His mother though, Dean finds time to spend with her often, still trying to make up for his lost childhood.
He turns his gaze back to the forest floor in front of him and focuses on keeping in step with Dean. He tightens his hold on Dean’s jacket, and rests the side of his head against Dean’s while they walk. Dean doesn’t comment on the touch and continues walking, so that must mean it’s okay. Cas will pretend it’s enough, because it’s all he has. Coming back to the real world, where he can’t touch Dean as he wants, is a special kind of agony.
“Dean,” Cas says, firm, ducking as Verna takes a swing at him, the blade whooshing through the air above his head. “Fight this.”
“Thanks,” Dean says. He watches as Cas tugs on the edge with nimble fingers until it pops off the wall. It looks heavy, but Cas carries it with ease, still angelic enough to have superhuman strength - and damn, if that ain’t hot.
They share breath, and Dean takes the heat of Cas’ weighted gaze, feels it to the depths of his soul, and it’s
“A bit, but it will grow back.” Cas kneels down and scoops up some dirt, covering the feather with it. Closing his eyes, he pictures a bird; small black beak, with golden wings and green down feathers. Rain Song drifts in his head, playing from the record player earlier this morning during breakfast. Cas mimics the noise in his head, pitching it into birdsong. He throws his hands and the dirt-feather mixture straight up into the sky. A dozen birds leap off his fingertips, shooting high up into the sky and swooping through the trees, singing to each other and to the world.
It’s the sound of his name, wrecked in Dean’s voice, that pushes Cas over the edge. He kisses Dean through it, even as Dean’s body shakes in aftershocks. Cas rolls his hips a few more times, chasing the high that is now fading into a dreamy sort of bliss.
Later, in the kitchen, Cas stands across the island from Dean, his fingers covered in water from washing tomatoes. He’s helping Dean prep vegetables for dinner, though Dean has yet to tell him what they’re cooking.
While they kiss, Cas walks Dean backwards, until Dean’s ass bumps into the altar. Cas’s hands drop down and go for his hips, easily lifting him up on top of the surface and crowding between his legs. Pausing Dean parts his thighs and nudges Cas forward so his thigh slots between Dean’s legs.
“Looks like it.”

Castiel can’t answer his own mind, why of all the humans in the entirety of creation that it’s Dean that gets to him. In less than a hundred years Dean will die like all the others, gone back to dust and Castiel will live on for millions of years, with only Dean’s memory tied to his grace, an invisible string, keeping Dean with him, always.
“Yep! I’ve made it for Sam a few times over the years, never really got to until we moved to the Bunker though, never had a kitchen that was big enough or with enough space for all the ingredients.”
“Dean, I love you more than anything in the universe.”
“Yes, even then,” Cas says, after a moment. Before Dean has a chance to process just what
Dean can only hope that he finds him in time.
Inside the lobby, there’s a line-up of guests at the counter, odd for this time of night. Cas waits behind them anyway, stuffing his hands into his jeans pockets. A tired older woman with pin-tight curls is working behind the desk, loudly smacking on gum.
Cas turns back to look at him, eyebrows arched in confusion. “What?” Sunrays cascade down the sleek back of his trench coat, dancing over the wooden floor when he moves.
“Even in the Empty?” Dean asks. He thinks of the words he said then, in the hours after Cas was taken from him as he sat on the cold cement floor of the dungeon, and later sprawled out on the Bunker’s floor, alcohol soaring in his veins.
“So,” Dean asks. “What did you think?”
“It will be ready in a few hours, I’m gonna go put on some music. Whatcha wanna listen to?” Dean asks. He pats his hands dry on the apron and heads into the next room.
The other man’s head tilted to the side. “Uriel’s the funniest angel in the garrison. Ask anybody.” Then, he must’ve reran Dean’s comment through his mind and almost looked bashful when he said, “Oh. That was sarcasm, wasn’t it?”
? There wasn’t a damn thing, that’s what, because it took your breath away. It left you, some tiny, insignificant protozoa, feeling like you were the center of someone’s universe which consisted of billions of galaxies and suns.
Dean: I'm GoNnA dO thE tHiNg!!!
As soon as Zachariah’s voice echoed across the sanctuary, Castiel’s entire body tensed and he stood up to his full height, as if he were a soldier being addressed by a commanding officer which was basically what it was like except with more…feathers. Dean noticed that, behind their superior, Uriel stood and he looked so smug that it made his stomach twist around into a knot. Something wasn't right. There was no way that the angels would show up so soon after the demons left. There had to be
to stop with the whole Houdini act.” Castiel’s face scrunched up in confusion and Dean groaned. “We’ve been over this before. Humans aren’t used to someone popping up in the room any time they want to, and the same goes for disappearing in the middle of a conversation, too. If you want us to be more comfortable around you, you have to act
“You’re okay, Cas. I’m fine. Just…have to figure out what I’m gonna tell the lovebirds when they ask why I never told them about it.”

Still, Dean found that he liked to hunt with Castiel. He had these little quirks that made Dean smile. He would taste some stuff that Dean ate on the road at secret stops he and the family had come to know over the years and would make a face because “it tastes like molecules. That isn’t pleasant, Dean.” Of course there was the whole head tilt and squint thing he did when he was confused by some human habit or whatever. Also, when Dean made some reference to modern culture, Castiel had a habit of looking exasperated and saying, “I don’t understand that reference.”
Dean never would’ve imagined that he would see the same house on fire a second time and that another woman he loved with all his heart would be inside.
Dean fully expected there to be more supernatural throws to the wall because the dude didn’t seem like the one to take no for an answer, but he merely hummed and smirked darkly at them—a trait, Dean noticed, that ran in the demonic family. “I can appreciate your spirit, kids.” He winked. “But I’m pretty sure you’ll come around sooner or later, so you know how to find me.”
Dean would never ever make the mistake to think that Castiel was some little, nerdy, holy tax accountant who spent all his time in the clouds ever again. He was another member of the Holy Host who kept the human population under their control.
God, he sounded like Sam the moment he and Jessica started to date. All the kid could do for a week was talk about how cute Jessica was when she did this or how adorable she was when she did that. Dean was happy for him, but Jesus, he wasn’t sure how he didn’t end up with diabetes after that week.
Dean couldn’t help but snort at that. “Simpler, yeah,” he remarked sarcastically. “Most of the time, we have no idea what we’re doing down here. That’s why your pals came down to babysit us, isn’t it?” Yeah, that was not the best thing to say. Dean released a frustrated moan before he stood up suddenly and walked around the campfire to sit beside Castiel. “But I don’t think I’d ever want to be more than human. We fuck up a lot, but…I don’t know. I wish you,” he waved at Castiel, “could sit down and have one of those moments where you look around and think, ‘yeah, this is my life and it sucks sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade it for a damn thing’.”
"I think you could consider it...ironic, actually." Castiel commented and that actually piqued his interest. "The wards are simple and a specific spell that can banish us can be created with human blood. We are powerful, yes, but the blood of a human could banish us in an instant." He shook his head. "I supposed this is another reason humans continue to amaze me." Then, he looked like he actually paled a little when he must’ve realized what kind of information he dished out.
“Incorporeal?
“I find your sarcasm to be in poor taste, Dean.” Castiel shot back with a face that looked like he just sucked on a lemon before he disappeared from the table.
“You need to sleep, Sam.” Dean told his brother thickly as he led him up to the old master bedroom. “We can…we’ll figure this all out tomorrow.” He explained as he helped move Sam to sit on the bed, but with a blank look on his face, it didn’t look like he would move unless he was forced to. “Sammy, you have to sleep. Do it for Jess, okay?” He whispered and touched his brother’s cheek for a moment before he leaned back up to his full height.
needed to get laid.
“You told me human blood can make this sigil that banishes you, didn’t you? And, buddy, witches like to spill their bodily fluids all over the place. Nasty, all of ‘em,” he made a disgusted face. “I’m pretty damn sure they’ll expect an angel, so you can bet your ass they’ll be ready with one of those sigils. Then, we’re all boned.” Castiel frowned at that and Sam had a bitch face in the works, but Dean beat them both to the punch before they could talk. “Like I said, if it gets too hairy, we can wipe down all those wards.”
“You're too lenient on them, Castiel.” Uriel shot back heatedly, but let it end there.
Then, so quietly that Dean had to strain to hear it, Castiel whispered, “
played, neither of them said a word to each other. The only sound in the garage, aside from the music, was the occasional tinkering of Dean messing with the Impala.
And now they had to deal with the angels.
“The stench of a demon is all over this church.” He explained and his nose scrunched up for a second before his expression fell flat. “I went to examine the corpse and I apologize if that was inappropriate. I wanted to make it one less trip for you and given your relationship with Jim Murphy, I—”
Castiel frowned at the explanation. "I don't understand. Yes, some officials are paid more than others, but there shouldn't be that much of a class difference." Concern was written across his face. "Humans should be equal with one another. That would help quicken peace between you. That was our mission."
As it would turn out, it was a hell of a lot harder than he expected to find someone to share a bed with him. No matter what the church believed, people still had sex. It was only when the sex broke the law that it became a real problem and even then, the angels weren’t too preoccupied with most of those cases. So, there were plenty of people that he could choose from, but it…never really happened.
Both Sam and Dean walked toward the middle of the altar where Castiel was trapped then turned around to face the new presence in the room. It was an older man with a thinning hair line, but Dean barely noticed that because all he could focus on were those cloudy yellow eyes that made him feel like they were boring holes into his skin. Faintly, in the back of his head, he could hear the drunken whispers of his father. “
." A mechanical voice reminded Lawrence as it came over the alarm clock which Dean reached over to slam his hand down on. Since Year 666, Dean heard the same damn speech every damn Sunday and didn't need to be reminded about it.
“I’ll be here in any way that you need me to be, Dean.” Castiel informed him.
That was how Dean found himself at the church, underneath one of the sinks in the kitchen that was used for those parties that the more devout members threw every now and then. Castiel awkwardly stood beside the sink while a few members of the church continually walked by the kitchen to sneak a peek at him. There were even a few brave souls who approached him and tried to make conversation. A lot of them were older women, so either they knew he was an angel and were awestruck or they wanted to ogle the fresh piece of man meat, and Dean was almost positive it was the latter.
Dean shook his head and instead tried to focus on the campfire ahead of him. He and Castiel had to spend some time in the woods because there was apparently some kind of monster that liked to munch on horny teens that snuck out into the forest after curfew. Dean felt sorry for people who went out that way. All they wanted to do was have a little time with their sweetheart because bible thumpers loved to shove celibacy down kids’ throats these days now that they had the angels on their sides and they ended up dead for it. It was a damn shame. That was for sure.
Sam was a lot more pliable than Dean expected, but he was pretty sure that was the shock that had started to set in. Well, he would use whatever he could to make his little brother move into the old house. Castiel had already went inside to start putting up the wards and Dean was more than a little worried because those were supposed to keep angels out. What would happen to an angel inside them? He would make sure to ask Castiel about it later.
Sam was out of the Impala before it even parked and Dean almost wanted to launch himself out of the door rather than take the time to do it himself. He could hear his little brother scream for Jessica as he scrambled into the front door and Dean had to breathe through his sudden panic. He could remember how his father had told him to hold onto Sam while he ran inside the house and little four-year-old Dean had been so terrified no one would come back out. Turned out, it had just been one parent to make it back out.
He scrutinized the angel. “You have a lot of faith in me. How can you be so sure I’m not in the resistance?” That wasn’t the best thing to say to someone that could decide your fate, but he just couldn’t understand how Castiel could believe in him so much, especially since they hadn’t known each other that long in the scheme of things.
Dean huffed and ran a hand through his hair. “We’ll take down Sabrina and her sisters and if we need help, we can take down the wards and Mister Feathers here can swoop in and save our bacon.” He smacked Castiel on the shoulder with a smirk and moved to open his door. But before he slid inside the car, he noticed that both Sam and Castiel stared after him. “What?”
"Answer's still the same," Dean huffed.
, Dean. I’m sure you’re aware that I could bury you with little effort.”
“There is quite a bit that the bible isn’t correct about.” He commented. “Father doesn’t care about who you love so much as you love, similar to how he doesn’t care about premarital sex. Take Dean, for example.” He looked over to Dean who tensed up at the mention of his name. “His soul won’t be sent to hell merely because he has had premarital sex on many occasions or because he is bisexual.”
“No one knows.” He breathed out. “Gabriel looked up to Lucifer much like the way I looked up to Gabriel himself. Other than Michael, he was hit hardest when Lucifer fell. One day, Gabriel went to Earth and he vanished. We searched every corner of the universe, but no one, not even Michael or Raphael, could find him. With how much time that’s passed, we assume he’s dead.”
Castiel watched the colours in the sky, colours he never thought he would see again, with rapt attention. Dean could not tear his eyes away from Castiel’s face, a face he thought he lost.
Sam was faster to respond, “I-- I guess it’s worth a try.”
“Piratin’ lost its appeal after I Awakened.” He shrugged. “Figured I’d try somethin’ new.”
“We talked at lunch,” Sam mumbled, sleep heavy in his voice. As Dean let himself in, Sam lay back down on the bed and closed his eyes.
A week passed and Castiel spent most of it asleep in Dean’s bed. Ash managed to break away from his duties long enough to treat Castiel. Ash told Dean he did a good job-- for an amateur-- but Ash also made a point of teaching him what to do over the next few days.
The wind still had a bite to it but the bright sunshine suggested spring was on its way. Every other year, the Realm greeted the season's change with cheer. This particular year, however, there was a current of apprehension.
"What?" Dean blinked but made no other move.
"I know you heard this one before," Dean continued, "but you've never heard it from me. This is it, my friends. We are going to end the Long War."
“Nice to meet you,” Dean smiled wryly.
Dean swallowed thickly and nodded. “I should be more honored, right? I mean…it’s a pretty huge deal for some little human like me to be friends with a friggin’ angel, y’know?” He rubbed the back of his neck and made a point to stare at the fire until his eyes hurt. “I…should probably say sorry since I was pretty pissy with you at the start of this whole deal. I just didn’t…” He tried to find the least offensive way to explain the fact that he wanted to stab any angel in the throat.
"He thought he was having a heart attack." Jessica corrected. "He was released a little later."
Not much more time passed before the brunet at the counter placed the phone back down and thanked the woman behind the counter. The only reason that woman let them have the phone was because Castiel had popped up in the middle of the damn store and she realized what he was—and what idiot would refuse people who had an angel backing them up? So, not only did the poor woman have to deal with that kind of pressure, but she also had to listen to Dean’s little sister chit chat with her betrothed. Some people had the worst luck in the world.
“I didn’t want you to leave,” Cas says, honestly, and the look Dean gives him is worth the spent grace.
“Cas?” Dean yells, from the base of the stairs. He glances down the dark hallway -- nothing -- and waits for a response, but the only sound is the quiet creak of the house settling.
Dean wants to see him like this always, falling apart at one simple touch, making him feel a fraction of what Dean feels for him.
The words feel more damning than they have any right to, an ending to this pit stop haven Dean’s dreamed for years. Over the next few days Dean will feel the phantom touch of Cas’ hands and lips on his skin and wish things were different. Maybe, if the world wasn’t ending they’d have more time than an hour in a ruined sanctuary hidden in the Nebraska farmland to love each other.
There’s only one explanation. Cas needs to get out.
“I could eat, yes. Burgers?”
He takes his time, wraps his fist around both of their cocks, and jerks them off together nice and slow. Edges Dean, thumbs over his slit, until he’s trembling beneath him and begging with incoherent murmurs of Cas’ name. When Dean comes, soon after him, Cas kisses him through the rolling aftershocks. It's then that Cas pulls back to really look at him, at the swooped bow of his lips, pink and swollen from Cas’ mouth, the flush spreading bright red up Dean’s neck to his cheeks and the tips of his delicate ears. Cas takes it in, savors every breath and sound he coaxes out of Dean’s mouth. He ingrains it to his memory for later, once he’s gone from this place.
They’re safe, Cas is safe.
, something he doesn’t currently have. With their connection, if Dean yearns for something, Cas feels the ache of it tangled with his grace. It’s not a bad sort of longing, but melancholy, a low thrum of desperation ringing in the heart of his soul. Cas would soothe the ache if he could, but he’s not sure how.
As opposed to last night, they face each other across the expanse of the mattress. Cas isn’t sure why and it’s incredibly intimate, makes his chest tighten in want from seeing Dean so close and knowing he can’t kiss him like he wants to.
He pauses, rolls the edge of the comforter between two fingers, and sighs. “After everything with The Empty and with Chuck, I thought you were dead. But you’re not and...I miss you.”
Mary squeezes his hand again and that gets Dean to look back up at her. Her own eyes are watery and there’s a sad sort of smile on her mouth. “I didn’t know, not for sure. I had my suspicions. It was clear that there was some kind of connection between the two of you I didn’t understand, but I could tell that Cas was special to you.”
A sign stating, “Entering Kansas,” comes into view in the distance and Dean flicks his blinker on, turning left at the next dirt road. He’s not ready to go home yet.
“Amazing,” Cas states. Amazing doesn’t cover the need to wrap Dean up further into his arms, and hide the both of them away from the rest of the world, away from Chuck, and just
. It feels different from any other dream he’s had in the past, and yet whenever Dean touches him there’s no semblance of a mirage as there is in dreams. Everything feels real.
“Can you sit up?” Dean asks. His fingers slide back from Cas’ neck and stroke through the longer hairs at the back of his neck.
“So,” Dean starts, munching on a piece of buttery cornbread. “Definitely ghost possession right?”
“A room if you have one, two queens preferably.” Cas gives her a courtesy smile, squints as he reads her name tag. “Thank you, Elaine.”
Dean smiles and reaches out, gingerly grabbing the FBI badge and flipping it the right way around. “Good. You read to go in?”
Dean wears the sunhat, like Cas wanted him to, and lets the drawstring loops hang loose and wanders around the garden shirtless. Purposefully being a tease while Cas tries to focus and gets his hands dirty digging in the soil and planting new shoots. He steals glances at Dean, relishing in the way his heart skips a beat when their hands touch during the transfer of seeds. Cas has his own sun hat on too, which matches Dean’s, but his hat has a ribbon patterned with little honeybees wrapped around the base of the crown.
After the awkwardness before breakfast, they continue east. It’s overcast today, the clouds grey and puffy, low in the sky, drifting along in the wind like bland hot air balloons. Dean’s chipper despite earlier, and for once lets Cas pick the music, breaking his own rule.
“Like here with me? In the house?” Dean clarifies. His cheeks heat up in a warm blush, trickling up to the tips of his ears, but he trudges on, sentences strung together in a desperate ramble. “There’s an extra room down the hall from mine and I know that maybe you want to go back to the other angels, Heaven was your home first, but if you wanted you could... stay. If you want, you don’t have to but, it’d be real nice to have you here.” He releases a heavy breath and doesn’t dare look Cas in the eyes for fear of what he might find hidden in them.
“You too, Dean.”
That gets his attention. Cas turns to look at him, eyes watery like he’s coming out of a daze. “Oh. I’m sorry. I must have been caught up in my thoughts.”
that’s come over them both.
Dean moves, sliding down so his cheek rests on Cas’ chest, arms sliding around his back so he’s completely enveloped in Cas’ arms. “Never.”
They leave early, right at sunrise. As they drive east, the land opens up around them, nothing but miles upon miles of wheat fields turned into spun gold in the newly risen sun. Dean rolls down the windows to let the fresh air in and turns the music up louder, singing along at the top of his lungs. He looks over at Cas, finds him fighting back a laugh, lips twitching. His hair is a windblown mess atop his head, only adding to how attractive he looks. Even with that dorky tie of his flying around in the breeze and flapping against his chest.
Cas chuckles, and bumps his forehead against Dean’s. “There never is.”
“Could we... take this with us? We’ll bring it back, probably. I just think it’s probably safest if you’re not here with it alone.” Dean explains.
He tips Addie extra well, an extra five, since the things with Cas won’t pan out for her. He gets it. Cas is everything, more than everything, and unattainable. At least she had the guts to try.
“Hey, it’s okay. If you want to stitch it up yourself when we get back to the room, you can. Be good practice, right?” Dean offers.
Dean shrugs, biting off a big piece of pancake and chewing while he talks. “I dunno, thought I'd tune up Baby a bit. Her engine sounded a little funky on my way to work yesterday, so I should probably check it out.”
“Let me,” Cas says. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder once, and doesn’t miss the relieved smile Dean gives him.
But Cas
“I came home from work and she was getting ready, putting makeup on in the bathroom, so I went to check on her. She seemed a little more off than normal but it was a big anniversary so I figured just nerves, ya know? And then I blacked out.”
After, Dean gets Miracle her actual food and sets it next to the fridge along with her water bowl. She crunches loudly on her food while he washes the dishes. It’s therapeutic in a way, always has been, the methodical process of cleaning and drying, then putting each dish back in its rightful spot. Once he’s finished and Miracle is satisfied enough to take a nap, Dean gets to work putting the finishing touches on his little home.
“Okay?”
Idly, he wonders if Cas dreamed about this too, if these are the sort of things Cas meant by, “
“We’re in 114, but we’re going to have to share again,” Cas states. He peers into the bag, noting a foil-wrapped cheeseburger and small cup of waffle fries.
Their house doesn’t boast much of anything out of the ordinary, filled with regular home items outside of the pictures hanging on the walls. Cas notes that there are a few from their hunting days he never realized Dean had taken. Eventually, he finds himself in the garage.
His gaze travels to the next picture, one of him and Dean. Their hands are enclasped, bodies angled towards each other, and foreheads touching. Both of them are wearing tuxes, though Cas’ tie is the old blue he’s had since the beginning, pressed neatly against his chest. The same band currently sitting heavy on Cas’ finger glints in the light of the picture. Dean’s grinning and Cas finds a matching smile on his own face. In the background, there are silhouettes of family and friends and twinkle lights hanging high above their heads.
The staircase curves upward another floor, but Dean checks all of the rooms first with military efficiency. At the end of the main hallway, one of the doors is partially open, the smell of something rotting from inside. Covering his nose with his shirt, Dean kicks the door fully open and peers inside. A body of a middle-aged man is strung up from the ceiling, hands tied and head drooping from his shoulders -- he can’t have been dead more than a few days, his body barely starting to decay, despite the stench. From the looks of it, that’s Johnathan Redder, the missing man the whole town of Cascadia had been searching for for the past week.
“Tell me if you want me to stop I just--I want--”
Focusing on his grace, the parts of it still tied to Dean despite the distance between them, Castiel sends out a message. He hopes that it’s strong enough that Dean will hear him.
From downstairs he hears a loud slam, and the whole house shudders with the aftershocks.
Dean nods. He does
less romantic lyrically and, as Dean said, when he gave Cas the mixtape, “A song to drive or fuck to.” Next to him, Dean dances in the seat, bobbing his head and belting out the lyrics. So it will be driving, not… the other option.
“Can I tell you something?” Dean whispers, lips brushing the shell of Cas’ ear.
Cas can work with that. He lowers himself down onto the bed, moving onto his side to face Dean, and reaches out. Their fingers catch and Dean tangles them with his own, pulling Cas close until their bodies are flush together, legs intertwined, and cocks bumping together.
He looks at Cas and wants to touch him in ways he’d never dared before. To disrobe him underneath the sun in this sanctuary, feel the warmth of Cas’ grace pulse under his lips. Dean wonders if Cas tastes like stardust.
It will be an adjustment, having Sam not living in the same house with him, but he’ll get used to it over time. It will be good for them to have their own spaces, yet still remain physically close. He’s not sure he would be able to cope with an eternity where Sam was too far away for Dean to see him frequently.
?” Dean asks, waggling his eyebrows.
“Do you wanna talk about it?” Dean asks, a few miles outside of Burns, Oregon when he can’t shake the uneasy feeling of Cas’ silence.
Dean laughs, and it comes out in a choked sob, one he’d been trying to conceal. “I won’t. And, yeah, forever sounds good.”
“It’s not a fetish,” Dean says, pointing an accusatory finger at Cas.
It doesn’t matter, not anymore. Dean will hold Cas’ words in the deepest part of his heart forever even if he learns that Cas no longer feels as he once did. He changed Cas, and Cas changed him. If anything, he owes it to his best friend to become the kind of man Cas loved. Thankfully, he has all of eternity to fully and freely become himself, to learn to love who he is.
The words catch on the tip of his tongue, sink back and knot in his throat. He steals a glance at Cas, hoping maybe they’ll just pour out of him. Cas looks back expectantly, all openness and curiosity, probably from the strange look on Dean’s face. Dean swallows thick and the words go with, falling into a pit at the base of his stomach. He offers Cas a weak smile and looks back at the road.
“Okay,” Cas says, bewildered. He finds he’s frozen in place, watching as Dean lifts his duffel over his shoulder and grabs the bag of food with his other hand, heading towards their room.
“Cas?” Dean says weakly, going slack in Cas’ arms.
Dean doesn’t answer and Cas doesn’t expect him to. Instead, he shifts closer and taps Cas’ shoulder. “Put your arm around my neck and I’ll lift you up.”
Tears prick at Cas’ eyes and he darts his gaze up to the night sky twinkling high above them. He notices, for the first time since he was dropped into this alternate world, that all the constellations are flipped from their normal orientation in the sky, upside down, identical to how Cas feels at this very moment.
“Cas! Hey, buddy, hey it’s okay. You’re alright.” Dean’s palm is warm on his neck and cheeks, fingers rubbing circles into his jaw.
Their fists meet and then forearms. Verna deals a heavy kick to Cas’ stomach, making him double over and stumble back towards the door.
“Hmm, eggs, bacon, and toast sound alright?” Dean kisses him again.
Memories flick through Dean's mind of Cas’ tear-stained cheeks, black goo engulfing Cas’ body and taking him to another universe right after he said — after he —
Cupping a bit of air in his palm, Cas makes a bowl with his hands, tightening his grip around the invisible particles and then shoves them up into the air in a whirling motion. All at once a rush of air blows through his hair, mussing it and making it stand up on his head. Above him the branches rustle, leaves trembling in the wind. Distantly, from somewhere behind him, he hears Dean gasp.
Silence lingers between them, companionable, as if Dean hadn’t nearly just shattered his carefully built status quo with one sentence.
Taking a deep breath in through his nose, Cas releases it to calm himself down and decides to try and move. He moves his fingers first, unclasping them from around Dean’s middle, and slides his arms back towards himself. Dean shifts suddenly, snore shorting into a snort, and burrows deeper into the pillow. His hands grapple blindly in sleep but reach up and cling tight to Cas’ forearms, pulling them back tighter around his waist.
Something’s missing for Dean, that Cas knows. Something that makes his supposed eternal happiness a little less than perfection. Cas intended this place to be everything Dean could have ever wanted, so he makes it his mission to figure out what
There was an angel trap, Eve was after Cas. Leviathans. Fighting. Someone knocked Dean out.
“I heard your prayer,” Cas continues, a ghost of a smile on his lips.
Cas hums agreement, and pushes open the door, stepping out and heading towards the stairs. Close behind, Dean follows. Underneath his boots, the stairs creak, shifting precariously underneath him. Cas pauses at the landing and reaches up towards a small sign hanging crooked off the front door.
Once he’s on his feet and standing, Dean’s arm securely around his upper back and shoulder, Cas feels a little woozy and exhausted, but otherwise normal. He takes a few deep breaths to steady himself and then looks over at Dean, who is watching him intently.
Cas kisses him this time because this isn’t real and he can. He’s overeager, but Dean lets Cas lick into his mouth, deepening the kiss until they’re full-on making out. Dean drags Cas inexplicably closer, slipping his leg between Cas’ until they’re flush together. Cas’ hands slide up into Dean’s hair while they kiss, tangling it with his fingers. In this world, Dean’s hair is longer, curling around the back of his neck, not as long as Sam’s usually is, but enough to hold onto and Cas takes advantage of this.
“I’m alright,” Cas states. He yawns wide, then pushes open the door. “I still need to tend to your wound.”
It’s overwhelming, having Dean naked in his arms and
“Dean,” Cas says. Like a prayer, like Dean is something holy, the beginning and end of all things contained in one breath of his name.
“Miracle seems to have settled in well,” Cas says, nodding towards Miracle, as she runs at them, tongue hanging out of her mouth.
Cas explains what happened and Dean listens, takes it in, and just
“I love you.”
It’s deserted out here in the middle of the forest. Hopefully, by the time anyone finds this house, the wind will have knocked it over, hiding the remains of the bodies inside until centuries later. If the world lasts that long.
Cas takes a big slurp and sighs in satisfaction.
Cas knew, even back then when Chuck’s hold on them was stronger than ever, his eyes constantly watching their every move. Cas
“Okay, I’ll let Jody know to be ready for backup just in case.”
He noticed it the first night. For dinner drinks Dean brought home Texas Star, the beer he’d only buy at bars if there was absolutely nothing else, instead of his chosen favorite El Sol. When Dean cooks he sings Rush under his breath, not Zeppelin. A travesty, in Cas’ mind. Or how at night, in bed, Dean sleeps on his back, not his stomach when he isn’t curled around Cas. And he doesn’t snore, which, while a welcome relief, isn’t accurate in the slightest.
to see him.
Unable to kiss him like he wants, Cas reaches out, hand hidden underneath the comforter, and brushes his fingertips butterfly soft over Dean’s forearm.
In the morning, Cas wakes early, with the rising of the sun. The ache in his head from the remnants of the Djinn poison has subsided, leaving only an itch near his temples. He’s warm, curled up in the blankets, and something hot and firm is trapped in his arms. It takes a few seconds to register where he is.
now. And most of the time, Cas is looking right back.
Paul reacts as if stung, shock and confusion contorting his facial features. “Yeah, I guess. Why? It’s just a mirror.”
It’s selfish of him to stay longer than he should, but if he’s going to die and not get this sort of life with Dean, having it for a brief time will have to be good enough.
Now, Dean stands on the deck of their little seaside cabin, whitewashed and situated up on the hill from the ocean. He’s not sure how long they’ve been there, spending time just the two of them, secluded away from the rest of the universe, and frankly Dean doesn’t care. This is Heaven, if Cas wants to steal him away for a whole year and make love to him on the beach like in
“C’mon, let’s go home.”
After a quick shower together and finishing off their discarded breakfast, Cas follows Dean into the garage to help him work on Baby for a bit. It’s still early, the heat tolerable for now, and Dean opens the garage door to let in sunlight.
Reaching over his shoulder, Cas slides his fingers through his wings, ghosting over the feathers until he finds one that’s starting to come loose. He grasps the feather and tugs it free with a pained grunt.
Cas turns his head. They’re close enough that his nose nuzzles against Dean’s cheek, breath ghosting over the curve of Dean’s bottom lip.
They wash their plates side by side -- Dean washing, Cas drying -- similar to how Cas remembers doing so at the bunker. While he’s finishing up with the last dish, Dean’s arms snake around his waist, and his chin notches into the space between his shoulder and neck.
“Dean!” He heard his brother scream and also heard his footsteps thunder toward Dean’s position, but then there was a loud crash. Dean could barely look over his shoulder, but he saw that the same invisible force that hand a hand in his chest had also pinned Sam to the wall.
" to make the world as their Father wanted it to be is Year Six. Under the radar, most people just called it Year 666 because by firm hand, the angels meant that they wanted to take over the world and put themselves at the top of the food chain. What was that old saying? Never trust a pretty face because the devil used to be an angel before he fell?
Dean doubted it, though.
“I can’t guarantee I’ll provide an answer, but yes, you may.”
Castiel nodded. "I searched the entire town before you arrived. I wanted to tell you once you were rested, but since you've asked, I believe a witch, or perhaps a coven, is at work here. I can sense the—" his nose scrunched up in distaste, "I can sense the darkness and a particular home is warded. I cannot enter."
Dean decided to let the conversation drop, mostly because Sam and Jessica had decided to come back downstairs. Once it was established that both brothers had the approval of Jessica to attend church, they shuffled out of the house and crowded into the Impala. It was bothersome when Castiel decided to ride with them to church, but it made sense. Dean had never seen them personally, but he heard stories special sigils that could keep angels out of places. Their new feathered roommate probably didn’t want to risk the chance of losing them on the radar.
because, whether Castiel knew about it or not, he was a total cock block and that wasn’t fair. He knew it’d be over once Castiel left which then spiraled into Dean thinking about the fact that he really didn’t want the angel to leave him.
“Both Sam and Jessica assured me that they accept you no matter what your sexual preference may be and I didn’t sense any deceit from either of them.” In true Castiel fashion, he cocked his head to the side and squinted. “Sam also seemed very proud of the fact that you choose to sleep with both sexes rather than try to hide your attraction to men despite the stigma that society’s placed on it. You’re very brave for that. I know that humans can be very…” He trailed off and tried to find a polite way to say what he wanted to.
Dean bit down on his lower lip to hold back the bark of laughter and instead chuckled lowly. “Hey, at least you’re better than your pals, yeah?” He noticed how Castiel certainly sobered up and looked past Dean, not really focusing on anything. “Do those pals of yours need you?” he asked.
The two stared one another down, waited for one to bend to the other, and it was him to break because he knew Jessica would do it. As soon as his shoulders slumped and he sent her a bitch face Sam would be proud of, she beamed and vanished from sight. Dean kicked at the bannister before he turned around on his heel and walked over to the couch.
ourselves?”
, his mind supplied—there wasn't that much issue to trust them. The old enemy of my enemy is my friend chestnut, he assumed, even if to have information about angelic weaknesses or weapons to capture or kill angels, resistance leaders had to sell their souls.
"Dean and Sam Winchester," the snake drawled and craned his head around to look at Jessica who was pressed back to the counter, hands clenched around the edge. "Relax, kitten. We're not here for you." Dean had to hold his much taller brother back. "It’s nice to meet you, boys. You met Castiel earlier, but you didn't have the pleasure of my company." Apparently, some angels had a sense of humor...even if it was narcissistic and shitty. "I'm Zachariah and I'm Castiel's superior."
After Dean had rubbed one out in the shower, he actually
Jessica tiptoed around the back of them so that she could dart to her fiancé's side and wrap her smaller hand in his. "It's nice to meet you." She greeted on behalf of all humans in the room and even forced a smile. "What can we do for you?"
“Friends,” he breathed the word out as if he didn’t repeat it then it would vanish from between them. “I’m very honored that you would consider me a friend, Dean.”
This was a pretty sensitive topic for him, Dean could tell. “I’m sorry, Cas.” He took a deep breath and smiled bitterly. “If it makes you feel better, you’re not the only one that got the short end of the stick. When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a mechanic. That was what my dad was before we were assigned to be hunters, but it’s not because of him that I wanted to be one.” He scrounged his head for an explanation. “Cars were cool and they’ve always made sense to me in a way that nothing else can. I can take them apart, put them back together, fix them up, make them look nice, and that’s all there is to it.”
the bastard’s throat whenever they found
The angel’s frown deepened and he looked away from Dean. “It’s been some time since I’ve been able to sit and observe the Earth. I understand that my human etiquette is…severely lacking.” And he actually looked like he was about to cry because he had such a hard time fitting in with humans.
The Impala pulled up across the street from a modest house and, from all appearances, it didn't look like the evil lair of a coven of witches. But that was the problem with witches; they were human. Stupid, screwed up in the head humans, but humans nonetheless. Dean breathed out through his nose and angled his body to face his little brother.
about sex. That’s a new low for you, Dean.”
“I hate you so much.” Jessica whined and covered her face with her hands. “I really hope you didn’t talk to an
The response Dean received was extremely exasperated. “I’m not naïve. I know that they’re copulating.” And Dean, who hadn’t expected that at all, tried to tighten a pipe with a little too much force and sent his hand back into his face. Castiel must’ve heard the noise, but he either didn’t care or figured that Dean would be okay. “I just didn’t think it would take so long for them to finish. The women here are very kind, yes, but I don’t have, what you call,
