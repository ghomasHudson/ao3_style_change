“Cambridge dictionary defines a hallucination as an experience in which you see, hear, feel, or smell something that does not exist,” Sherlock quotes. “It doesn’t specify the hallucinator’s knowledge of the hallucination as a determining factor.”
Sherlock wishes there was some way to refute John’s logic, but there isn’t, really, given that right now all that’s holding him up, or more precisely dragging him up the stairs one at the time, is in fact John Watson’s tiny frame.
“It was his choice, not mine,” Sherlock points out, relieved that his voice sounds neutral, matter-of-fact.
Mrs Turner shrugs and turns to the camera. “I think she should be glad I didn’t bring up the jam first or cream first debate.”
“You used the past tense. Obvious,” Sherlock says in his people-are-all-so-stupid voice, and John gently elbows him in the side. Sherlock looks over at him, irritated, and John tries to silently convey his point that people are more likely to share information if you don’t actively try to irritate them. Sherlock rolls his eyes a little and turns back to the two women. “Forgive me, Ya’ra  I was being rude. But back to my question, when did you discover the book had been stolen?”
The second time, when Sherlock shot at Moriarty’s bomb, John pushed Sherlock into the pool, then dragged him out, got his heart to beating again, got the bleeding to stop, hauled him out of a burning building, made sure he went to the hospital for treatment, and slipped painkillers and antibiotics into his tea (which Sherlock drank without protest, even though John was sure he knew exactly what was in it).
“I was looking forward to this,” Moran says, rubbing his hands. “I’m very curious whether you can live up to your reputation, Mr Holmes.”
John waves to the other boys and sits down opposite Sherlock, helping himself to a large portion of porridge.
“I don’t care,” John says, and there’s blood-red, vicious anger in his voice, the likes of which Sherlock has only ever heard once before, when Mary died and John turned on him. “She
“I didn’t sneak out, I left,” Sherlock says, and he doesn’t know why he’s arguing semantics with John, here, because he very much did sneak out.
Sherlock smiles at him, can’t help himself, and he’s sure it’s somewhere between deeply fond and unbearably besotted, because that’s how he feels. “That was pure luck, but fine. You win.” He takes an unconscious step closer to John. “We didn’t set a prize. So what do you want?”
Actors mill about in the green room and the dressing rooms, some pacing, limbering up, others doing vocal exercises, others reading the paper. Molly is in the kitchen eating a sandwich with the nonchalant boredom stage crews often develop during a long run.
The two fairies exchange a glance, then the one armed with the crossbow finally lowers the weapon. “You're children,” she says.
Sherlock nearly kisses John right then and there, nearly throws him against the wall and mauls him, because he’s missed him so goddamned much. He doesn’t. But he makes a decision, right then and there, that he will. Soon. Life is just too short to be a coward much longer.
“You know, for the longest time, I wasn’t sure that you actually like him,” Lestrade finally says, slowly, carefully.
“Are you tempted? To see whether we can strike a bargain with a killer to get us home?” John asks, and it comes out more challenging that he meant to. But he has to know.
Sherlock turns and starts walking towards his car. He's tired and frankly not in the mood to talk to anyone. John hasn't seen him. He can just walk away. He can just get into his car and drive back to London and ignore John Watson, who's sitting there like a forgotten child who didn't get picked up from school.
The room is dark and quiet, but the kitchen light over the sink is on, and he can just make out Sherlock’s silhouette bent over the microscope in the kitchen.
In the end, he says the thing that’s closest to the truth without being completely incomprehensible. “I needed to get out of my head. It’s a nasty place to be sometimes.”
The crew mill between them and get a few reaction quotes, and then they’re all asked to assemble before the judges to hear who’s won and who’s out.
And John just waits him out, lets him arrive at what he still needs to say in his own time, patiently leaning against the doorframe.
There are too many emotions choking Sherlock’s throat to name. His own grief for Mary is so complicated that it would take days to unravel. There’s guilt there, and pure, ice-cold hatred, and love, too, because she was Rosie’s mum, wasn’t she, and there’s a sort of kinship he felt with her. But he also knows that the extremely tentative equilibrium they’d reached after she shot him would never have lasted, that something had to give or something would break. Well, something gave, and something broke anyway. The one thing they had both agreed should not break. John. So in a way, he feels like he and Mary both failed John, deeply and profoundly.
“If you were bored, all you needed to do was tell me. I had plenty of offers. I could have gotten you several television auditions, people who are very interested in you. I didn’t mention them because I was under the impression that you needed some time to re-acclimate yourself to life in London, and you needed some quiet time after last year.”
“Where I’m sure she was eaten as well, but at least she had a fighting chance,” John says, and the actors all chuckle.
But, he thinks as he slips on his mud-encrusted shoes, it’s a risk they’re just going to have to take.
Sherlock is suddenly seized by nerves, because he isn’t sure whether he crossed a line here. But John smiles at Sherlock, hesitant and subdued, and just says, “Thank you for the cake.”
“We won’t get a puff pastry challenge until the final,” Sherlock points out, tearing his gaze away from the crumbs on John’s lips. “It needs to rest for too long.”
“Probably his parents can’t stand him either,” another boy throws in and there’s a bit of nasty snickering in the crowd.
Sherlock shrugs. “Either that, or time passes more quickly here than on Earth. Both are equally possible or impossible.”
Now he’s thinking of what he wants. Fucking John right here on the counter seems an excellent option. They’re already perfectly aligned like this. The only problem is a logistical one, because he has neither lube or condoms. So taking John upstairs and bending him over Sherlock’s kitchen table seems more doable, and he’s certain that John will be amenable.
stop. Now. “I want to tell you what you want to hear. But you’re right, you deserve the truth. You deserved it from Mary, and you deserve it from me. And the truth is, I will always choose your life over mine, and if I may remind you, it was you who grabbed Moriarty and told me to run, so you need to ask yourself where I get it from.”
Life goes on. John discovers a new takeout Indian restaurant just around the corner from their flat. They solve several dull cases – insurance fraud, adultery and an ingenious bank robbery –and one brilliant one – ciphers, hangmen and dead bodies. John orders satellite television. Sherlock gets a new spring coat.
John wonders how exactly Mrs Hudson can tell, but since he agrees, he doesn’t argue. “We’re glad we’ve got you, too,” John says, meaning every word. Mrs Hudson’s unquestioning kindness to them makes this strange place almost into a home.
John smiles at him and pecks another kiss on his cheek. “Wake me at eleven? And save me some strudel.”
They meet the museum's one and only employee, an elderly Fey'a man, on the top floor. Sherlock and John introduce themselves as friends of Kitty's.
It alarms him now. It alarms him that he knows John’s work schedule. It alarms him that he recognises John’s handwriting from his gran’s recipe book. John’s walk, his smell, his humming while he bakes, the way he favours his left leg, the way he clenches and unclenches his hand to hide the tremors, it’s all deeply familiar now.
he thinks,but as they lie pressed together in the dark, and John falls asleep on him, warm breath, warm body, warm skin every inch of John held closely against his body, he sees the future unspool in front of his eyes like a yarn that got away from him.
And he realises this is something he’s known all along. “I’m irrational about you too,” John says, and he doesn’t mind that his voice isn’t entirely steady. “So. What are we going to do about our shared irrationality?”
Except tonight. Because the moment he picked up the saline solution, the moment he put bow to strings, his mind started going through all the steps he has taken to lead him inexorably to where he is now, somehow watching John Watson break apart under a weight he doesn’t even know about, and not being able to do a thing to stop it.
There are twenty ways he could make these scones more interesting. Cranberries, lemon zest, cinnamon, chocolate, poppy seeds, the permutations are endless.
“Don’t be ridiculous!” Sherlock shouts, far too loudly for the smallness of the car. “I’m finishing this alone. I’m not getting you killed. I never should have allowed you to come along. This ends now. You’re going back to London and you-”
John sighs and drinks his grain coffee in silence, watching Sherlock as he walks out. He’s a head taller than John by now, and John considers it unfair that somebody who eats rarely and sleeps even less, who takes no care of himself, should grow like a weed, and John, who eats and sleeps and plays football and rugby, should stay resolutely short. He listens to Sherlock and Molly bicker in the next room - apparently there’s no fresh corpse - while he enjoys the last moments of quiet he’ll likely get today.
They dress warmly and take blankets, it’s summer but the nights are chilly in the forest. They take enough food and water to last them for a few days, a petroleum lamp and a few of the beeswax candles Mrs. Hudson uses for the schoolroom. John feels bad for stealing and vows to replace them as soon as he can, but Sherlock, as usual, shrugs it off as a necessity, and in his view, fretting over necessities is a waste of time. John admits he’s got a point, but stealing from old ladies who feed, clothe and shelter you will never be on John’s list of acceptable behaviour in general.
“Oh my god, the mouse!” Molly turns to the others. “We had this director who wanted an actual white mouse for the photoshoot for the promotional material, and so I phoned our local pet store and asked them whether they had any white mice. Yes, ok, so can I rent one? And the clerk just hung up on me.”
John nods, giving her a self-deprecating smile. “I suppose she thought I’d have fun here. I’ve always loved baking, even when we were little.”
Sherlock nods reluctantly. “I suppose you’re right.” He sighs. “Now I have to go to Yemen and fetch him. You really are quite tiresome, Mycroft, you might have arranged for him to be home, you knew I was coming after all.”
He starts walking towards the house. Maybe he can get a breakfast scone before filming, maybe another cup of tea, maybe even coffee, if it’s decent, which it very probably won’t be.
It’s very obvious that John wants him to stay and this is the closest he can get to saying it. Sherlock nods, trying to hide his desperate relief. “Thank you.”
“Boys, are you decent?” Mrs Hudson asks from the other side of the door, and John bites down on a laugh, pretty sure it’d come out just a tad hysterical.
“It’s biscuit week in the tent, and the technical challenge for this week: American style chocolate chip cookies. The judges want twelve indentical beautiful chocolate chip cookies, but this time, the contestants are allowed to add a bit of a personal touch, like nuts.”
Sherlock still looks confused, but then his face does something complicated when he sees Mary’s engagement ring and the wedding binder and he connects the two to the question. For a split second, an emotion John can’t name flitters over his face, then the shutters come down and he says, “Silk. Of course. Unless you’re getting married in a barn.”
“Wow. Didn’t think he even remembered, sometimes, the way he talks on telly.” She sighs, looking at her cigarette, watching the embers eat at it. “‘course it was easier for him. He liked it. I didn’t. But I was expected to help, because I was the girl. He wanted to, and gran doted on him so much because of it. Little Johnny, so helpful, so clever, such a good boy.” There’s bitterness in her voice, but affection, too.
about his disappearance, tell me now, and I will personally see to it that your sentence will be very lenient indeed.”
So Sherlock doesn’t sugarcoat his next answer, either. “Nothing. I hated being a child, and no episode of my life has yet lent itself to over-romanticised remembrance.”
When Billy’s done eating, he leans back in his chair. “Now, what’s this all about then? This one,” he gestures at Sherlock, “said you blokes need some information?”
“You’re not going to shoot us,” Sherlock says, still in  Feyara. “If you wanted to kill us, we’d already be dead. So, where are we going?”
To my darling wife, who listened to me ramble, complain, gush and be insecure about this story for the better part of a year.
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea and takes a deep breath. Then he decides to speak honestly and directly to his brother for maybe the first time since the onset of his adolescence. “Mycroft, I think it’s past time that I acknowledge that I put you through hell. And I am sorry. I’m sorry for the lies, for stealing money from you, for making you watch me nearly kill myself. But you need to see me for who I am now, not the junkie I was. I’ve been clean for six years, Mycroft. And I put in the work. I pulled myself together, built a business, made a life for myself.” He looks at Mycroft, meets his eyes, wills his brother for once in his life to actually
Sherlock, Molly and John are sitting around a table in the cateríng tent, each of them silently sipping tea. Molly is tapping her foot. John looks cool as a cucumber, but he’s rubbing his hand over his thigh repeatedly, and Sherlock recognises it as the tell it is. He’s trying not to fidget himself, but he’s not entirely successful.
He makes another sound, enjoying the way his voice vibrates through his chest and throat. It’s a wonderful sensation, a little bit like scraping over his insides with rough velvet.
He shrugs, because not really, but he doesn’t want to explain. He only has himself to blame, after all. “Let’s go.”
Sherlock thinks he needs to wipe that grin off John’s face and sinks to his knees, mouthing John’s cock through the thin cotton. John makes a delicious sound, half moan, half bitten-off curse, and Sherlock decides that he wants to hear it again. So he mouths along John’s length, teasing at his hardness through the fabric, and it’s strangely erotic, the way he’s not-quite-tasting John. He blows hot air on John’s erection and scrapes over it with just a hint of teeth, and John’s head hits the door with an audible thump.
The light is on, and Mike is sprawled on the floor, passed out drunk, in a stable lateral position, obviously positioned in a way that he won’t choke on his own vomit. The door to the courtyard is open, and John is sitting on the bottom of the two steps leading outside. His entire posture screams exhaustion, both physical and emotional.
“Now will you admit that drinking Anderson under the table was a bad idea?” John asks, voice muffled against Sherlock’s coat.
“My point, young man,” she says, mock-glaring at him over her reading glasses,” is that I know something about Sachertorte. In Austria, the jam in the middle variant is more popular, and I have to say that I agree. The jam in the middle makes a rather dull chocolate cake spark. So my vote goes to John.”
They’re quiet for a while, but it’s the kind of silence that leads up to something, and Sherlock knows John well enough that he can almost hear the wheels turning in John’s head.
“Fine,” Lya grates out between her teeth, still speaking Feyara. Then she switches into English, for which John is eternally grateful. “The Gate is open. We’ve seen it. It’s….” she shudders. “It’s an abomination. They didn’t just reopen the Gate, they ripped it open.” She glares at Sherlock and John. “This is so typical of you humans. Always trying to control nature, never following its rules.”
He can still taste the bitter adrenaline in his mouth. It’s been two hours, and there’s still a slight tremor running along his skin, down his back, into his hands, conducting into the ground by the jiggling of his leg he can’t seem to stop. His hands are freezing. Maybe the tea is a good idea after all.
John follows him, watching him stack his boxes in his boot for several moments. “You know, snogging me into the wall and giving me an impressive cold shoulder not 24 hours later is the sort of thing that might confuse a chap somewhat.”
“Nobody let us through, we just passed through on our own!” John yells back, terrified and angry. “You think we chose this? You think we want to be here, all alone, away from our families? All we want is to find a way back! And now our best chance is destroyed! Believe me, if I had any idea what's happening, I'd tell you.”
John Watson is sitting outside of the tent, duffle bag at his feet, smiling as he sees Sherlock. "Good morning," he greets Sherlock cheerfully.
Objectively speaking, John is nothing special. No one characteristic sets him apart. He’s neither especially good-looking nor brilliant nor talented. He is, in fact, a washed-out army doctor with a bad shoulder and a psychosomatic limp. John provides nothing that Sherlock can’t get somewhere else. The fact that he doesn’t want to get it anywhere else right now is irrelevant, it’s more about convenience than anything else. Why would he go anywhere else to scratch an obvious itch if John is right there, willing and extremely competent?
What scares Sherlock is that he’s starting to get used to it. That he’s starting to need it. That he’s starting to rely on it, and that’s just never a good idea.
“It seemed appropriate, seeing as this is the third time I’ve kissed you,” Sherlock says, but John interrupts him.
Greg sighs and runs a hand over his face, his exhaustion showing in his eyes. “I was there six years ago, remember?” he says gently.
John isn’t amused and delighted, he’s gutted and so very, very angry, and as the night progresses, and they get thrown out of increasingly shabby restaurants, he’s no less gutted and no less angry.
Sherlock takes a deep drag from his cigarette. It’s the first one today and he’s proud of himself for making it through two proofing periods and the tedious, boring judging without nicotine.
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand,” John says, and there’s something in his voice, something bitter and hurting and sad. “I love it here. I love this theatre.”
John gets up and throws another blanket over Sherlock. “You’ll get pneumonia,” he says, not expecting to get an answer.
“That is why we have two Star Bakers this week,” Sally says, giving Moran a look that does nothing to hide her annoyance with him. “Sherlock Holmes and Jim Moriarty.”
Sherlock scrolls down. “Oh, this is even better. purtybitches would like you to know that they’re ‘up to anything, will travel. Bring whipped cream.’ You were right, your comments are worse than mine.”
“They’re really good,” John agrees. He crouches back down before him, looking at Sherlock with concerned affection. “It’s alright to be scared, Sherlock.”
Sherlock is bored, bored, bored. Victoria sponges are so ridiculously easy that he has to restrain himself not to add to the cake mixture. They won’t be allowed much wiggle room, the judges have asked for a classic Victoria sponge, and there isn’t much he can do to make that recipe more exciting. He uses his vanilla-infused sugar for the sponge and uses lime zest as well as lemon, and he adds a bit of the lime zest to the whipped cream filling. He uses his own raspberry-strawberry jam, but none of that makes baking two simple sponges and then popping them together with whipped cream in any way a challenge.
Lestrade sighs and rubs a hand over his face, obviously tired after a long day. “Fine, I won’t say anything more. Just…” he turns around and looks at Sherlock directly. “Life is short. People who truly make it better are very rare.”
looks that always make John feel incredibly special. It’s not an easy thing, capturing Sherlock Holmes’ full attention.
John feels his heart contract as he admits to himself how much he wants that, and how sick he is of going home to an empty flat that’s nothing but six years of accumulated silence and a few fleeting affairs with both men and women who were mainly remarkable in how little they were anything like Sherlock.
Mrs Hudson cuts in. “Jim quit.” She looks over at Greg. “John’s right, we don’t have time to waste. One of our lead actors just walked out of the production, we have twelve days to press night. I’m open to suggestions.”
The entire two floors are dedicated to the waves of people who came to Temera. From stone-age spearheads to bronze coins, Roman helmets, an  oil painting of the remains of a slave ship that sunk off the coast. A Bible from 1555, a half-crown from Cromwell's days. Letters and photographs from 1918.
When he sees Sherlock, John smiles at him brightly, annoyance apparently forgotten. “Hey,” he greets Sherlock, then looks around his workstation. “No tea?”
Irene sighs. “Yes, I asked.” She takes a deep drag of her cigarette and lets the smoke out very slowly, watching the smoke clouds drift into the sky. “So I’m guessing there won’t be a repeat performance?”
“You soaked your dates in tea,” Sherlock says. He’s having a hard time getting the words out over the lump in his throat.
There’s a sharp, piercing sound of sirens giving the all-clear, and slowly, everybody rises to their feet. John’s very aware that Sherlock’s still gripping his shoulders, and he too seems to suddenly notice it, because he lets John go and gets up, seeming a little embarrassed.
Sherlock looks at John and nods. “I did. And I’m not sure I could do it again. So best not to tempt fate.” His tone is gentle, but firm.
He doesn’t necessarily like that thought about himself much, but being Sherlock Holmes’ only friend is just about the one thing that makes him extraordinary these days.
Holmes visibly starts and turns around, but his momentary nervousness is replaced by annoyance when he realises John isn’t an authority figure. He sighs and rolls his eyes. “What does it look like I’m doing?” he snaps. His voice is just starting to change, wobbling all over the place, but his diction is sharp and precise and very obviously public school trained.
Sherlock holds out his hand for the book, and John flips the pages, fragile and yellowed with age, until he reaches it, then slides the open book over to Sherlock. “Fair warning, it’s mostly in German.”
“That was the same director that gave me the less Hitler, more Stalin note,” Molly offers. “Fake moustaches.”
Mr Chatterjee is late, but Sherlock doesn’t mind, because he has to finish the last touches on his pies.
John smiles at Sherlock. “After this afternoon, I thought I’d give this thing a try where I actually say what I want.”
They’re both grinning when they walk back to the hotel. The night is lovely, cold but cloudless, and the sky is a stunning tapestry of stars. The moon is nearly full, and Sherlock feels like walking for a bit, so he leads John past the pub. John follows, and they walk for a bit in silence.
Sherlock swallows the words down and ignores how much he enjoyed having John around again at 221B for his recovery. The last four months have been difficult, but without John Sherlock knows he would have never been able to get past the morphine withdrawal and he would have neglected his physical therapy even more than he already did. “Thank you,” he says, and John looks at him, confused. “For the… you know.” He gestures at his chest, where the small scar is still red and angry under his shirt.
“Now it’s time for the contestants to take their bakes to the judges. One of them will be named Star Baker, and one of them will go home.”
“Easier said than done, I’m afraid,” John answers. “I never even realised I had that choice, and it’s scary.”
John smirks at him humorlessly. “No. War is a fucking mess, and good people die. On both sides. But when I was there, I knew what I was supposed to do. I had a place. I belonged. And sure, I hated it sometimes. Many times. But I knew what I was. Knew who I was. And that’s not something you can easily replace.”
John laughs, and Sherlock feels oddly like he just made a perfect souffle or got a tarte tatin exactly right, a small thrill of sweet, sweet victory. They look at each other for a moment, smiling. The entire room smells of cooked apples, sugar and cinnamon, and it reminds Sherlock that he hasn’t really eaten all day. His stomach rumbles loudly, and John’s smile widens.
He cleans up the room and sets up for the rehearsal tomorrow morning, then heads over to the main theatre. The carpenters are constructing the set, and he checks on their progress. He checks with Sally from wardrobe that the fitting for Sherlock is on for Wednesday, and with Molly from props that the contraption they’ve constructed to make Adriana’s vomiting scene look realistic works and is good to go for tech week. He goes to check whether Mike, their chief stage manager, is still in, but his office is dark and there’s a sweet-sour Whisky-vomit smell in the air that tells him Mike wasn’t exactly in top form when he left. Well, he’s used to it.
He gets up, pours himself coffee and checks his emails. He deletes the ten obligatory slur-filled comments from Moriarty’s troll army. They’ve been more active lately since Moriarty ripped his bakery to shreds on his blog. Ironically, it’s been rather good for business, driving people to their doorstep to find out whether they’re really that bad. As always, he refuses to engage with the trolls, or with Moriarty himself. He knows it drives Moriarty nuts that Sherlock never engages with him, but Sherlock doesn’t want to reward Moriarty’s behaviour by contributing to his social media engagements. He also has better things to do with his life.
“It has nothing to do with him,” Sherlock snaps. “I owed Mrs Hudson a favour. She let me out of my contract six years ago. If she hadn’t, I wouldn’t have been able to take that part in New York, and I wouldn’t be where I am now. I didn’t even know he was still there.”
It’s the first time they’ve been alone together in three days, and John has no idea what to say. “You’re in early,” he finally gets out.
“Take ten, we’ll do food porn shots and then we’ll film the judging,” the director yells over the mutterings in the room.
Sarah listens with interest, then takes a sip of her cider. “I just have to ask,” she says, smiling to let him know she’s joking. “How is he to live with?”
The case is glorious. A locked room mystery, a hidden treasure, cryptic messages, old grudges and mysterious poisons. In the course of the case, they climb up the rain-gutter of a two-story building, break into a garret, search for a stolen boat and a missing captain, and finally, incredibly, chase their criminals on the Thames in a racing boat. There’s even a shoot-out between John and one of the criminals.
He swallows, and John frowns at him over the breakfast table. Sherlock shrugs. “No need to chase him, he’s everywhere. We just need to follow the crimes; sooner or later they’ll lead us to him.”
Frustrated, Sherlock grinds his half-smoked cigarette into the gravel with his heel and picks up his equipment. Time to go home.
Finally, John opens his eyes and looks down at him, hair mussed and pupils blown wide, and when he rocks his hips for the first time, both of them gasp. John leans down and kisses Sherlock, open-mouthed and sloppy. “You can move,” he whispers against Sherlock’s lips. “God, fuck, Sherlock, move.”
Sherlock looks at the cane and decides he might as well ask. "It's psychosomatic, you know that, right?"
“Apparently Miss Jones works as a cleaner at the Watch Headquarters,” Sherlock says, meeting John’s uneasy gaze.
John, relieved, squeezes Sherlock’s fingers reassuringly. “Yep. Definitely don’t let go of me, okay?”
Slowly, the crew files in. Dimmock and the other stage hands, Mary, wordlessly getting the lighting plan and vanishing into the theatre, Molly grabbing the can of spray paint to help with painting the set. Sally won’t be in until the final fitting tomorrow afternoon, since this is a very low-maintenance production for her. Four people, modern, no costume changes. Boring, as Sherlock would say.
Early the next day, his mobile rings, which is rare these days, since Lestrade doesn’t talk to him, all his clients think he’s still dead, and he has – temporarily, he hopes – lost his blogger.
He rubs a hand over his face. Sherlock is nothing if not confusing. He’s watching John when he thinks John isn’t looking, then he’s flirting with Irene, then he shows concern for John and then snaps at him. John has no idea what Sherlock is thinking, but that’s nothing new.
“I said if he doesn’t tell you he likes you, you won’t figure it out on your own,” Molly says, looking up at him and giving him a small smile.
John doesn’t bother with taking off his jeans, he just unbuckles the belt and unzips his fly, and the way he unceremoniously bares his erection to Sherlock’s hungry gaze is incredibly arousing. He wraps his hand around himself and gives his cock a long, languid stroke.
For a moment, they just look at each other, and John can almost feel the weight of everything he’s never said to this man like a physical pressure on his shoulders.
John goes. He goes home - to 221 B - and he sleeps, and he showers, and he has breakfast, and he puts one foot in front of the other, because Sherlock needs him to, and that’s reason enough for now.
Sherlock turns off the ignition, and the radio cuts off George Michael in the middle of the word Christmas.
The only acceptable filling for Krapfen is apricot jam. Get out of here with your vanilla and Powidl and chocolate and all of that new-fangled crap. Apricot jam. Icing sugar. The end.
“I’m making fairly classic cranberry-lime scones, and savoury macarons,” he says, and shows them the scone dough he’s just letting rest.
About fifteen miles outside of Kiev, Sherlock pulls over into an abandoned petrol station’s car park and joins John in the back seat.
Sherlock hides his eye-roll and gives her a grateful smile. Anything to win, even if she’s spouting sentimental nonsense.
Finally, he swallows and washes the cip down with the truly awful hot, caffeinated beverage they have the nerve to call tea. He sets the cup down and says, quietly, “Can I ask you something?”
“I love you so much,” John whispers as he sinks down on Sherlock’s cock, slow and reverent and beautiful.
Sherlock starts violently. He looks up at John and there’s something there, something John can’t put his finger on, something in Sherlock’s face, a tension. “Well, I can’t very well tattoo a live one, can I?” Sherlock snaps.
Now he’s leaning against the back wall of the mansion turned hotel, key in his coat pocket and his little overnight suitcase by his feet, having a smoke before he goes in to dinner.
Shut up, or I’ll spam you with emojis all day, and I know you won’t be able to resist finding out what each of them means
“It doesn’t happen often,” he says into the quiet of their sun-flooded living room, looking at the patterns the dust makes in the shafts of sunlight. “I’m clean, really. Today was… an aberration.”
Sherlock introduces Janine, offers tea and plays host with the odd self-awareness that the kitchen he’s standing in technically belongs to his guest.
It turns a bit competitive, the way these things often do. It’s obvious that Sherlock has had more practice, but John is a fast learner and he’s surprisingly good at this, the way he is surprisingly good at a number of things one would never expect just from looking at him. And at a few that are immediately obvious.
She looks down at her hands, her entire body language screaming uncertainty, from her lowered gaze to the slight fluttering of her wings.
“Enjoy it while it lasts. Three ovens, plus the headlights, and we’ll be able to melt chocolate at room temperature.”
Everybody laughs, and Molly continues, “So I had to call, I don’t know, five or six pet stores. Same story. Finally I gave in and bought one.”
He adds the rest of the sugar and shows how the dough now comes together perfectly. He then demonstrates how adding sugar helps yeast dough to rise, and explains how ingredients all react to one another.
“This leaves Jim and John,” Donovan says, giving them all a tight smile. “You’re both wonderful bakers, otherwise you wouldn’t be here. John, you’ve wowed us with your gran’s recipes, and we can all tell that you’re an incredibly skilled baker. These last two weeks weren’t your most stellar ones, though, and while your bakes are always delicious, they’re not always technically perfect, and you’ve lacked imagination in the past. Jim, I think the opposite is true for you. Your bakes are always technically perfect, and your ideas are original and well-executed, they’re sometimes not quite as delicious as they could be.”
“I’m perfectly capable of putting myself to bed,” Sherlock states, then sinks back further into the couch. “I have been drunk before, you know, and I’ve survived the experience without your help.”
And maybe it’s because he’s so very tired, or maybe it’s because life is so bloody short, but for once in his life, he lets gravity take him, and he tilts forward until his head is resting on Sherlock’s uninjured shoulder. Slowly, tentatively, Sherlock’s arms go around him, and then they’re pressed together, Sherlock kneeling between John’s thighs, holding on tightly and just breathing. And John makes a decision, there and then. No more hiding, no more tiptoeing around this thing that is between them, that neither of them ever had the courage to call love. Well, John is a soldier after all. Once more into the breach, and all that.
“How about Moriarty? He blamed you for the accident with the eggs, and said the way you and John sniggered you must have had something to do with it.”
It’s still raining when Sherlock is done with reactions and packing up. The crew are already dismantling the workstations, and Sherlock walks the short stretch to the hotel to get his overnight bag from storage.
And now it’s morning, and John has gone off in search of coffee, and Sherlock is having trouble remembering what he wanted to do for his bake today. Bread is boring at the best of times, but right now he has no desire to stand around an overheated tent literally waiting for bread to prove for four hours.
Sherlock nods, once, and he knows that this is his cue to leave, but somehow, he can’t bring himself to walk away.
The front doors open and the paramedics come in, led by Sherlock, who must have gone out to meet them. At least somebody is doing something useful, John thinks.
“I can fix this, I can, I know I can,” Sherlock says, rubbing his eyes as his vision turns blurry around the edges, the lines of the room are running, melting, and slowly he can see the drab curtains and yellowed walls of the shabby hotel room he’s staying in.
“Good idea.” He smiles at Irene and lets his eyes drop ever so slightly towards her  ample and very attractive cleavage. “Like this?”
Admittedly, he’s never worked with an actor he used to be soul-crushingly in love with who dumped him like hot coals and broke his heart into a million splinters, but there’s a first time for everything.
“At what price?” John demands, matching Sherlock's tone. “We get to go home, and bugger anyone who dies as a consequence?”
“What do you mean?” the doctor asks. “You can’t mean somebody tried to murder two twelve-year-old boys?”
John’s never had a death wish. He never actively tried to end his own life. He isn’t trying now, not really. But he’s tantalizingly close to finally figuring out what the fuck is wrong with him, and he can’t stop himself.
is to get high. Always. So I can’t trust what I want. I have to make decisions based on cold, hard facts. Fact: I barely know you.” He ticks off points with his fingers.  “Fact: I’m perfectly fine on my own. Fact: I will need all my time and attention for my new business, when I finally get it off the ground. Fact:I don’t need you for anything of objective, practical value. So the smart thing, the logical thing, is to just walk away.”
“Yes, please, it seems to work very well,” she says, and her smile grows more genuine. “Thank you, Sherlock, you’re doing good work here.”
He tries to say something. He isn’t sure what comes out of his lips. His voice vibrates pleasantly inside his body, but the sound is indistinct and unidentifiable.
John puts a hand over his mouth and breathes, shocked into stillness. He’s seen dead bodies before, he’s almost a doctor, after all, and he lived in a city that was regularly bombed, but this is somehow different. He remembers her fear, her regret about Violet, and he damns himself for not doing more to protect her.
He closes his eyes and wonders whether it’s possible that he will pass out in this chair sooner or later.
Above their heads, about twenty feet ahead, two creatures hover in the air between the crowns of the trees, gossamer wings keeping them afloat. At first John thinks they’re human, but as they slowly descend, he sees that they’re smaller, lighter, more graceful, with large eyes of earthy colours, hair the shade of trees, greens and browns, and skin in warm natural colours as well. They melt perfectly into the trees, and John is sure that neither he nor Sherlock would have seen them if they hadn’t chosen to reveal themselves.  Both of them are holding small but well-used and dangerous-looking crossbows, and both of them are glaring at them suspiciously.
Sherlock lifts his head from where it’s resting on the back of the uncomfortable green room sofa, and catches Mycroft’s eye. His brother looks bored and out of place, but he’s here, and Sherlock gives him an appreciative nod, which Mycroft returns.
While his sponges are in the oven, he glances around the room. Many of the contestants seem relaxed, the very simple nature of the recipe seems to reassure them. Even Anderson doesn’t seem to have much trouble, and his neighbour, a middle-aged, pouchy man named Mike, seems equally confident, even though he barely made it last week.
he had a fucking knife, and you couldn’t wait five fucking seconds? Five fucking seconds for us to catch up with you?” He’s yelling by the last words, and as he tapes the gauze over the wound, Sherlock winces.
Mike greets him with a good-natured pat on the back. “You’re the first person here who’s managed to talk to him for more than five minutes without punching him in the face. How did you manage?”
John nods, relieved. “Yes, we are. We're children, and we're lost. I'm John Watson, this is Sherlock Holmes. Please help us.”
“Let’s go back.” There’s something in John’s voice, dark and intense, and Sherlock shivers a bit, and not from the cold.
Sherlock closes his eyes and summons the entirety of his remaining patience. “All right. I will let you go to work, I will even go with you, if you can manage to get to the loo and back without assistance.”
Slowly, carefully, not letting go of each other, they make their way into the center of the circle and step into the metal ring.
He could rejoin the others, who at this moment are running out of the front door again with the ostensible purpose to watch the road to the next village for cars, or the skies for planes (there’s an RAF airfield not far away) but he’s tired from not having slept much, he doesn’t care over much for cars, and he’s had enough of planes for a lifetime.
Sherlock’s bedroom is oddly bare, but John doesn’t care, he starts unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt while trying not to break the kiss, and Sherlock does the same to him. Their hands tangle, and they get in each other's way, and it would be faster to just do it themselves, but it doesn’t matter, and Sherlock’s hands on John’s belt buckle are the hottest thing ever.
John contemplates asking what any of this is supposed to be for a moment, but he hasn’t had a lot of sleep, and decides that he doesn’t care. He goes back upstairs and is asleep again within minutes.
They both turn around to see a young man running after them. He's in his early twenties and has dark hair and dark eyes and he's very pale.
John gives him a smug smile that lasts for exactly as long as it takes for him to sit upright. He makes it two steps before Sherlock has to all but catch him and carry him back to bed.
Because John doesn’t only know that Sherlock loves him, he has also discovered something Sherlock doesn’t know and will never, ever believe: John loves Sherlock back.
They step into the shade of the trees. There’s a well-worn path winding through the forest. They follow it.
They’ve been texting back and forth for the last few days. Nothing has been said that is worth repeating, but John has answered every time, and that alone is a promising sign. He’s also started writing in his blog again, and Sherlock has been gobbling up every word, about John’s day, his lunch, and how annoyed he is by Harry. It’s more information about John than he’s had in a year, and it’s making Sherlock greedy for more, more, more, so he’s been spending his days combing back through older blog entries from last year and trying to deduce as much from them as he can. He’s so far resisted snooping around in John’s email account, but the episode with the glasses has brought it into stark relief that he missed an entire year of John’s life, and he wants to know what John has been doing with himself. He hopes that John will start actually talking to him again before he succumbs to the temptation of hacking into John’s laptop.
The pub where they’re staying is just across a very busy country road, and they trek over with their overnight suitcases, all of them sweaty and grumpy.
“January sixth,” he answers, tone as nonchalant as he can make it while his heart is still stuttering. “Just after Christmas. Probably the reason we never really celebrated all that much. Everybody’s still exhausted from another arbitrarily culturally significant date that’s entirely meaningless.”
He nearly runs into John when he comes out of the catering tent and barely manages to avoid scalding either John or himself with hot tea.
John takes Sherlock apart with ruthless efficiency, hands on Sherlock’s hips to draw him closer, and all the while he makes these incredibly erotic greedy little sounds, and Sherlock’s brain is wiped blank of thought, time loses all meaning, his entire awareness centers on John’s mouth, and his hands, and his eyes, boring into Sherlock’s like he’s trying to consume him through sheer will alone. And the thing is, right now, Sherlock would let him, and thank him for it.
Sherlock untangles his arm from his mother’s. “First of all, I hate film. And secondly, and more importantly, I’ve got a previous engagement, and I’ve already kept him waiting for six years. Have a good night.”
That moment, the door opens and a slender, tall boy sweeps in, dressed incongruously in well-fitting, comfortable looking trousers and a well-fitting shirt, and a dark grey wool coat that seems far too big for him. He’s walking by them without looking at any of them, nose buried in a book.
“Calm down, Watson, it’s going to be alright,” he mutters into her hair, and slowly she settles again. He clings to her a bit longer, her small, warm body, her baby-smell, and he’s shocked to discover that he’s missed her, nearly as much as he’s missed John. Maybe more, because she loves him with an easy, uncomplicated self-evidence that is hard to replicate with a grown-up. She only knows that he’s a warm, familiar body who’s been there for most of her short life, and he takes as much comfort from her instinctive trust as he gives her.
“I do not,” Sherlock says, and something’s apparently happened to his tongue as well, because his speech is impaired as well as his vision and his legs. “My weight is perfectly appropriate for my height and my age.”
Laughter all around, and then everybody leaves to get back to their bakes. Sherlock lingers and taps out a quick text.
That twitch of the lips again. “No need to be worried, I assure you. It was already quite dead when I found it.”
John shrugs. “One of them said her stomach hurt. One had a funny little rash, but that could’ve been the fever, both times.”
The email comes on a rainy Wednesday. Sherlock is making raspberry jam, and he’s experimenting with how much of the sugar he can replace with honey. He’s got three batches going, and he’s just measuring out the honey for batch three, spooning out the beautiful, golden syrup into the measuring glass. He adds it to the raspberries and sets the timer for the jam to simmer.
“Oh.” John looks a bit deflated, but he rallies quickly and pours himself some more tea, an obvious ploy to have something to do other than fidget.
For a moment, they stare at each other wordlessly. John looks… Sherlock has no words for how John looks. He looks… blank, kind of. Tired. Sober. He looks done.
"I'm an addict, John. I'm always tempted." Sherlock shrugs again. "But I'm not unusually tempted tonight, if that's what you mean."
I’m sorry too. For the other night. I might have punched you in the face one more time than you actually deserved
“Anything,” John whispers, kissing him back fiercely and intently, fingers winding into Sherlock’s hair. “Anything.”
An hour ago, Sherlock was sure that the world had stopped, that nobody would ever do anything interesting ever again, that nothing would ever happen again.
Sherlock rubs a hand over his face and closes his eyes, just for a moment. He takes a sip of his tea and lets himself sink into his mind palace, going over all the steps of his bake. He feels absolutely rotten.
“We ran away,” Kitty says, gazing at the floor, lost in the memory. “He… was always touching, teasing, but that night, he got… he got violent. And I… grabbed one of the fire irons…” She trails off, wiping a tear away. Then she visibly steels herself to go on. “We didn’t stay to check whether he was still alive. We just ran into the woods. We took all the money and the ration books we could find and ran.”
The lab is dark; the only light comes from a small desk lamp that sits to his right. It smells of chemicals and bad coffee. It’s eerily quiet in here, even though a hospital never sleeps. Up there, people are being born, people are dying, people are being stitched together and people are sleeping, laughing and crying, eating and bleeding, a humming beehive of human conditions.
John grins and struggles to his feet, leaning heavily on his cane. "Definitely. Right now I'd prefer a cannibalistic serial killer to my probably drunk sister."
This seems the perfect opportunity to exit the conversation with everybody’s dignity intact, but as always, John’s curiosity wins out over his sense of self-preservation and he asks, “What did Sherlock say to you?”
John nods. Wordlessly, Sherlock helps him sit up and take the pills, holding the water glass for him.
They bake side by side in a comfortable, companionable silence, both obviously lost in their own thoughts and not minding one bit.
Not that the silence is awkward, precisely. But it does feel heavy. Like words need to be said that Sherlock doesn’t necessarily have. John’s watching him in between shoving chips into his mouth, an adrenaline reaction, no doubt, the body asserting its aliveness by demanding sustenance. He remembers that dinner after John shot the cabbie, how they couldn’t stop grinning at each other, how John shovelled down fried noodles like he’d never see food again, and huffs a little soundless laugh at the memory.
“He kissed me,” John confesses, looking down at his sandwich so he won’t have to see Billy’s expression.
John’s too tired to be angry, and it’s too obvious that Sherlock’s frustrated and afraid and taking it out on him,  but he decides to leave Sherlock to it for now. He gets up without answering, only turning around at the door. “You are a good person. Even if you can’t fix this.”
Sherlock finds himself completely mesmerised by the tops of John’s ears. The gentle curve of his helix, especially.
“Fair enough,” Mrs Hudson says, patting his elbow. “I’m sure you’ll explain to us all what your competitors did wrong in another one of your delightful videos.”
They ditch the car, their clothes and everything else they possess in the outskirts of Prague, where another one of Mycroft’s “associates” meets them with a new set of everything.
“What a season it has been. Amazing bakes, not so amazing bakes, drama, tension, maybe even a bit of romance, if you listen to some of the rumours flying around, which we don’t of course.”
Stunned, John stares at Sherlock, who’s very, very close, and very, very warm, and whose eyes are burning into his with all the force of a barely contained tornado. And the thing is, John believes him. Believes Sherlock would do all of these things for him and more. Nobody’s ever so much as crossed the street for John’s convenience, so it’s a heady feeling to have a force of nature like Sherlock so firmly in his corner.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Moriarty greets him. He smiles at Sherlock with his lips only, the rest of his face oddly and disconcertingly unaffected by the gesture. “Jim Moriarty. Hi.”
And maybe, if he ever does find the answer to the unaskable question, he will lose interest and it will all be meaningless once more. But maybe the answer will make everything even more interesting, even more intense, even more addictive.
“Why do you bake, Sherlock?” John asks, giving him a knowing look. “Honestly. Why? Why do any of us here bake?”
So he says nothing, and watches in silence as Mycroft rises, takes his umbrella, smoothes the crumbs from his trousers.
John smirks at him humorlessly, and says, still in the same quiet tone, “Not two hours ago you peeled about a kilo of Semtex off me, so you’ll forgive me for not wanting to play semantics games right now.”
“Oh, I would, don’t get me wrong. You’re rather pedestrian and boring, and I have enough little helpers to do my dirty work,” Jim says, crouching down so they’re at eye-level. His odd voice is almost hypnotic, and he’s not even trying to hide the Irish lilt now. “But Sherlock, on the other hand…”
On Saturday, he’s the first one to arrive as always. They’re filming in Essex, this time, and the tent has been pitched in the large park of another historic mansion. Sherlock gropes his way to the tent through mud and driving rain, and when he finally finds the entrance, he’s wet and miserable. The tent is dimly lit. It’s an hour past dawn, clouds obscure the sky, and Sherlock for once looks forward to the warmth of nine ovens and the headlights.
"We need to renegotiate several passages," Janine continues, ignoring his pointed silence, and takes a long sip of her coffee. She sighs in pleasure and grins. "Bad pastries, good coffee."
The oven dings, and he takes out his first try of the mini-pies with apple and poppy seed filling. He sets them down to cool and cuts and posts the video.
“What’s yours?” he asks, to get John talking again. He’s already gotten more out of John tonight than he could have imagined in his wildest dreams, and the rush of information is making him greedy. He wants to know what’s going on behind that look in John’s eyes.
And John often watches him like he’s waiting for something, possibly for Sherlock to make up his mind, or to kiss him again. And Sherlock admits to himself now that he
John reaches out his hand and grabs Sherlock’s in the dark without opening his eyes. “I would.” John squeezes his fingers tightly, then lets go. “You’re a wonderful baker. I would consider it a very sound investment.”
His phone dings with a missed text. Mummy. Again. Asking when he’s coming down to Sussex for Christmas.
“I think she used the same tent company,” John says, nudging Sherlock with his foot. “Where to with the cake, Maestro?”
“They’re little, pink - well, I guess, Petits Fours, and they’re layered. Sponge on the bottom, then a mixture of sponge, orange juice or rum, and jam, and then another layer of sponge, and then they’re glazed with a pink sugar icing.”
Sherlock is lying on his bed, fully dressed, fingers steepled under his chin in his favourite thinking pose. He doesn’t even look up when John stumbles out of bed and into the bathroom, but he’s up when John comes back.
Three weeks pass like this, and John already feels like he’s been here for years, and it's not an unpleasant feeling. John receives just one letter from his mother, and none from Harry, but since he didn't expect anything else, he's not disappointed, or at least he tells himself that he is not.
Sherlock leans forward a bit, apparently unafraid, and points his chin at the gun. “That handgun is a Browning, obviously British Army issue, so my guess is you met somebody in the service who made you an offer of gainful employment elsewhere, and you weren’t too fastidious about either telling the British Army, or returning your service weapon.”
John shrugs. “I’m starving.” He sees Sherlock’s hesitation and holds up a hand. “No pressure, I just thought... “ he makes a helpless gesture. “Look, we’ve…I don’t know, we haven’t really had a chance to just, you know, talk?”
Sherlock steps out of his hiding place and leans in the doorway. John has his back to him, and for a moment, Sherlock is tempted to say something, but somehow he doesn’t want to, just wants to have a quiet moment to himself to unabashedly watch John be good at this.
“Fantastic,” Lestrade says. “Innovative, the crumble topping in between the lattice crust. I love it.”
John doesn’t answer, doesn’t turn around. He thinks Sherlock deserves a little silent treatment. He feels Sherlock shift a little against his back.
Sherlock smiles slightly, oddly relieved by the obviousness of the statement. “That’s something, I suppose. Now if we can just get you to be a little glad to have me back,” he adds, trying and failing to make his voice light, to make it sound like a joke.
John looks up from cleaning glasses with a frown. “Why wouldn’t I be? I make decent money, and Mrs Hudson is the only theatre owner I know who isn’t a narcissistic sociopath.”
He’s sorely tempted to tell her that he will come down for Christmas shortly before hell freezes over, but he knows when the day comes, he’ll make the trip because he’d feel guilty if he didn’t, and his parents may be benevolently neglectful, but they didn’t deserve anything of what he put them through over the years.
They walk for a while in silence. They wind through the woods of Mr. Musgrave’s property and finally climb over the fencing that separates Mr. Musgrave’s woods from the neighbouring pasture.
“If you think you’re calling anything tonight, you’re insane.” He holds out John’s phone. “Call Mrs Hudson and tell her you’re sick.”
Sherlock tries his best to ignore John, which isn’t easy, especially because he’s so bored. John’s got his sponges in the oven as well, and he looks over at Sherlock with a smile.
“Gesundheit,” Moran says, and everybody laughs, except Moriarty, who is the only person in the room who doesn't seem to find John charming.
Sherlock’s eyes unfocus, and John knows he’s not looking at John right now, but at something in the vastness of his mind, something only he would see. “There was something about that bank robbery. It was so neat, so precise.” His eyes focus back on John. “You do know that I would never have run.”
Their food arrives, saving him an answer, and John sighs happily. “Oh thank god, food,” he says, then bites into his burger with relish.
Nothing moves. But he can briefly see the glimmer of a mobile phone screen lighting up. Mycroft’s people are still watching the house, then.
Billy glances from the corpse to Sherlock to John. John tries to look unconcerned, but by Billy’s smirk he knows he’s unsuccessful at hiding his tension.
When they finally move apart, Sherlock looks flushed and pleased and happy. “How was the play?” he asks against John’s lips.
John looks at him as though he expects Sherlock to say something, and when he doesn’t, he continues, soldiering on, body tense and straight and very nearly at parade rest. “This could be our last night together.”
The other contestants and the finalists’ guests start arriving. Molly’s fiance is hovering in the background, looking uncomfortable, but Irene scoops him up and soon he’s chatting away with the other bakers. Anderson, Dimmock and Black Forest Gateau are standing awkwardly together. Sherlock barely remembers them, and it brings starkly into relief how much has happened in the last few weeks. They seem to be from another lifetime, another him.
John gestures at the handprint and Sherlock smiles as well, and John thinks how different Sherlock is from the man John met so many years ago, who would have thought it the height of weakness to be fondly amused and more than a bit sentimental about a two-year-old’s jammy handprint. “Apricot,” Sherlock muses after a few moments of contemplation, and they both grin.
“But you said nobody ever heard from them again,” Sherlock insists. “That’s not what people do. They write letters. They buy tickets. They communicate their intentions to their neighbours.”
Sherlock can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t keep his eyes open, he’s drowning in sensation, John’s voice, his breath in Sherlock’s ear, his hand on Sherlock. Sherlock moans and John swallows the sound with his lips, kissing Sherlock like he’s dying, like they’re both dying, and Sherlock’s entire being is reduced to one thought:
Something about the question brings up a memory of his talk with Harriet earlier in the week, and Sherlock swallows. “John?”
“It’s mine.” He hesitates when Mrs Hudson frowns a bit. “My nanny used to make sticky toffee pudding. She was the only one who could cook - or bake for that matter - in my family.”
“He wasn’t ill, he was just an idiot.” They all laugh at Sherlock’s dry tone, and then he continues the story, “So the actor playing our gangster boss looked at me, and I could see the panic in his eyes. So we improvise, he insults me, I defend myself. Then our colleague runs back on stage, wriggles himself back into his ropes, and continues the scene as if nothing happened. We later found out that he’d left the MacGuffin on the props table, and he had to get it, because the play would have stopped dead in its tracks if he hadn't. The audience found the whole thing hilarious, and thought it was part of the play.”
“Dead no more than twelve hours. Footprints, size of shoes says killer most likely a man of above average height and build. Abandoned warehouse means premediation,” Sherlock rattles off, barely looking at Lestrade, gazing at the corpse, taking everything in. “No sign of violence, which begs the question of how he got her to take the poison. Didn’t hide her in a cellar this time, didn’t dump her in the river, so he wanted her to be found. Warning, maybe?”
Mrs Hudson sets down the pot of stew and John automatically helps her set the table and get water. Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice them, he’s reading a Feyara (the Fey’a language) newspaper, only moving when he’s turning a page. He’s still spending much, if not most of his time trying to find any and all information on the gate, trying to find a clue to how they might reopen it.
John grimaces around another bite of scone. “Oh god. I’m bad at arts and crafts. But I have a delicious gingerbread recipe.” He taps the cover of the black notebook he brought with him.
“I don’t have to, you arrogant sod! You’re no copper, nor no magistrate neither, you’ve got no right to accuse me of anything,” Billy says, and it’s clear from his demeanour that he’s neither afraid of them nor in any way prepared to be cooperative.
Sherlock huffs a laugh, and Mrs Hudson pats his arm. “Look at the bright side. With divorce rates being what they are, we’ll have John back at Baker Street in three years, at the latest. Meanwhile, I suggest you find yourself a nice girl, or chap, and practice a bit.”
Sherlock looks slightly shell-shocked, and John continues, “You didn’t even tell me you’d gotten the role. I learned it from Mrs Hudson when I came in to work the next day and you were gone. And it sort of made me question-” he makes an all-encompassing gesture with his hands “- just, everything, I guess. Our entire relationship. I thought if you didn’t find it worth your while to tell me you were leaving the country, you must’ve thought we’d just had casual fun, and I just read too much into it.”
But John was happy with Sherlock. Before. Usually he had some boring girlfriend on the side, but they were little more than cover stories John told himself, and sometimes a good shag. All the things that
Sherlock leaves, and John walks onto the stage. Mary’s already at her lighting console, which is sitting in the sixth row on a board across the seats. She looks up from programming it for a moment, and gazes at John critically, head cocked to one side. “You’re still in love with him.”
“Honestly?” John gives him an inscrutable look and a tiny, sad smile. “Last year. I was sitting in Harry’s kitchen, getting drunk on eggnog, eating leftovers from your funeral. Then I was sick twice and Harry had to help me to bed. And all the while I was thinking that any second now, you’d burst through the door and drag me off to Beirut or Italy or something.”
“You think they were planning on coming back?” John asks, nudging at one of the crates with his foot.
John huffs out a laugh, and nods. “Well, that’s most likely true. So I’m not going to worry about it and get myself a cup of tea. See you around.”
“It was a long time ago. I never talk about it,” Sherlock says. “I wasn’t close to my father. Still, I suppose that counts as the worst Christmas ever.”
John’s home for exactly five seconds when Billy knocks, and from the ashen colour of his face, John knows it’s not good news.
Listra’s eyes light up with interest, and she all but shoves John aside and leans over Sherlock’s workspace.
“Do you ever have the urge to do something stupid?” John asks after a while. “Not a bit stupid, or slightly silly, but something explosively, destructively stupid?”
He lifts his shirt and she examines his bruises again. “Looks about as well as was to be expected,” she says, probing gingerly with her fingers, making John wince. “Sorry.”
“And if you’d stayed, who knows if either of us would be sitting here today,” Victor points out, still gentle, but still firm. “I wasn’t ready to get sober. You were.”
Lya looks at him for a long time, then another Fey’a leans in and whispers something into her ear. Finally, she nods and lowers her spear. At a sign from her, the other Fey’a put their weapons away as well. “You make a good point, John Watson,” she says, gesturing at Sherlock on the ground. “Your friend needs medical attention. We will take you both to our home. In the morning, we will bring you to the edge of the Forest. And after that, I fervently hope I never see you again.”
Billy looks thoroughly unimpressed. “And you didn’t like it?” he asks, still apparently unsure what the fuss is about.
Better to let sleeping dogs lie. John is here, after all, not with his current girlfriend, whose name he probably doesn’t even remember right now. Choosing Sherlock. Beside him, gladly, smiling, happy. Why tamper with something perfect, Sherlock thinks as their prey finally, finally, arrives and they burst out of the car, chasing after the criminal through the darkened London streets that are home, battlefield, playground and hunting ground all in one. John grins at him as they run, and Sherlock thinks,
John gets up from the bench and takes a step closer to Sherlock. “You do this to me all the time. Push me away and pull me back in. You say it’s just a bit of fun, but you invite me into your kitchen, you make me stay the night, you massage my shoulder and you tell me secrets, you bake a cake for me on national telly.”
Sherlock closes his eyes again and thinks, as the door opens, the lights go on, and it begins again, that he needs to survive this, because he needs to know the answer to that question.
“What is he doing in Yemen?” Sherlock asks, even though the answer occurs to him two seconds after the question is out of his mouth. “Of course,” he says. “Doctors Without Borders, is it?”
John rubs a hand over his face and looks at him, and Sherlock can see the bone-deep tiredness he barely concealed all day. “I’m giving you every benefit of the doubt right now and assuming that you’re not
Sherlock smiles, and in his joy he manages to ignore that John’s voice sounds as if he was just involved in an exhausting wrestling match and lost.
John grins and looks down on his phone again. “The Science of Baking,” he reads out. “How not to whisk egg whites. How not to make shortcrust pastry. So you’re telling people how
“I did it because I wanted you to like me,” he confesses quietly. It’s the truth, too, even though it only occurred to him much later why he was showing off that much that first evening.
It’s a rhetorical question, and they both know it, so Sherlock doesn’t bother answering. “Please tell me what you want, our dinner is getting cold.”
The Midnight Queen nods. “Yes.” She looks down at her hands and when she continues, her voice has an absent-minded, faraway quality to it. “The gates are a burden for us, left to us by our ancestors. We don’t really understand them. They are by their very nature unstable, like rope bridges swinging in the wind. Certain things can be done to stabilise the connection. Crystals, certain metals, spells and rituals. But what you need to understand is that the Ways between the worlds weren’t made by our ancestors, but discovered. They’re here no matter what we do. So we didn’t close the Gates. We wouldn’t know how. We just made them impassable by removing the trappings that made them stable. When we discovered what had happened to the Great Mother Crystal, we took it back. But he had a replacement. So we rigged the Gate to blow up. You know this, as you triggered the trap that was meant for him.”
They look around the tent, and then retrace their steps along the path they took to the house yesterday. Sherlock notes that John’s limp is almost unnoticeable this morning, and he wonders what that means. They find the cane about halfway to the back entrance, lying in the grass, abandoned and forgotten by John as he ran after Sherlock.
“So,” John says, smiling at him, standing facing him in front of the stainless steel fridge, the dim light from above the sink picking out the gold strands in his hair. “Good night, then.”
John frowns, the disappointment on his face replaced with confusion. “Explain to me how this only dessert thing is supposed to work.”
John turns around and is about to say something, but Sherlock just smirks. “I don’t need luck, Jim. So why don’t you just let it
“Jim quit?” John repeats, incredulous. An actor walking out of a production this late is almost unheard of.
John’s hand on his belt buckle is the best thing ever, and John’s fingers wrapping around his cock are cool and mind-numbingly, bone-meltingly good. John is nibbling on his neck while slowly, deliberately and expertly taking Sherlock apart. In what seems no time at all, Sherlock is a panting, quivering mess, poised on the razor edge of a spectacular orgasm.
Sherlock nods and looks at him with so much open fondness that John feels stupid for ever doubting that Sherlock loves him. “I’ll see you in three days.”
John looks from the book to Sherlock and his lips twitch with suppressed amusement. “You ‘fixed’ the baking instructions, didn’t you?”
He wants a shower and a haircut and Angelo’s lasagna. A good night’s sleep and the sound of London traffic outside his window.
John rubs a hand over his face, and suddenly he looks so very tired, like it’s two in the morning after days of little sleep, which of course it is. “What…” he stops himself, and tries again, “What did you think was going to happen tonight, when you went to meet him?”
John laughs against Sherlocks’ lips, and then he straightens and nods once to signal that he’s ready.
He opens his eyes. John is standing by the workstation and unpacks. He looks over at Sherlock and smiles, lifting his tea in wordless thanks.
Sherlock shrugs and takes a sip of his tea. It's a very nice herbal chai blend, and Sherlock enjoys the smell and the heat of the spices blooming behind his nose.
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but you look like shit,” Sherlock says, stepping around him to get himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock walks to the guest room on autopilot, and collapses on the bed. He closes his eyes and thinks,
“Attention, Sherlock,” Irene says, and he can hear her predatory grin in her voice. “Instagram followers. YouTube followers. Sponsorship deals.”
Sherlock looks at it critically. The bottom is a bit thick, and John seems to have glazed the top with something or other, but it looks utterly unimpressive. Sherlock dismisses the tasting from his notice and starts cleaning up.
It occurs to him that he’s being ever so slightly irrational. But at the same time he doesn’t want to wake John. They’ve had little sleep lately; the case kept them up, and before that John had a few bad nights, nightmares driving him out of bed at three in the morning. John needs to rest. And Sherlock… well, if he’s entirely honest with himself, and he always tries to be, well, Sherlock’s sort of… enjoying this. The very fact that John fell asleep waiting on a murderer is so very John-like that Sherlock can’t help but find it endearing, if slightly inconvenient. It’s such unmistakeable proof that he
