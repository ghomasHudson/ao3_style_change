“Actually, I really think you need to have that looked at. At least let me look you over,” Bruce said firmly when Steve sent a baleful look his way. Tony couldn’t help the smirk that crossed his face. Ha. His Science Bro was the only one who also saw reason.
Natasha walked in, and Tony felt instant companionship with her, knowing at least he wasn’t the only one tightly wound. Tony wasn’t sure what Clint said to Natasha that day they had found out about Coulson, but it appeared that the archer somehow convinced her from going after the Not Dead Agent. The next morning, she was at breakfast — quiet and surly, but there. The little crack learning about Coulson’s status caused was still there, but the team held together. Tony had to figure that counted for something. They’d upped their searching on Hydra, dove more thoroughly into their searches on the Shield agents, and somehow kept themselves a unit, instead of breaking under the pressure that kept piling on top of them.
“Darcy assures me it is a most honored Midgardian tradition,” Thor replied, eyes sparkling. “You must participate, Stark. I’d hate to hear the horrors of what occurs if you beget tradition and ignore the power of the mistle. ’Tis bad luck.”
, Tony. You’ve earned a break. Let them handle it, let Thor deal with Loki. Come back with me to Malibu.”
Warmth curled through him, like he’d just stepped into the sun after a week in the workshop. “You’re welcome.”
“Oh great. That’s not disturbing at all,” he said, setting down gently enough that Steve could jump down. Thor crashed to the ground next to him, not nearly as gently, crushing the asphalt and scowling at the building.
“Fuck off, Barton, it’s my Tower, I’ll nap where I want,” Tony said, without any heat. But he budged over, allowing the archer to plop between them, his head in Natasha’s lap and his feet in Tony’s. That seemed obnoxiously rude, but since it was the first time Tony had seem him smiling since Loki had fucked with his head, he kept his complaints in and didn’t shove the bastard’s feet to the floor. He knew Clint had been working through what had happened with Nat and Bruce and a Shield therapist, and he felt a twinge of guilt for not being around to offer a shoulder as well. He could at least let the guy use him as a foot rest.
Pride —— strong and fierce and bright — erupted through Tony while he and Steve locked eyes. He was so lucky enough to know this man, to call him friend. Steve would get back, and they would take the Hydra bastards down, then find Loki. Make things right. They would do that together, because somehow, despite their rocky start, the two of them had clicked, and Tony couldn’t imagine getting through one day after the other without Rogers by his side.
Chuckling, Tony stretched some more while the elevator lifted him up. His favorite blend was in the communal floor, so JARVIS wasn’t entirely fabricating. He’d have to get a cup while figuring out whatever J was up to.
And then somehow found himself relaxing on the couch with his teammates, he realized, as Thor plopped on the floor in front of them, and stretched his legs out. Damned if he wasn’t quite sure how that had happened.
Steve sketched on the way, and Tony fiddled with work on his tablet, trying to keep from peeking or asking Steve what he was drawing. Somehow he managed to resist, but one day, dammit. One day he’d get the courage to ask Steve to see his drawings. Not that Steve even noticed his interest, he was so absorbed in whatever his work was that he failed to notice the way Tony’s eyes darted to him every thirty seconds.
as you flew that nuke into the portal. You got lucky this time, Tony, but what about next time? What if you stop getting lucky? If you continue with being an Avenger, you’re going to get yourself killed.”
“Like anyone would ever expect you to sit still and not act,” Tony said, making Steve laugh. Opening up a drawer, Tony found some paper and pens Pepper had left with him ages ago and held it out. “Write down everything you know about Hydra, and everything you’ve suspected before brining this to me. We’ll add it to JARVIS’s files so we can expand on the search as needed.”
Some nights he worked until his eyes nearly bled, face-planting into the workshop table to keep the images of a portal and space out of his head. Other nights, however, Steve lured him out with food and movie nights, insisting Tony still had to help him catch up on his list of things to learn about the 21st century. On those nights, Tony fell asleep with his head on Steve’s shoulder, Steve’s breath drawing steadily in his ear.
“Will you have our back if shit goes down?” Tony asked. He was skating too close to the line, he knew it. Risking tipping that they knew about Hydra, when they really didn’t know shit yet.
Weeks later, Tony sat in yet another Department of Damage Control meeting, rubbing his hand over his face. Since he’d learned that there were Chitauri weapons being picked up throughout the city and sold in the blackmarket, he’d worked tirelessly with the DoDC to get them all back. Each and every one of them went into a locked vault at the Tower. Shield was kept far from it, to avoid any Hydra agents getting their hands on them.  It was working, or at least Tony thought it was, but keeping up with the weapons on top of strategizing with Thor in the mornings and Steve in the evenings was running him ragged.
“We got lucky,” Tony said quietly, looking away from the cat and out at the Potomac from Fury’s massive ass windows. “Earth won’t be able to handle another alien invasion like that.”
“Expensive stuff, Tony.” Steve’s lips press against his skin, his beard a newfound sensation that makes Tony shudder involuntarily. Tony’s free hand grasps at the edge of the counter for support. “You’re exhausted,” he murmurs, nosing the brown curls at the nape of his neck. “Did you drive here straight from the airport?”
“You’re alright,” Steve repeats, sitting down in the chair next to Tony’s bed, trying to calm the other man. He watches Tony’s hand as it raises, resting against the reactor through the thin fabric over his chest. “I promised you I’d get it for you. I – got the other stuff, too.” A few articles of clothing, nothing more – the hotel room had been rather desolate compared to Tony’s usual opulence – or, previous opulence. The man on the hospital bed is not the same man Steve had known five years ago.
Steve thinks he might be the closest one to sober in the whole room. Besides Nat. But even drunk, she’s practically sober. He looks at the scene before him with a laugh. They’re chanting for him. Rallying for him. All these people are here for him, in support for him, working for his cause. When Steve first ran for city council all those years ago to stop discrimination in local government, he never could have thought people would support him in an eventual congressional campaign, let alone a presidential one. And yet- here he stands, a room chanting for him.
“Morning, Stark,” Steve grins, and Tony doesn’t miss Steve’s seemingly casual deep blue, well-cut suit, “How are you feeling?”
And this morning, he’s almost twenty minutes behind. Impeccably dressed, sure, but there’s that flicker again, that hesitancy. He looks tired. Nat makes a mental note to force some of her makeup bag on him, maybe try smearing some concealer on the dark bags under his eyes. All three of Steve’s closest advisors watch as he reaches for a yellowing pear and a cardboard cup full of orange juice.
“ Tony leans forward with a lopsided grin, turns his straw in random figure eights in the ice water, “Or maybe they’re trying set us up.”
In the past, Steve had boldly and happily faced rallies that filled stadiums full of supporters wearing buttons with his name written in big blue letters, and every last one of the filled seats included a proud supporter screaming his name. He’d dealt with all of Congress as if battling a militant infant, strong and brave and loud. Hell, Steve’s gone into multiple literal war zones. But this? This feels worse, somehow. Marching to an unknown doom. He feels like an oversized pair of flip flops are sinking into the metaphorical quicksand in his stomach.
And then Tony turns, faces the other side, gives the paparazzi what they want. He’s guided toward the pink steps, literally glowing, and they’re both lead toward the few reporters given passes to stand in front of the velvet rope for interviews, microphone in hand. They’re immediately split up.
“JARVIS, route me to my meeting with Rogers, yeah?” He asks, fingers transcribing mindless equations onto his watch on the short walk from the landing pad to the back elevator leading surreptitiously to Tony’s personal garage out of the building.
“Great,” Nat says, her usual cool slipping away just minutely and her voice comes out harsher than normal, “Good night.”
“I don’t think so, Nat. This isn’t the kinda thing I want to do over the phone. I hurt him, I was rude, and now I’ve almost completely flipped on what I said to him before. I need to do it in person.”
“Oh, Tony, it doesn’t have anything to do with you. It’s just- I’ve never had my own yard before,” He says the last part so quickly, Tony has to latch onto the words like a man jumping off a train to really get them.
“Of course, Senator Rogers,” Tony eventually says. He’s never used Steve’s title before. Steve’s called that all the time, but it suddenly sounds wrong, like bald tires on a gravel road, rolling hopelessly in the wrong direction, “Anytime. Good luck.”
“Hey, Steve?” Nat asks later, 50,000 miles in the air, her almighty tablet perched within her fingers, tipped amiably in Steve’s direction, “Did you ever give Tony that call?”
It’s not until Tony walks onto the back deck and finds Steve fiddling with a powerwasher (commercial brand too, Tony notes to himself, not-at-all-bitter) that they truly reach a certain milestone of domesticity. It’s also notable to mention that Tony notices he does not mind one bit. Surprising, but… completely fine. Domestic Stark, huh. Who would’ve ever thought?
It’s not until three days later, the yard perfectly manicured and the back deck power washed down to its freshest color, that Steve’s domesticity streak comes to a head.
The smile folds into an equally roguish grin that Steve also just so happens to miss dearly, “Of course. Pepper misses your husky, manly voice. She’s stuck talking to me all day now. Yes,
Tony slumps further into the couch, simultaneously relieved and disappointed when Steve’s face fades into the Shark Tank logo then a commercial for hemorrhoid cream. Nat doesn’t stop laughing.
“I couldn’t have asked for a better outcome,” he admits, eyes bright. Bruce gives him two smiling thumbs up, “In fact, I gotta admit, I’ve always had kinda a crush on Mr Stark, so I’m really excited to get the chance to work with him.”
“Alright, alright,” Steve mumbles distractedly on Thursday morning, furiously crossing out a line of his speech that had sounded wrong coming out of his mouth. He glances up at Bucky and Sam, “You guys should go get ready soon, we gotta leave in less than half an hour.”
He doesn’t say Tony’s ridiculous. He doesn’t say he’s making stuff up, or that he’s all in his own head. He just sighs sympathetically, sweetly. Tony treasures this reaction.
Both of them have red hot tempers, they always have. Steve realizes that now, and he realizes that his feelings still exist, rooted deep somewhere in the spot immediately adjacent to that redhot button inside him that always causes trouble. Steve wants to give things another shot. He misses Tony.
“Wakey, wakey,” He murmurs, leaning the top of one thigh against the edge of the lounge chair as he kneels in the grass beside his husband, “Wanna go in? Take a shower?”
“You’re late,” A blazing redhead says, seemingly appearing out of nowhere with an important-looking folder perched in the crook of her elbow, hip popped to complete the look. Tony would bet pennies on the dollar that she would get along with Pepper like gangbusters. He makes a mental note never to introduce the two, but suddenly the woman is turning gracefully and marching down the hallway, “He’s waiting for you.”
“Morning,” Tony says right back, tipping his mug amiably in his husbands direction, “What’re you up to?”
-“ He stops abruptly, turns to face Nat with furrowed brows. “You don’t think I know that it’s affecting the campaign? You think I haven’t noticed? I saw the polling from Idaho. They all think I’m a moody asshole because I was on the phone the night before with a guy and I don’t know how to keep my feelings in check. You think I don’t know this is a disaster? I’m trying to be the president of the United States of America and I can’t get over a crush like some sort of- hormonal teenager. Trust me, Nat. I know.”
“Thank you. Very much. That’s why I called actually to- thank you. Personally. For your contribution. It was very generous.”
Tony follows his eyes, and sure enough there are two distinct beige-colored hand prints stenciled in on Tony’s hips.
“Apparently you made a good impression. He told Pepper to announce his complete support for your campaign.”
The next morning, Nat’s up bright and early as per usual. She does her typical wake up calls, calls out the detailed agenda for the day multiple times to the gathered crowds of volunteers. She stands outside of Sam’s door and knocks for seven minutes straight without stopping before he finally come out, shirtless, to call her an asshole. She smiles sweetly and tells him that they’re leaving in ten minutes.
“Sounds great, Steve,” Nat says, clamping down on an irritated yawn, “I’ll make sure everybody’s informed of the changes in the morning. Is there anything else?”
The thing about Steve Rogers is that he’s on a bit of a political streak, and everybody knows it. Something about a midlife crisis. He’s seemingly no longer interested in the mundane. He wants to make a difference, wants to speak out. It’s all very noble of him. Controversial, too, often enough. And picking the infamous Tony Stark, the man behind the Iron Man mask, to be your model for the met gala is about as controversial as it gets. Being a superhero comes with a lot of controversy in Tony’s experience, but Steve seems to want to almost embrace that.
Nat’s eyes dart knowingly to Steve, his arms crossed nervously over his chest. She grins, “Stark everybody is better at hiding it than you. But No, he’s not an asshole. Somehow. His best friends on the other hand…”
Nat reads off a list of names he’s heard before, a couple he hasn’t. She has their large-bill donations memorized in a spreadsheet in her head. She’s like some kind of super computer, strategic and brilliant, and Steve’s never stopped being grateful to have her on his team. She does, however, look much better in a dress than a computer, that’s for sure.
“Alright,” Tony says eventually, neatly folding up the relevant documents and clapping them gently against the tabletop. Tony smiles again and a million happy memories flood Steve’s mind. He wonders, briefly and self-deprecatingly, what it’s like in Tony’s mind at that moment too, probably bereft of longing, romantic, Steve-related daydreams that’s for sure, “I think that’s about everything.”
Steve feels his cheeks burn despite his smile. There’s something about the way Tony said it, like he knows exactly what he had before him and he knows exactly what he wants to do with it. It makes an excited shiver run through Steve’s body from his crossed ankles to his hand wrapped around his wine glass.
Stark’s laugh turns into a smile that looks scarily like Steve’s own campaign smile. Huh. Steve proudly notes that his laugh still exists in his eyes. Tony winks at Steve then spins around, spots Nat making a beeline towards them.
It’s the emotional, dumbass, stupidly-in-love-with-Tony part of his brain that takes hold and spits back with the guttural sort of laugh, “I broke up with you, didn’t I?”
Steve nods, takes another stab at the small dirt mountain now taking up their driveway, “I know, but I wanted to do it this year.”
“And we got a new one. Pepper Potts and Tony Stark, from Stark Industries. They used to do weapons development, but there was an incident, and Stark turned his company around. Now they’re in the clean energy business. Very interested in charity, huge pockets. But they don’t usually donate to political campaigns, so we’re lucky to even have them. They’re the most important guests of the night, so make sure you don’t fuck it up with them. I know Pepper personally, and if one of them decides they like you, you’ll be gold for the rest of the campaign, I promise.”
“Uh, hey, Nat. What’s up? You disappeared. We have the, uh, Stark Industries lunch at any minute. You ready?”
“Hi,” Steve says, channeling his carefully perfected presidentially apt character. He leans an elbow against the host’s cramped podium, “I have a reservation at 1 under the name Steve Rogers.”
Tony snorts involuntarily, “I have a faster way to travel. I don’t have to worry about arranging any of that, don’t fret.”
Nat grins wickedly, leaning back effortlessly against her seat, stacks and stacks of poll results and schedules and printed emails from voters sit prettily in her lap.
“Hello, Mr Stark?” A voice says as the gentle polka of the hold music is abruptly cut off mid-phrase, “You there?”
If one of the reporters from the press corps were to traipse out of their room at that moment in search of ice chips or a late night vending machine snack, Steve would have a hell of a lot of explaining to do.
Steve hesitates, can sense the hinges of the leaf-covered trap door creaking under his feet, but he takes the bait anyway, “Really?”
Tony whips around to face Steve, once again six inches shorter, and his shock is caught cruelly in the shiny triad of mirrors, “Seriously? That’s it?”
Tony snorts, “Gotta love those wily redheads,” He says, a sarcastic light in his eye that reminds Steve of cheap pocketfuls of canapés and nice, little, beige corners.
“Sir,” He says, approaching Tony. He can’t help but notice that the guy looks so effortless in his suit. Steve feels like a monkey in a wedding dress, but this guy? This guy could’ve been born in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, cufflinks tightened around his tiny, baby wrists, and Steve wouldn’t question it, “Thank you so much for coming out tonight to support me. I really appreciate it.”
So she tries it again, a couple times. She brings up Tony’s name in various conversations, all within different contexts. Each time, she shares a look with Bucky as Steve visibly tenses. Bingo. Nat’s starting to understand.
When he’s asleep, Nat does have a talk with the lead publicist though, talks damage control, the possible effects that would occur if Steve came out to America as dating one of the most controversial figures in science and technology during the most important, long-drawn-out job interview of his life. While the public has known that Steve is gay since his very first run for Congress way back when, a gay man winning the presidency is unprecedented. A single gay man dating a billionaire is something of another caliber altogether. They crunch some numbers together, whisper in hushed voices back and forth, discuss some key states and some shifting schedules, but decide that they could still win if Steve decides to do something about his recently embraced feelings.
Tony takes three long strides toward Steve and wraps his arms immediately around his husband's neck. Like an instinct, Steve’s hands anchor themselves at Tony’s waist.
He forces himself to flip the switch and with every ounce of strength in his body trades out the easy ‘baseball-playing, friendly, beer-drinking neighbor’ grin for his bespoke political smile, even just smiling at a wall into a phone. He hates it, but Nat’s voice in his head reminds Steve how important Tony’s support is.
When he returns back to the main room, it doesn’t take long before the large group is chanting his name again. He takes his first sip of champagne. Steve tells himself that he’s imagining the way Nat’s eyes follow him, narrowed, as he walks around the room, chatting with his more humble supporters.
Then there’s Tony Stark, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, tech mogul that inherited his father’s name and company then nurtured said company into the highest grossing tech conglomerate of all time. His temerity in the industry and his lightning-fast turnover rates has earned him the nickname ‘mr invincible’. Stark isn’t known for being nice or playing fair, he’s known for investing a lot in a little and making big money, he’s known for making people billionaires, and he’s known for having an ego the size of the New York skyline and a list of bed partners to match it. he’s known for being a goddamn legend (and he’s known for having a soft spot for beefcake blondes).
After entering the tri-state area airspace, he lands on top of his personal Stark Tower landing pad. There’s a news chopper hovering above the K in his name and a posse of angry protestors waiting for him outside of the lobby 100 floors below. Home sweet home, or something like that. He doesn’t intend to stay long anyway- Cali’s calling or whatever other hippie bullshit he wants to use to rationalize his return.
The next day, the two of them are pasted onto the front page of almost every tabloid in America. In a few, there’s an inner spread about the supposed timeline of their clandestine relationship, the blurry picture of their date pasted next to an immaculate photo of them preening for the cameras at the Met.
By the time she’s done telling him about his day, he feels stronger, more ready. He nods in the mirror, “Alright, Nat,” He says, convinces himself that he at least sounds convincing, “Let’s go then. Let’s do this.”
Tony’s face contorts like iron under a hot flame, but before he can say anything, Steve spots his usual town car pulling up to the curb and he rushes for it. His chance to flee. He doesn’t wait to find out what’s on the other side of that half-cocked expression.
There’s this prolonged moment of silence, Steve’s fists curl and uncurl tightly, and Nat stands perfectly still watching him. Steve expects sympathy, encouragement, maybe an ‘
“Yeah,” The guy mumbles, nodding, “Thinks you’re gonna do great things or something. Boost the economy by supporting small businesses blah blah blah. I don’t know.”
There’s that tell-tale flash of recognition in the young waiter’s expression, but he looks just as bored as before as he clicks at the touch screen behind the host stand. He grasps a pile of open faced leather bound menus and steps away from the podium.
Steve shoves a hand into one of his pants pockets. He can hear Bucky’s voice in his head, warning him not to wrinkle the suit, but the pocket-shoving is the natural progression from his so-called baseball grin. He can practically feel himself reverting to his old, non-presidential-candidate self, with the heavy New York accent and the tennis shoes with holes worn through them. He’s reminded, once again, of the simian feeling.
Tony doesn’t respond, just watches Steve as he tugs on the extension cord one last time and switches the knob from OFF to ON. It whirs to life, and Steve smiles devilishly.
“Come on man,” Clint calls out exhaustedly, “Just go with your gut feeling. Who do you want to work with?”
Then Nat’s curving a good natured punch into the billionaire’s shoulder, and Steve’s whole body grows stiff watching from his tense shoulders to his locked knees, he’s like a victim of Medusa, feet cemented together and his joints made of granite as Tony smiles into the gesture.
“Well, yeah, maybe a little, but I don’t mind. C’mon, babe, stop worrying. You don’t even have to do anything. Grab a chair and sit out here with me. It’ll be fun.”
She grins slyly at him from under her eyelashes, pinning his hand to the table with the threatening intent of a nail clipper, “Can’t tell. Surprise. Boss’s orders.”
Nat explains the itinerary. Strict, fast, precise. Steve nods along, taking a big bite of fruit as she hits noon in his upcoming day. The pear’s nearly gone by the time she tells him what time he’ll be going to bed tonight. Surprise, surprise: another long day.
“Call him.” Nat basically commands late one night, standing in his doorway. It had been another long day. A better reception in North Carolina than they had even hoped for. Steve had wanted to stay up at the lobby bar with Sam and Bucky, but Nat insisted on walking him up to his hotel room. He needed sleep.
“Oh be quiet, Barton. The adults are talking,” Tony chides, looking up from his legal pad to watch the way Steve bounces on the balls of his feet, “Steve, i wanna make you a deal.”
Nat looks down at her pajamas, up at Steve, back down to her clothes, and back up at him, “About that,” She says, slowly and intentionally, “I’m feeling a bit under the weather. I think you’ll just have to go alone.”
Steve sits there, cheap LED light bulbs flickering above him, for longer than he would normally take the luxury. Huh. He shakes his head, dismounts heavily from the countertop, and finally unlocks the door.
Tony hisses under his breath, “Shut it, princess. You’re gonna lose this pitch for all of us before it even starts.”
“So, Rogers” Nat says, a sly, patently Romanoff smile pulling at the corners of her lips, “You gonna tell us why Stark made a visit to the hotel last night?”
Steve can’t help but notice that they make a beautiful pair. Tony, with his natural fit in that suit, looking like he invented the very idea of a formal party. And Nat, in that black dress that gets her hit on more than anybody else in the room. It hugs her curves and dips just low enough to show off her cleavage, and her startlingly red hair is swept to the side in a way that exposes most of her neck. She stuns. Steve’s always wished he could look that good (In a suit. Not a dress. Suit.)
It’s like if a flock of seagulls learned English and you have a single piece of bread in your pocket and they all know it. They all demand something at the same time, raising their individual voice to be heard over the mob, a pandemonium of its own, each voice like a single wave within a tumultuous sea.
Tony practically throws himself at his coffee, “Pepper’s gonna be so pissed that she has to unfile this paperwork.”
“Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!” The chant starts, probably from Bucky, but it spreads from Sam to the rest of the room in no time.
Alone again, Tony lets his feet fall to the floor and he grabs at the magazine, flipping to the page with the completely fabricated article on his new relationship with the designer. Reading through it makes him laugh.
“You could still move in, y’know,” Steve murmurs into Tony’s hair, his lips to his partner’s scalp, “I’ve got plenty of space up in the East wing. You can be my first gentleman.”
Steve slowly looks up at her, eyes narrowed, “Yeah,” He says, shimmying his newspaper out from under her phone. She’s inching into emotional territory that Steve currently doesn’t want to touch with a ten foot pole, “I’ll tell him that.”
Tony shrugs again, “No. I have FRIDAY monitoring all channels, believe me, but I still want to be careful. You’re great in the sack, Rogers, but I’d prefer not to die just because I needed to get laid.”
“Well?” Steve asks anxiously, his arms crossed over his chest. “I mean, hair will grow back, Tony… You can cut my hair, if you want to get revenge. Totally understand."
He manages to lift his right arm, trembling fingers pressing against the front of his hospital gown – and he doesn’t feel metal and glass like he did last time, but the rough fabric of sutures.
“God damn it,” he mutters as the phone vibrates again, more insistently, if that’s possible. He lowers his hand away from his head, his burned right hand plunging into his pocket to get the phone. He nearly drops it, his entire body shuddering – adrenaline coursing through him, adrenaline and fear.
Plus, the longer they walk, the more frustrated Steve will become – and Tony is eager to be on the receiving end of a sexually-frustrated Captain America.
Tony shrugs, looking out the window, “I didn’t have a choice. I have to be in Brussels tonight. An EU benefit, and then I have to speak. Dance for our dinner – win a few hearts. Anything I can do to keep the heat off of you guys, and off of – the Avengers. Don’t get it twisted, Steve, this was just sex.” He looks over at Steve and frowns. “That was harsh, I guess. But honest. You don’t have to go right away, though – the apartment – I… Bought it.”
“Tony, listen,” Steve’s fingers gently move to cradle the back of Tony’s head, feeling the bones of his skull shifting beneath his fingertips – and that shouldn’t happen, Steve knows that shouldn’t happen. Tony’s skull has always been solid whenever Steve had run his fingers through the other man’s hair, stubborn – impenetrable. “I have to take you to a hospital.”
By the time he’s returned to the bathroom, Tony’s hair is sopping wet and dripping everywhere – judging by the trail of water from the sink to the toilet, Tony had dunked his head under the faucet.
“I’m going to stop you from killing Howard and Maria Stark,” Steve says simply, resting on a bed that is far too big for one person – before he falls asleep, he can lean over and press his face against Tony’s pillow, and smell his shampoo. But it’s fading.
“C’mon, let’s get dinner. They invented pesto here, you know.” Tony gives him a cheery grin, bumping his shoulder into Steve’s. “They invented pesto, and this is where the Black Death entered Europe. Fitting, no?”
Steve shakes his head slowly, the silver ring burning against his chest like a brand. “I’ve not, Tony. Of course I haven’t. I love you.”
Tony’s sore fingers card through Steve’s thick blonde hair, thumb and forefinger rubbing strands slowly between them – his hair as soft as he had imagined it to be. He had spent countless nights of his life gazing up at his Captain America poster, focusing on the hair just above Steve’s temple, the only bit of it visible with his helmet on. What he would give, just to run his hands through Steve Rogers’ hair, and now… Tony bites down on his bottom lip as Steve starts to kiss along his throat, from one side of his neck to the other, his pulse racing.
“Thanks,” Tony says around the mouth guard as he shoves it into his mouth. “This isn’t a used one, is it?”
Tony might not believe him at first – but he’s already gotten over a big hurdle, that Captain America is sitting on his couch. The idea of him –
“Hey,” Steve murmurs after a pause. “I was thinking. Do you have any preference on where we go next?”
He wants to say something, wants to request a song from Tony, wants to let him know that he’d give anything to hear him play – instead, he stays silent, and hopes.
Tony will say softly after he’s caught his breath, his hand brushing over the broad expanse of Steve’s chest, pausing over the metal of the dog tags and the ring. Slender fingers will trail over his scarred skin, and Steve will imagine a tingle as Tony’s fingers brush over his paralyzed arm.
Steve opens his eyes as Tony shifts to his feet in front of him, unwrapping a few butterfly bandages as he leans in close to Steve’s face to inspect the cut. Tony’s head is tilted to the side, Steve’s eyes are level with his pulse point, and he sees it jumping wildly in his throat. Tony’s touch is gentle as he places the bandages over Steve’s cut, the skin feeling tight as it’s pulled back together.
“So…” Steve says after a pause, another sip of wine – it’s dry, and not entirely pleasant, but he’s never been one for wine. “How’s the kid?”
Tony’s fist lands firmly on the right side of Steve’s face, knuckles a fiery blip of pain, but he feels triumphant satisfaction as Steve’s head whips to the side. Tony’s left hand rises to land another blow, but Steve catches it, his grip tight.
Cold metal trickles from his chest, over his shoulder, down his bicep and across his wrist – finally encasing his hand in a gauntlet. The repulsor hums, a sound he usually finds comforting, but now… Hesitantly, he holds his hand up to his head, closing his eyes against the light.
“Where’d she go? Didn’t Nebula say she died?” Tony reaches up and curls his fingers under the collar of the new suit he’s wearing – red, black, and white. Totally tasteless. But they had been pressed for time on the design front, and all it had to do was protect their bodies from the Quantum Realm. Tony doesn’t allow himself to think about the Quantum Realm for any extended periods of time, he finds it entirely infuriating – how can something exist that defies the laws of physics so arrogantly?
“Shut up and box, Tony,” Steve grins at him, holding his arms up defensively. “You left yourself wide open.”
“You did. Can’t remember when. You were just talking, and talking.” Steve picks up Tony’s empty paper coffee cup and rolls it between his palms. “I love it when you do that.”
Steve follows Tony to the kitchen, taking a seat at the counter as Tony starts to rustle through the fridge. He pulls out the scallops and shrimp Steve had bought that morning, eager for fresh seafood caught less than a mile from their door.
Tony’s fingers card through his hair, tugging sharply. If caffeine won’t jumpstart his brain, perhaps pain will.
When Steve wakes the following morning, squinting against the bright sunlight filtering through the curtains, he expects to hear the apartment’s fire alarms ringing shrilly. Something must be on fire, because the bed is burning up – Steve must be holding a furnace in his arms, the heat of it is incredible. He lifts his head sleepily from the pillow, looking down at Tony where he’s curled up with his back against Steve’s chest. The tan skin of his neck is flushed pink, and Steve leans forward, watching the blush as it spreads over his chest. Tony is breathing shallowly, his eyes screwed tightly shut, and Steve notices sweat beaded on the other man’s forehead.
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve says, bending down to collect the keys. There are two, and he slots the first into the lock blindly, grinning as the door swings open.
“My bathroom, the razor’s in there.” Steve makes his way down the hallway to his bedroom, hearing Tony’s light footsteps as he trails behind him. He’s not as skinny as when Steve had last seen him five years ago, but he’s leaner than before – his biceps are toned from heavy lifting, though, and Steve wants to hear more about the projects that Tony had dedicated five years to. Did anyone ever thank him for his help?
Tony tenses when Steve’s hand passes over the back of his neck, squirming slightly as Steve rubs a cold, slimy substance into his skin.
“Don’t want to be wasteful,” he says through a mouthful of cake, Steve watching his tongue dart out and swipe chocolate icing off of his bottom lip. Tony’s leg brushes against his under the table, the slightest amount of pressure, and Steve can feel the heat of his skin through the fabric of Tony’s trousers and his own jeans. He eats his dessert faster.
It is like living with a ghost. For the first few days, Steve rarely sees Tony in the apartment at all. He knows the other man is there, because sometimes he can hear shuffling in the second bedroom, like Tony is mindlessly pacing from wall to wall.
He continued for quite a while, somehow managing to keep his lips from curving or laughing out loud as Steve watched him with a huge grin on his own face, and kept the lecture going until Clint returned with Bruce, who immediately kicked Tony out, ordering him to get sleep.
Though that could be because he’d had nothing to eat since….dinner the night before? Those blueberries? Fuck it, when the hell had he eaten last? The room swayed and his stomach rumbled loudly at the thought, as if now that it knew it hadn’t been fed in ages, it wouldn’t be satisfied until Tony gave it something.
“Tony.” Rhodey had a really good disappointed face. Unfortunately, Tony was well used to it, and no longer affected. “You should get some sleep.”
Feeling the eyes of those ancestors on him as he dashed around, Tony went straight to the bathroom, searching the medicine cabinet and under the sink, and cursed when it was empty and all he found was a near empty box of band-aids and expired Neosporin.
I have fallen WAY behind in posting/replying to comments and I am so sorry for that! Thank you to anyone who has read this story so far and was kind enough to leave a comment! Sorry I didn't have enough spoons to reply or post for a while, but here is a way-overdue update full of team holiday shenanigans and some angst that I hope you enjoy! :)
“And when it does, we need to be honest, and not hide injuries, or try to brush them off,” Natasha interjected. She also rose from the couch but instead of going to Steve, she walked to Tony, a knowing look in her eyes.
Timing it right, he cut the thrusters, and let them free-fall for a bit while Heather stretched her arm out, reaching for Jasper. The poor guy kept flailing about in the air, but eventually Heather caught on, and the electric pulse Tony sent through her extended to Jasper too.
Not that the god could technically be considered people. Bulging biceps and flowing blond locks aside, the guy just radiated otherworldly power, along with a hint of ozone, and…Pop Tarts? Tony still had to wrap his head around that one. Where the hell the Norse god of lightning found Pop Tarts to snack on during an alien invasion and battle was beyond him. But he had to admit, the sugar filled treat didn’t sound too bad right now.
Oh. That was good, that was okay. No need to worry about Steve, he and Barton could take care of themselves. And he hadn’t heard from Pepper in a while. Unless….shit, did she hear about the Twitter page? He was going to wring Darcy’s neck. Picking up his phone, he sad, “Go ahead and let her through. Thanks, J.”
They’d only received postcards from Natasha and Clint. Tony knew they had gone straight back to Shield after Steve’s revelations, to dig in deep where they could, and see what they could determine on their own, and Fury was apparently keeping them busy on missions. All he could do now was wait. Wherever they were, whatever they were doing, Tony knew in his heart they would make their way back to the team eventually.
“Nat, I’m so sorry, but I need Tony for a minute. The Clarksons are here and making noise about cancelling the merger, I need Tony to talk them out of it, for some reason they like it when he babbles and charms them endlessly….”
“Hey!” Tony shouted, pulling at his zip ties, causing the bedframe to rattle and make a ruckus.. “Heeeeeeeey!”
“Deal!” Keeping hold of Natasha, Clint grabbed Thor as well. “Be back in a flash! Come on, Thor, we’ll show you around.”
Panting, wiping his nose because the bastard had managed to get a hit in, Tony lifted the gun and pointed it back at the first guy. Clutching his arm to his chest, he whimpered and said, “You know what? Go ahead and walk out the door. I don’t even care. They are so weird here.”
had been the one to rip that distressed sound out of his throat) would surely haunt Tony’s nightmares for years. It broke something in him, shattered something he hadn’t realized was fully put together. As he watched the misery that crossed Steve’s face, another little piece exploded to smithereens at the knowledge that he’d so callously hurt the man that he loved.
Steve’s frown, already so full of scowling he resembled Oscar the Grouch, somehow deepened. “That’s the thing. I thought he got away with the scepter, too, but when I woke up, it was right next to me. I gave it to Natasha while I came to find you two.”
was, Tony busied himself with making the coffee, then strolled over to glance out the window with Steve while it brewed. Dark, empty night stared back at him, and heavy clouds hung in the air, according to the weather info JARVIS displayed on the window pane to the right. “Ugh, it’s gross out there. It’s gonna rain soon, I know it. Dammit.”
early, but early for him. Steve’s surely been awake for hours now, as per usual, nothing strange. He goes on a hunt for his husband, and even more importantly, a cup of coffee.
“It’s kinda stupid really,” Tony says with a deep breath, and once again Steve can somehow vividly imagine him pacing across maybe an office or a lab somewhere or maybe even his bedroom, “And I hope I’m not out of line or interrupting important future president business of any kind. But I was curious how Oregon went.”
But the thing is, Steve kinda wants to. Hell, going back is all Steve thinks about. Even just trying it out, dipping his toes in the water. Something, anything. He thirsts for it, misses every piece of Tony, every day.
The weird thing is, Steve doesn’t actually say anything as he walks Tony out of the building. No conversation, not a single platitude. Just general, amiable silence. And Tony just- he just sits in it, lets it build around him like a brick wall. It’s weird.
He has a couple more stops he wants to add to the already jam-packed schedule for the next day. He crunched the numbers himself, did the research himself, and he’s audibly excited at the prospect of working himself into the ground.
Steve smells of gunpowder, lead, blood – Tony’s head is swimming. Steve’s tongue brushes over the cut on his lip and Tony’s fingers dig into the muscles of his shoulders, nails leaving half-moons behind. When Steve breaks the kiss, Tony actually whines – and he blushes brightly in mortification.
Tony grins over his shoulder at him, brown eyes lit up with moonlight. “No, not really. But I need to walk it off, like I said. And I love Paris. Plus, I’ve got you here with me, no one’s gonna mug me when I’ve got a previously-blonde Hulk by my side.”
“I can take care of myself,” Tony repeats, his voice lowering, words laced with rage. “I don’t need Captain America telling me that it’s nap-time, believe me.” He steps into the huge sitting room, eyes passing over the grand piano, briefly taking in the scene of the ocean through the expansive walls of glass at the back of the room – this is eerily similar to Malibu.
– being a super hero – that will be the hardest thing for him to come to terms with. But then… Tony will lean forward on the couch, and press his lips gently to the scar his gloved fist had left just at the edge Steve’s eyebrow, tracing the risen line down to his cheek. It’s faded with age – but Tony had been right – butterfly bandages were not as good as stitches.
Steve crosses his arms over his chest, leaning away from the table, and Tony can tell that he’s angry.
right. So am I wrong, is that what you’re trying to tell me? Am I wrong for wanting to keep the Avengers together? Because this is the only way we keep the Avengers together, I’m not exaggerating. This is the beginning of something much bigger than us – and your stupid inability to let me be right, for once!”
Tony’s fist slips off the side of the bag, thrown off by the sudden appearance of Steve Rogers just behind him. He whirls around, crossing his arms over his chest, trying to ignore how stupid he feels in these clunky boxing gloves.
“Captain Rogers?” The door to the waiting room opens, and there’s a young doctor standing in the doorway – Steve sees a hint of Tony’s natural confidence in him.
“Yup. I think the number is closer to fifteen. All because of my parents – all because I thought my dad… killed the both of them by being drunker than ever. His BAC had been off the charts. I never dug into it… Always believed what I was told… Thought the autopsy photos would tear me apart – they probably would, too. So, Dad drove drunk, Mom died and he died, too – and I was left alone. I give money every year to a fund for children who lost their parents due to drunk driving. I rail against it whenever I have the opportunity to in the press. And he probably wasn’t even drunk.” His laughter is raspy, and he regrets laughing at all because his lungs flare with pain. “Christ.”
, get married. But not in this reality, Cap.” He rests his hands on his hips, drumming up confidence from somewhere Steve would never be able to find, considering he’s completely naked.
“December is shot for me,” Tony replies unhappily, “I’ll spend Christmas alone because otherwise it’ll attract attention. Any time after – I’ll let you pick the place again. This time I’ll stay for longer than an hour.” He wipes his fingers clean, returning to one of the open windows, gazing down at the street below. The music is louder, and he leans forward, wishing it were his fingers on the keys of the piano.
Tony climbs the steps to the apartment, leaning against the half-wall that surrounded the stoop. He swallows and rubs his hand through his hair as Steve takes off down the road. He is jumpy, it’s true – because his lack of sleep has given him a crazy idea, one that he’s afraid to ask Steve for permission to complete.
“I trust your taste, Tony,” Steve says as he lifts up the glass, breathing in before taking a sip. Tony’s eyes darken slightly as he watches Steve’s throat bob, his fingers digging into the meat of his thigh.
“Did you get any sleep?” Steve asks softly, knowing that Tony might get angry at him for asking – he usually did.
Steve looks away from him suddenly, a muscle jumping in his jaw, watching a few tables over as a couple feeds each other oysters.
He takes a large gulp of wine to steel himself, because as Steve approaches him, he starts to think (again) that this is a mistake.
Maybe Tony will wear the ring that’s now resting against Steve’s chest, the world around him disappearing in a flash of light. Maybe he won’t, and that’s fine. But this time, Steve will find Tony, do right by him, and love him – if Tony lets him. He wishes he had done that from the start, but Steve has a second chance. He’ll see Tony again – very soon.
“Tony?” Unlike the call in the hospital, Steve’s voice is crisp, deep, and Tony hates the rush of desire that moves through his body all the way down to his toes. At least there’s fear, there, too – and out of the corner of his eye he can see Steve’s hand clenched into a fist.
Steve laughs, setting his duffel bag down on the bed – Tony had arrived the night before, and had already made a mess of it. He straightens one of the pillows idly, looking over at where Tony’s standing at the balcony with his back to him. Steve carefully reaches into his pocket and slides the ring box under the pillow.
He holds the package down by his side, looking over at Rhodey casually. “I’m gonna go into the office. Are you good out here?”
“Thanks,” Tony says quietly, pocketing them clumsily, frowning down at his hands. “Busted my hands on your thick skull. Did the serum replace your bones with metal, or something?”
The pen, his father’s pen, strikes him dead between the eyes. Tony’s eyes water instantly, reaching up to feel his skin, the welt rising up on his forehead.
Tony catches her hand before she can pull it away, kissing the back of it. “Okay. Go get ‘em, boss.”
“Schmidt,” Tony corrects himself obediently, though it’s not nearly as impressive. “He said she was dead. I don’t think he’s lying. Nebula didn’t think so either.”
“No one is listening to us, Steve,” Tony snorts, nudging his silverware in an attempt to keep his hands occupied. “If we were speaking French, that would be another story – but I picked this place because I knew we wouldn’t be… Recognized, or interrupted. Anyways, Ross won’t be making another appearance, at least, not without my invitation. He caught me off guard, otherwise I wouldn’t have been so easy to strangle.”
Steve grunts as Tony shoves him away, bumping into the ropes behind him, and his expression is a mixture of disappointment and confusion.
“Hey, look. Look at me, Steve.” Tony meets his gaze when the other man is finally able to lift his head to look at him. Gently, he runs the fingers of his right hand through soft blonde hair, taking his time.
“Tony,” Steve mumbles, rubbing his face with his hands. “Tony, sweetheart, we’re not here for soil.”
“Remember Paris?” He asks Steve suddenly, his voice light. “I know you do, we had great times there. Great food, great music. But that first morning, in Paris, remember? That music from the jazz club, and you made me dance with you in my underwear?”
“It is a birthday present, in a way.” Steve’s lips are against his, and Tony’s not sure if he wants to punch the grin off the other man’s face, or kiss him til it fades. “One of many parts. You up for part three?”
“Don’t mention her!” Tony’s face contorts with rage, Steve has never seen him this livid in his life – though he can tell that Tony is suffering from a terrible hangover, and he wishes the other man had taken his advice and gone to bed. “She was an innocent. She had nothing to do with my father’s work. You’re telling me Barnes was given an order to kill them both? He killed her first, and he made my dad watch!”
Still distracted by thoughts of Steve’s hands on his body, Tony almost finds himself shaving off half of his goatee, managing a quick flick of his wrist to avoid complete and utter disaster. He throws on one of his favorite suits, a grey three piece by Tom Ford, and fumbles with shaking hands tying his tie.
The cottage is cozy – there’s a small sitting room with two armchairs, no television, though. The burning wood in the fireplace crackles, which is far too perfect – everything about the place seems perfect. The door to the bathroom is open, which is great, should Tony need to run inside to vomit into the toilet. The door to the one bedroom, however, is closed.
“Steve,” Pepper says quietly, getting to her feet, her hand brushing down his forearm. “It’s good you’re here. He’s been asking for you.”
“When did you get here?” Tony’s voice is sharp as he follows Steve up to the door, his hands deep in his pockets. One tap of a finger to the screen of the smart-watch on his wrist, and he would have a gauntlet – with enough power to blast Steve’s head off.
“I think –…” Tony’s voice is muffled against Steve’s chest as he carries him to his motorcycle. He doesn’t cry out when Steve settles him in front of him on the seat, instead, he slumps forward over the handlebars, his blood dripping on the pavement.
“Are you trying to hack the compound’s cameras right now?” Tony asks, a manic laugh echoing into the phone as he sways forward again. “Jesus, Steve, really? There’s no way you’d get through – you don’t even know how to use Google.”
It’s something so simple, and intimate – and dangerous. Whenever someone looks at Steve for a moment too long as they walk down the narrow streets, Tony gets anxious, imagining a SWAT team armed to the teeth riddling Steve’s body with bullets.
There’s a sharp pain in his chest, just under his sternum, and Tony’s hand clenches into a fist on his knee. Peggy Carter, the woman who always slipped him a chocolate bar when his mother wasn’t looking, is dead – and he is unable to attend her funeral, because he is sat at this goddamn table in Vienna, supporting a set of laws that he’s both proud of and ashamed of.
“I don’t hate you,” Tony says breathlessly against his lips, “God, I really don’t. Don’t ever do that again.”
His world is hazy now, they must’ve given him the good stuff, because there are lights, and copper strands of hair, and worried green eyes – freckles, endless freckles. He had sworn to her, as she giggled breathlessly beneath him, that he would count every freckle on her body. He’d gotten somewhere close to 600 before getting distracted – and would never have the ability to count them again.
“How long of a walk is this?” Steve can’t help but ask as Tony turns him down another winding street, though he’s slowly untucking Tony’s shirt from his trousers as they walk.
“Let’s get you inside, sweetheart,” Pepper murmurs, her tears dripping off of Quill’s red jacket. Tony had become increasingly cold on the Benatar, as his body had withered away, leaving him as skin and bones. He swims in the jacket even now, and he’s shivering – though he’s not sure if it’s from the cold or from the adrenaline.
“Steve.” Tony says in utter exasperation, pushing himself off of him. Steve watches as he climbs out of bed on unsteady legs, staggering into the bedside table before he rights himself. “Steve, you’re a
“Steve,” Pepper is at his side at the doorway, and Tony can tell by the way her eyebrows knit together that she’s upset – angry, even. “I really think – you heard what Bruce said. Tony needs rest.”
Once Tony has finished eating, he gathers the plates and moves to the sink. He takes his time washing them, scrubbing intently, brown eyes focused. Eventually, Steve moves to his side, pulling Tony’s red hands out from under the scalding water.
“I’m not Captain America. I’m Tony Stark. In the future, the world will rally at the battle cry of Captain America. They won’t do that for Tony Stark. It’s simple, I die, you get the Stone. You go back home, you all use the Infinity Stones to get everyone back – life moves on. You have to trust me, this is the only way.”
The question catches Tony off guard, it seems too personal. “You mean, how long did you put me in the hospital for, Cap?”
Tony squirms in his seat, he needs more wine before they have this conversation. Clearing his throat, he reaches for the final oyster.
Tony closes his eyes, resting back against Steve, bending his legs so Steve’s can fit behind his. Steve is wearing sweatpants and a shirt, thank God, or Tony would explode. One large hand rests over his reactor protectively, and Steve’s breath stirs the graying hair above his ear.
“Is that you being romantic again?” Steve reaches out with his right hand, pushing the brown bag open so he can grab a warm pastry. “Jesus, Tony, did you buy thirty?”
“I’m not gonna beat you up, Tony.” Steve is already walking towards the locker room. “You can wear some headgear, if that’ll make you feel better.”
Steve sinks down onto the bottom step, his knees going weak. “Tony, the bike ran fine. It ran fine.”
“I’m not killing you.” Steve says sharply, his face contorting – fury, anguish, determination. It transforms so fast that Tony only catches each emotion fleetingly. “I’m
He straddles the motorcycle, reaching up to brush a droplet of Tony’s blood off of the shimmering silver of the handlebar.
Steve says nothing, just stares at him solemnly – and Tony sees hurt in the depths of Steve’s blue eyes. Not pain from the punch, but hurt.
Tony shifts in his seat, running his fingers through his hair, feeling as though he had just trodden on a landmine. It’s about to blow up, and he doesn’t have the time to reach down and deactivate it.
“It’s gonna be okay, okay? Just help me –…” Tony grits his teeth together, aching body crying out as he struggles to sit upright. “Help me sit up, and then… I’ll fill it with nanites. I’ll be good as new, I promise.”
“This’ll do,” Tony mutters to himself, opening up a cabinet and pulling out a box of pasta. He frowns, shaking it. “It would be better fresh.”
If Steve is surprised to hear that Tony knows exactly where the ex-Avengers are hiding out, he doesn’t show it. Instead, he reaches up and brushes his fingers through his dark hair, it’s long enough now that he’s slicked it back with something. Tony’s fingers twitch against his thigh – if it’s not as blonde anymore, at least it will still be soft, right?
“I did it because you’re an idiot!” Tony seethes, kicking Steve’s stupid red boxing gloves across the ring as they fall to the floor. “You’ve always been – in the way! All my dad ever fucking talked about was you, how great you were. How strong Captain America was, how brave, how polite, how fucking handsome. How could I not fall in love with Captain America, right? Even the idealized picture my dad painted. You know how many muscular blonde guys I took home with me in my whole life? You know how many of ‘em would call themselves Steve if I asked?”
Tony looks down between them, his thumb brushing over Steve’s hip slowly, eyes widening. “Jesus, has it always been that big?”
But not as terrible as Steve’s eyes, so dark that he could hardly make out the blue. Not as terrible as the thin line of Steve’s lips, pressed together so tightly they were almost blanched white. Not as terrible as the glint of Siberia’s bright white, snowy light catching on the front of Steve’s shield – its surface scoured with burn marks, scratches, Tony’s own blood. Steve had wrenched the helmet off of his head effortlessly, and Tony had stared up into his eyes, paralyzed. How could this be the very same man who had said his name so lowly, his lips brushing down Tony’s neck, across his shoulders, down his chest?
“We probably have – a mile to go? I don’t know, I sort of strolled – I wasn’t paying attention to distance.”
“We have to get them back, Steve.” Tony steps in closer to him, wrapping an arm around his waist. “I have to – Peter needs to come back. He needs to live. I can’t keep living when he’s not, it’s not fair. And if it takes me dying for you to bring him back, bring everybody back...” Tony shrugs, “My life’s not worth that much. It almost feels like a good deal, like I’m ripping off fate.”
Steve plugs the razor in, opening the small case that comes with it and nudging it over to Tony. “What guard do you… you want?” His eyes are fixed on the terrible scar on Tony’s abdomen, and Tony flushes, looking intently at the options.
And yet, Steve’s bright blue eyes are earnest, and aside from his arms crossed over his chest, his body language is mostly open.
“Mom was Italian,” Tony replies, shaking his head at Steve. “Of course I know how to make pasta. It’s a cakewalk.”
“Mr. Stark?” The sedative wielding nurse is back, though she’s holding a phone instead of a syringe. “How are you feeling?” She doesn’t wait for his response. “Usually, I wouldn’t allow phone calls, but the man on the other end says it’s urgent.”
“Your teeth are chattering, Tony,” Steve sounds relieved. “You should go inside. Anyways, we’d race in and out of the apartment – the snowman would melt a little more every time we went inside. Snow never stuck around for long in my neighborhood – and eventually, some punk would kick my snowman over, but we’d always make another.”
“Yeah, we did,” Tony snaps, glaring at Steve so hotly that Steve can feel his anger burning through the dark lenses of his sunglasses. “Silly old me, must have slipped my mind. You know what? I think I’m too busy to meet with you today. Way too busy. Maybe if I had the rest of my
Steve says nothing, though his hands are clasped so tightly together that he wonders if he’s fracturing his own metacarpals.
Steve’s white mouth guard, now pink with blood and spit, flies out of his mouth and lands on the mat. He shoves Tony away with all of his strength, sending the other man flying into the ropes on the other side of the ring.
“Tony,” Pepper shifts at his bedside as he slings his arm over her shoulders. “Tony, honey, you’re – you need your rest. Please, let Steve have his debrief without you.”
“I — Well, no promises. If I do get a decent night’s sleep, I very well might snore like… terribly.” Snoring is better than screaming, though, and if Tony wakes without a sore throat, it will be a miracle.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony decides, opening the door. “I think I’m just having an existential crisis due to my continuing age.”
“What are you talking about? This is how I sleep.” Tony grumbles, turning to look at Steve in the darkness, just able to make out his profile if he squints.
Steve sighs, passing the razor over the back of his head one more time, wanting to make sure it’s even. He had cut the hair on the sides shorter than the hair on the top of Tony’s head, which he was proud of – usually when he cut his own hair, he buzzed it all down to the same length for simplicity’s sake.
“You know how many times I was the keynote speaker at drunk driving seminars?” Tony’s words are slurred, but understandable. “You know, Pepper – I know you know.”
“A little worse for wear. I wish he’d told me. And I’m worried that he did, and I don’t think I was listening to him.” Tony shakes his head. “Just goes to show that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”
Steve eventually leaves the ring, once his legs don’t feel so wobbly. He walks into the locker room, sitting down on one of the benches so that he can unwrap his hands. He’s still bleeding, he can feel it trickling warmly down the side of his face, and he shakes his head with a befuddled smile. Tony had swung at him with his full force, and he had packed quite a punch – and then… His fingers touch his lips, closing his eyes for a moment. Tony had kissed him, kissed him hard – but only for a few moments, a few perfect moments, and then he had left Steve standing alone in the ring like an idiot.
Tony’s eyes widen, and he reaches up to take off his sunglasses, turning to look at Steve in utter disbelief.
“Welcome, Anthony, son of Maria. And…” Tony’s fist strikes Steve’s bicep, jumping out of his skin as the cloaked figure appears before them.
On the opposite side of the world, Steve listens as Tony’s breathing deepens – indescribably thankful for his nightmare that had urged him to call Tony in the first place.
“What the hell are you thinking?!” Steve’s hands are on his shoulders, shaking forcefully. His face is drawn, eyes wide, teeth grit together. “You could have fallen.”
He waits for hours in a tiny waiting room, flipping through an ancient, stained magazine. Tony is featured in it – and Steve catches himself glancing down at the picture of him from time to time as he waits. Tony, ever so suave, leaning up against the door to his office at Stark Industries with his arms crossed over his chest. The light of the reactor is just visible through his fitted suit, and he’s got a smirk on his face. Steve’s fingers trail over the image gently, remembering how the bones of Tony’s skull had shifted pliantly at his touch. A baseball bat. He closes the magazine fast enough that he gives himself a paper cut, and the sting makes his eyes water. That, and the way Tony had slumped over the handlebars like a corpse, his blood soaking through Steve’s shirt.
“I don’t want you to turn yourself in,” Tony continues, pushing his suitcase over to one of the many bedrooms. He peers inside, judging the size of the bed – it will do. “Because then I would worry about you.”
“Can you blame me?” Steve sits up, the sheets pooling around his waist. He moves over to Tony, pressing his lips over the bite mark. Tony leans back against him, sighing as Steve’s hand brushes over his chest, moving through the small patch of hair to the rough, risen skin of his arc reactor scar.
Tony nips the inside of his thigh, and then his kisses start to stray higher as Steve picks up the phone.
“Steve, you need rest,” her voice lowers, an effort to be soothing – but Steve isn’t the Hulk, and he needs to see Tony.
Tony frowns at the blinking exclamation point at the top of the screen, squinting at it. He thinks it’s an exclamation point, anyways, hard to tell with the complete lack of clarity the screen has –
Tony turns to face him, leans up on his tiptoes, and presses a soft kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Thank you,” he murmurs, before pulling away and slipping out of the bathroom.
Steve chuckles, not because Tony’s particular line of thinking is funny, but because Tony is spilling out a stream of consciousness – and because Tony is no longer on the roof.
“I can’t miss this meeting,” Tony murmurs, his lips brushing over the curve of Steve’s jaw, feeling the faintest scratch of stubble.
“Hear that, Tony?” Steve looks into Tony’s eyes, though the intensity has faded to a hazy sort of inattention. “Pepper will be here.” Steve glances down as Tony’s fingers play with the sleeve of his jacket, tugging at the fabric.
Tony pulls his fingers away from Steve’s hand, his jaw set, knife slipping up under Sam’s ties and cutting them.
Tony’s eyes close at the kiss, and his fingers fall away from Steve’s sleeve. Steve gently pulls away, expecting to see unfocused brown eyes staring up at him in hatred – but Tony has fallen asleep.
“There’s an address in the envelope – you’ll have to cut it open, I slipped it between the padding. Meet me there, Tony. We can talk.”
Just as Steve puts away the final bowl, Tony’s fingers begin to dance along the keys. It’s Bach, Steve thinks, or Vivaldi. Quietly, he moves into the sitting room and takes a seat on the couch, content with listening to Tony play as dusk gives way to stars outside.
“I’m not going to lie, it was touch and go there for a bit – he had a pretty nasty skull fracture, but we’ve put in a plate… Lots of internal lacerations, do you, uh, happen to know what they used as a weapon?”
“I guess I have some explaining to do,” Tony starts off, reaching for his cup of water and taking a long gulp. “I owe you that.”
“I said…” Steve’s fingers slip away from Tony’s hair, down his neck, dog tags jingling as he plays with them idly. “Marry me.”
Tony lapses into silence, his eyebrows furrowed, eyes narrowed as he concentrates. Steve stays silent, not wanting to interrupt Tony as he thinks – he can picture a file cabinet in Tony’s brain, filled to the brim with yellowed recipe cards, the neat script of Maria Stark flowing over them.
“But I’m his —.” Steve stops himself suddenly, he’s nothing to Tony. He could have been his husband, if the other man had allowed himself to be loved. If he had allowed himself to keep living.
“You want me to pity him?” Tony shakes his head, still looking out at the waves. “You want me to pity him, and you want me to forgive you. It’s too much. You ask too much.”
Tony sobers up enough to sit through a five hour furious debrief with Secretary Ross on New Year’s Eve, and by the time he makes it to the airport that night, he’s ready to phone up Steve and call the whole thing off. Hell, he’s ready to tell Ross that Steve and the ex-Avengers are hiding out in Wakanda, because
“I do,” Steve blushes, looking away. “I – Well, Tony, I came here to spend time with you. I wasn’t just going to sit inside and watch television when I could sit out here with you.”
Tony is awake, and his head turns slowly towards the foot of the bed where Steve stands. He’s not as small and gaunt as when he had returned from Titan, Steve can see strength in the muscles of his arms as he shifts on the bed – but he looks exhausted. Steve rubs his foot gently through the blanket, hand trailing up Tony’s leg as he moves to stand directly beside him. He pulls his hand away at Tony’s hip, recalling his internal injuries. A thick white liquid drips slowly in Tony’s IV, and Steve hopes Tony doesn’t feel any pain.
Tony’s pulse races, arousal and panic – he needs to get out, now, needs to get away. His fist strikes Steve on the ear, Steve’s hand pulling away, his teeth biting sharply at Tony’s bottom lip in surprise.
“So that’s it, then,” Tony says quietly, staring more intently at the IV in his hand. “That’s it. They’re dead – all of them.”
He’s technically homeless now – each week he’s in a new hotel, getting a very in depth tour of what lower Manhattan had to offer. The tower – Stark Tower, Avengers Tower, whatever you wanted to call it – is off limits. Not that he’s angry about that, though his brown eyes are dark as his fists fly. No, Pepper needed a place to live – and they were broken up, weren’t they, so he couldn’t exactly sleep in the bedroom next to theirs – hers. Maybe he can spend the night here – Tony laughs breathlessly, bitterly. Even here, at the Avengers compound, he’s an outsider. Just the purveyor of goods and services, the guy who stopped by to upgrade everyone’s tech – or the guy who stopped by to issue a warning.
He pulls his sunglasses out of the breast pocket of his jacket, sliding them over his face, guarding his still watering eyes.
Tony looks to Steve, and then jumps again when the cloaked figure – Schmidt, apparently – removes its hood. “Aw, Christ, that’s horrific. What’d you do, melt all your skin off in a nuclear… Wait…” Tony laughs, can this get any more bizarre? “I read comics about you, man, Red Skull?”
“One minute,” Tony pulls away from her, hurrying over to where his suitcase is sloppily thrown open across the bed. He unzips one of the suitcase’s compartments, pulling out what looks to be a smart-watch. One quick tap to the watch-face would provide him with a gauntlet – not much, but better than nothing.
“When in Paris,” Tony murmurs breathlessly, his hands slipping down over Steve’s broad shoulders, nearly knocking his duffel bag off of his arm. “Christ, Steve, hurry up. I feel like an idiot.” He grasps at Steve’s biceps feeling the hard muscle beneath the leather of his jacket, and he’s carrying Tony up the stairs like he weighs nothing. Finally, he remembers. “Third floor. 302. God, Steve,” he grinds against him, breathless, his fingers trying to dig into the leather. “Hurry up.”
The pasta is incredible, even if it isn’t fresh, and Steve helps himself to seconds while Tony makes his way through his first.
“Mr. Stark,” the nurse says cheerily, “I have your discharge papers – but first, you need to get out of bed!”
