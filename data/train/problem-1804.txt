John shows Sherlock how to weigh and measure the flour, what temperature the water should be. He wraps his short fingers around Sherlock’s, their wrists lined up, and helps him gently sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water. Sherlock’s eyes light up with the excitement of a child discovering something wholly new when they add the sugar and the yeast blooms.
John closes his hand around Sherlock’s achingly hard cock and strokes him gently, rubbing his thumb in a circle around the head and then firmly against his frenulum, tracing the edge of his foreskin. Sherlock exhales tremulously and thrusts his hips up into John’s fist.
John’s good at sex. Not just the physical mechanics of it, though he knows he's good at that, too. He's good at the banter, the seduction, the sleepy soft afterward - all gentle fingers and tender kisses. Sex has always been intuitive to him in a way he knows that it isn’t to a lot of other people. His natural confidence in this space surges up in him, making him feel more himself than he has in years. He sets his mug on the table and picks up the Boots bag. "I was hoping you'd say that. Come on then, beautiful."
"I, uh, accidentally hit the button. Left it open in my pocket. It's off now." His voice is shaking. He should never have come here. No one will even hear what Jim has to say, and he's fucked, he's so fucked. He can think of nothing suddenly except John standing alone in the kitchen reading his note. John forever alone, because Sherlock is so monumentally stupid that he believed for a moment that he could outwit Jim Moriarty, and now he's trapped. Jim is more than capable of killing him right here and now.
“Are you joking? I can barely stand.” Sherlock huffs a laugh, rocks his forehead against John’s. “Nothing ambiguous about
Sherlock nods at the table and John understands, sets the paper cup down and settles in his own chair. "So, tell me about the case."
Sherlock looks down onto the square in the middle of the housing estate. The children are beginning to drift inside, pipes and balls left carelessly on the concrete. The parents are saying their goodnights, smoking their last cigarettes. Everyone here so lost and listless, by the time they’re five they’ve given up on having anything better. When Sherlock was five, his mother told him he could be Prime Minister if he wanted. That he was brilliant, beautiful. Her perfect little cherub. She brushed his black curls with a horsehair brush and kissed him on the forehead before he went to school. Mycroft read to him, books about physics and chemistry, curled on the floor with Redbeard at their feet, cosy by the grand marble fireplace that always seemed too large for the rest of the house. His father ruffled his hair, told Sherlock he was smarter at five than his old dad could ever hope to be.
“Door still locked?” John murmurs under his breath, his eyes alert and his body taut, ready to fight.
from?” It should sound rude, but it doesn’t. It sounds awestruck, which is exactly how Sherlock feels.
The cabbie swung his head up from his phone, where he’d been thumbing in text, and his dull eyes flicked to the cigarette in John’s hand. “Yeah, but you can’t smoke in cabs no more, man.”
He hurries to catch up with him, falls in stride. John won’t look at him, eyes resolutely fixed ahead. “I’m sorry.”
“I know that.” Sherlock’s hand falls into John’s hair as he shimmies down between his legs and noses at the crease of his thigh.
Lily’s just begun telling the story of her father’s latest successful capture of wizard wanted for experimentation on Muggles, when the train lurches suddenly into motion.
Sherlock reaches up with exploring fingers, the expression on his face rapt and glowing. "May I? Go look at it?"
Without even considering it, John had obeyed, wriggling into the scant space beside Sherlock and gathering him up into his arms. Sherlock had sighed and rubbed his face against John’s jumper and fallen back asleep almost immediately. John had lain awake for hours, not knowing what to do with himself, only bursting with wonder at finally, just
.” Sherlock grins, his eyes still closed, and slaps John’s hip playfully. “Barely ten minutes I think.”
John somehow manages to turn his head slowly to look over at Sherlock, his chest heaving, red lines from John's fingernails striated across his pale skin, little half moons from where he'd dug in and held on for dear life, tooth marks and bruises welling up on his neck and his arms. There's come dried across his stomach, his hair is a riot of tangles with pulled out strands laying curved against the hollows of his throat. He looks like a crime scene.
things we have to discuss. Things you don’t know about me, that don’t even have to do with what’s been going on since you left. Just, things every partner should know about each other, and the same for you. I don’t know -
“No, it’s fine, it’s fine.” He whispers, not even knowing what he’s saying, hardly able to believe that she’s real.
Inside is less perfect, a bit shabby and worn. The floorboards have splinters, and the kitchen door doesn't close all the way. The kitchen is a relic, a mint green Rayburn oven and a white enamel ice box alongside butcher block counters stained with half a century of overflowing bowls and scalding pot bottoms. Sherlock has an immediate image of John bare chested in his dressing gown making breakfast, his bare feet slapping gently against the cracked linoleum floor.  Something tight unfurls in Sherlock's chest.
"Parcel came. From Aileen Watson to you. Who is she?" Sherlock sat back, eyebrow raised questioningly.
Mrs Hudson looked just the same as she ever had, hair perfectly coiffed, makeup completely done first thing in the morning. She put her hand over her heart. “I knew, that you both were back, I mean Sherlock had rung and I could hear you upstairs, yesterday. I wanted so badly to come up, but I knew. Knew you needed your time. It does my heart good to see you, though, John Watson. Even if you look an absolute fright."
in the mornings. Look at you.” John rolls, taking Sherlock with him until Sherlock ends up on his back, John lying on his right side beside him. He inches up until he’s looking down into Sherlock’s face. “Soft and mussed and puffy-eyed and so
Sherlock shrinks against the headboard, feeling vulnerable and exposed. John just stares at him, unwavering. He’s waiting for Sherlock to say something.
“Ah, you beautiful thing, Jesus,” John choked out in a brogue that shouldn’t have sounded natural, but did. John buried his face in Sherlock’s neck, lips dragging, tasting along the hollow of his collarbone.
"What a good boy. Look how well you're behaving already." John coos at him, watching Sherlock's neck redden, his lips part. "It's alright, you can come here to me."
I paid the driver and gathered my bags. In my eagerness to get upstairs, I fumbled my key and bumped my head against the door as I bent to retrieve it. I was cursing under my breath as I
“You all know Sherlock Holmes,” Rose smiles up at him encouragingly. She knows how he loathes making small talk, pretending to be sociable.
"You wanted me to come home and touch you like this. Right on the sofa, yeah?" John curls his fingers, kneads gently, Sherlock's bollocks heavy and full in his palm, the heat between his legs making John's mind go slightly foggy.
John brushes Sherlock's hair out of his eyes, kisses his eyelids and then his mouth, put his lips to Sherlock's ear and whispers, "When you least expect it."
Abruptly, John’s weight lifts as he throws the covers back, assaulting Sherlock with a blast of chilly air and startling him out of his contemplations. John’s blonde head emerges, face red and covered in beads of perspiration. His moustache is drooping.
They fall into step together crossing Monmouth Street, and as they merge into the mass of bodies on Shaftesbury Avenue, Sherlock slips his arm around John’s waist. John leans into him and sighs, swallowing down an unexpected lump in his throat.
“Alright.” He didn’t know what else to say. He was so inadequate to this task. John was the comforter, the quiet voice in the night, the steady hand in frightening places.
"Alright." John's leg is jiggling in nervous anticipation. This calm dread is almost worse than the shouting row of last week.
The metallic clatter of a skip lid being thrown open in the alley shatters the silence, and John jerks as though he’s been kicked. He brushes Sherlock’s fringe back from his forehead and plants a kiss between his eyebrows.
“Well.” Sherlock grins; John can feel it against his thigh, the happy little wiggle of his head, and suddenly John can’t believe he was ever embarrassed even for a second to have this beautiful, perfect creature do whatever he wanted to him. “I think it was kind of, leftover. From being at work. When I told you to shut up, you blushed. I swore for a second you were going to salute me. It was devastatingly sensual.”
Sherlock chuckles quietly, shifts in his seat until he's facing away from John and looking at the unlit fireplace, the focus of the first "Be my good boy, Sherlock." The moment everything changed for them. Again. So many incarnations of who they are together - strangers, colleagues, friends, best friends, lovers, husbands - and they're still here, trying to make it right. It strikes John how few people get to experience love like this, the kind that's fire tested, that's truly unconditional. He swallows away the lump in his throat, puts a reassuring hand on the perfect curve of Sherlock's spine.
The rest of the early afternoon passes uneventfully. Albus, Hugo, and Lily play Exploding Snap and compare Famous Witch and Wizard Card collections, while John snores quietly beside Sherlock. Rose and Sherlock both eventually pull out textbooks to study a bit, and before long, it’s 1pm and the Honeydukes trolley is pulling up outside their compartment.
The fire had burned lower and the small stack of wood beside the grate was significantly lessened. John was sitting across from him, his hair damp and ruffled. He was licking his fingers. He peered up at Sherlock and laughed at the Prince’s confusion.
Next, Dot went up. She'd been crying but she held her head high. She too was blessed with a clean snap. Her twin, Mot, wasn't so lucky.
Molly let out a breathy sigh, panting, flushed, and limp with the aftermath of pleasure. She wriggled in the bed sheets and groaned as Greg popped up from under the blankets. His chin was slopped with saliva and her own slick and he gave her a saucy wink.
The sub looked up at him, making eye contact as he slid down to the root and up to the tip over and over and over. John smiled down at him and scratched his fingers through his hair. He knew how much Sherlock liked his head touched. When John was good and hard, Sherlock pulled off and rubbed his jaw. “More, Captain?” He murmured. His face was pink and a trail of saliva glistened on his lip and John’s cock jerked.
“Aw. It’ll feel better tomorrow.” John hugged him close. Tomorrow would be a day for spoiling his boy. He couldn’t help it. After punishments he was such a softy, something he was sure Sherlock would detect and take full advantage of. He was looking forward to it.
King Holmes had been traveling to Hibern often over the last few years and she had struck up a sort of something with Greg Lestrade, the handsome Head of the Royal Guard. He was sweet and kind and a little awkward, stroking the back of his head when he asked her for something in bed and going flushed when he saw her naked. When he wasn’t on duty protecting King Holmes, they spent as much time as possible together. Often they had sex but sometimes they would simply share a meal or go for a walk if the weather was nice.
about stars?) and opened the book at random. The spread pages contained a brown and green moldering deer skull. Mushrooms sprouted out of an eye socket and streams of orange fungus spread across the dying grass below. Sherlock went very still, his mouth half open in awe as he took in the details of the image. Mike watched him, pleased, before quietly asking,
Sherlock woke up the next morning, warm and covered with blankets. The mattress beside him shifted. It sounded like a book was put down on the side table and the blanket was lifted off his legs. Warm familiar hands stroked down his thighs, spreading his legs. “More?” He muttered into the cotton.
“Does it hurt?” John looked at his arse in a clinical way, searching for swelling or signs of bleeding. He seemed fine.
Sherlock lifted his head blearily. Start? Sherlock felt him reach and he glanced up, gulping when John hefted the ruler.
"Oh." He scowled. "My brother dragged me along because he's a nosy git who won't stay out of my life."
She stood beside him and hugged him, her arm around his shoulder. "I know you didn’t. We do worry about you though, Sherlock. I worry. I don’t like you smoking that rubbish. You’re better than that.”
"Fuck off, Sally." Sherlock rolled over and buried himself in the blankets. He heard her slam the cabin door. He was fine, fine. He would never see John again‒had broken his promise to him, in fact, but that was just something they all had to live with. There were other concubines. Other
“And this is a very particular brand of work boot that compensates for fallen arches. It’s sturdy and filthy with what appears to be the same substance that’s under his nails. His toenails are clean enough—he clearly wore shoes at all times while surrounded with this oily grease. Look at his knee—rough skin at the top of the tibia, just under his patella. He spends a lot of time on his knees, something dear Donovan here knows all about—” he waved a vague hand at Sally, prompting another scolding, “Sherlock!” from John.
"Yes, you will. You're so strong, John. He's just awful! He hurts everyone. C'mon. I can make you feel better." He stood up after a moment and she walked with him slowly to accommodate his aches.  "Just to the baths." She said. "You have to get clean."
“I know as much as you, mate. Cheers.” John got in the car, supremely confused. A pretty brunette lady was seated on the black leather bench seat, texting on a blackberry. She didn’t look at him and the car wove smoothly back into traffic.
“Sh, sh…” John kissed his jaw and cheekbone. “Too much?” He soothed, rubbing his hand up and down his body.
Sherlock blinked a few times, coming back to the present. He leaned down and gave his dom a soft kiss. John was more than fine with this, but he was still unsure about…everything now. Was this an ‘I love you’ kiss? Was it a pitying ‘you fool, what are you thinking?’ kiss? Sherlock pulled up and took John’s hand, then strode to the bedroom with his head held high. John trotted after. Sherlock pushed through the door and kissed John again, then hugged him. His hard cock pushed into John’s thigh and the sub reached around and grabbed his bum, squeezing hard. He widened his legs and inhaled the scent of John’s hair.
"You’ll fit right in, then.” She shrugged. “None of us do. Jim finds his concubines anywhere—usually people who’ve pissed him off.”
"Shift to the right, love, would you?" He asked. She did and he was able to see a bit better in the nearby ray of morning sunlight. He visually examined her vulva.
John was walking up the road to look for a cab when his phone jangled and vibrated. He pulled it out of his pocket and looked at the display.
The first course of their food came then, some sort of greens with dressing. It was delicious and amazing and John soon forgot about the flirting and instead they both enjoyed their food. John had taken a risk on the obsiblue prawns and Sherlock was right about the truffle butter. Everything was succulent and delicious…until Chef Logan came out again to check on them.
"Let's go." Sherlock whispered. He slipped his hand into his dom's. "I want to get back in bed. Maybe eat something?"
“Male for sure, judging by the height and shape of the body. Caucasian. Dark hair—just like our victim from a couple weeks ago.” He looked at Lestrade. “Any connection?”
“Oh, that’s fine.” Sherlock hung his coat and paced in the sitting room. A chef! The killer was likely a cook or chef in training of some kind. That would explain the use of sharp knives as weapons and the complete lack of anatomical knowledge.
"Sherlock!" Mrs. Hudson's voice called out to him from the parlor. She strode in, head high, carrying a tray of food that she slammed down on the table near the windows. She turned to him, arms crossed and lips pressed into a line.
She shook her head at John. "Oh, he's not one to hold his liquor." She took the mugs back. "Glad he covered the furniture though. It would be a nightmare to get all the soot out of the sofa seams." She went down the steps. John hoped she'd be careful. She did love Christmas so. He'd check on her later and put her in the recovery position if necessary. For now, he was going to take advantage of the early hour and a well-occupied Sherlock to get some Christmas shopping done.
“I felt threatened because I saw you in a dangerous scenario. So, my Defense was for both of us, I suppose. Mostly you though.”
“Good.” He breathed. “Good boy.” He slipped out of his mouth and held a tissue to his lips and Sherlock spat. He stood, unwrapping the lead from Sherlock’s cock. The sub shuddered as John handled his sensitive cock, eyes closed and lips red and glistening and John smiled. He was completely in subspace, which was exactly where he wanted him.
“We found you in The Broads on Friday afternoon. You were in hospital in Norwich for forty hours. You got a transfusion and were stabilized and then they airlifted us here. To be honest, I’m not sure where in the hell we are. South of London. You’d call me unobservant, but I had a good reason Mr. Holmes, I was distracted…”
“C’mon, let me take care of this for you.” John stood up and pulled Sherlock to his feet. He braced him back against the mantle and wrapped his fist around his eager cock. Sherlock blinked when John sank to his knees.
The violin case was open at his feet and people dropped coins and notes into it as they passed. A couple families were stopped and John watched the children, staring at Sherlock with enchanted expressions. He finished the piece. There was scattered but enthusiastic applause. Sherlock glanced at John, grinned, and graciously accepted spectator compliments. John approached once everyone had dispersed and Sherlock eyed the cups, brows up in interest.
“Yeah, not bad. Easy shift.” They sat at the cleared kitchen table, each tucking into the rice and noodles. Neither man said much, as John hadn’t even realized how hungry he was until he had food in his mouth. By the way Sherlock was shoveling rice, he felt the same. After they finished, they both brought the plates to the sink. “Sofa?” John suggested. “Let’s clean up later.”
John nodded and went into the loo and Sherlock frowned at the door. Something, again, was off. He went out to the desk and opened his laptop. He Googled ‘top drop.’ He’d read the term in the PTSD books and wasn’t entirely familiar with it. He knew all about sub drop from Seb’s gentle ministrations. It had taken an age for him to realize that it wasn’t his brain reacting badly to subbing, it was Seb’s stupid lack of interest in aftercare. Once Sherlock had found a brand of dynamic pill to augment his own biology, he’d managed a much more even keel.
“Ah.” John nodded knowingly. “I thought you’d appreciate it.” The doctor strode inside and Sherlock followed. Instantly he was alert and eying everyone in the room, employees mostly, but patrons as well. A bus boy was in the back corner by a computer. Sherlock glanced him up and down.
“Don’t be embarrassed love, I’m a sub too you know. I know what it’s like to have your dom upset with you. Of course, Frank had a different view on things…it was a different time, then.”
“We can definitely get you a restraining order.” Greg dismissed all thoughts of Sherlock potentially being abused and leaned back and scratched his head. “The good news is that he’s not pressing charges.”
Sherlock made acerbic comments about the absurdity of the film and John stroked fingers through his dark hair with a smile on his face.
Sherlock kept talking. "I only got to see him a few times when I was there. I wanted to see him again, Mike, but I had to go. I broke my promise to him and John— he did
"He's mental. He likes to play with people. Toy with them. He's a nutter. Don't get too close. Anyone who gets too close gets hurt."
“Love? You okay?” John went up to him and took his hand. Still no response. “Good God, I’ve broken him.” John mumbled, half serious.
“He kidnapped Jazz. He overdosed Owen, and thanks to Jenkins’ over active thyroid, he survived.” Sherlock mused.
Twenty minutes later, they were back in their flat. John slipped out of his jacket, weary and eying the sofa eagerly. He didn’t have to work today, and an hour or two to watch telly sounded pretty nice. He didn’t like this case. He didn’t like that Dixon looked like Sherlock. He didn’t like how gruesomely he’d been killed. He pinched the ridge between his eyes and wished that the killer was caught and this ridiculousness was all over. Sherlock’s phone chimed and he grabbed it from his pocket.
Mycroft looked up from the file, taking in the new dom in his brother’s life for the first time in person. He’d seen him dozens of times over CCTV, going in and out of Sherlock’s flat in the evenings and more recently, going in at night and not coming out until the following morning. The obvious information about him jumped out—doctor. Wounded soldier. Former clarinetist. Military father, drunk sister, etcetera etcetera, but most importantly: a switch—a dom.
“I don’t know—go figure out what direction and speed all the trains run in or…go practice deductions, or figure out how a swallow would maintain airspeed velocity while carrying a coconut.”
John let it go. He eased out of his chair, frowning at the tightness in his leg. His calf groaned from the stab wound and he gulped a pain pill with some water. Sherlock went to the bedroom and returned moments later with the leash. He clipped it to his collar and handed John the other looped end. The doctor wrapped it around his palm. They took a cab to Scotland Yard and John had his hand on Sherlock’s knee the whole time. The doctor paid and they inside, Sherlock leading the way to Lestrade’s office, the leash joining them loosely.
’ crew were concerned, a boring journey was a good journey. Boring meant safe. Boring meant nothing had gone wrong and no one, particularly the King, had drowned. Mycroft kept to his cabin, trusted the crew, and let them do their jobs. The crew of the
“That he buggered off after a killer—or got kidnapped.” John remembered the flirty chef and Sherlock’s unusual response to him. Could it be…?
"Sherlock just caught someone embezzling at Scotland Yard, didn't you?" Betsy said, encouraging him to speak.
“Not tonight. Clothes off and kneel.” John instructed. Sherlock pouted but he tossed his gown to the chair in the corner and knelt up on the bed. John unwound each bundle, taking his time to let the varying textures slip through his fingers, soft and sensual and cool and slick like velvet water between his fingers. His cock was interested again, seeing Sherlock nude and feeling the soft ropes in his hands had jerked it stiff and eager again. He loved tying up his submissives—he loved it even more when they were as keen as Sherlock was now. Every sub he’d ever tied up relished it in just a slightly different way. Faster breaths, slower breaths, a deep flush across the neck, fingers dancing in excitement or soft little moans. He had one sub once who could orgasm just from being bound up a certain way. Every experience was unique but familiar and John loved all of it. The multiple types ropes though—that was new. Leave it to Sherlock to turn it into an experiment.
“I’m sorry!” John said, smiling. “Clothesline doesn’t make good bondage gear. That’s why I don’t use it—put that in your experiment data.”
"I'd…I think I want to go to Lestrade's. Will you let me if he says yes?" Sherlock realized on some level how submissive he was feeling right now. He'd never ask John for permission of all things otherwise.
He had a headache and stomachache the whole flight over and once he landed at Heathrow he managed to choke down a two-day old donut from the only shop open at half one in the morning in an attempt to calm his angry stomach. It sat like a sugary rock in his belly and he was tired and irritable. They'd imposed terribly on the officer.
John went to the closest bag and opened it up, half expecting the Mad Prince's luggage to contain vials of chemicals, weird tokens like shrunken heads, bear teeth, or pickled pig snouts. He needn't have worried. A pile of clothes was stuffed within and John knew right away that the Prince had packed it himself. No valet worth his or her employment would have been so slapdash with the royal finery. He reached in and pulled out a deep burgundy silk shirt, wrinkled to hell. John shook it out and dropped it into a basket near the door. The laundry would have to be get those wrinkles out.
Sherlock unfolded himself enough to take the phone and he pressed it up to his ear. "Hi." His voice was sullen.
with each other in safety and peace. The next insane case would come along soon enough and throw their lives into chaos again.
“I’m conducting an experiment where I put slices of liver tissue up to varying heat sources to see how long it takes each one to melt—would you like to help me collect the viscous fluid?”
“You’re hurt. I’m guarding you.” His voice was a little bit deeper than normal and Sherlock shivered. He was similar to how he had been at the cabin, but without the violence this time. Now all that energy was being directed at him and Sherlock found he was bit turned on just from the intensity of it.
There was some scuffling and shifting and then the people—whoever and wherever they were—must have moved on because the voices faded and stopped completely. John sat back on his heels, bemused and stunned. What was in that letter? Who was “supposed to be dead?” Who sent the letter? What was this room? Whatever it was, it must be overhead of one of Chilgrave’s myriad receiving rooms. The palace guests always moved on to drink after dinner. John had smelled enough cigar smoke and alcohol on them to know the routine by now.
He’d wandered London that evening, even going up to his favorite bolt-hole behind Big Ben’s face. It was chilly up there but the view was unparalleled. It was a good place to sit and think and smoke. He’d gone back to the flat during the small hours and crashed on the sofa.
They were participating in NSY's annual holiday toy giveaway. Officers volunteered to hand out donated toys to less fortunate children. It was a big hit every year and Sherlock wasn't the only one dressed as an elf. He was the easily the surliest elf present, however. Sherlock glared at the Santa hat on John's head. John was wearing jeans and a dark green knit jumper, looking very normal save for the festive hat on his head.
John nodded, a new respect for Betsy blooming. Staying with someone who would bring their junkie friends home to sleep it off couldn’t have been easy in a budding relationship.
“I can’t lay in that infernal room all day.” Sherlock muttered. He wrapped sheet covered arms around John from behind, knowing that his presence would be soothing to him. The gun stuck in the back of his jeans rubbed Sherlock’s belly.
Sherlock didn't move and John sank back into the cushions, watching Clark fiddle with the decorations for the house.
“No he didn’t.” Mycroft said. His phone rang and he walked out of the room to answer it, vaguely wondering if he could get the nurse to give his brother a sedative to shut him up.
“How can there be nothing!?” Sherlock ranted. He slammed the door and stormed into the kitchen, roaring in frustration before stomping into the sitting room and rubbing his temples. “No footprints, no articles of clothing, nothing on the bloody CCTV—what’s the point of the cameras if they don’t even see anything, Mycroft!”
“Rohypnol?” Lestrade frowned. “That’s nasty stuff. It makes people disoriented and uninhibited. It gives victims amnesia and it dissolves really well in carbonated drinks.”
“Are you in pain?” He asked. His voice was low so he wouldn’t disturb John. There was a smudge of blue-grey under his right eye. Sherlock blinked. It looked like a bruise.
"It will." John promised. "Come on. You need pain killers. Keep that towel there." John strode to the medical kit and yanked the bag open. The cameras followed. He pulled gloves on and took Sherlock's hand. He tossed the towel aside and found a bottle of antiseptic. "This might sting a bit, mate." He warned. Sherlock nodded and John cleaned the cut. He clenched his jaw at the pain but didn't make a sound and John wrapped a blue bandage around the slice. "There, feel okay?"
“Oh you two!” Mrs. Hudson blushed and left the flat. “You’re so sweet to each other! Enjoy the muffins!”
The peon finished speaking and bowed before scuttling off. A small gold dish rested at Mycroft's elbow, containing a pile of letters and an envelope opener with a handle in the shape of a gilded lion.
John peered up at him, bemused. No one ever asked. People took, grabbed, demanded, pushed. But none of the guests in this awful place asked for anything, much less a kiss.
“Shut up and hold fucking still!” Jim growled. He punched John again, this time on the mouth. John’s head snapped to the side. The blow rattled his very skull. John’s hands flew up to his face and he moaned, clutching his mouth. Jim rolled him over onto his belly and flung the cloth out of the way. He smiled and pushed John’s legs apart.
The doctor pursed his lips and Sherlock nuzzled into his neck. “Look me over. See for yourself that I’m fine.”
The trip to the bedsit went mercifully fast. The place had come furnished, so it was really only a few boxes of personal items that needed moving. The driver helped them unload in B’s foyer and Sherlock gave him a big tip for his trouble.
"Doctor-y?" John snorted and grinned. "Open this." He gestured to Sherlock's gown. He let it fall from his shoulders to his hips and John flipped on a light mounted on a movable arm beside the table. Bright, clear light flooded out of the big white bulb. He swung it around and aimed it at Sherlock's marks.
Sherlock nodded, feeling like by suggesting this, he was diving off a cliff into water, though he had no idea how deep the water was or whether or not it was swarming with sharks.
about him that John couldn’t quite place but that he loved immensely. “What are you doing?” He saw the toy box on the floor and grinned. “Devising new tortures for me?” He teased.
He shows it in everyday ways, too. He shows it in his quiet caretaking, in remembering to stop and eat while they’re on a case because John can’t function when he’s hungry, the way Sherlock manages to keep the flat at least moderately tidy because John likes it neat, how he lets John read the paper first because Sherlock always mixes up all the sections and crinkles the pages.
"Are. And for the record, I'm certainly not grouchy. I'm quite content, actually." John wriggles closer, snakes his hand down under the sheet covering Sherlock's lower half, and squeezes his bare arse playfully. "Thats the point of a lazy day in bed, Sherlock. It's fun to just cuddle and - mmm - fool around, and sleep awhile - then - mmm - do it all again --"
"Hey, beautiful." John's voice is huskier and deeper than normal, and Sherlock reaches up to touch a fingertip to the center of his lower lip.
“It’s fine.” He looks like a rugby player. Definitely. Callouses on his elbows from falling, skidding across wet grass. Hips extremely muscular from squatting in the scrum. “Are you planning to stay there?”
"Sherlock. I have to go. Can you do this for me, or not? This could be the making of you, in the Ministry, if you can help us crack this case."
“Want you.” Sherlock tosses his head back, grabbing at John’s hip with his free hand, “Want you like this.
Shut up, Ella. Not now. He slams the kettle on the cooktop with far too much force, the clatter of it echoing through the small room. Twists the gas on so hard the knob comes off in his hand.
"Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ, fuck, oh god, Sherlock," John bites out, and goes rigid, letting his orgasm rip through him hot and cold and shivering, leaving him weak and heavy. He kneels there, quivering between Sherlock's sweaty thighs, until he can move his limbs, which feel molten and shapeless. He goes to pull out and a hard aftershock pulses through him, making him whine and clutch at Sherlock's leg.
Sherlock's heart was thumping out of his chest, his whole body trembling as John eased him out of his dressing gown and pushed his shirt up. John leaned over and nuzzled against his bare stomach, lapping at his skin with a hot tongue. His cock jumped, and he fought the animalistic need to touch himself, instead throwing his arms over his head and clutching at the edges of the comforter, the white cotton stretching taut between his sweaty hands. "Oh, John."
SO. MANY. THANKS. to caitlinfairchild for beta-ing this for me. I was struggling with some writer's block, and she really helped me sort this chapter out.
“What?” Sherlock snaps. He can’t help it. Means to sound so much gentler, but so often everything comes out all wrong.
, Sherlock thought wonderingly, as he usually did when seeing John at a distance. His size was so incongruous with his presence, with his long, loping gait and those broad shoulders upon which so much weight and sadness had always sat. Sherlock wanted nothing more in the world than to take it all away, to give John every happiness he’d always deserved and rarely received.
The cottage was miniscule, traditionally whitewashed and surrounded by a rocky garden in the front. Towering pines ringed the back garden, black against the purplish twilight sky.
“We know.” Even John slipped a little there, half a laugh escaping into his voice before he could stop it.
Sherlock had been such an abominable prat, honestly, trying to drug him, locking him in that lab like a rat to be studied. He'd manipulated and used him the entire time they were investigating that case. He should have been so much angrier at him than he had been. That was when he realised how much he truly loved him. This man could do anything to him, and he would forgive it. Anything.
The ride home in the cab is an exercise in self control, for both of them. They don’t dare to even make eye contact. The space between their bodies throbs with tangible need, the heat and want they’ve never allowed themselves to feel now unleashed. It feels dangerous. When the cab slows to a stop in front of Baker Street, John’s stomach lurches with the reality of what’s about to happen.
The scrimmage ends abruptly with Gryffindor’s Seeker catching the Snitch, and Mike stands up, brushing off the backs of his pants.
John stirs again, scrubbing his face against Sherlock’s back and cuddling closer. Sherlock shivers at the intimacy of it, the familiarity. John’s hand snakes up his belly. Sherlock catches it, and without considering what he’s doing, puts John’s fingertips to his mouth.
He's got to get home to John, as quickly as possible. It's a panicked desperation rising in his chest, the need to see John, to touch him. To make this whole nightmarish episode with Jim fade away.
, John Watson." Sherlock yanks his finger out of his mouth, a streak of anger mingling with his languid bliss. "I told you we have to be careful, number one. Number two, I am seriously beginning to doubt you were a virgin two days ago."
They fall into a rhythm, syncing their movements, not even kissing anymore but just watching each other's faces. John grimaces and squeezes his eyes shut, bites at his lips and forgets to breathe. He's beautiful.
Wet and cold, he flopped naked on the bed on his stomach and swept up his cigarettes and phone in one hand. He lit a cigarette and pushed the window behind him open with his toe. Nice thing about older hotels, windows that actually opened. There were three texts, one from Lester, one from Mycroft, one from a blocked number. His stomach did a flip.
It’s a hospital room, telly perched on a high shelf in the corner, the plastic blinds pulled all the way up, spilling sunlight over the pale blue blankets covering John’s legs. He’s in hospital. Shit, what the hell happened?
"Tomorrow then. Yes." Sherlock tossed his phone at the sofa and sighed heavily, rubbed his hands over his face. He looked troubled in a way John had rarely seen him. "John. I know you're there."
The sight of Sherlock, wrung out and shaking with aftershocks, is too much. Abruptly, John’s tipped over into the void, and his orgasm is cresting, searing up his spine with the heat of the sun.
didn’t know anything about Quidditch, not past our first year, anyway. You don’t care a jot, do you?”
Sherlock arched forward, pressed his hands hard into the headboard, his wrists bending back. He twisted and whined, trying to push back, but John's hands were strong and firm against his hips, and held him still. John's tongue pushed into him again, deeper this time, tongue squirming and exploring, and John shook his face back and forth rapidly, scrubbing that beard against him just this side of too rough. It was exquisite. The warm soft wetness of John's mouth and the coarseness of his beard juxtaposed at the most sensitive place on Sherlock's body. It was exactly what Sherlock wanted, and John knew it. John always knew.
“Yeah, yes, more, John,” He’s getting hard again, just thinking about John moving inside him, John claiming him like this. He’s evaporating, his skin cells floating away and getting all mixed up with John’s. He can’t think.
John looks around the flat warily, peering round doorways. It’s cleaner than one would expect, tidy and uncluttered. White leather sofa, glass topped coffee table with a stack of money sitting on it. John points at the money, eyebrows raised.
entered the foyer, illuminated dimly by the skylight three floors above. The house was quiet, Mrs Hudson’s rooms dark behind her pebbled glass door.
...but I have to get to Hackney or someplace not here. There's too many cops in the touristy areas."
They're minutes from death. This is it. For the first time John can remember, Sherlock's not going to get them out of some dreadful situation. He can't let this happen again. He's got to
what Sherlock wants and what he likes, because he can’t remember anyone else he’s slept with ever having done that.
John smiles slow and honey sweet, takes the tips of Sherlock's fingers into his mouth. "Yes," he says, and cants his hips gently, jerking forward with a harsh pant. "I'm still angry, but - I think you're beginning to get it. How this works. How
exhausted. Too exhausted to try and sort this out, and too tired to try and pretend that it’s normal. He can’t
He curls tight against Sherlock’s side. His breath sounds uneven. “I love you so much, Sherlock. Sometimes I think it’s the only thing I’m sure of anymore.”
“No. I’m just…” Sherlock curled his fingers into the beard, stroking it, the feeling of those coarse thick curls somehow grounding. “No. Please. Now. Please.”
“Nor can I, John.” Sherlock tentatively reached out and laid a hand on John’s thigh. “I...I love you. I have always, and nothing you tell me will change that.”
“Where did you get this? I found it in your things from the hospital.” John crosses the room and sinks down next to Sherlock on the sofa, placing what he’s been holding in Sherlock’s blanket covered lap.
Oh my god, he is the most gorgeous wondrous amazing remarkable person Sherlock has ever seen. That he's even survived without John Watson up until now is unbelievable.
He didn’t know what his contact looked like. No bother. The contact should know what he looked like.
John's so volatile. God knows how he'll react to talking about all these painful and difficult things. Maybe John will be angry with him, and everything that Sherlock’s been nervously anticipating for two weeks will finally come pouring out and it will be like starting all over again. Sherlock's own pain over the last two years seems nothing in the light of John's blinding grief.
"Please don't leave." Desperation floods through John. He wants to fall on his knees, wrap his arms around Sherlock's hips, bury his face in his clothes and cry and beg, make him stay, make him forgive him. Every ounce of confidence and dominance in him has dissolved into panic. "
"No." But he does, oh god. He needs it so badly. He sucks hard on the cigarette, blows it out of his nostrils and refuses to look away.
John nods and curls into his side, drops a hand onto his thigh and squeezes. “God, where have you been all my life, seriously? I’ve never - “
Sherlock lets out a long exhalation, rolls his head on his neck slightly and presses his shoulders back. “I - I. I’m tired, John.”
“I won’t.” John doesn’t open his eyes. He breathes out long and shuddering. “I’ll watch over you. Go ahead and do what you need to do, and I’ll be right here when you get up. Or come out of it, or whatever.”
“To remind me. Who I belong to.” Sherlock breathes out, fluttering his eyelashes in a way that he knows makes John absolutely insane with want. “You haven’t. Not since we - since we talked almost a month ago. And I
A silvery warmth spreads through Sherlock’s back, feathering out across his shoulder blades and up into his hair. John’s eyes are
"More kisses. More that, whatever you're doing, that." Blood spread warm and slow through his veins, like melting honey, like caramel. He felt himself sinking into John's thighs, into the couch cushions, his legs going loose and and heavy.
Sherlock's eyes lock into John's as he slides his fingers around the frayed cotton and drags it up and over John's head. He immediately goes to take his hands away, and John grabs his wrists. Gives him what he knows is a seductive smile. "Hmm-mm. Where you going?"
"John. You've done this before, haven't you?" Sherlock looks up the plane of John's chest at him, his indigo eyes particularly entrancing, black streaked and dark. He sucks his lower lip into his mouth and bites it. Shakes his head.
“Shhh, that’s it, just - come here,” John slides his arm around Sherlock’s waist and tugs him close, then reclines against the velvet cushions until Sherlock’s head nestles snug in the cradle of John’s shoulder. “Now explain to me what this
“I can’t stand the thought of you leaving. I hate it, I hate it,” John whispers, his voice trapped somewhere between anger and misery.
There’s a spark of connection, a pull. No. No. It’s all starvation and want here, there’s no room for anything gentle, anything good. There’s no saving anyone.
“Yeah, come on, Sherlock, let it go,” John whispers, surging forward to press their mouths together while twisting his fingers in between Sherlock’s, wet and sticky with precome and John’s spit. He thumbs in figure eights over the slippery heads of both their cocks, and Sherlock sucks in a sharp breath and holds it. His entire body quakes once and he whines high pitched into John’s open mouth and arches his hips up and comes between their entwined fingers, warm and thick.
“There now, love. Just, shhh.” John’s runs his index finger over the band on Sherlock’s left hand, curled against his chest. “Husband.”
“Oh. Oh, John.” Sherlock’s fingertips bite into his shoulder, his fingers inside John twitch and then still as the muscles in his arms go stiff.
I wanted to explore every inch of your body with my fingers and my tongue. I wanted to taste you and memorise your smells and listen to you panting over top of me. I wanted to feel your muscles moving under my hands. I wanted things I couldn’t even name.
"You're absolutely incredible." Sherlock is momentarily frozen, blinking at the ferocity on John's face. No one has ever spoken to him like this, loved him like this. Everything at home was unspoken, reserved. Nothing fierce and wild and real like this. Jim was only passionate in his cruelty, everything else bored him.
“Yes ma’am. And…” The doctor pauses, looks at his hands and then at Sherlock directly, “The police will be coming. We have to alert them whenever there’s a violent injury. You’ll have to speak to them when they arrive. They should be here before we move him to a room.”
"Yes, go ahead." Sherlock starts to close the door, hesitates. They stare at each other for a long moment, until Sherlock finally says, "I'm sorry this week has been so hard for you."
"John." Sherlock slides his hand up John's forearm and wiggles his hips, so his testicles lay heavy in John's palm and John's index and middle fingers are right in the position to -- "Oh my god, John."
“Ah, glad I’m not the only Luddite around.” Lightburn smiled at John again, pen poised to write. “Now I do have to take down your information. But it’s only a formality, I’m sure we’ll never need to bother you.”
John grabs Sherlock's wrist as he walks by, pulls him into an embrace and gazes up at him. "You. You, husband, are as giddy as a schoolboy. It's rather irresistible, you know."
John says nothing, replying only with a bashful smile and a lingering gaze that Mycroft breaks with a crisp throat clearing.
He did not rush me, but allowed me to slowly drag my lips over his quivering thighs, to linger in all my favourite places and kiss him here the way I would kiss his mouth - lingering and worshipful and wet. I felt like a supplicant at prayer, looking for salvation between his legs. My knees were wedged in the scant space between the chair and the bare wooden floorboards, sweat pouring between my shoulder blades as the fire roared behind me.
“Believe me, love, it’s pretty obvious.” John chuckled and slid his hands under the waist of Sherlock’s pants, grasped his arse and yanked his hips forward to press against his own. “It’s okay you don’t say it much. I know. Now get your tipsy, beautiful self on that bed and lay down.”
They have no way to make money, except what Sherlock was doing before, and now...He couldn’t. Couldn’t do that to John. So no income, no addresses, they’ll never be able to stay here. Drugs seem less important than they did two days ago, but...food, and fun, and all what they did yesterday requires money. Two thousand quid sounds like so much, but it will go faster than they can even imagine.
Sherlock’s head twitches back in surprise, and his face looks so cartoonishly stunned that John has to laugh. Sherlock blinks momentarily, but recovers quickly and begins to laugh too, a slow resonating rumble from deep in his belly. He throws his head back and covers his mouth with one long hand. Every time the laughter starts to fade, their eyes meet and they dissolve into peales of giggling. Finally John slips his arms around Sherlock’s waist and Sherlock looks down at him with a wide grin.
John had the cabbie drop him off at the far edge of the lot, and watched the car receding before he tapped a cigarette out of the pack and strode toward the diner.
“John, really. Call me Greg.” Lestrade look up at them from halfway down the steps, his eyes framed by the spindles of the banister. “And I mean what I said about not leaving the flat. Not for any reason. Not until I’ve sorted out what we’re going to do and done a bit of my own research on Jim Moriarty.”
This hair was exactly right. Curly and black as sin, and fisted in his fingers as he yanked the man’s head back and thrust into him.
Tramping up the steps of St Mark's into the early morning sunshine, money and his meager treasures tucked securely under his arm. He smoked and walked, found himself sinking down onto a bench at Blackfriars, farther away from St Bart's than Tower Bridge. He had wandered in the wrong direction. Sat on the bench and smoked.
, as close as he can get him, and John squeezes back, nearly crawling on top of Sherlock as he clutches at him. Sherlock touches every part of him he can reach; his protruding vertabrae, his soft greying hair, the ropey scar tissue across his shoulder - every little imperfection that makes John, John.
He stretches and his arm hits paper. The notebook. Sherlock's returned it. A bubble of apprehension expands in his stomach. The book is closed, with a slender brass bookmark protruding from the top. He picks it up and takes a deep breath, then opens it quickly to the bookmarked pages.
- this morning - ” John licks up the side of Sherlock’s face like he can’t stand not to, and clambers off of him quickly, crawling over to the edge of the bed. “Where did you - ?”
“Mmmm, we just passed by Manchester. We’re near Blackburn. You’ve been asleep about two hours. Shall we stop and stretch a bit?”
John shuts the book, out of words for the moment, but it feels as though something has clicked in his mind. He feels calmer, his reservations about last night blossoming into a new level of understanding about them, and curls up, wrapping Sherlock’s dressing gown around him. He doesn’t realise he’s fallen asleep again until he’s blinking, and Sherlock’s eyes are startlingly close to his own. He’s kneeling in front of John’s chair, his feet folded gracefully under his bum, head cocked to the side.
you.” Sherlock said again, in a hush, both wanting to wake John and not to wake him. He pulled the blankets up over his shoulders and draped himself against the side of John’s body, knee to knee, shoulder to shoulder, Sherlock bent slightly at the waist to make up for their height difference. He tucked his nose under John’s jaw and inhaled, smelling the ghost of John’s shampoo, the sugary stale smell of last night’s beer, a bit of mouthwash.
“Oh, fuck, Jesus Christ, Sherlock,” John can’t stop moving, twisting and pushing against Sherlock’s every touch. So eager. He parts his legs automatically, letting Sherlock rub up the inside of his thighs, up into the crease of his groin. Sherlock lays his cheek against John’s bare stomach, watching with wondering eyes his hand moving slowly up the seam of John’s tight denim shorts. He’s mesmerised by this, by them together. By what they can do to each other with a look, with a touch. No one’s ever made him feel both so vulnerable and so safe at the same time.
"None of your business." Sherlock shakes a cigarette out of the pack half crushed in his pocket and lights it with shaking fingers.
"Eight. At Diogenes." Sherlock's hand falls to John's knee. He leans against him. "I'll be there with you."
“Morning.” John grins broadly and hands Sherlock a cup. “Thought you might want some real food, to fortify you for the trip home.”
Sherlock makes a noise somewhere between frustration and sympathy and rubs his hand up against John's stomach and whispers, "I know. One day. We'll take care of everything, tests and whatever, and one day, we will. With nothing between us."
"Good, I think that's best. With all this going on, whatever you two are always up to, I think you should stay together." Her voice shook as she perched on the arm of John's chair. She cupped the side of his face, tears swimming in her eyes. "I still can't believe it. Sherlock alive, and you both here together. Really together. It's a miracle, John. It really is."
John helps him up, and trundles him down the hall into bed. He tucks the blankets in around Sherlock, fetches water and a granola bar from the kitchen so Sherlock can take his medication in the middle of the night without getting up.
“No reason at all.” Rose plants a kiss on his cheek and skips away up the hill, her robes billowing in the wind.
Mycroft sighs heavily and clears his throat. “I’ll just press on then. Malvo’s methodology is unsurprisingly similar to his mentor’s. He works mostly alone,
"Okay." John breathes in, shaky and shallow, and kisses Sherlock on his mouth, his cheek, his chin and his eyelids. Sherlock sighs at every one, touches John’s hair and his shoulder, curls his leg around the back of John’s thigh and presses his foot flat against his calf.
John’s hands smooth down over his back, and Sherlock closes his eyes, tries to drink in every sensation, The soft pads of John’s fingers over his scapula, down his vertebra, John’s belly rising and falling under his own, John’s thigh flexing against his cock, John’s breathing rapid and shallow against his temple. This is the only time it will be the first time, and he wants to remember every single detail.
John licked his lower lip into his mouth, the rather sparse hairs right underneath standing out as his skin stretched. He smiled fondly. “Oh. So it's not bothering you at all. I see. I think I'm catching on. Well, I’m glad you think I'm fascinating. Most people think I’m short and plain and a bit dull.”
He makes sure the door is locked, and pads through the kitchen into the bedroom. John’s sitting on the edge of the bed, head in his hands. He looks up when Sherlock walks in. Sherlock meets his eyes, aching at the expression he sees in them, and slowly unbuckles his jeans. He pushes them down, kicks them away, and pulls his shirt over his head. He starts toward the bed.
John kissed him back, his tears running salty between their mouths. John opened his lips, snaked a hand behind Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down, closer. Sherlock allowed John to direct the kiss, only reciprocating what John initiated. John huffed out a raw breath, and pushed his tongue hard into Sherlock’s mouth, nipped at his lower lip. Sherlock lost his balance as John kissed him deeper and pulled at his neck, bent over at such an angle, and had to brace himself with his hands on either side of John’s head.
John sighed and flopped on the sofa. His stomach was growling, and his head hurt, and everything in their fucking lives led back to that wretched piece of shit Moriarty, and all he wanted was to sleep it all away. His eyes burned.
On the fifth day, the bandages came off John’s rib cage, his entire torso black and green, purple tinged around the edges where the bruises faded into pink skin. Sherlock touched the tender skin with questioning fingers, John leaning back in the bed and sighing. “Does it hurt?” “Not when you do that.” John’s eyes warm and soft, his hand trailing tingling and hot up the outside of Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock leaned in, John sighing against his mouth, and they kissed hot and hungry until a nurse came in and they broke apart, Sherlock leaping off the bed in mortification and John laughing until his ribs ached again and he had a coughing spell.
"Now there's a way you can get my attention." Sherlock looks over his shoulder at John and arches an eyebrow.
Everything about this stings. Burns at the backs of his eyes and his throat, makes his chest tight. He doesn’t even know whether this is real or not. God, how he
"Certainly." Mycroft pockets his phone again and leans forward. "Did you make contact with anyone other than Malvo?"
John’s sob of miserable joy is muffled by Sherlock’s tongue pressing hot into his mouth. John shuts his eyes and loses himself in the wet slide of Sherlock’s tongue against his own, the gentle scape of his teeth pulling across John’s bottom lip, the catch of skin as the tips of their noses bump. Sherlock’s hands spread across his shoulder blades, curl around his biceps, tugging him endlessly closer. Sherlock’s mouth moves away from his own, down his jaw, pressing so hard into his jugular that his head goes light.
He forced his eyes open, fighting against the pain of doing so. Black curls, aqua eyes. So familiar, but he couldn’t...couldn’t quite sort it out. Everything was so muddled.
"I thought you were too tired. Going straight to sleep." Warmth shivered through him, originating where John's fingers were now tracing his collarbone, and spreading down his back. His scalp tingled pleasantly.
"Are you playing drums on my arse, John?" A cold breeze from the open window licks over his bare back and he shivers.
John leaves him be, can’t help turning round occasionally to look behind them, make sure the tail is still there. He never takes his hand off his gun.
Sherlock slowly slides his chair back, his place in this conversation negligible at best. Mycroft and John will spar and bicker, but they're
. John, oh my god. I love you.” Sherlock grinds his head back into the pillow, his fingers in a vice grip on John's shoulder.
Sherlock cleared his throat, feeling as though he'd really put his foot in it, which was ridiculous, because of course he hadn't sent the parcel. It was an unspoken understanding that they never discussed John's father, however, and now he felt as though he'd broken that rule by bringing any of this up. "Oh. I'm sorry, John. Is she  --- ?"
He rocked his hips forward and his elbow bit into Sherlock’s shoulder, but he couldn’t seem to mind. Not with John’s sweaty thighs slapping gently against his arse, and John’s cock moving inside him, John’s breath humid on his throat. He slid his hands over John’s chest, over his shoulders, as John licked messily up his jaw and brought their mouths together in a kiss both gentle and fierce. He nipped at Sherlock’s lips, soothed over them with his tongue, rubbed the ends of their noses together.
John watches Sherlock go, knowing this will be hard, deeply emotional. He's cried in front if Sherlock many times, but not about them. Not about who they are, what they mean to each other. They just don't do that. No, correction. They
to." The first harsh words Sherlock's said to him since the rapist drove off. "You want to eat? You want cigarettes and coffee in the morning? Well. Then you'll have to too, soon enough. Stealing doesn't work, you get caught too often. I know. I tried it."
Jim's eyes narrow, still languidly rubbing a palm over himself. "I already told you that's not an option, Sherlock. Are you fucking retarded? Now either get over here and put that lovely mouth to work or get the fuck out of my flat. You've got ten seconds."
“Well, Oliver Wood happens to be one of the best Keepers in the history of the game. He played for Gryffindor before Ron Weasley did - I daresay you know who
“Fine.” Sherlock acquiesces grouchily, trying to sound annoyed, but the effect is tempered by the loud yawn that escapes him as he kicks off his shoes and uncurls his legs to drape them across John’s thighs. He snakes his right arm behind John’s back and tucks his head snug into the crook of John’s neck.
“Gently there, I’m still recuperating.” Sherlock teases, a deep calm spreading through him. This. This is how they’re supposed to be. It just feels
“She was like us. She lived here with me for a while. One night, she just, never came home. That was five months ago.”
"I want another drink." He opened his eyes and looked steadily into Sherlock's, lowered his lashes and wiggled his hips. He pouted his lip, and trailed a finger over Sherlock's Adam's apple. "Baby, my ankle hurts."
, whatever that meant. Then Sherlock would get to take immense satisfaction in shaving him with a straight razor, straddling his lap on the bed with a bowl of warm water on the nightstand and John's hands resting pleasantly on Sherlock's hips.
While it was excruciating some nights to watch the exquisite movements of Sherlock’s back muscles through his shirt as he played violin, and know that he would never touch them, never feel them sweaty under his mouth while Sherlock gasped in pleasure, he would bite down his need and remind himself that this was enough. Because it
I laid my head into the crook of his unshaven neck and very nearly purred with contentment. His arm tightened around me and I allowed myself to sink more heavily against him. The new addition was remarkably comfortable, the leather upholstery supple, the cushion dipping and curving around my body as I shifted against Watson’s side, my legs now draped over his lap.
The waitress reappeared bearing another coffee, and thumped it down in front of the man, but her eyes were on John. “Get you boys somethin’ to eat? We got a real nice omelet with ham -”
“No, you’re right. You’re right.” He flips his hand to lace their fingers together, rubs his thumb over the heel of Sherlock’s hand. “You’ve been - you’ve been right all along.”
“I’m sorry.” And he is, he actually is. He’s rarely actually sorry, for anything. But he’s made John uncomfortable, and the apology can’t leave his mouth fast enough.
“You don’t.” Sherlock winked and smiled, set the bowl on the bedside table and wiped John’s face and throat gently with a washcloth.
, is so precious to me, so long in coming. I don’t want to disrupt this. I don't want to talk about difficult things. I want to feel your stomach pressed in the small of my back, and hear those little sighs in my ear. I can't bring myself to disturb this calm between us.
. It's everything that he's talked himself out of wanting, never thinking he would even live to see twenty, that he'd OD all alone some miserable night on a cold tile floor and that would be it. Nice is everything it isn't. It's heartbreaking, and magical, and precious, and Sherlock could stay like this forever. If he hadn't made choices that needed to be atoned for. If Jim didn't exist.
"Indulge me, I'm injured." John cocks a devastatingly flirtatious crooked smile at Sherlock, and slides the vee of his index and middle fingers along the top of Sherlock's cock.
"I could never." Just the thought of that. Calling his precious Sherlock a slave, thinking of him that way. Sherlock is a fragile thing, beautiful and rare. He's to be treasured, protected, held with gloved hands like a priceless antique. "No, that's not us at all."
There's a rumble in his stomach, a sharp contraction, and his shoulders heave. He can't stop it. Leans forward and throws up all over the floor, all over his shoes, the cuffs of his jeans. Vomit dripping out of his nose, hunched over with his hands braced on his knees.
They stand there in silence, just looking at each other. Any minute John’s going to leave. Sherlock doesn't want him to leave. Doesn't want him to disappear into the night, a brief moment of connection gone forever. He wants to talk to him until the sun rises, sit on a bench by the river and smoke, laugh at the tourists who think London is all Big Ben and double deckers beauty and history and grace, who don't understand it's never been that, but always darker and more tortuous and more fantastic. He wants to walk on the banks with him, listening to the crunch of river rocks under their trainers and tell John about the science of sand, how the water wears down the rocks into nothingness. He wants them to drink scalding hot coffee out of styrofoam cups in the pink morning in some greasy diner, laughing at each other across the table. He wants to know the exact weight of John’s head resting on his stomach. He wants to trace those eyelashes with a fingertip and fall asleep with John's face inches from his own. He wants to see that laugh, those crinkled shining eyes, every day for the rest of his existence. He wants to tuck John into his body, inside his bones, and keep him. Never spend another day without those searching intense eyes roaming his face.
“You’ll make yourself sick, John. I’ll give you some more in a few minutes.” Sherlock lays his hand back over John’s, weaves their fingers together. Sherlock’s hand feels strangely large, his fingers thick between John’s. The minutes stretch silently between them, and John’s just tipping over the edge of sleep again when Sherlock shifts and clears his throat. His fingers tighten around John’s palm. “You scared me nearly to death, you know.”
He couldn’t keep his eyes open, couldn’t turn his head. There was a sweeping pressure against his aching forehead. A kiss. Someone had kissed his forehead.
He walked into the check in desk. The obese woman was still there, squatting on a plastic stool, some godawful talk show squawking away from a filthy little tube television. She turned briefly and looked away, before realising it was him again. She turned slowly.
“Bye, Sherlock.” John seems reluctant to leave, pausing to turn and smile at Sherlock with every step he takes.
Sherlock had thought he wanted to be, at the time. Jim was the only person who'd ever wanted him, and Sherlock knew now he'd mistaken that possessiveness for love. Jim had
Sherlock chuckles quietly, "It's not an insult. I think you just need time to think, and sometimes when we're talking, you don't have that time. Reading your journal today was enlightening. And...intimate. I know you better than I did this morning, John. And," Sherlock's voice drops into a hush, his head nuzzling under John's arm in small circles, "I want to know everything about you.
No. Sherlock doesn’t want to be different. He wants to be what John wants. His face must register this, because John says quickly, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to - no. You’re perfect, love, you’re fine.”
"I know. Me too." The amount of love and tenderness surging through him is almost overpowering his want. Almost. He runs his hands down Sherlock's sides, and pulls at his hips. "Spread your legs for me."
"I want to go to Cairndow first. I've never been to the Highlands." Sherlock murmured against John's tee shirted shoulder. The alarm clock read 7:04am. John had nearly bashed it to bits when it went off at 7:00, furious at himself for having forgotten to change it for the weekend.
Sherlock blinks, snapped out of his reverie, and squints up into the sun. Rose’s frizzy halo glows crimson in the bright light. She grins and slides next to him on the steps.
reassuring." Sherlock gets up, floorboards creaking as he walks toward the kitchen and back to his chair. "Can you at least look at me, John?"
The grin that spreads across Sherlock's face starts way down in his stomach, dissolving momentarily the anxiety that's been weighing him down. He laughs loudly and John laughs, too, then leans forward and burrows against Sherlock's side. John's fingers play at the hem of his tee shirt, brushing more than incidentally against his bare stomach.
She opens her mouth. Shuts it again. Considers him for a moment, and crosses her arms over her chest. “I don’t know. That’s a good question. I guess I’ll ask him when he wakes up. I’m staying.”
John and Sherlock have a very long and difficult discussion, because, as usual, these two have a terrible time actually saying what needs to be said.
“Yeah, that’s it, my lovely boy, that’s it. Tell me. Tell me how good it feels.” John puts his mouth against Sherlock’s ear, tightens his fingers just enough to provide Sherlock with some friction.
“Okay.” Sherlock lowers himself gingerly to the very edge of the bed, very aware of how his shirt is becoming hard with drying blood, and that he must smell like sick.
His eyes flitted open at my words, and he blinked several times before he was able to focus on my face. When he did, his pleasure at my return was evident as he reached immediately down to cradle my jaw in his sleep-warm hand. His smile grew ever larger, his eyes twinkling.
“Ss-sorry…” John’s lost control of his voice, stuttering and shaking. A deep red flush is creeping up his chest, has already bloomed on his neck and face. “It just feels so good, you touching me.”
- and does what comes naturally, sliding his hand up and over the swollen head of him, makes John curl up and
"Never again." John wasn't even sure he said it out loud - so heavy and warm in the cradle of Sherlock's body, his back pressed tight against Sherlock's stomach, that he was half asleep already - but Sherlock hummed and wriggled closer in response, tucking a foot in between John's ankles.
His mouth fell open with a sob, the sound of his name on Sherlock’s tongue after all this time sending chills through his entire body. He was quaking, falling apart. He was choking, he couldn’t swallow. He definitely couldn’t speak. He laid there, head facing the window, eyes closed, though he knew Sherlock would easily see how his entire body was shuddering.
John’s certainly did. At Sherlock’s assent, he pulled Sherlock’s hips up off the bed and shoved a pillow underneath them, ran his hands gently over the backs of his thighs and pushed his knees forward, spreading him open enough to --
“Uh.” Sherlock’s voice was creaky. He cleared his throat, and John mumbled something and pushed his nose into Sherlock’s armpit, still soundly asleep. “I guess he slept fine. I was asleep myself, so...did you need me to move?”
for a job in the Muggle world. He goes home to a world where magic is unfathomable, where he’s even more out of place than usual. Being away from Hogwarts aches, like a gaping wound in his chest. It’s a relief to be headed back.
“So, John, as it seems you already know, Lorne Malvo worked for Jim Moriarty. That’s why he recruited you. That’s how he first knew of your existence. Your connection with Moriarty, with Sherlock.” Mycroft says almost apologetically, looking from John down to his entwined hands resting on the tabletop.
him. John loved him. Jim had just wanted to control him, show him off, his pretty boy he had on a leash. He'd wanted to break Sherlock down, destroy what little self-confidence he possessed, and make him entirely beholden to Jim.  Jim had played the game so well, lulling Sherlock into believing no one else could ever want him the way Jim did. That he was a useless junkie and only Jim could love him. No one else.
"I can't say I'm entirely confident in your honesty, given that the first time we met, you lied through your teeth about almost everything. But." Lestrade pauses and chews on the end of his pen. "I've found that 2:30am phone calls tend to be pretty truthful. People are too tired and hopeless to bother lying."
"Yes, John." Sherlock scrambles backwards, sliding back onto the floor and coming to his knees at John's feet.
John’s keys were dangling off the edge of the coffee table, clearly thrown there hastily. His jeans were crumpled in a ball on the hallway floor. Sherlock picked them up and pushed the bedroom door open.
Sherlock was actually removing his arm from behind John’s back, preparing to allow him this rejection, when John’s careworn face softened into a smile and he touched the fingers of his left arm, laying between them on the bed, to Sherlock’s thigh. “You
"I'm going to unbuckle your hands now. You can hold on to the bed or whatever you need to." John gently unbuckles the cuffs and rubs his hands up Sherlock's arms as they fall limply to his sides.
“I’m - I’m -” Sherlock whimpers and rolls his head against John's, grabbing at the sheets, at John’s thigh, at anything he can dig his fingers into.
It could not be. It could NOT be. Someone was playing with him. Mocking him. Lorne? No. While that certainly seemed like his style, he had no reason to be playing with John.
John pulls away, wanting to watch, always wanting to see the miraculousness of Sherlock’s kiss swollen mouth falling open, his eyelashes twitching against pale cheeks, the way his eyes fly open right at the end, as if he’s startled by his own pleasure.
The exact weight of John's head on his stomach. He still wants that, but this. This is blissful. The curve of John's skull hard against his bone thin shoulder. Sherlock can feel John's heartbeat in his temple. He swallows against a sudden surge of emotions he doesn’t have names for. John’s hand shifts, wraps around Sherlock’s from the front, John’s sweaty palm against the top of Sherlock’s hand, his fingertips pressing into Sherlock’s lifeline. John’s elbow jutting into the crease of Sherlock’s. Their arms fit together like they were made to do just this. He’s never in his life felt this kind of connection to another person. Not even Molly. Not even his own brother. He doesn’t have friends.
John sleeping was something Sherlock never tired of witnessing. His furrowed brow smoothed, his soft pink lips always just slightly parted, his face in slumber was always untroubled. He was a bit of a thrasher, always waking up in the oddest positions, far from how he went to sleep. Many mornings, he had awoken to John’s squarish slender feet on his pillow instead of his head, or John half on his back with his head resting in Sherlock’s armpit and one arm thrown backward across Sherlock’s belly.
“Well, my bonny lassie,” John winked at him, and Sherlock’s cheeks burned with pleasure, “I’m for the shower, and then bed. Shall we do some tramping about in the woods tomorrow?”
“Quite.” I managed, though by this point I was desperate to be fucked, and my stomach ached with how much I wanted to come.
He picks up his trainers from the sitting room floor and carries them, going down the steps barefoot so he won't wake either John or Mrs Hudson. Pulls them on quietly at the foot of the steps, not even turning on a light. He unlocks the door painfully slowly, turning the deadbolt lever a millimeter at a time so it doesn't make a sound. Exhaling through his mouth, he opens the door just enough to slip his thin frame through the crack.  The door of Baker Street closes with a soft click. The night is frigid and he's underdressed again.
"Alright." John leaned back into the cracked leather and his eyes roam the flat. Now that he really looked, it was obvious Mrs Hudson had cleaned. It wasn't dusty - well, any dustier than it usually was anyway - and there was a vase of fresh flowers sitting at the end of the mantle on top of a pile of books. She hadn't moved Sherlock's mouldy coffee mug, though. Probably picked it up and dusted the disgusting thing. She always knew, somehow, even in her frenetic dottiness, exactly what both John and Sherlock needed.
"I think we should wait to talk about this until you've done your session." Sherlock's hand brushed his on the seat.
Sherlock!” John called without turning, waving an arm at Sherlock as he descended over the ridge and disappeared.
“Like this?” Sherlock huffs into John’s hair, his breath hitching on a pulse of arousal as his cock drags up between John’s arse cheeks.
"You don't want to." John's voice goes flat, accusatory and petulant. He sounds like a child having a strop, and he hates himself for it. He yanks his hands out from under Sherlock's.
John was the beating of his heart, the blood pulsing through his brain. John was the only thought that kept him going. John, John, John. The name thrummed through his body incessantly. It was a prayer. It was the only thing keeping him together.
Sherlock’s words taper off into a strangled noise as John pushes up on his knees and closes his lips over the head of Sherlock’s cock. The rush of arousal that always soars through him at the taste of Sherlock in his mouth, at the feel of slick salty skin heavy on his tongue, is more dizzying than ever tonight. He groans around Sherlock as his head goes floaty light, and Sherlock echoes the sound, rocking his hips ever so slightly up to push his cock further into the wet heat of John’s mouth.
Bracing himself with one hand wrapped round both John’s small wrists, he reaches back with the other hand and grabs the opened lube, smears it over his cock and presses himself against John, just
He was not going to be able to fucking stand it if all these people kept referring to him as Dr. Watson. “John. It’s fucking John. I’m not a doctor anymore. Who’s this?”
“Well. He’ll - punish me a bit first. I don’t mean physically!” Sherlock nearly shouts, voice rising automatically as he watches the red blotches of fury breaking out across John’s cheeks and throat. He takes a deep breath, measuring his tone. “I just mean - he’ll not let me have what we had before. I’ll have to earn his trust again. Hopefully before he accepts me back completely, it’ll be over. And I won’t have to - do anything. You know.”
. I like that.” John swallows, and looks suddenly serious. He blinks a few times and licks his lips, scratches the back of his neck nervously. “I like. You. I really like you, Sherlock.”
He smiles and takes her hands, squeezing lightly. “He’s, you know, off in that big brain somewhere.”
Now he can give John this, show him how beautiful he is, how treasured. The crushing intimacy of it, the trust. He pushes himself up on his hands so he can swallow John down to the hilt, his glans rubbing into his throat. He chokes a little, but doesn't pull off, the weight and heat of John in his mouth so incredible that he never wants to stop. Cups his tongue around the underside, lapping at the vein as he draws his mouth up to the leaking slit and dips into it with the point of his tongue, and then takes him deep again.
, of course I’m not okay. I just watched you nearly bleed to death in front of me. How would I possibly be okay? And why should you care right now? Jesus fucking Christ, John. Why would you
“I recognise that guy. I’ve seen him before.” John looks away from them, takes Sherlock’s hand again and smiles at him.
Molly shakes her head and sticks out her tongue, long amber coloured braids bouncing against her shoulders, “Well. You enjoy that. I’m going to go ahead to the platform, see if I can find Mike or anyone. See you on the train, Sherlock!”
“Harry.” He sounds stiff and unpleasant and he knows it. Harry’s intruding, intruding on what precious time they have before - before whatever’s coming next - and he just doesn’t want anyone here except himself and John. He doesn’t do well with sharing.
"Oh, fuck, Jesus fuck," John gasped, his hips pumping up into the wet heat of Sherlock's mouth as he leaned on one elbow and twisted his fingers into Sherlock's hair. He didn't push, just rested his hand in Sherlock's curls, feeling the motion as he bobbed his head and sucked him.
They kissed softly for a few moments more, John’s arms wound around Sherlock’s waist, Sherlock stroking his fingers over John’s hair, down the beard, over well-trimmed cheeks and more raggedy hairs on his neck, finding the cleft of his chin with his thumb. John pulled back, leaving a trail of tender kisses across Sherlock’s cheek. He smiled with his eyes, with the whole face, in that way that only John could, like a light radiating out into a dark room. He gently pushed Sherlock off his lap and stood up with him, silently pulling him by the hand down the darkened hallway into their room. He closed the door and turned round.
“You want to - like this - or - ” John pants, reaching a hand down between his own legs. His breath stutters, catches, as his hips jerk. “Because…”
are going to hurt yourself. We have to wait." Sherlock hates himself for saying it, for stopping them, especially now. He pushes at John's shoulders. "The doctors said
, so strong and masculine without being hardened. John is capable of such extraordinary gentleness. A fierce protectiveness surges within Sherlock, thinking of all John has been through, all
Two hours in, pressed up against a vaguely slimy wall and nursing his third gin and tonic, there's still no sign of the mark. No one at all to divert Sherlock's attention from this beautiful lithe blonde creature weaving his way through the mass of bodies with his shot tray resting against his bare chest. He moves differently from everyone else here. The rest of the crowd moves as one, bodies blending together, all wiggling hips and waving arms, a single indistinguishable hoard.
“Slow down, love. Doesn’t have to be hard to be good.” He whispers into Sherlock’s mouth, wanting to make sure he knows how much
Mycroft’s lip curls, and he opens his mouth to retort. “Ah, my dear brother. As charming as ever. Which means not at all.”
“I’m - I’m really sorry. It’s my fault, James - he only did that because you’re with me.” Sherlock’s voice quivers embarrassingly, and he falls silent.
He can almost smell the cinnamony aroma of his mother's tea cake. The wet dog smell of his father's damp wool caps hung against the wall.
“I know. I know you have. I’m sorry I was so stupid before.” Sherlock reaches up with his good hand, runs his fingers through John’s hair, pulls him forward. “Come
John cocks his head to the side, as if he’s considering it. He shrugs, “I don’t know what to do with me, either. So we're even."
John's head tilted to the side. John's perfect silver blonde head that held all of John inside it, all of his secrets and memories, all his funny quirks, his bravery and intelligence, the ability to save people's lives with just his delicate small hands. Sherlock reached up and wrapped his own enormous hands around the sides of John's head and pulled him down to kiss him with as much feeling as he could express with just the slide of his mouth against John's.
Sherlock's throat constricts, joyful endorphins flooding through his bloodstream. Usually this kind of thrill erupts in him while he's chasing a dark shape down an alley, or having a particularly complex deduction prove true. Never once has another person drawn this feeling out in him, especially by the simple act of smiling.
John howls with laughter, because now the memory of that night isn't miserable and aching, now that Sherlock's leg is warm over his shoulder and Sherlock's eyes are lit with arousal and love and affection underneath him, and as he's laughing, he moves forward and Sherlock's body opens to him, and the laughter dissolves into a growl as Sherlock raises his hips and clutches at John's thighs with stiff fingers.
Sherlock squeezed his hand and glanced over. John's face was relaxed, his head leaned back against the headrest. "Alright. Tell me about it?"
"I want to see." Sherlock nudged at John's shoulders, and John complied, letting Sherlock push him up until he was kneeling, straddling Sherlock's stomach.
“I can just keep doing this, then, indefinitely…” He purred, voice ringing with dark mischief, and rubbed his forefinger hard over my spot again.
"Most definitely yes. Do I have time?" John fights the inclination to ask whether Sherlock wants to join him. They're not there yet.
“I’ll walk you out.” John follows her in through the window, gathering up the empty coffee mugs as he goes.
“God, I love you, baby.” He was shocked at the intensity of emotion in his voice, hoarse and breaking.
“Trunk?” The cabbie’s voice was derisive, thick with laughter. An image flashed through John’s mind of his bloody face on the ground between John’s fists, saliva flying as his head was punched sideways.
“Sherlock Holmes. Are you asking me to move in with you, after one day and one fuck in a loo?” John’s grin is so bright it could power half of Marylebone.
People stared at them, but Sherlock held tight to John's hand and shot a vicious sneer at anyone who looked too long. They'd bought off the sale rack, shorts for £5, tee shirt for £3, a few pairs of new pants for 50p each, and swung their bags from their hands as they walked. Feeling almost normal.
He can't ever say them, the things that really matter, fear swelling in his stomach. "Mary never made me happy the way..."
Sherlock’s voice breaks through John’s reverie. He realises with some surprise that his eyes are moist. Thinking of those early days together often tatters John apart like this, pulling him ragged at the edges. He sometimes finds himself quite missing those daring young men they had been, racing through darkened alleys at 3 am, tackling criminals without a second thought, John stitching them up in the loo after two days of no sleep, grinning at each other with split lips and bloody teeth. They had fallen in love without even knowing what was happening, tethering themselves to each other inexorably until they no longer knew how to breathe without the other. They’d loved each other through death, through marriage, loss. They’d broken each other’s hearts a dozen times before they’d even shared a single kiss.
Sherlock’s beyond speaking, just drops his hand into John’s hair and kneads at his neck, pushes down onto his hand. John understands, slides his finger out, and then pushes two back in. Fire crackles up Sherlock’s nerve endings and he arcs high up off the bed, clenching around John’s fingers and whimpering desperately. He’s never let anyone see him like this, so lost in them, so delirious with love and desire. Only John can be trusted with every part of him.
, just to melt into John’s touch, allow himself to be held. His head tilts down of its own accord, hips and torso and arms naturally unfurling towards John’s body. Like he’s always wanted to, like he never believed he’d be allowed to.
Sherlock wants to live inside this moment, with the morning sunlight streaming in the window behind them, twining around John’s gorgeous blushing body, and John on him, inside him, surrounding him. The second wave is cresting, though. He can't stop the surging heat between his legs, the tremulous shiver shimmering up his spine. His hand speeds up around his leaking prick, his aching belly tightening again. John twitches and cries out, his fingers digging into Sherlock’s hip.
"What?" Gasping, pulling at the knot of Sherlock's scarf. "God, you knot this thing like it's trying to escape."
“What are you looking at?” Sherlock rasps, sounding snappish and not meaning to. He immediately quails, worried he’s broken the mood.
Sherlock stretches luxuriously underneath him, rolling his head back against the pillow and lifting his back off the mattress enough to push their hips together, the proof of his arousal dragging hard and blood hot against John’s thigh. The contact makes them both whimper and gasp, Sherlock’s fingers digging almost frantically into John’s shoulders.
Sherlock runs his fingertips over them, traces the starburst outline of John’s scar, and he wants to say
“We’ll...we’ll figure all this out when we get home. Let’s get you put back together first.” Sherlock turned, John moved to give him room. Sherlock stretched out, cradled John’s head against his shoulder, brushed his lips through his hair. “We’ll sort it out, I promise.”
The door was the same. Weathered and black, streaked with years of rain soaked soot, the knocker crooked to the left just like John always left it. The stone and bricks were the same, chipping mortar and gaping cracks. Damaged and weather beaten, but still standing. The windows, God, the windows through which they had watched so many moments of their lives about to happen. The curtains hadn't even been changed. Rain dripped steadily off the canvas awning over Speedy's rickety tables. A car flew past much too fast for the small street, and John watched it turn onto Marylebone Road, past the tube stop and the Nando's they used to eat at when it was too late and they were too tired to go anywhere else.
The photos popped up one by one, a ghost of an image at first, gaining in clarity and colour as it loaded. John. So familiar, so foreign. It had been over a year since he’d looked into that face.
The man in the seat next to him stirred. "Hey, buddy, you wanna close the window? Some of us are trying to sleep."
John wiggles, turns his face, brushes his lips against Sherlock's shoulder, and murmurs, "I love you."
Butterflies. Dog eared books. Apple pasties. Cream tea on a rainy afternoon. The smell of leather cleaner. Flannel pyjamas worn through at the knees. Christmas pudding with all the raisins picked out. The sound of the front door creaking open, and the way my stomach still flutters when I hear your footfalls on the stairs. The smell of coffee perking on the hob. The rustle of the sheets when you come to bed five hours after I do and you’re trying not to wake me. Peppermint gum. Autumn leaves. Cigarettes and mouthwash. (I always know, you know.)
“...he’s always telling me to just use my phone, get one of those you write on with the little stylus, but…” John jerked a thumb at Sherlock, the expression on his face far too open and friendly to be real.
- fucking hard, and I had to - I couldn't not," He can barely breathe, Sherlock's hot, thrashing, vibrating body pushing against him everywhere, pushing against his cock and his fingers and his neck, Sherlock's hand slipping fast and frantic up over his hip ribs bicep shoulder and back down. He presses his fingers deeper, just that much inside, and Sherlock groans and digs his fingers into John's waist.
John buckles the cuffs on each wrist gently, checks to ensure they're not tight enough to restrict circulation, but tight enough Sherlock's hands won't slip out. "Okay?"
"So what brings you back?" She positioned her pen over the pad balanced on her crossed legs and waited.
going to stop making him crazy, and waves the condom in Sherlock's face again. "Not a virgin for much longer."
The texts didn't seem cruel, in any case. While they'd terrified him at first, with a few days to think on them, they felt...loving. Like someone was watching out for him.
"God, I want you..." Sherlock pulls off, curls his hands around John's hips, licks him up and down, foreskin dragging across his tongue. "I could do this all night. Seeing you like this, Jesus Christ, John. You're a fucking miracle."
Sherlock felt a creeping darkness over his shoulders and up the back of his neck. The black mood that John usually deemed
. Where the fuck was he when Moriarty was destroying our lives the first time? Where was he when I was falling apart?” John grinds his teeth and takes a heavy draught of his beer, self aware enough to understand that all this anger isn’t entirely for Mycroft. He’s angry with himself, too. Furious, actually. For allowing all this, for bringing himself to the brink of destruction and dragging Sherlock down into it.
Clenching his hand so tight he was afraid of drawing blood, he closed his eyes. You can’t beat the shit out of the guy today and fuck him tomorrow, John. Well, at least, it severely lowered his chances.
“I wanted you the second I saw you,” Sherlock tucks his burning face against John’s spine, whispering words he almost hopes John doesn’t hear.
Sherlock’s gaze fixates on it. The blue and white writing, the threading of the lid. It looks like an antique. John screws the lid off, dips two fingers in. It’s more than halfway empty - been used many times before. It hits Sherlock again, suddenly, that this isn’t at all the first time they’ve done this, and now, somehow, his other life seems like the dream. This, this feels real and
In the fourteen years of our acquaintance, we had never been so many days apart. It was simply unheard of. Where I went, so went Watson. I sulked and pouted as I was wont to do when trying to encourage Watson to bend to my desires, but it had been to no avail. He was determined he would not accompany me on this particular case and there had been no swaying him. He kissed me softly before I departed, however, his eyes as blue as the hollyhocks in Mrs Hudson’s back garden, and smiled.
. He doesn’t sit in front of the fireplace and wonder what someone else is doing at that moment, whether they’re thinking of him or not. He’s Sherlock Holmes, for fuck’s sake. He’s the top of his year, beats every Ravenclaw in exams, practically outwits the professors in Potions and Arithmancy. His brother is Mycroft Holmes, rising star in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, mentored by Harry Potter himself. The two of them are going to be important, the unstoppable Holmes brothers. They’re going to revolutionise the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, the Ministry itself.
John throws his head back and laughs full stop. It’s fucking Christmas. It’s bells tinkling and mince pie and fairy lights reflecting on the river. It’s absolutely the most beautiful and comforting noise Sherlock has ever heard in his life.
"Well I guess I'll just have to grow one, then. God forbid I deprive you of data." John's hand crawled down over Sherlock's hip, and he flipped the telly off without warning. "Come to bed, genius. I think I need some help getting out of these clothes."
Instead of dwelling on it, he yanks John's shorts unceremoniously over his hips. His cock springs free, nestled in a thatch of cinnamon brown curls between the hollows of smooth pelvic bones. Sherlock nearly whimpers at the sight of it, hard and dusky red, already glistening wet at the tip and standing proudly against John's taut belly. It's not much longer than average, but thick, so thick he's not even sure he can get his mouth around it comfortably. But God, how he
I drink water out of the kitchen tap and lean against the counter, staring out at the fire escape with sleep stung eyes.
John laughs low in his throat, a secret laugh only for Sherlock, one that he's never heard outside of them like this, naked and soft and tangled together in an overwarm bed. The sound of it sweet and fluid as melted honey, covering Sherlock's nerve endings, spreading heat over his epidermis. Heady. Thick. Making it hard to think.
John hums again, placing a lingering kiss on the nape of Sherlock’s neck, moustache tickling already goose-bumped skin, and noses up into his hair. “God, I love you in the mornings. I mean, Christ, I love you all the time, but - you’re so -
John nods tightly, pushes himself down eagerly on Sherlock's fingers, and Sherlock breathes out hard, drops his forehead to John's shoulder, twists his wrist just so, and rubs his finger over John's prostate. Heat sparks through his belly and back, a beautiful tension spiraling tendrils down his thighs. An "Oh, fuck," tries to escape him, but Sherlock's palm is pressed hard over his lips and all that comes out is a muffled grunt. His hips jut forward, and the tip of his cock makes contact with the brick wall. He whines in discomfort, jerks backward, his head spinning with arousal and a small amount of fear at himself, his reactions, the fact that they're only three meters away from a public sidewalk, Sherlock's hand still clamped tight over his mouth, his chin and the bottom of his nose smeared with saliva.
"What?" Sherlock was laying with his head in John's lap, John's fingers scratching pleasantly at his scalp. He could have given a toss about Doctor Who, as John well knew, but his head on John’s thighs, feeling each infinitesimal movement of John’s muscles, hearing his blood rushing through his aorta, his lungs expanding right next to Sherlock’s ear...it was worth a thousand episodes of idiotic science fiction shows in order to have these uninterrupted hours of
at that, and his head thumps back against the door. "Oh, Sherlock. Me too. Oh god, I..." One hand comes up, fingers twining frantically in Sherlock’s hair as his hips pump forward against air, against nothing. Sherlock watches, John’s cock tenting the front of his jeans, those muscular hips rutting, looking for the press of Sherlock against him. Sherlock slips an arm slowly between them and palms John hard, watches John’s face go slack, eyes fluttering shut, as he thrusts his cock against Sherlock’s hand.
“Good. There’s coffee and cold ham on the table, if you’re hungry.” He shook his paper, obstinately ignoring my advances, which he knew drove me completely round the twist.
John tightens his elbow against Sherlock’s back and pulls lightly at his hair, eliciting a breathy gasp from Sherlock. “Nope. You’re staying put. You need to rest, too.”
That blood running over Sherlock's arm, though. He couldn’t stop wanting it, wanting to taste it, smear it in his mouth, over his face. It awakened something in him that he was afraid he couldn't control. He drew in a long breath, tried to count down from ten to calm himself. Tore the gloves off his hands, and dug into his palms with his nails to try and focus.
“See?” The man opens the wallet to a wad of fivers and Sherlock’s both placated and revolted, because now he must. Must follow through.
“Leave a mark. You can. I want you to. God, you’re so fucking gorgeous. You have no idea what you look like right now.” John drags a finger over those puffy lips, and they’re burning hot. Hot from John’s teeth sinking into them, from his tongue lapping at them.
Then there are soft lips on his neck, and John's fingers stroking methodically through his hair. "Hey. I've got you. I've got you. It's okay, Sherlock."
John can’t seem to finish saying what exactly Sherlock is, as he deftly unbuttons the top button of Sherlock’s pants and lays a flat palm against the delicate skin of Sherlock’s lower belly. He rubs a slow purposeful circle, pinky brushing teasingly against wispy black curls. His eyes the colour of slate on a winter morning, John looks down at him with a gaze so loving, so soft, that it makes Sherlock’s chest feel tight.
. Not just himself and John, but now Mrs Hudson. In four days, he's gone from being a solitary street kid, to having two people who care about him, a place to live, and some kind of hope for his future. It's nothing short of miraculous.
I opened my eyes, watching John as he watched me, his eyes dark, heavy with desire, the tip of his tongue caught between the ridges of his teeth. He reminded me of a predatory animal, quiet and coiled, ready to spring. I leaned forward, the whole of my body drawn into his sphere as the moon is to the earth, and braced myself against his sturdy chest with bent arms. My hands naturally came to rest against the sides of his face, and I stroked the roughness of his early evening stubble. He tipped his chin up invitingly and I lowered my face to his, not quite kissing him, but just rubbing our open mouths together. He huffed a harsh breath and licked soft and slow at the inside of my upper lip.
Another sad, empty interaction in a world of them. Really, what was the point of trying to be a decent human being? No one noticed anyway. No one recognised humanity in anyone else; they were too busy living out their own tragedies.
“I missed yours.” John drops relieved kisses into Sherlock’s hair, over and over, his arms reflexively tightening around Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock’s fingers dance over the hem of John’s shirt, slipping dextrously under the worn cotton and brushing rhythmically against John’s belly. “Mmm. That feels good.”
“I will never again leave you, John Watson. I promise you that.” Sherlock shrugged off the Belstaff and laid it across John’s clothes in the armchair. He pulled off his boots, and hesitantly put a knee onto the edge of the bed. “Are you absolutely sure I won’t hurt you?”
Sherlock is nearly undone right then, the searing desire and playful affection in John’s eyes cracking him apart inside. He presses his mouth against John’s, licking at the seam of his closed lips, and John opens them immediately, sliding his tongue against Sherlock’s and licking, licking desperately into his mouth, making harsh bitten off little noises. John’s body hitches forward, and his cock nudges against Sherlock’s, which is jutting obscenely out of his unzipped jeans.
The rhythmic clench of John’s muscles around his tongue is achingly erotic. He tastes like musk and sweat and candy floss, and suddenly, even while he’s damn near incinerating with lust, he has to stifle a laugh.
Christ, I can’t - I have to -” John takes hold of Sherlock’s hip with his come-slick hand and yanks him backward, giving in to the spiraling tension in his belly and just thrusting into him as hard as he can.
“Good.” The timbre of John’s voice has dropped, honey-sweet and dark. It makes Sherlock shiver. “I want - want to. Can I - can we - before we have to go, I just want to.”
He pulls John into the queue, tugs him flush up against him and twitches his hips in a little circle. John flushes and drapes his arms around Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock settles his hands right above John’s arse, nestled comfortably in the small of his back.
“Alright. I’ll behave. But in and out, alright? None of this hanging about and chatting bullshit.” John’s become increasingly more physically imposing as they’ve walked. His shoulders more square, his jaw jutting forward, fists clenching.
Sherlock slithers carefully out of John’s embrace, and turns to look at his sleeping lover?boyfriend?partner?
He took John’s face between both his hands and leaned forward until their noses were almost touching. John’s eyes shifted away, and Sherlock tightened his grip on his head, digging his fingertips into John’s scalp just enough to get his attention.
“Merlot alright? I know it’s not your favourite, but the only other we have is pinot grigio and that’s too light for pasta.”
