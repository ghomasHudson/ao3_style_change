Steve's plan for the day had mainly revolved around having a proper chat with Tony, and then winging it from there. He still hadn't found Tony, and had no idea where to look for him, either. Clearly, he'd need to change his approach.
"And did you get a location yet?" Steve asked, leaning over the table, literally on the edge of his seat.
It was as if the temperature in the room had suddenly dropped a few degrees, a tangible tension hanging in the air, and Steve had no idea why.
"None of that was your fault." Steve was surprised to hear Tony had even thought that, the carefree young man that he'd been. Then again, their last conversation had already told Steve that he'd misread Tony on many things.
"Let's go, then," Bucky said. He helped Stark to the awaiting dinosaur's back, spending a precious minute to make sure he was seated there securely and not about to pass out that instant. Then, Bucky jogged to the door to twist the heavy wheel that unlocked it.
Steve had handed her over to the NYPD after they'd escaped the flames. The police were going to arrange some kind of witness protection for her, since it was possible the mob might come looking for her again. Considering how last night's confrontation had ended, though, Steve suspected the Kingpin would deem the whole thing more trouble than it was worth, and focus his resources on something else.
As far as he could tell, there was nothing in particular that would've kept this hollow cool amidst the blaze, and yet, it didn't seem as badly burned as most of the rest. Tony must've gotten incredibly lucky.
On some days, he was accompanied by local engineers and scientists. Those were his least favorite days, because he had to be careful about what he was doing, just in case they were smart enough to suspect duplicity. When they asked him what he was building, he told them a half-truth.
That sounded like one potential explanation for why the word had been in the note Tony had dropped, and yet, it still didn't make any sense. What did ancient ruins in Central America have to do with a warehouse fire in Brooklyn?
"Take it easy, Mr. Rogers. You've been in storage for some time," a voice he didn't recognize spoke up to his left.
Tony ignores the implicit jab about size, which is entirely unfounded anyway and doesn't merit a reply. "Of this affront to good taste? Hardly."
After a moment of charged silence, Tony spoke up. "So, uh. There was actually another reason I wanted to stay. Something I wanted to talk about," he began, then stopped, hesitating.
The guard's alarm call had felt like it had lasted for a long time, but in reality, Steve had reacted right away, and it couldn't have been more than a few seconds. The guards elsewhere in the town might not have heard it, and in any case, they'd need time to figure out where it had come from.
His mind keeps wandering to Tony. Is he trying to sleep as well? Has he found shelter? Has he found food, or is he as hungry as Steve is?
"Yes, and I'm not proud of that, but we had to test it! Otherwise we wouldn't have found out if it worked," Maya said defensively.
"Probably better than some cheap hired muscle off the streets, boss," Happy cut in. He'd spent most of the conversation standing quietly to the side, so that Steve had nearly forgotten he was there.
Straying further from the hut doesn't seem like a good idea, and Steve knows that his chances of accidentally coming across Tony are slim.
Less than an hour later, he was sitting in the living room of her stylish apartment near Madison Square, drinking coffee. Luckily, his curiosity over what she might have to say was enough to hold back the lingering memory of his dreams.
Bucky raised his eyebrows at her in surprise. Coming from someone who'd spoken up against unnecessary cruelty less than an hour ago, that was decidedly ruthless.
"So, are we agreed that I'm not working for whoever you're worried about?" Steve checked as they pulled apart.
Steve lingered at the site of the fire until he was sure he'd learned absolutely everything there was to know about it. There were no additional revelations. The FDNY managed to get the fire under control, but as with the previous fires, the investigation concerning how it had started would take much longer, and he'd have to wait several days for even the preliminary report.
With that thought planted in his head, the next time Tony ventures outside the mansion for a charity gala, he does ask Steve to accompany him.
Luckily, he had the exercise regime he'd set up to keep him occupied. The familiarity of it, the physical work and the challenges of training with some of Wakanda's finest were nearly enough to take his mind off what he'd learned.
Hammer wore expensive clothing, a conventionally handsome frame which Steve assumed was a customized clone, and glasses that had to be an accessory, because surely he wouldn't allow actual imperfections in his sight. He seemed like someone who was desperate to replicate Tony's cool persona, but fell slightly short. The end result was forced, awkward and sleazy instead.
Hammer and his troupe had hit the floor on the other side of the table, though one of his assistants hadn't been as lucky as everyone else: Noa was lying on the ground curled up on his side, a growing pool of blood on the floor beneath him.
Had Tony been anyone else, Steve would've protested loudly at his coddling. He would've insisted that he was fine and pushed away the blanket, as soothing as it was, and pointed out that what he lacked in physical strength, he made up for in strength of character. He might have added that although his slender frame and youthful looks often had people mistaking him for a kid half his age, he wasn't easily frightened. To further emphasize his words, he might even have refused the offer of a shoulder to lean on, as much as he enjoyed the safe feeling of another body so close to his.
"They wanted to get rid of me," Steve went on. "They set me up. Me and my team." He stopped, the memory of his last moments taking over his mind. Bucky falling. Dum Dum and Morita bleeding on the ground. Rumlow looming over him. "What happened to them? Did they survive? What about Peggy?"
Bucky closed his book and sat up straight in his chair. "Okay. So. That survivor from yesterday's fire? He's gone."
Pepper took a moment before she answered, glancing at her coffee, her expression distant. "Yes and no. See, we're used to these kinds of trips having unexpected twists and turns, and dangers lurking behind every corner. In that sense, this was perfectly ordinary. We went looking for a temple based on some recent research, and met some challenges. A competing team, booby traps, the usual, really, but this time, it got very bad. The ruins collapsed. Tony was stuck in the middle of it, separated from the rest of us. We feared we might've lost him, for a while there, but in the end, he made it out in one piece."
Since Steve's vantage point on the hill has given him no obvious destination to aim for, he decides to head for another, even higher, hill that stands above all the others nearby. It's not too far away; he figures he can reach the top before it gets too dark. He takes off at a jog to stay warm.
Even though Yinsen uses his dying words to declare that he made his own choices and didn't expect to survive, Tony still feels terrible. This makes Yinsen the second person who's sacrificed their life to save Tony.
“He’s fine. I’m still waiting for the latest blood work for the both of you, but I think you’re in the clear," Bruce answered, his posture relaxing slightly, lips turning to a cautious smile. "How do you feel?”
Hammer must've given a discrete gesture or messaged them somehow, because the next moment, a group of waiters approached to pour them wine. They were dressed in a classic vintage style, with white shirts and black trousers and vests—and, of course, matching frames that looked pretty, but natural and unmodified, unlike the entourage Hammer had brought.
"A regular beer for Mr. Two Hundred," the bartender muttered, but grabbed a glass to pour the drink anyway. "That'll be five," he added.
"You don't know what you'll face there, and we can't trust Ultron," Natasha pointed out. "He might try to trap you in VR, too."
There were two more places on the list Steve had gotten from the policemen. He'd been planning on visiting those tonight as well, but he ended up lingering at the Groggy Cod for longer than he'd intended to, in case Tony should return. Eventually, past eleven, after several drinks and all too many useless conversations, he finally decided to let it go for the day, and headed home.
It was a terrifying thought, not having any control over what you were doing, and having to piece it together afterwards. "I know something about learning to accept big changes, about becoming someone different and having to rethink your entire life, but what I've faced has been much easier than what you're struggling with," Steve said. "It must be scary."
In his exhausted, barely coherent mind, he thought she must've lost it completely. They were on the 194th floor. Steve might not have felt unnerved about jumping out of a cab at around the 50th, but this was a whole lot higher, and as far as he could tell, they had no anti-gravity gear.
Occasionally, he glances in the direction where he last spotted Steve. Once, he thinks he sees a figure on a hill in the distance. He wonders if Steve is still stalking him. It would be hilarious if Steve were as obsessed with him as he is with Steve, but that's probably just wishful thinking on his part.
"Oh. It's." Steve began, pausing to think back to his own first swap. "My first time was back when I was still in training, and I was so nervous. I was worried the transfer would go wrong somehow, or that it would go fine but I wouldn't be able to cope with how weird it was. That's rare, but it sometimes happens. I was afraid I'd die. I was afraid something would happen to my birth body while I wasn't using it. I was afraid I'd be kicked out of SHIELD if I failed, somehow."
He could stay and attempt to catch more fish. That might be smart. He doesn't know when he'll next come across a body of water large enough for fishing. Then again, if he makes it to that hut today, the food situation might solve itself. He's counting on that.
Tony decided to risk another try, opened his eyes, and leaned slowly towards the table, where the screen had lit up with the assorted files he'd asked for: several chains of emails with the gene therapy R&D people, a few plain text ones with DNA sequences, and the preliminary, proof of concept test results. That should be all he needed. It'd just be a matter of turning the plans into reality. Back when he'd been researching this, the people he'd talked to had assured him the wetlab work would be simple to implement. All they needed was a target sequence, and as of last night, he had one.
Now that he's stopped for a moment, with nothing to do but wait, Steve can no longer escape all the emotions he's mostly kept in check since he realized that Tony has a fighting chance to make it out of here. He's beyond concerned—he's downright terrified that what he's done isn't enough, and Tony will die. After the despair and renewed hope he's gone through over the past few hours, the thought that he might still lose Tony is unbearable.
"I don't mind a few secrets, if you don't," Steve lied. "You've been good to me. Let me return the favor. I'm sure it'll be all right. If it's not, we'll stop."
"I know we usually don't, but what would you say if I stuck around tonight? I feel like I shouldn't leave you alone after that," Tony offered, sounding uncharacteristically timid. He'd definitely been frightened.
"And you may well need to face both if you join this team. It's going to be dangerous, and getting as far inland as you need to go will require stealth and skill," she warned him.
Luckily, going by the android's lack of response, it's either shut down entirely, or very badly damaged. That makes things a lot easier for him.
"Just so you know, I didn't take his money. He gave it to me, in exchange for handing this to you," the receptionist said, his tone defensive, although Steve hadn't even touched the wallet yet. "I've got to say, he seemed like a man on his way to the gallows."
"Jarvis?" Tony turned his head to face the familiar features of his oldest friend. "How are you here?" It was nice to be able to talk properly again, even if it sounded weak and breathy in his ears.
Oddly enough, when Steve meets the nurse at the ward, she raises her eyebrows at him. "So, you're the man he was asking about."
"It's not the same, and Pepper did most of the work," Tony insisted. "How is she, anyway? And the others? I know Jarvis hit the self destruct button, and you said Rhodey was injured."
Steve considered bringing up Maya's name as well, but that would link him to the fires and the events around Tony, and might make him suspicious. Better not. "You find who you're looking for yet?" he asked instead.
It wasn't all those combined sensations of hands on his cock and nipple and lips against his throat that did it; it was the thought that Iron Man was enjoying this as well, wanting Steve so badly he'd let go of his almost paranoid caution to give Steve this moment of pleasure—
While everyone else had followed Mona's wordless plea, freezing where they stood, stock still and silent, Stark seem to have missed it. "Let me deal with this," he said sharply, casting a glance over his shoulder, his eyes going from Rumlow to Bucky, like he was trying to figure out who was in charge.
Steve didn't fall asleep right away, of course, but when he started drifting off, he could feel Tony's body pressed against his, feel Tony's soft breaths against the back of his hand where it rested on the pillow, and the bedroom in the Tower stayed away.
When Tony finally speaks up again, it's nothing Steve could've anticipated. "Back there, after you'd found me," he begins, slowly and thoughtfully, "did you say something like this, too?"
As he starts his way up the side of the highest hill, the sun is getting closer to the horizon, signaling that the day grows late. With dusk, cooler temperatures will soon follow. He can see some clouds gathering in the distance.
"Meet Nina and Noa, my assistants for today," Hammer introduced them, placing his arms around their shoulders.
living on the Plains—that's a type of primitive horse—but so far I haven't heard of anyone training them for riding."
Things were still exactly the same as they'd been. He and the other ex-Avengers were wanted criminals. Bucky was still in suspended animation. Tony had lashed out and tried to kill him. Steve knew he hadn't been thinking straight when he'd done that, and he knew he could partly blame himself and his decision to hide the truth from Tony, but that didn't make it okay.
"No. Go away. I'm done with you." With one last, chilly glare at Steve, Tony walked to the entrance and into the cabin, slamming the door shut behind him. The sounds of locks and latches being closed followed right after.
Steve turned his back to Bruce and stepped closer to Tony, looming over him. “If I’m such a waste of space, then why did you save me? You pushed me out of the way of that slime! It’s your fault we’re both stuck in here!”
"I missed you so much," Tony said, running his fingers up and down Steve's back. "I dreamed about you. I can't believe you're really here."
"I wouldn't have let him in if he wasn't unarmed," Ultron said, sounding affronted. "No explosives, no high-energy devices, nothing out of the ordinary in full-body scans and no evidence of blocking technology. If you want a cavity search, you'll have to do that yourself, or put me in a body with a little more finesse." He finished by waving around the drones' arms.
"It was a sobering experience. It came to me that if I kept going as I had been, I'd definitely be fulfilling that prophecy of not living to be very old at all, but maybe it wasn't too late to change things. I decided to take up a strict exercise regime as soon as I'd recovered enough. It was during one of many easy walks through the park that I had the idea of tackling the great outdoors. Rhodey, who had always been more interested in the natural world, was excited to hear of my idea, and soon, we were planning our first proper trek. From the start, there was the thought at the back of my mind that maybe there was a solution somewhere out there, some way to escape my fate.
Steve couldn't deny that he was a little hungry and thirsty, and felt like he could use a shower after the hours he'd spent on the road, but none of those things were currently on top of his mind. "What if I said the thing I want most is right here in front of me?" Steve returned. With Tony having backed away, Steve's hands had ended up on his biceps, and he tightened his hold of them to emphasize his words.
"Do you know if, by any chance, Tony was at a party Miss van Dyne threw five days ago?" Steve tried.
Unsure what to expect, but cautiously hopeful, he follows the nurse to Tony's room. Even if what Steve has heard about Tony's recovery has been reassuring, seeing him is far less so. He seems to be sleeping, and with his eyes closed and his face as white as a sheet, he doesn't look so different from how he did in the hut. The assortment of tubes, wires and monitoring equipment works to underline that while he's no longer in the wilderness, he's not out of the woods yet.
Steve wouldn't have admitted it to anyone, but he was unnerved by the very idea of VR after his last two experiences. He wondered if the technician noticed how his hands were shaking and how he was struggling to keep his breathing in check when he settled into one of the visitor VR suites.
Natasha made a face, not looking entirely reassured. "What's important is, I know a lot about the North, and who holds power over there."
Tony had been lost in the multiverse. Even with all the combined scientific and magical knowledge of the Avengers and their friends, they had't been able to come up with a way of tracing him, but that had now changed. The thread that connected them would span across all that distance, linking them together, and surely, they could use that to locate Tony. That fine filament, spun from the strength of their love, could bring them back together again.
"That first time we met, I wasn't even looking for you. It was pure chance that we crossed paths," Steve said, slowly, considering each phrase. "The second time, at the inn, that was on purpose. I found out where you were, and decided to come to you without the costume, since you didn't want to talk to Cap. But I really wasn't expecting the rest of it."
"I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere," Steve said, sliding his hand to Tony's back and pulling him closer.
His eyelids closed in spite of his struggles. He was just too tired and hurting too much; he knew he shouldn't sleep, but he also wanted that more than anything.
The instant the door to Steve's apartment had closed behind them, Tony's hands were on him, grabbing the lapels of his jacket. Steve obliged, shrugging his shoulders so Tony could work it off and drop it on the floor. He moved on to unzipping Steve's shirt, and tossed that aside, too.
"They rescued me from the sea. I wouldn't be alive without them," Bucky said. That was what he'd kept telling himself in his moments of doubt; surely they had to be good to have done all that for him.
"They have him," Natasha told him before he'd even asked, no doubt guessing that he was desperate for news.
"That so?" Tony quirked an eyebrow, his lips turning to a grin again. "Well, Steve, how about I buy you a drink, then?"
He tried to convince himself that Tony was lying to him to throw him off balance for some reason, but he couldn't imagine what that reason might be. Tony hadn't stopped him from breaking the other Avengers out of prison. He could've. Tony hadn't come looking for him. No matter how good Wakanda's defenses were, Steve was pretty sure Tony could've found him, if he'd really wanted to. There weren't many things Tony couldn't do if he set his mind on it. That was one of the reasons why Steve had always been so impressed by him.
Steve didn't want to tell Jarvis about the note, since he wasn't sure he could trust him. "I don't know yet. Anyway, that was all I had in mind, for now," he said. He then pulled one of his cards out of his pocket to offer it to Jarvis. It had his official Captain America phone number on it, the one he only gave out in special circumstances. He figured this counted as one. "Could you tell Mr. Stark to call me once he gets home?"
Steve finished his visit to the university by taking a look at Maya's office. Although that told him a lot about her—for example, that she was very neat and organized, and seemed to work specifically on translating ancient languages—he didn't learn anything more to further the investigation.
"Can you tell me more about the expedition? Miss van Dyne mentioned it, but she didn't know any details. Anything out of the usual about it?"
Steve hesitates, glancing at Tony, clearly waiting to see if Tony will counteract the command. He's hard-coded to obey all humans, but Tony is his registered owner and comes first in the priority queue. Since it's obvious Obie wants Steve out of the room to continue the conversation without him overhearing it, Tony lets the order stand.
The door remained stubbornly shut when the first enemies showed up. There were just two of them, and Steve and Sam took them down fast, before they had the time to shout out any warnings.
"He might well have been. I don't know. As I said, I'm not his chaperone. Is that all?" The glum look on Jarvis's face suggested that it had better be.
"Are you okay, Steve?" Bucky asked him discreetly, leaning closer to his seat. "You really do seem sulky today."
"Not a clue," the man said curtly. "I'm not his butler, nor his chaperone, like plenty of people seem to think. Sometimes, him included."
Tony knew Steve had never left the planet while in a frame; every time he'd ventured to other places in the solar system, it had been as a data transfer to an awaiting frame elsewhere. Physical travel was far too slow to be practical for SHIELD's missions. He couldn't imagine he and Tony would have the time to spare in the foreseeable future, either, not with everything they'd have to deal with. Still, he said, "Never tried it. Definitely wouldn't mind."
Steve looked up, his eyes meeting Sam's, who was clearly curious, but had stayed to the side instead of trying to read the letter over his shoulder.
"I don't know about that. I'm really not on course now. More like drifting," Steve says, his voice wavering. "Something's wrong with me, I can feel it. Too many things in my head, so many conflicts, all these signals that make no sense."
Rhodes must've made arrangements for Steve's arrival, because instead of a group of costumed superheroes or armed guards, all that awaited him at the Avengers compound was Rhodes himself.
When he opened his eyes again, more capable of focusing on what was around him, he realized that the restraints around his wrists and ankles had changed. He was still tied to bed, but instead of metal cuffs there was soft rope, the kind he might expect to see in the bedroom.
Wide awake now, Tony gets up. He's wearing a tank top that reveals the thirium reactor, so he grabs a bathrobe to cover it before heading upstairs to meet the CyberLife missionary.
"Works for me. Hands up," Steve ordered Tony, who obeyed, letting go of Steve's pants so Steve could strip his upper body. "You're beautiful," Steve told him.
"They wanted to come," Jarvis explained as they climbed the stairs up to their floor. "I told them no. I know Tony wouldn't want them to. It's too dangerous. The Northerners hate dinosaurs and wouldn't hesitate to hurt them."
"I agree." It was a great feeling to be finally out of the costume, rid of the background guilt of wearing it and the restrictive fabric holding back his cock.
"As of one hour ago," Natasha confirmed. "I came as soon as I could. I tried to call you earlier, but you didn't pick up."
Steve doesn't answer that right away, a thoughtful look passing across his face, his LED flashing yellow to signal that he's using more processing power. "No, I've not been told any details," he finally answers.
In the end, his indecision about what to do rendered all his planning and thinking pointless: he ran out of time.
"It's in the past now, and I'd really like to move on." Tony tried to consciously push his acceptance and forgiveness at Steve, though he knew the synchronization didn't quite work like that. Maybe the feelings behind the ideas would at least be more obvious when he was actively focusing on them, and Steve would understand that Tony was being entirely honest about this.
He needed to tell Steve that it wasn't about hate. That he'd done it because he didn't want to spend the rest of his life pining after something he couldn't have. He didn't even know how to start.
The so-called hotel rather resembled some godforsaken highway motel. The lobby looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages, if ever, and consisted of one stretch of corridor, the reception counter, and stairs leading up. The bored-looking young lady sitting behind the counter turned a faint shade of pink when she set eyes on Steve.
"Good, because that's exactly what I want." Steve stepped closer to Tony, driving him against the closed door, going for another kiss.
"Nah. Just expected you to be somewhere miles away by now. Good thing you're not. I need to ask you for a recap, since I don't really know how I got here," Tony replies. Steve thinks he sounds weary; his voice is hoarse, and he's not speaking half as fast as usual.
Tony shifted to face Steve properly, still keeping his curled-up position, holding on to his knees with his hands. He shook his head. "You think I'll fall for that? I know you're not real. Hydra has you. Just like Obie has me. Trapped for all eternity."
Steve kisses him again. As their lips connect, a strange shiver rushes through him, radiating from Steve's hand, like a mild electric shock, or chills running down his spine, except that it's also warm. He's got goosebumps all over. He gasps into Steve's mouth and hugs him closer, clinging to this thrilling new sensation.
"Any dizziness or nausea?" Randall asked. His gaze traveled over Steve's body, from head to toe, but his eyes were unfocused. Steve guessed he was wearing some kind of diagnostic contacts, maybe interfacing with sensors built into the bed. Unlike in the small, functional rooms at SHIELD, there were no displays anywhere on the walls around them.
"Huh. I haven't thought about that at all," Steve admitted. He'd been too preoccupied with concern over Tony to think of his own frame. He'd hated the organic fake they'd put him in at first, but he was actually starting to grow used to it.
Stark muttered another word at the dinosaur, patted its beak-like snout, and returned to his collection of parts.
"That's not a gripping story, either, no great adventure. I drove myself too hard, expected my body to handle things that were too much, so that the exertion and heat and dehydration got to me. I ended up too exhausted to stay on my feet, and we had to abandon the expedition. I thought it'd pass when I got back home and had some rest, like these fits tended to. It didn't. It just got worse.
Tony blew out a breath, his shoulders sagging. "God. I'm so glad to hear that. I thought she must've drowned."
"That's a lot more difficult than it was for you," Tony said, eyeing Steve's generic clothing. "Hired muscle? You don't seem the type, but you've certainly got the biceps."
"I'll do that, but I wouldn't sit by the phone all day waiting, if I were you. There's no telling how late he'll be," Jarvis warned. Steve wondered if he might be planning on dropping the card in the nearest trash can so Tony would never even see it. Hopefully not.
"We're more alike than you're willing to admit," Steve said. "Two flawed men trying very hard to do the right thing. I'd think by now you'd have realized that I make mistakes, too. Big ones. Maybe ones that can't be forgiven and that I end up regretting for the rest of my life."
He really didn’t want to talk to Tony. The prospect terrified him. He had no idea how Tony would react when he realized what had happened, but he expected it to be bad. And that was exactly why he would sit here, wait, and face the music. Even if he hadn’t gone as far as he’d first feared, he’d still overstepped all boundaries and done things that were unacceptable and inexcusable. He owed it to Tony to at least apologize properly.
That confirmed in plain words something that Steve had been assuming all along after the rescue. "You're the ones trying to kill him."
They were very nearly done, with only the badly bent chest and back plates left to pry apart, when the mission channel came to life.
Steve leaned backwards, looking him in the eye. "I heard some people in the common room talking about the crossing, and they mentioned that it might be dangerous because of the Northerners."
James gave him a scrutinizing frown. "You do seem pale." He pulled out a pocket watch to check the time—something to set apart the North from the rest of Dinotopia, where regular timepieces were rare. "It's getting late anyway. Might as well."
On the 100th floor, Steve stepped out into a large, brightly lit landing with doors to a dozen other elevators. Some of them were public, others led to private levels only accessible by passing bio-ID scanners. The public one that ran the lowest should, according to the signs, take him to the 50th floor, so he chose that.
"Everyone else is okay. You'll see them soon," Steve assured him. "I could go and send them in, if you'd like to see them?"
Steve wished he were speaking with a person so he could at least glower at them. Trying to spot a camera in the ceiling didn't quite cut it. "So, I'm categorically banned from levels below the fiftieth in Stark Tower?"
"Is that related to last night? You're not in trouble, are you?" Steve asked, to keep the conversation on topic.
Steve met him in a spacious open living room with transparent walls that gave a direct view over the landing platform. Tony clearly hadn't wanted to look like he was twenty for the rest of his life: his current clone seemed closer to forty. He'd grown a beard and a mustache and cut his hair differently. Still, in spite of the changes, Steve would've recognized him anywhere. His eyes had not changed. They were just as huge and dark as he remembered.
Steve gave Tony's thigh a slight squeeze, to keep him close. "Sorry, I was—I'm a little overwhelmed, I guess. I didn't think I'd even find you, and, well, here we are."
Several more times, he found himself sinking into a semi-conscious daze, to be roused by Seren's increasingly agitated voice. He knew it was a losing battle; each time, it was more difficult to crawl back into wakefulness.
He wasn’t going to hold back the anger, not anymore. He might as well finally say everything that he’d kept bottled up for all those months. “You lied to me, Rogers, for years! So get off your damn high horse!”
"So, I'm thinking," Tony said, his tone hesitant, his eyes on the tie except for the occasional glance at Steve's face. "Like I've said, things are really complicated for me right now, and I've got to try and do something about that. I'm not sure how it'll go, or how long it'll take. But, you know, in case I actually, eventually get out of this mess, is there any chance we could meet again?"
“Not the word I’d use,” Steve said, raising a hand to Tony’s face, brushing his thumb over his cheek. “But I’m glad it’s not worse.”
There was a sound of slow clapping at the door to the bedroom, and as Steve turned his head, he saw Tony approach. "Well done, Steve. You catch on quickly."
Steve's meeting with the NYPD was as fruitless as he'd expected: their technicians were still picking around the remains of Hammer's rogue drone, and aside from that, the investigation was at a standstill. Steve thanked Coulson for his time and asked the station AI to call him a cab.
Whether or not JARVIS thinks androids are somehow his kin, he won't judge Tony for placing his own life above one of theirs. Definitely not when it wasn't even certain that the android in question could be repaired. Looking at statistical probabilities, Tony thinks he was the more likely out of the two of them to make it out of that cave alive.
They didn't have time for this. Trying to run out with drones firing from both sides would probably get them all killed. Steve considered turning over the table and using it for cover, but it was cumbersomely large, and could only offer protection from one side. It would be stupidly risky, when there was a much simpler way out of this situation.
What follows is a day that keeps giving Tony emotional whiplash. He's stuck between awe over how lifelike and how brilliant Steve is, and the regret and self-loathing that only grows deeper the better he learns to know Steve. Instead of telling Steve the truth, like he should, he gives him an overview of his daily life and a detailed tour of the mansion.
"Yes. The tracker's offline for good, and Jarvis says your node is unharmed," Pepper told him. She was smiling, though aside from that, her face looked pinched with concern. "How do you feel?"
"Stark! I thought you were a man of your word," the metal-armed Northerner shouted after him, voice accusing. "You promised to come with us."
This was an unusual morning in many ways. They were in no hurry, camping safely on friendly territory, only a short day's march away from where they were set to rendezvous with an operative Fury had sent. Tony allowed himself the luxury of lingering where he was a little longer, brushing aside the fine strands of golden hair on Steve's forehead, and that was how Steve finally came around, blinking open his clear blue eyes, giving Tony a sleepy smile that warmed him through and through.
Snooping around the building was unlikely to gain him anything. Whatever those corrupt politicians might be up to, they were doing it behind the scenes, and they wouldn't leave clues lying around.
"What I take from all this is that we should probably accept Pierce's offer," Tony concluded, looking around the table to meet everyone's eyes.
With Steve around to take care of the practical details while Pepper handles the business side of things, Tony's day-to-day life runs more smoothly than it ever has. The arrangement isn't without its drawbacks, though. For example, instead of having a loud JARVIS and an angry Pepper hounding him out of bed, he now gets Steve who, with minimal warning, will haul Tony to his feet and half carry him to the bathroom. Even if it's kind of hot that Steve can manhandle him so easily—and seems to have no compunction about doing so—it's not exactly an ideal wake-up.
The awful truth was, with the best simulations being as perfect as they were, there was no trick to it, no way to know for sure what was virtual and what wasn't, not without outside interference or some lucky, revealing flaw in the scenario. If Steve thought about it too hard, he might end up doubting everything, too. Who was to say that any of what he'd experienced in this future was real? For all he knew, he might be in some simulation set up by Hydra. But there was no point in dwelling on that.
When they finally let go, after what felt like several minutes, Tony was panting again, making Steve feel breathless, in a good way.
"Okay. Here's the thing," Tony said, hands clasped on his lap, palms up, twiddling his laced fingers nervously. "Everything that I said back then, that's still on the table. A relationship. A real one. Dinner dates and all. It wouldn't be easy. I may look pretty in this shiny young frame, but seriously, I'm still a mess, and I'm not sure there are enough shrinks in the world to fix that. There's a whole shitstorm waiting for me out there once I leave this room, and I know you've got your own quest to go on, your surviving teammates hiding away, and I—"
Tony gave him a sly look. "You might regret saying that." He patted at the seat next to him, climbing down to the floor himself.
“Yeah, you don’t need to tell me that,” Tony said. He rested a hand below the bruising and took a deeper breath, which instantly turned into a gasp. “You’ll want to poke at it, won’t you?”
Stane stepped closer, leaning over Steve. "You're delusional," he said, his hand reaching at the chair assembly behind Steve's head. Whatever he was grabbing for, it wouldn't be good—either the VR electrodes, or a sedative first, to make him easier to handle.
"I'll be sure to keep that in mind in case I ever get really desperate," Kamski says condescendingly.
Steve was up to his neck in this now, anyway. Walking away wouldn't undo what had already happened between them. He might as well see this to the end.
Steve was all too aware of that, but he couldn't see what else he could do. He glanced towards the doorway, and like she'd promised, it was now shimmering and outlined in glowing golden light, a portal to take them back to the real world. He could just grab Tony and carry him out—but with Natasha's earlier warning that Tony should go willingly, that was probably a bad plan.
Steve leaned back on the couch, trying not to get riled up. If he'd questioned for one moment whether this person was really Tony, there was no uncertainty left in his mind anymore. Few people had ever been able to get under his skin as fast.
"All she wanted was to discuss a few more details about tomorrow. Strictly business. Now I'm all yours, " Steve said. He managed a smile, though it didn't feel natural at all. He certainly wouldn't use this frame for any kind of a covert operation.
He'd figured out what the message said, but it still made no sense. He wasn't a match with Tony. They weren't soulmates. He'd had that checked. Why would Tony be doing this? To mess up with him and make him feel bad? Steve didn't think he'd be that petty, even if they were far from being on friendly terms.
Since this was a complete shot in the dark, he could only try to guess what the dosage should be. He'd given it plenty of thought over the past two days, going over previous research, and decided to follow the original Extremis protocol. That meant serial injections adding up to a considerably higher dose than what the ongoing gene therapy experiments were using, but those tended to be targeted at some specific tissue. This wasn't. He needed to make sure he'd saturate his entire system with the Exvec construct, or it might not be enough.
Pepper Potts stood next to him, her business clothes as stylish as ever, but her hair askew. Behind her, prone on the ground, lay the large gray figure of one of Ultron's drones.
Stark didn't switch languages when he answered, making Bucky realize that he was probably doing this to include the dinosaur in the conversation. "Once I start the timer," Stark explained, every few words cut off by a gulp of air, "we'll have around five minutes."
Bucky really had made the right choice. It was a sobering thought that if he had waited until the morning, he might never have learned any of this.
"No, normally it wouldn't be. Your case is more complicated. You were severely punished for conspiring against SHIELD. From what I understood, they granted the rights to Mr. Stark for the purposes of putting you in a new frame," she explained.
Steve lets Tony's hand slip from his grasp. "Was that too much?" he asks timidly. "I didn't mean to overstep."
Finally, to Bucky's profound relief, Stark began to stir, coughing, his eyelids fluttering—and then, he rasped out the very last word Bucky would've expected to hear.
They stepped out and walked across a short stretch of corridor to Peggy's spacious office. She didn't say another word until she'd sat down behind her desk and placed a small round device with a few blinking blue lights in front of her. A jamming field generator.
"What's a cow?" Alban asked back, reminding Bucky that most of the animals he was familiar with didn't exist on the island. The farms around the town had herds of mammals that he thought of as cows, but they weren't actually the same species at all.
"All right. I'm not going to rule anything out at this point, but let's stick to a single-assassin hypothesis for now," Steve agreed. "So, what about your assistants? Either of them at the VR salon with you?"
"And switched careers to the NYPD?" Steve checked, though he was less interested in Fury's personal history and more in what he'd found out.
Jarvis was looking as grim as Steve felt next to him, but he'd still politely raised his hand to ask for his turn. "I don't know what hearsay you're basing that on. I've spoken to one of the leaders of the convoy, and she made it absolutely clear that he surrendered to protect everyone else in the group. That's exactly the kind of thing he would do, giving himself up to make sure no one else is hurt."
Steve's eyes caught something at the bottom of the hollow that stood out among the debris: a scrap of paper, its edges singed and curled up. He bent down to reach for it. There was barely enough room for his upper body between the beams, but he managed to fish out what looked like the remains of a note of some kind, or maybe a letter. For it to end up where it'd been, Steve was willing to bet it'd been in Tony's pocket, and maybe his body had partially protected it from the flames. As it was, most of it had still burned away. Steve couldn't even say for sure what size the original sheet of paper might've been. The remaining text was smeared beyond legibility, except for one word written in a neat hand: "Maya."
Aside from Stane, and another two drones on standby a few meters behind him, the large living room stretching out behind him was empty; no sign of Natasha anywhere. Stane probably didn't trust her enough to let her know Steve was here. Of course, officially, she didn't know Tony was here either, because she wasn't even supposed to know that Stane wasn't really Tony.
She was the kind of person he could see himself spending the rest of his life with. He'd never want to have a casual thing with her, like this friends-with-benefits situation he had with Tony. He couldn't deny that he was a romantic, deep down, and the fact that Tony didn't really feel anything for him left him craving more. Of course, it wasn't as if Steve was madly in love with Tony, either. Maybe he would've liked to call it a proper relationship, but he couldn't imagine it ever becoming a serious one. Tony was attractive and probably smarter than either Steve or Peggy, but he was also shallow and irresponsible. The ideals that Steve strove towards weren't something Tony cared about.
Tony thinks he's hallucinating with the lack of oxygen, at first, because his vision is starting to fade at the edges and what he's seeing shouldn't be possible.
With the sun low on the horizon, the track finally curved past a mailbox on a crooked post to end in front of a small, ramshackle cabin that couldn't have been more different from Tony's home in NYC. Though the building was decrepit, its location was picturesque: it sat close to the shore of a placid lake, surrounded by beech and aspen trees, with the fresh green of budding leaves dotting their branches.
"I do. I really do," Steve told him, and that was the complete and honest truth, God help him. He pushed aside his half-finished beer and untangled their legs, getting ready to stand up. "Shall we?"
"Noted," Steve says, but he still seems unimpressed. "I just find that with her qualifications, she should have work with challenges to match. It makes more sense."
"It's not a story," a bald man dressed in a slightly rumpled suit spoke up. "I saw that too, but I don't think he was flying, I think he fell. From one of the windows."
This frame wasn't quite as exaggerated in the size department as the synthetic Steve had died in, but was definitely still on the large end of the spectrum. That probably made sense, if it had been grown following some standard template at this overly luxurious clinic—those billionaires would want to be impressive—but that was absolutely not what he should be thinking about right now.
"All right. Thank you." Steve bent closer and pressed a kiss on Tony's forehead. If Bucky had needed further proof of their closeness, it was right there.
He'd already gathered that Tony was a very different person from the one he'd known in the past, but if Tony had wanted to harm him, why bring him out of storage at all? Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him there, and then let the unsavory people currently running SHIELD take care of him?
The odd thing was, this coincidence seemed to be just as upsetting to Stark. He straightened up against the wall, his eyes wide, any trace of drowsiness gone from his face. "You—oh, God. I should've—You're Bucky, aren't you?"
He landed face-down on the concrete, though he couldn't feel the impact through the pain overwhelming his synthetic nerves. He couldn't see or hear a thing; it was like a terrible mirror image of what he'd experienced last night.
The more prudent course of action would've been to leave Tromsø behind right away. He doesn't have a truly pressing reason to stick around. There's nothing more he can do for Tony. And yet—he can't leave before he's sure that Tony's going to be okay, and he really, really needs to try to have a proper conversation with him, face-to-face.
"Tony! We've got NYPD police cars on the landing platform," Ultron announced, the voice ringing loud and urgent through the room's speakers. It took Steve a moment to realize the AI was addressing Stane, using the false name like he was programmed to.
He was itching for a drink, but even he wasn't quite reckless enough to add alcohol to the mix while subjecting himself to an unprecedented genetics experiment. He tried to distract himself with armor upgrade ideas, instead, but it wasn't working; his mind kept going back to all the times he'd fought side by side with Steve while wearing the armor, and the way he'd felt Steve's presence when he'd taken the helmet off.
The place looked like a scene from the war, Steve thought. Almost like someone had dropped a napalm bomb on the building. He could only guess at what it might've been like when it'd been still standing, earlier on the very same day: a small warehouse, mostly built of wood, with a corrugated iron roof. Now, there wasn't as much as a single section of wall left upright. It was a mess of rubble, pieces of burned timber and bent, blackened metal. Here and there, the rubble glistened with moisture, thanks to the FDNY's efforts to control the fire, but he could also see smoke rising from several spots. The firemen had said there would probably be areas left that were smouldering, and warned Steve to be careful, but they hadn't stopped him. Captain America tended to be given a lot of leeway when it came to such things.
Steve realized he had been quiet for a moment, except for a few low hums of pleasure, maybe not giving the right idea of how much he was enjoying this. He'd never been particularly vocal or loud in bed. "Yeah, just like that," he coaxed. "Exactly like that. Don't stop."
"They've already killed you three times. And it'd be four if I hadn't saved you at the 201," Steve reminded him. "I can solve this problem for you. No more murders."
Pepper had already been on the list of suspects because she was one of the few people with the access privileges to plant a bomb on Tony's limo. If Steve told Tony of this added reason to suspect her, he would suspend her instantly. But Pepper felt like the closest thing to an ally that Steve had; she was the only person who'd known Tony for a long time, including back when he'd been different. Going by her cryptic comments, she seemed to understand what was going on with him far better than Steve did. He didn't want to lose that. In fact, Steve had to admit that he currently liked her more than Tony. He decided that unless he found something more incriminating than a single passing touch, he wouldn't mention this to Tony.
The dinosaur heeded his words, chasing after him, moving fast for a being whose footfalls were heavy enough to make the stone floor tremble. It was quite a sight to behold, Bucky thought as he glanced over his shoulder, seeing Stark on the dinosaur's back, clinging to the colorful crest.
Steve, of course, announces that he wants to join the fight as soon as he learns of it. He's spent too many years witnessing his fellow androids being mistreated by humans. The only reason he's not taken the initiative himself to do anything about that is that he and Tony haven't been able to confirm if other models are capable of the same kind of awakening that Steve went through. Now, with the news stories of deviants breaking their programming, going on the run and organizing protests and marches, they have all the evidence they could ask for.
Those five minutes seemed to take at least ten times as long. Steve drank half his water, walked over to the vending machines to see if there was anything he might like to eat, and decided there wasn't. Just as he got back to the table, Natasha spoke up again.
"It's not something else. I felt it, Pepper." Tony tapped at the arc reactor. "There's no other explanation, no matter how much I'd like to have one. Which is exactly why I'm not going to get it tested. You know I couldn't do that without his consent, which would mean talking to him about it. Nope. No way."
"Why, we came to rescue you, of course," Jarvis said, like that was the most obvious thing in the world.
Before Tony had let his hand down, Steve captured it between both of his. "That definitely looked like you've learned a thing or two."
It was utterly incomprehensible to Steve how Tony could have been capable of the horrific things for which he was the prime suspect—but except for Steve's gut feeling saying that it couldn't be true, everything else seemed to add up, all the clues pointing at Tony.
"Costs of repairs will be subtracted from your personal account," the cab was telling him. "The authorities will be contacted regarding this act of vandalism!"
He'd taken the elevator to the entrance floor and stepped out of it, just out of habit, before it came to him that he didn't actually know what he was going to do next. He felt like he should take action, somehow, but it was a pre-mission night and he only had thirteen hours before they'd head out. Eleven before he needed to be back at HQ to get ready. There wasn't a whole lot he could do right now. His team members were out spending their night off in whichever way they saw fit, and even if they hadn't been out of reach, he wasn't about to break his promise about not discussing the details of what he'd heard with anyone.
"How can you expect me to believe a word you're saying anymore?" Tony snarled. It was only fair of him. Steve had lied and deceived him just as many times as Maya had.
Steve closed his eyes and leaned the back of his head against the wall behind him, the bruises at his neck protesting as he did. Tony wanted to kill the man who'd supplanted him. Tony had recruited Pepper to convince Stane to bring Steve out of storage.
He realized this gave him an opportunity for some snooping that he'd been considering earlier. After the amazing night, it felt even worse to do things behind Tony's back, but then again, Tony was also keeping things from him. They'd even talked about this and accepted it.
For now, he seems to be alone. There's a window nearby, but the blinds are closed, so he has no idea what the view is like. The sunlight seeping through the seams doesn't mean much regarding the time of the day, since the sun doesn't really set at all up in the north. Assuming that's where he is. Nothing around him gives him any clues regarding that, either.
"And what's to stop me from solving my problem by just killing both you and him?" Stane said, still not using Tony's name.
"No!" Tony says. Too fast, too defensive. "He—it was inactive when I found it. I never even got to talk to it, and it saved my life. Come on, Elijah. You can't have many models with specs like these that aren't in the catalogue."
So far, Bucky had only seen the room around him: stone walls, simple furniture, no windows. It could've been anywhere. He'd never heard of a place called Crabb Castle.
The next thing Steve grabbed was a piece of corrugated iron, with a sharp edge that left scrapes on his gloves. He wrenched it aside. There was no one lying under it, either.
It's the best plan he's come up with so far. Tony has probably spotted the place as well and is on his way there, but following his earlier decision, Steve doesn't linger on that thought, not when he's finally found something to be hopeful about.
He managed to get hold of Pepper and tell her, in the most vague words imaginable, that he knew where Tony was, and that the situation would hopefully be solved soon.
With a loud crash, the gates flew open, right off their hinges, as a large ceratopsian dinosaur—male, guessing by the coloring of his crest—barged through. In his wake followed a dozen other, smaller dinosaurs; Steve could spot sharp-clawed dromaeosaurs, ostrich-like ornithomimosaurs, and a dog-sized
He can't find the energy to stand anymore, so he tries to crawl ahead on his hands and knees. It's frustratingly slow, and he's not sure what the point is, anymore.
The way Pepper was speaking about Tony was in line with everything Steve had heard from Tony's other friends, and with Tony's reputation. If it turned out to be the truth, then there was a good chance something bad had happened to him last night after he left the bar, which made it all the more crucial for Steve to try and track him down, and fast.
"Yes, and no. I can't deny that I did see an opportunity, but I never, ever would've followed you to your room if I hadn't wanted to—if I hadn't wanted you," Steve confessed, staring at the tips of his boots. They looked gray in the twilight, and his toes felt numb. "Because I really did. You were flirting with me, and, well, you're just, you're incredibly attractive. As much as I'm Captain America, I'm still human. Sometimes I want things so badly, I can't say no, even if I know I should."
Steve settled down on the rug next to Tony, lying on his side. Tony reached out a hand to caress Steve's face, gently at first. Then, as if changing his mind, he placed it behind Steve's neck, wrapped a leg around Steve's, and pulled him close into a tight, intense embrace. Their mouths met, and their tongues, as did their cocks, trapped enticingly between their bodies, making Steve grind his hips against Tony in search of friction. The warmth that permeated every part of Tony's body merged with that radiating from the hearth, cocooning Steve, almost as if he'd been transformed as well. Steve let his hands roam over Tony's body, down the ridges of his spine, over the solid muscles of his back and buttocks.
Tony, even with his eyes closed, somehow seemed to have guessed what Steve was thinking about. He opened them again to glare at Steve. “Don’t you dare. You’re not tearing off my shirt. I still haven’t forgiven you for the last time you did that.”
His mind skimmed over the hospital details—the oxygen mask on his face, the pulse ox clip on his finger, the catheters stuck here and there—and latched on to the hand next to his. It was touching his just enough that he could feel the warmth of the skin, but it was also more than that. He could feel the concern and sadness of the person that hand belonged to, and even though his eyes were still closed, he knew without a doubt that it was Steve.
Moving even faster than before, Steve rushes to Tony's side, calling out his name again, to no effect.
"Thank you, Captain. I appreciate that," she said, her lips turning into a slight smile. "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
He felt tired all the time, these days, but there were many explanations for that which had nothing to do with the sunstone and his heart. He probably hadn't fully recovered from the blood loss back in the Rainy Basin, not with dehydration and malnutrition piled on top of it. Besides, he wasn't getting very much sleep, when all he had for bedding were a stone floor and a few thin, moth-eaten blankets.
Tony had finally changed out of the coveralls, into casual clothing that fit the surroundings: a dark blue woollen sweater and simple gray pants. He looked good, and more than that, perfectly fine and uninjured. He walked without any trace of a limp or the hunched posture of someone guarding recent chest wounds. Considering what he'd been through three days ago, that was nothing short of miraculous.
If there was anyone who understood that lack of physical strength didn't equal weakness, it would be Tony. After all, even if he was better at hiding it than Steve, Tony had his share of serious health troubles to handle.
They were still several meters away from the windows when she stopped and raised a small gun of a type that Steve didn't recognize. Without a moment's hesitation, she fired at the window in front of them, sending out a slow projectile that in Steve's blurry vision looked like a miniature rocket. It exploded on contact and the window shattered instantly, as if it had been made of glass instead of a supposedly indestructible nanomaterial.
As the ceratopsian came into full view, Steve saw in the pale morning light that there were two men on his back, and he recognized both of them right away. He would've known them anywhere.
"Look, Steve, the thing is, I don't hate you," Tony began. "I've never hated you. After what happened, after Siberia, I tried. I really did. I wanted to hate you, you deserved that, for hiding things from me, but I couldn't. I—"
"Eliana," Sam greeted her—the skybax riders being a small, close-knit community, all of them knew each other by name.
Steve froze, both his hands on the back of the chair now. "Of course. We fought against them many times, back in the day. They're a paramilitary fascist organization who ran all kinds of inhumane experiments," he summarized. Those had been the rare missions where he hadn't felt too guilty about causing lasting damage to his opponents. And if this was going where he thought it was… "Was it them? Were they the ones who took down my team and half the administration of SHIELD?"
Tony shakes his head. "That's because I'm a human, and your most fundamental code includes some bullshit lines telling you that your existence has less value than mine."
A third wave of Northerners had just appeared, more heavily armed than the earlier arrivals, when Pepper's voice cut through the clamor. "Something's happening! Stand away from the gates!"
His hopes go up when he catches sight of a faint trail of smoke not far from where he stands, until he realizes its most likely source. Considering the distance, the chances are very high that it's Tony.
Steve woke up to find himself in a world that was completely different, yet somehow very much the same as what he was used to.
They'd left Jarvis behind to hold the fort at the camp, although they didn't expect any trouble there in the middle of the night. Steve and Natasha were the most skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and their part would be to climb the walls and take down any enemies patrolling the walkways on top. Rhodey, Pepper, and Sam would approach the gates to the tunnel directly and take down the guards there.
Yet again, Steve found himself wondering if they should've waited longer and planned every detail more carefully, so that they'd be prepared for every conceivable contingency. There were so many points where this operation could go wrong.
"Your wish is my command," Ultron declared sardonically, and one of the drones pointed its cannon-like arm towards the open doors of another elevator.
"Captain America." Tony shook his head. His hands came to rest on Steve's waist, his thumbs hooked under Steve's belt. "Out of all the people I thought I could never have."
Down here, on the street levels, hiding from the authorities and with limited resources, there was no chance Tony would be able to afford the procedure to restore a broken node. Dear heavens. Steve had thought he'd had it rough. Compared to this, he'd been lucky.
"Steve!" Natalie yelled, emerging from the alleyway Steve had just exited. "If you'd just stop and listen for a moment! I'm not here to take you to Tony."
Maybe too quickly, because Rhodey didn't seem entirely convinced. "Okay. So, we're still on for Monday?"
"So, has Mr. Stark been, overall, acting different than usual recently, aside from today?" Steve went on with the questions. This was turning out to be a much more useful interview than the one he'd had with Jarvis.
Tony sat back in the armchair, his shoulders hunched, hands clasped together on his lap. "I probably shouldn't have said any of that. Now I've made this weird. Why don't I ever know when to shut up?"
At the front of the group, a shape emerged from the foliage: the head of a monster straight out of a nightmare, or even worse, from some drug-induced hallucination. It was like no lizard Bucky had seen, its snout thicker, with mean-looking ridges above its gleaming eyes, and jaws that opened to reveal rows and rows of huge, sharp teeth.
"None of us came home unchanged, and I doubt there are many who have no regrets," Steve went on. "If that's what we're talking about, I've probably done just as many bad things as you have. But it's not just that, is it?"
Steve felt like he might fall down, himself; after everything, this was almost more than he could take. He didn't know what to feel anymore. Could this really, actually be Tony? He'd thought the other one had been him, until he'd been convinced otherwise, when Tony had—when he'd been standing next to Steve in the bedroom, holding a knife, or pliers, or a hammer, sitting on the mattress, his hand on Steve's thigh, his fingers closing around Steve's throat—his eyes meeting Steve's just as they did now, sad and disappointed.
"That he was," Steve replied. "It was some kind of magic, something he'd come across on the expedition."
JARVIS figures it out the minute Tony gets home. "Welcome back, sir," the AI greets him, and then, "I'm picking up an energy source with a signature resembling that of a CyberLife android."
Of course, Tony squashed those fantasies as soon as he woke up. He as good as said he'd rather face actual torture than accept any further help from Steve.
"Did you just kiss me?" Tony asked, voice raspy, eyes wide, his mouth hanging open after he'd stopped speaking.
Steve takes a moment to process that, then asks, "You said you were dying. If you had focused on repairing him instead of saving yourself, what would've happened to you?"
"No, it wasn't," Pepper confessed. "But he jumped at it when I mentioned it to him, probably because he already suspected Tony might be behind the assassinations. He knows how much you mean to Tony. Having you in a frame that resembles your old self made you the perfect human shield."
Back in the living room—similar to Tony's, with huge windows—Steve couldn't think of anything else that he needed to do. He sat down on one of the couches, feeling blank.
"That never gets old," Happy commented, his face grim. From Steve's point of view, the image was too distorted to make much sense of, but he could tell it showed a human figure and a lot of blood.
The stupidest thing was, Tony thought, as he took a swig of the bottle—rum, wouldn't have been his first choice if he'd actually been looking, but eh—he still couldn't bring himself to hate Steve. Even if the torch he'd been carrying for Steve should've been extinguished and more than that, hacked into tiny pieces in Siberia, Tony had gathered up those pieces and carried them back home with him. Maybe pouring alcohol over them wasn't the best idea. It was flammable, after all.
"Never mind that," Pepper said. She looked very pale, but her expression was more thoughtful than shocked. "The most important thing is, he survived back then. He might also have survived this. You said you saw no trace of him today?"
Bruce frowned at him for a beat, but then his eyebrows shot up and he shook his head. “Oh, no, no, you didn’t, Steve. You didn’t do that. I stopped you,” he said, an oddly apologetic look on his face. “I made the decision to have you sedated. You never got past second base.”
Now that Steve had started, he might as well keep going. "It's about us because we're teammates, and I'd like for us to be friends."
"The ones you're sure you can trust," Peggy said. "If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know. Unofficially."
Perhaps it was inevitable that any culture, no matter how peaceful and accepting, had its untouchable tenets. Be that as it may, Steve thought it sad that they would give Tony the cold shoulder just because his nature as an explorer had drawn him to the caves under the island—especially since the technology he'd discovered had been so beneficial. It had given him the means overcome his weak heart and to build a suit of armor that now enabled him to help everyone on the island as the mysterious Iron Man. Somewhat duplicitously, no one ever turned away the armored figure, even though it was visibly similar to the forbidden technology. Then again, most people thought it was a robot, not a metal-plated man who put his life at risk every time he chose to wear that suit.
He settled into as comfortable a position as he could find, his head tucked into the nook of Tony's shoulder, the blanket-hooded top of his head just beneath the rim of Tony's helmet.
"Uh uh. As it happens, Maya Hansen and Aldrich Killian already came up with the perfect nanotech vector to do just that," Tony said.
It occurred to him that he hadn't considered all the angles when he'd sat down at a table. The waiter, a middle-aged Italian man who might well have been Lorenzo himself, dropped the menu in front of him and glared at him like he was something the cat dragged in.
Steve didn't see any reason not to explain the whole situation to her. "I don't know if he told you, but there was another fire last night, and Tony was caught in it. Which made me wonder if there might be a connection between the two."
His one last hope was that once he told his captors the strutter was finished, they'd take him outside for a test drive, and he could improvise his escape. He had rigged some of the technology in the Vault to explode with enough force to bring down half the room, which he could set on a timer. That should provide a fine distraction. He just wasn't sure how fast his sunstone would regain enough of a charge to power the escape vehicle. It could easily turn into a worst case scenario that would have him trapped in the midst of his enemies, caught with his pants down, or rather, his shirt off, the secret he'd been so careful to protect revealed to them all.
He started fucking Tony slowly with his fingers, going on until Tony let out a whine that didn't sound entirely happy.
Steve clasped Tony's hand between both of his. "It definitely does. There's just a few things that need to be sorted out first, like the fact that I'm a fugitive and not supposed to be here at all." He hated to bring any of that up right now, but since they seemed to be taking the first, tentative steps towards a future together, it couldn't really be avoided.
As prepared as he was ever going to be, and still convinced that he was working against the clock, Steve started his search for information by walking into the first bar he came across. It looked suitably seedy, the screens in the partly broken windows running adverts for drinks and drugs, the banners on top naming the place "Joe's."
For a moment, Steve's mind struggled to sort out conflicting reactions. It was Tony's voice, and that meant pain, but the face looked wistful, not cruel, and the white hair and the aged features were not from his nightmarish memories.
As Rhodey had said, it didn't take too long until they landed, and as far as Steve could tell, it wasn't a platform but solid ground, the low light around them glistening on the ever-present layer of water. They drove on the tarmac for a brief distance, into a small garage with a few other cars in it.
"Well, I can tell you that the team she was working with was odd," Pepper said. "It was her and another academic, a Dr. Killian, and a whole lot of assistants who resembled common thugs more than university researchers."
"You do the digging, and I'll tell you how to get more out of your own tech than you could ever imagine," Tony promises.
The locked door was sturdy, but not quite sturdy enough to keep out an agitated super-soldier. Steve barged through into the room, looking around frantically. It wasn't difficult to spot Tony: he was lying down on a couch in one corner. Even before Steve got to him, he could see Tony's eyes were open and roving and his cheeks flushed. Definitely alive. He wasn't too late, thankfully. Something was clearly wrong, though.
Steve had to admit he'd thought that, too. With the very fancy house, it seemed like the obvious conclusion that the man opening the door would be an employee. "Sorry, I didn't mean to presume," Steve said, and held out his hand. "Pleased to meet you, Mr…"
Iron Man's reply was enough to confirm he meant everything Steve was hoping for: he slid one hand along Steve's shoulder to cup his face in a gesture that was suggestive and affectionate at the same time. Steve turned his head and kissed Iron Man's bare palm; Iron Man let out a sigh that Steve could hear even through his helmet.
"A pity. They should've gone all the way. Wouldn't be that expensive to install some synthetic glands." Tony gripped Steve's cock more firmly and gave the head a lick. It felt less intense than what he'd have expected.
Tony turned towards Steve again, and shifted a little closer so he could place a hand on Steve's shoulder. "I know all of this is a lot to take in, and I'm sorry. I know I must seem like a stranger to you now, but I'm still me. If you want to talk, I'll be there for you. If there's anything you need, just ask."
Steve had a dozen reasons to say no. Following Tony to his room, when he had no idea Steve was Captain America and investigating this case with Tony as the prime suspect, was awfully duplicitous. Unethical and reprehensible. Besides, Tony might be dangerous. Steve suspected he had caused three, or possibly four, fires within the past week, and was responsible for at least one death, and who knew how many burn injuries.
The thought of Steve watching him sleep definitely doesn't make Tony any less annoyed. He hates the idea that he's been so vulnerable, entirely at the mercy of the person he'd least like to face in the entire world—and it's all the worse because not too long ago, he would've been ecstatic for Steve to be looking after him like this.
Hammer grimaced. "Ah, yes, of course. That's part of the reason why we're here, anyway. I'm very, very sorry about that, and I want to make it up to you." He motioned them deeper into the building.
"He said to expect a call from you, but I'll need to be sure you really are the right person. Where did you first meet him?" Jarvis asked.
"It's just that even if all goes well, and I manage to convince myself I'm not an immediate risk to everyone around me," Tony began again, looking up at Steve. "I'm trying to picture what my future might look like, a year from now, or five years, and I have no idea. I think about going back to my old life, pretending none of this happened, and that doesn't feel right. I'll always be carrying this fire inside me now, no matter what, and that changes things. It's almost like I don't know who I am. The war already left me feeling different, but this—I think of that man who poses on the covers of Marvels, and that's not me, not anymore."
