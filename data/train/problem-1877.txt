Slowly, a warm smile returned to John’s lips, and he slid his hand across the table to grasp Sherlock’s. Sherlock jumped a bit at his touch, but quickly adjusted and smiled in return.
He knew that his break overlapped with John's a bit, so when it rolled around, Sherlock stood on the steps in order to see over the crowd. He spotted John by the roundabout with several of his year six friends.
“Sherlock, I hope you know what you’re doing. I don’t want to see you get blown up or anything like that.”
Okay, this is one that will definitely continue for at least one more day. Because we've gotta see Sherlock trying to take notes for John, right? (What a doof.)
The dark look that Wendy shot at her twin was so brief that John almost thought he’d imagined it. Then she turned to him. Without looking away from him, she asked, “And who’s this, then?”
John rolled his eyes, but smiled. "Seriously, Sherlock, we’ve already got one detention," he protested weakly.
"Now, follow my lead. Put your right foot back as my left comes forward. Then step back to the other corner of the box with your left foot and bring them together. All in the count of three. Ready?"
“That interview was from a few days ago; since then, the man responsible for her death, thirty-year-old Matthew Hughes-” a mugshot of a rather rugged-looking man appeared in the corner of the screen briefly “-has been taken into custody, and will be put on trial for murder in the first degree. Meanwhile, a public memorial service to celebrate the life of Laura and to honour her memory will be held in Watford this weekend for her friends and colleagues to attend and pay respects to the family suffering this tragic loss. More information about the service and this case can be found on our website. In other news, construction on Farringdon Street to potentially cause significant traffic delays this week after-”
Letting out a slow sigh, John shrugged his own blanket off of his shoulders and was about to hop down off of the edge when Sherlock came to stand before him, situating himself between John’s knees. The blond looked up to find the detective looking at him intently.
Sherlock offers a sad smile. “I can sympathise with her. You’re the only doctor I trust.” The words come easily. Sherlock’s too tired to worry about the sentiment that oozes from them.
“Drunkenly snogging the sexiest man I’ve ever laid eyes on after only knowing him for about twenty minutes in a broom closet,” John amended, laughing again.
It was John who began laughing first; it started as a shake of his shoulders accompanied by a breathy chuckle, but it soon devolved into a high-pitched, adrenaline-fueled giggle. It wasn’t long before Sherlock’s deep, baritone joined in, his laugh watery with the alcohol and endorphins flooding his system.
“Jesus.” John scrubbed a hand over his face. “So, potential potent DXM-cocaine mix. Whatever it was, it was a shock to your system. You don’t remember most of last night, you wound up in my flat, you’ve no idea how the crash is going to be with this -- And you think I’m going to just let you leave and go home where I can’t watch over you?”
Third and final order of business: The past few weeks have been hectic because of work and back-to-university nonsense. Bear with me while I attempt to get myself on some sort of schedule again. Thank you all for your patience with me and my inconsistent updates. I appreciate you more than you know.
What he thought was a very nice flat on the outside turned out to be a rather run-down, shabby place on the inside. The carpet was thin, the rooms were cold, the lighting consisted of bare, exposed bulbs, and while he was sure some of the shoddy decor could be blamed on Sherlock, John couldn’t see this place looking terribly nice in any scenario without some significant renovations. Aside from the decor, Sherlock clearly hadn’t been a martyr blowing a mildly-untidy room out of proportion; the place was a disaster. Clothes littered the floor, newspapers and books took up nearly every surface in the room, and dirty mugs with dried-up tea bags still in them took up what little space was left. Another overflowing ashtray sat on a small table by the window, and underneath the windowsill, on a small floor stand, was a violin. John raised his eyebrows at the sight, because the instrument looked well cared-for; the strings were in-tact, the instrument was polished, with a light dusting of rosin powder on the strings, the wood beneath, and the widest part of the fingerboard to indicate recent use. He didn’t have to try very hard to imagine Sherlock wielding such a delicate instrument; the man likely took to music with the same nearly-frightening precision with which he approached a crime scene. John wondered what haunting melodies nimble fingers had manipulated out of the fine instrument, and decided he’d ask Sherlock about the hobby when next they spoke.
, it was down to the wire – the car would arrive at the mouth of the gap between the two warehouses they stood between in a matter of
going by the state of her knees.” He fell silent after that, letting the implications sink in, and he quirked a small grin before turning around and moving inside, leaving Sally, Anderson, and John standing in shocked silence.
out, Dr. Watson.” John opened his mouth to protest, but Greg held up a hand to stop him. “Hey, I’m not judging or complaining. Far be it from me to complain about
“Well I’m glad you find me agreeable. That bodes well,” he said with a soft chuckle, and when Sherlock looked back up at him with a faint smile of his own, John continued speaking. “So… Maybe we should start with a log. I’m not going to ask you to quit cold turkey, because that’s exceedingly difficult; especially when you’re going about quitting on your own. Not to mention it can be dangerous. If you’re not going to go into rehab, then we’ll need to take this one step at a time. Over the next week, or until I see you again, of course if you feel like you can start to wean yourself off, then do so. But if not, a detailed log of what you take and when you take it could be useful in putting your habits into perspective. Sometimes a physical representation of our indulgences helps give us a reality check. Do you think that’s something we could start with?”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked up to look at him through dark lashes as he sipped his coffee, before shifting to look to his left towards the other side of the room. John’s gaze followed, and his lips parted in a little smile when he espied on the sofa a folded set of clothes. They were his from the night before.
“Such a small amount of time together,” the man said, nearly tutting as he did so, “and since then you’ve made an impact strong enough to at least get him to attempt getting clean. You’ve
“Show me.” The taller man sauntered closer, hanging his umbrella over his arm in a practised motion as he reached out, and John, stifling a groan and resorting to just rolling his eyes, held out his left hand. The fingers that gently roamed over his skin, just barely touching him, were icy cold. “Remarkable,” the man said after a moment, sounding truly astounded.
They burst through into the cool night air, and John chuckled breathily as he had to almost jog to keep up with Sherlock’s long strides. “Eager, are we?” he asked teasingly, and Sherlock grinned.
“Ah, ah, ah,” she said in a rushed, chastising voice, and as she came closer John recognised her from the same interview he’d seen Lestrade in on the telly. “What do you think you’re doing?” she asked in a way that led John to believe she and the tall man who was about to duck under the crime scene tape were well-acquainted, and not in a friendly way.
Frowning, John scrolled to the top of the page once more to scan through the article again, searching for any offhand mention of a private detective, anything he might have missed, and his search paid off when he happened upon a reference that seemed rather vague and peculiar.
Sherlock stewed where he sat and remained silent, slim arms crossing over his chest as his eyes attempted to burn a hole through the door.
the desk. Poking around the ash tray with a gloved finger and a small magnifying glass. Fiddling with the locks on all three of the windows. When the man did a double-take to look back at something on the floor in front of the first window, John followed his eyes, and then frowned, looking back at Sherlock, because there was nothing there-- wait.
At that, Sherlock looked up, cautious surprise written in his features, but the small, disarming smile that met his eyes melted his insecurities. “In what way?” he asked.
John hummed a laugh and shook his head as he pushed away from the wall and made his way back over to the sink, turning the tap on and rolling up his sleeves to resume the washing of the dishes. “I’d say my door’s always open, but I’ve taken the liberty of removing the spare from under the mat permanently,” he said, and Sherlock’s smile grew.
John cleared his throat loudly and schooled his expression as they approached the group of men and women, some donning blue suits, some talking, some taking or reading notes in notepads. One man in particular looked up as they approached, and John recognised his face before he recognised his voice.
John tilted his head slightly, inquisitive and curious expression overtaking his face. “What changed?”
“In his mind, certainly.” The man took an audible breath. “In fact, if you were to ask him, he’d likely call me his
Sherlock seemed to come to the same conclusion, as he suddenly tilted his head and said in a voice that was disturbingly casual; “you didn’t make it home last night.”
At the same time, the boot of the trunk popped open, the little light on the interior of the space lighting up the area to reveal a duffle bag, and Sherlock approached it to unzip it. The rest of them - John, Greg, and the extra police officer - all gathered around to watch as Sherlock pulled out wadded up clothes, a fair amount of cash, a small cooler unit with insulin and syringes, a mobile phone, and, at the bottom of the suitcase, a gun, which he took out carefully and checked the safety on, before handing it over to the police officer. “He was leaving, Greg,” he said, staring Lestrade down. “On the run. He was leaving for his own protection against the very people who killed him.”
“Got one all loaded up for you, love,” he said, and held out a hand for Sherlock’s arm, which the other man gave up with no hesitation. The detective had shed his coat and rolled up both of his sleeves when he’d first entered the run-down house in his eagerness, and it had paid off, because within seconds, Victor was fastening a tourniquet around Sherlock’s bicep (wholly unnecessary, Sherlock thought with an eye-roll), gliding a cold needle across his skin in the dim light before finding a vein, and expertly puncturing his flesh. Sherlock watched as a drop of red mixed in artfully with the clear liquid in the syringe, and took a slow breath as he watched Victor push down the plunger.
“I see no reason to believe that the two must be mutually exclusive,” Sherlock rejoined, his grin audible in his voice.
“What time is it?” She asked, and John looked at her reflection in the mirror as she put down the iron and grabbed a tube whose colour matched the ruby red of her fingernails. The cap came off and the chiseled tip of the lipstick was pressed to her pouted lips.
“A tenner. Have you got one?” They rounded a corner and headed in the direction of the walkway running along the Thames, as John huffed indignantly and fisted his pocket.
Come along, John,” he called over his shoulder, and the doctor scampered to catch up with him as they made their way away from the pagoda and onto the pavement that ran alongside the river. It was there that Sherlock extracted the small note from his pocket and looked over its contents written in the hasty, uncoordinated scrawl of a child, smiling both out of fondness and satisfaction.
“If it weren’t for your work,” John began after he felt the silence had stretched on long enough, “would you have a reason to get clean?”
Thankfully, it seemed that any and all thoughts of future romantic entanglements were destined to be put on the metaphorical back-burner, because as John jogged to catch up with Sherlock’s long strides and caught a glimpse of the side of the man’s face, he found the smile he’d been wearing replaced by a look of set determination. John had a harder time quelling his own smile, but he knew that the tampering down of their emotions was necessary; they were heading into a potentially dangerous situation, and couldn’t afford to be distracted by whatever was growing between them. Their relationship could wait.
“I will.” The statement was punctuated by a yawn, and John’s chest expanded at the sight of the skin at the bridge of Sherlock’s nose crinkling adorably as a hand came up to self-consciously cover his agape mouth. “Mm,” the man hummed when he’d finished yawning, eyes closing as his head nuzzled into the pillow.
Anyway, thanks for reading, and I'll see all of your shining, beautiful faces back here next Saturday!
“I love you more,” John murmured, stepping closer to stand toe to toe with the other, eyes trailing from Sherlock’s eyes down to his dark red lips, which turned up in a smirk.
He’d successfully ignored John for the most part, aside from the occasional reminder when he checked his mobile to see missed texts, and had managed to gather a few pieces of evidence that he deemed crucial:
“Traichan Holmes. He was known to torture people beyond repair.” The level of disgust in Sherlock’s voice was something John had never heard before. “Countless people. He didn’t even torture them for information. He was the worst kind of Death Eater, one that tortured for fun.”
At the sound of John in the doorway, Sherlock jumped and threw his arms over the parchment in front of him.
The door hadn’t even clicked shut before John attacked him, biting at his lips and muttering between nips, “You…complete…arse….Do you know...how frustrating it is…for your boyfriend…to flaunt himself…in front of his whole bloody family?”
“It’s just, I didn’t ever think Sherlock would ever find a good close friend, let alone….Well, I’ve known Sherlock Holmes for two years. He always comes to me when he needs some sort of authority figure, although his brother
John approached him on the front steps of the school at three o’clock. “Ready to tackle some Oscar Wilde?”
"Er, Angelo." Mr. Holmes covertly pulled the owner aside when they arrived. "Would it be possible to set up the boys a little table of their own? Just for two. Sherlock's decided he has to take John on a date before he can marry him," he said with a wink.
Harry seemed disappointed, but there wasn’t much she could do if her brother wasn’t bosom friends with her girlfriend’s, a fact that John was extremely grateful for. They were friendly enough. Mike Stamford was a nice guy and a pretty incredible Beater, but beyond their age and the position they played for their House Quidditch teams, the two boys had very little in common.
“No you won’t!” Moriarty sang before John heard the sound of a door closing echo off the surface of the water.
“Sleeping,” John answered simply. He wasn’t really in the mood to deal with Stamford’s enthusiasm; he already had enough of his own in returning to school.
“Sherlock?” When he reached the landing, Sherlock’s bedroom door was open wide, and Sherlock himself was sitting at his desk, quill in hand and scratching away at a piece of parchment. “Sherlock—”
He laid Sherlock gingerly on the grass, and once it was clear that he was still breathing, turned to see everyone joining him in landing. A few yards away, he saw Greg shouting at Moran. “What were you thinking? You could’ve killed someone!”
And here we start with the holidays. When I say to be prepared for December, heed my warning. I wrote way too much Christmas with the Holmeses, if that's possible.
But here was the most beautiful person Sherlock had ever seen, sitting on the floor with him outside his dormitory while his roommate fucked some guy in the middle of the day, just to keep him company, and the situation was so bizarre he almost laughed, but instead he surprised even himself by asking, "Are you doing anything Friday night?"
In retrospect, it might have been Sherlock's fault. It had been quite a while since he'd gone to the barber's, so that he had to pull his hair back in the lab, and he hardly ever spoke in class.
stumbly, giggly tango later, the music slowed and John slumped against Sherlock, catching his breath from their previous fit of laughter.
"Well, I was worried!" He rounded on Fitzgerald. "You can't just start a conversation with 'you're listed as your boyfriend's emergency contact' and expect me to be calm."
As John pulled on a pair of Sherlock’s pyjamas—a little tight, but worth it for the idea alone—he remarked, “Is this just a way to get me into your clothes?”
John took the knife and directed him to the pot, where the pasta bubbled away inside. "Stir that a moment, would you?"
She continued with the rest of the story, how Sherlock had tried to put out a salamander’s fire with just one small bucket of water, but John had to admit that he was losing interest. It probably had something to do with Sherlock invading his space, pressing his thigh against John’s. By the time the story of the picnic salamanders had ended and the page was turned, Sherlock’s chin rested casually on John’s shoulder, and his arms had looped themselves around John’s waist discreetly.
. We're both students. You can be a detective in a few years, and I'll help you all you like. But I've got class this afternoon."
John was taken aback, partly because of Sherlock’s compliance and partly by his self-invitation. “Well, I don’t—I don’t know, I—”
"Only that you've got a biology exam you're worried about, your trip home last weekend was particularly stressful, and you've recently been considering going into the army."
Still, he would pull off posh-but-scuffed shoes and draw the sheets over the limp form of his flatmate, his dead weight on top of all the covers sometimes making the latter quite difficult, in which case John would bitterly hope to roll Sherlock off the bed completely as he tugged the sheets free.
Outside his room, Sherlock had to drop John’s hand to pick the lock. Once inside, however, he didn’t hesitate to push John up against the closed door and kiss him. He kissed him as though he was making up for the lost day, begging for forgiveness for abandoning him, and John tried as best he could to convey his own irritation at the circumstances in return.
Sherlock, however, was already typing with his free hand. He slid his phone back into his pocket. “Just sent him a text.”
“John, there’s something I have to tell you. I’ve been working on a…case…for Mycroft.” He paused. “There’s something going on at Hogwarts, something not so good.”
“He’s wearing women’s underwear,” Sherlock whispered back, completely deadpan, and John almost stopped in the middle of the doorway.
Merry Christmas Eve, darlings! Hope Santa brings you something you'll enjoy. (I also hope Santa leaves me lots of comments under this here fic-mas tree...)
Sherlock started to protest, but instead sighed and pressed a chaste kiss to John’s temple. "Good night, John."
“How nice.” She said it as though she did not think it nice at all that Sherlock was a genius, before turning to Mycroft and acting as though the exchange hadn’t occurred.
"See you, Victor." John looked over at Sherlock as they set off in the direction of the lift. "Your costume really is great, you know."
“It was an experiment! Anyway, I was thinking of the look on his face when he saw Gingerwald being dragged along behind through the window. I hadn’t meant for the cat to get hurt, but…”
Sherlock tilted his head and pressed his nose to John’s neck. John felt Sherlock’s chest expand against him as he breathed deeply, then felt the cool breath at his pulse point as he exhaled.
"They've just finished dinner," Greg said. "Should pass out in a few hours. If they get thirsty, only water this late. Oh, and Lucy has to have her blue cup."
John could tell Wilkes had put Sherlock into a bit of a foul mood. "Just sit as far away as you can or he'll toss you out on the pavement himself," he warned.
"She taught us the simple box step, and then the more complicated turns, and with each one, after we mastered it, she would--oh." Something had clearly just occurred to him that hadn't before. John stared at him suspiciously. "Yes!" Before John knew what was happening, there was a large hand on either side of his head, pulling it forward so that Sherlock could kiss his forehead firmly. "You are amazing, my conductor of light!"
Both doctor and patient fell and remained silent for almost a full minute, Sherlock looking as though he were deep in thought, and John just silently observing and giving Sherlock as much time as he needed to think.
“It’s fascinating,” the younger man said on a careful whisper, a curious hand rising between them to let gentle fingers brush across the prominent webbing on the outskirts of the starburst marring John’s skin. “Beautiful,” he continued, and something in John’s chest shattered.
First order of business: The excerpts from the book John is reading are from The Face of a Stranger by Anne Perry.
“Please, Ms. Winstead, call me John.” A warm, kind smile made its way onto John’s face as he extended his right hand to gently grasp that of the young woman before him. “And of course, it was a pleasure seeing you, as always,” he added, his smile holding an easy, practised charm that, without fail, made his patient’s cheeks flush the lightest shade of pink.
“Yeah,” Greg confirmed, “we’ve got people looking through everything going into and coming out of Heathrow from around the time of the sighting up to now.”
to do. It wasn’t staunching blood-flow from a shrapnel wound on a sandy battlefield, but it was something to keep him busy and potentially do some good in the process.
Hope you enjoyed, thanks again for clicking your way here, have a LOVELY day, and I'll see you all back here soon!
He knows he should stay to be sure Rosie stays asleep, but there aren’t any chairs. The bed is the only option. He forces himself to think that John won’t mind as he meanders over to sit delicately on the bed. The mattress springs creak quietly under his weight. John shouldn’t have to sleep on something with such little support, he thinks to himself as he smoothes one hand over the low thread-count duvet. He sighs softly as he fishes his mobile out of his pocket, unlocking it and scrolling through the thirty-six messages he’s sent John over the course of the last two hours; the doctor was supposed to be home by nine-thirty. Groaning quietly, Sherlock puts the phone on the nightstand and hangs his head, rubs his hands over his face, wipes at his tired eyes. Rosie stirs in her cot, and Sherlock’s heart sinks, fearing the worst; but when he looks up, he realises she’s merely shifted, her little hands now clutching the bumblebee plush he’d bought for her shortly after she was born. A weary, fond smile crosses his face. He sighs softly;
One more gunshot rang out, startling John (though it missed him horribly), and he turned to find Kent a few paces closer, finger already depressing the trigger - but the gun clicked instead of firing a bullet, and for a brief moment where silence stretched between them, between Kent and himself, John didn’t know who was more surprised. But a split second later, Kent’s boot-laden foot lashed out and kicked roughly, hitting John square in the chest, sending the doctor sprawling onto his back with a loud
He huffed, and looked down, if only to distract himself from Sherlock’s eyes on him. Coming face-to-swollen-face with a cold, lifeless corpse was sobering enough.
In addition to the slit throat, Mary had adorned John’s face with a couple faux bruises (she’d even managed to make the flesh beneath his eye look realistically swollen, to John’s amazement), a split lip, and a mild gash along one cheek which mercifully took far less time than the wound across his throat. Dark circles beneath each eye and a little makeup in the hollows of his cheeks made him look like death -- which, he supposed, was rather the point.
“I need a wash,” the doctor announced with a sigh, “and you need a shower; I’m not letting you fall asleep with blood in your hair.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows a fraction. “Academic and sports scholarship?” he asked, already knowing the answer.
“I have a particular… talent,” Sherlock weighed his words carefully, “that most people find… invasive.”
“Rash on his upper arms,” Sherlock said, pointing back to the body, and John did him a favour of lifting up the arm of the tee shirt to expose an angry red rash going up to the man’s shoulders. “Exertion-induced asthma, not to mention the inhaler in his desk drawer.” He strode over to dig in the rubbish bin by the desk, and he pulled out a syringe. “Diabetic; disposable syringes that he snaps the needles off of - a drug-addict using
He’d made it a point to be involved in as little as possible when it came to extra-curricular activities, and he’d succeeded his first and second years at uni. Now, in his third year, apparently Irene had grown tired of not being able to boss Sherlock around at all hours of the day, and had thus decided that he was going to be her “date” to a Halloween party.
The detective tipped his head to the side, his grin still in place. "I helped him put up some shelves."
He stood under a flickering streetlight just outside the shabby building and pulled out his notepad, flipping through the pages with trembling fingers, but he didn’t get to the list of names before he noticed that the writing on the page he was on was bleeding together. The black and blue ink was dripping down the page, inky spirals that looped around and into each other and spilled off the page, painting the ground, painting
“Aren’t you going to put one on?” John punctuated the inquiry with the sharp zip of the front of his full-body suit.
- he glanced at the man who had since dropped his arm, and grinned. “C’m’ere,” he beckoned, halting when they got past the initial swarm of police cruisers, partway to the ambulance. Sherlock stopped obediently and faced him, brows quirked in entreaty. Smiling, John reached up to grab the dark blue scarf wrapped around Sherlock’s neck and pulled it away, noticing Sherlock shiver as the long column of his neck was exposed to the night air. “You’re covered in my blood,” John murmured bemusedly, bringing the soft fabric up to swipe gently at a spot of red on Sherlock’s cheek.
The only reason John dared to even breathe was that the laughter flowing from the men who tumbled into the warehouse was so boisterous that he was sure they wouldn’t notice. Without warning, the place was filled with harsh, fluorescent lights that flickered as they struggled to life, and by that light, John was able to make out that he’d been pulled behind what appeared to be a large stack of wooden pallets – some that might be used to carry large quantities of heavy items by forklift. He looked to his side to see Sherlock, with his legs stuck out in front of him, chest heaving and mouth agape with silent, deep breaths, head tipped back against the wooden pallets at their backs. As they both caught their breath and regained their bearings, John took a moment to listen as he began to catch words coming through the riotous laughter.
The silence, heavy with questions, seemed to hang in the air for an eternity before the young receptionist spoke, her voice quiet. “Well, ten minutes until closing.” She looked to John with a faint sigh and a tired smirk. “Rather exciting end to the day. What happened? Why’d he storm out like that?” she asked curiously.
His voice cut off into a surprised sound when a pair of tanned hands grasped the lapels of his wool coat and tugged, causing Sherlock to stumble forward, his hands colliding with John’s chest in a futile attempt to stabilise himself, and he hadn’t even a moment to process exactly what was happening before his mouth was covered by John’s.
“Rosie.” The name leaves his mouth in a heavy sigh. “I understand that you are upset. Trust me when I say that I, too, am unhappy with your father for staying out so late. What do you suppose he’s doing?” he asks pleasantly, well aware (and thankful) that the girl, less than two years of age, cannot yet understand the concept of sarcasm. “Hm?” he continues, but to no avail; Rosie simply screams louder. He hadn’t imagined that to be possible. Just like her father, Rosie continues to amaze him; though, typically, John’s surprises are much more… bearable. And not so piercing.
“Six minutes?” Sherlock approximated, and put his phone back in his pocket. He was about to tell John that he didn’t
It was at that moment that Lestrade, with his infuriatingly impeccable timing, chose to round the corner in a flurry, his chocolate eyes bordering on frantic as he clutched a police radio in his hand close to his face. A series of numbers crackled through the small device in muffled tones. “Copy, on our way,” the DI said, before looking between the two men. “There’s been another robbery. I have to go; Sherlock? Are you well enough to come with?"
for your average everyday chemical experimentation. An overly-full ashtray sat in the middle of the table, with an opened and partial pack of Lambert and Butler cigarettes sitting primly on its end next to it, along with a lighter.
Rosie takes a brief moment from her guttural wailing to gulp for air, gasping as her tear-filled eyes look at the door to the flat longingly. “Daddyyyy,” she moans miserably, voice catching on a pathetic sob.
John, for one, was nearly oblivious, having grown quite accustomed to the sounds of the city; including police, ambulance, and firetruck sirens. It was normal.
“You and Irene. You’re both vampires. Any story behind it? Did one of you turn the other?” he asked, his smile growing, and Sherlock pondered.
Tomorrow, he thought, as he closed his eyes and willed himself to get at least a few hours of decent sleep. He’d text Sherlock tomorrow.
The sound of a gunshot filled the silence. There was a small burst of red, a flurry of motion, and the sound of a body crumpling to the ground before a single cry of pure agony rang with the gunshot in John's ears.
I won't delay you any longer. Go and read and be merry, thank you as always for clicking your way here, and I hope you enjoy.
All he knows is that he is roused from his slumber by the feeling of the mattress dipping beside him.
“Who the hell are you?” John asked, and his voice sounded small even to his own ears. “And how the hell do you know that?”
“You’re not wrong.” Sherlock’s smile faded as a mild grimace contorted his features and a soft groan left his lips; he hadn’t anticipated the extent to which the full-bodied aches would plague and inhibit him as they did now. Headaches, he could deal with; but the sudden stiffness in his joints and muscles made him want to crawl into a comfortable bed under soft sheets and wait for the pain to pass. Maybe, he pondered idly, thoughts meandering back in time to how he’d spent the night and how he’d woken up, the presence of a strong, warm, sturdy body next to his own in the bed would be welcome; even ideal.
He was sitting down on the sofa wrestling his foot into one sock when Sherlock emerged in his blue dressing gown, hair sticking up every which way, still damp, a healthy flush still present in his cheeks. They exchanged a smile before John returned his attention to his socks.
The wink he gave John following his advice was unexpected, but impossibly charming to the point where John’s cheeks tinged pink. “Oh. Okay,” he said dumbly, and then, a touch awkwardly, climbed into the back of the cab. The door remained open, and John ignored the annoyed huff of the cab driver in favour of looking up at where Sherlock stood on the pavement, one gloved hand on the top of the door. “I’ll meet you back here tonight, then?” he asked, breaking the silence after a moment.
think about it. Sherlock was a bit of an unconventional sort of attractive, in John’s mind; tall and lithe, if a bit too thin for John’s comfort, though he was only concerned for the man’s health. His skin was flawless and stunningly pale to the point where John almost suspected a potential vitamin deficiency. His striking features looked downright lethal in their sharpness, with high, prominent cheekbones and captivating, sharp, verdigris eyes resting above them. His features were framed perfectly by messy, raven locks that John had previously, secretly,
At the sound of the front door opening and closing, signifying his secretary's departure, John set to work wrapping up what little paperwork he had left for the day. It would have taken him less than ten minutes, but he managed to stretch it out to nearly half an hour - and maybe part of him was hopeful that if he stayed around the office a while longer, maybe someone would show up. Maybe a very specific someone, at that.
“Of course,” John said, not bothering to hide the fondness in his voice, and he reached out once more to gently push his fingers through the young detective’s curls before stepping away.
The office, albeit small, was homey - a deep, black cherry stained oak desk stood along one wall, upon which sat his closed laptop, a notebook and pen, and a small picture frame displaying a photo of himself along with some of his best mates from the army, decked out in their fatigues, arms thrown around each other’s shoulders as they smiled beamingly at the camera. The blinding sand of the afghan desert where his platoon had been stationed served as the backdrop for the impromptu photo shoot, and while images of the bone-dry hell that served as his home for three years brought back plenty of unpleasant memories, he couldn’t help but smile back at the men in the picture, including the younger, stronger, happier version of himself.
The comment was followed by movement; a nestling down further into their shared embrace and the tightening of an arm around Sherlock’s waist both served to punctuate the statement. Positively charmed, Sherlock smiled against John’s sternum, and he could hear his smile in his own words when he spoke: “I don’t think that’d be very good for business,” he quipped with a gravelly chuckle. He took in a breath - one last inhale of John’s essence - before pushing himself away from the doctor.
John and Greg stood by the door, Greg seeming to resignedly accept the fact that Sherlock was poking about the room wearing his street clothes and a pair of gloves, while John watched Sherlock with rapt attention and fascination as he fluttered about the room:
“Pleasure to meet you both,” the blonde girl - Mary - said, tilting her head in a polite manner that made Sherlock’s skin crawl. John, however, beamed at them both, and Sherlock’s prickly defenses quickly crumbled.
“And don’t say you’ve lost the ability to fight, because you shot three men this evening and fought hand-to-hand with another man twice your size and you prevailed.” His eyebrows rose, daring John to counter him.
“Don’t worry, mate,” he said, “Mycroft will settle it all. Hell, you’ll probably have it back by tomorrow,” he muttered, though his words lacked heat; they were simply filled with the exhaustion that apparently came with dealing with the Holmes brothers and their antics. As suddenly prostrate as John felt, he was inclined to agree with the weariness in Greg’s voice.
“Interested in Sherlock. What, are you a jealous ex-boyfriend?” John jabbed, though he felt it rather revealed a bit more than he’d intended for it to.
The remote control sat temptingly on the bedside table, and John pursed his lips as he deliberated. Coming to the conclusion that a bit of telly before bed wouldn’t hurt, he took the remote in his hand, aimed it at the small television that sat a short distance away across the room, and pushed the power button.
Relative silence settled upon them, until an unexpected voice broke it. “You really think they’re smart enough to pull a stunt like that?”
John had to laugh at the absurdity of the letter, written in an elegant hand. “Christ’s sake,” he murmured as he set the letter back down. He’d worry about unpacking later.
he asked, looking back to Sherlock. “That’s… Unnecessarily cryptic,” he decided with a frown, glancing back to Sherlock, clearly expecting an explanation.
Another set of stairs proved to be a challenge, though he was appeased when the door he’d come through closed behind him and blocked out most of the noise of the rain. Now his breathing, his heart, and his footfalls were the only things deafening him as he made his way up the stairs, the cold metal of the banister held firm in one white-knuckled grip.
“I’m beginning to suspect that this has less to do with assuaging your doubts, and more to do with stroking your ego.”
“Ah, so this is a matter of some sort of… substance usage,” John surmised, strategically avoiding the term ‘abuse’.
can be caused by more than mere embarrassment or discomfort,” he began. “You know this. Essentially part of the fight-or-flight response; when adrenaline is involved. I can determine from a brief self-analysis that my pulse has accelerated, my skin is warm to the touch, and I’d be willing to bet that an examination of my pupils under less harsh light would find them dilated. What conclusions can we draw from this?”
Hey everyone! Just a heads-up regarding my update schedule; I am moving to one update per week, which will happen on Saturdays. Thanks for reading, and I hope to see you all back here next week.
One look up at Sherlock, however, had hope springing anew in his chest, as the look on Sherlock’s face wasn’t one of resignation, but of curious confusion.
The trip out of the flat was as uneventful as the trip into it had been, for which John was thankful yet again. And thanks to his proximity to the British Museum, there was an abundance of cabs to be caught, even in the rain. A ride to the nearest Tesco cost only four minutes and a couple quid, and once inside, John grabbed a basket and made a beeline for the biscuits. Two packets of Jaffa Cakes and a pack of Cadbury Fingers found their way into John’s basket, hopefully enough to satisfy Sherlock’s apparent chocolate cravings, along with a small jar of preserves to feed John’s jam obsession and the loaf of bread he’d come to the store for the day prior. A few single-serving pots of yoghurt in various flavours were added to the basket, because apparently Sherlock liked yoghurt, and John was, naturally, eager to please. Once satisfied he’d acquired enough consumables, he made his way to the queue, and on any other day he’d try very hard to chat up the young girl behind the cash drawer with the curly blonde hair and the peach-painted lips and the low-cut top, but today, he looked past her to the shelf with the tobacco products.
“An incompetent and eager-to-please member of New Scotland Yard’s finest,” Sherlock muttered with no small amount of venom, eyes flashing.
“The gang was founded sometime around 1970,” Sherlock explained, purely for John’s benefit, “with their first major heist taking place in 1975 when they robbed the Worthington Bank of around seven-thousand quid.” He glanced over to John, and was captivated by the raptness with which the doctor appeared to be listening to him. Sherlock had to look away again, wetting his lips unconsciously out of nervousness before he continued. “After the heist, they began leaving tags - this was mostly after 1980 when street art took hold in England,” he added, “but nonetheless, they adapted the name the newspapers at the time gave them: The Worthington Bank Gang. Cliché,” he said with a grimace and a shrug, “but understandable given that their talents lie in crime rather than originality. They developed a tattoo design - the one we saw on Blessington’s ankle - to distinguish gang members and brand them, as a way to prove their loyalty, and as a means of identification, should it be necessary.”
have you been?” It’s the first thing Sherlock can think to say, and it leaves his mouth in a raspy whisper, voice rendered gravelly with fatigue.
,” he said, voice cracking just slightly, betraying his devastation as his red-rimmed eyes fell upon his brother’s corpse. His face hardened, then, and his fist tightened in Sherlock’s hair, prompting the detective to gasp.
A look at his watch assured him that, in a few short hours, he would get to go home. No more scheduled appointments for the day. Maybe he would get lucky, and this walk-in would be his last--
Sherlock had spent more time in and around this new room than he cared to admit. And while the time he spent in there certainly wasn’t devoid of mulling over the finer details of John Watson, the space was dedicated to more than just a fanciful borderline-obsession; the room, and its atmosphere, brought about a sense of serenity and security that he otherwise lacked. It had proved, thus far, to be an almost therapeutic place where the detective could pour over case details; and while the John Watson in his head was no match for the real thing, this figment still wasn’t too bad of a soundboard for Sherlock to bounce ideas off of.
“I’m- no,” Sherlock answered, but his tone was less than confident, and there was an almost conflicted look on his face.
“221 Baker Street,” Sherlock addressed the taxi driver as he got settled, and the moment John shut his door, they were off.
Since John’s grouch-suppressants apparently weren’t genetically passed to his offspring, Sherlock tries offering Rosie all of the things that make
Disclaimer: I'm not intimate with London's anatomy. All of my info is coming from Google Earth and the internet, and I am definitely taking some liberties with it to fulfill my agenda, so don't hate me for my inaccuracies.
“These things tend to happen when I sober up,” Sherlock explained, though he didn’t feel confident. Whatever he’d been given the night previous wasn’t something he had experience with. He didn’t know how bad the crash would be, if there even was one; and he was pretty sure John wasn’t going to let him take a hit of something else to take any edge off. Before he knew what he was doing, he turned his head to glance at where his coat was hanging on a hook by the door (John had moved it there at some point, unbeknownst to him).
John instinctively raised his hands, and glanced at Sherlock to see the younger man rolling his eyes and half-heartedly putting his hands in the air by his shoulders, palms facing outward, looking for all the world like a horribly inconvenienced, stroppy teenager.
“I was kind of hoping we’d get closer this evening,” Molly said glumly. “But he was like a pile of bricks at the match. Barely said a word. He usually won’t shut up, no matter how much you want him to.”
“Start answering my owls,” the other replied, more dangerous than before. More than a challenge, it was a command.
“Sherlock! I’m so glad to see you came!” He seemed pleasantly surprised, and if it weren’t for the fact that John was straight, not to mention that they had only known each other for a week, Sherlock would have thought John was greeting his significant other. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking.
It was dark by the time Sherlock headed back to the flat. The lights were all off, and as soon as he approached the door, he knew something was wrong.
"I am quite the catch. I think Winnie Rollins has been eyeing me from across Mr. McKenzie's classroom."
As always, kudos make me smirk and blush like Sherlock when John says 'Brilliant,' and comments make me feel like murder-Christmas is early.
“I’m—” John was cut off when a wave broke over his face. As soon as it cleared, he coughed violently. “I’m stuck.”
“I should go,” Mrs. Hudson said, handing John a steaming mug. “Enjoy your tea, dear. And don’t make him wait too long, you know how he gets.”
John chuckled. Sherlock's curls were wrapped around his fingers tenderly. "By then it might be better to just get a dog."
“For god’s sakes, we’re leaving,” Sherlock said, abruptly standing and hauling his friends to their feet. The whole team stared at them as they left.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock hissed, sticking his head into the kitchen. John was sitting lazily on the sofa in the sitting room, commenting on all of Sherlock’s father’s questionable design choices.
"I suppose that isn't likely," John conceded. "But d'you really think we should be totally nude when someone does come in?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, John. One of them has magical properties, but I was hoping you’d go deeper.”
Sherlock was basking in the glory of it all when he heard Wilkes’s voice, much closer than it had been just a few moments before.
As soon as they were out of earshot of the Hall, Sherlock stopped and dragged John into one of his secret passages--which had admittedly been frequently used for purposes other than investigating lately--and, instead of drawing John in for a kiss or shoving him up against the wall, whipped around and whispered more urgently than before, "What happened?"
Hours later, after a stern but ultimately pointless talking-to from the Headmistress, John found himself in a chair next to Mycroft Holmes, of all people. Both boys were completely silent, Mycroft eyeing John just as suspiciously as he had in the carriage at the beginning of the year, if not more so.
The sounds were what he cared for most. Because most of the junkies went on their way silently--aside from the occasional mumbler--John could listen to the distant traffic of the inhabitable parts of the city. The sounds of the Thames faded to a small murmur; his own breaths, not laboured, but shallow--all he did was listen.
The next morning, Sherlock's mother smiled fondly when she walked into his room to check on them and found them curled into each other, sharing a pillow and sleeping soundly.
They ran into a girl from Sherlock's class, and two boys from John's, who were completely awed by Sherlock's costume. "Where did you
A few more drinks, and he found himself leaning against Sherlock’s bedroom door, eyes closed, mind whirring in frustration.
“Yes, and that is the only reason I tolerate it. But put something else on, there’s no way I can control myself if you snog me shirtless.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, simply led him by the hand down the hidden corridor, all the way downstairs, and down another corridor leading to a relatively boring painting of fruit in a bowl. When he tickled the pear, the painting swung forward, revealing a hole much like the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
They found Sherlock's mother just where they'd left her, listening to a violin concerto in the parking lot. When she spotted them walking towards the car, she reached around to unlock the back door. "No luck?"
Sherlock didn't just have a way with toddlers. He was equally as great at dealing with teenage clients and month-old infants when he came into contact with them. He had even developed a lovely dynamic with little Archie, after having first met him for the wedding. When John's cousins came up from Devon every year or so, Sherlock would spend hours reading with Archie while John caught up with his mother. The last time they'd visited, Archie had bypassed John altogether and held out his arms for Sherlock.
They continued perusing the photos from Sherlock’s childhood. Mrs. Holmes told him stories that made them both laugh and that would probably turn Sherlock’s whole head into a radish if he were in the room.
Sherlock finally dropped John’s hand so that both of his own could tangle in his hair. “No, I just—I like watching
It was such a rush, running alongside Sherlock as they were going after a suspect, or, as in this case, being chased
She tried to make it clear that there were no hard feelings, but it didn’t take a Holmes to see that there were in fact very many hard feelings, and that each and every one of them had something to do with Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock slipped his wand back into his pocket. He snaked his arms around John's shoulders as the musicians in the corner shot each other panicked looks which had escalated from simple confusion over the course of their dancing. He felt John shift his head so that his cheek rested against Sherlock's chest and he sighed, and Sherlock echoed it, and there wasn't anything he could do to keep himself from melting, resting his chin on the top of John's head and closing his eyes as they swayed. They took tiny steps around the floor, most of the movement in their upper bodies, each of them contentedly following the other's motions and smiling to himself.
John groaned himself awake, stretching his arms above his head with a yawn before turning over and snuggling into the solid body next to him. He didn't immediately realize that a foreign body in his bed wasn't normal, but when the fact registered, his eyes snapped open and he jumped to his feet. “Sherlock!”
“Come here!” John commanded. It was the only thing that seemed to reach Sherlock sometimes, and as John suspected, he did as he was told. “Sit,” he said, and gestured to the submerged stair beside him. He took a seat as well.
For the moment that Sherlock's lips touched his, John forgot that they were in public. He forgot the awkward encounter with the young man, forgot that they still had cake to eat.
“Why on earth not?” She leaned conspiratorially toward John. “He was the sweetest boy, always with his Muggle pirate books and—oh! The errant curl!” Sherlock groaned as she and John giggled.
John laughed. "Yeah, okay. That one's easy. Two drops of Lethe River Water, two Valerian sprigs, two measures of Standard Ingredient, four mistletoe berries."
"We go back and forth telling secrets about ourselves. For every secret I tell, I get to do something to you, and you get to do the same to me when you tell a secret."
"Of course not. It's just--a girl chatting you up because she thinks you're another girl? It's funny. The situation itself is funny."
Mycroft suddenly looked frustrated and confused, if only for a brief second. “Precisely. Why? What’s in it for you?”
Still, he weighed the risks involved with arguing further against the alternative of letting Sherlock magically wipe the mess away and decided that at worst a trip to the hospital wing might give him fair opportunity to shoot a rare “told-you-so” glare at Sherlock Holmes.
He was so used to spitting out things he noticed that it hadn’t occurred to him that he shouldn’t know about the Whitney Houston merchandise Wilkes kept locked away in his bedroom closet, safe, but hidden from the world. It simply wasn’t
When he stepped off the train, John instantly climbed into the nearest carriage, joining a tall, dark-haired boy he recognized as the Ravenclaw Seeker and a fellow fifth year, Sherlock Holmes,as well as a severe-looking teen with a Head Boy badge and vaguely similar features.
Without really meaning to, John nodded. He was curious about this Moriarty bloke, most importantly why he’d kidnapped him and tried to feed him to the giant squid. "Yeah. Sherlock, what’s going on?"
“Why does that not surprise me,” John said, rolling his eyes and grinning at Sherlock, who was clearly trying as hard as he could not to give away the smile that was beginning to crack the corners of his stoic, disapproving lips.
Sherlock let go with his left hand, reaching for the next bar. The tiny fingers of his right hand slipped almost immediately, and he landed on the mulch below with a small thump and a crunching sound.
John’s arms snaked around Sherlock’s waist and he burrowed his head against his chest. He felt him shiver.
Without so much as a bubbly warning, the substance inside the cauldron exploded. Sherlock, almost on impulse it seemed, pushed John behind him. The smoke was thick and brown, and smelt of rotten cabbage.
"Why should I let you beat yourself up over something you can't control? Especially something that doesn't matter?"
"Don't you think it might have been a good idea to check the weather before you decided to waltz off to a dodgy ski resort for a case?"
The best way to keep track of any suspicious activity among students, Sherlock decided, was to continue attending lessons as normal, if not more often than was typical of him.
"No!" John nearly shouted. Sherlock turned back to him quizzically. John coughed. "No, um, you look...fine. It's all fine." He was stuck with the memory of the first meal they'd shared - sort of. He'd uttered the same words in a different context, but was suddenly uncomfortable at their familiarity.
He heard Molly sigh in frustration behind him, but as soon as he lifted his head to look at John, he knew he'd done the right thing. John's eyes shone with grateful tears, and he patted Sherlock's knee. "Alright, your turn, Jack," John said suddenly to the boy on his right, breaking his eye contact with Sherlock.
“Excuse you, Sherlock, for using such language at the table!” Wendy interjected, her attention latching onto Sherlock’s flub, relishing in the fact that he was far from a perfect child. “Shame on you, Violet, for letting your boys speak in such a way in front of guests. Or at all, for that matter!”
He visited one of his old mates, who was charmed by Sarah. In fact, John was ashamed to admit he’d been relieved for Sarah to have a distraction so that he could worry about Sherlock some more while they were out to lunch with him.
When he finally looked up, John was beaming at him, but frowned after a second. "You okay?" he mouthed covertly, and Sherlock nodded shakily.
“I’m sure Dad and Mummy will open their present from you along with those from Mycroft and me. Mycroft and I will open your gifts to us, and you’ll open our gifts to you.”
“Well, I thought we would eat soon, and considering your mother’s probably down there ready to have that ‘proper chat’ you promised her earlier, I wanted to have a few minutes alone with you,” John explained.
"Or you could go with me to take notes," John conceded. He smirked. "You just want to spend the day with me tomorrow, don't you?"
Sherlock pulled out a chair, and John took it just as Mr. Holmes cleared his throat and took a sip of wine. A sound from the kitchen seemed to draw him in, and when he came back, he was carrying two large dishes, which he somehow managed to place on the table without dropping.
Both of them laughed at that, but immediately went back to sulking at the sight of Mr. Holmes's professional-grade camera. "You're not really going to take
But I don't know if I've really thanked you guys for reading my lowly fic. At this point, about halfway through, I'd like to do that. Thanks. Every time there's a new bookmark or comment I smile like an idiot. So thank you.
As the Christmas holidays drew nearer, John did everything he could to distract himself from that fact. He focused on keeping up with his schoolwork and practiced brewing potions, and when that didn’t work, put in a request with McGonagall and the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher to reinstate the Dueling Club that had disbanded a few years before.
It was during his shower, exactly a week after moving into his new room, that things began to get interesting, because that was when, just as he'd rinsed the shampoo from his hair, the fire alarm went off.
Sherlock spent his morning class time not working on his spelling, or maths, but thinking about what John had said about kissing.
Mycroft seemed to be resisting the urge to wrinkle his nose as his mother said, “Well, it’s settled then. On Sunday night, we’ll have shepherd's pie. And for dessert?”
Sherlock did the bare minimum and folded his legs where he sat on the floor. He’d already taken his shoes off when he came in; he didn’t need any furniture-collapsing mishaps to make the evening more interesting.
"How was I supposed to know I'd fall in love with you?" Sherlock shot at him, then nearly put a hand over his mouth.
John almost looked all around the room for the source of the sudden tension, bewildered at the change in atmosphere. The smile threatening to break through on Sherlock’s face disappeared completely, to be replaced by annoyance and…was that hurt?
She sighed. “Look, I don’t know what you think you’re doing hanging around him, but I’m telling you, it’s a bad idea.”
"Let's hope he can get over the embarrassment of his partner's roommate walking in on him about to reach orgasm," Sherlock muttered, sending John into a fresh fit of mirth. He resisted saying something else to make John laugh. It was a nice laugh.
By the time John came out in his dressing gown, damp fringe clinging to his forehead, Sherlock had only changed positions: the sheet was now wrapped around his head, and he was curled up into a ball at one end of the sofa with just his nose and eyes peeking out of his white linen cocoon.
"You know the way he was looking at you the other day? I've known him for two years, been to dozens of parties hosted by mutual friends, and I've never seen him look at
Sherlock smirked. He held up his prop crystal ball dramatically. "Tell me, John," he said in his best Goblin King impression, "what do you think of my Labyrinth?"
John stared in horror as she pulled from withing layers of packaging materials another suit, green, with ruffles around the neck.
John considered whether he was imagining the disappointment and guilt in that last text as he opened the one from Lestrade.
“Well it’s obvious, isn’t it?” Mary said. She was polishing her wand rather more than was necessary, as though if she were to leave fingerprints she would be betraying its trust. “Just because the most powerful Dark wizard in history is dead doesn’t mean evil itself is.”
John actually blushed. The sight of his cheeks reddening under ruffled hair made Sherlock want to jump him all over again.
John was just about to give Harry her third proper warning when he felt something extremely warm near his wrist. He looked down to find his robes on fire.
Sherlock tugged at the hem of his polyester tunic, but was otherwise the embodiment of calm and collected. "Hello, John. Your costume is..." He didn't know what to say. Nice? Lovely? Well-fit?
“That requires quite a bit of strong magic, dear,” his mother cut in. “Only the Council can legally carry it out. You’ll need special permission.”
you do! I like watching all of your unique habits, like the way you pinch the bridge of your nose when you study something particularly difficult and the way you lick your lips when you smile and, yes, the way you chew your food primarily on the right side of your mouth. I just like watching…you. And I can’t very well do that when I’m distracted by things like
"John is gonna love it," Victor said, straightening the crown atop Sherlock's head. He'd been a valuable resource in finding a costume--it turned out his scavenging skills were nothing to be scoffed at. The outfit he'd found was a touch too roomy in places, however, and at the moment he was busy fastening bits of fabric in the most flattering way possible.
The one class they shared was in Literature. An exam was scheduled for that Friday. As it turned out, neither had actually read
John wanted to erase that smirk from his lips in the most effective way he knew how, but thought better of just attacking his boyfriend’s mouth in front of said boyfriend’s parents. Even if they were fully aware that he was likely to later.
"That doesn't mean you can go after him," Sherlock shot at her, then realized what he'd done and went red.
"Whatever you say, John," Sherlock replied, diving in to mouth at John's throat. Then he stopped. "You know that I'm not going to actually do it, right?"
“But that’s all the same, I’m sure you understand, Mikey, old boy,” Andrew was saying to Sherlock, clapping him on the shoulder as though he’d continued talking through the tense moment. Maybe he had.
“I don’t care. You know what happened last week with the bookshelves. You are ten years old, and a very bright child, I expect you to be able to come and tell me when your three-year-old brother is about to do something that might get him killed, even if you can’t put a stop to it yourself.”
When they reached the pitch, John sprinted toward the Gryffindor changing room without so much as a goodbye.
“Not exactly. He had his wand out, ready to curse me before my mother could even react, but…” He stopped, unsure of how to put it delicately. He decided on the simple truth. “His wand flew out of his hand, then the chandelier fell on him.”
"Of course, John. We're going to a renaissance faire," Sherlock replied, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
He was cut off by a scream as Sherlock's elbow bumped the pot, sending boiling water to the floor. John knew he was too late when Sherlock began hopping from foot to foot, whimpering.
John paused at her tone, then went on, “Yeah, he’s a genius at Potions. A genius at lots of things, really.”
“You’re going into Hogsmeade with me tomorrow,” Sherlock said suddenly across the table they’d inhabited in the library for the past few evenings.
Sherlock began to pout, so John hurried with removing the food from its case: two sandwiches, two bags of crisps, two bottles of water, and what remained of the cake Mrs. Hudson had brought them on Tuesday. Playing a peanut butter sandwich on front of Sherlock, John said, "Eat something. You're a lot less grumpy when you've eaten."
It was an honest misunderstanding, he knew, but that didn't change the awkwardness of having to explain to the poor new girl from chemistry that a) he was male, and b) he had a boyfriend. When she'd walked up to him at his table that day--Valentine's, no less--he'd been baffled. It was when she began asking if he'd like to see a movie that night that he looked up and peered at her through his safety goggles.
"One month," Sherlock reminded him--as if he needed reminding--while trailing his toes further and further up John's thigh.
"Jesus--Sherlock, come on." He dragged Sherlock to the bathroom and forced him to sit on the edge of the tub. Studying Sherlock's feet, he turned the taps. "Doesn't look too bad, just some first-degree burns. Here," he said, and promptly shoved Sherlock's feet under the cold spray.
“Wendy, dear, how are you?” she said, sweet but reserved, as though appraising the situation while still hoping to keep it under control.
Sherlock stopped momentarily to stare at him, before continuing walking and talking at the same time. “We’re going into the village together. That’s what I observe so-called ‘couples’ doing every time they have the chance. Sure, friends walk to Hogsmeade together, but you specifically asked me to. That implies a date. That, and the fact that you didn’t object to me kissing you earlier this morning.”
By the time dessert came round—a rather large chocolate cake with the richest frosting John had ever tasted—Sherlock was beginning to get antsy. He barely made a single remark about Mycroft having a second piece, which John thought odd; Sherlock never missed an opportunity to tease Mycroft, especially if Mycroft was actually around to hear his commentary. However, it was clear by the time Sherlock abruptly asked, “May we be excused?” that he was simply bored with the proceedings when he could be snogging John next to his prized experiments.
“Right. Thanks, Mycroft. Gotta dash.” Sherlock was pulling on his coat before Mycroft could ask what he intended to use it for.
At the same time, he heard John shout and saw a silver light through his eyelids. He smiled, keeping them closed. He’d done it. He’d actually done it.
As fantastic as the chases were, this was the best part of a case, in John's opinion--the conclusion of if all, when they got to go home and make out like teenagers until they passed out on the sofa, exhausted from days without substantial sleep. Usually they at least made it long enough to see Lestrade make the arrest.
"John, John, John," Sherlock kept muttering weakly against his shoulder, smearing blood on his coat.
"No, I'm here. But I should probably go." He stood and stepped gingerly toward the door. "If...if you need anything, I can leave my number..."
Sherlock hesitantly complied. His fingers were slight at first, but quickly grabbed onto John’s thumb, vicelike.
Sherlock didn't say another word, but closed his eyes and left John to his own thoughts as he watched him for hours.
"John, it's beautiful!" Molly exclaimed, her wide eyes reflecting the eerie colours of the tiny flames surrounding them.
It took him all of five seconds to make up his mind. He stood, then dragged Sherlock to his feet as well.
He grinned, shook his head. “Of course not. Come here,” he said, using both hands to pull Sherlock’s head down and kiss him deeply once more, just as Sherlock shifted his hips. They both gasped against each other as they aligned at the movement, and Sherlock’s hips stuttered another seemingly involuntary thrust.
John shook his head. "I just can't believe you didn't notice the knife he had concealed inside his jacket," John teased, and Sherlock finally smiled, though hesitantly.
The rest of his mind was occupied by the sensation of dry-humping his boyfriend hands-free. It was like being seven years younger in a parallel dimension. Sherlock rutted against him with the head of his cock peeking over the waistband of his underwear and his shirt rucked up around his ribs, so that their bare stomachs were in constant contact, and their chests heaved in time with their movements and each other.
“Dad’s rather good at healing charms,” Sherlock said to John, holding out an arm with no trace that it had ever been anything but completely healthy. John looked over at him and smiled.
“Why do you have that?” he asked as Sherlock placed it on his head, clearly disgusted with himself for doing so.
"Mr. Holmes," Professor McGonagall began, but then she saw John slightly behind him. For a moment, she seemed at a loss for words. "Mr. Watson! What on earth are  you doing up here?"
John said goodbye to his team, assuring them he would keep them posted on his injury. "I don't expect it'll be that bad," he told Sherlock. "Just looks like a mild sprain. Better safe than sorry, though."
“Oh, hush, now,” Mrs. Holmes intervened before Sherlock could start telepathically tossing potatoes at his brother. “He can’t stay locked up forever. He’s a teenager, Myc.”
John looked around frantically. He caught Harry’s eye and found a horrified expression. “I didn’t think he’d actually
He felt fingers at his wrist. John's fingers. He slowly allowed himself to look up at John's silhouette against the brightness of the blue sky reflected in the ceiling of the Great Hall. "What happened?" he demanded, though it might have come out in a more fragile tone than he'd anticipated.
Finally, the phone was lowered from Moriarty’s ear. “Sorry. Wrong day to die.” He seemed disappointed, but also a little lost in thought, like a new plan was in the works, one that required all of the brainpower he could muster.
John was startled when Sherlock stood and looked around before discreetly making his way up the aisle between tables, headed for the giant double-doors.
“Bloody git,” John grumbled as he walked out of Sherlock’s bedroom and over to the small door that he presumed was the closet Sherlock had referred to.
Sherlock stopped suddenly, and John nearly left him behind before noticing him kneeling close to the ground, studying something buried in leaves. “What is it?” John asked, unable to contain his curiosity.
His blush deepened, but he didn't say anything. He thought about all the times he'd wondered whether they
The look on Sherlock’s face was one of guarded relief as he looked hesitantly down at him. “You don’t have to do that,” he mumbled, his fingers twitching against the fabric of the duvet he sat atop of.
The terror and paralyzing fear that were audible in Sherlock’s voice were entirely missing from his eyes - which Pavel wouldn’t see, given his position, standing an inch taller than Sherlock, and at his side rather than face to face. John blinked - had he missed something?
he thinks, anticipating a long night ahead of him, at least until John returns.

Closing his eyes, he tips his head back, and folds his hands together over his stomach, intending to keep a diligent watch over John’s daughter until the man returns home.
