Panic errupts. Mycroft's face twists with the emotion of fear that he expresses for the second in five minutes.
“Have you tried talking to him? You could tell him he’s being bad and that if he doesn’t stop, you’ll obliterit… oblitera… destroy him with your umbrella.”
Had he misunderstood the conversation he’d overheard? After everything John had done for him, how else could he say thank you? He’d thought John wanted it…
“Please,” he chokes out, “please take him to a hospital.”
“Why don’t you let Them get me a present, Pa?”
“Let’s get you back to your room, then you can sleep. Tonight, we’ll have another meal and tomorrow we can leave the hospital. You’ll still have regular visits from the doctors. Jack is going to see a proper child's psychiatrist.”
“I know it’s a shock, but you’ll get used to it. What do you think?”
Jack bites his lip and thinks this over. “But you’re Pa.”
There's a pause as the man tries to come up with an answer.
Mycroft assesses Jack, his poker face impeccable. Jack peeks at him through his hair and Sherlock’s guts twist anxiously. He smiles. “Hello, Jack. Thank you for saving my little brother.”
“Men aren’t raped by women, Sherlock, can you imagine the shame of telling everyone?”
Something goes SMASH! in the kitchen. I jump right off the ground and hug uncle Mycroft’s leg. John yells three words which make uncle Mycroft hiss and shout “there’s a child here!”
Sherlock wipes his face. “I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to listen to that. You probably think I'm...”
Sherlock jumps to his feet, ignoring the pain in his leg. Mycroft also stands and puts himself between his brother and their parents. The only sound is Sherlock’s heavy breathing.
Sherlock pulls him closer. You won’t be Half-Real. You’ll be just the same as you are now, but not in Room. You’ll be fine, don’t you worry about a thing.”
The other man cut him off. “You knew each other at university. You brought him here because I told you that I was looking for a flatmate. You were gone for two hours, so you bumped into each other, had coffee going by the smell of your breath. You weren't brilliantly close, because you, Mike, were not eager to tell me his name; so in the same class at University, not overly friendly. That tells me you most likely sat on a bench outside; after all discussing things over a table with someone you barely recognize would result in awkwardness for both of you.” A sly smile passed over his face. “Am I right?”
Sherlock swallows a few times to compensate for his inability to speak. “John.” he whimpers eventually.
Sherlock tells his story before Jack's birth and things take a turn for the worst. Warnings for implied past sexual abuse.
Mike ignores Sherlock’s tone. “You will be, Jack, you will be.” He stands up. “Your parents are here, Mr. Holmes, but they want to talk to me before they see you. Perhaps you would like to see them outside, or would you rather be in here?”
Jack has to try and escape...
“No,” Sherlock grips Lestrade’s shirt tightly. “I need to do this. Let me do this. I haven’t had free will for too long, you will let me do this. If you carry me out, you’ll give my son a heart attack, I need to reassure him. I can wait until later.”
“You have to believe me, this is the truth, this is reality, this is who I was before Room.”
“He’s alive! Mr. Holmes, can you hear me? My name is Detective Lestrade, everything’s going to be okay.”
JACK MYCROFT HOLMES
Cold dread grips Sherlock's heart; he clambers off John and kneels in the grass. “I'm sorry. I was thinking about Them and I panicked.”
Mycroft hugs him so tightly it hurts and Lestrade still holds his gaze. He has to finish.
"Help me!" he screams at the frozen members of Scotland Yard around him. "HELP ME!"
“No pulse,” he states quietly and reaches to pull the rest of Rug off Jack’s face.
Lestrade stands next to him, calm. He looks better than he has done in weeks.
He can't tell Sherlock how his son died. Can't tell him about tonight either. Although, knowing Sherlock, he will probably work it out eventually.
I nod sadly. “He misses Lestrade.”
Sherlock smiles, remembering. “I did. I couldn’t decide at first, but in the end…”
John always wakes up filled with self-hatred and tears running down his cheeks. Every time, he’s relieved to see Sherlock strut into the kitchen, oblivious to John’s haunting nightmares and fear of losing Sherlock. John detests those dreams. He almost wants to hate Sherlock for being the source of the fear.
John's ears are ringing. He stares at Sherlock, who eventually smirks and John can't believe he didn't see through him in the first place.
“Vitamin!” he squeals, holding it up like a trophy, before popping it into his mouth. Sherlock smiles at him, then winces as he takes a bite of breakfast and cups his jaw, groaning. Jack watches him with all the concern of a five-year-old.
“But I have the best nose in the family.”
"In our favour or theirs?" They sit opposite each other.
“I’m a genius, John.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak, but stops to glance down at Jack who is hiding behind his legs. Glancing at his parents, he immediately notices a change in their behavior. His mother’s face is rigid and she stares at Jack with a certain intensity that frightens him. Sherlock smiles uncertainly and gestures the benches. “Could we sit down? My leg is rather sore,” he whispers.
The smile he gives him makes Sherlock’s heart flutter. He thinks back to the conversation he heard between Mycroft and John. Whilst Mycroft’s statements had left him feeling vulnerable and scared of his brother, he hadn’t forgotten the part where Mycroft mentioned that John had feelings for him. His heart flutters excitedly. “John.”
An elderly women totters in and Sherlock gapes. He tries to stand and John immediately helps him up. Jack hides behind his legs. Sherlock continues to stare. “Mrs. Hudson?”
“I want to see you.” Repeats Sherlock, whimpering. “I want to see you.”
. He had treated people suffering from facial injuries and blindness in Afghanistan.
Sherlock's face goes from green to deathly pale in record time. "Get me out of here, John."
“You can’t have him. I won’t let you touch him.”
John snorts. “Should I start keeping an eye on my wardrobe?”
John could only gape. The speed at which Sherlock spoke was enough to make anyone double take, but the confidence with which he conversed and the content... How could he possibly know all of this?
Sorry this is a bit late. I would like to thank everyone for their support and kind, wonderful words, every Kudo, bookmark and comment has meant the world to me, so thank you. It's keeping my attention on this story. Enjoy!
“I don’t understand,” says Sherlock quietly, watching them leave. “Jack really wanted to meet you.”
Mike twiddles his thumbs nervously. “I know that, but he’s never been in contact with most of the germs we are used to, he will need time to adapt to people, the outside, sunlight in particular and he’s a bit small for his age, probably due to lack of nourishment. There may be other things too.”
A look of surprise crosses Old Magnussen’s face, “You’ve drugged him.”
“I missed you,” he says. “I missed you so much. I can’t imagine how worried you must have been. I’m so sorry.”
"Think you're dead." finishes Mycroft. "A couple baring the same blood types as you both were in a car that caught fire. Now they're in your cells, a part of the prison that has also happened to catch fire. And my boyfriend charmed the Medical Examiner."
“Not to seem rude, but asides from the sergeants at the crime scene...” He noted Sherlock's raised eyebrows. “Well okay, only Lestrade seemed to accept that your facts were true.”
Screaming. Gunshots. Yelling. John collapses to his knees and covers his ears, trying to protect his head by hunching over. Tears drip from his eyes without his permission. The screaming intensifies until it's just a white noise. He pants a couple of breaths and risks looking up.
His eyes close.
Both men avoid looking at each other. The silence is heavy with embarrassment.
"Ah... Yes..."
“Didn’t you see what They did to me last night? They were going to hurt you, Jack! I’m trying to protect you! I’m trying to make you see that there’s more to the world than this stinky Room!”
Sherlock ignores the first question. “No, Jack, my parents never lived in Room. I wasn’t born here. Old Magnussen and the Witch brought me here when I was sixteen years old.”
“It has my eyes.” She whispers. Her voice is emotionless. He’s not fooled though.
"Mycroft." His mother comes towards him. She looks shaken. "Mycroft... Detective Lestrade showed us the footage..."
Anthea, however, does not immediately leave. “Sir?”
She’s shocked by my question but answers honestly, as I predicted. “Well, if I were to meet you for the first time, I would think you are a girl. Why do you ask?”
The Witch snorts. “What for?” she laughs, “He’s not going anywhere!”
“I worry when I know something is wrong but I don’t know what.” I try not to cry. “I don’t know what’s happening to Pa, so I’m worried. If I have to worry about the unknown bad scaring you, it’s going to scare me too. Don’t make me worry even more, uncle Mycroft.”
There’s an awkward pause. “We’re not going back, Jack.”
Now I’ve really broken him. He stares and then laughs really hard. “Sorry. I’m not making fun of you. It’s just very strange that you can give advice about dealing with National Security, but you don’t know what a seal is. Where’s your encyclopaedia? I’ll show you.”
“That’s ok. Here you go, tell me if it tastes like rat poison.”
Back at the flat, he heads straight to the bathroom. John calls out to him, probably to talk about that disastrous attempt at a kiss. He ignores him.
“Shouldn’t you let Sherlock decide who he sees and who takes care of him?”
Jack gasps, his eyes bright. “Like on TV?”
"Evil! EVIL! I WANT TO SEE PA! I'LL BITE YOU! I'LL-"
“There is one difference, Doctor.” Mycroft’s voice was like ice. “I am his brother. I will not…
He hurries down the steps and sees him out. And stares at the door that's keeping him trapped in Sherlock's nightmares. The world is turning without him beyond that door. He doesn't care for it. Not if Sherlock and Jack can't feel it turn with him.
John huffs out a laugh. He’s going to take Sherlock back to Baker street, drag him up the seventeen steps, haul him into his bed and have his way with him, scary dreams be damned. Sherlock wouldn’t lose any of his other senses, although if he could make him speechless, that would be a major…
“You’re exceptionally slow today, Sherlock.” Says Old Magnussen, undoing his belt. “Now be a good boy and take off your clothes, there’s a good chap.”
Sherlock nods and fills up two plastic cups at the sink. The silence behind him indicates he’s being watched. He takes a breath and turns around to face Them and hands Them their cups. They’ve sat down on the only two chairs, so Sherlock sits down on the edge of Bed. They eye him up and down and Sherlock returns their gaze. The Witch tuts.
“Yes, but you know, Mind over Matter,” says Sherlock, tapping his temple with his forefinger.
Fat lot of good that had done.
Lestrade frowns. "So she wasn't stillborn?"
Sherlock tosses his brush into the bucket full of hot water in frustration. “You shouldn’t be listening to that, Jack.”
"Anyway, I'll see you later. I'll text you the time. Take care, John." He's gone before John can laugh at the horror of it all.
“When was that?”
“I’ll tell them that he’s my son,” grits out Sherlock. “I’ll tell them that he’s my son and that I love him.”
John knows how he dreams. He dreams of lieutenant Patterson bleeding out in the sand, the smell of gunfire in the air, explosions around him and John’s screaming orders, but there’s no one to obey because everyone’s
There’s the sound of movement and Chain rattles as Pa approaches. The clonk as something is put down in front of him.
“Does everyone live in a Room?”
“John,” says Sherlock, cutting off his panicked thoughts, as if he knows what John is thinking, “just because I cannot see you and just because I have no experience with
“Hey!” yells the Witch. “You know the rules! Face the wall while we tap the code in!” She struggles to lift her end of Rug higher.
Sherlock’s expression turns to stone. “That’s when it all went wrong.”
"Did I hurt it?"
Sherlock wants to scream at him, but there’s no sound. He chokes on his pillow and pants for breath. His eyes water and he bites his tongue in desperation to keep quiet. “For Jack,” he tells himself. “JackJackJackJackJackJackJack…” Sherlock tries not to analyse anything and keeps still. He doesn’t react when his arms and neck are released. He closes his eyes and ignores the tears that drip into his pillow. He can hear Him putting his clothes back on, but he doesn’t move. He doesn’t want to attract their attention.
Hope this still feels the same, I gave John more room here (oh the pun, the terrible pun) Mystrade probably felt a bit out of the blue, but when is Mycroft ever predictable? They won't feature too much, just the possibility of Sherlock and Jack and by some extension John gaining an ever expanding family.
“I don’t know, just surprise him. He might see you as a worthy opponent. Like the bad guy in the movie who compliments the hero.”
Lestrade grins and waves.
“Of course, dear! Are you sure?”
"Sherlock, I know you've just relieved the worst moments of your life, but I'm begging you... don't do anything stupid.
Jack sobs into John’s jumper. John grips him tighter and presses a kiss into his newly cut hair. “Get out, Mycroft.”
Jack runs across the room and throws himself onto John, covering him with his smaller body. “NO! Please! PLEASE DON’T HURT HIM! PLEASE! HE’S THE SOMEBODY, HE’S SPECIAL, I WON’T LET YOU! I WON’T!”
“And you.”
John starts to walk away, but Violet Holmes calls out to him. “Doctor Watson, would you watch the child for a moment?” She turns to Sherlock. “We would like to speak to you alone,” she tells him.
Sherlock and John stare at each other for an inappropriate amount of time and don't realize that Mycroft is still talking to them. Jack watches them both until he crawls off his Pa's lap and sits between them, holding a hand each. Mycroft clears his throat.
Sherlock can't
“My name is John, I'm your friend. Our landlady and Jack are with us. Your brother dropped us off at a field, there's a picnic waiting for us and you
Sherlock doesn't look at John as he answers. "I will be. I've got Jack."
John blinks, surprised. That one time in the hopspital seemed bad enough. Right before Sherlock's Episode From Hell. They'd stopped because it had become too much for both the Holmes brothers. John pulls a face at the memory and Lestrade nods.
“Would you like me to wake up your son?” asks the Witch, “Or perhaps you’d like a chain around your neck as well?”
Ahhhh!! I've finished my thésis, had a small nap and now it must be beginning of July, I have plenty of time… WHAT?! August 19th?????? WHAT HAPPENED??? :(
Uncle Mycroft flinches hard when I say Lestrade’s name. That’s not normal. “Is he OK? Did something bad happen?”
"I was so mad... it got physical, but not for long because she still had a hold on him and he was screaming so loudly... I begged them to stop, to give him back..."
“Your limp is psychosomatic, it’s from trauma. Normally I’d expect you to have a walking stick or…”
Gentle fingers ran across the lines in his face, brushed every inch as though reading him like braille, before humming as though satisfied with what he had learned.
John nods, mainly for himself. “Female, Caucasian, late thirties or early forties, blond, blue eyes, what most people would have considered attractive. However,” He places that isn’t in Sherlock’s palm onto his back and guides them both to a crouching level. “overweight, blotchy skin, was obviously letting herself go. No makeup, greying hair around the temples, short, doesn’t reach the shoulders. She’s wearing a black coat, her stripy blue scarf is from Marks and Spencer’s, high heels look like any ordinary footwear from the high street, also black. I can’t see the rest of her clothes, the coat is done up.” He grips Sherlock’s hand a little tighter. “Want me to start on the cause of death?”
Jack eventually tiptoes over, his brown eyes refilling with tears. "It's okay, Jack, I promise. Do you remember that I was injured when I was a soldier? Well you got me with that sword right where I was shot and I had a flashback. Just like when you get scared and hear noises you don't know that make you think of monsters. Well, it's the same with my injury."
"He had a lot like that... Wore them to prove that he was smarter than me because he could force me to wear nothing, so he was better than me." He bites his lip. "Please don't be mad."
She’s very pleased to see me. “Oh! Hello sweetheart! Come in, I’ll make you a nice hot cocoa. Not your housekeeper, mind.”
He’s never cried so hard in his life. He breathes heavily into his hand, far too fast, the agony too strong for him to contain. He doesn’t know how long it lasts, but he suddenly feels as though he’s being watched. Hastily wiping his face on his T-shirt, he glances over his shoulder at Wardrobe. Jack wears an uncertain expression and he can’t look his Pa in the eye. He shuffles around Table and rests his head on Sherlock’s knee. The man’s breathing is still stuttering and he struggles to get it under control. He tangles his fingers in Jack’s hair and almost misses his son’s whispered words.
The quiet is perfect. It’s all around me and I can almost feel it holding me like Pa. If I close my eyes and can make myself and all the sadness disappear.
“Right,” says Sherlock, stretching, “Come here, young man. I’m going to walk you to school.”
deduce Them correctly. His asking for a present for Jack reignited an interest in Them. He feels sick. This is all his fault. All he can do is divert Their attention. He’s not a religious man, but he’s close to praying at this point.
“I’m disappointed in you, Sherlock. What happened to that young, spiteful boy we brought into our home? I preferred him to the quivering mess you are now. We’ll be back tomorrow.”
A small gasp and running feet can be heard. John smiles. He's never woken up before Sherlock and Jack before and Jack has never spied on him before. Sherlock must still be asleep. Good. God knows the man needed his sleep.
“No,” Old Magnussen’s voice is the equivalent of a bomb destroying Sherlock’s imperfect plan. “We’ll be back tomorrow with medicine.”
He can see it. Jack growing up, with Mycroft watching over him and driving him mad as he himself was driven mad by his older brother. Jack living with his grandparents, going to school, proving how clever he is…
John nods, pleased. "It's a good story. Perhaps uncle Mycroft will read it for you." He throws Mycroft a pointed look, and the British Government glares back.
Jack reflects on his birthday and his life in Room.
Mycroft takes a moment to work up the courage. "Don't hurt yourself."
I hope Mycroft is Mycroftly enough in this...
"J-John," stammers the enemy, "you're a doctor."
"John?" the man senses a change in his behaviour. "Do you remember me?"
“Hello? Mycroft?”
"I hear Jack is making your brother a sword. We no longer have any tin foil."
"YOU'RE A GENIUS! YOU'RE A GENIUS! DON'T LOSE IT! HARDER MYCROFT! SLAP THOSE GIGANTIC BALLS AGAINST MY--"
Suddenly, he truly looks like Mycroft. Mycroft Holmes in his perfect suit, somehow green screened into Afghanistan.
Molly shakes her head, sad. "No. There was too much dirt in the mouth and chest. I'm certain he was buried alive."
“Jck,” groans Sherlock, eyelids fluttering as he tries to focus.
Stamford holds up a hand. "Before we start, Sherlock, when did you last take your medication?"
Mycroft nods. John has never seen him nod before. "He's by your feet John."
He shuts the door, but doesn't lock it. He turns the tap and washes his face. Then his eyes land on the razors.
“No thinking about my brother when I’m about to perform a fellatio on you, thank you very much.” Says Sherlock, reading his mind as is standard with him. “It just puts us both off.”
“Good.” They dust the crumbs off onto the floor he’d cleaned earlier that day. That makes Jack cross. He doesn’t want them to spoil Pa’s hard work.
“It has something to do with the knife, I presume?”
"I... don't... follow." The whisper barely passes his lips.
"Well, that explains why he refused to sit down throughout a three hour conference this morning." mutters a woman's voice.
John shouts from the kitchen. “Don’t you even think about considering it! He’s your nephew, a child! A CHILD!”
him.”
"He'll be here in ten. God, when this is over, I'm drinking myself into an early retirement."
John is too far gone to form a vocal response to that.
“So?” I ask. “I could pretend to be you.” I hold his leg tighter. “That might surprise him.”
John’s eyebrows hit new heights. “Are you sure it was only logical?”
“Yes, you do,” Jack squints at him. “You’re lying, Pa.”
She gets tears in her eyes. “I’m very glad you think so, Jack. I’ve never really had a family. I’ve never had children. Sherlock and John are the only people I would consider to be as such.”
"Nothing, it's fine." His fingers betray him and jerk. He hopes the right leg won't go next. He doesn't have a cane anymore. "Come here, Jack. It wasn't your fault, everything's okay."
Jack takes his hand and John and Sherlock share a look as they walk away.
Mrs. Hudson finds a picnic basket and everyone, with the exception of Mycroft, gets together to make sandwiches. Jack insists he is a big boy now because he's five, so he makes sandwiches with butter, ham and cheese. They pack their food and drinks before fleeing to Mycroft's car, their heads down to avoid the media still camping out at the end of the street. John immediately notices a change in Sherlock's behaviour. While he is tensed and scared, the relief at freedom is obvious; after all, he didn't escape that vault, just to be locked up in an apartment.
John stares at him blankly. Sherlock turns his head in his direction and raises an eyebrow. Then they both collapse, snickering at the absurdity that is Mycroft Holmes.
The smaller man blinked rapidly, to hide his confusion. Not that it worked. “I'm sorry, where are we going?”
He waits until he has his breathing under control to properly assess the situation. Sherlock's hands are fluttering like he doesn't know what to do. He looks so young and terrified that John finds the inner strength to slowly sit up, mindful of his shoulder. The door flies open and Mrs. Hudson comes flying in wielding a frying pan. Even Jack stops crying at the sight.
Sherlock freezes. “You know you’re not supposed to talk about him, Jack.”
Sherlock breathes out through his nose and stares him down. It’s the only victory he can get in his current situation. “I was hoping Jack could have some books. I’d like to start educating him.”
“No, I need to see… I need to see them with my own eyes. Take me to the morgue…” his voice starts slurring again, as the tablets kick in. He’s
now.”
“What is it, Mycroft?”
He’s the only one who has walked through my barriers as if they were open doors. I do not understand it. I did not like it at first. But then his ex-wife sent him a message about ruining his life and keeping everything he’s ever owned… And I snapped. I’m not sure if I’ve done this love thing in order. Does banishing one’s love interest’s ex-wife count as a first date?”
"FUCK ME LIKE YOU MEAN IT! I'VE BEEN MORE AROUSED BY YOUR BROTHER! I'M NOT THE FUCKING QUEEN!"
“I know a lot of the staff here,” he says, “I friend of mine, his name is Mike, he’s a psychiatrist here, you’ll be most at ease with him.”
dire."
Jack lifts his head and Sherlock bends to hear him better. “I’m Jack the giant.”
"SHUT UP!" shouts Sherlock. "For the love of God, I've learnt my lesson, now stop!" John grabs him under his armpits and hauls him away.
All eyes turn to the younger Holmes. "Jack defeated the giants... A part of me hoped he would defeat the Monsters too." Sherlock smiles at his son proudly. "My little hero."
Should he strip? Yes. He might feel the cold more. He climbs into the filling tub, shivering and sits down quickly.
I tell him what uncle Mycroft told me. He sighs. “Don’t worry, Lestrade is doing the right thing. Besides, if he doesn’t come back, he’ll have to eat seals with his ex-wife.”
Sherlock is sat in the kitchen burning… something. John walks in beaming and being sure to have a spring in his step.
“No, you have to say ‘my father’, not your father, okay? Try again.”
“What did you call him?” she asks instead.
His already fragile state means he’s been prone to more tears lately. The waterworks start up again. “I failed him. All three of them… I… He never should have even been born…”
“No. We’re locked in a vault because They’re cruel people and They enjoy hurting me. That’s why I’m telling this. We have to prepare ourselves.”
“I’m not a girl!”
Brown eyes peer at him over the top of Sherlock's chair. Jack shakes his head.
John finds out what Mycroft said to Sherlock.
John stops his tea making to consider the question. The prolonged silence makes Sherlock twitchier. “I think,” he says eventually, “I think that the world has changed a lot in thirteen years. There’s a lot you need to catch up on. A lot you must learn. But I see how you remember things so quickly and in so much detail. I don’t doubt you’ll navigate fine given some time. I think that in a couple of months, the media and the public will calm down and move on to some other dramatic story and people won’t even recognise you. You’re going to be fine, Sherlock.”
I have next to no knowlegde about blindness or anything related, so any insight would be welcome. Please rate and review, I would love to hear your thoughts!
The burly woman’s strong arms hold his face against the pillow and he can’t breathe. “For Jack,” he thinks over his mental cries of
"I'm only here for a minute," he says once they've exchanged pleasantries. "I've still got work to do. Just wanted to tell you that I need to interview Sherlock again. Not now," he adds as John tenses, "this afternoon. The lawyers are putting on the pressure and we have new evidence. Evidence that says Sherlock hasn't told the entire story yet."
"Mycroft, what..
John takes a moment to recompose himself. He takes a few deep breaths to calm himself, so as not to scare Jack or Sherlock. Little did he or Mycroft know that the man in question had been standing in the corridor heading towards his bedroom, listening to every word they said.
“Greg?”
Mycroft smiles slightly, a genuinely happy look which somehow doesn’t look out of place on his normally stoic face. “Let’s just say, someone has taught me that emotions aren’t always a hindrance. That sometimes, it can be… good to express an emotion, to avoid unwanted fallouts.” He looks up at him, open and honest. “But you already know that. You raised Jack to be smart, but not emotionally stunted. You are the best of us, brother mine.”
Sherlock’s breath is warm against Jack’s cheek. Then he sits back and holds up Soft Ball between them. "Lift up your top. There’s one more thing we have to do.”
They leave and head up to Lestrade's office. Upon arrival, Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson are sat in front of a computer screen. In the corner, Mycroft's and Sherlock's parents sit quietly. They've been crying.
The man licks his lips. John knows the enemy is trying to delay him and wait for backup. Personally he's surprised they didn't just shoot him when they had their weapons on him. He can't shoot his way out there are too many of them and they'll most likely have backup on the way. He has to get out of here.
“You were invalided home, correct?”
Sherlock and Mycroft talk about what it means to be a Holmes. Short chapter.
It takes John ten minutes to catch his breath, inhaling at a marathon like pace, feeling Sherlock’s heart thump beneath his palm.
Let me know what you think!
Sherlock buries his face in Jack’s neck. “You’re going to have to be really brave.”
Sherlock complies. His heart is pounding. Vomiting might happen after all.
Once John has seen him off with promises of revenge and cursing in more languages than he knew he could speak, along with both middle fingers accompanying the cab's departure, he follows Sherlock up the neat pathway and through the front door of Mycroft's home.
Glancing at Mike, he was surprised to see the other man smiling smugly at him, as if he had known Sherlock would astound him this way. It was obviously an everyday occurrence, since everyone else was calm.
They grab hands and run.
Lestrade takes his cup. "New evidence."
The door opens and John straightens. He's a bit gutted when Prince Charles steps out. Not the best diplomacy the Queen could send, but it would do. The Prince straigntens, eyeing John carefully. "Doctor Watson, do you know where you are?"
“Of course. But I want to know everything about you when you’re in the throes of passion.” Says Sherlock in all seriousness. “I’m going to catalogue all your reactions. Think of it as an experiment.”
Let me know you think! Tell me if it's okay!
"How can you say that?" he jumps, not realizing he'd said it all outloud. John stares at him, shaking his head, face red and blotchy. " How can you say that? You didn't kill him, you're not the monster... what they did... if I could get my hands on them, I would..."
“You've seen a lot of injuries then. Violent deaths.” He stalked towards John as he spoke, as one would stalk their prey.
The strange empty look slides back into place and John frowns. He hasn’t known Mycroft long, but he knows a broken heart when he sees one. “Mycroft, what is it? You said Sherlock was doing fine.”
Then he grins; he wouldn’t have it any other way.
They enter the kitchen and John gets cups out of the cupboard. Sherlock watches John. Even though it's only been two weeks since they moved in, John has become used to the life. In spite of his claims of not fitting into the norms of society, Sherlock felt that John did just as well as Mrs. Hudson. That should be him functioning properly for his son, not a stranger.
Cheekbones. Violin. Running. Kissing. Dark curls. Cheekbones.
The man swallows, frightened. A surge of adrenaline courses through John at the sight. He's never been in control before. He's never been so close to winning this scenario...
More fingers prod him gently. “I don’t think anything’s broken, but he’s going to need medical attention.”
"Sherlock?" Lestrade catches his attention. "Was Jack the second or the third pregnancy?"
Everything’s good when she puts washes my hair and puts me on a chair in front of the mirror. Then she brings the scissors over and I feel sick. “Is it going to hurt?”
Sherlock swallows and doesn’t answer.
John sighs, a puff of breath against his neck. "Never.
Mycroft ajusts his grip on his umbrella and takes a fighting stance. "On guard, pirate scum! Perhaps you would like me to go easy on you?"
Sherlock licks his lips. John hadn’t put two and two together, but Mycroft knew Sherlock would eventually, even if he tried to stop him from reading the news. “I saw the news report on TV, the prison They were in caught fire. And then you speak to Mummy?” It’s also a rhetorical question. He just wants confirmation.
Boring. It hurts too much.
The man's outstretched hands start to shake. "You're a doctor, John."
“We can’t change the past,” he says, his voice older and wearier than Sherlock has ever heard it. “Your mother and I are relieved you are safe. After everything that has happened, we must put the past behind us and move forward. We will overcome this as a family. First we must wait for our lawyer to arrive and then we can discuss what must be done with the child.”
“Jack is well, Sherlock. He is well and waiting for you to get better and to come home. And together we will learn to open up to the people who love us so we don’t hurt them. We will be better people together.”
A week passes and things finally settle into place. Mycroft has miraculously removed the crowds off the street but Sherlock knows that the moment he steps outside, some random person will snap a picture and all he wants is to be able to breathe some fresh air, however fresh the London air can be. So when Mycroft finally suggests a day out in the countryside, this is the best idea imaginable, especially for the adults because both John and Sherlock, although having grown closer, feel trapped within the walls.
“What happened next?”
Pa’s satisfied expression drops. “We don’t have any, Jack, you know that,” he swallows. “Please Jack, we have to be grateful for what we’ve got. We can’t have everything they have on TV. You’re a big boy now, you’re old enough to understand,” he licks his lips nervously. “Now, this cake is a special treat because it’s got sugar and other ingredients in it that I’m not too keen about shoving down your intestines, not to mention damaging your teeth. This is a very special treat, Jack. I haven’t had cake since before you were born. What do we always say?”
Sherlock huffs impatiently. “Don’t be stupid, John. I’m going to
“Where were you before?”
John's face softens. John's face is the softest, kindest thing he has seen in years. He can't stop watching in case he misses something.
Sherlock spits in her face. “He was never your son. He’s mine, he’s always been mine,” he cries harder.
Old Magnussen steps forward and shoves him roughly aside. Sherlock watches with wide eyes as They unroll Rug. “Please,” he whispers, “please don’t make me look at the body. I don’t want to remember him like that, you’re not allowed to touch him…”
John nods, only half listening. “Sherlock, we're going to get you out of this hospital as soon as we can. We'll go and live with Mrs. Hudson. No one will harm you or Jack there. But that doesn’t explain why you’re refusing to eat.”
Before the funeral, Mycroft leaves his briefcase by the kitchen table. Sherlock knows his brother is hiding things from him. Inside he finds folders about William and Charlotte. He knows how his daughter died, so he looks at William’s. And nearly faints.
John is in love with Sherlock.
The next day, there's a proper funeral. Sherlock has been fitted with a suit, as has John. Jack is there, but stays back with Mrs. Hudson to give Sherlock some space.
John and Sherlock stay on the floor for another three hours until John's leg spasms and Sherlock can't feel his backside. They get up and sit on the couch. Still nothing is said.
"Sh-Sherlock?" It's a question he deperately needs to be a statement.
Sherlock doesn’t reply. John knows he doesn’t quite believe him. But he’s listening, and it’s a good start.
“I wouldn’t try moving if I were you. Charles has gone to get the… ARGH!”
“Of course he’s my son,” laughs Sherlock nervously. “Of course he is, I would know. I was there.”
“Is this a birthday cake?”
“To my flat. The owner, Mrs. Hudson will love you, don't worry.”
"Not really, it's all in my head. When you hit it my brain told me I was being shot, but then I remembered my breathing techniques so I feel better."
Sherlock feels like the rug has been pulled out from under his feet. Had he misunderstood Mycroft’s use of the expression “personal feelings”. Because he liked John. A lot. But if John didn’t really like him…
Sniffing, Sherlock fights to keep his eyes open. “I don’t want to die anymore. But I don’t know how to live… it’s so hard.”
She stares at the wriggling baby blankly. With each birth there seems to be less emotion. Sherlock reaches for a towel and slowly wraps the child up. He tells her it’s a boy. She stares at the baby’s face for just a moment longer until her eyes seem to just slide away to look down at the floor instead. Sherlock does not move. He’s still in a lot of pain from a beating two days before, and should She decide to vent her frustration, he much rather the baby gets its head bashed in then him.
While Sherlock knows that his son’s attention span is impressive for his age, he also knows that he can’t push his luck too far. After two hours of simple equations, learning to spell letters and reading, Sherlock calls it a day. They put everything away in the box and push it under Bed, mindful not to squash Eggsnake. Then an idea crosses Sherlock’s mind and he pulls the box back out and scribbles ‘Jack’s school box’ on the side. Jack stares at the way his name is spelt and files it away in his Mind Palace. He takes a piece of paper out and puts it in Wardrobe for later.
“Are you real?”
"Uncle Mycwoft!" shouts Jack and Sherlock smiles at his son's slight lisp due to excitement. "I'm a pirate!"
“I think he loves you, Sherlock. I think he wants to protect you from the world because he failed before. But he works in a controlling environment where everything has to be just as he wants it. And he was raised by your so called ‘parents’. A recipe for disaster if you ask me. Not to mention he’s been acting strange these past two days.”
“I don’t like this story.”
Sherlock catches John’s eye. They share an amused smile.
John’s throat tightens. Damn Sherlock’s parents. “She’s loved you from the moment she heard about you. Mycroft, have you seen Jack? Mycroft! Look at your nephew.”
John's hand spasms and he grits his teeth. Sherlock's accelerated breathing frightens him more. "Is Jack okay?" he gasps, looking at the small boy he had been tickling just moments ago. Jack stares at him from behind Sherlock's armchair. "It's alright, Jack, it was an accident. It's okay, little pirate, you've got a good aim, that's all." He turns to Sherlock. "Your son will be excellent at fencing. When he's ready to meet new people you should definitely get him some more lessons. Bloody brilliant your son is."
Sherlock forgets his dinner, John’s warm hands, including his silent promises and practically runs out the door.
The world crashes to a halt.
“Tell me more about your World, Pa.”
Jack nods and Sherlock can feel his T-shirt getting wet. He stares blankly at the wall long after Jack has drifted off into a fitful sleep, fearing the consequences of what he’s about to do.
Sherlock is immediately suspicious. “I don't want to talk to the police or the lawyer, I'm not in the mood and I don't want to think about that right now.”
“You were incredibly difficult to find. Jack knew what to tell us. Your plan worked perfectly. I’m just sorry we didn’t get here earlier.”
I’m really hungry now, so I kick my legs to make him move the laptop and let me go. I run to the kitchen and get a bowl, my cereals, milk and spoon. I use Mrs. Hudson’s stool to climb onto my chair with the pillow to help me see the table. It’s only when I finish that I realise Uncle Mycroft didn’t say anything about my suggestions. I’m not surprised though. I don’t really understand his job. Pa says he just presses buttons and drinks tea. But I think it’s a bit harder than that.
Mycroft and his parents walk to the edge and look down. The severity of the situation seems to have sunk in. Magnussen spits his gag out. "You can't do this! My lawyer will..."
In the afternoon I come down for lunch. Uncle Mycroft is no longer broken, but he hasn’t moved. Maybe I should say sorry. Or not. I’m still mad about what he did to Pa. He deserves to be broken, just for a little while.
“But you said…”
I run to her door so I can go and show John. Then I remember my book, Mrs. Hudson at the picnic, buying me a present, taking care of me and loving Pa like her own family. I remember what she said about family. I think about what she means to me. I know what I have to do.
.” Whispers Jack.
Sherlock swallows. “I don’t know.”
Jack grins, delighted. “If you don’t mind then it doesn’t matter!”
And that’s when John finally gets it. He loves Sherlock. And maybe, just maybe, Sherlock feels something for him too. They’ve touched each other a lot since they’ve first met, simply because John had become, as Sherlock said, his eyes. But all these touches, which most people would consider to be sensual, had finally affected them.
Sherlock sniffs. “My brother.
Sherlock smiles patiently. “Yes, but my name is Sherlock, just like your name is Jack. That’s what my parents named me when I was born. My parents are your grandparents.”
The Witch sits up slowly, her eyes never leaving Jack’s face. Their brown eyes lock. She grins, “Hello, son.”
"Cause of death?" Mycroft cannot be bothered with pleasantries.
“We’ve prepared a private room for you both,” he says, “Let’s get you out of the public eye.”
WARNINGS!!!!!!! Please note this chapter contains child abuse which may be upsetting.
Sherlock shakes away memories, stuffs them into the deepest cellar and bolts the door. The delete setting won't work against memories which make up nearly half his life. He's give anything to be sixteen and ignorant again.
Twenty minutes later they climb into his limousine. As the door shuts, he says, "You congratulated Sherlock for not giving Jack the family name. You should know that there were to other children, William and Charlotte. They're in the morgue."
John sighs. "We should probably move away in case, you know... They start to make... noises."
“NO! I didn’t say that! I just told you…”
"Did you know that pirates are the number one enemy of the british government?"
He hands the driver the thirty quid he told them it will cost and hopes he might get some change back. The man counts it quickly. "That'll be an extra twenty please."
We make sandwiches and soup. John helps me cut them up. He shouts at uncle Mycroft to ask him if he wants some too, but he doesn’t answer. John’s face twitches. He’s going to get mad soon. I don’t like people getting angry because I get scared and it’s a little bit my fault uncle Mycroft is being silly, so I go and talk to him.
And freezes.
“But, sir…”
John is in love with Sherlock and wants to show him just how much, but can’t because the man in question is blind. Therefore, John is, in his own opinion, pretty much screwed. When attracted to someone, John usually smiles, makes doe eyes and dresses to impress. But Sherlock can’t see any of this without having to physically read him like braille. Because the smartest man in London literally cannot see what is right in front of him. John is considering belting out songs of admiration for Sherlock’s cheekbones and writing poems about his eyes, but that will most likely result in a complete loss of masculinity, let alone dignity. So that’s a no-no. Captain John Watson will simply have to come up with a better plan.
“Both. You have to say that your father and you have been locked in a vault at Appledore. Go on, say it.”
Informing his lodger that he was skipping tea, he departed without a second thought for John. The latter sat back and convinced the landlady for some tea and biscuits, enjoying their playful banter.
John’s blood boils, his free hand curling into a fist. He turns and glares at Mycroft who’s watching him, still reassuring Jack. “What did Mycroft say about it being your fault they died?”
“You’re sure it’s not a certain boy eating all the food?”
"Did your Pa teach you those swash buckling moves?" he laughs, trying to catch his breath.
John gasps. Myroft is a living statue. All the oxygen has left the room.
Sherlock’s ears are ringing. It’s possible he’s going into shock. “But I’m your son,” he rasps pleadingly. “How could you do that? There wasn’t a single day that passed that I didn’t think of you. And you told everyone I was an addict?”
"My sister works for the Daily Mail."
… His heart squeezes. He truly has the most wonderful son in the world.
Afterwards, Sherlock hugs Jack and Mycroft tells him to move on. Sherlock wants to tell him to fuck himself. Instead, he tells him he can make his own decisions. But then his brother insists. “I know you can’t make your own decisions. If you could, you never would have been kidnapped and two children never would have died
Sherlock practically spits in his face, snarling at his patronizing tone. “He says he’s not small, he’s Jack the giant.”
“Why don’t you get him out? I’m sure he’d like to meet us. I’m eager to see how he’s grown. And I do believe it’s time for him to… earn his keep.” His smile is sickening.
"Did you make this?" he asks, voice full of awe and admiration. Jack nods, his hair falling around his face.
Sherlock swallows. “Maybe. Soon.”
“Where’s your son…”
Realizing he'd been staring for far too long, he releases John's finger, heart racing and a blush developing on his cheeks. John doesn't notice and suggests tea. Sherlock stands on wobbly legs, his heart pounding, feeling like he's had one of the greatest epiphanies of his life and he had yet to understand it.
“Open your eyes, Jack”
The baby gasps and starts to cry. Sherlock dashes forward and snatches the ball away from him. If this child thought he could replace…
“So he’s never coming back?”
Sherlock swallows. “I don’t- I don’t have any lube or condoms.” He stammers and they both blush fiercely. It’s a sight to behold, watching Sherlock’s usually pale face turn red. John never thought he’d see the day. He grins like a maniac until trepidation grips him again. But never let be said that Captain John Watson never has a plan.
Sherlock shoves the detective away and
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Doctor Watson, you will be rewarded for helping my brother. And you will stay or I will do everything in my power to ruin your life. Are you understanding me?”
Sherlock, John and Lestrade stare in bemusment as a small five year old, armed with tin foil attacks a middle aged man armed with an umbrella. Sherlock reaches for his phone and manages to snap a photo. He can tell Mycroft is going easy on Jack due to his superior weapon. Well. That won't do.
She takes a sip of her own water and bursts into hysterical tears.
Jack hands him his ponytail, nodding “I asked Grandma and she did it. She’s cut hair before.”
I tiptoe past the Somebody and make my way downstairs. I still have to go down slowly one at a time, but I don’t have to bounce down on my bottom anymore. I’m hungry, so I decide to go and have some breakfast.
Sherlock nods and returns the smile. A man steps up to them and greats John with a nod of his head and reaches out to shake Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock stares and can’t quite remember what he’s supposed to do. He glances at John who gives him an encouraging nod and Sherlock shifts Jack’s weight onto his left arm to shake his hand. The doctor introduces himself as Mike Stamford and takes Sherlock’s appearance in with no pity in his eyes, only professionalism.
Sherlock curls his fingers loosely around the man’s hand.
"Ah." Gulping down the last of his beverage, he drops his cup back in the sink. "Are we good then?"
How the hell are they supposed to do this? Sherlock can’t
Mycroft sneers. “I lost my little brother once. I refuse to let that happen again. By
"We found a grave."
“Did my advice hurt you?”
“Is bad tooth hurting?”
Uncle Mycroft opens and shuts his mouth lots of times. I think I broke him. I wait quietly until he knows what he wants to say.
The man smiles at Jack and reaches out to shake Sherlock’s hand. “John Watson. Glad to see you’re safe. You must be Sherlock.”
Jack stands before his uncle, sword in hand, and pirate hat down to his nose. Mycroft stares, shock etched upon his face, eyes fixed on the small boy and his younger brother's hat. Sherlock wonders if he might break.
Sherlock stares lovingly at his son, before shoveling more food into his mouth. They finish their meal in silence.
His hands are shaking. Vision blurring, he croaks. "What do you want to know?"
"Shut it," hisses the man in question his eyes showing deadly intent. "Or I will end your pathetic existence."
Spluttering indignantly, John watches as Sherlock heads down a corridor. Running after him, he sees Sherlock is about to catch himself on a grandfather clock. "Careful!" he calls and rescues Sherlock from a bruised hip.
Plucking the phone from John's immobile hand, he felt the writing engraved on the cover. Not having finished impressing the newcomer, he didn't notice how quiet the room had become.
“Yes please. I want Pa to know I’m okay, so he can get better.”
"He's probably protecting Jack."
"SHERLOCK IT’S ME, IT’S JOHN, PLEASE I'LL DO ANYTHING PLE-"
He cleared his throat for a second time in an attempt to regain some leverage on this battlefield of wits with this smart man. Sherlock's stare unnerved him. He never looked at anyone directly, he merely...
John knows that he mustn't give the wrong message when interacting with Sherlock. Too emotionally scarred to have any sort of relationship, John knows that he is treading on delicate territory and must be constantly aware of how he acts around both Sherlock and Jack. Not to grab Sherlock from behind, no shouting in front of Jack, no accidental loss of temper. John is just glad to be a part of their family unit. Life was so much brighter than it had been a couple of months ago. It meant the world to be Jack's somebody.
“What’s a seal? Is it like chicken?”
“I know. You’re such a good boy and you’ve never had a proper one before.” He runs his hand over his face before burying his nose in Jack’s hair. “But this might be the only present you get. Do you understand that, Jack? This cannot be a regular thing. They won’t do it for us very often. Okay?”
“There's a suicide note. I'd appreciate it if you could come down to take a look. Er, I meant...”
Sherlock turns to stare at him. His brother is sat on his bed, hunched over and looking as though he were trying to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders. In many ways he was. But in all his life, Mycroft had never shown himself, his feelings,
of this does not mean that I need you to coddle me or treat me like I’m…” he stops, the word ‘disabled’ hanging in the air between them. John feels the need to reassure them both.
"No, John, no! Think what this will do to Sherlock!"
“But it’s not real, Pa.”
Be aware, if John's panic attack caused by PTSD is a bit odd, its because he's been drugged by whoever they arrested.
Greg looks him right in the eyes and
Sherlock flips open the case and Jack clambers over him to peer inside. Inside is the violin, exactly as he remembered it thirteen years ago. He bats his son's fingers away and closes the case, fingers trembling slightly. “what else have you brought?”
John struggles with Sherlock’s buttons and the man beneath him just keeps giggling until he swats him to be quiet. Eventually he manages to undo his shirt and he straddles Sherlock’s hips and pulls him into a sitting position so he can tug it off. Sherlock is now topless and oh
John turns and flees.
Sherlock carries his sleeping child over to Wardrobe and tucks him in the blankets. He closes the doors and tidies up, making sure Room is spotless, or as much as it can be. Then he sits on the edge of Bed and breathes in regularly, maintaining his calm. Tonight won’t be pleasant. If he has deduced Them correctly, then he has done the right thing. He can only hope he hasn’t harmed Jack by drugging him. The tablets aren’t meant for children.
There's a rumble from behind him and John, cursing, spins to face the new threat.
"But when I jump and find the Somebody, where will Old Magnussen and the Witch go?”
Sherlock goes quiet for a moment. “Is Jack okay?”
Jack looks confused. “You have more than one?”
"I hate you."
Jack stares at it uncomprehendingly and whispers in his Pa's ear. Sherlock chuckles. “That's because it's wrapped up. You have to take the red paper off. We'll do it together.”
“Your room or mine?” he asks. It’s important Sherlock knows he’s in control.
“Because They don’t like my curls-“ Sherlock bites his tongue mid-sentence. “Because that’s the rule. Otherwise, Chain gets tighter. They also shave my face so that I don’t grow a beard. But They never see you, so They don’t know what you look like.”
Sherlock lent in closer, lowering his voice as though sharing forbidden knowledge. John was internally shivering in excitement.
John sighs, not looking much better than Sherlock. “I’m afraid that interview about William and Charlotte was the last thing he needed. He had been improving. Now he throws up if I even try to put food near his mouth.”
This chapter is entirely Jack's POV again, but I know that reading an entire page in italics can be exhausting. So I'm making an exception, just to make it an easier read. ;)
“I think so. He should be.”
But then she stands, blood still running down her legs and she limps towards the door. Old Magnussen sighs from his spot on the bed and walks after Her, yelling that She was in trouble if She gets blood on the carpet and “
“There's been another murder.” The glee in his voice sent an unnoticeable shiver down John's spine. “But this one's different or you wouldn't have come. What's happened?”
He reassures Jack that his dead siblings would never be jealous of him, nor that they would be angry at his chance of living. Telling Jack he wants it all to end, he hopes that somehow his small perceptive child might realise something is wrong. No such luck.
A hand grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head back. She spits in his ear. “By the time I’m done with you, you’ll-“
Sherlock covers his ears; he doesn’t want to hear it.
"It'll take thirteen years to watch all of it." murmurs Lestrade.
“Nothing,” he replies slowly. “I haven’t… I thought you would want to…”
Let me know what you think! I love Kudos! (Who doesn't?)
“It matches your eyes,” grins John and fidgets when everyone stares at him. “I mean, uh, it looks good on you. Suits you. Eyes and cheekbones and all that.” he swallows. “I'll shut up now.”
Mycroft's expression snaps from despair to fury within a second. Sherlock shuffles backwards on his behind because
Jack beams. “Yay! Now the somebody has to stay.”
“Uncle Mycroft said I couldn’t help him, because I look like a girl and people would be confused.”
Lestrade sets a file on the table, along with a camera and microphone. Just like last time. Sherlock swallows.
Sirens. Shouting. Beeping. Then the darkness swallows him.
“NO!” roars Sherlock, “I’ve been stuck here for thirteen years, you are not carrying me out, I’m walking out!”
That’s when the light bulb flicks on.
“Don’t you see? We won’t have to trick Them because you really are ill, you can go to hospital to get better and once you’re there, you can shout “help, police!” and then we’ll be safe. They’ll be back this evening, tonight’s our best and only chance.”
“Answer me!”
John chokes. “My what?”
John wants to cry. None of this is fair. And to think that without their pain, he'd still be on Harry's couch, trying not to upset her and thinking that he was the unluckiest man alive. "Stamford's on his way, right?"
He cleans up the mess the best he can. When the baby cries, he turns on the TV to full volume and shoves the boy in the wardrobe.
Arriving at the crime scene, John and Sherlock slip into their usual routine. As a police officer lifts the tape, John gently pulls Sherlock’s head low enough so he can duck under it. He then waits until Sherlock has taken off his left glove before they approach the body. Standing at his left, he takes Sherlock’s hand and shows him what he can see.
Mycroft nods. "Thank you, Miss Hooper. You have been most helpful."
“All your things. I've brought them from the house. Everything was kept when you were kidnapped. I had to convince Mummy not to sell your violin.”
“I lived in a house with my parents and older brother.”
"Will you be okay?"
What Jack doesn't know won't hurt him.
A warm Not Their hand touches his face. He's starting to allow John to touch him. Mycroft has kept his distance and Sherlock is relieved. His older brother's soft tone, easily sharpened by anger reminds him too strongly of Old Magnussen. The three piece suits aren't the greatest of reminders either. Luckily Mycroft isn't around too much and when he is... well, they never hugged much as kids anyway.
“That was my way of thanking you. And don't think it will happen again.”
His mother shakes her head. “Sherlock, you have no obligation to the boy. We’re not even sure he is your son.”
“The day before the double funeral.”
He's a terrible actor, but Jack is five and probably won't mind. "I know! I saw something yummy in the kitchen! I hope I get there before somebody else eats it!" Gluing his gaze to his feet, he heads back up the steps.
Mycroft shakes his head. “Leopard seals.”
“Hold him down,” snaps Old Magnussen, “He’s no good to me like this.”
“Because… that’s his name, his first name… never mind. Anyway, they’re dating. Jack figured it out. Or at least they were. But Greg’s staying away for a bit. He could only see you all as work, and he needed a break so that it wouldn’t upset their relationship.”
Sherlock knows it’s a rhetorical question. He’s curious however, as to what his brother did to Mrs. Lestrade. “Ringed seals.” He states confidently.
“Like on TV?”
Sherlock frowns. "Stupid?
“A stunned silence fills the air between them. Sherlock blinks in an attempt to clear the panic from his head. “What?”
“Do you remember what I told you about Chain?” he asks.
Let me know what you think!
Mycroft surprises everyone, including Lestrade who'd just removed his coat, by straightening and glaring at Jack down his nose. "Doctor Watson," he pratically sniffed, "Would you care to explain why you are housing enemies of the state?"
“Oi! I liked that shirt. Harry got it for me.”
“I don’t know where your brother’s gone.”
Sherlock and John follow him back into the living room. They freeze at the sight that greets them.
Mycroft receives a text after an hour and a half. Or at least, Anthea does. He didn't want to leave his brother, but he couldn't refuse a chat with the Queen. She was technically his boss. Anthea purses her lips and looks at him.
“Why?”
P.S: I blame Rupert Graves gorgeous face for this terribly horny chapter. God help me.
Bit of angst here. Enjoy!
Sherlock is drowning in waves of humiliation. “I’m sorry, John.”
“Well dear, I certainly don’t think you should cut your hair because of other people’s judgment. You have to want it for yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock?”
“Perhaps if you’d fought back harder…”
Sherlock breathes deeply, still trying to calm himself. “I just want to leave this place. I just want to go.”
Someone guides him to a seat and pushes a bottle of water into his hand. He sips it. When he opens his eyes, his parents are sat opposite him.
He looks up. “What is it?”
Sherlock runs and falls, his legs giving out, his injuries demanding care and attention, but all he can see is Jack, Jack’s alive,
"No. Charlotte died because she was a girl.
I’ve never cut my hair. Because it was perfect for Room. I didn’t know I could cut it. Only TV people had short hair. But now TV people are real and I’m not in Room anymore. Room and World are two different places. Even though I miss Room and Rug and Wardrobe, I’m in the World now. I would like to go back, but Pa needs me here. Pa has always been okay if I’m okay. Maybe his sickness is staying for a long time because he is worried about me and can’t see me, just like I am scared for him.
They stand from their crouched position, John wincing as the movement hurt his leg, Sherlock noticing immediately. He reaches out again until he finds John’s arm and squeezes his hand in reassurance. John’s heart swells at the gesture and he almost forgets that he’s angry at Greg for ruining their evening.
Sherlock sat up. “Hungry? I know a great restaurant. You'll have to watch out for any suspicious activities. You need to be my eyes, so we can catch this killer.”
Mrs. Hudson rushed in at that moment, demanding to know what Sherlock had done this time round to upset Scotland Yard once more. She was gently shoved aside by a detective, who resembled John with his keen eyes and graying hair. He took no notice of the smaller man as he requested Sherlock's attention. Not that the man hadn't been quivering in delight for the past minute.
I look back at my book. “What are dads supposed to do? How do you know if you have one? A good one?
As he waits for their nightly visit, he mulls aver what Jack said that evening. Like him, Jack has no problem with death, but he doesn’t know how small Room truly is. If he grows to be as tall as Sherlock, then they’ll struggle. And Jack will only want to know more as he gets bigger. But one day They’ll consider him old enough to be a threat and the rules that apply to Sherlock will apply to Jack too. How long before they’re both chained up?
I frown. “I’m telling the Somebody that there’s something big to worry about.” I turn to go back upstairs.
“You’ll be okay.” He says quietly. “I imagine it’s a bit terrifying right now, but soon you’ll be back with your family and you’ll have your whole life ahead of you.”
Seeing that Jack is speaking to Mycroft, he hits dial. A nurse picks up at the other end and he asks for Sherlock. Beads of sweat form on his brow. He doesn’t usually bend under pressure, but if this conversation goes wrong, Sherlock will never want to see him again.
John is in bed, Sherlock’s sleeping with his head on his chest, he runs his hands down Sherlock’s back and tangles his fingers in his curls until the man slowly stirs and then John flips them over, already giggling and preparing to ravish him, except Sherlock’s fighting him because he’s lost all his other senses and he doesn’t know who’s on top of him and he’s screaming so loudly and…
Thank you for all your wonderful comments and support, it means the world to me. I hope you all like this chapter. Clock's ticking!
They approach Bed where father and son stare up at Them fearfully. Old Magnussen puts his hand on Jack’s forehead. Sherlock glares at Him, warning Him to keep his distance. Jack squeezes his eyes shut.
Sherlock can now see every flicker of John’s eyelids, the way his lips part as he pants loudly, the only sounds in the room are John’s breathing and the sucking sounds Sherlock is making as he brings him closer and closer to the edge. The smell of sex is heavy and strong in the air.
That night, the door opens and They come in. Jack sits up in Wardrobe and peeks through crack-in-the-door. He can see Old Magnussen’s face and the Wicked Witch’s back. He tries to understand what they are saying.
“THIS IS THE ONLY STORY YOU’RE GOING TO GET!” yells Sherlock, “NOW GROW UP AND LISTEN TO ME!”
Mike smiles and crouches down to look at Jack, but Jack is hiding, face buried in his father’s gown. “What was that, Jack?”
“YOU’RE NOT GETTING A PRESENT, JACK, AND THAT’S FINAL!” barks Sherlock, slamming his hand on Table and they both freeze as what he has just said sets in. Jack’s bottom lip quivers and he bursts into tears.
But the good feeling is still clouded by anger. “You punched John and scared Jack.” It may have been a week ago, but they haven’t spoken until now.
John peers around the wall to look at uncle Mycroft. He’s not very good at spying. He creeps back over to the sink and pours himself a glass of water. “What did you say to him?”
Sherlock gapes like a fish. “Mrs. Hudson?' he repeats, a little lost.
He's not always sure how to be around Sherlock. Jack is still relatively shy, but Sherlock has forgotten all social skills around other decent human beings. He and Jack rely on each other so much it is almost as if they have become an extension of one another. If Jack is ever to attend school and meet new people, he will have to learn to live without his Pa in the same room as him for more than five minutes. The idea of even having a closed door between them is too painful.
As they turn a corner, Sherlock's head lolls sideways and onto John's shoulder. His heart stutters in his chest and he reaches out to touch a yellow bruise on his face. His pale and tired face speak volumes about the nightmares he won't discuss with John. He knows they exist because he asked Jack, in exchange for a jar of marmalade. Apparently Sherlock has always has nightmares, but he's learnt not to make any noise to avoid frightening Jack, as Sherlock confessed to him when he cornered him two days ago. John still thinks he's the bravest man he's ever met. Every time he thinks back to what his brain has labelled The Big Rescue, his heart twinges as he recalls Sherlock, severely injured, running and screaming his son's name. He wishes Sherlock's father could love his son as much as Sherlock loves Jack. John wishes he could be truly part of their little family unit.
Suddenly there’s a bang and although it sounds completely wrong, he flinches, thinking he’s just been shot. He’s already in too much pain to care. He just wants it to end.
Then the movement speeds up and he and his companion hit the ground hard and roll once. Strong arms wrap around him and he struggles. The person rolls onto their back and the arms release him, allowing them both to catch their breath. Tears run down his face and drip into the shirt of the person beneath him. A voice reaches his ears.
“Do you mind?” Sherlock's voice snapped him out of his thoughts. Muttering an apology, he held out his phone, when Sherlock suddenly placed large, elegant hands on either side of his face. He flinched once more at the contact.
The Witch helps her partner carry Jack and Rug away. When They reach the door, Sherlock scrambles to his feet, tears still flowing down his face.
“I told you you couldn’t lock him up, couldn’t control him, so you went and said that?” His voice sounds manic and slightly deranged, alien even to his own ears. “He didn’t want you to control his life, so you decided to break him! Did your precious Mummy tell you to do that? Hm? Made her proud have you? You piece of-“
John shook his head, took one look at Mike's smug face and made his decision. Cursing his fascination under his breath, he darted after Sherlock.
"Deducting." correct Jack giggling. "He smells like Lestrade."
“Why is he calling himself Greg?”
A sigh. “Believe it, John.”
"Done, sir."
“No you don’t! You work all the time and you never look like that.”
Every time, John is interrupted. Until he isn't. Sherlock certainly seems to appreciate it.
Perhaps a 3D image of him has already been filed away on a shelf in Sherlock’s memory palace.
With him nearly matching Mycroft in height and Jack on his shoulders, Mycroft will now have to fend off two attacks from two seperate heights simultaneously. His brother makes a show of gulping exageratedly.
“It’s all your fault,” mutters Sherlock, raising his red rimmed eyes. “IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT!” he screams. “You wouldn’t take him to a hospital and now he’s dead!”
“Good boy. And tell them to find your uncle Mycroft Holmes. He’ll protect you and take you to your grandparents. They’ll all take care of you.”
A fifteen minute cab ride and an explanation that Harry was short for Harriet later, John found himself in a stuffy, messy apartment, without a visible seating area in sight. Glaring at the naive Sherlock, he cleared a space on the plushy looking armchair and sat himself down, stretching his sore leg and confirming that yes, the armchair was “plushy”.
Years in the army had taught him to be wary and to know when he was being watched. It was this gut instinct that made him turn his head towards the doorway, to find Sherlock facing him, his eyes set on John's waist.
“Maybe.”
“Come on then, time to get up.”
“A bit like vitamins, yes. But whereas yours keep you full of energy and healthy, mine make me tired and unable to fight back, or at least, not as much. Do you understand?”
John clears his throat self-consciously. “Well, I’m just glad to have been able to help. It’s nice to know I’m not completely useless.”
I hope you are still interested in the story and that you haven't forgotten what happened up until now!
It takes all of his energy to lift his head so he can reach out and grab Sherlock’s erection, which is now hard and leaking pre-cum. Sherlock stutters his name and crawls back up John’s body, leaving him on the brink of what will be a mind-blowing orgasm. But John almost doesn’t care, because Sherlock is smiling.
“What about for real? Will we live in the house together?”
There’s a long pause. Then Lestrade nods. “Alright, but I’m helping you. Let’s get you up.”
“But you said you’d teach me stuff and we need books for that. Please, Pa, you promised.” Implores Jack, undeterred.
Mycroft has been visiting on a daily basis, having taken some leave for the first time in his career. John was a little alarmed by the elder brother when they first met, but mostly pissed by his arrogance. He has taken to bickering with Sherlock, which seems to have been their norm before the kidnapping, and Sherlock seems less like an empty shell when with Mycroft. John is relieved. As worried as he is about Jack, he knows that at the age of five, the little boy will be able to adapt and one day will struggle to remember those stressful times of his childhood. It's a long way away, but Mike is sure it will come.
Jack wiggles around until he's comfy. Mycroft glares until everyone gets the message and leaves. John and Sherlock head to the kitchen.
Let me know what you think!
"Anderson figured it out." Lestrade's voice is quiet, too quiet. "That strip light that kept blinking; it was sharing power with a small camera, hidden next to it. We were in Magnussen's bedroom, and Philip switched on the TV. Camera had a direct feed into it. It also recorded everything."
The phone drops to the floor with a clatter. Mycroft is hauled out of the armchair – Sherlock’s armchair – thrown on to couch where John’s hands wrap firmly around his neck. Colour creeps back onto his face as John throttles him.
John takes a seat on the couch next to him and stares across the room, his jaw moving as he goes through all those emotions his smaller body contains. "I wish you would talk about this. I know I can't possibly understand, but if you don't..."
Sherlock watches his brother who has arrived accompanied by a few people and Anthea carrying boxes. He remains seated. “What's all this?”
Unable to resist, he opens the envelope, and pulls it out, certain he already knows what it will say.
Guilt invades him instantly, but Lestrade seems unfazed. "He told me he liked me.
I’m in the grass having our picnic. Pa is there. We are laughing and smiling with John and Mrs. Hudson. Grass is green. Sky is blue. John is bright and warm. Then we all play in Room. Everyone’s happy. Then the door starts to beep.
“I’m doing this for Jack. I’m keeping my promise.” He enters his Mind Palace.
The three people opposite him squirm uncomfortably. Sigar Holmes clears his throat. “Yes, well, who named him Jack?”
"The girl, Charlotte, died from suffocation, like your brother stated. The footage Anderson found today proves it. The boy, William, has a crushed pelvis, like something or someone heavy was on top of him."
"Does Mycroft know?"
“Why aren’t They allowed?”
Sometimes in life, a man’s got to do what a man’s got to do. And in this case, a man’s got to grow a pair and speak up before he dies prematurely of spontaneous combustion.
He’d wanted to make Sherlock feel. Maybe he’d felt it all along. Without thinking, he spins back around to face Sherlock, grabs his head and pulls him down for a kiss. Sherlock makes a startled sound, but John doesn’t even feel remotely apologetic. He just sucks happily at Sherlock’s bottom lip, taking full advantage of his height and tries to make himself taller by standing on tip toe, so as not to hurt Sherlock’s back. He’s vaguely aware of Anderson making gagging sounds, of half a dozen officers muttering “It’s about time”, and of Lestrade roaring with laughter, which quickly turns to a noise of protest as John drags Sherlock away from the crime scene, back under the tape and out of the alley to find a taxi. They pay no heed to Lestrade’s calls. They’ll solve the case tomorrow.
“FACE THE GOD DAMNED WALL!”
Sherlock stares out the window, his left hand resting against the pane. His right hand clutches Jack’s ponytail.
The scene before him is familiar. The enemy are around him, two of his comrades are on the ground with their hands on their heads. Captured. Fuck.
John's heart swells, he feels like he's been included into something wonderful. "My stomach can wait." he declares and twirls his sword. Jack beams.
Stretching out a trembling limb, he reaches for his brother slowly, unsure of the reaction he will get. Mycroft strides across the distance between them and grips his shoulders, himself uncertain as to how to act, now that the moment he has dreamt of for so long has finally arrived. Sherlock tries to conceal his emotions, but he was never any good at hiding from his brother. Shaking like a leaf, tears welling up, he hopes he won’t cry in front of this man so full of himself and authority.
too close for you.”
"Do you know," says John, and he can feel the tears escape again, "do you know what it's like to wake up everynight with the knowledge you've screamed yourself hoarse in your sleep and that no one truly gives a crap beacause no one understands well enough to care. To be scared of war but you go into it everyday because if you walk away you may aswell eat a bullet." He cocks his gun and points it at his temple.
“Pa! S’not funny!” They laugh.
Jack is soon set up with headphones and the adults take a seat in the center of the room. Sherlock sits with his back to his son, but he knows everyone will get up if there's the slightest sign of trouble. He presses the palms together and hopes this won't take too long. No one has said anything about what they might discuss. He knows John heard him scream in the field, but hopefully he'll have kept that to himself. There's nothing to add to that anyway.
At breakfast, watching Sherlock feel his way around the kitchen and make himself and John a cup of tea. John congratulates himself on his foresight of removing the eyeballs from the teacups that Sherlock is currently putting teabags in. The way his hands run along the counters, down the fridge, across the pages of the books he loves to read, almost as if he’s smoothing creases out of the different surfaces. His hands are those of an artist’s and John loves admiring his fingers as they pluck the cords on his violin and the way he knows what he’s touching thanks to the pads of his fingers. He wonders what Sherlock’s face would look like if he were to suck on those long digits. Would his mouth fall open? Would he mutter nonsense and babble about how much he loves John? Would he…?
“Yep!”
“But, Pa...”
Sherlock cracks one eye open and peers sleepily at his son. He appears to weigh up his options and considers the most appropriate answer he can give. Then he leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his chin resting on his finger tips and looking Jack in the eye.
“No.” Her voice is firm. “I don’t want anything to do with him. You give him a name. I don’t ever want to see my eyes in this place.”
Mycroft stares at the autopsy table, where both children’s remains are covered with sheets. They may be reconstructed skeletons, but he's glad he doesn’t have to see. "Strangled?"
The older man swallows, eyes locked on Sherlock’s face and the bruises that run along his jaw line, down his neck and disappear down his chest and into his dressing gown. Sherlock squirms under his scrutiny. Feeling belittled compared to his older brother who still hadn’t uttered a single word, he attempts to stand and grasps the bed for support when his injured leg refuses to hold his weight. Mycroft is cataloging every one of his injuries. Sherlock has so many things he wants to say: Where were you? You were right all along.
“Yes brother mine. Again, I have photos.”
Sherlock picks himself up and makes his way over to Bed. “No, of course not. This isn’t your fault,” he grips his hair and tugs hard. “Okay. Okay. Right, okay,” he kisses Jack’s head, his eyes determined and hard. “Plan B.”
"Mycroft will be here but will leave if Sherlock asks him to. We'll need you and Dr. Stamford in on this conversation. Jack will need to be out of ear shot."
“It’s not his fault.” I say. “I think I broke him.”
myself, that we’d misunderstood each other… I don’t care if you hate me. I don’t care if you never want to see me again. Just… live for Jack… live for your boy. He needs you… He needs his Pa. If he lost you because of me I would never be able to forgive myself… I- I-“
"FIND MY PROSTATE, GENUIS! YOU FIND THAT FUCKER RIGHT NOW!"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you.” Replies Old Magnussen and he sits down. “How is the boy?”
A shrug. "I think so. He knows everything."
“Be quiet! You’re lying!”
“Not physically! What if Sherlock refuses, wants to do things on his own? He’s not sixteen anymore, Mycroft!”
eat your share or God help me. It's quarter past one in the afternoon, we're on soft grass and I'm just rambling to myself. But you are safe, Sherlock, and I will not hurt you.”
Mycroft squeezes his hands. “That’s the first step. It may seem impossible, but you will recover from this. You will live your life.
Two down. He's the only one forgotten about in this chaos. Seven insurgents surround them. Air slips silently between his lips. They don't pay him any attention, too focused on cuffing his brothers in arms. He looks up the tall one nearest to him. He will have to take him down quick if he wants to disarm him. He can't get captured. Not again. Her lowers his hands slowly. On the ground besides him he spots a large rock, small enough to throw, yet big enough to damage. Possibly a piece of rubble. His gun presses against his spine, where it's tucked down the back of his trousers. He's glad he had the foresight to hide it.
Let me know what you think!
Sherlock's fingers tie themselves in knots in John's jumper as he drags them all the way back to the main entrance.
Sherlock reaches out for John, who grasps his hand and pulls him close. The younger man buries his face in his partner's neck to muffle his deep laughter. Just the sound of those vocal cords makes John weak at the knees. He strokes Sherlock's neck to help calm him and bites his own lip to contain his mirth.
“I love you. Don’t forget that.” He grabs the edge of Rug and rolls his son up, just like they practiced. But then Jack starts to wriggle and tries to fight his way out.
Sherlock struggles to explain his life before Jack and Room.
“Look, I know how ignorant people can be and I'm surprised that they trust you even though you're blind.” Get to the point. Sherlock hates unfinished sentences.
Jack hides behind John and shakes his head.
“I know you did not look at the document, sir. You did not open it before your brother, nor did you ask the lawyer what he requested to be written on your nephew's certificate.”
John holds out the book to him. "Here you go.”
Someone tugs on Chain and someone screams. It takes Sherlock far too long to realise it is him.
John wanted to kick himself for being so slow. Heck, he would have there and then, if it hadn't been for the limp. He was a doctor. How could he not have noticed. He was a
He stopped telling his story and reached past Mycroft for his glass of water. John grabs it for him and Mycroft craddles his baby brother. Sherlock prays they won't all hate him by the end.
Mycroft doesn't have the best way with words.
"No to both questions," replies Sherlock, having recovered from his laughing fit. "I didn't tell him I was coming, I know that when he gets back he will be forced to give me those files, especially if I'm irritating enough. That's why I brought you."
John snorts, trying to ignore how the world tilts at the man's words to reveal flashing blue and red lights. "It's your sniper, mate."
Sherlock gasps and John is worried he will try to fight him off like he did with all the doctors and nurses. But his lover smiles bright.
John rushes to him, glad his friend recognizes him again. “You had some sort of panic attack…”
Sherlock stares. His brother has never been like this. Ever. He's not sure how to fix it. "Mycroft, it's okay, I didn't get to know her... I tried to stop them, but none of us knew it would be a girl, she wasn't scared like William..."
Jack points at the man tending to him. “Pa, look. Somebody.”
Lestrade leans forward and starts recording. "Please state you name and date of birth."
“It got really cold in here and the food went off in the fridge. We ate the eggs but something was wrong, they tasted funny. A while later, Jack started throwing up.”
“Call Lestrade, tell him to do whatever it is to make my brother happy. Problem solved.”
John briefly reconsiders his gun option. "So much for soundproof."
“I know what you meant. I'll follow you in a taxi.” The detective nodded gratefully, probably more to himself and left.
As the can pulls up outside 221B Baker street, they leap out of the vehicle, John throwing the money in the cabbie’s direction as he follows Sherlock, not stopping to wait for the change. He wrestles the key into the lock and almost tears the door off its hinges as they shoot past a startled Mrs. Hudson, up the stairs into their living room. There they both freeze, as though what they’re about to do is finally dawning on them. John risks a glance at Sherlock and all his thoughts take a left turn and screech to a halt.
he’s never been with a man before, how’s any of this supposed to work? How would…?
“I know you’re not. And so does John, your father and several other people. But he wouldn’t. With your long hair he would just assume you are a girl, since it is uncommon for boys to have long hair. He wouldn’t understand and the surprise would be ruined by his confusion. And finally, I have no intention of telling him about Lestrade and whatever it was you were insinuating.” He stands up. “I’ll be back one this mess is sorted. Good day.” He walks out, his umbrella tapping the floor.
screwed.
Mrs. Hudson comes in carrying my hot chocolate. I show her my book and ask. She tuts loudly. “This book only shows what some families look like. Some have adopted family members, or step-siblings or half-siblings. And some children have only one parent or two dads or two mums. And, should there ever be a case like you grandparents, well you just have to learn to make your own family. When someone treats you like they did, it’s best to find your family elsewhere, since they clearly aren’t worth your time.” She can see I’m confused. “Like your Pa for instance. He’s still got Mycroft and you. But he’s moved here. John is his family now.”
Later that evening, after having been left behind at a crime scene and kidnapped by some guy believing he had Sherlock's best interests in mind and who'd successfully deduced him as pompously as the man he'd met earlier that afternoon, John found himself back in the flat, discussing Consulting detectives with Sherlock, who was high on nicotine.
A grey haired man is on his stomach, head bent forward and grunting as Mycroft pounds into him him mindlessly from behind.
“Good,” They turn their attention to him, “Good evening, Sherlock. A glass of water would be nice.”
John's jaw drops. Then Jack giggles and then they're both rolling on the floor laughing. "That was bloody brilliant!" he laughs wiping tears from his face. "All those times you ran away from him and you were... analyzing him."
Sherlock hiccups quietly. All colour drains out of Mycroft’s face. “If I hadn’t been captured, they would have lived…”
“Do you see this man? He’s very dangerous. We know he’s going to do something to hurt a lot of people, but we don’t know what or when. He works for some terror… bad people. He’s not so dangerous by himself, but he’s very good at carrying out orders. I have to stop him. However, so far all attempts have… been unsuccessful.”
They all fall silent as Jack’s arm flops out from under the last layer of Rug. Old Magnussen and the Witch seem surprised by this sudden turn of events. Old Magnussen searches for a pulse in Jack’s wrist.
“Here we go. Let’s cross the road,” they take two steps forward, “Now we turn right down this alley and we reach another road. We have to watch out for cars. Look left, look right and we cross. Through the park, can you see the squirrels in the trees? Look out!” They jump to one side.
Jack points his sword towards the ground and raises an eyebrow. John gulps as a perfect minature Mycroft minus the umbrella stares up at him whilst somehow looking down his nose at him. "Don't be an idiot, Doctor Watson. I perfected the art myself."
He begins to map out Sherlock’s chest with his mouth while the man runs his hands through John’s hair and sighs happily, squirming when John reaches his nipples. John loves his chest hair, so fine and smooth to the touch. Everything feels amazing. He can only hope it’s the same for Sherlock, although judging from the noises he’s making, he must be doing a pretty good job.
Isn't aware of the pain spreading from his ankle and travelling up his leg. If he doesn't stop running then he won't be able to save them from the Monsters, but they're getting further away,
"I'm sorry, Sherlock. The picture isn't a body, it's of the grave before we dug it. Please, Sherlock, I want these monsters away until they die, but for that I need you to look at the picture."
Sherlock pinches the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “This is real. Please let me finish. It’s important,” he grits out impatiently. “I thought I was being followed. But it wasn’t my brother. It was Old Magnussen and the Witch. The Witch… wanted a ‘friend’ and she chose me. I looked physically appealing to Her and They were both interested in my intellect, so They contacted me. Sent me a letter telling me They wanted my help solving a case the police hadn’t been able to handle, a violent murder. And I was so desperate to show off, to prove how clever I am that I rushed off to meet Them without thinking. I told my mother I was going to London to meet some clients. It wasn’t far from where we lived. When I got there, They were waiting for me,” he shakes his head, recalling his own stupidity. “He reached out to shake my hand, saying stuff about how They were my biggest fans. Then he stuck a needle in my arm and she shoved a bag over my head,” he pauses, sadness etched across his face like paint, “and then I was here. Taken away from my life and my future to be locked in a vault against my will. So young and stupid. I never wanted to be here, Jack.”
Sobbing, John collapses to his knees, the damn breaking. Jack calls his name but Mycroft holds the boy back, giving him space. John is grateful for that. He can’t reassure him right now. In his ear, Sherlock is panicking.
Sherlock presses his lips into a fine line, looking more upset than Jack had ever seen him. “It’s not me I’m worried about,” he rolls sideways and turns his back to his son, “Don’t ask me anymore, Jack.”
"I understand..." Mycroft glances at his brother, who tenses. "I see. I see. Thank you, Detective Inspector. You have been most helpful. Yes. Thank Philip Anderson for me too." He hangs up. "I have to go. Thank you for a very insightful conversation, Jack. I will be back for more."
“Lots of lines from trauma and sun, so late thirties or early forties. Hair cut regularly, military, most likely grey or getting there. Your limp is psychosomatic because you're leaning the wrong way, as if you're not always aware of it. This I can tell from the position of your shoulders and this usually occurs in people readjusting to life. So, you're a soldier and from your age and behavior I would say captain. Bullet wound, tremors in the left hand and yet...” He clasped John's clammy hand between his own. “It's gone now. Your psychiatrist is wrong. You need danger. Fire her.”
Oh look, another chapter! :)
And Sherlock stares at his freed leg. A paramedic starts to unravel what’s left around his leg. His skin is red and puckered and covered in blisters. Everyone in the room winces. Lestrade puts his arms under Sherlock’s shoulders and helps him up. He sways on his feet and he stands mostly on one leg, leaning heavily on Lestrade. Everyone watches silently as they hobble their way to the door. Sherlock’s breathing accelerates as they approach it, dreading this to all be a hallucination and the door would suddenly shut before he could cross the threshold. But nothing happens. He’s suddenly in a corridor and he’s not too sure what to do. He suddenly has a strange urge to turn back.
Jack nods once and runs to play with his toys.
Old Magnussen isn’t easy to fool, which is why Jack being actually sick helps. He’s no doctor, but if he can convince Them that Jack has food poisoning and is at risk of Salmonella, They might agree to take him to the hospital. Once there, Jack can yell for help and then he’ll be safe.
“No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.” Sherlock stands up from his chair and gathers his son in his arms. “I’m sorry, Jack. Please don’t cry. I didn’t mean it like that, I’m sorry.” He walks backwards towards Bed and sits his son on his lap. “You’re right, I did promise you. I promised and I should never break my promise.” He sighs. “I’ll do my best, alright? I’ll do my best. I love you. I’m sorry.” He rolls onto his side and tucks Jack under his chin and curls around him, just like he used to when Jack was an infant. “Stop crying now. Shhh. Stop crying. I love you.”
There’s another silence. Jack coughs. Sherlock swallows, ignoring the goose bumps all over his body, the way the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He can’t breathe.
John turns to face him, eyes bright, jumper looking as soft as ever, his round face making him the least scary thing he’d ever had to face. Without thinking, Sherlock moves his face towards John’s, eyes fixed on the other man’s lips.
“And I look like you, inside and out.”
Let me know what you think! I love kudos and comments! :)
"All of the above." Sherlock breathes deeply, his chest aching from the exertion of staying calm. "She was very... enthusiastic. Like I said in one of our previous interviews, she was... gentler. It confused me. I didn't know what I was supposed to feel."
Sherlock sits up, eyes curious, nervousness and excitement dancing across his face. Jack wipes his tears and crawls closer. John swallows. "Right."
"Oh no. Oh
Yep, he’s definitely dead.
“Be gentle!” wails Sherlock, reaching towards Them with both hands raised. “Be gentle!”
John's face tenses, along with his shoulders. Sherlock's heart is in his throat. He doesn't know if he can do this.
So sorry for the delay guys! I've been so busy! Thank you for sticking with me and all of your lovely comments!
The man was standing next to a seated woman, who was bent over a microscope. He was leaning on the table, using his hips and hands to maintain his balance and was staring dead ahead, listening to the girl's quiet murmurs, as she was obviously relaying everything she could see. He wasn't physically taking notes and his gaze seemed a little distant. His head turned slightly as they entered the room, John pointing out how different it was. The girl lifted her head and gave a small smile, slight confusion flitted across her face at John's appearance, but she didn't dwell on it.
“If it’s as bad as you say, he’ll be right outside the building.”
Lestrade smiles at the smaller man and holds out his hand. "It's Greg, by the way."
"When I was little, my favourite story was 'Jack and the Beanstalk'. It's about a boy named Jack who climbs up a beanstalk and escapes from giants to help his mother. Have I read you this story?"
“My father and you…”
“And besides, my brother seems to think we’ve been at it for months. If he wanted to give you the Big Brother Talk, he would have done so by now.”
at an advantage."
"John, mate? I need you to take a deep breath and put the gun, okay, Can you check Sherlock's vitals for me? John..."
“Jack’s unwell. He’s been sick three times and I don’t know what to do,” he replies, with genuine fear in his voice.
So sorry for the delay, I've moved and started a work experience. I'll try to update as often as possible. Enjoy!
So thank you all for being so patient and thank you for your support and kind comments, they kept me going through a really difficult period in my life. Thank you so much.
"Okay."
“How can you possibly know that?”
"MYCROFT! MYCROFT!"
He grieves, or at least he tries to grieve, but he feels like he feels like he’s crying for a lot more than his children. He's grieving for his own joke of a life. John stands nearby, trying to be a supportive presence. Sherlock can feel reality collapse around him.
“But we’re in Room, Pa.”
They sip their tea. The sound of an umbrella flapping open and shut, along with more yells of 'That's cheating!' reach them.
means necessary.” He doesn’t quite storm away back into the living room.
“Stop smiling, John. Satisfaction doesn't suit you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He shakes his head, jaw still working to contain his frustration. "Our situations are very different, but when I came back from Afghanistan, I couldn't do anything. I'm so used to danger, I couldn't land a job because the mundane world isn't for me. You've come back to the world and in some ways you've forgotten how to function within society too. The only way my limp went was because your son jumped out of a truck and literally ran into my life. Up until that point I didn't think I could... If I woke up tomorrow and found all this had been a dream, I wouldn't be able to..."
Jack frowns, his five year old face scrunching up to become the picture of adorableness. "They smell like each other and one time they were in the kitchen uncle Mycroft was smiling with both hands."
His eyes fly from vehicle to vehicle trying to find his small boy, his brave boy,
The world spins and John sees police cars and street lamps. He's loosing it. He turns back to the tank.
Mycroft flinches.
John doesn’t have the strength to reply. He brings his knees up and wraps himself around Jack. “I’m so sorry he said that to you. You are the bravest man and the most loving father I know and he had no right to ever make you doubt that.”
John doesn’t reply. He squeezes Sherlock’s hand and they grip each other like a lifeline. Eventually he lies back on the bed and rolls over to face Jack. Their beds have been rearranged so that they are now touching. He scoops the small boy into his arms and holds him close. Jack wraps his arms around his neck in his sleep. Someone pulls a blanket over them and another checks the bandages around his ankle. Sherlock breathes out a sigh of relief and sleeps without fear for the first time in years.
Sherlock looks unsurprised by this accusation. He sighs. “They’ll come back here to see me. That’s why you have to tell the police about Room in Appledore. So they can get here as quickly as they can.”
to him. To keep him safe.
At that moment, something rolls out at Old Magnussen’s end and across the floor under Bed.
The line goes dead. The phone slips from his fingers. He picks Jack up and carries him over to the couch. Then he remembers what Sherlock said about his brother. He goes to window and looks down. There on the pavement in the rain, umbrella still used as a cane, is Mycroft, apparently trying to freeze himself to death. John goes back to his phone and dials another number.
Sherlock swallows with difficulty. “Where have you been?” he rasps.
Jack sighs. “Why are you always son tired, Pa? You sleep more than me.”
Let me know what you think!
Breathing gradually becomes easier. John's hand strokes his hair and something wet drips onto his forehead. John. John is crying.
“It’s against the law. If the police knew we were here, they would rescue us. Your uncle Mycroft would rescue us. I’ve tried to escape numerous times, but there are two of Them and Old Magnussen, he’s very careful and incredibly intelligent. That’s how he was able to trick me in the first place.”
Lestrade continues, but Sherlock can still read people pretty well. Everyone is uncomfortable,
A strange sound reaches his ears. Mycroft was shaking so hard his teeth were chattering. Lestrade rubs his shoulders. "We got them, Myke. We got them. Charles Magnussen and Mary Morstan will never see daylight again."
Mycroft slams his foot into John’s stomach, cutting off his speech and air supply, but not enough to release his grip on him. Before John can let him go Mycroft punches him in the face and he reels back, blood running out of his nose. John stumbles back into his armchair, trying to stop the blood flow. Mycroft leaps up and towers over him, his face terrifying.
“Oh, I know I’ve never.” Breathes Old Magnussen as he unbuttons his trousers. "But after thirteen years of watching, I think I’ve earnt my go.”
It takes him a year to understand what she meant by “I don’t want to see my eyes in this place”. Seeing Jack’s eyes in Room would mean She would be able to picture herself in here. Jack is a mirror She didn’t want to have to look at. She demands that They never speak of the boy again and Sherlock slowly learns that he can love this child without fear of losing him.
They arrive at Bart's and are led straight to the morgue. Doctor Hooper awaits them, smiling nervously.
“So, does that mean you need me for more cases?”
Sherlock turned his head back in John's direction. “Who's your friend?” He asked, all the while staring over John's shoulder at the wall. Typical. The man wouldn't even look at him.
"So what do you want to discuss? Just so I can be prepared."
"Does he even know we're here?" His watch tells him it's only eight in the evening. "Doesn't he work twenty four hours a day? I can't imagine him sleeping. Just pressing a big red button every now and then and drinking tea."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, me too. I made tea."
John eyes me suspiciously. “What did you do? If you made another cake joke…”
"DO NOT bite the paramedic! John, Jack needs you-"
Instead, he breaks down in tears.
, and then he’s on his knees in Baker street, his hands trying to stop Sherlock from bleeding out onto their rug as he starts coughing up blood and suddenly everything is red and Sherlock’s blood is running down the wallpaper and they’re drowning in it and John can’t
But John doesn’t want to lose what he has already has with Sherlock. Their friendship is too important to him. But he cannot pretend forever either. He’s just going to have to be brave and say it.
They’re coming.
you.” He feels his way down John’s torso, slips his fingers the waistband of his pants and shucks them off in one fluid movement. John doesn’t have time to think as Sherlock expertly flips them over and slides down so he can wrap his hand around John’s arousal. John arches off the bed and begs Sherlock to get a move on.
Sherlock is still trying to process everything he’s just heard. “Jack, his name is Jack. Whatever happens next, he’ll be staying with me.”
Sherlock has a stick that he never uses. John knows that he doesn’t want to be seen as handicapped or a liability. His job relies heavily on his public image and while Sherlock isn’t Matt Murdock, he certainly wants to appear professional. John has said little on the matter. It’s not his job to boss Sherlock around, he’ll leave that to Mycroft thank you very much. It’s a sore subject that he feels he has no right to step into. Besides, the sibling rivalry is hilarious, particularly the staring matches in which Sherlock performs admirably considering his disability; and John often sits there, looking into the gleeful face of the younger Holmes and the saddened one of Mycroft, because the elder Holmes struggles to look into the eyes of his blind brother. John has yet to find out why. Maybe it’s simply because Sherlock cannot see him.
Thank you all for your support on this rewrite, it means a lot!! Only a couple of chapters left.
Someone is shouting his name behind him; it must be Old Magnussen. He's going to stop him from catching up with her, but he can't let
“Breathe, little Brother,” says a Mycroft, who hasn’t aged in thirteen years. “Turn your head and find air. Breathe the Easterly wind, brother mine,” his smile distorts his face. “I taught you better, Sherlock. You should have guessed his plans the moment he walked in. It was obvious by the way he had the top button of his shirt undone.”
That didn’t reassure John in the slightest. But all thoughts fly out the window as Sherlock’s mouth closes around him. Stars are the only thing he can see, yet he’s aware of Sherlock’s hand on his face, reading his reactions and most likely shelving them away for a later viewing.
Sherlock glances at Jack. “So you’re the somebody.” He says eventually. John laughs.
Sherlock kisses the top of his head. Yes, you do.”
"Which would only drive you away and give more of an excuse to my brother to hate me more than he already does. Go to him. He needs you." He leaves.
"SAY MY NAME, GREGORY! SAY MY NAME!"
He starts screaming and doesn’t stop. John wraps his arms around him and holds him tight.
It’s messy. They get flour everywhere and it takes a while to clean up afterwards. Jack kneels on a chair and washes up whilst Sherlock cleans the floor and dusts off Rug. A delicious smell soon circulates around Room. After checking the cake multiple times, Sherlock eventually smiles.
The door is opened and John hears DI Lestrade's voice float up the stairs. He's friendly enough and Sherlock has classified him as a Not Idiot, along with Mike Stamford and his brother. John has yet to know if he's in any particular category.
Sherlock looks down at Jack, who nods and seemingly regains his confidence. “Okay, I would like to thank him properly.”
"How did they react? Particularly the woman? Was it joy, rage, shock..?
Outside, in the corridor, John finds Sherlock on the floor rocking backwards and forwards, his eyes devoid of life. He turns slightly towards John and reaches out. John pulls him into a hug. For a moment they are both silent.
As They carry Jack away, the Soft Ball rolls out and hits the floor, disappearing under the bed. Sherlock remembers how the ball changed his relationship with his son. How William’s memory became special. Now the very ball he’d tried to confiscate had saved his son’s life.
The two figures are dragged to their feet end the blindfolds removed. The terrified faces of Mary Morstan and Charles Magnussen stare up at them.
There’s movement behind him. He’s not the only one staring at the mirror. The curtain has been pulled back and Jack is asleep under the blankets. John is looking over Sherlock’s body with a pained expression on his face. Sherlock watches him nervously as John walks around the bed to stand next to him.
They remain silent for a moment, only the sound of a patient crying in the hallway disturbing the peace. Mycroft breathes out slowly. “Our mother and father are great at their jobs and hobbies. But they should not be parents. Mummy said so herself.”
The man turns alarmed. "Lower your weapons! Doctor Watson is having a flashback, kindly do not make this situation worse!"
Sherlock tries not to think derogatory thoughts. He was good at hiding from Mycroft, but not this man. “Jack overheard our conversation last night.” He says, getting straight to the point. The quicker it’s over, the better. “Particularly the part where you offered to get him a present.”
"You alright, mate?"
“Is he asleep?”
"Oh God," John finally croaks. "I'll never go to the pub with Greg again. My
“It's a panda.” she explains. “I know it's round like the moon, but it seemed age appropriate. It also works as a hot water bottle.”
John smiles. He appreciates Lestrade's honesty. "Yeah."
“No.” Sherlock tries to push them all away. “Jack.”
“Jack!” he exclaims and turns back to the small boy. “Jack, look, it’s uncle Mycroft. It’s okay, I promise. Mycroft, this is my son, he helped me escape. His name is Jack.”
Sherlock grits his teeth. "I bet that was the plan; I wonder how much he paid Graham to do this."
Jack holds up a strand of his long hair. “My hair is brown, but yours is dark.” He says. “My hair has grown down my back and it’s wavy, but yours is very short. Your eyes are blue but mine are brown and your face is different shape.”
Sherlock's face is covered in blood and there are bruises forming on his forehead, cheekbones and throat. John cries and gathers the unconcious form into his arms. He struggles to find a pulse.
"What did I do wrong?" the roughness to his brother's voice startles him. "Tell me what I did wrong... I don't want to be a source of fear. I wasn't angry at you."
“No.” Sherlock cuts him off. “Please, stay.” He blushes. “Um, I mean…”
"Who's that?" hisses another insurgent.
Jack learns some new things.
Father and son stare at their respective parcels. Jack runs to Sherlock and tries to climb onto his lap. Sherlock scoops him up. “Come on, Jack, why don't we see what Mrs. Hudson got you?”
“We've only just met. I don't even know your full name.” John replied incredulously.
Of course, She didn’t want to see his face. She didn’t want to picture herself dead in this tiny, hell hole.
“I-I want a present.” Sobs Jack.
Jack is safe. Jack is
They all stand there for a while longer until the van and digger leave. His mother holds his hand. "We won't bother Sherlock unless he asks for us. But should he ask, tell him we love him."
Sherlock blinks and does a double-take. “Sorry, what? What are you talking about, what dreams?”
"Shush!" hisses Sherlock, struggling to get himself under control. "You can't giggle in his house!"
“What is the problem?” asks Jack, innocently.
(See the end of the chapter for
The first thing he is aware of is the cold. His teeth chatter and all he wants to do is crawl into a hole and die. Peeling open his eyelids, he glances once around Room and notices a blurry shape sat on one of the chairs. He squints and groans, his body shaking in an attempt to fight off the pain. He curls in on himself, grits his teeth and tries not to think about why he’s naked. They’d been violent before, but this time They’d taken it to new extremes. He reaches out slowly, aware of how every movement makes sparks of pain shoot up his arm and he pulls his T-shirt towards himself. Biting his tongue to hold back a scream, he sits up in one brief, jerky spasm and breathes heavily through his nose as he pulls his T-shirt over his head. Keeping his jaw locked, he tugs his underwear up the length of Chain and struggles to get them up over his hips. Once he’s caught his breath he turns back to the figure sat in the chair with their back to him. She’s alone. Sherlock gathers a length of Chain in his hands and tries to slide off Bed as quietly as he can, but can’t hold back the sharp intake of breath as more of his injuries reveal themselves. She cocks her head to one side and doesn’t face him as She speaks.
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock makes a strangled noise at the back of his throat. He crawls over to Jack’s body and rolls him back up, his hands shaking. The intruders watch on silently.
“Like what?”
face, enjoying the confused look in her eyes. "You killed my niece and nephew. Suffocation, I hear. As much as I want to kill you with my bare hands like you did Charlotte, I have decided that there are far more creative ways. I was going to stand here and ask you why you were going to plead Not Guilty, why you were going to blame Sherlock and more importantly, how you were planning on getting away with it, but I know that the more you talk, the better it is for you. So I'm not going to ask. I just wanted to get a good look at you whilst I said goodbye." A pause. “Lestrade.”
"It's Pa's." he whispers and John can barely hear him. "But you can borrow it." His entire head is visible as well as his right arm. He's holding his own smaller sword. "Play?" he asks, looking a little more confident.
John smiles, his heart melting a little. “Grandma?”
“You’re very welcome dear.”
Snatching it from his brother's hands, he rips it open and admires the contents inside. “Jack, look what uncle Mycroft got for you!”
“Phew! That boy on the skateboard was fast. Have to watch out for them. And now we’re in school. Ready to learn?”
So a genius and blind. John believed he may have just had something happen in his civilian life.
Sherlock senses how John twists the bed covers, how his chest heaves, how he babbles nonsense and cries Sherlock’s name and tells him how wonderful and beautiful he is and he’s going to repay him for this and show him the stars that are currently exploding in front of his eyes…
Mycroft spins to face Lestrade. "How? I don't... You said..." He stutters, completely thrown.
I try to deduce. The laptop means work, so perhaps a country has stopped his invasion? Or perhaps something to do with Pa? No, Pa isn’t work. But he used that laptop to keep evidence about Room and the Monsters. Perhaps Lestrade has sent him more work?
There’s a long silence, the tension thick enough to be cut with a knife. Sherlock stares at the newcomer, his jaw slack and their eyes are riveted to one another. Eventually, he manages to make his mouth work. He stammers. “Mycroft?”
The silence on the end is painfully long. John tries again. “Sherlock? It’s me.”
John barely notices, feeling as if he hasn't explained himself propoerly. Something's... off. "I probably should have worn it that day. If I had their sniper wouldn't have blown my shoulder." He focuses back on the man he holds at gunpoint. "One bullet and it's all over. If I wear it I'll be captured to save your men but instead I don't and I get shot and I'm sent home with tremors and a limp."
John sighs. "It wasn't there last time then?"
"Do not let Jack in, do not-"
Sherlock cracks one eye open and glares up at him. “Idiot.”
The next time he touches Sherlock is when they’re at Angelo’s. There’s a candle on the table and John is enjoying mushroom ravioli, while Sherlock tries out Angelo’s new recipe involving spinach and something that looks like it’s been through the digestive tract of a sparrow. John is relieved that Sherlock cannot see what has been put in front of him. Sherlock talks about a case from a few years ago involving a goose and a serial killer granny. John is too relaxed to even laugh. He just smiles quietly, never taking his eyes off Sherlock, allowing himself to take in all of his features. He glances down at Sherlock’s left hand, which is curled into a loose fist on the table. Because it seems appropriate, he reaches out and gently takes Sherlock’s hand in his.
“Well,” says the older man nonchalantly, like they’ve just shared a coffee and are parting ways. “Thanks for that. I’ll see what I can do about the present. And don’t worry, your performance was exquisite for a beginner,” he pats Sherlock’s leg. “We’ll be back tomorrow to shave your face. Sweet dreams.” And They’re gone.
John shrugs. “Jack was so brave and you were both so lost and…” he struggles to find words. “Maybe I should go.”
Sherlock shakes his head. His legs have gone numb. “I can’t.”
“Run, Pa,” says Jack, “Run with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s becoming very British about all of this. Mycroft will be proud.
“No. No, you can’t do that, it could be serious, it could be Salmonella or something, he’s never been sick before, he might die-“
“Do you know what we’re going to do today?” asks Sherlock, watching Jack with anticipation. The small boy shakes his head. “We are going to bake a birthday cake.”
Afghanistan disappears. John drops his gun. "Oh god."
Mycroft reaches out and takes his hand. His own heart is racing, at the thrill of what he is about to do. "I'll run with you."
Their expressions change once more. Even Mycroft can no longer look his brother. Sherlock has never seen him look so… guilty. His mother’s eyes are shut and his father doesn’t know where to look.
Picking up the razor, he takes the blades and heads to the bath, putting in the plug and turning on the cold tap. He would turn on the warm tap, but warm, cold, what does it matter? He just needs it all to end.
John collapses against Sherlock’s chair, unable to wipe the blood of his face. “I’m sorry. I attacked your brother. He attacked me. My nose won’t stop bleeding. I just… I didn’t think. I started it.”
Back in the lounge, Mycroft is cowering behind is umbrella and Jack is trying to find a weak spot. Upon hearing their footsteps, Mycroft recovers. "I believe I heard Mrs. Huson answer the door. Dr. Stamford has arrived."
John cries. Now his worst fear has come true: he’s finally shot his masculinity in the foot.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Am I in trouble?” whispers Jack, sadly.
“Mine.” Replies Sherlock, letting out a nervous breath. “I-I can navigate better.”
“You’ll be fine. I’ll be talking to you in your head the whole time. Truck, Wriggle out, Jump, Deduce, Somebody. Do you think you can do that?”
“Yes, you do, but only because it’s still a baby’s nose.”
His mother glares out across the car park. His father swallows. “Sit down, Sherlock.”
"Yep.
“For a while afterwards I felt as though I was being followed. At first I thought my brother had increased his surveillance on me.”
The small boy squirms. “I really want a Grandma who loves me.”
Old Magnussen and the Witch communicate silently, no words spoken between them. Sherlock tries to get Their attention.
He opens his eyes. He’s standing in one of the many rooms of his Mind Palace. It looks just like Room, except it’s empty and stretches as far as the eye can see. Empty asides from the small boy standing not too far in front of him.
She tilted her head, regarding the two men with narrowed eyes. “The police said that you wanted to talk to me...I don’t really understand why. I’ve told them everything I know. I feel quite helpless, actually.” She picked up a napkin from the table, twisting it in her hands. “I’ve spoken to so many official people, I can’t keep track of who’s who anymore.”
-John I'm sorry about this morning. Work was awful wasn't it?
As it happened, it was Christmas Eve when Sherlock and John finally threw their bags into the back of the rented Land Rover for the drive north.
-I need you. Please hurry. -SH
Sherlock hummed his agreement. “They have been through a lot in their time together, I believe it has forged a very strong bond.” Sherlock’s breath crystallized, visible in the frigid air. “A bit like us, I suppose.” He wanted to reach out, wanted to hold John’s hand...wanted to hold him close again. “I admit, there are not many things that I don’t understand, John. But relationships...I don’t have practical experience to draw upon.” He kept his eyes trained forward.
"I ran into Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Turner on the street out front, they were heading out to do some holiday shopping. I should probably get started on that as well." John spoke distractedly over his shoulder as he tried to light a fire in the grate. "I was thinking about having a small get together with friends here, maybe on Christmas Eve?" John waited a few moments for Sherlock's reply, but it seemed none was forthcoming. Finally satisfied with the fire, he turned to face Sherlock.
John leaned in, their foreheads touching, sharing the warmth of breath in the cold night air. “You are the most brilliant, captivating, magnificent, lovely man, Sherlock.” John’s voice sounded choked with emotion. He took a deep breath in before he continued. “As you have undoubtedly observed, I struggle with relationships as well. Would you...do you want to…” John was shaking with emotion under Sherlock’s hands. “We could figure it out together, yeah?” John moved forward, gently kissing Sherlock’s lips. It was glorious.
Mummy had started to collect the remainders of ripped paper and bags when Sherlock reappeared. One hand carried a large gift bag, the other a sturdy looking flat package. Sherlock handed the flat package to John with a smile and a wink, then turned to Dad. “Merry Christmas, Dad. This is from both John and I, and it cannot be returned.” He handed Dad the bag, returning to sit next to John.
The Captain had just made the announcement, they were about to land at Miami International. It was a balmy 26 C on the ground. Sherlock thought about changing his watch setting to 11 PM, but didn't want to disturb John. Sometime after he had fallen asleep, John leaned over and practically curled around Sherlock's side.
Mummy was indignant. “I slaved over that cake since September, Charles. Adding brandy every week until it could have sloshed itself down to the WI meeting.” She paused, aggressively buttering a scone. “See if I ever make that kind of effort for the likes of them again!” Mummy took a deep breath. “Now, more tea for anyone?”
CHAPTER 8
What about Mrs. Hudson? Is she safe? - SH
"What's this?" Asked John. He took the envelope as he sat in his armchair. He pulled out the enclosed card and smiled as he read it. "Your parents have invited both of us to their house? That's really sweet of them to include me." John looked over at his friend. "You sure you want me to tag along? I know you don't get to see your family that often, I wouldn't want to intrude."
John leaned his head against the small window, the rain pelting against the glass. The relentless drumming was doing nothing to help his pounding headache. He lucked out in getting a seat on this flight at all, and the relief of actually making it to the gate and boarding the plane on time was helping him to ignore his soaking wet trainers and soggy jeans. At least the middle seat was empty, a little more room to stretch out his bad leg would make the 9-hour trip marginally more tolerable. Maybe he would indulge with a whiskey once the drinks cart came by. He took a deep breath in, held it a moment, closed his eyes and let it out slowly. He could do this.
Sherlock had stopped playing when he heard John stretching and moving about. He turned to face John with a small smile on his face. "Yes, John?" He replied.
I've arranged for you to meet with the victim's widow, Mrs. Deborah Ayers, for questioning. Tomorrow afternoon at 4 pm. You'll receive details in the morning. - MH
“Well, look at you two, you’ve been busy! What have you got there?” Mummy circled round the back of the car to open the boot for John.
Oh no.
******
“Not as much as I adore you.” replied Dad. “Now boys, let’s get your bags out of the hall. Sherlock, don’t you make John carry all those himself!”
He continued to lean against Sherlock for a few moments, then reluctantly pulled away. John tried to hide his embarrassment, but his blushing cheeks gave him away. "Sorry about that…it's been a long time since I've been in an airplane. Didn't expect to react quite that badly." John wiped his palms on his jeans.
For now.  I'm working on the situation. I'll keep you updated. MH
“The first thing we have to figure out, John, is what to give my father tomorrow...we never did get around to getting him a Christmas gift.”
Sherlock stood silently, holding John’s sleepy form close to him. What does this mean? Does this mean anything? Is it possible...could John have...romantic...feelings for him? Sherlock’s mind was racing behind his stoic exterior. Sherlock didn’t have answers to his many questions, but as the world’s only consulting detective, he knew the way to find them...experimentation. He slowly moved a hand from John’s back, up to cup his head. He positioned John’s head just a bit closer to his face, ruffling the hair at the nape of John’s neck with his fingers. Sherlock slowly brought his face down, gently pressing his lips to John’s forehead. John continued to snuggle contentedly, saying “I had so much fun with you tonight. Wish it was Christmas all year.” Sherlock smiled - interesting results, he thought to himself.
The plane had landed during their conversation, and John hadn't even noticed. Amazing, he thought. They taxied to the gate, people were getting restless, standing and shifting to retrieve bags from the overhead compartments. The old woman on the other side of Sherlock elbowed him squarely in the chest in her haste to stand up.
“Oh, you!” Mummy batted at Dad good naturedly. “You know you like them, admit it.” She giggled.
“Of course, sir.  What’s on your mind?” John questioned, feeling suddenly nervous at Dad’s tone.
Sherlock turned back from the staircase. “Apologies, John. Allow me to carry this one.” He smirked, grabbing the smallest of the bags from John’s grasp. “Follow me!” Sherlock bounded up the narrow stairs.
John tucked his hands deep into his pockets and looked around the square appreciatively. “The stars out here are almost as bright as the fairy lights.” He remarked. “Your parents are really sweet together.” John nudged Sherlock with his elbow.
“Mr. Holmes, thank you for the invitation.” John stuffs his hands in his pockets, feeling shy in the face of so much friendly acceptance. “Your slippers are fantastic!”
Sherlock paused in the removal of his trousers, as he registered the fatigue in John’s voice. He turned and met John on the landing at the top of the stairs, noting the dark circles under the man’s eyes. “That was an unexpected Christmas treat, John.” Sherlock reached out and took his coat out of John’s arms, hanging it on the coat rack as they moved into the kitchen.
They sat together in silence for a while, watching the fire and enjoying the whiskey. Eventually, Dad set his glass down on the side table and leaned forward a bit, bracing his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands. “John, I hope you’ll indulge an old man...I’ve something that I’d like to speak with you about.” Dad gave John a serious, level look.
Sherlock stood like a statue for a few moments more before clearing his throat and collapsing into his own armchair in a dramatic pile. "That's sorted, then. We'll drive up on the 23rd, if that's alright with you. I know Mummy will have plans for us on Christmas Eve, there's always something going on in the village." Sherlock met John's eyes shyly. "I also need to do some holiday shopping, if you want to go together? That might make it a marginally more pleasant experience."
Sherlock opened the door with a theatrical flourish. “Make yourself at home, John.” John followed his friend into the room, carrying his bags.
“Good evening, sir, I have a package here for a Mister...Sherlock Holmes?” John leaned on the door frame, briefly wondering if he should be suspicious of the offered package. “I can sign for that, would you tell me who it’s from?” asked John. “Yes sir, just a ‘mo”...the courier shifted the package to read the delivery slip better in the light from the doorway. “It says here, sender is Mycroft Holmes”. The courier held out his tablet for John to sign. He handed John the package, which was a thin envelope, about the size of a magazine. “Thanks, have a good night” John said as he turned to close the door. He turned the envelope over in his hands, wondering what Mycroft would be sending Sherlock by courier. As he was coming up with more and more fanciful possibilities, his phone buzzed with a text.
Sherlock’s impromptu Christmas concert was quite pleasant, with only a couple of arguments breaking out over song lyrics, facts, and origins. John ate his fill of scones, and even got Sherlock to eat by purposefully leaving his plate within Sherlock’s reach, as he knew Sherlock wouldn’t be able to stop himself from taking bites of John’s breakfast. “All right, must get on, John! We’ve places to go, people to see!” Sherlock was practically vibrating with energy. John was tying his shoes, then grabbed his jacket. “Mrs. Hudson, have a wonderful Christmas, and safe travels if we don’t see you before we leave tomorrow.” John gave her a quick hug, kissing her cheek. “Happy Christmas, boys!” Mrs. Hudson called after them, hearing the front door slam behind them.
“Yes, unless my parents have added to the collection recently.” Sherlock stepped towards the door. “Feel free to borrow any you like, John.” Sherlock loved when John’s interest was piqued, he lit up with an internal glow. “Would you like to see your room now?” he asked.
Sorry for the delay, Christmas shenanigans have kept me from writing! Hope you are enjoying the story.
"Alright, okay…I know it's uncomfortable, but we’ll be landing fairly soon. Here, the armrest is all yours, it might help if you lean over a bit." As Sherlock took him up on the offer, John got a breath of an intoxicating scent. It was slightly more than just the wonderful cologne, he didn't know how to describe it in words. Maybe it’s just Sherlock.
“Sorry, Sherlock...I’m so sorry. I was more tired than I thought, I guess.” John let his arms drop, taking a deep breath. “I’ll head up to bed, I think.” Sherlock smiled at him, saying softly, “You do that, John. Sleep well.”
John awoke to Sherlock arguing with a podcast. He struggled to sit up, taking stock of himself and his whereabouts. “Hey, Sherlock…” he started. Looking at his watch, John saw that over two hours had passed. “Sorry I slept so long.” He rubbed his face with his hands and tried to smooth his rumpled hair.
They wrapped up in warm winter attire before stepping into the chill outside of Town Hall. “Would you like to walk around for a bit, boys?” asked Mum. “The Christmas lights in the square are quite nice, and I believe some of the shops are open for a few hours yet.” Mummy tucked her arm through Dad’s, cuddling in close to his side. “How about we meet at the car in an hour?”
The chaos of the other passengers getting settled had slowed, and John was bracing himself for the inevitable rumblings of taxi and take-off. He momentarily regretted not having the Xanax that Mary had suggested, but hoped that his exhaustion would allow him to remain unconscious for most of the flight. He was pulled out of his thoughts by the insistent buzz of his mobile. He slid it out of his pocket and checked the screen. John sighed, pursing his thin lips.
Pretty sure your Dad just gave me the “if you hurt him, I’ll kill you” talk
They continued on, stopping for roasted chestnuts and mulled wine. As they were passing a stall with pottery and ceramics, John chuckled at something that caught his eye. “What’s funny, what did I miss?” Sherlock scanned the display, his eyes landing on a pie dish with a message written in mathematical symbols spelling out I ATE SOME PIE ((√-1) (2^3) (Σπ).) stamped in the center of the dish. “John, that’s brilliant!” Sherlock sprinted over to the stall owner, and was soon the owner of said dish. “Did you know that Mummy is a mathematician? This is perfect for her! It’s silly, and she loves to bake.” Sherlock handed the shopping bag to John. “Okay, now just Father left...he’s a bit tricky.”
“And John. Welcome, son.” Daddy Holmes shook John’s hand, stepping closer for a light embrace. “Katy and I are so happy you could join us to celebrate this year.” He stepped back, wrapping his arm around his wife’s shoulders. “We’ve been begging Sherlock to bring you up for a visit, he keeps putting us off.”
"I'm not really up to a relationship dissection right now, Mike. Sorry, I just…I'm just tired. Her announcing the affair at the breakfast table was surprising, but as I said, we've not been as close as we should have been lately. I'm actually feeling okay about it right now, just need to get through the rest of the day at the clinic and hopefully get off to the airport." John pushed his cup to the side, tapping his fingers on the tabletop. "I'm more surprised she dropped out of the trip to Miami, to be honest. She was the one that really wanted to go." He started to stand, "Walk back with me?" he asked.
"What's going on, John? I heard you and Mary are finished? Are you still up for the conference, I don't want to be insensitive, but I was really looking forward to a week of sun. And some interesting master classes. The States really do these things up right, you know?" Mike spoke in a rush. "I've been rushed off my feet this week, it'll be a relief to be back at the hospital soon as well, won't it?" He had hurriedly added two packs of sugar and a creamer to his to-go cup of coffee, and shoved a wrapped sandwich into his jacket pocket.
"I don't doubt it for a moment. All I'm suggesting is that you consider the delivery. Is this man's private life information that really needed to be shared out loud?" John's tone was bemused.
He was tall, his legs were uncomfortably cramped in the small space. He was wearing an expensive looking suit (and he smelled amazing…what was that?), and his pale skin contrasted nicely with gorgeous ebony curls. He turned towards John, piercing him with an annoyed glare, but all John saw was his unusual eyes. He couldn't name the color, maybe silvery blue? John's eyes dropped to the man's lips, he'd never seen such a pronounced Cupid's Bow…he felt his cheeks flush just looking at them.
Sherlock? Not Sherlock Holmes? The detective from London?
Sherlock was still riding the high of success when they returned to Baker Street in the wee hours of Christmas Eve morning. He ran up the stairs, shedding articles of clothing as he went. John followed, huffing in exasperation. “At least wait until you’re in the flat, you great berk!” He was exhausted and starving, so having to pick up after a grown man was just not on.
“I’m boiling, let’s sit in the shade…” She gestured them towards a table. “Would you two like something to drink? I should know better than to agree to afternoon lessons, I get so overheated!” She signaled the waiter as soon as they were seated, removing her white visor and smoothing her dark hair. The waiter approached the table with menus, but Mrs. Ayers waved hers away, requesting only a sweet tea with lemon.
"You expressed an interest in my case. I require your assistance, I left my skull at home. " Sherlock admitted.
"Honestly, John, I'm not sure. It depends on my contacts here. But don't worry, I'll find you" Sherlock promised.
John carried two mugs of freshly made tea through, setting one down next to his chair and handing the other to Sherlock. “I’ve just come down, myself,” John replied to Sherlock, “and the decorations, Mrs. Hudson...all Sherlock!” John smiled, sitting himself down in his chair and taking a sip of tea. John looked at Sherlock over the edge of his mug, remembering the feel of the man’s lips against his forehead. He hoped the steam from the tea would excuse the blush now coloring his cheeks. “You look very nice today, Sherlock.” John had wondered if Sherlock would act differently this morning...it felt like their relationship was shifting into unknown territory, and yet, they hadn’t spoken directly about it.
Debbie gave Sherlock a wounded look. “I’ll admit, we hadn’t been on the best terms recently. He was always preoccupied and calling at the last minute to cancel our evening plans together.” She set her glass back on the table and began twisting her wedding ring nervously.
The sound of raised voices pulled John from his hard-won slumber. He raised his head to look over the seats, trying to see what the disturbance was about, and who was causing it. It would be just his luck if the plane was being taken over by terrorists right now.
“John, how do you take your tea?” asked Mummy, preparing to pour into a large mug.
“I did, John. I love to bake. There are a few things I make every year, as tradition, you know. But when Sherlock called me with a list of your favorite foods, I was happy to have some new recipes to try!” Mummy failed to notice the blush taking over Sherlock’s face as she spoke.
"You don't mind, do you? It's just that we have a few days here, and while I don't think we need to get a tree, I know you like things to feel festive. I thought this might do the trick." He waved his bow about to encompass the cheerful sitting room. Sherlock had wanted to surprise John, but maybe he should have waited and asked if John wanted to decorate together?
John rubbed his hand through his hair, stiff from the saltwater pool. Sherlock had said they were meeting someone for an interview today, but he couldn’t recall the time.
John set his mobile down. It really was quite hot out here, he felt a bit sweaty and overheated. Surprised to see he was still the only guest on the pool deck, he stood up. Dropping his shades on the lounge chair, he took a quick step/hop, performing a perfect cannonball, sending sprays of water flying. He swam underwater the length of the pool before lifting himself out again. He gathered his things, heading inside to take a shower and dress.
“Now, don’t be ridiculous, Sherlock!” Mummy looked exasperated. “Of course she’s not my nemesis. She’s just the secretary of the local WI, and happens to be a complete cow.”
Sherlock was tapping his foot impatiently under the table. His pretense of charm was dropped in favor of exasperation. “Yes, yes. Of course, he had lost interest in you, the marriage, etcetera. What did he say to you  - exactly - before you left?” John subtly kicked Sherlock’s shin, earning himself an affronted squawk from the detective.
"Forget it, it's fine. Will you be alright now? I can ask the attendant for some water if you'd like." Sherlock offered. He felt vaguely embarrassed as well, but wasn't sure why. He wasn't unaware of the needs of others in general, but it was rare that he reacted to them. What was it about John that made him feel so protective? They barely knew each other.
Sherlock briefly put his arm around John’s shoulders to steady him, then dropped it back, joining his hands behind himself as he strolled. “Mycroft won’t be able to make it this year. Mummy is beside herself, she’s tried bribing him with promises of cake, but has remained unsuccessful so far”. Sherlock turned his head slightly, looking down into John’s face. He couldn’t help smiling, John looked so relaxed. The holiday lights were adding golden shimmers to the deep blue of John’s eyes, and his nose and cheeks were pink from the cold.
John felt the loss of contact, his breathing slowed a bit but he didn't quite feel in control of himself. Sherlock reached his arm behind John's shoulders, pulling him in to lean more comfortably against his side. "Alright?" Sherlock asked. Again, John nodded once. His cheek rubbed against the fine fabric of Sherlock's suit jacket. "That's it. Try to take a deep breath. Count three on the inhale, hold for three, and three on the release." Sherlock's voice in his ear was deep, his breath warm against his cheek. John closed his eyes and tried to follow his direction. It wasn't long until he had his breathing under control.
“Coral Gables Country Club. We’re meeting Mrs. Deborah Ayers. She has a tennis lesson, and this is the only time she could fit us in.” Sherlock glanced over at John, scrutinizing his new friend. “I see you enjoyed some time at the pool this morning, I’m glad.” He reached over to adjust the air. “I don’t know how anyone can live in this heat, John, I can’t think!” He gripped the gear shift in frustration.
"Yeah, ta. Though it'll feel amazing to stretch out in a bed, I'm sure." John cringed at himself, he didn't want Sherlock to think he was propositioning him…did he? "I never did find out what you're doing in Miami, did I?"
Sherlock smirked. “I merely pointed out the fact that he had been borrowing vehicles for personal use, I’m surprised he wasn’t caught out before now.” Sherlock invaded John’s space, pressing into him as he reached above John’s head to grab two mugs, setting them on the counter.
Sherlock turned on his best Southern charm, at least for the moment. “I’m dying for a sweet tea as well, how about you, John?” He smiled, relaxing into the cushioned wicker chair.
Sherlock opened his eyes wide, a surprised look on his face. "That's not what people usually say." He seemed confused.
"John?" Sherlock said, softly. "John, you need to wake up. We're about to land. The Captain actually got us here in one piece." Sherlock smiled, seeing John's eyes flutter open.
John took a small step back. “Umm...sorry but...did you just, um...kiss me?” John’s expression was a mix of  surprise and - was that relief? Sherlock was scrutinizing John’s reaction closely as he answered.
A belated Merry Christmas, my friends! Apologies that I missed posting on the holiday itself, I was traveling to visit relatives in Russia. I made it to Moscow on Christmas night, and now I'm writing in their cozy living room. It just started snowing outside, and I can see the buildings outlined in colored lights from my window...the wintry scene put me in the perfect mood for this chapter. Enjoy!
"How much longer will you be working on this experiment? There's no room for anything in here, I don't even know where you expect me to make tea, now that you've moved the kettle under the bench!" John leveled a gaze at his flatmate.
“Why would I have brought my gun to your parents’ house?” John asked. Sherlock just looked at him. “Yes, all right, I have it.” He grumbled.
John chuckled as he turned, heading back down and into the kitchen. This was going to be a long night.
Minutes later, John was struggling up the stairs to the flat with his shopping. He pushed through the doorway into the kitchen, dropping the bags on the floor. Looking far from bored, Sherlock had taken over every available space on the table and counters with a new experiment. This one must have something to do with perfumes or cologne, and the combination of aromas that greeted John made him lightheaded.
"Sherlock!" John hissed under his breath. He was beginning to see the treatment that his fellow flight passengers had been subjected to, and why they may have had an issue with the detective.
The view from the floor to ceiling windows would be spectacular in daylight, but at the moment he only saw his own reflection in the glass. He picked up the remote that controlled the drapes and watched as they smoothly shut.
Sherlock continued to look at John questioningly.
"No, we never got to that. It's a bit of a long story, though. The short version is that I'm doing a favor for a friend." Sherlock found himself itching to tell John all the details, he was sure John would be excited about the case.
Sherlock chuckled. “Oh, John.” He pulled around the curved drive, stopping at the front door. “You haven’t seen anything yet.”
Sherlock interrupted him. “Don’t worry, John. I’ve got it covered.” The detective turned into a grand, gated entrance, stopping to give their names to the attendant. He turned to John with an animated glint in his eyes. “Ready, John? Let’s see what Mrs. Ayers can tell us.”
Sherlock changed gears, handling the clutch and gear shift as smoothly as a professional. “This way I don’t need to worry about performance or agreements, John. We need speed and agility, but also to blend into the woodwork, so to speak.” He checked his rearview mirror and changed lanes again. “I did some research last night while you were sleeping. This model is popular in Miami, so we won’t stick out...we won’t be remarkable whether we’re using valet parking or hanging around a warehouse parking lot in the dark.”
CHAPTER 2
“John. Welcome to Honeybourne.” Sherlock felt a small sense of pride that John had slept peacefully the whole drive, that he had kept John safe. Sentiment. They had just entered the village of Honeybourne, where his parents had settled for their retirement years.
“Why don’t you apply my methods of deduction, John?” Sherlock said with a smile.
CHAPTER 8
"John. You are a doctor." Sherlock stated.
John squeezed his detective's hand in comfort, and smiled indulgently up at him. "Of course, Sherlock. I don't want to be separated from you either." He felt ridiculously pleased as the blush colored his detective's beautiful face.
"Sherlock? How did you find me? Are you alright? What's dangerous?" the many questions John had all fought to be the first out of his mouth. "Did you need somewhere to stay? " John tried to keep his voice from sounding too hopeful.
- Stop guessing. It’s a surprise. - SH
-Stop flirting with shop girls and come home. -SH
“Merry Christmas, Dad. Good night.” John made his way back upstairs, pulling his mobile from his pocket to text Sherlock.
-What about tea?
Thank you to those of you who bookmarked this story! It makes my heart happy.
-No. I'm bored. -SH
“Boys! Tea is ready!” Mummy called up the stairs.
John gathered his things for the shower and bounded back down the stairs, where he saw Sherlock, now engrossed in his laptop in the sitting room. The fading light from the front windows combined with the fairy lights to cast a halo-like glow around the man. The heat from the fire had given Sherlock uncustomary rosy cheeks, and suddenly John was struck with the urge to run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, and envisioned pulling his friends’ face close and kissing him.
Sherlock found himself momentarily speechless- another unexpected side effect of spending time with John Watson, he mused. He had been shocked when John took his hand outside the hotel. He could still feel the warmth from John's strong fingers wrapped around his palm, and wondered if it would be acceptable if he reached over and reclaimed them. He decided to reach for his drink instead, at least for the moment. Just a bit of liquid courage, he thought to himself.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has just turned on the Fasten Seatbelt sign. We are now crossing a zone of turbulence. Please return to your seats and keep your seatbelts fastened. Thank you."
He heard Mary moving about in the bedroom, and steeled himself for an uncomfortable conversation. John took his cup of tea and settled in his usual chair at the table. Mary pushed past him to grab her own steaming mug, turned and leaned her hip against the counter. She was hugging herself closely, and the first sips of the warm tea felt heavenly. "John…" Mary hesitated, not wanting to start the day with another row. Things between them had seemed so tense lately. They really needed this holiday, if she could just convince John to get on the plane.
John unconsciously leaned into Sherlock, his body seeking comfort in this situation that his mind couldn't control. They sat this way for a few moments before Sherlock removed his hand. The Fasten Seatbelt light had blinked off, followed by an announcement that they were again free to move about the cabin.
“I can see why you would like this room.” John set Sherlock’s bags at the end of the bed. “Have you read all of these books?” John walked over to investigate the bookshelves, interested in a few titles already.
"I'll be fine, Mike. Yeah. So Mary has been cheating on me, can you believe it?"
It was the smell of fresh coffee traveling up the stairs that roused John out of his deep sleep the following morning. His mind was slow to catch up, remembering that he didn’t have to report to the clinic this morning. He decided to wallow for a bit in the coziness of his blankets, burying his head deeper into the pillow. His thoughts started turning over yesterday’s events. Last night had been...interesting. Good. Maybe...really good?
The next thing he remembered was waking up to Sherlock leaning over him, his hands gently squeezing John’s shoulders. John groaned quietly, looking around in confusion. “It’s all right, John. You fell asleep, if you stay here all night your shoulder will hurt for a week.” Sherlock took John’s hands in his, rubbing them and pulling John to a standing position. “Ta Sherlock, you’re right.” John leaned forward, feeling slightly unsteady on his feet. Sherlock stepped into his personal space, likely intending just to steady him, but in his sleepy state, John leaned forward into Sherlock’s chest, circling his arms around his friend and hugging him tightly. John rubbed his face on Sherlock’s soft sweater, inhaling the warm scents of sandalwood and cinnamon. He hummed in satisfaction. “Mmm...this is nice” John mumbled sleepily.
“Sherlock. Wonderful.” Daddy Holmes smiled, stepping towards Sherlock to pull him into an easy hug. “Would it be such a bother for you to text us, let us know where you are? Your mummy was quite worried.” Daddy Holmes scolded Sherlock while holding him at arm’s-length, giving him a thorough once-over. “You look well for a change, my boy!” Daddy squeezed his shoulders, releasing him to turn to John.
John rubbed his hand across his face sleepily, then scrubbed it through his hair. He sat up, suddenly realizing that his position was almost in the detective's lap. "Oh my God, Sherlock! I'm so sorry. Why didn’t you push me off? I hope you weren't too uncomfortable. God. I'm really sorry" John exclaimed. Could this night get any more embarrassing?!
The drinks were served in tall, icy glasses. Sherlock took a long sip of his sweet tea - John’s eyes were riveted by the movement of his throat, convulsing endlessly as he swallowed. The doctor had to shake his head to clear it of some steamy thoughts... consciously directing himself to stop staring at the man. He was thankful for the bit of sun he got this morning, hoping it would conceal the blush that colored his cheeks. Get it together, John - be professional! He thought to himself.
John had settled back into the sofa with his legs propped on the coffee table, while Sherlock disappeared into his bedroom. He returned with an incredibly soft-looking, cream colored throw blanket that he draped over himself as he sat down next to John. John felt hyper aware of the closeness of their bodies...he could feel Sherlock’s body heat radiating next to his thigh and was finding it quite distracting. If it was anyone besides Sherlock, he would put his arm around them and draw them close...probably go in for a bit of snogging. But it’s Sherlock. Sherlock wouldn’t want to make out with him...would he? John didn’t know if he was brave enough to find out.
John let out a small but infectious giggle, causing Sherlock to first smile, then laugh himself. Sherlock was suddenly grateful to the annoying idiots on the plane that he had already insulted, and the interfering flight attendant.  He had just met this unassuming, seemingly average man, and had no idea what his plans were. But he knew that he wanted to find out.
“Ahem...yes, well...what are the plans for this evening?” Sherlock clumsily tried to change the subject, avoiding John’s fond gaze.
"Where are you staying? I'd like to take you to dinner, it's the least I can do to thank you for everything you put up with tonight." John didn't want to let this man go, not without knowing when he would see him next.
“There is a strong scent of urine in here, John. She’ll need to become accustomed to it, it could take up to a month for Dad to train the little beast.” Sherlock stood, carrying the pillow back to the bed.
A female flight attendant was standing in the aisle towards the back of Business Class, leaning over a woman that looked like she was in tears. The attendant was speaking in a low voice, but it was clear that she was trying to diffuse a situation. She was answered by a rumbling baritone voice, John strained his neck trying to see the man it belonged to. The attendant stepped back as if she had been slapped, her face struggling to retain her composure.
John tried to control his excitement. Did Sherlock just invite me up to his room?! He smiled as he signaled for the check. He turned back to the detective, looking at him with barely contained heat. "That sounds like a great idea. I don't see that I've done anything useful yet, and I really do want to help. I have a few old friends in the US Army, I can look them up and see if anyone can help me out with a gun." John paid the check, then stood, extending his hand to the detective.
“Oh my, I haven’t seen Martha in an age!” She exclaimed. “How is she?”
"It's not that I don't want to have a party, although no, I don't want to have a party." Sherlock leaned against the counter, watching John prepare the tea.
Sherlock's eyes followed the path of John's tongue with interest. Fascinating, he thought. He had never experienced this connection with another person before, and he didn't quite know what to make of it.
“You were planning on leaving him anyway, so him turning up missing was fine with you. You’re hoping the police find his body, so you can collect the life insurance payout and start over with your boyfriend.” Sherlock shared his revelations with a flourish, then returned to his seat.
John raised his eyebrows, and turned to get a better look at Sherlock. "Consulting detective? That sounds exciting. What exactly does it mean, though? People come to you with their problems and you help them?" John noticed that Sherlock hadn't addressed the girlfriend issue at all. Hmmm. Should he risk asking again, or just leave it? Leave it, for now, at least.
Sherlock's eyes chased the thoughts across John Watson's face. He could see the exhaustion in the older man, as well as the attraction. He had, of course, seen attraction directed at himself by both men and women, but this was the first time he felt compelled to act on it. His past sexual partners had been chosen out of a need to understand why sex was such a powerful motivator, and he had been left as uncomprehending after the physical acts as he had been before. It must be this feeling that makes the difference, he thought. This need, this desire to touch John, to know his every thought. To run my hands down his sides and grip his hips, to…
John grunted in agreement. “Well, at least not a puppy...maybe we could rescue an older dog that’s already house trained.” John was laying on his side, head resting on his arm, appreciating the sight of Sherlock’s bum - marveling that he was allowed to appreciate said bum openly now.
The Holmes lived in a beautiful stone cottage, which was decorated very tastefully for the holidays with evergreen garlands and wreaths, red bows, and white fairy lights around every window and door frame.
John was surprised at how many presents he was receiving, expecting only one or two. Sherlock’s cheeks flushed as he met John’s questioning gaze. “I may have gone a bit overboard, John. I hope you don’t mind.” He took a seat next to John on the rug in front of the fire.
It was almost noon by the time Sherlock settled into the driver’s seat and plugged his phone in, choosing a Spotify playlist. John adjusted the heat settings from the passenger seat and sat back. He was asleep before they were even out of London.
Very funny.
Sherlock watched all of these thoughts cross John’s expressive face. He smiled, putting his arm around his doctor. “Don’t worry, John. You’ll like this one.” Sherlock opened the folder, pulling out a travel brochure. “Mycroft needs some legwork done in the British Virgin Islands. We’ll make quick work of it, then have a holiday there, until you have to go back to work, if you’d like.”
-I need some. -SH
“Wow, this is really nice.” John took in the details slowly. The room was painted a robin’s egg blue, with a white cast iron bed in the center. There were windows on either side, and a beautiful carved wooden chest at the foot of the bed. Where Sherlock’s room had a wall of bookcase, John’s had a white brick fireplace. There were two low, velvet armchairs in front of the fire. The wood floor was covered with a gorgeous but worn Persian rug in patterns of blue and green. John placed his bags on the floor and sat down on the wooden chest.
Shut up, Mycroft. I am not a child. - SH
John's face was frozen in shock. How in the world could Sherlock know all these intimate details of his life when they had known each other for barely an hour? His mouth opened and closed a few times before he found his voice, and was able to speak. "Brilliant." He noticed Sherlock's shy smile and a slight pink blush coloring his high cheekbones. "That was absolutely brilliant. How could you possibly know all of that?" The tip of John's tongue brushed along his bottom lip, and he sat back, waiting to hear Sherlock's methods.
Sherlock actually spent a good deal of time lounging about wrapped in a sheet, so the sight of his half-naked body wasn’t shocking to John. It had, however, been increasingly difficult to ignore his own response to it...how in the world does he have those abs when all he eats is sugar?!
-SHismyBFF
Sherlock inhaled deeply. "I don't usually eat or sleep when I am working a case, John. I will admit to not thinking as clearly as usual, though." Sherlock ducked his head shyly. "It would probably be better if you came back to my hotel with me, my brother put me in an enormous suite, so there is plenty of room. And we still need to sort out a gun…it just makes sense to stay together."
-This is ridiculous. You can't leave without talking this over.
“Ummm...great. That’s...exciting.” John loved going on cases, he really did. But when they were on a case, the Work takes priority, obviously. A small part of him was hoping they would have a few days together...now that they were...together. Without distractions like work and cases...Oh well, can’t be helped, he thought.
It was a short drive through the village before they were surrounded on all sides by farmland. The homes were few and far between, breaking up the monotony of the snowy landscape. They drove past a split-rail fence and over a small hill. Nestled in the valley was what John would describe later as a Christmas card brought to life.
John returned to Sherlock’s suite, finding his luggage had all been delivered. He unpacked into one of the empty wardrobes, thinking that his clothes looked a bit dingy in comparison to all the clean, shiny white of the surroundings.
The sun was beginning to warm the room by the time John felt ready to get up. He was looking forward to a lazy morning with coffee and the papers...and, yes...spending the day with Sherlock. He was pulling a sweater over his head when he heard a familiar “Whoo hoo! Boys!” from downstairs. John smiled, bounding down from his room to greet Mrs. Hudson. “Happy Christmas, Mrs. Hudson!” John leaned over the tray she was carrying to kiss her cheek. “All ready for the holiday? Did you and Mrs. Turner finish your shopping last night?” Mrs. Hudson set the tray of scones down on the kitchen table, which was surprisingly clear. Sherlock must have actually cleaned up last night...it’s a Christmas miracle, John thought, chuckling to himself.
This wasn’t the first time John had noticed Sherlock’s appearance, nor would it be the last. He had resolved to keep these thoughts to himself though, mostly because Sherlock was his best friend and he didn’t want to do anything that might jeopardize that...also, from his observations so far, it didn’t appear that Sherlock was interested in having a romantic relationship with anyone. People were constantly flirting with the man, and it just seemed to go right over Sherlock’s head.
"Gee, thanks so much." John replied dryly.
"That was…" John started.
They were meant to leave for Miami tomorrow morning, hopefully when they returned the following week things could get back to normal. That's what he wanted wasn't it? His left hand was shaking as he reached for the kettle.
Sherlock signed into the hotel WiFi on the complimentary iPad, beginning to research leads for the case. He needed to talk through the details and come up with a plan. What answers did he expect to get from Mrs. Ayers tomorrow? Damn, I  don't have my skull. He had a thought- his mouth forming a half-smile as he began searching the local hotels.
John just shook his head, stuffing his mobile in his pocket. He really did need to go to the shop, they had nothing for dinner and of course they always needed milk. He thought out a short list, and headed into the nearby market.
Don’t worry about it, John. Relax, get some sun. We present at 2 PM on Tuesday, we’ll be fine if we meet up for lunch right before, just to go over details. I’m fine to hang out with Karen.
"The driver is 4 minutes away, John. Where are your shoes? We should head downstairs now." The detective was practically vibrating with energy.
