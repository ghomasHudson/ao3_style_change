Jack had, of course, wasted little time in rescuing Cas from the Empty, as soon as Chuck had been defeated and his powers absorbed.
“Yes, but...please...come here.”
It was okay to finally breathe.
He looked forward to
Dean followed, his breath hitching as Cas then crouched down right where he remembered…
Dean typically loved being behind the wheel of his Baby. The power of her engine purring as the world sped by, that feeling of being in control of where he was going, how he got there... Not much in his life had ever been better. But now he was at that point of a long drive where the road had become his nemesis instead of his steady companion. It was past two a.m. and he’d been driving all day yesterday. He and Sam had only taken a few breaks to stretch their legs, refuel, and eat some greasy road food. He had four hours ahead of him before they made it to Tennessee and the ghost hunt waiting for them in some no-name, hick town.
Nothing. Nothing but ashes. No rift, no portal, no oozing darkness.
to work, Dean had reassured himself, and he did so again now on the eve of putting their plans into action. They could think of nor find any other options.
“Never, Cas. I swear.”
“I know, but somehow the reaper found you despite that. I know she was a reaper, not an angel, but that makes Zeke nervous.”
“So, what, we’re gonna bail on Kara?”
“Aren’t you tired, Castiel? Tired of all this? Tired of being such a pathetic love-sick puppy for a human who could never,
, this nearness, in a way Cas was still struggling to work out. Because he had never felt anything like it—not after millennia of instruction not to feel anything at all unless it was in glory to their father. But from the moment he had first held Dean’s soul in his grasp, ripped it free from the chains of Hell and touched it with an intimacy he’d never shared with a human...something in him had become corrupt
“What’s there to talk about?”
Fuck it; Dean wasn’t going to make it much longer, not at this rate, yet he did need a
Dean didn’t care. That was bad.
Cas moaned against Dean’s lips, nearly overwhelmed already. The wind kicked up around them, currents driven by the heat vortex they created. This was dangerous in so, so many ways. At this rate, if he didn’t rein himself in, Cas feared losing control in a manner that could turn destructive. Cas broke the kiss with much regret, looking into Dean’s ravenous, pleading gaze.
It’d be a show alright if Cas couldn’t contain himself. Already he sensed the air growing more charged, the whisper of the wind picking up into a stormy breeze. Dean’s hands were in his hair now, holding him in place for more kisses, hungry. Probing. Desperate. He sucked on Cas’s bottom lip, grazed it with teeth and Cas let him do whatever he wished. Despite his worries for their safety, he was curious. He was learning.
“Jack! How did you…?” Dean had asked that day, so thankful yet in a complete state of shock. He’d held tight to Cas’s hand after an intense reunion hug that had only been interrupted when Dean spied the young God waving and smiling at them.
Dean paused, only to make sure Cas was one hundred percent focused on his words, his intent. As if that were ever in doubt; Cas’s eyes were on him as always with rapt attention, making Dean feel, for the moment, like the only person in the universe.
All he knew was that he felt unworthy of the allegiance and trust Dean put in him, after everything he had done. His betrayals, his lies...the way he had let power and pride, his own search for truth and purpose, cause so much pain to others.
ago. That it was a burn from being touched by your ‘true form’ or whatever.”
“Thanks,” Batman said. “Hey, what’s the costume, anyway? Columbo with wings?”
“Yes. I know this is...not anything you likely have expected.”
Gabriel hummed and said, “Least a dozen or so, motley crew for sure. I saw Samandriel, and Hannah…”
Dean slammed his palm over the sigil, his blood mixing with Cas’s as the air seemed to catch on fire and a sonic boom exploded in his ears. There was a piercing cry followed by a groan that sounded too much like it came from Cas. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and dared not look until the barn, once more, fell silent and the blinding light faded.
“What do you know about soulmates. Like, how they work and all that?”
“Oh, Dean…”
He saw a field of winged creatures laid to waste at his feet and for some reason, he felt a sickening sense of satisfaction.
About fifteen minutes later they left behind country backroads and got on I-84 West. Kara sounded relieved when Dean said her ghost problem should be a thing of the past, but he didn’t elaborate. He told her to contact Garth again in case she had any further trouble.
They sat, savoring each other’s presence and the radiance of love, until it felt like an eternity. It could be, Dean thought. He could stare into those eyes and feel Cas’s love like this forever. This could be his Heaven, right here.
cut away. I sense where my wings should be a-and—”
under his heavy, layered clothes.
“Works for me.” Dean dipped down for a kiss, slow and determined, pouring love into his every touch just as it came flooding back at him from Cas.
It had taken Dean some time, through his grief and confusion, to put two-and-two together. And when he did, he cursed himself that it had taken him so damn long. He’d been so consumed with the fight against Chuck and his sorrow these past months, and Sam had been no better. That, and the answer was so tied up in the events surrounding Mary’s death that he’d blocked out thinking about it entirely.
“I don’t believe anyone could come here and feel sadness any longer,” Cas said. “Wouldn’t you agree?”
...almost. His hands felt a certain resistance and electricity in the air as they passed over where he could see those wings. And Cas gasped and arched into that almost-touch, looking at Dean then with surprise. “Dean, that…”
Dean had seen it at last. Of course. Cas could picture it in his head. Earlier that day, when April had stabbed him. He hadn’t even thought about it with everything else that had happened in those frantic few minutes. Everything had gone dark around him and when he came to, Dean was hovering over him, his shirt open and abdomen exposed.
He thought of mentioning they could go to the police, but she always gave him reasons why that might not be a good idea. And if his past was so dark, so full of nightmarish creatures and tragedies, maybe she was right.
“Sacrifices must be made, Sammy.”
and that felt like it came out of nowhere. In truth, he knew it had actually been in the making for
“Then I will begin by telling you something.”
Yes, it definitely was.
Dean looked at his brother and said, “If it’s alright with you, I’ll stay with Cas tonight. Get him cleaned up, make sure he’s good.”
For if he let himself drift away and allowed sleep to come, dreams awaited on the other side. Terrible dreams. Oh, they beckoned to him with sweet promises at first—to feel solid ground beneath his feet once more. To hear the celestial songs of his siblings in Heaven in happier, much earlier times, when his true form was full of power and divinity.
“Oh, please.” Dean drew in a hissing breath and then moaned, such a beautiful sound of need and longing. Cas kept his hand busy as he pulled Dean closer again for another kiss. He could feel the heat rising between them, sweat starting to bead on Dean’s skin...maybe even a little on his own, too.
Because out of nowhere, Cas could feel it. He could
Charlie smirked. “You’re gonna be doing that
They walked on through the dreary woodlands, keeping up their guard, until darkness blanketed the forest. “We should stop here, and rest,” Cas said. Though he could still see with perfect clarity in the dark—and he assumed the vampire could as well—he knew Dean’s vision was limited. There were plenty of nocturnal creatures that came out to hunt after nightfall.
Dean should have stopped a while back when Sam suggested they find a motel for the night. But he’d been in his groove at the time, the adrenaline making him feel like he could power on and keep driving forever. The early morning hours had crept over him since and Sam was snoring away and stretched out over the backseat. Not even his favorite tunes on the cassette deck could hold Dean awake enough to be a safe driver. His eyelids had grown heavy and keeping his head upright had become a major struggle.
different recipes online when I went searching. Too many recipes.” Cas shook his head. “Recipes with long stories that confused me because they had nothing to do with the actual food preparation.
“I’ve missed you, too. Hey, Dean.”
“I…” Cas started, feeling somewhat hurt that Dean would reduce what had just happened between them to ‘fucking.’ Was that all it had meant to him? But there was a

get used to it,” Cas had reassured him.
“It’s not that I’m having doubts. It’s more…” Sam paused and Dean waited, impatient for his brother to spit it out. “Look, it’s just we need to be prepared if things go sideways. If the spell works but...not how we intended.”
And if not, perhaps they could at least provide some much needed distraction in this critical moment.

wings, man!” exclaimed a passing Batman. “Can I get a picture?”
“Hey, Cas? I hope you can hear me. I know I always say that, but...this time, it’s extra important. So please be listening to me.”
“You did what you did for love, didn’t you? You told us love mattered more than anything.”
Cas pulled back enough to lift his head, look at Dean with a slightly sad smile. His eyes were moist and all Dean ached for in that moment was to take away the pain he saw there. He brushed his fingers over Cas’s cheek and felt his body starting to react to their closeness, the way Cas looked at him with those intense blue eyes.
Cas held his blade out for Dean.
it, too. A calling from somewhere in the distance but that struck a note to resonate within his own wavelengths of energy. Yet it was still so distant it seemed like an entire universe away.
Then Cas could go back to serving his own penance here, for he deserved nothing more after all the chaos and destruction he had caused on Earth as well as in Heaven.
Together.
“As far as I know.”
Those hands, those big strong hands, that tingly touch. He shuddered to think of it and blurted out, “Just touch me, here,” he urged, grinding against Cas again. Then he untangled himself long enough to go to his nightstand again, grab the lube from the drawer and toss it to Cas. And then he laid back, gently stroking himself while he watched Cas figure out what he was asking for. He watched him pour some of that lube into his meaty palm and then curl in against Dean, nudging Dean’s dry hand away to replace it with his own.
Cas struggled to focus himself back down on smaller things, the details of survival. “What if Benny comes back?”
“Cas,
“But I’d be able to help people. That’s something I feel I need to do.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, this is just... It’s so much. After nothing, everything...
Dean had to interrupt this happy little angel convention by accusing, “And you all left Cas here face down in the dirt and unconscious after he pulled your asses out of Super Hell?”
Dean stood before him in the dark void, foot tapping and arms crossed in impatience.
“Nngh!”
content. Keep doing that and I may have to penetrate you to unconsciousness again.”
.” They fluttered as Dean tried to tease and feel them with his fingertips. But then they shrunk away, Cas dropping his eyes as if embarrassed. “They are useless. Ugly and broken now.”
“Sorry.”
“Not an accurate descriptor, considering he had no mother but was created solely by God. ‘Sadistic prick’ would be more precise.”
Dean stayed close at hand through it all and Cas was beyond grateful for that. He made Cas feel grounded, whether it was through a look and a smile, or a gentle hand on his shoulder. A soft caresses to his back as he walked by to grab another beer from the fridge. Dean acted as though it pained him to let go of the touch and it honestly
But then Dean’s senses returned to normal almost as fast as the strangeness had hit him. Dean blinked again, looked at Cas, and had a feeling he shouldn’t repeat what he’d just done.
And to remind myself how goddamned lucky I am that this wasn’t the end for you ’n me.”
Maybe. But he’d take the confusion as long as he had his angel here beside him.
“S’okay.” Dean reached up to rub the sleep out of his eyes. Bad idea, for now his face throbbed something fierce. He could tell he was puffy and bruised, swollen worse than he was last night. “What time is it? How long have I been out?”
That, and then Dean’s mouth wrapped around the head of his penis and he almost lost all control of himself. As it was, the lights in the room flickered and he groaned out
“Not until you finally have the opportunity to live.”

“I love you,” Dean murmured against Cas’s lips. The first time he’d allowed himself to say those words he’d been terrified to admit it. It was still their shared secret, as much as this ritual that went along with their intimacy. He
“From when I believed I could be God.”
Dean looked back at him, guilt and hope and nervousness all there in his eyes. Cas couldn’t help it; he needed a hug and felt Dean did, too. He reached out to pull Dean against him, resting his head against Dean’s shoulder.
This Dean, this man was

“Are you, Dean Winchester, finally asking me to stay?”
Dean sprinted the rest of the distance to the figure and fell onto his knees on the ground beside him. Fuck it, fuck fuck
He hoped Sam didn’t notice when he got himself in this state, though one of these days he was going to figure it out. Dean knew he would, if he didn’t get this situation under control or break free of these cravings entirely. He had no idea how he was going to explain himself when that day came.
“It’s nothing. But thank you, Dean. I apologize for being such a burden these days.”
“It also replenishes. Feeling and satisfying your passion...an angel thrives on the prayers of the devoted.”
“I lied.”
Dean’s heart swelled with a sense of pride and also happiness at seeing Cas so elated.
Cas’s truck engine fell silent, and for a moment all Dean heard was the rustle of the wind through the trees which were starting to bud with renewed life. Birds chattered and called overhead but Dean and Cas seemed to be the only people around for miles.
nice dick in there, the shorts already damp from pre-come.
Sam had, at first, given him a look of patience and sadness.
Around them people speaking many languages were posing, swapping for pictures against the dazzling backdrop. Dean looked to Cas, standing beside him in his familiar suit and tie (thankfully he’d zapped some shoes and better attire than their bedroom sweats on them, too) and grinning. “It feels

Cas’s old pickup and the hitched trailer were fully loaded, as was Baby's backseat. Dean hadn’t realized they’d have
He paused to picture Cas in his mind, the things he remembered and refused to forget. His blue eyes, so intense in color they had to be otherworldly. The way he’d stare at Dean with such single-minded concentration when they’d talk—which at first had been unnerving but with time Dean had accepted as Cas being, well,
“I know, me too.” Dean sighed and smiled at him. “It’s gross but it’s kinda good, too. ’Cause of why.”
“Dean, you don’t have to—”
he saw now for their future, with hope and optimism he’d never allowed himself in the past.
Dean’s eyes went wide, trying to take in the feast before him. “You made me chicken soup?”
“Love you.” Dean’s face was damp with sweat and tears. He cried out in torturous pleasure and from allowing himself this vulnerability he forbade before anyone else. “Fuck...fuck me, Cas. Love me.”
He turned the key to start up the car, turn on the radio. This car had a broken tape deck but he’d managed to find a semi-decent classic rock station that should stay in signal for at least another fifty miles. He cranked up the volume as David Lee Roth cried how he ain’t talkin’ bout love. Pulling out on the highway, he hoped the music would drown out his own thoughts for a while.

“I promise.”
“Sorry. I was so foolish. She had been very kind to me—up until then, at least. I didn’t know it was a trap. As you said, I have a great deal to learn about being human.”
Cas chuckled and Dean loved seeing his smile, one that reached all the way to his eyes. “There are still boxes to unpack in the kitchen. And we haven’t finished warding the house properly.”
. And a soulmate
Dean swallowed down that feeling and asked, “We could...do it again sometime, right?”
Dean put down the pie and six-pack and opened two bottles. He handed one to Cas, then got on top of the covers next to him. Cas passed the laptop over, and Dean scanned over some of the titles in the movie section Cas had been scrolling through.
Cas’s dark thoughts were mercifully interrupted by Dean stirring in his lap. He was tempted to put him back under with a soft touch of grace, force him to rest some more, but Dean was too quick in his awakening. In fact he bolted upright with a gasping breath, eyes wide and wild, darting about and with his hand reaching for his blade before he recognized Cas.
"Yes, Dean," said Castiel automatically. Of course, he did.
Sam smiled at Dean, highly amused.
The hand knotted in Castiel's hair slid to the back of his neck, gripping tightly. Castiel whimpered. He tried to reach his own cock but Dean squeezed his neck harder, leaning over Castiel to growl, "no," in his ear. His voice was much deeper, rougher, less human.
though he had
Castiel hesitated, he curled his toes on the wooden floor, feeling the grain beneath his feet. He could smell the smorgasbord of liquids soaked into the wood over the years: beer, blood, sweat. It was difficult not to get caught up in all of the different smells around him. Dean had taught him to stay in the moment and try to be more aware of what was happening around him, rather than getting drawn in by his nose. But Castiel loved scents. His favourite scent of all was Dean's. Dean was his alpha and he was perfect in every way.
A slow realisation dawned on Dean's face. "Cas, do you have a kink?"
this may be awkward for you," he warned.
"Y-you do?" asked Castiel.
Castiel almost stopped him. Almost. But Dean's hands slid underneath Castiel's pants, over his ass and. . .
"What?" said Dean
, Meg? You're gonna push this?" Dean growled.
"I doubt that, Dean," said Sam.
A high pitched scream behind them made Dean leap away from Castiel. He spun around, searching for the source, but calmed immediately when he saw a group of laughing kids playing in the sand.
Laughing, Dean said, "Yeah, your day! Come on, tell me something. Anything."
Dean rolled his eyes. "I'm saying I have one."
When he sagged back against Dean, exhausted, he realised Dean was licking his neck again, most likely to clear the blood.
"What the hell are faggots?" muttered Dean to Castiel as they watched the waitress leave and deposit the plates on the pensioners' table.
Castiel looked at him and didn't respond. Maybe he could sense Dean was trying to joke his way out of a serious conversation. It wasn't the first time he had done it.
stronger than betas and
Castiel kept his eyes down as he worked Dean undone. Dean touched his hair and stroked along his jaw. "Cas, look at me."
Something occurred to Dean then that he had never considered before. Castiel obviously wanted Dean. His pupils had dilated hugely at the swipe of Dean's tongue. And yet Castiel was refraining from doing anything because he wanted to... what? respect Dean? Whatever the reason, Castiel wasn't making a move unless Dean allowed it and it made Dean feel quite powerful. It was turning him on to think that an angel, with so much celestial power at his fingertips, had to wait for Dean's say-so before he could move. He started to think about all the other times in his life he had made Castiel do what he had wanted and wondered if it had been a more diluted version of this moment.
Daniel Wilson, aged eight, lay awake in bed one night, turning over an idea that had occurred to him. He picked up the figurine of Castiel on his bedside table, peered into the two blue blobs that substituted for the angel's eyes, and pondered. Supernatural was over; there were no more episodes. He could no longer seek out Dean, Sam and Castiel for advice. Daniel wasn't stupid. He knew it was just a television show, but still. . . He liked to think that Sam and Dean were out there somewhere in the world, ready to help if someone needed it.
Castiel considered him. "I can't show you your soul because your eyes wouldn't be able to perceive it, but I could give you an example of what I see. A metaphor."
because you said so," said Dean.
Castiel spotted him immediately. The open plan of the library allowed Castiel to see the door from where he stood at the counter. His heart leapt at the sight of Dean who
"Whatever," said Sam standing up.
- yeah," he finished
"She's my mum!"
"Hey," he whispered. "I know you're all sleeping. . . but you need to wake up. You see, there's a monster here and there's only me and I can't fight monsters 'cause I'm not strong enough. My uncle said that there isn't a monster, but I know there is, and I know you'll know too 'cause it's your job." He paused. "So, you need to come here and get him." Daniel's brows scrunched up. Speeches weren't something he often had to do. He considered what he had said and then added, "please," because his mum had brought him up right.
"You got me," Dean whispered. "Last I knew we were kicking it back in heaven with mom and dad." Dean shifted his weight from one foot to the other, hyper aware that Castiel was standing close enough to touch.
Dean sighed. "Cas, it's more than that -"
At his words, something occurred to Dean. Clearing his throat, he said, "Have you ever been with a guy before?"
"I've been thinking," said Sam. "For the wheel to turn back into a wheel the kid needs to stop wanting to play with it. What if, more than anything, Jimmy liked to play with his food."
The strong smell of whiskey and smoke met Castiel's nose as he walked through the door to the Roadhouse flanked by Sam and Bobby. He shifted smoothly from a charcoal black wolf to his 5'9" human form in seconds and slid on a pair of sweatpants that were thrown to him by Ellen Harvelle from behind the bar. As always, Castiel forgoed the shirt.
Dean chuckled. "Yeah, it's a wolf thing. I know it's not possible with humans but man I've never wanted anyone so bad before," he breathed.
There was a long pause.
The effect was immediate. Castiel choked back a sob as he came so hard he was shaking. The mixture of pain and pleasure exploded within him, tensing his entire body, tightening his muscles, curling his toes.
"No he doesn't," said Kay. "Tell him the truth. And solve the case. By the way, here's a hint - adults like toys too."
"Kissing you," said Castiel. "We can try it in your mind if you would prefer?"
"They're new in town if you wanted to know."
"Cas," Dean grabbed Castiel's hands and held them tight, staring at Castiel intently like it was something incredibly important that he was trying to explain and Castiel was missing it. "Cas, look at me, I love you, but I can't bite you until I know for sure you want to be with me."
"Dean," Castiel gasped. "You can. . . I want you to."
"Then what? Witches? Wizards? Is the kid freaking Harry Potter?"
Dean swallowed. He tried to speak. "It's..."
"Censored? You

they had the same rights as anyone else, but a lot of people didn't see it that way. Castiel knew it would take time for the bigotry to fade.
this now? I've never wanted to-to... I've never felt that way about Cas before."
"Oh!" said Sam.
"Why do I feel like I'm going round in circles here?" said Dean.
"He's not yours anymore," said Dean quietly.
Castiel sighed. "No."
"Hey, Ellen," said Sam.
"What?" said Castiel, aiming for casual but it came out breathless.
Castiel nodded. "Yes." He agreed and when he looked back at Dean, his expression morphed to concern. "What's wrong?"
Dean kissed and licked and bit Castiel's lips, turning Castiel around.
"With Cas," added Sam with a nod.
Daniel's uncle had given him a book about King Arthur and the Knights of Round Table. There had been some great adventures in there, but right at the end, King Arthur had died and this had upset Daniel. Thankfully, his uncle had told him that King Arthur and his knights weren't really dead. He had said they were just sleeping and would return if England was ever in jeopardy.
"I'd say the same to you," Dean drawled. "But I'd be lying. Let him go."
"Nothing. I just expected you to reiterate how straight you are," said Sam, holding back a laugh.
. Heat flared inside him. He dropped a hand to Castiel's waist and rucked up his shirt. Sliding his hand underneath, he stroked Castiel's skin which was warm and soft.
"Doing what?"
, Castiel lifted his head and glanced over at them. His heart leapt when one of the alphas looked right back at Castiel. It was him. It was his scent.
"What time are you here till, Cas?" said Jo, a pretty blonde omega in
. He tried to make sure his face and stance were casual as he heard Dean approach.
Castiel sighed, wondering when he would be able to return to his wolf form. He sipped his beer. The soft sweatpants he was wearing actually felt quite nice on his skin. He stroked a hand down the smooth fabric, getting lost in the sensation. He paused, however, when he caught the scent of something very familiar. Slowly, he lifted his eyes, searching in the direction the smell was emanating from. Across the room, a pair of dark eyes were surveying him over the rim of a glass. They were set in a pale face framed with dark hair.
"Dean," said Meg. Her voice was
"Your what?" said Dean.

"I'm not interested in dick!" snapped Dean.
"How about you check out the museum," said Dean. "I'm going to the beach!"
"Do I?" she said. Her lips were still upturned. She tilted her head to the side, exposing her neck. "Want a closer smell?"
Castiel gave Dean a small smile. He poked Dean's chest. "I imagined it was you."
Dean chuckled. "I'm joking," he said and pushed Castiel's chest but, unconsciously, his hand lingered. As he let it drop, he could feel Castiel's torso beneath his shirt.
Dean took a slight step back, letting his dick slide out. To Castiel's surprise, he could feel come sliding down the back of his leg. He hadn't even been aware Dean had come.
It was such strange behaviour that Dean didn't know what to do with himself. He felt queasy with the mixture of emotions swirling inside him.
"You're such a hero," he heard Meg say to Dean.

"You do though don't you?" Dean shifted uncomfortably. "I'm not gay, Cas," he said. He didn't know why it sounded so whiny, so pleading. Why did it sound pathetic to Dean's ears?
Dean didn't say anything. He didn't want to deny it in case Sam said Cas should go with him to the museum instead.
Sam chuckled. He was going through a box of fake IDs. "I haven't seen these in forever," said Sam, a wistful tone to his voice.
Feeling oddly excited, and jittery Dean laughed. "What?"
"What?" said Dean, startled.
"Your soul is... unique. Rare. It's not something I have ever experienced before."
. He had been right. Pulse was a success. It was full most nights with the kinds of people that Castiel detested.
Sam, oblivious to the exchange, turned in his seat. "There must be. We should probably look into the missing kid. . ." He trailed off, looking between Dean and Castiel. "So?"
a missing kid called James Green but no leads on what happened to him. Sean White is a teacher and he's got a flashy car - "
"Yeah, it's his," said Dean with a grin.
Castiel's brows pulled together. He peered about the room. He picked up what looked like an old plastic carton painted black with four bottle caps glued to the bottom. Despite the situation, Dean found himself beginning to smile.

"Dean, wait," said Sam.
"Sure," said Daniel. "Well, my mum had to speak to the headmaster because Mr White found out I'd been following him home."
Castiel could only stare in bewilderment. "I don't know."
Sam had called Dean to let him known he had managed to find a room in a bed and breakfast not too far from the sea. The view wasn't magnificent. Dean couldn't see a great deal because of the scaffolding on a building across the road. There were construction workers milling about and cars trundling down below, bumping over potholes. A chorus of seagulls cried overhead and Dean could smell salty sea air drifting in from the open window.
"Who knew Dean was so romantic?" said Ellen with a chuckle. There was a pause and then. "He's got to be careful though hasn't he? Because if another pack targets Castiel..."
Castiel sensed the two alphas cross the room and settle themselves at a table in the corner, not far from the bar.
. "She wants to know what your response is, I guess."
The kid had introduced himself as Daniel Wilson. He lived with his mom, Sarah Wilson, and his pet budgie, Marty McFly. He had shown Dean a picture of a man named Sean White, Daniel's teacher, who just so happened to be a monster. His reason for thinking it? Taking candy when he was offered it.
love with him. What did Kay want from Dean? Was he supposed to fake it? Was he supposed to lie to Castiel so Kay could have the sequel she wanted? Even if Dean was ok with lying to Castiel and telling him he loved him when he didn't, he's not sure it was something he could say. Dean didn't tell people that he loved them. It was difficult for him to say it. He had always found it hard. He didn't particularly know why that was, only that his throat seemed to clench up when he even thought of the words.
. Was he dangerous? wondered Castiel.
. His skin was shiny where Castiel's lips and tongue had slid. Having known Castiel for so long, seeing him now, sucking
"Oh," said Dean.
Dean's teeth went deep, the pain in his shoulder was almost unbearable. It reached a peak and
Dean kissed his jaw, his neck and his shoulder. Dean's kisses grew
He stared at the side of Dean's face wondering if he would be so lucky tonight. Dean caught him looking and smiled. He kissed Castiel again, who responded eagerly, slipping his tongue into his mouth, his hand sliding up Dean's chest. Dean pulled back chuckling, "I think I can guess what's on your mind, Cas."
. Her smile was all teeth which gave her a predatory air.
"To look into this case," said Sam. He waved Daniel's folder. "You two need to talk."
"Yeah but. . . it's
Castiel moved over to Dean, he kissed him softly, looking at his face, looking for answers.
"That's better. Thanks, Ellen," said Dean, grabbing the clothes she handed to him. He nipped Castiel's neck and released him long enough to get dressed.
"You've got your angel mojo?" asked Dean.
The scent that hit Castiel was incredible. His hand dropped to the counter for support. His breath caught. He had never smelled anything so perfect in his life. He wished he could fill his lungs with it. Drown in it. It
"Cas, I -" Dean was about to object and immediately reject the offer but then, it wouldn't be real, would it? It would be in his mind, in a place away from the world and prying eyes. Kay wouldn't see it. It would only be Castiel and Dean. He could try it and if he didn't like it, he could just wake up. It was no big deal because it wasn't real. "I don't know," he said then, suddenly, the word tumbled out of his mouth,"Yes."
"Do you like him, Dean?" she asked
"Um, are you sure - " began Dean.
"I'm sorry did you have a prior engagement? The kid has a case."
Her smile slipped off her face as quickly as a light going out.
"No," said Sam. "
Castiel's whole body shook, his knees going weak. "You can bite me," said Castiel in a rush.
of anything real for a long time. But he supposed that was the point, wasn't it? The point of life was to experience it, and heaven was there to help it linger, to fall into a hypnotic sleep with those you loved most.
“Please don’t tell me I can’t drive her ever again…”
“No, that was Sam and Eileen.” Dean’s eyebrow shot up as his attention was wrenched from pancakes, a playful smile on his face.
“No. It’s your birthday, you let people do things for you on your birthday.” Dean raises an eyebrow at Sam as the tray is set on the bed, 2 steaming cups of coffee and a pile of pancakes with bacon waiting to be enjoyed.
“Okay Cas, let’s go home. Then you need to tell me everything - and I mean
“Dean?”
to Eileen as she rolled her eyes and smiled.
Dean shakes his head at Castiel’s confusion, moving forward to ruffle the fur on the top of his head.
“Now. I think the warehouse is probably our best bet for any answers, so that's where I'm gonna go look. Up to you whether you come or no-”
“Did you say you think they either came in or left through the window?” Sam nudged the curtain to one side, making a note of the green that was dusted on the ledge, turning back to Castiel.
“Uh, yeah. All good?” Castiel nodded, smiling as he sat next to Dean again, ignoring the blush that crossed his cheeks as their thighs touched. Dean looked at his hands for a few seconds before looking back towards Castiel, one hand gravitating again to the back of his neck as he struggled to find words.
"Okay. Always been a Familiar. Um… Can you do any magic yourself, or…? Y'know - just there to boost it for a witch?"
“You…” Castiel clears his throat, looking apologetic before Dean gestures for him to continue. “You asked me after your birthday when mine was. Obviously, being as old as I am, it effectively pre-dates time itself, so I wasn’t sure how to answer then. But… I think I know now. Or at least I’ve chosen one.”
Dean groaned, his arm moving from his torso to over his eyes again; Castiel using the distraction to lie on Dean completely, letting out another huff of laughter as noises of protest escaped the Empath.
“I’d suggest making a start on getting back to the Bunker now. Once Dean gets the hang of this, it’s
“You decide.” Her hands don’t leave her pockets as she stands, glaring at Dean and Castiel one more time before turning away. “I’m sure you’ll make the right decision. You seem like a smart boy.” Dean stares daggers in to her retreating figure, grip on Castiel tightening again as he whines, trembling starting again as soon as she disappears in to the treeline.
” He slid next to the Empath, ignoring the sting of splinters in his knees as he placed a hand on Dean’s arm to move him closer. The flames burnt through clothing until Castiel had skin contact, not realising until Dean let out a small gasp. His eyes slowly flickered open before quickly closing again, bringing his other arm to cover them.
“... Shut up.” The words fall on deaf ears as Sam climbs into the driver’s seat, the rumble of the Impala drowning out any other choice words Dean throws Sam’s way as he pulls away back onto the road. Dean watches as they disappear into the distance, ignoring the way his wings quiver as realisation begins to hit him the further away Sam gets that there really is no escaping learning how to fly now. He jumps as Castiel rests a hand on his shoulder, motioning to follow him as he wanders towards the treeline just ahead of them.
“No-one is gonna lose him. Especially not us, okay? We're gonna go in that damn warehouse and drag his stupid ass out of there.” Castiel chuckled, knowing that Sam was unlikely to let Dean live down that he had been the damsel in distress.  Sam smiled, turning back to the Impala and opening the trunk, grabbing his gun and spare bullets before taking a deep breath in.
. Someone tried to set them on
“... What if I don’t want to?” Dean smiled, pulling Castiel closer as the angel made an undignified yelp at the movement. His smile only got wider as he pressed a gentle kiss to Castiel’s lips, cutting off the noise as it was replaced with a content hum from the angel.
The worried look morphed to concentration, Castiel letting out an amused huff at the way the Empath’s face scrunched up.
Dean’s wings flare out as he turns to the remainder of the coven, his eyes never leaving his brother as grace crackles under his skin. “You let him go,
“Yes. I told you it was nothing special, I’m just a man.” Castiel looked at his lap, not noticing the way Dean gave him a quick once over.
“Dammit...” He let his head fall back, almost resigning himself to being stuck there, wondering how long it was going to take for Castiel to find him. The thought of Castiel set off an idea in his head, and Dean cursed himself for not thinking of it sooner. He closed his eyes, willing himself to calm down enough to concentrate on nothing but the angel, taking a deep breath as he attempted to experiment with his grace. The image of Castiel soon took centre stage in his mind, and Dean smiled. This was going to work.
“Ah, Cas...!” The slow movement of Castiel's fingers was driving Dean crazy, wings flapping erratically as the pleasure almost became too much. An empty feeling suddenly filled him as fingers were removed, and Dean opened his eyes to find Castiel looking at him hungrily. The bright blue was hardly visible in the angel's eyes, pupils blown so wide with lust that it sent any excess blood Dean had south.
.” Dean twirls the blade in his hand as if it’s the most natural thing in the world, a comforting weight to him as if he’d always had one. The grace is still prominent in his eyes, anger bubbling just under the surface despite his otherwise calm demeanour. Castiel is almost a mirror of him, wings in a defensive position as they cross the threshold of the room where the fire merrily burns away. Sam pauses as he takes in the room; the fire burns a line directly through the middle, witches grinning on the other side of it as he realises that the strange smell in the room is oil. Dean and Castiel don’t seem to notice as they stalk closer to the fire, to the witches who are all but beckoning them towards what they know is certain death for the pair.
Uh… Maybe somewhere large, open… Somewhere you can still keep an eye on me.” Castiel shudders, the memory of Naomi finding him again sending shivers down his spine. “I don’t want a repeat of last time.”
“No! You’re coming back… And I am going to find a way to tap in to your magic, family or not.” The calm demeanor slips from her face as Castiel sits down, keeping one paw on Dean’s leg as he lets out a defeated huff.
“Jack had a whole reform of the place, made it more open so people weren’t just stuck in memories. Suits me a whole lot better than being stuck… But Jack didn’t do it alone.”
"I apologise... My wings are not used to physical contact. The colour seems to put other angels off..."
“... Really?” Raised eyebrows was his only response again, Dean letting out a deflated laugh. “You’re still a stubborn bastard, you know that?”
“No... No, no no no...” The panic crept in to his voice, wings still trying to move away from the blade. The witch placed one finger over Dean's lips, cold and clammy like the last witch had been.
“Hey Cas.” Dean held up the slice still in his hand, motioning to it with his head as he smiled. “Pizza?” Castiel shook his head, dropping it again to the nape of the hunter’s neck before placing an open mouthed kiss there, sucking gently - Dean gasped as his own head dropped, hand going lax as the pizza dropped to the floor, the TV now forgotten. The gasp changed to a grunt as Castiel’s hand gripped Dean’s chin, forcing his head back up as Castiel adjusted just enough to place a kiss on the hunter’s lips. A blush crossed Dean’s cheeks as the angel pulled away, chasing after him for more with a whine. Castiel chuckled, shifting again as he released Dean’s jaw, allowing the hunter a little bit more movement to chase for another kiss. He chuckled again as he leant down to meet Dean halfway, relishing in the small noises that escaped, smiling further at the moan as Castiel slipped his tongue past Dean’s lips. He rolled his hips, moving so he was flush against Dean’s bare behind, laughing as the hunter gasped and dropped his head again, rolling his hips one more time for good measure.
“What happened?”
“Here- What?”
“We really need to figure out a way for us to talk, ‘cause this one sided stuff is getting a little old now.” Castiel lifted his head off his paws, rolling his eyes at Dean’s suggestion. If Dean had any magic, talking would be easy - the distinct lack of it made it almost impossible, and Castiel huffed. Of all the people that could have found him, of course it had been someone who he couldn’t communicate with. He huffed again, setting his head back on his paws as Dean looked on in confusion.
“I don’t think so?” He patted himself down, Castiel letting out a huff of amusement before resting his head on Dean’s legs. “Only thing I can think of is I feel more awake, maybe? I don’t know.”
"Why are you apologising? You're allowed to be happy." He huffed, head back on his paws. "What? You are!" Castiel rolled his eyes again, closing them in contentment as Dean continued to run his hand through his fur. He shook his head in disbelief, laughing to himself at Castiel’s antics.
“You want to talk? Tough. We want you
“Just undignified… Being folded up in the back like this…” Dean’s muttering earns another snigger from Sam as he sits behind the wheel, patiently waiting for Dean to get mostly comfortable before starting up the Impala. “Drive like an asshole Sammy, and I will smite you.”
“I mean, you can check his collar if you want… But this definitely isn’t your dog.”
“Okay. Let's figure out what's changed.” He motioned to Castiel to follow him as he crept towards the warehouse, the exterior giving away no clues whatsoever. Castiel rolled his shoulders, letting his angel blade fall from where it was stored in to his hand as he followed the hunter, hoping that the witches hadn't laid a finger on Dean.
“I’ve said I was sorry for that now, surely?”
“Wait. You- You’re keeping them?”
etched across the surface of the metal, throwing it down as though it burns as she turns her sneer directly to Dean’s face.
“Nothing! Just… Didn’t know what to expect when you finally shifted back.”
and it killed me inside knowing that there was no way I could say it back and-” The rest of the sentence dies in Dean’s throat as tears spill freely down his face, hand bunching in to Castiel’s suit jacket tightly as he uses the grip to ground himself. He can feel other tears too, briefly glancing up to notice them also freely falling from Castiel’s eyes; the smile on his face is something Dean will forever commit to memory.
The rage in her voice rooted him to the spot. He quivered where he stood, staring at the mug, almost willing it to pick itself up and put itself back together before it was seen. The fear of consequences overrode the need to pick them up, still staring at them in despair when Naomi found him moments later; the loud, shouting rage replaced with a cold, calm one that made Castiel's stomach drop. She took one look at the broken mug and Castiel in his shifted form and sighed, putting her hands in her pockets.
“Whatever. She was here, I could feel her… She-” Dean didn’t notice Castiel stand, placing a hand on his arm where he had accidentally burnt through his jacket.
------------------------------------------------------------
Dean’s sure if Castiel was in his human form that he would definitely have a shit-eating grin on his face, shaking his head as a smile settles on his own face.
“You can let go now, Dean. I think you’ve got it.”
“Dude, you’ve never been carsick.
“Hmmm? What’s
“Yeah, but if I had magic…” Dean sighed, wiping at his eyes again before setting his hands on Castiel’s fur. “If I had magic you wouldn’t have had to deal with the smell of that poultice for a start. And you’d not still be here waiting for everything to heal.”
Cas really wasn’t looking forward to that. But perhaps the pain and risk would be worth it to know for sure. If they could find an angel he could trust. “It...does make sense, in a way. Maybe you’re right, Dean.” It would explain so much. Yet it also set his human mind reeling. He felt dizzy at the realization and had to sit down on the edge of Dean’s bed.
For there was Dean’s wardrobe and more importantly his record collection. There were more than a few books and artifacts from the archive Cas didn’t care to leave behind and potentially in others’ hands. There were also cookware items of which Dean had grown fond, and certain electronics and “manly comforts” he’d acquired for his precious Dean Cave. No point in having to replace that which was good enough, simply because they were starting on a new chapter in their lives.
“Mm.” The others who’d come back didn’t seem as affected by their time—much
“Neither do I. Not entirely,” Cas said, his voice almost back to normal. “It seems my blood allows you some perception through the veil between human comprehension and my true form.”
recipes.”
his vessel’s appearance fueling his desire. The more years Cas had spent in it, making it his own? The more time they’d spent together? Had led Dean to accept it was the being
...where he had once kneeled, said a final prayer, and opened the box of ashes to scatter on the ground and into the wind.
“Well, can’t say I’ll be shedding too many tears over that one.” Bobby wandered into the living room as Dean shut off the television set, beer already in hand despite it being only ten a.m.
“...Because angels don’t have souls. I remember.” He had asked Cas about it in one of their first conversations. The angel had dismissed the possibility outright, and yeah. At the time it had been a huge relief to Dean. His soulmate, an angel? In a man’s stolen body? That
Fuck, as if he was going to say no to the invitation to bed down Cas now that it was finally out in the open. He seized the angel’s hand and pulled him out of the bathroom, toward one of the two beds. Cas sat at the foot of it, gazing up at Dean who quickly ripped off his flannel shirt and henley. Before undressing further he leaned down to kiss Cas again, on the mouth, then his forehead, over that bloody cut. It was no longer weeping but there was enough blood still there that Dean got another taste. He kissed and licked away all that he could, even sucking at his fingertips which had grown red from stroking and caressing Cas’s face and neck. When he pulled away Cas appeared all aglow once more, strange halos circling around him in a way that made no proper spatial sense to Dean. His wings flared out and then settled against the mattress, falling over both sides as if echoing his sighs.
To bring Cas back.
! And Sam’s been through his shit, too. But you’re one of us and that means we look after each other. It’s not about usefulness. It’s about being
“If you say so. I must admit, your signature upon this one’s body is an...interesting artistic choice.”
Dean hoped Baby would forgive him for slamming the breaks so hard he almost flew out of his seat. He stared, gaping open-mouthed at the angel sitting placidly in the passenger seat. Then he cursed, “Son of a
Cas bit his lip. It was hard to stay awake, but he’d heard Dean say it was important, to not sleep again until he next called upon him.
...we got enough mojo here between the three of us to make it work. So I want you to...I don’t know...next time you hear me? The next time I’m praying to you, trying to reach you? I need you to be ready, too. Ready to fight or run or whatever you have to do. If you see anything, any sign or
“Who the hell are you and what do you want with our friend?” Dean demanded.
“Um...” Cas bit his lip. “All right. Let me put away the soup, and I’ll be right back.”
“Okay.”
“You know, the more you insist on plaguing me and the rest of my domain with consciousness, the more I’ll curse you with even worse dreams of regret than the last time. What should I draw forth from your greatest hits next time, hmmm?” It paused before him, grinning a malicious grin. “Let’s see, which was more painful: hearing your brothers and sisters in Heaven condemn you for becoming Lucifer’s vessel? Proclaiming you no better than he? Or...oh! Better still! When Nick reminded you that you are nothing but a loathsome body-snatcher yourself. That
“What can I do for you, Dean? Tell me.”
“Happily, yes. You taste like sunshine to me, Dean. The light bursting through the clouds after a passing storm.”
Home was too far away for one night’s drive, much to Dean’s dismay. Cas needed attention better than they could provide in the back seat of the Impala—or even at Kara’s house, as innocent as she might be in what had happened.
it. But I still...something in me tells me he’s out there somewhere. And when he comes back to us, he’s gonna need that coat.”
But there was that handprint. Emmanuel knew, somehow, that it belonged to him. They must have met before, in this life that he could not remember except in fragments. His life before Daphne had rescued him, cold and wet and naked along the riverbank.
Cas was right behind him.
So vulnerable. So human.
From Dean.
“Yes.” Those were words and confessions burned deep into Cas’s memory. Confessions that had helped keep him going, sustained his grace as much as they’d torn at him. They’d let him know Dean was still out there. Fighting, struggling, but still alive.
“I’d like to come,” Cas chimed in, taking a seat at the map table.
“Dean?”
“I’m counting on it.” They shared another kiss, but then Cas paused, looking thoughtful. “I’d like to test a theory.”
A body he still struggled, sometimes, to feel at home in, to understand as more than a vessel for an angel but still less than human. It responded to these caresses in a very human way, but still detached in a sense, above and beyond it. Dean’s kisses tasted of molecules but also of Dean’s
Dean could kick himself for having said that, after they first hit a small snag, and then a much bigger one not long thereafter.
“Yeah, probably. I don’t care. I have you.”
Cas thought back on some of those days. The time when Dean had broken down laughing in an alleyway behind a brothel, saying he hadn’t laughed like that in a long time. Cas hadn’t understood why what had happened to him was so funny, but something in Dean’s carefree laughter? The way he smiled at Cas and treated him like...a human friend? That was probably the night Cas had realized his feelings for Dean were evolving into something new and unknown to him. Something more than Heavenly reverence for the Righteous Man.
Dean shrugged. “Like I said when I prayed to you...I felt like Hell.
But Dean yearned to be filled in another way, too. The thick length of Cas’s cock pressed into his abdomen, brushing against his own erection and he ached for it.
Heaviness settled over him, a warm and soothing sensation of peace, contentment, and love. In his mind’s eye, he saw a vision of what he hoped for, in the future: having Cas with him like this, always. His angel, safe and keeping him safe, both a little scarred and shattered but somehow complete when they had each other. When they
Dean slumped against Cas, dazed in the afterglow. It was hard for a moment to believe this was real. “Am
He thought he should feel awkward. This was
“We’re soulmates, right? Least I can do for you.”
Sam stood up and sighed. “Whatever, Dean. No matter
“Doubt it.”
There was a shyness in the way Cas dropped his eyes again that made Dean’s heart beat faster. “Does that mean you want me to do it again?”
“We’re gonna chill out and watch some Netflix. You want to join in? We could move to your room, watch on the tv instead of my laptop.”
Such a small thing. Such a tiny, human gesture of affection. And yet it made Cas want to sing out to his angelic brothers and sisters, loud enough to shake the Heavens with his discovery.
He hadn’t even wanted to take the case with all they had going on, but Sam had insisted on it. He’d said an “easy win”, an old-fashioned salt-and-burn, would be good for them.
“What do you—
Dean shrugged. “Just wondering. Maybe hoping to know if Sammy had one. You know, for in the future if we get out of this mess. Our parents were soulmates.” He remembered how his father used to always caress the handprint mom had left on his right forearm. How many times he’d told the story of reaching for her when he saw her about to trip on the sidewalk.
He clung to it against the overwhelming, oppressive nothingness and the lure of sleep as its only escape. In the Empty, even his vessel was little more than a construct of his consciousness, a focal point to reassure himself of his identity.
Cas nodded at him. “I think it always has been. For me at least.”
None of these elements were essential parts of the supposed angel resurrection spell. But magic could be as much about focusing and powering intent as it was about following some ancient, explicit instructions. At least that’s what Rowena had explained to Sam when he called upon her for help (and when she’d provided the spell with the caveat Sam be her date for Hell’s annual Red Party if it worked).
“Hey.”
Cas pulled away only enough to drop his right arm to his side. His angel blade slid down from under his shirt sleeve and into his hand, glinting, dangerous, and deadly. That always weirded Dean out. Cas had once explained that the blade was not a discrete weapon but a manifestation of his true form. A literal
“All right? Christ, Cas, that was...I don’t know
Dean.
Cas was doing better, day by day. There were still times, random moments, when he would seem to freeze up or drift away to someplace else. Dean would see a shadow falling over him, as if he was once more doubting if this was real or another tormenting dream of the Empty. When that happened Dean would go to him and say his name, touch his arm, try to provide grounding and a reminder of where they were. It usually was enough to quickly bring him back.
Here Dean’s soul could breathe out and expand to match the vastness of his angelic beloved. His hands could stretch to match the span of Cas’s majestic wings as they soared through solar flares and comet tails. Cas’s arms would stay clasped around his waist, holding him so tight they almost absorbed him. He could turn and see Cas’s face but also the face of a lion, a dragon, an eagle, creatures he could not even name. One would shift into the next but all possessed the same expression of love and joy in his eyes.
“...Dean?”
Dean buried his head into Cas’s neck, not sure exactly what he was feeling at that moment except that it was something between relief and extreme embarrassment. But Cas chased his worries away by continuing, “If not for your prayers, your voice...I believe I would have been lost to the dreaming forever. The Empty, it...tried its best to keep me under this time. It did not want to let go, it kept threatening to drown me in ever worsening regrets.
And look at what
More words, noises, and incoherent sobs fell from his lips as Cas took him, torturously slow at first. His control was maddening to Dean, who just wanted to be fucked out of his head. But instead Cas would pull out until Dean ached from the loss, then push in deliberately, over and over, steady as a machine. Dean was begging for relief, for mercy, his nerves raw as every thrust brought him closer to the edge of rapture but never quite sending him over the brink.
These questions were not for Castiel to answer. Not yet, if ever. He was simply the soldier meant to collect the Winchester’s soul and return it to Earth. As far as he knew, others would take care of the rest. They needed to get out of Hell before Castiel could call this mission a success, and he’d prefer to do it without the human’s whining distractions.
Cas nodded. “You do love cowboys.”
“Of course. Dean, you know I always appreciate our talks, our time together.” Somehow those words left Dean looking even more pained, much to Cas’s confusion.
Dean gasped.
Cas nodded. “Then I’m quite happy to simply lay here with you tonight.”
Dean clutched at the hand grasping his own and pulled it to his lips for one more kiss. “Thanks, Cas.”
His grip on the blade tight, Dean focused on the underside of Cas’s right forearm laid out for him like an offering. Dean pressed the tip there, and dragged it down with only as much pressure as he knew was necessary to break skin. He hated this part, because he knew it hurt. Cas tried to hold it in but a small noise escaped his lips, just as the blood and a tiny wisp of blue grace seeped from the wound.
“Well, well, well. If it isn’t my favorite little birdie with clipped wings causing me
Cas shrugged. “Maybe this place has better grounding for me. I don’t know.”
letting Castiel here see me rip you both apart, limb by limb. And that’s before I take my time finishing
“Your what?”
He walked along in the growing morning light, eyes stinging but he refused to let the tears come. Not yet. He ached and felt so bone-weary. So
His eyes remained heavy, too. He drove on in silence for a while, Cas saying nothing, either, as Warren Zevon crooned on Baby’s stereo.
The pain that wracked his body told him that was an
“Bastard.”
“Yes, yes, I do. I may have said it in my prayers, but I should have said it long ago, and I need to say it now. Face-to-face. You stopped me once before from saying it,” Dean reflected, thinking on their return trip to Purgatory not that long ago. “But now, no one’s gonna drag you away for being happy again. Not unless they drag me right along with you.”
he felt and heard one final time before the bright, golden fire consumed him.
Awake, he could fight against these things. He could remember
“When my grace is low, my senses are closer to a human’s. But even when not, I can feel your energy, your soul...in everything you do.” Cas’s fingers trailed down Dean’s body, and Dean could swear he felt that grace rippling out from them. “It’s about far more than this physical realm.”
But then he’d looked at Jack, frowning and wondering aloud,
Dean, after all that Sam had gone through with Lucifer, how could you?”
“Yeah.” Dean grabbed their first aid kit—not that he knew what in it could help with angel wounds—and his overnight bag out of the trunk. Cas was trying to get out of the car on his own and had to lean on the door after standing up, losing his balance.
Her home. Her bed.
that was, but it was...wow.”
“That makes you less safe.”
“Mm. Later we will do this with no clothes in the way.”
He’d taken a cold shower to wash away the sweat, quell the heat building inside. That had only made his condition worse. Alone, under the spray of the water, touching his own skin? He’d become more acutely aware of what he ached to possess—to experience—once again. His hand and active imagination could only provide so much satisfaction.
There was only one place for him to go.
Cas frowned. “This isn’t like you, Dean.”
Cas, familiar with Dean as he was, didn’t bother to argue. “Well then, we should be in Colorado Springs in approximately six hours. There doesn’t appear to be any accidents or traffic jams along the route yet, but if something comes up...”
Fuck. How could Dean
in their power to find you.”
“Go on.”
“That sounds very nice.” Cas let Dean pull him down into a gentle spooning embrace, Dean’s arms wrapping around his angel’s waist. Dean realized his one hand was resting over that mark, on Cas’s stomach. And Cas reached back to place a hand on his shoulder.
“Cas?” Dean could tell from his eyes and his expression that he was holding back on saying something. Maybe his talking so much about the goddamned soup had been because he couldn’t say what was really on his mind. “What is it?”
was lying there at the foot of the boulder, crushing down the surrounding hay. The figure was face-down in the dirt like a dead body.
Cas hung back for a moment, battling indecision. The urge was strong to vanish, to flee as he had done previously. To disappear while the others’ backs were turned, because staying close to Dean was to put him at far greater risk than he was already.
Cas came back, wingless and human or super-powered,
With Cas’s love.
“I mean, maybe your soul was always there, waiting to...I don’t know, be activated or whatever once you became human.” Dean paused, then added, “You sleep now, right?”
“Just wait. ’Cause it’s gonna get so much better.”
“Yeah, no.”
Sam. Shit, he wondered if Sam had heard him screaming and moaning through these thin motel walls. The drive tomorrow could sure be interesting if that were the case.
“No. I remember little of that entire ordeal.” In truth, he tried not to poke at his memories of it, lest the horror consume him as the Leviathans had. “But it’s clear these people remember and I will only hinder your hunt by sticking around. I’m sorry, Dean.”
“No, my bad sneaking up on you. Good reflexes, though.”
“As long as my English is enough for you.”
Dean went to straighten the bedsheets, looking uncomfortable. “It’s bad, I know. I haven’t even been in here the past few days except to grab clean clothes. Sam had us all doing purification diets and rituals to get ready for the spell this morning. I shoulda cleaned up in here as part of it, but...I couldn’t face it.” Sheepishly, Dean looked up and added, “I slept in your room the last few nights. Wasn’t the first time since you’ve been gone.”
Fortunately, Cas continued before Dean had to spend much more time contemplating that terrible moment. “But don’t you know, Dean? I never blamed you for that. The Mark wanted you to kill me, but you—
After all, he was doing it
And with it, he began to sing.
Cas knew how Dean was feeling because somehow, despite how deep he’d been sealed away in this place, he could still hear Dean’s prayers. They woke him when he slipped into dreams and fell too deep into his sorrows. They gave him something to listen for, to expect, when he struggled to stay awake, when his mantra failed to provide necessary focus.
Dean Winchester was his downfall, but also his salvation. Oddly, for the first time since he had realized the mistake he’d made in absorbing the souls of Purgatory, Cas felt...some glimmer of hope. Some sense that he could be redeemed, that he was worthy. If this man—the righteous man—could look at him the way Dean had, could wish to share this communion of body and spirit, mundane and divine? Then perhaps he could rise up on his wings once again, with pride instead of shame.
Only Dean appeared troubled. Where minutes ago he’d seemed as excited as Cas was to be home and safe, now he looked like some new calamity had already come crashing down on them. “Cas, uh, can we talk?”
Not-Dean’s grin turned wider. Far too wide. In one of the most horrible sights Cas had ever been forced to witness, that face split open like a Leviathan’s, lunging for Cas with far too many teeth.
Dean looked around and before he could ask, Cas answered, “Benny went on patrol. I don’t sense anything nearby, but he wanted to make sure we would be safe for a little while.”
“Son of a
“Right,” Dean answered, and if his face was flushed red it wasn’t out of embarrassment.
“I know.” Cas sighed. “I should have sensed the presence of an angel early on. Wasn’t even thinking it was a possibility. He must have been using some kind of personal warding so I wouldn’t notice his proximity, much as I have done for myself. Still, I had no idea until he called and claimed he had you both...which ended up being a lie to capture me instead.”
“Jack got me out. The Empty was pleased enough to have Billie after all her scheming and...well, it really does find me annoying.”
Dean swallowed and closed his eyes, wanting to forget about that day. “Yeah, that might turn a guy off sex forever.”
Sleep eluded Emmanuel, as it always did. Her never slept. He pretended, for her sake, because he knew it was something normal people did. Normal humans.
Dean blinked. “Huh?”
Always time, in this place where time didn’t exist. But they did. They always would. And that was more than enough for Dean.
“Dean—” he tried to protest again. But Dean only shook his head, put his hand over Cas’s mouth to stop him.
cared. Maybe too much. You haven’t always done the right thing but your actions were always driven by emotions and caring. You’re not like those other dick angels who only cared about fulfilling their duties to a God who doesn’t even seem to give a crap about them any longer. Or only cared about getting their jollies like Balthazar, or Gabriel. Whether you always had a soul, I can damn well guarantee you have one now. If you don’t believe me, we’ll find an angel to do that soul-fisting thing you’ve done before, like to check on Sam.”
,” he said again, this time with wonder and understanding.
Forever sounded good. “I will be here.”
“I’m afraid this is a subject I know very little about.”
Cas smiled. “I appreciate it. Thank you again, Dean.” To have at least one night where he wouldn’t have to sleep alone—one night here with Dean—was a true gift after everything he’d gone through of late.
Dean spit in his hand, several times, then went back to stroking Cas, trying to get him as slick as possible. He then grasped his cock by the base as he shifted, hovering his own body over it. Sinking down.
Before he could struggle with that question any longer, Cas answered it for him by going in for a kiss himself.
“I, uh, have something you can wear tomorrow if you can’t mojo your clothes clean,” Dean said, trying to act unaffected.
“All of it?”
“Is it bad? Tasting, drinking angel blood?”
There was still a part of him that felt vaguely panicked, uncertain. He wanted to kiss Cas, wanted to do a lot more than that. But did Cas want that, too?
“Do we need to do anything? Besides stay here in bed?”
“Yes, I...
Dean blinked and sat back on his heels, drawing in a deep breath and shuddering after Cas pulled away, his work complete. Dean always seemed so shocked to find himself well again, no matter how many times Cas had cared for his wounds. And Cas wouldn’t admit it, but one of his favorite things was seeing that look of relief and surprised delight on Dean’s face.
He did the dishes, cursing his shaky hands when his alcohol-loosened grip sent a plate crashing to the ground.
at hunting and recognizing a trap. I’m going to have some
The much bigger snag was that the call to ask for their help specifically, and not any other hunters, had been a set-up. A suggestion for Kara to find in the form of that conveniently-discovered letter, planted by someone out for revenge.
After the turn, Dean took a route he knew well, through a very small town and into more farmland, moving off the main roads. They were about five miles down when he saw it: the old wooden windmill rising up in the distance, leading him to an untended meadow. Whomever owned this land and farm had long abandoned it to scrub and wild grasses. Dean slowed and pulled over to the side of the road, then got out of the car to stand and stretch.
They’d be arriving in Kansas in a day or two, according to Claire’s last text. But for now, it was time for Dean and Cas to hit the road and say goodbye to a life lived underground. Just as Springtime was bringing fresh growth to the land once again, they were ready to break through the surface and chase the sun.
There’d been no hunt on their radar for over a week, no anomalies which pointed to the Darkness, and that unusual quiet in and of itself could’ve been making him antsy. So he’d attempted every distraction he could dream up, every method to push it out of his head for a little while longer. He’d tried going for a run in the crisp air of the early morning—thought it might clear his mind, physically exhaust his body.
Dean grinned. “Only if you stop. I like you getting rough. Excited.” Dean ran his hands down Cas’s chest, his own breast rising and falling. Dean took him by the shoulders and turned his body, urging him flat on the ground at the foot of the tree. He pressed down on Cas as he claimed another hard kiss, once again going deep. Cas caressed the hunter’s sides, seeking the grasp of something, anything
No matter what would happen tomorrow, though, Dean had one last piece of business to attend to tonight. A final prayer to send out into the void. To Cas, if he was out there, anywhere, still able to hear him.
“I’m ready to go. Cas?” Dean looked to him, eyes bright, brighter than ever, and the doubt Cas had been feeling moments ago slipped away. He understood it had been Dean’s defense mechanism kicking in after allowing too much vulnerability.
“Hmm. Well, right now this physical realm is feelin’ pretty good to me.” He rubbed his returning erection against Cas’s thigh for emphasis.
was spinning. He felt dizzy. Hot. He pulled back but not before his tongue took a final swipe of Cas’s bottom lip, then licked at the blood on his cheek.
“It’s the kind of beauty I see every time I look at you.”
but each other in this place. I’ve been living on pure survival for months.  Could die at any second and I told myself, if I found you, I wasn’t going into the ground again without doing this. Even just once.” Dean slipped his hand around to the back of Cas’s neck and kissed him again, harder, determined not to let go or be denied. His tongue pushed so far into Cas’s mouth it was as if he were trying to reach and touch his grace, where it lay nestled in his throat.
him to? I mean, who doesn’t like Cas?”
Holding. Closeness. The beauty of quiet stillness, except for the sound Dean’s heart beating and his breathing.
If so, how had he not known for all this time?
They were enough to drive a man crazy, and Cas was one of the good ones. Or at least better ones. He glanced back at Sam still fast asleep in the back and smiled.
Dean frowned at his phone. “I tried calling—and texting—Cas to let him know we finished the salt-n-burn. No answer.”
“Cas, will you
“Mmph,” he managed, curling his body even closer into Cas’s. Which felt wonderful, so he quickly cleaned up their mess with a brush of grace and wrapped Dean tighter in his arms. He allowed his weakened wings to wrap around Dean’s body so he could hold him closer, even if they were imperceptible to Dean’s eyes and (supposedly) his other human senses. Yet Dean seemed to sense
But he had no time for awe and wonder, not yet. He had much work yet to complete.
“What if...like with my dad...one of them ends up in Hell? Mom, she...she still has a place in Heaven, doesn’t she?”
Dean shuddered. It was like a circuit closing, a current of love and rightness passing through them. He could tell Cas felt it, too, as he sighed and melted into his embrace. “I am so happy, Dean.”
Cas closed his eyes slowly and when he reopened them, he said, “For the first time in a very long time I feel...whole again. But it’s more than that. It’s not about having my power and true form restored; it’s because I finally have a real, complete family. One that doesn’t demand obedience and worship. One that gives love as much as it needs love in return.”
“Who the fuck are you?”
Castiel said nothing more. Inias soon left, his interest in the subject—now that the battle was over—fleeting.
Dark thoughts plagued his mind, too, which he knew wouldn’t stop even if he pulled over to the shoulder to take a power nap. Running out of other ideas, Dean called out in a soft voice he hoped wouldn’t wake Sam, “Um, Cas? If you’re not busy, I could use some company.”
A new kind of love, for mankind.
He’d be okay. Dean would protect him. And the bunker’s freezer was well-stocked with these delicious burritos.
They had grown into a kind of perverse symbiosis. Cas should have realized they could never stay separated for too long when already so connected.
“When it dries it will be nasty.”
“Good?” Cas asked, not wanting to disturb this moment but needing to check in with Dean.
“Hmm. In any event, I’d enjoy some flight time. Are you busy?”
“Flirt.” Dean kissed his lips, then his cheek, breathing in the scent of Dean’s own shampoo in Cas’s hair. “Mmph, but yeah. I’m gonna take you there. So we’ll have a nice long drive together...talk about this stuff. Get you set up at the cabin. Break in that bed together where I don’t have to think about Sammy overhearing what I want to do with you.”
Dean had never seen anything quite like it.
Dean had reasoned.
“Then let’s get going.” Dean slapped Cas on the back, then gave his shoulder an affectionate squeeze before heading off after Benny.
The things he saw were terrible and frightening, often beyond his comprehension. He saw creatures with black eyes which dissolved into sulfurous smoke. He had visions of grotesque monsters driven by bloodlust, hunger and anger. He saw his own hands drenched in blood.
“You seem lost to your thoughts, my love. Are you...remembering something?”
Dean wanted to split town, and fast. “Could be other angels after Cas involved in this, and we don’t know how long the banishing will keep Nanael away. He may have sent out a message over angel radio that he had Cas, or others might be part of this whole set-up. We shouldn’t hang around.” He let Sam drive while he held on to their wounded friend in the back of the car. Dean had draped Cas in the blanket they kept in the trunk but he was still shivering—though it seemed more due to his injuries than feeling cold.
Cas’s stomach dropped. “I see.” He’d been foolish to assume as much, soulmate or not. Dean was clearly mad at him for not telling him about his mark earlier.
And they all were so eager to talk to him! Wanting to tell him everything that had happened while he’d been gone, asking what they could get for him, and after a while Cas had to beg for a few minutes to sit down and...be still. After however long it had been of nothingness, this much company and stimulation and emotion was almost too much for him to process.
But then...
fault. That was the spell, poisoning you. Even Rowena, I don’t think she knew what it would do to an angel.” Or even cared.
wear the face of the man he loved?
Cas couldn’t be certain, but from Dean’s expression, he seemed to be flashing back to that moment as well. “This is mine, isn’t it?”
Whatever it took. They would find their way through this...and they’d do it, this time, together.
“Calm yourself, Dean. Our sweet honey-bee here ripped the place one
And, in truth, there were lots of seriously cool things about Jack’s new-and-improved Heaven. Things that made it suck a lot less than Dean had expected it would.
“Cas...please. Want you to touch me inside. Want you to fuck me,” Dean begged, sitting up and then shifting down so he could caress Cas’s erection. Cas closed his eyes, briefly lost to the gratification granted by Dean’s hand. But he refused to keep his eyes closed with the sight of naked Dean on top of him, straddling him like a warrior prepared to ride into battle.
“Yeah, you like that, don’t you?” Dean sighed back, smirking in satisfaction. Who knew angels had so many erogenous zones? Dean had learned that pretty much anytime he touched some part of Cas beyond his human vessel, it made him go nuts. The thought crossed his mind that maybe no one had ever touched him there before, except perhaps in battle. Never with intimacy, with the desire to draw forth joy instead of pain.
“Nights we spent watching your favorite movies together, you explaining things I didn’t understand.”
Permission, no matter what happened next.
Cas stared up at the sky, expressionless, before finally turning and noticing Dean. The gaze of those eyes finally locked onto him and Dean sobbed, “Cas, you’re...you’re really here.”
! Calm down, I’m with Cas right now. It worked, we did it. Tell Claire
Dean sighed and shook off the regretful memory. Yet another one of his past fuck-ups, one of too damn many. “Yeah, sorry, I was...nevermind, thought I forgot something. Anyway, find anything you want to watch?”
Claire and Kaia were their own kind of legacies. They were the closest to a direct lineage of the Winchester Men of Letters out there until or unless Sam and Eileen had children. They were old enough and ready to live on their own, start building a life.
Cas only hummed and kept at it, going to kiss Dean’s neck, feeling his pulse beneath the skin. Dean clutched at him, fingers digging into his back, heartbeat starting to race faster and faster. The ache for release was growing in his own vessel, and so he shifted, enough to be able to get his hand on both of their erections at the same time.
hear it. Not now, Sam. Not now.” He needed to break something, punch someone. And if his brother wasn’t careful that someone would end up being
Climax didn’t even hit all at once, hard and then over. No, Dean sobbed and clutched at Cas’s body as he felt wave after wave of it washing over him. He could drown in it. Cas licked and attended to his cock until it finally, after too much blissful torture, began to soften. Dean found himself completely overstimulated and exhausted, drained and blissed out.
He’d gone six nights without giving in and had serious doubts he could make it to seven.
The kiss seemed to last an eternity. Dean wished it could. He wanted to forget everything, all their problems and worries and fall into this forever. But eventually Cas pulled away, Dean taking in the flush to his cheeks, the look in his eyes that spoke of desire.
All Dean knew was that Cas was gone. And now, after all this? It was looking more certain than ever that he was never coming back. Dean wasn’t sure how much longer he could go on without having that one single hope still there to cling to.
“It’s not reckless. It’s me not taking no for an answer.” And Dean gave Sam a last look that said,
So he picked up his spoon and swirled it around, starting with a small taste to make sure it wasn’t too hot. He blew on the spoon and then sipped it carefully, getting some of the pasta along with the broth.
Now he drank too much whiskey, alone in the kitchen. Cas had retired to his room and Sam had disappeared to the library to research lore on a potential new case in Nebraska. Or was it Alabama? Dean couldn’t remember because he hadn’t been paying attention.
“Too much?”
“I think that’s a good idea,” Zeke said as soon as Dean laid out his plan to depart with Cas tomorrow.
Cas swallowed—one of those tiny human quirks, behaviors borne of nervousness, that he’d acquired these past few years. They had not had time alone, apart from Benny and without immediate threat of danger, until this moment. “I missed you as well, Dean.”
“Yes. I can spend some time concentrating on nothing but healing Sam and myself.” Zeke’s flat, angelic tone of voice was so unnerving to hear from his brother. “Crowley is secure. Kevin is busy with his translations. Yours and Cas’s absence will ensure there is little distraction from the work I must do.”
was our friend but who ended up stabbing us in the back. Working with
Dean got to his feet and stumbled toward Cas, his legs wobbly like jello. He rushed to collect Cas in his arms, lifting his head. “Cas! Cas, you alright?”
“No.” Emmanuel only
“Walk. Definitely. I want to remember this.” Not that he thought he could ever forget. But if there was one thing he’d learned these past few years, it was to never take one moment of beauty—one moment of pure happiness—for granted.
Peaceful, and beautiful. But still not as beautiful as Dean’s angel in all his glory, swirling blue fire and ink-black wings, fearsome yet possessing the most gentle heart Dean had ever known. Dean spun about in Cas’s embrace so they were “face”-to-face again, the familiar curves of human cheekbone and jaw solidifying against his palm. They kissed again and here it was like the ebb and flow of a tidal shoreline. Pleasure would wash over Dean until he felt he was drowning in it, and then it would fade back to a softer wave of need and yearning.
“I can take care of myself, Dean.”
he’d felt something, a stirring within his body and his blood when they had begun the ritual. Thought for certain it was working, something was happening, but then...zero. No sounds, no portals, no rifts, nothing had appeared before them.
Thinking of him.
Cas sighed, closing his eyes at Dean’s touch, placing a hand over Dean’s own. “From when I was being tortured by Efram and Jonah. They...used their angel blades on me. Repeatedly. Very deep cuts, some straight through. Such wounds take considerable energy to heal.”
The diner looked like any other across America: vinyl booths, paper placemats advertising local businesses, endless coffee refills and breakfast specials available all day.
“Cheater.”
But their waitress’s hand trembled as she poured Cas his coffee.
He closed his eyes to reduce the sensory overload. He called upon his grace to steady him, to act as a balance against the dizzying excitement of Dean’s physical closeness. “Just...lost myself for a moment.”
Cas’s eyes darted about the room, and he didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands. He finally said, “Um...are you hungry, Dean? I made you something to eat.”
It made Cas feel...useful. Healing Dean felt good in an uncomplicated way, as so few things were in his existence.
Their entire battle these past few years had been against preordained fate and destiny. But had fate actually been leading them to this place all along? Realizing they belonged together in the end to bring change to Heaven, Hell, and this world?
“I’m the Michael sword, babe, I think I could handle it.” In fact it had started to become a new fantasy of Dean’s, wondering what it would be like to be Cas’s vessel. Even temporarily, just to know. To
“Is he gone?” Sam asked.
“You guys sure you’re alright?” Sam asked.
“Pretty sure Claire would take him out first, doncha think, Clarence?”
Cas was happily munching away on his second one when Dean entered the library. “This ethnic food. I can't get enough,” Cas enthused, eager to show his gratitude.
. Italy. Pizza.
spread through him, and with it he could feel his world, his viewpoint, blossoming like a magnificent flower.
The little stars were kind of mushy, swollen up from all the liquid they had been sitting in, but the broth was fine. A little bland, but that was better than too salty.
Cas glanced back through the diner window, where Dean sat, coffee mug clasped in his hands.
Dean took in the chaos of the hotel atrium, crowds so thick they could barely move. “I didn’t think there were this many nerds in the entire universe, let alone downtown Atlanta.”
Something told him, however, that the universe would never let him off that easy.
He was making the world a better place. He knew he was doing good things. Even if it was messy, and sometimes bloody, it was all necessary.
Cas’s hands gripped Dean’s back as he tilted his head, exposing the long line of his neck. “Take me to bed and you can...mmm...
Dean was still hungry.
a voice seemed to be telling him.
Dean wanted to get fucked by that cock, but he also wanted to make this all about Cas. About thanking him for healing him, cooking for him...for never giving up on him. He moved up over Cas’s body to first kiss the healing wound on his abdomen, feeling Cas’s stomach flutter under his lips. He kissed his way down and around, carefully avoiding his cock until Cas was whining and squirming, trying to angle himself into Dean’s mouth.
. You can’t comprehend what it’s like, you—you’ve only ever known this. I feel like...half of myself has been cut away...it
“I’m already delirious.”
In fact, working on the car would be a lot better than moping around, listening to the latest news about Cas causing chaos. He grabbed his beer and got to his feet.
hugged
Only then did he exhale and relax. Cas understood his apprehension. Sleep was to be vulnerable here and vulnerability would get you killed.
“Good night, Sam, and thank you.”
He turned. It was the waitress, nervously wringing her hands. “That is your name, isn’t it? I remember you. You came to our church, said you were the new God. Killed our priest when he wouldn’t bow to you.”
But he would make sure Dean made it through, no matter what. In the meantime he’d protect Dean, and try to make the most of these few fleeting days, precious despite their brutality, that they might have together.
Cas felt so helpless, then, a failure once more. Before, when he’d had his powers, he could have healed Sam. Now he couldn’t repair a thing. “Oh, Dean…”
Sam’s eyes had widened as he put the pieces together, as Dean had.
To think back on that day when he had first stopped here, how much his life had changed since then.
“Hello, Dean.”
“How is it?”
“Loved?”
Gabriel nudged Balthazar. “Come on, Balzy. Let’s go raid the Winchester liquor cabinet and leave the love-birds some alone time to catch up.”
“Shit.” Dean seemed to recall it being some time past midnight when he’d crawled into bed. “Guess I needed the rest.” It was likely a combination of the physical injuries and his emotional exhaustion over the constant barrage of crises the past few weeks.
Cas reached out and Dean climbed on top of him, straddling his waist. He pushed Cas down, then, as he went for another kiss. Cas threaded his fingers in Dean’s hair and moaned against his mouth, the sound of it like a hallelujah chorus.
Sam shrugged. “Kind of assumed you would. Let me know if you guys need anything, okay?”
But the
“Thank you, Inias.”
“What, so you’re on
“Hey, angel.” Cas was in his human vessel, that familiar form for now. It was a lot easier than fitting a skyscraper in Dean’s backyard—that and his Heavenly neighbors weren’t as easy-going about true-form angels stomping about their gardens. Dean walked to him for a kiss, sliding his hands up under the trench coat to get a better grip (thankfully Jack had given him back the original one, the one Cas had lost on Earth when he’d gone human. Definitely sexier than the later model replacements.) “Feels like I haven’t seen you for a while.”
He could feel Cas shaking his head against his chest. “It’s gone. He used it for the spell to cast out the angels.”
Dean loved his brother, he really did. And he loved Claire as well, for she was part of their peculiar little family which had come together through the years.
“I’ll gladly swap constipation for front row with the Doctor! This is gonna be the best Dragon*Con
Cas let out a soft whimper as he reached for and caressed Dean’s free hand. The sound made Dean desperate for more, especially as it echoed like tiny silver bells in his ears.
“I guess that makes sense. Sure he’s gonna be alright on his own?”
“I understand. That will remain our secret, of course. I still don’t know what it means, good or bad. But...the bond it seems to heighten between us? I feel nothing but strength in it.”
“Christ, Cas, they could have killed you!”
“Some recipes said to add rice to the soup, others suggested pasta. Then there were recipes that explained how to make dumplings for the soup. That looked difficult, so I stuck with pasta. They had little star-shaped pasta called
—working to get you home. Where you belong.”
“Never too busy for you. And by flight time, I assume you mean...” Dean paused to nuzzle his lips against Cas’s cheek, murmur in his ear, “
“Not rea—wait, you…?” Dean was still a little off-kilter and groggy, so it took him a moment to parse together what Cas had asked him. “You
He put his arms back around Cas, soaking in the joy of seeing his face again, glowing under the morning golden sunlight. “Before we go anywhere, do anything else, Cas, I...I need to tell you something.”
than when I was in Hell, for real. Knowing you’d done what you did to save my life, and here I was...wanting to die. Thinking about how I might do it if we couldn’t figure out how to get you back. How it’d be so easy to make a dumb mistake on a hunt. Especially without Chuck’s plot armor to protect us now.
“I would.”
. He was too damn stubborn, and loyal, even when it could very easily cost him his life.
Dean had been afraid to ask. But after driving around for who knew how long, he needed an answer before he could accept that this was truly the Heaven he deserved.
Demons hurled fireballs and bombarded the attacking angels with every weapon of torture and violence they had. Flames singed Castiel’s wings, his vessel’s clothing long since burnt away by the heat and fires. Yet he kept moving forward, some of his garrison clearing the path ahead while others made certain none followed close behind.
“Good. I tried to reach those I felt I owed the most to...and who might be the best help to Jack.”
“This is perfect.” And it
Kara Swinton had inherited her father’s old dairy farm in upstate New York after he’d passed away in a freak hay loader accident. She’d tried renting the land to tenant farmers multiple times but they kept running off, bailing on their leases one after the next.
“We could, but this woman asked Garth specifically for us. Said dad helped out another family member of hers years ago. She trusts us.”
It was Cas’s turn to laugh, softly, as he leaned into Dean for another kiss. And Dean felt one pair of Cas’s wings wrap around him while another unfurled wide into the sky with a
“Cool…” Dean managed, before closing his eyes again with an exhausted sigh.
“Hang tight, buddy. We got you.” Dean kept repeating that, almost more for his own benefit than Cas’s.
God fucking
They would figure it out together.
“That’s not for three hours yet!” Dean complained.
Cas surprised Dean, then, by taking a little initiative and pushing him down onto the ground and into the crushed grasses. Dean breathed in dirt and hay and the holy sweetness that radiated off Cas’s skin—like incense and honey, somehow both of Heaven and Earth at the same time. Cas loomed over him, looking down at Dean as if he were peering straight into his soul.
It was great to reunite with so many friends and family lost to him through the years. He loved that he could get as buzzed as he wanted at the new Roadhouse with said friends and not suffer a killer hangover the morning after.
Maybe he was.
been something nagging at him for some time; perhaps now was as good as anytime to bring it up. “Hey, Cas, can I ask you a kind of out-of-nowhere question?”
Sam nodded, looking apprehensive to say anything more than, “Go. I’ll clean up.”
“Because it’s not supposed to be possible! As I told you, back then, angels...we don’t have souls, therefore we don’t have soulmates. That’s simply the way it is.”
“I heard
hear everything I said to you, didn’t you? In my prayers?”
Cas started undoing the rest of the buttons of his shirt while Dean watched with barely controlled lust. He loved Cas’s body. Loved the way his forearms and shoulders flexed as he moved. How toned he was, but not chiseled to the point of excessive hardness. No, there was delectable softness to him still, a perfect balance between warrior and lover.
, at least as close to perfect as Dean could imagine in his life as it was today.
Cas was tall as a skyscraper and more alien than anything Dean could have imagined, indescribable and beyond human comprehension. Yet he was still
figuratively. He looked at Dean with reassurance as the glow began to fade, and then back at Jack and said, “Thank you.”
“Home…?” Cas opened his eyes again, and Dean nodded.
Finally—
“From what? Where?”
“Fuck, yes,” Dean sighed. “For now.” He pressed his cheek against Cas’s head, breathing in the scent of his hair. He smelled like sex and ozone, and Dean thought he might never want to move out of this bed again. “There’s a lot more I’d like to do with you. But...a little later.”
“I very much want to have intercourse with you as well.”
and let me try your soup?”
Dean gave Cas a critical once-over, and he wasn’t looking much better than Dean felt. His skin was pale, and he had heavy, dark circles under his eyes. Even his hair looked exhausted, flat and limp against his forehead. At least he had shed the trench coat and tie to relax a bit, but Dean also knew that meant Cas wasn’t feeling his regular self.
“A lot?”
After a few minutes of quiet, Cas heard Benny snort and shuffle about, then take a seat on the ground not too far away from them.
Dean leaned back in to nibble on Cas’s bottom lip as his hands went to the buttons of Cas’s shirt. “You still didn’t tell me why you’re such a damned good kisser.”
“You doin’ okay?” Dean asked outright at one point. He noticed Cas had been sitting quiet for too long, hands wrapped around his own bottle, one from which he’d barely drunk.
Cas remembered the first time he had seen Dean kiss another. Anna. That feeling he hadn’t known yet as jealousy had first appeared in him then. He clutched at Dean a little harder at the memory, tried to kiss him in a way to suck out and remove any trace of her from his mouth and lips, like he was drawing venom from a snake bite wound.
“I can’t wait to see what you’ve got for me. What’s all mine.” He shimmied the pants down Cas’s legs, taking his time then to remove each sock. He wanted Cas
He sucked in his breath as Dean placed his hand over the mark, confirming that it matched. Perfectly. With that touch Cas suddenly found himself back in the fire pits of Hell, battle weary yet determined to make their way out now that he had Dean in his own tight grip.
Dean bit his lip. “Maybe that’s just something I’ve...felt I had to keep more to myself.”
He had a beautiful blue-eyed angel there beside him, waiting with a smile and a rough-voiced, “Hello, Dean.”
All Dean could do to try to show how much Cas meant to him was to clean and dress his wounds.
“Do I want to know the details?”
“Yes, they do. And very good friends.”
Dean hated this. He wanted Baby back. He wanted the life he’d had before back—as crappy as it often had been.
who’s actually like, as tall as a skyscraper!”
“All set?” Cas asked, after double-checking that everything was secure.
Cas leaned in, still caressing Dean’s cheeks as he went for that first kiss. It was soft and like a ray of sunlight warming Dean’s soul. Cas’s lips were dry but Dean moistened them with his tongue, smiling into the kiss to feel Cas shudder against him and moan.
“That works.” With Charlie’s limitless supply of free credit, it wasn’t like they had to scrimp and cram into one room these days. Often they still did, out of habit or for the sake of safety in numbers. But it was always kind of weird when Cas was along. He rarely slept and would sit in a chair all night, reading or playing games on his cell phone. Or just staring out into space, which never stopped being creepy.
At the same time he felt something—some
friend. So we’re gonna...I’ll figure something out, okay?”
“C’mon guys,” Charlie urged, adjusting her elf-queen ears. “If we don’t get in line now we’ll miss the Dr. Who panel.”
It would be a nice change of pace for their hands and their spirits—to create and repair, instead of having to destroy and kill.
Cas said almost nothing during all this, laying slumped against Dean and looking so weak. Occasionally he let out a small grunt or whine, if the car hit any bumps in the road or Dean shifted at all.
“Didn’t know if an angel could even get hard,” Dean breathed against his lips.
amazing. So tell me,” he said, petting Cas’s damp hair with one hand, “was it good for you, too?”
Cas’s hands were in his hair, then clawing at his back. Dean took all that he had to offer as he felt the hum of Cas’s grace and the magic of his blood enveloping him.
And the archangel wasn’t the only one.
“Screw that, I’ll sleep when I’m dead. If I’m lucky.” He rolled his neck, rubbed his shoulder where he’d been resting it on Cas’s leg. “Whenever we get out of this place. Man, what I wouldn’t give for even the world’s shittiest motel mattress right now.”
“That day, I just had to get out of the bunker. Away from Sam, from Jack...figured I’d take you for one last drive in Baby, y’know? Somehow I ended up out here in the middle of nowhere and I thought…’This is nice. This is peaceful. Cas would like it here.’”
Cas kissed him again and Dean moaned into it, rolling up to press himself against Cas’s body. There was too much clothes in Dean’s way, between his thick jeans and Cas’s ridiculous layers, yet it somehow already felt so intimate. More contact and he might combust.
Cas nodded. “This is a turbulent time, to be certain. I have the impression the angels may be forming factions to either gain a foothold here on Earth or fight their way back to Heaven against Metatron. But Dean, I have my warding tattoo…”
Cas believed he might set the forest aflame if Dean managed to do that.
He started by wiping at the blood beginning to crust and dry on Cas’s chest; those were the cuts worrying Dean the most. Cas flinched as the damp towel ran over one nasty gash under his right collarbone that was still weeping blood. “How long will it take you to heal from this?” Dean asked. Some of the wounds looked like they might need stitches if Cas couldn’t repair them on his own, though the bleeding seemed to have slowed or stopped for most.
The first part of that was easy. The second sometimes remained a struggle.
Dean only looked up at him with a very self-satisfied smirk. “You like?”
Dean closed his eyes and buried his face in Cas’s neck for a moment, needing to savor this. “I wasn’t even...never sure if we did this if you’d feel anything. I still don’t always get how this vessel stuff works.”
He could take in the glory of his many wings, dark as midnight yet shimmering with iridescent rainbow colors. Each feather of his true-form’s wings was at least as tall as Dean stood, some much bigger, and he could touch them and watch the colors spark and dance beneath his fingertips.
Cas. His angel. His...soulmate. Now that they were alone in his room again, the knowledge of this came crashing down on Dean in full force. He still wasn’t quite sure what to do with it.
had been through—he wanted the reassurance that Cas was there. Okay. Safe.
There was a whooshing sound Dean hadn’t heard in ages. “Hello, Dean.”
“Sorry. Same as I don’t like thinking about the things I did in Hell.” Dean cupped Cas’s cheek and kissed him again, reassuringly, wanting to wash all of their bad times away. “So you wanna...cuddle up together and try to sleep? We have a long drive tomorrow.”
A memory sprang to Dean’s mind and his smile returned. He went back to his work cleaning the wounds with a clean washcloth, wiping away drying blood, checking for any fabric or debris in the cuts on Cas’s chest and abdomen. He hoped the conversation would not just cheer up Cas but distract him from any of the pain as he did his work. “You’re a hell of a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for. More than maybe I have, too. Remember when you were organizing those other angels to go after Metatron?”
Cas and when Dean touched him he didn’t respond. He was completely limp as Dean rolled him over, shaking his shoulders, trying with desperation to wake him up.
“I’m not sure if there was anything holy about what we just did.”
“No. I’m sayin’...” Bobby paused, sitting down next to Dean with a sigh. Shrugging, he continued, “Killin’ racists and homophobes, goin’ after corrupt politicians... His heart’s still sort of in the right place. He’s just droppin’ atom bombs where a fly-swatter would do. Guess I’m thinkin’...maybe there’s some of the old Cas in there yet we could get through to, somehow.”
Plus he had that face, with those deep blue eyes Dean could get lost in and those full lips that deserved to be kissed...
“Cas?”
“This wasn’t Cas’s fault,” Dean countered. “Those kitsune have been up our ass for days, since before we even found him. Glad we could finally put the whole pack out of our misery.”
Benny shrugged. “Might’ve been at first. But me ’n Dean, we’ve come to a...mutual understanding. You gotta have allies in this place to survive, and he’s as good as they come. I have a feeling you’d agree with that observation.”
There it was, like a shot of adrenaline, or the break of sunlight through dark storm clouds. Cas opened himself up to embrace it and commit every word that followed to his memory. And no matter what happened, Cas hoped Dean would never give up on his prayers.
than the Winchester brothers as the focus of his allegiance.
Dean made a small whimpering sound and then laughed, putting his arms around Cas. “Hey...this is the first time
Cas reached over to place a gentle touch on Dean’s forehead. Those calloused fingertips brought Dean to alertness, both in surprise and as a current of energy passed through him. Suddenly he felt wide awake, like he’d drunk several cups of coffee but minus the caffeine jitters.
“So much for this goddamned ‘easy peasy’ job,” Dean cursed to himself, just two days later.
That was so weird to Dean. An
He wasn’t one of them. He wasn’t one of
So much death to both his family in heaven and the humans he had come to treasure, in wanting to protect them from an absent God, an uncaring father.
“Oh. In that case...” Cas did as Dean asked, slipping his hand into Dean’s hair as he went for another kiss. Dean sunk into it with a moan, surprised at the confidence in how Cas kissed him. How he seemed to already know how Dean liked it—a little forceful, more than a little possessive.
While Nanael contemplated and taunted, Dean swiped his own blade rapidly against his palm. He spared one glance at Cas, too weak to move, and prayed this would work. Prayed it wouldn’t blast their injured friend somewhere they couldn’t get to...or worse. But Cas had his eyes on Dean and managed a small nod of agreement.
“No, this is for you, Dean. I do not need soup to heal. You do.”
wrong.”
“Hmm. I still can’t fathom his fascination with these humans. They’re all so...messy.”
Dean made it about halfway through his mug of coffee and the bowl (leaving behind most of those big carrot chunks but doing a good job fishing out all the chicken meat) before he burped and realized he was full. He rubbed his stomach—gently, because he could feel bruising there, too—and said, “That’s it, I’m done...though I’ll have that pie in a little while for sure. We can save the rest of the soup for later—that’s a whole ’nother meal there.”
Dean caught Cas giving him a sideways glance. “I know as much as any angel who is not a cupid. Only they have access to the books listing destined soulmates.”
Dean had his doubts.
“Jack!” Cas untangled himself from Dean to get to his feet to hug him. “I missed you.”
Dean remembered how they had looked in the motel room, that first time not so many weeks past. “Cas, your wings, are they…?”
Cas blinked in shock. “You
There was no single moment of climax in this realm. No rushing to a cliff just to fall helplessly over it, exhausted and satiated. Here the ecstasy was never ending, theirs to revel in as long as they wished. What they lacked in raw physicality here, they made up for in spiritual intimacy, a sense that Cas was Dean and Dean was Cas and now, at last, they were
“That may be, but I’d say Dean needs you to stay right where you are for now.” Benny nodded down at the sleeping man with his head in Cas’s lap. “He was searchin’ for you for a long time, angel. Don’t go spookin’ him by not being here when he wakes back up.”
Sam, ever-observant and thoughtful, then excused himself to go finish cleaning up after the spellwork of that morning. “I’d better re-secure our banishing sigils and ensure that portal to the Empty is well and truly closed.”
Dean made a lovely, pleading sound and turned into Cas’s kisses, catching him on the lips for the next one. And as wonderful as their earlier kisses had been, this was so much better—here in the intimacy of Dean’s room, messy or not.
Purity of thought. Clarity. Focus. Sam kept saying how they’d need all those things, come tomorrow. And that was part of why he was here now in the fading light of day. To focus his own thoughts, and to send Cas a message, a prayer, he needed to believe the angel could still pick up on.
“’Good. Gonna take you deep again and want to feel you come right down my throat.” And Dean did what he promised.
“Fuck,” Dean cursed, followed by a moan. Or maybe that was himself moaning. Maybe both of them, because this? This felt wonderful. While his fingers couldn’t quite reach around the two of them together he was able to send a current of grace from his fingertips to complete the circuit, enveloping them both. Dean squirmed and bucked against him, and he could sense how many more seconds Dean would last before reaching orgasm if he kept at it.
Cas was certainly getting his share of looks. That had been part of Charlie’s sales pitch—that this was the one place and time of the year where the angel could walk around with his wings out and proud and no one would bat an eye. And Dean never got enough of seeing them, not since they’d figured out how to restore them to their full glory.
Dean smiled. “Yeah, times like that. Or when you came back from the Empty the first time, and I took you to Dodge City.”
Because you think your precious little Dean has the hots for you? For
“Did anyone else get out?” Cas asked.
Dean nodded. “Just know I’ll still kick your ass if you get too full of yourself.”
Cas reached up to caress Dean’s face, eyes shining as he smiled. “I know. I love you and it’s alright.”
Dean untangled himself from Cas only enough to get to his phone—which, to no surprise whatsoever, he saw light up and start vibrating from an incoming call the instant he reached to dial Sam. “Hey Sam, I—yes, I dealt with them. Sam
“Cas—” Dean reached out to stop him and Cas paused, Dean gripping his forearm. Cas waited for what Dean could possibly say, but there was nothing
” Cas squirmed as Dean kept teasing and massaging that spot. “I
“You’re asking the wrong person, because I have no idea.” Cas answered. “I...my memories are confused, but...one minute I was in the Empty, awake and waiting. Fighting to stay awake and stay a step ahead of the entity because...you’d told me to be ready.”
“It’s almost two in the afternoon.”
A time in his life when he’d felt bound only by survival, killing monsters—in Purgatory, after he’d found Cas and they were trying to make their way to the rift home.
way.”
Dean swallowed. He was struggling to absorb it all. Cas had tried to explain to him once, how vital prayers were to angels, how special it was to be prayed to directly. That his prayers could have brought Cas back from death...it was more than he could quite comprehend.
“I never want to be alone again, Cas. I’d rather die.”
“As I told you, it was a burn, not a soulmark…”
Dean blinked, then stiffened and looked down. Cas understood; he hated being reminded of that time as well. “Any idea what you did here?”
“Which wasn’t
place, not mine?”
“This?”
Claire made a face. “Ew. This is what I get for staying with two gross guys for a few days, huh? Fart jokes and lame-ass food?”
Dean shook his head after she left. “Great. Just when things started calming down, it looks like we’ll be dealing with a bunch of jail-breaked angels and demons. Fuck, you don’t think Crowley might’ve…”
“I may have been using some ‘mojo’ to ensure your brother doesn’t hear a thing.”
! Damn, Cas
Cas was firm in his rebuttal. “You can, but you shouldn’t. And this place feels...calm. For now.”
“It’s not your fault, Claire. I’m sorry we made you go through all this for nothing.”
Cas chuckled against his forehead. “None of my dreams, for however long I’ve been gone, have been at all like this.”
“Yes. Yes, I am, Dean.” To prove his point, he took Dean in his arms and kissed him, so deep it seemed as though tendrils of grace were reaching out to touch and caress him inside and out. He could feel the new power Cas carried with him and it was breathtaking—almost a little frightening.
The sound of it seemed to drive off the entity for the moment, leaving it screeching in pain. Cas hoped it would awaken others. He called to them, some by name, those whom he felt the deepest regret for their loss at his own hand or otherwise.
Lots of kisses, until they were wet and swollen and…
say, to that. So he was glad when Cas kissed him again and he didn’t have to say anything at all.
to slip through the rift between Purgatory and Earth, if it were only open to mortal beings.
“And this isn’t?” Cas asked.
There was a
“I shouldn’t be here at all. It’s too much of a risk—as you yourself have said. More than once.”
“Great, thanks. Anyway, I’m gonna put the leftovers away and grab some beers. Take the rest of that pie he bought—I
Cas rose to his feet, eyes scanning the reach of his work into the distance. He took Dean’s hand and Dean felt the warmth, the power of his grace still electric in his fingertips.
“Fucked me that good, did you?” Dean laughed a little, pulling Cas down against him. With a deep breath, he offered reassuringly, “I’m fine. Awesome. Really.” To emphasize his point, he circled his fingers lazily in the spot between Cas’s shoulder blades, right where he knew those wings met his back. That got a shiver and whimper from Cas, his wings snapping back to attention so fast a loose feather went flying overhead. “You?”
where you were and what was going on. I tried praying to you, then I just sent out a general APB to all the angels—”
“You will always be enough for me, Dean Winchester.”
“Most likely.” Cas paused before continuing, “Does that bother you? Soulmates are quite rare. Generally only those who, together, have significant roles to play in fate of the world are mates. Most humans seem to find fulfilling relationships without needing to be soulmates.”
sensation quickened the blood of Cas’s physical form considerably. This body he wore now—more than a vessel, not quite flesh and bone—responded with base lust as a human would. Meanwhile his true-form hummed with building strength, current coursing through his wings that ached to stretch out and enfold Dean, to carry him far from here.
Well then, fuck it, Dean was going to. He leaned in to meet Cas’s mouth again, kissing him, sliding his hands carefully around his waist. He didn’t want to cause pain but he also wanted to feel as much of Cas’s body as he could. A small hint of blood was still there from the split in his lip and Dean licked at it, drawing out that sweetness until he could feel the buzzing in his brain again. Cas moaned against him, a desperate sound that quickened Dean’s pulse and was enough to make him hard.
“I know, Cas, I know. But he was dying! He was absolutely gonna die back in the hospital because of what the trials did to him. I had
“Dean?”
and all over and before he knew it he was crying out Cas’s name. His orgasm crashed over him as Cas stiffened and clutched at him even tighter.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’d like that.” Had it been that long? How long had it been? How much of his brother’s life had he missed?
that’s...that’s one hell of a trick.” Dean arched his hips, lifting up, then settling back down. Sinking deeper. Again and again. He breathed, open-mouthed, heavy, as he looked down at Cas. Not breaking eye contact. Cas couldn’t bear to even consider looking away.
“Okay, that’s a relief. But I wish she had dad with her, for real. Though I don’t know if dad is still our dad at this point...must be, like...over a century for him in Hell by now.” Dean himself had been so close to turning demon, and that was after only four months. Their father had been dead for years.
Cas lifted his own arm that had been pinned between them, putting it over the pillow propped up behind Dean’s back. That...actually brought them a bit closer and left Dean with the light sensation of Cas’s arm against him. “Better?” Cas asked.
This was not how Cas had ever imagined his first kiss with Dean might be—and oh, he had imagined it. In moments that had filled him with shame, and in times when he had felt as powerful as God himself. He thought he had envisioned every possible way in which it could take place, what it might feel like. Not sleeping gave him plenty of time to think, especially in these months alone, cut off from the world, from Heaven. But he never thought that kiss would be in a place like this—gritty and rough, frantic and foul, in a land made of nightmares where monsters awaited behind every tree wanting to see them both dead.
“I’m not losing you again. We go down, we go down together. Promise me that.”
“Thanks. But don’t think I’m just going to kick you out on the street with nothing, okay? I wouldn’t do that to you. You’re my soulmate, after all.” Dean smirked, then looked away, a little flushed. “And even if you weren’t, you’re my friend. My
“Cas…”
could go back asleep. On the condition it allowed me to take enough angels of my choosing to keep Heaven running. The ones most likely to keep it awake.”
“You want in?” Dean offered, and Batman handed over his camera. He then posed with caped arms outstretched to match Cas’s giant wings.
“’K, well, see you in the morning. Glad you’re okay, Cas.”
She touched his stomach, her fingers resting over the handprint mark. He flinched.
Was it some kind of sign? Could it have been?
,” Cas moaned, as Dean’s hand slid into his underwear. What he found there was very human, and very hard, and Dean licked his lips. He stroked Cas for a while, teasing touches as he continued kissing him, unable to get enough of those full lips. His own cock was weeping and desperate for attention, but he wanted to concentrate on nothing but pleasuring Cas—for now.
“I...I’m not sure, really. I’ve heard strange things...
“Yeah, well...I’d rather you turn into a chronic couch potato than have this keep happening.” Dean worried he was pushing Cas too much. Maybe pushing them all too hard. They’d been through so much trauma non-stop, barely able to catch their breaths before another threat to the world—the entire universe—was upon them.
There was still a hole in their lives—a large, Jack-shaped hole, one which Dean knew Cas felt with special keenness. But Jack finally made a re-appearance about six weeks after Cas’s return. They’d been curled up together watching—and snarking—about the latest episode of “Dr. Sexy” (“
Dean sighed. It was all too much to think about. He needed to sleep on it. Maybe they could start talking about things on the long drive to Rufus’ cabin tomorrow.
“Maybe you can. But maybe I’d like to help, huh? ’Sides, I know you’re not as juiced-up as you used to be. Especially not after getting sliced and diced like this.”
…” The end of his full name came out half a sigh as Cas’s fingers brushed over pink nipples that went hard beneath his touch. Dean dipped down for another kiss as Cas slid his arms up Dean’s back, his shoulders...everywhere and anywhere he could reach.
And having Dean so close, touching...it could do wonders for replenishing Cas’s energy reserves as well.
Dean pulled back eventually, mercifully, his eyes afire in their own right. “When we first found you I almost tackled you to the ground right then and there. Been waiting for my chance ever since.” He dragged his lips and teeth downward, kissing and nibbling at Cas’s jaw, his neck, his collarbone.
Cas smiled at that, his blue eyes still vibrant with that grace-fueled glow.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat at the first touch of Cas’s lips against his own. It was a light kiss, questioning and not demanding. Yet at the same time it was enough to shatter all the walls of doubt and uncertainty in Dean’s heart. Cas started to pull back but Dean stopped him, lifting a hand to the back of Cas’s head to keep him close. Cas moaned against him, surrendering to Dean’s demanding kiss.
Dean took it, his hand trembling slightly as he wrapped his fingers around the smooth handle. The blade was light as a feather yet also deadly sharp. Cas put so much trust in him, handing him this weapon. It was one of the few that could cause real harm to his vessel, or draw out his grace entirely if applied to the right spot. The one thing that could easily kill him if brandished with such intent—and with which Dean had, on one terrible day, almost done precisely that.
“Yes, home. You’re here. I’m here. The field near the bunker, remember? Your favorite.” Cas finally made the effort to sit up, his arms wobbly so Dean reached down to help him. Cas shuddered as Dean’s arm wrapped around him, eyes widening. Then his gaze narrowed on Dean. “Cas…?”

of breaking branches—followed by a low whistle that they both recognized as Benny announcing himself, coming close.
After all, Dean was the only one who continued to pray to
Cas could speak to him in his real voice and the sound was like a deep, delicious hum coursing through his body—not the screeching sound that had threatened to blow out his eardrums on Earth.
“Oh.”
Dean chuckled. That was Cas, always right to the point. Dean drew in a deep breath. “It’s just...it’s been a fucking crazy couple days, y’know? I don’t want to rush things...and it’s kind of overwhelming to me, too.”
“Yeah, you look tired, Sam. I said I’m heading out tomorrow morning to set Cas up in an old hunter’s safe house, in Utah. I checked with Garth and he said no one is using it at the moment.” Something had told him not to mention to Zeke/Sam where he was
At last Castiel saw him, at the far end of the pit. Naked, his back muscles tensed as he pulled back his whip, ready to strike the damned soul suspended on rusty chains before him. He seemed oblivious to the battle raging around him, lost in the sadistic pleasure of inflicting pain on another.
More than anything else, he wanted Cas back.
He started moving down Cas’s body, placing kisses on his neck, his collarbone, his chest...anywhere he still could get a taste of that blood. He’d cleaned the worst of the wounds on his torso but there was a cut on his stomach that was still bleeding. Dean went for it and licked up the red trail, finding every sensation intensifying once again.
But then he saw the angry red marks in several places on the angel’s chest and abdomen. They looked like stab wounds and slices, healed over but still raw and obviously tender. Dean's concern quenched his desire long enough to ask, as he reached out to touch one below his right shoulder, “Cas…? What are these from?”
Thinking about Cas, lost and so vulnerable like that made Dean’s heart hurt. “Hunters learn as much, too.”
in a pile under the tree to their side. Dean blinked and let out a surprised laugh, shocked to suddenly find himself—both of them—completely naked.
“Nothin’ like having an angel to put you back together again after a fight, eh?” Benny said, adding a little less generously, “’Specially when he’s the one drawing the worst of the monsters to us.”
to say it, as if he had to offer reassurance before he went any further.
Castiel sighed and covered the mark before anyone else might stop in and see it. Most of his garrison had returned to Heaven already but a few remained on guard in the area, should Hell try to reclaim Dean. From his coat pocket he took out the crystal vial which, for the moment, housed Dean’s soul. It sparkled and radiated such beautiful, fiery light, Castiel almost hated to have to let it go. He somehow felt compelled to want to hold onto it forever.
Cas tilted his head under Dean’s scrutiny. How could he look so human and vulnerable while at the same time so powerful and...alien?
“Yeah, and he’d have to spend all his time underground here to stay safe. That’s not a good way to get used to human life. I can set him up and he’ll be secure but away from the danger that follows us everywhere.”
Dean walked to the boulder, sitting where Cas used to sit. He drew in his breath, several times, trying to relax and unclench his hands that were balled into fists at his sides.
running around with
“Sorry.”
After that, everything had gone crazy. He'd made it home with Benny but was sure Cas was gone forever. Then Cas came back and...things weren’t right. None of them knew until much later that it was mind control dictating Cas’s actions. But then Cas had lost his grace, and Dean’d had to deal with saving Sam after the trials... Then it was dealing with Abbadon and the Mark while Cas was trying to build and lead his angel army against Metatron...
“Doesn’t it? I’ve never seen you wish to share intimate relations with anyone other than women.”
“Yeah, me too. It was kind of dopey at times, but better than I thought it would be.”
Dean started undressing as well, tossing off his flannel, lifting his t-shirt overhead. Cas shifted back to lay down, propped up as before on his pillows. Open, inviting, patient, he welcomed Dean as he climbed on top, straddling his thighs. He leaned over Cas to kiss him again, loving the warm press of their bodies.
to Dean, to hold his body and soul against him, filled Cas with sensations that he’d never allowed himself to know in all his eons of existence. And whatever they were, he
The fire in Dean’s groin was growing out of bounds already, from their kisses and feeling the weight of Cas pressing down on him. Their bodies grinding together, the electric touch of Cas’s hands on his face, in his hair... It coursed through Dean’s blood, making him heady with such desperate arousal he was whimpering.
“And then I’d feel so ashamed, ’cause that’d be throwing away what you’d done for me, for all of us. But I guess I thought, if nothing else, at least I’d get to see you again in Heaven, right? Like, relive the memories of the good times we’d had. I figured there’d be enough to make it better than...this.”
Dean was babbling, talking so fast Cas could hardly keep up. “I do recall how to drive, yes. And thank you again, Dean. For everything.”
Cas nodded. “I could sympathize with how Chon felt at the beginning of the story. Very loyal to his duties as an Imperial Guard, even when he felt he’d failed in his role, failed his people. Then falling, lost and alone in a strange place he did not understand. And at first the two of them, Chon and Roy, they don't trust each other, or like each other...but then they find they are much more similar than they thought.”
Certainly, his situation was far from perfect. After all, he’d
“Well, I didn’t have Chuck’s hero armor to protect me any longer. And maybe...maybe a life without you in it didn’t feel like much of a life to celebrate.”
Fuck, he wanted everything. He wanted Cas inside him, he wanted inside Cas. He wanted Cas’s mouth, he wanted those hands…
A small smile quirked to life from the corners of Dean’s mouth as his eyes lifted to meet Cas’s. “Thanks.”
“Yes?”
Dean had always loved Cas’s hugs, but this one was like none other. Dean clutched at Cas’s coat and when he could finally find words again, he asked, “We did the spell to bring you back in the bunker, so how the hell did you end up
?” Dean suggested. “I haven’t seen it yet, but it’s got cowboys.”
Cas finally lifted his head again, anxiousness fading to a cautious smile. He slipped his arms down around Dean’s waist and when they kissed this time it was slow and gentle. Tender. Healing. Oh, it wasn’t as if Dean didn’t want more—his body burned for it—but he would take his time. He didn’t want to overwhelm Cas.
Jack laughed. “That could work. I could create a portal right here in the bunker. But every portal is a weak spot, and I still wish to invite as little interference between Heaven and Earth as possible. I was thinking more...something I could give
“I told the Shadow I’d help put everyone asleep, so
“So Benny has told me. Much to his dismay, it’s quite clear.”
“So let’s do something about that.” Dean sat up to start removing his outer jacket.
“You said the one thing you wanted was something you couldn’t have. And if you meant me, you were wrong. You’re so fucking wrong.”

Dean lifted his own hand to cover Cas’s. “I promise this is real. What can I do to convince you?”
“And you couldn’t bother to come tell me you were alive?”

Heaven soon had another challenge it would have to work damn hard to meet.
Dean dropped the blade to the bed and immediately brought the wound to his lips. He licked at the bleeding flesh, sucking, tasting that heady, intoxicating nectar and chasing down the tiny bit of grace. Cas’s whimper turned into a low moan, one that Dean echoed back as the fire spread through him.
empty for months, Cas. Stuck here alone, just me and Sam and too many messed-up thoughts in my head.”
But he couldn’t. The risk was far too great.
“Don’t be.” He heard Cas shifting on the bed. He came up behind Dean, placing a hand on his left shoulder while resting his head on the right. Light kisses fell upon his neck and Dean sighed, melting into Cas’s tenderness. “You know you only ever have to ask. I am as responsible for this as you are.”
of a big new one on the way out. Might be a few more like me who escaped before they could patch up the drywall.” She put her hand on Dean’s arm, patting it while she gave Cas a fond look—and got up on her tip-toes to plant a light peck on his cheek. “But don’t worry, I’ll keep my eyes peeled for you boys. You keep my Clarence happy, will you, Dean?”

Dean paused. “A
Cas withdrew his fingers, leaving Dean panting and desperate from the emptiness. Dean watched as Cas coated his cock with more of the lube, taking in the incredible sight of him, glowing with the light of holy fire and grace.
Cas stood to leave. If he still had functional wings he’d fly away. Instead, he would have to rely on his old rattly vehicle that Dean loathed so much. “Call me if there’s trouble; I won’t be far.”

“Yes, I’m ready.”
“Anyway it sure woke the undead. We either gotta get on the run or find a more secure place to hunker down ’til morning.”
“Whoa…” Dean marvelled, understanding dawning on him. “Either kissing you is really something or it’s your blood, but...I can
Dean had taught Castiel he had choices.That he didn’t have to always follow Heaven’s orders with blind devotion. Dean had lead him to reject the only family he’d known for millennia and embrace a new path, a new kind of existence.
“All set.”
He did it anyway.
light. Spinning circles of it, around his head, all around this room. Dean could reach up and touch one of the bands of light and it slowed to meet him as Cas arched up from the bed. Touching it was like putting his finger in an electric socket, but without the pain. It was just an intense
