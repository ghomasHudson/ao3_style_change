The tide was starting to come in.
"Don't be obtuse, it's not a good look on you," John says. At Sherlock's scowl, he adds, "Especially not on you."
Sherlock’s wardrobe was overflowing with nice clothes, new fashions, expensive real leather jackets, and he didn’t know what it was like to wear hand-me-downs, to pick through church donation boxes when he was younger and he had probably never been to a rummage sale.
When the shivers subsided the embarrassment set in. Day had come; harsh sun chased away the night’s phantoms and filled the room with heat. His face flushed with warmth; his bedclothes were overly hot and stuck to his skin.
“He didn’t even need to be in the flat,” John says. “You read the one where we were in Buckingham Palace…?”
The whispers and giggles continued to follow John down the school corridors, but nothing loud enough for him to actually discern words. He bit his lip, and held his head high, and tried not to hear it, and if Bill and Mike pressed a little closer to him and talked a little louder, John didn’t say anything about it.
What was he doing with this boy, this boy who calls his mother mama sometimes, all soft and entreating to get what he wants.
“I’m sorry,” said Sherlock, who then continued, “that you’re a little bigot.”
“Maybe?” asked Sherlock.
John had been poking at the keyboard for the past thirty minutes, the novelty of the new blog still asserting its hold over him. His face was the very picture of utter focus: brow scrunched with concentration, the tip of his thoughtful pink tongue occasionally peeking out between his lips.
“Two against three,” said Mike. “Majority rules.”
This chapter's art is by the wonderful
“I am allowed to go to the malt shop whether or not you are there,” said Sherlock. “I like milkshakes.”
“No, it really wasn’t him,” John said, and smiled. “Or at least one hopes not.”
She was not a stupid girl. The bruise on his shoulder, his mysterious stalker; she glared at him with knowledge and silent accusation. She knew the answers, too.
“Carl Powers is a wanker,” Greg sighed. “A terrific Beater, though. But a terrible boy.”
“It’s not an attempt. I
Sherlock fucks him properly now, the thrusts hard the way he's always wanted them. The thrusts jerk John's small body against the leather seats. The car rocks beneath them. Their flesh smacks together.
House points...” The last few words were a struggle, and Bill courageously fought back a little sob. He then joined John in the face-in-hands movement, as he shook and whimpered to himself.
” They fall into the shower together, John still giggling until Sherlock covers his mouth quiet first with his palm, unsuccessfully, and then with his mouth, successfully. They stay in the shower for over an hour, depleting the motel’s hot water tank, and John runs his hands through Sherlock’s wet hair and makes his curls fall in front of his eyes and Sherlock rubs the dirt and sweat off of John although he seems more interested in the rubbing than the actual washing. Straight to the bed after still wet and dripping and laughing and John does something he’d never do at home which is let all the water drip into the sheets and soak the bed with Sherlock pressed up naked against him and kissing his collarbone and the curve of his shoulder and his curls all wet and wild and messy and the last thing John thinks before he falls asleep is how they’ll probably be cold in the morning but for right now he’s warm.
” that weird pull when Sherlock said his name, the way his world narrowed to just Sherlock’s arms and his touches, and darkness all around them - “I want to be with you. I want to be so close to you. You smell so good. You feel so good. I’ll make you feel so good.”
“Oh my god,” says John. He has to put down his coffee to keep from spilling it all over himself. “You can’t be serious.”
“You’re still an idiot,” Sherlock said after a moment. He gave a little harrumph of exasperation and touched John’s forehead, very gingerly, with the sleeve of his robe, applying light pressure to staunch the bleeding.
“Motion to never allow Bill to speak again,” said Mike.
Sherlock catches him looking and smiles. John thinks about Greek myths and something about six pomegranate seeds. Aunt Aggie would say it was the apple, but in the end, you were cast out of the garden all the same.
“John Watson,” said the figure in an ominous tone. He whirled around then, to face John, his robes swirling around him as he did; they flowed out, dark and graceful, before settling gently to the ground.
He made him feel hot and funny, too, in ways that John
This is a kiss.
John had applied to Stanford on a whim and a wish, not liking his chances. He had never expected to be holding the letter that ran:
Dark Magic and then people will get
The streetlamps slowly glowed on. The trees that bordered the quiet road seemed taller as the sky grew darker, lengthening with the shadows, blocking out light. The darkness was encroaching all around him.
“Only Professor Binns could make a lecture about
“Spoken like a true Gryffindor,” Bill said with pride. “Of course, Carl’s in our House, too...”
John allowed himself to be led easily enough, no real resistance to his soft little limbs. His small fingers were cold in her hand. “What a mess, John,” she chided, her voice overly loud and falsely cheerful.
“He was just here, Dad, I swear!” Harriet insisted.
“Jaaaawwwwnnnn, come aaaaawwwwnnnnn,”  whined another boy, dark-skinned with black hair and currently pawing at the table. (Comes from old Wizarding family, but not affluent, middle child, Cannons fan.) “You’re supposed to be my partner. I even gave you my pumpkin pasty as insurance!”
“John!” Hazel cried in relief, splashing over to him. He had emerged from the depths, sleek as a baby seal, dripping wet with seawater.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, that’s not very nice,” John agreed, mouth twisting into a moue. “But it doesn’t mean it’s evil or Dark Magic. I’ve seen him do it. He doesn’t like…read your mind or anything. There are clues! And he figures them out. He sees stuff that we don’t look at. He’s not evil, he’s just really…brilliant.”
“What are you doing out this late?” John asked. “The curfew-”
Sin with joy, sin with abandon.
“You want to know more than just what you’ve been told. You want something more than everything you know.”
I saw, and the storm that night...There’s something out there, Tom. I saw it, I know I did. I wasn’t dreaming! It wants him, it wants our boy...”
This was what he observed:
Sherlock scoffs, but does not light the cigarette in his hand. John puts a record on. He has an excessive amount of Elvis albums: all four of them. Who needs the Christmas album?
“Sherlock in the sky with diamonds,” Victor tells him, half sing-songing it. “Something stupid I made up in uni. It annoyed the shit out of him. We used to do a lot of drugs.”
The air was crisp that bright Thursday morning, and the birds were singing from the telephone wires, and John was muttering to himself like someone gone mad.
John had never seen anybody who walked that way before. Not outside of movies, at least.
Mycroft stood up, straightening out his robes. He always looked so detestably impeccable. “So, can I trust you to give Hogwarts another try?”
“Let me tell you,” said Sherlock. “You’ll graduate school, you’ll go to college - maybe you’ll become a doctor, because you want to help people. You might want to leave, you might dream of travel, but one day you’ll meet a girl, perhaps she’ll be a nurse, and you’ll get married. You’ll have a child or two, and settle down once again, just working your life away, in one of these places where nothing ever happens to you.”
Sherlock didn’t know why this came as a surprise to him.
“Responsive,” Sherlock purred in approval against his chest, and smiled again at the vibration of John’s catch of breath. Oh, yes, John could be more responsive than either of them had even imagined. A shudder shook his body as he was almost overwhelmed with the desire to push, invade and plunder until he’d explored John’s full potential.
John opened his mouth but nothing came out; he’d forgotten words, language - especially when Sherlock smirked at his reaction. It didn’t matter. In the next moment Sherlock was over him once again, blanketing him with his body. He poured over John with renewed vigor.
“You’ve been thinking about me,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock’s lips were cool, again, from the autumn night. The kiss was as gentle as before, but it was more real, dangerous, now that he could feel the strength of Sherlock’s arms around him, feel the cool leather of his jacket, smell it, feel Sherlock’s chest hard and solid against his. John’s belly swooped with the sensation of falling and this time there was no way out.
Sherlock was a terrible mess: bright, pale eyes red-rimmed, smudged with dark circles, stubble on his cheeks and chin. His normally perfect hair - of which he was so proud - was a quashed bird’s nest of curls, flat on one side and tangled on the other. His white shirt was covered with yellowed stains, and he probably hadn’t showered in days.  His skin was sallow, his fingernails stained with nicotine. Everything about him seemed yellowed. John realized that one of the record players was blasting  Mozart’s
When they could find no sign of the living, the fleet's commander Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships. Instead he insisted that they establish the new colony on Roanoke. Even now, his motives remain unclear.
, we’re all so very scared.”
John only shudders at the words. "I'll make it so good for you," Sherlock says. "I'll make you love it." He can feel John's dick twitch in his hand, does not miss the quick intake of breath, not that he ever misses anything. "I could tell, the first time you looked at me, that you've always wanted this from me."
“You didn’t see it when it was filled with decaying human remains,” John replies.
He is old enough, now. Old enough for this wanting. To know what that flip in his tummy means, and to know when he’s being flirted with, even when it comes from another boy. A man. The slight curl of a lip, inviting; the intense appraisal through dark lowered lashes. The slow drag on the cigarette, and the shape of those full lips kissed together on the exhale, surrounding John in a wraith of smoke.
And lower still - Sherlock’s hands spreading his thighs open, John spreading for him as if on instinct, so easily. A gasp - then almost a shout - when Sherlock’s tongue lapped at the head of his... his cock - that sensitive and wet place. John clapped a hand to his own mouth, mortified but unable to stop the sounds otherwise - the whole neighborhood would hear him.
It was still new enough to startle him. Every time brought back the first time, with Sherlock’s long, deceptively big fingers inside of him, dextrous violinist’s fingers playing him, while John squeezed his eyes shut and writhed and panted on the bed, wanting to close his legs, wanting to keep some of his dignity and the self-control that was being stripped from him till he felt more naked than he’d known was possible.
He does.
with boils I won’t really be running,” said John. “I might be crawling painfully on the floor and crying...”
“But I can’t fuck you over the workbench, John,” Sherlock said, and lapped at John’s nipple with just the tip of his tongue. “You said you wanted the hood of my car.” He was tickling his fingertips over the head of John’s erection again, feather-light pressure through his trousers.
“And you’re not all that big.”
“Sherlock...” Mycroft warned.
“But you know it’s true,” Bill continued doggedly. “John, here are the facts. You are used to having loads of friends. Holmes is used to having none. You can’t continue on like this. It disrupts the natural order of things! It’s not right. Is that what you want? To be against nature?”
“Are you going to take her to the Fall Ball?” Sherlock asked suddenly one afternoon. He was lounging on John’s bed, carefree and lackadaisical, while John was being tortured by trigonometry.
And then - the small, thudding footsteps of a little body ascending the stairs. The familiar creaking of the third stair, the way it always did underneath the weight of a human body.
John whimpers when Sherlock's hand finds his erection and lightly traces the shape of it through his trousers, fingers skating, teasing. John squirms as if unsure whether to push into it or to try and pull away, but one thing is for sure: he does not attempt to push Sherlock's hand away.
These photos capture you like that, John, in the very moments that made me so hard in my trousers that I most likely have the imprint of my zip on my cock right now.  And you want me to delete them?”
Something terrifying had awakened in John, something dangerous and untameable. But he could not go back to that static, unlit life.
He settled his hands on the wooden windowsill. The young man motioned for him to push up the glass, mouthing silently. John hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, before he complied.
,” said Sherlock, “is a better partner.”
Sherlock met his eyes, then. John felt pinned down by his gaze, strapped in, unseen heaviness pressing on his thighs, his hands, his chest. Heaviness low in his stomach. He wanted to burrow back into the seat.  Instead he smiled helplessly, and those storm-water eyes flickered down to his mouth before turning back to the road.
Everything had been in that moment. Everything was in this moment. And then, and now, each of them thought,
and had started to think of them as
“You’re right,” John admitted. “Last night. That was my first kiss, last night.”
Sherlock quickly pushed himself up with one hand and scooped the camera with the other, scrambling to his feet. He then jogged off into the other room, leaving John blinking at the ceiling. By the time John pushed himself up onto his elbows, Sherlock’s long legs had already carried him away, before John could even get to his feet.
"Shhh," Sherlock shushes, and their lips brush together. Taste of John on his tongue already just from their closeness. Molecules of John Watson, the composite of him, underneath Sherlock, writhing and vibrating beneath him with desperate electrical energy.
"You're still dressed," said John.
“I think I can figure out the right sort for myself, thanks,” John said.
John watched
all settled,” Professor Hudson said, “I do think you boys all need to apologise to one another.”
“Yes, John, just like that,” he whispered, stroking his hair. It took a little of the tension out of his face, and the haze got just that much deeper. “Feel everything I do to you. Surrender to it.”
accusation to call anyone a Dark Wizard, and if you seriously believe that someone is one, then that is a case for Ministry Investigation by the Auror Department. A false accusation, of course, is equivalent to fraud, and can result in a hefty fine at very least, and a short period of imprisonment at the most.”
John looked to see if his car was in the driveway. It was. The motorcycle was probably in the garage.
Every time he watched
Spreading ginger and scallions over soy sauce chicken and rice, Victor says, “We used to raid Professor Blackington’s office for his alcohol stash. He had his suspicions but he could never garner enough evidence to prove it was either of us. We were always each other’s alibi. In fact, Sherlock was the one who taught me how to pick a lock.”
“Just sit there on the bed,” Sherlock directed.
“All right,” said Hazel, and shivered.
John did not look up from his plate; he was very busy poking his beans around with his fork to form a crooked smiley face. “No, Mummy,” he said.
"It was a long time ago," Sherlock shrugs.
Comforting touches all over John’s skin, that made him tingle pleasantly.  He was at once soothed and glowing, lit up from the inside.
“Even supposing that you were correct and John and I had actual motivation for attacking you - and being a Dark Wizard fledgling does not count, really, that’s stupid, what would I have to gain? - the logistics of it don’t work out. Never mind the fact that John’s last class of the day is Transfigurations, which is across the school from the Library, so physically John could not have been in the same place as you and I when we first ran into each other, after the bell rang at 3:30. If the story goes as you say, and it was John and I who ambushed you, then I would have had to be physically involved in the fight and yet only the two of you ended up with injuries. Now, you may suggest that perhaps I held you down while John landed the punch - a fairly ridiculous accusation, but not entirely illogical...except when you consider the differences in our physical size. You, of course, being a Third Year Beater for the Quidditch team and with the typical physique to match, and myself being an ‘ickle firstie’ as you’ve been so happy to point out before - I simply don’t have the upper body strength to be able to hold you down, especially not long enough for John to throw a punch, and - given your aggressive nature - without getting hurt myself. Perhaps I used magic, you might say, altering your story a little because surely you would have mentioned magic before this; however, a quick Scan of my wand to show the last five spells cast would reveal nothing more threatening than a Wand-Lighting Charm.”
Still, he did not stop the gentle flutter of fingers over his mouth, nor the tracing of his lips with the pink rubber end of his pencil.
The shells and stones in his pail were dry now, and they revealed themselves to be such dull shades of brown and grey, no longer the gleaming jewels they’d seemed when he had first picked them up from where they had been embedded in the wet sand. That was exactly what had happened to his whole afternoon, his whole day, his whole life. The water had all dried up from it, leaving behind only dullness and salt.
Tom snorted, the way one does when awoken halfway through a snore. “Go back to sleep, Hazel,” he mumbled. “I’m sure it was just the wind.”
“All right,” John said. “But maybe a little less wet next time.”
Wet hands cupped John’s face then, and Sherlock pressed their mouths together, touching light and soft.
“Oh, it’s just another word for a promise,” Sherlock told him. “But it can’t be broken. And you mustn’t forget.”
“You can live out your whole life and die here, in a little town like this - or in a suburb that’s identical to this one.”
“Read it to yourself, don’t read it out loud,” Sherlock says.
Carl was a Gryffindor boy, two years’ John’s senior, in Harry’s class. He was a Beater on the Quidditch team, a position that suited him perfectly. Although John had only known him for a few weeks, Harry had described him as a particularly detestable boy, which was something, since Harry found all boys somewhat detestable. John was inclined to agree when he found the ‘Welcome to Gryffindor, Firstie’ frogs in his bed, courtesy of Carl.
He was meant to take her to the Spring Fling, but five detentions in three months meant that she was
He serves them both bacon and eggs - scrambled, with cheese, sprinkled with some dried herb seasoning John vaguely remembered buying - garnished with parsley; side of stewed tomato and toast. “You
Sometimes, people said such awful things, that it was like they had this knife or an icicle or some very sharp object that they could stab straight into your heart. John’s face scrunched up and his lower lip trembled, ever so slightly.
“Ah,” said the Head Boy, who looked, infuriatingly, even more amused. “Could it be that you’ve decided to trust Sherlock Holmes, of all people?”
“And you, Mr. Murray, Mr. Stamford?” Professor Hudson prompted.
“Oh, Sherlock, your ink spilled…” John said with utmost sympathy, as one of Sherlock’s carefully written essays was now stained with dripping black. It looked like it had once been Transfigurations homework, judging from the half of the diagram not completely blotted out.
“Well,” John said, “Batman.”
When Sherlock closed his eyes and thought of John, that first night replayed against his eyelids. The night lit intermittently by police flashers; John’s head tipped sidewise with those wry forehead wrinkles cast in flickering blue shadow; John’s eyes the gleaming black of a winter lake.
He did, however, get called “freak” five times, so John supposed that it evened out.
is drinking,” he said, and demonstrated by knocking back the rest of his drink.
In the night, he dreamt of a man with giant leathery wings,  watching over a dark castle, able to protect them both from all that was bad in the world.
But the first night they stopped at a motel John felt like something between a newlywed and a man on death row. They’d never been alone before, no listening for the sound of the key in the lock, no turning up the music so that no one downstairs would hear. No tensing at the sound of a car pulling into the driveway, parents coming home.
There was no room to move, no place to escape, and Sherlock’s hand slid up to John’s hair, long white fingers threading through, tugging his head back and then Sherlock’s  mouth was upon his neck -
John inhaled sharply, and held Sherlock’s wrist tight, pressed his fingers in hard, until he occluded the pulse completely and could not feel it anymore.
over it, barely grazing it with his teeth. John felt like whining already and fought to keep it in. It was amazing how quickly Sherlock got him hot, as if he had been trained into erotic reflex over years of conditioning.
Sherlock rubbing against him down in the dirt. The two of them pressed together, rocking together, locked together.
Sherlock reckons that that person you would see would still be an idiot.
“When the Devil comes to you he is beautiful. ‘Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light;’ so says Corinthians 11:14. That is why he is dangerous. Nowadays we are surrounded by temptation; and we must worry about our youth, who are particularly susceptible. The Devil comes to our youth in the form of fast cars, cheap thrills, and especially that evil known as ‘rock and roll’ - tempting our youth to sin.
“Good riddance,” said Sherlock, when Madam Pomfrey had left the room. John looked at him, reproachful and hurt, until he realised that Sherlock  had intended it in regards to Madam Pomfrey, not a Hogwarts sans John Watson.
Madam Pomfrey uncorked the bottle. “Violence, Mr. Holmes - and Mr. Watson - is never the answer,” she said. And then she forcibly tilted John’s chin up and proceeded to burn his wound with acid.
He waited, patient in the half-circle of Sherlock’s arm, till Sherlock had the camera held up and positioned the way he wanted it. Putting his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders for stability, with Sherlock’s hand a steadying pressure at the small of his back, he went up on tip-toe for a sweet, lingering brush of lips. He could feel himself blushing again, but that was all right. It felt good to kiss Sherlock like this, in front of a ‘witness.’ In the camera’s steady black eye, they belonged to each other. It was a thrilling sort of knowledge.
“Blond,” John says. “Wait, with his dark eyebrows?”
Arriving at the intersection between ‘goddammit’ and ‘fuck no,’ John paused and bit his lip, trying to decide which way to go. The spoon-licking had been one thing. Well, no, it’d been the same thing, really, but it was hard to argue with results like those, even if the very memory of some of the places that tongue had been made his face go a vivid tomato-red.
John swallowed, shifting in his seat on the worn red cushion of the pew. His slacks were scratchy and hot against his thighs. He turned his eyes heavenward, and met instead the suffering Christ, forever nailed to his cross. Jesus’ eyes were downward cast, toward the realm of mortals. Forever sad about this whole sorry state of affairs. John felt awful glad he wasn’t seated further towards the front, in that particular line of view.
“Even better,” John said, eyes wide and bright with enthusiasm.  They glittered in the half-light of
“I bet he was a great detective,” Victor says. He has found the deerstalker and he is examining it, turning it front and back.
John pushed back against him, thighs spreading; no longer anyone’s little homegrown ingenue.
“Isn’t around anymore,” John finished for him. Sherlock kept looking at him, expectantly, and if John weren’t careful he would spill all his secrets to those moon-pale eyes.
"Sherlock, you really don't have to do this."
“And here I been talking you up all day as a reckless renegade!”
“Well, guess…guess I’ll see you around, then,” John mumbled, hiding his face. In that instant, Sherlock wanted to take it all back. Yes, please, be my partner, come sit right here next to me, I’ve saved this seat for you.
Or maybe he did.
“For once in twelve miserable years could you stop doubting me, Thomas!”
“I’m sure you have already heard what they say about him. And now, by extension, what they say about you. You’re the type to make friends easily, and yet you have chosen to align yourself with someone so suspect, whose presence in your life has already drastically affected your potential popularity and happiness during your time here at school. You could easily find another friend, Mr. Watson, one who is less complicated and difficult. I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him.”
“‘Of course they are,” said the boy, and drew himself up a little bit higher. “That’s why this compartment is entirely empty.” He said it as if it were such a blatantly obvious fact that John should have felt stupid, but he didn’t. The idea that anybody would be afraid of this amazing boy was stupid. “Haven’t you any idea who I am?”
John passed the night fitfully. He could not remember exactly what he dreamt, only flashes of images: an empty coffin, the sensation of hands upon him, all over his body, a mouth upon his skin.
bedroom - John was standing there, half-undressed, shoes kicked off and his hands working at his own belt.
When he led her out onto the dance floor he found himself emboldened with the newfound confidence of one who has a vague idea of what they are doing. His steps were sure, and he took care to look into her eyes instead of looking down. He did not even step on her feet once.
“Hey, if you like those so much,” Jeanette said. “You should check out the curtains in my bedroom.”
John shuddered hard, squeezing his eyes shut as if he could block it out. He was stunned by the hot sensuality of it, the electric flutter in his stomach and the blossoming heat. It was not something he had ever dreamt about, or would have ever allowed himself to think about. It was not a thing he had known to want. He was so embarrassed he could have just died on the spot -his face must have been bright crimson.
“Everybody breaks curfew sometimes. At least those of us who know how to have fun do. We can’t all be goody two-shoes like Watson over here.”
The moments that mattered most were the moments when nothing remarkable was happening.
“How do you know I can’t sleep at night?” John asked.
John looks at him, pinned by his gaze as much as he’d been pinned by Sherlock’s body against the lockers. His own breath is hot in his chest, still trying to catch up. Wants to press his fingers to his mouth to see if he can still feel the kiss there, body tingling all over in all the places they’d touched, pressed together.
As with most things that were intensely personal to Sherlock, he had little to no consideration for the opinions of others. As with most things in general, honestly.
Slytherins be mean,” said John. “And I’ve seen a Hufflepuff be mean, and I know Ravenclaws can be mean, and today I punched a Gryffindor for being mean. And I followed Sherlock for a week and I didn’t see him do anything evil at all, really, and he took me to the Infirmary and then he stayed. He sat right here with me while Madam Pomfrey made me better.”
The world continued to change its face in the fading light, the shadows shifting.  John had never been outside this late before, had only ever seen his own street growing dark from the windows of his house. The road he’d biked so many times before suddenly seemed unfamiliar. Was he lost?  Had he been down this street before? Maybe he’d taken a wrong turn somewhere, although, logically, he knew he’d only gone straight.
. The eyes were the worst: large and luminous and glassy, like those of deep-sea fish that never saw the light of day. They seemed to glow with an unholy light.
“Punishment?” John squeaked with horror.
“I have to go,” Sherlock said quickly. “Nobody else can see me. And you mustn’t tell anybody about me, do you understand? It’s our secret.”
"Harry's my sister."
? (Although, to be fair, that would have been a rather impressively sized pudding.)
His eyes were gleaming as he told John about the creatures of the deep, monstrous and strange, fish with lights and giant jaws and animals that didn’t look like anything real at all. His fingers stroked the soft blonde hair at the base of John’s skull as he told him about the intelligence of an octopus, although they were all tentacles and no brain, and how you could engage one in a game, if only you had the time and the wisdom to ask.
John sits down on the corner of Sherlock’s bed and tugs at the comforter to straighten it out. He smoothes it out with his hand, and then straightens it again.
“Promise you won’t laugh,” John said, still pulled away.
“Stop by the reception desk on your way out. We’ll make an appointment for next month.”
“You  look fantastic! ” Sherlock snapped, nettled.  “What you are is an idiot if you don’t think so. Do you think I would waste days of my time chasing you around with a camera so I could take
“Found it!” Bill cried, thrusting his fist up into the air in triumph. From between his fingers, a thin gold chain glinted in the light.
But then John’s friends were calling him back over, were making jokes and faces and they were laughing and before Sherlock could say anything, really, John had very quickly walked away.
Sherlock placed his hands on the workbench, on either side of John’s thighs. He was sizing John up as if there were something about him that he hadn’t seen before. John didn’t think that was possible. When Sherlock leaned in John could smell him; that scent of clean male sweat mixed with motor oil - unmistakably masculine.
John frantically shook his head no, too afraid to actually form words. His face burned, inflamed with shame; Professor Hudson was so
“This is the gratitude I get for watching out for you?” Bill snapped. “Give me that back.”
“It feels good, doesn’t it?” Sherlock asked. His deep voice surrounding them both, his mouth, close enough to - “Being so afraid, sometimes. The adrenaline in your veins. It excites you, stimulates you.” And he was pressed right against John, weight of his body fully upon him, John trapped between Sherlock and the car door.
Enough. Sherlock would not stand for being cast aside in favour of Bond movies, especially not in his own home.
He had never felt this way about anyone before, not even the girls he’d had crushes on throughout his young life. No one had ever made him feel like he had lightning crackling underneath his skin and storm brewing in the core of his body.
He expected John to cut out with his heels on fire.  “I’m not gay,” he expected John to say, eyes wide and rabbit-scared, hand trembling before it turned into a fist.
necessarily were,” Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes. “It could be
“You didn’t have to wait up for me,” John said.
The knocking came once again, three gentle raps.
“Sherlock’s eyes are greyish blue,” John offered.
John, needing to feel solidarity, allowed Bill to put the moustache on him; it affixed itself immediately to his upper lip and made his nose twitch a little, almost like a rabbit’s.
It was a bigger car than his mother's, he thought, clenching fists on his lap. A sleek dark racer, carefully maintained. Sherlock was looking at him, but John quickly glanced away. His gaze was strangely hot, and if they made eye contact, John had a distinct feeling he would burn up. He wouldn’t be able to look away. Be trapped, somehow.
The bathroom is small but uncommonly clean; two dark wooden stalls and a row of three gleaming urinals, brown and off-white tile on the walls just this side of ugly. It’s much too bright inside the stall, and there are men’s voices just outside as the evening gets later and the bar gets busier, and the man’s mouth is upon his, open, kissing, insistent, urgent hot press of lips to his, John lets it happen, happens to kiss back with everything inside of him, all the sin bubbling to the surface.
“No…?” John said. “Should I…?”
John puts the tiny Pony Express rider on the dashboard, next to his growing collection of souvenirs. Sherlock glares at it as if this is a personal affront, as if the tiny horse might make tiny droppings in his precious car. John surreptitiously moves it behind his miniature catsup bottle (from their visit to The World’s Largest Catsup Bottle; Collinsville, Illinois).
“No,” said John, who knew about Quidditch from Harry, who said it was
He brought the issue up a few days later, on a Sunday afternoon. John was in the sitting room; Sherlock could hear him, clacking away with his two-fingered typing. The mere sound of it was exhausting.
“Slugs...?” John said. He looked into the glass jar on the table, recently retrieved during the waiting period, and then he paled.
Anatoly Kamanev was the leader of a drug trafficking ring, current operational headquarters: Paris, France - City of Light. A man with many connections, a solitary spider in a web of his own, spinning his silk, growing fat from his captures; in all respects, a powerful, dangerous man.
In case you missed it:
“Well?” John prompted.
“At least have some sweet piss,” John says, holding out his cup. “It’s still warm, even.”
He didn’t have a bike.
John comes down afterwards, shivering and trembling, lost to himself, still gasping for breath. Sherlock shakes a little too, post-coital tremors of pleasure. He places kisses upon John’s throat, soft and soothing, arms tight around his body. John arches back against him, relaxing into his embrace.
, watching our every move!”
“You know why! It’s dangerous to be near the windows during a storm!”
Freudian theory states that dreams of falling indicate that a person is contemplating giving in to sexual urge or impulse, but Freud has always been ridiculous and full of shit anyway.
“I’ve been telling everyone, they really have to fix that heating! Especially on a warm day like today. Careful, honey, don’t sit up just yet.”
John laughed with exasperation. “Because, Harry, it

is real.”
“You may keep that unsightly creature in the Common Room,” Mycroft continued. “Merlin only knows what sort of unhygienic things you bring into your dormitory already without adding that to the pile. I found a nest of dead horklumps under your bed the other day. How long had they been there?”
Of course. Sherlock nodded with sympathetic understanding. “That explains why you never had a problem with it before.”
John bit his lip. He had said too much, he hadn’t meant to, but no one ever talked about those days. Momma didn’t like it.
,” Sherlock sighed. He rolled over, finally, because it was starting to get hot with his face buried in the pillow for so long.
they been in a relationship? Did their first declared ‘date’ as a couple count for more than celebratory post-case dinners where a starved and triumphant Sherlock ordered half the menu? Or a stakeout with John huddled around a mid-afternoon cuppa like a warming fire and Sherlock bent low, ostensibly to peer through a dirty window but really so that he could keep looking at John’s charmingly red nose? And what about the romantic walks through a moonlit park while they searched for discarded pantyhose and lubricant from a string of rapes in the North London area?
“America, somewhere, I think,” John said, with a vague little wave. And then he seemed to realise something. “Oh! Batman’s not real! Did I forget that? He’s not real like
The day after Sherlock had solved Lestrade’s latest little puzzle, he swanned into the living room, dropped into his chair and said to the air, “I want you to pose nude for me.”
She trails her crimson nails up Sherlock's thigh. "C'mon Sherly, you're in orbit. Just tell her three little words, the easiest lie. You've done it before, haven't you? That's what all the little girlies say."
“Rachmaninoff,” Sherlock said, and held out the leaf.
“A good boy wouldn't stay out past curfew reading true tales of horror in the library.”
“Hmph,” he said scornfully instead, opening his book to where he had left off, in the middle of gruesome account about a man and his dubious, dangerous usage of a Snarfalump. There were an awful lot of tentacled plants, Sherlock noted.
“Sleepwalking is not uncommon in young children,” Tom reminded her. “That’s what Dr. Mullaley said.”
He laid out all his favorite records, arranging them in a careful fan next to the record player. And then, once he stepped back and took a proper look at it, he messed it up again.
Victor pushes himself up, carefully peeling them apart, and then makes a face as he looks down between them. “Well,” he says, “that’s disgusting.”
“John!”
“See?” said Mike, and Bill seemed appeased, for the time being. “We came as soon as we heard you were in the Hospital Wing because of Sherlock Holmes,” Mike explained.
They counted together, then, and on three, John pulled while Sherlock pushed, and John pulled harder than he’d ever pulled before, like he was trying to beat Harry in a game of tug of war (which he always lost), but he pulled with all his might and Sherlock pushed and there was a lot of splashing until John ended up falling backwards, flat on his back with Sherlock squirming on top of him.
“Take this, all of you, and drink it…”
There was a yawning pit in his stomach that would swallow him if he let it. He could not let it. Instead he pedalled his bike over to Sherlock’s house. Sherlock lived in one of those neighborhoods where the houses were big and white, with the lawns rolling out in front of them in thick carpets, lush and green. They had pools in the backyard, fountains or animal statues in front. On the side of the house, the Holmeses had a separate three car garage that Sherlock had taken over with his engines and experiments.
His lips were soft against John’s, and John remembered belatedly that he should close his eyes or something. Sherlock’s lips parted and he exhaled; his breath was a warm sea breeze, wafting inside of John’s mouth.
of idiots.
species of deadly plants,” Sherlock said.
It was enough to drive a man crazy.  People call Sherlock crazy either way, and so he had done what came naturally, and slammed John up against the lockers and kissed him, full and harsh on the mouth.
“Prefect Lestrade,” he greeted, energy focused on keeping his voice and hands steady.
The entire class turned around to look at them, Mike blinking as he finally woke up and then shrank down in his seat. Bill howled with laughter, fist pounding the table.  John attempted, without much success, to shush Bill as he tried to keep from giggling himself.
There's no hesitation, not from John, who - once a decision is made - throws himself full throttle into the fight, pulls the trigger with a steady hand. John's tongue, laving over his palm, wet and lush, warm and slick, wetting it with his saliva. Sherlock wishes he could see it better, catches only the tease of it between his fingers, pretty and red, hot wet velvet lapping up and down the digits.
something boyfriends did! At least not if they wanted to stay a boyfriend!”
“Go away,” John said, against Sherlock’s mouth. He dropped the sheet to push at him playfully. “I’m not ready yet. Go outside and then come back in so I can be waiting for you in your bed, all sexy like.”
John was jostled about so easily. His eyes and lashes glistened with the tears of frustrated desire. His throat and chest shone with sweat in the light, his cock flushed red and leaking drops of precum onto Sherlock’s white shirt.  Sherlock loved to fuck him with all the lights on, so that he could drink in the details of him, observe every reaction, catalogue every twitch and shudder. Sherlock grabbed at him with his hands, squeezing, snatching at him possessively. He thrust hard into him with his cock, burying himself into tightness and heat.
In the United States, wildfire destroys three to ten million acres of land each year.
Sherlock says, “No,” against his mouth, and everything in John’s body crashes spectacularly. It’s horrible. It’s unfair. John now knows what it feels like to be kissed. He cannot simply go back to his previous life of being un-kissed, never-kissed, not knowing and not wanting. How did anyone live their lives, really, knowing this feeling and then not wanting?
“Hey! I was
“You like
He tries to think if he will be able to stand it. Wraps the blanket tighter around himself, but he can’t seem to get warm.
Sherlock’s other hand skimmed over him, down his body, between them, and it was, it was touching, pressing, at the tip of John’s erection, the newness of being touched by someone making John jolt, shudder, moan, “Yeah,” and again, that whimpering sound. Sweet sticky ichor of his desire spilling clear. Then no words because Sherlock’s thumb was pushing into his mouth, and John opened for him, yielding, hot, suckling at it as Sherlock rubbed his thumb along John’s tongue, feeling its soft wetness and John leaked, whimpering, into Sherlock’s hand.
He did, however, feel marginally better, despite the fact that his dessert was all gone.
It doesn’t make sense. He had thought for years that it was the sun around the earth; thinking on how overwhelming it would feel if one were constantly moving, constantly in revolution, thinking that this is how he feels; the noise and the stimuli of the world in constant revolutions around him, deafening, and nothing makes sense.
“What kind of things?” asked Sally.
Panic sank its claws into her throat.
- and the sour/sweet smell of the wine she’d been drinking. John thought that she’d never looked so beautiful, blue eyes crinkled with smile lines, blonde hair a halo of soft waves around her face when he looked up at her, all of her made golden by the kitchen light. She was so graceful, her skirt blooming like a flower at every turn. They were twirling, laughing together, John getting dizzy from all the spinning, his mother already dizzy from the wine. He’d been eleven years old at the time, her little man.
He peeked over John’s shoulder again. “Hmmm.” As he’d thought: the default theme. John hadn’t even changed the colours. He was scrolling through files on his computer, clearly looking for an icon photo. Oh, anything but that horrible, vacuously smiling blog photo.
But now he does think about it. He doesn’t try to. In fact, he tries very hard
“Well, what do we do now, Socks?” he asked the little brown owl in her cage. Socrates blinked at him but had no reply, a true insult to the fabled wisdom of her species.
Momma quietly, gracefully bore the heat as if it were her penance; one would never know she was suffering just to look at her. It was important, she always stressed to John and Harry, that they put on their best face for Sunday service. And so he and Harry always showed up with their faces scrubbed bright and clean, their clothes in order, pants pressed, ironed dress, shoes shining, and although Harry sometimes whined that it was her God-given right to have a little dirt on her knees, John rather suspected that a pristine appearance was more for the benefit of their earth-bound neighbors than any heavenly eyes.
There, right
read much?"
He hopped onto his bike and started pedaling.
Sherlock, looming over him, noticed his reaction.
John could feel the pale eyes upon him, roaming all over his body, taking him in. Over his mismatched striped pants and checkered pajama top, over his messy slept-in hair with the cowlick, over his neck, exposed, over strip of chest and throat. His skin felt prickly all over with the attention. He felt himself, exposed, even though he was mostly covered.
“You’re not stellar at Potions,” Sherlock told the Bubotuber, “but your current partners will drag down your grade. If you had a half-competent partner you might even get an Exceeds Expectations, which would of course, be essential if you one day wanted to become a Healer.”
“But why, Mummy?” John asked, blinking away the drops of water from his dark gold lashes. “I was only swimming.”
Sherlock kissed him, sweet and deep, the fingers of one hand trailing through the edge of John’s hairline. Yes. John parted his lips, because it made sense, just now it was the only thing that made sense, the softness of Sherlock’s lips, the slick heat of his tongue, the taste of him…
They didn’t allow evil people to be Head Boys, did they? Surely there was some sort of screening process for that. Studying to be an Evil Mastermind certainly wasn’t part of the Hogwarts Curriculum.
They sit together and watch the whole thing. Sherlock would have gotten bored with the ridiculous premise and heckled the film from beginning to end.
They lay together, just the two of them; complete in their togetherness, euphoric in their completion. No room for ghosts between them. For the first time in months, John’s mind was a quiet and comfortable place.
But kissing Victor is good, so good - still good in all his sobriety, and they stay up late together one night heckling a stupid romantic comedy and Victor likes all the restaurants John shows him and Victor says ridiculous things to make him laugh and Victor understands about Sherlock and for the first time in what feels like forever John wants something again and Victor understands him. All in all, that’s more than John has had with his last four or so girlfriends, so that’s good.
“Now,” Sherlock commanded, feeling his own orgasm cresting. The sound of his order came out low and breathy, sharp and scorched with need. “Come for me, John, do it,
John turned, an inexplicable dread thudding in his heart. Then he saw Sherlock’s face, and was struck, suddenly, by his sharpness, his peculiar beauty, his wicked good looks - not for the first time, but the first time he allowed himself to think such things - and gasped softly.  Sherlock smiled a (gently) feral smile, at him, just for him, and a pang of want strummed a chord through his chest, and a feeling like warm, sticky caramel trickled down his insides.
“Can I help you?” he asked, finally glancing up.
It was Sherlock who insisted that he date. John hadn’t wanted to, but he didn’t want people to think he was weird or a loser either, like Sherlock said that they would. He was well-liked enough, after all, and he was on the football team - although he thought himself only a passing player. It wasn’t like he was a total nerd. People would think something was wrong with him if he didn’t date.
In answer to Sherlock’s cocked eyebrow, John added quickly, “Shirtless. I can do shirtless. And then...we’ll see. No promises for now.”
John slid his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, leaning back as Sherlock supported him. Sherlock held him there for a moment, eyes searching John’s face for something undefinable. He was so close. John found himself, once again, captivated by the flecks of green in his eyes, lost in the icy pallor of them. He could see every individual eyelash, the thin shadows they cast over Sherlock’s cheeks. He felt his breath and pulse quicken on primal instinct, blood stirred by the danger of what he wanted.
I plan to be far, far away from the Gryffindor Common when everybody returns from classes.”
“She really wants me to go out with her,” John told him.
Sherlock’s eyes seemed hooded, dark as the woods that surrounded them. But in his eyes, there was the paleness of the winter sky. John looked down to his mouth, strangely full lips, pink - and once again felt that warm heat pooling low in his belly, warmer now for the feeling of Sherlock on top of him, for his larger hands gently encircling John’s wrists, holding them down with just enough pressure to let John know he wasn’t going anywhere.
"I'll run. I'm a good runner."
What he did not deserve, however, was the silent treatment from Sherlock, of all people. For four days Sherlock did not answer his private line. John, as a last ditch effort, called the main number for the Holmes household, (
John laughs. He’s forgotten how good it feels. “Oh god.”
Sherlock was having none of it.
“Illogical, but okay,” Sherlock said. He took Billy back from John and placed him carefully onto the seat. “I like to play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for hours on end. Would that bother you? Potential friends should know the worst about each other.”
It’s just friction, layers of denim between them and not enough contact, but Sherlock’s 18 and any friction is good, hell, any kind of touch is good. Through the denim he can feel the shape of John’s cock hard against his, the heat of it, the heat of the thought: John is all hard like this because of him. John’s tight little body underneath his, rocking up to meet his, eager for the press of his cock thrusting against him. John’s mouth forming the shape of his name, panting softly
Oh no, was she going to write Mum and Dad and tell them what happened? Was she going to tell them, even, that he’d gotten
Has to make up for it, do something cool, and he fists a hand in the lapel of Sherlock’s leather jacket to pull him close. “Do that again,” he says, and his voice only trembles a little.
He took another step back, meaning to catch his footing and go on the offensive, but his armchair was there, the damn thing, and he tumbled into its arms instead. He flung an arm out to stable himself, just barely in time to save the upholstery from being doused with a nearly-full cup of tea. “Bloody--...Stop!”
a misnomer.
Under Professor Hudson’s expectant look, the boys put their wands away, shuffling their feet and some of them even had the grace to look a bit abashed.
John Watson, Sherlock knew, was never late to class. He greeted each and every class with unbounding enthusiasm. He was usually early if at all possible, running to his classes, despite the whinging of his Gryffindor cronies plodding behind him, dragging their feet.
“You threw it away?!” Sherlock cried. “Mycroft, how could you? The sign clearly said ‘Do Not Disturb’! It was an experiment! You are an archnemesis to...not only myself, but the progress of all wizardkind!”
John was lying on the sofa, moaning about his shift, as usual. Apparently there had been an encounter involving urine and vomit. It was that kind of a day.
Sherlock thinks that they should just bomb middle America, because, he says, he cannot think of a more useless piece of land.
“That’s how it works,” Sherlock explains, not pulling his hand away; if anything, fanning out his fingers, stroking over it through the material of John’s trousers. “You’d be tight, but I’d stretch you. Open you up with my fingers until you were ready. The hardest part is the outer ring, but that’s muscle, and, as is its nature, it contracts and expands. And then, right inside, there’s your prostate gland, which contains a bundle of nerves that are directly connected to your cock. When that part is stimulated, it reacts the same as to any sexual stimuli, resulting in sensations of pleasure and arousal. Right there, that’s where I would rub against when I fucked you.”
“Yes!” Sherlock said, nodding. John hiked up his trouser leg with pride, showing off the thin white line on his calf that had once been a nasty, jagged laceration. He’d bled everywhere, and Harry had screamed, and Mum had screamed, and it had been really gross. It’d been brilliant. Sherlock ran his fingers over the scar tissue reverently, and John giggled because it tickled, and then he regretted giggling because it made his face hurt even more.
And yet John sometimes heard the revving of engines down his street. Deep into dark summer nights, while he slumbered under the blanket of August heat, the vibrations on the gravel reverberated into his dreams. From his open window the hooting and the hollering, the wild yells they trickled in, those fiendish sounds, that sometimes morphed into a howling that did not seem it could have come from the mouth of anything human.
“You would cut them?” John asked, dark blue eyes wide.
“I’ll tell you when I first knew,” John said, wriggling a little, which admittedly caused Sherlock to regain some of the lost interest. “Right after the Yule Ball. You kissed me under the mistletoe. And I knew, and I didn’t want to know, so I pretended I didn’t know, and I spent so much telling myself otherwise, but…it was, as you say, so obvious.”
you? They say that you’re friends with that freak, Sherlock Holmes. But you’re not his friend. He doesn't have friends. So who are you?”
Sherlock let him sit in silence for a while, John determinedly not-squirming, as they sped through through the darkened streets. “I quite like mysteries and crime stories myself,” Sherlock finally confided, and John looked over in shock. In spite of himself, he'd wanted this cool stranger's approval, and found himself basking in this shared, secret interest.
His eyes are closed. His mouth is open. Nothing comes out. No whimper, no sound. He can’t even form the word
John scrambled up on his knees, and with a mighty
“I despise hats!” Sherlock announced to the world at large. Indeed, he had declared a war on hats three years ago, when Mummy had wanted him to wear one for a family portrait. So Durmstrang was out, then, even if they
One day, John is going to beg for it; he will whine that Sherlock is going too slow. He has a voice for begging, a voice for tempting one into sin.
85 miles per hour on Rte 466 and near head-on collision. Failed side-stepping racing maneuver; any moron would have seen that they didn’t have enough space or enough time. Multitrauma: left foot crush injury, broken cervical spine, internal bleeding; hemorrhage likely. Nearest hospital 28 miles away, pronounced dead on arrival.
“From L.A.? Seriously?”
If one were to look at him, he would appear to be sleeping. His little body laid out, naked and still, sunken underneath 16 inches of water. His arms floated at his sides, his entire body suspended in the water. The surface of the water was as smooth as glass; the fairytale coffin that held him.
"Fine," John says, throwing his bag into the backseat. "But you can't make me like it."
“That’s weird,” John giggled, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “I thought only boys and girls were supposed to kiss.”
He would have to tell Sherlock as soon as possible. When the right moment came, he would do it. It was all right, then, to wait for the right moment.
Their bodies fit together obscenely well. His body covers John's smaller one so easily; the size difference between them is obvious, and it's wrong how that observation makes Sherlock's hips rock involuntarily. But only a fool would mistake any of it for fragility. John can take anything Sherlock can give him and more.
"Sherlock," John slurred, slinging an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. "You’re alive! Drink with me."
Sherlock lights a cigarette and the night turns dark around them.
“Sometimes,” the Head Boy admitted, which only further confused matters for John. Being a part-time enemy probably wasn’t very lucrative. “In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, depending upon his mood, he might even say archenemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft reproached, “some of that was my homework.”
She had fallen asleep listening for the thudding sound from the children’s room, that never came.
“I wasn’t aware there was a difference.”
He holds out his hand, beckoning.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, a little breathless. He pushed himself off of John, and John got himself up, and that was when he saw Sherlock examining himself, hand running down his own...tail.
- until the sky started to lighten and the birds began to chirp, and exhaustion claimed her at last.
And all the Watsons, big and small, agreed.
“Look, don’t come running to me when you’re covered with boils...”
They worked quickly and efficiently together after that. Sherlock particularly so, so that they could finish the potion before John could form a strange sentimental attachment to the porcupine quills or Flobberworm Mucus or something.
He had only said murder, of course, because that was how the saying went. But Sherlock perked up at the word and turned a look onto him that was very intense and very bright and John really thought that Sherlock was one of the weirdest and most fascinating people he had ever met.
“I seem to recall there were two people involved last night,” John points out, irritable now. “I was well aware of what I was doing when I was doing it.”
John shudders, fear and intrigue in his eyes at the suggestion. No one has ever told him that was possible, no doubt; Sherlock himself had to learn it from fast girls and faceless adolescent fumblings. John's hips shift and rub beneath him, despite the fact that he's just come. John's mouth remains slightly open, inviting, even after Sherlock withdraws his hand.
John smiled for the first time that day.
There was some kind of monster lurking just on the edges of the screen, something pale and blurred, as if the camera had suddenly lost focus there. It twitched, it twisted like a fog…
“I came to see you,” Sherlock answered him now. His voice warm and low; it jolted something strange inside of John that made him swallow reflexively. “I enjoyed our little chat...how have you been?”
with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is playing on the telly. “Oh, this cheesy old film,” John says, even though he rather likes it.
“Pleasure to meet you,” Victor says, genuine and warm. “Sherlock and I went to school together.” He shakes her hand and does not embarrass himself by pretending to be French or calling her a radiant beauty or any of those sleazy clichés that people somehow think is charming for older women, but is actually uncomfortable and mildly insulting for all involved.
“Early bird gets the bacon,” Harry chomped out, spraying buttered toast crumbs across the table.
said the table, said the sort of tug buried deep, it seemed, within John’s gut.
If Sherlock had any decency in him, he would leave John alone. He would excise this part of him like a cancer; parcel it away to somewhere where it wouldn’t taint anything, anymore. He would cut out the tumor of desire before it metastasized, before his need ate up every cell of his being.
“Take it off,” Sherlock suggested, so low and quiet that it was almost hypnotic. John’s hands moved without thinking; didn’t want to think too much about what he was doing, until he was naked except for his socks. He felt shaky on his own feet.
around Sherlock’s dick, warm and fluttering when he convulsed, as if his body were built purely for Sherlock’s pleasure.
“John,” Sherlock said, and cupped his face with one hand. His eyes suddenly so dark, his skin almost glowing, moon-drenched in the darkness. He ran his thumb over John’s lower lip - smearing the wetness of saliva, his and John’s mixed together. “This is what you want.”
“Would you let James Dean get to second base with you?” Sherlock snipes. He means it a lot more scathingly and a little less catty than it actually sounds.
The next thrust is hard because Sherlock needs it and John does too.  John yelps in response but his dick twitches and drools precum between them. Sherlock builds up the next several thrusts, simply enjoying the slide in and out, John hot and tight all around him, the idea of it nearly overwhelming in itself. He wishes he could pull back to watch, to see his dick sliding in and out of the tight little hole for the first time, but John is clinging too tightly to allow for that. He watches John's face instead, the crease of his brow, his panting, open mouth, fluttering lashes and flushed cheeks.
He looks at John the way a spark must look at dry, crisp kindling, while the kindling begs to be set aflame.
“Bill insisted that we come to make sure that Holmes hadn’t cast an evil spell on you.”
he’s good. They’ve all kept on the good side for years. But even if they weren’t, even if they didn’t, do you reckon we’d know about it? They have all this money and all these smarts, they could cover up
came into being.
“It’s a token,” Sherlock said, and used both hands to curl John’s fingers for him, so that his  small hand closed into a fist around it. “The stone has been taken by the sea, and the waves toss it and churn it for a hundred years, and in the end it becomes all polished, beautiful and smooth.”
Both of them men the other never knew; between them, they split the difference.
Sherlock thinks, privately, that he could probably make John like anything he wanted, but that is a terrible thing, and instead he turns the engine on.
“Don’t bother,” said John.
Only he was much bigger now, and Sherlock wasn’t Harry, and his smile had a glint of something even more mischievous to it. There were things John was aware of: the softness of the forest floor beneath him, the weight of Sherlock on his hips, Sherlock’s hands on his wrists, pinning him down -firm, though, not too hard, because this was only play.
“You have got to be more careful,” Mycroft had said tightly, on both occasions.
“No,” John replied, with a proud tilt of his chin.
“Oh,” said John.
“One day we’ll be standing around a body and Sherlock Holmes’ll be the one who put it there.”
“Oh,” says Victor. “He never mentioned you were a mind-reader.” He smiles again, and John envies how easily that expression comes to him.
It drove the air from John’s lungs like a piledriver. They’d barely done so much as a blowjob outside of the bedroom. An image hit John of what they’d look like, fucking half-naked on the sofa like this, John twisted round and tied up in his own clothes… Hung panting between desire and uncertainty, he caught one of Sherlock’s wrists and held his eyes.
The earth is soft and springy underneath John’s feet; the smell in the air of hot green things growing.
“Maybe next weekend,” John said, still shaking a bit with laughter. “We’ll order Chinese.”
“What you need, then,
John swallowed.
Sherlock’s eyes dipped and slid sideways. Honest hurt feelings, or manipulation? Hell, one didn’t exclude the other. “Is it because it’s me? You’re comfortable being seen kissing a woman, but-”
Just for Sherlock, they had produced one John Watson. Not even science could have predicted the pitch of his laugh, easy and guileless, when caused by Sherlock’s words, or the expressive wonder of his features when he exclaimed, “Amazing!”; his admiration neverending and addictive. What was the coding for the flush of his skin, underneath Sherlock’s fingers, or the light taste of salt as Sherlock licked at his navel in reverence for this miracle, or the musicality of all his soft sounds as Sherlock’s tongue flickered in and out of the tiny little hole?
John was 11 years old when he first laid eyes on James Dean. He loved going to the movie theater even if he couldn't afford the pictures; didn't get much pocket change because Momma always said they just didn't have the money to spare, not with the car acting up in the winter and the heating bill so high, and how he and Harry kept growing and needing clothes all the time and don’t forget new shoes besides.  Dad was always yelling about the
“You’re not listening to me! It wasn’t playing. He wasn’t breathing at
When Sherlock decided to move again, he fucked him at a leisurely pace, thrusting his cock up into slick, luxurious heat. His thrusts were slow and careful, pulling out barely an inch or two at a time, relishing in the drag of his cock along the tight grip of John’s insides, just barely rubbing against the sensitive bundle of nerves inside of him. John keened and whined, trying to raise himself up so that he could drop himself down hard onto Sherlock’s cock. His insides needed to be filled up so badly. Sherlock squeezed the flesh in his hands and prevented it, holding John tightly still.
Sherlock smiled at him, rueful and affectionate.  “Make it up to you in Barcelona."
and they continued the play around his death.”
Later, John would hear the whining as if it were coming from somewhere else. It was be too embarrassing to associate those desperate, undignified noises with himself.
dressing gown and clothes...”
“Who’s Aaron Ill-Legs, anyway?” asked Mike. “I mean, other than a Dark Wizard and all that.”
Stanford University
“Tell me what you want,” Sherlock said, and the knowledge of what John wanted was a warm pleasure that glowed in his chest and pooled liquid deep in his belly. He licked a delicate wet line up John's cock, flushed and twitching with desire, caught the drip of precum at the tip and tasted bitter salt.
“Good one, Wilkes,” said Anderson.
. But there were no more clicks of the shutter, only Sherlock’s heavy, shaky exhale against John’s face as though he’d been swept up just as thoroughly as John had. John moaned under those peremptory lips, around the imperious tongue surging in to fill John’s mouth. It was intoxicating to be wanted so much. His own need rose up in him, demanding. John gripped Sherlock’s shoulders to pull himself tighter and opened his mouth wider to him, inviting Sherlock into him as deeply as he wanted to go.
Through the stalks of corn, this far from the road, they are completely hidden from view. With only the eyes of God upon them, Sherlock presses John down into the dirt. The sky is orange and purple and red above them, burning.
The two of them stilled, petrified in their bed, listening. And there it was, curling into their ears, seeping into their bones... the ghostly, disembodied voice of a child singing, beautiful and pure, carried on the night wind.
He looks at Victor’s open, expectant face. “Yeah. Okay.”
John, a Buck Rogers fan, tries to engage Sherlock in a conversation about what it must be like to be a Space Wanderer, to be hurtling through the vastness of space at hundreds of miles an hour and then to suddenly break off from everything you’ve ever known and fall, all alone, down to a strange planet. Sherlock says that firstly, space is full of a whole lot of nothing and is therefore completely irrelevant, and that secondly, the Space Wanderer is a rock, and rocks don’t much care about loneliness or separation or anything at all, but he poses for a picture with the giant space-rock with minimal grumbling, so John eventually forgives him his lack of imagination.
“None of that, right, Mike?” Bill said.
“Spread,” he growled.
It’s an impossibility, isn’t it, two boys kissing? It doesn’t feel so impossible when Sherlock slips his tongue - soft, wet, hot - right into his mouth. John didn’t even know you could do that, tongue into another person’s mouth, but it doesn’t feel wrong. It feels just fine. Better than fine.
Stupid brain is broken; Aunt Aggie’s the last person John wants to be thinking about right now. He thankfully doesn’t think of her anymore when Sherlock’s tongue slides against his, Sherlock’s body pressing against him.
“Look,” the young man said, quenching his thoughts. “It’s only going to get darker. It sure isn’t getting any earlier. And I bet you’re a mile, maybe two, out from home still. That’s no trouble to me at all, but you’ve already scraped up your knees and your bike’s unrideable. That’s a real long way to walk alone in the dark.”
John thought about it.
” Sherlock said, his name so quiet, almost reverent, like a prayer upon those faintly pink lips. “You won’t be struck down by lightning if you were to take your crucifix off the wall, you know. You don’t need that to watch over you.”
“That’ll take all night,” John says, already thinking about the most exciting bits of the one with the six Thatchers. The sound of his own voice surprises him after having been silent for so long; it sounds like it belongs to someone else almost, someone who he had been, once, but no longer recognises.
“All right,” said John. “Fine idea. Boss idea. You’re right. It’s none of your beeswax.”
The night was dark and deep and vast, and it swallowed her voice.
plant book with all the graphic illustrations. He thought about Sherlock telling the Bubotuber plant that it needed a better Potions partner, and the way that they had named their slug Rachmaninoff, and he bit his own lip hard.
“Right, time to go home,” said Sherlock tightly. “Come along, John.” He tugged on John’s arm, not in a particularly forceful way, really, but then found this action caused the opposite reaction of John stumbling and sprawling up against him.
“Yes!” John laughs. “That’s so true. I mean, he just slept naked --”
for the Brit-pick.   xxx <3!!
All John remembers about that day is that the sky had been grey. It had all passed over him in a grey haze, and then it was over before he knew it.
Was that right? Could John really have so few photos of himself? He’d been in the military, weren’t soldiers practically contractually obligated to over-document their downtime? Or--Sherlock felt his eyes narrow--had the evidence simply been kept from him?
“It tastes like sweet piss.”
“Gryffindor,” the boy said suddenly, his voice loud and clear. John jumped, startled.
He pressed his face against the soft white cotton of Sherlock’s shirt and breathed him in greedily, savoring the moment.
of the students at Hogwarts are Dark Wizards, potential Dark Wizards, Dark Wizard spawn, or anything of the sort. I shall not have you or any other student using such language or making groundless accusations. Nor do we refer to our fellow Housemates as House traitors. Do you understand?”
“You liked this last time,” he murmured, enjoying John’s little shiver as Sherlock rolled and flicked at the nipple in between his fingers. “Shall we find out just how much? What I can make you do with the right stimulation?”
Madam Pomfrey, however, did not seem to be aware of this sort of very crucial medical equipment. John was very disappointed, until Sherlock - forgetting his promise to behave - needled her about her inability to properly provide for her patients until she eventually came up with a small bag of Bertie Botts’ Every Flavour Beans that had been left behind by a previous patient. Sherlock deemed this as acceptable and dismissed her. It would have been amazing that she actually left when told, if not for the fact that she was only too happy to do so.
“Anderson, don’t talk out loud,” Sherlock said. “You lower the IQ of the whole castle.”
“Sherlock, we were
John smiled. Hazel took his hand to lead him into the kitchen, deeper into the safety of the house, away from the windows with their view of the angry sea.
"It f-feels bad," John says.
“Durmstrang has over
” Mike hissed. John turned to see Sherlock walking down the hall, gripping his small stack of books tightly to his chest, head held high.
He had his hand on the door handle before they even came to a complete stop.
you?”
“Planes and ships, I think,” said John. “And men in vans.”
“S-so then control me, why don’t you,” John said, face hot but managing the words - mostly sounding smooth, he thought, with only the slightest stutter.
“Oh, you know him,” Victor says, waving his hand dismissively. “Always saying horrible things. ‘I don’t have friends,’ like, really, who are you trying to kid?”
“Well, if you ever want to grow up, you should stay away from Sherlock Holmes,” Bill said decisively. “It’s not just the looks, John. Sherlock does creepy stuff. Everybody knows he did experiments on his playmates. Just ask poor Morwen, she lost
Sherlock scraped his teeth along the sensitive skin of John’s throat and then bit him, at the junction of neck and throat, teeth sinking in for a moment. John cried out, arching his head back, chains jangling as he pulled at them suddenly. Sherlock sucked a harsh kiss over the mark he’d left there, deepening the bruise. John’s hips moved uselessly, seeking him out for friction.
“Pouring one out for my fallen Holmies,” he says, with complete and utter solemnity. John laughs so hard at the absurdity of it all that he falls off his stool. Victor laughs so hard at John falling off that he falls off about ten seconds later.
“Almost ten hours, if you went to sleep right when you said you were going to bed,” Victor replies. He flips the bacon in the pan effortlessly. “You were tired. I didn’t want to wake you. How do you like your eggs?”
Victor pokes around the flat while John sips at his awful tea and watches him, rediscovering Sherlock through another’s eyes. Victor laughs at the bullets in the wall, (“You need to be more careful with your firearms, John. Although I was always the better shot of the two of us.”), examines the letters (“Oh! He still does the knife thing.”), tsk’s at the mutilated game of Cluedo (“Never play with him. A sore loser and a cheater if he thought he could get away with it. I never let him get away with it.”), and picks up the skull (“Why, hello, Billy.”).
