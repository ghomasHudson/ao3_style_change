It could have been any tramp from the street. If not for the wedding ring, which somehow miraculously stayed on the body when most of the flesh didn't.
With a light frown - a habit of his, no doubt - the man patted himself down. Under Dean`s lightly amused stare he pulled out a crumpled pack of cigarettes - "Salem" if Dean is not mistaken. Dean chuckled, the sound fading away in the stifling air.
Dean knew better than anyone on this earth that this was not just another room. And before entering, he hesitated for just a second. He pushed the door open with an expression of extreme stubbornness, too feigned even for him.
There was a crevice in the gate around the theater - deserted and too wrecked for anyone to want to fix it after the war. This crevice was located near the garbage cans, covered with a wood board, and unnoticed by the complete absence of people around. Even with most of the lampposts demolished and with the alley narrow enough, very few people from Dean's former circles wandered here.
Benny, bless his soul, knows exactly what to give them so that they lose the ability to see clearly before they realize that they have also lost their wallets. But which police are you going to go to and say that you got drunk in a pub and woke up without money? What a novelty.
"It`s alright" the man dismissed and just now tore his gaze away from somewhere ahead. He examined himself for weird stains or injuries he could miss in the last minute and a half.
telling him about the wrath of God and the punishment from Heaven. In some sense. Turned inside out and barely in contact with the idea.
On the small Winchester farm, owned by a solitary family of hunters in the fourth generation, it was difficult to hide the involuntary cries and pleas and
The figure looked up at him with the clouded gaze of someone who does not quite feel his body as his own, and everything around him as real. The figure turned out to be a man in his early thirties, and it was hard to imagine what he was thinking if he even was thinking when he heard Dean's voice. If he heard.
He sighed, slumping into the chair opposite Sam, turning the whiskey glass at this and that angle. He shook his head. He pressed the cool glass to his forehead, which was already beginning to throb. It's easier to just stay up, otherwise, he just won't get up in the morning. He doesn't want to set foot in what they call the family grounds, not recently.
As soon as the man sat down next to Dean, whose face barely reflected something between a desire to flee instantly and a desire to drill glass with his glare, it officially became anyone's business, but not Benny's.
The worst part of the whole nickname – Hunter, damn it – was that its essence is closely intertwined with local legends and moral justifications.
The corpse in the photo was hardly anything out of the ordinary — decapitated and slightly battered, here and there were traces of uncareful cuts from some large blade. Like a machete.
There were often hellhounds, curses, visions of what was to come and what did not happen, gore and torment of helpless damned souls — by someone else's hands, he looked with someone else's eyes.
"Alright. I was on shift all night yesterday, and Benny and a few more or less sober regulars can confirm that at least at one o'clock in the morning I was still mopping the floors."
And Dean would rather jump off the bridge on Michigan Avenue than say a word to her about what happened. But he was honest with himself. Bela Talbot probably already knew everything herself. Or maybe she doesn't know right now, but she'll dig up everything she can soon just out of spite. If only he could swallow his own anger, burning its way through his lungs, and extract a couple of details from her…
The catch was that this quiet voice, the rustle of an invisible figure somewhere in his subconscious, an uneasy feeling in his chest made him stop. Not turn back to Bela. Just stop. Freeze, as if expecting an attack.
Two steps away he stumbled to his left as if falling over and throwing his hand in front of him, awkward and sloppy. Accidentally dropped one hand on the stranger`s shoulder almost knocking them both down.
But in contrast with canal rats and thieves, Dean had an excuse for wandering around the pub at this hour. His shift is about to start in about five minutes. Benny is not going to blame him for the delay. Dean admitted - absolutely non-guiltily - that even if Benny will complain, Dean barely is going to listen anyway.
"What's strange?" Cas asked when everyone else at the crime scene ignored the remark for some reason.
"Well, this is strange," Adam, the officer who first found the body, muttered to himself, perhaps not even for the first time, under his breath. Usually, Adam is an extremely inconspicuous and secretive figure who, despite his apparent benevolence, could not help but cause a strange ambiguous premonition in Cas.
She never asked what'd happened and why John Winchester's eldest son had managed to swallow his pride and ask for help. He never told her.
"How do I know?" Dean asked, and Cas didn't answer, just pursed his lips, but that was enough for Dean. "I have my own sources, you might say."
Until the stairs brought him to the door. Simple, wooden. Without a sign and any permanent indicators, it could be another room in the theater.
And there was a moment, raw and naked as an open wound when Dean looked doubtfully into Cas's eyes. Not quite believing that Cas believes
"Detective Milton," today Dean was standing behind the counter, which allowed him to lean forward on his elbows on the polished wooden surface, raise an eyebrow, perhaps with a note of superiority of any owner of the house, and threw a charming smile, with dimples on his cheeks and a barely perceptible wary gleam in his eyes. "To what do I owe for such an honor?"
Benny was aware of that. And he admitted that he was intrigued. But he, like a good bartender (and accountant, and everything else), knew when it was best for him to shut up.
He handed the paper to Anna, and saw the shadow of recognition on her face, noticed the clenched jaw even before her fingers finally closed around the sheet.
Dean Winchester had everything from the above. And a coat a bit big on the shoulders; re-sewed hundreds of times and keeping in one piece by Dean`s faith alone. And magician`s fingers - a gift from God. Or not exactly.
In the essence, this is all you need to know to pick pockets of local drunks near pubs of Chicago - thank God those are more than enough after the war.
And he sat down on one of the bar stools. He bowed his shoulders, dropped his head, and grabbed one of the glasses that Benny hadn`t had time to remove from the bar. He will definitely not touch the contents of this one. He looked at the shimmering of the green and orange lights on the glass, waiting for the expected
Frankly speaking, in comparison with her, in his flannel shirt and a holey coat, he felt like a poor farm boy – which, in fact, he actually was. Which only tugged at his dignity even more.
Bela flashed a smile, bright and fleeting, like a lightning strike outside the window in the middle of the night. With amazing speed, she wrapped the watch with a second handkerchief – safety is always important - and hid it in the inner pocket of her jacket, and, no doubt, the next owner of it will be some poor rich man whose fabulous fortune has atrophied his common sense.
Milton opened the folder, flipped through a few pages, and turned it so that Dean could see the grainy photo in all its gruesome colors.
He lit the cigarette and he made a drag, almost demonstrative. Almost expecting approval - which is ridiculous, honestly.
He swallowed his curiosity about the man's life in front of him like he would swallow a stack of sawdust.
"What are we talking about?" she leaned forward slightly, her elbows on the polished surface of the table, and her face, with sharp and almost predatory features, was caught in a spot of light. "And most importantly, are you ready to pay?"
"How do you..." he stopped in the middle of the sentence only to give Dean a critical look, from the hair whipped into a chaotic nest after a working day to the bare forearms with rolled-up sleeves, to the chest covered with a work shirt, everything that was available to his surgically precise, merciless gaze. As if he could find the answer in the folds of clothes and constellations of freckles, look through and inside. And for a terrific, terrifying moment, Dean almost believed it.
Cas jerked his head violently, stepped back, letting Anna's hand fall, and disappeared through the door, only to settle on the church steps and, in the damp Chicago air, grab onto his tangled hair.
But Dean`s intuition insists that this is not the case. And you`d be surprised how often canal rats rely on flair.
Seeing the face of the newcomer from under his hat, which was quite unnecessarily pulled down, Anna broke into a smile.
When a bar star offers you a drink with a gift of God instead of a voice, you agree. Especially when the offer is not for you alone – and what now, stay in the shadows? Especially when the drinks are on the house.
Or a wait for something promising. Part of Dean, the one that was intuitive and quick-witted and the reason he was alive, that part whispered, that a mysterious
And Cas knew the exact moment when the words passed through Dean, lodged in his seams, in his lungs, and at the base of his throat. There was a moment when Dean's shoulders relaxed, as after a long, long day, and he exhaled noisily as if he didn't know he was holding his breath.
Dean cursed. He completely forgot Castiel had those today. He hadn’t seen the man since last night when he slid next to him in bed way later than he probably should've.
He kissed Dean's bandaged forehead and went back to his apartment. He took the nurse's advise by showering, shaving, eating, and sleeping. He felt a hell of a lot better, if he was being honest.
“At the school,” Castiel said, “fixing my schedule. Which I took care of last week, actually,” Castiel divulged.
“Yeah,” Cas prompted when Dean didn’t immediately start talking. Dean swallowed thickly and looked at Cas.
“I wasn’t. Until today. They messed up my schedule and put me in Biology. They have me in the correct classes now,” Castiel replied.
"Dean? Help, please!" Came a rough voice. Dean found Cas in the hallway, trying to keep out of the smoke. Dean helped him up and Cas limped to the exit with Dean's help.
"Shit...I gotta go Cas, keep yourself healthy," he said hastily, running down the stairs to get to the engine bay.
"Because you love me." She smirked and playfully punched his arm. Dean wondered why people kept doing that.
"Cas," he started, "you're not a bad cook. Or a baby in a trench coat. You're not a corporate douche bag. You're not a mindless desk jockey. You're not just like your family. I know you aren't....that you'd never use your office hours against our marriage. You're not...." Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, "definitely, under no circumstances are you or would you ever be a slut. I shouldn't have said any of that, but I can't make you forget I did. I just want you to know I didn't mean any of it and I hate myself for even thinking any of those things. I get it if you want me out of your sight, hell, I don't wanna see myself for a while, but please.... just...know that I love you, Cas. I always will." Dean finished his apology. His cheeks were stained with tears, but he got it all out in the open. Now he just had to wait for Cas to respond. The shorter man walked over to the bed, grabbed a pillow and gave it to Dean.
Dean swallowed thickly before grabbing the blanket off the back of the couch and tossing it over his legs. He trained his eyes on the screen and tried not to let his mind wander to Cas' completely inappropriate avowal.
“I never had any intention of being surprised by my engagement,” Castiel revealed, a small black box appearing in his hand as he shut the drawer. Dean stopped breathing as he looked from the box to Cas’ face.
When he arrived at the store, there weren't too many cars in the parking lot. Cas checked his watch, noticing it was only 6:30 a.m. He checked to make sure his wallet was in his back pocket before meandering into the store. He needed milk, bread, cereal, sliced turkey, peanut butter, and some sort of candy. Probably M&Ms by the way he'd been feeling lately. He wondered briefly if he had replenished his box of condoms in his nightstand. Honestly, he couldn't even remember the last time he got laid, let alone how many condoms he had left. He added those to the list.
“Oh yeah, dad. Totally. An absolute rager,” he replied, hoping his sarcasm would help him through this conversation. His father laughed.
Although it was truly tempting, Dean took the hint and removed his fingers. He rolled on the condom with ease and stroked his neglected cock with a lubed hand.
The pair ventured deeper into the crowd, talking to people they knew, getting hit on by people they didn't. They danced to the music that was much too loud and sipped their juice. When they finished their drinks, Dean nodded his head towards the kitchen, silently suggesting a refill. Charlie enthusiastically nodded her head and grabbed his hand before dragging him through the crowd. Charlie passed through the threshold into the kitchen and Dean glanced to his right, looking up the stairs. He came to a halt and blinked a few times to make sure he was seeing correctly.
Balthazar asked. He was just starting to like Dean, what with all the stories Castiel told him over their skype sessions. Balthazar knew Castiel could get a little mouthy when he was drunk, but even if they
"I don't think so," Cas chastised, wagging his finger at Dean. The man on the bed threw his head back and groaned, part frustration, part lust.
“Alright, we’re done talking about my eating habits, thank you,” Dean said. Castiel turned to him and gave him a little pout that said
thing about me that isn’t going on my resume. What’s my favorite color? My favorite sport? Who’s my best friend? What’s my favorite meal? Can you answer any of those?” Castiel snapped. Naomi looked taken aback.
Dean broke the kiss and stared into Castiel’s eyes. “You’re gonna feel so good wrapped around my cock.” Dean whispered, scissoring his fingers. Cas whimpered and fucked himself on Dean’s fingers. Dean felt around for that special spot he knew would drive any man mad with pleasure. Cas arched off of the bed with a noisy groan.
“Cas this is Gabe,” he said, pointing to the short one, “and Benny.” He finished. Cas shook both of their hands and smiled.
When they arrived back at the house, it was nearly eleven and Castiel needed to get some sleep if he was going to have to survive an entire day of school before the party. Balthazar, having been accustomed to his new college schedule, asked Castiel to play a little hooky.
Jo was alone in the tv room when Dean showed up. He sat down on the couch and joined her in watching whatever was on cable.
“I might need to borrow a pair of underwear,” Cas said after a few moments of silence. He felt Dean’s laugh more than he heard it, and suddenly Dean sat up, cradling Cas' head in his hands. He kissed him deeply before sliding out of bed. As he walked over to his dresser, he carefully tucked himself back in. Cas grabbed his phone off the nightstand and set an alarm. Dean snatched a pair of boxers out of the drawer and gave them to Cas.
“Pshh!” Dean threw his hands up like whatever it was he was trying to say was obvious, “and we work together!” Another long, expectant pause.
“Thank you, Balthazar. I’ll be sure to keep in better touch. Drive safe.” Castiel said as he walked his friend to the door. They waved and Cas retreated back into his apartment.
“The more you refuse, the worse it’s going to be,” she said. Castiel’s mind was bouncing off the walls. Was this really happening? Was Naomi actually going to hit him with a ruler? Surely this was just a dream. He was still at Dean’s house and he just happened to have dozed off. This wasn’t real. Castiel knew this was an old trick up the catholic-school’s sleeve. Naomi was sent to one as a child, and she had threatened many times to send Castiel to one, too. But, surely this wasn’t actually happening to him right now.
“Now, there’s no need to throw around the ‘H’ word, Chuckles,” he pacified. He didn’t want her hacking him. For
The fireman was beautiful like his; his flushed cheeks, his dilated eyes. Cas peered into Dean's eyes and found nothing but adoration and love. He smiled to himself before dipping down and trailing kisses along Dean's torso. After a few minutes of teasing, Cas removed Dean’s sweatpants, revealing that Dean was, in fact, not wearing any underwear.
His head whipped to the closed bathroom door when he heard Naomi storm into his room. The sudden movement had him dashing back towards the toilet. He barely managed to open it before he went another round against his stomach.
“We haven’t done this in a week.” Cas said, placing his hands on Dean’s chest, careful to put more weight on his left hand.
“Pictionary? That’s just charades, but worse!” Gabriel complained, sprawling out on the couch, obviously not impressed, “Chuckles,” he called to the kitchen, “remind me when it’s my turn to choose the game.”
“Oh, yeah, is that it?” he said through a laugh, “alright, I’ll text you tomorrow to confirm Naomi has left the building...and the state.”
“Yeah. Charming, cute, smart, funny, well-mannered. It’s hard to come by people like that. Believe me,” she said. As that bag of popcorn finished popping, she pulled it out of the microwave and threw it at Castiel. He caught it purely on instinct and poured the contents into the bowl Charlie placed in front of him. It smelled delicious. Charlie put the second bag in the microwave.
He pulled open the top left drawer and was pleased to see that he had located Dean’s shirt drawer on the first try. He pulled out a dark gray t-shirt and held it to his chest. He snickered at the logo on the front.
“Don’t be a prude, Joey,” Gabriel said, “that’s exactly what I want them to do. Either they kiss and prove to me they are actually in love, or no one gets any of my money.”
“The summer before sophomore year,” Castiel answered, “it would've been freshman year for you,” he added. Samandriel’s eyes lit up at the memory of their friendship.
“You’re not going to wear another tasteless band shirt, are you?” Castiel piped up. Charlie gasped and looked at Castiel. Dean winked at his boyfriend while Charlie’s head was turned.
The teen pulled out his headphones and made his way to the living room. When he got there, Naomi and his father were sitting on the couch, leaving him to take the armchair. They did this every time they wanted to have a ‘family meeting’. These usually turned out to be less ‘family meeting’ and more ‘Castiel is in trouble for something totally superfluous’. They’ve been doing this since his father married Naomi a few years ago when Castiel was in eighth grade. Castiel was less than pleased, to say the least. Often times, he was cold with Naomi, going so far as to outright ignore her. It didn't help that she treated him like a second class human being, or that eighth graders were moody to begin with. She also blatantly preferred his older brother, Michael, which only angered Castiel further.
“You’re not displacing anyone, honey, you’ve been through more than someone your age should have to. Did you grab your school stuff before you left?” she asked.
,” she said the last sentence in a horrible russian accent while making the zipper motion over her lips. Castiel didn’t understand the reference to one of Charlie’s favorite movies
The layout of Middlefield High was rather simple. The school itself was relatively small, the grades holding no more than 80 students each. Dean recalled a few schools he attended in his youth that had upwards of 600 per grade. He much preferred the smaller setting.
Dean sniffed his cup and shrugged. It smelled fruity. He was surprised that he couldn’t even taste the alcohol. He understood why the sophomores couldn’t pace themselves; the drink was delicious. If he hadn’t already made the mistake of overdoing it on the mixed drinks his sophomore year, he would’ve been on his second cup by now.
“I don’t mean to be blunt, but, uh, doesn’t that place cost a lot of money?” Dean asked. Cas tucked his chin and smiled.
“Are you asking me or telling me?” Dean chuckled. “And rabbit food? Who are you, my brother?” He teased.
“So I guess this means I won’t have anyone to bone on a whim,” Balthazar remarked, trying to ease the tension a little bit. A laugh escaped from Castiel.
“Happy?” Dean shook his head, “Joyful?” another shake, “fuck, uhh...winter? Cold? Uhh..snow?” Castiel was really lost on this one. Dean traced over the smiles on the stick figures again, “Happy? No, I said that already. Smiles! Party? Um..shit...it’s Christmas...oh! Merry!” Castiel guessed. Dean beamed and nodded his head. Cas jumped up from the couch in excitement. Dean went back to his second drawing, pointed at a stick figure, and then Cas.
“I love you, too, Dean,” Castiel said, voice dripping in want. He planted another solid kiss to Dean’s mouth before finally pushing inside. He ate up Dean’s moan, hands steadying on the restrained man’s hips. Once he was fully inside, he gave Dean a brief moment to adjust.
“Fuck yeah, Cas, just like that,” Dean panted, clutching at the sheets. Castiel continued slamming his hips into Dean, filthy smacking sounds filling the room. Dean was letting out a string of provocative little moans, turning Cas on further.
At first, he just drove around, trying to calm himself down so he could think. Long after the sun had set, he made his way to Dean's house.
,” Castiel replied, failing at his attempt to play it off as a joke. He finally made eye contact with Mary, noticing her skeptical look. “Bad joke?” Castiel tried brushing it off. Mary shook her head and resumed scrubbing the dishes. After a moment of silent cleaning between the two, she spoke up again.
?” Bartholomew snapped. Naomi scoffed, obviously offended. Before she could get another word in, Bart continued, “My son is in the hospital on Christmas Day because
Dean seemed to be recovering well, complaining less and less about the god awful casts each day. As the fireman nodded off while leaning his head on Cas’s shoulder, Cas couldn’t help but think that there was no place he’d rather be.
He sighed and resigned himself to a day of wet clothes and bitter hatred toward anyone who even went
“Thanks, dad. But I didn’t do it by myself,” Castiel said, squeezing Dean’s hand. His father chuckled and ran a hand through his son’s hair.
It didn’t take more than a handful of thrusts after that for Dean to spill all over his chest. Castiel fucked into Dean harder, chasing his own orgasm. He gave two more powerful thrusts before grinding his hips into Dean and coming harder than he had...probably ever.
“Uh, yeah, sure. I can do tonight,” Dean confirmed. She smiled at him and returned to her classroom once the bell had rung. Dean sat at his desk a little disappointed. He thought maybe Cas had planned something for just the two of them tonight. He figured he was wrong and greeted his students as the last one slunk in.
“Damn, baby, you’re so tight. You feel so damn good,” Dean said before groaning as Cas rolled his hips up, cueing Dean to get the fuck on with it.
“But then we found out about your little betting pool...serves you guys right for placing bets on us like we’re some kind of...uh...thing you place bets on,” Dean wittily replied.
Dean curled up in the center of the bed, his gaze soft in the direction of the closet. He just wanted to be asleep. He didn’t want to think about the day he’d had, and he didn’t want to think about the day to come.
“Yes,” she replied simply. Castiel’s eyes grew wide and he scoffed. Naomi was confused. She thought they had finally landed on the same page. Why was he in such a huff all of the sudden?
After having a second to chat, Charlie stood and rounded up the things they needed for the next game. Jo made small talk with Dean while Balthazar flirted with Castiel. At first, Dean was resistant towards flirting with Jo (even though she was basically a physical representation of
“Don’t go using Zachariah as a scapegoat, either, Cas. He might play a hand in stress, but he didn’t put those words in your mouth.” Balthazar gentled his tone and placed a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Look, if you want to keep this Dean around, you’ll have to do some major damage control. I suggest straightening this work thing out first, and go from there.” Cas looked at Balthazar and nodded, incapable of words at the moment.
“You mean sex,” he said flatly. Sam’s blush only deepened. He nodded meekly, not looking Dean in the eye. The older brother laughed; he wasn’t quite sure how to approach this. Sam was only thirteen, afterall. It was Dean’s turn to tease his brother.
The couple traded more sloppy kisses, never seeming to get enough of each other. After a few more long moments, Castiel slipped on boxers and went to the bathroom to get a washcloth. He was disappointed he didn’t have an en suite anymore, but he wasn’t too dismayed, since he basically had the entire basement to himself.
"Castiel, I promise I will personally contact you if anything changes. Now go clean up, he's not going anywhere," she repeated gently. Cas sighed but reluctantly agreed.
“This is just pathetic,” Balthazar said, having watched both Gabriel and Dean drop their cookie at least twice each. Not only was their gameplay pathetic, but the trash talk they were dishing out left something to be desired.
need to miss school for the trial. It happened the second week after break, and as Cas donned that black suit, an air of finality fell over him. Anna tied his tie for him this time, and they all made their way to the hearing.
“Are you just going to keep quoting movies or….” Dean teased, finding it easy to talk to Charlie. She laughed and rolled her eyes. Dean checked his watch and glanced around the empty room.
Castiel buried his face into Dean’s shoulder when the man added a third finger. His throat making noises on its own volition. He knew Dean liked it when he was vocal, and damn did he enjoy when Dean was confident.
“Are you kidding? Don’t you remember Michael’s ACT prep? I don’t think she let him out of the house for a week!” Castiel was confused. He doesn’t remember Naomi being a part of that at all.
“So, yeah, I’m gonna need a little more background on the ‘night games’ thing,” Castiel prompted, utterly confused by the last two minutes. Dean grinned widely. Then his eyebrows drew together and his smile faded.
“For a kiss,” Dean bargained cheekily. Castiel laughed and leaned down to kiss him roughly. They forgot about the tie for a few minutes as they just traded kisses, not able to get enough of each other. Soon enough, Castiel remembered his task and pulled back. Dean pouted, but Castiel ignored him in favor of tying up his hands. It wasn’t anything fancy, Castiel not exactly experienced in doing the
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said, craning his neck so Castiel could kiss him on the lips. A fire ignited at those words; Cas hitched their legs up, allowing him a bit more leverage to hit that sweet spot inside of Dean.
“No, son. You get to get dunked.” Rufus said, his voice the closest to gleeful as Dean had ever heard it. The other man clapped his hand on Dean’s shoulder and wandered around, greeting families.
“Well I guess that makes two of us.” Came Dean’s pleased remark. Cas smiled and kissed Dean on the lips again.
“I have been waiting for hours for you to come home,” Naomi stated, as if she were staying up just because she was worried. Castiel knew better. He knew she waited up for him because she liked to be in control, and if Naomi didn’t know where he was at all times, she wasn’t in control of him.
“Mmmm, since right before dinner,” Dean moaned. Castiel claimed his lips roughly and pushed the panties to the side. He teased Dean with the plug, pulling it out ever so slowly before pushing it swiftly right back in. He wasn’t going to let Dean get away with this that easily.
. He didn’t have time to question it either as at that moment, the popcorn was finished popping and Charlie once again threw Castiel the bag to pour out while she salted the previous bowl.
“You guys are...are getting a divorce?” Castiel asked. Out of all the things his father could have said, he certainly was not expecting that. Bart nodded solemnly, and Castiel really had to restrain himself from letting out a whoop of victory.
When Castiel was ready, he pulled back and looked at Dean. His boyfriend smiled and leaned in for a sweet kiss.
to let your teenager’s significant other stay the night?” The teen in question just looked hopefully at his mother.
“Not that I don’t love this,” Castiel said breathlessly, “but what’s the occasion?” Dean growled and pushed his hips further into Cas, both of their erections singing at the friction.
“And this must be Anna,” she pulled the woman into a hug, surprising Castiel...and by the looks of it, Anna as well. “She’s beautiful, Michael.”
“With that attitude, yes,” Balthazar shot back. Castiel rolled his eyes and flopped his head back. After a few minutes, the two boys pulled up to Balthazar’s apartment building.
as he did to Charlie. Then he reprimanded himself for thinking such things. Of course Dean would focus on
“You didn’t even save room for my famous apple pie?” Mary asked, setting it on the table right in front of Dean. She laughed at her eldest son, practically seeing the gears in his mind turn to figure out how he could fit in a slice.
Between his schoolwork and holiday prep, Castiel barely had any time for himself. Or for Dean. They tried planning dates, but every time Castiel thought he’d had a spare hour, Naomi swooped in with some new task.
Cas smiled and opened the door wider for Dean. They both walked into the living room and Dean sat on the couch. Cas laid down with his head in Dean’s lap. He looked up into Dean’s bright green eyes.
He went back downstairs and double checked that everything was in order. He went into the kitchen and pulled out the food, placing the boxes on the table while he pulled down plates and set the table. He put the box that held the watch in his chair with the intentions to give it to Cas after their dinner. He sat down and waiting for the door to open. After about five minutes, Cas walked through the door. Dean heard the thunk of Cas's brief case followed by an intake of breath. He heard the footsteps move into the living room, getting closer and closer to the kitchen. Cas appeared in the archway, taking in his surroundings with awe. Cas's gaze eventually landed on Dean.
An hour or so later, Castiel and Anna moved their party to the basement, seeking a small refuge from the company upstairs. Naomi had brought out pumpkin pie, which sparked a fun discussion about how “today’s youth need to stop making up all those food allergies”, which then somehow turned into the classic “kids can’t do anything that isn’t on their phone”. Needless to say, Castiel had had his fill of this particular family gathering.
“My girlfriend, Gilda.” Charlie answered. Castiel would be lying if he said he didn’t think Charlie was at least bi. He smiled at his functioning
“So, Castiel, we’re at a sort of crossroads here,” Mary said, “there’s quite a few options you can take, and depending on your results, you might not have too much time to make them.”
“Naomi…” he started, nervously looking at the other occupants in the room. He wasn’t ready to relive it. He wasn’t ready to admit what happened. He still wasn’t entirely sure it did happen.
“Naomi, this doesn’t have to be the end of the road. We work well together, and we’ve built something solid that I think we can continue to improve. But it’s going to take some work. Especially between you and Castiel. There has to be some common ground between you two, but you have to be willing to compromise,” Bart explained.
He took a deep breath. There were mixed emotions about this note. He was relieved, of course, that Cas had a reason for not replying to Dean’s text messages. At the same time, though, he recalled their meeting at Cas' locker and Dean couldn’t see why Cas couldn’t have just told him then.
“Noted,” he replied with a tight smile. She kept eye contact for another moment before calling out for Bartholomew. He came down the stairs and put his shoes on.
Cas woke up to the sounds of sniffling in the bathroom. He turned to look at the clock, blinking several times to try to clear the fuzz that seemed to have glazed over his eyes. Once it cleared, he could see the clock that read 5:48. It was still early, but he couldn't fall back asleep with those noises coming from behind the bathroom door. All in a rush the night before came back to him. The fighting, the words, the anger. He flung back the sheets and padded over to the door, knocking quietly.
50 points to anyone who recognizes the chapter title (and thanks for coming back to read another one of my fics!)
“Mhmm, well I'm not gonna wring it out of you. If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to,” she said, returning her attention to the task at hand.
"Haaaave you met Castiel?" Balthazar asked the man, winking at Cas again as he left to mingle with the other poor souls in the bar.
“I rather enjoy finally having someone else here who has taste,” Balthazar defended. The others complained about being lumped in with Gabriel, and Balthazar missed the glare Dean threw him as he smiled warmly at Cas.
Before long, Castiel picked up his pace, thrusting into his boyfriend at a brutal pace. Dean adjusted his grip on the tie and held on for dear life. He moved his hips slightly, remembering that if he did...just… “That!” Dean exclaimed, “There, there, oh fuck, Cas, yes!”
"Uhh, ha. Busy. A lot of paperwork. Countless boring meetings to endure. But hey, I finally have a clean house to come home to." Cas smiled and winked at Dean. The light haired man ducked his head and smiled. After both men finished eating, Dean stood up and cleared the table, Cas following him to the sink.
“She...hit me...last night. Got me pretty good,” he admitted, not being able to say much more without breaking down into tears.
“By yourself? Or with someone else?” Castiel investigated further. He started slowly unbuttoning Dean’s jeans, waiting for him to answer.
“And what does that have to do with me? Bartholomew, your children are grown up. They don’t need you around all the time.”
That’s all the farther Dean got before Cas exited out of his texts and pulled up a different app. Dean silently reprimanded himself for invading Cas' privacy. He knew that there was a slight blush in his cheeks and probably his ears, as well. What did Balthazar mean when he said ‘someone like Dean to distract you’. What was Dean like? How was he distracting Castiel? He shook his head of those thoughts and focused on what he had turned to Cas to ask.
“I don’t know,” the brit parsed, his hands folded together as he tapped his lips with his index fingers. “You know I don’t bet on romance pools.”
“You know, you never told me where you got that hickey,” Balthazar said, eyes dropping down to Cas’ neck. The bruise had since faded, but Castiel’s hand went to rub at where it had been. He felt sweat starting to prickle at his hairline. He blushed and looked away, trying to think of how to reply to his coworker.
Dean tucked his chin and smiled, a blush forming at his cheeks. Suddenly, his thoughts seemed to rationalize, and he calmed down about his and Cas' relationship. He was still irritated by Cas' attitude, but getting the reassurance that it would pass was comforting. Of course he didn’t know everything about Castiel, and Castiel sure as hell didn’t know everything about him. They had only been dating for a few months, there was only so much you could learn about a person in that amount of time. Dean opened his door and the boys walked into the house together.
“Hello, Castiel. I was wondering if you had any cravings for lunch? I could make that pasta dish you like,” she offered. Castiel just shrugged and continued staring at the wall.
“I didn’t want anyone to know in case it got back to Naomi,” Castiel explained, fear obvious in his eyes. Mary’s expression softened at Castiel’s confession. “You’re not going to tell her, are you?” he asked nervously.
should, Cas smacked his boyfriend’s ass and walked out of the bedroom. Dean let out an involuntary yelp (“it was not a yelp, Cas...it was a short outburst of surprise” “whatever helps you sleep at night”) and turned to see Cas leaving. He followed his boyfriend into the den.
“Yeah, and the summer bash is in like a month, so the fire department has to plan for that,” Dean continued, informing Cas of his foreseeable schedule.
“You haven’t...relieved yourself?” Cas asked, teasing Dean with slow strokes up and down Dean’s still-clothed length. Dean breathed out a short laugh.
"I'm Dean" he announced. "I'd shake your hand but..." he trailed off, bringing attention to his wrists. "Ya know, when the cop leaves and the lights go out, that's your cue to get the hell out." Dean says. Castiel just shrugs.
Dean noticed a Castiel-shaped lump on the couch and silently made his way to the fridge. He was able to make himself a sandwich with minimal noise, choosing to stand at the counter and eat it since the table was overrun with clothes.
“That’s fine. I can think of another way to...satisfy you,” he said, retreating slightly and kissing the inside of Castiel’s thigh. He didn’t spend a lot of time there before setting his sights on the real prize. He started with the tip. Just barely pushing it passed his lips before pulling it out and doing it over and over and over until Castiel was begging him to take more.
Dean laughed and stood up, placing the bill for his tab on the counter. He flagged down Jo and told her he was leaving.
better way than a knock on the door.” Cas grinned and they made their way to the bedroom with substantially less bruises than last time. Dean slipped off his shoes, jacket, and jeans and followed Cas under the covers.
Tears welled up in his eyes, but they didn’t get much farther than that. He’d cried his fair share these past couple of days; he supposed his tear ducts might be approaching empty. He didn’t really want to cry again either; crying just gave him more headaches.
“How can I stay asleep when it smells so wonderful out here?” Cas said before kissing the back of Dean’s neck. He rested his cheek on Dean’s shoulder. Dean grinned widely.
“If only,” he said, finally examining what was inside his cup. He made a face, but kept holding it so his hands could warm up. “Got anything a little stronger?”
he thought to himself. He folded the scrap of paper and stashed it in his pocket before he walked out to his beast of a car and headed to the store.
“Lay down,” Castiel commanded, moving so Dean could rest his head against the pillows. “Finish taking your pants off,” the English teacher instructed, focusing on the belt in his hands. It’d been a while since they’d used it in bed, Castiel not really into pain in the bedroom. But Dean wasn’t asking for pain, he was asking for restraint. He was asking for Castiel’s dominance; and
“Uh, hey...I’m not gonna beat around the bush. I know you’re out of the closet here, obviously since you and Sam are dating, but I’m not out to anyone. I
"Who was that?" Dean asked as he sat next to Cas on the couch. He picked up a piece of popcorn and threw it up in the air before catching it in his mouth. Cas rolled his eyes fondly and replied.
“Just like that, Dean,” Cas encouraged, fisting the sheets as Dean added a second finger. With his free hand, Dean took Cas into his hand and started a frustratingly slow pace. He scissored his fingers, stretching Castiel further. At Cas' enthusiastic moans, Dean added a third finger, watching as the digits slid in and out.
"How did you...." Castiel is amazed by the size of this place. He's even more impressed he didn't notice it from the ground.
“You will always be invited,” Balthazar said, taking Castiel’s hand and placing a suave kiss to the back of it, “
“No, she left to pursue writing. But the rumor that she was in a relationship with Mr. Shurley was just that: a rumor. I’m fairly certain they were co-authoring a book, which might explain the time they spent together,” Balthazar revealed.
“We’ll be down in a second,” she said, shooing Michael out of the room. Turning to the younger Novak brother, she took a few steps in his direction. Her voice low, she started, “Castiel, I-” she hesitated, internal turmoil clearly showing in her green eyes as they darted to the side, “...I’ll see you at dinner,” she said finally, putting a hand on his shoulder. She gave it a gentle squeeze before following her boyfriend down to the kitchen.
Dean took his stance and started the game. Jo and Balthazar had him guess ‘taking a selfie’ and ‘throwing a snowball’ fairly easily, but faltered when they were given ‘acrobatics’. He passed it eventually, and a few words later, ‘birthday’ popped up.
Castiel raised a single eyebrow and turned around, heading back to bed without another look towards his boyfriend.
The next morning, Dean woke Cas up with small kisses and wandering hands for another round. After breakfast and a shower that probably took longer than it needed to, they said their farewells at the door.
“In Sam’s room,” Dean said. Castiel exited the bedroom and marched upstairs. He saw Sam sitting outside of a closed door.
Castiel collapsed on top of Dean, unbothered by the mess between them. They lay like that for a while, catching their breath.
“Um...thanks? I guess,” Castiel replied. “Why do you assume I’m gay?” Castiel asked nervously, fearing that he was so easy to read. She just shrugged and gave him a once-over.
“Well, I might’ve done some sleuthing, and he only lives like twenty miles away from my house - max! And it’s in the same area as Balthazar.”
The more time Cas spent with her, the more confused he became. Should he be afraid of her? Should he be friends with her? Should he duck and hide any time someone mentioned her name? It was truly exhausting.
It was now well past ten p.m. and the credits started to roll on the fifth movie: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
“Uhh...squirrels. Ran out of nice socks this morning,” he explained, casting a glare at his boyfriend. Cas seemed to read the message and had the decency to look at least a little guilty. He covered it by taking a sip of his wine.
“Oh,” of course, Dean was disappointed, but he understood. “You’ll still be able to come over tomorrow
“Yes, yes, a million times, yes!” He replied. The men stood there on the porch, just staring at each other for what seemed like hours, but were really only a few seconds.
“Hey, just the guys I wanted to see,” Alfie greeted, followed shortly after by Sam. The boys said their hellos and Alfie took a seat on the recliner closest to the couch. “So, summer’s ending here pretty quick,” he said, folding his hands and setting his elbows on his knees, “and on the second to last day of summer, I always have a group come up to my neighborhood and play night games,” Alfie said with a smile. Dean grinned widely as well and looked at Cas.
"Caaas," Dean complained, running his hands through his hair. This man was going to kill him. How could he be so cruel as to leave Dean dripping, fully erect. Cas emerged out of the closet, wearing only boxers. Dean approved of the new outfit. Then he noticed something in Cas's hands.
“My dad owns an insurance company. Naomi does something in that realm as well...I’m not exactly sure what. And my brother is employed under Naomi,” Cas explained. Dean’s eyebrows raised on their own accord.
“And you don’t think maybe they’re just good friends?” Balthazar suggested hopefully. Castiel deserved something nice, and if that thing was a cute boy, then so be it.
“Woah, hello there, Cassie,” Balthazar said in greeting through a laugh. He squeezed tight for a few long moments before letting go.
Dean chuckled and tried to slide out from under Cas. The problem was their skin was pretty much stuck together. He eventually managed to escape the warm arms of his boyfriend. Not that he wanted to. He took a quick shower and dressed in his uniform. Cas was still sound asleep on the couch.
“Well, I wouldn’t want you getting grounded the first week of summer vacation. We better hurry up,” Castiel said.
“Oh hell no,” Dean said, blocking Cas' path. “You really think I'm going to let you drive home like this?” Dean asked incredulously.
“Well, he’s always welcome to come over here and have some of my pie,” Mary offered. Dean smiled into his next bite.
“You told me you were working on lesson plans,” Castiel said between kisses. Dean started a laugh, but it turned into a moan when Castiel thrusted the plug back into his ass.
Dean, on the other hand, had lunch with Lisa Braeden, a pretty brunette who taught art; Jo Harvelle, a spirited blonde that taught 9th and 10th grade math; Jody Mills, an older woman teaching health; and Garth Fitzgerald, a string bean with legs who was the school’s guidance counselor.
“You’ll have to try harder than that to get rid of me,” Cas teased, “I’ll see you at school on Monday.”
Castiel folded his arms in front of himself and squinted his eyes in confusion. Apparently, Naomi was resorting back to her micromanagement tendencies.
Castiel knew that was a big, fat lie. In the four years they’d been dating, Dean’s birthday had always been an
“Why do you-” Cas inhaled sharply when Dean moved his leg slightly, brushing over a certain part of his anatomy. “Well that’s embarrassing,” Castiel whispered. Dean leaned down and kissed him solidly.
He felt his cheeks heat up ever so slightly as he read and reread the text again and again. As much as Castiel wanted to keep these messages, he knew if Naomi took his phone, she’d go through it and then he’d really be in trouble. He deleted the conversation and plugged his phone in. Castiel pulled up his covers and tried not to think about what he was going to have to put up with tomorrow.
“Is it because of Castiel?” Alfie asked from the backseat. Dean slammed on the brakes, causing the passengers to be jerked forward in their seats, not expecting the sudden stop.
” Dean trailed off, leaning in to finally capture Cas’ lips with his own. The English teacher sighed into it, wrapping one hand around Dean’s neck as he deepened the kiss. After a few long moments, Castiel pulled away.
"You're so tight Cas. Feel so good wrapped around me." Dean says. He changes his angle slightly, causing him to slam into Cas's prostate which each thrust.
He was confused when he didn’t see Castiel right away. His confusion didn’t last long, as he heard the toilet flush. Castiel opened the bathroom door, and sighed deeply when he saw his boyfriend standing there. That didn’t bode well for Dean. The cowboy tracked his boyfriend as he made his way over to his bed. With a dramatic flop, Castiel went face-first into his pillows.
kidding me?” he shouted, leaving the two idiots in favor of getting some fresh air in the backyard. Both boys stared after Castiel, watching him exit the back door onto the patio.
“That’s bullshit and we both know it! I won’t let you stand there and lecture me about falling in love. So what if it’s with a man? I’m not ashamed of that! I’m only ashamed I let you stand in the way of me telling my dad,” Castiel said. Naomi clicked her tongue disapprovingly.
Castiel pulled into the school parking lot at 7:47am, which left him thirteen minutes before he needed to be in class. Cas spotted Dean’s car parked in its usual spot. He felt like he had to talk to someone before he went inside. Dean wasn’t an option for obvious reasons, Balthazar didn’t know enough about Dean to help him, and Cas wasn’t about to go to Dean’s little brother, either. That left him with only one person to contact. He pulled out his phone and opened snapchat. He sent a message to Charlie.
Castiel rolled his eyes and turned to Dean. “Really? Me and Benny? You’re worried about that?” he asked teasingly, his eyebrows reaching towards his hairline. Dean blushed further and brought his hand to the back of his neck. Castiel crowded Dean against his car and took his hands. Benny took that as his cue to leave, and headed back to the bar.
“Oh no!” she said, scrunching her eyebrows together, seemingly trying to find a solution for her coworker. As soon as an idea popped into her head, she turned to face Dean.
While the shower left something to be desired, the tub was actually quite nice to soak in. Castiel had never been one for baths, but there was something to be said about bathing with a partner.
“Technically, Balthazar caused that,” Castiel amended, “but I understand what you meant.” The pair smiled softly at each other. Dean leaned in and kissed his boyfriend gently. Castiel moved his leg so that he mirrored Dean’s position. He leaned back in and kissed Dean. He smiled a little bit into the kiss, relieved that they had sorted this whole thing out. Soon enough, the kisses turned from sweet to desperate. After all, Castiel had expected to get laid last night...he was a little overdue for this. And, judging by the way Dean kissed back, he had no objections either.
“What’s that supposed to mean? C’mon, it’s Friday! You should be celebrating,” she told him. A bitter laugh escaped him as he pulled out his laptop from his bag.
“Where have you been?” Castiel asked, obviously worried, “the snow is really coming down now, I kept imagining you in a ditch somewhere just-” Dean cut him off by wrapping his arms around Cas’ neck. Castiel hugged back immediately, burying his face in Dean the crook of Dean’s neck.
“Good. Then this is practically fool-proof,” Charlie said, still staring at all the parts under the hood.
“You know what? No. I rather enjoy this little ruse you’re putting on. I want to help you,” he stated.
“Well, there’s snacks in the dining room if you guys get hungry,” Charlie said, going to set up the first game.
She pulled into the parking lot, noting a single, black car parked under one of the lamps. She approached it, willing to wage a hefty amount that that car belonged to Dean. She had a fleeting thought that this looked an awful lot like a drug deal.
“That wasn’t just a friend. It was my boyfriend,” Cas admitted. He swallowed thickly. There it was. Out in the open.
With half-drunk slushies in their stomachs, the overall feeling of embarrassment seemed to fade from Castiel.
“You guys are unbelievable.” Dean said as he stood up and left the room. He realized belatedly that leaving those three alone wouldn’t be a very good idea. He didn’t need this at five in the goddamn morning.
Too soon, Dean pulled his fingers out completely, and repositioned himself. He guided Cas’ hips up as he knelt in front of the man, allowing Cas to sit back down on Dean’s thighs. Dean lined himself up and teased Cas’ tight ring of muscle, dragging his tip across the sensitive skin.
Gleaming under the praise, Dean popped off, knowing what Castiel really wanted from him. He slipped off the couch and sat on his knees, inviting Castiel with a look. His boyfriend smiled, placing a hard kiss to Dean’s already swollen lips before getting up from the couch.
Confused, Castiel tried to recall the night before. He had snuck out and gone to Ash’s party. Getting there was a bitch, too, since he didn’t have his keys or his phone. He ended up walking almost three of the fifteen miles it took to reach Ash’s house. Luckily, someone from school had noticed him and offered him a ride.
She wrestled with her own thoughts for several long seconds, trying desperately to think of even one thing to say to him.
“Gotta defend their honor. I wouldn’t let some stuck-up prick diss my favorite band and get away with it,” Dean said, leaning against the door jamb. Castiel shook his head and returned to his task.
"Busy night?" She said with a cheeky grin and a wink. And with that, she went around the bar to serve the other patrons. Dean scoffed and looked down into his glass of whisky.
"I will give you one more chance to say the right thing," she said, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.
It appeared that nobody suspected Dean as the “mystery lover” (at least, nobody asked him outright if he was the one who put the hickey there), so he wasn’t too put off by the gossip.
“Oh, come on, Dean. You have to eat! You can’t just sit in your room and worry about Cas,” Charlie told him.
“What did I do to deserve you?” Dean said so quietly, Cas could barely hear him. He wondered if he was
“It’s alright, text me when you get home?” Dean asked. Castiel couldn’t say no when Dean did that with his eyes.
“This is so messed up. We’re seniors in high school, this shouldn’t be happening to us,” Dean complained, “and mom stuck me in here just because I cursed a few times, and yelled at Cas' dad, and
“I want you and all of these files out of my office and I don’t want to see your ugly mug in this floor for a month. You do realize that I am of higher rank, correct?” Castiel asked rhetorically. “You also realize that I could fire you so fast it would leave your head spinning.” Zachariah bowed his head, did as he was told, and left Cas’s office with armfuls of paperwork.
“Well, I’ll go give him a stern talking to,” Castiel joked, the irony in that statement not lost on him. Mary gave a small laugh.
The biology teacher passed the phone to Jo, who won an impressive ten points for her team. Even though Dean was the one who seemed to be helping her guess the best, Castiel could sense that he was still upset about something. That little voice in the back of Cas’ mind crept up again, telling him that he was forgetting something. This time, the English teacher couldn’t blame it on the stress of his upcoming evaluation. He had passed that with flying colors (if his meeting with the principal was anything to go by).
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Castiel waved off, “I’m just thinking about how I’ll be able to get home,” he said with a chuckle.
He wanted Dean so badly, but he didn’t know how to ask. Of course, Dean would be over in a heartbeat if Castiel so much as called out his name, but Cas just didn’t know. Things had been...weird between them lately. He just didn’t know how to act around anybody. Everything about Castiel’s life was strained, and his relationship with Dean was no exception.
“We’re making banana bread, could you grab the big mixing bowl from this cabinet for me?” she asked. Dean rolled his eyes; they did have a stool in there for a reason. He shook it off and went upstairs to complete the task. Despite his ‘bad boy’ reputation he tried to live up to, he was actually quite happy to help out his mom.
“And we pick…” Castiel weighed the pros-and-cons and ultimately decided, “Charlie and Jo.” The ladies were shocked that they paired them up. “Look, we weren’t gonna let one of you go up against Dean alone,” Cas explained. Dean protested while the girls nodded their heads in understanding.
"I know all of that. I acknowledge your apology and I'm taking it under consideration. Now get out of my sight." Cas turned on his heel and walked into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.
“No, it's fine...let's just change the subject. Tell me what's been happening with you,” Castiel said. Balthazar could say whatever he wanted, Castiel was wearing headphones.
Castiel grabbed fistfuls of Dean’s open button-down to steady himself as he walked backwards towards the bedroom. The shorter man actually giggled when he nearly tripped over an imaginary bump in the hallway. Dean caught him, wrapping an arm around his back and halting their progress as Cas caught his balance. He filled the time by leaning in to plant a solid kiss to Cas’ lips.
That day, at lunch, Cas and Balthazar were sitting at the table making small talk. The pair had grown closer that week, chatting every morning as they got their workout in. Charlie entered the room and took a seat next to Castiel.
“Hey! They’ve been lying to us the entire time we’ve known them, excuse me for being skeptical!” Gabriel defended, “I want some actual proof before I shell out any of my hard-earned cash!”
“Um, I was having dinner. Then I came out. Naomi-” he cut himself off. Yes, he remembered, but he wasn’t quite ready to relive it. Mary nodded her head and gave him a gentle smile.
The teen was aware of warm hands on his shoulders, his head. He recoiled away from them; he didn’t want to be touched. He got up unsteadily, using the wall to prop himself up. Someone was trying to talk to him, but he couldn’t concentrate. He could still hear Naomi’s voice somewhere in the house. He had to get out. He couldn’t be there a second longer.
“I thought you said you were going to pick me up at six,” Cas said as he slipped into the passenger seat of Charlie’s yellow slug bug.
“If you’re going to act like a petulant child, I will treat you like one,” she said calmly, after having composed herself. Castiel rolled his eyes once again.
Thankfully, they all agreed that it was getting late, so they stood up and said their goodbyes. Castiel even gave Mary a long hug, thanking her for the pie.
"I can see you haven't gotten over whatever this is yet," Dean said, closing the door behind him as he entered the apartment. Cas gave him the finger as he walked back to his nest on the couch. Dean laughed and followed him into the living room. Cas really was a cranky sick person.
Castiel was pulled from his dream by a persistent buzzing noise. He blinked groggily into the dimly lit room and realized the buzzing noise was coming from his phone. He reluctantly rolled out of Dean’s arms and shut off his alarm. He wiped at his eyes, trying to see a bit more clearly. He took a deep breath and rolled onto his side. He watched Dean sleep for a few moments.
“Ahh, do I detect a hint of a smile?” Dean teased as he grabbed Cas’ arm and playfully pulled him towards the living room. Castiel went, only semi-reluctantly, and took a seat on the couch as he was instructed. He tried to suss out what was going on from Mary, but she wasn’t offering any hints.
On Friday morning, Dean rushed into the teacher’s lounge and smacked right into Castiel, knocking all of Cas’ papers to the floor.
Bart sighed and raised his hands placatingly. He brought one hand to his brow while the other dropped to his side. He shook his head.
Cas gently pulled himself off of Dean, standing on shaky legs to grab a washcloth. Dean removed the condom and threw it in the strategically placed waste bin.
He sighed and stared at the wall a bit longer. Sometimes he would close his eyes, but it was never for very long. After a while, there was a faint knock on the door and Mary stepped inside.
“Cassie, your bedroom is like the size of my flat. And I have to share it with my father,” Balthazar said, his eyes darting around the room and up at the lofted ceilings.
Dean was a little put off by how rough Cas's voice sounded. Then he heard coughing before Cas spoke again.
He walked distractedly for either ten minutes or two hours...he wasn’t certain. What he did know was that his cheeks and nose were numb, and he could see tiny snowflakes starting to fall down around him. He took in his surroundings and found that he had...no clue where he was. He shrugged and kept walking, taking a turn down another unfamiliar street.
“Because I was concerned about you,” she replied with an impressively straight face. Castiel gave a short laugh.
Dean moves down from there, dipping his tongue in Cas's navel before pulling the boxer briefs containing his prize down and off of Cas's legs. Cas groans and Dean smiles before he takes Cas into his mouth. Cas gasps at the sudden heat and groans when Dean's tongue licks over his leaking slit. Dean's hand encloses what he can't fit in his mouth as he bobs up and down, causing both of Cas's hands to fist in his hair.
Cas smiled, and let his fingers trace down the back of Dean’s neck, under his shirt. “Of course,” he murmured, before his lips were covered with a finger and then Dean’s lips. Dean swallowed, caught up staring at his miracle. Cas. The way the light played over his closed eyelashed, sharp cheekbones and soft lips. Cas, blissfully unaware, tugged at Dean’s hand, trying to lead him back to their room.
By the time the chair was finished, one thing had led to another - as they are wont to do - and they slept tangled together like the roses in the garden. Instead of knees barely brushing, now it was arms locked around torsos and lips idly resting over the marks they'd made the night before. Dean slept curled around Cas.
Cas pulling him up to a sitting position, straddling the hunter's legs. The pine tree branches pushed into their hair as Cas kissed him, quick and not deeply enough. "Dean," Cas whispered in his ear. "Seeing as this is likely to be our last night alone together-" Dean didn't ask why Cas was so sure Sam would be back in time. "I want to touch you." Cas still hadn't gotten the hang of dirty talk, and Dean made a mental note to fix that sometime. "Want you to make love to me, Dean." The words might be awkward and old fashioned, but damn if they weren't having the desired effect. Dean felt himself growing hard under the angel's thighs. "Want to scream for you." Dean's jaw dropped. Maybe he'd been wrong about the whole dirty talk thing.
Cas’ aim was nearly flawless, but Dean reached up to steady his hand anyway, savoring the press of Cas’ body against his. Cas’ eye was trained intently on the sights of the gun; that laser-like stare which Dean realized was usually aimed at him. “Now shoot,” Dean whispered in his ear, bracing his shoulder.
When he was stretching his arms out, about to bear-tackle Cas to the floor and hold him down, because goddamnit he
“That’s something humans do, isn’t it? It seems interesting.” Cas was leaning against the door behind him. Dean could feel the angel’s eyes flickering over him.
Touch. Their hands were joined, the exquisite pressure of Cas’ fingers against his. Their chests were pressed together, and he could feel Cas’ breath on the side of his cheek. The air hung damp around them, but crackled with something beyond electricity. And Cas’ lips against his… soft and begging to be parted, not nearly close enough to his.
“Maybe we take our chances.” But Jack didn’t look nervous. “Still, Castiel spoke of...” he chose his words carefully. “A profound bond between him and Dean. It’s possible some degree of symbiosis might make it possible for Dean’s grace to live in him permanently.”
Cas pulled out fully before thrusting back in. Dean moaned at the sweet, wet ecstasy of it. One of Cas’ hands came up to rub at Dean’s nipple, and Dean fell apart. “Fuck, Cas, yes. Angel.” Cas nearly purred at the stupid nick-name, and started fucking Dean in earnest. “Fucking love this,” Dean admitted recklessly. And there it was. The final, tattered shred of the elaborate tapestry of denial he’d woven for so man years.
“It is true.” Dean said roughly. “It’s always been true. Cas, me throwing myself in the way of that bullet, it doesn’t mean what you think it does, alright? God, just trust me on that.” Cas looked at him, and his eyes were so soft and blue Dean thought the room might melt around them. “Y’know, I thought something recently,” he began to confess. “‘If I died now, I’d die happy.’ I know,” he said as Cas’ bottom lip trembled, lost its will to stay still, and fell, leaving his lips parted. “But I couldn’t take it back. And Jesus, I didn’t want you to know about it, because after what you said…” Cas took Dean’s hands in his, and something about the way their skin brushed and their knuckles touched and how their hands fit together was almost too much. “You’re still not telling me everything. Come on, Cas. What gives? Please.”
Cas didn’t wake up. Dean dragged the armchair outside, onto the concrete, and set it on fire. Not only was it ugly and pink and ancient, he felt helpless sitting in it. Watching Cas slip farther under. He felt far away. So he tossed his lighter down, and watched the flames spring up. It smelled awful when it burnt. Sam would complain. Say how comfortable it had been or something. Dean blinked smoke away as he watched it crumple into ash.
“Wait, so you’ve never been hot or cold? Felt like you’d get blown away on a windy day?” When Cas didn’t reply, Dean said, “I mean you are pretty skinny.”
Cas shook his head. “Maybe someday.” Assuming Cas didn’t die horrifically, he’d be along for centuries after Dean. Dean frowned, wondering if Cas would stay with Sam and Dean until they were dust in the wind. What a weird thought. “But the monks weren’t the ones who made me question free will and destiny and taught me about humans, Dean.”
Not entirely to his surprise, Castiel was sitting on the floor. Clasped in his hands was a slim book, and he looked almost naked without the long trench coat. Dean stood frozen in the doorway, met with the familiar thought,
"I guess he lost faith," Sam said, lip twitching into the ghost of a smirk. "Or he never cared in the first place."
The small word took Dean by surprise. Cas had always been interested in anything Dean said they should do. “What, why?”
They stayed there until the sun started to rise, tears shining on their faces, half-tangled together, the silence punctuated only by soft kisses and sighs. Cas said as the morning light began to fill the room, “This is what flying feels like.” He broke into a smile.
He heard Cas’ footsteps, and then, with a hunter’s certainty, he knew his quarry was running. He grinned and gave chase, feet thudding and skidding on the bunker floor as he raced along the hallway. The trench coat was still firmly gripped in his hand, streaming behind him as he flat out ran. His chest heaved and his cheeks grew hot. Damnit, he was gonna find that angel. With every room that he passed, a bar of sunlight from the window slid across him before he was moving on.
Dean didn’t sleep after they made love. Instead, he stayed still, feeling Cas’ heart beat against his. The angel’s eyes were closed. Late afternoon light flooded over them, casting shadows across their intertwined bodies. He mapped out Cas’ back with his fingertips, and was rewarded with the occasional light moan or sharp breath. Touching Cas came so naturally. Maybe it was because Cas had rebuilt him and touched his soul after hell. Dean didn’t know. There were a thousand reasons it shouldn’t have been this perfect, this easy. From his own inherent emotional constipation and theoretical heterosexuality to Cas’ angel status to the fucked up world they lived in; this should never have been possible. Somehow, though, the possibility for this, the bond they had had survived it all. He supposed it hadn’t been easy. Hell, purgatory, heaven and death and responsibilities and questions… no. It hadn’t been easy. If Dean hadn’t been such an advocate of free will, of making your own destiny, he might’ve thought it felt like it was meant to be.
He had never been a mere friend to me. I didn't know about 'friends' then. He was only Dean. I had seen his soul, his entire life and being, and I rather admired him. He was broken, of course. A righteous man with a psychotic glint in his eye and a whiskey problem to drown America. I didn’t even know what love felt like. It's understandable, then, when I say that I must have always loved him and only later recognized it for what it was. It is clear to me that before I fell from Grace, before I fell from heaven, I first fell for Dean Winchester. The first time it happened – the first time we – the first time – was that when I fell?
Dean closed his eyes. The song was different, but the bass line was the same. What Cas was saying sounded all too familiar. "You know, a so-called friend of yours once said the moment you laid a hand on me in hell, you were lost."
“No. Dean, I was trying to tell you. I don’t find the idea of intercourse with a stranger appealing.” Cas sighed, cradling his shot glass in his hands as if it were a flower.
Oh, Cas. “Listen to me.” Dean said, gritting his teeth. That painful ache in the back of his throat was not tears wanting to come, he was not going to cry now. “You’re a hero.” Cas let out a low laugh. “What you did wrong, you did it because you cared too much. You tried to do right and that’s the damned best thing any of us ever do. So don’t go out there because you think you’re a bad angel and want to get reinstated as heaven’s bitch, and don’t go out there because you think you failed.” Cas’ face morphed into a tiny flicker of a frown.
Sam drove to Eileen's the second he's welcomed them home and made sure they're okay. Jack left to rebuild Heaven: to grow up like every child does. Cas helped him, his powers returning, the beat of wings in the bunker always announcing his return. Castiel, self-hating angel of Thursday, became heaven's new architect. Jack came home on the weekends. Sometimes he answered prayers, or just sat for hours in a park, letting himself become every one of the raindrops. The four of them bounced between shady motel rooms, never giving up on saving people. Between heaven and Rowena's new hell, between their separate lives and days on the beach watching the ocean. Watching the world they saved. They made their own families, and fought tooth and claw for them. When the end finally came, it was a blaze of glory, but one that never could have cast light without love as its fuel.
This was meant to be pure, unadulterated smut. But I couldn't help writing a fuckton of angst and feelings into it.
Dean shudders at the thought of all the times he might not have had to watch Cas die, if they’d got their act together a little sooner. “So Naomi was brainwashing you to kill me?”
Cas frowned. “At least I used the door this time.” He did have a point. Ordinarily Dean just woke up to the angel staring at him, having teleported inside. “Why are you on the floor?” He tilted his head, staring at Dean like an animal inside a zoo exhibit. Perhaps he thought this was some human custom he had interrupted.
Fuck me, Valentine's Day is going to get divided into three parts, because I couldn't cut down the angsty fluff for this chapter in time to give you sexy times.
Dizzy, realising Dean hasn’t come, Cas pulls Dean to him. He wants nothing more than to give Dean the pleasure Dean just gave him. As he mouths over Dean’s hipbones, though, counting freckles, Dean grabs his fingers and sucks on them. Cas blinks up at him. Flushing a little pink, Dean guides Cas’ hands to between his cheeks. Cas growls when he feels them graze Dean’s entrance, and feels his penis plump up a little at that.
They stood by an oak tree which it took Dean a moment to realize. “This is where I found you,” he said.
“So…” His voice was hoarse, and he thought his heart might jump out of his chest. He’d come to terms with the fact he loved Cas, he’d thought about kissing him and everything else under the sun, he’d said more than once that he needed Cas. But he’d never really thought Cas would ever say those goddamn three words.
Nobody owns him. He followed his Dad, and he takes care of Sam. But beyond that, he's his own man. Just him and the Impala and the sweet, sweet open road.
Castiel didn’t say thank you. Maybe he remembered when Dean had told him he didn’t need to, or maybe it was just his angelic lack of social skills. He just looked at Dean for a long time, face gentle but giving nothing away. He didn’t put the shirt on, just clasped it to his chest. Dean’s eyes did a brief triangle from his left shoulder, travelling along his collarbone up his neck, pausing at his Adam’s apple, before returning to their previous destination.
Castiel nodded. “Yes. You have the key?” Dean nodded, and walked to him, pressing the key into Cas’ upturned palm. “The radio plays whatever your idea of divinity is,” Cas added as an afterthought. Dean blinked. He supposed he had nobody but himself to blame for the odd choice. He’d wanted to wait to show Cas this song until he knew Cas was on better terms with being an angel and general references to God than he had been when he’d first come to the bunker.
As Cas crawls on top of him, pins him down wordlessly and kisses every one of his battle scars, he knows that's exactly what it is. So he lets the tension out of his body, lets himself melt into Cas' touches. Cas seems to feel the change, and looks up with a tender grin that's so out of place it seems fitting. Dean lets Cas flip him over on his front, and can't help but rock into the sheets. Cas' hands are so strong, so sure, that it seems all right to let go.
But now that he'd collapsed by Cas' bed, into a hideous pink velvet armchair, no doubt dragged from a garage sale, it hit him. He wasn't more than an arm's length away, mechanically watching Cas' pulse, and Cas looked closer than ever, so vulnerable; it would be the easiest thing in the world to reach out and touch him. But Dean didn't, and the inches between had never felt further.
He drove down the deserted road and was just turning left, towards the bunker and away from the lights of the nearby town, when Sam said, “Hey, uh, could you drop me off at the bar?”
He didn't even freeze when I unbuttoned the top button of his shirt with steady, slow fingers. He let his head hang back, exposing his neck to me. I kissed every inch of him. His nails dug into my back, and he ground against me when I had stripped him down to his black boxers. I smiled at the wave of pleasure that coursed through me - yes, such simple, beautiful pleasure. I saw from the expression in his eyes that he was giving into it. Ignoring his ideas of being broken, because if I was, surely we both were. Letting go.
I was never really into the Beatles that much, they sometimes seemed a little... watered down, in comparison to the rock I normally like, but this song is quickly becoming one of my obsessions!
“Tell me what you want,” Cas said in a low voice, bracing himself up on his arms so he was under where Dean knelt, his head coming up to Dean’s chin.
“Well, my eyesight is perfect,” Cas bragged matter-of-factly. “I can see every color and much farther away than a normal human. Sometimes I get distracted by details. Taste and smell are…” he waved a hand from side to side. “My hearing extends into the realm of prayers and human faith and yearnings, so I’d say that’s fairly good.”
Dean prays less frequently now. The tone of the messages becomes less tortured, and all pleas to return drop. If something really funny has happened, Dean drops him a line. And sometimes at the end of the day, Dean just says, ‘Thanks, man. Thank you for everything.’
“I suppose so,” Cas said, evidently not picking up on Dean’s rattled mood. “But conventional dating seems exceedingly strange.”
Cas nodded once, a smile threatening to break loose. "I will throw myself in front of every bullet meant for you I can and I will not apologize. And I will always do my best to come back to you. But, I have a chair now. I think that means I'm here to stay." Dean let out a low laugh. "Come on," Cas said, voice on the verge of breaking from emotion, "Come on," he said, pulling Dean to his feet for a long kiss, lips and bodies pressed together until the inches between had vanished.
The brothers fished for a few more hours, until it grew dark. They decimated the two six-packs Dean had picked up and occasionally spoke. “So, you spent a week getting fucked rotten,” Dean remarked casually.
I would just like to say that I read How A Righteous Man Raises A Rose after writing the chapter with the rose garden, and I officially apologize to anyone that I traumatized by making accidental references. Also, it's an amazing fic (I cried. A lot), and if you haven't already read it, you should. In case you need more tears. Here, have some fluff.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut when he felt one of Cas’ hands come away from his waist to stroke the side of his face. He couldn’t take it. After the hard thrusts and loud moans, that tenderness was too much to bear. He orgasmed inside Cas, bliss spreading across his being like a wildfire, every thrust marked with profanity and beauty falling out of his lips together.
Cas finished the song, his darkly deep voice twisting on the final note. He stared at Dean for a moment and then pressed his palm to the ringing guitar strings, silencing them. Sam let out a whistle of appreciation, but all Dean could do was dumbly stare. In that moment, Elvis Presley seemed like he had read into Dean’s soul.
Desolation stole over him, icy and relentless. That wasn’t… it couldn’t… no. He stared up at the window, searching the blue desperately for anything, for any shred of hope hidden in the ribbons of cloud.
Dean went to sink down onto his bed, only to realize he was already sitting down. “Oh. Uh, right. Oh.” They were both silent. “You think you should go somewhere else so I can get laid?” He finally asked.
something, and while it might engage his emotions in a visceral game of tug-of-war, delving deeper into Cas, understanding the mystery wrapped up in a trench coat and angel wings, that was worth it. It was worth crying on a bus while the man behind you made a balloon butterfly. But it wasn’t worth not yanking it out of the guy’s hands and handing it to your boyfriend, because for fuck’s sake, it was Valentine’s Day.
Getting into Cas' angle of things! Soon we'll be onto the nitty gritty of Dean's feelings and them slowly drawing back towards one another again. I'd love to hear from you if you're reading <3
“I’ve come to a realization.” The angel announced. Dean struggled to keep his thoughts straight. The cool evening wind blew his tie astray, and Dean rolled his eyes. Only Cas would wear a tie on a hunt.
When Dean was open and wet and ready, Cas withdrew his fingers and slowly, slowly, slid in. Cas gave a soft sigh of satisfaction as he bottomed out, balls gently slapping Dean’s skin. “You know,” Cas said in a low whisper, planting a kiss between Dean’s shoulderblades. “I love being inside you.” Dean canted his hips back, desperate for Cas to goddamn
Stamped on the wall of the Grand Canyon are two giant wing impressions and a single hand print, off-center between them. Dean’s laugh came out more as a stuttered gasp. “Yeah, that’ll do the trick.” He blinked, and blinked again. “Defacing government property in the name of love? You sure do know how to show a guy a good time,” he snickered into Cas’ neck, shock boiling low in his stomach. Every time Cas revealed his angel powers, another part of his
“Dean.” Cas sighed. “Things are different. We’re stronger now, together.” When Dean didn’t say anything, Cas prompted. “Tell me I’m wrong.”
room, the one they'd discovered back in the beginning, with the hidden butterflies in glass and the pool of sunlight right under the window.
Dean couldn’t believe it. He’s been bruised, bloodied, and broken, and now, as he stared up at the ceiling with a dry mouth, he felt painfully clearly the indignity of his situation.
“Yes. It took a very long time. It was...difficult training. I didn’t want to.” Cas’ voice is uneven, and Dean puts his coffee down and takes Cas’. He puts both of his hands around Cas’.
It was maybe ten o’clock and still light when they leaned against the Impala, the Grateful Dead cassette on repeat just because Cas liked it so much.
As she seeps away in soft curls of black smoke, Cas feels the ache from God’s betrayal and absence subside a little. The new cosmic caretakers will do a good job.
“What you’re doing, y’know, it’s a good thing.” Dean stopped stock still. “Showing him how you live. Survive, I guess.” Sam smiled gently, waiting for Dean to speak. When he didn’t, Sam asked. “He knows this isn’t the only way to be human, right?”
Cas jerks his fingers out of Dean, at which the taller man lets out a whimper. Cas licks up his palm, coating it with spit. Dean's dick twitches as he cranes his neck to watch Cas slick his cock up. Cas' cock is rock hard and weeping precum from the head, which mixes together with his spit to make it glisten. As Cas runs a hand over himself, he closes his eyes and the tap in the bathroom starts running.
“Only because you cheat.” Dean muttered. Cas was still holding his wrist, though the snowball had fallen to the ground.
I didn't want our kisses to stop. They were hot and sweet, interspersed with the rough scratch of stubble against my chin. We kissed for what felt like hours, but it still was not long enough. His hands snaked under my shirt to feel my bare skin, and I was drunk on want. I wasn’t sure for what, but how I felt it. He was the one to break away, tearing his own shirt off and lifting mine over my arms. I was surprised how graceful my surrender to him had made our movements, and I let him push me back against the Impala. I tilted my neck, reveling in the soft kisses he put there and the scrape of his teeth. He bent me backwards until my shoulderblades touched the ice-cold black metal. I circled my arms around his waist and pulled him to me. He rolled his hips against mine, and all thoughts of how beautifully our bodies worked together through surrender and taking froze. Pleasure butterflied through my groin and stomach, and Dean breathed against my ear, "Oh, Cas."
“Well, then you kinda shot yourself in the foot, then, didn’t you?” Dean took a moment to watch Cas as he clumsily flipped the next pancake. He wasn’t sure how to feel about this all being Sam’s idea, or that his ‘horridly romantic’ mixtape was playing right now. Cas had no sense of what was normal or cheesy, which it made it almost too easy to be honest with him. Sam was an entirely different matter. Still, he was glad to have his brother back, and Sam was always wanting Dean to be embarrassingly open about his feelings, so fuck that line of thought. Besides, Sam liked Jethro Tull. Maybe they could actually have breakfast together, like a regular family.
Dean shoved the book across the table at him, taking the opportunity to watch Cas while the angel’s eyes skimmed down the page. “It’s a sharing conscious states spell,” he said slowly. “It looks like the real deal.”
The portal was closed. Amara held her brother's head in her lap. All around her, soot-gray vines and flowers grew apace, and from somewhere below he could hear water flowing. He stopped short. She was making her own garden.
"All right. Let's go." He clicked the play button on the Impala stereo, and they pulled out onto the road to the choppy sounds of warm guitar.
“Come on. Really?” Dean considered his brother for a moment. “So, what, it’s Valentine’s Day and she hasn’t called you and you’re sulking?”
Dean blinked. Deadweight. He’d never thought of it that way. “You… you’re not.” He seemed to have to gulp for air. “You can hunt with me and Sam if you want. Save people. It might not be all big and cosmic, but it’s real. Cas, if leaving will make you happy, then do it.” Cas closed his eyes. “But, I, uh,” Fuck, how did it get to him saying this? “Stay.”
“Yes, I – I’ve counted all the pebbles here,” Cas said lamely, gesturing with his free hand. Dean eyed the vast expanse of pebbles that Cas clearly had not counted. “And I promised Claire I would call.”
Cas took it appreciatively, swallowing a gulp and smacking his lips – a gesture he surely must have learned from Dean. “Mm.”
“...Maybe.” But Dean’s rolling over, and Castiel, shield of God, is turning his nature to more worthy work. He holds Dean around his middle and watches him as he slides into sleep.
About twenty minutes later, Dean knocked on the roof, holding something perfectly behind his back. Cas stepped outside, stretching briefly. Dean tried not to notice how his shirt rode up, allowing for a perfect view of his hip bones. He failed. “What is it, Dean?”
As the sprinkling guitar solo stretched on into what felt like eternity, different expressions ghosted across Cas’ face. His lips twitched into a smile occasionally, and every time his breath caught, Dean had to fight the urge to run his fingers over them, just to see how they felt. Eventually he couldn’t take it anymore, the compunction to touch Cas was too much. He ran his fingers hesitantly through the angel’s hair. Cas moaned softly in his sleep, and Dean froze. Was this wrong? Castiel’s hair was so damn soft. He swallowed, before running a thumb over Cas’ cheek. His lips parted. The guitar solo carried on, almost taunting Dean that it would end sometime, and Cas would wake up. He moved his arm back around Cas’ waist, holding the angel to him, until he could almost feel Cas’ steady heartbeat through their shirts.
Cas nodded, and looked up at the moon. Dean could tell he was thinking way too hard about it. Sighing, Dean resumed with what had now become a devil’s trap. Whatever. He’d given up on the idea of an apple pie life a long time ago. As far as Halloweens went, watching Cas staring up at the sky, moonlight falling across his stupidly pretty features and carving demon bait pumpkins; well, it could be worse.
Dean held onto Cas tightly, every thought and care about being gentle gone with the wind. He stroked Cas’ cock in time with his thrusts, and could tell by the clenching of Cas’ muscles he was nearly gone. Cas was breathing a litany of broken praise and prayers in his ear, but as it broke off into a loud moan, Dean lost it. They came apart together, Dean shooting hot cum into Cas, Cas coming across their stomachs. He cried out, and his world shrank in that moment to Cas. Only Cas. It took quite a while for it to return to normal, and when it did, it seemed somehow different.
“Mm,” Dean thought for a moment. “Both. ‘Like talking to you, Cas.” The words slipped out of his mouth without warning, treacherously sentimental.
When he came to, he was swaying where he knelt on the dirt, looking up at Cas. The glow was fading from the room, and the giant wing shadows which had stretched beyond the walls of the greenhouse were disappearing. The outer signs of Cas’ celestial being were dimming, and Cas was coming back to him. Cas stared back at him, hair completely disheveled, lips parted and eyes returning from shining blue to their normal ocean depths. And it wasn’t surprising to feel that there was a hot, wet spot in his jeans where he’d come in the heat of the moment, nor was it surprising to see that Cas was in a similar predicament. He swallowed, ears still ringing. When it was over, he’d expected to feel like he was hollow, missing the enhancement of his senses and the overwhelming sense of Cas inside him, all around him. Instead, he felt like he was experiencing the aftershocks of an emotional orgasm.
They stood toe to toe, and Cas wrapped one arm around Dean, their hands clasped on the other side. “Listen to me. I’m going to send part of my grace into you. You have to let me in. It won’t be like I’m possessing you, because the majority of my consciousness will still be in this body. Your body and the space between us will be a conduit for our essences.” Dean swallowed, and nodded. He was trembling, but knew it wasn’t from fear. “If it gets too much, if at any point it feels wrong or dangerous, pull back immediately, you understand?” Cas stroked his thumb along Dean’s hand, and Dean briefly wondered why Cas had agreed to do this. It was pretty obvious that he wanted to, but what had made him change his mind? Dean pushed the thought of his mind, and sent a single, silent,
“I needed you to stop being such a dumb, self-sacrificial son-of-a-bitch,” Dean bites out. “I needed you alive, doing stupid crap like repollinating the tundra and raising Lucifer’s kid and being kinder to world than it damn well deserves. I just needed you, I don’t know, around. Fuck, Cas. Is it that hard to grasp?”
They appeared in a pine forest in the middle of nowhere. The Impala, much to Dean’s relief, was standing beside them, faithfully playing the last of the Fleetwood Mac song. Dean looked around, wondering where exactly they are. Something about the place set a prickling sense of familiarity through his bones, and he scans along the horizon, blazing with sunset. All the trees immediately around them looked to have fallen maybe a decade ago, with some new saplings tentatively taking their place. Dean frowned. There was a circle of barren land, topped with fallen trees all around them. That seemed… His eyes fell on a single wooden cross marker, and all the breath left his body.
Dean makes a decision that night, when he’s too shaky to drive home so he has to hand the keys to Sam.
Cas growled and shot at the target. Dean didn’t bother to check where it landed, instead, he occupied himself with licking a finger until it was dripping with spit and then pressing it against Cas’ hole. Cas moaned. Dean didn’t push the finger in, he just rubbed it gently around in a circle, letting the blunt tip of his finger rest on the pucker of flesh. Then he wrapped his lips around the head of Cas’ cock.
“Somewhere in California, I think.” Cas said. “It moves around. It’s an enchanted temple; if you look for it anywhere, you’ll find it.”
“You think of anyone in specific when you were, uh, singing Can’t Help Falling in Love With You?” Sam’s mouth quirked at his ridiculous question. It wasn’t his fault his brother was an ass and he had to do recon on his behalf. They did have a ‘profound bond’.
It’s too much, for a minute, so even though he’s waking up, Dean keeps his eyes closed. He feels the thump of Cas’ heart and the thin sheets around his shoulders. He thinks,
The shit hit the fan three days later. Three days; that must be a record for him for him fucking something good up.
They'd broken out the brandy about half way through decorating. And then the whiskey. And the wine, which for some reason, Sam had stockpiled. It was crappy, cheap wine, but Dean couldn't tell the difference and all Cas could taste was molecules. Basically, if there was alcohol in the bunker, they'd drank most of it. This was largely due to Cas having incredible alcohol tolerance and Dean stubbornly insisting one just had to get drunk on Christmas Eve. They'd decorated the giant tree; after Dean almost fell off a giant ladder trying to get to the top, Cas teleported the pentagram ornament to the top. If he thought it was a waste of his angelic powers, he didn't say so. Dean felt like, in another universe, Cas could get really
He groaned loudly as the first wave of pleasure hit, shooting cum all over his bare chest. Cas watched like a man helpless, and Dean cried out again and again as he milked himself, until his cock was red and sensitive and it was over. He knelt in the dirt, Cas grabbing up the paper to scrawl something frantically, and slowly came to realize he had cum all over himself. Chest, neck, even some on his cheek.
He looked so close like this. Eyes closed, hair rumpled, hands curled around the edge of the blanket and the faint rise and fall of his body under it. Sleep made Cas look more human - more vulnerable - than ever.
Soon after Sam's sacrifice, Dean ran into Lisa Braeden's arms, and all was forgotten. Or so I thought. I often wonder what would have happened if Sam hadn't made him promise to live 'the apple pie life', as they called it. What if I had told him I planned to stay on earth, stay by his side, instead of becoming heaven's new sheriff? Would I have claimed the shotgun seat in the Impala, comforted him through his grief?
This chapter was edited - Dean originally gave Cas a pendant with the symbol for protection on it, but I liked the idea of Cas having a lucky penny (cause it's more human, in a way) better, so I changed it.
“I guess it is.” Dean shifted his weight. He wasn’t sure what had made him pick this song. He just felt it was something Cas needed to hear. “But it’s got something, you know? Something different.”
It was a dark gray morning, as though the sun had chosen not to rise, and rain pounded down outside. It almost drowned out the small, domestic noises Dean had gotten accustomed to early in the day. His own swallowing. Cas breathing. The small crumplings of sheets and the ticking of the clock in the corner. Sam had left more books outside the room, he knew, but Dean felt as though he were holding his breath for something. He ran his thumb along Cas' knuckles, mapping the bony landscape. He thought how, by now, he probably knew the back of Cas' hand better than the angel did himself. The humor of that, he reflected, would be lost on Cas.
"I thought you'd hate me. For telling you we could beat everything, and then... For how you stayed with me when all the other angels left. For not being able to protect you. And then you
"Failed him like every godforsaken thing I care about," He said, tears beginning to stream down his face. "My fault. This," he gestured around, hands making crooked lines through the air, "It's all my fault. I broke it."
Castiel walked the length of the shore, sometimes disappearing behind bends. He’d taken off his trench coat, leaving it folded at Dean’s feet. On any other day, Dean might have felt strange about watching him this intently. But there was something oddly innocent, charmingly human about the way the angel dipped his hand in the water, wind ruffling his hair. Whenever he noticed Dean watching, Cas smiled and Dean waved. Maybe if someone else had been there, he would’ve startled out of the trance, made some comment about what a dork Cas was and drank some more beer. Dean realized with a start that being alone with Cas made him drop his walls. Uncomfortable with the revelation, he took a swig of ice cold beer.
“Dean, why have we never ingested chemical substances to alter our mental state?” Cas asked suddenly.
Dean laughed. “You’re right. It’s utter bullcrap. But I guess it’s just one of those things you tell yourself to keep going.” Dean didn’t know any word other than wistful to describe the look on Cas’ face.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam’s voice drifted to him as he walked closer, the warm water now hugging the insides of his thighs. “How come the film in your camera never runs out? I was sure we would’ve had to get now by more.”
"I know. But I mean something different now. I swear." And I paused. My brain entered a slight drug-fuelled haze, enabling me to hope, just for a split second. "I'm sorry for that night, all those years ago. The one after Detroit. When I... When I said..." He swallowed.
"Dean?" I said his name like it was a magic word that could bring him back to me. (Little did I know I was the one who was lost.)
“Come on, get in the car.” Dean closed the matter and opened the impala door, letting the Bob Seger song which had been confined to the car play through the street.
“Can you really taste alcohol?” Dean asked, personally starting to regret having ordered on of everything for himself. Some of these were pretty vile.
Maybe ordinarily, this place was too clouded with memories for him to enjoy. But now, the memories seemed faded, overpowered by the lustrous colors and the feel of Cas’ hand in his hair, sending sparks through his scalp. It would never be as beautiful as it could have been if he hadn’t seen Cas in abject despair here, if he had only happened upon it, but then again, none of
all of Cas, just what slivers of skin the dim light revealed. And he was already hard in his jeans. Fuck. He opened the duffel bag carefully, too carefully, and starts pulling items out. He could feel Cas’ eyes on his back, but he didn’t stop. Not until he’d pulled his lighter out of his pocket, fumbled, even struck out trying to light it the first time, and then lit the first candle. He heard Cas exhale sharply as the tiny light danced, casting shadows all across the walls. Dean smiled. Romance – that stuff was hard, though he tried. But romantic sex? That, he could do.
More people than he’d expected get in contact with him. He answers the emails dutifully, asking questions to help them understand themselves, proscribing care where it was lacking, offering what comfort and wisdom he can.
Cas had his eyes closed, brow bunched up in concentration. Dean drained the rest of his beer and wished he’d brought another.
Dean was ruined: Cas' words had planted something that bloomed painfully when he smiled. For the first time, he didn't see his scars as a tally of battles fought, but for the times he’d healed. But Cas was gone.
“I think I like Plan Fuck the Consequences,” Dean murmured, and he reached for Cas’ other hand with his free one.
With the realization, another recollection floated back to him. It was fuzzy and whiskey-tinged around the edges, from last night. “
Luckily for me, he was experienced in such things. “Get out of the car,” he said softly. He opened his door and stepped out. I followed his example, leaning on the hood of the Impala.
Cas stared at where their knees brushed. “They made me relive every death I had ever caused. It took a long time.”
to hurt me, he couldn't. A man who had spent his whole life training to maim and kill. He could have trapped me, killed me, rejected me. He had tried to hide himself by shoving me on the wooden floor and leaving trails of blood across my skin. He couldn't. He couldn't hurt me, not like that. That was the one piece of faith I carried with me while I went on my way to crack open Purgatory.
“Praying?” Dean’s mind had gone blank, and it was noticing stupid little things, like the way the moonlight fell on Cas’ neck.
Jack doesn’t slit his throat, but puts a hand to Dean’s forehead, and he feels all the angelic energy drain upwards out of his core into the hollow his jaw. Jack draws his hand back: it’s on Dean now. Cas is watching him like he’s the dawn of the first day in Eden, eyes darting to the soot wing silhouettes that burned a line across the bunker’s bookshelves.
“We made it,” Cas says. He gazes around the living room and knows he sees both a battleground and the birth of a miracle. A battleground for fighting the demons of their past and domestic battles and the waging the struggle to love and be loved and be whole and not break. The birth of a miracle, because he knows it’s a battle they’re going to win.
He frowned, noticing there was always a cassette in there. It was his mixtape, he noticed when he pulled it out. Wound all the way to the end. Which meant Cas had listened to the whole thing before he left. Dean mentally went through the songs they hadn’t listened to together – Feels Like Love, Survivor (cheesy, but come on!), Carry On My Wayward Son, Kansas (there was something epic there, something he thought Cas might relate to), and finally, Learning to Fly, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Cas knew what he was talking about now, that day in the woods.
“It’s fucking snowing, angel.” Stupid nickname. He thought he caught a small smile flicker across Cas’ face before he pressed his nose up to the glass like a little kid. “Come on, we’re going out.”
“Is this customary?” Cas asked, cradling the pumpkin like a baby, staring into the hole they’d made.
Dean groaned in response, and Cas started to fuck into Dean’s throat. He was brutal, chasing his orgasm in the wet heat of Dean’s throat. A few of his thrusts made Dean gag as Cas shoved Dean’s head down onto his cock.
Cas’ eyes opened wide in surprise. “Dean,” he said, voice muffled with chocolate. Dean waited for a few moments while Cas stared at their hands with a small, confused smile. “I can taste it.”
"Yes," Cas says, and it's softer, like he's made his mind up about something. Dean watches, swallowing, scarcely daring to believe it, as Cas' hand lifts up towards his face. Two fingers trace along the side of his cheek, along the bone, and back around until Cas' hand is cupping his face. Dean can't breathe. Cas is watching him, and everything seems to slow down.
"I'll make you a deal," Dean offered with a lopsided attempt at a smile. He knelt at the foot of Cas' bed, watching for any sign of movement or consciousness. "You know that I lied. And I know that you know. So, if you'll just wake up, I'll tell you the truth. No workarounds. No snide jokes. I promise. Just..." he reached out, hands clenching in the bottom of the blanket. "Just..." Fingers twisting in the cotton, he sniffed. Looked up at where the light fell on the ceiling. Bars from the window streaming onto white. He thought briefly how Cas was meant to be a creature of light, with wings and grace. He said, "OK. OK.
His green eyes flashed with shock as he turned to me. It was the first time he had properly let himself look at me since I showed up. He seemed almost to be looking for changes, since he had last seen me unclothed. He swallowed again, and I drank the sight in. His gaze on me felt heavy, the uncertainty crackling in the air.
“Yeah. I ran it the other day.” Sam said, and slammed the door with a final chorus of, “You, uh, you have a good night.”
Cas nodded, and they worked their way into the back seat, until Cas was all the way pressed up against the window and Dean was on top of him, their legs tangled together. Dean slammed the door. The music was loud in here, and Dean closed his eyes for a moment, letting himself take it in. Cas’ rough stubble against his skin, Paul Rogers’ sex incarnate voice washing over him. Cas was having none of that, though, and Dean gasped as he felt the angel’s lips, warm and wet and sucking a damn
“You’re telling me that today you risked your life, signed up to be a hunter for the rest of your life, and died thousands of time, all because of-”
Because I'm too nice to let you wait in suspense and also because I wanna know what you guys thinks of this: the next chapter! You shouldn't need too many tissues.
Dean buried his head against Cas' chest where he plunged a dagger all those years ago and sobbed silently. "You sacrificed yourself for me. And you shouldn't have." Sensing Cas was about to speak from the rise of his chest, Dean thumped his shoulder. "Not because I don't deserve it. You...you showed me I do. An angel of the lord, in love with me, who’da thunk it."
Of course, he remembers what it was like to be really, truly happy. Telling Dean those words, perfectly made to strike at the core of his self-doubt. Seeing some fragment of Dean start to believe it. Finally speaking his truth.
Dean rubbed self-consciously at the hickey on his throat. He could never quite bear to tell Cas not to leave marks. The air was cool on the back of his neck, and thick with the smell of summer. “So, things with Eileen are good, then?”
Cas kisses him. The angel is practically vibrating with electricity and barely restrained power, and he threads a hand through Dean’s hair and pulls him exactly where it seems like Dean was always meant to be. Dean closes his eyes. Opens his lips for some blessing like water in a desert. Cas’ lips are chapped, but his tongue is hot and slick and Dean draws it into his mouth sweetly and makes it a home there. Something burns at the hem of Dean’s shirt and his eyelashes flutter darker and it’s much, much later when he realizes he’d felt a spark from the lightbulbs blowing out.
Cas opened it, and a small smile fell across his face. It was a smile of understanding just out of grasp.
“I think you should drive faster,” Cas suggested. “I’d like to explore the possibility for pleasure at home.” Dean swallowed, trying to ignore the twinge the words sent through his cock, and pushed his foot down on the gas.
Cas raised a single eyebrow, and it was an unbearable eternity until he spoke. “The bullet didn’t hit you. Did you notice that?”
“Of course.” Dean could have cried out with the sense of loss when Cas sat up and disentangled himself from Dean. The curve of his waist, where Cas’ arm had draped, felt raw and exposed.
“Show me your wings.” The softly spoken words tumbled between them, sealed with a kiss. Cas stared at Dean for a moment. Dean continued his earlier teasing, sometimes just running a finger up the length of Cas’ dick. He knew the angel must be making a decision. He didn’t even know if what he’d asked was possible, but he thought it had to be. Cas could see his soul, and he wanted to see Cas’ wings. He was dying to sink down on his lover’s penis, to show Cas the same bliss Cas had given him before. But he wouldn’t, not yet.
"Dean," I whispered, as my muscles contracted and bliss shot through me. He bit off a cry of his own and our cum mixed together as we shook in ecstasy.
“Dean,” Cas answered. No matter what filthy things they did, Cas said his name like it was something holy. Dean moaned loudly at the fourth finger. He wanted Cas. Needed him so damn bad.
“Harder,” Cas growled, and Dean started to snap his hips into the angel, fucking him until he found his prostate, until Cas was babbling and groaning. “Dean, yes, Dean. You feel so good. Inside me. You’re all… oh… yes, fuck.” He wrapped his legs around Dean, letting Dean pound into him.
I was alone in my vessel for the first time. Jimmy had died when the archangel blew me to pieces in Chuck’s living room. It was odd, to be alone in this body which was now technically mine. I began to realize that certain thoughts, certain hungers, which before I had taken for granted as background hum from Jimmy’s thoughts, were my own. It was startling, to say the least.
It seemed everything Cas had said was true. That was why it was so hard to argue against the note. The monsters
God, I felt high. I pushed him back onto the ground, ignoring the surprise in his expression. He hissed in slight pain at the rough rocks beneath us, but let me strip him of his jeans and underwear. He was gorgeous. Of course, I had knitted his body back together and remade him. I already knew every detail of his body, but touching it this way; this was something different. I draped myself around him, and took his penis in my hand. He groaned at every touch of our skin, every mark I sucked into his flesh. I thought absentmindedly as I stroked him - hard and fast, just like he begged me too - that I liked these red marks. 'Hickeys', he'd later tell me. I liked marking his body as mine, for as we were then, how could he have been anything else?
“Yes.” Cas answered in his gravelly voice. “We were talking, and he said we ought to sort some of the old archives out.” He waved a book, which let off a cloud of dust. “But he said I ought to listen to Mr. Presley.” Mr. Presley, my ass, Dean thought. “I’m afraid I don’t understand a great deal of it. But I like it.”
to repeat. And something inside of Dean ached, because he didn’t even remember it. Jesus. He blurted out, “We could do it again.”
Cas didn’t say anything for a while, just looked the tree up and down, from the thick, burly roots to the canopy that threw dappled light on their faces. “I want to reclaim it,” he said.
Cas blinked and obliged, folding his jacket and shirt in a pile. Dean let his gaze roam across the angel’s leanly muscled chest, the fading marks Dean had sucked into his neck, the soft curls of hair peeking up from below his jeans. Dean smirked when he saw how hard the angel was, bulging in his jeans. Slowly, he reached a hand around his penis and began to stroke himself. Cas licked his lips, and Dean restrained himself from moaning.
He came hard, holding onto Cas like there was nothing else in the world. He lost track of time, until Cas pulled off of his now soft cock, swallowing curiously. Dean dropped to his knees almost immediately, and took the angel’s face in both hands, kissing him. He could taste himself on Cas’ swollen lips. He didn’t think anything had ever felt so good. Dean was so caught up in their gentle kisses he only just remembered about his earlier curiosity. He pulled away, and stood on shaking legs, pulling Cas up with him. He led Cas to the bed, and pulled away the boxers Cas still wore. Cas lay before him, panting and looking up at him, dick rock hard and begging for Dean’s attention. Dean crawled on top of him and started stroking too gently, teasing. Cas didn’t beg. He took whatever Dean gave him.
If there’s one thing Castiel needs, it’s something to do with the burning love still inside him. He reads every book he can on psychotherapy and creates a profile online. He wants to help people on the fringes of the paranormal world. They won’t have much scope to come into an office, or much trust for anyone accredited, whether they’re a vampire who would burst into flames in the sun or a hunter with trust issues.
“They changed the color of my wings to… mark me. As different.” Dean swallowed, another swell of anger at the heavenly dickbags with wings washing over him. Dean ran his fingers over the shining, ebony feathers instead. Cas didn’t need an outburst of anger.
"But somehow it always made me feel better. Just knowing that hell yeah, it's bad out there. But we'd made it and even it meant dying a few times, we'd make it again."
Cas had no such qualms and when Dean caught up with him, he was standing waist-deep in the calm waters, still fully clothed.
They lay like that together, ignoring the hot, sticky liquid between them, Cas’ wings wrapped firmly around Dean.
Cas slammed the door after him, smirking a little. Dean thought he was inwardly pleased to finally ride shotgun. Dean absent-mindedly hit play on the stereo and pulled out of the garage, leaving the bunker in the dust behind them.
Cas takes him by the shoulders and steers him back to the bed, barely leaving an inch between them as they step carelessly backwards. Dean lets Cas guide him, but lets out a sharp breath when the angel shoves him back on the bed. He falls backwards, cold starched sheets meeting the bare skin of his back. Castiel watches him for a moment, just stands there and watches hungrily as Dean's chest rises and falls. Somewhere in the back of his mind, it registers that the motel curtain is blowing like the window is open, though it's firmly shut. It flies up white and gauzy, fluttering before his eyes.
, Dean thought. Not that the kid was wrong. “See you in about five days,” Sam said, definitely smirking now, grabbed his gun, and slammed the door behind him.
“I want you,” Cas panted, and Dean, thinking it was a pretty decent start, ran his tongue across Cas’ hole again. “I need you.”
“I love it,” Castiel finished, clasping the bleached tan guitar to him. The words sounded foreign in Cas’ mouth, the way they rolled off his tongue. It was all scratched up, but Cas didn’t care. From Dean’s limited knowledge of guitars, it was acoustic, seriously old, maybe three quarter size, but pretty decent.
“I dunno, man.” Staring out over the marbled orange expanse, though, he did know. “I guess I feel strong. Like a rock.” His lips quirked into a half smile. “It’s not a bad feeling.” He muttered.
“You just need practice,” Dean insisted, remembering that one time Cas had popped up in his fishing dream. Thank God it had only been a fishing dream. When Cas was silent, lips showing only a slight pout, Dean gave in. “Fine, fine. I’ll fish. You go.” Cas smiled and relegated the bemoaned fishing rod to his chair and taking off his shoes.
His dick oozed precum above where I was working, and in a sudden flash of inspiration, I gathered it on a finger before thrusting that finger inside him, too. "Shit, Cas," he said in a broken voice, staring down at where I was scissoring two fingers inside of him.
“I know,” Dean said, handing two of the giant popcorn containers to Cas. His arms were full of candy and booze. God, the bitch face Sam would be giving him right now. “Just trust me on this, OK?”
Dean wouldn't understand this, but of everything that happened that night, those tiny circles his fingers traced were perhaps the thing I like to look back on the most. The language Dean’s hands spoke on my skin was my favorite to unravel.
Dean watched him laugh with that sort of steady adoration that people who have fallen in love only begin to show after they realize how deeply they’ve fallen. It said,
Cas smiled a little at that. “I must confess that I did. Dean, you taught me that life is a series of ups and downs, but that we will – and deserve to – come out on the other side. Perhaps not unscathed or unchanged, but together.” Dean grit his teeth at the sheer sentimentality, the big words and the weighty  statements of it all – but inside, it warmed him, too. This was Cas talking from the depths of his heart, and he loved Cas, and though his monologues were hella long sometimes, he’d always listen. Cas looked up into his eyes, and hesitated before saying, “I am aware that this endeavor may have unforseen consequences and trials.” Dean opened his mouth to say something to break the seriousness of it all, anything, but Cas cut him off. “This is just another way we will have to learn to fly.”
“You know he’s been practicing that song all this time,” Sam said, gazing proudly at the space where Cas had vanished.
“After I rescued you, your soul, it was – well. Tormented. Taken to the edge of shattering. Partially dissolving into black smoke. I reconstructed you. I couldn’t take away the memories, or the pain, but I took away what it did to you. Some of it, anyway. I never really thought there was a chance you remembered, but I always wondered.” Cas said, his voice softer now.
“Oh, Cas.” Will we ever get fixed? Will we ever fucking fix each other? Or will we just stay here, punishing ourselves for the past? Fuck it. “Take a drive with me tomorrow.” The words seemed so mundane, inadequate. Dean covered Cas’ hand with his, circling a thumb over the back of Cas’ hand. These touched were what they were allowed now, what was all right.
Dean smiled against his skin, and rather ungracefully took off Cas’ jeans. Cas was putty in his hands, obedient to Dean’s every whim. Dean let out a short noise of pleasure when he saw just how rock hard Cas was, eight inches of him throbbing with precum running down his length.
Cas walks away and he doesn’t know where to go. He can feel Dean’s longing cutting into him like a knife. But he can’t for heaven or hell work out what it’s
“That’s the one,” Dean said. He noticed the glances the guy was giving him and Cas, and he glared. “Also, one of everything.” He gestured at the popcorn vender and the scrawny display of candy bags hanging behind the counter. “And whatever alcohol you’ve got secreted away in the back.” He smirked.
Dean laughed. “No. That’s not what I meant.” He circled his arms around Cas’ waist, and drew him close. “I care about you. I need you. You know that.” Those choked out, hoarse words were as close to an
My heart was heavy, but even then, I didn't want to leave him. When he was asleep, I couldn't see the guilt soaking his red eyes, so I took this opportunity to watch him. My stomach turned when I thought of what he said. He regretted me, he regretted everything. I clung to him tighter. I stayed because we needed each other, no matter how much we hurt ourselves in the process.
And maybe if he’d been something beyond human, if he’d had Sam’s shrink-like ability of gauging emotions, he might have stayed awake a little longer. But he was only human, and drunk, and everything was good, and he was in love, and he drifted off peacefully. He woke up alone.
“Yeah?” For some reason he couldn’t bear to speak in more than a whisper, like he didn’t want to disturb the air, as it had settled so peacefully around them. Damnit. Cas’ cheeks were flushed, hair windblown. He was wearing that painfully serious look that Dean just wanted to wipe off his face by grabbing his collar and pulling him close and –
Sam rolled his eyes. “Also I’m the one who told him you were head over heels for him, so you can stop pretending like I don’t know.”
“Oh, no. Is there more?? What was gonna happen if I had them fix it?” She asked hysterically, heading towards the door, “Gabriel?!?” she half-questioned, half-threatened as she went back to her own classroom.
“No, I’m here…I was just-” Dean cut himself off with a yawn. “Sleeping,” he finished sheepishly. Cas smiled and kissed him briefly.
Castiel just laughed. “Only slightly. Thank god it’s Friday,” he replied, getting up and walking towards his backpack. He picked it up and slung it over his shoulder. Debating whether he should, then ultimately deciding he
“Dean,” Mary coaxed, “Dean, I know this is scary, but Castiel could be in serious trouble. He needs a head CT, and unfortunately, we do not have that equipment here.”
“Well that’s funny, because Michael just went for a jog around the neighborhood,” she said, “he didn’t mention seeing you,” Castiel froze. He had not accounted for that.
“Uh, he left last night...well early this morning really. Something about his step-mom being upset with him staying out,” Dean explained.
“I’m sure at least Charlie thought it might’ve been me,” he said, hoping to raise Castiel’s spirits. The older man let out a short burst of air through his nose.
“Um...it’s my mom,” she revealed. At that, Charlie ceased typing and shot her eyes up to lock on Jo’s.
"You did something WORSE than accuse him of cheating? Do you realize how gone you guys are on each other? What the hell were you thinking, Dean Winchester!?" Charlie was pacing now, taking turns at glaring at Dean and the ground, trying to figure out how stupid her friend was.
“That's good news. Did you meet anyone else?” His friend asked innocently. Castiel couldn't help that his mind went straight to Dean. He also couldn't help that Balthazar knew him so well.
said you liked it when I surprised you!” Dean defended, thoroughly enjoying his fiancé’s glare. “Not for nothing Cas, but the last time you looked at me like that...I got laid.”
“Then, we get back to school after summer break, and like after a month, she starts talking to me again. She tells me that she and her boyfriend broke up and she wants ‘a friend’,” Dean continues, using air quotes on the last words. “So I’m like, yeah sure, and we catch up and start talking and hanging out and everything, and one night she was at my house and uhh...well we ended up making out. I sorta thought it was going to be a one-time thing...but it wasn’t. So I eventually asked her out officially, and she agreed.”
After Castiel had been fed, he, Dean, and Mary retired to the living room. There, he relayed his story. The Winchesters were patient with him. They didn’t press for more details; they just sat with him and listened. Castiel had almost forgotten what that was like. Part of him thought this family was a figment of his imagination, that he had dreamt them up as some sort of...coping mechanism. But, as Dean squeezed his hand, he was reminded that they were here for him, in more ways than one.
The five of them kept busy waiting for Dean by writing phrases down on scraps of paper that they would use for this pictionary game. Everyone was wary of allowing Gabriel to come up with some of the prompts, but when they tried to suggest he sit this out, he got pretty riled up (
“Thank you for your concern...but I’m sure my situation isn’t that bad. I don’t need to be emancipated,” Cas said with a chuckle. Sam smiled and looked down.
my first boyfriend,” Castiel said, “you just won’t be my first kiss. Or my first time,” Castiel divulged, eyes flicking down to glance at Dean’s lips. Dean smirked at that last part.
"As much as that would please me, I have other plans for tonight," Cas said, climbing off of Dean and into the closet.
“They’re making out against the shed,” she informed him, gently blowing on her drink to cool it down. “Ugh,” she complained, “if I knew this was how they were going to act, I wouldn’t have accepted the invite.”
Dean grabbed onto his boyfriend’s hips and fucked ruthlessly into him, Castiel letting out a string of moans and encouragements. Dean bit his lip as he went faster, fingers digging deeper into Castiel’s hips as he chased his climax.
The boys looked over to the door to find a shocked Sam staring back at them. After only a moment to register what exactly was going on, Dean leapt off the bed and placed his hand on Sam's shoulder.
“Un petit peu...a little bit. I speak a little bit of french. My mom used to teach me a few phrases when I was growing up. Nothing to write home about,” Castiel explained. He hesitated before adding on, “Balthazar is also fluent. I might’ve picked up a few...phrases from him.” Dean raised an eyebrow, but didn’t press for more.
“When my dad let me go back to watch Balthazar’s graduation ceremony, we went out and after that, I spent the night,” Castiel disclosed. “But he won’t try anything when he knows we’re together. Balthazar knows he and I are just friends with benefits,” Castiel assured Dean.
Dean returned with the damp washcloth and gently ran it between Castiel’s cheeks, the older man sucking in a breath at the sensitivity. Dean kissed him soundly before he cleaned up the wall.
“Why would that scare him off? Also, my acting was superb, I bet he didn’t even notice that my ears aren’t pierced,” she added smugly.
“You’ve gotta up your flirting with Cassie,” Gabriel told him, “you barely did that at all last game night! What happened? I thought we were a team!”
“Mmm, why are you still wearing clothes, darling?” Castiel asked as he pulled at Dean’s shirt. Dean wiggled out of his overshirt and helped Cas take off the t-shirt underneath.
fall asleep on me,” Dean admitted nonchalantly. Charlie almost spit out her breakfast at those words.
Soon, they were pulling at each other's clothes as they made their way clumsily to the bedroom. They made love with fierce passion until neither of them could stay awake any longer.
He made sure his hair wasn’t in too much of a disarray. He ran his fingers through it and let his anxieties drop. Dean was here to hang out and have fun, it wasn’t such a big deal. Another knock made him realize he was just staring at himself in the mirror.
“Oh, honey. Nobody is going to lay a finger on Alfie. He came out a long time ago and his parents love him just as much as they always had. He doesn’t have to worry about Michael coming for him,” she soothed. When Castiel still wouldn’t meet her eye, she put two and two together.
He cursed under his breath when he saw how busy it was. He had to park what felt like miles away from the entrance; the biting cold worsening his mood. He would’ve gone earlier in the week, but he hadn’t realized they were so close to being out of almost everything.
“I’m sorry! I couldn’t find my good pair of jeans,” Jo explained, “but...we’re still waiting on two certain people...which means they will be on the same team tonight.”
“Oh, yes! Because Michael’s your favorite and I pale in comparison to everything he's done! I'm not allowed to make a few mistakes because you swooped in
He slicked his fingers up and thrust his index into Castiel’s waiting hole. Cas groaned, biting his own lip. This was harsher than Dean usually was, but fuck if it wasn’t turning him on. Cas pushed back onto Dean’s finger, opening himself up. Dean leaned forward and smothered Cas’ shoulders in open-mouthed kisses.
Dean grabbed the back of his neck nervously before replying, “I don’t know. I don’t really celebrate it.”
"Dean, wake up! We got a call!" Benny slapped Dean's feet off of the coffee table. Dean blinked twice and he was on his feet, following Benny to the lockers to suit up before heading out. Engine 17 was barreling down the street in a breakneck four minutes.
“Fuck, Dean, just like that,” Castiel moaned, lost in sensation. He reached down to stroke his own dick, but Dean batted his hand away, instead grabbing hold himself. He stroked up and down in time with his thrusts.
Luckily, Naomi was out of town until tomorrow, so Cas was able to join them for the entire marathon.
They stood there, pressed close together as they traded hungry kisses. Castiel was getting feisty, biting at Dean’s bottom lip. The older boy smiled as he grinded against Cas, feeling just how excited his boyfriend was through his dress slacks. Dean kissed along Cas’ jaw and down to his neck, trying to start a hickey, but moving on when Castiel pushed him lower.
Before it became uncomfortable, Castiel slipped out of Dean and discarded the condom. He untied Dean and kissed him hard, Dean’s hands finally able to touch his boyfriend. One hand snaked its way into Castiel’s hair and he pulled slightly, smiling at the reaction it got out of Cas.
“No, it's fine. I'd feel weird if I just left it. Naomi makes me do the dishes after dinner all the time,” Castiel said, following Mary into the kitchen. They put the dishes into the sud-filled sink. Mary took to washing and Castiel found a cloth and started drying.
The crazy thing was; Cas loved Dean too. For his entire twenty three years, Castiel had never had time to be in love. Right now, though, something inside him felt free, something about Dean just felt…right.
Much to his chagrin, Dean’s performance in this game was on par with Gabriel’s; Charlie won easily, advancing her into the semi-finals.
“You like that?” Dean asked, pulling once again and biting his lip at the pleasure of Cas' mouth around him. Cas rutted into the mattress as Dean guided him along by the hair.
Charlie glared at him. “Get out of my classroom,” she ordered, only half joking. Gabriel laughed and headed to the door that connected their labs.
About 15 minutes later, Mary came down to check on the boys and noticed they were asleep. She was proud of Dean for keeping his door open. She knew he hated the rule, but it was what she grew up with, and it’s what her boys were going to grow up with. She hoped it deterred them from getting...
Cas huffed in annoyance and folded his arms across his chest. He tapped his bare foot impatiently. "If you're not going to say anything, I suggest you take a pillow and go downstairs because I don't want to be kept awake just to watch you stare at the ground."
“Hold still,” Dean instructed, snapping a photo of his boyfriend. It was perfect. The sun was setting in the window behind them, making Castiel’s body more of a silhouette.
They dried off and Cas led Dean back to bed, where they made out until they were both too tired to do anything but sleep.
“Money is no object. We haven’t really discussed my job have we?” Cas thought about it. They hadn’t.
"As you wish." Dean said simply before straightening his back and grabbed Cas's hips once again. He started with a few slow thrusts, but quickly picked up the pace, snapping in and out of Cas with vigor. He reached around and jacked Cas in time with his thrusts. Soon, all Cas could see was white as he came hard on the sheets, crying out Dean's name.
“Uh, I wanted to talk about the next game night,” she said. Charlie scrunched her eyebrows and looked up.
“Or I’ll have to do this,” in one fell swoop, Balthazar wrapped an arm around Castiel’s back and kissed him hard. Castiel closed his eyes and relished this moment. He knew that he might never get a moment like this with Balthazar again. They jumped apart when they heard footsteps climbing up the stairs.
Castiel was just tired of Naomi. He was tired of the way she always had to be on top; he was tired of how everything in her precious house had to be spotless. Was she aware that Castiel had his own life? He wasn’t just there to do everything she wanted him to do. She didn’t control him...as much as she’d like to.
“A pleasant conversation, but it looks like I’m not getting that,” she remarked sassily. “I had a feeling you’d spend today moping about Mr. M.I.A., so I’m calling as more of a courtesy before I come pick you up. We’re going to go to Ash’s party tonight. I know you don’t like drinking, but I don’t wanna hear anything about you not wanting to go out because-”
“So, ok, wait…” Charlie interrupted, trying to put her thoughts into an actual sentence, “if you two have been together the whole time...what about the little fights?”
“Woah there, boys. What’s the fuss?” Castiel broke eye contact with his fake-enemy and looked towards Gabriel.
“Thanks,” Cas said, placing it on the kitchen counter. Dean looked up from his task of pouring candy into a decorative bowl.
“Castiel,” Naomi called out after she realized he wasn't going to respond to anything less than actual words. He took a deep breath and turned to face her.
“Do you, uh,” Dean cleared his throat, “need more water?” he took the cup and went out into the hallway before Cas could reply. He just couldn’t look at his boyfriend any longer. Not without breaking down himself. And he needed to be strong; Cas was the one that needed the support, not Dean.
