The camera pans around behind Dean to showcase the town center of Lawrence, Kansas as Dean’s voice narrates the scenes. It’s a small, charming little city, and the fondness Dean holds for it is easy to see as he begins his micro tour.
Cas continues to stare at him for a few seconds, mouth agape, before he shakes his head quickly and gives Dean a bewildered little smile that makes Dean’s heart beat just that much faster. “You won,” he says.
Cas squints to read one more sign in particular, this one scrawled out in bright red marker. Once he’s read it, his cheeks get even more flushed than they already are. “Oh.”
The man narrows his eyes, unimpressed. “Dinner without a show? Now that’s no fun,” he says with a pout, stamping his foot like a child. He huffs and makes like he’s about to turn around and leave, but instead his hand darts down and he grabs Gabe’s cell phone up off the table. “Want to see me figure out your lock code?”
Cas nods, taking a sip of his beer, and Dean absolutely doesn’t watch the way his lips wrap around the bottle, wet and dark and glistening in the firelight. “Chains will do that, won’t they?”
Dean’s sorry to see it end too, but he nods, pulling his legs up and arranging them so that he’s sitting cross-legged on the table. “Come back whenever, y’know.” He curls his middle, pointer, and ring fingers down toward his palm and twists his wrist back and forth between himself and the wall. “We’re not goin’ anywhere.”
She beams at him, and they turn to watch Dean and Sam embracing a few feet away. They pull back and Sam claps a hand on Dean’s shoulder before saying something else, and Dean grins. Sam notices them, then, and hooks his arm for Dean to grasp before they head over.
Cas wants to have a carefree night with his teammates, but carefree isn’t really in his vocabulary in the first place, and he still can’t get his mind off Dean’s sketch.
“Blind runner coming through! To your left! To your left!” A particularly bony runner narrowly avoids smacking Dean in the face with her elbow, and Dean plows forward with Cas right next to him. When he’s sure that they have a clear path, Cas keeps his eyes trained on the ground, and he starts to count out the steps they have left.
The card’s starting to pull away from the page, so Dean digs through his desk drawer for a glue stick and gently lifts up the loose end of the card, reapplies some glue, and presses his palm over the entire card to set it.
“How’d you know?” Dean finally asks through gritted teeth, watching as Crowley digs into the bag and starts counting their money.
vision back. I started running into shit--blind spots--and I was still having issues seeing at night on top of all this, and it got to the point where Sam was freaked out enough to bring me to the optometrist. He ran a few tests, told us about RP, and it was just a waiting game after that.” He shrugs again. “Things got worse and worse, then I finally woke up one morning--” he snaps his fingers “--with nothing. Just some shadows.”
Cas nods. “I think it would make him sad, to come back and know that he can’t read anymore. He was just telling me the other day how upset he is that he won’t know how that
“Hey!” Charlie says a moment later, rolling backwards on her chair into Cas’ cubicle. “Great job on the article, it’s getting a
Charlie chuckles humorlessly. “Yeah, okay, very funny. Real name, please. I’ve got internet creeping to do, make sure he’s good enough for you.”
A quick peek through the chainlink fence tells him that the other catcher, a gangly-looking kid with big ears, is half-dressed in his gear, and Cas sighs. He’d been hoping to make a good first impression without his bulky catcher’s gear, but the last thing he wants is to be unprepared, so he digs through his dusty, cluttered bag before pulling out his shin guards and mitt and taking a few steps backward toward the bench. His cleats clack on the cement as he does so; he’s always liked that noise.
would be coming back, well, Cas had been quick to embrace it as the gift it so clearly was. After seeing the text Charlie had sent their group chat, Cas had tossed his phone to the side, grabbed Dean’s face, and kissed him so hard without warning that his boyfriend almost fell off the couch in surprise.
He rides that high the last few miles to Lawrence, which is just as Dean remembers it: a bustling city packed to the gills with folks who didn’t spare him or Sam a second glance a year ago, and show no signs of doing so now.
There’s also the way his lips scrunch up into this pouting little smirk, and how Castiel has already thought--on multiple occasions--what they’d feel like pressed up against his own.
Dean pauses and looks up at the water-damaged ceiling tiles as he locks his door. “Eh, half hour ago.”
Cas opens his mouth to explain, but then realizes that he’s essentially asking Dean how he walks around while blind. “Uh, nothing.”
“I always seem to catch you at the most inopportune times, don’t I?” he asks. He’s moving carefully, hesitantly, and Dean wonders if he walks that way everywhere he goes, or if Dean’s just special.
Castiel’s stomach drops at that. He tries to hide his anxiety, but he wasn’t prepared to deal with any issues.
“Afternoon,” Sam says with a polite smile and nod, the kissass. Dean’s almost pleased by the fact that she doesn’t respond.
Dean can’t help it; by the end of the song, he’s got a smile a mile wide as Sam and Cas finish up with,
there, handsome,” a voice behind him says, and Cas stiffens immediately. He doesn’t have to turn around to identify the speaker, but does anyway, and comes face-to-face with Dean Winchester’s immaculate mug.
“We’re passing the CITGO sign,” Cas says, pushing past the cement-like feeling in his legs. They’ve slowed to a bit of a trot now, but Dean has been adamant about not walking anymore until after they’ve crossed the finish line.
They’re only a few minutes into the trick when they’re interrupted by a sharp, “You harassing my customers again, Heyerdahl?”
know.” Gabe smiles widely, flashing his best pleading eyes at Cas, who closes his own and pinches the bridge of his nose.
“You’re okay,” he says again, walking toward the door. He stops when he gets to the doorway and pauses for a few seconds, then sets the ring box down on the polished end table next to it, tapping two fingers on top of it before walking away, bypassing Chuck and making a beeline back out into the snowy night.
“Ladder!” Sam shouts, shoving in front of Dean and Cas and making a beeline for the ladder tucked away in the corner. He swings round it, feet situated on the rungs, and once he’s sure the two of them are following him, starts heading down.
He clicks over to the DELETE ALL button, but instead of hitting enter, he just keeps looking at the screen. The pilot episode is the first one listed, and his mind wanders back to the day the contestants had been announced, to the day that he first set eyes on Dean Winchester and his crooked, shit-eating grin that he never seemed to leave home without.
“Calm down, Al,” Zachariah says, pressing a hand to his friend’s chest. “Take a breath, have a drink. You’ll have your time.”
too bad. All his teeth are still there, no fat lips or makeshift splints for his fingers, and Cas is almost 100% sure that the dark circles under Dean’s eyes are just from exhaustion, not a fist to the face.
Cas narrows his eyes as Dean’s smile widens. His hand is splayed over the entire sheet of paper, and Cas swallows down the little spark of warmth he feels as he nudges Dean’s hand to the side.
Charlie flips him off with both hands, and Cas immediately feels a pit of guilt start to build up low in his gut. They’re good friends, he knows that, but sometimes, sometimes he just needs to be reminded of that fact.
Dean’s mother had been killed in a hit-and-run when he and his brother Sam were young. Cas remembers it being the first real tragedy their small town had ever really been exposed to.  Dean had been able to tell Cas about it without crying, something he’d admitted he’d just recently been able to accomplish, but Cas remembers the way he’d still had to blink away tears.
. It’s something that should be too sweet to be real, but Dean’s always managed to find ways of surprising him.
Dean smiles, but keeps his eyes on his lap for a few more seconds. "Just like your food style," he finally says.
“‘s not your fault,” he says, shifting his weight a little in the driver’s seat. “Fuckin’ sucks, but it’s not your fault.” There’s a short silence, and then Dean continues. “And it's not as bad as it could be. At least I know what shit looks like, you know? I've seen most of the stuff around me before, which is more than I can say for a lot of people I met during O and M."
“It’s Dean Winchester.” Castiel’s heart stutters, he drops his foot immediately, and tries to clear his throat as discreetly as possible.
; by the way he’s managed to keep every damn thing to himself from the moment they’d met; by the way he’s snuck on into Dean’s mind and made himself at home like a little blue-eyed mouse Dean
he didn’t mean to do. He’s got a basic grasp on physics, he knows that if you pull something back, it’ll go back.
Dean stares at him, then drops his head in his hands, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. There’s a faint ring of bruising around Dean’s neck from the mugger’s fingers, and just looking at it makes Cas wince. “You were the dick taking pictures.” It isn’t a question, and Cas feels the corners of his lips quirk up slightly.
Sam hates when Dean talks about it, but Dean reckons their cell mate, Novak, whose first name Dean still hasn’t been able to wheedle out of him, hates it even more. In fact, he probably hates everything about the Winchester brothers, but Dean can’t tell for sure—the man’s never said more’n a few words at a time ever since he got chained up with Sam and Dean. He’d joined their ranks eight months and two days ago, bumping their gang up from two to three.
“Hey! Hey, hey, hey,” Dean says quickly. He scrambles ahead and hops in front of Novak, forcing him to a halt. “You’re not gonna tell us, that’s fine. How ‘bout this, though? How ‘bout a name? A
Cas takes a few steps forward and reaches out to place his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, what’re you--”
“Thank you, Hannah,” he finally says a few moments later, after he’s figured that he’s left Winchester alone long enough.
Bobby waits for the door down the hall to click shut after Cas before leaning forward to envelop both Sam and Dean into one giant hug. It’s rough and warm and smells a bit like whiskey, but it’s the closest to home Dean’s had in years. He takes a few seconds to just breathe it in before wrapping an arm around Bobby and returning the gesture.
The guy pauses, then pulls out his chair and takes a seat at the table. “Funny,” he says, flipping open the tiny menu and glancing at Dean from above it, “she said the same thing about you...”
The next day, Dean’s focused on two things: keeping that dream a goddamn secret, and making sure Cas knows he’s sorry. It’s tough, him admitting he was wrong, but it’s better than the alternative, and that’s what’s keeping him going as they start toward wherever Sam’s got them heading towards next.
For the next few blocks, he’s content with their silence, nothing to hear except the occasional whoosh of a car rushing past or the click-clacking of Dean’s cane against the pavement. He feels at peace with it, something that would have make him incredibly anxious in any other situation, with any other person, would leave him scrambling for some topic of conversation to keep the silence at bay.
mistakes, and your intention is to punish them? For putting a stop to months of robberies while also thwarting an assassination attempt?” She tsks impatiently, like she’s talking to a child on the verge of a tantrum. “Now, that just won’t do.”
Dean shakes his head quickly, pulling himself back into reality. “Yeah,” he says with a wince, “that sucks. ‘S like he ruined it for you.”
Cas doesn’t want this. Or, well, he never thought he’d want this. And he doesn’t know if it’s because of his sweetness or frankness or gorgeous eyes or crooked smile or sharp jawline or a combination of all that and more, but one thing’s for sure:
Dean interrupts him with an awkward clap that Cas assumes is supposed to have landed on his shoulder, but ends up cuffing him in the back of the head instead. “Just take the compliment, dude.”
Once he’s regained his balance, Dean stares, breathing hard. “I’m not a kid,” he says indignantly. “I can take care of myself. I don’t need warnings for sticks or leaves or fuckin’
Cas shakes his head as his cheeks go hot in embarrassment, squeezing his eyes shut as he tries to will himself to stop thinking about Dean’s eyes, Dean’s laugh, Dean’s smile—just,
“But,” Castiel continues, “from what little I know about you, I don’t think you would’ve gone for this if he had asked your permission first, so maybe that really was the best way to go about it.”
Tonight, their dinner is devoted to the beginning of the 2016 season, with the reasoning that all their free time will suddenly be disappearing for the foreseeable future. Cas and Dean had spent the afternoon together, going over signs and practicing a few new pitches before heading back to Dean’s dorm to get changed and meet the rest of the team.
“Drink, drink, drink, drink!” everyone chants. Dean’s knees buckle, throat working overtime as he struggles to down the beer still left in his funnel. Lisa, on the other hand, is having no trouble at all. She holds up her free hand and flicks her wrist casually, taking one more gulp before spitting out the funnel and raising both hands in victory.
Sam groans. “Thanks, babe. Knew I could count on you.” Jess beams proudly and gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
He gives Dean an uncertain smile, and Dean raises his eyebrows, taking the lack of a further response as a sign that the dude’s not interested in continuing their conversation.
Cas takes it, hoping against hope that Dean doesn’t notice the way his hand’s trembling. Dean helps him to his feet, and Cas looks up at him once he’s upright. He hasn’t known Dean long, but it’s still unsettling to see him look anything but happy, or at the very least, amused.
“I take it you like them?” Cas asks, pleased. The sweet and salty taste is still running rampant in his mouth, and Cas helps himself to some more of his and Dean’s handiwork.
Cas drops onto the bed and plays with the bottom of his deep blue tie, watching Gabe continue to preen over himself in the mirror while Balthazar pulls himself together in the bathroom, shrugging into his dark navy suit jacket.
It’s a ballsy move, ballsier than he’d been anticipating, but Cas is showing no signs of calling HR on his ass, so he considers it a win. He looks down at the art supplies in his arms and offers up one last smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
They had decided to take a few days off following the incident after coming home from the Middle East, and today is their first day back to their regular schedule. Cas grins as he turns off the alarm, rolling onto his side and propping himself up on his elbow as he studies his boyfriend’s defensive fuck-off-and-let-me-sleep-in posture.
He wants to text Dean and apologize, explain himself, get to the bottom of whatever the hell just happened, but something stops him. He unlocks his phone and swipes over to his text messages, opening up his thread with Dean. He’s considering typing a novella to him, rife with apologies and “I didn’t know”s, but Gabe interrupts his mental outlining process before he can get too far.
Dean’s brain supplies, and he tries to hide the way his cheeks go pink by shoveling more food into his mouth, praying to whoever’s listening that nobody noticed.
“I don’t have any brothers,” Cas clarifies. “Your question, ‘brothers, huh’ insinuates that I’d know something about how you’re feeling, or you and Sam’s relationship. But I don’t, so I don’t.”
Dean watches her work, fast and efficient and utterly ruthless. He notices Sam tapping his foot anxiously next to him, but the admiration’s clear in his eyes, and Dean smiles down at his hands. Even if, somehow, this doesn’t work, and he’s back at Joliet within a day or two, he decides all this has been more than worth for the sole reason of seeing Sam look like that again. He chances a glance back down at his and Cas’ hands, and squeezes once more.
Castiel didn’t think it was possible, but Anna’s eyes widen even more, and she all but collapses into a chair at the dining room table. “Jesus, Castiel, I thought it went without saying! Y’know,
He seems satisfied and moves his hand to his back pocket. It reappears with what looks like a balled-up napkin, and for a split second, Cas is struck with the fear that he lost a tooth from the hit, as well, and starts frantically running his tongue over his teeth to check for gaps.
And the bundles of cash he’s already got clenched in his fists. He catches Cas’ eyes again and can’t help but grin at the spark of pride there. A quick glance at Sam shows that he’s already followed Cas’ lead.
“Who?” Castiel can’t keep the curiosity out of his voice as he grabs his keys off the kitchen counter and locks the door to his apartment behind him.
“Why don’t you read it?” a slim redhead demands, shifting her glasses up further on her nose before fixing the guy in front of her with a challenging stare. She’s leaning on her elbows on the other side of the counter, so Cas assumes she must be an employee.
Balthazar suddenly smacks his open palm against the tabletop, and Castiel jerks his head up, startled. “Exactly," his friend says. "You're doing something you like to do, so It won't be that bad." It's a stupid solution; Castiel
a spark. And you followed me a few hours later.” He shrugs. “'m a bit of a hopeless romantic sometimes.”
Cas takes a deep breath and forces himself to his feet, bracing himself against the brick wall. He offers Dean the best smile he can, which he’s sure looks forced and like he’s on the verge of tears, or maybe throwing up. “Surprise.”
They crash into each other, the momentum they’d built up throwing them along for a few more feet until they come to a stop in a mess of tangled limbs and chains. Dean’s thrown onto his back, and he turns his head to watch wearily as the train continues on without them.
, mind you—that we could use a little more starpower on. Mayoral race is really heating up. You boys interested in reliving your glory days?”
Dean barely even reacts to Sam’s presence, opting instead for a one-shouldered shrug, and even that’s pushing it. “Long enough.” He feels more than sees Sam sit down next to him. They sit in silence for a few moments until Dean looks over at him. “I left him. I let this happen.”
my family’s place.” Dean glances over his shoulder at her and grins. “Sorry if you were expectin’ the Ritz, but Bobby and Ellen’ll take care of us.”
Castiel’s next running session with Dean arrives faster than he would have liked, and as he and Anna make their way up to the Winchesters’ porch, he starts genuinely expecting Dean to answer the door, realize it’s him, and then slam it in his face.
,” Castiel breathes, stripping off his shirt and holding it far away from him, as if he’s dealing with some kind of toxic waste. He’s about to bring it into his bedroom and drop it into the hamper but thinks better of it; one shirt is bad enough, there’s no way he’s letting that smell get into
When Lisa opens the door, her face brightens immediately at the sight of Dean, and she wastes no time pulling him into a hug punctuated by a long kiss.
Cas keeps his face neutral, but inside, his stomach flips. That couldn’t be—no, there’s no way Dean would be interested in
Dean nods. "I'm reading this book right now—well, it's just a short story, I guess—but it's called 'CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,' and it's so fuckin' cool. It's got ghosts and soldiers and gangs, and it's so weird, but so cool."
“No identity thieves here, sweetheart,” he says, and Cas’ heart, which had just started to resume its normal rhythm, nearly stops. He leans forward between the two front seats and smacks his brother hard on the shoulder.
Cas and his teammates erupt in cheers and yells. Northeastern's players stand awkwardly at their positions, watching dejectedly as Garth and Vic round the bases, Vic pumping his fist over and over.
“Good.” Dean runs his tongue quickly over his teeth in confirmation and holds his hand out toward Cas. “I’m assuming we’re done, right?”
, then looks over at Cas. The guy’s face, normally all hard lines and sharp edges, has gone soft and hopeful, a concerned little furrow between his brows. He takes a hesitant step toward Dean, who takes a step back.
One of Cas’ coping mechanisms for when he’s particularly stressed is reality TV. It started in college, with episodes of
Castiel wrinkles his nose and stops short, causing Dean to stumble a little. “The author?” Castiel asks hesitantly.
“What? I d--” Castiel is leaning over to inspect the sole of Dean’s sneaker when he reminds himself that no, that’s not the reason he’s apologizing. He surveys the sole quickly--can’t be too careful--before turning his attention back to Dean. “No, no, you didn’t.”
Somehow, Dean doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that the best lighting in the entire house is in this goddamn room.
sprang this goddamn thing on me out of nowhere!” Dean snaps, jerking his head up and glaring at his brother. “Don’t you dare, Sam. Don’t you fucking dare.”
Cas locks his phone and tosses it onto the couch cushion next to him before burying his face in his hands. “Fuck,” he breathes. “
He can see everything in those eyes, the vulnerability, the eagerness, the infatuation, and Cas just stares. It’s obvious that Dean knows what he’s doing, but there’s something else there, an odd kind of trust and desire to do good that Cas can’t entirely describe.
“Congrats, Cas!” he says excitedly, embracing Cas as Anna does the same to Dean. “He’s so happy, dude,” he adds softly before breaking the hug.
, Castiel,” she says, “more than any other school you applied to.” She reads the acceptance letter as if it’s the first time she’s seeing the words, even though they’d emailed him a copy a few weeks before the mailed version arrived. “This will be good for you,” she continues, leaning over and wrapping an arm around his shoulders. “A fresh start.”
you do it?” He’s proud of himself; the comment comes out less acidic than he’d intended, but still snarky enough to get his point across, which he’s sure he did—Dean’s looking at him now, eyes narrow.
!” Kevin says, smacking Ash’s hand away as he tries to drunkenly caress his hair. Cas glances over at Dean, who’s grinning around the lip of his beer bottle, taking one long swig before setting it down on the table. He catches Cas looking at him and smirks, flashing him a
"Upstairs with Dean." Sam waves his hand distractedly toward the staircase as he leads Cas into the living room. Cas tilts his head slightly, trying to decide if what he's about to ask could be considered rude or out of line. "Are you…going to tell me what's going on, Sam?"
“We almost back?” Dean asks, and Cas isn’t sure if he’s imagining the pang of disappointment in Dean’s voice, or if he’s just projecting his own emotions onto him.
It’s getting late, the sky going progressively darker as he walks, and Cas does his best to peek over or around his box of work belongings to make sure he stays on the right track. He’s craning his neck around the right side of the box when he feels someone grab him from the left. He stumbles sideways into a narrow alley, and before he can so much as cry out, his box drops to the ground and he’s slammed up against a brick wall, staring down a gun.
“Yeah.” Cas is silent for a few more seconds, staring up at the clouds and feeling suddenly guilty for being able to see them before adding, “I’m sorry, Dean.”
do. Each of us gets a free bottle to pack with our luggage, and I ain’t wasting space, baby bro.” He turns back around and points out the window, pulling his sunglasses down over his eyes before yelling, “All aboard, gentlemen!”
Cas hasn’t moved voluntarily since they arrived; his plan is to just let himself be moved by the masses in the hopes of not getting hurt or potentially trampled to death. There have been a few rocky moments, but Cas is fairly certain that he’ll be able to make it out of this alive--until the lead singer takes a long swig of beer, tilts his head up and spits it back out like a whale shooting water out of its blowhole, and careening into the next song. The crowd goes even crazier than they already were, and Cas suddenly finds himself in the middle of the makings of a mosh pit.
Cas is lying on his side, facing right into the light. He squints a bit, but doesn’t move otherwise. Dean’s frozen in place, only spurred into action when Sam takes the flashlight back and knocks his hand against the keys in Dean’s other hand.
Dean ignores him, hustling up a bit to catch up to Novak and nudge him with his shoulder. “Sam here got caught practicing law without a license.”
“Sam,” he mumbles. When there’s no response, he peeks through his fingers to see his brother still sleeping soundly a few feet away. He’s alone. He’s lost. Unsure of how—or even if—he should proceed. The tightness in his chest is back, and he can’t do this right now. Getting stiffly to his feet, he steps around Sam and heads toward water.
notice a plate sitting on the top of one of the cases. There’s a small placard next to it, and Dean smirks when he reads the words “Today’s special: bee-scotti” with a hastily-drawn bumblebee buzzing around the letters.
“And now I understand why you seemed so disinterested in it,” Cas says gently. “You’re an expert on the topic.”
Cas is expecting “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” but instead, he hears the opening notes of a song his mom loves, “Sweet Caroline.” He’s confused at first, but apparently he’s the only one caught off guard by the weird music choice, because it seems like everyone else crammed into the park is already singing along.
“Yeah, okay, Dean,” Sam says, leaning over and pressing a soft kiss to the top of Jess’ head. “You keep telling yourself that. Just make sure you let us know when the wedding’s gonna be, okay?”
“‘A few’ is a few too many,” Charlie tells him. “Your article is rad, dude. Don’t let some trolls who want to bitch about the Colt ruin your day.” When Cas doesn’t respond, she looks at him hesitantly. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
Dean glares at him before reaching around to place empty plates in front of each of them, saving the elaborately arranged plate of lobster rangoons for last. “Don’t let this joker stop you from enjoying your food. Chef outdid himself tonight,” he says, offering them an apologetic smile.
He’s gorgeous, of course, but Cas also sees a warmth in him that he’s immediately drawn to, almost more so than his eyes or his arms or his smile. He looks selfless, which is something Cas hadn’t expected from someone who could legally be considered an adonis.
Dean flashes him a small, humorless grin. “I’d flunk out in a second, and you know it. Plus, no rules, no one to report to: I kind of like being my own boss.”
He rolls over onto his back and groans, opening his eyes and staring up at the ceiling as he curses whoever’s outside for ruining his moment. Oliver doesn’t seem bothered; he’s still curled up in the corner of the bed, snoozing away. Cas sighs and stretches, ignoring the insistent knocking for a few more seconds—out of spite or laziness, he can’t say.
As he gathers his things into his messenger bag and pulls a sweater over his head in preparation against the cold outside, he tries to focus on the positives.
And Dean doesn’t know why, exactly, but he needs Cas to know that he wasn’t joking. “Seriously, man,” he says. “You were good. You
Cas’ eyes shoot up immediately, a blush rushing from his neck up his face, all the way to the tips of his ears. He closes the book and looks at the cover; sure enough,
“Yeah. It wasn’t--” He pauses, searching for the right words. “I didn’t handle it well,” he amends. “I co--”
“I know.” Dean shrugs before wiping away a few stray crumbs from his mouth. “You wanted to make sure I was okay the other day,” he says simply. “I want to make sure you’re okay, too.”
Cas doesn’t think about it before he closes up the space between them by pulling Dean into a hug, something Dean seems to be just as surprised by as he is, judging by the way his arms stay stiff at his sides. After a second, though, Cas can feel Dean’s arms wrap around his torso and link behind his back, and the pressure of Dean returning the hug, resting his forehead against the top of Cas’ shoulder, feels better than any hug Cas has ever gotten.
“Do you know what’s going on?” Cas asks, bending down to finally take a few seconds and tie the laces of his boots.
Later that day, Dean is ready for his two-on-one with Lisa. The makeup team has worked their magic on his face, concealing the bruises and swelling until they’re practically invisible, and with the date theme being “winter wonderland,” they’d given Dean an extra thick scarf and hat, as well. Alastair had been escorted out of the mansion, but according to the producers, Lisa hadn’t yet heard about the altercation.
anymore--sucks ass.” The phrase would’ve caused a flurry of panic to well up low in Cas’ chest and make him dissolve into apologies, but he can hear the traces of a smile in Dean’s words, and decides to play along instead.
Dean’s eyes dart toward his brother’s voice, watching as he points toward a woman navigating a railroad handcar toward them. Sam looks over his shoulder and gestures for them to get ready to hop on.
Dean purses his lips in thought before saying, “I’m pissed I missed being able to see your face the first time you saw my ridiculously good-looking self. Does that count?”
Dean laughs and leans over, planting a kiss on Cas’ neck. “We’ll just have to come back when it’s not as crowded then, huh?”
Gabe’s face softens at that, but he still smirks. “Oh, I see how it is,” he says, leaning against the frame melodramatically. “Ditch your beloved roommate for a crush. Fine.”
“Come on, now,” Balthazar says, trying a different tactic. “They even have bingo.” He waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
After a transfer and way too many delays than a four-stop ride should take, Dean and Cas arrive at Copley station and make their way up to the street, Cas’ fingers laced with Dean’s as he leads them toward the Marathon’s finish line.
Castiel perks up at this. “Really?” It’s admirable that this Dean person wants to run the Marathon, but Castiel can understand how being blind might get in the way of an aspiration like that. Regardless, though, he still finds himself interested in
Dean rolls his eyes, but can’t help the grin on his face as he takes Cas’ hand, letting their fingers twine together. “Fine, you big baby,” he says, prompting Cas to give his hand a gentle squeeze.
He wishes he could rub it in Sam’s face that he hasn’t been thinking about the anxious baker and his stupid eyes and his goddamn fucking bakery since the tasting, he wishes it so fucking much, but he can’t, because he has. The shy, slightly awkward, ridiculously attractive baker has barely left Dean’s mind since he, Sam, and Jess left Bumblebee Bakery. He shouldn’t be feeling like this, at the very least he shouldn’t be acting so
“I guess I’ll just wing it. Lisa Braeden,” he says, savoring the sound of her name in his mouth. “I know you know I thought this whole show was a load of [bleep].” She smiles, her eyes shining, and Dean grins, his chest swelling slightly before continuing. “But, I mean, that was before I stepped out of that limo the first night. Holy [bleep] was I not expecting you. I mean, I knew you were gorgeous in photos and on TV, but in person, it's just—you're beautiful, Lis.”
Dean flashes her an overly sweet smile and rests his chin on his hands like he’s posing for a cheesy senior portrait. “You’re the best, Bradbury.” She scoffs and flips him off.
He rereads this sentence four, five, six times, and circles it just as many, and with each and every circle, he’s more and more certain that it’s true.
She laughs, but Dean knows a pity laugh when he hears one—unfortunately—and clears his throat. “I’m probably drivin’ you up a wall, huh?”
"Jesus," the kid mumbles, slumping down to the floor, his back against the wall. He pulls out his phone, punches in a few numbers, then holds it to his ear.
“Relax,” Dean says. “They’re not looking at you.” He takes a long sip of his coffee and nods at them over the cup; that seems to do the trick. They smile and go back to their own breakfasts. “You got any plans today?”
Dean chuckles, and before Cas can really process it, he feels his boyfriend’s lips brush against his cheek in a quick kiss. Normally, he’d be thrilled at Dean’s small show of affection, but they’d agreed to continue keeping the PDA and flirtations in public to a minimum for the next few days—or at least the rest of the afternoon—so he claps a hand to his face, startled, with Dean looking like he’d just gotten caught fulfilling a particularly bold dare on the playground.
“Well, Lisa’s loss is our gain,” she says. “I’d much rather talk to you for an hour than Michael, and I think everyone here agrees.”
Castiel sighs, tracing his finger along the three lines under his name. He would've at least appreciated a picture of the guy.
They continue to walk in silence, and Castiel has to prevent his mind from wandering as he leads Dean down the street, extra wary of any potential obstacles that could trip them up. The sun is starting to peek up from between the trees, and Castiel feels a pang of disappointment at the fact that soon it won’t just be him and Dean here in this quiet little world.
They slide out and away from each other, arms extended, until Dean reaches for his hand, twirling him around and then extending his arm back out, being careful not to let go of his hand. The guy takes over at that, leading him over to the bench—and what Dean’s been dreading for days on end.
Gabe studies himself in the mirror for a few more seconds. He’s wearing a light violet three-piece suit and matching tophat, with a dark purple pocket square and matching shoes. He tips his hat at his own reflection before shaking his head. “Jealousy is
Dean pauses, pretending to consider this. After a second, he makes to grab the bag, but wraps his fingers around Cas’ wrist instead. He pulls him forward against his chest and looks down at the bags in Cas’ arms—
“Jesus,” Cas breathes, shaking his head again and running a hand through his hair before picking up the pace to catch up with his brothers.
Out of nowhere, an ear-piercing whistle sounds from between them, and both Sam and Dean turn to stare at Cas. He’s still got two fingers to his mouth in prime whistling position, and once he’s sure he’s got their attention, he lowers his hand. “I’ve got kin nearby.”
There’s a soft knock on the edge of Cas’ cubicle, and he looks up to see his boss and the company’s head copywriter, Naomi, looking at him.
Instead of starting up the stairs like he’d expected, though, he feels pain blossom in his nose as he slams into someone. His breath leaves him in a quick, sharp exhale as he stumbles backward, hands scrabbling for the wall behind him as he tries to find purchase.
Dean blinks awake a few hours later to the weight of Cas’ body still pressed up against him, and he grins to himself. The sun’s starting to peek through the trees, and it’s such a different picture from the last time he’d watched the sun come up, such a one-eighty, that he can’t help but start humming the chorus of a song their ma’d always sing when he and Sam were kids, over and over and over.
Bigger fish, indeed—Dean gets that as the goon who had a gun on Sam drives them out into god-knows-where while Crowley leers at them from the front seat, casually aiming the gun back and forth between the both of them.
“Gun to the spine,” Dean murmurs, stumbling a little when Crowley jabs the gun deeper into his back as they’re forced outside and shoved into the backseat of a waiting car. “What’d I tell you.”
He’s already been shoved out of his comfort zone with this whole thing, so what the hell--he’ll just push himself out a little bit more.
“We’ll get to that. But first, Fergus Crowley,” he says, sticking out a pudgy hand, and Dean’s half-convinced the man’s got more rings than he does fingers.
were the ones paying him.” He leans forward and snaps his fingers in front of Dean’s face. “Wake up, Dean--he likes you.” He grins mischievously at his older brother. “And I think you like him, too.”
“Step down,” Cas says, “in three, two, one.” He and Dean step off the curb and onto the street smoothly, and Cas takes an extra minute to make sure they’re in the right position. “This is it,” he finally says softly, looking down at the blue-and-yellow finish line under their feet. “Right below you, Dean.”
, right?” She starts typing quickly, the screen’s glow bouncing faintly off the lenses of her glasses. “They keep getting my hopes up, then breaking my heart week after week. When’s the last time a new issue came out, anyway?”
Dean grins widely, that same goddamn shit-eating grin that Cas hated but now can’t picture his life without, and pulls Cas in for another kiss.
have a spark inside him; it just wasn’t for fighting, and that’s the exact opposite of what his parents had been hoping to hear.
. Billie finishes up the last few chords, and the studio bursts into a barrage of laughter and cheers and hollers.
Cas snuggles closer, tracing a finger along Dean’s thigh, then trailing down slowly to his knee. “You always said you’re a stickler for details. Tell me a story, Dean Winchester.”
Cas has never considered meeting a car, but Dean’s excitement is palpable, so he agrees. He hands Dean his cane, and they make their way to the garage.
Dean takes a long breath, digging down deep in his chest for all the air hidden down there. He doesn’t have to do this; he doesn’t have to do
Cas gapes at him, struggling to find the right words. “Dean, I, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I didn’t--”
Dean purses his lips and gazes far out in the general direction of where the ship is docked. “I know the captain. I think he’ll wait for us,” he says with a wink, and motions for Cas to follow him, but Cas stops short.
If he’d had the opportunity, he actually might’ve gone through with it, but before he can act on the impulse, Dean’s snapped out of whatever trance he’d been in, taking unsteady steps backward.
Dean chuckles hollowly. “That was my stance, too. Hey, uh, listen…” He looks around, as if he’s looking for someone in particular, when his eyes finally land back on Lisa. “Can I be totally honest?”
He’s in the middle of trying to figure out which role he’d be cast as--Oblivious Object of Affection or Pining Best Friend--when he realizes something that might end up being important: Cas doesn’t have his phone number.
When Cas had heard the news, he’d been relieved. The last thing he’d wanted was to have to fight in any way, shape, or form; being assigned to Station 1237 meant that he’d be away from his parents’ opinions while still having plenty of time to perfect his medical skills, and it practically guaranteed that he would see little to no action.
“Just picturing little baby Cas as a freshman,” Dean says with a grin. “You’re tellin’ me you didn’t gawk at these things when you first moved in?”
Dean huffs out a laugh; it’s all he can do. He looks up at the sky and sees blue. Cas’ blue. “Cas would’ve noticed something was off about him,” he murmurs.
“Is this date for me or Ben?” she asks with a grin, wrapping one hand around the back of Dean’s neck and pulling him toward her for a kiss.
Cas juts his chin out and maintains eye contact, forcing Dean to stare into the blue eyes he’s spent so long trying to avoid, lest he fall even deeper into whatever the hell
“Drop it, Sam,” Dean interrupts. “All’s I want is a good night’s sleep, that’s it. No interrogations. No sentimental talk. Not tonight.”
“Yeah.” Dean starts to peel himself away from Cas--much to Cas’ disappointment--and gets to his feet, his cane ready to go in one hand, his free hand held out to help Cas up, too. “We’re here, might as well see it, right?”
Castiel sighs and wishes he was back with Sam and Anna eating Boston cream donuts and drinking coffee.
His heart lurches when some color drains from Dean’s face and he looks down. He must be taking too long to respond. But what does he say? How do people react to someone having feelings for them
“You try to scream and I’ll cut out your tongue,” Alistair says softly, showing Winchester the gleaming knife tucked away in its sheath at his hip. With that, Alistair releases his hold on Winchester’s hair, tugs at the knot at the back of his head, and pulls the gag out of his mouth.
As they approach the entrance, their driver digs into his back pocket for his own passport, then taps it against his closed window with a quick, “Y’all are going to need these.”
Along the way, he eventually stops to pick up Lisa, who’s waiting outside the local florist with a small bouquet of flowers in hand. Dean pulls up to the sidewalk, smooth and sultry like he’s done it a thousand times before, and reaches across the seats to shove open the passenger side door.
Castiel stands there, trying to grapple with the conflicting emotions running wild within him. Dean’s being an asshole, which, if he’s being truthful, Castiel is sort of turned on by.
He picks a nearby group—a couple of Charlie’s kids rehearsing in front of a handful of his, who are sitting cross-legged in front of them, sketching furiously—and after about forty minutes of sketching, has moved onto shading when Charlie knocks him gently with her shoulder to get his attention.
The woman standing on the other side of the customer service counter stares daggers at Castiel, hands on her hips and a
“Uh, this is Castiel Novak. Cas. My…” Dean’s voice trails off as he realizes that this is the first time he’s said it aloud. “My boyfriend.”
“Yeah, well, that’s likely comin’ a hell of a lot sooner than you think,” Bobby grouses, taking a seat in his own worn-out recliner in the corner. “What were you two thinkin’, springing the coop like that? And taking
She keeps going, sharp-tongued and ready for every question Heyerdahl or Judge Turner throws her. She stands her ground, demanding a pardon on their behalf, and hell, she’d have Dean convinced even if it weren’t his ass on the line.
Cas nods and gives her a quick, forced smile that looks just genuine enough to get her out of the room. Once he hears the door click shut behind her, Cas allows all the tension to flood out of his body and he flops down on the bed, staring at the ceiling.
Well, they can fuck off. He’s given them more than they deserve, and he closes his eyes, biting on the inside of his cheek to keep his face emotionless save for a small, tight-lipped smile.
Two more counts, and then they lean back in, pretending to unlock something (yeah, yeah, Dean knows it’s meant to signify their hearts, but he doesn’t need to admit that right now) with nonexistent keys. They throw the keys over their shoulders just as the song ends, left to stand just a few inches from each other.
“Back to your corners,” she says distractedly. “He’ll be here any minute; we can’t have his first impression of us be a fight.”
Cas smacks his open palm against Dean’s leg, trying to keep the smile out of his voice. “Shut up, that’s how it looks.”
Cas looks up at Zachariah, who’s watching him intently. His face is carefully blank, but Cas can still see a tiny spark of interest and hope in his eyes. He wants this article as much as Cas wants this job, and for once, it’s clear to Cas how much power he has in this situation. He takes a deep breath, then gives his editor a small smile.
The sun’s bright outside the courthouse, but that’s all Dean can really register. He walks out in a haze next to Cas, Sam leading the way. Sam looks like he’s barely able to remain standing, and makes a beeline for a tree in a nearby park. He leans against it heavily, and they wait for a few moments until Jessica exits the courthouse, calm as ever. Her eyes go bright when she sees Sam, and she picks up the pace as he runs toward her, scooping her up and spinning around as he kisses her long and hard, making up for lost time.
,” Billie says once Charlie’s given them the thumbs-up that she’s started recording. “There’s drama in
“Yes?” he answers, his voice making the response sound like a question. He pokes his head into the room first like he’s a visitor.
“[Bleep]ing say that again,” Dean says threateningly. “I dare you, [bleep]er. I [bleep]ing dare you.”
“What about him.” Dean’s words are slow and careful, and Cas tries to consider his own just as carefully.
“I know,” he finally says. “And I appreciate it. I gotta say, hell of a right hook on you, though. I wouldn’t want to be on your bad side.” Dean pauses, then shrugs. “Well,
Suddenly, all the fighting skills Cas and his peers had spent their lives learning became necessary, and Cas saw more and more members of the Company come back with wounds--some mild, some fatal, but almost all at the hands of Dean Winchester.
“Hey, dude,” Dean says, waving once at Ben. He looks from one adult to the other, still eyeing the camera especially warily, and doesn’t respond.
“No way,” Hannah says. “Heartthrob frontrunner, one hundred percent. I’d be surprised if he didn’t get the first impression rose, even if the producers have to make Lisa give it to him.”
“Yes,” Castiel says as Sam and Jess lean closer together to study the folder. Dean looks up and he catches Castiel looking at him instead of Sam and Jess; Castiel averts his eyes quickly when Dean’s lock with his. “Let’s get started.”
Her face falls, and she looks like she’s about to argue, but decides otherwise at the last second. “Fair.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “I already showed you all my tattoos, Cas,” he says. “Promise there aren’t any more.”
Dean stops scratching Jack at that, pulling himself upright and looking in the direction of Cas’ voice. “Cas?” he repeats. “Wait, what day is it?”
Dean grins at her, then Charlie, who adjusts a flat cap of her own before beaming at the three of them and going in for hugs.
He’s cut off when Dean’s lips press gently against his own. His eyes are wide, and he’s so stunned he almost forgets to return the kiss. Dean is about to pull back, his body going stiff when Cas doesn’t reciprocate, and Cas scrambles to keep contact. He reaches forward and entwines his fingers behind Dean’s neck, keeping him in place, but Dean hisses in pain through his teeth, and Cas immediately pulls back.
Castiel nods, pushing the pad back toward Sam as he pockets his pen. “Let me know,” he says quickly, making for the front door. Almost immediately after he closes it and starts making his way down the porch and back to his car, Castiel can hear the brothers yelling at each other. He pulls his phone out of his pocket and notices that he’s got a new text from Anna.
“Found it!” Gabe shouts triumphantly, holding up his weathered passport victoriously. He’s just in time, too; their driver has pulled up to the security gate, and a woman who completely personifies everything Cas had feared peers sternly into their car, hand outstretched. Her eyes dart between their passports and their faces, and Gabriel smiles.
Dean’s crooked smile is back, and Cas wants to reach up and trace Dean’s lips with the pads of his fingers before pressing his own lips against them, but he doesn’t.
“Dean, what’s going on?” he asks again, putting his hand over Dean’s batbag to stop him from packing up.
. Dean nods, watching as Cas pulls each of his fingers free from his mouth. He lets his head drop back down against the ground, his sigh quickly turning into a moan as Cas’ now spit-slick hand wraps around his cock. He rolls his hips up against Cas’ weight, and wants to keep his eyes open, but the bliss of pressure all around him has his eyes fluttering closed before he can stop them, his free hand curling tight into the dirt, leaves, his own hair as he moans again.
“I know what a joke is,” Cas says, Dean’s attitude once again overshadowing his gorgeous goddamn face.
They run at a steady pace for about half a mile, their steps in sync with each other, and Castiel smiles to himself.
“I hate you,” Sam hisses, tugging awkwardly at his too-short shirt as they sneak through the grounds. Grabbing the shirts and caps to wear over their own clothes had been a last-minute idea, sure, but Dean feels more hidden wearing the damn things, despite Sam’s bellyaching to the contrary. “So much.”
Dean chuckles. “Not that.” He opens the fridge, and Cas peeks over Dean’s shoulder to look inside. The fridge is divided almost perfectly in half, one side full of healthy foods--salads, chicken, eggs, a nice variety of fruits and vegetables--while the other is full of everything else--hamburger meat, hot dogs, mozzarella cheese, bacon.
He can hear Sam laughing next to him, feels the weight of his little brother’s hand smacking down hard on his shoulder in celebration.
Dean laughs in disbelief. “Never had any need to check out the best goddamn bakery in the city,” he says. “Yeah, okay. How long have you been living here again?”
Cas rolls over onto his back with a groan, then gets to his feet and starts digging around through a suitcase for some shorts and a T-shirt. By the time he’s changed and ready to go, there’s still no sign of his roommate. Cas hefts his bag over his shoulder; he’ll have to meet him later.
“‘Course not, pal,” Dean says slowly, resting a hand on Novak’s shoulder and squeezing. “Just a turn of phrase. Don’t worry about it.” His grin fades away when Novak doesn’t return it, just stares at him. He tries to nod, play it off as just some unspoken banter, then turns around with an exaggerated “Oh-
“Ooh, a ‘sclusie!” Charlie squeals, pulling her chair up closer to their table and resting her chin in her hands. “Dish.”
Dean waits a few more seconds for some kind of verbal answer, but when Cas stays quiet, Dean mouths a long, drawn out “Oooookay” to himself.
“This is nice,” Cas says honestly, taking a sip of his beer. He burrows his toes into the sand, tapping them up and down as he gazes out toward the ocean and watches the waves come crashing against the shore. “I understand why you like it here.”
There’s a few seconds of silence as Dean considers the question. Cas can’t blame him; it’s an incredible episode of television. Maybe he’s overwhelmed by the mysterious letter found under Laura’s fingernail in the morgue, or whether or not Bobby Briggs really played a part in Laura’s disappearance, or just the simple fact that everyone and their mother seems to have something to hide, and it’s only the first epis—
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs, but Cas realizes quickly that’s not exactly the case when another runner bumps into Dean, who stumbles again. His heart sinks as he realizes that this is it, this is where he has to start yelling.
Even though he knows that Dean is just teasing him, Cas’ face burns with embarrassment. “No, of course not,” he says quickly, stumbling over his words. “I, no. No.”
“Sure, sure.” Dean loves to give Sam shit, but he knows what he’s saying is true. Sam’d go to bat for anyone down on their luck without a second’s hesitation, anyone who needed help and would’ve had no other way to get it than through the generosity of others.
It’s also the first day he’s felt anything even remotely close to hope, and he intends to ride it all the way to the finish line.
After what feels like an eternity, they finally reach the top of the Hill, and Cas catches a glimpse of the Prudential Center, still far away, looming over them. There’s a band playing off to the side, their enthusiastic marching band music blending in with the constant cheers and whoops and clanging of cowbells, and Cas finds his lips curling into a smile again.
Dean pouts, and Cas is certain that if he had been standing, his boyfriend probably would’ve stomped his foot. “That’s fine,” he says suddenly, grabbing Cas’ laptop and situating it on the coffee table. He enters Cas’ password without a second thought and boots up Zoom. “I know all your hiding places.”
“It doesn’t matter. That just set a bunch of shit off, we were arguing for a while, and she told me competing against girls was enough,” he says quietly. “And that she didn’t want to have to deal with guys, too. At least, that’s the reason she gave.” He chuckles humorlessly to himself before pushing his plate away from him with a single finger. “Didn’t realize I was such a hassle.”
Dean’s expression sours almost immediately at the mention of healthy foods. “Did Sam put you up to this?”
“C’mon, you sons of bitches,” he mutters. He sucks in a breath and waits, stock-still, as a fish starts circling the tiny worm he’d managed to scrounge up and tie to the end of the laces. He refuses to take his eyes off the fish for even one second, watching it dart back and forth as it considers its options.
Another soldier Cas vaguely remembers from training grabs one of the chairs and positions it in the middle of the tent, taking advantage of the man’s disorientation and forcing him down into it, binding his ankles to the wooden legs and adjusting the ropes around his wrists so that they’re tied to the chair, as well. Once they’re sure that he’s secure, Michael and Lucifer step back and they all watch as Alistair reaches forward and yanks the hood away.
Billie lets out a low whistle as they finish reading Dean’s answers, and Charlie’s eyes are shining with glee.
Charlie’s eyes flick up, but she keeps her finger to her lips and shakes her head. “You,” she finally says, pointing at Dean. “You sing lead.”
“Still,” Castiel says. “It feels like I’m rubbing it in your face or something. Bragging. Dangling it over you when you and I both know that you can’t have it.” He doesn’t realize Dean has trailed behind him until the rope goes taut between them; Castiel turns and takes in Dean’s indignant, unamused posture. His head is tilted to the side, his mouth pressed into a thin line.
Cas lands on his back on the bed with a satisfied grunt, struggling to keep an eye on Dean, who's shedding the rest of his clothes, as he tugs his own sweater over his head. He starts trying to wriggle out of his jeans, but he only gets them halfway down his thighs when he feels Dean tug them the rest of the way off roughly, unceremoniously. His hands are warm and firm against Cas, and Cas sighs into Dean’s mouth as he leans down to kiss him.
Sam does the same, disappointed but not surprised, and Crowley tilts his chin up toward the pile of cash, gesturing for his goon to pick it up. Dean watches, eyes flicking between Crowley and their cash being stuffed into a small leather bag that’s then deposited at Crowley’s feet.
There are a ton of things he needs to start researching, and Cas decides to start by typing “training for a marathon” into Google’s search bar. Almost immediately, he’s barraged with about 93,000,000 results telling him the best way to train, the best after-workout snacks, how to build his diet around his running regimen, and more.
Dean stops short at that, the line he’d been drawing going jagged, but he recovers quickly. “Dunno what to tell you,” he says. “Business as usual.”
No matter how much Dean tries to convince himself of the opposite, he knows Charlie’s not going to give up until he fills her in. He sighs, running a hand through his hair and tucking his pencil behind his ear.
Cas pauses, and Dean tries not to notice how Cas had stiffened slightly at the question. “Uh, my ex, actually.”
“Cheers,” Dean says, clinking their glasses together before closing his eyes and taking a drink. “To, uh, literature. Or whatever.”
Dean’s next text is nothing more than a thinking emoji, and Cas has to resist the urge to hurl his phone across the room.
“Love me some reality TV. Just like you.” Cas just barely catches the, “And whorin’ myself out on it,” he tags onto the end. The phrase is oddly specific, and it only takes him a moment to place it, as part of an episode review posted on a trashy reality TV site by a blogger who had been particularly brutal during fantasy suites. Cas is surprised that Dean had even gotten wind of it; the blogger didn’t have more than a few hundred followers, and Dean doesn’t strike Cas as someone who’d Google himself.
Dean shoots him a halfhearted smile, still rubbing the back of his head. “All part of the plan,” he says. “Guarantee Heyerdahl will be pissed off well into the afternoon after that mess. More flustered he is, easier it’ll be for us.”
Cas is dozing, half-asleep in his chair when he hears the rustling of grass and someone entering the tent. He jolts awake and quickly tries to compose himself while making it look like no, of course he hadn’t been sleeping on the job,
Cas stares up into Dean’s green eyes, and before he can second-guess himself, he grabs a fistful of Dean’s shirt and gently tugs him down, pressing their lips together in a longer kiss.
offer up information about their mother’s death to millions of people on national TV; in fact, when Cas thinks about it, he’s surprised Dean’s even still got the post up at all.
His voice is grating, and Cas ignores him as he continues his banter with Gabe, craning his neck for a glimpse of Dean through the sea of people milling around the room. He tries his best to hide the way his shoulders slump when he doesn’t find any sign of him.
Dean huffs out a disbelieving laugh. “Just a little bit, yeah.” He eats a couple more fries before adding, “They good as you hoped?”
“Nothing to tell,” Dean mumbles, tossing his bag onto the table and rummaging through the fridge for a beer.
Cas grins to himself at his college memories as he clicks over to his DVR, which is when he realizes that he’s still got 15 episodes of
Dean closes his eyes and digs his hands deep into his pockets to try and pull himself together. He’s jerked back to reality when he hears Charlie tapping against the glass window of the studio with a clipboard; he’s gotta make a note to thank her later.
” he asks quietly, raising an eyebrow. Dean’s cheeks go pink at whatever the man just said, and he shakes his head, his eyes wide.
Dean unconsciously bites on his lower lip at the sound of his name in Cas’ mouth, and he grins down at the dusty barn floor as he continues to listen to the message.
“What if I did something to upset him?” Cas asks, his stomach doing flips at the thought that yes, he absolutely did.
He’s started mentally preparing himself to walk past Cas when Sam pipes up again. “Hey, Dean? It’s a little hot out.”
Cas lets Dean decide when to break the hug, and when he does, Cas feels him thump his hand against Cas’ back.
Cas’ last walk of shame had been during his sophomore year in college, but he doesn’t remember it being nearly as nerve-wracking as this one.
He’s taken at least eight pictures before he realizes that he’s spacing out, and quickly takes the camera away from his eye. “I took a few,” he explains sheepishly, handing the camera back to Aiden’s dad.
and suggest that they discuss fan theories during intermission when the theatre lights start to fade, and everyone begins cheering and clapping again. Cas gives him one last glance and mouths a quick, “Thank you” before the entire theatre goes dark.
Cas glances at the bag in Dean’s hand. “Kale,” he says, which causes Dean to promptly toss the bag away like he’s been scalded. “Oh, come on,” Cas says, walking gingerly over to Dean and reaching for the bag, “it’s not that bad. You might actually like it.”
“Only one Novak at this table,” he says proudly, easing back down into his seat. “You’re lookin’ at a bona fide Milton right here. But let’s not change the subject. How ‘bout it, Dean-o? You were gone for a while there. Your pa go the train route too?”
Cas nods and offers one more small, closed-lipped smile before turning his attention to setting out the cookies.
He doesn’t say anything, but must still look like a nervous wreck, because Anna drops his hands and sits down on the bench, patting the spot next to her for him to do the same.
She jabs him in the chest with her finger and nods. “I know lead singers when I see ‘em. Front and center, prettyboy.” When Dean doesn’t move, she grabs him by the arm and drags him in front of the microphone before nodding at the rest of them and hopping into the soundbooth.
Cas shakes his head. Of course he doesn't mind if they talk about it later, which implies that Dean's not bored with him, fully intends to talk to him in the future, and might be willing to share something more personal with him, something he doesn't tell just anyone.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas jams his hands into his pockets, unsure of what to say. He doesn’t trust himself not to fuck things up again, so he stays silent.
The kitten doesn't respond, and Cas sighs. No matter how much he doesn’t want to be in the studio for this particular recording, it’s still a commitment, despite the fact that his parents and some of his more practical siblings might call it a waste of time since he doesn’t get paid.
Gabe glances up at Cas from his position on the piano and puckers his lips up in an air kiss. “I’ll throw you off this piano,” Cas threatens. Charlie snaps her fingers in front of them, trying to wrangle their attention like a pack of puppies, and Cas turns toward her.
Dean likes to tell folks that he and Sam ended up here after getting caught doing something full of bravado and old-school cool, running a speakeasy or robbing a bank like in the movies. Sometimes he’d spend lunchtime waxing poetic about the wild streak in him and his brother, the car chase they got in trying to avoid the cops, the way he’d taken down four officers—four!—single handedly before he and Sam were betrayed by their partner and left to pay the price for all three of ‘em.
As far as Cas is concerned, she’s the perfect contestant for 2020, and she’d been quick to prove him right, starting from the first night. Ruby had dozens of guys to choose from, but from the very beginning, she’d only had eyes for one. Dick Roman, CEO of Roman Industries, had her smitten the second he slid out of the limo, all smooth talk and creepily well-defined cheekbones.
Dean raises his eyebrows, blinks a few times to try and register the fact that apparently, Cas would rather sit next to whatever the fuck that smell is than Dean, and he feels like he’s been punched in the gut.
the good stuff, there we go,” Balthazar says, tapping his palms on the back of the driver’s seat as Gabe throws the passenger door open and climbs back inside.
“Ha! He’s excited, too,” she says. There’s no response, so she continues. “Aren’t you, quiet guy near the back reading...
Cas smacks Dean’s arm with it then, and Dean chuckles. “Fuck off,” he says, shoving playfully at Cas before turning his full attention back to the road.
“You can say that again,” Dean mumbles, pulling Cas close and pressing a kiss into his hair. Cas rests his hand on Dean’s chest, watching the way it rises and falls with every breath, and just feeling Dean’s warmth next to him, the way his fingers curl around his shoulder and chin rests against the side of his head, Cas knows that he could spend the entire day like this.
“Seriously,” Sam says, “it’s nothing. I gotta go, though.” He digs into his back pocket and pulls out a twenty, dropping it onto the table. “I’ll see you guys later, though. Nice to meet you, Cas.” He smiles at Cas, then adds to Dean, “Call me sometime, huh, asshole?”
“Can I…” Cas trails off, deciding to answer his question himself. He gently pulls his hand away from Dean’s lips, working it out of Dean’s grip until he’s got Dean’s hand in his own. He slowly brings it forward until Dean’s open palm is resting against his own cheek, then drops his hand to his lap, waiting to see what Dean would do next.
“What d’you think I’m doing?” Dean wipes his palms on his already damp shirt before cutting through the last few links. Pulling himself up into a crouch, he’s careful not to cut himself as he pulls the loose fence back and holds it open for Sam to crawl through.
“Nah, he’s gotta pull a left before that,” Dean interjects, leaning forward and resting his elbows on the open window frame.
She smiles, and boy has Dean missed seeing that adoration on Sammy’s face. “As it turns out, you can do a lot more when you’ve had time to practice. So I say,” she says, gripping Sam by the lapels of his shirt and pressing a chaste kiss to his lips, “let’s get you your license, Samuel.”
It’s almost sad, Dean thinks, rotating one ankle, then another, listening to the way the chains clank together in the darkness, mixing with the sounds of Sam’s snores and Novak’s steady breathing beside him. After all this time, they’ll be gone soon. They’ve become second-nature to him, so much so that it feels wonky for him to walk the few times a day he’s
When Cas looks up again, Gabe’s grinning widely, and he immediately wants to retract his statement. He digs into his pocket and hands Cas a badly crumpled plane ticket. Cas stares at it the second it hits his palm, then looks up at his brother. “Are you kidding me?”
Cas can feel his cheeks start to redden as Dean laughs. He gets to his feet and before Cas can process the fact that this cute—no,
Lisa and Dean continue to kiss for a few more seconds before Lisa breaks the kiss. Dean keeps his eyes trained on her lips for a few seconds more before looking back up at her.
Fifteen minutes later, Dean’s in a tank top and shorts and trying to hide as much of himself behind his yoga mat as possible. Lisa is waiting for him in the lobby, and her face lights up when she sees him.
,” Billie says. “Tweet us your engagement picks and who’s gonna crash and burn. We don’t have any swag to send you, but you’ll get bragging rights, and that’s just as good.”
Cas doesn’t know what he’d been expecting, maybe a brewery or a music shop, but the narrow little street in front of them swarming with people wasn’t it. He glances uncertainly at Dean, half-expecting him to admit that this is some kind of prank, that his real favorite place is still to come.
“Don’t act like you haven’t gotten something good outta my damn expertise,” Dean says, shoving his brother playfully. “You’ve had nicer hair than Jessica ever since you became a Dapper Dan man.”
Cas’ opens his mouth to respond, his cheeks burning, but before he can think of anything to add, Dean pushes open the door, gives him a quick wink, and is gone.
“No, no, it’s good,” Dean says. He reaches across the table and takes her hand, eyes traveling up and up until they lock with hers. “I like her, too.”
Anna is silent on the other end of the line, but he can practically see her lips pressing into a thin, pissed off line. “That was five years ago, Castiel.”
With a sharp inhale, Dean shoots bolt upright and is thrown headfirst back into the night his whole world turned upside-down. Sam’s still sleeping soundly, just like he was before their entire house went up in flames, taking their mom with them. Dean can still feel the heat pouring off their house as it burned, the weight of Sam in his arms as he watched his dad try to reenter the house for their mother, the dead-eyed stare on his face as he realized he couldn’t.
“I love the show,” Cas says, “it’s incredible, but whenever I listen to it, I always sort of think of him, you know?”
Sam throws himself between the two of them at that, holding his hands out placatingly. “I think what Dean was trying to say—” he throws a look over his shoulder at Dean, a look that says
Before his can finish, the man’s eyes brighten in recognition, and he cuts Castiel off. “Dean’s running partner?”
Cas doesn’t even have to answer; the awed look on his face must say enough, because Dean’s already smiling that stupid crooked grin that Cas loves so much.
A quick scan of the fence shows there aren’t any weak spots for him to take advantage of, so he settles on a spot nestled deep in the shadows, far away from the warden’s spotlight cutting every so often through the night. Dean ignores the mud soaking into his pants when he drops to his knees and starts fiddling with the chain link along the perimeter of the grounds. He’s careful as he works, snipping at the metal with the bolt cutters as quietly as he can, but the twang as the metal snaps still sounds deafening in his ears, echoing through the night.
runner-up 2018, the man who captured America’s hearts the second he stepped out of the limo, and the man Cas hasn’t been able to stand for just as long, is standing in the doorway to their studio.
This time, it’s Dean’s turn to laugh. He moves his hands down to Cas’ hips and pulls him close, bringing their foreheads together once more. “So, what d’ya say,” he starts, teasing at Cas’ pants, “interested in trying our luck?”
“‘Course not! He didn’t slave over a hot oven for however long it took to make these like we did. Now come on, show me some of this other healthy shit while we wait for those.”
Dean wipes his forehead with the back of his hand in feigned relief. “Glad we’ve gotten that out of the way. So what is it, then?”
.” He’s about to turn tail and order goddamn room service—he’s nowhere near drunk enough to deal with this—when Gabe, who so clearly knew about this part of the evening beforehand, slings an arm across his shoulders and tugs him in close.
“Clearly,” Cas murmurs, not loud enough for her to hear him. He stumbles forward as someone else slaps him between the shoulderblades, and looks over his shoulder to see one of the guys hoisting his bag with his catcher’s gear over one shoulder.
,” Balthazar says, eyes lit up in delight. He leans forward and stares at Cas intently. “Is it the steward?”
Victor glances down at his shirt: after a particularly sentimental one-on-one earlier in the week, Lisa had given him a rose, effectively marking him safe from elimination during that week’s rose ceremony.
It’s a straight shot to the only building on the grounds, a hulking, faded old thing that somehow still manages to stand strong and intimidating in the night. As easy as it would be to dart straight across, it’s too risky for them to be out in the open, so they stick to the perimeter. Before they can get too far, though, the beam of a flashlight swipes across the grass, and he’s gotta practically hop up into Sam’s arms to avoid getting caught in its beam.
The idea of going into his heart-to-heart with Anna about just how much he likes Dean isn’t especially high on Cas’ to-do list just yet, and he shrugs even though he knows Dean can’t see him. “That you must be different than you seemed on TV, or else there’s no way I’d be with you.”
Cas nods, turning his attention back to the rest of Dean’s classroom. “I’ve got to come here more often,” he murmurs.
franchise that whoever gets driven to the final rose ceremony first is a fucking goner, so he had been hoping for some kind of a hint as to his fate. Sure enough, though, the driver shakes his head.
“Are you okay, Dean?” Cas asks softly, and Dean looks at him. He worries his bottom lip with his teeth, and Cas can’t tell if it’s a trick of the rapidly diminishing light, but he thinks he can see Dean’s eyes going glassy.
The door to Cas’ room is propped open when he finally manages to lug all his gear back to his dorm, and he sighs. Introducing himself to so many people, having to keep track of sixteen new names and faces--not to mention focusing on one in particular--had exhausted him enough; he’d forgotten about having a new roommate to meet on top of it all.
“You can bet on it,” she says. He puckers his lips and blows her a quick, microscopic kiss that makes her face go as pink as her dress before heading inside. “[
Cas feels like Moses parting the Red Sea--runners take notice of them, and give them space. Nobody yells at him or gives him a dirty look like he’d spent the weeks before the race fearing; they just listen to him, and they move. Some of them even let out an energetic cheer as they pass, which Dean returns tenfold. Cas is about to smile like he normally does, but instead, he finds himself laughing before sending an encouraging whoop out to nobody in particular. He feels a quick jerk on the rope and looks at Dean, who’s beaming at him.
Cas and Charlie are motionless. After a few seconds, Charlie reaches out and absently smacks Cas’ arm.
A producer tries to discourage him from off-camera, and Dean turns a gloved, pixelated middle finger in their direction.
“Dean,” Cas hisses behind him. It sounds too much like he’s about to pick an argument, and Dean doesn’t have time for that; none of them do.
Cas makes his way down the hallway toward the living room, which is silent, and Cas wonders for a second if Dean is still asleep. The old wood of the floor creaks under his feet, and Cas hesitantly peeks into the room.
He’s heading to the breakroom when he feels a tap on his shoulder, and he turns around to see a harried woman with a small baby balanced on her hip and a toddler wrapped nervously around her right leg. She’s got a badly wrinkled museum map in her hand, and she looks at Castiel expectantly.
to drop off in Dean's room. It's only 9:00, Dean would still be in his 8am, so Cas leaves it with Mike. He walks back to his room, still riding the ends of the emotional high he got last night, when he sees a note on his and Gabe's door that he didn't notice when he left. It's taped under his name tag, and written on a jagged piece of lined paper, as if someone hastily ripped it out of their notebook.
, and Cas has trouble trying to hide the way his body jolts at the noise as he sits down between Gabe and Samandriel. Gabe nods at him, and Samandriel gives him a soft smile.
“The camera loves me,” he says with a shrug that doesn’t feel natural, but is enough to make Dean throw his head back and laugh as he walks his phone back to him.
“Think you can stop being a good person for two minutes?” Dean mutters, grabbing the flashlight away from Sam as they head deeper into the pen. “Two minutes ain’t too much to ask, is it?”
He’d had plans for the place when he first arrived—murals and mini galleries and other Dean Winchester originals—but after forcing Sammy to help him lug ten different paint cans and three duffels full of supplies into his new classroom on a Sunday afternoon, he realized that the space isn’t his, and he shouldn’t be decorating it as such.
you saying? How else are we supposed to find out if he's in jail without putting ourselves at risk? We don’t know he’s even there.”
Dean wraps an arm around Cas’ waist, slipping his hand subtly into Cas’ back pocket as they watch the happy couple be reunited. “I could lift you up like that if you wanted,” he tells Cas with a wink.
There's a loud clattering of trays coming from the back room, and then a slightly flustered--but still ridiculously attractive, Dean is quick to note--man bursts out into the bakery. “I am
“That doesn’t matter,” she interrupts. “The only important thing here is that he, like all of you, is practically a child, and has gotten his entire life taken away by this war.” She pauses, and Cas can tell how uncomfortable she is with the idea of arguing. “And now he's hurt, correct?”
“Here.” Cas stays still, waiting until he feels Dean behind him. Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ waist and rests his chin on Cas’ shoulder before planting a soft kiss on his neck.
Their driver, a lanky guy with a mullet and a hat that’s probably older than Cas himself, follows Gabe’s hands longingly as they dig into the paper bag. “We also accept non-monetary tips, my man.”
“Fine,” Cas says cautiously. It’s weird seeing Naomi out in the wild; she never comes out of her office for anything if she can help it. He gets it, Cas is an introvert himself, but his boss takes “recluse” to a whole new level. “Is everything okay?”
“Christ, Winchester, watch it!” a voice yells above the music, and Cas’ eyelids flutter as he tries to regain his composure as well as remain conscious. He presses one hand over his nose and uses the other to start scrambling backward across the beer-soaked floor. He has to get out of here. Sticky, warm blood is trickling through his fingers and he prays that nobody steps on his hand; the last thing he needs is a broken finger or three on top of a broken nose.
. His crooked grin and bright green eyes make it clear that he’s ready to play and take anyone who’s willing with him. He’s toned and muscled, but not overly so.
Cas is considering a particularly tempting cluster of Italian cookies when Dean shoves a small white bag into his hands. “Moment of truth,” he says. “Let’s go.”
Cas’ head spins as he tries to make sense of the words coming out of Zachariah’s mouth. He could stop all this so easily, he could change his mind and agree to write the story, he could keep his job and get a raise and make some incredible connections, and--
“Your mystery kin got tools to get us outta these?” Dean asks, sticking his leg out and giving it a shake.
He’d be lying if he said that he wasn’t trying to tamp down the disappointment deep in his gut at that thought, though.
Cas hesitates, unsure if the question is rhetorical or not, but then adds a soft, "I'd appreciate it."
Dean shakes his head sharply. No use in yearning for things he hasn’t had in years, things that are impossible for him to get back, no matter how much he wishes for the opposite.
It only takes a few minutes for Cas to confirm why so many viewers loved Sam during his brief time on the show, and to understand why he means so much to Dean. He’s smart and quick and funny and warm, and seeing the way he and Dean exchange banter makes him wish that he had a better relationship with more of his own siblings.
When Cas has taken in as much of the scene as he can, he turns and faces Dean with wide, stunned eyes. “Dean, I...what is this?”
It’s quiet, so quiet that Dean barely catches it, but he’s pretty sure he hears Cas answer with something along the lines of, “I don’t think you’ll have to worry about that.”
“Yeah, well, he sure as shit ain’t here now, is he?” Dean sounds pissed, and he is, but he’s also scared, something that’s been drilled into him as awful, weak, the worst thing you can be. And he’ll be damned if he lets his little brother see him that way.
“Oh. Yes.” Castiel pulls the rope out of his pocket and hands one end to Dean. Dean snatches it and barely even waits for Castiel before starting out at a slow jog, setting their pace for the morning.
put on the fridge: a drawing of the two of them and their Tuesday night pizza. He’s just starting in on Sam’s ridiculous mane of hair when Rowena MacLeod practically floats her way into the breakroom like some kind of pixie. She’s been at Thompson for two years, but climbed to the top of the chemistry department after only three semesters. She’s another one Dean never really works with directly, but he won’t let that sweet Scottish accent fool him: he’s heard enough stories about her ferocity to last a lifetime.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean mutters, sinking back deeper into the couch and tipping his latest bottle back.
Dean’s head snaps back sharply against the dirt. He can taste blood welling in his mouth, and his hands shift from offense to defense as he tries to protect himself from the punches that are still coming. Cas lands a few more—to his jaw, his cheekbone, his nose—before the weight of his body is finally lifted, and Dean, for some fucked up reason, finds himself missing it the moment it’s gone.
“We stopped it,” he says helplessly, letting himself be dragged toward the edge of the stage. “Damn it, we stopped it.”
Sam’s got his disapproving face on, Dean can tell, but he’ll be damned if he gives that look the time of day. “Okay,” he finally says. “Say that’s true. That means we’ve gotta track him, figure out where he was taken.”
“Dean,” Cas says softly, sitting down beside Dean. “Hey, listen t--” He reaches for Dean’s hand only to have Dean try to jerk it away. “Dean!” Cas acts quickly and catches both of Dean’s wrists, holding them in front of him before gently turning his jaw to face him. Dean winces as Cas’ fingers brush against a fresh bruise.
Dean waits for a few seconds before resting his hand on the vacant spot Novak left for him without comment.
But instead he just says, “Yes,” and proceeds to help the woman find an exhibit that’s halfway across the museum. He skirts around the edges of exhibits as much as possible on his way back to the breakroom, trying to make a clean break for his freedom, and once he catches sight of the door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY, he sighs in relief before swiping his ID card and pushing the door open.
The fence surrounding the pen is topped with coils of barbed wire, shiny and threatening in the mist. Dean cranes his neck to look up at them and stays rooted to the spot until he feels Sam’s hand on his shoulder.
His first thought is sarcastic, something along the lines of the fact that a sob story would get Dean more sympathy, more adoration, but he’s already made it clear that he’s not the person Cas had thought he was. No one would
He can just imagine how his friends will react upon hearing this new development, and the thought makes him want to curl up in the corner and continue his life as a hermit. Finger hovering over his phone’s screen, Cas studies the photo until the screen goes dim. By then, he’s made up his mind, taps it back to life, and swipes over to Dean’s profile.
The three of them stay silent, but that only seems to amuse the warden even more. Leaning heavily on the defendant’s table in front of them, hands splayed out, he continues, “And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, gentlemen, but no way you’re getting out of this one. Your fates are already sealed; we’re just dotting
“Nobody knows,” Balthazar mumbles through a yawn. “I would've been fine sleeping through the whole damn thing, but this wanker decided to poke in and throw his boot at me,” he adds, jerking his head toward Raphael, who grins smugly.
“Well, let’s see, here,” Sam says, squinting up ahead of them. “North’s thataway, which means I’d keep following this road here until you get to—”
“Someone took him,” Dean says urgently, his mind refusing to even consider the other option—that Cas had indeed decided to leave them after all—as a possibility. “We need to—”
Cas stumbles, the back of his hand pressed to his mouth. When he looks down at it to see blood, there’s a fire in his eyes Dean’s never seen, not even back at Gabriel’s the night before.
“Hey, you think you could sneak in a little…” The voice falls away as its owner pretends to jab something into his own side. “C’mon, he’ll be so beat up by the time Alistair finishes with him, no one will have even noticed you started the party!”
Judging by the way Dean’s cheeks go pink, the hint of a shy smile playing on his lips, Cas is pretty sure he did.
The wood is hot and brittle under Dean’s hands, but he grits his teeth and keeps going until his feet hit solid ground again. He’s never felt anything like this, the scorched-earth dryness in his throat and the sweat plastering his clothes to his body, but that’s nothing compared to the relief he feels when he scans the ground floor of the barn and his eyes land on—
“What—” His head shoots up and he comes face-to-face with Dean, still grinning, only this time with a bit more of a twinkle in his eye.
Cas sighs and watches as Dean leaves the living room, taking care not to trip over Jack, Rudy, or anything else as he goes. He reappears a few moments later with some more ice and makes his way over to the couch, running his hand along the back of it until he feels Cas, then hands it over.
The sound of their shoes tapping on the concrete floors mixes with Cas’ steady breathing, and Dean tries to calm himself down. They won’t get caught, they’re covering their tracks, they just need to get their asses outside and back to the fence.
He grins down at the car, a sleek, black 1967 Chevy Impala, with a proud gleam in his eye normally reserved for when parents look at their children. He gets into the car and turns the key before backing out of the parking spot and continuing the tour.
a voice over the speaker system booms. Cas is content to stay seated in the hard, tiny seat, but Dean nudges his shoulder.
Cas clears his throat, trying to choose his words carefully. “You know I have a knack for these kinds of things. They both look happy together.” He takes Billie’s copy of the magazine and scrutinizes it, realizing that she’s drawn a heart around their faces in red Sharpie. His head shoots up and he stares at her; she smirks, drawing another heart in the air with her fingers.
His lungs are on fire, his legs are screaming at him, but he’s gotta keep going. He’s close enough to make a jump for it now, and he braces himself. Chest heaving, fingers wrapping tighter around the chains, he’s about to push himself off the ground and into the car when something catches underneath him.
“Lyrics are right in front of you,” she shouts through the glass. They each grab a copy, and Dean scans the words quickly. He remembers the song itself well enough, a number his father used to hum on those same warm nights when they were young and things were normal. As hard as he tries to school his emotions, though, when he looks back up at her, his face must betray the nerves he’s feeling, because she just laughs. “Ain’t you the ones who told me I should get ready for a hit single? Come on, boys,” she says, tapping on the glass with two fingers, “shock and awe me. Billie’ll play you in. In five, four, three, two...”
Oh. Castiel peers in closer to Dean’s mouth, and aside from the red tint, his teeth seem fine, and he tells Dean as such.
“Ain’t supposed to kiss ‘em, either, but that didn’t seem to stop you.” Dean grins at him, clearly loving the way Cas’ cheeks go red. He waggles his fingers, hand still open, and says, “Humor me, huh?”
He assumes he’d accidentally gotten a shot of Anna or one of the officers looking at the camera, so he doesn’t think much of it as he maneuvers his mouse over to the photo to untag it. Upon closer inspection, though, Cas realizes that no, the only person in the photo is the Colt, and the tagging suggestion makes him wonder if he’s even more exhausted than he thought.
Cas manages to keep his lovesick impulses in control for the majority of dinner, but once the three brothers head off toward their respective evening escapades, Cas isn’t especially surprised—maybe a little disappointed in himself and his lack of inner strength, sure, but not
Dean thrashes against the grips holding him in place, eyes brimming with disgust and anger. Blood is dripping from his nose, and his jaw is already swelling and going purple from Alastair’s kick.
They slide the tray onto the rack, being careful to avoid getting burned, and Dean closes the oven door with a flourish. “Sammy’s not getting any of these, just so you know,” he says, and Cas laughs.
“Dean!” the man says, smiling sweetly as he gets to his feet. “You just always seem to pop up—” he reaches over and pulls a gold dollar coin out from behind Dean’s ear, “—out of nowhere, don’t you? We should get a bell on you.”
“Sorry,” Cas mumbles quickly, withdrawing his hand and busying himself with trying to find a salad bowl.
They stand there awkwardly, and Dean’s heart is picking up the pace with every passing second as he tries to push past the sea of self-doubts he’s got about how tonight went. He usually never has to deal with this, he’s cool and confident before asking people out, but something’s different with Cas. Dean wants to impress him, to make sure that he hadn’t just misread the past few hours. In an attempt to convince himself that he’s not making this shit up, he reminds himself of everything that happened tonight, of the smiles and hand-holding--okay, not
He focuses on Dean again, and busies himself with studying his profile, his strong jaw, the stubble he hasn’t had a chance to shave yet--Christ, does Dean shave? Is he afraid he’ll accidentally slit his throat? Castiel would be afraid that he’d accidentally slit his throat--the way his running clothes hang loosely off of his toned, skinny limbs.
Dean had originally cooked up an elaborate story about a treasure to pitch him, full of curses, witchcraft, and family heirlooms, something to whet Novak’s appetite for adventure (everyone has one, even the brooding, silent types, right?) and get him invested. He’d been proud of the thing, too—good pace, a plot, and most important, believable as hell.
Dean tilts his head slightly, a bemused little smirk on his lips, before glancing at Cas. “That so? I’d never have guessed.”
He’s staring at a photo of him and Dean, sitting on a bench in the park. Their backs are to the camera, which just makes the whole thing even creepier, and their heads are turned just enough to make them identifiable from the faint glow of a nearby streetlamp mixed with the moonlight.
“No,” Cas says, shaking his head. “I like it.” He gives Dean another smile, this one just as small but shining with a bit more confidence that makes warmth flare up in Dean’s chest. “Thank you, Dean.”
While Michael’s family had been prim and proper, full of freshly pressed shirts and polite conversation, Dean’s is raucous, loud and messy and blunt. They laugh and pound tables and yell and greet each other like long-lost friends.
A quick sweep across the next cell doesn’t reveal much, but just as Dean’s about to move on, the beam catches a flash of brilliant blue eyes gazing blankly out into the main corridor from the bottom bunk, and Dean’s heart seizes in his chest.
“All right, all right, all right,” Dean says, leaning hard into the comfortable buzz he’s feeling as he drops back down onto the couch with a fresh beer in hand. He grabs for the remote and is about to hit PLAY when Benny stops him, covering the remote with his hand while keeping his eyes glued to his phone.
Dean nods. “On the wall near the gift shop. Corporate likes to put ‘em up to show what a great time y’all are having, but it’s really more of a wall of shame than anything else.”
“Excuse me,” an impatient mother says, waving a comic book in front of Dean’s face. He starts, her voice jerking him back to reality, and shakes his head.
The three of them white-knuckle it all the way to Eudora, and while it’s the longest trip Dean’s ever been on, the sight of civilization is almost worth it all. Garth pulls into a parking spot right in front of Eudora County Bank, and Dean releases a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
So instead of throwing his own art up, he’d kept the walls blank and the cans ready and waiting for his students. Give ‘em something to enjoy on their first few days back, and that’s how room 617 became a place for them to have a break. A place where seniors looking to fill an elective or two have just as much attention and room to breathe as kids with prestigious art schools in their futures.
"Water stop coming up," Cas says, craning his neck to better estimate how close they are to the volunteers lining the street in their bright orange jackets, cheering and offering small Dixie cups half-full of water. "You good?"
“So, I’ve got a jock for a roommate, huh?” he asks, jumping backwards back onto his bed and nodding toward Cas’ gear.
He rests his hands on Cas’ hips and tries to hide the way his spine goes straighter as he feels Cas’ thumb brush along the back of his neck, gently tugging him closer to deepen the kiss. For a split second, he’s mad at himself for not doing this—inadvertently professing his crush thanks to an edit of a reality star screaming at a cat—sooner, but everything about this just feels so goddamn
“No,” Cas says the second they’ve all entered their Google Hangout. Hannah had sent out a group message earlier in the day with the idea that they should do a minisode devoted to Cas and Dean’s date, and Cas couldn’t put the kibosh on it fast enough.
. My sister owns the bakery with me, but I usually just do the baking while she does everything else. She said I needed to practice being the ‘face’ of the bakery, because apparently my ‘people skills’ are ‘rusty,’“ he says, making air quotes as he speaks.
Cas flushes, still trying to hide the way he beams at Dean calling him his boyfriend, but protests, “I thought we agreed—”
the class where the memes were assigned, and that wasn’t enough to knock something loose in his thick skull.
“So what’ve we got here?” she asks, clapping her hands and rubbing them together. “Dads? Friends? Brothers? A whole gaggle of boyfriends?”
Cas nods. “He’s very attractive,” he says without thinking, then immediately wants to scoop all the words up and shove them back into his mouth. What if Anna left Dean for Aaron? What if she cheated on him with Aaron?
Moving fast, Dean turns his back to Cas and holds the phone up high, angling it to get both of them as well as a handful of umbrellas in the frame. Confused, Cas watches as Dean turns the phone back around so he can look at the picture, then glances up at him.
One of his favorite parts of the night comes in the form of watching Dean focus on the pitcher, his fingers tented over his mouth as he studies everything about him--how often he uses the rosin bag, how many times he taps his cleats against the rubber, his windup and delivery, everything.
“Uh, yeah, he’s inside.” Sam suddenly won’t meet Castiel’s eye, rubs the back of his neck with his hand. “There’s just one issue I’ve gotta run by you first.”
Dean smiles, that stupid crooked shit-eating grin that helped make him famous, and all Cas can think is that it looks even better up close.
Cas picks up the pace, grinning at the anticipation and excitement on Dean’s face. Dean can tell that Cas is still focusing on him, though, and snaps his fingers. “Hey, I’m not the main attraction here--”
