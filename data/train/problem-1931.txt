The cold air always seems to make me feel calm, or is it because I think I'll see John? I toss the thought aside and head out. I begin to walk up and down the streets with no purpose, just to think.
Sherlock stayed there for a long time wondering what he had done wrong. Had he said something wrong or hurt Hamish’s feelings? Sherlock thought they had a strong and loving bond that would last a lifetime. He walked home, staring at the ground, remembering the feeling of Hamish’s fur and the way it smelled. The scent of spice and greenery is just a distant memory now.
Sherlock secured him and hurried out. He took the back routes made for the employees and snuck the camel out. Once they were out of the zoo, Sherlock climbed on Hamish's back and began to ride the beautiful creature. Hamish ran, clearly enjoying the wind though his fur. Sherlock ran his fingers through Hamish's fur; it was soft, short, and felt good through his fingers. He leaned over and smelled the short fur. It smelled of cumin and freshly cut grass. Hamish ran and ran, never stopping for a second. He ran past George Street, Crawford Street, and then Baker Street. Sherlock thought about stopping him, but he knew if he stopped, they would be separated and would never be together. John would make Sherlock return Hamish, and he would be sent back to the desert. Sherlock could not let that happen.
I keep running until I trip on the uneven path. I see the scrape on my hands but feel nothing. I get up, and I am at Tower Bridge. I look down at thames river; it water is icy black. That's how I feel inside. This has to be a dream. I have to wake up. I try pinching myself and opening and closing my eyes.
For the past two years, our bond has grown stronger and stronger with each day, each fight, each laugh, each look, and each touch. Nothing could ever replace what we had. People have alway looked at us and said, "Is he your partner?"
At first I shake my head. I can’t find any words. But then I remember the look in his eye, the way everything fell apart and the person responsible.
I barely hear his words. Why do I suddenly feel so cold? The words play through my head again: "As I sing in the sand and watch you slip through my hands."
Why did those have to be his last words to me? Why didn’t I go after him? I look over to my laptop. I haven’t updated my blog since Sherlock died, and I have a feeling I never will again. Without Sherlock, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to. I would never have another adventure again, not with him gone forever.
He grabs my shoulders and lifts me from the couch. I look straight into his eye, and turn away. I can't bear to hear his next words. John grabs my chin and turns my head to him so he can look at me.
It was four in the morning. Where was he? Should I go look for him? No, he’ll find his way back; he always does. Should I call again? No, he won't answer. Where could he be? I decide to freshen up to go look for him. By the time I'm done, there's a knock on the door. Who would visit someone at this hour? When I look through the peep hole, it's Lestrade.
I had been thinking of what I wanted to say to him all day. Nothing had come to mind until now. I lean over the casket to say my last words to him.
The drive to Sherlock is quiet. I try to ask where we’re going but Lestrade doesn’t respond. I give up after my third attempt. Why won’t he tell me? Did Sherlock get in trouble? Do I have to bail him out again? Oh, God, what has he done now?
"Then what the hell was it, John? Because it looked as if you were going to second base with that slut at the park!" I don't recognize the voice that said those words but I know they're mine.
When he was in arm’s reach of Greg, Sherlock grabbed his shoulder and said, "Good morning! I'm Anderson, the manager’s new assistant!"
No matter how hard I try, it won't go away. Maybe I should go inside a shop. I go inside the first door I see. It's a music shop. I see the guitars that hang from the walls and a few children who try to play. The music distracts me. I continue to explore. In the back is a piano. It looks beautiful. A man is sitting on the bench with a music sheet. I try to guess what he's playing. Mozart? Beethoven? Bach? I don't recognize it.
“Lestrade, if you needed help, you should have just told me instead of lying and telling me you knew where Sherlock…” My voice trails off.
They don’t know what I did. I haven’t told anyone what I did. that I’m the cause of this. How could Sherlock ever forgive me?
I thought of John. If I don't tell him, he will slip away, but what if he doesn't feel the same way? I have to try. I leave the shop and begin to look for John. Where is he? I text him. No response. I call him. No answer.
The man begins to sing. "I'm jealous of the rain that falls upon your skin. It's closer than my hands have been."
He had planned for them to go to a more closed off area where no one would notice them disappear. As they walked through the zoo, Sherlock offered Greg one of the cups of tea he ‘brought for Molly.’
As he searched for for one, he wondered to himself why he had been forgetting all these factors. He never messed up; he was Sherlock Holmes. So why now? Was his passion to save this beautiful, majestic creature blinding him of logic? He couldn't let that happen anymore. He had to keep his mind clear.
Hamish had wondered who the strange man on his back was. He had noticed him by the enclosure for the past couple of days. This morning he had simply gone to get his morning drink before gazing at his favorite tree, but there was a man there with some rope. The man took him for a walk and eventually out of the zoo. He hadn't questioned it; he had always wanted to see the world. Later, he the man stopped him. He began to introduce himself as Sherlock. He looked lovingly into Hamish's eyed and gazed for a few moments before he began to recite a poem for Hamish.
The hideous, decrepit old man who had replaced my handsome, vigorous young friend, twitched and writhed and then said, in a hoarse, muffled voice, “I know nothing about any man. No one has been in here all day until that young gentleman broke in and disturbed my rest.”
I awoke three days later, thick-headed and nauseated, with the worst headache of my life and the sensation of warm lips pressing against mine. Holmes knelt over me, looking emaciated and wild-eyed, repeating my name like a chant or a prayer. When I croaked out his name, he closed his eyes for a moment and I saw that his pale face was more pallid than ever. I felt so dizzy and sick that it took me several moments to realise that I was not in my bed at Baker Street, but lying on a hard surface in a strange room. To my horror, when I managed to turn my swimming head, I saw that I was lying on the floor beside an open coffin. The churning feeling of sickness in my stomach intensified and I struggled to sit up, closing my eyes in fruitless denial when I realised that the body of a lady lay within the polished wooden casket.
He gave a noncommittal hum that indicated he was awake. It was not an encouraging sound but, against my better judgement, I found myself unable to keep silent.
He was standing at my back, not close enough to read Percy’s letter but close enough to see what I held in my hands. His voice was clipped but not cold and I scanned his face carefully. As usual, not a trace of his thoughts was visible.
“I have no doubt of the veracity of your deductions,” I said, exasperated. “I think you'll agree that I have already expended no small energy in performing certain actions that confirm beyond a doubt that they are correct. What I wish to understand is why, having deduced my interest, you did not act upon it sooner.”
Only when we had almost reached our destination did he inform me that I was not to confront Miss Adler with him but to wait outside as he sprung his trap. Standing outside the sitting room window, holding the plumber’s smoke-rocket he had handed me and waiting for his signal, I watched as Holmes, bleeding slightly from a blow sustained in the brawl I suspected him to have orchestrated, lay back on the sofa, and Miss Adler – now Mrs Norton – tended graciously to him.
“I am afraid that you have been a comprehensive fool, my dear chap,” he said, when at last he pulled away. “But I forgive you. So have I.”
“I work mostly from home,” he said – an answer that hardly left me any the wiser. “My clients may sometimes visit me at our lodgings and I trust that it will not inconvenience you to let me alone with them for some few hours now and then. I perceive that you are currently without a practice. Do you plan to return to work in the near future?”
It was the insistent stirring of a certain portion of my anatomy that finally awoke Holmes. As I replayed our interlude in my mind, struggling to reconcile the passionate man in whose bed I had passed the night with the detached, machine-like consulting detective I had come to know over the preceding months, my physical response put an end to my attempt to remain still. The most intimate part of me began nudging insistently against the underside of his arm, leaving me with a horrible desire to laugh. I was not sure which means of awakening my friend would be more mortifying. As I attempted to ease myself into a safer position, I felt Holmes’ embrace tighten momentarily around my waist and then he released me and I heard him stirring behind me. To my shame, I found that I could not bring myself to turn and face him. I had no idea who this Holmes was and no way of knowing how he might expect me to behave around him. That the bitter fight of the previous night had fuelled our passion was beyond doubt and I had no idea whether he would awaken amorous or angry. Throughout all the hours of our ardent explorations, we had not exchanged more than a few words.
When I finally stopped shaking, several seconds passed in silence. Holmes left his hand clamped over my mouth, continuing to subdue me as I struggled to regain some semblance of control. When at last he withdrew it, I murmured an apology.
I yelped as the sharp corner of a chair dug into my hip bone, just as the match went out, plunging us back into utter, terrifying darkness.
“And I’d spend every moment of my life with her wishing that I was instead with Sherlock Holmes,” I said gently. “My dear fellow, I do not want that life. I do not want any other life than the one I have with you. The Watson in my stories is a poorer man than I in every respect, because he does not know the Holmes that I know.”
“Do not try to lay the blame for your own cold-hearted dismissal of me at someone else's door, Holmes. You wish me to leave because I have shown myself to be a liability. Had I died in that coffin –”
At that I had to turn my face away and Holmes, usually sensitive to my mood, stood up and went to file away the offending magazine among his papers.
“There is nothing wrong with Percy, Holmes. He is simply possessed of natural human emotions. To have feelings may seem to you a womanly trait, but I can assure you that it is one that many people find admirable in a man.”
I had not realised until that night how insidiously the hope had grown, as we spent our days and nights together, that Holmes might on some level feel as I did. But on that score, I could fool myself no longer. Inside, I excused myself almost immediately and retired to my room, where I lay awake, cursing my idiocy and my weakness. Once again, I considered the possibility that to marry Miss Morstan might save both Holmes and myself inevitable pain. But when, feverish with frustrated wanting, I finally took myself in hand, it was not to images of soft blond hair and brave blue eyes that I found my release, but to thoughts of a savage grey gaze, of rough, scarred hands twisting in my hair and of teeth biting down on the back of my neck as a taut, lean body took its pleasure above me.
As soon as the door of the cell closed behind me, I ran to Holmes’ side. His breathing was shallow but steady and his body was radiating warmth beneath his clothes when I took one thin shoulder in my hand and shook him gently.
“If you wish to send me a bill for your services, you know where to find me,” I said, hating myself, hating him.
It was not long after the return of my fever and our pattern of easy camaraderie, punctuated by unspoken interludes of passion, remained the state of affairs between myself and my friend when he received a most august client one bitterly cold February night. To have had the King of Bohemia standing in our humble sitting room was an occurrence that ought to have made the most striking impression on me, but I confess that I soon forgot all about our client, so thoroughly was he eclipsed by the woman who had outsmarted him. It was I who looked up Miss Irene Adler in Holmes eccentric but extensive index, a self-compiled encyclopaedia of clippings spanning a dizzying array of people, places and obscure events. She was a retired opera singer, a husky-voiced contralto, to be precise, who shared with Holmes a passion for the great German composers. The King had unwisely furnished her with photographic evidence of an affair, and now wished to retrieve it. Holmes was matter-of-fact as he advised his royal client to comply with her demands, whatever they might be, and I could see that he was not excited by the case, which presented none of the bewildering eccentricities or seemingly unfathomable mysteries for which he searched so assiduously.
A noise caught John’s attention and he froze. He listened closely and it came again. A note from a violin. John’s heart thudded painfully in his chest. Could it be? Is it really true? He scrambled to get out of his bed, throwing the comforter off with the motion and nearly tripping and falling when sudden dizziness overtook him for a moment. He tried to push it aside, knowing it was a side-effect like Destiny mentioned, but he had to see
“If you could change what happened, would you?” The woman’s voice was suddenly serious. So serious from how she previously sounded that John turned to her in question, the door to 221B opened just a crack.
While John was pondering this strange thought and this strange woman, she had spoken, “You two were close, right?”
John’s eyes landed on the violin case that poked out from underneath the bed. He pulled it out, placing it on his lap, and opened it. Sitting in the case was a familiar violin and its bow. John let his hand slide against the cool, wooden instrument. He gently plucked one of the strings, making a sound in the quietness of the room. His heart lurched as he set the instrument aside.
Thank you for reading and feel free to tell me what you think about the story so far in the comments! Kudos are welcomed! Enjoy the rest of your day/night.
“How did you get in here?” He questioned, surprising himself. He hadn’t even heard the door downstairs unlock nor open.
“I’m sending you back seven months before Sherlock’s death.” John felt Destiny grab his right arm and lift his sleeve a little. He felt her clasp something around his wrist. “I am giving you a watch with a timer on it so you can keep track of how much time is left.”
John knew what she wanted him to say. He’d never said it to anyone else besides the walls of his bedroom. She wanted him to admit how much he missed Sherlock and John didn’t know if he could do it. John shifted in his seat, his jaw clenching. “I tell him…” John paused as his voice cracked. He cleared his throat and the words escaped him just barely above a whisper, “how much I miss him.”
“You have questions.” She stated and it reminded him of the way Sherlock had said that to him on the way to his very first case with him.
“Sorry, you might feel a little discombobulated.” Destiny spoke in the quiet space of the flat, “It shouldn’t last long.”
“Last night I did not know you were here!” I cried. “You saw me. When the fever takes me, I lose control of my mind, as well as my body. And it is not just the fever. Every night I dream – the most debilitating nightmares. I am haunted by the war. I cannot put it behind me, though it has been months. I never wished you to see me this way.”
Sherlock runs through twenty three possible explanations for his own illogical reaction and checks his mind palace for anything relevant that he might have indexed on sex and sentiment and John. None of it clarifies anything. By the time Sherlock decides that it can’t hurt to allow himself two to four hours of sleep before he begins the search for a new case, he is no closer to solving the puzzle. He needs more data. Easy enough. He’ll just make John say it again.
“No doubt the man who wrote it has an enviable imagination,” I responded, “but you can hardly credit his assertion that he is able to read minds and uncover secrets with the power of his eyes alone. His theories are all very well, but I should like to see him put them into action.”
“You managed to keep up the charade that you were sleeping for fifteen minutes,” he said, and I could hear in his tone that he was suppressing an urge to laugh. “I had expected you to give the game away much sooner.”
He hushed me quickly, pulling himself up to brace himself above me, propped on his forearms, where he could speak directly into my ear.
“I do seem to be experiencing some alarmingly criminal urges at the moment,” he said. “It would help me greatly to indulge them if you would turn to face me.”
That earned him a swift, sharp bite on the side of his neck and he let out a soft gasp. I smiled against his throat, breathing in the scent of his skin.
“I felt that the imminent threat of your asphyxiation was more pressing than the need for a screwdriver,” he said cuttingly. “Though granted matters did move rather faster once we found one.”
“Two identical fermions cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state within the same quantum system.”
This performance, too, I found curiously attractive, though doubtless it was childish. Holmes at work was a man entirely in control of his surroundings and his audience, more powerful and alive than I had ever seen him, and I realised at once that I should have to guard my heart more firmly than ever, were I to accompany him on any more of his cases. I had always been attracted to men and women of unusual intelligence. I enjoyed the sort of verbal sparring at which Holmes excelled almost more than I did the softer interactions that came with acknowledged mutual attraction. Seeing Holmes at work, so carelessly at ease in his skin and so naturally in control of his domain, I was reminded of the one man I had loved with my whole heart, before the war had drawn me into a hell outside any he would ever experience or understand. Henry had loved me too, so I believed. He had, at least, loved the man I had been. But when I had returned, a pallid ghost, I had seen the horror in his eyes. We had met at a particular kind of gentleman's club known for its discretion where we had often met before I had left England. I had spend days in a fever of anticipation, recalling the blue of his eyes, the strength of his neck and the sound of his laugh. Our reunion, it had seemed to me, might go some way to alleviating the hollowness and despair I had felt in the early weeks of my recovery. After that first appalled look, Henry had pressed my hand and asked after my health and smiled with his lips but not with his eyes. We had made stilted conversation over a single drink and when I had taken my leave, unable to bear the way he seemed unconsciously to draw back whenever I leaned towards him, he had not pressed me to stay. I had not heard from him since. I had vowed, after that, never to love anyone in that way again. Standing there in that macabre room, beside that disfigured body and two men who would have had me up on charges had they known even a fraction of what I had felt for Henry - and what I now feared I might grow to feel for Holmes - I made a silent promise to myself that, no matter how I came to admire Holmes, mind, body and soul, I would never allow myself to love him.
He took his leave of us soon afterwards and at last we were alone. Holmes, who I knew had been awake all night scaling fences, crawling around in flower beds and brawling with armed villains, looked as exasperatingly handsome as ever as he sprawled in his customary armchair with his long legs splayed across the rug.
John is gratifyingly – though irrationally – furious. After all, he sleeps in Sherlock’s bed most of the time now anyway and Sherlock really does need to measure the size of the stain, a man’s alibi depends on it. But John doesn’t say the words again. He just shouts at Sherlock, his face red and his left hand clenching and unclenching at his side. He rants about boundaries and respect and biohazards and Sherlock’s bloody disgusting experiments and then slams out of the flat. He doesn’t take his phone so he’s gone to the park or to the pub, not to seek out Bill or Mike or Lestrade. Won’t be gone long, then. Sherlock lies down on the sofa to recalculate. He’s missing something. It annoys him more than it should that he doesn’t know what it is.
Holmes was standing by the fireplace, still in his frock coat and hat. He was staring at me as if I were a stranger.
“The gardener has the day off,” he said, stepping gracefully out of his trousers and undergarments in a single elegant move to stand before me naked and aroused. His pale skin was flawless, bathed in warm green light, his member flushed a dusky pink and already leaking in anticipation. I tore my eyes away from him, determined to ignore the growing bulge in my trousers that I knew belied my objections.
John just looks at him. His ability to stay silent is one of his most irritating qualities. Sherlock knows how to use silence to his advantage but very few people know how to turn it back on him.
“In that case,” said Holmes, blinking so that his lashes brushed a caress against my cheek, “you shall meet him tomorrow.”
“You love me?” he asked. He sounded more tentative than I had ever heard him and there was an unfamiliar expression on his face. I thought for a moment that it was dismay. It took me a few seconds to realise that it was vulnerability and to comprehend that I had shocked him more profoundly than ever before. It was only then that I understood that despite the depth of his perception, which seemed to me at times to border on omniscience, he really had not known.
He finally turned to look at me, his grey gaze very gentle. I looked away at once, knowing I had not been quick enough to hide the moisture that had risen in my eyes at his words. Then he was moving towards me and I was in his arms. Holmes tucked my head into the curve of his shoulder and tightened his arms around me and we lay quietly together. I could hear his heart beating slow and steady beneath the soft fabric of his nightgown.
John starts shaking atop him and it takes Sherlock a moment to realise he’s laughing softly. Sherlock huffs and stills his fingers.
I laughed aloud and smoothed my cheek over his, feeling the catch of the first rough growth overlaying his warm skin.
It was not Holmes’ naked body that held me captive, however, but his eyes. I had admired them in many moods and in many lights, but never at such close quarters. Last night, I recalled, they had been almost black, liquid and compelling and burning with anger. In this stolen moment of calm, they were clear and bright and uniquely unguarded. My habit of cataloguing every stolen detail of Holmes’ actions and appearance awoke within me and I began swiftly to record their myriad shades – the cool lustre of water under a winter sky, the bewitching sheen of quicksilver, the raw gleam of steel. I was lost in trying to think of the right word to describe a shade of grey that was almost green – perhaps the muted velvet of a sage plant or the matte shine of an olive leaf – when Holmes began to laugh.
My heart was beating treacherously fast in the darkness and my heightened emotions seemed to amplify every tiny aspect of Holmes' touch as he reached around me and began to undo the fastening of my trousers with one hand. The other slid through the short sensitive hairs at the nape of my neck and then wrapped itself gently around my throat, just as he reached inside my trousers and grasped the swollen evidence of my arousal firmly in his fist. Holmes' careful, implacable grip on my throat did not restrict my breathing – at least not much – but I knew the strength of those hands. To my surprise and shame, I found the delicate pressure of his fingers wrapped around my windpipe almost unbearably arousing. In his usual dictatorial manner, he silently demanded that I submit myself utterly to his control, caressing me with expert fingers as a fine layer of sweat sprang out on my brow. He hissed through his teeth as I bucked in his arms, thrusting into his fist. Then the hand with which I had been pleasuring myself was gone, leaving me aching and bereft in the dark. Holmes retained his careful grip on my throat as I felt him fumbling behind me and then something wet and smooth and cold was probing the most intimate part of me. I felt a throbbing burst of excitement as I realised it was the rounded metal handle of his hunting crop. I gasped and swore as he eased the tip of the implement inside me, feeling him smile against my cheek as he did so. Only once he had reduced me to a state of boneless incoherence did he remove the crop and replace it with one of his long, clever fingers. I fought to remain still and silent as he brought my arousal to a fever pitch. By the time he withdrew his finger and placed the tip of himself at my entrance, I was utterly lost in the feel of him, pressing my shoulders forward to increase the pressure of his hand at my throat and my hips backward as I silently begged him to take me, fighting desperately to keep my hands braced on the crate in front of me, despite the ache in my neglected member.
“Because I know you. I know you think sentiment isn’t your area, but you feel things more deeply than anyone else I know.”
I stumbled back, turning away from the window, scarcely aware of my surroundings. My instinct was to hail a cab and flee to Baker Street, leaving Holmes and Miss Adler to their games. But a moment later I heard voices at the door and saw Holmes making his way down the front path. He was no longer affecting the timid walk of the clergyman but striding with all his customary confidence, his long legs eating up the ground. I heard the front door close behind him and ran to catch up, careful to remain out of sight of the window.
“What on earth is the trouble?” I said. Without meaning to, I had lowered my own voice to match his.
“I encountered the woman,” he responded, turning away from me and beginning to make up his pipe. “She is quite the most fascinating creature I have ever seen.”
It was a warm morning in late spring when events were set in motion that almost put an end to my association with Holmes forever. I was feeling particularly drained after undertaking several shifts at the practice of an old friend from Bart’s who had taken his wife to the continent for a week. I had been feeling so much stronger, as the weather improved and Holmes and I continued to indulge our twin passions for solving the crimes of others and committing criminal acts of our own, that I had eventually given in to my old university friend's urging and agreed to return temporarily to practice. I was drinking much less, sometimes going several days without imbibing at all, save for a glass or two of wine with supper or a brandy with Holmes by the fire in the evenings, and I was relieved to find that I was far more capable than I had feared of responding to the manifestly simple and repetitive needs of his patients. So far removed from the horror of the battlefield was his neat little London practice that the experience had not triggered an attack of nerves of the kind I had grown to dread in those early months after my return to England. Nor had it worsened the nightmares that still occasionally plagued me, although with less frequency than before.
“I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin and nothing else,” he exclaimed, as joyful as if his experiments had uncovered the location of some lost treasure.
He chuckled wryly. “Do you truly doubt it? You know my methods. Think back on our acquaintance and see if you cannot identify five instances on which you betrayed your interest. I could name fifteen, but we will begin with the lesser challenge.”
“You truly did not know how I felt? I thought that you must. After all, you knew about the drinking and the nightmares and the fact that I wanted you from the first moment I saw you. How could you fail to see how I felt about you?”
“I’m sorry, my boy, I can’t wait,” he muttered, sending a bolt of heat through me and causing my member to twitch upwards, straining for his touch.
I watch John as his hands move from the woman's waist and begin to move lower. I can't move. I don't remember saying anything but John breaks apart from their embrace and looks in my direction.
When he arrived he walked around, carefully watching the animals’ behavior and such, but none had intrigued him as much as the camel. It seemed like a simple and meaningless creature, once used as transportation but now forgotten. There was one camel that was different than the rest; it stood off to the side, staring at the gate that kept it contained and the trees beyond it. Sherlock asked the keepers about him, and they said his name was Hamish. They said that he had been here for two years, but he still had not become accustomed to the life of a zoo animal. They had planned to send him back to the desert, but were not sure if he would survive. Sherlock stayed for hours, just watching Hamish. He would eat and drink normally, but always seemed to go back to the same spot and stare at the same place.
The next morning Sherlock came before opening and waited for Greg to arrive. He considered multiple ways to deal with him, but decided the best was just to drug him for convenience. He wasn't the first there, like Sherlock had hoped, but at least he had shown up. Sherlock came up behind Greg, going through what he had to do in his mind.
"Why are you walking away? Do you not understand the way you make me feel? The way your fur between my fingers gives me a rush? The way that your eyes make me melt on the inside? Do you not feel to the same way with me?" Hamish began to try and walk way once more, but Sherlock stepped in front of him again. There were tears in Sherlock's eyes. "Do you not love me Hamish? I gave you the one thing you wanted: freedom. Why can't you feel the connection we have? We have both been ignored and called a freak. No one respects us, but together we can feel accepted by each other."
I nod, but I know it’s a lie. The funeral is the next day. It’s the last time I will ever be able to see his face.
”We are still friends. The reason I didn't tell you is because… well… I didn't know if I wanted it.”
One day on my chase I see him in the music store. Why there? I walk in, and I can feel the calm of the place. They play music over the loud system. It has a deep tone, and a raspy voice sings, his words call to me. I feel a single tear fall down my face. I am too late. I let him slip away.  I leave. Once I get back home, I grab one of his shirts in my fists and cry until I fall asleep. I let him slip away.
I’ve always known it would never happen, John and I, but a small glimmer of hope would spark every now and then, when his hand would brush against mine. I could feel a spark pass through us, being able to read each other's moods when others couldn't, the way we could speak to each other without words, and just a small glance of his beautiful brown eyes, but it would never happen.
"Oh, good morning to you as well," Greg said, trying to get his heart rate to slow down. “I didn't know that Molly was getting an assistant.”
He stands there and won't look me in the eyes as he speaks, ”John… I know where Sherlock is; let me take you to him.”
Today marked the one year anniversary of when John and I met. Although we didn't get along at first, I had always felt a connection to him. We’ve grown close but lately have been separating. John had begun to disappear to go "out.”. He never said what he was doing or who he was going with, but I couldn't help but feel as if he weren't telling me everything. Was he seeing someone? No, impossible. He would have told me, but I couldn't help but dwell on the thought. A spark of jealousy came over me.
John got up and made tea as Sherlock got dressed. They sat in their usual spots, and John waited for Sherlock’s explanation to his distress. Sherlock began to explain how he had fallen in love with a camel, and how John got married to some girl named Mary. They laughed together at the insanity of the dream for a while; John teased, Sherlock blushed, and they had a great time.
What is he doing? Is he with someone? If so, who? Is it a girl? The question returns again. Once again, I ignore it. As I continue to walk, the question won't leave. I find myself looking for his face in the crowd as I walk. The more I think, the more I begin to think that we would never happen.
We wouldn't be the couple that walks and holds hands, that compliments each other, who feels like they were made for each other. I realize I would never have a happily every after. John would never love me the way I love him.
I can feel my happily ever after get closer and closer. I suddenly see part of John's coat from behind a tree. My heart races. I feel the words trying to force their way out. I slow down when I begin to near him and open my mouth to say the words. But John is not alone. As I get closer I watch as they begin to kiss. My world shatters.
“We’ll be together soon,” I mumble as I run for the bridge. This is how I’m forgiven. This is how he will accept me again. I’m so close; I can see the tower bridge. Sherlock jumped from sadness. I’ll jump in to prove my loyalty. I don’t think about it until I’m there. How far I will fall? How long will it take? How long would I suffer? The thought scares me, but I don’t think, I do. I hurry over to the ledge and look at its icy water. Somehow, I know this is what Sherlock did before he jumped. I climb over before someone can stop me. I give it one last glance and smile as I feel tears fall down my face.
Phelps seemed to mull over my friend’s words for a few seconds and then he put his face in his hands. He shoulders were shaking very slightly.
I did so just as I finally wrapped my lips around his member, sinking slowly down until I had taken his entire length and he was pressed against the back of my throat. He cupped one hand around my face, feeling the working of my throat and jaw, even as the other kept a firm grip on my hair, holding me in place as I pleasured him. I had enough experience of kneeling before my friend to know exactly how to please him and I used everything I had ever learned, silently expressing my gratitude, my longing and my desire for every part of him with my hands, my lips and my tongue. When I slid one finger into my mouth along with his cock and then ran it, wet and slippery, up between his buttocks to tap gently over his fundament, he began to shudder involuntarily, thrusting deeper into my mouth. As I gently pushed inside, he let out a string of expletives, choking out words I had never heard him utter and had never suspected him of knowing. I could no longer resist my own consuming need. Reaching down, I began to stroke my aching member in time with my movements, desperate for release. When Holmes saw what I was doing, he let out a low moan and drew back, freeing himself from my mouth.
“The night before last, Joseph attempted to break into the room while he believed me to be sleeping,” he said. “Do you believe that the knife was intended only as a tool?”
Sherlock knows John is angry but he’s not entirely sure why. He doesn’t want to talk about it. He doesn’t want to explain or apologise. The case is over. All he wants is a few hours alone to go into his mind palace and analyse his small collection of John-saying-I-love-you data.
“I am afraid so,” said Holmes gently, examining his hastily wrapped bandage and so avoiding bearing witness to the moisture that had risen in Phelps’ eyes.
“That’s as may be, I can see no recourse but to take him down to the station for the time being,” he said.
I believe I was as shocked as anyone in the room when, halfway through a characteristic comment on the inefficiency of the authorities, Holmes suddenly rose to his feet and walked to the open window, where he took hold of the drooping stalk of a wilting crimson flower.
“As you know, my family is a prominent one, and I no longer have the same freedoms I did during my years at school and later, to a lesser extent, at university. I considered Joseph a dear friend and anything I may have felt beyond that I locked away deep within me. We became companions and confidants and I spoke to him often about my wish to find a wife. When he suggested that I meet his sister, I did not expect that we would forge such a powerful connection, but from the moment I met her I knew that she was extraordinary. I do not know how to explain it to you, John, except that I was fascinated by her – drawn not only to her beauty but to her intelligence and her strength. She is unlike anyone I have ever met. My admiration only grew the more I came to know her.”
Holmes eyes, when they opened, were as brilliant as ever, no longer glazed with exhaustion or the potent effects of opium.
Sherlock stops. He’s missed something. Something important. Honestly, why do none of their clients ever explain anything properly?
“When you were tuning your violin, I’m afraid I fell into a brown study and I feared that perhaps you had questioned the direction of my gaze.”
John didn't want to argue, so he didn't went too far with that subject. Still he wanted to know what the woman had told Sherlock. "What did you talked about... You know... when she went into your room?" It was better to go straight to the point when talking to the detective.
look and Lestrade looked down. Sherlock paced restlessly around the office. It had been three days since he had been checked out of the clinic, three days since he last saw John. Withdrawal was still attacking him, but he focused all his energy on the case. The most important case of all.
have a point. They had never worked together, not properly. There would come a day when they would have to be apart for real, and then Sherlock would become just a memory for him. It was the way things had to be. It was unavoidable.
By the time John joined the army as a doctor and became Captain John Watson of Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers he thought he had achieved everything he had always wanted: he was doing what he liked, which was serving as a doctor and at the same time he always lived on the edge. There wasn't a single day in Afghanistan in which he didn't feel his life at risk, when he didn't feel the cutting edge of death, following him around everywhere. And he loved that.
It was so rare to hear Holmes beg that I couldn’t resist drawing out his anticipation just a little longer. Rather than sliding my lips around his length, I lowered myself further down and took one of his testicles into my mouth, sucking lightly until he moaned. His fingers slid into my hair and tightened as I ministered to the other. Gripping my locks in both hands, he angled my head upwards so that he could see my face.
“You!” he exclaimed. “I should have known that you’d be lurking around here again, doing your master’s bidding like a trained hound. You don’t frighten me, doctor. You can tell Holmes that he had better to face me himself than to send his lackey to spy on me.”
Then it was my turn to beg for mercy as the doctors stared down at me, muttering behind their hands. I tried to remember where I was and realised that, of course, I was in Candahar. The young red-headed doctor who had sutured the grotesque wound on my shoulder was standing over me, speaking to a taller man whose face I could not see.
What I told him sometimes daily in words, relishing the freedom to utter the phrase I had choked back for so long, he told me in a thousand ways that I had no need of language to interpret. He told me every morning when he poured my coffee for me as he handed me the newspaper, open to my favourite section. He told me every time he looked at me with laughing eyes as a client sat in our sitting room open mouthed with amazement at some deduction with which he had dazzled them. He told me each time I awoke in his bed – the bed that had become ours, though no one but us could ever know it – shaking with the aftershocks of a nightmare, to find that he had silently enfolded me in his arms, and each time he quietly hummed the refrains of my favourite airs until I slipped back into sleep. He told me each time he called me “my dear fellow,” in the presence of Lestrade or Bradstreet or Gregson and I alone knew how to interpret the naked affection in his voice. He told me every time he looked at me and let me see that he felt just as I did – that he was in the presence of the most amazing man he had ever known.
John is muttering to himself behind his hands and Sherlock notes the pallor of his skin and the slump of his shoulders. He has moved out of active combat mode and into survival mode. He’s trying not to succumb to a panic attack. Sherlock is surprised by the feeling of guilt that suffuses him at the deduction. Guilt is a useless emotion and one he rarely feels. Must be another after-effect of the drug.
Mrs Hudson shrugged with a small smile. Mycroft stood up from his chair. Sherlock turned and barely said "Good night, Mycroft. Please don't disturb us."
reading his blog, his adventures were fantastic! His cases seemed a bit surreal, but I do believe they happened.”
He took Sherlock’s hand without thinking, Sherlock looked transfixed as John brought his fingertips to his lips and kissed them softly, a feather-like touch that only deepened Sherlock’s blush.
John so much. But it was for their sake. Next thing he felt was Irene's hand holding his, tenderly. He took his eyes off John, who didn't seem to realize yet that they were in the hallway, because he was too far away. She took Sherlock by his jacket collar and leaned him closer to her face.
He had seen it ever since he stared at John’s painting for the very first time, but since then his brain would drown itself trying to come out with the variables and the possibilities hidden inside John Watson’s world.
"Umm no, just a question, can I do the project by myself? It's just that I don't have anyone to work with and I think we have an uneven number of students in the class, so..."
Sherlock scolded himself internally for saying too much, but somehow he felt the need to let John know, to let John know that he hadn’t been high during their classes, that he had considered the idea two months ago, before going to an annoying gallery and finding a fascinating painting that turned his whole world around, that he was the artist behind that fascinating painting, that he was the one who kept him right, but he didn’t. He’d settle with letting John know that he wasn’t taking them anymore.
He crossed the street out of impulse, almost as soon as John opened the door to enter the coffee shop. Black, no sugar. Sherlock thought, unable to suppress the fond smile which drew into his lips, he was able to see John's profile from the window of the shop.
He craved for morphine. But he didn't want to waste his one last chance to talk to John by meeting him in hospital once again.
Was John even asking that? John would recognise Sherlock everywhere, just by looking at his scarf's colour or at the pattern his curls traced.
Clearly Sherlock's brother didn't believe in any of his words. "Well, I'll better be off." John said turning on the car.
They were both worn out, exhausted and at the same time extremely pleased. John tucked himself under the covers until he found a comfortable position. Sherlock felt uncertain of what to do now, he sat on the edge of the bed and turned to look at John, who was looking at him with a soft smile on his face.
Sherlock shook his head. "We'll fill applications, John, look everywhere. You were born to be a doctor! Look, you're even reading a book about anatomy! I've seen the way your eyes sparkle when you're helping someone else. You're a healer. In every sense of the word."
“I wanted to wake you with the scent of beans and toast, not with the clatter of china almost breaking”.
"I just, I need you to know that- that I'm sorry and that I meant it, every single thing that happened between us. I meant it."
. That combination of morning tea with the faint smell of cologne and the fruit smelled shampoo which expelled his hair and seemed to fill the environment. Yes, out of all things, Sherlock wasn't prepared to smell that delicate scent again.
, to get my brain to function! It was too difficult, too nebulous, I needed clarity, I needed action. I needed..."
How could she say to him that she exposed him and his feelings towards Sherlock? That she was direct and crude and real and went straight to the point? That Sherlock was surprised and that she was confused because the detective had actually showed a hint of emotion? How could she tell him that? She decided she definitely couldn't, so she had to come up with an excuse and do it fast. "Jeez, you are such a drama queen!" -the only thing she could come up with.
Sherlock listened to different composers whenever he painted, it depended on his mood. Whenever he felt the need to bring intensity into the shapes of the human body, he would listen to Vivaldi, but when he wanted to focus on details, he listened to Bach. Chopin was good for those moments when he went slow, slow, slow, when the body drew itself as a thing to contemplate, to stare at delicately. He could almost feel the skin under his fingertips whenever he smudged the trace of the charcoal. That was what Chopin was good for.
John turned his head a bit so he could gasp for air and Sherlock took this as an opportunity to kiss John's neck, and in that moment, John pretty much lost it and felt his legs getting weaker and weaker.
And John should have said no, he should have looked for another pair and work with that person, because he had to put a stop to Sherlock, but his excitement was bigger than his will and he nodded excitedly, moving his desk towards the greaser's. He didn't stop for a second to consider his options, he didn't think wether this was a good idea of not, he just moved and smiled widely.
“Anyway, people who work here at the fair have been receiving threats and they are scared. I was wondering if you had received any of those of know anyone who might had left them.”
When his mental counter hit four days, Sherlock refused to eat more food. He was threatened to be fed through an IV, he still refused, and then he got the IV.
"Seriously, are you angry because I'm caring about your well being?" The words stood in the air, Sherlock heard each one of them carefully, surprised.
His parents were disappointed at him. They could have expected it from Harry, they never held high expectations about her, which was incredibly sad, because not even his parents believed in her talents! How was she supposed to do so? His sister was miserable too. Clara avoided her all the time at school, and Harry tried to reach her, to talk to her, but it was pointless. She had been sober for the past few weeks, but she was certainly going to fall again. There, not even her own brother believed in her talents. Poor Harry.
John was cooking. He was standing in the kitchen and smiled as soon as he turned to look to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s upper back ached. He knew it was psychosomatic, he knew that it was an effect of the flashback, feeling as if the injuries had just been done to him, as if all of this had never happened at all and he was still in Serbia. As if he had never come back to London only to find a John that wouldn’t recognize him at all, a John that had supposedly moved on until Sherlock came back to wreck the life John had claimed back, as if they had never kissed and touched. As if it all had been an illusion from his mind palace.
"JOHN!", Sherlock shouted and the boy fell silent, taking deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.
He closed the door, confused. There was still something he couldn't understand, but he didn't even know what it was.
"Mr. Holmes. Thank you. You'll be hearing for me, I can assure you that". She leaned closer to him. John clenched his fists hard. She came closer. John clenched them harder. She kissed Sherlock in the cheek. John looked at them, fists clenched, face as red as it could be. Harry was making an "O" with her mouth. Sherlock's expression didn't change at all.
"Oh, no need to go into details right now, is there? That's so boring!" Sherlock said blowing a puff of air.
Except for the fact that John was thinking about Sherlock even though he had just told himself he wouldn’t, but it wasn’t as if he could stop his brain from thinking. It was impossible, ever since that first meeting at the gallery, Sherlock had been a constant in John’s mind.
Hawthorne nodded while checking the lines on the screen. “Good. We’re getting some activity on your brain. Did you bring any mementos?”
Sherlock couldn’t see her, Sherlock could only see John’s face, could only take John in, his posture, his body. His eyes roamed over and over, desperately trying to find something that would indicate that John would be okay, that
Sherlock examined him with his eyes, they stared at each other silently. Finally, John felt his voice returning to him and he aimed for a casual conversation. “That was four years ago, people change.”
"What the hell could be possibly taking them so long?" -John stood up from his chair, after standing still in what he felt was like an hour. Harry had been telling him things to distract him, to stop thinking about storming into Sherlock's room, to stay in the chair, but he didn't hear her, he was picturing all kinds of things in his mind, all the things Irene might be telling the detective, all the things she might be doing to him.
He was about to stand up and go to apologize when Sherlock came back carrying turpentine and the oils he’d given John days ago. “Stand up”, was all Sherlock said.
If Sherlock said it was too impressive, then maybe it was better attending his advise. Except he was mad at him, so he decided to play stubborn and leave. Sherlock sighed, stood up and followed him. "I'll be back in a moment."
. Damn, another book John loved. He looked at the greaser as he passed by, waiting for a salute or for Sherlock to say anything, but he didn't even look up. John sighed and kept walking.
Melissa nodded. “I did not choose the Battersea Power Station deliberately, Sherlock. You should have seen the map of his brain, this was one of the places which lit up the most as soon as we triggered the memories”, she looked around, “I don’t know what happened here”, she feigned innocence, “but I assume it has something to do with
Sherlock laughed. "If they only knew I had already been at your house, taken a cup of coffee and made you drive me back home because I was too drunk!"
He went downstairs and opened John's backpack. He took the chemistry notebook out and looked at John's contact info. His phone number was there. He dialed the number and took a deep breath, if Mr Watson picked up, he was screwed.
Melissa nodded, and eyed him expectantly, "Of course, Mr. Holmes. Please tell me how I can help you."
She was being carried by the police. She looked as good as always, as if time hadn’t had passed. Her eyes met Sherlock and she smiled and winked an eye at him. He couldn’t return the smile, he just stared at her. As she entered to the police car, she just said: “Good to see you again, Mr. Holmes.”
John nodded, his eyes still closed. "Yeah, I've been having them for about two weeks and they just come and go..."
"Why are you doing this, John?" Maybe Sherlock shouldn't have asked, maybe John would be mad at him again and yell at him and leave, but he really had to know.
"We will keep you monitored. The Naloxone managed to counter rest the amount of morphine in your body, meaning that it got to stop its effects, but since your body had received the morphine, is now requiring more of it. We will treat you through the withdrawal."
Sherlock held him by the shoulders and placed a kiss to the top of John's head. He felt his own eyes drifting closed, the exhaustion of the day finally dragging him. "Goodnight, John", he whispered, expecting not to get a response, because he felt John's breathing deepening.
He had to blink once. Twice. Three times. He read it again. He was imagining all of this. Of course he was. He had to go back to present, to reality, and to read what John had really texted him. John, who was okay and alive. He read it again. It didn’t change. It didn’t change.
John shook his head. He knew Sherlock would be disappointed as soon as he looked at the horrible scar on his shoulder, the scar which kept anchoring him to the past, reminding him that life couldn’t be the same, would never be the same as much as he tried.
Sorry for the angst, but it serves for plot purposes which will be clarified soon and yeah read the tags if you ever feel doubts.
“I”, he cleared his throat loudly. “I think I’ve finished”, he said, feeling anxious and nervous all of the sudden.
There were times when Sherlock stared over and over at the card from Lacuna he kept in his kitchen table. But he couldn't. He simply couldn't. Someone had to keep those memories alive somehow, and since John couldn't anymore, he had to. He couldn't even begin to consider how a life without John Watson in it could possibly be. Whatever he got from John Watson was better than not knowing John Watson at all.
He turned his chair and found John laying on the couch, deep asleep. Sherlock smiled at the sight and went to his bedroom to take a blanket and place it over John. He looked at the clock, it was 11:00 p.m. Damn it. When did time pass so fast? John couldn't drive home, not this late.
Sherlock felt weak, very much so. He estimated he had about three seconds left of consciousness to use it.
It was Tuesday and it was 7:02. But was it supposed to start on this Tuesday? Was he overthinking things? No of course he wasn't. He wasn't. He was not.
Sherlock stared for a moment, and a tiny smile drew itself in his lips. "Oh, he planned it ahead. He planned it and followed her until he found her working place, and decided to join, to befriend her and create an alibi. How appropriate. Is he still working there?"
“Think of their weight and their height, compare them to the hands, make the hands be part of something bigger.”
He had also said he wanted to be in the gallery, which was something Sherlock hadn't expected to hear. He knew that John was talented enough to deserve his place at the exhibition, actually, he was talented enough and had been haunted enough by the war that his sole experience could fill up an entire gallery.
After saying goodbye to Mrs Hudson, John went to his car and turned it on when the passenger's door opened and Sherlock got in.
Sherlock pressed pause. A card fell from the tape. It was small and white and said "Lacuna, Inc." on the back. On the front it simply stated: "
Sherlock simply stared at John, silently begging him not to take him to the hospital, because he would drive himself mad if he had to go there again.
They looked at each other without saying one more word. John looked angry, but Sherlock decided to ignore it. It was for the best. He promised Irene he wouldn't say a word. He was just keeping his promise. Sherlock sat on the chair again. John's eyes fixed on him. After a few minutes in silence, John decided to break the tension, sitting in his couch.
When that freaking bell announcing the end of lunch and therefore of classes finally rang, John stood up in a rush and grabbed his bag, barely mumbling a goodbye to a confused-looking Mike Stamford.
“-a very impersonal place”, Sherlock said excitedly. “Why choosing this place of all, then? Why killing her? Why killing her
Sherlock took his violin and started playing it, trying to give Mycroft a very clear message: he was unwelcome. After a time he realized it was pointless, so he just stood looking at the window while his brother remained silent. "Where is John by the way?"
Hands were far much more complex than people thought they were. Drawing them was not only a challenge, for the fingers should hold a certain proportion between one another both in width and height, but because palms were filled with a thousand creases that defined not only the lines in which the hand could fold, but which were also associated with certain actions and movements. Hands spoke by themselves and expressed a thousand different things, a hand could express happiness or sadness or angst, and Sherlock wasn’t still quite certain what he wanted those hands to express, because at the moment one looked almost ecstatic whereas the other looked as if it was bordering on depression.
"...Yes Sherlock! You gave us your blessing to mess with the kiddo, now don't come here pretending to be his savior!" Sebastian yelled.
So this idea popped into my mind as I watched The Manchurian Candidate, a 1962 film with Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh. The movie basically is about a man who is captured during the Corean War and whose mind is controlled in order to become an assassin.
"Don't get into trouble while I'm away. Please, no alcohol Harry. I'll be back as soon as I can" -Harry gave him a compliant smile as he stood up and gave her a kiss in the cheek.
And just as they finished their conversation, his sister was standing in the door, looking at him with a suspicious look. "What do you want, Harry?"
“If I wouldn’t have come back”, he whispered, “I wouldn’t have done all of this damage. You wouldn’t remember me and would have lived a happy life, without anything that would trigger any old memory. I wouldn’t have hurt you. Had I known, John, had I known, I would have never returned. You would eventually find someone else, have a wife and kids, build your own home, and you’d be happier. Better than this. Better than anything I could offer you.”
“Shut up!”, John said, sounding angry and barely controlling his breathing. His voice was trembling. “Don’t you dare-”
Before reaching the door, he took a deep breath and felt very nervous. He thought of something to say, but couldn't come up with anything. He opened the door. Sherlock was smoking anxiously. Sucking, sucking, sucking, that one cigarette finished incredibly fast and he pulled out another...okay John needed to talk to him right now.
Harry looked at him with wide eyes. "Fine, I really hope you do, but I'm just sayin' so you don't be forced again to work with those boys."
Lestrade exhaled loudly, clearly annoyed with Sherlock's attitude. He'd known him for too long, and it was still difficult to handle Sherlock on a tantrum. "I'll see myself out", he whispered as he walked towards the door.
"What?", John turned to look at him, his gestures softening a little when he looked at the greaser's face. He still wanted to punch him though.
"The project." Sherlock said looking down and holding the paper. But of course, he meant so much more.
“You’re- Jesus, Sherlock. You’re-”, he couldn’t find the words, Sherlock looked at him expectantly. “You’re like a symphony”, he whispered.
It had to be a mistake from the app, or the RSS feed, there was something wrong because the personal blog of John H. Watson no longer existed.
John felt as if he had just been stripped naked, and not in a pleasant way. He felt studied, observed and analyzed. He hated it.
Time is relative. Time can pass incredibly fast or incredibly slow. Sherlock had come to realise eventually that his time with John, that year and a half before the fall, had passed by incredibly
He dragged a deep breath to control his fear. Too many things were coming together at once: the distant memory of Afghanistan, the forgotten memory of a fall and Sherlock was shot. He had to be on doctor mode now, he couldn't keep on as John Watson.
Mycroft cleared his throat and decided to change the topic, "any constrictions in the lungs? sleepiness?"
He went upstairs and entered to Clara's bathroom. Harry was laying on the floor, unconscious. Damn. She was so drunk she passed out there.
There was no life. And that was a surprise, because John had expected Sherlock’s place to be as enigmatic as the artist himself was. But standing there, in the center of an empty living room which held a couple of sketches and nothing but a sofa and white walls and huge windows and too much light didn’t feel like stepping over an enigma at all.
"You can't come. At this hour father is most certainly home, do you want him to open the door to find his runaway son with a lovebite on his neck and his greaser boyfriend? not the best idea, is it?"
He came back a moment later, carrying a big box with him. He placed it in front of the desk where they kept all their supplies.
Mycroft realized this had taken his brother by surprise. “Well, it makes sense. Why would he live there after all?”
"The instructions were clear enough. I assumed I was talking to police investigators. It is not my fault that your team is so incompetent and ignorant."
Sherlock got inside the bed about half an hour later, keeping his distance as the night before. John hadn't fallen asleep yet, he was nervous, he didn't know what he was nervous about, but he was. Sherlock looked at John and flashed him a little smile. "Goodnight, John. Sleep tight."
Unconsciously, Sherlock’s hand started moving on its own as it closed over John’s cock. Up and down. Up and down.
"As you may know, he was drunk. Maybe you don't remember either, because you were even more wasted than him. I could sense it in the tone of your voice. He could barely stand still, I was angry at him, he apologized, then he fell asleep and so did I. I barely slept, his snores didn't let me."
After he took a shower and got dressed his phone pinged with a new message. John picked it up, eager to see if Sherlock had written anything, but he only found a text from Mike Stamford.
It never stopped, though. The feeling, the itch, the sensation, the need. Sherlock knew that no other chemical reaction would bring him the same feeling heroin did. And he craved for it, some times more than others, but he craved it nonetheless.
"That's not what I'm trying to say! The thing is that as you had a perfectly planned fall, Moriarty could also have a perfectly planned suicide! He is not stupid! He probably had it all worked out! You have to be careful Sherlock, because if he is back he is coming to get you, and we can't let that happen!"
Police officers went to search his flat and found a long knife, very similar to the one that had caused the mortal injuries on Alice and on the other victims, but they would need more tests to prove it. Still, it was a evidence strong enough.
Finally, he turned to look at Lestrade. "Good evening, Detective Inspector. Let me know what happens with Jones."
At some point the lights grew dimmer, the sounds were distant and John’s eyes were still looking at him, with worry, but also with a softness that Sherlock would try to describe and store in his mind palace were he not so completely focused in not collapsing at the moment.
As John went out to the street, Sherlock was already gone, he had acted so weird, he looked worried, if John wouldn't know him better, he'd say he looked
"Sherlock, dear, your brother is here! I made you breakfast!" He heard Mrs. Hudson's voice, followed by a knock on the door.
He had done so many things wrong. So many things. He had taken John for granted, had assumed he’d always be there for him, but John had made his choice and Sherlock couldn’t blame him, because had it been the other way around, he was certain he would have ended up killing himself. To think of a life without John in his life, without the hope to have John back in his life at least, was impossible. He never thought he’d be so valuable to John that John would choose to forget him rather than accept he was gone. Did John love him as much as he loved him? Before all of it? Did that mean that when John was doing that speech at his grave, he was feeling the absence not only of a dear friend, as Sherlock thought it had been, but also of a person John
." Sherlock said lowly, but loud enough for John to hear it, he turned to look at him and the greaser smiled.
He filled himself with courage and took a step forward. He moved towards the Greaser and his gang and took a deep breath, but as soon as they turned their eyes to him, he forgot what he was about to say, he felt terrified. Sherlock took a step forward. "What do you want, Watson?"
John cracked in laughter, leaning his head against the couch and looking at such an ease that it brought an almost immediate flashback to that first night in Baker Street, when they laughed and laughed, without knowing all that was waiting for them, all the demons they’d have to face in the way, all the things they’d lose, all the things they’d get back.
Sherlock flinched at John's words and it was all he could do not to walk towards him, shake him, make him see reason. He cleared his throat. "I'm Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes."
The problem was not the sentiment, the problem was that he wasn't strong enough to resist to them. He was never strong enough. He was still the same weak, helpless small kid who clung to somebody else as if his life depended on it.
He jumped. He had been far too absorbed in his thoughts. He kept his back to John as he closed his eyes and sighed.
Sherlock’s outfit was really terrible. He was wearing sweatpants and a loose t-shirt. He had to be undercover anyway. His hair had grown long and he had also grown a beard. He was almost unrecognizable.
"John!" Sherlock said looking up from the typewriter and realizing John was no longer next to him. He called louder. "John!"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, this time he did look slightly annoyed. “I said I’ve never heard of him.”
Sherlock remained expressionless. "I told you to stay in the car", he said slowly, trying not to burst in anger.
And Sherlock was exhausted. Exhausted of fighting against it. Damn it, he was given a taste of John's lips, of John's kisses. He wasn't backing down. He had already crossed that line. He knew that closing himself from feelings was only going to hurt John more. No. He had already messed up. The least he could do was to give John some explanation.
Melissa laughed and looked back at Hawthorne, her face turning serious once again. “He gave me the biggest responsibility.”
Molly smiled at him and threw a dismissive hand. "It's okay. I'm fine, by the way. How have you been?"
"Good luck with the boy." She said with a wink. Sherlock didn't look up and took an even bigger sip.
As he took a cab back home, he took his phone out and started typing a text for John, because he really needed to see him as soon as possible.
