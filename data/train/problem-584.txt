Sherlock smiled out the window, trying to think of an adequate reply, but the view had caught his tongue and robbed him of all eloquence, and he simply nodded, turning to grin at her over his shoulder.
“So you thought you’d take your chances with pneumonia?”
“How long ago was that?” John asked, just as Sherlock’s mouth opened to tell him.
He’d forgotten to tell John that story, and made a mental note to tell him when he called back. Except he didn’t call back.
again,” Sherlock grumbled bitterly, and Molly tipped her head, giving him the point. “God,” Sherlock groaned, releasing his spoon as he leaned back in his chair, pressing his fingers down from the bridge of his nose to push across his cheekbones. “I could’ve said anything else,
bag?”
There were a tense few beats of silence in which they avoided eye contact, and then Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Yeah, well,” John said softly as he turned back to the pitch, surprised at how easily something he’d never admitted before came out, “he left long before that.”
,” she muttered, her voice continuing in a stage whisper as she disappeared into the kitchen. “I knew I should’ve picked the lesbians.”
“See ya tomorrow!” she called, and Sherlock lifted his hand in a wave.
a closed crime scene.”
“Nothing,” John murmured, rattling his head, rocking a bit as he leaned further over his knees. “Go ahead.” And then he was back to trying to burn a hole through the page.
Sherlock swallowed. “Perhaps,” he muttered with a vague shrug, reaching out and snatching one of the menus, even though he had no intention to eat.
“Yes,” Harry said, consulting the menu. “Can I get a Cupid’s Arrow, a Puppy Love, and a Tried and True?”
John rounded on her, alarmed, and Mary turned a curious look at him for a moment before her eyes widened.
“Don’t you see!?” he cried, and John startled a step back. “That’s precisely the problem! You don’t care! You’d have set up some Old West showdown, and you’d have
lying to you, seeing you like that? Do you think John-”
age and stature hoisted a
“Lock up when you come in, Sherlock,” she said through the thinning crack, and then the door clicked shut, the both of them left staring at the flat expanse of black paint.
- mentioned the Yard’s Halloween party he had invited us to; caused John to glare at me again
“I-I don’t know,” Sherlock murmured, and the shape John could now fuzzily make out shrugged. “I was just…curious.”
“Sentiment is a chemical defect, Sherlock,” he had finally said, looking up, and Sherlock would never forget how tired he had looked, how bloodshot his eyes had seemed to instantly become. “A chemical defect found in the losing side. It would do you well to remember that.”
Sherlock winced as if in pain, his fingers fiddling with the cuffs of his coat as his gaze dropped to the floor, the biting comment John expected never emerging.
As if summoned by the mention, Sherlock rounded the corner, back from a trek to the cafeteria with the cardboard carrier of everyone’s beverages, a voyage he always volunteered for in order to escape practice.
“Don’t worry about it,” Dimmock interjected, waving her comment away. “My treat.”
“Oh, here we go!” she trumpeted, clapping her hands beneath her chin and bouncing in her chair, watching the first round of waiters appear carrying trays loaded with salads, and conversation waned for a moment, Sherlock ducking his head to whisper toward Mycroft’s shoulder.
What had possessed him to
“Comforting,” Sherlock quipped back, cradling the cup in his hands, and John beamed, dropping his face and returning to his work. Sherlock wavered a moment, inhaling the scent of the brew, and then, after a deep breath: “Thank you.”
Thai place.” “I did
“How…efficient,” he said, somehow making it sound like the dirtiest word in the English language, and John blinked, his face falling in confusion. Mr. Holmes quickly lifted up his façade, however, smiling hollowly as he nodded down at John. “But I think that’s probably enough studying for today. Mycroft’s going to be arriving soon, and I need Sherlock to help me with a few last-minute things for dinner.”
“I highly doubt they charge for air.”
“Interesting,” Coach Powles mused, looking out over the room. “Jordan’s gonna be out for a while,” he said simply, still looking over John’s shoulder. “I’d like you to stay on as hooker, if that’s alright?”
John had said it all the time, any time, at whatever small opportunity afforded to him in the weeks since the revelation, and Sherlock had never managed to be brave enough, never given that moment back to him. And now he never would.
John shook his head, shrugging as he swallowed.
“Pity,” Mycroft muttered, lifting a mushroom-topped crostini from the plate. “I do rather enjoy pointing out the seeds in everyone’s teeth.”
“But did you see anything?” Sherlock interjected, trying and failing to rein in the misplaced aggression. “Anything at all?”
“Alright,” Lestrade sighed, clearly shelving the matter, but not tossing it entirely. “I’ll go get it out of him and finish putting the raid together. Should be ready to roll around 7. Can you be here after? ‘Round 9? I’ll text you with the specifics as it gets closer.”
John choked on his soda, coughing violently as Sherlock froze beside him, eyes wide and blinking as his hand stalled halfway through delivering a piece of popcorn to his lips. “I’m sorry, what was that?” he teased, barely restraining his laughter as he looked inquiringly at the man, and Sherlock closed his mouth, eyes flitting between John and the screen.
“No, it’s not about him,” Sherlock interjected, pausing to take another deep breath.
“The Sherlock kind,” Lestrade muttered with a small smile.
They lapsed into silence then, notably less uncomfortable, but their time was running short, people making their way back into the school as classes drew near.
“What are you up to?” he hissed, and Molly tilted her head at him, a coy gesture in direct opposition to the shrewd glint in her eyes.
“Because we will all be studying
The second he heard John’s door close, he grabbed his mobile, phoning Lestrade to ask him to wait until morning, and the sergeant reluctantly agreed. Sherlock then didn’t know quite what to do with himself. He tried to work on an experiment, but couldn’t focus, the slides and numbers blurring as his mind drifted. He thought about making more tea, but decided against it, knowing he would only be disappointed when it wasn’t as good as John’s or Mrs. Hudson’s. In the end, he settled for playing his violin, gently removing John’s jacket and draping it over the red armchair before plucking up the instrument, standing in the window as he tuned.
“Okay, so she’s left-handed,” John interjected, laying the photo of the bathroom—fancy, free-standing tub and all—back into the fray. “Why does that make it not suicide?”
“It is one of the larger groups,” Ethan said, turning a glance around the room, “but I think they mostly use this party for recruiting. To answer your question though, no, I’m not a member. You?”
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, no uncertainty in his tone now, and Harry smiled with a clipped nod.
His bleached hair shone greasy in the shafts of light that filtered through the bleachers from the large, pitch lights. His clothes were rumpled, the tips of his dirty fingers scarred from drug use, and a rush of bile rose in Sherlock’s throat at the sight of him, at the awareness of having this creature’s skin cells on his trousers and used breath in his lungs.
“He doesn’t want to talk about it,” Sherlock explained carefully, not wanting to provoke John any further. “He knows it’s not rational. He would be embarrassed if you brought it up, not to mention offended that we were discussing him behind his back.”
“Your brother? I didn’t know you-”
(See the end of the chapter for
John lowered the apple back to his lap, watching the progress of small tremors run through Sherlock’s arms. “When was the last time you slept?” he asked quietly.
Running would have been undignified, but John would resign to calling it hastening, his steps quick as he flit through the maze of tables and shifting chairs. Once he drew up to Sherlock’s side, however, he realized he had no idea what to say, and simply hovered, mouth shifting without sound as he twisted his fingers in front of him.
A scrape. A gentle thump. Coming from his bedroom below.
John stared at him a moment, lips twitching as he slowly quirked an eyebrow.
“Course not, dear,” the woman said to his back, and Sherlock was too tired to argue, hobbling up the stairs and letting Mrs. Hudson guide him to the sofa. “There we go,” she soothed, draping the blanket over his body and tucking it around his feet. “I’ll get you some water.” She patted him twice on the shoulder before leaving for the kitchen, returning soon after with a tall glass of water that was suddenly the most beautiful thing Sherlock had ever seen. “Easy, now,” she said, combing a hand through his hair as he gulped down the first swallow. “Small sips, dear, small sips.”
Sherlock blinked down at the message, biting his lip and twiddling his thumbs over the keyboard as he considered his reply.
understood.
“John,” Sherlock admonished.
John was beaming as he ran onto the pitch, the muscles pinching in his cheeks.
As Émile bounced away after another failed attack, John feinted a jab to the left, redirecting at the last second to clip Émile’s left side as Émile tried to step out of range.
Sherlock wasn’t a joy to live with all the time, of course, John having found more than his fair share of deeply disturbing things in the fridge, but it was something else entirely to be able to see him sleeping, to know what it looked like to see a shooting star at rest, because Sherlock never stopped for anything while he was awake, leaping from one project or case to the next with no regard for his personal safety or dietary habits, but John loved him just as much then too.
“Yes, you do,” John snorted.
“Sherlock,” he said as he leaned against the mattress, crossing his legs, their knees less than a foot apart, “you are an excellent liar.”
“John!”
John barked a laugh. “Somehow I think fireworks of the four-letter variety are more likely than hearts.”
asking about it.”
“And this is for one of mine.”
“Well?” he snipped, quirking a brow. “Are you coming?”
in this context didn’t escape him, but he was almost…well, relieved. Sherlock hadn’t liked Sebastian, hadn’t liked any of them. But who was ‘any of them’? He felt sick again.
“Just since last year,” Mike shrugged, following the topic change without comment.
“I wasn’t sure how many to pull,” John explained, stepping in behind him as he closed the door. “Lestrade picked them out. Said they were the most interesting ones.”
The man greeted him with a smile, but didn’t say anything at first, the two of them at the second floor landing before the silence was broken. “So,” Sherlock mused, voice wobbling slightly as he traversed the steps, “sleep well?”
Sherlock had watched John Watson stare down drug dealers, chase armed mercenaries,
In a whirlwind of limbs, he leapt from the chair, crossing the room in two strides to pluck his mobile off the coffee table. Finding the contact he wanted out of the very short list, he swiped to dial, and then began pacing, his hand tapping impatiently against his side as he marched between the table and his chair.
“You up to anything tonight?” John asked his cup, watching the last of his tea swirl around the sides.
“How long has he been doing that?” Lestrade’s voice drifted under the door, softer than before, but not quite so quiet as to avoid meeting his ears.
John was still curious, still terribly concerned, but he was not going to press, that amazing, extraordinary, inexplicable friend Sherlock had stumbled into through the grand design of some deity he didn’t even believe in.
“I have a spare bedroom,” the blond expounded, gesturing down the hall to the unused main-level room, “and I was planning on getting a roommate anyway. We can bring more of your stuff over tomorrow, and you can just stay here until you figure something out. Or however long you like, really,” he added with a shrug, but Sherlock shook his head, lifting a palm to deflect the generosity.
,” Sherlock groaned, explaining this for the fourth time and still somehow feeling guilty about it, “this way, we can catch the thief red-handed. I suspect it’s one of the employees, someone with access to the computer system. We’re inputted as some famous someone or other”—he waved his hand in the air, dismissing the details—“who are quite publically going to be in attendance at a charity event tonight. It’s the perfect opportunity for the thief; he won’t be able to pass it up.”
out.”
Sherlock stared at him, stunned, his heart shaking his ribs as he searched his father’s face, trying to find even a ghost of the man he was, or at least the man Sherlock had thought he’d been, but the grotesque figure in front of him was a stranger now, his unfamiliar features contorting into a smug sneer. Sherlock swallowed, his lips trembling as his body shook, but his voice held firm. “That’s not true,” he said, and the man blinked, his mocking amusement faltering. “I heard her talking to you,” he continued, glancing across the foyer to the study. “I know what she said.” He narrowed his eyes, breaths hissing through his nose as fury raced through his veins, his fingernails digging deep into the sensitive skin of his palms. “If she’d hate anyone, it would be
“Until dinner.”
John blinked, a perplexed crease gradually burrowing into his forehead. “You’ve known me less than an hour,” he reminded, but Sherlock was untroubled.
“Nearly the first thing out of her mouth was asking what kind of medicine I wanted to practice.”
“Like hell you don’t!” John challenged, and Sherlock stopped halfway down the corridor, twisting back with eyes blazing.
Sherlock smiled, stepping forward, and then turned his eyes to Irene. “It was nice meeting you,” he said politely, bowing his head, and a corner of Irene’s mouth twitched in response.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows skeptically.
?” He moved across the room, craning his head to look up at the draping crystals that spanned the center of the spiral staircase. “There’s another
“No,” Sherlock answered, voice just above a whisper, and John turned back to find he had somehow soundlessly shifted, his legs now hanging off the edge of the mattress as he leaned forward, braced on his knees. “It’s not stupid at all.”
“Not unless you rolled it in frosting first,” he muttered back, and John laughed, tossing a grin over his shoulder, and it was a lucky thing he was still holding onto Sherlock’s hand, because, otherwise, Sherlock may very well have tumbled down the stairs.
“Sherlock?” John said softly, his eyes narrowing against the dim as if the boy would materialize.
How could they do this? They had been so safe, so caught up in their little bubble of the past few weeks that John had all-but-forgotten it wasn’t normal, but he could feel it now, creeping in through the cracks between the metal with voices and light that seemed to him like noxious fumes. The parts they would have to play were there, waiting just outside, and his stomach tumbled as he saw the backs of some of his teammates walking down one of the paths across the lawn. There was no way he could do this, no possible way he could ever in a million years-
“Well…goodnight,” he blurted, and John chuckled, stomach spinning as the porch light grazed over Sherlock’s pink cheekbones.
“Not really. You’re studying medicine; I’m studying chemistry. It’s only natural you would know more about rare diseases than-”
“Oh,” she said, a small, sad sound of surprise, her fingers lifting to her chest.
I hope you enjoy it, and I wish my fellow USAers a fabulous First Nations Weekend! As for everyone else, well, there's no reason you can't eat and drink until you pass out too!
John laughed, and Sherlock found the corner of his mouth lifting in automatic response. “Things that will only ever be said once,” he chuckled, shaking his head as he tossed the now-folded blanket over the arm of the sofa.
?” he asked, more to break the silence than for genuine curiosity.
“Um, I-” the man stammered, a telltale flustered expression on his face as he looked frantically over the menu, and John was just opening his mouth to tell him he could come back when Victor spoke out instead.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered stiffly, eyes blinking down at the floor as a muscle in his jaw twitched. “This morning. Anna Nichols.”
John frowned, looking up at the window to see Sherlock gaping down at him, and was just opening his mouth to ask if there was an axe murderer behind him or something when his words caught up with him, the feeling probably fairly similar to being axe-murdered though.
“Okay then,” Harry clipped, positively swaggering up to Sherlock’s opposite side, “how long have you two been
John sighed, wiping a hand across his shamed face. “Mary, I’m sorry, I-”
“I grabbed some extra bags,” John said as he reentered, ice clattering within the small, plastic bag in his hand, “but you should probably wrap it up in a towel before you-”
“So,” John said, clapping his hands together, “what brings you to the park this
“Well…alright,” John said, still soft, but a little brighter, and Sherlock’s chest swelled with satisfaction.
after that, going into a near-tirade at the horrible pattern of the not-the-father’s tie. “If he were about twenty years older, I’d forgive it, but, really, there’s just no excuse for paisley on a man that young. And in such a
“Shut up,” John grumbled, rolling his eyes to the ceiling, and Mike laughed, moving ahead to push the door open for them, the car already waiting at the curb.
Quick little update to stave off my TFP nerves. God help us all...
He’d only be getting what he deserved.
“I’m dressed.”
you right now?” he asked in a breath, and Sherlock recoiled, more a shift in the air than any movement of his body.
“Mrs. Hudson,” she introduced, extending a hand, all ten fingers wrapping around the handshake as he gripped her fragile hand in his own. “House manager. Lovely to meet you, Mr. Holmes. I couldn’t even
“Yes,” Sherlock said warily. “In a sense. He is rather fond of hyperbole.”
When his clothing finally fell loose from his ankles, he nearly wept with relief, dragging the side of his calf up John’s hip in gesture for him to get the hell back up here already, but John ignored him, remaining kneeling between Sherlock’s ankles as he delicately rolled down one of his socks, pulling it free from his toes and dropping it to the floor.
“And what were you going to do!?” John shot back, rounding on him. “Let him spell out my middle name too?”
Pedestrians turned as he passed, their eyes widening with trepidation while they shuffled further out of his way, and he might have been offended if he wasn’t sure he looked just as frightening as their expressions would suggest, his mind racing and breathing ragged as he flew down the pavement. He was putting one foot in front of the other as fast as he could without calling it a run, but he had no idea where he was going, the only things clear in his mind being the black car following behind him and the look on John’s face when he’d left, and he tried to rattle the latter loose with a brisk shake of his head. It was no good though, blue continuing to blink at him wherever he looked, and he thrust his hands into his pockets with a self-directed snarl, shoes slapping the grey pavement as he stomped on to nowhere.
“Jesus,” the boy hissed, steadying Sherlock with a hand to his back. “Do you need me to help you back? Or I can send someone. Mike or someone else you like.”
Why does it hurt, John? Why does it matter? Why are you still here?
“You know what I mean,” he hissed, drawing nearer as a group of laughing students passed them. “You looked, I dunno…off.”
“Ah, Mr. Holmes,” John said, narrowing his eyes at the tall boy standing in the doorway, “I’ve been expecting you.”
Should he move closer? Pull the gotta-stretch-whoops-now-my-arm’s-around-you bit? Hold his hand? Stop being such a coward and grow the fuck up?
Mycroft smiled, tilting his head in acknowledgement of the point. “Yes, I suppose that was not my
Sherlock peeled one eye open, blinking John’s face into focus, the man biting his lip as his hands fidgeted over his knees.
“Come on,” he beckoned softly, nodding back toward the fire as he tugged at their combined hands. “It’s cold over here.”
“So…why didn’t you say something?” John asked, utterly perplexed. “What could you possibly have been worried about?”
“The fixtures are metal.”
“Yours is open,” Sherlock shrugged, popping the crisp into his mouth and crunching pointedly down at John.
“I suppose,” he relented, the sounds slow and uncertain in his mouth. “But only for a while.”
“No,” Sherlock snapped bitterly, glowering at the corner that presumably previously housed the skeleton. “One of those horrid, hanging, model ones. For some reason, Mr. Hooper won’t let me take any of the real ones.”
Tonight was the first rugby match of the season, a home game against Leamington College, and though John had no idea if they were any good, he was nervous all the same. Most of his anxiety probably came from the fact that he had no idea what position he would be playing, Coach Powles moving him around quite often through the last week’s practices. He seemed to favor second-row forward, but John had been asked to play hooker—something Sherlock chuckled juvenilely about every time John mentioned it—more times than he was comfortable with, not feeling prepared to take on such an important position on a team of people he barely knew. His teammates had given him no reason to feel self-conscious, mind you. They had been nothing but encouraging, bestowing numerous slaps to his back after a particularly well-formed play, but John would still rather play second-row forward with Mike. Not that he would be given much of a choice in the matter.
Mycroft was glaring at Mrs. Hudson, who only shrugged, placing a bowl of butter on the table in front of them.
“So, you just…drank it?” Sherlock questioned, head waving in bemusement. “Without knowing what it was?”
that!?”
It was always nice to see parents being what they should.
Sherlock glanced around the flat, mouth hovering open. “I might be…
Lestrade smiled, shaking his head as he closed the door behind him, and Sherlock’s lips quirked up at the device in his hand.
He watched after him until he rounded the corner, and then looked back down to the closed book in his lap, tapping anxiously at the cover. “So,” he chirped, clearing his throat, “where were-” He looked up, words breaking off as he found Mary and Molly giving him matching looks of tired condescension, made all the worse by the identical uniforms they had yet to take off. “What?” he muttered, gaze shifting warily between them as he tugged at the knot of his tie, and they rolled their eyes as if they’d choreographed it.
“How do you mean?” he asked, head tilting as his brow furrowed.
“So, with the optical isomers,” he questioned, pointing to a picture in his book, “they’re mirror images, but not identical?”
“Duchess Mayer?” he echoed, brow furrowing. “I don’t have a file on her.”
“You didn’t have to come.”
“How should I know?” she huffed, the image of her tossing her hands up in exasperation crystalline in Sherlock’s mind. “He wouldn’t tell me. Just wanted an audience for all his
“You could’ve told me,” she said softly, looking up through her dark lashes, but Sherlock looked at her fingers, lifting his hand to slide the cigarette out from beneath the delicate digits.
“Mrs. Hudson took it to the dry cleaner on Thursday,” he interjected, knowing John would be looking for his slate grey jumper, a cold-weather date favorite women often—and Sherlock never—said brought out his eyes.
“Great,” Sherlock grumbled, stomach wriggling anew, and Mycroft cast down a sidelong smile, deftly swiping a full champagne from a passing tray.
“I think you can take it from here,” Sherlock said, tugging his coat closed around him with a flick as he turned away.
Her anger over not being notified immediately only lasted seconds, however, and then she was fending off tears, fussing over them as she ushered them upstairs and made them both sit down on the sofa, arranging their blankets around their shoulders before bustling into their kitchen to make tea.
“I dunno,” he replied mockingly, heel kicking out across the asphalt as he stepped closer. “Because we never did. Because I want to.”
“Well, alright, then,” she said softly, and Sherlock barely had time to look up at her before there was a tug on his arm, a squeak of surprise issuing from his throat as he struggled to maintain his balance.
“You need a warmer one.”
“Yes, you did,” John countered, the two of them stopping entirely now, turning toward one another just shy of the entrance into the common room. “I was talking to Mycroft, and you came and said-” He stopped, frowning suspiciously as he watched Sherlock.
Sherlock blinked, the spark in his eyes collapsing as they pinched with something John would almost call pain, and then his face shuttered completely, an unrecognizable mask settling over it as he dropped his gaze away to the table.
“Well, gentlemen,” he said, sweeping his hands over his friends, “Mr. Holmes has expressed an interest in deepening his understanding of my character-”
“Of course my mother knows. She’s my mother, after all.”
!” Sherlock bleated, and John laughed, adjusting the cuff of his shirt.
Sherlock stilled, his eyes growing unfocused.
“He’s not coming back,” Sherlock said, startling him slightly as he slowly lifted his chin. “In case that wasn’t clear,” he added, lips quirking in a frail smile, an effort John weakly returned. The man sighed, pushing at the bottom of his water glass as he slid it side-to-side in small motions. “You know, all in all,” he said suddenly, looking thoughtfully out ahead of him, “this evening could have gone a lot worse.”
John laughed, shaking his head as he tied the rubbish bag off. “I’ll be right back,” he said, looking over to catch Sherlock’s nod before hoisting the bag up by the plastic handles and pushing through the swinging door to the back room.
“Well, that’s simple,” Sherlock scoffed with a wave of his hand. “Don’t cross the Atlantic before summer.”
“Not much,” she admitted, shrugging as she walked across the carpet. “Just what Moran said when he was back in here the other day. Sherlock, you have to-”
“Sergeant,” John replied, mirroring the gesture.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Sherlock muttered, exiting out of the message and looking up to see John rolling his eyes, clearly unconvinced. “There’s been an interesting development,” he began, and John seemed to temporarily forgive the obvious lie about invading his privacy in favor of satisfying his curiosity. “Ethan wants to make a deal. Apparently he has received some very useful information from the dealers he’s killed; a last ditch effort for him to spare their lives, I imagine. Lestrade wants to get a team together for a raid tonight, but Ethan refuses to confess to anything involving the murders until the deal is finalized.”
“I dunno,” he murmured, and then his expression fell, mouth curving down as he blinked, a thoughtful wrinkle forming between his brows. “Probably be better off,” he said, looking up at John with a glass smile, and John frowned, puzzled.
John Watson—calm, kind, unassuming John Watson—could shoot, but shoot seemed too weak a word for it. He could fire a gun with the kind of calm precision that’s innate, born, unable to be achieved through any amount of acclimation or training, his blue eyes dilating as he zeroed in on his target, sending the faint smell of disintegrating gunpowder into the air when his tanned fingers compressed the trigger and holy hell it was driving Sherlock mad!
“Without a doubt?”
Molly nodded. “Like, if we were on a date-”
“Oh,” Ethan said, trying to salvage the conversation in spite of the tension thrumming between two of its members, “well, that’s-”
John blinked, and then his face split around a dazzling smile. The expression faded though, turning puzzled as his focus shifted to something around Sherlock’s arm. “Is that- Is that St. Edward’s Crown…made out of Legos?”
“You have to bend it,” John had advised, smiling gently up through his lashes. “Otherwise it’ll fall off.”
“And appreciate it,” John amended, flicking a finger at him. “And, you know,” he added, shrugging as his eyes darted nervously between Sherlock’s face and the table, “you had to be cute. Otherwise, it wouldn’t’ve made sense.”
, you must be Sherlock’s roommate!” she said somewhat breathlessly, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “He was compla-” –a sharp cough burst at John’s back- “saying he would have one this year,” she amended quickly, smiling shyly as she shifted her weight.
“I dunno,” John chuckled awkwardly, scratching at the back of his neck, “I guess… I keep thinking it’s a mistake.” He shrugged, twisting his hands together as his throat shifted with a swallow. “That they’ll send me another letter and take it all back.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, but John didn’t blink, long seconds of staring passing before Sherlock gave in with a huff. “Take my peacoat.” He bobbed his head down the hall toward his room, John glancing at the door before looking back with a frown. “It doesn’t fit me,” he explained with a shrug. “Too short in the sleeves.”
“So strong,” she teased, flicking at the collar of his shirt, somehow a harmless gesture when dealing with Irene Adler, and John forced down a smile.
“Oh, you must be John!” she exclaimed, her pink-rimmed mouth stretching into a wide smile. “I was hoping you’d arrive soon. I wanted to meet you before I left.”
“Yes,” he answered tartly, “the one with the glasses. And the name that’s four letters.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked to the floor, teeth digging into the corner of his lip. “Well-”
“You should do it in different voices,” he said, grin broadening as Sherlock’s scowl deepened. “Like for all the different characters.”
The blond didn’t answer, didn’t react at all for a seemingly endless moment, and Sherlock was just about to make another snarky comment and attempt an escape when John’s voice cut off the thought. “You didn’t trip on the stairs,” he said, soft but sure, and Sherlock flinched, ashamed of the knowing in his eyes.
Jeanette’s lips thinned as her smile tightened. “That’s the plan,” she said, her tone a half-step too high to be genuinely chipper, and Sherlock moved on, directing the discussion to the calmer waters of hobbies.
“I can go with her,” Sherlock interjected, grating his chair out across the floor, John’s stomach collapsing through the hardwood with disappointment. “I’m going up to Baker Street. I’ll just take her home and then walk back through Camden.”
Several close calls with second-degree burns later, John walked back into the living room, hovering at the arm of his chair a moment before dropping down onto the familiar red upholstery, tapping his mug with soft clinks of nails on ceramic as he surveyed the room like a newcomer. He drew breath in three times to say something before he finally managed it, and, when he spoke, his voice was hoarse, the syllables grating out like wheels over gravel. “I, er- I think we-”
“I highly doubt Mr. Parish would approve of that.”
The night air bit at his lungs as he sprinted away from the building, running around the back of the neighboring office complex, trying to stay both far from and parallel to the road their cabbie had taken. Through the gaps in the buildings, John could see a cross street up ahead, and weaved his way toward it, halfway over a chain-link fence before the realization hit him like a ton of bricks, dragging him down as he landed heavily beside a graffiti-splattered dumpster.
“-why would it matter if I thought you were gay?”
, for chrissake, it’s not like-”
going without John?
So, Mycroft had told him that too. And Sherlock had missed a tracker somewhere. Marvelous.
“You know what I mean,” he huffed, and John chuckled, lips settling into a smile as he dipped a nod.
“But-” John stammered, shuffling the gift between his hands, “But you bought it for Victor. Won’t it...bother you? Seeing it around?”
“You’re absurd.”
He swallowed.
“Hi,” he replied, and then they just stared at one another, smiling and slowly turning red, and John bit his lip, trying to stamp down a snort as he looked away.
“Well,” Sherlock mumbled, shrugging with a jolt, “
“Course I am!” Molly chirped, spinning back to the espresso machine as John laughed. “Now, look alive; I think those theatre majors are headed our way.”
“No, like is it- Are you- Do you mean it…
John chuckled, helping her hoist the box up onto the counter. “Molly, this thing weighs more than you do!” he chided, the girl glared at him as she straightened up from behind the cardboard barrier.
“I will drop you,” he warned, lifting his brows at Irene’s protruding tongue, and then tucked her tight to his chest, looking over her body and picking a path back to the door. It took a little longer with another person draped over him, but they made it through unscathed, John lifting his chin to say as much and coming face-to-face with Sherlock’s smirk.
Irene nodded.
“It’s not the same!” Sherlock started to argue, but Mycroft quickly lifted a hand.
“Maybe-” Sherlock murmured, eyes dropping to the floor, his pale fingers plucking at the side seam of his trousers. “Maybe later we could...pick up where we left off”—John blinked, eyes flashing to the sofa—“with Doctor Who.”
John blinked at him a moment longer, blue eyes hazy and glittering in the lamplight, and then nodded, the understanding sinking in that little bit delayed. “Okay,” he sighed, cheek falling to the sheet again as his eyes fluttered closed.
“I wouldn’t have asked,” Sherlock answered quietly, and John nodded down at the table.
YOU!?”
Horrific embarrassment notwithstanding, it was comforting to know Mycroft could still be surprised, though he recovered quick enough, reeling his eyes back in and straightening up with a clear of his throat. “Dinner is about to start,” he said, smoothing his jacket with a tug. “Everyone’s gathering in the ballroom.”
“No!”
John looked at him, seeing him properly for the first time now that Sherlock was fully facing him.
Sherlock froze, Elliot froze, the entire corridor froze except for the solitary figure of John Watson, shouldering through the gathered crowd with eyes that could probably burn you to ash if you looked into them long enough.
?” he echoed, one hand coming up to rest lightly on the outside of John’s thigh, but even that made John dizzy.
“What?” he blustered, but Irene remained unamused, her eyes hard as she stood up to face him.
“Seems to like you,” John added, hoping Sherlock would catch his direction and spare him from asking.
“Yeah … Yeah, okay … Yeah, we’ll be right there, we’re just down the street. … Okay … Okay, bye.” A small sigh. A rustle of clothing. “She’s at M&S.”
Sherlock rolled onto his stomach, bringing his shoulder to rest against John’s knee as he peered up at him. “John, I have never said this to another person in my entire life,” he began, sounding equally irritated and fond, “but, sometimes, you are too clever for your own good.”
“John?” Sherlock inquired, stepping back with concern, but John held up a hand, holding him off as he cleared his throat and stood back upright.
John waved to Dimmock where he and Molly were making their way down the hill, dropping to the grass at a spot to their right. Mike and Devon followed shortly behind, waving animatedly as they found a spot further downhill from the couple, giving them their space. More of the rugby team followed shortly thereafter, Tom Kenley’s bright red hair making him the only one John could clearly distinguish, but Sherlock answered his questioning gaze with the rest of the names. All totaled, including a few people neither John nor Sherlock could place names for, there were about 15 people awaiting the show, which Sherlock was making some final adjustments to.
“You ready to order?” John surmised, and Victor nodded, lifting the menu up in front of him.
“Well, you weren’t really there for most of it,” John prodded gently, and Sherlock winced.
“Basically, you don’t get anythin’ out ‘til the papers do,” Lestrade added with an audible shrug.
Sherlock frowned, tilting his head, John the sole focus of his piercing grey gaze as Molly and Irene had drifted into their own conversation. “I thought that was only in a theatre?” he remarked, and John huffed a laugh.
“No, I know what it
John chuckled faintly, shaking his head as he looked over his shoulder, watching Sherlock sink back into his chair in the kitchen. He stared at him awhile longer, the faint glow from the hearth reaching his gossamer curls even from that distance. John watched the light dance across the back of his neck, traversing down his perfectly-tailored silhouette, and smiled to himself as he turned back to the book in his lap.
“Well when do you remember her talking about it?”
“You knew they were gonna make me captain,” John said, a soft, glowing smile on his face as he turned. “How?”
Sherlock made a sound somewhere between a snarl and a scoff, his lip curling. “John prefers blondes,” he answered tartly.
“Nevermind, Sherlock.”
He was pants at hugs. What does one do with their
and help us tailor-make the experience as much as possible.
“But at what cost?!” Sherlock countered, and John laughed, shaking his head down at the small expanse of duvet between their folded legs. “If what I wanted to do required maths, I’d very quickly stop wanting to do it.”
He moved the glass to the floor beside Sherlock's bed, tucking the duvet in tighter around him as the man shivered. “Still cold?” he asked, and Sherlock nodded mutely, prompting John to cross to Sherlock’s wardrobe. The man didn’t have much in the way of warm clothing that would be remotely comfortable to sleep in, however, so John moved to his own drawers, pulling out a dark red hoodie, a rugby keepsake from his previous school, his surname beginning to peel around the edges of the white lettering across the back.
Sherlock could not reply, just breathed down the line as Molly’s words rolled over him, built up in him, straightening his spine and steadying his heart.
Sherlock only hummed, and John smiled, shaking his head as he hung it.
“Very well, sir, thank you,” he answered, smiling politely.
John’s jaw clenched, cheeks darkening as Sherlock sneered at him, and then he tried for the door again, getting only a few steps before John beckoned him back. “Sherlock, stop!”
, John loved him, loved him all the way to terrified, but his mouth still wasn’t ready for the words, so he settled for flicking open the button of Sherlock’s trousers, peeling away the zipper and boxers, and sliding his hand firmly down the length of his cock. Sherlock was already practically sobbing, the pitch of his soft whimpers and groans telling John just how close he already was, and John didn’t draw it out, his head already swimming with exhaustion after his own undoing.
Sherlock stood beside his chair, grey eyes scanning over John’s face, the gaze growing more harried with every sweep. He opened his mouth, drawing in a breath, and then closed in again, swallowing down at the ground before determinedly lifting his chin. “We went to secondary school together,” he muttered, pointing a thumb back at the door. “Victor and I. I-I don’t know who that was with him.”
while I’m working through a cause of death!”
“How, then?”
Sherlock leaned forward, his hands returning to their steepled position as his face contorted into the familiar, searching expression.
“Yes, well, this is different,” she clipped, lifting her chin, and Mycroft stared at her a moment longer before heaving a sigh.
“Do you still need all this...dead stuff?” He waggled his fingers down at the screen, and Sherlock shook his head with a chuckle.
Émile’s jaw dropped in affront. “I did not realize I would
He turned away as John pulled the fresh fabric over his head, hoisting his naked feet onto the mattress and tugging up the duvet, lying flat on his back with his head tipped toward the wall. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched John lean out the door, flicking off the staircase light and plunging them into darkness, and Sherlock blinked, trying to hurry his eyes’ adjustment to the lamplight washing in from the street.
the text read, the latest in the thread of his conversation with John—the previous installment being a series of ridiculous faces when the boy discovered an entire new page of emoticons—and Sherlock hesitated a moment, bare thumb hovering in the cold winter air.
“Sherlock!” John hissed, but it was too late, the EMT was already there, grabbing John by the uninjured arm and leading him toward the back of one of the vans. “No, it’s fine, really. Just a graze. Look, see?” John was trying very hard, Sherlock would give him that, but the EMT was having none of it.
Mary stopped, twirling on her heels to threaten down at him with a sharp finger. “You can’t say a
“Hmm?” John hummed, turning his chin down to follow Sherlock’s eyes. “Oh, ‘Whither the Fates call’.”
His head was throbbing even worse, his throat now sore and dry atop the continuing muscle aches, and he wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to fully open his eyes again, the light invading from around the edges of the drawn blinds already too much for him.
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, but John cut him off with a lifting brow, and, after a moment, he sighed, crossing in front of the hood and pulling the door open.
“We have- The police psychologist could-”
“I dunno,” Irene shrugged, unconcerned by his near-death experience, “it looked like bumping nasties to me. So you held hands?”
He tried to make himself angry, to summon the bitterness and betrayal that had kept him going these past three days, but nothing came, the fury evaporated, exhaustion the only byproduct, and Sherlock supposed it had only been a matter of time.
Sherlock was gone, the sheet cold to John’s touch as he ran his fingers over the wrinkled fabric, a single dark hair caught in the dent of the pillow the only proof he had ever been there at all.
“But I suppose you were convenient,” Lestrade shrugged. “You were gonna go on a murder spree anyway, can’t blame the guy for manipulating you into doing his dirty work too. He gets his competition out of the way, and you get to go to prison for a few extra counts of murder,” Lestrade said, smiling mockingly. “Sounds like a sweet deal to me.”
“Save room for cocktails,” he advised, trading Sherlock for his empty glass. “I have a suspicion we’ll be needing them.” He bobbed his head toward the foyer, a newly arrived trio handing their coats off to the porter.
“No.”
“Oh, thank
“Until you said it wasn’t,” John strained as he stumbled out of the tub, pushing Sherlock’s arm down slightly under the pressure.
“It better be,” he grumbled, latching the door shut once Sherlock was clear. “Those pictures would’ve been my Christmas cards for years.”
“A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia. I have a widow aunt, a dowager of great revenue, and she hath no child: From Athens is her house remote seven leagues; And she respects me as her only son. There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee - Sherlock, do we really have to do this?”
John chuckled, rolling his eyes at his friend’s smirk, but he stopped abruptly as he caught sight of Sherlock’s face.
“Oh, um, Ryan?” Molly called, taking a few strides forward as she lifted a hand toward him.
“Mycroft is Sherlock’s older brother,” he explained, pen scratching out numbers as he glanced between the card and the appropriate field. “The card’s in Sherlock’s name, but it takes from Mycroft’s account.”
Elliot smiled, his lips curling in a mocking twist. “Because I didn’t, and I need to copy it.”
Finally able to grin like an idiot, he did so with reckless abandon, driving back through the London streets on muscle memory more than conscious thought, sure his mobile was somehow literally burning against his thigh, and, the second he closed his flat door behind him 20 minutes later, he pulled the phone out, scrolling through the contacts to find the new one just below Sarah. He beamed down at the name, biting his lip to try and keep it under control, and then remembered there was no one at the flat but him, a smug shoulder-shake of a dance quickly joining his crazed grin.
“No,” Irene snorted, leaning back and folding her arms, “I hit him for me.
John grinned a moment before stifling it into something more austere. “No, I couldn’t do that. I doubt I could find another possibly, probably,
“They know not to touch anything,” he answered, his tone only hinting at the threat John could see smoldering in his eyes.
“You didn’t read my notes?”
Sherlock sighed, dropping the phone to his lap a moment. He could hear John saying it in his head, hear the unyielding tone clipping over his name like he had a thousand times before, and he knew it would do no good to lie.
“Why are there so many people here?” Sherlock asked as he dropped the money into her hand, and Molly sighed, shaking her head down at the cash.
“I don’t know why it wasn’t a red card,” Irene interjected, moving around to Greg’s shoulder as she too scanned John’s arm. “He’d been playing dirty the whole game.”
“Of course you know
The lights were on in one of the offices branching off the corridor, illuminating the door of the file room opening. John was on the wrong side to immediately see who emerged, the wood blocking his view, and his body lit with adrenaline, mind going through every possible escape route. All the rooms closest to him were dark, probably locked, and he couldn’t even risk so much as moving without the chance a squeaky shoe or rustle of fabric would give him away, but, a second later, the choice between fight or flight was taken away from him.
“Perhaps I will. Come to think of it, we could’ve been doing that all along. It’s already Thursday and we haven’t started
boring the first day”—a long-suffering sigh whistled over her lips—“but, last night, he went bar hopping with some friends. Ended up at one of those trying-to-be-trendy-so-it-isn’t clubs.” She crossed her legs the opposite direction with a shrug, exposing more of her legs. “Easy enough from there to get an invite back.”
And then, before John could so much as blink, it was gone, and Sherlock was all sharp angles and haughtiness once again.
“I managed to get him to go to treatment by letting him get more involved in cases,” Lestrade continued sadly, shaking his head down at the floor, “but sometimes weeks go by and nothing good comes across my desk.” He looked up at John, suddenly so much older, desperate concern stretching thick across his face. “I- If I don’t see him, I can’t…” He let the sentence drop away, but John felt it somewhere in the spinning mess of his stomach.
“209,” Mike said, folding the paper back up and handing it to John. “You just go up these stairs here, yeah? Second or third door on your right. Can’t remember which, but there’s numbers on them.”
“John’s not cynical,” he challenged, slurping at what was probably coffee even though John had told him a hundred times to switch to tea. “He’s actually
John continued with businesslike composure, oblivious to the development. “I was thinking about the Echo play-”
fires?!” John repeated, his voice shaking with laughter.
When they did touch, John’s hand gently cradling his as he turned and twisted it in examination, Sherlock thought he might faint, the world seeming to tilt beneath him, threatening to knock him off the narrow bench. How long had it been since someone had touched him like this—soft, tender, unmarked with expectation? Sure, there had been Victor, and the odd faceless anyone at a party here and there, but it had never meant anything, never carried any weight beyond the urgent need of a moment both parties later pretended had never occurred. But John… John held him like something fragile, something he knew was cracked in several places already, and, the more Sherlock thought about it, the more he realized that was probably true.
Sherlock watched him round the corner and disappear, never once looking back, and then dropped his eyes to the abandoned chair in front of him, his teeth worrying at his bottom lip as his coffee grew cold in front of him.
“WOOOO!!” Molly screamed, grabbing his closest hand in hers and waving it in the air, jumping wildly. “Did you see that!? DID YOU SEE THAT!!?”
“Bye,” he muttered, tossing his hand in an awkward wave, and Sherlock bowed his head in silent reply before dropping into the passenger seat, the car darting off before the door had even completely closed.
“You up for it?” Coach Powles finished with a confident smile.
Sherlock’s eyebrow lifted, and his arms untwisted to fall to his sides. “Yes,” he answered slowly. “Why?”
loved me!” John spouted back, defiantly holding his mother’s gaze. “Not
John watched him a moment, and then turned back, shaking his head fondly at a slurring Greg. “Weird coincidence though, isn’t it?” he asked, but looked back to find Sherlock shaking his head.
Too much light filtered through Sherlock’s eyelids, his fingers twitching against a cool firm surface, and he frowned, creeping one eye open and blinking his surroundings into focus. The sideways image of the living room met his gaze, grey morning light pouring in the windows, and he was seized with a yawn, wincing as his cheek pulled away from the leather sofa. The blanket that had been tucked around him slipped down from his shoulders as he pushed up onto an elbow, running the opposite hand through his sleep-crumpled hair, a sound in the kitchen doorway drawing his attention.
“You know, from
John shrugged. “He needed them. He’s whipping up some fireworks for tonight.”
“Vodka cranberry,” he said, leaning forward over the bar, his eyes fixed on the back of Sherlock’s head.
The door behind him flew open, and John whipped around at the sudden sound.
“Really?” Sherlock questioned, and John nodded, turning to him briefly as traffic slowed.
that he made even Sherlock Holmes more human, a bit of his heart bleeding in where Sherlock had known only loneliness before, something he had thought was completely normal until John had stepped into his laboratory that afternoon, a blinding example of all he’d been missing.
“Sure thing, pumpkin.”
“Oh, come on!” he urged, shaking his head fondly at Sherlock. “This is a little bit hilarious.”
“Okay, I-I know that was wrong,” he murmured, lifting his chin to meet Sherlock’s eyes, “and I feel awful, really; I never wanted you to find out.”
If Sherlock had been able to deduce anything poor about him at all, he would have declined, but the only thing that made Daniel not every bit the stereotypical grandfather figure he appeared was a smoking habit he couldn’t quite kick, and Sherlock could hardly fault him for that.
on the table as he flopped down into the armchair, the left armrest warmed in proximity to the fireplace. The leather-bound book creaked as it opened, and he wondered how long Mrs. Hudson had owned it, making a mental note to make sure every page of
“Oh, now it’s
Sherlock groaned, and a weight settled on the bed behind him as the intruder chuckled softly.
Sherlock huffed, his retort-ready mouth opening to a yawn instead, and John chuckled, squeezing his hand.
“Okay,” he repeated, barely a breath between them, and John scanned furtively between his eyes, searching for the lie.
John’s face scrunched with confusion. “What?”
Sherlock swallowed, closing his eyes to the ground, and then, nails digging into his palms as his hands curled to fists in his pockets, he lifted his head, back stiff and stoic against Lestrade. “That would be tremendously ambitious of him,” he bit, cold and venomous, and then strode forward, leaving Lestrade and his promise behind.
“You’re going to
“I did,” he confirmed, abandoning the suitcase for now as he spun on his knees, gingerly removing the scarf-wrapped skull to delve further into the box. “I just…didn’t bring much with me.”
His fingers hovered over the princess dossiers—as Molly had taken to calling them and he now couldn’t get out of his head—tempted to flip open just one now that he was here and it was real, but managed to refrain, distracting himself with the final items left to unpack from his briefcase. He placed his laptop on the desk, weaving the cord around one of the carved wooden legs to plug it in, and plugged his mobile in beside it, thinking it best to leave it to charge until after dinner just in case Siri got it in her head to give him a weather report in the middle of the soup course. There were a few other loose items—headphones, pound notes and coins he wouldn’t be needing, a nutrition bar he didn’t remember packing—that he placed in drawers or the bin, where applicable, before lifting the last object delicately out of the handkerchief he always wrapped it in for protection. The stamped silver pocket watch spun on the end of the fine chain like a hypnotic pendulum, the blue light of fading afternoon reflecting off the shell, and Sherlock watched it a moment before catching sight of the glowing numbers on the clock perched on the desk, cupping the trinket in his hand and placing it on the bed as he went to retrieve one of his suits from the closet.
They sat there a few moments longer, Mrs. Hudson seemingly content to let him wait until he was composed, and then he lifted his head from her, her hands shifting down his arms to his elbows as the gap between them widened.
One of Sherlock’s eyebrows lifted up toward his curls as he continued staring, his eyes searching John’s face. “That’s not what people normally say,” he muttered.
“Personal interest?”
Sherlock’s mouth moved soundlessly over the word, the boy’s name foreign on his tongue, though he knew exactly to whom it belonged.
“Like, on a scale of 1 to 10?”
Sherlock glared at him, but Mycroft stared stubbornly back, and he dropped his eyes after a moment, knowing it had been a rather feeble attempt.
. And, true to his obsessive nature, he wanted to hide him away, prolonging the inevitable moment when John would find other people who were more normal and grow tired of him. He wanted to keep him from rugby and Mike and Mary, with her sickly sweet perfume that Sherlock had inhaled from John’s jumper as they were looking through the photos that afternoon.
her!” John snarled, mashing at the button long after it had lit. “You practically do her
John grimaced up at the man, nodding, and Sherlock shook his head, though he didn’t look particularly surprised.
“Cheers,” John deadpanned, and Sherlock laughed, once again turning his head to peer out the passenger window, the corner of his temple resting against the glass.
!” John countered, and, with a snarl, Sherlock quickly thrust his pillow up, overbalancing John and sending him swaying back with a small yip of surprise.
“John, where are we-” he began, but John hushed him with a sharp hiss, completely ignoring Sherlock glaring at the back of his head.
“Twice?” Moran asked, but Moriarty flicked a hand dismissively through the air, leaning forward as he closed the file, tucking all the articles back inside save one, a photograph of the two boys that appeared to be taken from a camera inside a cab, the dark-haired one leaning on the blond’s shoulder while they both laughed, fingers interlaced on the seat between them.
“Careful!” he snapped, but Molly hushed him, bowing her head low over the wound, and Sherlock glanced over her shoulder, scanning across Mike and Mary’s concerned expressions before finding Ryan’s miserable one loitering in the doorway, a sense of satisfaction that felt very much like nausea whirling in his stomach.
The café was full of people, more crowded than it had probably ever been, but Sherlock was no longer aware of any of them, his mind shutting everything down to silence in an effort to process the impossible image in front of him.
Sherlock swallowed through a closing throat, knowing he was failing spectacularly at appearing impassive as he looked up at John, his elbows shaking with weakness as he fought to keep himself propped up.
A beat of absolute silence followed the statement, Prince John staring at him like he’d sprouted an extra head, and then the queen giggled, covering it with a cough and a dab of her napkin to the corners of her mouth.
On Wednesday, John went to rugby practice alone, Sherlock muttering something about homework, but John knew it was a case, and he never thought he’d miss being included in analyzing blood spatter quite so much.
“That’s not-” John started, and then emptied his lungs to the white moldings above them. “It doesn’t matter,” he murmured, his voice muted with liquor and exhaustion. “No one ever likes who they marry.” He blinked at the ceiling, his arm lifting to fold his hand under his neck where it was straining against the back of the chair. “Except my parents,” he mused, and then, catching himself. “And yours, I suppose.”
“I know it was an awful thing to do, alright?” he pleaded, trying to sort through the emotions on John’s face, but they were changing too fast for him to keep track of, and it didn’t help that his vision was blurring. “I know it was. But, John,” he urged, hoping his eyes conveyed half the sincerity of his pounding heart, “I
“No,” Sherlock replied sourly, but John had to suppress a sigh of relief. “I called Lestrade earlier, but all he had to offer were missing pets.” He grimaced at the apparently repulsive suggestion, causing John to chuckle.
Mary blustered, shaking her head in disbelief. “How is that better!?” she railed.
“I asked if you’d like something to drink,” she repeated, waving a hand toward Sherlock and the caffeine. “We have coffee, tea, bottles of water.”
Mrs. Watson tutted at him, ruffling a hand through his curls before returning to tucking in the corners of his bedsheets, something Sherlock had repeatedly touted the uselessness of, as he was just going to tear it all apart that night anyway, and never do it again, which made the whole teaching process equally pointless.
“’Course I am,” Dimmock replied jovially, turning to the side to wave an arm toward the door. “After you.”
“Still sore about him kicking your ass last year?” Irene quipped, Victor laughing as Seb glared.
After a full minute without a reply, Sherlock released the phone, placing it atop his chest as he closed his eyes, trying to hold onto the feeling, to capture the warm light of John’s however-vague presence and hold it out in front of him like a shield against the world, but, as always, it faded, and he sighed, blinking up at the ceiling as he shivered in the dark.
“Yeah, I know,” he shrugged, smiling brightly. “Couldn’t be helped.”
“Maybe you should try and sleep,” he suggested, folding his arms over his chest. “At least until Mrs. Hudson comes up with whatever she’s pretending to have made too much of today.”
Sherlock stilled, glancing to the cupboard across the room where he knew his yearbook was kept, but it was hardly worth the trouble with somewhere around 200 students in Year 13, and, besides, whoever it was might not even be in there if they were new.
John shifted his weight between the soles of his feet, growing increasingly uncomfortable with discussing his own hypothetical demise, but at least Sherlock looked mildly disquieted as well, the stiffness of his jaw a faint beacon of hope in a hurricane.
He tentatively picked it up, sniffing the liquid for some reason, as if that would help him decipher the intended recipient, and then took a small slurp. It was still hot, and
Sherlock blinked, a moment’s surprise, and then huffed a laugh that rang of relief, shaking his head down at his shoes. When he lifted it, he was smiling, a glint in his eyes as they held onto John’s. “Hungry?” he asked, and John’s shoulders fell limp as he wilted with a miserable groan.
When John’s aunt had suggested he apply to transfer to Langley College, a prestigious, private school on the outskirts of London, he had never dreamed he would actually get in. Transferring in for just the second year was practically unheard of, and his only connection to speak of was a friend of his aunt who worked as a secretary at the school. He was hardly a shoo-in. By some freak accident, however, he had gotten in, and he thought he ought to be a lot happier about it than he was.
“Hi,” Clara said, waggling her fingers and casting around a smile, her smile friendly despite her shy posture.
He blinked, just once, and his eyebrows shifted very slightly, but John couldn’t pin down quite what emotion that was.
The box looked normal enough—no obvious signs of tampering or suspicious powders/coloration—and he huffed a frustrated sigh, brows knitting together as he watched the pastel-colored shapes shift through the clear plastic window in the front. A pink heart tumbled down, positioned lettering-down against the heart-shaped viewing slot, and Sherlock froze, not daring to even breathe lest he shift the image away.
“No, you have to take it out,” he ordered, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, shaking his head as he popped open the top of the box.
“Fine,” John grumbled, scowling across at the wall as he folded his arms. After a moment’s silence, the frustrated creases of his face unfolded, and he looked back to Sherlock with a sigh. “So…what
“All I’m saying is, we’ve never met him, have we?” Anderson was grandstanding around the corner, the group of them gathered in Lestrade’s office, unaware Sherlock was lingering outside the door. “He never even
“I had Donovan pull a few cases,” he explained, beckoning to Anderson with a curl of his fingers, the slight man shuffling into the room to pause at Lestrade’s elbow. “Thought it might- Ya know,” he mumbled, tipping his head toward the box, and Sherlock nodded, a twinge of guilt nibbling at the pit he couldn’t shake from his stomach. The older man then cleared his throat, shuffling away toward where Mycroft still hovered in the doorway, his watchful eyes slightly narrowed as they swept over Anderson’s back. “Well, you, er, explain your…system, then,” he muttered gruffly, giving Anderson a brisk nod. “And then get back. I need you helping out downstairs,” he added, casting the man a pointed look, but the subtly was futile, Sherlock knowing from the second Anderson entered the room that he was helping the bomb squad sift through debris looking for pieces of the incendiary device—the soot under his nails had taken care of that.
“There’s an Indian place that’s pretty good,” John interjected, hands curling to fists as he thrust them into the pockets of his rugby jacket, jaw set and eyes fixed forward. “Or pizza. Couple places for that.”
A sign stuck to the polished, grey, stone walls of the corridor pointed him to the left for his room number, so he followed the hall as it cornered, his eyes flicking side-to-side as he scanned the numbers.
He looked back when he reached the opposite side of the room, and thought he saw the man’s eyes snap away from him, but it was too dark to say for certain. Smiling softly to himself, he grabbed a glass and one of the prepared silver pitchers of ice water, glancing over his shoulder as he wiped the developed condensation off the exterior with the designated rag sitting nearby.
,” he stressed, barely restraining his eyes from rolling, “I hate to be the one to burst your cynical bubble, but your ‘there are no happy endings’ mentality is hardly as unique as you think it is, so why don’t you go back to whatever artisanal coffee shop you crawled out of, slip on your non-prescription glasses, and continue working on that dark
“I- You’ve been here six days,” Sherlock snapped, and John smirked, shrugging as he sat the box on a steel rack beside the machines.
“That is a
Second, I am going to have to ask for your patience in this next month. In May alone, I am: going to my cousin's wedding, having another cousin staying with me for a couple weeks, moving to London for the summer,
“I’ve got time to change, then,” he said, opening his drawers and pulling out fresh jeans and a jumper, “before we meet the girls for practice.”
Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes at the interior of his locker as he steeled himself. “What?” he muttered, pushing the door shut as he turned, coming face-to-face with Elliot Newton, the suspiciously massive fullback for the rugby team.
“Jupiter’s the one with the spot, right?”
“I did last year,” she said as she rattled his pillow into its case, “but I have a flat in London now. There are a couple extra bedrooms too, in case Sherlock wants to stay over leave. Oh, but I’m being rude!” she exclaimed suddenly, turning around to him. “Here I am, talking your ear off, and you two haven’t even met!”
Sherlock blinked, a slow breath moving in and out of his lungs before he could reply. “Are you- Do you- I’m your…” He faltered, mouth moving soundlessly as John’s brows slowly rose expectantly.
“I’ll take your word for it,” the woman mocked, and Sherlock laughed, watching smoke twist up from his mouth toward the grey winter sky, and, just for that small moment, it didn’t feel like quite the end of the world.
“Hmm?” Sherlock murmured, already lost again. “Oh, right, yes, goodnight,” he muttered, frowning down at the ground ahead of his feet as he strode back down the corridor, shutting himself into his room with a do-not-disturb snap.
“Nothing to worry your pretty little head over,” she dismissed, airily waving a hand, and then lifted a brow, her eyes perusing his ensemble.
stop hovering outside the door, Sherlock was still in full-on sulk mode.
Sherlock turned, following John’s befuddled gaze to find that it was, in fact, a replica of the crown, encased within glass and sitting grandly on a velvet cushion just like the non-plastic one was likely displayed in the Tower of London at this very moment. “So it would appear,” he mused, and John’s mouth fell open, as if he had thought he was hallucinating until Sherlock confirmed it. “I think there’s one of the queen around here somewhere as well.”
“Yes,” Sherlock clipped, nodding, pleased to finally be understood.
Sherlock’s head throbbed in time with his heartbeat, his hearing wobbling in and out as his mouth went dry. “Why?” he breathed, feeling his throat work around the word even as it fell on deaf ears, but he must have produced some sound, as John hissed a disbelieving laugh.
“I just can,” she replied airily, dropping what little remained of her cigarette and grinding it beneath the sole of her shoe.
to drive you.”
John sneered at him, and then smiled, somehow feeling better under the barrage of insults. “Well, not tonight, okay?” he replied, rising to his feet again as he headed to his dresser for pajamas. “I’d rather save that for the more dire cases.”
fun happen last night?
“Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood; and here am I, and wode within this wood, because I cannot meet my Hermia.”
Sherlock tilted his head down at him.
“Impossible to say,” Sherlock answered, shrugging as he looked back at Ethan, who was now notably more nervous. “I doubt Ethan knows; it was likely only mentioned to him in passing, or perhaps in the hopes that it would be revealed.”
“Yeah, I’m-I’m fine. Just tired.” He attempted a weak smile, but John didn’t appear convinced.
“What?” Molly questioned, shaking her head perplexedly. “Embarrass him? What are you-” She paused, eyes blinking as her mouth slowly dropped. “John Watson,” she blurted, surprise quickly turning to affront, “are you actually being insecure right now!?”
“We’ll be back tomorrow afternoon,” John said, shaking off the conversation as he knelt down to zip his bag. “Eat the rest of that soup tonight, and don’t forget to drink plenty of water. There should be enough medicine to get you through, but you can text Molly if you need anything; she knows you’re gonna be here by yourself.”
, even on the train. We did that once, dear, remember?” She turned to her husband, barely giving him time to nod before continuing. “We were going to Ireland-”
“February 14
After a weekend of John “mother hen-ing”, as Donovan had put it at the crime scene on Saturday (a kidnapping Sherlock had deemed painfully dull and quickly revealed had been paid for by the father, who was about to lose custody of the children in the divorce), Sherlock had finally put his foot down, which was how John found himself working into a panic attack on Wednesday afternoon. It was 3:45, 15 minutes after double English had ended, and Sherlock had not been in class. Nor was he in the dorm or anywhere on the lawn, where John was currently sitting with Mary and desperately trying to focus on what she was saying rather than why Sherlock wasn’t answering his texts.
“Although, I suppose it did make for a rather awkward conversation with Daddy. Tell me, did he ask after your health at all? Or was it straight into your uni prospects?” Sherlock tilted his head, eyes narrowing as he scanned Taylor’s gradually reddening face. “Ah, I thought as much. Well, not to worry, I’m sure you can still get in on your academic merits. That is, if you stop sneaking out to smoke marijuana in the woods and actually open a book for-”
Sherlock stared at the sofa cushions, holding his breath as he waited for a reaction.
“Me?” He waved his hands up and down his body, smacking Sherlock on the arm when he wrinkled his nose with feigned indecision, and then moved toward the door, pressing his ear to the wood before opening it enough to peek his head into the corridor. “Alright,” he said, whispering for no logical reason, and Sherlock bit back a chuckle, moving to John’s shoulder as they entered the ballroom.
“Right,” he replied, the breathy syllable misting out over his lips. “Yes, it-it is getting rather late.”
“Warm!?” he spluttered, tugging at the sides of his coat, trying to milk every last degree of warmth from the fabric as he shivered. “I’m
There was a sound from across the hall, the telltale squeak of the bathroom door, and, flustered with panic, Sherlock scrambled to grab up the items, shaking them loose from the skull as he leapt to his desk. Wrenching open the bottom drawer, he shoved some papers aside, pulling up the false bottom created solely for this purpose, and throwing the trio inside before resetting the scene and slamming the drawer shut.
“I should probably stay nearby in case something goes awry, but you can go wherever you like,” he answered, not quite meeting John’s eyes.
“And I have pictures!”
It was only when the pale head was a distant dot bobbing against the deep green of the night-shaded grass that either one of them moved.
“Sherlock, look at me.”
John turned his fingers up, looking down at the faint, black smudges on the pads of the digits. “But…my lunch,” he murmured blearily.
Luckily—for Dimmock, at least, whose feet had begun shuffling awkwardly on the carpet—the door downstairs slammed shut, breaking them out of their tableau.
“Mr. Perfect?” she questioned, the nickname she’d coined for the mysterious admirer at some point over the past two days of near-continuous texting. “It’s only Wednesday, you know,” she clipped, sipping diet coke up her red-striped straw. “You should at least wait until you meet him before you fall head-over-tits.”
“I used it for a bookmark.”
The library was suddenly transformed into a vacuum, no air to be found as John’s mouth worked soundlessly for it. “I- I just- I thought-”
“I dunno,” he murmured, tipping his head, “I’ve seen worse.”
The double doors at the opposite end of the sitting room swung open with a sinister creek, a square of light reaching across the floor around a dark silhouette, all of them jumping at the intrusion.
Three minutes. He’d give them three more minutes. 9:10 was a nice round number, the kind of number just made for giving up on. Of course, but the time he actually stood up, brushing the clinging damp of the grass from the back of his coat and trousers, it was 9:13, although he supposed that was fitting in its own way, unlucky just the same as him.
“And then,
!?” Sherlock bleated, scandalized, mouth open and brows creased as he rounded on him.
“Then I’ll figure it out,” she interjected, quirking a corner of her lips in a small smile, and Sherlock chuckled in spite of himself, a frail sound that was mostly breath.
“Well, I am.”
Sherlock stuck his face into the spray with a sigh.
“Naturally,” he echoed with a strange, sudden sincerity, and John blinked, smile shifting softer.
“We worked on those all day,” John reminded, leaning forward to begin packing up the game, “and you’re the one who wanted to play this, remember? I listed off every game in there and
“Sherlock?” he panted, wondering where all the oxygen in the atmosphere had gone.
The room was decorated festively, holly and red ribbons draped along the chair rail moulding around the room. The table linens were embroidered with gold thread at the edges, a centerpiece of candles and a fragrant pine wreath the crowning glory of the table, directly beneath a crystal chandelier. It was the perfect Christmas scene, a home filled with laughter and—albeit unconventional—love, and John was a part of it. For once, he was a part of it.

“There you are!” Mycroft blustered, glowering as he planted his hands on his hips. “Didn’t you hear me calling? Come on, Mrs. Hudson’s ready to leave.”
,” Sherlock replied, passing John his drink and taking a bag of popcorn before leading the way to two beanbag chairs at the back, far removed from the rest of the group. “The first one; whatever it’s called.”
“They’re all really…er…” His forehead furrowed down at the paper as he hesitated, biting at the corner of his lower lip.
“Morning,” he remarked with a nod, eyes lingering on John’s shirt a moment as he scanned him, but Sherlock swept around his shoulder, pulling his attention away.
