“That’s thoughtful of you, Dean.” Cas said as he got lost in washing the dishes. Once they finished washing and drying, Dean pulled him into a dance, putting on a song they first listened to when they officially moved into their new home.
"The new scullery maid. His name is Dean and he's a miracle worker." Anna explained. Castiel was excited to try the food. Suddenly, Dean came out with some of the fois gras.
"I'll get on dusting the new hangar pronto." Cas said. Dean giggled and they held each other as they watched Miracle sniff at Airfry, who turned Human to play with him.
"Oh, I see. Well I'll fight to keep you from getting dead again." Emma promised. "But first, I MUST finish that Nomad. I hope the owner of the Nomad likes Home Improvement."
Along the drive, Dean decided to calmly explain all things Cas hadn't known yet from pop culture to porn. Porn was the first thing that needed to be explained because he was really confused by the Pizza man.
"Hello, Dean." Cas said as Dean tackled him to the ground in a tight hug, but did something he never thought he'd get to do ever: He kissed Cas. Hard and deep.
The boys were shuffling through the bunker. Dean was working through records when he saw something labeled "Winchester", as if some of the men of Letters were tracking them.
"Crowley gave me some time off. Thought I'd serenade you like I did after our first time." Dean smiled as he struggled a little. "Nervous, never serenaded anyone before. Not even my first love, Cassie. She was a reporter." Dean said. But enough about her, this is for you." He then began to play again and sang the first verse of "Change the world", Cas sitting down to listen as he contently sighed.

"I do know what I'm talking about. Lucifer, even now in his prison? Still bound with his sword and his sword is in Father's room, Father's slowly stroking at it as he misses the son he forced into the pit. I'm running away once the Apocalypse starts. No more Sunday dinners for me." Gabriel sighed.
"We have a new guest, ladies." Gabriel said as he came in. "Ellen, come meet Dean, Lord of Winchester. He's gonna be staying indefinitely. He's skin and bones, Ellen. Any chance we can give him some insectstanance?" Gabriel asked.
"I'll get something." Dean whispered to himself. Suddenly, he heard a knock on the door. "Dean?" Castiel called out.
"Her name was Sister Mary Constant. You'll know her grave when you see it. Meanwhile, I'm gonna go talk to the Alpha vampire, we're kinda tight." Dean said as he brought over candy and a pint of blood from one of Crowley's annoying minions who had caused some strife shortly before the year ended.
"A library, how original." Dean guffawed as he went in and collected the grace and found the Demon tablet. Then he returned to the bunker. "Hannah lock Metatron back up safe and sound?" Dean asked.
“Good to have you back, but I never wanna see that much of you again.” Sam said as he patted Dean on the back and then hugged him, then hugged Cas. “Otherwise, welcome home, guys.”
"I think he said that too. He said I could trust him, so I asked him to heal Sam. He's been wearing Sam this whole time to completely heal him from the inside out. He'll occasionally use his own powers to heal others when need be. For instance, when the Djinn poison was killing you.
"Miracle, yeah. Technically, she's my dad's. But I promised to walk her today since it's my day off from working at both his place and Harvelle's Roadhouse." Emma said.
They all ate in silence once Emma had come back down. With the exception of Jack and Emma of course, who were whispering to each other in hushed tones.
Dean fell into the warehouse Cas had been hiding in, just before Cas had absorbed all the souls. Cas frowned as he turned at the thump sound of a body falling, and then saw Dean rise up from the ground and approach him.
"His word for grub, dear. Forgive him, his sense of humor's not always for everyone. For me, it teeters on and off, but we ground each other nonetheless." Kali said as she kissed her husband's lips. Gabriel nuzzled her neck where he bit her and she smiled. "I'm Kali by the way, Indian ally of the crowned prince of Castle Shurley and resident of Thunderlief. We all have homes inside the outdoor activities. Omegas will sometimes choose whether they want to work or not. I choose to work in the apiary. Until Gabriel and I decided to have a child, then I temporarily resigned my duties to Jo, Ellen's daughter."
"Thanks, Mom." Dean said. "I missed you and Dad so much." Dean said as he hugged Mary back tighter than he hugged Jo.
"I'll explain it when you're older." Bobby said as he handed Sam his flask to sip some rutgut. Sam just sipped the rutgut and watched as his brother locked lips with the new God.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Left, then right. Stay true after." Sam said. Dean drove those directions and just about stopped when they got to the farmhouse.
"Mary looks too young to be a grandmother yet despite her being my grandmother. So I asked to call her Aunt Mary instead. She allows it. But I still have to call John Grandpa. He likes that." Emma said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Hey, it's not your fault. Stuff like that used to happen all the time when your uncle and I used to hunt. Hell, one time I was going after this monster, a rawhead that had kidnapped a pair of little kids. I killed the mother but I got electrocuted at the same time. Your uncle thought a spiritual healer would help save me. He was part right, but another guy who died at the same time I was healed, he was the same age and body type as me. Turns out the healer's wife was controlling a reaper to claim these people." Dean sighed. "She eventually bit it after Sam destroyed her alter and talisman she used to control the reaper."
Team Free Will 3.0, Courage and Ruby all witness the rise of past witnesses of the supernatural as well as the return of some of Courage's past spectres that have haunted the Bagge farm.
"WHAT?!" Michael yelped. "How DARE you?!" Michael roared as he smashed Castiel into a wall and then called Raphael. Once he had taken Castiel to get ripped a new one literally, Michael punched a wall and went to hide his sword.
"Good day, Sunshine" Dean said when Cas woke up about an hour after Dean did. "You're adorable when you sleep."
The doors opened again, this time smashing against the warehouse walls without so much as a touch, and Alastair strode confidently through them. Sam started to say something, but Alastair just rolled his eyes and flung him against a nearby tree, where he slumped to the ground, knocked out. Dean heard something crack, and hoped Sam hadn’t broken anything major.
“I’m sure we couldn’t have stopped it, Dean,” Sam said, breaking his silence with a grim, toneless voice. “If the angels couldn’t…”
“I was only worried I had hurt your feelings,” Cas said, a little angrily. “But judging from your reaction, I guess I did not.”
“Morning, Cas,” he said, trying to pretend nothing strange had happened and throwing his clothes on as fast as possible.
“Are you kidding?” Dean said. “Needlessly extravagant parties have huge potential for fun. Can I talk in a fancy accent the whole time? Can we engage in aggressive PDA and make the rest of your department jealous?”
“Of course,” Cas said, gratefully escaping the room. He liked everyone there, he really did, but the knowledge that greater crowds were coming his way soon was making him stressed. It was almost too much to have the six other people they had now -- how much worse would it be tomorrow? If this was too many people for Castiel to comfortably talk to Dean, how much harder would it be when the entire house was crammed with other people? As he opened his laptop, Cas began to conceive a series of increasingly bad schemes to get Dean alone as soon as possible. He could fake an injury. He could lure Dean out of the room with the promise of alcohol. He could go outside and lie in the snow and get hypothermia, and then he’d either die or force Dean to come find him. Win-win.
“I’ll get you started,” Alastair said. “Okay, why don’t we pretend that you just came out to your father. You just told him that you’re fucking that abominable angel who sprung you from hell. Repeat after me: ‘Dad, guess what, your precious all-American son is taking it up the ass from a fairy angel’-- oh, you don’t want to repeat after me, Dean-o? Okay, well let’s pretend you did, and then
Folks, it’s been a truly incredible journey so far, watching Dean Winchester, America’s most eligible bachelor, on his quest to both find love
“He has to know about it?” Dean said, wary. Anything his brother got told would go straight to Ruby’s ears, and she could be passing information on to anyone.
“Oh, Dean-o, everything I do is for a reason,” Alastair said, the demon’s gruesome face breaking slightly through the visage of his father. “Hey, what do you think your father would say now, if he could talk? Do you think he’d like that stud in your ear? Do you think he’d like to hear about what you did in hell?”
“So that you could surrender to them,” Cas continued, his voice loud and echoing unnaturally, even though they were outside and such a reverb shouldn’t have been possible. He moved to push Dean, but instead of hitting him, he flew them to another place Dean couldn’t hope to identify, a place with thick, succulent trees, a spongy ground that cushioned their landing, and a background symphony of chattering monkeys.
“I think it could be ironic,” Cas said, noting that it was the only tube of wrapping paper left in what had previously been a full bin.
He was trying to keep a positive attitude for the angel, and found it strangely easier than trying to do the same for Sam. There was just something about Cas -- his innocence, maybe, or his persistent belief that he should do “the right thing” --  that made Dean genuinely want to make him happy. It didn’t feel like a duty, or a burden -- it felt like a choice. Plus, Cas had never known Dean before hell, so there was less pressure to pretend to be his old self. He could just be.
I just want what’s best for the world, and luckily, what’s best for the world is what’s best for Dean, too. Who wants an absent God, anyways? Let
Their next stop was a stand selling “hard hot chocolate,” which Cas would never have stopped at if he was alone, but which Dean refused to pass up. Never mind that it was still the middle of the day, and they had shopping to do -- they still had to get peppermint hot chocolate, with double shots.
“Perhaps the powers that be thought you would flee the scene if you knew you had to socialize,” Jo said. She had clearly never forgiven him for being an awkward college student.
a real one with relationships and feelings and a penchant for cracking jokes at inappropriate times. A ghost of that person was still in Dean now, but he couldn’t imagine how to actually become who he used to be, or even anything close. He had died for Sam, so he must have cared for him deeply, more than he cared for himself, but thinking of that level of devotion now, Dean couldn’t help but just feel… tired. How had he managed it?
The first time Michael showed up in his new visage, Dean had been wasted at 4:00 in the afternoon, lying completely still on an uncomfortable motel mattress and staring at the ceiling. His first thought upon seeing Michael’s shimmering form had been that he was surely about to be murdered.
The bottle landed on Dean, because of course it did. Dean smiled mischievously and said something suggestive, something Cas didn’t remember because at the time of the saying, Cas was still somewhat scared of Dean and his blatant expression of his bisexuality, and tried to forget about any sexually charged moments the second they happened. Cas wasn’t in the closet, but he still kind of
“Holiday cheer like… that dead mouse stapled to the ceiling?” Jo said, gesturing to an obscene figure Cas had somehow missed.
Cas paused for a moment, then nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, show me, please,” he said. “I would like to do that.”
“Why would I kill Lilith?” Alastair said, unfolding his crossed legs and getting to his feet slowly. Dean wasn’t sure if it was his vessel or his demonic essence that made everything he said sound so disgustingly flirtatious, even things that shouldn’t be. “She’s my superior.”
Dean pretended to discover the “case” to hunt Alastair on his own after Cas left and Sam and Ruby came back. Sam didn’t understand why they had to hunt Alastair, nor did he seem to have a good grip on who, exactly, Alastair was. But Ruby understood immediately, and tried to convince Sam that it was a bad idea to go after him. Hence, Dean and Ruby entered an awkward standoff in which they both pretended not to know the details of what was happening, as Sam wildly misinterpreted everything.
“Shall we do some RPing with Daddy Dearest, here, while we have a moment?” Alastair continued. “Anything you’d like to tell him? Anything you’d like off your chest before Death comes and we all go back to hell?”
What would life be like once he told Dean the truth? He’d have to move on, find someone else to do Christmas and life things with. The past years had taught him that loneliness wasn’t a good answer, anymore. But as he and Dean struggled to carry their tree to the Impala, having stubbornly refused Alfie’s help after paying, he couldn’t visualize a life with anyone besides Dean. Dean, who was currently trying to coordinate their efforts by singing an abridged (and somewhat dirty) version of “Jingle Bells.”
“I know all that,” Cas said, staring at his hands. He knew what Dean was, probably even better than Sam did. It wasn’t what Dean
“Edge of the bed,” Cas said, pulling his legs and helping him line up so that he was lying on the edge of the bed, at the perfect spot for Cas to push in without having to bend too much. Dean felt the angel’s cockhead tease at his entrance for a few moments before he was pushing in, slowly so as to not hurt him. Dean groaned when he felt Cas bottom out, getting used to the dueling sensations of the slight soreness and the spike of arousal.
there would be a next time, assumed their two night stand might become a three night stand. He didn't know how to react to that.
At the racks, everything else disappeared except for the tortured soul, Dean, and whatever instruments Dean imagined up. The demons who had broken Dean were much, much more powerful, and had been able to conjure up whole worlds just to ruin Dean a little bit more, but for Dean (and most of the tortured souls), hell was just a hot, red bubble of blunt instruments and pain. Dean was somewhat grateful for the simplicity. It was easy enough to just pick up a knife and cut where he had been taught to cut, but to have to conjure up whole scenarios specifically to cause misery was a line he hoped he’d never be forced to cross.
“Cas, please,” Dean choked out, the cold air making his voice thicken and his eyes water after only a second.
“I should leave now,” Cas said, eyeing the door with a slightly panicked glimmer in his eyes. “I’ve been gone too long already. But I can ward you against any other angels with Enochian symbols, if you'd like.”
alarmingly messy, despite Sam’s escalating ferver. Castiel spent over an hour scrubbing the kitchen floor, which had a layer of crust on it that Cas had never noticed until he’d been forced to contemplate how a stranger might view it. It was unpleasant, thankless work, made only slightly better by Dean’s company. He kept up a relentless stream of judgements about this “Jess” character, who he had met a few times and liked, but was now clearly not to be trusted if he needed to
you need to be,” Zachariah said. “You’ve been trying to hide, I know it, but we have spies everywhere. You can’t hide forever, Dean. And those sigils you have on your ribs can’t block out Michael. He knows you too well.”
“No,” Cas said. “But most angels aren’t so sympathetic towards a boy with a demon best friend and demon blood in his own veins.”
not because he remembered how cautious Bobby was but because there was still the faintest trace of hell on him, a trace that recoiled and screamed at the contact.
“And I know it probably seemed rude that I didn’t kiss you under the stupid mistletoe,” Dean continued. “I know I should have just gone for the cheek or whatever. But Gabriel has been trying to force me to make some kind of move on you for the entire fucking time he’s been here, and I kept telling him I didn’t think you wanted that, but he wouldn’t listen --”
“That’s what I thought,” Cas said smugly. And though he would have thought it would take years before he could possibly fall asleep in such a position, with Dean so close and Cas so cold, he still drifted off almost immediately.
He ended up in a bar before he’d even really thought about his next stop. It was still light outside, and the bar was almost empty and strangely well-lit, not hiding any of the grime and grit of the place, but Dean didn’t care. He ordered and downed three shots in a row, savoring the burn in his throat.
What is this? Is this actually a real TV show? They can’t actually air something like this, right? Did Gabriel make this up?
“Hey, little bro,” Gabriel drawled. “Took you long enough to get here. Your presence has been requested in the upstairs bedrooms.”
that John brought up Sammy, we can segue into you getting yelled at for allowing your brother to become Lucifer’s true vessel, won’t that be fun? Do you want to get us started off with that?”
The incident in which Dean and Cas had technically touched lips had occurred during their college days. It had been a house party, one of Jo’s, and everyone had gotten drunker than usual since it was someone’s (Victor’s?) birthday. At the drunkest point in the night, there had been a game of spin the bottle crossed with seven minutes in heaven, in which the spinner had to spend a completely unsupervised length of time in a broom closet with the spinee. By the time it was Cas’s turn, Jo and Victor had already spent around twenty minutes in the closet, and Charlie and Benny, about one minute. Cas took the bottle with the hope that he wouldn’t get Benny. He hadn’t really realized that he was in love with Dean yet, so about that possibility, he was remarkably blasé.
“We’re cleaning so that Sam’s girlfriend isn’t scared away forever,” Charlie informed Cas in a cheerful tone.
“Right now, there’s nothing concrete that can be done,” Cas said, still pacing slightly. “Though I imagine your caseload is about to sharply increase. We are almost certain that Lucifer has not found his vessel yet, and as he is an angel, he cannot enter one against his host’s will, so that may buy us some time. But even without a vessel, Lucifer’s rising will certainly bring about more demonic activity than ever seen before. It’s said that he’s trying to weaponize the tortured souls in hell and use them as quasi-demons. And that is just the beginning.”
The demons nearest to him turned around, looking at him with a mixture of confusion and malice. At a cue Dean couldn’t see, they parted down the middle, allowing Dean to walk right up to the bonfire where the hostages were. He saw that his father was standing with his back turned, murmuring over a boiling pot of something. There was a beat as he finished, throwing something else into the pot that caused it to spark wildly, and then he turned around.
“We believe that Lucifer has located his true vessel,” Zachariah plowed on, with the tone of a frustrated professor who had given the same lecture dozens of times already. “Did you know that more powerful angels have less options for vessels? For me, this middle-aged salesman was one choice of several. For Michael and Lucifer, only humans from very specific bloodlines can sufficiently contain their power. Lucifer is closing in on his, so Michael must also find his. He remains in heaven as we speak, amorphous and unable to fight on earth.”
She looked offended, but Dean, who was already halfway out the door, didn’t appear to have heard her, so Cas just gave her an apologetic look and followed him out.
“Had to be in hiding for a while,” Gabriel said with a shrug. “Plus, I had special orders to fuck with Sam like that. He’s an important piece of the puzzle, you know.”
With a final burst of strength, Dean burst through the wall and sent himself flying into Alastair. His advantage was that Alastair was clearly not ready for the tackle, falling right over and taking Dean with him. His disadvantage was that Alastair played dirty and quickly had him pinned against the floor with the help of his demonic influence. He put the blunt blade to Dean’s throat. Distantly, Dean heard Sam yelling.
wanted to be with you for years, maybe decades, and I never even asked you if you wanted to be with me. And I realize it was fucked up of me to not even consult you, you know? I’m sorry.”
“You know, I just wanted to say something,” Sam said. “I know we’ve known each other for a long time, and somehow I’ve never said this, but… you know I consider you like family, right?”
Cas took a more inoffensive approach, hanging up the plain orbs from Sam in such a way that would hopefully trick the eye into believing that there were more ornaments on the tree than there actually were. They really hadn’t gotten enough ornaments to cover the tree, but pointing this out to Sam seemed like a moot point, as he was currently coming up with increasingly unhinged suggestions for ways to cover the remaining space on the tree.
"Ickett Bagge. Interesting name. Apparently, we're related to him through Grandpa Samuel's grandmother. Ickett's her brother." Dean said. "Married into the Campbell family, had Grandpa Samuel's father and the rest is history."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I love you too, Castiel." Dean reciprocated. "I can't wait to marry you." Dean held Cas as they fell asleep cuddling post-coitally.
"I could never say no to you, Dean." Garth said as they went inside. All the while, Miracle slept on her bed on the corner of Dean's side of the bed, dreaming of her exciting day of the butcher, Claire chasing her and Gabriel's dog Sparky falling for her. She was just glad to be home regardless of the good parts of the day. She was most especially glad Emma was safe.
"I see. Come, Dean. You look starved. Come have some porridge for breakfast. Ellen is the best cook in the estate. Second only to Kali, but only because I'm crazy about her." Gabriel said as he walked Dean into the estate.
"I never told Cas I love him. I told him I forgave him for everything, I prayed to him that I forgave him. But then he got sucked into where Demons and Angels go when they die and I can't bear it. He did what he could to protect us and heal us. But I don't-I can't think about losing him again." Dean began to have a panic attack.
"We'll be going to zoos and farms for field trips to learn about the behaviors. One of them has a humane apiary where the honey comes out from a tap." Castiel said.
"Oh, can I get that recipe? I'll trade you for the meatloaf." Mary said and Cas shook her hand as a deal.
“I’m thinking a farm somewhere. Or maybe a nice home in a cul de sac. Or even a cabin in the woods?” Dean asked as he looked Cas in the eyes.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I let Raphael take the fall after Crowley double-crossed me. They decimated him. Then all of Raphael's followers disbanded." Cas said.
"Not too bad. I've been working negotiations with The Empty and Hell. The Entity will be giving some Demons we actually got along with as well as Crowley. Rowena wants her son back. The Entity isn't sure what he wants in exchange for..." Jack stopped, Dean knowing who he was about to say the name of. "I know about what he told you, Dean. He loved you. I'm sorry if I'm breaking your heart." Jack added.
"I can stop Raphael. Please, you have to trust me." Misha said. Dean couldn't take it anymore and touched Misha's face.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Well Dean hooked up with an Amazon back in late 2011 early 2012, when Emma was born. She looks 16, but she's actually 9. Anyway, Emma was supposed to gain her powers by killing Dean, but before anything could come of that, I shot her in the head." Sam said. "Then we fought about it and I ended up throwing it back in his face about when he killed Amy, comparing the two." Sam said.
"Sorry I'm late, just finished reading about women in white. Hey, Dad. Cas, did you make a beef roast?" Emma asked.
"Why would I kill you?" Dean asked. "Cas, I came here to find you so I could be with you. To tell you I missed you and that when I was dying, I thought about the one thing I regretted." Dean then picked Cas up and sat him back down in the bed. Then Dean walked over to the other side of the bed and started slowly stripping out of his clothes. He left his boxers on as he crawled into the bed and began to hold Cas close to him. "The one thing I regretted was that I never told you how I feel about you, Cas. The truth is I've been in love with you since that week we worked a case together. When we interrogated Raphael together." Dean looked into Cas's eyes as he said this. "After we ran out of that brothel, god that was a bad idea. But damn if it wasn't an adrenaline rush. But I realized when I said I hadn't laughed hard in a long time, that I was in love with you." Dean said. "And when you left to continue your search for God? I regretted letting you go because I'm not okay alone, Cas. I was okay being without Sam, there's a difference." He stroked Cas's cheek, but Cas hesitated leaning into it.
Dean shook. The air was too thin to breathe. He couldn't speak. Had the demon literally stolen his voice? It sounded like it. Felt like it. She took Cas away, and the door slammed closed and locked behind them.
This was all Dean's fault. He was too hard on Cas. The guy just wanted to help. Always. Even when the two of them disagreed, Dean didn’t doubt that the angel’s motivations were good and pure. Cas couldn’t be anything but that, and he had learned so much about humanity and compassion since his time on earth. Dean had never thanked him enough. He should have been more patient. A better friend. This whole thing was his fault.
The cold dirt parted as Cas dug both hands into the ground. Though his body protested, he forced himself to pull, crawling along the hard earth. At the unpleasant scrape, he remembered his lack of shirt. The tie still wrapped around his neck tightened as he dragged himself on his belly.
"Dean," he managed, and though he'd meant to sound comforting and full of assurance that he was fine, all that he sounded was weak. "The succubus--"
Suddenly, the real world dimmed, and the face of the succubus overpowered Dean’s thoughts. Her round, blue eyes and full pouty lips conspired to fulfill his every desire. He wanted her and hated that he wanted her. At the memory of the demon’s heated touch between his legs, her hot mouth lapping at the spilled seed on his jeans in apparent joy, Dean shut himself down as much as he possibly could. He didn’t want to remember—not the lust, the weakness, the longing, guilt, self-hatred—none of it. But the demon bitch was still in his mind, torturing him even now. He had to shake the memories, but they pressed upon the backs of his eyes. Her voice slithered between his ears.
Well, this was the end. Second death would come swiftly here. Monsters populated this world, and he was defenseless. One of them would find him and, if Castiel was fortunate, kill him quickly. Cas prayed that Dean would survive and not end up here.
Dean glanced at Cas, and for the first time in days, the two maintained eye contact. Cas felt like he shouldn’t look. He remembered how fiercely Dean had yelled that he didn’t want to see the color of Castiel’s eyes. But right now, Dean seemed to be begging Cas to stay present, to not look away and leave him alone again. So Cas trusted this moment and held his gaze.
Dean reached for Cas’s right hand and pulled it over his left shoulder. He bent his knees and aligned Castiel’s torso across the expanse of his upper back. Then, with a breath and a mighty heave, Dean stood. He held Cas's hands and feet close together, making a tidy bundle and wearing Cas's weight like a shawl around his shoulders.
The world shook. Cas’s lungs rebelled against the air. His body vibrated, and his injuries shouted out their hatred.
"Oh, shit," he growled and shut his eyes as his vision swam. He didn't have enough blood to be this hard. He pulled a gasp in through his lips and bit down on the bottom one. He envisioned Cas's neck. His eyes. His hands. That stupid sexy suit and the way it clung to his shoulders and waist.
Okay, new plan. Come hands-free. As soon as Dean took care of his obnoxious, needy, abused (but not in a fun way) dick, he could get back to the escape plan. And bonus! When the succubus tried to seduce him again, he wouldn't be so desperate to come since he would have already done so. He’d be able to resist her. This was a good idea.
This is a passion project for me, as my regular naughty novels are my actual job. So I can't give you any guarantees of when I'll be updating, but I'll try to keep the chapters coming!
Fingernails dug into clammy palms as Cas’s fists tightened. He hushed, “He isn’t too proud. He just doesn’t want to frighten me. Dean makes himself look strong so others can feel safe.”
Everything went black as Dean slammed his eyes shut. He squeezed his head with both hands and listened to Doc’s words through the pounding of blood in his ears.
If Castiel were embarrassed or disgusted, every inch of his face would show it, and Dean would be forced to accept Cas’s distaste of the hand-holding moment. But right now, Dean didn’t have to look. He didn’t have to see if Cas hated how Dean had grabbed for him, if he despised the contact or felt disappointed in Dean. So the hunter kept his eyes closed and held on, both to Castiel’s hand and the fantasy that Cas might need to feel Dean's hand just as badly.
Doc continued, “I think it best for you to tell me exactly what happened and what I might find in that shoulder. I want to be as prepared as possible for what to expect.”
Cas kept his eyes downturned. The demoness untied his wrists from the pipe, and Cas let out a cry of pain. The succubus slammed her hand over his mouth. The angel’s blue eyes flashed wide, and Dean saw into them without feeling their usual connection.
Dean grit his teeth and bore down on pure grit and determination to pull himself into a sitting position. His head swam, and while he knew he and Cas still held hands, he also felt more strange about it in a seated position. But the angel hadn’t tried to let go yet so neither would Dean. Not as long as the blanket covered their hands, at least.
No response. But as long as Dean was asking, the demoness wasn’t torturing his thoughts. So Dean kept repeating the angel’s name into the nothing.
Dean’s view of Cas became blocked as the succubus pulled a sheet of plaid over her head, followed by a blood-covered undershirt. She was disrobing, and Cas looked upward, seeming pained. The longer Dean observed, the more he understood Cas’s expression. It was longing. Cas seemed hungry for what he thought was Dean’s body. The expression was foreign on Cas’s face but it wasn’t a mystery. Dean had been looked at like that before. Hell, he’d probably worn that expression of desire for another person’s body for a good portion of his life, but not usually with the torment that Cas also wore. He couldn’t stop looking at fake Dean’s torso, but it seemed like he really wished he could. He begged for water, but the demoness denied him again.
“You’ve done so,” snapped the doctor. Dean felt sorry for the old man. He and Cas were putting him through the ringer with all their injuries, and Dean felt certain the old man had handled them as good as any modern doctor would have. The man deserved a rest. His eyes were already closed when he asked, “Anything else?”
She blinked at him from the door. “You’re trying to make me torture you so I won’t go back to him, aren’t you?”
No, Sam had seen the fierce look in Gabe’s eyes. Heard the desperate tone in his voice. And the vial of angel grace clasped in Sam’s right hand told him there was some bigger picture. And the words, “Give this to my brother…” played on repeat in Sam’s head. Gabriel had to have meant Castiel. Surely he had sent them all, Sam, Cas, and Dean, to the same place. Or at least the same general area. Gabriel a.k.a. Loki was a trickster, yes, but he hadn’t played any serious pranks in years, and fighting for survival against a demon succubus didn’t seem like the time to start up again. Surely Gabriel wouldn’t have done anything so cruel as to hide everyone in different places. Sam didn’t think it was likely, but there was no sign of either Cas or Dean. No blood, no trail. Nothing. Not even after hours of searching.
Dean heard his own voice and could have jumped out of his skin. It was him speaking, but his voice came from her.
“No courtin’ in my house,” he scolded, voice rough like a dog’s bark. “I ain’t got the stomach for it.”
Cas waited for Dean to untie him, but the man took a sip from the water bottle and leaned forward with his elbows on his knees.
Dean couldn’t lay on the ground all night. The chill coming up from the earth was making him shiver already, and the sun hadn’t even set all the way. So, he got up. He took his time, careful not to rush and pass out. Blood oozed from the large wound in his thigh, but it was a sluggish leak, and the leg could bear some weight. So Dean walked. He didn’t know where to, but there was a dark pillar of billowy cloud in the sky, and he pointed himself in that direction.
Dean felt shaky. He didn’t want to be ashamed, but he couldn’t help it. He knew it was messed up and impossible, what he wanted to have with Cas, but knowing that didn’t help it go away. And the sex-demon who wanted to torture them both was the only other living being who knew of Dean’s thoughts about Cas. How fucked up was that?
Filthy, sweat-stained, bloody fabric had been stuffed in Castiel’s shoulder for days now. His body might have started healing over. Doc would probably have to open the wound again to get it out. And everyone thought this was Dean's doing.
Dean traced his heartbeat back to his real body. He flexed his hands, felt the ache in his shoulders and the sting of pain in his wrists from being cuffed so tight for so long. He closed his eyes, but that did nothing to block out the crystal clear broadcast of the demon’s view of Cas. Dean heard his own voice tell the other man, “Take your clothes off.”
God, he hated this bitch! He hated that she tried to use Cas against him. He hated that he couldn't show how much it hurt to see his friend in pain. Hated that he had to pretend he didn't care. He'd hoped to convince the succubus that torturing Cas wouldn't break Dean. But it almost did. God, it almost did.
Dean might bust his stitches and bleed all over the place in the process, but he figured he could make it to Cas, hoist the angel over his shoulder, and hurry out the door in decent enough time to outrun the old man and the red-headed woman.
Unless the shack had vanished leaving no trace behind, this was a new location. Perhaps in the same forest—the time of day matched up—but the air had a different quality. It felt colder. Less muggy.
"Whatever happened to Jack, Brother. We will find him, I promised you then and I still promise you." Castiel assured his brother. Soon though, they reached the castle.
"Come on, man. We'll get you back home and into cleaner clothes. And Cas? Don't almost die on me again." Dean said as Cas nodded in agreement.
"He's not completely gone, maybe this demon knew something we didn't yet." Bobby said. Crowley soon opened his mouth for the first time in a while.
April led Castiel into her home and they began to talk as she tended to his wounds. They later had dinner, but little did Cas know the drink she'd given him was spiked with Djinn poison. Cas passed out immediately and she swiped his Angel blade off of him as he slept.
“Yeah, after that,” Dean said. “I’m supposed to leave Bobby’s tomorrow, and I guess my question is… where are you going? And am I invited?”
“Sam Winchester,” he said, licking his lips hungrily. “The things I’d do to you… but I can’t. It’s against orders.”
Yeah, I guess, consider yourselves spoiled. I’m not about to join up with the devil and become a demon, thanks.
Cas sighed, and moved to stand directly across from Dean and Sam. “You may want to sit down for this,” he said, gesturing at the bed.
And then, finally, there was a break. Ruby showed up one day, looking worse for the wear, claiming that Alastair had at last picked a new vessel and was going to perform a complicated ritual the following night. And even better, he supposedly had the Colt, and was intending to use it in the ritual.
“Okay,” Cas said, talking through a yawn. “I’ll wrap the presents, if you will be my wrapping assistant. I’ll need a cup of coffee, scissors, and some tape.”
“Okay, fine,” Dean said, holding his hands up in surrender though Sam couldn’t see him. “Time in hell moves differently than on earth, and for me, ten months was a hundred years. You happy to know that? Are you glad you forced me to tell you that? I’m 129 years old, and now
“Alcohol helps you forget the things you’ve done wrong,” Dean continued, nudging the pitcher towards Cas.
“Hell?” Dean said. He tried to do the math in his head -- three days topside had to be at least a year down below. “You didn’t get out when I did?”
“Woah, hold your horses,” Zachariah said. Dean hadn’t even realized, but he’d subconsciously gone for a door that wasn’t there, intending to find Sam. “You can stop Sam another way. A better way.”
They knew the town Alastair was in -- some middle-of-nowhere place in Missouri -- but the only clue they had as to what ritual he was planning, exactly, was a few minor disappearances. They beelined for the area, hoping to figure out more.
“Uh, Cas?” Dean said, clearing his throat quietly. “Usually people don’t stand this close to each other.”
“I suppose,” Cas said. Maybe it was Dean’s imagination, but Cas’s gaze seemed to be trained down slightly, eyeing his lips.
“It’s not Dad,” Dean said, taking another turn with the binoculars. “I don't think Dad's in there. It’s just Alastair. But... he’s in Dad.”
Sam barely reacted, and Dean found himself wondering what the hell was going on with his brother. Normally Sam wasted no opportunity to get mad at anyone who implied he was
“Normally the vessels have to offer permission,” Castiel said. “This being the realm of the damned, I was able to bend the rules and borrow this one, but I don’t have much time.” He stepped closer to Dean, looking deep into his eyes. Dean found himself unable to look away. “Will you join me in my escape?”
“Then why?” Dean said. “Why me? Isn’t there a whole army of souls in hell that would love to get out? Why did you pick
“Well, these are probably the weird, outcast angels, but yeah, reassuring sentiment all the same, isn’t it?”
Dean scanned down the line of new arrivals, not sure what he was looking for. They all looked like demons to him, poorly-disguised, lower-level ones who wore their vessels uncomfortably and in such a way that their true faces showed through readily, if one knew how to look. None could be Alastair, who Dean swore he’d be able to recognize in any body, at any time. He was just about to put the binoculars down and tell Sam as much when his vision landed on the last demon in the line, and his blood ran cold.
Sam knocked on the door of the trailer with an authoritative firmness. “Ms. Flannigan?” he called out, to no response. They waited a moment.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m your brother, and I thought we both were on the same page that we’re hunters, and we try to get as many of the bad guys as possible. Is that not the situation?” Dean said, pulling out the knife he always kept on hand and flipping it in his hand rapidly.
sometimes happen. I was ordered to take you here because we have work for you, as I've told you already. But that work is not of import right now. You should go to Sam.”
“Okay,” Cas said, and then, for the first time in his life, he was leaning forward to kiss someone he was confident he actually
Everyone eventually dispersed again to get dressed -- they were supposed to be “looking their best”, which hadn’t seemed like a big deal until Cas had received the news that at the party tomorrow they were supposed to somehow be looking even better. He hadn’t brought a suit or anything, but everyone else seemed to be prepared to dress to the nines, even Dean, who often took issue with this type of thing.
“Wait, how is that possible?” Jo said. “Didn’t you guys have to seven minutes in heaven once, or something?”
“No offense, but I’m a little surprised,” Dean said. “You have way more of a stick up your ass than Gabriel. Like, at least Gabriel has a sense of humor, you know?”
“Hmm,” Cas hummed, using his other hand to unexpectedly grip Dean’s hard member and start jacking him off. The double onslaught caused Dean to moan involuntarily, thrusting up into Cas’s hand.
Anticipating a call from Cas, Dean kept an eye on his phone, but unfortunately the next person to call him was his brother, not Cas.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” he said, after adding most of the ingredients to the golden bowl. “I need a drop of your blood.” He looked genuinely regretful.
Cas pushed open the door to his room, and was accosted by an alarming smell. He flipped on the aged light to see that the room, which had appeared so clean before, now had a heap of junk from the other rooms mysteriously piled onto the bed. Approaching the pile, Castiel noticed a dead mouse and what looked like the remnants of a stink bomb.
The previous day, they had picked out an abandoned warehouse as the site of the trap. Cas immediately got to work, and drew a number of intricate sigils on the walls, while Dean carefully poured the holy oil. Once the sigils were up, Cas stalled for a little while longer, trying to find something to improve, before consenting to begin the ritual.
“Cas,” he said quietly. His voice was hoarse from all the yelling and the lack of water, and sounded unnaturally deep to his ears. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Castiel, I pray that you have your ears on, and have noticed that your asshole brother put me in a giant white box. I could really use some help getting out of this one. Sam needs me.”
“It is,” Dean said. “But you volunteered to wrap our presents, remember? I needed you to wake up so we could get it done before we decorate the tree.”
“All right, Michael, you son of a bitch,” Dean whispered. “I’m about to walk into an army of fucking demons, demons who hate me and want to tear apart this vessel you seem to love so much. If you’re serious about ‘being on my side,’ you’ll keep that from happening. If not… well… I’ll see you in hell, I guess. Prayer over. Amen.”
The eyes returned to normal before Dean could decide if he had just been hallucinating them, and the soul turned to look right at him without fear. Something told Dean that the tortured soul was temporarily not the one in control of this vessel.
“Yeah, we need to run,” he said. “It’s too late. Death is rising.” A quick glance at the hole in the ground revealed that it was getting larger, swallowing the bodies of the now-dead hostages as it expanded outwards.
Sam also ended up causing his fair share of tense moments, surprisingly. The sparse, poorly fleshed-out Sam from Dean’s memories was basically a saint, hanging onto Dean’s every word, always making the morally correct decisions, and smarter than Dean, to boot. Dean had to wonder if his memory was faulty, or if Sam had just gotten stupider since Dean had been gone. The kid trusted Ruby to a truly incomprehensible degree, despite Dean’s constant dissent, and snuck out (presumably to see her) at least once a week. Arguably even worse than the sneaking and the lying was the fact that Sam was so bad at hiding it. Had he always been so transparent?
person. It really was pathetic that despite all the people Cas had attempted to date in his twenties (before he’d given up and lost the will to date anyone besides Dean), a man who he’d technically never even kissed was still the man that he thought of the most.
To Dean’s relief, Cas did not appear to be uncomfortable by the events of the previous night, nor did he appear to be angry at all or keen to talk about it. He supposed that the prospect of trapping an archangel would probably be enough to distract anyone.
“That does look lovely,” Cas said, looking at Dean’s work. “Maybe you should have been the one to do the wrapping.” His own most recent attempt was looking more like a blob than anything else, with the
“What can we possibly do against so many demons?” Dean mused. “The only thing we can do to get close to Alastair is to get ourselves captured, but that doesn’t seem like a good idea.”
was currently the one locked into the panic room. Nursing his bruised knuckles, Cas wondered if he would ever be able to fall asleep again, or if he should just ram his head into the door until he passed out.
“I’ve seen this one, I’ll tell you the ending,” Gabriel said. “She forgives him, becomes a princess, and the blonde woman who was her rival ends up being exiled.”
But his eyes eventually adjusted to the near-complete darkness, and something about the quality of the wood didn’t seem like what he was used to in hell. Everything in the pits was like a bad dream -- dark and red, with all the details but the most agonizing and pertinent ones elegantly blurred out. It wasn’t something you’d notice in the moment, but here, with a comparison readily available, the difference was obvious. Dean shouldn’t be able to see the individual grains in the wood of the coffin. His legs and arms should already be cramping excessively from the limited range of motion. The coffin’s top should be converging threateningly on him.
He rushed the demoness. She dodged, but barely in time, and Dean realized that the knife in her brain might actually be affecting her. Again, Sam lunged toward her and nearly landed the blow. Maybe he stood a chance.
Release after five days of pent-up desire was dizzying, to put it in very mild terms. His vision went red and black and white. His ears rang with his heartbeat. It was exquisite and painful. The orgasm lasted an eternity and nearly made him pass out.
Dean unconscious. Covered in blood. Jaw slack, body limp. Light had shot from the fingertips of the succubus’s hand and into Dean’s temples. With a jolt and another scream, the hunter had jerked awake looking lost and horrified. But that expression seemed pleasant compared to the look on his face when he had noticed Castiel in chains. It made the water in Cas’s stomach sour.
“—Coming to check on my patients?” teased the old man before taking another drink from his glass. The following wince was further evidence of liquor.
The young man chuckled. “Well, you look a right sight better than you did in the road so that’s sumthin’.” He then gestured to Dean. “And your friend’s here, too.”
Dean heard himself wheeze, felt the crushing pain in his chest, and knew that he was having a panic attack. Sam used to get them all the time when they were kids, but he’d never had one before. He felt a new respect for Sammy. This shit was terrifying.
There was pain, pain, and more pain. But there was no twisted sexual pleasure. No demonic lust coursing through Dean’s brain, making him long for agony, death, and orgasm.
The old man flexed his hands into fists before releasing the tension with a sigh and shake of his head. He placed his spectacles back on the bridge of his nose and hooked the wires behind his ears.
Cas laid in bed while talking to Sam. He was waiting for his essence to fade from existence. He was in a hotel room, staring at the ceiling and wearing nothing but a blue robe. It took a while for Dean to find where Cas was, but he soon heard his Angel's voice and immediately melted. He flew into Cas's room and hid in the corner, making himself invisible as Cas talked to Sam. Dean rolled his eyes when Cas said Sam's name.
"Of course, Jack. Would you like strawberry cream cheese on it like usual?" The professor asked and the little boy, Jack, nodded enthusiastically. Luckily, Dean had just bought a container of strawberry cream cheese to put on the scones. "You want a scone or turnover, Claire?" He asked the older youth, a girl seemingly the same age as Emma.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dean softly sang to Cas as he twirled the love of his life around the living room floor. Cas giggled giddily.
"Not only that." Emma said. Suddenly, Rowena came back from Hell to see on all the witches that are gonna be demons.
"Lies." He said. Annoyed by this guy already since Emma said it was time to go home, Miracle managed to get out of her collar and ran to get help.
"Shhh, the secret ingredient is vinegar." Courage whispered to Miracle, who made a shrugging face and tucked in.
"I'll be up, babe." Sam said and she smiled as she walked upstairs to prepare herself. Once she was out of earshot, Sam smacked Dean's shoulder.
"Just want to do a simple spell to eradicate Amazons. I wasn't hoping to come across one though so soon." Dale said. Emma began to struggle, but Giselle found her swiss army knife Dean had given her after she began to work at the roadhouse.
"Don't even, Michael. I need to roam in an area of compassion. I'm leaving now. Tell Castiel I'll miss him and we'll see each other again." Gabriel said as Michael nodded, shaking his head.
"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! I don't like this. That sounded too much like a plain old rainstorm or my name is Jensen. And it's NOT!" Courage said. Miracle licked his cheek and Courage smiled sadly at him. Just then, a knock came at the front door and Dean got it, revealing Jack.
"CASTIEL!" Michael called out as he came into the young Angel's chamber. "You must stop taking my sword."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Once they were home after that dinner experience, Dean looked out through the windshield and saw Bobby and Karen were alive.
"Of course. And to also let you know I'm reviving my Alphas and fallen fellow monsters. I will even repair the feasting habits of one of my monsters that you killed, Castiel. Like I said before, there's a balance that needs repaired. You kill a few monsters, I birth a few monsters.". Eve explained. "I also asked Amara to help me with a Phoenix whose wife was murdered and he was framed for her murder." Eve added. "Anyway, the dragon is a gift for your union, I call him Airfry." She presented the dragon, who licked Dean's face and nuzzled up to Cas.
"Yessir." Dean said with a grin. Meanwhile, Jo made floor measurements and Ash and Pamela got started on the sign on the building.
"Well Damn." Sam said as he sipped a beer. Dean looked at the table of contents and saw there was a family tree for both Henry and for Mary's side. Together, Dean and Sam looked over John's side. Nothing to add, but when they got to the Campbells? Dean saw a guy with a protruding jaw and long beard. He was about as bald as Samuel.
"Great. I'm gonna go for a quick run, then I'll get dinner started. All you need to bring is your appetite." Dean smiled, but then remembered the last time he was here. He suddenly felt a cold essence and a twisted stomach as he recalled Gen's shrill, hysterical screams of "MISHA WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT!", and Dean started running to find Misha. Sam chased after him.
"What?" Lucifer asked confused before he realized he thought Dean was his new betrothed. "Oh, no. I'm still forever in love with Kelly. This is our new future brother-in-law, Dean of Winchester." Lucifer cleared.
"You taste even more amazing than that first time." Dean said between kisses, lips still attached to Cas's. "Even sweeter than the first time. I mean your lips are always sweet, but there's a difference in how sweet they are between when you were still Human and now. Gotta be the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches you consume." Dean said.
"My mother was struck by lightning the day I was born." Castiel explained. Lucifer's the oldest of the family, he tells me everything about her. Thunderlief was where she was struck by lightning. I was gifted powers once I was born. That day it happened was a Thursday. Thus why they gifted Thunderlief to me. Thursday is the day named after the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. The point is the lightning strike made me able to understand animals. Father was intrigued by my abilities, but my mother succumbed to her injuries. Father stopped taking interest then." Castiel sighed. "I'm glad Lucifer, Michael and Gabriel were there to take care of me." Lucifer walked up to them.
"It takes about 4-6 hours to cook anyway. Take-out and tomorrow night we make the roast?" Cas asked.
"I'm glad you're here, it gets boring around here when you and Lucifer aren't here. But the new servant is my favorite so far. He cleans efficiently. Sometimes I offer to help, but I forget myself and he asks me to leave to my chambers so he could reclean what I dirtied up again." Samandriel sighed. "He did a great job his first day too. But according to Duma, Father threatened that if Dean didn't, he'd send him to Prince Azazel."
"We're doing this on the couch, huh? We haven't even eaten yet. Honey baked ribeye roast for dinner tonight." Cas said.
"He put the blade in my hand after I died. He told me that Cain had to die to become the first Demon. The mark, when combined with the blade, will turn a dying or dead man into a Demon from scratch." Dean explained.
"Get that dog!" Eustace's mother said. Courage screamed and Jack managed to swing at the zombified woman.
Dean and Cas got home at the same time. "Hey, where were you all day besides cleaning the attic?" Dean asked as he kissed Cas hello.
"The one and only. I'm surprised you remember my name. You seem to forget how your mother sacrificed her spirit to cancel out the poltergeist. Don't act so surprised. It's the stuff of legends in the Monster community." Jacob said. "The ghost of Mary Campbell Winchester, murdered by Hell Prince Azazel on November 2nd, 1983. 22 Years later, a family of three moves into the Winchester family home at the same time a poltergeist does, while the oldest daughter of the family that moves in sees the fiery ghost of Mary Winchester in her closet, as her mother had her take what was once Sam Winchester's nursery. With help from you, Sam and medium Missouri Moseley, you first tried to cleanse the house of the poltergeist but it didn't work. So you and Sam stayed behind just in case something went wrong, and wrong did something go until the ghost in the oldest daughter's bedroom revealed herself to be Mary Winchester, who said one last goodbye to her two boys before chasing after the poltergeist, saving her sons and the family living in that house. My mom and I heard that story echoing through our heads when Eve was revived and my mom repeated that story when I got sick, as a justification as to why she was sacrificing her morals to save me." Jacob said. Dean started to develop a lump in his throat. "My mom may be alive, but I missed a lot of milestones with her, Dean. And I want you to pay." He said as he was about to take a swing. Suddenly though, his hand was pulled back by a cord.
"Great to have you back, man." Suddenly, Ezekiel was back in charge of Sam's body and gave him the straight up facts.
"Oh Dean, so good." Cas groaned as Dean thrust sharper, picking his pace up a bit faster now. No sooner after they started though, were they close to orgasm. Dean pushed into Cas deeply before coming inside him hard. Hitting Cas's prostate, Cas screamed out, resulting in his grace illuminating the house. No glass broken, Cas and Dean made sure there were no broken bulbs. Afterwards, Cas was worn out completely.
"I promise I love you. You'll fly and see again." Sam read aloud and handed it back to Cas. "That's Dean's handwriting." Sam said.
"Hi, we brought a flambeed plum dish." Sam said. "I thought we could use a healthy dessert as well as a cake and stuff that you two would be making." Sam explained to Mary and Dean.
"Yep, you're Polish. Balthazar sent us into this mess because an Angel in Raphael's regime has been sent to kill us. Speaking of, we better find Cas's actor. Last time I was here, the Angel thought he was really Cas and he was gutted for some stupid ritual." Dean said. As soon as he left the trailer, he smacked right into Misha.
"I come with one too, pal. This man is protected and is NOT Castiel." Dean said as he slammed his hand on the sigil, making the Angel disappear. Misha looked at Dean and back at where the Angel stood and was bewildered.
“I can’t help it, you’re so ticklish, it makes me feel alive.” Dean purred as he kissed Cas’s chest. Cas moaned before arching his back as Dean stroked his groin. Dean crawled back up to Cas and they began to undress each other.
"Hey, handsome. Care to pull out some butter so I can make honey butter for the French toast?" Cas asked as he walked over to Dean and kissed him.
"I know, but we're way past it. The plan's too far gone to stop it from happening." Dean sighed sadly. "I have to do this, to make sure you're safe. To keep the whole world safe and to stop this bitter war with Raphael." Cas said as he looked up towards Raphael.
"We took care of them together. We hunted all of them after we ended up in Purgatory following the killing of Dick Roman. Then we took the portal with that vampire friend of yours, Benny. Sam and I sensed something off about Metatron some time later when we met him, and I kicked his and Naomi's asses." Cas said.
"I've brought you the blood of a Demon's vessel. He was breaking contracts before they were due with "loopholes". Was even gonna do a poor Wincestie named Becky dirty by selling her a potion that brainwashed Sam into falling love with her. I took care of that guy and don't worry, I've asked Crowley for his blood. I'll owe him a favor when I get back to my timepoint." Dean explained.
"As soon as I was back. But I was sure to have him call his fiancee before he completely went. He then revived him." Emma said.
"I am, I promise." Dean cooed. He then took three viles, one of which he filled with Cas's blood. "I'm from the future. I'm gonna make a blade that can kill Leviathans. Trust me, it must be made." Dean said. "I'll come back for you when you've turned into a God." He then kissed Cas on the lips, which made Cas stop in his tracks. Meanwhile, Dean needed to get to the Ghostfacers to help him find the body of a righteous nun, the same nun Sam and he had used the first time they'd made this blade. He didn't have too much time though, as Cas was gonna absorb those souls in a few hours. The clock was ticking.
"You love him, I can smell it. You've mated with this Angel in your point of the timeline." The Alpha vampire smiled as he filled the vial meant for his blood with it. "Good luck on your courtship, I remember what it's like to be in love and it's a fuzzy, dizzy feeling." Dean nodded and went to see if the idiots had gotten the bone.
"Hey, l'il lady." One Skinwalker, as they called themselves, said to her. "Name's Shadow. You're definitely not a Skinwalker, so we're gonna call you Slick due to you being new. Wanna play with us?" Shadow asked. Miracle obliged until she met a Familiar. Meanwhile, said Familiar's owner sat down next to Emma to monitor her, keeping an even closer eye on Miracle. But not before striking an introduction to Emma.
"Oh no you don't, bitch." Dean growled as he pulled April off of Cas, then stabbed her with Cas's blade. They were too distracted with April to see Barbara sneak off into the night and Cas started gasping for air.
When Cas had returned from his mission with Hannah, he found an Obsidian blackbird and a note attached.
When Sam and Jess had left, Cas was cleaning up and putting food away. Dean had decided to help after cleaning the grill. However, his help was beyond drying while Cas washed.
They wound up at Bobby's. Cas was still out of it, so Jimmy Novak temporarily had control of his body again.
Dean and Bobby quickly bought breaded pickle chips and summoned Death and asked him what had happened. Crowley was just as confused.
"With Crowley. We've only been hitting karaoke bars. A benefit of being a Knight of Hell is being able to hold your liquor and I faked getting in a bar fight and singing offkey to find you." Dean confessed.
"It's okay, honey. Come on, I'll treat you to a slice of pie." Dean said as he ordered a slice of Gabriel's best pie on his pastry menu and Gabriel offered a steak and kidney pie for Miracle's dessert. All was calm once again in Miracle's life.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Can you remove the tape from Cas's mouth?" Dean asked. Gabriel agreed apologetically and Dean went to Cas to make sure he was okay.
A few hours later, Meg had gotten back to her station hut when someone was sitting in her furnishing. "Been a long time, sister." A deep voice said.
"So Dean, I hear you accepted a version of me from a universe where you and Sam were never born." Michael said.
"I'll stay." Cas said, and so did Dean at the end of the night, when Dean's shift had finished and he was too tired to get home. When Dean came back to Cas, he got in bed with him and they cuddled. There was no place either wanted to be right then and there.
"I did hear that bloodstone can transfer power from one being to the other, but I didn't know-" Cas was about to get up, but he instantly fell. "Whoa. I feel a bit dizzy." Cas said.
"I don't know, I haven't seen them in three months. But I have written them letters. Though I haven't gotten letters back, the King and Queen I stayed with weren't all that kind to me." Dean said.
"They always throw fears like that at new servants. I think it's barbaric myself, but you can't tell Father. Oh brother, you MUST try the rice porridge Dean makes." Samandriel said and Cas looked over into the kitchen.
"I'm a Nephilim. I was born to a woman named Kelly and the fallen archangel Lucifer, who ended up being right about God." Jack started. "But when Dean, Sam and Castiel told my mom that my father infiltrated a congressman hoping to become President of the United States, she had to hide with Castiel. He then fought at all costs to protect me. But Mom died while giving birth to me and at that same time, Lucifer killed Castiel and Sam found me hiding beside my crib. We locked eyes, then Dean began to shoot at me. I don't blame him, he was in pain after Castiel was murdered by my birthfather. Meanwhile, Mary tackled my birthfather into a version of Earth from which a portal opened just as I was born, where Sam and Dean were never born and the apocalypse decimated half the planet."
Michael's Archangel blade had a beautiful shape. It was regal, had a green hue to it. And though Castiel was interested, he wasn't an Archangel. He wasn't even a seraph. But still, somehow.
"You can say that." Cas said as he helped Dean off of Blade. "Garth, I'd like you to meet my betrothed, Dean of Winchester."
“That’s true.” Sam replied. Suddenly, Dean’s phone was calling and Lucifer, once again in Cas’s body, appeared.
"I even asked her to conjure up a monster to get Muriel to talk after Eustace insulted her for the last time." Courage said.
"Thank you for today, Dean." Cas said as he and Dean felt each other. Cas touched Dean's bicep and the burn he once placed there reappeared instantly as they made out. Cas slowly pressed Dean to the mattress shortly after and Dean felt as Cas flipped them over and stretched him out.
"I'm gonna make you come so hard, the eastern seaboard will hear you." Cas husked into Dean's ear, making Dean swallow harder than when Lydia had told him Emma was "his problem now", her words. Cas then and there, turned the tables and started slamming into Dean after pulling out his fingers. Dean gasped and started making small grunting sounds, while Cas explored his body with his hands. Dean did the same, roaming them in Cas's hair, his back, he dipped a still-butter-coated finger into Cas's asshole and it made Cas roar with pleasure. He then began thrusting even harder, making Dean make even more noise. It wasn't long before they both climaxed, Cas buried so deep into Dean, he screamed louder than the time he got scared after a cat popped up out of nowhere. Cas pulled out once he had come and they lay together after.
"NO!" He cried as he ran in to save his black mini-horse his mother had made him when she knew she was heavy with him. "Please, it's my coping mechanism. I need it." He pleaded, only to be hackhanded.
"Castiel, my son. Lucifer, so glad you could make it. You may go back to the kitchen, Dean." Charles said as Dean left the orderves out in the foyer as Charles walked the two men further into the castle before retreating to the castle. "I would hope your trip was fruitful coming over." Charles asked.
"It's fine, Jack. I'm fine. I mean, I'm not, but it's not your fault." Dean assured him. "It has been hard since everything happened. I miss him deeply."
Cas watched as the jeweler carefully cut the face off of the amulet and applied two bloodstone gems for eyes and made a red mouth out of the garnet, carefully fitting it all inside. "So how did you meet?" The Jeweler asked, making small talk as he did his job.
The chair beneath Dean creaked under the pull. His spine popped in multiple places, and he gasped from the pain of being tugged in two directions. But the demoness didn't kill him.
The touch on his shoulders shifted. Hands made their way toward the center of Castiel’s chest. The press of Dean’s palms was harsh and hot. Fingers landed on his tie, and Cas wondered at how he could have forgotten about that item. It still needed to be removed—that’s all Dean was doing. But then those fingers wrapped around the fabric, and those demanding hands tugged Cas forward. Dean leaned in, lowering his head. He shifted his body, now sitting on Castiel’s lap with his legs on either side. The position lit a fire in Cas’s brain. He didn’t know what it meant, but he knew that it meant something. The tie tightened, almost to the point of choking. He felt breath from Dean’s parted lips, and his own mouth sagged open.
“What in the hell happened, friend?” It was the man with the deeper voice. Cas blinked up. The stranger was young, mid-twenties, with dark hair under an Irish-style cap, light blue eyes that conveyed only worry, and a face covered in black dirt. He looked human.
Something must have triggered a call for his grace. This was an involuntary reaction. It felt like being woken from a nightmare, falling out of bed, and trying to walk on legs that had been amputated.
Sam arrived gasping on all fours, trembling and overwhelmed by adrenaline. His eyes needed several blinks to remember how to process information, at first there was just ‘green’ and ‘gray’ and ‘brown.’ But then it was grass and dirt, soot and clouds. A forest. Some kind of factory in the distance, maybe? The air bit at his skin with its chill. Sam pushed up to standing and noticed a dirt road not far off. This must have been where Gabriel hid Cas and Dean. Sam had to find them. But… he could wait a minute to see if Gabriel would follow.
Cas turned his head. “I’m alive,” he replied with a touch of regret. He craned his neck and looked over his shoulder. Mud covered Dean’s boots and the bottom of his jeans. The hunter’s shirt didn’t have any new rips or blood. Cas didn’t gaze any higher. Dean didn’t want to see his eyes, and heeding that wish was the one thing Cas could still offer.
Dean cursed, “Fuck you, bitch,” and he gripped his thumb as tight as he could. His anger helped ground him to his own reality, even though he was blind to his environment as long as she was broadcasting hers to his brain. He saw the demoness peel Cas from his shirt. He heard Cas cry out in pain then bite back his screams. He saw the likeness of his own hand touch Cas’s naked shoulder, and Dean could hardly think beyond his fury. He gripped his thumb, imagined it was the demonesses neck, and he squeezed and pulled in one hard, fluid jerk. The pain lancing through his arm told him that he’d definitely, savagely broken his thumb. He laughed, victorious.
The door to the shack opened. Cas didn’t turn around. If it was the succubus, so be it. If it was Dean, Cas didn’t have the right to face him.
getting better,” she repeated. “Now I really can’t wait to play with Feathers! Of course, this changes my strategy.” She stood and leaned against the torture table. “Have you fucked him already, or are you just pent-up and pining for him?”
A noise from beneath the table indicated the hunter was there and rousing clumsily with ragged breath.
Dean’s legs gave out, and he found himself on his knees beneath the front window of the doctor’s house. He sank back against the rough wood and shut his eyes.
God, the sound was painful. It cut straight through his chest. And where was Dean now? Cas rolled his head left to right, and though pain lanced through his body when he moved he couldn’t help himself from searching. He looked up and down but there was no sign of Doc or Jamie or any other soul.
Cas fought not to look up. Often, Dean’s eyes spoke truths that his words did not or could not. Maybe the mystery command would be solved if he could see the emotion behind the man’s green gaze. But without that context, Cas was forced to ask, “What?”
If you like angsty, sexy books, (which I know you do. You're here aren't, you? hehe), I have several on Amazon!
Dean shook his head. The demoness had cut Castiel down, let him fall like a sack of bricks and lay in his blood.
