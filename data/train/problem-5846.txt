Jan dropped Steve’s reply directly into Tony’s hands, but he set it down onto the table, too frightened to open it, too afraid that Steve would expect something, and Tony wouldn’t be able to live up to it. He wanted desperately for it to say, ‘Dear Tony, I’m looking for you in a mate,’ but he knew that was childish. His life wasn’t a romance novel. This was real life, and real life was messy and difficult and… and had real consequences. Like being destitute or marrying a philanderer and his scummy father.
Instead of continuing to argue (Tony was delicate right now, it might hurt him too much to lose), she fussed with his carpet bags. “I’m putting lacy stuff on top of you, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble breathing.”
Jarvis couldn’t help a fond laugh. “You really don’t need to write these down immediately, Anthony. I’d repeat it for you later.”
“Oh, um.” Tony looked down at his feet, then back up at Steve. “That sounds fantastic, actually.” He glanced back at the wagon, frowning. “Will my things be alright?”
He turned around sharply, putting his back to the trunk to see who had spoken to him. He swallowed thickly as he looked up at the alpha, forcing himself not to wring his hands. He wouldn’t show he was nervous at all. “I-I’m fine!” he assured the alpha.
“What if it doesn’t rise again?” Tony asked worriedly. He’d had that problem with the first batch. He hadn’t proofed his yeast properly. He wouldn’t make that mistake again. But what if by some miracle he
“No,” Steve choked out, startled, and Tony couldn’t help a slightly hysterical laugh at the horrified expression on his face.
Obadiah had ruined everything he’d ever hoped and planned for. He’d even ruined Tony’s planned escape to Steve.
Tony reached out with shaking fingers to pull the false bottom out of the drawer and draw Steve’s letters out, too. His eyes trailed over the looping scrawl again and again. Steve was so earnest, all those
Then there was the rattle of keys and the sound of his trunk being unlocked before Jan cried, “Tony!” and began digging through her clothes for him.
your fiancée. I don’t want to marry you.” He was Steve’s fiancée and no one else’s. Especially not Ezekiel’s.
Tony took a moment to mourn the fact that the lacy negligee wasn’t for him, nor the pretty satin robe and petticoat on her other dress forms. “That’s not what I’m worried about.”
Tony brought his hand to his mouth, teeth biting into his knuckles. The little scrap of paper had no right to be so cute and unassuming after how heavy the letter had been. Being alone all day and considering children—he didn’t even know what Steve looked like. Maybe he was repulsive. Maybe he was small and had scars all over and one eye and what sort of alpha liked lemon chiffon yellow? Alphas should like red, or—or royal blue, or—not lemon chiffon!
Tony opened his mouth, then shut it again, peering up at the man with a frown. The alpha looked sincere enough, he supposed, and… it
Tony was quiet as he thought about it. He supposed it made sense; it fit the story without being an outright lie, and without giving too much information away. He might not have been
“Really,” Ana replied, smiling. “I flirted. I up sold. I assured him that the olive green went with his skin tone and the salmon pink highlighted his eyes. I used every compliment I knew—and a few I made up on the spot. Edwin kept looking at this silver and blue tie, but I insisted. The green and salmon. The shop owner got tired of watching me, and once he was gone, Edwin told me he’d take the tie, but only if I agreed to go on a date with him. He was charming, and so handsome, and my mother always told me I was much too reckless. So I agreed.
Jarvis let out a snarl but ducked his head, gripping his hands into fists so tight that his nails cut into his palms. “There must be
“He said that he bought a tie from her in Budapest and immediately fell in love with her,” Tony replied, trailing his finger around the rim of his glass before plucking out a slice of orange. “The way Ana tells it, she saw this tall Englishman and thought his accent was cute when he tried to say ‘thank you’ in Hungarian.”
“Thank you. It’s a secret engagement at this point though,” Tony admitted. “So, um–please don’t tell anyone.”
Victor looked embarrassed as he tried to shrug it off. “I’m glad I could help,” he said softly, apparently unable to dodge his thanks anymore.
Tony jerked when he recalled what Jan had said. “Wait. What do you mean, by the end of this trip? Are—are we actually going to Maine?”
Jarvis smiled a little, not turning from the dough, allowing her the privacy to get her bearings again. “You gave that back to him, you know. Not me, not Jan, not even Steven—you’re the one who suggested writing letters. You gave him his freedom again.”
He flinched as the trunk was slammed shut, yelping into his hands again when it was tossed carelessly back into the car. Luckily it couldn’t be heard over the sound of Vernon yelling, “Get her to the station
“Please, I just—need to get this out,” Tony cut in, looking back up at him with all the regret he could muster. He was pretty sure he only had the strength to say it once. He’d never had to, before. Everyone in New York had come to know his circumstances through the grapevine, after all.
Tony nodded, pushing it to the back of his mind. He hated to ask Jan for anything, even though he knew she would willingly hand over anything he asked for. It made him feel like he was taking advantage of her, even though he knew that if the roles were reversed, he would give Jan anything she needed as well. He would try this first, without having to depend on her generosity. She’d always said he was stubborn and independent to a fault, so he was really only living up to her expectations by doing this.
Instead, he focused on mechanically opening the other letters, reading them, setting them aside in piles for continued correspondence or piles for sympathetic apologies saying, ‘I feel we’re not a good match.’ There were plenty of other alphas and betas who were kind enough to him. He had options to fall back on.
Tony glanced at the drawing again as he readied his pen for another letter, feeling ever so slightly guilty for his fib in the last one, when he’d claimed to be under the weather to get out of having to be entirely polite. He’d just have to be extra sweet this time.
“Good luck,” Tony told her, amused, and lifted the champagne flutes. “Well! Can’t say you skimped on the giggles, Susan.”
“Just for this, I’m making dinner tomorrow,” Ana sniffed. She turned to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Goodnight, Anthony,” she said gently, before sticking her nose up in the air and strutting out of the room.
“Someone has to cry for you, when you have no tears left to cry for yourself,” Jan told him, and leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead.
Jan had wanted to give him something bigger, something with meat and cheese to ‘get him through the trip.’ Tony would forever remember the crushed look on her face when he’d told her that he knew hunger and would prefer not to be given anything at all, nerves tying his stomach in knots along with the fear of having to relieve himself and being unable to. The half-full thermos of water and the cucumber sandwich had been a compromise. And Tony would never admit it to Jan, but once some of the terror bled off and hope was fluttering bright and high in his chest, he was starving.
Tony frowned down at his blank stationery for a long moment before lifting his pen, whispering a soft, almost embarrassed, “Dear Steve.” He hesitated, then set the letter aside again. He had to think a little more, even though he was pretty sure of his answer. Perhaps he’d come up with the words he needed as he thought about it. He reached out for the book Jarvis had brought him instead, flipping it open to the first page.
“Tony,” Ana said gently, reaching out to put her hand on his shoulder. “Please, take it from me. It’s not childish to run away from what’s causing you harm.”
“I think it’s sort of unfair, that I’d get to have my family and friends at the church, and you didn’t,” Steve admitted after a moment. “So I thought we might have a quick ceremony now, and then later, when you could invite your friends and family, we’d have a big celebration. It’s already unfair enough that you had to leave everything and everyone behind. I’m sure everyone here will understand once I explain it to them.” His mouth quirked up into a wry smile. “Besides, Bucky isn’t back from taking the herd to market. He’d never forgive me if I had my big wedding without him standing at my side as best man.”
Greer nodded, taking another bite of her apple. “Hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but you must be on the train a long time if you’re in the Pullman car, right? That’s a long time with nothing to do. My father gave me an entire carpet bag filled with books. Yeah,” she added with a grin at Tony’s appalled expression. “The porters hate me. Anyway, I have all these books, right? And you’ve got nothing to do. Maybe you can help me and do the porters a favor at the same time. You want a couple books?”
“The picture,” Steve repeated softly in confusion, brows furrowing together, before his face went bright red at the realization. “Oh. The picture the kids drew. Ah. Yes, well, the shape was about right, though.”
They ate in silence, and it wasn’t awkward, but… it was tense. Tony was mulling over his remaining options (frighteningly few, and most of them dramatic), and Jarvis was cutting his bacon, eggs, and toast into teeny tiny pieces and chewing on them way too long for what he’d cut them down to. Ana let them sit in silence, instead writing a few extra groceries onto her list—honey, first and foremost, because her husband would probably continue to make Tony tea, and Tony would continue to love her husband too much to say anything about it.
He was so wrapped up in thinking that he almost missed Steve’s sharp intake of breath. He remembered with sudden clarity how frank he’d been in the letter and couldn’t help flushing in embarrassment. Maybe he’d been
“Oh, no,” Samantha answered quickly. “I wasn’t cleaning–just delivering Miss Jan’s correspondence. I hear you’re engaged,” she added in a whisper, leaning in. “I just want to say–I’m very happy for you, sir. The Stanes—well. Servants talk. Even if only half of it’s true…” She looked incredibly uncomfortable. “I’m very,
“My name is Anthony St—ah,” Tony cut himself off. “Um. I actually prefer Tony. I’m Tony… von Doom?” The name felt strange on his tongue. It was one thing to put that on a telegram to cause confusion if anyone came looking for him, but quite another to introduce himself to another person like that. Victor had looked unbothered by the idea when Jan had suggested it though (had actually looked rather pleased with her idea), so he figured the fib wasn’t too bad.
“You’ve always been so brave,” Jan whispered, and leaned their heads together again. “I hope you’ll be happy, Tony.”
“Oh! Please be gentle with my trunks! Someone’s already cracked my dress form!” Jan said, not sounding even slightly upset like she had when she’d been stopped outside her home.
Tony left the letter in Jan’s hands and turned with a sob to curl up against Jarvis’s chest instead. “Jarvis-!”
Tony started work on his correspondence immediately after supper, because he had quite a lot of letters to write already, and Ana had said she’d pick up a matrimony magazine when she went out the next day. He curled up under a blanket on the couch in the den, in front of the fire Jarvis had built. The large mansion had always seemed to have a chill upon it after his parents had died. It was warmer in here, with his family, where Jarvis was going over household accounts for Obadiah to pay (and padding what he could for extra spending money for Tony), and Ana was reading a pocket novel she’d picked up while grocery shopping.
Ana slid her hands from his shoulders down to his biceps and gently placed her head on his shoulder with a sad sigh. “I’m sorry, Edwin.”
The hotel dining room was small but elegant, at least as much as it could be: clean white tablecloths, fresh flowers as table decorations, and polished silver. The wainscoting could stand to be repainted, and the paintings were somewhat faded from the sun, but Tony couldn’t be anything but charmed as he looked around, carefully setting himself down into the seat that Steve had pulled out for him.
“You wouldn’t get caught,” Tony scoffed, but frowned at her anyway. “Does Hank have a friend in town I could hang off of for the night? What about that one friend, what is his name–”
“We’re not really working out,” Tony admitted softly. “I think he knows it too. I feel kind of bad because he really was sweet.”
“I-? Think Doom’s trying to help you?” she squeaked back, sounding mostly confused but also slightly, cautiously, optimistic.
Jan pursed her lips at him, entirely unamused, then opened the telegram to read it. “Honestly, Tony, it’s not that funny—” She stopped, frowning in confusion, before reaching out and grabbing his wrist. “Tony.”
They didn’t make it very far, but then, Tony hadn’t really expected them to. Obadiah had probably already had a handful of crooked cops in his pocket even before Tony fled his home with the Jarvises and hidden out at the Van Dyne estate. Obadiah was probably saying something about an omega who had run away from home, who he was “so afraid” for because he had no money, had probably even told them that he was being manipulated and held against his will. Of course they were going to search any vehicle coming out from or going into Jan’s house.
Tony looked up at him, opening his mouth to say something, but he had no idea what. He looked back down at Steve’s letter, closing his mouth, and reached out for it, taking it carefully in two hands. Such an unassuming piece of paper had no right to hold his future so precariously inside of it.
“Ah,” Tony began, then sighed, shoulders sagging. “Yes, I suppose that would be best,” he agreed, because it wouldn’t be fair to have Steve marry him without all of the facts. He’d been hesitant to divulge all of them in a letter, which could be taken out of context or even be stolen and taken back to Obadiah. Steve deserved to know everything before he married him.
Tony hummed agreeably, laying his head on his arms as he thought about his parents. They’d met in Italy, when Howard had been cheeky, and Maria had been unimpressed. Howard had sworn that he would impress her. Maria had promised that nothing he did would. And then six months later they’d gotten married. Maria had told stories about their courtship. Howard was apparently the typical blockhead alpha, but in the moments where he was soft and sweet, she fell in love with him.
Tony blinked up at him, curious as to what else he might add to a letter beyond Steve’s favorite dessert. “Yes?”
“Tony,” Jan barked, but he couldn’t understand what she said next because the driver was laughing so hard.
Tony reread Steve’s last letter, frowning. He could… he could be a companion. He could be someone to talk to, someone to come home to. Steve wouldn’t need to spend each night alone, watching the prairie. He had lots to talk about. His parents had always laughed about how he could have a conversation with himself, too, so if Steve were ever too tired to talk, Tony could… talk for the both of them.
Victor stared at her for a very, very long time before he said, “But—it is. I remember. You were one of the first people who wasn’t intimidated by me, so I remember when we were introduced.”
Then he began a letter to Jan, detailing how his journey after they’d separated had been going. Fair, he’d decided, but did not do her the disservice of lying and saying he wasn’t afraid. She’d held him as he cried the last few days, after all, and he’d even admitted he was scared to her out loud. They’d never had any secrets from each other, anyway, growing up. He wasn’t going to start having them now.
Jan scowled back at him. “Don’t throw this back on me! As if I saw you enough to take you aside and tell you that you had my name wrong! You were always surrounded by alphas trying to catch your eye and I didn’t want to embarrass you in front of them. Omegas need to stick together, after all.”
“Yes, but then I’d have to break you out of jail, and then we’d both be fugitives. I can’t imagine Steve would want to marry a fugitive.”
“Just a few of your mother’s things that I was able to hide from Obadiah. Your father’s favorite book. The book on gardening you were taking the most notes about.”
“What?!” Jan exclaimed, affronted, but quickly fell concerned when she saw how truly miserable her friend was. She softened her voice to ask, “Why not?”
to be lonely. Steve, an artist, an alpha who liked lemon chiffon yellow and didn’t mind that Tony didn’t know how to do everything he necessarily needed to for life on the ranch.
He could hear Jan ranting and raving as they opened the doors to pull the trunks from her motorcar, screeching about how she would be late and look here, if she missed her train they’d be hearing from her lawyers. Tony was reluctantly amused by how her voice raised in pitch when one of the cops yelped and dropped something, screeching, “If you damage my dress form, I will murder you where you stand! Daddy!
. Tony got the impression that he was kind. He wasn’t so sure about this… swearing problem that Steve had, but… he supposed if he got kicked by a steer, he’d swear a lot too.
Tony fiddled with the ads again, shoulders hunching. There were so many things he wanted to say, but… none of it really mattered, did it? His parents were dead, and Obadiah had control of all of his money, and there was nothing he or Jarvis or Ana could do about it.
“I wish I was an alpha for you,” Jan whispered helplessly. “Or that I could use my money to help you. But I can’t. My father already told me not to get involved, that it would just make things worse for you.”
Hank entered a few moments later, looking quite put out. “Jan, I didn’t know you had a friend with you. I’ll leave—”
Jan dashed back into the room, dressed in a beautiful light blue dress with a pretty dark blue peacoat with a cinched waist. “Alright! I’m ready!”
Tony grimaced and folded his arms on the table, shoving his face into them as he mumbled, “Tiberius Stone.”
Tony shrugged a little, helpless, because growing up he’d always known that Jarvis had not been ‘just a butler,’ but that had also been the only way he’d referred to himself. “I’m not entirely sure how they met or how the relationship ended it up as it did. I know that my father rescued both Jarvis and his wife from Hungary during a war somehow, and Jarvis remained loyal to him thereafter. They’d always taken care of us, and when my parents died, he and his wife just… continued taking care of me.”
“And I’ll speak to the maids,” Jan added, frowning. “Most of the gossip I overhear is how disgusting it is that Tony has to do this though, so I think they might understand.”
“It’s a bit of a trip; it’s just outside of Santa Fe,” Jim added as they pulled up to the ticket window. “You’ll probably want a Pullman car.”
Ana continued to frown at him until she lost the battle to keep a straight face in response to his giggling, instead smiling wryly as both Tony and Jarvis finally relaxed, even if it was only a little. “Have fun at Ms. Van Dyne’s, Tony.”
“Will you need a driver today, sir?” Jarvis asked, trying to pretend he wasn’t glancing at his wife in concern and failing miserably.
Tony frowned, pulling his finger out of his mouth just long enough to mumble, “I wouldn’t want to put Hank out…”
Tony curled his hands into fists, staring down at his lap. If only he’d known before what was going to happen, he could have requested Jarvis be the guardian of his finances. But Obadiah had been clever, had waited until he had complete control and was personally enmeshed in the business dealings he’d been doing with Tony’s money, to show his true colors. Tony had been a fool.
Tony’s smile went watery. “I doubt you tackling Ezekiel to the floor and strangling him with your belt would make my life easier, Jan.”
“I–I–S-Susan is expecting me,” Tony said, voice shaking, and tried to pull away, but the alpha’s grip tightened so much it started to hurt. “Mm-!”
“I escaped New York by hiding in a trunk in the luggage compartment, if that’s any indication about how dire the situation was. I sent the telegram to you on a stop where I changed trains to get to Chicago instead of Maine. And I know—I know Obadiah will take it as a personal affront that he couldn’t control me, so I doubt he’ll stop looking for me. I just want… want you to be prepared. If Obadiah finds me here and tries to force me to go home.” Tony sucked in a shuddering breath. “I know that can be a deal breaker, an angry guardian coming for his ward, but—”
Ana helpfully dropped a spoonful of honey into his cup. She knew that Tony didn’t like tea but could stand it with a touch of honey.
Tony tipped his head, acknowledging. “Well, I’m sure whoever it was you threw deserved it,” he decided after a moment. Then he smiled at Jim again. “Thank you for your help, Jim. I appreciate it.”
“Ana!” Jarvis gasped, scandalized, as his wife began to laugh, then turned to Tony sharply. “You are not riling anybody up, young man!”
Steve was big, and broad, with shoulders that went on for miles, and his hair was on the longer side, like he was just on the cusp of needing a haircut. His skin was surprisingly pale—he’d thought Steve might be a little tanner, being out on the range so often, or out doing manual labor in the hot, southern sun. He had freckles, though, and they were very cute, spattering across his nose like he’d sneezed over a cinnamon cake. He had a beard, too, which seemed incredibly foreign to Tony; a beard meant you were too poor to afford a razor in New York, so almost every alpha had had clean-shaven faces. Somehow, Tony thought the beard suited him.
“S-sir,” the officer replied, and Tony swallowed back another yelp when they yanked their hand back and nearly tore his shirt off with it.
“I’m not afraid of Jan,” Ezekiel replied blithely, advancing on him again. He grabbed Tony’s elbow to keep him from backing away. “How about a dance, Tony?”
“Yes,” Tony agreed, turning in front of her full-length mirror to examine how he looked in the sharp jacket she’d designed in apple green. Not a great color on him, he lamented, but the shape of the jacket was superb.
“…Mm,” Susan agreed after a moment. “That’s true. Make sure to get a good look at Raven’s dress! She’s done something with charmeuse, and I want your opinion on whether or not I can pull it off.”
“Once you have bread perfected, you can make mostly anything with it,” Jarvis said, cutting through his thoughts, and Tony focused on kneading again. “Pot pie crusts, rolls, soft pretzels… You can make a slurry of cinnamon and sugar and make cinnamon rolls…”
Jan handed her champagne flute to him and flounced off immediately, gleeful. Tony watched her go fondly.
“I need to be alone,” Tony answered immediately, and fled to the sounds of Jarvis, Ana, and Jan calling after him worriedly.
Tony sipped at his tea for a few minutes, watching Jan as she fussed and muttered under her breath, expression growing darker and darker with each trunk. Then he turned to Victor and asked, “Why do you call her that, anyway?”
“Baby,” Ana teased again, then pulled the pillow up just enough to press a kiss to his forehead. “Rest, dear.”
He tried not to think about how Steve actually had become dear to him in such a short time, and how that might look to other people. Every time he thought about it, he remembered ‘this is too fast’ and ‘what if I seem too eager.’ He comforted himself with the knowledge that Steve had started it, with his ‘dear Tony’s and ‘sincerely’s. If nothing else, Steve would not be put off by that.
Tony couldn’t help going a little teary eyed. He and Hank got along alright, but it was definitely one of those ‘he’s courting my friend’ and ‘he’s the friend of the omega I’m courting’ things. To know that he cared enough to offer this, when Obadiah could do so much to hurt him and his research… Even if he was only doing it because he cared for Jan, it was showing a lot of loyalty. He hoped that Jan hung onto Hank, because even though he was incredibly awkward in formal settings, he was proving how much he’d give for her if only to have the chance to love her.
Obadiah took a deep breath, then let it back out slowly, still looking angry as he scowled at Tony, but a lot less likely to do anything rude. “You’re expected at a party,” he repeated.
“I mean… he shouldn’t have, no, but the face he made when Jan asked him to repeat what he said was funny,” Tony admitted. “I thought all the blood just drained from his body.”
Tony stared at her, uncomprehending, before letting out a mortified groan. “Oh no!” It must have happened when he tried to muffle his yelp after he crushed his sandwich in his hand. He looked down at his hands. They were also covered in mayonnaise. “Oh…”
“A man would be mighty flattered to hear someone call their name like that, Anthony,” Ana pointed out with a grin.
, a small, traitorous part of him whispered. Tony looked down at the scrap of paper and the paint on it again. Yeah. A sweet one.
“I–he’s glad I said yes,” Tony answered after a moment, breathless. His lips began to spread into a wide smile. “He’d be honored to call me his omega.” He laughed a little, helpless, and lifted a hand to wipe the tears forming in his eyes. “He’s going to go shout it to the world that I think he’d be a good mate.”
Steve stared back at him blankly, then said, “I don’t feel used. I don’t feel used at all. You were upfront about your lack of knowledge and skills about working on the range. Someone just trying to escape would lie. All you talked about was wanted to learn.” He paused, frowning, then asked, “That’s not the end of the story though, is it?”
“I… I’m a little embarrassed about how frank I was in it,” Tony admitted. “But I—I think I really do want you to read it.”
“I don’t want to leave you,” Tony whispered helplessly, even though he knew that he didn’t really have a choice.
He waited until he was sure she was gone before he traced his hands over the edges of the envelope, fingering the corners nervously. What if… what if Steve said he had reconsidered? What if he’d found someone with experience in farming or ranching? What… what if he’d found someone with money?
Jim scratched his chin thoughtfully. “Oh, you know, typical small town. Everyone knows everybody. You can only keep a secret if you don’t share it. I’ve only gone for short trips, so I don’t know much about the day-to-day, but somehow I’m always invited to tea with eligible omegas whenever I’m down there and they make the best cake.”
Tony sat up straighter at the thought. “Oh!” That would be nice. Steve might even be pleasantly surprised.
“Do you want me to bring any straggling letters by as they come, or would you prefer if I brought them all together again?” Jan asked, skimming another letter. She wrinkled her nose and set it in the ‘no’ pile.
“No, just… I was looking for something and they don’t have it,” Tony admitted. It would have been a cute joke, showing up with the soap Steve’s mother always used to wash his mouth out with. He tapped his finger against his bottom lip thoughtfully. “Hank? Did your mother ever wash your mouth out with soap?”
Eventually, the leaper reached an alley and spun around, noticing that he’d gotten himself caught in a dead end.
“I don’t Steve, what are you talking about if you’re not talking about the Avengers?” He asked, rubbing his temple with slight frustration. He wasn’t mad at Steve, he was angry at himself for not being able to think of anything else but tragic events in his life, especially when he just wanted to sleep.
He went through everything in his head and it went just as he thought, the enhanced kick from his augmented leg sending two of the men back into the machines, so powerful that their bodies made dents in the machines.
Steve swallowed heavily, his eyes fixed on them and then suddenly Tony turned around, noticing the sound of shifting feet. As soon as he saw that it was Steve, his guard lowered a little. He was just about ready to grab his suit; taking him by surprise was never a wise move. Tony had suffered from post-traumatic stress ever since he was first taken captive, and the following times didn’t help either, resulting in terrible nightmares and extreme paranoia in most cases. Though when he saw Steve standing there, he could swear for a second, the way that the light was shining from behind him with his muscular silhouette blocking the way, that the light formed two large wings behind him. It looked so angelic, so much so that Tony rubbed his eyes in disbelief with the back of his hand. He hadn’t been sleeping well at all, and clearly it was making him delusional.
Tony was famed for his ingenuity and this was a prime example, even as he was at work Peter couldn’t help but be in awe of him. There was a reason this guy was Iron Man.
as he wanted, Tony failed to get enough momentum and his feet were going to collide with the ground.
Immediately he pulled out his director’s badge, mentally preparing himself and then swiping his card through the reader only to see it flash up a red light instead. His eyes narrowed and he swiped it again to see the same beep. Two lab assistants walked toward the door with their expressions promptly overcome by consternation when they who was standing before them.
He placed his hand on the hand brake, pushing it down and drifting the car to do a 180, the smell of burning rubber wafting into the open windows as a puff of smoke was coughed out of the exhaust of the old vehicle, struggling to keep up with Steve’s fast pace.
“Well I suppose it’s trying to—you know, while some sort of blood flows, there’s some sort of function and—“
“No use apologising, the past is the past. I’m a futurist Steve, I thought you would’ve realised that by now.” As annoyed as he was, the feeling of Steve’s soft breath skimming over his cheek made his voice sound softer, it made his heart flutter. Steve was being so touchy today, not that Tony was complaining in the slightest. Maybe today was the day. Maybe it was time to let the super soldier know how he’d felt all this time, throughout all these years. But what was there to say and how would he phrase it?
“There are various blips turning up on the radar, let’s just say this isn’t going to be a walk in the park,” he replied, arms hovering over the screens, glad that he was just in his black under-suit, appreciating the freedom that it gave him to shift attention between monitors.
and now he’s part of our team.” There was resentment hiding behind his words, Steve could definitely pick up on that, especially since there was an annoyed huff that followed once Fury had explained, taking a long puff from the cigar and exhaling a stream of smoke through his nose.  “He needs a new partner.”
It was when he was walking that he had managed to catch his reflection in the glass. Tony had switched it to the one sided mirror so that the engineer could peer through but Steve couldn’t see back, though Steve didn’t know that. All he knew was that he was being given his privacy at that moment but the opaque consistency of the glass allowed the light to reflect off it and thus his reflection was seen.
“You get arrested and you don’t show up again. Honestly Tony, I don’t know. But if you’re a superhero you just… vanish.”
“You’re not supposed to be in here, sir, the area is off limits.” That ‘sir’ came out with a hint of venom. Maria knew she could do a better job as director, she knew it with every fibre of her being. She wasn’t jealous, no, she was seething that Tony Stark of all people would gain that position over her, not when her loyalty to Fury was clearly without boundaries, so much so that she was there looking over a super soldier that was supposed to remain hidden from the public eye. This was one of Fury’s secrets, and Maria held it close to hear heart that Fury would entrust her with such responsibilities. Tony had never been in her good books, but they had a very weak bond of mutual respect for one another, emphasis on the weak.
Steve could feel something skim past his face, ripping the skin in a sharp line. Something distracted him from his meal, and if there was one thing that Tony had learned from Steve even when he was human it was never to disturb him during a meal. He turned his head in the direction of the gunfire to see a cop, standing with his gun pointed at the two. Tony shrugged and continued to eat whilst the gun was pointed at his back. The cop trembled; he wiped the sweat from under his cap and took a couple of unsure steps forward, unable to truly comprehend what was happening in front of his eyes. No matter the amount of zombie shows that people watched, nothing would truly prepare them for the real deal.
Reed searched through the files until he had managed to bring up Steve’s. This, indeed showed just as Tony had said. His neck stretched over to each screen, leaning in closer than necessary to read every single word and calculate every single statistic.
“Look who has managed to rebel against us! Not for long!” The Green Goblin cackled as he revealed himself from beyond the orange smoke, flying around on top the Goblin Glider.
Steve couldn’t have gotten in any quicker, and he drove to Tony’s place with the sirens on his car sounding loudly while he zoomed through the streets. His mind was cluttered with worry and fear, Tony’s voice the other side of the radio was like he’d never heard before; it was filled with fear and had trembled. The only Tony he’d seen was the happy confident one, that sometimes had some self-doubt, but had never fallen so low.
“Osborn!” Steve shouted at the top of his lungs whilst the newly powered reactor in his chest began to fizzle and spark with energy.  His hair soaked, falling over his eyes as he stood with his fists tightly clenched.
“Steve, I’ve missed you… Steve-!” He was cut off by the sharp pain in his neck, making him wince and instinctively wriggle his hips on the other man’s lap. The dark haired man couldn’t help but groan at the sucking he felt on his neck, feeling the heat rise. Steve was relentless, biting and sucking on the same spot until he was sure it was bright red.  “What are you doing..?”
“You know Tony, there is a land free from pain. You just have to fight to get to it, you need to believe with all the strength you have that you can push through it all…”
Tony sighed with relief. “You really are like that comic book character with the stars and stripes…” he mused aloud.
Tony landed back with a loud ‘oomph’ and pure shock taking over his body at the amount of force that was thrown into him, able to floor his suit that hit the white tiles beneath him with a heavy clunk.
By the time he spoke and turned his head, Peter was already up against the tree. The boy had extremely fast reflexes, not to be underestimated. Sometimes Tony forgot that. He joined him by the tree, facing the trunk to try and cover up the light that was emitted from his reactor. The sound of the rapid blades cutting through the air, blowing the dead leaves around sent a chill up Tony’s spine as he held himself closer to the tree, looking up at Peter to make sure that he was hidden much better.
“I can’t do this.” Tony bolted for the door, actually running toward it, long lab-coat fluttering behind him as he tossed it off just before running through the iron-clad doors.
Tony was staring at Steve, looking at him through the screens rather than using the window this time. The faintest of smiles crept along his lips, at least it was a little alleviating to see Steve kept busy, back drawing again. He could’ve sat there for hours on end watching Steve draw lie that, with such talent and such skill, in awe of the beauty not only of the drawing but of the man holding the pen. His silent feelings for the Captain never did and never would subside as much as he tried to resist them, and seeing him in a helpless state only made him yearn for him even more. He made a deal to himself; the second that Steve was out of there he would tell him, he would tell him everything, every single emotion he had felt. From the moment they first met up until now, how he loved and adored Steve with every bone in his body and wanted nothing more than to just grow old with him – and that was saying something for Tony. He was a man that secretly wanted to commit, but failed to do so since the loss of Rumiko (the one woman he was so close to marrying years ago) and had since been plagued with women who either didn’t want to or had darker intentions. Steve had been one of his longest relationships and they had always seemed closer than friends just friends, who else would he turn to if he couldn’t sleep?
With a loud PING the doors opened and revealed what Steve could only have dreamed of; a whole lab, with thingies and do-hickeys everywhere; pipes and tubes, mechanical pieces, wires and robots wheeling themselves around the place to work on different things.
For a second he could’ve sworn he felt Steve move, but he knew that he was still under the coma, perhaps it was wishful thinking. He pulled his lips back, but remained not even an inch away, huffing with relief, smiling for the first time in days.
Tony was soothed by the usual sounds of Steve’s breath, the slump of his chest and sometimes if he had continently rolled to close to him; the beating of his heart, the gentle drum that would remind him that the man was there watching over him.
“JARVIS?” He tapped his helmet, but again there was nothing but static. He cursed the use of jammers that must have been located around the facility. It was no use trying to communicate with the others. If his connection was blocked, there was certainly no getting through to the others.
Tony held his hand to his mouth, not so discreetly whispering to Steve, “This feels like the guy you’re supposed to beat before you go onto a boss battle in video games.”
, but the world wasn’t ready for him either. That was at least what Fury was telling himself as justification for keeping Steve locked within the chasms of his memories.  It let him sleep better at night, as if he got a single wink – not when he had the constant threats of the world to deal with and secure, while his top notch weapon rest at bay, recharging until the day that it would be ready to save the world once again. If he ever saw fit to do so. If ever. He wasn’t being selfish in detaining him, he was protecting him.
“I’ll deal with him, maybe I’ll get some answers,” Tony said. Never in a million years did he ever think that he’d be co-operating with the people that tried to kill him, but desperate times called for desperate measures. Even if he had a vendetta against Crossbones in particular, if he was helping then he would take the help. Right now he was alone asides from the man he held in his arms who was in dire need of some care, so any ally was a good ally. “He’s in that huge tower, the one I’m supposed to get to anyway, right?”
Tony smiled back at him shyly. He thought, in different circumstances, they might have been very good friends. Maybe they still could be, in the future. Maybe once he’d been married to Steve long enough that Obadiah couldn’t contest the marriage, he could chance sending people letters. Maybe Victor wouldn’t mind corresponding with him.
Ezekiel came to hover next to him, pretty sure that if he tried to pass into Tony’s room without permission, Jarvis would happily gut him.
“I can tell. It’s just… you’re one of the few people who has said that to me. Oh, people might have whispered it behind their hands at some point, sure,” he added when it looked like Steve didn’t believe him. “But no one wanted to portray themselves as going against Obadiah. He’s very powerful back in New York.” He swallowed thickly. “And he has an alpha son.”
“Spoken like someone who Jan has knocked down,” Tony answered, smiling reluctantly, and the beta laughed. “Will I be in your way if I stay here?”
“Stane wouldn’t dare cross me and mine,” Vernon said sharply from the doorway, making the younger alpha yelp. “Anthony, Janet, come inside at once before you catch cold.”
Tony swallowed thickly. He wanted to stay in New York. He knew how New York worked, knew its people. But he would never be able to marry anyone but Ezekiel if he stayed, and he knew that too.
Tony sighed. “The one time your beau could have helped me out and his friend had to go and—ow! Jan!”
“Maybe Ana can find me an inexpensive cookbook while she’s buying herself a new penny novel,” Tony mumbled, frowning.
Jarvis made tea instead of coffee for him. Tony didn’t say anything, because clearly the man was just as upset as he was. He probably should have waited until he had some privacy to cry; crying in front of Jarvis was probably all the answer he needed for the unasked question of ‘is there anything to be done?’
Killgrave should have never been trusted, and it was obvious from day one that Hammer would be nothing more than a pawn in his game of chess.
He took a couple of steps inside to see that all of the pillows and blankets, as well as sheets had been removed from his bed, stripped bare. His eyebrows furrowed and he stepped out of his room, calling out in the hallway for the other Avengers.
The image of the bald man in an ‘I love pumpkin’ t-shirt became more clear. He wore scruffy torn jeans with a chain dangling from the pocket, and looked far too quick for someone of his size. Nonetheless that didn’t stop Carol from approaching him. Tony was glad that they’d stopped so that he could catch his breath but he stared with extreme caution. He was going to aim a repulsor, just in case but Jessica reached over and lowered it mouthing “she knows what she’s doing.”
“That substance you just puked up over my clean floor is what runs through your parts. It’s a tube alongside your veins.”
Instead the nose of snapping twigs caught him, following the sound. Crunching leaves, heavy breaths, someone was running and both Steve and Tony bolted after the noise hoping for a new kill.
He stood by the coffee machine, turning around when he heard the loud greeting that could only be Tony, plodding into the kitchen wearing Steve’s shirt from the night before. Instantly the Captain flushed with an uncontrollable grin.
Steve craned over to take a peek at the screen, blinking when he had noticed what Tony’s index finger was gesturing to.
The memory of Tony in hospital flashed through his mind and how they had to practically jumpstart his heart again; using Thor’s powers and his shield. Though now, they didn’t have Thor’s help. Thor had been absent from Midgard for a long while, and none of them knew why.
“Long journey up…” Natasha replied, staring out of the glass windows and watching as the city began to get smaller and smaller, the shrinking buildings and the even tinier blips that were the drones outside along with tiny explosions where Clint was clearly taking care of the drones.
“The very one. That’s why they were going there... Come on, let’s take this to the chief and prove their innocence!”
“Damsel in distress.” Steve said through clenched teeth, attempting to keep the armour away as it stood with its heels digging into the floor, making an extremely loud screech on the metal tiles below and began to throw its weight into the shield.
“Technically evolution is a science, I’m just saying. Adaptation, survival of the fittest. Charles Darwin. Probably the first lesson you were ever taught throughout genetic engineering.”
“Our home… That was our home, Steve.” He gestured to the rubble, eyes starting to well up at the sight, quickly however his hand raised and swiped the tears before they had a chance to roll down his cheeks.
The hooded figure in the corner crushed the crystal wine glass that was once filled with luxuriously thick red wine in his hand as an annoyed white feline in his lap awoke from its slumber. It padded around in its owner’s lap for a while before glaring over at the floating head.
“You kiddin? We’re goin’ to leave the country at least, but first I wanna pay Baintronics a visit. Show that brainwashed biotch a thing or two about puttin’ a chip in me,” he said, smacking his fist against the palm of his hand. “Then I guess I’ll de-chip the others, for a price.”
“You see, I’ve always wanted to do well in the world and I thought that philanthropy was the best way forward, setting up charities and so on. But that just wasn’t enough; I wanted to be hands on. That’s why I’ve always admired the police department and what they do, the law enforcement and well… Saving the city,
Hank and T’challa both nodded in agreement while they went to get the samples and try their best to replicate them. Tony recalled why exactly he hated this; Steve was extremely protective over his blood, it had the secret to the serum in it. He had been captured and tortured for the serum, having had his blood extracted, the serum being replicated but never to the potential degree that Steve’s was, it was inexplicable. Regardless, Tony followed the others and observed carefully as they began to try and formulate more of Steve’s blood for a transfusion.
“What do you think is behind this, Tony?” Steve asked, looking up. Tony stood in the centre of the round table, where a hole had been cut for him to access his screens. Holographic monitors surrounded him and he tapped from one to the other, blue orbs darting back and forth quickly, lit by the cyan screens.
He felt the gentle rise and fall he was resting on, upon the unscathed skin. He didn’t want to move, not a single inch.
Carol always was wise and had extensive street know-how.  Reluctantly Steve gave the defeated shrug of his shoulder, unable to think of a counter and he couldn’t just blurt out that he was infatuated with the man that was in that argument, and thus his protective nature instinctively wanted to leap in between them and find out what was wrong.
“It can’t have been him…” Jessica said to herself. “Call it a sixth sense; I may not love him but he’s a klutz.”
“So they were his orders? To kill all heroes? So what about all of these people going on killing sprees, killing these heroes, are they under orders too?”
He couldn’t let that dampen his spirits, not when he was sure that he was going to have a great day. Optimism fuelled each step in his polished black shoes.  New York was seen as the Land of Opportunity and it definitely offered just that to the cop.
“Christmas?!” He shouts with shock. The clock slid from his grip and tumbled to the floor whilst Tony could do nothing but stare at the blank space in front of him.
There was a groggy moan from the man now covered in splatters of water and blood ruining the brilliant white that Taskmaster would usually sport.
Tony took the command and raised his hand up, shooting a repulsor ray in that very direction, only to miss.
“Are you trying to tell me that Zola’s made me into some sort of mutant?” His eyes were widened, large blue orbs with quivering shock staring straight through the glass.
Steve made the motion as though he was breathing, his shoulders raised and slumped accordingly but Tony knew not a breath was escaping those cherry red lips.
“Always taking the easy way out.” Steve snarled in return, grimacing at the feeling of the fluid being pumped through his spine once again as it had been periodically.
“An EMP? Product of Latveria? What is this…” Tony stared at the object in his hand and passed it over for JARVIS to analyze, walking toward the elevator and taking it to his lab right away.
“You won Tony. And long before that, you won my heart, and that’s something that you’ll never lose.”
The tear rolled down his cheek onto Steve’s, reaching his hand up to clutch the side of his face, shaking with emotion. His body trembled but still he didn’t move he just needed this more than anything else in the world; he needed Steve.
His knuckles slammed against the metal coat Doom was encased in, it vibrated after the impact and send a loud shudder through Steve’s bones, but mostly it managed to send Doom crashing back into the throne he was sat in. The hit was certainly painful.
Peter sat down and mimicked Tony’s small bounce to test the mattress the other side of the curtain. “Sheets and all. Wow, remind me to tip room service.”
Tony gasped with a look of pure dismay, running up to the window and gesturing to it. “I have a door! Look, door, over there!” He pointed frantically. “Why would you—there’s a door!” He called out after them, even though they wouldn’t hear him.
Tony snapped his teeth before he fired, head falling to one side, body shaking for one last moment before falling still.
Steve glanced back by peering into the wing mirror, seeing the other two cop cars zooming forward, avoiding the obstruction that they’d set before.
“And it looks like we’re going to lose one more.” Clint gestured to Hank by tipping his bow toward him.
“Steve!” Tony yelled over and over, his own hands hitting at the glass before he decided enough was enough. He ran to suit up, putting on the very suit that he had used before, being sure to push through both doors and then into the box itself, rushing up to Steve as quickly as he could to sling his arms around him.
That glimpse of fear along with the words made Steve’s eyes snap back to their usual azure, gently placing Tony back to the ground against the cabinet and turning to Norman silently, sleekly. He drew his shield out and swiftly drew it back.
Steve had never felt anything like this before. It was taking him to a dark place, pulling him back into his darkest and most tragic memories back in the war. His body quaked, trying to fight it. His trance was blurred when he heard Tony yelp out in pain, his hand inching over, slowly toward Tony’s and grabbing it as tightly as he could. His fingers trailed along Tony’s calloused hand, along his knuckles. “We… Can do this… Fight it, Tony!”
As soon as Steve heard that panicked voice the other side of his watch-radio he ran out of his house and pressed a couple of buttons on his watch, and before he knew it the car with HELEN was parked right outside, engine running and rearing to go. He buttoned up his shirt and slipped on his uniform properly, at least that way no one would question why he was using a police car to get to this place, and no one would stop him for breaking the speed limit either. The last thing he wanted was to be stopped by the police.
floor. Room 66.” He said, quickly running back to Steve’s side and doing a visual sweep of the room. “There wasn’t much I could get from those computers…”
“Still am.” Tony pouted and puffed out his chest with pride. “But you have a point. You know some of my armour doesn’t have gold on it anymore, but I’ll make sure to include more gold in future designs for you.” Tony rested his chin on Steve’s broad muscular shoulder, allowing the tip of his bearded goatee to press flat against the soft shirt, to watch him carry on adding a few more spots of detail using gentle shading. The way that Steve would draw would often mesmerise Tony; the way the pencil would scratch against the surface of the paper, the way he would create a masterpiece from a blank slate; Tony Stark was a huge softie for anyone who could create something out of nothing, for obvious reasons.
“I.. I can’t… My legs!” He wanted to yell more, but he knew that he had to at least stop Tony, hinder him somehow before even attempting to rattle some sense into him.
Tony crouched a little before jumping courageously off the hood, “Go go Stark jet boots!”  And just as Steve had seen before, the boots flickered cyan before lighting up completely and he launched himself from the hood of the car to try and land on the hood of the oddly coloured car, but just as always it was never that easy with Tony.
“Over…ride systems, OVERIDE!” He yelped, focusing all of his efforts to disable the suit and get into its systems.
“I… I know it was a kiss but…” Once more he was at a loss for words, only with Steve. There was something about that kiss, something deeper and more meaningful than any other kiss he had felt in his life. It reminded him of those cliché cartoons where one person would kiss the other and suddenly hearts and rainbows would surround them, with birds singing and happiness filling the air. Well, if that could happen in real life, it would’ve happened that very second. Real life… Was this real? He questioned once more, was he really dreaming or was this all real? It couldn’t have been, not with those huge golden wings fluttering around him, watching the fathers change along with Steve’s skin tone to match the rosy red of his cheeks. It didn’t match up, it didn’t have the extremes his dreams usually would have, it seemed too normal – all asides from the wings. He stepped back a little, wincing as he stepped on a loose screw from one of his gadgets that he was working on earlier, and he winced with pain, suddenly falling back on the bed, out of Steve’s grip and looking at the small cut that formed on his sole as it started to bleed. He rubbed it, eyes narrowing as he cursed himself for being so careless. It was a real injury, he was bleeding, he’d felt pain. He was awake.  This wasn’t a dream.
“Ah, military boy. I was right. Air Force myself, like you I’m taking a small detour before I get back into the game. But I’m restless at home, even though my cat enjoys keeping me preoccupied I just couldn’t sit around and do nothing.”
“You trusted me, that’s how. For that moment when you let me touch your wound, your foot, you trusted me.”
That argument about him being outdated was a defence mechanism and Steve knew it, even though it made alarm bells ring, and he could see right through his lies. He knew he wasn’t the best at using tech, but he certainly knew how to learn and adapt as quickly as anyone else could, if not quicker. He wondered if Tony underestimated him all this time, and although his morals
The shield was being beckoned back at a quick rate, spinning toward them and knocking Tony hard in the back, denting his armour; as if his back wasn’t suffering enough that day. He yelped in pain and quickly punched at the panel in desperation as he felt his leg booster finally short out in that leg and then slid down, still trying to grip onto the skin that he’d torn but not wanting to make the wound any worse than it was. After all, it was still Steve that he was dealing with.
“As you can see, Victor Von Doom had been plotting against us, the events that have unfolded have all been due to him and his dark intentions to destroy the city to overrule it. He will be dealt with and sent to the Negative Zone prison facility, as far from the city as possible.”
“Might be.” He chuckled in turn, turning his head to the screens that flashed up no vitals for Steve, none whatsoever. Tony scratched the shorter shaven part of his hair just above his neck with confusion. “Computers are glitching…” He mumbled to himself, stepping closer and investigating but nothing was showing up. “I’ll need to do some maintenance on these.”
The suit didn’t stay dismantled for long, the chest-piece began to glow, magnetising the pieces together until it stood, fumbling around non-eloquently and grabbed one of the nearest helper-bots, hearing it screech frantically before the yellow glowing decals on the suit began to pulse and the bot fell still for a moment, as though it were corrupting it. It pulled back, rolling over to the workbench to grab the helmet that lay idle, the old helmet, and the one with the dark slanted eyes, intense frown and a ladder pattern along the scalp. Tony’s eyes couldn’t have gotten any wider if they tried. He tried to attempt to talk to the armour, shouting commands at it.
“You impressed with my work, Tony?” Norman asked, hands still behind his back as he stepped closer. “They’re all mine. And they’re soon to be like your friend Steve… Now he was the best specimen. The only to one obey me like a dog. He was so beaten from the explosion it was child’s play.”
“Thanks for beating around the bush…” Tony shrugged, gesturing to his arm. “You know it’s gotten bad when I’m resorting to using Hammer’s tech.”
Tony was right when he’d told Steve before that it sounded just like it was straight out of a movie; in fact, this sounded more like straight out of the comic books that Steve was prone to reading and drawing in his spare time. His hands rested on the wheel and he tried to not look too blown away by the whole story, but it made sense, to some degree.
“It’s me... Tony... You’ve come so far, you’ve fought for what you believe in... Though we have our differences you still fight.” Steve said, keeping a secure grip of the man in his arms that didn’t put up any form of protest.
Why was his heart beating that fast when he saw Tony so pleased with his creation, he asked himself. But internally, he knew the answer; he just wished that it wasn’t the one that he’d thought it’d be. He felt so happy to see Tony smile, he felt at ease around him.
“I’m glad that came off in the wash...” He muttered to himself, saying the same old fashioned sayings that Steve used to tell him after an argument. But he knew that bloodstains wouldn’t just come off in the wash, no, they’d be with him forever. He would try and scrub at the American flag that was once hanging tall, flying atop of the roof terrace of Stark Tower, with rips and tears from the harsh weather conditions that it had endured and yet it would still fly and beam with pride. Now it was stained with blood and Tony made sure to take it within his two hands and scrub so desperately to clean it, but only ended up tearing it more, and yet, he couldn’t just throw it in the trash; he kept it in his office, tucked into his desk drawer as he tried to hide from it, but there was no hiding from the harsh reality he was surrounded by.
Steve seemed happy, everything seemed normal asides from the fact that the date was 1945 in the simulator, everything was peaceful and jolly. The US troops had returned from their service upon the announcement of Japan announcing their surrender and cease-fire and the signing of the formal paperwork of the peace treaty was to be signed in the upcoming months. That’s what Steve Rogers was reading as he was walking down the streets, paper in hand, fedora lowered a bit, looking mighty smug in his dark brown trench coat, and yet he managed to fit in perfectly with this world.
“Begin power up,” he ordered his armour as he held up his palms, the attachable repulsor raising itself and locking in place on his new appendage smugly. The lights began to glow and gather energy. The main problem was that even with this armour Tony couldn’t go rushing into battle, despite how much he wanted to, especially with his leg giving him so much of problem.
Steve sighed with relief, feeling the stress and worry of getting a strict telling off melt off his shoulders. “Okay, let’s go to this lab then, I’ll push the car.”
It was these hands that did this – he was the one fighting Steve, he was the one that broke his legs and because of him Steve was unable to move, and this had happened.
Steve nodded and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, coughing loudly while Tony helped lay him down properly and ran over to the corner shower to cup his hands under the sterilised water and rushed over to Steve, offering it to him to drink, which he did, then did the same thing again to get enough water to wash Steve’s face.
“S’pose so. Come on, let’s get this over with, I want to finish that before we get called out again.” The Captain took the lead out, taking long strides as he left his neat and tidy room behind him, Tony having to take quick steps to catch him up like a lost puppy trying to catch up to its owner.
Tony felt himself swallow thickly as he looked around at where Peter was leading to which seemed to be a section that they’d cordoned off for themselves. He saw memorial stones – bricks with carvings of names, around the section. All names of friends, people he knew. It was no surprise he saw Tigra’s and Luke’s slabs.
Clint cleaned his ear out with the tip of his pinkie finger, “Yeahhhhhhhhh, doesn’t sound convincing enough.”
He’d gotten Steve’s muscular chest all to himself, only lit by the light from his reactor, casting a gentle gleam on the powerful features that were before him. Tony’s parted lips and heavy breath made Steve swallow thickly, only tempting him more as he pressed himself forward and caught those very lips with his own. His eyes closed, pressing Tony against the wall, and his own skin up against Tony’s, with no other sounds being heard asides from the muffled music from the living room, the panting of their hard, quick breaths, and the faint chime of Steve’s dog tags rattling up against Tony’s reactor.
Peter knelt down and began to dig with his bare hands into a plot that had been untouched. “What do you think happened to Carol…”
“No, let’s just say that little malfunction gave me the right sort of lodge, sometimes you need a kick in the head to do things that you’re hesitant to.”
That was a good point, one that Tony couldn’t really explain. “But the serum is giving them blood, just the blood that’s got a toxin in it, causing an infection.”
Once Tony was perched just below the large needle on top of the Empire State, he returned to a vertical stance and let Steve climb off his back gently. On his way down he gave Tony’s back a light pat – probably the closest gesture he was going to get to a ‘thank you’.
The feeling of being a renegade, running from the law was something that he always saw Cap as during the war, but he could never imagine what it felt like. Again, he managed to get a glimpse of empathy in the situation that he was put in, but at least he wasn’t running from the man that he cared about, at least he wasn’t turned against him.
Tony flew off, trying to keep Steve on his trail but the super soldier had other things in mind. He analysed the two and Peter was the weaker target, especially since he was already injured and had an open head wound that could easily be exploited. He’d already begun thinking like a machine.
Tony wasted no time going for Steve’s tie, followed by his shirt after desiring to strip him of it ever since he had first kissed him, letting it unveil a fine specimen of a man; carved muscles that lifted and sunk with every single breath he was taking. Even in the dim light Tony noticed how it had a faint pink blush that extended from Steve’s cheeks down his muscular torso, but when he pressed the pads of his fingertips along the pectorals he felt that it was surprisingly soft. Nothing like he was expecting, and yet, even more desirable, it was silken and opulent.
His attention went toward Steve’s hand, reaching his own over it cautiously to feel that twitch, wondering if he was dreaming or not – but Steve’s hand moved. Steve’s fingers gently skimmed over Tony’s, small motions that slowly and carefully laced their fingers together. Quickly, he turned around to see Steve, laying there with his eyes open, blinking to avoid the raindrops that came from above – finally though, the rain was starting to stop – the drops had become lighter and were reduced to a spit.
Becoming Iron Man had changed him. It had instilled more compassion into him, ever since recovering from being a monger of death he certainly wanted to prevent it. Bombs should’ve been his forte; the key word being
Steve sat up where he was, his hand moving to cup Tony’s face and look at him straight in the eyes. The last thing he could remember was seeing him engulfed in fire, but that was probably the same fire that took him. He recalled the pain in his heart that day, the exact same feeling that Tony felt. Upon watching Tony slip off his own gauntlet, looking at his hand back and forth, examining it in his regular curious manner, Steve copied him and removed the gauntlet to reveal his augmented hand too.
Tony had to raise his eyelids, and did so with a huge amount of effort. The weight on them was unimaginable, the burn behind them was even worse. It was like waking up before that first cup of coffee.
Peter cringed and wriggled his fingers in front of her but then put them in his own pockets, looking at Tony for further instructions.
The more Steve talked the more Tony’s hair began to stand on edge. He sounded like a completely different person and he refused to let this be the new Steve.
Steve could feel Tony’s fear; he could see the way his body stiffened as they closed the gap between him and the infamous Victor von Doom.
It couldn’t be, the man himself, the original super soldier from those relics that he would call comic books and action figures, it couldn’t be the very man he had worshipped growing up as a child just lying there on that long bench, skin as pale and a fragile looking as a porcelain doll. He was still, beautifully so and would look utterly perfect if not for the wires that were threaded around him, attached to him, making him look as though he were part of the machinery.
Tony surged forward, Steve doing the same. They ran at full pace and he attempted the first blow by swinging his arm. Steve focused on his defence, raising his shield up as expected.
Steve fanned his hand at Tony. “Get in that car, Tony. Go home and get some rest. We’ll need it, especially when we show what you’ve changed the car into to the Chief.”
His body arched upward to Steve’s encouragement, eager to feel more of the surges of electrifying pleasure that jolted through his entire body, and he just kept going. His hips rolling into him, heavy pants as Tony moaned so loudly that he could hear his voice become raspy and his throat felt extremely sore, but he had never been in so much pleasure in his entire life.
Tony noticed the subtle raise of Steve’s shoulders and turned to face him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “We’ve got this, Cap.”
“I can do many things, Tony. You know who I am, don’t you? You know what power I have? After all, I am the supreme leader of this place, such an apt title for someone who is ultimately superior to all of you street walkers.”
Steve lurched around the quarantine room and Tony made careful observations and notes at how his moves were slowing down. He tried to swallow his high hopes of this working to avoid the painful disappointment that he had felt and faced within the last few days,
Even with a mask on, the elder man could see her sadness. He remained silent and fingered out the dark blue chip that he had spotted in his own augmentations and let it fall to the ground before placing the palm plate over the exposed circuitry and pulling back, again with his hands up to show he meant no harm, letting the acrylic tool slip back to its place in his shoulder plate. With that she withdrew her hand and moved her fingers as though she were playing an imaginary piano, then slipped the glove on. All seemed well, and what Tony was saying seemed to check out.
In his grazed hand he held the bright pulsing light, limping up to Tony who had regulated the systems, leaning on the huge computers for support, barely able to stand himself. Steve stood opposite him and handed him the pulsing device. Tony stared at it with hatred and resentment, pain and agony, so much so that it made his blood boil, to think this made him hurt Steve, and made him distance himself from his friend. All because of this hand held device that empowered hatred, all because he tried so desperately to fix it as though it were a part of him. But Steve’s words had spoken to him, they deeply did and had managed to embed themselves enormously into his heart, and with that held the light, holding it out and crushing it in his fist.
“Try me!” Tony spat, his face plate folding up so he could stare eye to eye with the man who had killed Steve Rogers.
Once his lips were free he began to speak. “Oh, look, newbie.” He pointed to Steve. “I’m Clint, Clint Barton.”
He could hear voices and shuffling and made his way up, though finding the marbled staircase a task in itself. He pulled himself up step after step, unable to walk up the spiral, ending up on his fours and climbing with Tony following close by.  When they had finally made their way up the stairs they spotted the door was open, someone had just rushed out. Steve ran out eagerly and snarled when the sun hit his skin but carried on walking to the gate of the mansion. It had been his first breath of fresh air in days.
Their eyes returned to normal, and all they could do is stare at each other in complete amazement, wondering what it was that had caused them to do that. But for that split second, it was as though they could see into each other’s minds, and they could protect one another from their deepest fears and worries – it was just a second, but to them it felt like a lifetime.
Overwhelmed didn’t quite cover it, even as Steve began to walk back to the car with his new partner.
“Hold on tight!” Steve said, managing to get one of his hands safe and secure on a small nook that was in some of the panel work, his young sidekick did the same with the both of them shutting their eyes as the plane began to take to the sky. It was then that they knew that they didn’t have long.
“And you will, Winghead, trust me. I’ll do everything I can, in fact I promise not to sleep a wink until you’re out of here, deal?”
“You didn’t let me finish my story; that’s the thing with you Stark, you’re always so quick to jump the GUN. Once a famous weapons dealer, turned robotics engineer. You could have had so much potential, you could have built robots to change the world, and instead you leave that in my much more capable hands. Your schematics were certainly a fun read, but my modifications prove that I am truly superior…”
“W-wait, stop! I’ll be on your side, we’ll take him out together!” Hammer’s poor plea bargain chimed.
“You certainly don’t fit in amongst those two,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes, moving closer toward Steve until he was standing right in front of him, arms still held out defensively.
Tony dropped Steve down in front of the two. Steve’s clean uniform was smeared with the blood from Tony’s missing arm having brushed against it while in his grip.
Tony gave Steve a nudge again, his mood lifting. “Does that mean you’re going to build one for me? You’re an Iron Man fan, clearly. Don’t think I didn’t see those Iron Man boxers in the laundry room back in the mansion.”
“I wouldn’t make such an assumption.” Black Panther said from the seat behind Tony. “Political tensions have reduced between Latveria and the USA significantly. Victor Von Doom would not risk the truce at present.”
A while later Steve was sat down staring at his knuckles, grazing his thumb over each one that had made impact with the wall until he was distracted by a steady creek. Toward the door one of Tony’s many bots reeled in, this one with a conveyer-belt under its wheels, making a tiny squeaking noise as it wheeled itself to the centre of the room. Steve kept his eyes fixed on it until it reached up, chaining up a punching bag and then beeping over at Steve. The Captain took that as a cue to scramble to his feet and hastily stepped to the bot that dispensed a sketchbook from its small orange compartment, along with a pen before scooting out of the room again. Steve’s eyes turned to the window as he mouthed a ‘thank you’ to Tony, grabbing the pen and paper from the floor and quickly sitting down. If he had nothing better to do the only cure for his restlessness would be to draw the pain away. He held no grudge against Tony but the conditions were making him more and more anxious, the sterile surroundings providing as a reminder that he was indeed encased in a medical facility, but the small touches of the outside being brought to him were enough to calm him temporarily.
An arrow shot out, landing right in the centre of the 6-bot patrol. Without hesitation, the bots turned and honed in on the arrow. Alarm bells sounded while the arrow ticked once, then ticked twice, before beeping, and then-
, as you put it, is one of my creations that I’ve worked long and hard to perfect, and I won’t stop until it’s perfected! It’s an innocuous suit, only used to protect me.”
“I’ve got you Steve, I’ve got you,” he felt compelled to point out, biting on his lower lip, praising whoever it was that brought Steve back to consciousness.
Tony’s eyes returned to the man in the box. Steve clutched his stomach again, curled up by his mattress in the same position that Tony had just found him in the second that he had walked in. It was as though the food that he had just given him had no effect, but at least it was promoting Steve to move a little. Lately he hadn’t been moving as much, though Tony didn’t blame him entirely for that. Being stuck and trapped in a small room may have made him feel more claustrophobic than ever. Within this last day Steve had taken a shower, which was progress, and had an inexplicable violent outburst that resulted in some injuries along his hand, and yet no bleeding at all.
Peter got ready to lift her, having to reinforce the webbing around her again, particularly around her hands. It was then that footsteps behind them were heard, loud clunky steps that made the pebbles of concrete shake.
Tony looked at him, giving Steve a hesitant look before unravelling his fingers from Steve’s shirt and reaching up to touch the light that surrounded Steve, it was strange; he could feel more than just a warm light. He felt soft, delicate strands that seemed to move with Steve’s breathing.
Hacking was the easy part, even with sophisticated tech such as Zola’s. Apparently the hardest part was getting through his firewall, which he had done with much difficulty before, so repeating the process mere seconds later was a synch.
“The supreme leader, that guy in the towa’, he’s got a radar. Huntin’ people with it. Get me and a couple o’ fellas off it and I won’t kill ya.”
“Stop it Steve, stop talking nonsense. You’re tired, I’m tired, that’s it, that’s that, leave it at that will you?” Tony said, rubbing his temples as he turned and looked at Steve, who had this strange look upon his face. It seemed sad, depressed, his eyes even slanted like a sad puppy as he lowered his wings. It was then he began to doubt himself, was he really talking nonsense? Steve glanced to the side as he started thinking about whether he should’ve just kept quiet. A man who stands for speaking up, no, he was right in what he did.
“They sure did, frankly, I’m honoured.” He gave him a light hearted laugh to coat how anxious he was feeling again. As he stood his stomach made a loud growl which instantly made Tony pull an expression of sheer astonishment.
“Oh, what I’m going to do will be worse…” He held out his hands and pointed them toward the two. Steve was known for his willpower and the Purple Man’s abilities not being able to work on him because of it, but he felt a haze falling over his mind as he dropped to his knees, with Tony doing the same beside him.
He was thrown into a new space, still hidden and surrounded by walls as he stumbled blaringly around to try and catch his footing. One thing’s for sure, he still hadn’t grown entirely used to walking on his new leg attachment.
No, Tony had lost those that he had loved the most in the past; he couldn’t save them, he had lost his girlfriends in the past, all taken too soon purely because of his name, because of his legacy. Tony was the target of many attacks before joining the force; in fact those reasons encouraged him to follow the path of justice. He couldn’t lose someone else, especially not Steve.
“It still pisses me off that Stark refuses to work with SHIELD, well, sooner or later… Once he gets a grip on his own company, that’s pretty much sinking right now. I heard Obadiah Stane is the one that’s taking charge now…” Fury chuckled with vindication, through and through. “…It’s only a matter of time.”
Tony wriggled his hips at the filling feeing that ran through his body, a loud huff escaping when he felt Steve pull out, and drip out of him. He may have let out a quiver of a groan.
Tony’s eyes lit up the moment Steve said his name, “I knew you’d come.” He said, looking down at his action figure and moving the arms up and down before hugging it close to his chest, “Are you here to save me?”
Behind the door was a huge lab of sorts; filled with computers. In fact, the room was nothing but computers. A polished silver floor, large silver machines to match, even the walls seemed lined with steel. It was empty and cold, but Tony was used to this atmosphere. Steve on the other hand, hated labs. As much as he’d spent time in there especially when working with Hank, T’challa and Reed, it always managed to get to him. Labs reminded him of pain. They were so sterile and empty most of the time, and this one proved his case exactly, especially considering how huge it was. With every step they ventured, an echo was produced from the metal of their boots hitting against the floor. They were trying to be stealthy but having entered such an open space, it was difficult to.
“I remember you telling me.” Steve said, his expression becoming more serious as Tony’s tone dipped.
But it was just that very fact about him, which Steve loved, amongst all the other traits he possessed of course.
Tony was just pulling back, the distance between them starting to form when Steve pulled him closer, placing a gentle peck over the other’s red lips. Tony’s heart fluttered and he gazed up at Steve, who returned nothing but a soft stare.
Just as Tony had said that, a large drone bot, heavy and clunky as was all of Hammer’s tech, leaped out from behind a machine and smacked Tony’s faceplate away, the golden plate was forced off its hinges and sent across the room, clattering into a pile of old brooms.
Critical eyes scanned each statistic with intense scrutiny. “He no longer requires oxygen… There’s very little haemoglobin left in his system at all.”
Tony knew that they had always had that connection and never acted upon it, but Steve seeing Tony in such a desperate state had finally been the key to the lock. The man was affectionate when it came down to the line, and now they knew mutually.
“It was a year ago now, probably just a couple of months longer than that. The story began with me being a rich billionaire, a guy that was always swarmed by the press, New York’s hottest bachelor on the market that had it all; brains, looks, brawn—well, I could work on the brawn, but I wasn’t too bad looking. I was famed for my work on robotics…” Tony gestured for Steve to follow him deeper into the lab. All he had to do was snap his fingers and the lights instantly dimmed; only a few speckles of cyan and little torches held by the bots lighting the room up until Tony tapped something on his hat and placed it on a table, shooting up a projection from the top of it of what Tony used to look like. Truth be told, there wasn’t much of a difference to how he looked now. In the projection he looked tall and polished and lacked the huge trench coat he was sporting nowadays.
She raised her gloved hand, brushing away a few tears and then shook her head, biting down on her lower lip. Hank’s was hurt and she didn’t know if she had much longer with him, the worry she had channelled into fighting Whirlwind was now just piling up with her outlet now taken care of. “I had to take care of him… Where were you two?!”
Tony had to take the moment, whether it was the emotional toil that he’d been through repairing the suit, whether it was the fatigue or the way he gravitated to being cared for, he just needed to let this out. He leaned closer and pressed his lips to Steve’s.
Tony stared up at him with a sparkle in his eye. It wasn’t often that anyone had admitted they worry about him. The Avengers, sometimes, Rhodey and Pepper – of course, sometimes he used to think back and remember how much it felt like Rumiko worried about him. Even just thinking about her made him breathless, and this was by no means replacing her, he could never replace her. This was a different feeling; after all it was a different person he was dealing with. But that same breathlessness would happen, the more he looked at Steve the more he clicked, the more he mingled and got along with him. Possibly another best friend, but maybe more.
Steve held onto Tony without even needing to ask. His hands rested on the bulky red shoulder pads as they caught the light, shining like a candied apple. Tony smiled a little; he always enjoyed when Cap would utilize him like that. There was something comforting about it, but he couldn’t quite place his finger on what it was.
Tony’s breath hitched and he reached for the soft sheets that he was pooled in, grapping at them, body rocking with Steve’s hips. He wanted to keep his eyes open to look at Steve, to look at the Adonis that was giving him this much pleasure already; beautifully sculpted, strong, handsome, with his mop of blond hair now a wonderful mess and not to mention that heavy jawline and distinct dimple in his chin.
“I can still feel that you have a heart, and that you always have. Despite everything that’s happened, you’ve never once lost this.” He said.
Tony felt his hammering heart rest a little when Steve held him like that, both of them creeping forward and trying to stay as quiet as they could, even though for Steve it was extremely difficult given the weight of his feet. Trying his best to stay quiet, he leaned forward, shield resting on his arm as a precaution. Neither of them were sure what would leap out at them, instead as they turned the corner behind a huge clunky machine with HAMMER branded all over it, they caught sight of the huge machine with Killgrave standing in the middle. There were schematics that were plastered on the table in front of them that were clearly marked ‘PROPERTY OF VICTOR VON DOOM’. Someone had clearly stolen from Latviera and Doom mustn’t be happy about that. But for now they had to focus on themselves.
Tony sauntered on over to the guns, white heels of his boots clipping the marvel floor creating an echo, which at least helped Steve determine where abouts his ‘tour guide’ had wondered off to.
Tony flashed a slanted smirk even though Steve couldn’t see him, “Heartless isn’t the word, stubborn is much more appropriate…maybe even headstrong, if I’m trying to hit the nail on the head.”
Tony could’ve practically leapt into Thor’s burly arms at that point, he was so glad to see that no one was injured severely. Instead, his pace only quickened until he was by their side, hanging his head after exhaling a deep sigh of relief filled with pent up emotion.
“Why New York? Why not Hawaii, I mean… I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone, but I would much rather go to Hawaii…” Clint groaned.
Peter and Jessica stood side by side on guard throughout the entire operation which to Tony took a lifetime, but in reality only took a couple of minutes. Praising his speed, they began to dash down the alley which they had initially come through and with that Carol broke from the embrace to tug Tony’s arm and propel herself forward. She moved so quickly her feet lifted off the ground and she zoomed ahead to catch the two spiders up, hovering not so high above them, but just enough to keep Tony in the air too. To make things easier he lifted his legs, but her strength never ceased to amaze him. The exit to the streets wasn’t too far, and Peter was now webslinging from wall to wall to pick up more momentum.
Steve threw his shield, watching it ricochet off one of the walls and then smack into the chains, the intense vibration from the Vibranium emulating holo-shield managing to shatter binds before returning to Steve’s hand. Tony took the opportunity to dash to the computers, using his abilities combined and trying to rectify the systems while Steve continued to batter the armour. It was hard for Tony to watch, and Steve knew that, as abusive as the armour was it was still one of Tony’s creations.
That was until he felt the cold kiss of metal press against his chest. Tony huddled over him, he shielded him.
Days had passed since, and the rebuild of the city had commenced, with the Avengers standing as the leading body.
He found himself clinging to Steve. That touch of their lips made him shiver, and he wanted more of it. The same sensation that he’d craved ever since it had happened years ago. Ever since they’d had inside jokes with each other about their prior ‘almost-kisses.’ Tony had always been the cruder one, but he prayed that Steve knew how much it really meant to him. Their first kiss was the kiss of life, and he would cherish that moment forever.
Steve glared this time, a simple narrow of his eyes was enough to make his glare look that much sharper. “Putting me in that room, Tony, I’m not stupid, why are you trying to put me under quarantine?” He turned to T’challa for answers this time, perhaps if he were unable to get Tony to tell him, much to his disappointment, he’d have to ask the other man that was so keen to escort him into the sterile white room.
When he had stepped into the full body scanner that Tony had built, the large metallic walls encasing the moment that he had entered the machine that was built mainly for Steve knowing how much he had hated hospitals. Stark Resilient was specialising in medical technology and Steve’s dislike of hospitals just provided Tony with the incentive to build a quick-scan device to make the process as easy and as painless as possible. Not to mention that Tony used Steve’s criticism for his own projects quite often. Contrary to popular belief the super soldier had a huge influence on Tony’s work, verbal or otherwise. Steve inhaled deeply, shutting his eyes and letting the machine do its job. The tension in his chest boiled while Tony peered up at the screen, letting some of his helper bots wrap his arms up in clean bandages whenever he was hurt. By this point he had gotten rather used to the pain, so a couple of scrapes here and there weren’t too bad.
“Something’s been happening to people... Stark. We don’t know whether it’s this chemical making them crazy but after a while, after the incident, people started going on killing sprees. You know who the first victims were? Heroes. These regular folk started attacking all of the Avengers. The team had to disperse, but every day a new body gets brought in.”
Then there they were, in front of the largest museum Steve had ever seen. A momentous structure with pillars and white pillars, a glass wall, it was truly something that he’d never seen before, but Steve was preparing for a lot of firsts as it was.
He scooped the engineer into his arms and rushed him over to the computer system, resting him against it. Tony mouthed instructions and Steve listened ever so carefully, just watching the way his lips moved, ripping out the panel with his might and adjusting wire to wire, clipping each one to the reactor, or what was left of it.
Tony could feel his heart fluttering again, his reactor turning pink. Steve adored that, he loved how he could see Tony’s emotion without having to read into it. He bit his lower lip and wrapped his arms around Tony as tightly as he could.
Tony was tied up,  as were the knocked out agents that had attempted to try and tackle the living armour, but Tony was tied to the wall, pulling at the binds as best  as he could, even though all attempts were futile at that moment. The living armour had spouted wires from its fingertips, slithering along and into the computer systems. He wanted all of the information, all of it, every single piece so that it could learn and surpass its creator, but not for that purpose alone – so that it could empower Tony when they became one single entity, when they merged.
“Come on, come on…” he murmured desperately, trying to fix the screw back into place, which was hard when his hand kept changing.
Steve’s bright blue orbs widened in panic and he began to tap faster. Bomb defusing wasn’t his forte, that was more Gabe and Dino’s expertise, and it became even more difficult to focus when the floor was beginning to rumble, and the countdown activated.
Steve swung his shield around, watching it ricochet against the wall and knock Tony’s hand, which was the perfect opportunity for him to go on the offensive again, grabbing him and drilling a series of punches to his chest and abdomen. Though with each strike his own eyes widened, a pained expression lasting. He was conscious, he knew he was, but he couldn’t do a thing; trapped under the puppeteer’s control.
The inspector shrugged casually. “What? Guy has a potty mouth, French is a beautiful language and it’s being abused.” Not to mention he didn’t like anyone swearing at his new partner.  He turned his head from Steve and adjusted his hat, looking down at the sparks flying from his arm.
He couldn’t quite believe he was working here. This was every cop’s dream; to be stationed in one of the world’s most renowned departments, right in the centre of the city. “Wow…”  Steve was completely Mesmerized, lost in his thoughts and dreams until a firm hand tapped his shoulder.
“Go and check it out, if you need help, I’m here. So are Carol, and the others. Call us.” He said, walking eagerly to join Carols side before she would zoom off without him, she already looked as though she were ready to. He needed to fill her in too, just in case.
The suit jolted and changed direction, grabbing Tony and placing a forceful hand over his mouth. “QUIET, TONY.”
More black liquid swirled in his tear ducts and he bit hard on his lower lip, staring with anguish at this dead soul that narrowed his eyes back at him. He stared as the black droplet slid down his skin, outlining the now rigid shape of his face. Painfully he brushed it away and smeared it once again, rubbing at it over and over trying to get rid of the mark before letting out a yell of pain. His frantic mind, his clouded thoughts along with the stress and heavy duties he carried on his shoulders were tallying up to that very moment. He yelled loudly, punching at the glass, at that disgusting creature that was staring back at him, at that demon that was keeping him confined and away from the people he loved. He punched and punched, feeling the glass vibrate under his knuckles. He noticed his skin tear, he noticed it peel back. Each punch hitting harder, sure that he saw one or two cracks form until he pulled back and saw the bone of his knuckles now on display. Black gunk spewing from it, surrounding it, to which he yelled again and began to pull at his hair with frustration and tainting it what that very black that was over his hands, straying it through the soft once sunny blond. He screamed as loud as he could. For some reason he couldn’t hold back when all he saw was red in front of him, he could feel his sanity begin to dwindle away with each passing moment.
This was the one chance he had, and Tony Stark seized that chance like the opportunist he was. His arm rose, then and he slammed his armour coated hands through the mirror, circling around the surprised super-soldier and yanking him through. Shards scratched at his flesh, but Tony didn’t rest until he had successfully pulled him through.
Steve stepped closer to Tony, as much as he could, craving more of that beloved contact. Tony’s arms draped around Steve’s broad shoulders and he felt Steve’s fingers tuck just under his chin for a moment, tilting it up then finally pressing against his own. The electrifying feeling between them made Tony’s breath quicken forthwith.
For a moment Tony held out his hand, shooting his repulsor into the sky, but making a drawing with the beam of light in the shape of a heart. Corny, Steve thought, but adorable. It only caused Steve to chuckle under his breath and loop his arm closer around the other.
“Your head looks like a shell; like those big bombs that used to drop or regulation bullet shells, a shell! You know?” He had to keep Tony talking to make sure his head didn’t take that big of a blow.
Tony’s eyes were busy scanning the schematics in his own helmet, darting from line to line, reading the coordinates and absorbing the information faster than anyone else realised. “You really ought to be grateful I can do this, you know. My retention’s an amazing feature, and a very underestimated one at that.”
here, and we don’t want to mess up the timeline even more than we already are. Things can go terribly wrong--”
Tony’s eyes drifted to the floor again and he tucked in his lower lip, “You know, I stopped believing in that stuff…” There was no point expanding when Steve apparently knew.
Tony knew he had to find a place to rest, he had to recharge too. His old armour wasn’t exactly power saving, and the amount he was using his repulsor in that day was wearing out the old systems even though he’d tried to upgrade it as much as he could. His hand was feeling tired, as was his leg, clearly showing they too needed more energy.
“I pulled out every trick in the book. At times I wished ‘geez, if only I could fly away from this person’, well now I can, but before that… I just didn’t have the capability. I drove as quickly as I could, and then… Would you believe it? I started heading back with Rumiko just over the Golden Gate Bridge, and that’s where it happened…”
“I’ll help round the others up,” Janet volunteered, eyeing the two and trying not to smirk to herself, but instead just whispered a firm ‘finally’.
The mirror complied, and displayed a zombie version of Steve. The captain stood before him, decrepit; clutching a piece of his own brain in his hand. Tony’s face quickly formed a disgusted expression. “Out of the question. Next.”
Steve gave him a nod and a half salute as he began to walk up to Tony, who growled as he turned and made his own way to his lab.
Not everyone is born an angel, there are only one or two souls that are placed down onto the earth to grow, but as stated before, they equally have the chance to lose their wings and become humans. However, once an angel loses its wings it gets sent down to purgatory, it has no chance of joining the host. Usually, angels that were sent to the Earth as babies don’t become aware of their wings unless they continue believing, continue to have faith and stay on the true path. If they stray, there is less chance of their wings ever growing or becoming aware of them.
He limped toward the aroma and then spotted him; Reed was on the ground with chunks of flesh bitten out of him. And yet, instead of feeling sick as he would have normally given the sight, Tony knelt down and sniffed. The smell was coming from him, from his neck, from the red blood that seeped from the gaping raw wounds. Tony licked his lips, or what was left of his bottom lip, and then scooped some of the blood up using his index finger. Again he sniffed at it then cautiously licked the blood. As he did his taste-buds lit up, he could feel himself filling with life again he could feel his hunger intensify after being teased. Slowly he craned closer, menacingly. He found that his impulses were taking over and he licked at Reeds neck, the cold flesh still warmer than his own. He didn’t want to do this, he didn’t want to swoop in like a vulture, but the voices in his head were spurring him on. Tony had given in to the voices in his mind before, he wasn’t as strong willed as others made him out to be. Far from invincible, now overwhelmed with grief from his constant failures particularly in the relationship department and displaying signs of depression – the Tony Stark that used to sing on his way to work was long gone in recent times. That made his mind weak and susceptible to the demons inside him. The darkness that engulfed the room helped shadow Reed’s face…at least that made him feel less guilty as he bent down and tugged at some of the exposed tendons with his fingertips. His hands were shaking with shock as he pulled out a small piece of flesh, biting into it, to his own surprise and actually enjoying the taste. He went for more as he tried to satisfy the hunger that he couldn’t handle. The empty pit in his stomach needed to be filled and satisfied and yet the more he ate, the more he needed. He stopped using his hands after some time and began just biting into Reed’s flesh with his teeth, ravenously swallowing and chewing until blood covered his upper body and face. It was difficult to keep food in his mouth with a lack of bottom lip – chunks would fly out as he yanked the meat from the bone, slippery blood covered meat and now exposed organs fallen from the open chest cavity. Tony wasn’t afraid to break the ribs that obstructed him (so much for those lessons on dinner etiquette that his father had paid hundreds for) and managed to pull out some of the organs, without hesitation he bit into them and watched as they spilled more bodily fluids. Tony feasted like no other, enjoying each different taste and texture, feeling no other emotion than hunger as though his brain filtered out any remorse.
The second that Reed tried to stretch out of his restraints MODOK zoomed over, tapping a few commands on his own chair.
He fastened the snap on the boot that he was familiar with and then tugged at it, looking up at Steve since he was trying not to wake him. Luckily the man was a heavy sleeper, that’s what 70 years in the ice does to a person.  With a small wriggle and tug he managed to get the metal to slip off, his eyes filling with shock to the sight before him. Steve’s leg was a metallic branch that was connected to the foot of the suit. Tony clasped his hand over his mouth for a second, remembering how the man was caught in the explosion. He didn’t even question how he managed to look so perfect when he had encountered him, because Steve always looked like that; he was perfection personified. He felt empty looking at it, knowing that if he’d protected Steve then he wouldn’t have this injury, once more self-loathing and guilt were weighing upon his conscience.  His bottom lip quivered and he could feel the overwhelming burden embrace him, gently sinking to his knees, his fingers sliding upon the metal augmentation just before his knees hit the ground. He breathed deeply, his breath catching into a short huff. Was he actually crying? His body was trembling but he knew he had to be stronger, he knew he shouldn’t cry, that this needed to be stopped and sitting there crying about it wasn’t going to help anybody.
“There are parts of you that you need to destroy for your own good, and they are your demons. That thing is clearly a demon.”
