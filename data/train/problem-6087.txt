"Strange," Thor interjected, "that's quite out of the ordinary."
"Yes, sir?"
"Steve?" Bruce said softly. Another groan filled the expanse of the room, propelling Tony off of the chair and towards Steve's side. The soldier stirred, his fingers twitched and his eyelids fluttered. Tony's breath hitched in his throat and his hands shook as he watched Steve's eyes slowly open. He was confused at first until his eyes spotted Bruce and he smiled. That sweet, heart-warming smile that Tony missed so much, he finally got to see it again despite how much pain Steve must be in.
"God, you're so sexy when you're turned on. Wonder how many things we can do in the meantime. I feel like climbing you like a pole, although that can wait after-"
"Uh... Yeah. How's he doing Bruce?" Tony asked.
He ran into Bruce along the way, the shy Doctor saying his greetings to the super-soldier, both exchanging small conversation before it turned into awkward silence. They parted ways, Steve
Steve's words seem to have effectively caused the genius to properly digest this bit of information. It never really occurred to him that this wasn't the only time Steve has had nightmares before, he actually thought that this was the first time. As someone who constantly is in his lab, ignoring the necessities of day-to-day life such as food and water, only occasionally leaving the lab for coffee before continuing his 72 hours of no sleep, he knows what nightmares can do to people. He's had nightmares ever since he put that nuke into outer space, but this wasn't him they were talking about. This was Steve. Pure, innocent, 1940's, selfless, Steve Rogers.
"Before you fuck me? Come on, you're a big boy, you were swearing up a storm earlier." Tony giggled as Steve glared at him. "Put some on your fingers and you stick 'em inside me. After that, everything else is black and white."
"It was very painful to constantly worry about you, and I couldn't take it anymore. With the whole palladium incident that you never told me about, and then you try to fly a nuke into outer space, sometimes I think you have a death wish."
"Well they are spies, and they are very sneaky. Natasha is the scary one out of the two. I actually thought she was going to kill me after she found you in the hall."
"I think you should keep the beard, it looks good on you all things considered." A feminine voice spoke out to him. He turned his head towards the door and saw Natasha, dressed in a grey high neck vest accompanied by black cargo style sweatpants, leaning against the door frame with her arms crossed, and her traditional all-knowing sly smirk plastered on her face. "Besides," she pushed off the door frame and walked over to him, placing her hands on the second to the top button on his short sleeve white collared shirt and undoing it, exposing just a bit more of his chest. "I think Stark really likes the beard." He chuckled at her, exiting the bathroom with her in tow.
"I'm right here baby, and I'm not going anywhere. I promise."
point break?" Tony said slightly angry, earning him an elbow from Nat. He rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, a fake smile plastered on his face as he sat there, waiting.
"Hmm?"
In no time at all the floating steel island came into their view. The lights spotted the Quinjet, and the top of the island slowly opened up to them, a landing pad coming into view.
"Thanks, J."
To the genius it was surreal in a way; the first time he'd been in a hospital- or rather a hospital-like situation that involves surgery, because a cave in Afghanistan is most definitely not a hospital, he was the one being operated on and received a makeshift plate in his chest that was powered by a car battery. He was then in another hospital situation where he had surgery done on him to remove the shrapnel from his chest, which was the same day he finally stopped having to rely on the Arc Reactor to keep him alive- but that very day birth experimentation to find a replacement Arc Reactor since he felt way too naked without the contraption on his chest. In a way, the Arc Reactor became a part of him, relatively speaking because, well, it
"T-Thank y-you." He stutters. Bucky and Nat just smile, and they don't force him to say anything else, and he's ok with that. He joins them on the couch, just forgetting about his problems, forgetting about his inner turmoil, forgetting what troubled him just for this moment to enjoy the only ounce of peace he's gotten in a while.
It's a nice thought, and that's why Tony was going to head on over to the raft today to initiate their plan. Was he worried? Absolutely not, he's Tony Stark he can absolutely pull this off. Sure he might be reckless and is more of a "go with the flow" type of guy, but with the right incentive, he's willing to stick with the plan. His incentive for this? His family, and a specific super soldier he's absolutely in love with.
"Tony, I-I'm gonna-", Steve started, but it was reduced to nothing but a groan against Tony's lips when the genius leaned down to kiss him. He wrapped his unoccupied arm around Tony's neck, deepening the kiss as pleasure pooled around his stomach, his balls tightening, the burning ache of release swirling rapidly as he was pushed closer to the edge. With one last thrust, Tony moaned against Steve's lip, burying himself inside the blonde, filling him up with his warm, thick seed, Steve following shortly after as he came over both of their stomachs. They pulled apart, Tony's head resting against Steve's shoulder, both participants panting as they came down from their high.
"For you, I'll be the best me that you already see." Steve took off his jacket and shirt, tossing them onto the ground and leaning down to place a kiss onto Tony's lips. The genius opened the drawer next to the bed, his hands fumbling around until it grasped the bottle of lube that he kept inside. Steve pulled back from the kiss and took the bottle that was being handed to him, a cute confused expression on his face.
"I'll make you breakfast whenever I can if that's ok with you?"
I found my body undergoing shock, my eyes snapping open as my teeth chattered. I looked around, my eyes moving across the expanse of the room until it landed on a familiar figure, whose smile I was so familiar with.
"Yes, boss."
"Your room is more home for me, but we still need to get that fixed after the... Incident." Steve spoke, blushing.
"What did I do to deserve it?" I asked, my voice small in my own ears. His smile grew in size, his body coming closer to mine, so close that I could feel his breath against my ear. He placed the bucket down behind the chair, his hand slowly moving towards my face, caressing my cheek.
"He's like your child. It's very adorable." Wanda said.
"Wow, you learn something new every day," Bruce said, earning him a playful shove from the genius. It was times like this where Tony appreciated the Avengers, who he happily calls his family. Yes, they were family to him; he doesn't actually know when he considered them that, but it's nice to know that they were always there for each other. Sure they may argue, bicker, have disagreements, but they cared about each other and always helped each other when they needed it. It was touching to see how close they got, and Tony cherishes them all, but they didn't need to know that.
Currently, Tony was working on the final touches for his Iron Man suit while also talking to Steve.
"I love you, Steve," Tony said quietly. He looked down at his lover, a smile quick to break out onto his face. He leaned down and gently placed his lips against Tony's, savoring the moment just for a little before he pulled back slowly, keeping his face close to the other males.
"Right away, sir." The AI worked his magic and soon Tony started to balance out again, but he still crashed hard into the asphalt waiting for him. He rolled across the ground and bounced for a few seconds before he finally came to a skidding halt. He groaned in pain and sat up, looking at the right side of his suit, noticing the gaping hole where the color of red and gold used to be, and the flickering blue light where his repulsor blast was always functioning at the ready. There were eerie sounds in the distance, getting closer as the minutes rolled by. He stood up as the sounds were close to him, his left repulsor blast at the ready.
"Of course I do, I was just wondering if you were going to lie to me or not. That and T'Challa told me on his way out, said you might need some backup." She says, walking over to him casually. "Just hope you don't mind me bringing a plus one." He was confused at first, but then another set of boots thudding against the silver tiles of the facility caught his ears, and he looked away from her face for just a split second to see-
"That's not really fair," Steve said, a hint of defiance in his voice. Tony furrowed his eyebrows, a crease forming between them. Just what was going on?
He sighs heavily, running a hand over his face. He tries so hard to not think about the worst-case scenario, but he can't help it. He's grown so accustomed to being Tony's prisoner, as messed up as that sounds, that it's just hard
"Let him in, J." He said. The door opened and he watched with an intense stare at how nervous Steve really was. His eyes never met Tony or Wanda's, his feet wobbled with each step, his hands never left their place on his shirt, and if Tony paid more attention to detail, he could see how red Steve's eyes were, and how disheveled his hair was. Just what happened to him?
A flash of scarlet mist fluttered past his line of sight, and the lab around him faded into black. He knew exactly where he was; it was a nightmare he was so familiar with, one that always recurred and left him gasping for breath, left him sweating in the middle of the night. He let out a shaky breath as he turned around.
"Is it getting late over there?" Steve's concerned voice suddenly asked.
"Like I said Bruce, perfectly fine. I feel great, actually. Hey, how about you? How are you two doing, let's talk about that shall we?" They stared at him, and it made his skin crawl. It was the kind of skin-crawling experience where you wanted to reach down and just scratch at it until it went away, nails digging into your skin and creating temporary red lines that eventually would fade after a while, as well as the itch. However, for Tony, it was the kind of skin crawl that came with the feeling of alcohol consumption, and as much as he wanted to feel the taste of amber liquid swirling in his mouth, touching his taste buds and sending a shock of joy down his spine, he was trying to fight the urge as best as he could, which was weird. Shit, it must've been Steve that made him want to be a better person.
"Nice to see you too, Pep. Thought you'd be busy with SI?"
"It confirmed what Clint said; that they turn into the people we care about the most to break us, to get in our head, to fuck us up so they can take our asses out. On top of that, it told me some info about Steve." He spoke calmly.
As he looked around the room, even towards the desk he found no breakfast, but instead his sketchbook sitting there neatly. He doesn't know what he's supposed to expect, but realistically he expected some sort of affectionate good morning, but instead was just met with no Tony, no food, nothing really except what he already owned or was given in this room. It brought down his mood as he sat up, eyes focused on the silver, cold tiles his feet were resting on.
"What...? What are you sorry for, you didn't do anything wrong?" Tony said, confused. What exactly is Steve apologizing for? As far as Tony is concerned, Steve hasn't done anything wrong. The guy just came back from being held captive, and he's already apologizing as if his mere presence has hurt him.
"Hey, Anthony?"
"Were you the one who saved him?" He asked, looking at her intensely. She nodded her head as she stood up, dusting the snow off her thigh-high black dress. "I swear to god if you're one of those things and you're just messing with my head I'm going to-".
Steve turns his head to look at Tony, and it's hard for him to make out what he's seeing. It's all blurry and blob-like. What he can make out through his right eye, he can't put into words. He sees Tony perfectly through his left, sitting there with tear-stained cheeks and a sad smile on his face, but through his right eye he cannot make out the genius features. There's also this irritating little white spot that he has to blink multiple times to get away, and when it's there it makes the genius appear milky; as if, instead of blurry, he has cloudy vision. He hopes that this isn't temporary, because he doesn't know how he'll cope if he can't see Tony properly with both eyes, or if he can't draw either.
"Miss you too, honey bear." Steve's adorable giggle was the last thing he heard before the call ended. He grabbed his phone and turned around, staring at the couch. Should he sleep in here, or should he actually drag his ass all the way to his room and fall asleep there? Fuck it, he was too lazy at the moment and he knew regardless he was going to be busy the next few days, considering he still had to work on his suit, and once he was finished with that, maybe another robot he could build for Dum-E. Was he going to regret it, possible, but at least it kept his mind busy? He grabbed the blanket from its place on the couch and gently laid himself down. He was surprised the couch still smelled like the super-soldier, a nice vanilla scent still fresh on the cushions. He doesn't know when he passed out, but he was sure that he was enjoying the scent of Steve so much that he dreamed the man was there, cuddling him as he fell asleep happily.
"Tell him... What, exactly?"
"Sir, I would highly advise against what you are about to do."
Loneliness is funny, really, you can have friends and family, but there is this gnawing ache in your chest, a prick of pain nestled inside your heart, drawing in all feelings of happiness to make you feel as if you were alone the whole time. There are different forms of loneliness; one being the usual form of not having anybody at all, but he wouldn't classify that as being an introvert, since some consider the two to go hand-in-hand. Being an introvert doesn't mean you don't have any friends, it's just harder for you to make those connections with another person. There's also the loneliness he feels when you have people next to you, on a day-to-day basis, always asking how you are, what's on your mind, you relish in these moments you spend with them. But truthfully, you still feel the ache of not having anybody near you that makes you feel as if you are truly alone.
"See something you like?" Steve asked. Tony nodded his head slowly, watching the way Steve stood up off the bed, his fingers dipping into his pants and pulling them down. His boxers soon followed, and he was mesmerized by the sight of Steve naked in front of him. As Steve laid down next to Tony, the genius crawled on top of him, littering his body with kisses on the way down.
"That's the thing, Doctor Banner," Fury said calmly, his gaze locked onto Tony, "with the information that Stark has gathered, we can at least draw a conclusion as to what these things really are, and figure out a plan of attack. He's got this thing figured out."
It's the way he looks so sincere when he tells him these words, that once more he believes him. He brings his lips onto him in a softer, more chaste kiss. He lays back with Tony against his chest, their lips still attached as they kiss slowly, savoring the moment. And when he pulls back, he looks into those beautiful brown eyes of his lovers and says those same five words he told him yesterday.
"Yeah, yeah. Now, how's everything looking over there? I'm trying to understand your mission, so I have JARVIS hacking S.H.I.E.L.D. to get the juicy details on your secret spy mission."
He touched his lips, remembering the kiss they had shared before S.H.I.E.L.D.s medical team had arrived at their location. And God, does he wish that those soft lips were against his own at this very moment, because only then. will his thoughts stop clouding his mind and quiet the guilt that's loud in his own mind. He sighs heavily and lets his hand drop to his side, his feet moving from his location towards the door.
Now the third heartbreak was more recent, and it was almost unexpected, even to himself actually. He always considered himself a straight male, destined to fall in love with women until he eventually had kids, and grew old; because that's always been the plan for him. Find a nice girl to settle down with, marry her, have kids, watch his kids grow up, go to college, move out, and grow old with his wife. He only achieved one of those, and he actually never thought he would get another chance at love, let alone finding someone to marry.
"Ready as I'll ever be." Tony reengaged his helmet and walked over towards the hangar's ramp, waiting for it to open. He heard Steve walkway, then two new sets of footsteps took his place, coming right next to him. It was Thor, the God of Thunder simply sending a comforting pat on his back. The ramp opened, and Tony could feel the familiar rush he always got when he used the suit. It's similar to how a skydiver might feel; that quick rush of adrenaline you get when you jump out of a plane and free fall, the wind whipping your hair in many directions, the gust of wind contorting to your body, your sensories are on overload as your brain is still stuck on the image of you on the plane, long after you have already jumped out. Tony loved this feeling, he was always in control when he flew around in the suit, he remembers the first time he tested his Iron Man suit.
Steve continued to apologize, and Tony continued to assure him that it was ok, that he's here for him, and that he's sorry for leaving him this vulnerable. They held each other; Steve staining Tony's shirt with his tears, and Tony placing soft kisses on Steve's face and whispering sweet words into his ear to calm him down.
"How do you plan to do that," Bruce inquired, "no offense, Director, but if these things managed to take down Nat and Clint; two of the most highly trained spies, then how do you think we'll be able to handle them?"
"I have to say, to me personally you kinda deserved it. Well, not kinda, you did deserve to get shot and knocked up." He said, his eyes staring into mine. I didn't like the way he was looking at me, it didn't feel like this was the man I spent my life getting to know. But he was standing right there, this had to be Tony right?
That killed him heavily on the inside, but on the outside, he tried not to show it. He knows that Steve's an artist, he's seen all the drawings, and he knows how much this will kill the super-soldier. He won't be able to draw, and he knows that drawing is one of Steve's most favorite things to do. It gives him tranquillity, peace of mind from the stress their lives have been given, hell, it even gives him peace from the genius when he's being just a tad more annoying than usual. Not being able to use his eye for drawing is like Tony not being able to use his hands for tinkering. And it's even more shitty that he has to be the one to tell Steve when he wakes up.
"Why? I thought you already knew everything about me from S.H.I.E.L.D."
"Thanks, Tony." The genius smiled back at him, nodding his head and grabbing his mug from its place next to him. He chugged his own coffee down within a matter of minutes, earning himself another cup before starting to walk away from the area, most likely to finish up repairs on his Iron Man suit. The super soldier looked around and realized how empty it became once Tony left, and the small smile on his face shortly turned into a frown. He looked down at the half-empty mug, dumping out the rest of the contents before setting the mug back into the shelf from once it came after he washed it of course.
Tony didn't really consider himself as someone who really needed love in his life. Don't get him wrong, he absolutely loves the idea of being with someone- and that didn't have to mean sexually, because yes he knows that before he used to be a playboy, bringing different women, and on occasions, men into his bedroom where he could be as intimate as he wanted with no strings attached. Simple, harmless fun that he could partake in without any repercussions. He never understood what it was like to wake up next to a partner you wanted to see in the morning, or what genuine love was until he met Pepper.
"What is this?" He asked, confused.
"I'm sorry."
"Would you like me to get Ms. Maximoff for you, sir?" He pondered for a moment. Would this perhaps be better than locking himself down here and drinking his issues away? The obvious answer was, of course, yes, but that was up for Tony to decide. It was easy to give the simple answer of yes, but he would have to mean it.
We're almost at the end of the story! Two more regular chapters, and then an epilogue to go! Thank you all so much for the comments and kudos, and I truly hope that when you reach the end of this story, you loved it and hope to read more stories that I will be posting on this site!
"If Tony and I were dating... There wouldn't be a problem with that, right?" There was a look behind Steve's eyes as he spoke, and Tony understood that look clearly. However, seeing it on Steve, who was usually cool about a lot of things related to the team, unnerved Tony. It was a look of fear stitched into those big blue eyes of his, and of course, he would have some sort of fear, he always would put the team first, and Tony knew that. He was also ok with that, but he didn't want Steve to think that their possible relationship would affect the team. Hell, if anybody had a problem with Steve having an attraction for a guy, not just an attraction for Tony, he would defend the big guy's honor until his very last breath.
The two superheroes ate in comfortable silence, their eyes occasionally locking with one another. It felt good to finally have a moment of peace together, without any super spies or villains to ruin the mood. It was a nice touch of pace, because seriously if Tony got interrupted anymore when he was spending time with Steve, he was going to lose it. Or at the very least, he was going to fight someone, if that is what it came down to.
Steve whispered.
Once the door opened and closed, Tony wasted no time in stripping himself and Steve of their shirts, pushing Steve back onto the bed and climbing on top of him. He went straight for his neck, letting his teeth rack over the flesh, creating hickeys that would disappear by morning. He licked downwards, tongue trailing down from his neck to his defined chest, altering its path to the left, licking over his hard nipple. The soldier arched his back in response, and Tony smirked.
The door to Steve's room opened and he gently placed Tony on it.
"Yes, boss."
"Because you've been moping around the tower."
"What are you doing here?"
"I know, and I'm sorry for that." He looked her in the eyes and conveyed as much emotion as he could into them. He truly was sorry for putting her through so much of his shit, and he loves her so much more for always putting up with him. He now knows what it feels like to worry about someone, and it's not a good feeling, so she deserves an apology. "I never meant to make you worry about me so much that it caused you pain, but I'm not sorry that my life is this dangerous. I've made many mistakes in my life, but being a superhero is not one of them. But I truly believe you deserve an apology, and a thank you for all you've done for me."
"I wasn't going to ask you to. I just wanted to talk about something." Steve reassured.
"There's a small hatch just right of the center. It leads you down the main entrance but more towards the back, but from there you can get to the control center of the raft."
"Alright, I finally got through."
"Where are you off to?" Her cool, soft-spoken, with just a tad bit of hardness in her voice questioned. He smiled and looked over his shoulder at one of his best friends that he's gotten close to over the years, and to this day he'll still never figure out how she knows so much. It's the small curve of her lips in a half-smile, and the way her greyish green eyes look into his and send the message of "I know", does he remember that she knows everything because she is a top spy.
"Peggy Carter saw something different," Tony said softly. He looked up from his plate and gave a sad smile, nodding his head slowly.
"I... I can't."
"Yes, Steve, you have." Tony was no idiot, obviously, he was a genius on many standards even far greater than just math and science. It probably didn't take a genius to see that Steve was having a difficult time still adjusting to his new life, and the way he carried himself through the tower, well, Tony could obviously see he wasn't happy. "From the moment you entered the tower, I've only ever seen you smile once, and that was when I made you your room."
"Nah, when I was younger I was bullied in school." Steve furrowed his eyebrows, a small frown always making its way onto his face. That was actually something he didn't really know about Tony. Well, there were still a lot of things he didn't know about Tony, and it made him actually sad to know he was bullied growing up.
In a superhero's life, when things start seeming abnormally normal, such as evil not turning up for quite a while, or things just being generally
"Can I kiss you?" He quietly asked. It was the broken chuckle that he heard first, and the sad smile he saw first, accompanied by the tear that hit his cheek that he felt first before Tony nodded his head. And he seized the moment because this is what he's wanted all this time; to feel this man's lips against his, to be in love with someone who was the complete opposite of him, but complimented his personality so well because of how different they were.
"No, Tony, get some sleep and I'll keep in contact with you whenever I can." The genius rolled his eyes and scoffed, shaking his head a little as well before getting up off the stool in his lab.
The door to his room opened, and Tony entered. Just like last time, the genius looked anywhere but at him. He tried to will himself to meet the soldier's gaze, but once more he turned away. He expected no less from the brunette, but it didn't mean that it hurt any less. However, this time Tony took a second look, and it lasted longer than a few seconds. He stared back into those beautiful, brown catalysts that seemed to be swimming with an emotion he couldn't quite depict. But it was when he saw that first twitch of Tony's lips, the twitch that slowly turned into a small, upwards curve that brought just a small, slight smile on his face, one that Steve himself reciprocated.
"I don't mind. I don't really care what we watch, long as we're together."
"Oh God, T-Tony." He stuttered quietly, kneeling and sitting on his knees once he was directly in front of the genius. He could visibly see the shock collar around his neck that he remembers wearing when he was brought here, and he could only imagine what horrors Tony had to go through. He also noticed that the genius's hands were not visible, hidden away under his armpits. "W-what did he d-do to y-you?" A simple question had caused the genius to let out a loud, strangled sob that caused a surge of pain to go through the soldier's own heart.
"A little," Steve walked over to Tony and stood between his legs, leaning down to peck his lips before speaking again, "but the present has you in it. That's what really matters."
"We can just s-stay like this. If you w-want to?" Steve suggested.
how everything turned out to be. Why did it have to be Steve? Why couldn't it have been me?" Nobody said anything, they just looked at him with sad smiles on their faces. They understand where he was coming from; without any hesitation, they would have taken his place in a heartbeat, even Wanda, who was the part of the cause as to why Steve is the way he is. "I can't touch him, if I try to he flinches from me. If I try to come anywhere near him he whimpers and flinches, he thinks I told him that if he loves me he should kill himself for me; which, by the way, he almost did. How do I handle that? I mean, he came down to the lab and we've made some progress, but things are never going to be the same for Steve and me, hell, things are never going to be the same for Steve. I just wanna bubble wrap him and protect him, but that's a horrible idea."
"You're such a gentleman. You should eat first." He shakes his head at Tony's statement and continues to hold the burger out for him. He doesn't resist this time, and he gives in, smiling lovingly at Steve before he inches forward and sinks his teeth into the warm bun and all the ingredients contained within. He makes a sound of satisfaction, making Steve chuckle as he grabs a fry and holds that out for Tony too, who happily accepts it.
"Welp, gotta go guys, got a date with a hot super soldier." He didn't wait for them to respond, he simply ran out of the kitchen, forgetting his half-full cup of coffee, and getting back into his lab, setting himself back into his chair and once more pulling up a holographic image of Steve from the incoming phone call.
Regardless, he needed something "new", in a way for him to do. Hell, he's even
"Sorry to interrupt," Jarvis suddenly spoke, "but I have terrible news."
"Wow, nobody told me we were having a movie night!" And just like that, it had to be ruined by none other than bird brain himself, Clint Barton. Tony rolled his eyes and successfully kept the groan that so desperately wanted to escape out of his mouth. "Hope I'm not interrupting anything." Tony glared at him as he settled himself onto the couch adjacent to them, a small smirk on his face.
"What did Steve do to make you want to be a better person?" Bruce questioned. Oh fuck, he said that out loud, again!? Goddammit, when was he going to learn to keep his thoughts inside of his head instead of letting them spew out of his mouth faster than he could realize? Now they're going to question him about the super soldier and he'll never hear the end of it. "Well, we are curious about why Steve would make you a better person, but I'm sure we're not going to go overboard with the questions."
"Yeah. It's the middle of the night, actually." He tried to stifle the yawn that was threatening to come out, but he failed miserably. His joints popped as he stretched his arms and his legs, it, strangely enough, relaxed him whenever that happened, as if his muscles felt more relaxed. He placed his arms on his desk and his chin on top of them, smiling at the blonde. "It's weird really, usually I'd be able to stay awake for days on end, but when we're talking it's like I can barely stay awake. You're not trying to domesticate me, are you?"
He squeezed his eyes and waited for the bullet to hit him, the sound of the gunshot loud and ringing in his ear. He didn't feel pain, he didn't feel a bullet pierce its way through him, he just heard the tiny sizzle indicating a gun did in fact go off. He turned his head slowly, and where the imposter Fury stood, the real one took his place. He looked down and saw the replica Fury with a bullet hole through its head, and he swears he's gonna have nightmares about this.
He was so caught up in his own slight emotional turmoil that he didn't hear the footsteps coming closer to him, that he didn't realize Tony had stopped in front of him and knelt, coming into eye level with Steve. In his hand, however, was that stupid fucking rectangular dial he was so used to seeing in Ross' hand whenever he wanted to shock him, and he already knew what was coming.
"Fine, I'll get some sleep, mom." He joked playfully.
"It's
"How are your injuries?"
and God does he
"It's not your fault that the villains we fight can't stop being assholes for a few god damn minutes, to let us enjoy some quality time alone." His mood softened a little as he heard the light chuckle out of Steve's mouth, followed by the heartwarming smile he got used to seeing recently.
"Who cares what the other's say? I certainly don't. It's not like we were fucking."
self, before I received the serum. Sure, I had no problem standing up to bullies, I hated them, but there's only so much a person can take. Yet, I never learned. Even after this, I continued to open my mouth and have my ass handed to me, but where things got this bad, I always had Bucky.
"Hey, look at me!" Tony shouted, piercing past the veil of terror he felt, his scared, trembling blue eyes focused on his concern, caring brown ones. He swallowed the lump in his throat, still hyperventilating but giving Tony his full, undivided attention. "We are going to get you out of here, alright? I am
"What do you mean?" Another sigh escaped through Steve's mouth this time. He ran a hand through his hair, turning around to face the genius.
and whenever he's around him, his heart threatens to burst out of his chest with how fast it beats around this man.
here, of all people; especially considering he was the main reason why he got caged in the first place, left to suffer at the hands of Ross and his guards.
"Because I l-love you. And you're s-so p-perfect." It made the other male smile warmly, looking down at the placement of Steve's hand on top of his own.
"Oh, right my mistake. I seem to have forgotten in my midst of searching for Hydra. Have a good day."
"Man I wish I stayed for that."
"You're right," he said sadly, watching as the soldier's expression hardened, grip on his gun tightening, "you can't exactly tell if I'm the real Tony, or just one of those fake ones running around trying to hurt you, because truth is, even the real me can hurt you." He felt tears start to form, and he did not attempt to wipe them away as he kept talking. "The real me can hurt you far worse than any fake me could; I could break your heart with insecurities alone, I could lock myself in a lab and shut you out, hell, I can even hurt you by trying to keep you safe. The real me would feel guilty thinking that I could keep you safe from the rest of the world, or whatever threatens the safety of our home, but the truth is I can't. I can't protect you from everything, because danger will always find us, and that's what I'm scared of every single time I look into your eyes. I'm scared that if I shelter you I'm just hurting you, if I let you fend for yourself I risk the danger of hurting you by trusting myself that I think you're going to be ok. I can't prove to you that I'm the real Tony Stark. So, if you want to, then by all means pull the trigger."

The scene changed and suddenly I found myself in an alleyway, the voices of everyone around me nothing but a murmur in the distance. One sound, in particular, made its way into my ear, and that was the sound of soft whimpering. My feet moved forward, the sound getting louder as I got closer to my destination. My breath hitched as I stopped walking, remembering exactly what this was I was witnessing. I watched my younger self, laying there, arms wrapped around himself, lip broken, small traces of blood where the skin on my lip was torn, quiet sobs wracking my body, and the occasional whimper that forced its way out. I never knew when to quit despite my small stature, I was always willing to let myself get beaten to a pulp by whatever bully I decided to open my mouth too.
"I need coffee. Or alcohol, whichever comes first."
"Like shit." He stated, chuckling lightly.
He was filled with hurt and betrayal, both so clear in his eyes that even Tony could see, but the genius looked at him with so much disgust in his eyes and that smug grin on his face. That was the moment his heart broke; it was in that moment that Tony used that phone he gave him for emergencies, saying how much he missed Steve and wanted to talk, only to find himself face to face with the genius and men surrounding him, pointing their guns at him as if he were prey a hunter was trying to seize, that made his heartbreak right then and there.
The pencil tip broke, and he all but lost his mind right then and there. He tried to draw, and he failed due to not being able to properly see. He couldn't grasp the concept of what he wanted to draw from his eidetic memory because he was so focused on the fact that the paper was so fucking blurry. He gave up, and slammed the book onto the floor, grabbing the pillow and stuffing his face into it. He didn't yell in anger, because he didn't want to risk causing any more damage to his already fucked up vocal cords, so he just hid his face until slowly, the anger turned into anguish.
Tony felt his heartbeat quicken, Steve's words bouncing around the walls inside of his head, touching his brain and sticking to it, knowledge being absorbed. This way Steve's first time with not just a guy, but with
"Finally putting on the finishing touches for the suit. God, it has been a hectic week for me, but what about you? Get any closer to figuring out the strange Hydra bullshit."
"So, what's your name?"
"Shit." He whispered to himself. And then the man behind all of this, Secretary Ross, stepped out of one of the black vans, dressed in an all-blue business suit, a megaphone in his hand.
"That has got to be the sappiest, and romantic thing I have ever heard. And I'm so lucky that it came from you and not someone else. I love you so much, too, Steven Grant Rogers."
"What?"
"It's fucking colder than when we first got here," Clint replied.
"Tony..." He said, softly, voice barely above a whisper as tears clouded his vision.
"H-He kept asking me where you were and I... I-I couldn't tell him that. I wasn't going to tell him where you were. S-so, then he put the collar around me and shocked me, b-but then it got worse." Tony paused for a few seconds, closing his eyes and biting his lip as fresh tears spilled from his tear ducts and down his cheek, staining his pants with small water droplets. "When the collar wasn't e-enough to make me talk h-he..." And it was painful for him to talk about it because he sobbed again, gasping for breath.
"Tony, please stop it hurts! I'll be better, I promise, just please stop!" I screamed. I shook violently as he took his finger out of the wound, a soft kiss placed on my cheek shortly after. My breathing was ragged, I struggled against the bonds around my wrists which only ended up hurting them more.
"I love you, Steve." And it was those four words he spoke, and nothing more did he cry into the other male's chest, letting himself be comforted. He didn't need the brunette to speak anything else, because despite how cold he's been, he still loves him through it all. And he allows himself to be comforted because he needs it, and he allows himself to feel loved because he misses his genius. He knows that right now things are going to be ok, but tomorrow is a different story. Right now, he doesn't want to be cold and distant, he wants to be warm and close.
"Fear is a powerful foe, isn't it?" It whispered. The sound of crushing metal resonated in Tony's ears, pressure being felt in his left forearm. He looked down quickly, noticing the vice-like grip of the fake Steve that made the metal groan and creak until eventually, it broke, bits and pieces of his suit falling onto the floor, the blue light of his left gauntlet flickering until it too, just like his right gauntlet, turned grey. The right side of his helmet was the next thing to chip away, caught in the grip of the alien, his eyes wide like saucers as it held his face, a malicious glint shimmering in its eyes.
A simple outing with Tony and both occupants learn more about each other. However, it is to be expected that some acquisitions of knowledge are off-limits, and Steve learns this the hard way.
Tony was going to give him up to Ross, and this time the Secretary was going to kill him. No, no he wouldn't be betrayed again. He had to do something, he had to get out of here. He wasn't going back and suffer at the hands of all the shit Ross had done to him back at the Raft. But he thought that maybe, for a second, he could trust Tony with his life.
"Flying is going to be a little rough, other than that, peachy. Where are you?"
like him. Caring, selfless, all the things that Tony wasn't. If that were true, then the kiss wouldn't have happened, right?
, it had to be Tony coming into his room at this hour. If Steve had no idea where their relationship stood now, he was almost
Because yes, alcohol makes everything better, right? Of course, he knows it wouldn't make anything better, he would simply get too drunk and try to avoid the situation, making a deeper hole in their friendship, and even worse, Steve might not even want to talk to him anymore. He swallowed the lump in his throat and rubbed his eyes, the insatiable itch to feel amber liquid slithering down his throat was growing at an immense level, but he wasn't going to succumb to one of his demons this time, he needed to be stronger. What he really needed to do was to apologize, but he was too emotionally introverted to actually get up from his chair and go perform the task.
He made eye contact with the creature, and he could feel all the emotions he was trying to suppress early come crawling back in a tidal wave, but the most obvious one was the anger he felt coming here, bubbling inside of him like water that was being heated to a high temperature, and before he knew it, he reached across the table and punched the alien in the face. He felt hands grab his arms, leading him gently back into the chair as they remained on him, firmly holding him back.
"Not even going to bother."
"I swear to God, Fury, if you ask us if we can get in contact with Heimdall, I'm going to strangle you," Tony said when Fury opened his mouth. The spy rolled his eye and opened his mouth to speak again.
"So, you're saying that the first mission I sent them on, was actually a ploy for these extraterrestrial beings to get information on my agents, and potentially dispose of them?"
And then the atmosphere changed, once they finished. His face contorted in confusion as his super-hearing picked up a weird sound in the distance. He tensed as it got louder, and he made out the distinct sound of a chopper making its way towards the compound.
"You seem most upset, Captain Rogers," Jarvis's disembodied voice breaking him out of his despair, "is there anything I can do for you?"
"That little witch had one job, and it was to make sure the Captain died before we made her work her way into your little crime-fighting group. Instead, she saved him and got away."
"Right, not the point." The blonde let out a huff of irritation and rolled his eyes, waiting for the genius to get to the point. "So, I was tinkering in my lab, upgrading everybody's shit, and after today I was thinking, 'hey, Capsicle doesn't seem to be happy. Wonder why?' So I thought you'd wanna hang out tomorrow?"
During those three weeks as well, Steve had been helping Tony with everything he needed without complaints. If Tony needed help in the lab with a project for SI or tinkering with his cars or simple things like needing help to eat, he was happy to help. In a way, you could say he was Tony's hands, and he was the best set of hands the genius could ask for. Not only were they helpful, but they were caring. Always caressing the back of his hand, or his face in loving gestures, just generally caring for him in any way possible. The genius's hands were still not fully recovered, but Steve at least made everything better for him.
"Alright, get on that Quinjet and as soon as you hear the words "fire" come out of Ross's mouth, you get out of here and don't look back," Tony explained, letting go of Steve's wrist, already backpedaling towards the stairs.
He still doesn't notice the genius getting closer and closer as he falls to his back, a hand clasping around his throat and squeezing with all its might. He tries to pry it off using his super strength, but the hand doesn't budge. He can feel the world spinning around him, his mouth opening and gasping for air. He doesn't notice when the pressure is elevated and he was able to take a long, hard gasp of air, and he never noticed when the spear entered the creature's body. He watched as it was lifted off of him, suspended in the air, and tossed to the side as its body returned to its original form. He noticed Tony, just shortly after he dropped the scepter, standing over him and looking pale and weak, eyes looking so distant and misty. He moved forward as the genius dropped to his knees, catching him in his arms swiftly. He noticed the wound in his abdomen, and he quickly told the others to call for help.
"You promise?"
"Oh, fuck Steve." Tony moaned, biting his lips as he let the soldier run his hands along his body in one of the most intimate ways. It sent a jolt of pleasure down his spine and towards his crotch as he let the blonde have his way with him.
"We need to go, Clint found something and it's urgent."
"Come on, come on. Stay with me, come on." He heard her say frantically. Her head snapped up to him and he noticed how scared her blue eyes were. "Please, you have to help him! He's dying and needs treatment." His heart dropped to his stomach as he scooped up the soldier in his arms, his head lazily flopping around.
"Alright, don't overdo it. You leave in ten minutes, please return safely." Fury turned his back on them, leaving the group of superheroes to prepare to save their beloved friend, Captain, and lover.
He rolled his eyes at the response and started walking over towards the once again giggling blonde. As he walked over, it gave him the time to properly look over the super-soldier. He seemed more cheerful than how he was yesterday, he seemed relaxed, less stiff, and just plain out happy. He doesn't ever recall seeing Steve this happy, not even when he first decided to stay in the tower and saw his room. Well, in all fairness to Steve, he might have been happy when he saw how plain his room was, nothing too fancy, everything was modernized and simple; no TV in his room, no remotes, just a simple room equipped with a closest, dresser, a bed, and whatever S.H.I.E.L.D. had kept after recovering him from the ice. Maybe it was too plain. Nah, Steve liked plain.
Screens appeared before Tony, and it confused him. Why was there so much data on this one mission alone? If it was just a simple reconnaissance, then there wouldn't be an abundance of information he needed to read. His eyes roved across each screen, reading a bit of information from each. His hands flew towards the holograms, moving them to the side around him, his fingers scrolling across each word, a gnawing feeling growing at the pit of his stomach. His eyes trembled as he came across an indication as to why this mission was heavily encrypted.
"Get out!" He yelled.
"Oh, come on, Steve. I've already seen your ass, it's not gonna make a difference if I-"
"Well, think about it, if the mission details are hard for even Iron Man and his AI to crack the encryption, then something must be wrong here and we've walked into a trap. Doesn't that seem suspicious to you, Cap?" In reality, Clint was right, this did seem very suspicious. It felt like they were being led into a trap, considering that throughout the week's Fury hasn't given them any form of update on Hydra since the first time they've apprehended them, something must be going on.
"Steve is going to be ok, Tony. I promise you that." Bruce spoke back just as calmly, trying to relax his friend. He knew that Tony was completely on edge, the poor guy hadn't left Steve's side.
"Why can't I know more about you? I told you a lot about me, can't I ask for the same."
"I'm not apologizing," Tony stated.
"Six, and they're all suspicious so they might come through that door soon." Friday alerts. He reaches the bottom of the step and swiftly moves towards the door, stopping for a few seconds to take a calming breath.
"It's not that I don't wanna hear it," he sighed loudly, "it's just I don't want to hurt Steve. I don't want to force anything onto him. That's not what our relationship is based on; it's based on communication, trust, love, and I want him to remember that I share these things with him. I want to earn Steve's trust so that I can be there for him. I don't want to do anything he isn't comfortable with, because that's not love."
"That he would need me to tell you guys all about how they work. He knows he doesn't own me, right?"
"You l-look like a j-jerk." He joked, making Bucky chuckle just a little.
The sounds of leather being brutally assaulted by angry fists filled the expanse of the gym. Each time Steve came down here, it helped release the anger boiling up inside of him before it tipped over. Sweat dripped down his forehead, his hair was wet, droplets of sweat splashing off to the side in the air. He panted heavily, each strike to the bag suspended in the air by a mere chain, threatening to break any second under the strength of the super-soldier. Each bag he broke, Tony always made stronger to stand up to the tremendous amount of pressure and force his punches held, but each bag met its untimely end, just like this one had suffered when Steve reeled his hand back, delivering a devastating punch to the core of the bag, unhinging it from its chain, littering the gym floor with sand. He stared at the grains of sand, a sight he was used to seeing so often whenever he needed to let off some stress, but this time around the anger still coursed through him. He fell to his knees, placing his head in his hands, a shout of anger echoing across the room, leaving no corner untouched. Usually, this was supposed to help, but it only hurt this time instead.
"I think you made Stark a little upset, Clint." Ah yes, whenever Clint was Natasha was close behind. Tony watched as she took her spot next to Clint, sitting next to him and elevating her feet on his lap, turning her head towards the movie, a small smirk on her face as well.
"Because now I know how you feel when you didn't know whether I was going to come back alive or whether I was going to die. Steve..." He trailed off, he rubbed his face to try and regain some composure before speaking once more. "Steve means a lot to me, and the fact that I don't know whether he's going to come back alive, or he's hurt kills me. I know he has the super-spy twins, Barton and Nat with him, but it's still the thought that I am not there to help him, or prevent anything to happen to him." He looked at Bruce, "you asked me if it was more than just hanging out, and honestly maybe there is something more. We kissed, believe it or not, and he's been a lot happier because of me. He smiles more and feels less lonely, but... But I can't..."
It's when he feels calloused, yet soft and gentle hands caress his face, rubbing his cheeks and lightly pushing his head up, only for lips to be placed on his own does he forget the world that is tormenting him right now. It's when the genius wraps his arms around his neck, deepening the kiss and sitting on his lap, carding his hands through his blond locks does he feel safe. It's when his hands wrap around the genius' petite waist, pulling him so close to his body that their chests are practically touching, lets the genius insert his tongue into his own mouth, pulling back only for air and looking into his eyes did he feel like things were going to be ok.
"Now that's where this whole thing gets complicated," Clint groaned as he sat up into a sitting position, "we went on that first mission which was simple reconnaissance, a mission given to us by the Director himself. We were then ordered to apprehend any Hydra agents we found, but when we did we found more than what we wanted. We found out they were using S.H.I.E.L.D. tech spruced up with their own alien technology, and then they disappeared out of nowhere." His eyes locked onto Fury, gaze cold and unwavering. "Then all of sudden, we get this mission out of nowhere, as if suddenly Hydra has been on the move again. The funny thing is that you didn't give us your usual information; ya know, the usual talk about how there was suspicious activity. Instead, it was a specified location you gave us as if you instantly knew they were there." His gaze turned to Tony standing next to him before looking at Fury once more. "Then Stark can't crack the encryption that's keeping the mission data classified, which, frankly, Director, you and I both know that Stark can easily crack any firewalls you put up, but this one was too complicated for him to get on the first try. So, it leads me to wonder if you're actually Fury, or you're just one of those things that attacked us."
He felt like Tony walked all over him, broke his heart, kicked him around a few times, and worst of all was taking his anger out on the soldier. In a way, he felt like this was Tony's own personal way of getting back at him for what he had done, and he would blame him for it, but that doesn't make it right. Steve will gladly take responsibility for his own actions and say that he, from an obvious unbiased standpoint, messed up,
The final blow never came, however. Instead, the sound of bodies rolling across the floor was heard. Tony slowly opened his eyes, the sky the first thing he sees once again from his position, the same grey clouds high in the sky which metaphorically felt like his mind; grey and thick with clouds, rolling slowly through the sky- only the sky was his mind, vast and broad, harboring many different things all at once. He groans, willing his limbs to respond to him. The pain is immense as he rolls to the side, setting every damaged nerve into sensory overload as he finds the scepter laying there within arms reach, discarded. He reaches out for it, fingers coming into contact with the metallic object, the light of the mind stone shimmering in his view. He grabs the scepter and slowly turns his head.
"Well, the way I see it, you acknowledge the fact you messed up. You got in someone's head and brought their deepest fears forth, messed with their thought process, and you seem to know the full extent of your powers. How about you use that for good?" He explained, walking back to his stool, sitting down once more but still facing her as he spoke.
"I've never been more sure of anything in my life. Steve means a lot to me, and I'll do anything to make him happy." She smiled at his words. She was wrong about this man when she thirsted for revenge. She was so caught up in what she hated about him, that she didn't learn the truth until it was too late. That she will never forgive herself for, but she is willing to move on.
"I hate to interrupt, sir, but it appears Captain Rogers is requesting access to the lab." He froze in his seat, eyes looking towards the door. Through the glass he could see Steve, standing there, fidgeting as he looked into the room. The soldier gave a small awkward smile, accompanied by a shaky wave. His eyes moved around, looking at anything he could focus his gaze on. His hands found their place on the front of his shirt, playing with the hem, squeezing at the fabric out of nervousness. It was an unusual look on Steve that Tony wasn't even familiar with seeing, but remembered that it must've taken a lot of guts for him to come down here.
Maybe it started when he woke up in this new world he has yet to become acquainted with. Yes, maybe that sounds more realistic. Encased, or rather, as anybody else would put it, sleeping in ice for 70 years only to wake up in the future where everything was so... Different. The technology was more advanced, everything was so much bigger and brighter, it was all so confusing and so much to take in. He lost his best friends, lost the girl, lost everybody he ever knew back in the forties.
The first thing he wanted to do was obviously to go on that date with him. He wanted his normal life back, not this one he has now where he's a wanted fugitive to some, mainly Ross, in New York. That's his home- well, in actuality it's the place that harbors his home back at the Avengers Compound. He wants to be able to wake up back at the compound and see his family getting up for breakfast in the morning, watching Tony be the one to always walk in last because he was tired from staying in his lab for consecutive nights. He wants to wake up in bed once more next to Tony because he had a nightmare and needed comfort, or simply because the genius wanted to spend time with him. He wants to just be at home and know that everything is going to be alright and that at least he's in a familiar environment.
"I also wanted to ask if you're free? There's something I want to show you." Steve said once he pulled back from the kiss. On the genius's own face, a smirk replaced the lazy smile he had just a few seconds ago.
is the one who's okay. He could care less about himself at the moment because the genius was the one who put himself on the front lines, willing to risk it all to help him. And really, how could the word "okay" describe all the emotions he was feeling. "Steve?"
"We're ok. Get inside the building, we'll meet you there." The corner of Tony's mouth curved upwards, a smirk plastered on his face.
"Good, let us know if you see anything."
And Tony, his sweet, supportive, understanding Tony was doing everything he could to be there for him. He kept telling him that it was going to be ok after he came back from therapy, graciously waiting just outside the room for him to be done. He hugged him, kissed his cheek, kept promising that no matter what they'll get through this together. And Steve, well he believed him, but he also just offered a small smile, a lazy hug, or a sad nod and walked away from him, and each time Tony didn't follow.
"Yes." He whispered, rather immediately. "Yes." He repeats, this time louder because he wants to hear the confidence in his voice. "Yes, Steve I'll fucking marry you!" And this time he yells it, and whether the whole world hears it he doesn't care, because all he cares about is Steve hearing it. As soon as the soldier stands up, he launches himself at him, pulling him in for a passionate kiss. Their mouths move perfectly in sync, as per usual, their tongues dance around in each other's mouths, and they pull each other as close as they can get, chests, stomachs, and everything else practically touching.
"That rhymes." Steve chuckled, causing Tony's stomach to do somersaults.
"Are you ready?" Steve asked, politely. Tony nodded his head, and Steve slowly inserted himself inside.
He descended the steps one at a time, the best he could without stumbling due to his screwy eyesight. He stumbled upon another steel door, only this one was singular and had key code needed for entry. He sighed heavily.
"Hmm?"
"It's alright, you don't need to apologize. Let's move on from that, and just know that my mom died of a disease, and all I had left was my best friend, Bucky. Bucky was always the one to get me out of whatever trouble I got myself into it. He was also the one the girl always swooned over because nobody wanted to be with a guy they could step on and was asthmatic with a medical list of whatever else was wrong with him." He sighed and started to pick at his food, his appetite was lost somewhere along the way. "After I got the serum, that's when people started to care about me. That's when Captain America was born, and the day Steve Rogers died. Nobody really remembered the ninety-pound asthmatic, they only cared about the icon of America." He leaned back and stared at his food, his appetite completely lost at this point. It was a gamble he knew he was risking in whether or not he would be ok to talk about his past to Tony, and he paid the price for it. God, he wishes he didn't open his mouth and start talking about all the depressing things that he remembers, why couldn't he just focus on the good times. Maybe because most of the good times were only before he became Captain America, right? But, if he never became who he was today, where would he be.
for Tony, willing to risk his freedom and his
"I know exactly what it's like, in case you were wondering." She said suddenly, catching Steve's attention as she kept her back to him. "I know what it's like to watch the person you care about fight for their life, I've even been in a situation where I've had to
was allowed to see.
"Pepper."
"You can take me into custody if you really want to, but right now his life is more important. We need to hurry." He nodded his head and started walking back the way they came, meeting his teammates along the way. They saved the questions for later, their main goal was to get Steve on the Quinjet and back to S.H.I.E.L.D. medical.
It was the bad decisions of him going into the lab for five consecutive days, missing five consecutive therapy sessions, that had maybe pushed Steve away from him. Now that he looks back at his actions, well, he can admit that he fucked up ever since he left. He sighs heavily and puts his head in the palm of his hands. God, he feels so stupid for what he just did.
the blanket, he kinda just slept on top of it. He shook his head and threw up his hands, not bothering with the situation anymore. He completed what he needed to do, and all that he needed to do was leave.
Thank you everyone for all the comments and kudos!
"So, Wanda," Tony said, crossing his arms and smirking at her, "what else can you do with your powers?" Her eyes wandered his laboratory, looking at every item within her sight. The corner of her mouth curved upwards in a half-smile, her hand stretching out slightly, scarlet filigree fluttering across her fingertips. He heard the groan of metal and he turned around in his stool, his eyes widening as he watched his Iron Man suit was suspended in the air by scarlet energy. "Holy shit," he said more out of awe than shock. He watched as the suit moved in all sorts of directions, coming dangerously close to crashing into other objects in his lab. As she gracefully put back his suit where it belonged, he turned around to look at her, a huge smile splayed on his face. "That is fucking sick. What else you got."
Poor Steve
," the venom was so thick in each word, much like snake venom that just one bite, if you weren't careful enough, could hurt you, "let's get one thing straight here, you betrayed me first. You choose Barnes over me; someone who has been there for you, and seen you at your best and your worse. And suddenly you forget all of that when your murderous, psychopathic best friend comes knocking down the Avengers door and you just jump straight into defending him. Must suck when someone who knows everything about you suddenly betrays you, huh?"
"Sir, you sent them out on a mission. Do you not remember?" The agent said as they tilted their head in confusion.
"You should know that Steve is unlike anybody you've ever met. He knows that things are different now, and you shouldn't try to hide them from him just because you're scared. He'll understand, you just need to let him in and say you're sorry."
The drawings he cared most about, however, were those of Tony. He opened the book and instantly landed on the first drawing he sketched on the genius. It was when he couldn't find Tony in his room that he had asked Friday where Tony was, only for the AI to notify him that he was in his lab. He brought his sketchbook with him, and Tony happily let him sit on the couch and watch him work. It was then that Steve got the chance to sketch Tony in his most natural habitat. He was working on upgrades to his Iron Man suit, leaning over the table with a screwdriver in his mouth, head slightly tilted as he looked inside the components of the suit.
When Tony returned home later that day after a few agonizing hours of doctors taking his vitals, he was allowed to go back home to the Avengers Tower. He was, however, under strict instructions from the doctors to take it easy, and that very well included fighting crime and staying in his lab for excessive hours. Normally he would complain about it, but this time around he was ok with it. The reason for this being that he would have more time to spend with Steve after all the shit they've had to deal with.
"JARVIS." He said.
"You're g-gonna pay for what y-you did to h-him." He growled. He heard the man laugh behind him, a dark, sinister laugh that sent just a slight chill down his spine, but he didn't let it show.
So he sits in his room, staring at his lap. He wants to say sorry, he wants to hold Tony close and tell him that he's sorry for pushing him away, sorry for making him sacrifice so much time and space for him. He wants to kiss Tony's lips, feeling those calloused lips on his soft ones, holding him close to his body and he forgets his problems while kissing the man who holds his heart in the palm of his hands, tending to it like a person would a wounded animal. And that's what he feels like right now; a wounded animal who needs to be cared for and nurtured back to help.
And it's pretty much the only thing he can think at a time like this because, well, he's pretty much caught between a rock and a hard place.
"You alright? Glad I followed you here after I saw myself casually strolling into this area." Fury joked. He didn't have the energy to laugh or try to wrap his brain around the situation, he just stared at the lifeless body on the ground. It started to shimmer and morph, what once was bald, dark-skinned, and covered in all black clothing, was now revealed to be a creature with fur covering the lower half of its body like pants, sharp claws on both its hands and feet, grey skin and eyes as red as rubies, its ears were pointed at the tip, and a weird set of silverish bone armor plastered across its chest.
"I don't know if you know this,
"Why is that?"
"Why?"
"I'm surprised you didn't die after that terrible fall you had, Stark." The creature snarled.
And there's a loud piercing sound in his own ears, and it takes him a minute to realize that it's him, yelling out in anguish as he drops to his knees, fresh tears fastly overflowing from his tear ducts, cascading downwards to kiss his cheeks as they leave ghostly trails. The love of his life, the man he's always cared for so deeply, and the man he always held a special place for in his heart, was lying dead on the floor, blood pooling around his blonde hair, his once vibrant blue eyes now faded, and a gun resting limply in his hand. He also took notice of his sketchbook turned upside down next to his abdomen. He picked it up slowly, turning it over, and letting out a strangled sob as he read the words scribbled as neatly as the now-dead blonde could have made them, but still slightly messy.
And yet he lays on his bed, facing the ceiling and contemplating his choices. He thinks about all the good that Steve has done for him, and everything they've been through together. And it's that word together that makes his heart flutter just a little bit because when he thinks about it more, they've always been doing things together up until this point. Even when they were separate, they were suffering together in a way, and they've made it all the way here together. It's the word alone that makes him get up from his bed and exit his room, traversing the hall once more to make his way towards Steve's room.
He thought, rolling his eyes. "Alright, Barton and Romanoff, you guys search the perimeter, see if you can find anything through this snow. Thor, you're checking the inside with me. Any objections?"
If there was one thing Steve was thankful for since arriving in the twenty-first century, it was that everything, mostly the street names, was all the same. It helped that he could remember where things were due to the streets being the same names as he remembered it, the only difference was that everything was restaurants and shopping malls. Thankfully he had Tony to guide him through the day, and take him to some of his favorite spots, too.
From the first day he left to today, the fifth day, he's done nothing but work in Shuri's lab, and listen to T'Challa give him updates on what he thinks should be changed about the accords, and about Ross himself. Each day he thinks he gets closer and closer to fixing the problem, but he gets further and further away from spending time with his super-soldier.
