After a few more seconds like that, John stepped back, determined to actually shower and not let Sherlock lure him into bed. Again. The taller man pouted but followed the blond's lead, running soap over his body. More than once, he purposefully brushed his arse over Johns waist or crotch. Without warning, John grabbed Sherlock's hips and stilled them, "Stop that or you wont be getting your surprise at lunch tomorrow."
John rubbed Sherlock's back and tried to soothe him. the closer Sherlock nuzzled, the stronger the Heat scent became. He couldn't stop his body from responding and soon the pressure in his pants was pushing against Sherlock. The brunette, already lost in his Heat, rocked down in John's lap.
A chuckle broke through James' smirk before he could stop it. "So possessive for an omega bitch. You know you're the only hole I use." James opened the door to their room and bodily tossed Sherlock onto the bed. "Present for me, bitch."
John smiled as he scented Sherlock again, adoring the smell of old books, leather, and smoke. Sherlock smiled and stretched his neck, giving John more room. The alpha scented Sherlock one last time before pulling away. "I have to get ready now, babe."
John Hamish Watson had no idea who his mother was. All he knew was that his father had met her while traveling and they'd had a brief night together that had led to his conception. His mother couldn't keep him and so he ended up being raised by his father. He'd worked nearly his entire life to help support them, since his father could only do so much. But as he grew, he became more and more attractive. The only trouble was he hardly had a dime, so no woman in her right mind would go after him. That didn't bother him much until he fell for one Mary Morstan.
"I'm a member of a sort of.....oh, what would you call it?.....A fellowship, I suppose," Captain Wiggins answered. "There's quite a few of us with a vested interest in returning you to the Wall."
The woman eyed him suspiciously, giving the bird a couple of looks too. "Perhaps what you say isn't entirely a pack of lies," she muttered before beginning to whisper to the bird. "Wait there."
"Well then, that's good enough for me, dear. Come, sit down. Dinner will be ready in just a bit," Janine told her with a welcoming smile. As the women sat together, they shared tales of transforming people into animals and other such spells. As Irene revealed her own knowledge of Janine's past, the other witch began to get more suspicious. But soon dinner was ready, the rabbit removed from the spit and split in half.
"Tell me, young man. Have you any idea what you've been carrying all this time?" Janine asked curiously.
"Nothing to worry over! Just grab on, we can pull you up," Wiggins insisted. Once they were both on the ladder and holding tight, John called back up and the ladder began to move. The shouting of sailors working to pull them up could easily be heard. Sure enough, they were soon on the deck of the ship, no worse for wear as the sailors set them down gently.
"You know, I've been thinking," John began. "After we've got you back to the Wall, to Mary Morstan......perhaps we could do what you need."
"Such rain! You should get inside the coach. No point in both of us getting soaked," Richard told him.
"I don't take passengers," Richard told him firmly as he climbed back into the driver's seat of the carriage.
"It couldn't happen," Sherlock argued, shaking his head. Suddenly, the noise became too much to bear and he looked around for the source. "What is that noise?"
"First you slide right into me, now you won't even talk to me? Well you could at least tell me your name," Sherlock scoffed. "It's obvious you came from the other side of the Wall, right? And you're searching for something. Judging by the size of this hole and where you're from, I think it's safe to say you're searching for a star, aren't you?"
The caravan continued on its way through Diggory's Dyke, heading for the Wall just like all the rest. And just like all the rest, they were waved to a stop by an old woman with white hair and wrinkled skin outside a burnt hovel of a hut. The woman was blind in one eye and hobbling as she made her way to the caravan.
"It is a frozen charm," she explained. "A thing of power. Keep still and I will show you. I touch it to your head, thus--"
Who was this man? And why had he suddenly shown up in John's yoga class? He hardly seemed like the type to enjoy yoga or even really care about his health. A quick search revealed far more than John had ever imagined though. Even just the first page was full of results.
"I was ready for you, Jim. But not for the witch," Richard sighed, not that his twin could hear him.
With a mischievous grin, John motioned for Sherlock to join him. Sherlock stripped in record time and all but pounced on John once they were standing in the steady stream of water. John chuckled, "'m surprised you're not still sore from last night. It was pretty rough." Sherlock smiled and ducked his head to scent John, relaxing into the smell. John wound his arms around the thin brunette and kissed his neck, scenting him as well.
"OK, alpha." Sherlock tried his best to look innocent as John's eyes darkened at the moniker. His fingers tightened on the omega's hips and- with careful control- ground into Sherlock's ass. He was rewarded with a low moan, a vague scent of slick, and Sherlock squirming back, trying to make it happen again. John pulled back and let go of Sherlock, turning around with a smirk to  rinse himself off.
--just in time to see Sherlock’s eyes flare. “There!” he cried, looking over John’s head, and John was left stumbling into empty air as Sherlock darted off after a small woman with light brown hair disappearing out the door.
“Oh,” Sherlock said lamely. It had truly never occurred to him that someone like Emily could be lonely.
Sherlock’s eyes met Moriarty’s and he felt his skin crawl again. He felt John stiffen beside him and turned away quickly; Moriarty must not notice John, he
1) Dr. Woodcourt was way ahead of his time. He studied under the legendary Dr. Lister at Glasgow, so he was into handwashing before handwashing was cool. His approach to sepsis was cutting edge for the period, when "feed a cold, starve a fever" was still considered gospel. Of course, in the pre-antibiotic era, surviving sepsis was more dependent on luck and how healthy the patient was to begin with than with the medical care received, but aggressive supportive care definitely had a role to play.
Sherlock blinked, looked again, and sat up. He searched the file but could find nothing else on the disposition of the account other than the notation “Emptied and closed”. Had he ever gotten the number of the account in the Channel Islands where Regal Florist’s customers were sending payment? He pulled out his phone and punched Mycroft’s number and then jumped a mile when a phone rang directly behind him.
On the third night he lay down and knew suddenly with a terrible ache of grief that there was no hope left. Sherlock was not coming back. He pushed his face into the pillow and cried, a soundless wail of overwhelming misery and despair, scouring his throat with the raw agony of it. The other boys were silent, pretending not to hear, and John was grateful for that little mercy.
John remained a moment against the wall, panting, before he straightened and looked around for something to wipe his hand. Stumbling to bed he thought once again,
“No, he’s left off. We’ll be sending up a tray as usual,” Mrs. Hudson answered. “And he’ll be going to services, and…oh, I nearly forgot, they’re all going round to see Commander Denham’s handmaiden’s new baby, so he won’t be needing lunch.”
was Sherlock. He went straight to John and sat down pressed hard against his side. John could feel him trembling and understood that Sherlock had been as terrified of their not being reunited as John had. He leaned into Sherlock’s arm a little, trying to convey solidity and reassurance.
“I believe I have expressed everything that needs to be said already,” Mycroft said calmly, looking deliberately at John before turning back to Sherlock. “But I suppose the niceties should be observed, by one of us at least, so…congratulations.”
Effie hesitated, and Sherlock felt his unease rising. “Commander Moriarty was asking the Commander if he was going to give you up. Said everyone was wondering why a rising star like him had kept you on when you hadn’t given him an heir. He was hinting a bit strong, making the Commander think it was hurting his reputation, that people might think it was down to him not being able to do the job, like. I’m not sure the Commander caught his meaning though.”
“As it happens, the information was remarkably easy to trace,” Mycroft said. “Three of the four made money transfers to the same account in the Channel Islands. The fourth was either cleverer about covering his tracks or paid in cash.”
Sherlock knew she was right, but he was desperate to remember everything and just get it over with. “Tomorrow then? Can I come tomorrow?”
Rowan put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him down, right onto the wet dirty floor, already unfastening his belt with his other hand. His cock was hard and red and Sherlock immediately stopped caring about anything else, grabbing the bar for balance whilst he took Rowan’s hip with the other. Rowan tangled a hand in his hair and pushed into his mouth. Sherlock breathed in through his nose and relaxed his throat, desperate to show off how good he could be at this, and Rowan groaned and began to fuck his throat in earnest.
“We really shouldn’t have this in here,” Molly said, taking a custard cream anyway. The machine gave a satisfied beep and she shoved the whole thing in her mouth, giving a muffled shriek as she pulled out the result.
Oh. Sherlock blinked, dropped his gaze, blinked again. It was not Mycroft he was angry at, after all. This moment of insight made him feel suddenly exhausted. Before he could talk himself out of it he muttered to the floor, “Sorry.”
“Of course I won’t, you’ll be bored stiff. Listen, I’ve got to go, but I can ring you later if you like?”
John had spent some time trying to think of a way to let Sherlock know that this new development—or rather John’s comprehension of it—was
Moriarty came back to London. Sherlock sensed him before he saw him, a creeping unease when he stepped out of the car in front of the church on Sunday. He looked up and saw Moriarty a few metres away, talking to the Bonded who ran the flower-arranging class and a teenage boy in a suit of such blinding whiteness that it made Sherlock’s eyes water. Well, well, well. A freshly-presented high society male omega. Omegas had become so scarce that this was the first boy Sherlock had seen; he wondered how long it would be before his family had him married off.
John made his rounds, leaving Sherlock’s ward until last, and finally slipped in quite late. Sherlock was still awake, hunched up on his bed with his arms wrapped around his knees, the gleam of his eyes visible in the dim moonlight. John could see the muscles of his neck working to pull in breath. He looked very weary and ill and alone until he saw John, when the brightness of his smile could have rivaled the Christmas star.
The sergeant took the soldier’s statement and documented the value of the horses--probably not even exaggerated, John thought; the double-dealing ostler at the stables had likely recognized their value more accurately than the soldier had. He thought with a pang of Hermes and Sherlock’s beloved Circe, lost to the army. The soldier finished his work, collected a receipt for the two prisoners, and left without a backward glance.
At ten o’clock they collected Sherlock, who was sulky about leaving. It took two trips to the car with the no-longer-eager researcher before they had loaded all the material Sherlock planned to go through that night.  Sherlock took one of the boxes with him into the seat and as soon as Roz started the car he said preemptively, “Shut up,” and began reading by the light of his phone.  Roz caught John’s eye in the rear-view mirror and grinned at him, and they rode back to the hotel in tolerant silence.
“No bother at all. Sherlock rang me this morning and asked if I’d meet you at the abbey gate and see that you got in all right, but I said I was coming to Harrogate for some errands anyway and I’d fetch you from the station.”
They all met up at Owen’s office: Lestrade and Donovan, several of Owen’s people, and one of Mycroft’s indistinguishably glossy assistants. Lestrade, forewarned by John, restrained himself to a brief wince, but Donovan took one look at Sherlock and said, “Oh no. That’s just not on. A pop in the mouth, sure, but
“I can’t get back that far. The amount of entropy produced in a temporal reaction is exponentially increased with the amount of time displaced, and exponentially again greater for a physical displacement than for a wrinkle. This—coming to you—it’s our last chance. If I had tried to go back any further from my point in time, it would have pushed us past the threshold of the event horizon. I didn’t even do any trials before I used this on myself to avoid bringing us closer.”
Sherlock checked his phone again—still nothing—and leaned his head briefly against the wall. It was impossible: if Moriarty was back, he had to be somewhere, someone must have seen him, but how was he back at all? Sherlock had seen him die. He had stood inches from Sherlock, looked into his eyes, and blown out the back of his head. How was he back?
Abulleyev hesitated, then jerked his head and the man beside him lowered the pipe. Sherlock was shaking, clutching at the table with his left hand to keep himself from falling. “The next opium shipment, the one that comes tomorrow—they do not take it to the warehouse, they are afraid, afraid of you that you know so they take it someplace else, someplace in Samarkand. I hear them talk on the phone, they speak in English and I speak English. They know this but I think they forget.”
Sherlock had had enough smoked salmon recently to last him the rest of his life, but he didn’t feel like talking about Norway, so he just said, “Waffles.”
“Oh Sherlock, really,” Mrs. Hudson said in exasperation. “Don’t mind him, dear, he just likes to hear himself talk. I’ll bring you up some tea, shall I?”
“You seem like someone with a feel for the music.” The voice in his ear was pitched to be heard under the noise, so only John could hear it; he could swear he actually felt the vibrations in his toes. “Fancy a dance?’
“Go put some makeup on that and stay out of the light,” Mrs. Jasper said. She hooked her arm through John’s turning him toward the door, and he felt the clink of coins sliding into his pocket. “Thank you ever so much, Captain, we won’t keep you any longer.”
“Ah,” Sherlock breathed. John followed his gaze and saw he’d been mistaken: there was something, a pale rectangle of plastic laid out neatly in the centre of the floor, almost lost in the gloom.
Two days later Sherlock found the morning-after pill in its usual place under the altar rail. For the first time, this discovery increased rather than decreased his anxiety: normally Sherlock was on a fairly predictable three-month cycle, but presumably the induced heat in April had reset the clock. Even someone as unobservant as Pitts was going to notice if Sherlock did not go into heat until July. He wondered how long it
Sherlock had never run those hills in reality. He never used to run at all, or to do any sort of workout beyond that involved in the martial arts he had studied. But now he had nothing but time, and determination; determination that if—
John looked at his watch, calculated. “Maybe, or maybe you’re just knackered. All right, let’s have a look.”
When John returned with the beer Mycroft had evidently managed to process this development and moved directly to counter it. “I’m not sure this is wise,” he said, after lifting his glass to John in thanks.
“It means twice a day,” Molly offered. Sherlock spun around and pinned her with a stare, and John watched with wry, sympathetic amusement as she froze like a rabbit, a deep red flush suffusing her face. Apparently even pale and thin in an ill-fitting uniform with a tag, Sherlock’s...Sherlockness was like being in the path of an oncoming train.
Mrs. Reilly took a ring of keys from her pocket and unlocked a cupboard, swinging both doors open wide. A knife block sat on the bottom shelf, with a clutter of cleaning supplies, some mousetraps, and a small bottle of pills on the shelf above.
Rowan laughed again, low. “Now what’s the difference in my fingers and my dick?” he said, pushing in and twisting his fingers in a way that made Sherlock thrash desperately under his hands. “And my dick is going to feel….so….good.” He thrust in again and released his grip, pumping his slick fist down over Sherlock’s purple cock, which went off like a firecracker.
Teddy nodded. “We’ll talk this evening, all together. It should be safe to come up then, and it will be much more comfortable than here. You’re all right for a bit? You can keep the light on, though best to put it out if you hear noises until you know who it is.”
He felt rather than heard the hitches in Sherlock’s breathing as he washed his hair, and his hands gentled a little. He took Sherlock’s head in both hands and held it under the water, careful not to get soap in his eyes, and felt his shoulders shaking. He smoothed Sherlock’s hair back and let his head droop slowly onto John’s shoulder, his tears hot against John’s skin.
Footsteps moved toward the door and there was a low murmuring from the corridor. Sherlock groped for the button and lowered the head of his bed so he could lie flat again.
The rumour was that those who had undergone a heat joined the red-robed ranks of the order proper, but this was hard to verify, as the novitiate was kept almost entirely separate. After Molly had gone Sherlock kept watch as best he could: from the windows when the order took their exercise, passing on the way to and from chapel. They all looked alike in their long robes and stiff head coverings, but once one of the small figures looked up, and he thought he saw Molly’s despairing brown eyes looking back at him from under the stiff wings of her headdress.
Sherlock ate the cake slowly, savoring the sweetness and licking every crumb off his fingers. “I don’t have a present for you. I was going to have a bottle of that wine to celebrate setting my plan in action—I could tell you liked it.”
“Well, that’s good, as it’s obvious I don’t wish to be shared,” Sherlock said wryly. He peered at John with mild annoyance, as though John were an interesting clue that had proven to be a red herring. “But why don’t you? The idea always excited you before. The pirates, the rugby players…”
Sherlock smiled.  “I was. But even at the beginning Movsar called me his guest. I was never mistreated, even when they thought I was a spy. Later…later, I suppose he was my friend. The only one I ever had, aside from you. But I couldn’t save him in the end.”
John turned to Sherlock and opened his mouth, but Sherlock said, “I know.” He had both arms wrapped tightly around his knees and was not looking at John. “It’s too dangerous. Just...come back right away. Please?”
Sherlock stubbornly used the hand still holding John’s to yank his furled knees closer to his body, so close he could no longer get his arm down, so he wrapped it around his knees instead. John now had the entirety of Sherlock’s long frame folded up in one arm, which for some absurd reason was not as uncomfortable as it should have been. He hugged his bony bundle close and settled his ear against Sherlock’s upper back again, luxuriating in the noiselessness of his breaths until he was lulled to sleep.
Sherlock Holmes was nuzzling John’s neck whilst John was stroking his arse and his cock and this was so far over the edge into insane John wasn’t sure he’d ever find his way back.
They shot rabbits while it was still somewhat cool, and had a picnic in the orchards, and raced, and in the heat of mid afternoon finally ended up at the ornamental lake. The cool water felt blissful on John’s hot skin. They raced to the island and for the first time Sherlock won--his greater reach gave him an edge over John’s skill.
when I’m done talking, so please bear in mind that everything I did was to try to keep you safe, because you’re too mental to do it yourself, and you’re the most important thing on the planet to me. Now can you please come over here? Because that’s about all the talking about feelings I can manage at one go.”
“So--are you worried that it’s more than just rough sex? That he’s being abused, and for whatever reason feels he can’t tell you or get out of the relationship? Or are you worried that he mightn’t understand that he’s being abused?”
“Taigh-solais,” Sherlock repeated.  “We are in position but have not made a full assessment yet. Apologies for the delay.”
In his dream he was in the hotel, the exact same hotel, only everything was different because John was there. John was holding him, his strong arms around Sherlock and his gentle hand stroking Sherlock’s hair, his love pouring into all of the cold scared empty places inside of Sherlock and filling them with warmth. “You’re not alone,” John’s voice came soothingly. “You’re not alone, I’m here, I love you. You’re not alone.”
“I would prefer that you stay down here. I would….” Sherlock took a breath and said in a rush, “I want to sleep with you.” I want to sleep in your arms. I want to wake up and have sex with you again in some form and then I would like to fall asleep with you again and know you will be there in the morning. I want you never to leave.
“She was trying to hobble you,” Mycroft said. They had reached the doorway to the library. “So you wouldn’t run away, I suppose. Fortunately she rather underestimated the tensile strength of the Achilles tendon, so no permanent damage was done.”
“Oh, I will come down from the hills eventually, never fear. But not yet. God speaks to me in dreams, you see, and it is not yet time for me to leave.”
“Obviously,” Lestrade said drily. He pulled out a final photo. “Because this note was found in the dead man’s pocket. Ink had run a bit—the paper was still damp—but it was still legible, and some bright lad in Kent remembered the broadcast finally and thought they’d best bring me in.”
The smoke was getting thicker now and John turned to shout for water but a child was already there, running down the line tossing him a wet cloth to tie around his nose and mouth. More kids and women were running with the soaked sacks. John bent to his shovel again and the firebreak was almost finished when the flames reached them, roaring greedily with the petrol that had soaked the fields.
“Well, he won’t have the chance again,” Mr. Gregson said confidently. “Lord Mycroft agrees with me on the matter of him riding, and his word is law when the Earl’s away.”
John turned over quietly and buried his hot face in his pillow. Since the night he had kissed Sherlock he had of course not touched him in any such way--there was no privacy in the wards, and at any rate Sherlock was too ill--and he had not really allowed his thoughts to wander too far down that particular path. But now--what would Sherlock looked like if John touched him like that? What would it feel like if Sherlock touched him? John shivered all over. What would Sherlock want? Would he let John...John found he could not even finish the thought; he was already so hard his cock was throbbing. He heard the boys behind him going at it again, the previous recipient now presumably reciprocating, and thought longingly of how good that long slender hand would feel. Hell, how good
Watson opened the doors and Lestrade said, “Hold on a sec,” ducking back to speak to the man driving what was apparently his car. The man nodded and drove off.
The boat bumped and stilled and John closed his eyes in relief. There was more shouting and then what seemed a great many men, lifting Sherlock and hauling John to his feet and leading him to a waiting carriage, all surrounded and cheered on by a crowd of London’s curious. Someone draped a blanket around John. It smelled of horse, a smell so familiar and comforting that John actually felt his eyes prickle. He clambered into the carriage, clutching the horsey blanket around him and trying not to drip all over the elegant velvet upholstery. Sherlock was lifted in, wrapped in still more blankets, and settled with his head on John’s lap.
“That’s because the broth is vile.” Before John could react, Sherlock swept his blankets aside and stood up. His expression of triumph lasted a half second before his legs collapsed under him and he crashed in an ungainly heap on the floor.
“Doing all right back there?” McGinty asked, glancing into the rear-view mirror. “We’re okay on time if you need to stop.”
Sherlock stood still in the center of the room. This was somehow worse than the last time; he felt flayed, as though every inch of him that had been pressed to John’s warmth had been left raw and exposed. At least I’m dry, he thought, trying the thought on for reassurance, but there was no comfort in it, and no matter how close he got to the fire he could not seem to get warm again.
“It’s a PR victory, nothing more,” John told Sherlock. “The NeoTories will get a huge boost from bringing sugar and tobacco in, but the truth is we’re barely hanging on over there—we’re hemorrhaging soldiers to Canada faster than we can bring them in. Mexico y Centroamerica is only just now beginning to stabilize and they’ve got no military to speak of, and what they do have is all deployed south now that Brasilia’s eyeing the Panama Canal. They’re no threat to Texas. If anything, probably the brass is hoping that this will distract Texas enough to keep them from taking the Colonies themselves, which they could in a heartbeat if they wanted to.”
“That sounds a little thin,” Lestrade said dubiously. “You think this Peter Reynolds is Ricoletti because some of his paintings look like Ricoletti’s from forty years ago?”
Sherlock blinked several times in rapid succession and then said, “If we could get back to my tale…”
“The Adventure of the Copper Beeches” is another of those ACD canon stories that are just crying to be updated…although if the show can work out a believable way to stash someone in the attic these days I’ll be beyond impressed.
Mrs. Hudson heard the water running and brought up a fresh tea tray—Sherlock had waved off the last one—and Sherlock gobbled down the tea and biscuits as he scrambled around the flat, looking for his shoes and explaining with his mouth full that his house arrest hadn’t been lifted; he was just going for a drugs test.
When they were both satisfied that the flat was clean, Mrs. Hudson took herself back downstairs for her tea and telly and Sherlock rang Lestrade.
“Fuck,” John gasped, feeling Sherlock’s cock sliding against his. He grabbed for Sherlock’s arse again and ground up against him, pulling up forward so that his cock could slip free and rub up against his entrance. Sherlock moaned. John flailed an arm in the direction of the lube, but he couldn’t quite reach, and Sherlock was already getting heavy. John heaved him over and pulled him in with one arm, reaching for the lube with the other, and kissed Sherlock sloppily as he pressed one finger in. As he’d expected, Sherlock immediately went still and pliant, tucking his head into John’s neck and gripping his back as John worked him open. He had one leg flung around John’s waist again, and John could feel his cock throb and jerk against him whenever John touched a particularly sensitive spot. Who would have thought Sherlock could be so randy? John marveled. Not to mention so willing for John to take control.
“Hmmm,” Trevor said, looking mildly interested for the first time. “I’d need something bigger than the magnets I’m using now…”
“I don’t think so.” John frowned. “I think he started off playing the guitar, but maybe he wasn’t a very good musician?’
“Don’t be an idiot. I don’t want a normal person.” Sherlock’s body was a tight knot. Brilliant, now John had made him self-conscious. “Hey, Sherlock.”
“It’s a long shot and it’s going to take some time, but it’s all I’ve got right now. Are you doing okay?”
“Oh fuck,” John said, head falling back and pushing back against Sherlock’s thrusts. “Do it, come on, I want to feel you come inside me, give it to me,” and Sherlock did, crying out and pushing up with all his strength as John slammed his full weight down against him. John groaned again at the feel of Sherlock’s cock spasming inside him and fell forward over Sherlock, bracing himself with one hand as he pumped himself hard with the other, and then Sherlock felt him clench tightly around him as he came, wringing a burst of aftershock from Sherlock’s spent prick.
“Mmm.” Sherlock began walking backwards, pulling John with him toward the bed. “I’m looking forward to finding out. You know how curious I am…”
“Sherlock,” John said patiently. “We’re men. You’ve the same equipment I do, and it’s on the outside. It’s very obvious when you’re interested and when you’re…not interested, and you’re not interested.”
Sherlock pulled his arms over his head and stretched. He was longing to talk his findings through with someone more responsive than a black-and-white picture, longing to get to Houston U-Store-it and see what was in Wayne Ellis’ unit, longing to talk to Wayne Ellis himself. Also, he needed to piss again, and he probably needed a shower. It struck him suddenly that it was Christmas night and he’d managed to get through most of Christmas already.
Sherlock stood quietly, eyes still closed. He felt intensely aware of everything, every cell and molecule in his body: he could feel the vibration of the music against his eardrums, the prickle of the starlight on his skin.
“I was quite glad to hear from you, as it happens,” Kitty said. She nodded to Sherlock in greeting and said, “I always rather felt I owed you an apology as well as thanks. You were right—as soon as I started asking questions, Jim Moriarty vanished. I never heard from him again. I tried to interest the editor I had back then in an investigation, but he was only interested if I could tell him Moriarty’d shagged someone famous.”
“I don’t know about that,” Gregson said, leaning back amiably. “I feel much the same, but I was born to the work. Maybe if I’d been born in Plymouth I’d think I was a seaman instead of a horseman. What about you, John? Were you brought up with horses?”
The sudden loud noise startled John so badly that he leaped, losing his balance again. He pinwheeled backward and came up coughing, shaking water out of his eyes, and struggling to get to his feet. Sherlock, already standing, was wading furiously toward the shore.
A burst of muffled laughter. Sherlock, hands cold and face burning, stood and walked over to the bench where the chemicals were kept. He deliberately bumped a full flask so that it tipped and crashed onto the bench, spattering the floor and his clothing liberally with acid.
“Thank you,” John said, pleased. He opened up the book and looked at the picture opposite the title page, which showed a pirate menacing the reader with a raised sword and a leer. It did look exciting. He set it carefully on the little table. “Are you staying?”
Sherlock drew himself up to his full height and looked haughtily back. “I know exactly what meeting it is. I’m here from Mr. Phelp’s office with important papers.”
“Well, I’m glad you being a drugs kingpin serves a larger purpose,” John said dryly. John was not happy with this facet of Sherlock’s growing criminal empire, although the actual operations were overseen by an unprepossessing but undeniably clever lieutenant named Wiggins. Sherlock had also taken over a counterfeit ring in Thamesmead, which he couldn’t help tweaking so that it ran more efficiently.
” Sherlock gasped from the floor. “Your daughter—you can’t—“ His face was streaked with tears. John stared at him, agonized, and another flash of lightning lit the room.
Mycroft patted his back gingerly and disentangled himself, but John had the impression he was not displeased. “It has been surprisingly…helpful,” he said with his usual formality, “to have had you in the loop. So to speak. I confess that I apprised you of the situation more out of a sense of indignation at your ignorance than anything else, but your support has been…” his smile seemed even more like a grimace than usual. "…not unwelcome.”
Mitch peered at the screen. “No, that’s North Dakota…shit, it practically is in Canada. You might as well just go to Denver, it’s not much farther. You want another drink instead?”
John rolled his eyes and said, “Right. Bit more work to do, I think,” and carried the bulging stachel out to the horses. “Don’t get on yet, I want to check the girth.”
John hugged him tightly. “He would have done it as many times as it took,” he said. “That’s how it works.”
a lying cheat. She already has a child, she’s financially stable and objectively good-looking so she could probably find an adequate replacement fairly quickly. Why would she want to hang onto him? Why do people get so
“Take it easy today, all right?” John said. “Tell Lord St. Whatsit you need a couple days before you go chasing around London after his wife.”
Teddy sat up in his cot halfway down the room, took a loud breath, and screamed. He then proceeded to carry on impressively, wailing and tearing at his hair and babbling frantically so that John’s ears were fairly ringing by the time Mr. Brocklehurst threw open the door in a rage. “What is the meaning of this?” he snapped.
Mrs. Hudson refilled his coffee and settled opposite him with her own, unaware of Sherlock’s existential crisis. “The bathroom’s all right, mostly, but there’s no water of course, and no electricity either. There’s the bath in 221C though. I gave it a good clean yesterday so you’ll be able to use that, and I brought down your things.”
That got a smile out of her, as he knew it would. She really did have a lovely smile. “Don’t go soft on me there, Freak,” she said, which made him smile a little in return.
” and the whole long line of him convulsed as he shuddered, cock jerking and pulsing in John’s hand. John pushed up a little to get a better angle, shoved the pillow back in place, and slammed himself into Sherlock’s still-quaking body, harder and harder until he saw stars and the entire galaxy seemed to explode across his vision. The only drawback to this position, he thought hazily as he folded over, was that there was no easy way to simply collapse afterward. He ended up more or less shoving Sherlock off of himself and then tipping over to land on his side.
“Okay, put her through,” Rodriguez said and said to the others, “It’s the secretary at Planet Baby, I’m putting her on speaker.”
“I never…I’ve never had anything like this.” Sherlock’s fingers flexed, then curled back around John’s. “I thought I never could. I don’t…I still don’t know if...”
Inside Sherlock found himself in a short low-ceilinged passage: evidently the lighthouse had had a bigger light put in at some point, and the builders had simply constructed a second tower around the first. The whitewashed interior seemed dim and quiet after the wind and bright sun outdoors. In the center, a wrought-iron staircase twisted dizzyingly upward in a narrow spiral. Sherlock found the corners of his mouth twitching upwards in spite of everything: a whole lighthouse all to himself! Get on with it, he reminded himself again
Trevor’s flat was small and sunny, surprisingly pleasant, with a kind of barely-lived in tidiness. Sherlock had never seen her rooms at Oxford and he prowled around curiously, but there wasn’t a lot of information to be gleaned: she’d played the piano as a child, apparently did some yoga with DVDs, and ate a lot of frozen dinners. There were books everywhere, but the cozy little window seat seemed never ever to have been sat on. The place needed a cat, Sherlock found himself thinking.
that’s the case,” Mycroft said. “We don’t know for certain. At any rate, someone knows who she is and sold that information to Magnussen. Magnussen then apparently sold it to someone else, or planned to do so. There are people in this city who would be very interested—or very threatened--by the knowledge that one of James Moriarty’s former high-ranking staff members is alive and well.”
By the time the other boys came pounding up the stairs John was half drunk and half angry and thoroughly miserable. It was easier to feel the anger than the pain, which he thought might destroy him, so he had kept feeding the anger with the gin. Now he replaced the bottle in its hiding place and headed for the washroom, almost hoping someone would jostle him so he had an excuse to start a fight.
The beta looked genuinely insulted. “Angie!” he shouted over his shoulder. “Bring me a little jar of the Dundee and be quick about it.”
“They’ve got his measure, missus,” Old Tom spoke up unexpectedly. “That boy is a bad one. Always whinging and beating his pony with the crop, when he learned to ride, and I still see him throwing rocks at the dogs.” Old Tom’s opinion of most people was much the same as Sherlock’s, but he loved animals and could not abide cruelty.
She smiled down at him in genuine happiness. “But I don’t know it yet,” she said. “Ask your brother.” And then she was up and running, leaving Agra behind just as she had left Anna Grace so many years ago, running over the grass in the dazzling sunshine to the helicopter that would take her to her bright new life.
“I don’t think so,” John said quietly. “After what happened a few years ago, I think he just wants to be careful. And then all that with the revolutionaries--”
“We’ll need the farrier out soon anyway—Leviathan’s got a shoe loose now,” said Davy, and Gregson groaned.
Sure enough, Moriarty sent a far more conciliatory message. Things had gotten a bit out of hand. Clearly it was in both of their interests to work together, was it not? There was a fair bit of back and forth but they both agreed a meeting was in order, preferably at a neutral location. In the end the meeting was set for the Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh, a week hence.
“Well, with your poor mum and all.” She gave beamed sympathetically and patted his hand. “I do hope you find him.”
“Should be safe then.” Beth nodded, and the rode on for a bit. “You were littermates,” Sherlock observed. “You miss her.”
“When did you realize?” John asked. He was genuinely curious, although he had no idea why Moran seemed happy to just stand around spilling this story like the villain in a poorly written film.
As they pulled out, John saw more kids crossing the stableyard, some headed for the cars and some toward the stables. A girl on a horse was already trotting off down the road.
When they were back at the abbey John asked, “Do you want to talk about it?” and Sherlock threw him a look strikingly reminiscent of Mycroft’s
“No, I’m—a cup of tea, if you don’t mind,” Sherlock said. It was Molly’s lunch break, but she might not go if he didn’t want anything. “And a pastry if they’re fresh.”
“Thanks. I’m doing all right.” The first week or so had been dreadful, a nightmare of guilt and exhaustion and
By the time they got back to Baker Street John’s exasperation had mostly faded, and relief had won solidly out over disappointment. Yes, it would have been fun to bang Liam into submission, and missing Gerard’s Clydesdale-sized dick was definitely one for the loss column, but everyone fucking Sherlock? John was not remotely unhappy about skipping that. He would have gone along with it, of course, if that was what Sherlock wanted, but…why
“Oh sweet Jesus,” Michael gasped. “Sorry, breaking my own rules, I’m trying to hold back but you’re just—“
“Sherlock,” John said, biting his cheek to keep from laughing, “What are you doing? Is that a tricorder?”
“Indoor ski centre. I took the kids once, awful. So last Sunday afternoon he was found dead in the back garden of an employee at the Adventure Centre, one Sigrid Ekland.“ Another photo, this one of a young blonde woman.
Sherlock frowned. For a moment he’d thought it was John’s voice, but it wasn’t, and it certainly wasn’t Moriarty’s. It was his.
“I took out three.” Bruce whistled, impressed, and Sherlock waved a hand his uniform to illustrate the benefit of disguise: “The first one was the hardest.”
“I mean he was literally sniffing,” the dark-haired young woman standing by the bank of crime-scene lights said, glaring at a young man who was handcuffed next to her. “Bloody creepy.”
Sherlock inched back a few steps. He pushed his hair up under the beret as best he could and pulled the beret low over his face. Then he checked his gun to be sure the safety was on—he would fire only as a last resort, a gunshot would be heard all over the point—and set off down the road at a fast clip. He heard the man straighten, turning, and he picked up to a near jog with his head still lowered. The man said quickly, “I’ve been watching, there’s been no—“ and then Sherlock ran straight up and hit him in the gut with the butt of the gun.
Sherlock told them. Now that he’d gotten some distance it all felt a bit unreal, like something that had happened long ago, which he supposed it had. Trevor leaned her forehead on her hand, a gesture of startling drama for her. “The
A full-body shudder ran through Sherlock and he arched against John, eyes falling closed and baring his throat. “Yours,” he rumbled in his deep throaty purr. John kissed him deeply and thoroughly and then scraped his teeth all down the length of his neck, biting at his collarbone where no one would ever see the mark. Sherlock was panting and writhing now, rutting the length of his erection against John’s thigh. John let go Sherlock’s wrists and slid down to align their cocks, which felt much better without their nightshirts and drawers in the way, and gave into the desire to just grind against him for a bit. He rolled them to their sides so he could grip Sherlock’s arse, which made Sherlock thrust against him frantically.
Back in Exeter he bought a cheap bouquet of flowers from a market stall and slipped into Trevor’s building behind an elderly woman clutching a string bag. He picked Trevor’s lock in no time; it was a skill he’d acquired as a teenager, although he didn’t often get to use it. Sherlock realized suddenly that he was enjoying himself. Maybe when all this was over he could turn to a life of crime, since he’d clearly be brilliant at it.
what he wanted. “I said no,” John said sharply, stepping into Mycroft’s face. “Do you really think we’ve never discussed this? Almost six years together, in hospital twice, and you think somehow it just never came up?
Sherlock’s relationship to the servants was somewhat murky. He was unquestionably their social superior, but also in effect their prisoner, and no one seemed to know how to treat him.  Phillips responded with automatic deference to any tone of authority—rather like a dog, Sherlock thought—and the guards mostly ignored him; the maids always seemed torn between subservience and sniggering, and Mrs. Turner treated him as she might a spoilt child. “What do you want, Brother Bathsheba?” she said impatiently, hands on hips.
Dimmock sighed the deep sigh of a man being kept from actual detective work to chase the ephemera of Sherlock Holmes and said, “I’ll get back to you.”
Donovan shuffled papers, looking for dates, and after a minute she nodded. “I see what you mean. Thanks loads, the both of you—I’ll get on Skype with her tonight and tell her what you came up with.”
“Yeah?” John inched the small bottle out from behind the others. Hydrocodone. The label listed ten tablets; John tipped the bottle trying surreptitiously to count how many remained. Had to be close to ten.
On the train, Sherlock immediately wrapped himself in his coat, leaned against the window, and fell asleep. John sat for a while with his notebook unopened on his knees, watching him. Sherlock looked drawn and tired, and John had the uncomfortable suspicion that it was not entirely due to the three days of running about on the moors. Sherlock had been hardly sleeping at all lately. Even between cases he was staying up all hours, working on his polyphonic whatever-it-was, which had apparently morphed into a colossal composition project. On the other hand, the crashes were getting more frequent. Every time Sherlock came back from Moran’s…
Sherlock bared his teeth in a sneer, seeing John’s fist come up for the coup de grace as he opened his mouth, but to his surprise he heard his own voice say, “Don’t leave.”
Back on his feet. Sherlock had no idea where he was going; his initial plan had been to head east to the sea and hope to find a boat that would get him out of the country, but he had lost all sense of direction and didn’t even know how to find the north star had the night not been entirely dark. He was just trying to cover ground now. Sherlock trudged on, too weary to run, following the hedgerow until he came out onto a narrow gravel road. He considered, then crossed to the middle of the road—he’d hear an oncoming car for miles on this gravel, and any exhaust would help make his scent—and broke into a half hearted run again then for a half mile or so until his feet slowed of their own volition.
The alphas cock twitched and hardened more as he scooped Sherlock up and started towards the stairs. "You've put on weight. Don't or else I might knock you up."
"When your Heat starts, I'll be right there." He turned around and scented Sherlock again, looking for the vanilla scent of Sherlock's imminent Heat. "We have another day and a half at least before you'll even notice." Sherlock rolled his eyes and began washing the soap from his body. "Don't forget to eat. You're going to lose weight during your Heat and I don't need you too malnourished to carry a baby if I can finally knock you up."
"You aren't ready until I say you are." James bent down and scented Sherlock. He growled possessively as he smelled John's alpha scent entwined with Sherlock's smooth, smoky scent.
Sherlock struggled not to move away. He loved James but didn't want to break his bond with John. He loved them both and didn't want to choose one over the other. Slick started to drip out of the raven haired omega at the display of dominance. "Please, alpha. Upstairs..."
James Moriarty chuckled and moved to pull Sherlock into a sitting position. "Traffic. Strip for me." Sherlock hurried to comply, pulling off the silk and tossing it to the side. "Good boy..." James let his eyes wander across Sherlock's pale chest down to his small, omega cock.
Sherlock felt slick start to gather as James called him a good boy. He shifted closer to the edge of the couch, not wanting to stain it and leave evidence John might find. "Alpha... I'm ready for you." He glanced towards the stairs leading to the spare room -their room.
After nearly thirty minutes of filling Sherlock with his seed, Jim's knot went down enough to pull out. The moment he did, come started dripping out of Sherlock and James quickly pressed a large plug into Sherlock to kept it all inside. They had a handful of toys stashed in the side table and he had grabbed the plug while Sherlock was moaning on his knot.
James turned them carefully, trying not to tug on the knot keeping them close. He bit his lip each time another wave left him and filled Sherlock. "My rut... it starts the last day of your heat. I  want to spend it with you. Need a sloppy hole that doesn't mind it rough."
Sherlock grinned sleepily as he stretched out and clenched around the plug. "Full..." he mumbled, pressing his face into the pillow.
"Yours... your whore!" Sherlock whimpered, sinking onto his elbows to change the angle in hopes of James hitting the small bundle of nerves again. "More... please, alpha!"
Jim spent almost twelve hours fucking himself deep into Sherlock. he knotted the omega nineteen times before being physically unable to.  Sherlock woke four times to Jim pressing into his leaking, sloppy hole. But they both knew twelve hours was their max.
"Alpha, please. I need you. I need to feel you pounding into me. Please!" Sherlock kept begging as James added a third finger.
The moment Jim slammed into him, Sherlock was already moaning. He gripped the sheets below him as Jim began pounding into him. The alpha was longer and thicker then John but was aiming for his own pleasure instead of Sherlock's. He went harder and hit Sherlock's prostate, making him cry out.
Sherlock whimpered softly at the growl and titled his head submissively, baring the spot that was decorated with John's mating mark.
John kissed the mating mark on Sherlock's neck before getting out of the shower and wrapping a towel around himself. The omega followed suit, turning off the water and leaving John in the bathroom to get ready. He went into the bedroom and threw on one of John's jumpers, hoping the sight of him in it would persuade John into staying. Once it was on, Sherlock tugged on boxers and went into the living room, picking up his violin.
"Sherlock, i want to help those people. Its only a 24 hour shift. I'll be back before noon tomorrow."
Sherlock kept his eyes closed as the other man strode into the flat and over to Sherlock. Only when soft lips slammed against his own did Sherlock acknowledge the man. "Took you two minutes longer than usual, James."
James moaned as Sherlock talked about being bred up, his biology telling him to bite and claim and breed quickly. He raked his nails down Sherlock's side and pushed in harder, forcing his knot into the omegas tight, wet hole. He gasped as his knot instantly caught and he came with a groan.
Sherlock pouted and wrapped his arms around the back of John's neck, "Or you could stay in bed with me." He smirked and hooked his leg on his boyfriend's waist. "I can make it worth your while." John chuckled and slid one hand up the leg around his waist, stopping as his fingers curved around Sherlock's ass.
Not even fifteen minutes after John had left to go save lives, a key was turning in the door to 221B. Sherlock sprawled across the couch, dressed now only in his silk dressing gown. Johns jumper was carelessly tossed into their shared room and the room upstairs, which john thought only housed Sherlock's experiments, was ready.
Irene just shook her head. "No, I can no longer find you in my mind, you see. Not long ago, you burned - your heart burned - in my mind like silver fire. But after that night in the Inn, it became patchy and dim, and now it's not there at all."
"Why, whatever possessed me to cut that hare in two and toss half away? What could I have ever been thinking off? Must be getting old, bird," she huffed, starting to clean up. Hearing a bit of chattering and squeaking, she looked over and saw a squirrel. "And as stupid as that squirrel. Look at him. Digging that acorn he's found into the grassy bank. He'll forget where he's put it, you know, and it'll grow into another oak tree.....Ah, we'd best be going before we forget where we're headed."
"Yes, and if the tabloids can confirm it, your family can see it, and then they'll all know you're not so straight that a stripper's pole would be jealous of you," the brunet scoffed. "We both know what's really bothering you, John. You don't want people to know you're bisexual and not straight. You think they'll all assume you're gay because you're with a man now. And you're probably right. But even still, do you really want to hide our relationship? We've both waited for so long to have this. Why should we bother hiding it? It's no one's concern but ours."
"It was your right not to kiss me," John argued. "I didn't come here to make you sad, Mary. I didn't find you your star to make you miserable."
Richard smiled. "Welcome, brother," he added. "We've waited to be reunited. Now our time here is done. You are the last."
Sherlock frowned, sitting up. "No, he isn't. And I am not moving on. I.....I think I love him, Mycroft. And I'm not giving him up," he argued. "One day we're going to get married, whether Mummy and Dad approve or not."
John looked at well and chuckled when he realized Sherlock meant he was getting hard. "I think I can find a way to release that," he purred, then followed as Sherlock began moving to his bedroom. Before long, the pair were doing more than just yoga. But they were right. It did release Sherlock's 'tense muscle' and they ended up falling asleep shortly afterwards.
"Steady, steady," Jim muttered to himself as he crept closer. Against his hip was a club of oak, brass nails studding the head. He listened at the door until he heard the woman snoring, then snuck into the bedroom. Uncorking the brandy, he poured it and lit a lucifer. Before long, the hut was engulfed in flames. Jim walked out easily, smirking as he examined his club. "Either she'll burn alive inside her hut, or she'll run out and get bludgeoned by my club. Either way, my debt will be fulfilled."
"They're asking for you down at the Wall. Young lady wants a word with you," the animal informed him before leaving.
"Mmhm. Well.....there are a number of things I must say, John," Mary told him, the words flat and clearly rehearsed. "Firstly, I must apologize to you. It was my foolishness that sent you on your journeying. I thought you were joking, that you were too much of a boy ever to follow up on your fine, silly words. It was only when you had gone and the days passed that I realized you had been in earnest, and by then it was much too late."
He lost his train of thought as John's hand wrapped around his length, stroking it gently. Sherlock's breath caught for a moment before he let himself relax, letting John handle everything. But eventually, his knees began to get weak and he moved them to the bed where they could both be more comfortable.
"Which will act as a counterbalance to the lost high I get from the drugs," Sherlock interrupted grumpily, glaring at the doctor. "I'm not going. I'm not quitting. Just release me and let me be."
"I, uhm," Janine stammered. "There's a servant girl who I keep in the form of a large bird. And a young man in the form of a dormouse."
Sherlock sighed, not even bothering to look for clothes anymore. He had to come clean and tell John what was going on. It was only fair. He couldn't keep this up for another two years, or for the rest of their lives.
"Sinful 'v' right here, absolutely tantalizing every time I see it. Especially when you wear those low hanging trousers," John hummed with a soft chuckle. "And then there's my favourite bit of you. Your cock is absolutely gorgeous. I can't believe I've gone so long without seeing it. I've felt it and I had a picture in my head, but this.....it's so much better than I ever imagined. So long and lithe. Just like the rest of you. I.....Can I?" he asked, a hand reached towards Sherlock's dick.
"Well they're clearly all idiots. You're bloody brilliant. Not to mention your flexibility. Honestly, I've never met anyone so naturally flexible. So hopefully with some guidance, you'll catch on in no time," John assured. "So why don't we get started? We'll just do some chants to start and relax, yeah?"
"All right now, lad. Let's see what your problem is," John hummed, going to see the horse. "Let's see if we can't find some warm oats and bran for--" He was cut off as he saw it was the unicorn that had been carrying the Star. As he opened the stall, the unicorn moved to block his exit. "The Star is here! He is the other guest! You have to let me past! I need to talk to him!" he insisted, but the beast refused to move, instead sniffing at the mug of burnt ale. "What is it? Is something wrong?" John asked, groaning as the unicorn stuck its horn in his drink. "Oooh, that's a waste," he huffed, but frowned and watched as the ale began to turn a sickly green and bubble. He recalled a story his mother had told him as a child about the horn of a unicorn. A powerful sovereign against poison indeed. "Poison....my drink was poisoned.....and Lord Richard and the Star are inside the inn! Let me through, please!"
"Simple. You're listed as Dr. John H. Watson at the health club. Clearly medically trained. Seeing where your eyes go during most yoga classes, you clearly watch for any signs of actual health or physical trouble during each pose. There's also your tan line and the bags under your eyes, your limp, and your war injury," Sherlock rattled off, then went on to explain. "The tan line clearly suggests time abroad, but not for pleasure. You weren't sunbathing, you were wearing full length sleeves the entire time. Coupled with the psychosomatic limp and the bullet wound on your shoulder, it wasn't hard to piece together that you were a soldier. And with your medical knowledge and the fact that you are currently a yoga instructor and not a doctor suggests that you were an army doctor recently invalided home who took up yoga to help with a war injury and now teaches."
The shock Sherlock can feel register on his face is reflected in John’s reaction. His features crumple for a moment.
Sherlock leads them down the lane, past the church and over a small bridge before turning into the woods through a tiny white gate. The morning light is making the haws and rosehips glow like garnets and rubies in the hedgerows. There are blue-black sloes too, tucked away inside branches of long thorns. John is reminded of long ago holidays with his grandparents who lived out in the Styx. He hasn’t thought of them in some time and he finds himself smiling at the memories.
Sherlock arrived the next day fully prepared for class, even though he wasn't quite sure what to really expect from this man. He'd researched the instructor after spotting his name in the directory at the front of the health club: Dr. John H. Watson. Seeing that he was an actual medical doctor made Sherlock feel a bit more trusting of the man since he wasn't just some spiritual guru who would tell him his addiction could be cured by chanting or something like that. He may actually be able to help. So here was the detective, wearing what he was told was normal attire for a yoga class. After his research confirmed it, he'd purchased spandex trousers and a loose-fitting tank top, walking into the class barefoot as most suggested that was the best way to do yoga. Mats were provided in the class, so he didn't need to worry about that.
"My sisters will be harsh, but cruel. However, I appreciate the sentiment. You have a good heart, child. Pity it will not be mine," Irene sighed before leaving.
her dwelling place. Smoke rises from the chimney. And there she is again," Jim muttered to himself, watching as an older woman hobbled out of the hut. He'd been watching her all day now, noting how she stopped every traveler who came through on their way to the Wall. "She seems harmless enough. But I have not become the only surviving male member of my family by trusting appearances. This woman killed Richard, I'm certain of it. And the obligations of revenge demand a life for a life."
"It would seem so, dearie. Now why don't you tell me where you're off to in such a hurry?" she hummed.
"I'll show you. Mary, I'm going to bring back the best birthday present you've ever had. And then you'll have to marry me!" john declared. And he knew just what to get her: a star. A star had fallen just a little while ago and he was certain he knew where it had landed. He would find it and bring it back to Mary. And then she'd finally marry him. It would be perfect. So off he set on his adventure.
Sherlock hated his body. He always had and he was convinced he always would. He was too tall, too bony, too angular, too pale, too everything. And after he came home from Serbia, he now had scars lashed across his back to hate. There was nothing about is body that he liked, but he'd never told anyone that. No one would believe him anyway. Everyone seemed to think he was the perfect embodiment of sex on legs, but he just didn't see it. And now there was John.
"John.......I hate my body," Sherlock admitted, finally turning towards the man. "I hate it. Absolutely loathe it. It's hideous to me and that's why I've never let you see me naked. I want to have sex with you, I do. But I can't stand for anyone to see me naked. I hate seeing myself that way and the idea that anyone could find me attractive once they've seen the whole of me is just implausible."
He knew quite well that some of his students faked difficulty with some of the poses just so he would touch them and guide them, but he did it anyway just to be a good teacher. If someone needed help, he would do it. After a while, he became well known for being a strict teacher who could properly push people to their limits without being a complete arsehole. He was well liked by everyone at work, employees and students alike.
As dawn approached, John woke to a snuffling noise by his head. Sitting up, he groaned and rubbed his eyes before gasping softly. A badger stood by him, walking on its hind legs with a coat and hat.
Sherlock stared at the magic rope in disbelief, then scoffed. "But of course! Nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped, injured man!"
John, meanwhile, was riding beside Richard and occasionally glancing back inside the carriage. He was convinced that someone was there, though the driver hardly seemed to acknowledge them. Five grey gentlemen sat inside the carriage and bickered with one another and finally, John got up the courage to ask about them.
Sherlock swallowed hard yet again as John continued. Sooner or later, John would reach his crotch and see the most horrific part of him. He'd run for sure then, and he certainly wouldn't kiss it.
opening the cage, Janine set the mouse inside and closed the door. "See, bird? I've kept my promise to the letter," she huffed as the bird chirruped in response. "And after we reach the Wall, I'll turn the boy back to a human and do the same for you. I still need to find a better servant."
Sherlock nodded, though he was still a bit nervous. Maybe John wouldn't like how it looked when he came. Maybe he wouldn't like it when it was hard. Maybe....
"Come on. I need to. There's something out there and I have to get it, for this girl," John insisted.
Mary was a bit surprised, but she and John had talked about this when they first started the relationship. She knew he was with Sherlock and was trying to hide it by showing up with her in public places. And she hadn't expected him to break the news like this. But she was happy for him that he could finally be himself.
"Oh my......" John began, jaw dropping as he saw it. A ship, floating through the sky as though it were the sea. "Overhead! And behind us! It's a ship! A ship of the air!"
"John....I missed you," Sherlock purred, getting out of the bed with tousled hair and coming over to snog John against the wall. "Why don't you let me show you how much?"
"Now, now, I'll not have you bothering the other guests, milord," Irene insisted. But Richard has already noticed several things amiss.
Sherlock turned, raising a brow as he saw the blond coming towards him. Wasn't that... "John," he greeted with a nod. "John Watson, correct? Of the infamous Watson-Holmes feud."
"Only the risk of the clouds disappearing into nothing. They do that, you know," Sherlock told him. "I could not survive another fall."
The woman stretched as she was finally allowed to be in her true form, but was soon given orders and forced to work for the witch. The silver chain she'd worn as a bird remained with her now, tying her to the caravan.
Jim laughed, almost as though he'd heard his dead twin. The sound echoed throughout the empty, bloodstained mountains, surely terrifying anyone who heard it.
"Why?" John questioned, but was soon quieted. Listening with the star, he heard a distant whinny followed by a roar. "It's coming from up ahead!"
They ended up spending a great deal longer talking once they'd rolled up their mats, trading stories about war and drugs, about teenage years, ambitions, dreams, broken hearts, injuries, and more. John learned more about this curly haired beanpole than he'd ever thought there could be to a single person. There was such a deep story there and John just had to turn the page and find out more. He loved learning about the detective and eventually the topic was turned to sex.
The witches were Molly Hooper, Sally Donovan, and Irene Adler. Without the magic contained in a star's heart, they were all old, ugly hags. But as soon as even a sliver of the heart was consumed, they could be beautiful, vivacious women again. Unfortunately, it wasn't every night that a star fell. So when one did, they had to rush to get it. There was only enough left this time for one of them to make the journey, so Irene went. Eating what was left of the last star they'd captured, she regained her youthfulness and beauty before leaving to find the first fallen star for the past 200 years. Molly and Sally remained in their cottage, preparing for when the star would be brought to them for the removal of her heart.
John blushed deeply before deciding to be bold. He leaned forward and pressed his lips against Sherlock's, kissing his gently at first before weaving his fingers into those dark, gorgeous locks of hair. He gave a light tug as he noticed the detective returning his advances, pressing back against him. They didn't pull apart until the need to breathe interrupted, then met each other's eyes with a mutual sort of desire.
Off they went, walking through the grass and the market to get back to the Wall where John had left so long before. But as they grew closer he paused.
"Mary, you can stop that," John insisted. "Thanks for helping me out, but I can't do this anymore. It's hurting Sherlock too much and I have to stop for him and for us. I've got him here with me and I can't do this to him. So thanks again for helping me, but I'm coming out and I'm doing it with him."
"People talk. That's what they do, John. You know that," Sherlock replied casually when the topic was brought up in their flat. Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, fingers steepled under his chin as he stared at the ceiling. John, however, was pacing as he stared at the paper.
Sherlock gulped, eyes wide, then nodded. This was a huge step for him, but it had to happen eventually. Maybe John would see his naked body, realise he was right, and leave. That was the only option Sherlock could imagine. But boy was he wrong.
"I've just had a terrible thought occur to me," he admitted. "I was trying to think of the color of Mary's eyes and I couldn't."
The day he'd finally gotten up the courage to ask out Sherlock Holmes was the happiest day of John's life, so far at least. Sherlock had said yes and they'd ended up going on a date that night at Angelo's. Everything was going well for the first couple of weeks. But then there was a bump in the road.
John knew Sherlock was trying to scandalise him, and he obliged with his eyes going wide, trying to recall exactly when Sherlock had taken them off and what John had said in the heat of the moment when ‘Will’ had walked into his office and suggested they find somewhere more discrete to greet each other.
John feels a glow of satisfaction and the sweet sensation of having had his prediction proved right. Already Sherlock is finding his feet and making demands. Who knows how far his innate curiosity and his natural bossiness will take him, but John knows that he is a match for anything that Sherlock can bring.
When Sherlock came home from Serbia, he'd considered so many possible outcomes of their reconciliation that he'd already been looking far beyond, when he’d finally walked into the Landmark that night and noticed Mary. His and John’s relationship before he’d gone had been tumultuous, a mess of emotion and repression and mixed-up thinking, but in that whole time, Sherlock had known that he could trust John to do the right thing when it had come down to the wire. When it had counted. But he had underestimated John’s grief. Could he say the same thing now? Could he trust John again?
John had spent months being single before getting together with Sherlock, intermittent dates aside, but since they had, he had become used to having someone around, and to a regular, healthy sex life. Three weeks didn’t sound like a long time, but John’s libido begged to differ. His left hand, once his most constant and faithful sexual partner, held little appeal since he’d discovered how much more satisfying Sherlock’s hands were, to say nothing of the rest of him.
