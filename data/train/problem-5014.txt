“I’m already longing for when we can bid our guests goodnight and retreat to our bedroom.” The low timbre and the underlying heat in Steve’s voice has Tony’s dick twitching underneath his clothes. Charmed and more than a little aroused, Tony winds his arms around Steve’s strong shoulders and squeezes him tightly.
“What the fuck?” Steve breathed, furiously blinking his eyes to get a better look at what appeared to be a… man made of metal? It was most likely armor, but it was no armor Steve had ever seen before.
Steve cut him off before he can talk. “I couldn’t help but think of when we first met, when I saw you there on the market square, standing toe to toe with an alpha twice your size and not cowering before his feet, protecting that asshole’s omega behind you.”
He’d laughed through the dizziness brought on by the anesthesia and then started to cry while cradling the twins against his chest. Steve should’ve been there; he should’ve been the first one to hold their twins and turn his baffled face on Tony, hopefully with a beaming smile of wonder and pride.
“Then why did you fucking leave me in the first place, if you’re so afraid I’ll jump down the first, available alpha’s pants huh? Your place is by my fucking side but you chose to go around the dancefloor with that little-“
Tony knew he had no business blushing, but the heat in his cheeks said otherwise. How was it that Steve seemed to see the deepest, darkest corners of his soul, to understand his innermost workings, and still love him? Tony didn’t realise that he could fall any further for this amazing man, but here he was, hurtling deeper down the deep crevasse known as love. He had no idea if he’d ever hit bottom.
“We can be friends,” he managed to get out, around the big lump suddenly lodged in his throat. It was better this way. Steve was not for someone like Tony; someone tainted, poor and of low standing. Steve needed an exceptional omega of a royal line who could be there for him in ways Tony knew he never could be. Steve was amazing and he would make an equally amazing omega happy.
“We’ll have to see, I suppose. Right now, I’m more concerned with getting through this night without any kind of bloodshed. You finished?” Steve looks at him distractedly, then does a double take and his eyes slowly peruse up and down Tony’s body. A lazy, hungry grin stretches Steve’s lips as he greedily drinks in the sight of him. “I’d say you are, just look at you. Red and gold really are your colors; it looks like you’re glowing.” Steve sounds a little dazed.
He was observant. When Tony had briefly mentioned getting tired of sparks burning the top of his feet when he worked in the forge, Steve had sent a disgruntled Bucky with a pair or new working boots – made from the finest leather and proofed to withstand the heat from the forge.
Despite Tony’s initial reservations, Hani had requested to remain at the court after Steve all but threw his alpha out of the country, leaving Hani behind to fend for himself. He’d wanted to try and make a life for himself in Manhattan and Steve, the biggest softy in all of creation according to Tony, hadn’t had the heart to deny him the request. Thankfully, it turned out Hani had actually shown himself to be a rather adept teacher, to their great relief.
“There,” Steve said when he was done. “Let me see.” His eyes darkened as Tony raised his head, the chains resting comfortable around his neck without restricting his breathing. “Look at you,” Steve breathed, awed. “Seeing it on you is better than I imagined; it makes you look even more gorgeous than I thought possible.”
Bucky snorted and grunted when he tried to get comfortable on the thin, lumpy excuse for a mattress. “Something about inducing Heats in omegas and sticking desperate alphas on them after a few hours on opposite walls. Apparently, they’re trying to breed some kind of super-babies. Zola, he… likes to talk while working.”
“To my great disappointment,” Thor nodded. “He is a hostage of Asgard, I am afraid, and he hates us all because of that.”
“Looking forward to it. Go.” Releasing Tony was one of the hardest things Steve had ever had to do, his arms ached to have him in them as soon as he stepped away. Tony looked at him for a long moment before giving a short nod.
“Then don’t,” Tony whispered back around a sob. “Stay, stay here with me.” He’d never felt this exposed, heart bared for Steve with all of his fear and longing spilling out like an open, bleeding wound.
- made his insides squirm in delighted happiness. “It’s ridiculous, but I’m a little anxious,” he confessed.
Bucky fell asleep after that, exhausted and in so much pain it was easier to drift into fitful sleep than stay awake and deal with it. Steve didn’t blame him. He would’ve taken all of Bucky’s pain if he’d been able to.
“Unfortunately, not what you’re thinking of,” Steve said with an apologetic pout. “We need to have a talk with the kids, Patrick especially.”
“So… is that bad?” Steve sounded unsure. Tony had no problem ridding him of that ridiculous notion. He never wanted Steve doubting the depth of Tony’s feelings for him.
“I know,” Steve agreed. “But we decided that he’s got to make his own choices and mistakes. He’s got to learn these things for himself but- “
Tony was blushing furiously. With heating cheeks his eyes darted around the packed room, his gaze roved over couples dancing, groups standing in small clusters laughing and talking, people drinking and having a really good time. And there, at the edge of the hall on the other side from where he and Thor were dancing, was Steve.
“Oh.” The emotions crowding in his chest smothered any other words he could’ve said, there were too many to get them all out in any semblance of coherence.
At that, she throws the sheets on top of Tony’s face as he lay on the ground and exits the bedroom. With yet another groan, Tony manages to drag himself to his feet and he trudges into the bathroom to relieve himself and brush his teeth. He doesn’t bother gelling up his hair and decides to leave it lying flat and fluffy on his forehead. Feeling more awake, he then leaves the bathroom and enters his extremely large walk-in closet to throw on the first items of clothing he sees. He emerges from his bedroom after exactly ten minutes, wearing a grey pull-over hoodie on top of his black tank top and black sweatpants. Natasha looks him over and nods approvingly
Tony brushes past everyone and walks into the kitchen. He heads straight for the cupboard which contains his alcohol and grabs the first bottle he sees, which happens to be a bottle of rather expensive brandy. He doesn’t bother to grab a glass and instead uncorks the bottle and takes a long gulp from it, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand once he’s done. The amber liquid manages to dull some of the aches and pains he feels, courtesy of Bucky Barnes, and he sighs with relief.
Tony’s reponse comes faster than anyone expects and it leaves them all a little shocked. “I’m going to kill him.”
“Don’t you dare even think about blaming yourself, Tony,” she says. She glares at him pointedly for another moment until she returns to gazing at Happy, murmuring softly, “Happy wouldn’t like it, and neither do I.”
Thankfully, she doesn’t ask what he’s thanking her for. Natasha seems to know, just like she always does. “Anytime, Tony. You know that.”
“Y’think?” Barnes growls, eyes screwed shut. Tony ignores him and continues to direct Bruce and Natasha through the mess of jumbled wires, untangling them on the way, and instructs them on how exactly to remove the gear without causing Barnes any further pain. Tony holds his breath for the minutes it takes to remove the gear, but once Bruce removes it with a triumphant noise Tony breathes a heavy sigh of relief and slumps back against the sofa.
“Remind me again why two of my closest friends are lunatic scientists?” she asks Tony, who laughs loudly. Bruce can be heard muttering under his breath from somewhere off-camera, and then there’s the sound of test tubes clinking together and more beeping. Tony and Natasha share a look of bewilderment before deciding that they’re better off not knowing.
“No offence, Sam, but I would rather be anywhere other than here right now,” grunts Tony, scrubbing a calloused hand over his face and rubbing at his temples for a moment in a vain attempt to rid himself of this God-awful headache. “Happy and Pepper were attacked last night. Big explosion in
Tony reaches the car park and unlocks his vehicle as soon as the elevator opens. He hops into his silver Audi and tosses the duffel bag onto the passenger seat, and twists the keys in the ignition. The car rumbles to a start and Tony buckles up quickly. As he is peeling out of the car park, rubber tires screeching on the ground, FRIDAY speaks up.
“Hello, boss,” she says. “The battery of your mobile phone died late yesterday evening while you slept. You have three missed calls from Agent Barton, one from Mr. Wilson, and seventeen from Captain Rogers. You also have two text messages from Agent Romanoff, one from Dr. Banner, and ten from Captain Rogers. Miss Potts has informed Colonel Rhodes of your whereabouts and he has requested that you call him whenever you have a moment. The Scarlet Witch has also requested that I tell you to find peace during your time away and to keep well.”
Tony looks up just in time to see Steve whack Bucky on the arm with a glare. A small smirk appears on his lips and when Steve sees this he sighs gently and runs a hand over his face.
. I couldn’t shake this feeling that maybe he was right. And then I thought: what if he is and I didn’t believe him? I trusted Tony’s judgement before, and I don’t see why I shouldn’t trust it now.”
It gets kind of blue for a teeny bit and touches on my mental health, so if this is something that could cause you any unease please be aware of that.
“You’re a doctor, ain’t ya?” snarls Barnes. He barrels on without waiting for a response. “So, fix it. That’s what doctors do.”
“I’m afraid not, sir, but the local law enforcement has released a statement to the press informing them that the explosive was placed inside a briefcase.”
“Thank you,” Tony whispers. “It’s been tough, but I know now that you had no control. I’m sorry too, for what it’s worth.”
“Sir,” says FRIDAY, seeming urgent. “My access to your penthouse floor seems to have been revoked and the camera feeds have been disconnected. Shall I-”
The doctor seems to think something over in his mind before he nods his head slowly. He eyes Pepper and Tony’s interlocked fingers before he motions for them both to follow him. He leads them down various corridors and up a set of stairs until they stop outside hospital room number 182. The doctor opens the door and steps aside to allow Tony and Pepper to enter the room first. The blinds are drawn on the door and windows so that people on the outside are unable to look in, and the bedside lamp is the only source of light in the room. Tony hears Pepper gasp faintly as the doctor shuts the door to give them privacy, and she sits in the chair at Happy’s bedside to grab his hand and brush her lips across his knuckles.
Pepper, bless her soul, appears at the end of the hallway and raises her eyebrows. “You boys okay back there?” she asks.
“I’m not here to kill ya, Stark,” says a rough Brooklyn accent. James Buchanan Barnes materialises from the shadows with a half smirk. Tony slumps back down onto the couch, mindless of the bottles’ amber liquid sloshing onto the expensive white material.
Rhodey scoffs as he wheels himself into the living room and comes to a stop beside one of the large couches, watching as Tony paces back and forth anxiously. “We came back here so you could clean yourself up and get something to eat, not so you could work yourself to death.”
FRIDAY sounds extremely displeased, not that Tony can blame her. Tony ignores the dotted trail of crimson blood that marks his path out of the gym, into the elevator, and onto the common floor and he focuses on trying to patch himself up. Tony hadn’t spared any thought towards how exactly he was to reach the cupboard above the fridge and grab the first aid kit when 1) he’s too small to reach the cupboard in the first place and 2) he’s unable to grab things because every movement of his fingers causes him to yelp in pain. He decides to give it a shot anyway and attempts to climb on top of the counter without the use of his hands, which proves quite difficult and causes Tony’s head to smack off of some surface or another more than once. Eventually, he just gives up and steals a bottle of pricey Russian vodka, presumably Natasha’s, from the counter with his elbow and then sits at the kitchen table to drink it. He manages to remove the bottle cap with his teeth and Tony spends the remainder of the morning attempting to drink from a bottle clutched between his chest and elbow.
“You used to be better than this,” she tuts, retreating a few steps to give Tony a moment. He shakes his head slightly to try and rid him of his blurry vision, but it doesn’t do much good. “There was a time where you could pose as a challenge, Tony.”
“You should get back to Happy. I think Downton’s on soon, and you of all people know how he loves to have company while he watches it. I have work to do anyway,” says Tony quietly.
They continue to stare at Tony, unmoving, until he pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs loudly. “
Sam waves at Tony from the living room and then raises his eyebrows in surprise once he catches sight of a fuming Pepper Potts. Tony shrugs his shoulders minutely, as if to say
“If you didn’t like it, I won’t be offended,” says Steve with a frown. “I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to buy your forgiveness with gifts. I just thought you’d like it, is all.”
Once an old episode of The Simpson is selected, Tony says, “I’m probably going to crash on your couch, if that’s okay.”
Bucky looks at them all in disbelief. Steve has wrung his hands together and is looking down at the floor, seemingly entranced by the dirt on his trainers. Even Wanda, who isn’t overly fond of Tony, nods in agreement with the others. Bucky huffs and crosses his large arms over his chest, shaking his head and causing strands of dark hair to fall from the loose bun tied at the nape of his neck.
“It’s somethin’ to me,” argues Barnes, glaring at the camera. “So shut up and accept the compliment.”
“Nothin’s up,” mumbles Tony, head lolling to one side to avoid looking at the man in his living room. Unfortunately, this means looking at the various photos of his parents strewn messily across the coffee table instead. “’m fine. Drop the concerned act and leave.”
“I’ll be waking you up bright and early, Stark. We’ll be able to continue training now that your hands are fixed.”
“Great. Just tell them that I’ve gone someplace safe for a while to work in peace, and that they can leave all messages with you because I won’t be answering my phone. On second thought, maybe I should leave a different one for Nat and Bruce... Yeah, I’ll do that. Tell Natasha and Bruce that I’m going to Malibu and that they can expect a video call from me whenever I land.”
“Don’t bullshit me, Rogers,” he threatens. “You knew, didn’t you? You knew the whole fucking time and never told me. You let me believe that everything was
Tony takes another long gulp from the bottle before he slides his eyes shut, grumbling unintelligibly under his breath until his grip around the neck of the bottle goes limp and his breathing evens out. Bucky watches him sleep for a moment, noting how much younger Tony looks in his sleep now that his wrinkles have smoothed out. Bucky grabs a soft and thick red blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it over Tony. He glances at the pictures on the table only once as he makes his exit.
Bucky pauses long enough for Tony to grow fidgety. He hates Barnes’ presence on his floor, in his home, and he wants to burn the area of the couch that he’s sitting in just so that everything in his penthouse remains untouched by the man who murdered his parents, his
Oh, and I have yet another angsty song recommendation: Comatose by Mikky Ekko. That song paired with this fic? Ouch.
“Don’t act like I’m not agreeing with you, Tones, but we don’t know anything for sure. Like it or not, all we’ve got to go on is a theory.”
Steve places his hands atop Tony’s and links their fingers together. “I have a meeting with Miss Hill, remember?”
“Not to be rude, but how are we meant to help if he’s practically allergic to talking about his emotions? Oh, and not to mention the fact that he cannot stay in the same room as two of the people here without freaking out. How could we even start to help him?” says Clint with his eyebrows furrowed together and arms crossed over his chest loosely.
“Ms. Potts is trying to reach you but is unable to as your mobile phone is currently inactive. Shall I-”
Rhodey honks the car horn and glares at Steve through the window. Natasha looks over her shoulder, holds up a finger to signal one second, and then turns back to Steve with an unreadable expression on her face. “Tony won’t like the idea of you helping him.”
“Don’t worry, buddy, I’ll be fine. I need your help with this next part, though, okay? Can you grab that test tube for me, please?” Dum-E reaches up and gently grabs the test tube with its claw, careful not to spill any of its content. Tony keeps a firm grip on the syringe as he lowers himself to the ground, resting his back against the wall with a grunt. “Thanks. Now, this next part might look scary, but don’t be afraid, okay?” Dum-E beeps again and rolls forward to bump into Tony’s foot. “C’mon, Dum-E, don’t be like that. You’re the only one I trust enough to do this. Just don’t tell that to U.”
Bucky snorts and rolls his eyes. “And what’s that? Drink?” he says with a sneer. Steve’s eyes widen and he thumps his companion on the arm rather hard, if Barnes’ flinch is anything to go by, but Tony doesn’t rise to the bait. Instead, he flips the former assassin the bird and turns swiftly on his heel to exit the kitchen, blanket billowing behind him like a cape.
Arriving at his new-and-improved Malibu house is an unusual experience. It is familiar enough that it still resembles the way it used to look before being blown up but different enough that it still feels like a new home, full of possibilities and potential. Tony is glad of the small changes because nothing reminds him too strongly of the past. It’s refreshing.
An awkward silence falls over them. Pepper, despite looking frighteningly powerful at all times, seems unsure of herself and her actions as she hovers by the door. Tony worries his bottom lip between his teeth and scratches at the old and faded scars on his arms.
“Good. Now I know that it represents who I am,” Tony snarks. He means for it to come out as a joke, but Pepper’s smile loses its amusement and she looks at him sympathetically.
“Leave them out of this, Tony,” growls Steve, eyes narrowing slightly. “What does that have to do with any of this?”
“Nope,” answers Tony, smiling to himself. He feels more and more relaxed the further he gets from the Tower. “But it’s why you love me.”
that you ‘will never go into business with someone that looks like Donatello from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’! Do you want this company to fail?!”
“And you, James. Tony let you stay here, in his home, despite being sent into a fit of anxiety every time he sees you. He allows you to stay here because he knows that you deserve peace, and he knows how much you mean to Steve, and he knows that you have suffered much more than anyone should. Tony even talked us through how to fix your arm despite him being away.”
Tony returns to the Tower hours later with a killer hangover, bandages and the like covering both of his hands and down along his forearm. The doctor specifically told Natasha and Rhodey, who were both hovering like mother hens the entire time, that Tony is not allowed to do any strenuous activity of any kind for at least a month and a half. Who knew inventing was classified as a strenuous activity? Ignoring his killer migraine, Tony bitches about it the entire way back until Rhodey turns around and glares at him.
Tony chuckles slightly and leans against the elevator wall, watching as it descends level after level until it reaches the ground floor and the doors open again. Rhodey goes ahead of him, wheeling past people and leaving a path for Tony to follow, which he does right up until they reach the front doors to the hospital and they both curse.
“Because I’ve been there.” I don’t know why I said it. I hadn’t meant to. “I’ve been in the dark so deep I thought my only option was dying.”
Peter tried not to overreact anymore. But, sometimes that proved harder than it would seem. Peter would be perfectly fine one minute and then he’d be panicking about something that happened two days ago the next.
Tony’s eyes were filled with major concern. “Don’t be sorry. Please...don’t be sorry. It’s okay,” Tony said. Clint came bounding in followed by a much calmer Natasha. Tony had to admit, at first, he really was hesitant about taking Peter in, because he knew he wasn’t ready for all that responsibility. But now, if something happened and Tony was sent to the past, he would still make the decision to take Peter in. Peter had grown on the team. Peter was looking down at the mug in his hands. The teen had dark circles under his eyes. Sam and Rhodey walked in. Peter felt as if he could burst into tears. ‘They all know’. He thought.
“Okay bud,” Tony said looking up to meet Peter’s gaze. Peter was the first to break the eye contact. The teen headed to his room, collapsing on his bed with a sigh. It really had been a long day. Too long for Peter. He was not okay with how much school he was missing, but he also couldn’t be having a panic attack every day. Peter stared up at the ceiling, waiting for sleep to overcome him.
“Better than I thought it would...she really seems to want me to go back…,” I said. I guess I was just that bad off. “What’d she say about me?” I asked. There was so much going on, that even if I had wanted to eavesdrop I wouldn’t have been able to.
“I love you guys too,” The teen said through cries. That made them happier than he could even imagine. But, that still wasn’t the end of the teen’s mental pain. He worked with Sam, talking things out a lot over the next few days. When he finally returned to school, he heard that Flash had been suspended for almost two weeks. Peter was glad he wouldn’t have Flash breathing down his neck and being a jerk.
“I’m sorry…” I whispered again. I just didn’t know what else to say. I felt hot tears sliding down my cheeks.
She sniffed, but other than that, she was quiet. “No matter what you might think right now, there is someone who loves you. Who cares for you.”
Aunt May’s face morphed into Tony’s. “You’re not important. You’re nothing. You are a burden to all of us. I don’t even know why I took you in,” Tony snapped. Peter’s heart broke into a million pieces at that.
The next morning, Tony walked out of his lab and found Steve. The blond was in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee. “Bad night?” Steve asked.
“Peter. You are a good kid. But this was the last straw. This is the seventh time in these past couple weeks that you’ve gotten in a fight with Eugene. I know you’ve been through a lot, but you cannot be going around starting fights.” Peter looked at him. Eyes wide and disbelieving.
“The only thing that matters is you’re alive,” Tony said. I was about to say something else, but I closed my mouth. Tony pulled me into a hug. I was hesitant but slowly wrapped my arms around Tony.
“I guess it comes with the job…” Peter said a little bit of life was back in his voice. Peter took a sip of his hot chocolate and looked at the ceiling. The memories of the nightmare were still in the front of his mind. Peter closed his eyes, feeling the threat of tears.
He watched in agonizing horror as the man pulled out of the woman and turn around to face him. The man scrambled to pull his jeans up. Then he dug in his coat pocket and pulled out a gun. Peter froze as he pointed it at the girl. “No! wait!” He yelled but it was too late. The shot rang out and the girl fell limp. Blood starting to form in a pool under her. While Peter’s eyes were focused on the dead girl, the man got away, disappearing into the shadows.
Peter’s awareness came back to him in an instant. “You with us?” Peter looked up to find an exhausted-looking Tony.
“Yeah,” I said while nodding. “I’ll be there in a sec.” She nodded, though an uncertain look dawned her face.
“Peter time to wake up. You’ve got school today,” Tony’s loud voice rang through my mind like a lawn-mower. I let loose a groan.
“Don’t apologize bud. You have nothing to apologize for,” Clint said. They continued eating without talking. There wasn’t much else to say, and no one said anything against it because it was a welcome, comfortable silence.
“Peter. I know...I know I’ve been awful to you in the past. I know you won’t forgive me...but please hear me out.”
“You are not messed up. You’ve been through some things that most people don’t go through. You carry the weight of everything on your shoulders. It’s not a matter that you’re messed up because you aren’t. You have a reason to be sad. You have a reason to be upset. But Peter, sometimes...sometimes you just have to let others bare some of that weight.”
Pepper glares at her partner but remains silent. Steve takes that as enough of an encouragement to go on.
Sorry if you were expecting an update but I felt shitty for not leaving an explanation as to why it's taking me so long to write more for this fic.
Bruce sighs loud enough to gather the attention of the others, including Steve, who has been pacing back and forth with a frown on his face since they reached the floor. Natasha places a comforting hand on Bruce’s shoulder and looks into his eyes with genuine concern shining in her own.
“Tony? What are you talking about? Has something happened?” asks the doctor. He takes a step forward, concerned for his friend, and Tony continues to stare at him in disbelief.
“Are you okay, Tony?” calls Natasha from the centre of the floor. He looks up just in time to see Steve look at her in surprise.
I don’t know why I always feel the need to apologize. I know that my mental health is affecting everyone else. I can see it in their eyes. Every time I have a breakdown, I can see that it upsets them. I hate that feeling that I’m burdening them. It was really bad when they had to go on that mission. I saw the major confusion that was written on Tony’s face when they got home and I was freaking out and crying up a storm.
“No...I’d rather not…” Peter said shivering slightly as the memories came back to him. The two fell into a comfortable silence. Peter finished his glass of water and moved to put it in the sink. “I..think I’m gonna try to go back to bed,” Peter said. His eyes half-lidded due to his extreme exhaustion.
“I know it sounds crazy right now, and I know it’s not what you want, but Peter it’s what you need. You need more help than we can give you here. You’re shutting us out Peter, there’s not much of a choice here,” Tony said trying to keep his voice calm.
Finally, the last chapter. I know it's isn't very long, but I struggled with this chapter. I don't have anymore ideas, so this is it.
“Peter. Don’t do that to yourself,” Bruce said softly. I looked at Bruce. The emotions I felt were overwhelming. I knew I’d gone back on my word. Why was he so calm about this? How could he be so calm about this?
Once they finally got back to the compound, Peter disappeared into his room. He was angry at Flash for being a jerk, but most of all he was angry at himself for not being strong enough. Ned continued to bring by his homework that he missed, but Peter didn’t feel like doing anything but lay on his bed and stare off into space.
“I was trying to help someone from making the same damn mistake I did,” I snapped. Tony looked minorly surprised. “Sorry if that was inconvenient for you.”
And that seemed to be the new topic at dinner. Peter had told Clint, who told Natasha. There was no denying it anymore. Natasha could see through even the best of lies. Peter smiled a lot more. But no one knew the emotional turmoil he was going through. His thoughts were constantly on Maddison Lyons, the girl he failed to save. He was constantly thinking about what Flash said. His thoughts were overwhelming, but he still tried to keep up his happy state. Peter saw the looks he was getting from Nat every now and then. He knew she could see right through him. But...in truth, he didn’t really care. He thought, ‘at this point...I might as well not hide it. But look at them, they are all so happy...and I don’t want to ruin that’.
“Whatever you say.” Tony’s tone was light. I let my eyes look over the room. It was a calm and peaceful Friday night. Tasha and Clint were sitting on the love seat. Tony and Steve were sitting side by side on the other couch. Bruce was at the end of the couch Tony was sitting on, he had his laptop out and was typing away. I was sitting on the floor by the table, homework papers scattered all over the table. Sam was visiting his mom and Rhodey was...well...somewhere. I set my notebook down, re-organized my papers, put them in my bag, then I headed to my room. I stayed there for a bit. It’s not that I didn’t /want/ to watch another cheesy romance movie that Clint picked out. It’s that I really didn’t feel like watching one.
“It’s fine...I just wish you would have told me and I’m sorry I freaked out, but I didn’t know where you were or if you were coming back or-”
When Tony sat down to talk to Peter about going to a psychiatrist, he expected Peter to be upset. And upset the teen was.
“Peter is showing signs of heavy emotional distress. Mr. Stark will be notified in ten seconds.” Friday’s cool voice rang out.
“Don’t be. It’s perfectly okay for you to yell. You can pour your heart out, you can yell, you can scream, you can cry, I don’t really care how, but you can’t keep bottling things up like you do. Because instead of helping, it’s just going to make things worse.”
Bruce and Peter were very close. Along with Tony, they were the science trio. The three of them practically lived for science. Bruce liked it that Peter felt safe enough to talk to him about his problems. Bruce never thought that Peter would be so close. He honestly thought Peter might have been a little frightened because Bruce turns into a big, green monster when rageful. But, Peter was never frightened.
“Be open and honest,” Tony finished. Peter looked at the two of them, confusion written in his eyes.
Peter woke up at around 11:30. His neck and back hurt from sleeping over his desk. Peter stretched and went to take a shower. The hot water felt good as it rushed over his aching muscles. Peter put a little bit of soap on his hands and massaged his head as he washed his hair. Peter tried his hardest to stay away from the razor on the wall in the shower. He pushed through the urge, turned the water off once he finished rinsing off, and stepped out of the shower. He dried himself off and got dressed in a clean pair of hello kitty pajama bottoms-the ones that Tony gave him- and a T-Shirt. He then sauntered out of the room. No one was in the living room or the kitchen.
“How fucking dare you leave without telling me? Something could have happened to you? Then where would we be? You fucking ungrateful child! I do so much for you and you just throw it all away! I work to get money to pay for your damn school and food! Do you know how much you cost PETER!? DO YOU?!” May said progressively getting angrier and louder.
“Propranolol. It’s a beta-blocker, it’s something used to help with anxiety. It lowers heart rate and blood pressure. It’s one-hundred percent safe,” Bruce explained, hearing the note of concern in Tony’s voice. Tony slid one arm under Peter’s neck and the other under his knees.
“Boss has instructed me to tell you Peter is asleep and to be quiet,” Friday said. Even her tone was hushed.
“Pete. It’s okay it was just a dream,” Tony said. He put his hand on Peter’s shoulder in a comforting gesture. Peter didn’t seem to hear him, and the teen only freaked out more.
Peter’s face lost all color. Instantly, the good aura in the room switched off like a light switch. Peter started shaking. He was taking forced deep breaths. “T-that’s f-fine,” Peter stuttered. He knew he was lying to himself. It wasn’t fine. It wasn’t okay. He didn’t want to go against his aunt. Despite what she did, he couldn’t bring himself to hate her. He was terrified to death of her, but he still loved her.
“The Avengers have been called on a mission, Mr. Stark has asked me to tell you they will be back in a few hours and not to worry,” the AI responded thoughtfully.
‘Collapsing into a bought of panic just because you think they left you. Constantly being thrown into panic attacks.’
My life was beginning to settle. I had Tony, Steve, Sam, Clint, Rhodey, Bruce, and Tasha with me. No matter how hard, how bad it got, they stayed by my side. May hasn’t tried to contact me. I was thankful, but a part of me still missed her. I know...it seems weird...crazy even, they I would miss the person who made my life so miserable. Flash and I made amends. We still weren’t the best of friends, but we were friends now. He said sorry, I found it in my heart to forgive him.
“Shh Tones. I know...I know.” Was all Steve could say. Bruce walked out of Peter’s room, looking heavily concerned.
Tony worriedly watched over Peter. It was around ten minutes after the teen blacked out due to a major sensory overload attack. Bruce had Peter taken to the medbay so they could better watch over him. Bruce took note of how low Peter’s blood sugar was. It wasn’t low enough to cause major problems, but it was low enough to strike minor concern within Bruce.
SO I WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS A SHORT SERIES, But then I changed my mind. I hope you all are enjoying it, because I enjoy writing it.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony’s voice was soft, forgiving. I didn’t deserve it. I didn’t deserve his kindness. I can’t believe they forgave me...I can’t...
“Fine. I guess it doesn’t matter anyway. Just...open the window,” Peter said after he got his suit on. It’d been a while since he’s been out on patrol. Peter swung from the window, soon he was in the air swinging around New York. He perched himself on top of a building. Silently listening for any signs of crime. It was silent at 3:30 am in New York, save for the sounds of traffic.
“You can’t possibly think I started it.” Peter’s voice was teary. Great...there goes another person he thought he could trust.
“May’s court date has been set.” Tony looked at Peter. “And...you’re going to have to testify Pete,” He finished.
Sam looked Peter in the eyes. He noted how the teen looked far older than he was, took on more responsibility than necessary. His brown eyes held a sadness that Sam couldn’t even begin to describe. “We’re here for you Peter. We want to help you. You just have to let us,” Sam said. Peter’s shoulders sagged as he let his wall shatter.
Peter woke up the next morning, dreading the entire day. The teen was slow about getting ready and going out the door. Before Peter entered the courthouse, he paused and took a deep breath. ‘I can do this.’ He thought to himself.
A day later and Bruce released Peter. Every bottle of pills of any kind, every sharp thing, razors, knives, were removed from the teen’s room. They wanted to be cautious.
Peter awoke to the sound of his alarm, signaling it was time to get up and ready for school. Peter groaned and got out of bed. He got took a shower, got dressed, and went to the kitchen. May was already up, she had made pancakes.
“Don’t finish that. There’s nothing wrong with you,” Tony said. Peter’s lip trembled as he fought against the response that popped up into his head. The teen tried to make himself look even smaller.
Peter let himself fall from the ceiling, landing on Steve’s back. Steve gave a soft ‘oof’. “Peter!” He yelled. There was no heat to his tone whatsoever. In fact, he had a big grin on his face. “Don’t scare me like that!”
I felt myself break then, completely in half. I felt someone grab my shoulders, hoist me up and guide me out of the room. It was quiet where we went, I could hear my own erratic, wheezy breaths, which frightened me.
I felt frustration rush through me for some reason. “You barely even know me! You don’t understand, no one understands. I don’t even understand!” I yelled. I stood up fast, storming out of the room. I heard her call after me, her voice majorly alarmed. Happy stood up looking heavily concerned. I ignored it all and stormed out. First, I started at a fast walk, but as tears began streaming down my face, I broke into a run. My chest was burning, my lungs screaming for air. My senses were dialed high due to the threat of the panic attack I could feel coming on. Despite it, I kept running as far as my legs would carry me. As far as my lungs would let me go.
“I-I’m sorry Aunt May,” Peter whispered hoarsely. She gave one last glare, grabbed a bottle off the counter, and disappeared into her room. Leaving Peter on the ground, wondering what he did wrong to deserve this punishment. That was the first time Peter was hit by Aunt May. She sobered up for a while after hearing what happened, promising that it wouldn’t happen again, begging Peter to stay.
“But there is…” He finally said. “There is something wrong. People don’t just try to kill themselves for no reason!” Peter was getting more and more worked up by the second.
Sam and Rhodey liked Peter. The two wanted to do all they could to help the teen. He was not in a good state of mind, and they all knew that.
“It’s white...with some...black and...red..” Peter was starting to get more confident in his answers.
“Can you tell me why you’re up there…?” I knew what it felt like. To want to die so bad. I saw her lip tremble. She shook her head. “I can help you.”
“If you EVER do that again…” She threatened. Peter took note, she didn’t smell like alcohol, she must be sober.
Tony had to admit, he cared for Peter a lot more than he initially thought he would. He also had to admit that the rest of the Avengers got along very well with Peter. They all loved him, cared for him. It was almost scary how Peter just wormed his way into their hearts so quickly. Peter was a precious child, all of them could agree. Now it was a matter of protecting that ever so precious child.
Peter walked in behind him looking smug, but angry at the same time. “That’s what you get,” he muttered under his breath. Peter sat at the table. “We having pancakes?” He asked.
OKAY, SO THERE IS MENTIONS OF RAPE IN THIS. IT ISN'T VERY DESCRIPTIVE BUT THERE IS A SCENE. Don't worry though...it isn't Peter. ALSO IF YOU ARE TRIGGERED BY ANYTHING IN THIS CHAPTER....PLEASE DON'T READ.
Today was not a good day. I woke up with an ear-splitting headache. When I opened my eyes I had to close them almost immediately. My head felt like it was going to explode. I didn’t dare move. I couldn’t. The pressure was too much. I heard myself groan in pain. I could hear cars from the street below the tower as if they were right by my ears. My heartbeat thrummed in my ears. The AC was rattling noisily. I felt nauseous. I groaned as I turned over onto my side, curling up into the fetal position, covering my face with my pillow. There was a knock on the door, that sounded louder than it actually was. I groaned ignoring it.
Tony helped Peter, who was still feeling kind of weak after his passing out, to the living room where everyone was sitting looking heavily worried. Peter’s jaw clenched. It’s not that he feared their reaction it’s that he feared their care. He hated that they cared for him so much. He didn’t deserve to be cared for. He deserved to die. He deserved to suffer for letting uncle Ben die, for letting that girl be killed because of his own stupid reckless-
It was as if Peter didn’t hear him. The teen was still begging for the voices to stop. Telling Tony he was sorry. Peter’s vision was beginning to black around the edges as he tried to get a good breath in. Then just like that, everything stopped. Peter, still crying softly, looked around the room. Tony was in front of him looking more concerned than ever. Bruce was beside him with a small syringe.
Flash Thompson knew he was being an ass. But now, he didn’t really care. He didn’t have a specific reason to hate Peter, he just did. Truth be told, the teen was jealous of Peter. The teen was always so bright, happy, bubbly, it just struck something within Flash. He hated Peter Parker. For what reason? Absolutely none. Flash heard about Peter trying to kill himself, in all honesty, the teen truly was guilty, but the anger he kept within him beat the guilt.
“As I assume, you already know what happened. Just keep taking those nice deep breaths,” Bruce said softly. Steve walked in with three mugs of hot chocolate. One was handed to Tony, one to Bruce, and finally one to Peter.
“Don’t.” Peter pulled away from the hug. “Don’t you dare try to say that I did what I could. Don’t lie. I could have done better. Someone is dead because I can’t get my thoughts in check. Someone is dead because of me!” Pete yelled. His emotions took a 180. He wasn’t sad or shocked anymore. He was angry with himself. “It’s my own stupid fault...and I’m done. I’m done with everything.” The teen walked away. “I’m done being spiderman.”
“-Now you better do something about it before I sue that damned school!” Tony yelled through the phone. He looked angry as he continued to argue with Peter’s principle.
“Just a kid at school. He…” Peter broke off. “He kept telling me that...that...no one…” Peter took a deep breath. He didn’t think it would be this hard, to tell the truth. “That no one really wants me around and stuff,” Peter finally admitted. Bruce frowned, looking a little green. Peter, not knowing any better, thought Bruce was mad at him. “I’m sorry…”
Peter sat in his room working on his homework. His Aunt May hadn’t attempted to contact him since that last time. Peter had changed his number.
Steve walked in a few minutes later. His eyes widened. Steve grabbed me from behind as Bruce came rushing in.
I slowly walked up. Took the oath to speak nothing but the truth and then took a seat while the lawyers asked me questions. I could barely answer them. My heart was beating furiously against my rib-cage as I told them what happened, how long it was going on. I could feel my hands start to shake. It was getting harder and harder to breathe, to speak. My words came out in rushed sentences. My thoughts were getting jumbled. ‘Was it getting hot in there? Or is it just me?’ I thought to myself. I could feel the beads of sweat trickle down my forehead. I didn’t know why I was panicking so much.
“I cannot, I am programmed to tell boss anytime you leave the building,” the AI said simply. Peter contemplated. He didn’t know what to do now.
“As for your panic attacks, just keep doing what you’re doing. It sounds like your folks have that under control,” she said. I nodded. We left her office, as promised, Tony was waiting, she wanted to talk to him. I was hesitant about waiting by myself, but I did anyway.
Peter swallowed hard, he wanted to say ‘I’m sorry I’m such a screw up. I’m sorry I’m such a burden. I’m sorry I’m stupid. I’m sorry I’m suicidal. I’m sorry I broke my promise. I’m sorry I ran. I’m sorry I had a panic attack. I’m sorry’, but before he could even think about saying it, Natasha beat him to speaking. “Peter, whatever you are thinking right now...stop. We aren’t mad. We aren’t upset.”
I took a deep breath, feeling the threat of tears for the third time that day. Dr. Hensen held an alarmed look in her eyes. I refused to speak.
Peter took a moment to look around the room. Sam sat in the open chair to Peter’s left. Rhodey stood beside Tony. Steve stood behind Tony, his hands on Tony’s shoulders. Clint was standing by Bruce against the wall. Bucky was standing by the door. The teen’s soft brown, doe eyes were red and puffy. Full of anguish.
“We are going to be there for him. Show him that we care. He has no one but us left, and he is never going back to her. Ever,” Tony said. They all looked to Peter’s sleeping form on the couch. It was final. They would protect Peter no matter the cost.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” The teen stated. “Flash hates me. And what’s worse, is I don’t even know why. He just hates me.” Peter said anger evident in his voice. There was silence. Neither said anything for a good three minutes. Sam waited for Peter in case he wanted to say anything else. “Sam…?” Peter said hesitantly.
It was quiet at first, but soon everyone was having a conversation with someone else. Bruce and I were talking about my science project for bio. I told him what Ned and I were doing. I was glad that everything was going back to normal.
And once in a while, there were the really really bad days. Peter was in a ‘I don’t want to talk, I don’t want to move, I don’t want to do anything,’ mood. On those days, Peter mainly stayed on his bed, in his room, in the dark. The only time Peter would leave, is if Tony forced him to eat a meal or a small snack. Peter usually had some panic attacks strung about, and it lasted over the span of two days, sometimes it was longer, sometimes it was shorter.
My vision started going black. I still couldn’t breathe. I felt light-headed. I curled up in a fetal position just before blackness overcame me.
Peter’s stomach growled as he made his way to the kitchen. Peter grabbed his cereal, looking at the clock, it was only about 9 o’clock. Peter took out his bowl from the cabinet and put some cereal in it. He grabbed the milk out of the fridge and poured a little in. The teen sat at the table and munched on his cereal. No one was in the living room.
Peter had a feeling that going to school was probably going to be a bad thing. He knew he was still emotionally unstable. “Just proves no one really loves you.” Flash let go of Peter. The teen’s knees buckled and he fell to the ground. “I hope you die, Parker.”
Peter was silent for a good while as he attempted to sip on the hot chocolate. “I’m sorry.” Peter couldn’t hold it in anymore. “I’m so sorry.”
“No. It really isn’t,” Peter said. “It’s not okay.” The teen was working himself up again. His breathing began to quicken again.
“Sorry...it’s just...It seems like the world is stacked against me.” Tony listened intently. The genius might not know what to say to make the teen feel better like Rhodey or Sam would, but he was a hell of a good listener.
This chapter was a pain in my butt to do...I ended up accidentally deleting the whole chapter, but I finally got it back. I hope it's worth it. I also stayed up late to write finish and update for you guys, despite having finals.
“You heard him. Get out,” Steve said. All the Avengers were glaring at him. Tears welled up in Peter’s eyes, his bottom lip trembled. “Before I throw you out.” Peter frowned, closed his mouth, and turned around. He walked out, crying as he reached the lobby. Peter exited the building, Pain evident in his eyes.*
“Hey, Peter. How are you feeling?” Somewhere in the time, I answered Tony and then got trapped in my own thoughts, Bruce had entered the room.
Rhodey and Sam talked to Peter. The teen agreed to talk to them if no one else. Peter was feeling slightly better now that he was talking about everything on his mind. A lot of stuff alarmed the adults because Peter was just a kid, who had the weight of the world on his shoulders.
As his thoughts were correct, everyone was walking on eggshells around him. He didn’t want that. He wanted everything to go back to normal.
“So you wanna go get some cheeseburgers?” Tony asked. I almost rolled my eyes. What was it with that man and cheeseburgers?
“Okay. now I know it’s you. So cut the shit.” My groggy mind still couldn’t place why this person sounded familiar.
Peter let his head rest against the cool porcelain. He shivered and slowly got to his feet, turned the water on, and grabbed a t-shirt and sweatpants. Peter took the suit off and stepped into the hot water, letting loose a sigh as the water helped soothe his aching muscles. He grabbed his razor blade. ‘It’s all your fault’ his mind yelled at him. ‘You let him get away!’
“Woah Pete, remember? Breathing is fun, breathing is important,” Tony said as he placed a plate in front of the teen, sitting down with the other one right in front of him. Peter took a breath.
“Peter let go of the damn bottle!” Tony yelled. He had Peter’s hands in his own. “Fuck it, Friday get Steve now!”
Trying to keep up with Peter's depression and making sure I include the characters and keeping up with Tony and Steve's relationship is slightly harder than I thought it would be. Buutttt I'm actually liking this one. I hope you all like reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.
“Peter.” She spoke softly, moving in front of the teen. “Peter, you need to breathe,” She said as she placed a hand on his shoulder. Peter took a forced, shaky breath. Sam kneeled down by Natasha, both of them keeping their distance from the teen.
“Woah, Woah. Take it easy kiddo,” Tony said as he gently pushed Peter back down. “Bruce said that you would probably be dizzy after you woke up.” The comment wasn’t necessary, but Tony said it anyway. “So...how are you feeling?”
Peter woke up. He was confused. He looked around. It all came rushing back to him. May kicking him out, throwing a bottle of wine at him, the yelling...the hitting...everything all at once. Peter felt himself panicking. A hand came down on his shoulder. Even though it was gentle, the teen flinched. Peter found himself back in the apartment.
“Who’s ready for dinner?” Clint asked rather loudly. There was a chorus of ‘me’. Peter was the last person to sit at the table. Peter pushed his food around his plate with his fork. The teen found himself not hungry. He often found himself in this position. Not feeling hungry, but knowing that he needs to eat, knowing that he’d only upset Tony more if he didn’t.
“What’s wrong? What happened? I’m on my way,” Happy said, a concerned tone taking his usual bored angry tone.
“I don’t really care who started it. You’re being suspended for ten days.” Peter was shocked. He’d never actually been suspended before. Peter ran out of the building. Ignoring every call that was aimed at him. He dug out his phone and slammed his fingers angrily on Tony’s contact.
“And we don’t blame you for panicking either. If I were in your shoes, I’d probably be worse off than you are,” Steve said.
Peter tried to ignore his thoughts as he forced himself to continue taking bites of the ever so yummy grilled cheese that Steve ever so kindly cooked up for him. When Peter finally finished the sandwich, he put his plate in the sink. He looked down at his shaking hands, blinking harshly as his eyes welled up with tears. The teen went up to his room, grabbed his notebook and a pen, and decided to do what Rhodey said would be good for him. Writing down his thoughts.
Steve. Steve loved Tony and Tony loved Peter. Peter was like the son Steve never had. Steve would give anything for Peter to be happy again. Because a Happy Peter makes a happy team. Peter lights up the room when he’s truly happy. No one had seen a true, real smile from him in the longest time. Not since Steve and Tony first told him that he was going to be adopted by them.
“Mm-hmm,” Steve hummed. Clint sat across from Peter at the table. Soon the others were up and sitting at the table, chattering lightly amongst themselves as they ate breakfast. Peter began telling Tony what happened this morning.
It seemed as though everyone was just afraid to talk to me because they might break me, acting like I’m a fragile piece of glass. To be honest, it kinda set me off. Made me a bit angry. I knew they were trying the best they could, but they don’t have to walk on eggshells.
Peter nodded as he was taken to Dr. Hensen’s office. Peter sat down on the couch. “How was your weekend?” She asked.
“May’s sick, Mr. Stark. She needs me,” Peter said getting up. He made a mad dash out before anyone could stop him. He ran all the way back to the apartment.
“Morning sunshine,” Clint said. The archer was sitting on the chair, well more like perching on it -because, heaven forbid Clint sit normally on a piece of furniture-. “Well...afternoon now,” Clint joked.
“Okay, so when you go home tonight. I want you to find a notebook, not one that you’re already using for school, and write every single negative emotion you feel. Whether that be anger, sadness, guilt, annoyance, fear, anxiety, all of it. Next time you see me, I hope you do, I want you to tell me about every word you write down.”
“You won’t tell anyone, will you? My sweet, sweet Petey?” I now knew who was calling me. “You made me very upset when you said those awful things…why wouldn’t you want to talk to your own aunt...the person who raised you?”
A thought crossed Tony’s mind as he looked down at the teen who fell asleep in his arms. Tony picked Peter up and laid the teen in his bed. Then, he went to his lab. Tony asked Friday to draw up some adoption papers. Tony thought of Peter as his son already, why not make it official. Of course, he’d have to ask Steve first, but...he didn’t see an issue. That’s what Tony spent the remainder of the night doing. Contacting his lawyer, Peter’s social worker, and getting the papers.
To say Tony was worried about how distant Peter was becoming was an understatement. When Peter got distant, it meant that it was really bad. The last time Peter was so distant, was right before the teen tried to kill himself. Tony didn’t want to go through that again. Peter was his son in all but blood. He knew everyone else was worried as well.
“Don’t worry about it Pete,” Tony said rubbing his now aching head. “That must have been one hell of a nightmare.”
I woke up, I couldn’t breathe as I shot up into a sitting position. I couldn’t remember what it was about, but I knew I had a nightmare. The only time I woke up like this was due to a nightmare. I put my shaking hands together, to try to calm myself. I tried to take normal breaths.
“He’s….sensory overload….probably….sedate…he...calm....” I was beginning to only get pieces of the conversation as I faded in and out of consciousness. Before everything faded into black, I felt someone pick me up.
“None of us saw it, love,” Steve said walking over to Tony and wrapping his arms around the smaller man. Tony buried his head in Steve’s chest. Tony gave a shaky breath, taking in the comforting smell of Steve’s cologne.
He was in there for a good hour before May came bustling in. “I want you out,” She said. “If you are going to try to take things and then lie about it, I don’t want you here.”
Peter put the cool metal to his wrist and dragged it across in one smooth motion. He did this until there were ten cuts that littered each arm. They were jagged and messy looking. His blood swirled with the water down the drain. Peter sank to the floor, the hot water now stinging him. He blatantly ignored the pain, because the pain in his heart was much bigger than any physical pain he felt.
I found a quiet spot on the side of the school and slid down to the ground. I put my head on my knees. I couldn’t breathe. I heard myself whimper as I held in my tears. I only freaked out more when I heard footsteps.
“Don’t be sorry Peter. It’s not your fault. Listen to me.” Bruce waited until Peter looked at him. Bruce looked very concerned and alarmed. “I want you to promise me, that you won’t listen to what this kid is telling you.” Bruce sounded serious.
“CLINT!!” the teen yelled loudly, getting up off the couch and running after Clint. Tony allowed himself to smile. Steve chuckled to himself and went back to flipping pancakes. Clint came back into the kitchen holding his cheek and soaked to the bone with water. He did not look happy.
Peter thought he didn’t want to outright tell her that he kinda wanted to disappear from the earth at times.
I dropped his phone. My chest was getting tight again. Breathing was getting hard. Everyone was asleep. No one was there to help me. No one-
I really hadn’t meant to let that slip. I didn’t want to tell her anything that I’d been feeling. I stopped running, gasping for breath as my lungs screamed in protest. Running while you’re having a panic attack really isn’t the best idea. My legs felt weak, like jelly, I fell to the ground. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t do anything. I don’t think...I’ve wanted to die so much in my life. I let it slip...she was going to tell Tony...he’s going to worry again...I’m just a burden to them. I wish I never called Happy...I wish none of this happened. I wish I could die. My heart was slamming against my ribcage, it hurt. Everything hurt. My hands were shaking so bad I couldn’t move.
I am not happy, nor sad. I guess you would call that neutral. But, I’m writing it down anyway because it’s what I feel.
I stopped writing. I closed my eyes. ‘There are those bad thoughts again’. I knew my door was going to open before it even did. I turned around and met the concerned eyes of Tasha.
Peter didn’t utter a single word after that. He could feel Happy’s worried glance on him every few minutes. Once they arrived, Peter got out of the car and went to his and May’s shared apartment. When he walked in, the silence was unnerving. Peter went to his room and threw his bag on his bed. He decided that it was probably best to leave his aunt alone. He sat down at his desk after grabbing his homework and begun working on it.
“She didn’t say much. Just that she’d really like it if you came back,” Tony said. I narrowed my eyes, looking at him.
Once they arrived at the office, Happy surprised Peter by actually going in with him, telling the teen “I’ll be out here when you’re done.”
“So I heard your aunt snapped. I heard she beat you. Well, you probably deserved it and if I was in charge of you. I’d probably do the same thing. I bet she would have rather died than have spent any more time with you.”
“I’m so stupid. So dumb. So weak,” Peter thought to himself. “Sometimes I wish I could just disappear from the world.” Peter let himself stop thinking about that as he turned the water off and stepped out of the shower. He bandaged his arm, albeit shakily, got dressed, threw his hoodie on, and went back to his desk.
“Peter. You’re working yourself up again. It really is okay. No one is upset. No one is mad,” Tony said. Peter closed his eyes, taking a calming breath. His head was still pounding painfully. The light was making him nauseous.
Natasha sat down in a chair after getting changed into more comfy clothes. She turned on a show, making sure to keep the volume down for Peter who was still sleeping on the couch. Clint went to train in the archery room Tony had designed him.
Steve walked in a few minutes later. His eyes widened at Peter who was growing more and more tired. Steve grabbed Peter from behind as Bruce came rushing in.
When Tony saw Peter in his panicked state, he panicked as well. It was like Peter was frozen on the spot. Then, Tony tried to guide him out...which resulted in the teen screaming bloody murder and swatting his hands away. The teen proceeded to fall to the floor. Screaming, breathing heavily, shaking worse than a leaf on a windy afternoon.
That’s why Peter found himself at the compound, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, Bruce cleaning his face where the glass had cut it, a mug of steaming hot chocolate in his hands, telling Tony what exactly happened.
Bruce told Tony that the main reason Peter wasn’t awake yet was that he was extremely sleep deprived. That his body was just catching up on sleep.
Anyway, I know it's pretty chaotic, but this is really just a vent fic soooooooooooooooooooo. I hope you enjoyed it!!!
Tony walked into the apartment. He let loose a gasp. There were pill bottles strung out in the living room, there were bottles on the cabinet. It looked like someone tried to clean it but it was a mess again. ‘Oh my god,’ the genius thought to himself. “Pete?” He called out softly as he reached the teen’s room. Peter, who was sitting helplessly on the ground, shoulders shaking with cries, flinched. Hard. Then he looked up and saw that it was just Tony.
Peter looked at Sam. The teen had tears streaming down his face. His bottom lip was trembling as he attempted his best at a smile. “But it’s not their weight to bare. It’s my own. My own mistakes, my own pain.”
Tony contacted the mental hospital/prison May was sent to. He made it clearer than crystal that she was not to have any contact with Peter.
“I’m just cleaning up..,” Peter said. “You kind of left a mess. I figured you’d want help…” Peter’s words faded off at the still angry look on his aunts face.
“Okay.” And with that, she left. I put my notebook up and went back to the living room. I took my place back on the floor in front of the couch.
Peter sighed. He got up and walked to the bathroom. The urge to cut had never been so strong. Peter grabbed his blade. Then, he remembered what he promised Bruce. Peter’s hands began to shake. Peter fell to his knees, then sat down on the bathroom floor. The blade was clenched in his fist.
Peter knew she was angry. She always blew up around the anniversary of his death. She blamed him, and if he was being honest….he too blamed himself. She was right. He was ungrateful. She punched, kicked, and slapped him. Yelling as she did so. Peter was terrified, but still, he refused to move. A few tears escaped his eyes. “I’m sorry!” He yelled in anguish. He begged for her to stop, yet, she didn’t. She never listened to him. He deserved it though. He didn’t deserve kindness in any shape or form.
“To warn you before I walk in.” Steve sat down. “How are you feeling?” Peter wanted to lie. He wanted to say he was fine. But...everyone knew he wasn’t. Everyone. So, he didn’t say anything. “We’re having a movie night...do you want to join us?” Steve asked.
Happy’s tone left no room for argument. Peter hung up the phone. He sat on the floor, cuts on his face bleeding, crying into his hands.
And that’s where I found myself Wednesday night after school. “Hello, Peter. I’m Lana Henson,” She said shaking my hand. We went to her office. Tony told me that he’d be out and back before the session was over. She was a short brunette. She had a kind look about her face. She said her voice was soft like a mother’s.
I forgive Aunt May too. What she did was terrible, but...why hold a grudge when I can just forgive and forget. It was hard for Tony when I told him that. He was upset at first, but his demeanor changed. He wasn’t upset like I thought he would be.
