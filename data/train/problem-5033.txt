Steve went willingly, the sharp tug on his scalp going straight to his cock as Tony thrust against his throat again and Steve held his tongue flat against Tony’s cock. Tony was moaning, moving constantly as he climbed higher into his orgasm, Steve’s strong arms encasing him on either side as he squeezed Tony’s ass and hummed against him every so often to add a new sensation to the mix. Tony loved it, cock jerking and legs squeezing around Steve’s head as he threatened to come.
He backed Bucky up against the side of the couch, hoping that keeping him upright would slow the blood flow and then Bruce was there. His mouth pressed into a firm line and his eyes set to the task at hand.
Steve stayed where he was, “I love you, Tony Stark.” He told him, blue eyes shining, “Impossibly. Recklessly. Foolishly. Blissfully. I love you.”
Tony wasn’t building Rumlow anything, he was creating a mini arc reactor that fit into the centre of his palm and would produce enough energy to disable the locking system on the door and let him walk out of there.
Steve’s eyes were on his, sinful and dark and Tony couldn’t look away. The air was thick around them and the silence was deafening. He could have heard a pin drop; it was that palpable between them. Neither one dared to move. Neither wanted to break whatever was holding them in place.
There was a stalemate between them, locked in this silent battle of wills as Bucky watched from the sidelines. A moment passed, and then another, and another. Tony was starting to wonder whether Howard had even heard him.
Steve slowed back to a walk but kept closing the distance between them, “This? This was your great big plan?” Fury asked with disbelief.
Tony startled; the light they had stopped for had changed back to green. He put the car into gear and headed off, “You didn’t have to come, you know?” He said softly to Bucky, keeping his eyes fixed on the road.
Steve had been right; they had been killed somewhere else and moved into a more public location to be found. This had been a set-up, “I read in the report of the first victim there was something under his nails, was it blood from the attacker?”
Sitwell visibility swallowed, his own guys flanking him with two men on either side. “We’re here to discuss business, aren’t we?”
T’challa huffed and Steve could imagine him scrubbing a hand over his face, “You’re not calling me to speak to an old friend, Captain.”
“How did you get these?” Steve asked, voice dropping lower than before, “I noticed them first time we slept together but I didn’t think it was the right time to ask. It was none of my business.”
“This one is all tissue, try not to scream.” He advised and then the shot echoed out through the room. The guy let out a grunt and something that might have been a shout in pain if he wasn’t biting his own tongue to try and not let Steve see his agony. It was a brave choice, Steve admired that.
The Hydra man spat blood as his face hit the floor and to Steve’s surprise he actually tried to sit up, using his good arm for leverage as he righted himself into a sitting position with his back against the side of one of the vintage cars in Steve’s collection. Steve almost wanted to like the guy. Almost.
“He’ll probably be waiting.” Natasha remarked, “He knows you’ll want him to answer for what he did.”
He pushed his finger down further, the sound of the shot ringing in his ears as it was pushed from the barrel into the man's chin and up. Steve could feel his blood splatter onto his face, covering his cheeks in a fine spray.
His whole body clenched around Steve’s hand, shaking with the effort of his orgasm raging through him. Steve kept his eyes on Tony’s, feeling the cum hit his own stomach from Tony’s cock as he came.
Was Steve really playing him this whole time? All those looks and kisses and sex that seemed to be breaking down both their walls and securing their intimacy. Was it all just nothing to Steve whilst it had meant everything to Tony? Steve had stood there and said the things he knew would hurt Tony, he’d thrown them at him with nothing more than a sorry and what was Tony meant to do with sorry now? Steve was standing there like the mob boss he was, the mob boss Tony had fallen for. Hadn’t he known what he was getting into?
“I told him I loved him today.” Tony let out a little laugh, “In the police station. Even after he broke up with me, even after he hurt me. He didn’t say it back and there wasn’t enough time to talk about it, but I meant it. I’m here because I choose to be here, because he is what I want. I don’t know what to do with that but I’m not about to bail on him now.”
“He didn’t even bat an eyelid when I told him the job was for The Captain. Just asked to see the bike like it was just another day at the office.” She mused.
“What’s happening?” Steve asked, feeling the metal give way, “I thought you were bringing Tony to me?”
“Maybe… yeah, I think so.” Tony replied and he could already see the hurt and disappointment on Rhodey’s face, “Hey, listen, I’m still me okay. I’m just trying to help here. This turf war, it’s going to get ugly fast and I need you to believe me when I say he’s the only one who can stop it now.”
Steve allowed himself a smile then, “It was the first thing I brought when I started making real money. An old ally, if you like. Got me out of a few tough scraps in the past.”
Steve stood as well, “Lead the way.” He said gently, walking in step with Tony as they made their way out of the bar and into the cold night air.
Once he walked the length of downtown Brooklyn in the same frantic need to keep moving. It helped him think, the motion, the mindless act of putting one foot in front of the other. The direction didn’t matter, just as long as he was moving.
Fury nodded, “And I can see why. You have knowledge of guns, professional knowledge, not the type of shit you learn on the internet. You’re a strategist, a professional which led me to thinking you’re either ex-police or ex-army.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know where he is. Sometimes he’s at the base, sometimes he’s not. He’s all over, rallying support and putting plans into place.” The guy told him; eyes glued to the blood pooling from his leg.
Tony had walked into the shop many times to be greeted to the sight of Peter in various worrying situations. That one time the kid had got his hand stuck whilst trying to install a new engine into Mr Dawson’s car or the time he had spread himself out on the floor and was sorting out jelly beans into different bowls by colour because he hated the taste of the yellows even though Tony was sure they all tasted the same.
He opened the last button, pushing the shirt open as much as he could to reveal Steve’s chest to him, he couldn’t take it off properly while Steve was tied to the bed but for now this would do. Steve was a masterpiece, sculpted by gods and to be marvelled at by men. Tony couldn’t help the way his hands spanned over his skin, fingers mapping out the lines of his chest and circling over the scars the made him who he was. The graze by his ribs from the bullet on his left side that left a ragged line on his side that Tony simple had to taste with his tongue.
He threw the envelope down on the kitchen table, a dull thud echoing through the room. Bruce moved to reach for it as he was closest, tucked into a chair with a tired expression and a grim line set into his mouth. Clint was opposite him at the table, with Bucky seated in the middle. Bucky was cold and switched off, not that Steve could blame him. He only knew the half of it. He leaned back into his chair with his arms crossed, a silent display mocking Steve from where he stood at the head of the table. Natasha was perched on the counter, never one to use a chair when any other surface would do. Sam leaned up against the counter next to her, he was clearly confused but Steve saw past it to the worry in his eyes. Thor was leaning against the back door, an imposing figure of strength. He always seemed to gravitate towards the exit, like he needed to be the first to chase after whatever was coming to hurt this family.
“I know about the bombs. I know about Howard Stark. I’ll stop him before he gets the chance. Or maybe I’ll deliver him to the cops and see what they do to him.” Steve replied, crouched over Pierce in the snow.
What he wasn’t ready for was the sight of his best friend slumped against the doorstep, face and hand bloody. Bucky was barely conscious, sweat pouring down his face. Steve stared at him in shock. The place where his left arm had been was gone. There was nothing more than a crudely hacked stump from the end of his shoulder. Steve felt the bile rise in his throat and echoed Natasha’s shout in Russian behind him. Her voice sounded far away and tinny.
He looked up to the sky instead, the darkness bleeding into the night. He couldn’t even see the stars it was that cold.
She was pushing him towards Tony. Steve didn't even want to know how she figured him out or about the fact she was giving him her blessing to continue whatever they had going on. Her eyes were unmistakable though. She knew more than the rest of them.
Fury collected the photos back up, “Okay, how about you tell us why when we ran your prints, we didn’t get a hit.”
“Make love to me, Steve.” Tony said softly between them, the statement both arousing and vulnerable at the same time.
When Tony woke up it was to a dull thudding pain in his left temple and a harshly lit room. He was tied to a metal chair with his hands and his feet bound to it with heavy rope. The blood on the side of his face had dried and crusted against his cheek, making his skin feel tight and scratchy.
“Immunity. The whole family. A chance at being together. You said it yourself, give it a year or two in protective custody and we cut loose to find each other again. It could work. New start. New city.” Natasha mused, “Everything you said you wanted for us two nights ago.”
Suddenly, there was a loud bang from inside. The kind of sound a firework makes when it launches into the air. Steve hadn't heard something on that scale since Afghanistan and he found himself gripping his gun tighter. That feeling of anticipation pooled in his gut, the same feeling he always got before a heavy fight. The adrenaline would kick in next, the second he shot off his first bullet and then it'd be pure instinct.
Steve’s eyes watched him the whole time, giving him his privacy but scanning over him to check he was okay. Tony didn’t know why he found it nice rather than uncomfortable, he wasn’t used to someone paying such close attention to him. Thor zipped around another corner in fourth gear as he handed Steve back his phone.
“But you didn’t do this and as much as I don’t like you or your gang, I want to find the bastard that did this.” Fury replied, “For that I need your help.”
Steve had the weapon out of his hand and in his own palm before the kid could never register what was happening. With an arm braced across his chest and his own gun pressed against his neck, Steve could feel him shudder in fear. He was at least a head taller than him, lowering his face down so he could speak directly into his opponent’s ear, “You don’t take your eyes off your target until you’re sure he stops breathing.” Steve told him gently before pulling the trigger.
The sound of the door banging open was enough to have them both startling, Thor striding into the room with frantic steps and wild eyes.
Steve tugged at the ties again, slipping his finger into the knot and pulling. It loosened enough for him to slip a hand out and then he was free to grab for Tony, other hand still tied to the bed. He thread his fingers into Tony’s hair, making Tony look at him with wide surprised eyes.
“You could ask for anything you want right now, and you worry about other people?” Ross frowned, “That sounds a little naïve to me.”
“Ross doesn’t care.” Fury replied, “He’s out for blood. As far as he’s concerned you and Rumlow are the same now. The same kind of threat, he’s brutal. He’s already reassigned Rhodes to his unit.”
Tony was grateful to be out of the cold, moving past the older man and into the warmth of Steve’s house, “Sorry if I’m late, work at the shop has been crazy over the last couple of days.”
Tony scoffed, “You’re doing this for you.” He replied, “I know, okay? Thor and I worked out your little plan. You’re going to hand yourself over to Rumlow? To protect us? What a fucking hero, Steve. We didn’t ask for this. I didn’t ask for this. It’s not your job to protect me, okay.”
Tony was so hopeful and committed to making this plan work. To saving Steve. He really didn’t deserve him. This whirlwind of a man that had breezed into Steve’s life and somehow made himself at home there. Steve could feel the spike of guilt in his gut. This plan wouldn’t work, Ross would see through it in a second. The idea of proving Steve Rogers really did die in the desert and setting someone else up to be The Captain. Fury had worked it out, Ross would as well. It was only a matter of time and Steve couldn’t risk it. He had to protect Tony from him and this life before it came down around their heads.
Fury shuffled in his seat again and Steve could imagine him ordering his thoughts, “Ross failed. He’s corrupted and he’s Hydra which means the gang problem is still out there and it’s only going to grow. No offence but you folks spread like rot.”
“Then we’ll leave.” Steve promised, “Then I’m done. I’m out.” He vowed, giving Tony that same room in his heart that Tony had given to Steve.
Steve had met Howard a few times, at conventions and galas and he knew that Howard Stark built weapons. More importantly, to the right buyer he’d sell them to whoever had the most to offer. “A lonely life?”
Steve's smile grew. That mean Tony was still alive. That meant he was close, "Before we get started, does anyone want to leave?"
Steve pressed ahead, “Rumlow wanted Tony to create a bomb that would level most of Brooklyn if he chose to aim it on these streets. As of now, Tony’s family is under our protection. Thor, you set the detail up?”
Tony nodded, “I’ll take that. Please, help me. Two minutes with him, okay? Then I’m out of here and I promise I won’t come back. I just need to see him.”
He gave him some time to cool off, heard the shower start up and later heard his footsteps trudging back down the stairs making a beeline for the garage. Was this cold and aloft shell more of The Captain than Steve Rogers?
“I’m DI Fury,” Eye-Patch introduced himself before gesturing to his partner, “This is DI Rhodes.” The man gave him a small nod and went back to his file, “He’s nice. I’m not.”
Steve was a goner as soon as Tony opened his mouth, hips slamming back into his heat once more before Steve was falling over the edge.
“Normally yes, but right now with The Avengers having been pulled in off the streets? Everyone in a gang is scared and murder-happy tonight. Ross went to the docks, made threats Hydra didn’t like now Rumlow is gone about taking over, they killed him and left his body there.” Steve replied, “We’ll have an alibi as we’ve all been in police custody since Ross brought us in.”
Bruce had his fingers to Bucky’s wrist, checking his pulse, “Okay, we’ll call you with updates. Just be careful. Rumlow is clearly a madman.”
Tony looked cold, a red tint to his nose and cheeks as he shoved his hands in his pockets and jogged across the street to meet Steve. His whiskey brown eyes looked worried and it took everything Steve had not to instantly wrap Tony up in his arms. He couldn’t, it’d make this so much harder.
“What you’re willing to do to keep yourself alive, to keep your family together. What lines you’re willing to cross despite the fact that once you do cross them you can’t take them back.”
Fury nodded, “I am. Rhodes is off today. This is Dawkins from internal affairs. He just needs to get the facts so he can sign off the report and make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary about this one.”
Tony didn’t hit him. Tony was a better man than his father. He was a better man than Steve. He sniffed the air to collect himself and took a deep breath. Steve watched as the wind whipped at his dark hair and his brown eyes filled with tears he was refusing to shred in front of Steve. Strong, resilient Tony Stark. He was worth ten of Steve and now he had a chance to live.
“He was Hydra. He was a bad person. He was Hydra.” Tony told him, the sobs dying out, but he was still shaking.
Tony shook his head, “Don’t talk like that. This is just another thing we have to get through. Another day.”
Steve felt the weight of the saw in his hand, saw the shine of Bucky’s blood on the blade, “Ross didn’t cut off my best friend’s arm and kidnap my fella.”
Steve was sure even if the police or Hydra busted in now to get him, he’d make them wait until he’d finished leaving Tony completely spent and satisfied before they got down to business.
“Mistakes?” Tony questioned, “Mistakes are forgetting to come to a parents evening or forgetting to buy me a birthday present. Mistakes aren’t third degree burns or a black eye.” He sneered, heart beating wildly in his ribcage.
“How did they even manage to take him?” Tony asked, everything clicking into place, “He set himself up. For us.”
“Do you have a death wish?” Fury snapped as a greeting, “Ross is watching my every move. I can’t take your calls.”
“You don’t know him, he’s unhinged. He wants The Avengers gone. He wants Brooklyn. You won’t last the year, Captain.”
He sighed again, hands delving into Rhodes’ suit pockets, “I am sorry.” Steve muttered as his fingers pulled out a keyring of keys. Steve found the one he was looking for easily, it was the smallest of the bunch and managed to unlock his cuffs. His wrists were sore as he rubbed them, letting the keys and cuffs fall at Rhodes’ feet as Steve got back up again.
One thing Steve knew for sure as he shoved Tony’s card into his pocket, he’d definitely be seeing Tony again. Even if he had to break that damn bike himself to need a mechanic to fix it.
“The Captain. Steve Rogers.” Tony breathed out, “I know he’s been held here, and I need two minutes alone with him.”
Steve moved to unlock the cuffs from the radiator, allowing the man’s arm to slump down in his lap. His fingers twitched as he tried to regain feeling into them. Steve didn’t do it to be kind, he grabbed onto the guy’s good arm and dragged him away from the wall, all but throwing him into the direction of the cars that the garage housed.
That was why they called him The God of Thunder after all. Steve shivered at the sound of the hammer shattering bone; Thor always compared it to thunder striking the earth. The damage was on the same scale in Steve’s opinion.
Fury shook his head, grabbing Steve’s arm and drawing him over into a corner for privacy, “Ross is dead. Tony killed him.”
Tony nodded, “But you always make sure I cum first.” He rolled his hips against Steve’s for emphasis, “You always take care of me first. I want to do that for you.”
“Don’t give me that bullshit,” Steve argued, “If you were fine this wouldn’t have happened today. I didn’t give you the order to engage. I didn’t tell you to bring him in. I told you to follow him. If you two can’t sort your shit out, then I can’t have you in the field.”
When he was done, he moved back into the bedroom with as much silence as he could. The house below seemed eerily quiet from the landing, but Tony was sure someone at least was up. This wasn’t a house of late risers.
He approached cautiously, the condo was still dark so perhaps it was simply kids messing about or looking for cash. Tony was smart enough to know that making their way into an apartment building and heading straight to the top floor was a lot of effort for a couple of junkies looking to fund their next fix.
“And I think he’s coming to us.” Natasha replied, nodding her head towards the distance where the blue lights were flashing ever closer to them.
Tony nodded, “We’ve met before actually, he’s given my father a few research grants for the company in the past.”
Tony’s body shivered but still he slept on, Steve placed a kiss on his hipbone as he settled himself in the space between Tony’s thighs. He was already hard, the excitement and desire for Tony pooling in his gut the second he crawled onto the bed to join him. Tony was sporting morning wood, his cock half hard and curious to the attention.
Steve knew what he had to say now, he knew Tony well enough to know how to end this but the words died in his throat. Forgive me, he wanted to beg and throw himself down to his knees in the dirty, I never deserved you.
The cops came to a halt in their small clearing, piling out of cars and taking up aim at all four of them. Steve pushed himself in front of Tony slightly to block them from him. Ross came from the centre of the force, wearing a bulletproof vest and a victorious smile.
“You’re going to give me beard burn.” Tony panted into his ear as Steve moved his lips over the mark again.
The calm moment in the cold was disturbed by the sound of Steve’s phone. The muffled ringtone blaring in his pocket against the silence of the night. The sound bounced off the steel craters as he dug it out and frowned at the unknown number flashing on the screen.
It must have been around noon when Steve had finished combing through everything the report had to offer, even going so far as to print out the written report of the crime scene so he could circle the key bits that might point to someone else having staged this. There was a size ten boot print a few yards away from the body that didn’t match the person who found him that could point at someone dumping him there but there was no way to prove it wasn’t Steve or anyone on his team.
Tony nodded, “Copper wire, three inches thick. About a metre. A coffee, black, no sugar and some palladium. 8mg.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair, "Immunity is on the table for you. Not for me. I'm the mob boss, I don't get a pardon for my sins."
T’Challa was mingling but was easy to spot, he always did manage to command the room. He beamed when he saw Steve, his conversation coming to a stop. Steve smiled back, watching the shock of T’Challa’s guests as The Captain stepped into their inner circle.
Bucky sighed, turning in his seat slightly to get Tony’s attention, “You love him, right? Well, this is what you’re signing up for. He’s stubborn and overprotective and a pain in the ass but he’s also loyal and loving and supportive. He’ll go to war for you if you ask him.”
In truth, Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for this. To confront Howard and waltz into Stark Industries as his son returning home for the first time in years. He needed to do it though, Howard was working with Hydra and if they had any chance of stopping Hydra and Rumlow then they needed to get Howard on side. Once again, his father held all the cards.
“Lord, I fell in love with a dreamer.” Steve whispered gently as they pulled away, eyes twinkling and a large smile on his face.
Tony sucked hard against his nipple, feeling Steve buck up against him feebly trying to get some friction.
“You know when Steve found me, I was staring down four cops with guns. I was covered in blood, lost in rage and grief and willing to be shot down in the street to make them stop.” Thor replied, “Those were dark days. I didn’t know why Steve helped me; it was only later after he recruited me that I learnt he’d been following my movements for a while. He needed more muscle for his team, and I was ruthless. When I was about to give it all up, he came speeding into the street like a race car driver. Told me to get in if I wanted to live.”
Steve winced at the metal chaffing his wrists, “Thanks for the pick-up.” He replied softly as Fury helped him to his feet.
“I don’t know. Whatever he’s planning, it’s bigger than a few cop killings. This is a lot of effort to start a gang war.” Steve replied, “I had to protect you, Bucky. I had to try. Please understand that.”
He made his way up the stairs quickly, spotting a sign towards the locker room. He ducked in that door, peering around the corner to make sure it was empty. It was, much to Steve’s relief, and he slipped inside allowing himself a moment to breathe.
“Yes, Steve, you could have.” Bucky bit back, “You didn’t because you knew we’d help you. You knew we’d do anything for you, to protect this family.”
There was something about the way the sunrise hit Steve’s room, the soft glow from the windows that turned everything a magical shade of orange and seemed to make the room warmer despite the winter weather outside. Tony took a moment, eyes gazing out the window. In his head he wondered whether it was the mob boss in Steve or the artist in him that had chosen this room. The view was beautiful, the skyline of Brooklyn in full view and Tony could almost imagine him sketching it in the early hours of the morning when he couldn’t sleep and needed to keep his hands busy.
They split up as soon as they entered the compound, a maze of half constructed places and structural beams that made up Rumlow’s base at the shipment yard. In the war it might have been a hub of activity but it had been left to fall into disarray not soon after. Steve himself had never ventured down there; it was one of the few places he was warned not to go to as a child. The building was structurally unsafe, rot eroding most of the wooden beams that held the structure intact although it looked like Rumlow was planning to make it his permanent base because there had clearly been work to secure the building before he moved the bombs in. There were now metal pikes along the beams to reinforce the corridor walls and plastic sheeting up to block out the worst of the rot.
“Early run this morning?” Tony asked, hooking a leg over Steve’s hip like he needed to be as wrapped up in him as possible.
Then Steve was moving, being shoved in his own direction, towards a police van with bolts in the floor and twelve cops standing guard to accompany him to the station.
Tony wanted to run to him, but Natasha held him back. They walked together, making their footsteps slower and louder so Steve didn’t spook at their arrival. They had managed to disable the bombs easily. Natasha shot three Hydra members that came their way as Tony worked, cutting the various wires with a clinical detachment.
Thor took a sip before speaking, “I fear so. Whoever has taken over clearly want to send a message to you.”
Tony woke up with a dull ache and an empty bed, he tried not to be disappointed at the fact Steve hadn’t stayed. Why would he? Tony got the impression that he wasn’t the sort to do the whole breakfast in bed thing. He was a mob boss; Tony shouldn’t be anything other than relieved that he didn’t have to deal with his choices in the light of day.
When his eyes did focus up on the dab grey walls of his cell, he realised he wasn’t alone. Sitting in the corner by the heavy-duty metal steel door was a man in a chair of his own. He wasn’t tied down like Tony was, merely content to read his paper and steal glances at Tony after every paragraph or so.
Steve loomed over him, an impressive tower of strength and rage. His piercing blue eyes stark against the blood on his skin. He could see the hacksaw off to his left, Rumlow had sown the seeds of his own execution it seemed.
He was good at this. In the army, spotting the little details was a skill of his. An unusual settlement of dirt that covered up an IUD. A shadow that didn’t fit in with the surroundings that gave away the position of a sniper. Steve could spot things like that from a mile away, it was the only way to keep his team safe. That was before the mission that changed everything, that was before he was left for dead with nothing but miles and miles of desert in every direction. That skill had belonged to Steve Rogers, The Captain preferred the ‘shoot and see who flinches’ approach.
Steve pulled his phone out of the jacket pocket currently around Tony and offered it to him, “You can’t tell them about me or Hydra.”
Steve turned to look her at, this young woman whom once had been a fifteen-year-old kid on the wrong side of starving, "I can't make you sign them. I won't force you, it's your decision."
The sound of his phone was too loud in the quiet space, a bump back to reality that had Bucky pulling back and squaring his shoulders and Steve digging into the pocket of his jeans for his phone.
Bucky held his gaze for a second longer and then he was gone, slipping deftly out of the room, barely breezing past Tony in his haste to leave. Steve could hear his feet on the stairs, heavy thuds that got duller as they climbed.
Tony’s fingers went to Steve’s thighs on either side of his body, letting himself slip down further to get comfortable, “Well, a job I thought would be done in an hour might actually take me two days and we closed early today so I could drive Peter and Ned to the vet. Apparently, Ned is actually a girl and she is expecting kittens.”
“And you’re slacking off.” Tony jested, “Is this what my tax dollars are paying for? Cops who take leisure days?”
“You’re here to arrest me?” Steve asked dangerously, fingers twitching for the gun at his back but he held firm. Nothing in Fury’s body language pointed to aggression or cockiness.
“There were talks from higher up the food chain about what to do if Ross failed. I was put on Ross’ taskforce to evaluate how he ran it and the level of its success. I was offered a chance at a promotion if Ross couldn’t get the job done. I’d be heading a unit that specialises in gang crime and gang violence. A way to learn and prevent this type of crime as it grows. If you’re right about Ross then I’m about to land that job.”
Steve gave a small thrust into Tony’s mouth which had Tony pressing him own hips into the mattress to try and calm himself down. This was about Steve. He set a relentless fast pace though, Steve not having use of his hands was teasing enough and Tony desperately wanted to make him fall apart like this.
He laid back down, making Tony follow him so he was sprawled out on Steve’s chest as Steve reached into the beside drawer for the condom and lube he kept there. He rolled Tony over was he was on his side, facing away from Steve before Steve turned to spoon him, pressing his front against Tony’s back.
“The same as ever. Baby won’t sleep through the night. We’re running on coffee and routine at this point.” Adam replied, “Sorry to hear about Coulson.”
So, that was it. He wanted to make sure Steve didn’t have something up his sleeve to get himself off the hook for this. A written confession would make a trial very easy and assure Ross the conviction he needed from The Captain. It was smart.
Tony shook his head. No way, he was out. He was done. He was free of Howard and he promised himself he wasn’t going back. But then he thought about those bombs in Rumlow’s hands. He thought about Steve willing to rot in a cell to do the right thing and Peter, so young and innocent, he shouldn’t have to live in fear of a man like Rumlow because Tony was too much of a coward to make this deal.
Tony smirked, making a show of breathing hot air over Steve’s dick just to watch it twitch at the sensation before he ran his tongue over the base. Steve’s head fell back, the moan escaping his lips was pure pleasure and Tony couldn’t help but do it again just to watch the way Steve shook against the restraints.
Tony tried not to think about his encounter with The Captain, that kiss that he had replayed in his mind several times over or the red staining his neck. “Yeah, must be a real nightmare.” He sympathised, feeling guilty at the jot of pleasure in his gut at the feeling of those lips on his own.
“You care about him a lot.” Tony commented with a smile, happy to see Steve had this. This family, these people. And now, he also had Tony.
“You can’t sell guns if you can’t pull a trigger on one.” Natasha shrugged, “I’ve always preferred knives.”
Thor pushed off from the doorframe, "I won't sign the papers. If they want to cage me then they can. I won't let them strip me of everything I am and tell me to live a lie."
He hummed, “The Captain, right? King of Brooklyn? The most feared gang leader in New York.” He didn’t seem bothered by that knowledge and Steve found himself frowning at the unusual response, “Bike’s almost done. I made some upgrades, more power on the throttle. Your gauge was completely off as well but I fixed that.”
“No, it’s okay.” He took a breath, “I just don’t like thinking about it. Howard wasn’t a stellar father, when he drank, he got angry. My mom passed away and it got worse. I got too old to hide from him.”
“I don’t.” Steve gritted his teeth, “But he’s with me and I’m not leaving him in the hands of Hydra to save my own ass.”
Tony rose to stand at his full height again, eyes on the arc reactor shining softly in his palm, "Well, what do you know?" He muttered softly, "Maybe I am my father's son after all." He couldn't help the bitterness in his voice at that thought, the idea that he was anything like Howard never sat well with him.
Bucky shook his head, “Fuck, tell me this isn’t happening, Punk. Tell me you haven’t lost your damn mind.”
Steve waited, counting the seconds in his head as Sitwell glanced back to him. His left eye twitched again. Steve smiled at him easily. He needed Sitwell to make the first move so Steve could kill him. There was also a part of him that wondered whether Sitwell actually would make it. Steve had always had him pegged as a coward with a lust for power. He stepped into a vacant role within Hydra whereas Steve had fought his way into his.
“Thanks for the drive, Thor.” Tony told the giant in the front seat, “Mind if I borrow your Captain for the night?”
Steve didn’t move to take it, instead his eyes met Tony’s, “This is too risky, you shouldn’t be involved in this. I’ll kill Nat the next time I see her.”
Steve nodded, “Taken from his home recently. There was blood but not much. Door wide open. No demands or note. I have Thor and Bucky down at the shipment yard looking for signs of him.”
“Didn’t you ever find it odd how the special task force only seemed to focus on coming after The Avengers?” Rumlow spat out, blood coating the floor as he turned to turn on his side, “They didn’t so much as pull one of my men in off the streets.”
If Tony wanted to say something, he couldn’t seem to form the words. His pleasure making his pupils blown and his skin shine with sweat. He was moving back against Steve’s hand, fucking himself onto his fingers when Steve was going too slow.
Natasha knew his train of thought, “If you want to burn down an empire, you’re going to need some petrol to make sure it ignites.”
Steve shook his head. Ross was Hydra? When, for how long? Is that why he’d been so focused on getting Steve to trial. Why he didn’t want Fury in charge of the immunity deals and why he was reluctant to take Steve’s offer in the interview room. He was never going to play that card because he was in business with Rumlow.
Steve was close. His whole body was humming, and he was still shaking from the strain he was putting on the restraints. Tony thought he might have heard the material stretch at one point, the seams giving way under Steve’s muscle, but they held him firm and all Steve could do was gasp his way to his orgasm.
Natasha, Bucky and Thor had managed to pick their way across the clearing from the vantage point where Steve had left them. They looked uninjured and Natasha had snowflakes melting into her red hair.
Another scar, running along the width of Steve’s left inner thigh. The line was thinner than the one on his hip, the skin white and healed over. It was older than the first one.
Steve understood that, he uncrossed his arms as his eyes moved from Tony to his newly fixed bike, “You did a good job on this.”
There was no doubt Steve was home, Natasha’s car stood in the driveway like a bright neon sign. Steve was inside. Was he waiting for Tony? He was hoping Tony wouldn’t come back?
Bucky lifted his head, “I’m sorry Steve, I think you’ve lost your goddamn mind. With everything we are up against right now, I can’t give you the answer you want to hear, Punk. I vote no.”
When he pulled back, he noticed the set of Steve’s shoulders were slightly more relaxed than before, coiled muscle loosening as he shifted back to lay down besides Tony in bed.
The noise was enough to have Tony stirring slightly, he rolled over onto his other side and buried his head into the pillow to block out the noise. Clearly, he wasn’t a morning person. He was asleep again in seconds and Steve was now free of his hold to move.
Tony nodded, “That’s fine. As long as Ross isn’t after them. They’d be safer if we left anyway. They can still have plausible deniability.”
He’d turned the tables on the mechanic of course, when he brought him downstairs and ushered him into the same vintage car they had once fucked in. Tony’s blush as he slid into the passenger seat, no doubt remembering the last time he’d been there was beautiful, and Steve couldn’t resist squeezing his knee with a smirk as they pulled out.
Howard sighed, his face getting redder from anger by the second, “I need to get the Jericho to work, Tony. I just need you to take a look at the designs and see if you can spot anything out of place with the trigger system. That’s it, you don’t even have to come into the office.”
Steve nodded, “I know. It’s okay. It’s over.” He promised, “Take my hand, okay? We’ll fix it together.”
“You don’t remember?” Rumlow breathed out, “I did hit you on the head pretty hard. I thought I’d killed you there and then.”
Steve was done talking. He thrashed again, this time managing to get the heel of his hand against Rumlow’s throat. He pushed, flipping them over so Rumlow was lying in the blood and Steve had him pinned, using his knees to secure his arms to the ground.
“You come back here and scrub this room clean. Bleach the floor, get rid of the weapon. Take it with you, throw it into the sea. We’ll need to burn Tony’s clothes as well.” Steve ordered, “No trail, no way to tie this back to any of us.”
He scrubbed harder at the floor under his hands, Natasha working next to him, “Thor and I can take care of the body. That’s his remit after all.”
“Oh no, we need to have a little chat.” Rhodey called out and Tony wasn’t sure if he was talking to him or to Steve, but it didn’t matter. He couldn’t stop smiling as he walked out of the police station.
Steve hummed, pulling away when he felt Tony’s arousal pressing against him in the circle of his thighs. Tony was half-hard, and his legs weren’t letting Steve move far. Tony’s lips moved down to Steve’s jaw, mapping out the smooth skin that was sensitive to his touch. Steve shuddered, feeling his own arousal at their position flood through him suddenly. Tony’s lips travelled further, sucking at his pulse point until Steve let out a quiet groan.
“Are you wearing a crop top?” Steve asked, his mouth forming words around the dryness of his throat.
Tony dug through his pocket, holding out the black box he’d spent most of the night creating to show Steve, “It’s a prototype but it should work fine. You hold it up against the lock, press the switch on top to activate it and it will fry the locking system on your cell door. Then you’re on your own.”
"I'm a mob boss, Buck. I'm the King of Brooklyn. Do you really think they'd give me immunity after all the shit I've done?" Steve sighed, "I have to do this. I have to get him out and if I can save you as well then you best believe that's the play I'm going to make."
Tony knew that was a lie. Once Rumlow had seen what he could do, he’d want to keep him around. Tony was a valuable asset, Rumlow wouldn’t be able to give that up.
Steve looked up at him in shock, he hadn’t expected that. Fury was studying him closely, his good eye assessing Steve with a deep sense of conflict. He was searching for something, but Steve wasn’t sure what.
Steve nodded, tearing his lips away from Tony’s skin so he could look him in the eye as his hands worked their way down to the hem of his t-shirt.
“I met someone.” Tony started softly, unsure how to tell Rhodey the full extent of it without telling him about Steve. He couldn’t handle that disappointment on Rhodey’s face today as well.
But Steve needed to see Tony come first, he needed to know what Tony Stark looked like when he came undone. He shifted his weight to one hand, still bracing Tony’s leg as his other reached down between them for his cock.
Steve was starting to dread it every time an envelope was delivered to his doorstep. The note from Fury had brought him nothing but trouble, even the immunity deals with their plain brown envelope were a waste of his time and effort. So now, as Steve stood in the hallway with a white envelope resting in his hand, he couldn’t help but wonder what fresh hell it would bring him. ‘The Captain’ was written across the front in calligraphy and it was jarring to see such a name written so beautifully.
Bucky frowned, reaching into his pocket for the lighter he always carried. Steve knew he hadn’t smoked since before the army, but he still carried a lighter, flipping the lid and striking the fuse repeatedly if he was anxious the way Steve would pace. He passed it to Steve, the cold metal heavy in his palm.
That ended the moment he opened his front door and was greeted with the stern face of his father on the other side, hand raised as if he were about to knock.
Steve rubbed his forehead, pouring himself a helping of scotch before he got back to work. He looked deeper at the files T’Challa had sent over then, removing anyone that didn’t have the right training in tactical operations and weapons. He wasn’t looking for the average army guy, he was looking for someone smart, trained, someone like him.
“If anyone can get him to see reason it’s you, Tony. I truly believe that.” Thor told him, once again his hand returned to the name etched into his hammer.
Bucky was still watching him and suddenly their argument felt so small and stupid when faced with the bigger threat to their family. In his mind, Steve had the start of a plan. A way for The Captain and his team to disappear, create a false identity of who The Captain really was. He could even have T’Challa confirm it as a member of congress, a legitimate figure of truth and authority. Ross would have to believe it. But first, he had to deal with Rumlow because Ross’ manhunt wouldn’t matter either way if Rumlow killed him first.
He was seething, and Bucky’s own rage curled about his shoulders almost making him double in size. He was pacing madly, dodging the abandoned dirty clothes on the floor and the empty glasses that hadn’t found their way to the kitchen yet. Steve took a moment to take in the state of the room. Bucky was never the cleanest person, even in the army his bunk looked like a storm had hit it, but this was something else. The unmade bed where the pillows had been thrown to the floor, the dirty glasses and mugs on every surface. How was Bucky not drowning in this stuff? Steve stepped further into the room, closing the door behind him. He felt a rumple of paper under his boot and looked down to see an old photograph of Bucky and Natasha, taken at Falcon’s on New Year’s Eve last year. Once it was stuck up next to the desk Bucky kept in the corner of the room, now it lay abandoned in the chaos of his room like it was simply another thing he was choosing to ignore.
Steve nodded, “Which brings me to the reason for this meeting. I’m calling a vote to bring Tony into our team. You know how this works; you all get a say. I just want to make it clear that I don’t need your approval on my relationship with him outside of our family. That’s not up for discussion, this is about Rumlow, Tony’s safety and ours. If Rumlow wants him to create weapons, then I want him as far away from that as possible.”
“Ross will interview you, build a case, set a trial. The normal stuff.” Fury shrugged, “You didn’t tell me you were going to kill Rumlow.”
Steve felt his own shiver, moving his hand off Tony’s knee to cover his mouth. Tony was always a vocal lover, it was one of the things Steve loved about him but right now they didn’t need to bring the whole house down to the kitchen because he was shouting out.
“If you need to be mad at me then be mad at me.” Natasha hissed out, “Stop taking it out on Steve, on Tony, on everyone else in this goddamn house.”
“Stop.” Steve replied, while he had no love for Howard, and he knew Tony probably didn’t either this was still his father and Steve wasn’t about to let Rumlow kill him to make a point.
Steve was the one who pulled back first, hand moving to the dried blood on Tony's temple with a scowl, "They'll die for this. I promise. I'm sorry they took you, I didn't think..."
“We have a full house; anyone could walk in.” Steve tried to remind him as he grew hard, blood pooling south.
Tony didn’t follow him. Steve wondered whether it was because he was finally seeing him for what he actually was, or he was realising how screwed he was to have chosen Steve in the first place. Perhaps this was it, the moment Tony walked out the door and didn’t come back.
He hadn’t spent hours thinking about how horrible getting kidnapped was, he had spent those hours figuring out the composition of the door. At least 5-inch-thick steel. The lock was electrical though and could easily be fried with the right equipment, triggering the mechanism and unbolting the door.
Tony took the small device from his pocket, clicking the button to emit a short-range frequency. His eyes drifted up to the camera in the corner of the room, watching as the red light clicked off. He could hear noise and action from outside but ignored it. They didn’t have long, less than two minutes now.
“They can and they have. Three killings make it a serial killer, Cap. Which makes it above my paygrade.” Fury sighed, “I’ll still be on the investigation, but I won’t be running it anymore. This will be the last time we meet.”
Steve knew he was right, but it still didn’t sit well with him. Once Tony was completely naked, he moved over to Steve, hands on his belt.
Didn’t he want this? When he had signed up for this thing with Steve, hadn’t he known it was heading here? Tony had offered Steve his home, his body, his heart willingly because there was something about Steve that drew him in, something he couldn’t say no to.
His hair was everywhere, sticking up in all directions and definitely needed a wash. His skin was sallow and there were dark circles under his eyes that showed how little sleep he’d gotten. Well, fuck you Steve Rogers. This was fine, a hot shower and coffee and he’d be good as new.
“We’re not doing this.” Rhodes replied, “We aren’t talking about Tony right now. Get on your knees, I’m taking you back to your cell.”
He stood there proudly, cock flush against his stomach and a wide grin on his face, “Are you going to fuck me here?”
“I’d love to pick your brain some time. Surely if we put our heads together, we could create something incredible.” Hammer was saying, eyes lighting up like Christmas. Was he flirting? Tony’s back was ramrod straight and Steve could tell by his shoulders he was uncomfortable.
There was something about having him like this, under the haze of sleep in the early morning chill that was so domestic it made Steve want to shy away from it. He wasn’t used to it, having the luxury of taking his time with his lover. Tony however was seemingly impatient, his cock shiny with precome as his chest fell again.
“When I was a kid. I was always drawing something. I stopped when I went into the army. There wasn’t much down time for stuff like that but when I came back Sam brought me the sketchpad and told me to start again. He thought it might help me find some peace, I think.” Steve replied.
“Steve, I can’t do this job without you and I really don’t want to have to watch your trial. Orange isn’t your colour.”
He could smell Tony on him, the sharp tang of engine oil, something sweeter like unroasted coffee beans and a musky smell. Sandalwood maybe, or something equally earthy. It was fogging up his mind. Steve needed to be clear on this. Bucky was right, whatever Hydra was planning, it would need all of Steve’s focus to beat it and he would beat it.
“Because you’re not under arrest, not yet anyway.” Ross replied, pushing himself off of the desk to stand again, “You’ve got a clean record. No blood on you. I can’t arrest you for sleeping with a mob boss.”
He couldn’t stop shaking though and when he opened his mouth, he was almost ashamed to hear the ragged breathes that torn through his throat. Is this what it felt like to survive? To look evil in the eye and call it by its name?
Steve wanted to tell him something good and reassuring but it would be a lie and Tony wouldn’t want it. He’d want the truth. Steve sighed, hands mindless soothing the skin of Tony’s shoulders, “No.” He breathed, “But it will get easy. One day you’ll wake up and realise you didn’t have that same nightmare like every other night. One day you’ll be able to look at the sight of blood and not think back to that room downstairs. You’ll be able to breathe a little better and sleep a little longer. You’ll be able to say his name without wanting to throw up. It doesn’t stop Tony, you just make room for it.” He paused, gauging Tony’s reaction. He nodded, like that was the answer he was expecting, “You’re a survivor, Ross tried to take that away from you and you told him no. I know you can survive this. Otherwise, even now, he still wins.”
“What you should be concerning yourself with is how you’re going to pull that trigger without a hand.” Steve replied.
Fury let out a breath and scrubbed his hand over his face, “Shit.” He muttered, “Stay with him, don’t let anyone else in. Lock the door until I come back.”
“Is Tony okay?” Steve asked instead, mind reeling. He couldn’t focus on anything else, not the lifeline Fury had offered him slipping through his fingers, not even his own fate. His mind was a constant buzz of Tony, Tony, Tony.
Steve gave her a small smile he hoped was encouraging, “Make a phone call then go and get our archer.”
Steve wanted to laugh, “The right way? You think it’s the right way because you wear a badge and answer to the law? Hydra isn’t playing by your rules, Fury, they’re playing by mine. You think you’ll beat them if you stay on the neat side of things and have a code you can live by? Only way to win against them is to get your hands bloody.”
Steve ushered Thor into his office when they reached the attic, already heading for the whiskey he kept on his shelf and two glasses and Thor made himself comfortable on the small leather couch Steve had placed in the corner of the room.
“That won’t kill you, but it is going to hurt like a bitch.” Steve told him, “Let’s try an easier question. What’s the plan? Kill a few cops, get my team to take the fall?”
Then it shifted. Steve tugged Tony closer by their joined hands, rolling onto his back with a groan against the mattress until Tony was settled above him. His body lined against every inch of Steve’s, he could feel the muscles under his skin jump against his own, the way Steve’s cock jerked and grew firmer as Tony settled above him. The expanding motion of Steve’s ribcage matched his as they settled into their warmth under the covers that had slipped down to their waists.
Steve nodded, “You’re going to be alright. Right, Bruce?” Steve replied, looking at Bruce. Bruce’s face was filled with sorrow, “Bruce!” Steve demanded.
Steve smiled, "That's what they all say. That's good, at least I know you won't piss yourself when I kill you."
It was Tony that reached for him, pulling him to his feet and back to his full height and mashed their lips together again.
Tony kissed him again, harder this time. His hands were threading into Steve’s hair, pulling him down as his legs squeezed Steve closer. This kiss was far more suggestive than Steve’s had been, Tony’s tongue slipping into his mouth slowly.
“Well, when you stop drawing Bambi eyes, this came for you early.” Bucky replied, pulling an envelope out of his pocket and passing it to Steve.
Bucky knew, “Brooklyn will have a new King on the throne.” He sighed, “Fuck, what is that psycho doing in our city?”
Steve took a deep breath, “I can’t read you; you know? Every time I try to work out what you’re thinking, and I get nothing. You’re right, I came after you because the thought of you being hurt makes my stomach churn. It went against everything I should have done to protect myself and my team and I don’t completely understand it myself. The effect you have on me.”
He glanced back at Tony, who was doing as good a job of holding himself together as he could. Steve had released his hand to turn on the shower and let the water warm up and Tony had wrapped his arms around himself instead like he was trying not to lose anything.
Bucky was clearly getting angry, his tone more clipped than before, “We might have had the chance to be happy, Nat, but you decided differently.”
He’d call T’Challa after his shower and push him on getting the list of names over to him as soon as possible. There were a lot of unknowns right now and Steve hated not knowing. He couldn’t plan for something he didn’t know about.
“It’s okay, I had backup.” His eyes drifted down to Tony for a moment, “We have just started a war though.”
“I’m guessing this wasn’t part of your plan?” Fury’s voice echoed as he stepped into the room, he carried an air of something about him, but no pity or judgement laced his voice and for that Steve was grateful.
Fury huffed, “We can’t give you a deal like the others. You’re big league. Ross will rip up the paperwork and play the innocent but if we created a false trail that suggests you’ve been an informant of mine for a long time. Years. Then Ross wouldn’t be able to make that disappear. I’ll go on record and say it’s true and in return you give me everything you have on Hydra so we can bring them down the right way.”
“If you can’t find anything then you need to promise you’ll let me do whatever I need to do to bring down Rumlow.” Steve replied.
“I’d rather not.” Tony sighed, stepping closer to Howard even though every instinct was telling him to run. Bucky moved with him, silent but never far away, “I’m here for business.”
“You were hit. In the med tent. I paid a couple of guys to drag you out whilst you were high on morphine. You barely put up a fight. The great Captain. Weak and pathetic. I almost felt sorry for you.” Rumlow replied.
Tony let out a frustrated whine, hips rutting against him in such a brutal pace Steve wouldn’t be surprised to have bruising on his thigh tomorrow. His hands tested the restraints again, if he could get free then he could make Tony come but that wasn’t the purpose of the exercise he knew. Tony wanted him to watch, to see him coming apart and knowing Steve was all he was thinking about. This was about proving that he was Steve’s.
Bucky still had his gun trained on Howard and Tony watched his father’s eyes flick over to him every few seconds. It was a rare thing to see Howard Stark show fear.
Tony gave him a meek smile. Really, on top of everything else he had to convince Steve to stop being an idiot and save himself? They were all doomed.
What caught Tony’s caught was the scar that run from the edge of the man’s eyebrow down towards the bottom of his cheek, a red puckered angry line that didn’t look like he healed quite right. He might have been handsome once, with his dark hair and broad frame but that scar marring his face drew all attention to it. Tony wondered if he preferred it that way.
Tony was panting and sweating, and Steve knew he was close, his fingers were stretching him open and his cock was leaving a wetness against his thigh. His whole body was shaking as he watched Tony lose himself to his pleasure.
Steve stood there awkwardly, hands in his pockets and an easy smile on his face. Peter slide past him to get to the door, “If you hurt him…”
Steve tried, managing to hold eye contact for a few seconds before he dropped his gaze. Tony shouldn’t have to see him like this, riding the high of what he was about to do. The downfall he’d have to work through after.
Tony rolled his hips again, a little gasp escaping his mouth at the build up of friction, “You already are.”
Tony turned in his arms as much as possible in the small space, looking at Steve softly, “That’s a big step.”
“Autopsy shows the mark was carved into him whilst he was still alive.” Fury bit out and Clint could see the glint in his eye. Cops protect their own. Just like Steve did.
Tony smiled and waited for the voices to die down before pressing forward, “You give me five years and I’ll give you a fully self-sustaining Brooklyn. A city where children don’t have to know what it’s like when their parents can’t afford to pay the electricity bill. A city where children aren’t getting sick and weak from something as basic as no heating. We need to change the future. No, we can change the future and it starts right here in Brooklyn.” Tony finished, eyes staring straight into the camera and locking with Steve like he was talking directly to him. Steve felt his heart give a weird flip-flop in his chest, remembering a time not so long ago when he had told Tony his own story about growing up sick and poor in this very city.
This kiss was filled with everything to come. A future, a life. It was a promise and a declaration of everything they felt and wanted to express. Steve took his time exploring Tony’s mouth like it was the first time and he felt Tony shuffle closer, right to the edge of the counter. He was trusting Steve’s weight to support him and Steve made sure to grip his legs firmly in his hands as they kissed.
He moved onto his knees, letting Tony part his legs wide as Steve squeezed some of the lube onto his fingers. He spread it around generously, warming up the gel before tossing the tube to one side and moving his fingers to Tony’s hole. He circled the rim slowly before inserting a finger, feeling Tony tense around the intrusion for a moment. Steve waited, wanting Tony to be comfortable before he felt him relax and allowed his finger to move even deep inside of him.
Tony felt sick as he made his way up to Rhodey’s office the next morning. He smelt of sweat and there was an acidic tint about him that reminded him of Clint’s blood, still staining the couch in Steve’s house from where Bruce had worked to get the bullet out the night before.
“Then I’ll have to pay your friends a little visit.” Rumlow said, “The hardworking cop. Rhodes, right? We’re watching him, I had considered making him the next murdered cop. Fury would have to make an arrest for his own partner surely?”
“You’ll be sleeping in the wet patch.” Steve reminded him with a smile and a kiss against his shoulder.
Steve slammed his head down again and Rumlow’s eyes rolled back. His vision was off centre, and his grip was loosening around Steve’s wrist.
He didn't even spare a glance behind him to see if Bucky and Natasha had followed his command. They would, he knew, they always did when it mattered. Steve was half crouched, half running towards the warehouse where the noise originated from. His eyes glancing down the barrel of his gun.
Steve left it at that, walking out of the room before anyone else could question him. He didn’t have a plan, not really. He had no idea how he was going to get the cops to Rumlow and see he was making bombs. And even if he managed to do that, he had no idea how he was going to get out of this one himself when the world knew his name. It was a no-win situation and he couldn’t tell his family that. He couldn’t look at them, knowing they trusted him to see them through this and have no idea how to get them there.
“What about the company, the legacy?” Howard asked him, “We’ve secured a new contract. A lot of money coming in, a lot of new tech. This is big for us and I want you to be a part of it.”
He examined the photos from the crime scene in meticulous detail, inch by inch. The body looked too staged and there was no blood or signs of a control at the docks so it had been placed there. Steve wondered if the police had worked that out already? They tended to be a bit slow. The mark itself was indeed the Avengers symbol, a large ‘A’ that had been first designed by Steve on a napkin at Phillip’s request for some kind of gang tag. The mark itself was sloppy and hastily done, clearly done while the victim was still alive and moving judging from the awkward shift in the lines and how some parts were deeper than others.
Tony’s hand found his, gripping it fiercely as he turned back to look at Steve again, “We’ll do it together, for every little boy who grew up alone and scared and dealing with shit they shouldn’t ever to.”
He shot once. Twice. Taking out two men from the doorway and effectively clearing his entry point. Steve slipped inside easily, body coiled like a spring ready to fight and a flutter of snow starting to fall from the sky.
“Detective Ross?” Rhodey pushed the door open and Tony couldn’t look away from the body on the ground with him, “Fuck. Tony.”
Steve pulled back slightly, taking in the lust in Tony’s eyes. They were dark and blown with desire and if that wasn’t the hottest thing Steve had ever seen. Tony was still lazily rolling his hips against Steve’s, searching for some kind of friction to ease the bulge in his pants as his hands worked their way out of Steve’s shirt to go straight for the buttons. Steve smirked as Tony hastily popped the buttons, revealing Steve’s chest to him. Was it his imagination or did Tony just lick his lips?
He should be getting in the shower and heading to the garage because he had a service coming in at lunchtime and a new part to install on Mr Kingsley’s Jeep and Peter definitely shouldn’t be left on his own for more than a few hours because otherwise he’d OD on subs from the sandwich shop on the corner.
Rumlow sighed, kicking Howard so he rolled over onto his back in the dirt. One of his eyes was swollen shut and Steve wasn’t sure he could even form a sentence, “You want to know your problem, Captain? I knew what it was the moment we met in Afghanistan.” Rumlow told him, rising to his feet, “You care. And because of that you put your faith in people. Other people were always going to be the reason for your downfall. Starting with him.”
Steve could feel the dried blood clinging to his face, making his beard itch and a rusted copper tang assault his nose whenever he breathed too deeply.
Tony mumbled around the screwdriver in his mouth, “Fuck, Pete, what did the report show from the oil levels?”
Tony nodded, “That was true once but honestly, I’d rather take the heat then watch this company’s body count rise.”
Tony’s eyes were closed in bliss, hands fisted into the bedsheets as Steve withdrew his finger to the tip and pushed back in again. He did it a few more times, feeling the pull and stretch from Tony until he was happy that he could add another finger. Tony gasped and bucked his hips against Steve’s hand at the addition of a second digit. His hands gripping the sheets as Steve worked him open, scissoring his fingers to help stretch Tony further. He curled them inside of Tony’s heat when they were buried inside of him, searching for that spot that would make Tony see stars.
His blue eyes had turned dark, the bulge in his pants a lot bigger than before and even while he was tied to the bed Steve was still tracking his every move like a lion would a deer. It made Tony shiver delightfully.
“Don’t worry. We handled it. Two hours, alright? Get ready to walk out of there.” Steve promised before ending the call.
“I’d just taken over the gang, Phillips was dead. Hydra thought it would be easier to take me out before I started rebuilding. Some happy-go-lucky bastard cornered me in an alleyway with a bunch of thugs.” Steve told him; eyes unreadable.
“I don’t know!” Sitwell cried out, “I know he’s ex-army. I know he has plans. He wants your patch, Captain. He wants you gone and he’ll stop at nothing to get it.”
“And here Steve told me you were a genius.” Bucky sighed, “You’re kind of dumb for a genius, you know?”
“Okay, who do I need to arrest?” Rhodey asked gruffly, he sounded like he needed a good night’s sleep. The question was meant to make Tony laugh, but the realness of the situation had him sniffling again.
“Clint still needs to stay low in case the cops are still watching him,” Bucky pointed out, “Nat and I will be fine. We aren’t children, Steve.”
Tony wasn’t looking at him and Steve knew he needed to get him to look away from the body, he didn’t want it to be the only think Tony saw when he closed his eyes. He got closer, if he stretched out his arm, he’d be able to brush Tony’s knee but he didn’t try it. Tony was holding himself together in a state of shock right now and Steve knew any sudden contact or movements would shatter it. He saw this a lot in the war, young soldiers who suddenly learned what they had signed up for in a violent outcry of blood and bullets. He’d heard them cry at night for their mothers and pray to their Gods. He watched them strip away every ounce of their humanity in order to survive the job.
Tony was still moving against him, grinding his hips every chance he got to heighten his friction and keep Steve inside him for a little while longer and Steve lost some of his own control because his own hips were stuttering upwards to increase his thrusts. The combination of Tony’s mouth against his earlobe and his cock filling him was too much.
The last two Hydra guys went for Thor, as Sitwell had probably ordered them to. Thor watched their approach with a wide grin, all teeth and joy. He brought the hammer up as if it weighed nothing and took a swing. He knocked the first guy in the side of the head, the sound heavy and hollow before a body hit the floor. Thor never left a job unfinished though and smashed the hammer down onto his face for extra measure.
“That’s why I don’t want to do it.” Rumlow agreed, “The choice is yours, Tony. You build the missile without the motivation; prove to be a good little worker and I promise I won’t have to kill everyone you love to force you to do it.”
He barely got three feet in the door before a force hit him suddenly, knocking Tony to the floor in the direction of the kitchen island with a heavy thud. The force had him hitting his head on the floor as he fell before another body landed on top of him, Tony grunted, keeping hold of the umbrella on his way down.
Ross’ body stuttered, giving up the fight that Tony had won. His body went lax as Tony pulled the letter opener out with a shaky hand, more blood gushing down his hand and onto the floor between them.
Tony sighed at himself in the mirror, letting the covers drop to the floor as a mark of his commitment to this plan. He needed a sandwich too, maybe a sub from Peter’s favourite shop. He could bring the kid one too as a peace offering.
“God, yes please.” Tony replied, if only to be able to escape the room and pretend to ignore the raised voices from upstairs.
“Cum for me.” He ordered, bringing his lips to Tony’s despite the pressure the angle put on his still tied arm and pulled him in for a bruising kiss.
Tony slipped the umbrella out of the stand, feeling the weight in his hand and being mildly comforted by the fact he now had a weapon of sorts. He flicked on the light switch that was just inside the door, flooding his apartment in light.
Their words tumbled together and either bothered to answer because then they were moving again. Colliding into each other as Steve cupped his cheek and drew him in. Tony fused their lips together, kissing him soundly.
“Tony,” Steve groaned, wishing he had the space to throw his head back and just lose himself in the feel of this but his pleasure was on the edge without a way over and he knew he was about five seconds away from taking Tony with a carnal passion until they both came.
Steve has to bite his lip to keep himself from moaning as Tony preps him. The air smells of sex and is making his head swim, or maybe that was just Tony. Tony, who’s hand was currently stroking down Steve’s cock in a ruse of spreading the lube onto him but really was simply to tease.
“Hey, I’m going to take it. I just didn’t want to make a big decision like that without talking to you or the team first.” Steve explained, “I’m not making anymore decisions without you. Partners, right?”
Bucky was silent in the room, standing near the window looking at his feet. Steve’s eyes went to him now, he was the last to cast his vote and Steve was worried by his omission from the group discussion.
Tony bucked against him, throwing a leg over Steve’s side to draw him closer. He broke their kiss to pant against Steve’s cheek, hands holding him in a vice grip as Steve hit his prostrate again. He worked Tony’s body relentlessly, feeling his pants dampen his cheek and vibrate through his ear. He felt his fingers digging deeper into his shoulders and his body start to shudder towards release also involuntary.
“What about breakfast?” Bucky called out as he moved past him to change. Steve whirled back, grabbed a piece of French toast of the plate Bucky had delivered and shoved it into his mouth before heading back to his bedroom.
Steve’s eyes drifted out to sea again, “I know who I am, and I know what I’ve become to survive. I live with that; I live with everything I’ve ever done to still be standing in front of you right now. The army, the gang, all of it. I’ll live with it, but they shouldn’t have to.”
“No? What about Sam Wilson? Or Thor Odinson? How about Natasha Romanoff?” Rumlow sneered, “They were easier to find when I knew what I was looking for.”
“Like a schoolgirl. I’m telling you, Steve, bridges are being mended. They’re healing and moving on.”
Tony cut him off, “No, we’re not doing this here. I’m still mad at you. I don’t want to hear it. We have to move.”
“People who know my name don’t tend to live very long.” Steve replied, the weight of the threat in the air but Tony seemed to breeze past it.
“Tony, my boy!” He greeted, straightening up in his seat as Tony eyed the alcohol with a tight stomach, “We’re celebrating a new deal going through. Have a glass.”
Tony looked good like this, tanned skin against white sheets. That crazy hair of his was even crazier in the morning light that filtered through the bedroom and Steve had to fight the urge to run a hand through it and push it away from his forehead. That wasn’t something a mob boss should think about.
It was enough to raise alarm bells because Tony definitely remembered slamming it shut that morning in his haste to leave.
“This is my place of work, alright. I can’t just be walking the halls with a mob boss like we’re best friends.” Fury replied with a scowl.
Steve glanced at him knowing he had just been played, “Of course I am.” He huffed, “I’ll head back tomorrow, Thor. Can we make sure a detail is set up for Rhodes and Peter?”
Tony closed the gap between them, hands coming up to curve along Steve’s neck, “Maybe I can help with that? Get you out of your head?”
Tony thrust his hips up, “I want you inside of me.” He was so confident and breathless and Steve was amazed he didn’t come in his damn pants then and here.
Steve shook his head, Rumlow was messing with him. He needed to stay focused, but he could remember it. The medical tent, the bandages pressing against his skin. He could hear Rumlow’s laugh in the hot air of the evening and felt the sharp impact of something on the back of his skull.
“I think so.” Steve sighed, “There could be a gang war on the streets of Brooklyn before Christmas.”
“Wait, what about Rumlow?” Tony asked, “He’s building bombs, Steve. That’s why he took me. My dad told him I could engineer him something powerful so he could sell it.”
“Okay, I knocked out the camera. We can talk properly now.” Tony told him, slipping the device back into his jacket pocket.
Steve grinned, “Mind if I steal my fella back from you?” He slipped his hand back into Tony’s as he guided them away from Hammer standing frozen by the drinks table watching them leave.
“I used to think so, too.” He heard Bucky called out softly as he started up the stairs for his much-needed shower.
“Make a statement about tonight’s events. A testimony to Steve Rogers’ killings and his gang activity. In return I won’t charge you with being an accessory to murder.” Ross replied.
Because he had come for him. Even when Tony himself hadn’t believed he would, hadn’t dared to hope. Steve had still come for him. That knowledge made Tony’s stomach flit uncomfortably, it was what prompted him to make his confession last night. They weren’t fuck buddies; they were barely that but that current underneath the sex that neither one wanted to address had been brought to the forefront when he had rounded the corner to find Steve looking for him.
Then he was going directly to Steve, to make sure he knew who Rumlow was and why he was such a threat. Tony would happily watch while Steve killed him because Rumlow had dared to come after Rhodey and Peter. He threated Tony’s family, and suddenly he understood Steve a little better. The urge to protect the people he loved, rising in the pit of his chest and overwhelming him until it was the all thing he could focus on.
Normally it wasn’t this consuming for him. The sex. He enjoyed it, of course, and he always made sure his partner finished but Steve always kept one eye on the nearest exit as a planned escape route and had a mental note of where he left his clothes if he needed to leave in a hurry. He was more than a little confused to find he hadn’t worried about either of those things since Tony had let him inside and even now, all of his attention went to Tony.
“I know you can hear me!” Clint continued to shout, eyes on the two-way mirror, “I know you’re watching.”
“I’m not handing myself over to Rumlow, but this plan won’t work and when it fails, you’ll all be in the firing line.” Steve replied, “So, you need to walk away. Now. Forget about me. I can’t give you anything.”
He moved home when he ran out of money and courses to study, he was armed with three PhD’s and was fluent in three different languages but he missed Brooklyn. The streets and the feel and the winters. It was his home and he wasn’t about to let Howard take that from him as well. He had taken enough from Tony.
“Where the hell have you been?” Bucky asked as Steve closed the door behind him, he couldn’t help but feel like a teenager being caught sneaking home past curfew.
“You were being reckless!” Natasha shouted as Steve rounded the corner to see them. She was standing at one end of the kitchen table, placed in the centre of the space. Her hands were on her hips and Steve could feel her anger from where he stood in the doorway.
Steve swore again, hips losing their rhythm as his pleasure raced towards the edge, teasing him with each movement of his hips. Tony was moving with him, hips bucking off the bed as he used Steve’s body for leverage and gripped the sheet until his knuckles were white in his other hand. This angle was clearly working for both of them.
Thor was currently decorating the pavement at his feet with blood and brain matter and Steve was more than happy to leave him to it as he focused on the gun taking him on. He wasn’t very well built and seemed around the same age as Steve. It was very unlikely that he’d been through half the shit Steve had though, he looked too green. Briefly, Steve wondered what Sitwell had told him to get him to come on a suicide mission to kill The Captain and destroy the Avengers. Was it money? Legacy? A high-ranking place in whatever new Hydra regiment was happening?
That sounded like heaven from Tony’s lips and Steve could feel his stomach tighten at the sultry look in Tony’s eyes, “Tony, you don’t need…”
Tony shook his head, “I’d rather work as a mechanic then wake up every morning and question whether I still have a soul.”
“The others are brainstorming; we’ll figure it out.” Tony told him, handing slipping off Steve’s back as he moved round to face him.
Tony’s eyes were pleading, he needed this. He needed Rhodey but he wasn’t good at telling people he needed them so he did this. He hid it behind sarcasm and wit and hoped they didn’t notice. Rhodey knew him better than that.
There was an umbrella abandoned near the kitchen island, Tony must have grabbed it. Hydra wouldn’t have needed it. Steve wondered whether Tony was brave or stupid for thinking an umbrella would hold up against guys with guns. The struggle had moved towards the kitchen, the broken china and scattered letters told Steve that Tony had been cornered there and he had fought. It was probably the reason for the blood.
Tony did as instructed, wiggling out of his pants and boxers. His erection was already leaking precome, making him shiver at the cooler air hitting his oversensitive flesh. He settled himself over Steve’s crotch, straddling him as his hands reached out to his pecs.
He was moving as well, heading after his best friend and right-hand man. He squeezed Tony’s shoulder on the way past, “I’m sorry.” He muttered to the mechanic as he left the room, following Bucky up the stairs.
“Do you know who I am?” Steve asked instead, watching as the Mechanic grabbed a wrench and went back to work on the bike in front of him.
“Twelve more to secure my seat. Focus on Everett, he’ll be an easy turn for you. Hill will be slightly harder, she’s stubborn but if we get her vote then we win the vote of her whole party and I’ll have the majority.” T’Challa told him, eyes on the guests as he spoke.
“It’s fine,” Bruce laughed, “Honestly, I’m not supposed to be here. I’ve known The Captain for years, he was still a teenager really. I used to treat him in the early days. I guess he remembered me because after The Avengers became a thing, I got a reluctant job as their doctor.”
Tony flashed him a dirty smile that went straight to Steve’s dick, “Well, I’ll be happy to take you up on that offer as soon as I’m done here.”
He needed to know how far Tony really wanted to go with this. Right now, before Rumlow came and it was too late for him to go back. Steve needed to know now, while he could still see a way for Tony to walk away.
Steve frowned, “You owe me, T’challa. It was my gentle persuasion that got you into office in the first place and you know if you help me, I’ll make sure it stays that way. My people will vote how I tell them to and I’ll back your re-election fully.”
He was on top of Steve before Steve could get his bearings, smashing a fist into Steve’s face with a brutality that Steve knew was from his army days. A blinding rage that guided all his movements. Steve needed to gain the upper hand and fast.
Tony was hard for him, solid against the line of his jeans and gripping the back of Steve’s shirt like a lifeline as Steve continued his attentions on his neck. He licked a strip from base to jaw and Tony shivered at the touch, tugging at the hem of Steve’s shirt enough to get his hands underneath.
“How…?” Clint was cut off by a thud hitting the front door so loud it vibrated through the house all the way to the kitchen.
Sitwell was pleading and snivelling and honestly, Steve was tempted to put a bullet in him just to shut him up but he wanted answers first, “Get him up against the car.” Steve ordered with a scowl, pocketing the gun in his hands into his jacket.
They left him alone in the room after that, Steve watched the seconds tick by on the clock mounted on the wall as he waited for Ross. Another display of power he was making sure Steve understood. He ran the show now, Steve was simply there to watch.
Steve dropped his gun, hands reaching under Bucky’s armpits to pull him inside. Bucky’s head rolled and Steve felt Thor brush past him to check the surrounding area for the culprits. He couldn’t think about that, he held Bucky in his hands, dragging his body into the living room to get out of the line of fire and yelling for Bruce. He was taken back to Afghanistan, clearing bodies out of bombed out houses and laying them in rows at the side of the road to be claimed by survivors. The stench had been unbearable, clinging to his nose for weeks. Now all he could smell was the tang in the air from Bucky’s blood, now coating his own hands and smearing a trail into the floor from where Steve dragged him.
Natasha tilted her head, "You wouldn't leave Brooklyn without a fight, Steve. These immunity deals, if we sign then are you signing too?"
“We have 36 hours before Ross gets the green light for a kill order on us. We have to deal with Rumlow and be in the wind before he gets it.” Steve told them, “Bucky is at the docks gaining intel. We need to take this fight to Rumlow. I need him alive. If we can deliver him to the police then maybe it will keep them busy enough to give us a head start.”
Natasha smiled, “He saved me. He didn’t have to; he didn’t even know me but that’s just what Steve does. When a situation’s pointed south, he can’t walk away. I was fifteen, eating out of dumpsters. Clint and I were stealing what we had to so we could get by.” She paused slightly, steeling herself to continue, “We made a name for ourselves as guns for hire. It was good money; it was easy work for us. Then Steve came along, we were fixing him up to be our next mark, but he got the jump on me. He gave me a different choice. He said he was putting together a gang, wanted me and Clint in on it. Food, a home, we got to decide where we drew the line, what jobs we took. He just needed our loyalty, our word that we wouldn’t sell him out.”
There were barely any signs of life down here at all, it was cold and silent, but Steve didn’t stop to think about it, he was almost home.
Steve had been placed under house arrest, along with the rest of the Avengers as a precaution to his deal with Fury whilst he worked to set up the new unit and convince his superiors that he could control the once Captain and that this path was the best one to achieving their shared aim. That meant he was useless for the first time in years and Steve found himself slowly going crazy. He had his family and Tony around him and that was the important thing, but he hated the constant waiting.
He drained his coffee in seconds, having perfected the art of making it at just the right temperature so he could down it in one go. As soon as the coffee hit his system, he felt more awake and went off for his shower, hoping the warm water would ease the protesting muscles of his lower back and legs.
Tony squared his shoulders, bouncing on the balls of his feet. He had one shot at this and no real plan after he was out. He flexed his hands out, rising up his palm so the arc reactor was pointed at the metal lock, focusing on the complex locking system that kept Tony trapped.
“Shortly after he got to town.” Rumlow replied, “I knew you were working with the cop, figured I’d do one better.”
Isn’t that what he had done? When life with Howard started killing him slowly, degrading him and wearing him down. He had changed, he had evolved. He had survived because Tony understood if he didn’t than he wasn’t going to last the year. It would be the drink or maybe he would have started adding drugs to his mix. He might have partied too hard and foolishly and died before Howard could get just a little too angry to do the job himself.
A few days after Howard’s funeral, Tony called a press conference for Stark Industries, inviting the world and its media to attend. Steve had wanted to be there for him, to show support for his first official press conference as the new CEO but thanks to his house arrest he could do nothing more than sit at home and watch the conference broadcast on television like everyone else.
Steve was in a state of shock himself. Tony had killed Ross? Why? He wouldn’t have done it unless he had to. Steve was sure about that; Tony wasn’t a killer.
Steve felt himself shuddering at the desperation in Tony’s voice. He moved his arm out towards his desk, shoving everything to the floor in one loud sweep so he could bend Tony over it, his ass perfectly curved and on display for him.
“He won’t be much of a genius without his marbles, right? Do you think it would work? Does he care for you enough that losing you will end him?” Rumlow asked.
Peter nodded curtly, throwing Tony a look that suggested they would be talking about this later before he slipped out.
Steve was instantly pulled out of his thoughts when he noticed Tony’s door wide open, immediately his body went stiff and he was reaching for the gun he kept tucked in the waistband of his jeans.
Steve smiled then, because it was so Bucky, it was so them. He had forgotten how much he missed that.
Tony’s cock was shining with precome, glistening and erect as Steve pulled out and buried himself back in again, watching Tony’s body bend to take him. He was breathing into Tony’s ear, mouth sucking a mark into his neck that might be hard to hide tomorrow but Steve didn’t care. Tony loved him, Tony was with him and around him and everything to him.
“Yes.” Tony answered instantly, so sure of himself as those deep brown eyes poured into Steve’s and his hands pushed Steve’s jeans down his legs.
Nat and Clint were close, Steve had recruited them to his side together. Two punks stealing to get by and making a name for themselves as guns for hire. They seemed to think he was worth the loyalty though because Steve had never had the need to doubt them and knew both would have his back in a fight.
There was a steady ooze of liquid from his temple that he already knew was blood. He’d been hit by Howard enough to know the sensation well. His back was killing him, but his attacker was already getting to his feet as well, one hand clutching his side.
But at least he’d be free and alive. He wouldn’t be serving a life sentence in a cell next to Steve’s and driving himself crazy that Loki’s killer was still walking free whilst he was in chains.
“What do you think? There’s a lot to discuss if you’re in but I need to know now, before Ross comes in here to interview you. Once you’re on the record, this gets harder.”
Tony felt the awkwardness rolling off him in waves, “You trust me, right? We’ve been friends for so long now, you have my back?”
Steve panted his way to calming his own heart, slipping out from Tony’s ass before he softened and he felt Tony relax his legs, letting them tangle down the edge of the table. Steve placed his forehead on Tony’s shoulder as he collected himself and Tony stroked his hair gently.
They were just Peter quirks and Tony had come to love that about the kid, he was never boring that was for sure and while he was a genius with grades that almost matched Tony’s own at that age, unlike Tony, Peter had never lost that edge of innocent that let people forget he was still just a kid.
Tony sucked two of his fingers into his mouth, tongue against them as he sucked like he would on Steve’s cock. Steve felt his own breath stutter.
“You set up a very nice picture in my head whilst I was working myself open for you. Time to pay up.”
It was a strange thing, to see your downfall in front of you and not be able to stop it. It was like stepping out in front of a car and being paralysed to move even though it was coming closer. That’s how Steve felt. He could see it all, the downfall of The Captain, the trial of Steve Rogers and the prosecution of The Avengers. Was this how his story goes? The boy who had dreamed of being a soldier, the man who had already died once, was this really how he was going to go out? Hydra on one side and Ross on the other whilst he was backed into a corner?
There was a shout of pain and Tony managed to use his shock to his advantage as he wrestled himself free of his attacker, umbrella tight in his grip.
Thor and Bruce had the next floor down. There was a spare room there for Sam, if and when he needed it, but mostly he stayed in the apartment over the bar. Bruce was the only doctor crazy enough to allow Steve to pay him to stitch them all up with no questions asked and absolute discretion. In return, Steve promised to never ask Bruce to represent the gang in the field. He’d taken an oath to do no harm and Steve knew he took it seriously. He was a brilliant doctor and sometimes Steve felt a little selfish to have taken him away from the hospital but Bruce was on the verge of getting fired when Steve found him so at least this way he was able to keep his license and help people in some capacity. Even if those people were questionable characters at best and murders at worst.
Steve sighed, turning around to face his best friend, “I took the night off, I needed to let off some steam.”
Tony nodded, “Yeah, piece of cake.” He looked at Steve then, “Does this mean I’m not staying in the car?”
“Fuck.” Steve cursed as Tony moved his hips against him in reckless abandonment and Steve tried to keep up with him.
He was typing out a message before he could stop himself, reasoning that this way the ball was in Tony’s court and he’d probably just ignore the message anyway. Tony was probably the type of guy who had his head on right, besides there was more reason for him to stay away from Steve than the other way around. Steve was dangerous and a killer and definitely not the kind of man you planned anything long term with.
Sam was the one to reply, “It’s what you do to protect family, right? If anyone understands that then it’s us.”
“Sitwell.” Steve greeted, pushing off from his bike to stand tall. He’d ridden across town for the meeting alone, despite Natasha’s advice against it, and despite the chill stinging his cheeks it had given him a chance to really appreciate his city. That was something Steve rarely got to do these days; he was too busy protecting it from people like Sitwell.
Steve grit his teeth, pushing Tony behind his body as he saw the five men blocking their path. Snow was falling heavily behind them, a mark of freedom as it blurred the city skyline. It wasn’t even a showdown. Five guys with guns against Steve, bleeding and unarmed. He was good but he wasn’t invincible and even he couldn’t see a way through those odds.
Steve felt his blood run cold, “I’ll end you, Rumlow. I’ll carve the same ‘A’ into your chest as you did in those cops and I’ll leave your body out for everyone to see.”
He slammed the door in his father’s face, and he didn’t feel bad about doing it. He could feel the heat rush to his face and the shaking of his hands caused him to drop the keys to the floor. Tony wasn’t seventeen anymore though, he was a survivor. That was why he waited until he heard Howard’s expensive shoes sounding his retreat before Tony allowed himself a moment to crumple, legs giving out under him as his back slid down the door. He refused to cry; he wouldn’t give Howard that power over him. He never had, even when he was beating him.
“Because I believe you. I believe you want to help your city and I’m offering you that chance. You’re not a monster, Steve, no matter what you think of yourself. You’re a war veteran who saw some messed up shit fighting another man’s war and who couldn’t shake it. I’ve seen killers up close and you’re not like them.” Fury replied softly.
Tony reached up with his hand, tangling his fingers with Steve’s as he stretched it out underneath Tony’s head. Then Steve pushed into him hard, slamming in until he was buried to the hilt and Tony was panting. He had to bury his head into Tony’s shoulder just to keep himself together. He had damn near told Tony he loved him in that moment and that thought scared him more than he wanted to admit. That was a feeling he hadn’t come to terms with himself, let alone letting Tony about it.
Ross leaned forward then, hands spread out over the papers on the desk in front of him, “I bet you think you’re really good at this. The great Captain, lording over everyone, but I can assure you Mr Rogers, you will never see your family again.”
The man in question was still asleep, curled up to Steve’s side with his head resting on Steve’s chest and a leg thrown carelessly between Steve’s under the sheets. They were a tangle of limbs in a room that smelt purely of sex.
On his knees, his mouth moved lower, tongue tasting its way down Tony’s abs as they jumped under his touch. Steve’s hands came up to dig his fingers into the material of Tony’s jeans, hooking into the waistband to pull them and his boxers down together. He went slowly, reveal inch by inch of new skin as his mouth followed the trail his hand had created. Tony’s hands were in his hair, softly gripping as he gasped, feeling Steve’s hot breath on his dick. He let the jeans pool at Tony’s ankles, his mouth moving back up to nip at his defined hipbones as Tony kicked off his shoes, jeans and boxers in one mangled heap.
Thor sighed, “Darkness. A frayed part of our souls that refused to let go. It’s a kind of desperation that drives darkness like that. A need to protect, to avenge the people you care about no matter what the cost.”
Tony let him go, a million questions burning on the back of his throat. Clearly, there was more to Steve than everyone else knew. A side to The Captain that wasn’t all blood and death and business. A side that Tony had gotten a glimpse of when they first kissed, when they had slept together.
Steve wanted to run, he wanted to open the door and put the broken pieces of his family back together, but he couldn’t. It wasn’t his place.
“I’m sure you’ll remember something useful while you work.” Rumlow replied, “If not, I can always persuade you.”
Steve was covered in blood, the back spray coating his face and beard and his hands were slick with both their blood as well. He looked like a nightmare and Rumlow was dead.
Rumlow paid him no attention, not even when Steve managed to push a finger into Rumlow’s eye socket and pull it away bloody. “I’ll make him suffer the most. Maybe I’ll lock him in a cell with your dead body?” Rumlow mused, “How long do you think it will take for him to lose his mind?”
He didn’t want that for Tony. That torment. That fractured piece of your soul that could never repair itself. Steve had gotten better at killing because he had to, he was ordered to. Now, even though he could remember the names and the faces, he couldn’t see them when he closed his eyes anymore. He was also more scared of that than he was of the nightmares.
Tony recoiled slightly from the blast, his muscles pulling from the strain of the force of using the arc reactor. He'd be sore tomorrow, but he'd see tomorrow and that thought kept him moving.
“Thor grab my medical grab from the kitchen. We need to get this bullet out.” Bruce told him and Thor was off in an instant, “Clint, you’re going to be fine. It’s not deep but I need to take the bullet out, okay?”
“I joined the army to help people and I think I took more lives than I saved.” Steve sighed, “You get an order, you follow it. You don’t always agree with it. I couldn’t live like that so when I got back it was like nothing had changed in Brooklyn. I fought for peace a million miles away, but my own home was suffering. I joined Phillips’ gang because I couldn’t look at those streets and see it anymore. I liked it, being able to make a difference and see those same streets changing. It felt like it mattered. That’s why I took over, because if I didn’t then all that fight and change would have been for nothing.”
Stark Industries was a skyscraper to the masses in the heart of New York, Howard Stark’s own personal throne and Tony knew that’s where his father would be. Bucky was a silent companion for the most part, sitting in the passenger seat of Tony’s car after they had gone to pick it up like a phantom that might disappear at any moment. The silence was stifling, and Tony couldn’t help but glance at Bucky every now and again to check he was still there.
Pierce stepped forward, “Will you? Even with him?” He nodded towards the party and Steve knew he meant Tony, “What is it about a mechanic that appeals so much to you?”
Were they trying to use Tony to lure Steve in? If so, that was the dumbest thing Tony had ever heard. Steve might have fucked him a few times but that didn’t mean he was about to risk his safety and the safety of his team to come after him.
“Of course. High levels of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur. Nothing out of the ordinary. They store charcoal at the docks anyway and the others are found in composted soil to help plant vegetation.” Adam replied, eyes on Coulson’s body.
Steve closed his mouth more firmly over Tony’s cock, not giving him the chance to slide out again. He swallowed around him, feeling Tony’s hips move against his face and his hand tighten in Steve’s hair before Steve sucked him hard. He sunk his cheeks in and brought Tony closer to him with the hands guiding his butt and he sucked him down.
“It’s my night off. I need a drink.” Steve shouted back before disappearing onto the street, hat and sunglasses still in place.
She closed up on the subject then, her body going stiff and her eyes cold and Steve knew she was done talking about this, “Can you let me know when Thor gets back from the docks? I want to know what he finds.”
He placed a hand on Bucky’s arm then, giving it a reassuring squeeze, “Go get some rest.” He ordered softly, “I need everyone at the top of their game for what’s coming.”
Steve’s room was nothing like he had expected. All dark wood and dark cream walls. It was homely. It was private. It was peaceful. It was Steve. There were stacks of books against one wall, having overgrown the small bookcase that was there Steve had resorted to stacking them up like a wall next to it. Tony saw plenty of army books there, some history ones and others on strategy. There were books about vintage cars and surprisingly quite a few murder mystery ones mixed in with the nonfiction. Tony smiled at that, the mob boss reading about fictional murders and trying to work out the culprit before it was revealed. It was so Steve, trying to find the clues in the pages and figure it out before the characters did.
Tony took a small step back, “I need to…” He turned on his heel, more overwhelmed than anything. He needed space and air and he needed to not see Steve’s lost puppy face.
Steve knew what they were doing. They were goading him, challenging him, baiting him. It wasn't going to work; he wasn't playing this game with them.
Tony managed to keep himself upright this time at least, his palm stinging from the heat as he released his fingers from their grip and took in his handy work with the door. A clear path to freedom, out of the smoke and dust in the air. Tony took tentative steps.
“I need you to come back to the company, back where you belong. I know I wasn’t the best father to you, Tony, I know I made mistakes, but this is about blood. This is about legacy.” Howard reasoned and it was the first time in the conversation that Howard seemed to believe what he was saying.
Natasha must have sensed Steve’s change in demeanour because she was ushering Fury to the door shortly after as Steve stood rigid. Fury seemed to sense he was pushing his luck and let her lead him out. Natasha waited until she had shut the door on the detective before turning back to Steve.
Sitwell needed to go for Natasha first because she was fast and her precision to throw a knife was second to none. Thor was a danger up close but Natasha was a danger even in a room full of people with one hand behind her back. Sitwell wouldn’t go for Natasha though because he would underestimate her. Steve had watched so many men make that mistake and realise it was a fatal one.
Steve narrowed his eyes, “Sorry, Pierce can’t come to the phone right now. He’s having trouble finding a hand. This is The Captain and I have one thing to say. Tell Rumlow his days are numbered.”
“I’ll deal with him.” Steve replied, eyes narrowing, “What I don’t want to deal with is the two of you. If you can’t work together anymore you need to tell me now because I won’t put this family at risk for whatever is happening between you two.”
“T’Challa’s re-election campaign. I’m just there to scare some votes for him but it would be a lot less dreadful with you.” Steve replied.
Steve flicked against the tip of Tony’s cock again, and again and again, waiting until Tony gave a sharp cry before sinking back down on his length. He let Tony fill him up, hollowing out his cheeks as he lazily bobbed his head up and down his cock. It was too slow for Tony to cum and it was making him impatient. Steve could feel him shaking against his hands, trying to get his hips up.
“That one’s my favourite.” The voice made him jump and he looked over his shoulder to see Steve awake. Those blue eyes soft as they stared at him.
“Okay Tones. He’s in there. Hands are cuffed so he won’t try anything,” Rhodey told him as they came to a stop outside the door, “Two minutes. You say what you need to say, and you get out. I’ll come get you if you don’t.” It was almost amusing that Rhodey thought Steve might try and hurt Tony, when in reality Tony knew he’d be completely safe. Steve wouldn’t ever attack him, it was a fact, just like he knew Steve drew when he couldn’t sleep, and he always dropped a kiss onto Tony’s skin somewhere after he came. Tony knew in his bones he’d be safe.
Bucky stopped moving to Steve’s left, standing straighter and squaring his shoulders. A few strands of hair had escaped the bun he favoured but Bucky didn’t move to get them out of the way. The meeting had started.
The hands in his hair moved back to his shoulders, Tony slowly moving back and forth to try and gain some friction from the finger Steve was working inside him. The lube made it easier for him to bury the digit into Tony’s hole, moving it in and out for a couple of thrusts to make sure Tony was coated in the lube as well.
Steve couldn’t speak, the fear rising within him. No way Rumlow would have recognised him from his voice and that sentence alone. No way.
Steve held firm, Ross was trying to get to him, and Steve couldn’t afford to rise to it, “Your right eye twitches when you’re intimated, has anyone ever told you that?”
“It makes sense. Both bodies were moved after death. They both had scrap marks on their backs like they were dragged. Probably to stage a crime scene.” Adam continued.
Steve pushed in slowly, inch by inch as Tony stretched around him until he was buried to the hilt inside him. Steve waited there for a moment, Tony’s eyes were closed again and he was taking Steve just the right way and Steve felt him grip the back of his neck.
Steve was right about one thing though; a shower would definitely help. He grabbed his phone from the side, unlocking it to see a message from Peter. Tony let out a small laugh at the picture Peter had sent him. Ned had oil smudged into his fur, happily sitting in Peter’s arms for the photo with a caption:
“We’re all forgetting one very big variable in this plan.” Bucky cut in, “Steve. If we’re right and he set himself up for the fall, then he isn’t exactly going to be happy we’re busting him out.”
Steve knew what she was getting at with the subtle push out the door. She wanted him to go and destress, to come back to them with a clear head and a plan they could work with.
He jogged up the path when he spotted Fury already there, looking out to the sea from the dock with a grim expression. Steve felt the dread curl in his stomach, when he had received Fury’s message about meeting, he knew it couldn’t have been good but the look on Fury’s face just confirmed his suspicions.
Steve’s hands were on his hips now, a glint to his eye that was nothing short of teasing, “I might be in jail soon.” He sighed.
He finished the second device only a few hours ago, using rudimentary theory he’d learnt from watching Howard build explosives for years. He had to find a way to slip it to Steve. The device was a small black box, similar to a kitchen timer with a kill switch. Steve just needed to place it by the lock and stand back. It should be able to fry the electronic locking system without alerting anyone to the fact Steve’s cell was open but from there Steve would be on his own.
He found an old empty envelope on the breakfast island that separated the kitchen from the living room and decided that would have to do. He didn’t want to start opening draws to look for paper, he figured Tony would value his privacy. Steve scribbled his note quickly, realising the longer he stayed the more chance he had of Tony waking up. Was there a part of him that was stalling on purpose? To see what Tony Stark looked like in the mornings.
“You know who’s taking over Hydra.” Steve mused, “Tell me and I’ll make sure when I tell this story, you’ll come out more heroic than you actually were.”
Steve was on him in a second, hands lifted Rumlow’s body up by the jacket before bringing his head back down against the concrete again. He did it again. And again. Rumlow was laughing under him, blood steady blooming from the back of his head. The blood from Steve’s nose dripping onto his jacket.
It had been days and Steve was only just being brought from his cell into an interview room. Ross’ doing no doubt, waiting Steve out. Proving who held the power now. As if Steve could forget after glancing down at the ugly orange ensemble they’d given him when they booked him in at the station and checked him for weapons. They’d taken fingerprints and swab samples of his DNA, told him to change and shoved him in a cell. Fury watched over the entire thing with a guarded expression. Steve tried to avoid his gaze.
“You know when I first recruited them, I thought this was it, my chance to build something better than Phillips did. Something the army couldn’t give me. A real home.” Steve sighed, “I didn’t really plan on The Captain making this much noise.”
He might not be in the best place with Steve right now, but he knew Steve wouldn’t want any harm to come to him. That was the whole reason he allowed himself to be arrested, to protect Tony and the family from harm. That was a whole mess they needed to talk about. His kiss with Steve still burned on his lips and as much as he did it for his plan and to slip Steve the device, Tony couldn’t help but think about it. He’d told Steve how he felt, he laid his feelings out there on the line whilst still being angry at him. Steve hadn’t even said the words back so maybe it changed nothing between them, maybe once they were done with Hydra they’d be done for good.
The guy moved his feet further part, still raising his gun and Steve almost wanted to smile at the effort he was putting in, “Now target. You want it to be a kill shot, Kid because I swear to you, if I’m still breathing after you shoot me, I’ll make sure I live long enough to watch you die first. You want a head shot or a heart shot? Personal preference. Head’s messier, a gun that size? Bullet’s gonna blow a hole the size of a grapefruit out the back of my skull if you do this right.” Steve told him, “Heart shot takes more skill. You need to aim it just right to get it between the ribs. You hit a rib and I’m going keep on coming.”
