“And you're . . . mine. My guy.” Dean's voice, which had hesitated a little on “mine,” grew strong and firm again on “guy.” He kissed the top of Castiel's head. “Love ya, Cas – no matter what happens. Don't ever forget that.”
to put on the masks any more. He wasn't a “wife” or a “daughter” or any kind of female person, and he was tired of pretending to be one. To be honest, he didn't know
began to fall off a couple years later I was a bit disappointed, I guess, though I wasn't really worried. Our lives were busy and besides, I thought I was simply getting over the 'honeymoon stage' and that I'd eventually find my level again, as it were.” He paused, frowning. “But I didn't. Things got worse instead. I began to feel uneasy in my body, as if it didn't fit anymore. I was restless and anxious; I could never get completely comfortable. It got so that I would look in the mirror and not know who or what I was looking at. I felt alien, slow and useless and ugly. For some reason, sex intensified these feelings, so I started to avoid it, unconsciously at first, then consciously. I stopped making the first move; I made excuses; I ignored your hints and suggestions until you just stopped making them.”
that's happened to me, Dean, it's – it's not because of you and, honestly, it's not about you, either, but it
Dean spread his hands. “I dunno. At first, it was so I wouldn't scare you, you know? When I met you it was – it was just

going well, it really is.” He ran a hand across his jaw in unconscious imitation of Dean. “I don't know how to describe it, Charlie, but everything is different now. Not just me, and not just how I see my gender, but
Dean squeezed his eyes shut. His breath seized in his lungs, a hard, painful convulsion in his chest. Another, his mouth gaping and gulping for air his body refused. Once more, and then he could breathe again, and everything was suddenly quiet and still, as if the world were very, very far away.
Dean sighed and sagged a little, leaning into Castiel. Castiel shifted his position, straightening up and leaning back against the couch so Dean could rest his head in the curve between his neck and shoulder. “So what is it?” Dean asked quietly after a moment. “What changed?”
Dean shrugs with one shoulder.  “Or maybe we’ll eventually get somewhere else.” He looks at all the nothing around them. “It’s not like there’s much else to do.”
Dean worked his way around the sofa to look at Castiel full on. He tilted his head as if this would give him a better view, then straightened up again, all the while sporting a goofy, affectionate smile. “Yeah, I do. I mean, I was kinda surprised at first, but you know, now that I see it, I think it looks perfect on you. It's really, I dunno,
corner. We’ll need to stack ‘em high, so be careful, and remember to lift with your knees—these suckers are heavy.” He grimaced. “I remember; I carried ‘em in.”
and I wanted everything to be perfect. It's not like I wanted to lie to you or anything, but you came from this hyper-religious family, so I decided I'd play it by ear, put the whole thing on need-to-know. By the time I found out you'd gotten over the bullshit they'd tried to brainwash you with, I thought, well . . . I guess I thought it just wasn't that important. I mean, I'd never really
Sleep-warm hands reached for him, and Castiel shuddered, wanting the touch so badly he felt like wailing aloud, but also wanting to run and hide, so Dean would not see him crying, not see him so weak, not ask him why.
Benny nodded as he pulled a sandwich and a container of fruit salad out of his little cooler. He raised his eyebrows in question; Castiel nodded minutely, trying not to jog his head too much. Benny sat next to him at the table. “Oughta be,” he said. “He practically raised that boy after their mom died, his pop being…” He broke off, frowning, as if he'd realized he was about to cross some line. “Well, let's just say the old man never really got over her death, huh? So, there was Dean left with little Sammy, and Dean did his goddamn best, and the kid grows up good. Real good. Smart, good heart. Got a full ride to Stanford, even. Damn right Dean's proud.”
Castiel turns to him. “That is what the sound has been saying, all this time. Too slowly to follow, before, but now that it has sped up some, I’ve been able to decipher the words.” He pauses, and his eyes are troubled. “The message is for you. Do you know what it means?”
Castiel peered around him and made a disparaging noise. “Don’t exaggerate, Dean,” he said. “You can see that if we take a sharp turn to the left once we get through the door, we’ll be fine.”
Castiel stared into his now-cold coffee. “I suppose,” he said slowly. “It's just, I want to get him at the right time, but I don't know when that would be. At dinner? Breakfast? When we're washing the car? When we've just finished a movie? And what kind of movie would set the mood? Action-adventure? Comedy? Romance?” He shuddered. “All right, maybe not romance . . .”
He decided he would tell Dean Saturday evening, after dinner. They had no outside plans, so he thought he'd let Dean make ribs (Dean was, frankly, the better cook) and coleslaw, then they'd settle in front of a Babylon 5 marathon with beer and popcorn. Maybe he'd tell Dean before the marathon, or maybe after the first episode; he wasn't sure yet. But sometime that evening, when Dean was full and happy and there was nothing important to think about. That would be best, Castiel thought. It should be easy. And then, if it went well with Dean, they could both tell Sam, Amelia, Bobby, and Ellen at brunch on Sunday. Or not. It didn't matter. Castiel was going to tell Dean on Saturday, and if the world didn't end, everything else could take care of itself.
Castiel glanced back at the man carrying a box full of his pots and pans and trying to look casual about it. “I'm sorry,” Castiel said, not looking directly at those mossy green eyes. He didn't want to fall and break his neck stumbling over himself. “I enjoy being on the top floor.”
Love and exasperation crashed through him, scouring him clean of fear and leaving him feeling expansive and somehow
a question. “A woman's hair is her glory,” was quoted at him often enough that it had ceased to have any meaning outside of “no, you can't get a new hairstyle – just get the ends trimmed.” When he went to college he'd rebelled a tiny bit and and got a layered cut that ended at his shoulder-blades, the shortest it had been since he was a toddler. Even when Castiel had gone through his “butch” phases he'd never dared to go too short, and his current bob – hitting just at the nape of his neck – was as short as he'd ever managed to cut it. Until today.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck, which was turning, along with this face, a little red. “Yeah, well, about that, Cas . . .”
Dean shrugged, looking suddenly and unexpectedly a little abashed. “Well, the cat was dead at the time.”
, and that was enough for him. As he wrote in an e-mail to his relatives, "[w]e've been friends for about 35 years, lovers for over 30, and married for almost 29.  We have history, and it's not like I woke up one morning with a stranger in the same bed." Sure, there were a lot of things to rethink, some negotiations, but in the end
Castiel was fifteen minutes early. He rarely drank at lunch, but today he ordered a beer and took a table near the back, fingers tapping on the wooden tabletop. He'd finished half his drink before he heard Charlie's cheerful “Hola, girlfriend!” drifting across the lunch-crowded room.
Castiel winced on “handmaiden,” though he knew Dean had played that role in the past, sat down hurriedly, and handed Charlie a menu to hide his discomfort. “Lunch or brunch?” he asked.
“There are at least five buses that pass within two blocks of this restaurant,” Castiel said helpfully. “That's how I got here.”
The next little while was taken up by menu-perusing, small talk, and ordering lunch. Once the waiter had walked away, Charlie laced her fingers under her chin, leaned forward on her elbows, and fixed Castiel with a serious look and a raised eyebrow. “Okay, girl, spill,” she commanded. “What's wrong?”
. He kept running his hand nervously through it, and it felt so weird when he ran out of hair so quickly.
“Okay!” Charlie said as she dragged Castiel into a large local department store. “This is the best place to start – they have lots of stuff and it's pretty nice but not too expensive.” She turned and faced Castiel, hands on her hips. “So, the first thing you have to figure out is – what's your look?”
Castiel looks around at the vast white emptiness, his eyes narrowing when he catches sight of the wound in the world. “
, Dean. I have no soul, only grace. No one knows where angels go when they die, if they go anywhere, but they most certainly do
They fumble at first. Dean has little experience with male bodies; Castiel has little experience of any kind at all. But they seem to have all the world and time, and soon (or late) they are kissing as if the only oxygen was to be found in the other’s lungs, touching as if to be separate for even an instant would be fatal.
I happen to know you don't have any food in the house.” His smile turned mischievous, and Castiel couldn't help smiling in return.
“So,” Dean said casually, though his voice was maybe pitched slightly higher than usual, “queer as fuck, huh?”
Dean reaches out and curls his fingers into the front of Castiel’s trench coat. The fabric feels smooth and rough at the same time. He thinks he can feel every thread in the weave. He watches his thumb rub against the rough stitching of a buttonhole. “If we
Sam gapes at them, his expression blank with shock. They all stare at each other for a long, long moment.
When they went to bed, Castiel wound himself around Dean as he hadn't for . . . months, probably. His disgust with his body had made him shy, made him shrink away from any reminder that he was inherently
“Yeeees,” Castiel said slowly, remembering. “He said he'd seen 'a lot of broken heads in his time.'”
He doesn’t think; there is nothing to think about. There is nothing but light and the sound/vibration/music and himself, and he barely registers himself. If he stopped and considered, he might remember his name, his life. Pain, joy, love, hate. But he doesn’t stop, overtaken by the momentum of his body, the ease of movement, the only thing that seems real.
with excitement. He'd already started wearing his man-jeans, but now he dug out his new button-ups and started wearing those as well. He started lowering his voice experimentally (not around Dean, of course), just a little, to see how low he could comfortably go without hurting himself. He bought a messenger bag at Goodwill to replace his purse. He dug the 5-lb. weights out of the downstairs closet and started using them again. He began to research trans issues and support groups on the internet. He defragged and backed up his hard drive. He cleaned all the bathrooms and the refrigerator and still got Professor Armitage's Arabic translation done a day early.
“I'd have to beat the guys off with a stick, maybe some of the girls, too,” Dean said with a grin, pulling himself away from Castiel with obvious reluctance and heading for the driver's side door. “But not tonight, babe. We gotta go hang out at some seedy restaurant with my nerdy little brother and his way-too-good-for-him wife. At least the ankle-biters have a sitter for the night.” Dean rolled his eyes and looked put upon.
Castiel thought, then he noticed that Dean's uniform shirt was missing; he was wearing only a black t-shirt. A
Charlie was staring at him, hands pressed against her mouth, eyes wide and glistening. Castiel started, concerned. He'd been so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he hadn't been paying attention to his friend's reactions. “What's the matter?” he asked worriedly. “Did I say something wrong? Are you all right?”
He attempted to grab Cas around the waist, but Cas beat him to the punch, was on his feet and pulling Dean up beside him with surprising and wiry strength. He threw his arms around Dean's neck and kissed him fiercely, lips and tongue almost desperate in their enthusiasm. It was a question, a plea. When they broke apart, both breathing heavily, Dean looked into those wide blue eyes and smiled. “Yes, Cas. Yes.”
Footsteps behind him. “Who?” Dean began. “Wait –” Castiel clenched his teeth, the butterflies gone riot.
. “You ridiculous man,” he said sternly. Dean's eyebrows jumped, but Castiel didn't give him time to throw up any of his usual defenses and plowed right on. “You can't
?” Amelia interrupted pointedly. She grabbed Castiel's arm. “Come sit by me, Castielle,” she murmured. “You know how the boys can get.”
Dean falls silent, feeling suddenly shy and uncertain. Castiel squeezes his hand again. “Dean thinks she put us there, in that empty, lifeless place, so we would…” He pauses, and Dean’s afraid he’ll say “get our asses in gear,” but Castiel simply smiles softly and says, “so we would be able to…come together without any external distractions.”
Dean pulls Castiel’s lip into his mouth, bites until the blood comes, then licks it clean, gentle and reverent, as if the wound is a sacrament.
Castiel looks away. “I was with Sam. We were entering the bunker, and…and…” He turns back to Dean, brows knit in frustration. “I don’t remember any more. There was a tugging sensation, then, here.”
at his reflection in the mirror in the mornings (clothed, and from the waist up), and it almost felt like the
Castiel watched Benny, too, and that proved almost as interesting as watching Dean. It was obvious that Benny knew Dean well, and it was
The door opened; the three men shuffled inside. “Where d'ya want it?” Dean asked innocently enough, but there was a twitch at one corner of his mouth that made Castiel suspicious. “Bathroom? Bedroom? Kitchen table?”
Dean embraced him tightly, lips in Castiel's hair. “It was just a nightmare, babe,” he murmured. “I'm never gonna leave you, okay? You know that. I'm never gonna leave you, 'cause I love you more than anything.”
Castiel shot him an amused look, complete with eyebrow. “When has either one of us ever been to 'Grandma's house'?”
The air around them hums, then, resonating like a struck gong. Dean feels a momentary qualm, a surge like ice water rushing through him, then the feeling is gone, drowned in the warmth of Castiel’s body, the reassuring sound of his voice humming a tune Dean doesn’t recognize.
The guilt and anxiety that Charlie's effervescent presence had held at bay rushed through him again like a high-speed train, plowing through his happiness and leaving behind a cold, leaden feeling in his stomach. His shoulders slumped as he stared down at his half-finished lunch. “I haven't told him, Charlie,” he said slowly. “I don't know
First, however, he ran upstairs, dumped his purchases on the bed, and stood staring at the colorful pile for a long, long time. Men's clothes. The shoes and hoodies and t-shirt were relatively innocuous; the hoodies were maybe a little long, but nothing about these items necessarily screamed “male-only.” The shirts, on the other hand, were boxy and buttoned up on the
Charlie is Charlie, of course, but her reactions here are an amalgam of the reactions of many of my friends and acquaintances, as well as that of my totally awesome little brother. My realization that I was not a girl began pretty much exactly as I've written for Cas -- one day I just noticed all my clothes looked like
Dean's eyes lit up as Castiel came down the path from the house, shoving himself up from where he'd been leaning on the Impala to take Castiel in his arms. “You look terrific, Cas,” he beamed. “You know how I love a girl in drag.”
Castiel grinned down at the beer mat on the scarred table—an artsy thing for a craft IPA the bar didn’t even sell—and shook his head. “You’re ridiculous,” he said. He looked up again. “Did Sam ever forgive you?”
.” He emitted a cry of triumph as he brought out a small pudding cup. He waved it in front of Benny's face, smirking. “'Sides, I know you always pack
Castiel shook his head. “You're awful.” He ran his hand through his hair. “I think I gravitate towards kind of an understated style. Tidy, you know, but not flashy. But not old or frumpy, either.”
“I remember…Chuck and Amara. Amara said the sun was going away because Chuck was dying, that she would die, too. But they worked it out and fucked off to do a brother-sister vacation or something. Then nothing. Then I was here.” He looks at Castiel, who is regarding him now with an unreadable expression. “What about you?”
He opened the box with his penknife and pulled out his dictionaries and references books and began arranging them on the shelves above the desk. In the background he could hear the movers leaving the kitchen, the clatter of someone going back down the stairs. He shrugged. They knew their job; he could direct them as they moved the boxes into the apartment.
to watch Dean be protective and careful of Benny, as if on instinct, while Benny was obviously just as protective of Dean, but from a place of greater self-awareness. More than once Castiel caught Benny watching him talk to Dean as if he was trying to determine Castiel's motives, his eyes narrowed and his expression almost preternaturally uncommunicative.
Castiel laughed, if a little uncertainly. “Well, I think we can rule out 'jock' and 'redneck' right off the bat,” he said. “Probably soccer-dad, and – what was it? – 'studly stud,' too.”
They lay a long (or short) time on the hard surface of their world, quiet now, the only sound between them their low breaths, the occasional gentle murmur of sounds that are not words but something deeper and more meaningful. The place is chill and bright, but they are warm in each other’s arms, eyes half-closed, just being.
Castiel opened his mouth to take responsibility for his own absent-mindedness, but Benny cut him off. “It's all right, Dean,” he drawled. “You keep apologizin', you're gonna make Mr. Novak uncomfortable. Let it go, brother.”
He stared down at the wine glass in his hands, inexplicably empty now. He reached towards the open bottle, stopped, drew his hand back. “Dean?”
Castiel swallowed. “Gay as a spring lamb,” he replied, trying for the same casual tone, though whatever was rioting in his stomach made him want to scream. “You?”
Dean’s skin is prickling; he feels as though electricity is sluicing over his entire body. “I…I remember now,” he says numbly. “It’s the last thing Amara said to me, before she disappeared with Chuck.”
“You know what you need?” Charlie said cheerfully, as if everything were normal and Castiel hadn't just told her he was trans and she hadn't just been talking about sex toys and “other orifices.”
Mom was dead, too. Most likely. Definitely. Lucifer would never let her live, not after she’d shoved him back through the crack right before it closed, trapping them both in Apocalypse World. He’d have killed her right there. Dean knew it.
Dean laughed again and moved his hand to squeeze Castiel's shoulder. “Yeah, okay – whole lotta baggage with that one. Got it.” Dean pulled away a little then, so he could look down into Castiel's eyes. “You know I'm gonna mess up, babe, right?” he continued slowly. “I'll try to be good, but I know I'll forget sometimes. I mean, I've known you for so long, and, y'know, habit and all . . .” His voice trailed off as he searched Castiel's face, eyes anxious.
“S’not okay,” Dean groaned between eerily silent, wrenching sobs. “Cas’s dead. For real, this time. I
I was, has been incredibly freeing. I feel . . . stronger, more confident and less afraid than I used to be. And yes – I'm happy.”
Not just the transient delight that comes with a pleasant surprise or a passing experience, but general, pervasive, day-to-day contentment.
Dean laughs a little and raises a hand, warding off Sam’s questions. “Yeah, yeah—I’ll tell that story later, when I have a beer in hand, but for now let’s just say that I did Amara a solid, there at the end, and I think what happened to me an’ Cas was her idea of paying me back.”
Castiel scowled and turned over again, bunching the covers up around his ears and wriggling his feet out into the cool night air. He'd run this through his head a hundred times at least, but he was no closer to an answer to his central question than he was when it all began: what the hell? Seriously, how did this happen?
more, so much more. But he was spent now, his head light and drowsy from the wine, and he was so tired of talking and thinking and trying to explain the explainable. But there was one more thing, one question that he couldn't put off, no matter how his heart shied away from it.
“Okay, dude,” Dean said. “The problem is that we don’t have enough room to maneuver; we need to bring the dresser further into the room before we try to turn it, but your bed is in the way.” Castiel opened his mouth, but Dean held up a hand. “
Castiel blew out a long breath. He knew this question had been coming, but he still had no answer. “I don't know,” he admitted at last. “I've been so caught up in just
hair, and it looks good on you, and Dean is going to love it.” She leaned over and patted his knee. “You'll see. It's going to be
Castiel sighed, sliding down Dean's body until his head rested in the hollow of his shoulder. Dean folded him in his arms, and Castiel could feel him smile against the top of his head. “Yes. I would like that, Dean. I would like that very much,” Castiel murmured.
“Whoa!” Dean said with a grin. “Easy there, champ. Guess your melon took more of a knock than we thought, huh?”
The only thing Castiel still couldn't figure out, even with all his watching and observing and questions and encouragement, was whether Dean was
body, and all his people skills leaked out of his brain like melted wax. “Buh?” he said intelligently.
“I – uh,” Castiel stammered, tearing his eyes away from the mover’s broad shoulders, “yes, of course. Dean.” Castiel nodded to each in turn. “Benny.”
Castiel slowly brought his hand away from his head. It felt sticky. Oh, god—he was covered in blood…
Several long seconds went by before Dean seemed able to screw his courage to the sticking place, but eventually he exhaled in a tiny sigh and turned to Castiel, and all the bravado Castiel had seen earlier in the day, all the swagger, teasing, and (maybe) flirting—even that parental concern and carefulness—was gone, replaced by a smile that was strangely hesitant, even shy. “Does that mean,” he said, and his eyes flicked to the floor again before coming back up to meet Castiel’s, “that if I said I’d like to kiss you, you’d maybe say…yes?”
“It's all right, Dean,” Castiel said, smiling. “I know it's not going to happen overnight. And as long as you love me and try your best, it'll be enough. Truly.”
Dean shrugs and buries his face in Castiel’s neck. Castiel smells like sweat and ozone and power. “I don’t know. Nothing. Everything. I was afraid of you being an angel. I was afraid of you being in a male vessel, afraid of what people would think. I was afraid of hurting you, of being hurt by you.” He looks up at Castiel again; Castiel’s eyes are clear and unjudging. “I was afraid to let anyone else in. There was Sammy, but he was always there, and that was enough of a burden, you know?”
Charlie threw up her hands. “You're over-thinking it, dude! I mean, don't show him 'Boys Don't Cry,' for Cthulhu's sake, but you know, some quiet evening when there's no other distraction, sit him down, give him a kiss, . . . and
Castiel, who had been staring at Dean through most his speech like a startled hare, snapped out of his stunned trance and scowled at this last sentence. Oh, for god's sake: only Dean could blame himself for someone else's
He tried to look away now, tried to tell himself that Dean loved him and would never leave him and that they would work it out even if he had no idea how, but for some reason he couldn't make denial work for him this time. He tried to imagine Dean telling him everything was all right, but all he could see was Dean's expression transforming from surprise to disgust to repudiation. He saw Dean turn from him, saw Dean leave the house, saw himself leave, then nothing. No matter how many times he replayed the scene, all he saw was leaving: hard or soft, cruel or regretful. All there was was loss.
Castiel raised a dubious eyebrow. “Oh, no? You mean, you've not had your wife of thirteen years tell you, out of the blue, that she is now your
– strong hands on his hips, twirling him around. Wine splashed, but he held onto to the glass by sheer instinct, his heart beating fast as it tried to to jump into his throat. He looked up, mouth foolishly open, and there was Dean, his face lit by one of his best grins, eyes dancing.
Castiel holds Dean down, one arm pulled up behind his back to keep him still as he pounds into him like the Wrath of God, while Dean howls and blasphemes and begs for more.
Yeah, I know I'm the one of the luckiest SOBs out there, and that it's not always this easy, but sometimes there
life rather than just babbling out his own story every time Dean gave him that encouraging little grin.
he needed to talk to someone. “Lunch would be wonderful, Charlie,” he said, cutting off his friend's excited babbling before it got out of control. Again. “Maybe we could play the rest of the afternoon by ear?”
, y'know? Everything else is just details.” He looked up again. “Is this, whatever it is . . . deciding you're not a girl or whatever . . . is this what's saved you? Is this what's made you happy?”
It was beginning to look like Dean was right: no matter what they did, the dresser did not want to make it around that corner. They tried coming in at an angle, tried coming in straight and pivoting, but the turn was just too tight. They even tried standing the damn thing on its end, but its legs caught in the doorway. It was frustrating—and a bit humiliating, considering how Castiel had teased Dean—but at least he was entertained by Dean’s increasingly colorful and inventive cursing.
Castiel looked up sharply from where he was laying down contact paper in the kitchen cabinets and smacked the back of his head against the lip of the counter. He made an inarticulate noise of pain and fell back on his rear, clutching his head with both hands, eyes tight against the tears starting in them.
It’s soft, tentative. Dean presses back, just as gently, and then they pause, lips barely parted, just breathing into each other’s mouths. The universe seems to stop, and Dean can feel the
Having a deadline seemed to snap something inside Castiel, like breaking a band around his heart that he didn't know was there until it was gone. He felt nervous and jittery, but also free, spacious, and almost
“Oof!” she squeaked, taken off guard. “Um, you, too, Cas.” Suddenly embarrassed, Castiel let go, his face hot.
He lowered his hand to his side, opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling. It was an old house, abandoned. Cracks ran across the white plaster; mold bloomed in billowy shapes where rain had seeped in from a leaky attic. It was a distraction, a way to be awake without images of fire flashing across his vision, a way to not see that shape under the sheet, the still, waxen face briefly revealed and quickly hidden again.
The pale shape in the mirror trembled. Castiel's fists clenched, relaxed. It was not like anything could be done.
Dean does not reach out to take Castiel’s hand. He stands still, very still, in the limitless light and sound. “Cas.” His voice sounds strange in this place. “What are you doing here?” He flicks his eyes away, back. “Where
Dean leans forward and presses his face into Castiel’s neck. “I don’t know.” A thought occurs to him, then, and he laughs against Castiel’s skin. “Maybe she thought we needed some time alone? Like, we were never going to get our asses in gear if we had any distractions?”
building in him again: not lust, not desire—or not simply desire—but something more primal, more essential. It is a question, the feeling of Castiel’s hand on his cheek, Dean’s hand on Castiel’s chest, the rest of their bodies almost but not quite touching.
Castiel paused on the stair and shifted his grip on the dresser. “I apologize,” he panted. “It didn’t seem as heavy when Hannah and I put it in the basement.”
Benny sighed. “Oh, don't bother; I got some blue ice in my lunch cooler. 'Bout time for a break anyhow.” Grumbling, he stumped back down the stairs. “Grab my lunch, too, Benny!” Dean called after him. Castiel heard a faint “Yeah, yeah,” then silence.
“Yeeaah,” Dean said slowly, and his eyes flicked down and back up. “Okay, but—” He stopped, coughed, and fixed his gaze on the bed as if it were suddenly the most interesting thing in the universe. He was strangely still for a moment, then he sucked in a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and stood up straight. He gestured. “We need to get
are what I need most.” Then he wraps Castiel in his arms and kisses him like it’s the only thing left to do, like it’s the only thing that makes sense in the entire world.
caught his foot on a box that had been placed at an angle and stumbled into a different pile, and the top box of that pile shook and teetered, and as they both watched in frozen fascination, it tipped away from them to fall with a loud and satisfying crash on Castiel’s hard oak floors.
Dean turned his head a little, hair brushing across Sam’s chin. His eyes fluttered open, and Sam bit his lip at what he saw there. “I’ll try,” Dean said. “But it’s so hard.” He turned away again. “’M so
After that, everything was different. All morning Castiel had been in a froth of confusion, embarrassment, and—call it what it was—lust, but after interacting with Dean at lunch, and after Benny's small revelations, he felt as if he'd got a bit of a handle on things. A handle on one Dean Winchester, specifically.
Dean put the bottle on the table in front of Castiel, then grabbed the battered paper bag Benny had brought up off the counter. “Nah, don't bother. You can have some of my Coke.” He handed Castiel the can after wiping the top off with his t-shirt and popping the tab. Castiel tried not to stare at the sliver of skin this maneuver revealed, nor at the elastic of the underwear peeking over the waistband of his uniform pants. “It's not real cold, though. Sorry.”
Then Castiel had looked up from the clipboard into humorous, moss-green eyes, set in a beautiful face, atop a absolutely

to smile when he talked to Charlie. “Do you have any plans for Saturday?” he asked, trying to sound casual rather than half out of his mind with nerves.
Castiel looked on, paralyzed, as Dean rifled through the boxes, fanning them like playing cards and chuckling to himself. He didn’t sound disgusted, at least.
Benny barked a short laugh. “I can believe that. Our Dean was a bit of a scrapper in his younger days.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, though he actually doesn’t find the situation frustrating. It’s just a thing he can’t figure out, so he shunts it away and forgets about it.
The door was locked, but that barely slowed him down. One kick and the frame splintered, door blowing inward. Sam was dimly aware of a surprised shout from behind him. “Stay back, Jack,” he barked. “I’ll take care of this.”
Castiel takes a half step back again, turning his body a little away. His hands hang limply at his sides. “It’s possible, I suppose, but—”
Because it’s Castiel, solid and real in this tenuous place. Castiel is with him, here at the end of the world.
They both heard Dean coming back up the stairs at the same moment, and that was the end of the conversation, much to Castiel's dismay. Just when it was getting
Frustration shot through him. He felt as if Dean was just humoring him, trying not to upset the “fragile woman” – because it couldn't possibly be this easy. Could it? “Damn it, Dean, did you even hear what I said?” he demanded. “
He turns to meet Castiel’s gaze, then, and in those blue eyes he sees everything they’ve ever done to each other: sacrifice, betrayal, forgiveness. He sees every smile and frown, feels every blow and embrace, hears every angry word and desperate prayer. Dean breathes in deeply, as if it’s the first breath drawn in a newborn world.
Sunday, as it turned out, was surprisingly easy. Castiel knew where he was now, and he had Dean solidly behind him. Besides, he had no fear of Sam or Amelia; Amelia could be a little prickly sometimes, but his brother- and sister-in-law were both warm, compassionate, open-minded people, and the absolute
Suddenly it is before him. Form coalesces out of darkness, out of light. Eyes look into his, a pale face goes paler still with shock and recognition.
Dean’s eyes brightened. “Man, I like the sound of that. Like, can you put your ankles behind your head? Because that would be awesome. And really hot.”
That surprised a little laugh out of Castiel, but Dean just stared at the floor, one hand rubbing the back of his neck, his expression ambiguous. He seemed to be working himself up to something.
Castiel went red to the tips of his ears. He leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, “I'm wearing a binder.”
was pretty heavy-duty BDSM. Castiel’s stomach released its knot and filled itself with light, fluttering things.
Castiel had been a little more apprehensive about the older couple, but Ellen hugged him as thoroughly as Sam had done and wished him the best and told him to let her know if there was anything she could do, especially if anyone “gave him any shit.” Bobby huffed and rolled his eyes and muttered something about “kids these days,” until Ellen cuffed the back of his head, at which he straightened up and and fixed Castiel with a curmudgeonly scowl and warm eyes and said he was real glad Castiel was happy. Beside him, Dean was beaming like a lighthouse, whether in support of Castiel or out of pride for his amazing family or both, it hardly mattered. Castiel barely ate a thing, overwhelmed as he was, but he went home happy, light in head and heart.
want, you can tell me anything.” She suddenly sat up straight, her eyebrows shooting into her hairline. “Oh! Oh! Will you be changing your name? Have you got one picked out?”
Dean held out his hands. Castiel took them and folded himself onto the couch next to him. “Well, this is . . . good,” Dean said tentatively. He felt a little at sea here – he thought Cas' sex drive had just fallen victim to female middle age. He'd read about that. Somewhere.
In a fit of paranoia, Castiel shoved the button-ups and jeans back in a bag and buried them in the closet, under a pile of bedding they only used in colder weather. The hoodies and sneakers he put away properly. He hesitated over the t-shirt for a moment, then pulled off the shirt he'd worn out and slipped out of his bra. Ducking back in the closet, he grabbed a fairly tight sports bra and put the t-shirt on over it. He blinked at himself in the mirror: the shirt was a bit large, and its size plus the sports bra minimized his not-overly-large breasts pretty well. He smoothed down his ruffled hair (
“Pfft!” Charlie said with a dismissive gesture. “Coming out is hard. You're not a coward for having to do it in tiny little steps. Give yourself some credit!”
“Okay!” Charlie said as she dragged Castiel into a large local department store. “This is the best place to start – they have lots of stuff and it's pretty nice but not too expensive.” She turned and faced Castiel, hands on her hips. “So, the first thing you have to figure out is – what's your look?”
Castiel was kneading Dean's hands, blue eyes fixed on the way his long fingers ran over Dean's palms. “You know, when we were first married, I was so excited – sex was pretty new to me, and it seemed amazing and wonderful that we could use our bodies to make each other feel so good. I loved how you laughed and made jokes and said you loved me and how you just let go of everything when you came, as if nothing existed at that moment but you and me and the ecstasy of our bodies. I loved making you happy that way.”
He felt like he'd been hit up the side of the head with a brick. “What? I – I don't . . . I mean, I don't understand,” Castiel stammered. “What do you mean?”
Dean started out slowly, as if he wanted to memorize the moment, sliding his mouth lightly across Castiel’s, his own barely open—no tongue, just lips pulling and slipping, his breath warm and tasting of beer and tomato sauce. Castiel was content to follow his lead at first, content to feel the texture of his lips, his sandpaper stubble against his own, to smell the mixture of aftershave and sweat on his skin.
Sam’s expression crumbled, just for an instant, then went firm and businesslike. “Let me,” he said, telling, not asking.
included). Dean leaned against him and kissed his cheek and called him the biggest nerd of all, and everyone laughed, and Castiel felt loved, and he forgot, for an evening, that everyone thought he was a girl.
Castiel pushed the money back at Dean. “Dean, I’m paying. You’ve already done enough for me today, and off the clock, too.”
lately, in worrying and wondering and trying to make sense of everything, that I haven't really looked very far ahead. I've started to research things, but this is so . . . big. I was thinking that maybe I should talk to someone.”
“Here ya go, Cas,” Dean said as he entered the room, a small bottle in his hand. “Unpacked any glasses, yet?”
Castiel got home in the late afternoon, chauffeured by Charlie, who absolutely refused to let him haul all his purchases around by bus, though Castiel suspected she just wanted to be there to see how Dean took the haircut. Dean, unfortunately – or fortunately, depending – was still out, so Charlie left Castiel alone after many reassurances of support and congratulations, which Castiel found heartwarming, welcome, and, ultimately, exhausting. It took fifteen minutes to say goodbye, by which time all he wanted to do was collapse, numb his brain with sudoku, and try not to think about the cold spot on the back of his neck where his hair used to be.
I have never been to Kansas, though my mother's family is from there originally, but I do have Google as my slave, so as of publishing, these businesses and bus routes are accurate for Lawrence, KS. I don't know if Rolling Gnome hosts Arkham Horror tournaments, but if it doesn't, it should.
“Dean, I –” He searched his mind for all his opening lines, all his prepared speeches and explanations, but everything had gone white, and he had nothing.
Dean had teased him until Castiel started throwing cat toys at him, at which point Dean laughed and threw up his hands and left, saying he was going to go hang out with Benny, and God have mercy on Charlie's soul. Castiel threw him a parting raspberry, then collapsed on a dining room chair and tried to get his breathing under control.
Castiel is craning to look over Dean’s shoulder without actually loosing his hold. Dean tries to turn his head to look behind him, but it’s useless. Reluctantly, he disentangles himself from Castiel and sits up. “Where?” he asks again.
Castiel blew out a tense breath, turned out the light, and settled back against Dean's body. He ran his hand over Dean's chest, reveling in his warmth, the feel of his skin, the steady thud of his heart. “Thank you,” he said quietly.
and the jeans fit his hips and thighs but were so wide in the waist he needed a belt to keep them from showing a spectacular plumber's crack when he bent over. He bit his lip. He had been so excited when they were shopping, but now that he had the clothes home, he wasn't sure what to do with them. Could he wear them in front of Dean? Would Dean wonder what was going on? Would he ask questions Castiel wasn't ready to answer yet? Dammit, what had he been
They eventually pause, and Dean sees Castiel’s smile of wonder change to a troubled frown. “But what is that?” His head gestures behind Dean, at the wound in the air.
“Cas!” Charlie stood up and waved from across the coffee shop. Castiel waved back and made his way towards her and was immediately enveloped in a bear hug. His coffee sloshed dangerously, but he managed to keep it all in the cup.
Castiel hesitates, then shakes his head. “This is like no Heaven I’ve ever seen—so formless and bare.” He looks at Dean. “
Castiel shut his eyes against the darkness and returned the kiss briefly, dryly. “Good night, love,” he whispered. “Sleep well.” They lay quietly for a short while, face to face, Dean's hand on Castiel's hip, Castiel's on Dean's arm, until Dean yawned and rolled onto his back, and Castiel rolled onto his other side and it was time to sleep.
He looked down at his hands and considered, and as he considered, he began to smile, a broad, natural,
“Bullshit,” Dean said calmly. “'Course I can.” He turned and started rooting through Benny's lunch cooler.
Castiel's brain went blank. He had been expecting – well, dreading, really – any number of responses, but this was
The mover looked mildly impressed. “Cool,” Dean said. “Like, I dunno, Spanish and French and stuff?”
Castiel shook his head. “Oh, no, Charlie. I couldn't allow that. Besides, I don't think I need anything else right now – this ought to be a good enough start.”
If Dean noticed any changes in his “wife,” he didn't say anything. He commented on one of Castiel's new shirts (“Hey, I like that one, babe – brings out your eyes.”), but otherwise everything seemed to coast along as usual, so Castiel stopped tensing up around him and just relaxed into his new self as much as his nervous energy would allow.
. The desultory creaks and groans meant nothing in an old building like this, but was that water running upstairs? Again? It was too loud for the sink this time, the pitch too low.
“It’s mostly books,” Castiel said, trying not to sound defensive, “but the living room was getting crowded.”
“Right. I'll get it.” Dean gave ice pack duty over to Castiel then hared off down the stairs; it sounded like he was taking them two at a time.
Dean kissed Castiel's shoulder. “You always look gorgeous, no matter what you wear,” he murmured into Castiel's hair.
Dean jumped off the corner of the desk, brushed non-existent dust off the back of his jeans. “Sounds like a pretty awesome job, man,” he said easily. “Get to be your own boss, save your knees and back.” He laughed, just a short chuckle, then turned and looked Castiel in the eye. He still wore his half-snarky little grin, but there was something…else in his eyes. “Still, a little lonely, maybe. Get out much? Hobbies? Clubs?”
of the water. He’d always come back, though, raised by someone or something way above Dean’s paygrade: Chuck, Naomi, Gadreel. No matter what, no matter who, he’d always come back to them. Back to Dean.
from when he’d burned himself, and they felt better in the cool, still water in the sink, so he stood there, at little stooped over, staring at the wobbly image of his hands and their burns and the cut across the back of his right from where an errant branch had scraped him. He watched idly as the cut bled into the water, a thin, red ribbon billowing and curling out in filmy, insubstantial clouds. They twisted and curled, but he couldn’t see any shapes in them, not like when he and
Castiel felt his face go hot. He still had one hand pressing Dean's shirt to the back of his head, but as he'd stumbled, he'd grabbed onto one of Dean's biceps with the other. A smooth, solid, well-shaped bicep. Dean had both hands on Castiel's shoulders, not a tight grip, but firm and steadying. They were practically nose to nose; this close, and Castiel could see the pale freckles scattered across Dean's cheeks, could see the flecks of gold and darker green in his eyes. He knew he should pull away, but he didn't seem to be able to move. He saw Dean's expression slip into something softer—concern, maybe, but also a bit of hesitancy. “Um, Cas? You okay?” he asked quietly.
Castiel shrugged. “Well, I've always worked to avoid situations that made me anxious, so I'm not surprised you didn't notice,” he said. He stared down at his hands. “I'm afraid of a lot of things, actually. Crowds, yes, but I'm also afraid of meeting new people, of forgetting things, of change – even if it's just moving the furniture or trying new food. I'm afraid of making mistakes, of trying something new, of being too far from home or being out in public alone. So many things.” He raised his head then to look at Charlie, whose eyes had gone round with sympathy, and a slow, somewhat perplexed smile spread across his face. “But I'm kind of
boxes out of the way so we can push the bed against the wall,” he said, all business now. “If we do that, I think we can get the dresser in.” He turned to Castiel, eyebrows raised. “Sound good?”
. It was ugly and unfair, and Castiel hated it. Tears begin to well, stinging, but Castiel blinked them back, refusing to let them fall.
Dean's eyes fluttered open, and his expression was open and artless. “I dunno,” he said. “What do you want me to say? 'Yes you are'? I mean, you'd know better than me, wouldn't you?”
Dean took in a shaky breath, trying to wrench his mind back from distress at Cas' pain to the promise of those fingers, but it didn't seem to matter, because his dick was way ahead of him. “I can do that,” he managed, a sloppy grin tugging at his mouth.
And all at once he was awake again, a blade of anxiety cutting a bloody swathe through his lazy thoughts. God. Dean. Dean, who thought he married a woman, who was so straight it was sometimes painful . . . how could Castiel tell him his wife was really his – what? – his husband? How did that even work? And what would Dean do with the information? Turn gay? Write a book? Join PFLAG? Go into therapy to learn how to deal with it?
have been the best kiss I’ve had in the last, oh, three or four years, but I’m not sure.” He broke into a slow, sly smile. “I think I’ll need more examples for comparison.”
Damn. He'd have to talk now. “Uh, in here, Dean,” he called back. He kept his head bent over his sudoku game.
Castiel went around and around in his head like this for the rest of the week. He had some work, so that at least was distraction for a while, but it wasn't enough to fill every minute of every day. In his free time he tried to keep himself from brooding by cleaning the house or weeding the garden or watching TV, but the anxiety still snuck up on him sometimes, sending a jolt of nausea through him as he was scrubbing the toilet or rooting out bindweed.
Castiel stops too, not in sync this time, but two steps out of step. He turns and gazes at Dean. “What can we do? And what will it accomplish?”
“Remember—” Dean coughs, tries again. “Remember when we were talking, and you said you had what you needed most?”
Castiel smiled and allowed himself to relax a little. Getting Dean to admit even this much was something of a victory. “I think that's an excellent idea,” he said firmly. He stirred, suddenly inspired, and propped himself up on one elbow to look Dean in the eye. “How about we make that our homework for the week? Look into therapists or support groups or, I don't know, subreddits, even, to help us sort out how we feel about what's happening.” Dean sucked in a breath, and Castiel went on quickly, not giving him time to protest. “Not saying we have to have appointments lined up by Friday or that we have to go stand in front of a group of strangers and talk about our feelings, but just – let's see what's out there, okay? If we need the help, either together or separately.” He bit his lip. “Is that all right?”
“Hey, no prob,” Dean said as he opened the bottle of ibuprofen and shook out two tablets. “Kinda my fault, anyway, scarin' you like that.” He smiled ruefully. “Seems to be my thing today, sorry.”
On the one hand, the two movers did actually get to work, falling into a steady rhythm that meant they interrupted him only when a box was ambiguously labeled or when they needed to consult him about furniture placement, leaving Castiel to clean and unpack in peace. On the other hand, whenever they
“And he doesn’t mean that, y’know, metaphorically.” Dean clears his throat. “We thought maybe we were dead, that maybe we were in Heaven. Or Hell.”
Castiel tensed, then forced himself to relax. Smile. “We need to go a formal event, then,” he said, trying for playful and mostly succeeding. “I could wear a tux.”
Several seconds passed. Dean's expression was very . . . strange. Castiel's fear began to bleed into confusion. “Dean?” he ventured, almost unable to hope.
Charlie barely seemed to notice the interruption. “No prob, Cas,” she said, and Castiel could almost see Charlie's sunny grin. “Where d'ya want to meet and when?”
Castiel blinked back. “Um, yes, really. I discovered, about a month ago, that I am not actually a woman, but a man.”
irritating dudebro at work who thought he was all that and that I needed to partake in the glory that was him and be grateful.” She grimaced.
arms, not vice-versa. He drew himself up to his full height, put one hand on Dean's shoulder and the other around his waist, and whirled him around like he knew what he was doing, and Dean gasped and laughed and clung on as if he was afraid of falling. When they came out of the spin, panting a little, Castiel looked Dean in the eye, hard, direct, not hiding anything, and kissed his mouth like a man kisses another man, equal to equal, strength to strength, and damned if he didn't feel his (purely conceptual) cock twitch when he heard Dean make a small, surprised noise deep in his chest and felt him go a little hard against his hip.
When they drew apart, Dean stroked Castiel’s cheek and smiled a smile unlike any of his previous ones: something soft, neither brash this time, nor uncertain. “Welcome to Lawrence, Castiel Novak,” he said. “I hope you’ll like it here.”
Castiel strokes Dean’s hair, kisses his forehead, his cheeks, his eyelids. “Shh,” he says gently. “It’s all right. Everything is all right now.”
Dean finds himself smiling back. It feels strange, but good. “Yeah. Kinda the same here, except I was walking.”
Castiel, who had been smiling absently out the window, started, feeling a little twinge of unease in his stomach. “Have I been in a bad mood lately?” he asked, trying to sound merely curious rather than anxious.
me, remember? Sickness, health, all that jazz? 'Fraid you're stuck with me: man, woman, Vulcan, whatever.”
Dean took one hand away from Castiel's waist to look at his watch. “Shit, yeah,” he muttered “And I still have to grab Sam's present and feed the cats.” He kissed Castiel's temple. “Hurry up, babe. I'll meet you by the car.”
Castiel tried not to think of the future too hard, tried not to make too much of the quiet sincerity in those green eyes, but he smiled in return. “Thank you, Dean. I think will.”
Castiel blinked once, slowly. “No,” he said. “No, of course not. Don't be silly. I was just . . . thinking.”
. Suddenly everything is rushing and moving, and he feels things, things he had forgotten in this void of light, things that stand in sharp relief against the nothingness, sharp and aching. He takes a deeper breath, something coming unmoored inside him, and he says the words he should have said years and worlds ago.
hand I feel like I'm starting over. I don't know how or why this works, but I'm happy, Charlie. Even with the body dysphoria and worrying about Dean, I'm
“Most of the time,” Castiel replied, wondering how the hell he got into this conversation with this particular person. “Sometimes I have to travel to consult with a client if the source material is so fragile or damaged that it's difficult to photograph, but mostly people just send me scans or photos by e-mail. I’ll be going into the University some days.”
There was a brief silence as Charlie apparently went through her mental planner. “Gee, um, I have a Skype date Saturday morning – a friend in England. In the afternoon I was thinking of dropping by Uni to look for a new router, though they probably don't have anything powerful enough, you know, they never do; I'll probably have to order something online. Oh, and there's an Arkham Horror tournament over at Rolling Gnome, but I'd only go for a drop-in game, I'm not signed up or anything.” She paused, breathless. “Why? D'you have a better idea?”
. So okay, so you're a bit of a late bloomer, but still, congratulations for figuring it out! Better late than never and all that.”
Benny nodded. “Sure can. Like a stuck pig, sometimes.” He smiled a little. “Well, if Dean says it's not too bad, you're probably safe.”
It was a good night. Bobby and Ellen arrived shortly after the group was settled, swelling the party's ranks. Castiel loved his brother- and sister-in-law, as well as the grumpy Bobby and unsinkable Ellen, and it always made his heart warm to see Dean and Sam interact when they were both in good moods. There was excellent food, a lot of laughter, and even some intelligent conversation. Dean didn't drink too much and Castiel did, a little bit, but it didn't matter because he was feeling good. Surrounded by the people he loved, he felt expansive and relaxed, overcoming his usual shyness to partake in all the jokes and witticisms, at ease enough that he didn't even feel embarrassed when Sam and Dean's more esoteric pop-culture references sailed right over his head. He glowed at the look of pleased surprise on Sam's face when he opened the gift bag and took out the complete set of
Dean falls silent for a while. His thoughts seem to be moving slowly, but at least they are moving. “What do you think it is?” he says eventually. “I thought at first it was music, but I dunno—sometimes I think there are words, but sometimes it just sounds like nothing.”
Castiel was startled out of his reverie by Dean's voice and a warm hand on his leg. “Wake up, babe,” Dean was saying, a small smile on his face. “We're at Grandma's house.”
Something changes. It’s so gradual he almost doesn’t notice, as he no longer notices the sound, almost doesn’t notice the light anymore. Just a shadow, perhaps. In the corner of his eye, something not so bright. The sound that surrounds and fills him changes, too, when he notices the difference, becomes clearer, as if it’s leaning towards meaning, if only for a bare moment. The shadow flickers in and out of the edge of his awareness, disappearing when his focus shifts to the movement of his body, trembling into being when he loses that focus.
Dean was on his knees, gathering the DVDs in. “Hey, you got The Lord of the Rings extended version?” He lifted a box, peered at it, and his face broke into a wide grin. “Oho!” he said gleefully. “I’ll bet there’s some
things again, things I want to share with you.” He took in a quick, sharp breath and squeezed Dean's hands. “Oh, I was so scared when I told you everything – I was afraid you wouldn't want me anymore, just as I was coming back to life. But it didn't matter, and you love me, and everything's okay.
Castiel rocks gently in Dean’s lap, riding up and down in a slow, lazy rhythm, his hands spread across Dean’s shoulder blades like wings. Dean closes his eyes and sings “Hey Jude” into Castiel’s open mouth.
“How're you doing, Cas?” Charlie asked as they exited the store, Castiel battling a serious case of buyer's remorse mingled with mild gender-identity panic.
for you before you go home,” Charlie said with a frankly alarming twinkle in her eye. “And it's on me, so you can't squirm out of it.”
They went to bed early again, though they didn't turn immediately to sleep, instead lying on their backs, Castiel's head pillowed in the hollow of Dean's shoulder. “So what are you going to do now, babe?” Dean asked after a several minutes of warm, comfortable silence.
, somehow. I started wearing only my most androgynous clothes – unshaped button-ups, unisex t-shirts, and the like. I wore whatever of Dean's wasn't too huge, got myself some Doc Marten's. And then, one day or another, I was looking at myself in the mirror, and I realized that it wasn't so much that I felt
“Okay,” Dean panted, laying his head on arms folded across the top of the dresser. “We need a plan B.”
Benny looked after him for a moment, his expression unreadable, then turned back to Castiel. “You okay, Mr. Novak?” he asked. “Need a doctor?”
“Oh.” Charlie cleared her throat. “Oh, well, yeah, that might be a little hitch.” She fell silent, frowning in concentration, then her expression cleared. “But even that's not necessarily a deal-breaker. I mean, even if you do the Full Monty, you know, all the surgery and all the hormones, it won't change, y'know,
Dean grinned wider. “I can do that,” he purred, and pressed Castiel back, deeper into the bedroom, back against the bed, down, down onto the mattress, warm and strong and hard, and it didn’t take very long for Castiel to verify the proof of his hypothesis, though he was happy to collect as many samples as he could.
cut, by god. Nothing too scary, just a normal, side-part thing that was a bit longer on the top than the sides, artfully disheveled with a little styling mousse, but as he walked along the street and the afternoon breeze hit his neck, he felt practically
“We could stay here,” Castiel says eventually. “There is no pain, no monsters. No Mark, no Darkness. Just you and I.”
it isn't – there are plenty of ways you two could play that shouldn't upset his fragile manhood.” Castiel peeped between his fingers to see Charlie's encouraging smile turn sly. “Besides, I don't think Dean is as, um,
Dean's expression relaxed, and he moved in to press a kiss to Castiel's temple. “Yeah, well, my best ain't always that great, so you remind me when I screw up, okay? I mean it. I wanna make you . . .” He stopped himself, smiled wryly and tried again. “I wanna make it easy for you, babe. So you talk to me, correct me, educate me – anything you need, you let me know.”
streak, if ya know what I mean. Standin' up for a girl's honor, protectin' the little guy, that kind of thing. Made him well-acquainted with busted heads.” He looked back towards the apartment door, a small, fond smile on his face. “And a' course he has that baby brother—Sam was kind of a runt when he was little, see, 'fore he turned into a moose, and he was always gettin' picked on. And Dean was always right there, givin' the bullies what-for.”
Dean seemed noticed the change and began to bloom in Castiel's new light. He smiled and laughed and teased more, and Castiel smiled and laughed with him, though he was perplexed at first at the change, in Dean as well as in himself. Then one night, when they'd gone to a party – a
Castiel stares into the void. His left hand is twitching slightly. Dean watches it. “No, it’s gone.” Castiel’s voice is heavy. “Maybe it was never there.”
Castiel gets slowly to his feet. “Yes!” he says. His body is taut, like a greyhound straining at its lead. “Damn, it’s moved. No…there! There!” He starts to run.
Charlie looked wistful. “Yeah, that was a good one, wasn't it?” She shook her head and waved a dismissive hand. “Okay, okay, I care, but I'm
Castiel sighed. Charlie was right, and he knew it, but this was one fear that hadn't miraculously melted over the past few weeks: the fear of looking into Dean's eyes and seeing – no, not hate, not even disgust, but
Castiel settled for something easy and comfortable: jeans, a tailored white button-down with blue and green pinstripes, and Doc Martens. At the last minute he also threw on a dark grey vest, just to dress things up a little. There. Mostly casual, as befitted a family outing, a touch of formality for a birthday party. No frills required.
Dean leaned back slightly, pausing as if weighing his next words carefully. “I mean, you've been different lately. Like something's changed.” He frowned. “Or like you learned something that changed
Sam’s eyes stung. Cas was dead. Really dead this time, burned to ash and grease on a hunter’s pyre, and Dean was upstairs pretending he was going to
To his shock, the very thought of trying to go back made him feel physically ill, his stomach roiling and his heart tightening in his chest. He set his teeth. No, he couldn't do that, not any more, not after knowing what it meant to be his true self. Turning back now, he feared, would kill him even more surely than Dean's theoretical abandonment.
He sprints after Castiel’s fleeing form, dwindled to almost nothing in the few short seconds of lead, but, bandy-legged through he is, Dean is
Sam’s brow furrowed, but he stayed mercifully silent as he tied off the bandage and repacked the kit. Dean sat motionless, hands loose in his lap, gaze fixed on a random spot on the floor.
and finished the day with a little Borderlands co-op, Castiel pulling further ahead in their on-going “who can score the most head-shots” competition. He went to bed with the threat of another butterfly invasion, but fell asleep before a quorum could be reached.
Castiel’s hand covers Dean’s, warm and dry. “Yes.” His voice is impossibly low, full of portents. “Yes.”
Castiel raised an eyebrow, almost pathetically pleased that he hadn't blushed. “Kitchen, please. Anywhere out of the way.” The two movers grunted their assent and trudged off to the right. Castiel took his box into the living room and deposited it on the built-in desk. His laptop, of course, he hadn't packed, but this box had all his work in it, so he'd brought it in the car, not daring to trust it to the moving company, no matter how well-insured they were or how…
Now that Castiel had found his feet and his focus, the day that had threatened to be interminable sped by too quickly, and by three the last box was stacked out of the way in the corner, the last bookcase pushed up against the living room wall. Benny was getting Castiel's signature on the final piece of the paperwork, Dean was shutting up the truck, and then they'd be gone.
Charlie's expression froze, then slowly sobered. “Oh, right. Um, if I'm the first person you've told, then . . . what about Dean?”
There was movement in his peripheral vision: Dean moving slowly and cautiously into Castiel's space. “Hey Cas, you okay?” he asked gently. “Your head's not bothering you again, is it?”
Castiel looks at him, his eyes widening in surprise, as if he had forgotten what speech was and is shocked by its sudden intrusion into their silence.
Castiel wasn't convinced, but he didn't feel like arguing about it, so he just shrugged and said something non-committal and returned to his lunch.
Dean came around the hood of the Impala and grabbed Castiel's hand. “Ouch. You're a hard, unforgiving woman, Cas,” he complained.
.” He dropped his hand and leaned back a little, eyebrow cocked and mouth twitching with a small smirk. “Thirteen years ago you said you'd
“I don't wear the binder at home,” Castiel confessed, “only when I'm out. Alone. Where I'm not likely to run into anyone I know.” He sighed. “I know it's cowardly of me . . .”
Castiel looked down at the table. “No,” he said. “I mean, not you, specifically, just . . . you're the first person I've told, and it
Castiel stares at him for a moment, then breaks into a smile like the sun coming out from behind a cloud. It is so beautiful Dean doesn’t know if he can bear it.
, and the fear clogging his throat begins to dissipate when he sees he’s catching up. He barely registers that they both seem to be wearing all their clothes again.
Castiel threw his arms around Dean's neck, almost giddy with relief. “I'm so glad you like it, Dean,” he said. “I was afraid it was too short. Too sudden.”
Dean breathes out a short laugh. “You said it, Cas.” He lowers his arm from around Castiel’s shoulders and takes his hand. “Let’s blow this popsicle stand.”
Such intense scrutiny could have been unnerving, but Castiel found it instead strangely reassuring to know that Dean inspired such intense loyalty. Sometime mid-afternoon, however, Benny apparently decided that Castiel was no threat and stopped hovering. Castiel felt absurdly pleased by his tacit approval.
The prospect of being able to talk to Charlie on the weekend shifted a bit of the weight off Castiel's mind, and the memory of his breakdown the night before softened, becoming less painful and humiliating and more quietly sad, and as he went about his day, even the sadness faded, leaving him feeling merely wistful and a little guilty about worrying Dean.
Castiel sighed and buried his face in his hands. This was not going as planned. He had wanted to be brave and forthright and calm. In control. Instead, he was practically semaphoring his nervousness to the entire room. Damn, if he couldn't even tell
a nerd.” “I think Robert Downey, Jr. is a very good actor.” “Keep telling yourself that.” “Besides, he is, I think the term is, 'smoking hot.'” “Castiel!”), some Chuck Taylors, and a couple of hoodies. He balked at men's underwear, though he was really,
Castiel rolled his eyes in return, but his smile widened, finally reaching his eyes. “Don't be difficult, Dean,” he said as he took his place in the passenger's seat. “You love this restaurant almost as much as you love Sam and his family.”
Castiel takes in a sharp breath, but Dean stumbles on. “And I couldn’t—I couldn’t do it. So I tried to hold you off. I was a dick to you. I made fun of you or got mad at you when I shouldn’t have. I held you to impossible standards. I wouldn’t forgive you.” His voice cracks. “’Cause, ’cause…I knew that if I let you in, and you left me, like every other damn thing I ever loved, I’d just break, that’s all.”
for months, but the first thing I really remember is looking in my closet and all my clothes looking like . . .
He turns. The shadow is there, wavering like a dark flame. He walks towards it, half-expecting it to flee him, like a rainbow chased across an open field, but it does not. It happens slowly, but the shape does grow larger, accreting mass and form: tall, slim, solid. Human-shaped.
Castiel hadn't exactly known what to expect when the moving van showed up in front of his building, but Dean Winchester (
A small sound, and Castiel started. There was movement in the mirror. Castiel's gaze shifted to the background of the reflection.
“But you don't know what it means, Dean,” Castiel persisted, caught between gratitude, joy, and the agony of the unknown. “You don't know what I am, what I'll become.”
Dean turned back at the door to the hall with a wink and a half-smile. “That's my girl,” he said, and was gone.
Charlie waved a nonchalant hand in the air. “A binder. You know, to squash your boobs down,” she said as if she were talking about wearing a hat on a rainy day. “You're lucky, you know, not being too big, um,
Sam’s movements slowed as he wrapped gauze around Dean’s hand. When he spoke, his voice was low and careful. “You know, Dean —” he began.
They don’t have to eat here, or drink or piss or shit. They do not sleep or rest, hardly pause for breath before they find each other again, hands and mouths devouring each other. There is no hunger but the hunger of their desire, no pain but what they inflict on each other, accidentally or not.
He slows a little, emotion beginning to stir in the blankness of this thoughts. He feels his hands begin to shake, his breath to quicken.
Dean had laughed, feeling it all the way down in his gut. “Whatever, dude,” he said, grinning over the lip of his beer bottle. He squinted at the sky. “Not sure what a trireme is, but I think I see a Viking ship, maybe?”
“You still haven't answered my question,” Castiel pointed out sternly, poking a finger into Dean's chest. “What do you
He starts walking again; Castiel falls into step beside him. Castiel seems a little closer this time, close enough that Dean could reach out and touch his hand, if there were any reason to do so.
Castiel let out a long breath, confusion mixed with wonder. “I don't know why this is happening. I don't know why realizing my true gender changed all these other things; it doesn't make sense. I mean, one the one hand, yes, everything is new and different, but on the other hand I feel like the same person, but on the
Castiel was done. There would be more, of course – ideas and explanations and plans and discoveries – but for now he was exhausted, emptied and relieved, and all he wanted to do was maybe watch something emotionally undemanding and go to bed. Dean seemed pretty calm, considering, though that might have been a mask to protect Castiel – wouldn't be the first time, god knew. Still, it seemed as if it was time for both of them to put thinking aside for the moment, even if that meant there was no immediate closure.
Dean had obviously heard the waver in Castiel's voice; his own in reply was soft, careful. “Yeah, babe?”
“I know, I know,” Castiel hiccuped, feeling useless and helpless and raw. “I love you, too, Dean, so much. I just . . . I know it was just a dream, but it felt so real. I'm sorry. I'm sorry . . .”
“Cas? Castiel?” Charlie asked, waving a hand in front of his face. “You okay? You're not going into a fugue or something, are you? Do I need to call 911?”
They ate in silence for a little while, Castiel hunched forward a little, completely absorbed in his plate. After a bit, however, he began to get twitchy, and, looking up under his lashes, he saw that Charlie was regarding him with a calculating look, head tipped a little to one side.
They fall into each other, and they fall out of time and space, and they fall down to the hard, white ground, breathless and aching and so full of joy that it feels like grief. It feels like the opposite of dying.
like one,” Charlie insisted. “Still . . . “ She put her finger on her chin and regarded Castiel as if he were a particularly interesting species of insect. “So that leaves us with what? Nerd, smart, hip, and edgy. You could also add 'fashion wank' and 'college professor,' the last one in either 'absent-minded' or 'hide your daughters' flavor.”
face, and suddenly his heart is so full he’s not sure what to do with it. He places his hands on Castiel’s cheeks, and he smiles. “You, dammit.
douchebag, that guy. Anyway, it's scary in there and I haven't gotten very far, but I'm gonna have some fun, I can tell.” She grinned, then propped her chin on her hands and gave Castiel a bird-like head-tilt. “So, how 'bout you, Cas? How ya holding up?”
Dean grinned again, obviously delighted, and Castiel's stomach did a little flip. “Not at all. It's great,” he enthused. “I like seeing you like this.”
Castiel shrugs. “I don’t know. I don’t know what happened to us, why we two are here, why Sam is not. We could be anywhere.” He frowns. “Well, except Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory, of course.”
was the elder by three or four years. “Lemme look. I've seen plenty of broken heads before—I know what to do.”
Sam hesitated, then laid his hand on Dean’s shoulder, and Dean felt as if the weight of it would crush him to the ground. Then the weight was gone, and Sammy was, too.
Dean released him and sat down on the couch, pulling Castiel down beside him. “Shopping? What d'ya get?”
“That kissing you would be awesome,” Dean said. He pulled back a bit more, sliding his hands down Castiel’s biceps; he was grinning like a Cheshire cat, the smug bastard.
“Then there was a flash, and a split second of disorientation, and I was here,” Castiel continues. “I was lost. I think for a long time that I just stood still, my mind a blank. Then I began seeing a shape, in the distance. If I turned to look at it, it disappeared, but it always came back.” He turns his head then, and there is a small smile on his face. “Then I saw you. You were a shape, a shadow, then you were
Castiel paused, trembling a little, searching Dean's face for reaction, waiting for the rejection, the turning away, the goodbye.
Sam looks puzzled. “Yeah,” Dean says. “It was weird. There was nothing there, man. Just this white light and this weird sound. You couldn’t even see what you were walking on.”
He knew running water would be better for the cut across the back of his right hand, but he had burns, too, burns from when they
happy you must have been before, and I gotta wonder how I missed it, y'know?” He looked up again, face earnest, almost pleading. “Keepin' you happy, babe – that's my
Castiel swallowed; was the man flirting with him? He couldn't tell, and he found that a bit disorienting. “I just moved here,” he said somewhat helplessly. “I haven't assessed the possibilities for socializing as yet.”
over there, and those baby blues are big as cartwheels. I mean, seriously, you look terrified.” She leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms. “Now, you called Aunt Charlie here for a reason, and I'm guessing it has something to do with that deer-in-the-headlights look, right? So
he was at this point, but he did know this: that he wanted to be the one who made Dean grin like a kid with all the Halloween candy, the one who danced in the middle of the living room with a wine glass in his hand, the one who was strong and happy and didn't give a shit what other people thought.
He had more than an hour of blessed peace in which to stew and worry before he heard the Impala pull into the drive. His stomach went into advanced butterfly mode, but he didn't get up from the sofa, his eyes glued stubbornly to his tablet. He had his back to the front hall; Dean would come into the living room and see the haircut before Castiel could see him. He knew he was being a coward, but he just couldn't bear to look into Dean's eyes at the moment of revelation.
Dean was gazing at him with a crease between his eyebrows, though his mouth was relaxed and smiling. He seemed caught for a second, just staring, and Castiel felt a blush begin to creep up his neck. Just before the moment got too awkward, Dean shook himself and took a long pull on his beer. “Eventually,” he said with studied nonchalance. “I mean, it’s not like
“Shit!” a voice said, then there was a warm hand pressing against his own, trying to pry his fingers away. “Hey, buddy, lemme see that.” Dean's voice.
Castiel actually laughed at that. It was a small sound, but genuine. “An experiment for another time, perhaps. But you said we were running late . . .?”
Castiel stared down at the receipt in his hand, feeling suddenly lonely and small. For a few hours he'd been able to forget that he'd moved away from his family and (admittedly few) friends, away from the bustle and energy of Chicago to come to
Castiel sits up as well and points behind Dean and to the left. Dean twists his body to follow the gesture. “It was there,” Castiel says. “But it’s gone now.” His voice is heavy with disappointment.
There were only three of those, if I remember. Oh my god—you have all three?” He looked up and winked. “You
He wondered, in a kind of dazed bemusement, if all these changes meant that the Situation was real, not a dream or a phase. He wondered why that thought didn't worry him more.
. I don't panic any more when my bus is late and I can't get home before Dean. I don't worry that people are going to laugh at me if I don't get a joke or forget someone's name. Last week, Dean and I went to a party where I knew only a few people, and I talked with
He felt Dean stiffen, then relax and take a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Oh,” he said. “Okay.”
Castiel squinted up at him. “I think I'm all right,” he muttered, but he took the proffered hand anyway. Dean tugged, and Castiel pushed with his legs, and he was upright. Briefly. A wave of pain and vertigo swept over him and he stumbled. Right into Dean's arms.
him die, seen him fall, too many times: exploded, stabbed, slipping out of Dean’s grip. Disappearing slowly into the reservoir like a Christ who’d forgotten how to walk on
He was still smiling into Dean's eyes when Dean's expression shifted, became more serious. Castiel felt his stomach clench up a little as Dean took his hands in his, his green eyes looking deep into Castiel's as if they were diving in with no thoughts of resurfacing. “So,” he said, “what's up, Cas?”
A queasy feeling rolled through Castiel's stomach as blue eyes meet blue in the soft light of the bedroom. It was wrong, this body: weird, flabby bits; bulges and curves all misplaced; one part out of proportion with another – it was all just
Dean takes his hand away. It’s warm. He hadn’t thought of it before, but it is chilly here—the light is bright, but cold. But now his hand is warm. He frowns and shoves both hands into his pockets.
Castiel starts forward, one arm outstretched, and there’s something in his face Dean isn’t sure how to read, something he doesn’t dare put a name to. “Dean.” Castiel sounds breathless, as if he has been running for miles. “You’re alive.” When Dean doesn’t move, Castiel stops, hand still extended, fingers flexed. “Dean?” Hesitant this time.
“Cassie, love,” Dean coaxed, rubbing Castiel's shoulders, pressing his lips to the back of Castiel's neck. “Wake up, babe. Why are you crying? Did you have a bad dream?”
you and will continue to do so, perhaps more deeply than you can guess right now. And because I want
Dean fucks Castiel’s mouth until tears pour down, and after he spills down his throat, Dean stoops and cradles his face, kissing him and tasting the metal and salt of his own come on Castiel’s tongue. Castiel sobs in gratitude, and Dean whispers praise and thanks against his hot skin.
Castiel gaped at Dean for a moment, torn between laughter and aggravation, then threw himself at him, wrapping his arms around his neck and holding on tight. “You are
“Um, have and hold me?” Dean suggested, his voice slightly muffled against Castiel's cheek and neck. “Till death do us blah, blah, blah?”
Dean was wearing a t-shirt, but he made motions like he was rolling up his sleeves. “All right then, let’s move this bitch.”
Castiel blinked, then picked up the sandwich and started to eat, his mind turning. What had happened, here? He narrowed his eyes and glanced across the table at Dean, who seemed completely absorbed in his food, apparently deriving more pleasure from a simple ham sandwich than Castiel had seen many restaurant diners receive from the finest world cuisines. Castiel's chewing slowed as his glance became a look, the look became a stare. Who was this man, this man had who waltzed into his apartment all snark and sex and pretty green eyes and ended up asking questions about Castiel's language tutors and fixing Castiel's broken head and giving him half his lunch?
He got ready for bed slowly – changing into his sleep shirt and sweat pants with his back to Dean so he didn't have to be seen with naked breasts – and replayed the enjoyable parts of the evening in his head: the jokes he got, the jokes he didn't get but no one seemed to mind, the food and wine, Dean's little smiles and touches, Sam's enthusiasm, Ellen's earthy humor. He smiled as he remembered Sam laughing at one of Dean's cornier jokes, Dean's eyes lighting up at the sound. Amelia had looked across at Castiel and smiled, and Castiel had smiled back, the unspoken “boys” hanging in the air between them. Castiel was so lucky to have this family, he knew; it was a family almost entirely of choice, not blood and, he thought, all the stronger because of it.
With a strangled cry, Sam snapped back into focus, and he leapt forward, grabbing Dean by his armpits and hauling him out of the bath. They crashed together to the floor, Sam slamming his back into the wall, Dean collapsing between his sprawled legs. Sam snatched a towel from the bar above him, then reached around and wrapped one end around Dean’s right forearm, the other around his left. He clamped both his hands over the wounds and held on like grim death.
There were a lot of boxes, and the space was tight, but they fell quickly into an efficient rhythm. Dean obviously knew what he was doing and seemed to make room for Castiel whenever necessary, flowing back into the empty spaces once Castiel had moved on. Their shoulders brushed once, twice, but otherwise it was like a dance, easy and smooth.
He suppressed the urge to rub his temples; Dean would ask what was wrong and Castiel couldn't face that right now. He closed his eyes briefly instead and tried to convince himself that he wasn't
He looked up and couldn't help smiling with relief at the sight of his friend, though his stomach was still infested with an entire kaleidoscope of butterflies. “Hello, Charlie,” he said warmly.
coming on to him or not. His caution after Castiel's accident in the kitchen seemed to turned off the sex and turned on some parental instinct in him, and as charming as Castiel found that, it was also frustrating, because now he was
Castiel felt his throat close up, and his eyes began to sting. He and Charlie stared at each other across the tiny table, and then they both burst into tears.
Sam’s fingers were cramping around Dean’s forearms, but he managed a slightly tighter squeeze. A question, a plea. “
his true self beginning to peek through the hated layers of femininity, but now all he could think about was how he couldn't undo it and how Dean might freak out or hate it or think he looked stupid or ugly. “Still –” he began.
“Oh, don't get me wrong, Mr. —Castiel.” Benny put up his hands. “He didn't pick fights just to fight, but he's always had this
that I want to look more like a man in the future, not just with clothes and haircuts but in my body as well.” His throat tightened. “And I can't ask you to stay with someone you'll never be attracted to, who you'd never want to have sex with. It wouldn't be fair.”
” he says, and somehow Dean knows he’s quoting; his name sounds strange and new in Castiel’s mouth, “
Dean took his beer bottle and smacked it on top of the bill with an air of finality. “Welcome Wagon.”
They’d finished stacking the boxes. They’d got the damn dresser in at last, pivoted with mere inches to spare around the left edge of the doorway. They’d got it against the long inner wall, where Castiel fussed, edging it first right, then left, then right, then, oh, just a little more! until he was satisfied with the placement and Dean was rolling his eyes good-naturedly. Castiel stood back to take one last check…
Dean shivered suddenly. The house was cold; somehow Cas or Kelly had gotten the electricity on, but there was no heat, only the fire, and no one had bothered with that since…since everything had happened. He must have lain there longer than he thought, trying to read the ceiling, and the chill had slowly seeped into him, bone deep. He wrapped his arms around himself, but it didn’t help. His whole body was trembling now, tremors surging through him like waves, setting his teeth rattling. He felt like he was coming apart.
Dean looks at Castiel. Castiel smiles, a little shyly, eyes flicking down, then up again. “Oh, yeah,” Dean says. In this particular moment, he can’t remember what he was ever afraid of.
Castiel's face and stomach fell. He began to tear the napkin into small pieces. “Um, no. I haven't told him yet,” he said in a small voice.
Then something rises up in Dean, a memory, sudden and bright and painful. He feels grief and shame rising with it, even here wrapped around Castiel like it was what he was created for.
Dean strokes Castiel’s arm. “Remember,” he says slowly. “Right before I went off to face Amara—remember I told you that you were my brother?”
“Hard to forget at this juncture,” Castiel grunted as they started up the last few steps. Dean snorted, but said nothing.
Dean sounded like he was going for outrage but couldn’t stick the landing. “I didn't do nothin'. Cas knocked the back of his head on the counter when he was standing up. Just a flesh wound. I'm off to look for ice.”
good mood tonight. And I know how you can sometimes get . . . tired when there's too much noise and too many people around. I'm just, y'know, happy you're happy, that's all.”
Dean laughed, slipping his hand out of Castiel's to wrap it around his waist and steering him towards the restaurant's entrance. “Okay, okay. I give. You win. Truce?”
Still he said nothing, but watched as Dean, silent now, slowly and carefully stacked all the DVDs together in a few neat piles and set them back in the battered box. More slowly still he climbed to his feet, brushed off his knees, and stood turned a little away, so that Castiel only saw the outline of his jaw, the edge of his brow, one high cheekbone.
Then Sam is surging forward, his face alight now with relief and wonder. “Dean! Cas!” He goes to hug Dean, but when Dean doesn’t let go of Castiel’s hand, Sam pauses, eyebrows climbing. Dean smiles a little, gives a small shrug with one shoulder. Sam grins and envelops them both in his long arms.
lately, so much happier than I've seen you for . . . god, so long.” He hesitated, his brow furrowing. “And seeing you like this, it makes me realize how
His discomfort with his body was still strong, but with his new haircut and clothes, he found he could look in the mirror now without wincing or feeling depressed and sick. He began seeing past the gentler curves to the man underneath; his high cheekbones, his strong chin and nose – features he'd always thought of before as keeping him from being truly pretty – were now reasons to rejoice.
“'S'alright, Cas,” Dean said soothingly. “We still have a few minutes. 'Sides, there's no need to go overboard – it's totally casual.”
What had happened? Had Castiel slipped into a different dimension? One where transgender people were not reviled or seen as bizarre or unnatural? Where they were actually welcomed and valued? He felt a lump forming in his throat, and his vision was getting a little watery. “Charlie, I don't know what to say . . .” he began, his heart full.
Charlie's eyes lit up, and she reached across the table to take Castiel's hands. “Wow! That's awesome, Cas!” she exclaimed. “Congratulations!”
He noticed other things, too – how being in crowds didn't seem to bother him as much as it used to, and how he wasn't as easily embarrassed when he made a mistake or failed to pick up on a joke or cultural reference. He began to go out in public more, even alone, running errands when work was slow instead of waiting for Dean to do them on the weekends, even going out to read or write in coffee shops just for the change of scenery. He talked to people – strangers! – in grocery stores and on the bus, making eye contact instead of dropping his gaze nervously.
Castiel put down the ice pack so he could take the pills and washed them down with warm cola. “It's no one's fault, Dean,” he said as he passed the can back to Dean. “It was an accident.”
Castiel gestures off to his right. “I thought I saw something. A flicker of shadow maybe. A difference in the light.”
you're not going to have to reevaluate what it means to be in a romantic relationship where your partner a man rather than a woman?”
Dean can feel Castiel beside him, can see his shape in his peripheral vision. He doesn’t turn to look, but he finds the angel’s proximity to be strangely comfortable, even comforting. Dean notices that they are walking in step. He thinks he should find that odd, but he doesn’t.
“Mmm,” Castiel agreed, though he felt a little sad that Dean had been worried about him, sad that he always had to look out for him. He reached out and ran a hand lightly over Dean's leg. “I felt fine, love,” he said. “The crowd didn't bother me at all, and you know I always love seeing Sam and Amelia and Bobby and Ellen. I had a good time.”
They drank wine – Castiel in quick gulps, Dean in slow sips – and Castiel talked until he couldn't think of anything more to say, though he knew there
Castiel chuckles, and it’s still such a rare thing that it makes Dean smile. “Perhaps. This place, where nothing happens—it held the potential for anything and everything.”
Castiel felt a ribbon of warmth curl around him, sweet and comforting, but he wasn't going to let Dean off
“F, as in Fuck This Noise,” Dean said, straightening up. His jaw was set, and there was a determined gleam in his eye. Despite his fatigue, his scraped fingers and aching muscles, Castiel felt a little thrill shiver through him.
Castiel pulled back, trying to look Dean in the face, but his eyes were closed, his face strangely serene save for a puzzled line between his eyebrows. “'Okay'?” Castiel echoed. “What do you mean, 'okay'?”
Dean was sitting more or less upright in the tub, fully clothed save for his boots and overshirt. He was staring down into the water, his expression bemused. “What y’think, Sammy,” he slurred. He did not look up. “A fi-see-ter mac-ro-seh-fallus, yeah?”
“Aw, quit whinin', Dean,” the man at the end of their little queue drawled. “Y'sound like my old man. Cowboy up, brother.”
