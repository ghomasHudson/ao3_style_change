"Dean's not gay, he's bi." Claire answered, "My dad's gay, though, if that makes any difference."
Cas rolled his eyes, "How, where, and who. Can we hear what he has to say, now?"
"Why didn't you go to the nurse?" Cas asked.
Dean turned around immediately, "Cas?"
Margaret watched him leave with an unreadable expression, and a hint of a shrug.
"Ouch," Alfie said quietly, resuming his task with the towels as her hand went to her forehead, "Whatever kind of fucked up day you're having, whatever has you lashing out, do me a favor and make sure it's passed before you get near the kids, please?"
"So he's wrong. You're not miserable, and he's full of shit? You're not completely stranded all by yourself over here on new-mom island?" Alfie asked, meeting her eyes.
Claire's eyes darted across the open pages to the figure at the tip of Margaret's finger, "Shit," she reiterated.
A gruff voice came faintly through the heavy wooden door, "I know you're home! Your car's in the driveway."
With a shaking, gasping swear, she swayed heavily, "Alfie!... I can't... can't stand up..."
Henry hurried toward him as Margaret reached for Claire's arm, keeping her aim away from Kevin and the baby. Kevin walked quickly past him even as Henry changed course, trying to reach for the car seat. Kevin dodged him, hurrying toward the house, and Alfie attempted to get closer to block him, but Henry managed to get hold of the handle, and gave it a hard yank.
"There we go, empty nest," Dean mumbled, "Okay, I'm listening."
In his office, Dean's cell phone rang. Spotting Cas' number, he picked up immediately, "Calling me at work, that's pretty hot."
After much protesting from Ben, bedtime was enforced, and Dean came back downstairs with a deck of cards and a set of chips, setting up on the now cleared table.
"Yeah? Who? Caitlin?" Dean asked, still gruffly, staying well out of swinging range.
"Holy crap, it's a zombie. Quick, Ben, double-tap!" Jack smarted off.
"Wait, Julie, what?" Ivan asked with an extra blink.
Paula chuckled in spite of herself, "That's not nice."
Alfie looked somewhat unnerved, "On your back? ...What were you seeing, anyway? I mean, you looked really freaked out when you saw Dean."
"Yeah, but this means we can relax, enjoy the party, and not worry about getting home." Sam answered.
Dean closed his menu and set it aside, wondering, as he used to while watching Cas hold Mike in a very similar way, if they had made the right decision in deciding not to try to adopt a baby, or have a child through a surrogate. They'd discussed it at one point, it had been a rather long discussion, and they'd both agreed they were just past the right age for it, and that they might consider fostering again after the boys left home, but only older children. It wasn't that he wasn't happy with the decision they made, but the question lingered in the back of his mind occasionally, a piece of life he'd missed having with Cas, that Cas had nearly missed entirely with Claire, and Dean had thoroughly enjoyed with Ben. Deep down, he supposed, he just wanted to see Cas happy, but now, especially after Cas' heart attack, that door seemed entirely closed.
The dull colors of paint long since damaged by the sun created a rusty patchwork as the sun continued to rise, the red in the sky reflecting off the occasional piece of shining metal.
"No," Cas replied sarcastically, "You're still here."
"Wine doesn't have fumes. It just brings out one's patience and understanding, and even so, children are safe in my care. There's... nothing to worry about."
Claire gave a non-committal mumble, as the side effects began to take over.
"Too much, too fast?" Castiel asked with a smile that seemed to hide a hint of sadism, and voice that dripped with sarcasm. "Like when you pray to me while you're in the shower, and it's mostly just moaning?... Do you actually get on your knees, Dean, or just imagine you do?"
She'd relayed that her car didn't run, and the sheriff had radioed in to have a deputy pick her up to get her to the hospital.
"It's occult, actually. I learned it from my black cat."
"Never were one to take things lightly. Don't worry about it. I haven't heard much from you. Noticed when the little guy got back, though. He had to come see me a couple of times, but given what was going on, I managed to avoid having any notes sent home... I called your house."
"I did, actually. But she's- Well, any teenager is going to be embarrassed by their parents anyway, but at her age, that preschool level of crap, that's devastating."
"Dean or Ben?"
"He's a kid, John. How bad could he have screwed up? He's only fourteen."
"Hey, welcome home," Sam said quietly, "You made record time, huh?"
"Yep," Alfie replied, starting back to the kitchen rather than pretend Naomi had any genuine interest in her great-niece.
"Well, if you guys get married, aren't you supposed to have the same name?"
Liam had shown some difficultly with her eyesight test, though, and had been referred for an exam with an optometrist who'd been happy to expedite his appointment with a quick call from the pediatrician.
Leaning on the door frame of her office at the location in town, Xander spotted his sister behind the desk, her back rested wearily against the wall, the lowest drawer of the file cabinet sitting wide open, and various paper in stacks around her legs.
"Pork chops and couscous."
"Uh, he bought it before Claire moved out, so, seven years ago? And he gave them a couple of years to move out, because it wasn't really this place he was after, I guess it's been empty for four and a half, maybe five years?"
Cas caught the beginning of the song, and turned to Kevin. "Is he singing a Dolly Pardon song?"
Julie smiled softly, "Well, look at it this way, one more week, then you'll be home for a while, then either you'll sink into oblivion, and go back to the behind the scenes stuff, and nobody has to know anything, or you'll make it big."
"Everything's okay, and even if it's not, it's still probably okay, just a little, you know, more difficult, I got this," Claire reassured him, "But what's not okay is I sure as hell can't give you any blood right now, so, you're going to have to schedule your next heart attack for after this is handled."
"She probably did it to teach you a lesson." Alfie commented quietly.
Claire shifted in her seat, and scratched her cheek, "He looked like he could use a friend."
Kevin continued to kiss her neck as he slipped his hand up the inside of her pajama shirt, moving slowly, and coming to a close over her soft flesh, causing her to let out a quiet gasp, "Jeez, your hand's really warm."
"No, he's coming to the house with us." Claire replied.
"I'd bet you anything that phone didn't break on its own," Lila urged, "And she can't pick up a burner at any gas station? And next, she won't be able to find her tablet, or a charger. Then she'll be tired, and take a little something to sleep over the bus moving, something for a little more energy, and she's cut off, and alone, and they sneak up on you, okay? Twenty-seven, that's her magic number, she thinks if she can get somebody to croak and join the club she'll be able boost sales across her whole label. She wanted me, Ivan got in the way, so Cynthia is her replacement."
Cas nodded, "Something's different."
Mike started to shake his head as the words sank in, "Maybe, I guess."
"Claire," Alfie said with a firmness Dean was surprised to hear, "It's an emergency, please just go. He'll fill you in on the way."
"What's that even mean? Like he doesn't know because of how his dad was?"
"Did you see what's going around online?" Kevin asked, flipping through apps on his phone.
"Right. Back in a bit," he said, hurrying out before Dean could change his mind.
Having stowed his bag in the trunk, he got in on the passenger side, reaching into the back seat for a couple of quick hand squeezes from his growing children while he put an arm around Claire.
"You thought the guy bought her off," Dean guessed.
"You have to get that piece done if you're going to have it finished for Naomi's thing in Dallas, you said you needed something dark for this. If he slows you down, you're going make up for it by taking time away from the kids."
Jess broke the short silence, "I didn't know you were seeing a counselor."
"He was very clear about knowing where we live. That was a threat."
Dean caved and leaned back as the door opened once more, and Claire lead the deputy inside. She pointed out the location of the tiny pistol, where it had been kicked to, and the deputy quickly took a photograph before gingerly collecting it in a plastic bag.
"It's not that bad, you big whiner," Dean said, reaching for the cup, taking a quick sip, and attempting to hide his sour expression.
"By not being an asshole to start with."
"I just want to see you happy, sweetheart... And I love you, and trust you enough to let you eat in my car."
A man with stocky build and a uniformly short haircut and beard was pouring a glass of red wine next to the fridge.
"I don't need your apology," Claire answered with a shrug before pressing past him, and going for the stairs.
Claire rolled her eyes, "Don't giggle about it, I'm still angry!"
"Wait..." Javier tilted to one side, getting a look at her face from a different angle as Claire gave a look of confusion at his behavior, "Did you have a thing? With Ivan? Did she steal him from you?"
(A/N: Brace yourself, this one is a doozie.
After filling the tank, he did as he said he would, locking the doors and going inside.
"Well, if you and Xander get to where you'd like a real meal off of actual plates without admitting it to your parents, maybe we can set up another D&D campaign," Caitlin suggested.
He picked up the bowl of popcorn and pulled the throw blanket she had over her down to cover her feet, and quietly moved about the downstairs, locking the doors and turning off lights.
Melody shrugged, "I don't really have any questions."
They were lies. He wondered vaguely if she'd been ordered to smile for the camera, if any of them had been honest happiness. He thought about how Claire acted day to day, and wondered if he had ever seen her smile in a way that wasn't forced.
"We're behaving." Alfie said with a quiet laugh, "C'mon, I can't pull that transmission until Dean gets back, and there's nothing else to do... And you did say you wanted to finish this later."
"How'd it go?" Kevin asked as Alfie passed the seat over the back of the couch to him, "Lots of closing? Earn your coffee? Or did you demote somebody?"
"Are you crying?" she asked, as Julie was unfastening the belt on  Cyndi's waist, "Let me guess, he was charming, and got what he wanted,  and then dumped you because you're always carrying the brat around."
"Nah, special case," Lucas replied, already stepping back, "Just need an authorization."
With a startled expression, the woman found herself at a loss for words, and headed for the door. Dean was surprised at how firm Claire had managed to keep her expression, even as the woman collected her children and left.
He leaned down to kiss her gently and let his hand fall to her protruding belly, "Obviously. Just, y'know, this is one of those times you need to let me take over."
Hushed whispers inside the bedroom only served to warn him of the inevitable, Jaime was up again. He tucked the mug and mustard behind a stack of folded laundry on the dresser to prevent his son for begging a taste, and went to the side of the bed where Jaime had climbed over Claire's lap to the center, sprawling in knees and elbows fashion, to talk to the baby.
"No pressure... For you, anyway. You can pressure me all you want."
Dean stood up as Mike pointed back to the pan of eggs on the stove behind him, and shook his head, "Finish your breakfast, I'll run over to the pharmacy and see if they've got one of those knee-scooter things so we can actually get you out to the car."
"Yes, sir."
"Sure," Xander nodded, "Yeah."
Alfie stared at her, "That's not-...This doesn't bother you at all, does it?"
Cas mumbled something incoherent as his head tilted back, and Dean took the opportunity to press firm kisses to the front of his throat, feeling the short stubble pricking at his lips.
Dean set down the file he was looking at, and pulled a set of keys from his desk drawer, "Bring Bobby's car in and see what it needs."
"Oh, yeah." Ivan answered, taking Cyndi's hand for a brief second as she reached for him, "But you'd know that, if you're babysitting."
"Watch it. I'm going to repeat every threat to law enforcement when they get here." Amelia pointed at his chest with a thick stack of papers, "I have custody according to California, and the sheriff's going to make sure she leaves here with me. There is nothing you can do, so, wherever she is, get her back here, now."
"But you both did amazing, really," Jess jumped in reassuringly.
Margaret nodded, "Well, in that case, yeah, I suppose I could give it a shot... Just no grabbing people, right?"
"Okay. Sure," Alfie answered.
"Cas is in the hospital, he needed someone to drive him, so he came and got Claire." Alfie replied, "And those two have a kind of rare blood type, so, she can donate to him if he needs it, he's done that for her."
"No, it doesn't. And I don't know what kind of chemicals are going to get into your blood, putting it on over a split lip, if it opens again, so-"
"I'm ... I'm sorry." she whispered.
"Lila, hey, whatever thi-"
"That's not all I wanted to do. God, it's like you don't even know me at all." Kevin teased, "Clearly the ice cream sundaes were the big part of the evening."
"That's bullshit," Claire replied, "And we're getting off the subject, but at some point, some time, you had to have seen some good part of my mom, and you have never said anything nice about her."
"That's her business."
"There's really no getting out of it." she whispered, "Someday one or both of us is going to die, and that's gonna be it, huh?"
Margaret walked in slowly, her expression set, and moved to sit on the couch, arranging pillows to get comfortable. Her normally bubbly personality made her stern silence all the more deafening.
He leaned into the car, rolling up the window. "I'm going to speak to Mr. Winchester, I'll move the car up to the house once he's seen it. I want to make sure he understands I wasn't running over his son."
Dean shrugged and gestured to her jeans again, "Evidently three is open to interpretation."
"I'll do it," Dean offered quickly, "I got you covered, don't give it another thought."
"I could totally see you doing that, except the whole treating a person like territory, thing." Kevin replied.
Melody shrugged, "...felt like it."
"Look,
Roughly twice a year, he'd reconsider his decision to stay, not feeling held back by anything. Even long-term relationships would have been dropped at a moment's notice were he given any indication a life elsewhere would have been any more preferable to the tiny nothing of the town of his ancestors.
"I don't want to," Melody objected.
Looking up, he spotted Julie in the doorway, "Check him out, babe, this guy's catching on."
Darting from the bed, as Claire's movements were slowed by natural paralysis of sleep, he was almost able to beat her to the door, catching up with her in the hallway. It wasn't often, and with time and age, the occurrences were growing further and further apart, but an unwelcome distraction met him as he did his best to grapple Claire to his chest and pull her back into the bedroom.
"Come on," Margaret said gently, easing herself up from the couch slowly, as not to drop Alfie's head from her lap abruptly, "He can get himself settled into his mom's old room while I get you sorted out."
Cas suppressed a roll of his eyes, "Is your back bothering you at all, or will it be enough if I hold you while you sleep?"
"My wife is grieving. You seem to be fine."
Gabe shrugged, "There was a note about it being a surprise, and saying not to tell you, which told me that you weren't the one making the guest list. And since I don't hardly know what's-his-face, and you didn't know I'd been invited, I figured we'd go for the Vegas excuse."
Margaret shook her head.
"What changed your mind?"
"So that's why you're not working on it while she's here." Dean guessed, earning a slow nod from Alfie, "Okay, how about a hundred for the print for her dad, and another hundred not to show her before he gets it?"
Eventually she found a section of items she thought might be along the lines of what she wanted, and what was in her price range, and stood for a moment, looking over the various options.
spying on people? Why the hell are you out of bed?" Claire demanded loudly, her voice carrying through the house. Her hands were shaking, and Melody flinched at the anger directed toward her.
"Ben... Hey..."
Cas gestured uselessly from habit, "I'll narrow it down to just the ones I helped raise. Claire is smart, she's happy with her life as she's set it up, her home, her marriage, her work, but formative trauma keeps her jumping at shadows. Xander, well, after the head injury, we never should have let him play football, but it would have broken his heart to say no, he's sane and content, but he's had to learn to let others help him with major decisions, and had to learn the hard way sometimes about who he can trust. And Ben doesn't know when to stop, he's going to work himself to death because he feels he could always do better or has something to prove, I think that stems from losing his mother."
Claire sat back in surprise, "I don't know how to take that."
"As long as there's nobody named Mary, we're fine. I can wait, or you can write it down or whatever."
Boots crunched on gravel outside, and Claire entered through the bay door on a direct path for the hallway and with a still-startled expression, Lucas stepped directly in front of her.
"How old are you, Liam?" Gabe asked.
"She wouldn't let me leave without a butter container of meatballs... It was weird."
Claire was waiting patiently, stroking Jaime's hair as he spoke, "..and that's all I did at school. Goodnight, baby. I'm not going to trade you for candy, I promise."
"Really?... That's kind of personal, though." Alfie whispered, slowly starting to rock her side to side, wrapping his arms across her back protectively.
"Put her on."
"I'm okay with a bag of breakfast tacos in the car."
"You get yesterday's order in yet?" Dean called down the hall. His breathing was slightly labored.
"Uh, probably not tonight, at least," Sam replied.
Dean abruptly let go of him with his hand, grabbing his wrist in what first felt like agitation, but soon adjusted to a firm hand-hold against Cas' hip, not quite enough to keep him completely pinned to the wall as Dean took him in deeper, slowly working up to a faster speed.
"Well, if that doesn't make me the most 'Baller' granny in town, nothing will," she chuckled.
He took a few breaths to compose his wording as gently as possible, "I know you said you didn't feel like you could trust him, at first, that you were afraid, but... You had to have gotten to a point where you knew you were safe, right? And you still didn't tell him what happened to you?"
"Yes, but, surely that must be hard for both of you, caring for the children equally. I can't imagine how you would do it."
Margaret shifted where she leaned back against him, as the three of them were chilling out on the living room floor in more or less of a heap, "You don't have to stay here for me, you know."
Jack scurried out of the room.
"I'm tired of playing nice," Claire replied quickly, "And I didn't put it up there to hurt you, I put it up to irritate her. But she only treats me the way she does because we let her, and I can't take it anymore."
"I wasn't really sure what it was, just looked kind of abstract, so I asked Kevin and Margaret, and- why are you laughing?"
"No." Cas chuckled.
Ivan looked up from inside the garage, "What's the matter, Claire? You don't wanna feel the power between your legs?"
"Millie?"
Ivan nodded, "I know it's not a perfect plan, but-"
Claire immediately looked concerned, "What? Why?"
Wandering into the garage to park himself on the weight bench Cas had never found a place for, Alfie waited quietly until Claire had made her final count on what items in the deep freezer needed to be thawed in preparation for the large holiday gathering. He wasn't sure exactly when the torch seemed to pass from Cas to Claire to arrange the family events, but it certainly had.
"Why?" the man asked in an accusational tone.
"Last I checked, it was kind of a woman-centric thing, so, yeah, I think it is. Not like I haven't seen blood and guts before, I mean," Claire gestured to her hand, "Saw my own tendons recently."
"I never tell you, why would I tell you now?" Alfie asked as he walked.
Dean looked up, "Something happen with your truck?"
"What color flowers you want at your funeral?" Alfie asked sleepily.
Filing into Uri's office, Uri was seated at his desk, Superintendent Keller stood nearby behind the desk, leaning back on a filing cabinet, watching something on Uri's monitor. Mrs Hamish carefully took a seat, and Cas stood near the wall, waving Dean toward the remaining seat.
Margaret shuddered at the feel of Kevin's hot breath against her ear, and the tone of his words certainly added to what she was feeling.
"Tradition?" Mike suggested.
"We aren't talking about that. Movies. C'mon, how come you don't have the listings on your phone up yet? Don't make me bust out the wine and flowers, you know I will."
Julie leaned on the counter, mumbling to herself, "It's too early for this..."
Alfie bristled at the comment, and excused himself.
"I don't care, I'd make it work. Anything is better than sending her back. I think she knows that, too, and that scares the hell out of me, what she might do about it."
She thought carefully, "Bobby didn't have anything else to leave his name to."
"This is bullshit. Stay with Mike." Margaret replied, dropping back into her seat and throwing her door open.
"No."
"Really?" Will played up his surprise, "She left the prom early, looked pretty upset, too."
Caught, Dean cracked the door slowly. Claire was staring at her shoes.
Alfie reacted immediately to the emotion in her voice, reaching for her, but she pulled away, "Hey, it's an old house, okay? It's not as bad as it sounds."
"I mean it, dad. If I had to go back there, I'd run. I'd hitchhike, sleep under bridges, anything it took, and if I got murdered, I really wouldn't care."
"I'd know it was there." Alfie replied, pulling his buzzing phone from his discarded jacket pocket.
"Sorry, how is that a question?" Kevin asked, "Sounds like a statement."
"Brain." Xander snapped, "And it's not broken just because you don't understand it."
"I'm sorry. I tried to handle it. I did everything you would have  done, she basically said so."
"I have to do this, it's not optional. I'm the one with the upper-hand, able to screw everybody over, and I know the business better than Ben or Xander, so-"
"The other night, when you were in Jaime's room, Melody asked me about something you said to Chaz," she answered, "And, eventually, the kids are going to realize just how big that rainy day fund really is, and I-... I don't want to answer questions like that in the future, like-"
"We don't know that she's not." Dean argued, "Anyway, I'm not even sure you should be part of this conversation, the last thing we need is another round at the hospital."
"You aren't supposed to have milk," Cas answered.
"Somebody's gonna call the cops." Alfie said quietly.
"Yeah. Dad was helping him with homework, but they both started getting fed up, so they took a break to throw a football around. I think they forgot."
Melody looked at the screen closely, and pointed toward one corner, "It's that one."
"Margaret called. We all know your walking, talking chill pill is out of town, and we both figured you'd need some support to help you stay calm," he replied.
"It's anonymous, I never use names, not even mine. You'd know that if you followed me."
It wasn't difficult to remind himself, however, with the thought that the man's corpse strapped to the anchor could still be sinking through pitch black water, even though it had been hours. With that, the spice was gone, Claire was still in front of him, turned on and trying to be patient, but his own needs were easily thrown aside.
The simple white undershirt fit his narrow frame perfectly, and he turned his back to her, reaching over his shoulders and pulling at the shirt, gathering the fabric into a bunch at the base of his neck, baring the skin of his back.
Claire shook her head, "If he wanted to help me, he should have done it before the guy started walking to the door. After that, I have nothing to do with it. And we can't live a normal life throwing money at everything that's inconvenient."
Margaret had had the day off, but calls still had to be made. Due to a wrenched ankle, Lucas was at the desk for the day, under orders from Dean, banished from the garage. Fred Hughes had brought his truck in, again, claiming the alignment seemed off since the rotation, and was sitting quietly on the other side of the room.
"I will take it as payment for bringing these hoodlums into my house!" Della argued from her chair, "Rummaging and stealing from me when you aren't looking!"
"Don't see that every day." Mr Danes commented as Kevin took the boy, taking the bottle into the same hand as the spatula, and shaking Linda's hand, "Don't drop him, now, that's my grandson."
"You kicked him out, now you want him back?" Kevin joked, "Make up your mind."
"Quit it." Claire giggled.
"Shh... It's still me... stay with me, let me hold you." he said gently. He continued to speak softly as he nudged her into an easier position to lean on the counter as he dropped a hand to stroke over her lips. He remembered the feeling of her arm tight around his ribs, a handful of his hair pulling his head back, forcing him to the bed years before when he'd asked her to explain what she'd been through, bending his leg up against his chest as that bastard had done to her, and the tears and sobs that shook her when she could keep explaining.
Dean set the shirt on the table, sticking the needle into the fabric to keep track of it, "What's going on at home, Mike?"
"Ben?"
"What the fuck is that? Are you, or aren't you? Small words," Cora snapped.
As he located the loose wire and reconnected it, he pondered the effect of music on the soul, and bits and pieces he could recall on the differences between radio waves and electric current. He'd had his share of electrical current applied directly to his chest to soothe an arrhythmia in his heart, and there was no doubt that the thoughts racing through his mind were small impulse signals of another form. And as far as he knew, energy throughout the universe never actually ceased to exist, only transforming into something else.
"That's Claire's husband," Cas replied.
Cynthia took a few deep breaths, and noticed the tears had stopped. A realization crept into her mind, and she smirked, "Man, if they said you had no right to the name, what would they think of me?"
Margaret shrugged. "If the cops show up, I'll tell them I heard a noise, I was scared, and too nervous to call them, so you came over to make sure I was okay, and they'll let you leave."
"Is it really that big a deal how the kids dress?" Dean asked.
Claire turned and looked back over the couch, "Any classes today, or are you going in?"
"Short staffed and overbooked, what else could I do? But if you kiss me right, I'll need a cold shower anyway."
"It'd fit the theme," Alfie answered.
Dean pulled his sleek, black, classic Impala out onto the gravel road, backing up around the bend, coming to a stop as Cas was locking his front door. He turned around, keys still in his hand, and stopped abruptly, getting a look at the car, as he walked to the passenger side.
"I had hoped she'd have a college education instead of a maternity dress when it happened," Carl replied angrily.
"She called me."
"What's this about?" Kevin asked firmly.
Alfie stammered and shrugged, attempting, and failing, to tear his eyes away, "I have no idea, but if it is, then trashy looks good."
"Well, good, because you just told me not to be funny, so I'm being not-funny. And it's not your fault, I told you, I'm the one who's been stuffing my face with junk for... forever... And I should know better, health is my business, even if it's not for human beings, the mechanics are mostly the same, so this is a hundred percent me, and shitty genes. You had nothing to do with it."
"Because she's the only one I'm obsessed with, and she knows it."
As she got to her feet with his help, he pulled her close, "Can I walk you home?"
Ben took the phone as she handed it back to him, and put it away, "Any particular reason you wanted to know about her?"
"She was telling the truth. Her mother had obvious track marks."
"Mags, you got this."
Dean's body exploded hot within Castiel's mouth as said mouth, still moving frantically against him loosened, and he began gasping through his nose. Dean shook hard, watching every movement, slips of white escaping Castiel's lips, swallowing against him, glimpses of his tongue, at the same time shaking as he coated her hand.
Claire soon had her very shapely maternity dress on, and sat down in one of the chairs to the side of the room as Alfie helped her with her boots. She'd learned with Melody that the snug fit had kept her ankles from swelling much until she'd dubbed the laces too big a hassle, and was determined to keep wearing them throughout her pregnancy. Finished, Alfie helped her up from the chair, "So, um... Next one, huh? How many?"
"Then we all are," Alfie commented, "I mean, dinner was kind of rushed. But the room service here is pretty solid. Might be better, since it has less of a trip to get to the room."
"No, this girl came in with her aunt's sick poodle. And she was, just, awesome."
"Well, she was backed up to a wall, right?"
"Included in what?"
"Are you on drugs, boy?"
"How's Millie taking it?" Cas asked.
"Fye-twuck." Cyndi replied.
"What else could it be? There's no way she's had a stomach bug for this long, she never has a temperature. At this age-"
Reaching her door, she turned around and went back to the doorway of Cas' office. "Okay, look, if I don't tell you first, Kevin's going to come over here, and then you're going to get mad at me for not telling you first..."
"I said I was sorry." Alfie replied, "You want to drive for a while?"
"Why would you hide this from me? This is huge-"
Her breathing deepened as she felt another wave approaching, "Shit! ...I'm gonna strangle him, I swear..."
Irritated by her tone, Ben grinned, "You're smart. You'll figure something out. Also, I'm moving in, in the other end of the house, probably next month. I don't really care what you tell your folks about that, but I'm happy to take a look at the bills as they come in and cut your dad a check for half."
"I don't know... I mean," Claire shifted in the armchair, "I don't know shit about kids."
"Hang on, hang on-" Sam hurried to butt in.
"So, Alfie... you guys dating, or was prom a one-off?"
"I heard the whole thing. I mean, seriously? Is it your brain or your dick that's broken?" Ben asked.
Cas nodded, turning his back toward the bar, "He's been staring for a while."
Margaret looked a little shaken, "That was loud."
Claire took the tablet and read through the short message, "Doesn't look like it. Stalker, right? Not the stalkee?"
Kevin threw his arms around her slight frame, nearly lifting her from the floor, "I'm gonna go get my stuff from across the street."
Mike stopped rubbing his eyes for a moment, "Why is Pops still sleeping?"
Storming off to the very same restroom, Aubrey was still in something of a fit, although once the door closed, he thought her sobs seemed to take on a deeper, more pained sound. Ben attempted to put the approaching awkwardness out of his mind, and continued to wait patiently.
"It's not a fight, either. I think we had a good discussion tonight, and nobody mentioned filing papers this time... That's almost progress."
"Hey..." Alfie said, patting Claire's face softly, "Claire... Try to stay awake, I'm not sure what to do."
"Proof he could seventeen, eighteen years ago, maybe. Doesn't say anything about now."
"Well... um... Okay, what if that was all it was? You know, instead of what actually happened, what you went through, what if, junior year, some sophomore copped a feel, outside your jeans?... Not the nightmares where you wake up crying, I mean like, that never happened. And what if they wanted to apologize for it?"
"Hey, come pick me up," Claire's voice came through, "Alfie's in town, so I'll call him on the way, and he can meet us there."
Alfie shot Kevin an irritated look, "It's Will's friends, same idiots that tried to get me into a fight while Claire was in the hospital."
"Sure. But maybe not while everyone's here, that'd just draw more attention to it."
"Some cleaners that said they were flammable. I don't think it's working."
"What DNA test?"
The cab of the truck was silent until they reached the shop.
(A/N: Should it get a re-edit with chapter names in the future, this chapter will be called 'Driving Lessons.'
Claire had taken an hour to get the rest of Dean's few scattered things out of the master bath, closet, and left the box downstairs, but found herself staring at the single-handgun safe on the dresser.
"It's pink."
"That's a lot to think about," Julie replied, stepping close to the driver door and peeking through the window.
Kevin patted his back firmly, "Don't know what to tell you, there. I enjoyed my time as an outcast."
"I can adjust my schedule, Claire. I don't mind driving you."
"This is the first year we get to do the haunted house without parents, Xander was really looking forward to it after last year when my dad kept going 'Look, you can see the strings,' and 'That fake blood doesn't even look real.'"
Giving an involuntary shudder, Xander shook his head, "I think I was around for that one, if it's the one I'm thinking of."
He opened his eyes to find Claire in her work clothes, a rather amused look on her face as she passed the couch, heading for the kitchen.
"You won't," Alfie said firmly, "I'd never harass her, just you."
"Yeah, I did. And there is nothing I can do to fix this, he's right."
"I love you," Dean whispered hoarsely, as though fighting his own body to get the words out.
"Oh, he's right about everything?" Henry thundered.
"Asshole customer, Mr Snyder. Says he plays poker with you."
"Dean?... Okay, why Dean?"
"Cas!" she chided, "Everything I do for you, and this is how you talk to me?"
Claire hid another smirk and went back to her seat.
"Yeah, but you don't have mom to help you."
(A/N2: Remember when Sam said, regarding Dean/Cas, he 'didn't have to approve to accept it?' Yeah, he came off as an asshole out of protectiveness, but then he came around. He paralleled a bit there, with basically 'I don't have to understand to accept/love you.' The parking lot bit was not planned, but I love how it came out.
"Still okay?"
"Also, you're talking too loud... Okay, fine... screw it... If you don't want him living with you at Bobby's, that's your business." Dean said quietly before resuming his course to the kitchen.
Lucas had apparently noticed it as well, "Heeey, kiddo. Bet your ears are burning. You're almost big enough to go running through here smacking people in the knees with a ladle."
Cas nodded, "As much as it pains me to hear about it, I'm glad someone was there for you. And while I know you hate hearing this, I feel it bears repeating-"
"And you got to meet your grandma's friend, how'd that go?" Dean asked.
Kevin checked his phone as the car pulled away from the curb, "Hey, tell Dean thanks for me when you see him. Margaret says he's giving her back her old job with a raise."
“He is here, but I doubt he will show his face after what happened.”
"Kaia worked real hard on it," the young blonde boasted.
"Six months," Dean answered.
The room went bright with the angel’s light and then faded just as quickly.
A tall glass of water was sitting next to the clock, along with his cell phone and a hastily scrawled note.
"Oh," Dean responded softly.
The angel contemplated a moment. He was eager to open his gifts.
“Hold on, choirboy, if you just pop back over to the pearly gates, being our fine, feathered friend again, what’s to stop you from just hopping back down that mortal slide? Would you just keep re-spawning infinitely like some sick video-game?”
"So, you're saying nobody's home?" Sam offered.
In the end, it took about a month to turn off a habit that had been so thoroughly ingrained into the hunter’s routine.
"Not a problem," Mary shook her head in response.
Dean’s mouth was painfully dry by the time the pain from his splitting headache woke him.
"See, Dean, it's a bee," Castiel explained when the hunter didn't react immediately, "it's got a hoodie and even a soft stinger on the—"
"Yes," Castiel responded, looking slightly saddened. "I don't even know this woman's name, nor what caused her to end up like this. I do hope that she is resting peacefully in heaven and does not mind me borrowing her form temporarily."
"How are the girls, by the way?" Sam asked.
, Dean prayed in-between curses.
. Totally realistic. This Djinn really needs to do a better job—
“Eh,” Balthazar shrugged giving Cas a pat on the back and shooting a nervous look over at Jack. “What’s a good stabbing between friends, right?”
All eyes turned to the heavily pregnant angel.
"I am the same height I have always been," the nephilim replied with a confused look, pulling back.
"My Garth threw a really awesome gender reveal party for our twins, tell them honey."
At that, Sam raised an eyebrow. "You, clothes shopping?" he smirked at his brother.
Castiel placed a hand on his flat stomach, closing his eyes briefly.
Castiel squinted at the corner of the room, seeing a familiar figure trying and failing to teleport away to somewhere—succeeding only in looking constipated.
?" Jack asked.
Sam didn’t know what he expected.
The angel rolled his eyes.
“What is the meaning of this?” Naomi demanded, glaring at both Jack and Castiel.
"Right," Sam responded at length, shuffling back out and into the backseat.
“Stay back, Dean,” the angel said hoarsely.
"Am I always the last to know when something big happens with you two?" Jody scoffed at the Winchesters, throwing up her hands. "Claire is going to have a cow when she sees this."
“Don’t leave me,” Dean blurted out, eyes wide and wild, automatically grabbing the other man’s hand before he even realized what he was doing—in a near repeat of last night.
Cas looked up at the hunter with a pained, confused look as Dean pinned him in place on the floor, Billie busting through the door just in time to be engulfed by the tendrils of the void.
"Why does this sound like goodbye?"
Cas still tasted like freshly cooked eggs, and Dean was sure he still tasted like whiskey, barely covered up by coffee and bacon—well
"I promise, you won't hear a peep out of me, dearie."
”Is it wrong of me to be glad to no longer have a uterus?” Castiel asked.
"Thank you, Mary," Castiel said appreciatively, before frowning at the other two Winchesters. "Was that really so difficult to explain?"
Less than a minute passed before they were interrupted again.
For as long as he could remember, Dean held to the sage, ancient wisdom of 'wrap it before you tap it.'
“These are Celtic runes of protection,” the angel marveled. “It looks quite old.”
"It was—somehow the same—yet at the same time—very different," the angel answered thoughtfully.
"Cas, this is the Halloween section—"
“Kid, quick, heal him,” Dean ordered frantically.
"Of course," Castiel smiled behind unfamiliar brown eyes, crowding into the Winchester's space.  "So long as you'll have me."
It had been years since Castiel had experienced existing as a simple wave of celestial intent. It didn't feel the same as the last time. He could feel his light fading. It was embarrassing how much grace that witch's spell had forcibly burned from him. In this state he wouldn't survive outside a vessel for very long.
Only then was all right in the world, even if the universe was falling apart around them-that would be a problem to be solved another day.
"Who am I?" the middle-aged woman with dyed-green hair replied. "Who are you? Especially this one," she said, approaching Castiel curiously, "you shouldn't be able to move at all. Just what are you, now?"
Castiel looked back one more time and nodded before throwing himself through the door.
He twisted in the covers waving his arm around wildly, managing to smash his fist into the offending device until the noise finally stopped.
"Shut up, Sammy."
Sam dropped his duffel, "Um—Dean—"
“Dean, go to sleep,” Castiel demanded, turning to waddle back to the other end of the hall.
"I had a nightmare, a terrible nightmare," Dean sighed deeply, closing his eyes. "I dreamed that we were in the bunker, and you were leaving with The Empty, and Billie was was going to kill us, and you pushed me down, you pushed me out of the way, and then she was killed but The Empty engulfed you and then it dragged you away."
"And just where did you dig up
Now Dean was drawing a total blank, chowing down on bacon while Cas smiled at him softly.
Naomi rolled her eyes as she got up and walked off.
"Wow," Dean said softly with awe in his voice, "I can't believe we're having a baby, Cas."
"And I am still unclear why there are so many messages about showering babies," the angel continued.
“To angel-kind,” Jack clarified, producing a small empty vial from nothing and holding it up. “Cas, you have a choice to make if you wish to go through that door.”
“Was it a good dream?” Castiel asked tentatively.
"Good morning," Castiel interrupted, appearing in the doorway.
"Yes, I do believe you connected four," she nodded with a soft smile.
"Castiel," Mary explained, putting a hand on the angel's shoulder, "a baby shower is a party put together by your loved ones where you are showered with gifts to help care for your newborn. I had one before Dean was born."
"Rowena, what are you doing here?" Castiel asked of the redhead that had just barged in. The angel was currently sitting in the middle of a pile of carefully wrapped colorful gifts that he was just getting ready to start opening.
"I thought I should be polite," Castiel said, "so I answered that I was in the second trimester."
Dean grinned, taking another sip of his beer.
Blue eyes blinked awake.
?” She replied incredulously. “This coming from you.
"Huh, wha?" Dean snapped out of his daydream to find his brother glaring at him from behind his laptop.
Jack titled his head in confusion.
some new clothes."
“Hello, boys.”
"But I did in fact find this woman at the hospital nearby," Castiel explained, "She was what I believe you refer to as a 'vegetable'. In some rare cases, a human's soul is taken by a reaper at the point of death, but artificial means keep the body alive."
"It is," Castiel admitted, stepping forward to check on himself, "even though, as an angel, it really shouldn't be."
"Thank you," the angel huffed, before turning curtly and marching off.
"I—don't know," the nephilim responded slowly, lowering his hand. "I sensed something—odd—for a moment, or at least I thought I did."
“Dean?” Castiel questioned.
"Hey, I'm right here," Cas said softly, enveloping the distraught hunter in a hug, "and I'm fine."
“He’s been better,” Sam admits to Castiel, shaking his brother’s shoulder slightly, getting only an angry grunt and snore. At least he was still breathing. Sam didn’t want to even
“Dean?” The former angel tried again.
“Dean’s been eating those a lot lately,” Sam explained, starting the engine, “I think because he knows it was—
and apparently gone
"Cas!" Dean and Sam yelped in unison.
Ignoring the later part of that comment, Cas interrupted, “Wait, you saw Jack?”
Dean scooted closer and wrapped his arms around the angel, pulling him in for a tentative kiss.
"What is this hunt supposed to be about again?" Dean asked, packing rifles into his duffel that was thrown up onto the main bunker table.
“You all won’t be needing those anymore,” the young God declared. “Hell is sealed. Heaven is sealed. No more missions on earth. I want you all to play nice together.”
“One moment.” Jack closed his eyes for a few seconds, and there was suddenly a soft glow around him that then concentrated into his hands, opening to reveal a blue stone.
They fell onto the motel bed in a passionate embrace. Forgotten on the dresser sat two cowboy hats and matching themed clothes ready for a fun day out in Dallas, Texas-that cowboy themed wedding venue wasn't going to find itself.
“Cas, I can’t—not when you are in the middle of having a baby,” the hunter complained, shifting in the chair he had pulled out into the hallway to watch the angel pace up and down.
"How was that?" Dean asked, eyes filled with love.
“Oh, I’m there!” Balthazar exclaimed, snapping his fingers and also disappearing.
“Feathers!” Crowley greeted, sizing up Castiel who immediately stepped in front of Dean to block him from Crowley’s line of sight, “Or should I say,
“You sent her
Jack's expression changed, thinking of his mother.
Sam immediately bolted up from his seat in the bunker library, scattering several books to the ground and ran down the hallway to go find his brother.
"You know," Garth began, taking a sip of his drink, "Garth is a really strong boy's name."
Eileen signed something to Castiel and the former angel signed enthusiastically in response.
—But a voice other than Sam answered on the other end.
Sam narrowed his eyes, suddenly getting a bad feeling.
"I know that look," Castiel said suddenly, without even looking up from the ancient document in his hands. "You feel guilty."
“Dean, open your eyes,” the angel breathed shakily. “Come meet our son.”
"Crowley never called
"Garth called," Sam explained, hastily throwing a few more items into his bag, "they've got a runaway, sounded pretty frantic."
"My point exactly," Castiel said plainly, turning down another aisle in the baby section of the store and picking his own selection from the wall.
"Well—"
Dean blinked a few times, slowly setting his beer down. It wasn't often that the kid called him that, but it had been happening more frequently.
"What's going on?" Castiel asked, entering the room clad in loose pajamas, to find Sam and Dean dressed and preparing to leave.
The former angel jolted awake at the sound of the bunker's main door slamming closed in the distance.
“I’m sorry Dean couldn’t be here,” Sam said, giving the former angel a big hug, “but I promise he’ll be so happy to see you once he’s conscious.”
"Cas," the hunter breathed, letting his hand slide up from Cas's neck to gently cup his jaw.
They had slowly turned the room across from Dean and Castiel’s bedroom into a simple nursery with all the basic necessities.
“He’s right, Dean,” Mary added, popping her head out from her bedroom door. “It will be several more hours before anything interesting happens.”
"I appreciate the offer, Dean, but that is not necessary," the angel replied finally after a pause. "I'll only be in this body for a couple of weeks."
"I think my point is that I don't really want anyone calling me
"Hello, Dean," Castiel responded, climbing into the bed next to the hunter.
Suddenly a fierce blush crept up onto the Winchester's face.
need a shower.”
"Give us a minute, would ya?" Dean said, without taking his eyes away from Cas. Behind them Sam pulled the bedroom door closed, footsteps retreating deeper into the bunker.
The hunter grumbled slightly, finding a more comfortable position using Castiel's breasts as a pillow.
"Technically, I am now capable of leaving this body," the angel frowned with a pained expression as he answered, "but our baby would die."
"Dammit, Sammy," Dean mumbled into a nipple, "why did he have your phone, anyway?"
“I’m so sorry—” Castiel began with pained look.
Dean nodded.
"Hello, Claire," the angel greeted, giving the young woman a tentative hug.
“Son!” Lucifer called out in an overly dramatic manner, appearing before Jack. “Oh, how I missed—”
"The case?" Sam offered.
Dean was aware that he was staring—gaping even. Cas was already naked at full attention and walking over to the nearest shower, twisting it to hot.
Jack titled his head a bit further, causing Dean to raise an eyebrow.
Sam stood off to the side with Mary who approached Castiel.
“Huh. Great job kid.” Dean added with a grin.
, Cas.”
There was a faint glow coming from the edges of his vision. But there should be no light in the void.
“Were you trying to fly away just now?” Castiel accused.
The witch materialized a chair from thin air and continued ranting about how much she hated Rowena to her captive audience of two, giving zero fucks about the death glare Sam was shooting her as he listened to his brother shout profanities in-between Dean describing all of the ways he was going to murder this bitch for what she did to his angel.
The hunter groaned in response.
Dean opened his mouth and then closed it again, deflating slightly.
Somewhere on the other side of Heaven, Naomi materialized and plummeted face first into a massive corn field.
At that Castiel gave the younger Winchester a worried look, and his stomach growled again.
"Hey, kid," Dean greeted, "what can I do for ya?"
After the world stopped spinning, Castiel slid from Dean, taking up a relaxed position to cuddle at his side.
“Cas?” Dean asked, rushing over and kneeling in front of Castiel, checking him over.
“This isn’t a quick process, Dean,” the angel retorted, pausing slightly as another wave of pressure hit.
“So then Ahsoka—”
Dean made a little noise in the back of his throat at the sight and then Castiel turned his head to meet his eyes and Dean was gone. He already spilled the three little words why not spill everything else.
“If you make this choice, I want it to be a fair one.”
Castiel draped a blanket over Dean’s half asleep form, satisfied that the man was comfortable, but as he turned to leave, the hunter grasped his wrist suddenly.
Castiel clicked on the link for 'J' on the screen and started scrolling.
Sam and Dean watched the angel's face scrunch in deep concentration for a few moments.
"Cas?" Dean asked with uncertainty.
"Are you seriously giving me
“Did I hear something about a hot tub?” Balthazar asked, appearing from nowhere, apparently eavesdropping.
The sheriff froze as she reached the bottom of the stairs, "—time."
“Dean?” Castiel questioned as the hunter pulled his arm forward until the former angel’s chest was up against Dean’s back.
A few minutes passed before it hit Sam all of a sudden, eyes widening—one terrible possibility that he had to rule out right away.
“This,” Jack gestured at an infinite white wall before them and the circular door upon it.
He hastily reached for the bedside table, finding a lamp and clicking it on.
Once in the hallway, Dean, still tying up his robe, turned to Sam.
Dean didn't truely realize how exhausted he had been, until he awakened a couple of hours later with warm breath at his neck, and an arm clinging to his waist. He had fallen asleep hugging Cas.
Castiel rolled his eyes. Dean and Sam shared a look, then shrugged.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly.
"Babe," Dean began as the angel started licking the inside of the jar. "What are you doing?"
Castiel hugged his son tightly, before stepping back.
"Come on, Cas," Dean pleaded playfully, handing the small outfit set to his baby-mamma. "What's wrong with it?"
“I just really,
“You know I’m right!” Lucifer yelled, following her further into the maze of corn.
"What?" Cas replied gruffly, dropping his towel to the ground, forgotten.
"Thanks," Dean began, "but—"
"It's over. None of that happened," Cas reassured, stepping back to look his future husband in the eyes, "We're together. And I love you."
"What's this?" Sam asked as Dean surprised everyone with a small round cake at the end of their usual Thursday night bunker family dinner.
of all people. And after the angel’s sacrifice he knew why—Cas’ words had been running through his head every day since. But that didn’t mean it was any easier for Dean to believe.
"I can see that."
"Because it is."
"Dean, what the hell?"
Dean’s bedroom was quiet save for the soft snores of the hunter and the gentle breathing of the former angel sleeping in his arms—until Dean’s phone started vibrating on the bedside table.
“Dean!”
Castiel tilted his head curiously as Dean stormed into the bathroom and threw open the shower curtain.
“How are you here?” Dean whispered as he took the items handed to him, Cas once again settling in the floor next to him.
“Dean?” Cas questioned, flushed and undone.
Groaning, he struggled to lean over—
,” the archangel hemmed and hawed under the scrutinizing gaze of new-God and his sort-of-dad—
"Well, too bad, you fucking asked. I'm getting some eggs. Conversation over."
goes to Earth?”
“Don’t die, don’t let it take you,” he begged, tightening his grip.
"Thank you, Dean." Castiel said sincerely, taking a slice of cake.
"Cas?" Dean asked softly.
”Cas, please don’t stop, can’t the baby wait for two seconds,” Dean complained, “I was almost there.”
“Dean—”
Castiel gasped as Dean's hand wound its way under his shirt and found his breasts.
“What is he doing here,” Castiel complained as Crowley descended the stairs of the bunker, followed by Sam and Eileen.
"Please, Dean."
When Castiel entered the nursery, he found Jack was already there, holding a story-book.
"You dumb bastard," Dean grumbled into Cas's shoulder, holding on as if afraid that if he let go, Cas might disappear.
Suddenly, the group was interrupted by a rush of air and a familiar figure materializing in the middle of the room.
“Angels aren’t allowed on earth anymore. I chose this, Dean.”
“And you are sure some crazy new entity isn’t going to go
“Whoo!” He cheered after a beat.
There was a soft knock at the door to announce his arrival before the angel gently turned the knob and entered.
"Dean, I am neither a ‘doctor’, nor a 'girlfriend'," Cas replied with puzzled air-quotes.
"Everything."
"Dean," Castiel said gruffly, "I'm pregnant, not injured. I can help."
The former angel’s eyelids felt heavy as he leaned his head against the window, the soft vibrations of the road lulling him towards sleep.
Sam sighed in exasperation.
Raphael gasped in confusion as the angel blade suddenly blinked out of existence with a snap of Jack’s fingers.
“That poses an interesting question, if a former demon dies as a human, what happens?” Sam asked, flipping through another research book.
but I have a feeling it won't fit you anymore."
Dean swallowed hard and quickly stripped off his boxers, taking his place at the shower to the right of Castiel’s.
“Hello!” Jack smiled and waved. “I’m God now. But you can just call me Jack.”
"One moment," replied a gruff voice that was several octaves deeper than what one would expect from such a petite woman.
“She said she could easily kill you in your sleep, and Cas asked if he could help.”
“Get off me!” Naomi growled, as the devil rolled away.
"What?"
Castiel’s grace was still weak and waning, but there was enough left for him to instinctively know this was Heaven—and to be specific, one of the blank white rooms that would eventually be the personal heaven of some not-yet-passed, human soul.
"Dean," Castiel said, "I am open to experimenting sexually with you with this body."
”Jack,” Castiel began softly, “I don’t think that I properly thanked you for saving my life the day James was born. Without your grace I would likely have expired.”
"I just hope it's not a frickin’ Leprechaun again," Dean sighed.
"Dean, I'm sorry," the angel apologized. "I didn't mean to wake you."
"Do the thing," Dean growled with hungry eyes.
"It's okay, Dean."
Not if Dean Winchester had anything to say about it.
"How was I supposed to know!" Sam complained. "You guys have been staring at each other with the same goo goo eyes for years!"
—he was very, very wrong.
“Jack,” Castiel asked slowly, “what did you just do?”
The three approached the dark warehouse with the usual heightened caution—in front, Sam with a machete, followed by Dean with the demon-killing knife, and Castiel following in the rear, angel blade at the ready.
Ben noticed Claire bustling around in her room, sorting out her backpack with the door open as he'd been leaving his own door, and stopped in her doorway.
Claire rolled her eyes and took a repair manual from the bookshelf behind Alfie, heading for the garage.
In the kitchen, Claire's chair scraped against the floor as she stood, and Cas straightened, attempting to hold the small snake out of sight, hoping to have Jaime return it to the back yard without alarming her, "We are going to watch a movie and give your mother a break, because she had a very difficult day. What do you want to watch?"
Ivan looked up from his screen, "So, how much traveling can you do before things get to where you need to be home?"
"Exactly. And those couples that are honest and open with each other, and everything fits, they're happy because they found a keeper, and they respect each other. So where do you and Millie fall on that scale?"
"There's something you're not saying, because you think I'm gonna take it wrong, but I know what it is."
Stowing his helmet, Alfie left the garage. With Claire's response, he considered his chances of an imminent breakup dropping from sixty percent to forty, but he was still uneasy about it.
"Cas-"
"It's not your fault." Alfie said quietly.
"Is everything okay?" Cas asked quietly.
"What?" Margaret's tone was suddenly less than impressed.
up those damn stairs... Sleep on the floor, even, if you want me to, I don't care... You're an addiction, and I am always itching for a fix, you know that! ...Being away from you sucks."
"I guess it's next. I was kind of avoiding it," Claire replied.
"Yeah, I bet that's all they're doing," Xander commented.
Determined there'd be an argument before there'd be any more distance, Cas stood and moved into his path, "I am trying to make this right. I know it has to be hurting you as well, because you love the kids as much as I do, and it would kill me to lose any of them. I can't explain it, or quantify it, it's not less or more, it's just different with her. I held her on the day she was born, I failed her in too many ways to count, and it is taking everything I've got not to drag Alfie into some remote corner of the yard and demand that if a doctor ever suggests it's Claire or the baby, he chooses Claire."
"So we'll put one on her, no big deal."
The line went silent on both ends as neither particularly wanted to end the call, nor had any idea what to say. There was still a bitter anger between them, but while Cas was aware of certain insecurities having possibly begun the ordeal, he had made the decision to dig in his heels, refusing to admit any guilt toward Dean's simmering distrust.
"C'mon, a pebble, though? All the shit he put you through? Tried to call you a... Look, nobody's around, you should teabag his hood ornament." Dean said in a hushed voice.
Time slipped away again, and after a while, somewhere between minutes and hours, she was aware that he'd fallen asleep as well. The sound of his deepened breathing cued her mind that all was well, unlike many years prior, on a far colder night.
Dean looked away, "Kevin said his mom was helping Will's mother make the arrangements, he had no idea Claire was involved."
"Coming up fast, right? Give me a second, I gotta do something, the cord is... yeah... It's okay, just hang on..." Dean said quietly, slipping a finger against the baby's neck, and sliding a loop of the cord over it's head. He'd barely let it go as another contraction swept through, and the baby slid out into Dean's hands.
"I know, buddy. We'll come visit again soon, but right now we have to go," Jack replied, heading for the gate.
"Well, look at her, she's a Lauren."
"He's right, though, that is really hot."
Claire smiled, "You don't want me becoming your best customer. If my husband's face ever sees your fist again, you'll be seeing my face every day after I get off work... Truce?"
Charlie nodded, "It's a big deal... I can go with you, face the wall or whatever."
"Your sons are very different from my Samandriel. I think they are all good men, though. I am happy to see that... I only know what my sister tells me about his friend, Kevin, though. When I knew him, he was a strange boy, his son is more normal... I hope you're right about Michael," she mused, "Cas, I want to ask something, I don't mean to be cruel, so I won't ask Claire this, but you would have to know."
"You need a nap."
A muffled sound came from the back along with sounded like Millie's voice replying to admit she was delayed, and soon after, Millie emerged with a wide tray and carefully wrangled it into the main glass case. Wiping her hands on her apron out of habit, she closed up the case again, slightly out of breath, "Okay, what's up?"
"Hey, look what the cat threw up," Kevin said loudly, giving him a once-over as the girl at the desk motioned to the sign-in book and informed Kevin that Ivan had come in for a cut.
"There we go. I'm gonna go ahead and start cleaning this up."
Alfie raised an eyebrow, "Just get on."
Claire turned her attention back to the open page, "Did you watch Mel after dinner?"
"She said she's a victim of the gay agenda, and she was scared to send the boys to your office, seeing as you're not a raging hetero bible-thumper, but they were out of control, and then you told her to leave."
"She's lying."
She'd made a suggestion, something that she rarely could calm herself enough to find enjoyable, and he'd happily agreed, trying with much difficulty to contain himself in the hotel elevator.
He was vaguely aware of it when someone brought a round of what had to be the most disgusting jello shots in the world to the couch.
Dinner had put all four of them in a better mood, and as Claire was digging out a movie Ben hadn't yet seen, Dean and Cas shifted the furniture in the new downstairs office a bit more, and wound up on the front porch swing.
"She told me I was already born when you came along, and to write down all our birthdates and do the math," Cynthia huffed.
"Are you kidding me?"
"My opinion hasn't changed."
"Hey." she called, "You're off the clock, you're supposed to go home."
"Actually, um.. Those are for you." Dean replied, "See, I wanted to ask you out for a while, but somehow we keep winding up on one of the porches for a couple of hours, and... Anyway, I was thinking, a real date. After all this, when Claire's out of the hospital, and everything calms down... If you're up for that."
"What do you mean?"
Kevin tugged her hair to rest over one shoulder, pressing a gentle kiss to her neck.
"Kevin warned me."
He could hear Dean speaking to Claire and washing up in the attached bathroom as he went into the nursery, setting his tiny, new daughter on the changing table and carefully unwrapping her just long enough to put a diaper on her, but he found himself distracted by her tiny, perfect fingers and their strong grasp.
As the crux of the episode was fast approaching, Cas gave Dean's thigh a firm squeeze. "Dean," he breathed, "Be a dear, would you... take care of that?"
"Back again, huh?" Alfie asked with a small smile.
"Fine. But you're still the baby's emergency contact."
"Right."
"Yeah. With our luck, now that we're done, and declared we aren't having any more kids, this is when it's going to take. So, you know, get that name sorted out, or I'm gonna let Mel and Jaime flip a coin, one gets to pick the first name, and the other gets the middle."
"You're still keeping records of everything, right?" Sam asked.
Kevin swung his legs down, adjusting to sit normally, "What about once I get good at it? I'm gonna need somebody alive to practice on."
"I have no idea what I said-"
"Cas has a landline at my house. I didn't know, and Claire forgot it was there."
"That's not what I'm saying." Cas replied quickly.
"He's never going to see it. And even if he did, I'd just tell him to shove it."
Alfie tightened his arms around her, and shifted slightly as she lay her head on his shoulder, "It's okay... I'm glad he tells you the truth. Nothing like my family."
"Yes?" Claire answered a moment later.
Ben nodded, and with the voice of a startled child, he crept closer, "I think I'm ready to get down now."
Dean scoffed, "You came to the right person, at least."
"More like thirteenth grader." Xander answered.
"No, just, you're supposed to take them in every three months once they have teeth, until, like, two. Nothing's wrong. I'm already looking up pediatric dentists, I just didn't know we'd need to do that this soon."
"What's going on, Aiden?" one of the boys asked as the older boy had stopped, and Mike noticed that further down the street, still beating a hasty retreat were several shadows moving quickly to a darkened yard.
"Uh-huh, sure. Like you were careful with Melody?" Margaret replied, taking the second shot as she went back to the kitchen.
"Part of him ate it up, part of him felt guilty because he wasn't there to start with. I mean, you can't plan these things, but he took him in to urgent care, and then they crashed on Jaime's floor that night, because Jaime didn't want anyone but Alfie around him. Attitude went up to eleven, y'know?"
Claire pulled up the file on the screen with a nod, reviewing the last repair.
Lauren gave a short complaint and reached toward the slide, but Cas patted her back gently as he started up the steps, snapped his fingers to cue Cocoa to follow him inside, and closed the door, dropping the lock bar against it to keep it closed. Turning around, Melody was at the table with an empty glass, and in the living room, Claire and Alfie were speaking quietly, at least until Claire heard the bar fall into place.
"Mel, I am so sorry. Your dad and I should've listened to you, and asked questions, and-... I know we really let you down this time-"
"I'm sure Cas wouldn't mind coming down here to walk you home, you want me to call him?"
"It's not his fault, Mr Novak, he's practically an orphan. Doesn't get how the parent-thing works." Kevin said.
"He's not getting my vote," Claire groused.
Cynthia sat back in her chair, "I told him what my grandma told me, and it was kind of a fight, and then he dragged me out to the bar to talk to some-... some shithead. I think his name was Chaz."
"Cas, please..." Dean breathed.
"I don't... I don't know what to think, honestly, gentlemen."
Claire set the papers she was holding aside, and it was perfectly evident he'd gotten her full attention.
"Maybe you should send her a calendar. Apparently they don't have those in Paris." Claire mumbled.
"If she would have just called me, I would have told her not to." he whispered.
"Yeah, but there's no girls here."
Cas was concerned the moment he saw the Monte Carlo in Claire's spot in the driveway, and picked up his pace as he made for the front door.
"And then, later on, the next round with the developers, for god's sake, just sell it already."
She turned to Alfie, "Would Ivan's folks be able to recommend somebody else, do you think? I mean, of course, you could do worse, but you could also do a lot better."
Claire put all of her weight on her other leg and shoved up from the floor, heading for the bath. A bag of frozen peas sounded like a horrible idea, but heat might help.
"Ouch," Blake responded.
"More than a few, yeah," Claire answered with a nod.
"And he's been a terror the entire time. And he's getting worse! He gave another child a bloody lip a week before Ben Winchester started here, and you know it. Cas told me about transportation suddenly misplacing the video, thankfully Charlie was able to get to it anyhow. I'm sure you don't mind, I've already given Mr Winchester a copy for his lawyer."
"What the hell? ...Why?"
"So, she knows me because you two are close?" Claire asked, keeping her voice quiet.
"She's tiny!" Jess fawned over the tiny puppy, "Is she big enough to be away from her mom?"
"Do you think he would do something like that?" Cas asked.
"So, we go in for the paper Monday, go back with the kids on Thursday?" Dean asked, coming to a stop and sitting up.
Alfie stroked her hair gently, "Give me a second, okay?"
She squirmed a bit with the last one, batting at her ear, but stayed in place, eyes glued to the colorful characters on the screen, and he put the cap back on the bottle, moving it to the back of the couch above her. After a short time, Melody sniffled loudly and stuck a finger in her mouth, clearly coming close to napping. He continued to stroke her hair, pausing a moment to feel the temperature of her forehead, which as overly warm.
Upon the bed in what had been the guest bedroom at the small house in the junkyard, Cas let his head sink into the pillow as he caught his breath, "I can't do this all day again."
Dean, laying on his stomach, lifted his head slightly. "Hey... What's wrong?"
Ben, interrupted by the loud start of the music as Timber began to play, leaned over the table to say something to Claire.
Caitlin had to have heard the car, and came out right away, stopping halfway to the car as he got out. His mood returning from the night before, he pulled a half-finished bottle of water from the center console, left there he wasn't sure how long, and pitched her the keys before starting for the back of the house.
"Yeah, but Mom doesn't feel good, and Dad's busy," she explained, opening the door to let them in.
Ivan pulled into the lot of the diner, looking for a parking spot, and finally found one on the side facing the road, half way across the lot from the door, and started to pull in.
"Looked like she hadn't slept all night." Dean said with a small shake of his head, "She'll be okay. She's tough."
"Because if he's my problem, he ain't yours," Bobby replied harshly, leaning forward, and punctuating his remark with a drink, his ice still taking up most of the glass.
"No, that," Alfie cut in, seeing the color rising in Claire's cheeks, "That won't work. Ketchup doesn't apply heat and kill bacteria. Also, the kitchen needs to know in case the fryer is broken, or if they aren't cooking them long enough. And besides that, she can't eat these."
"I'm still not talking to Jack... on the bus home, I was thinking about when we went to see Xander, and... I snuck into the junkyard. The gun Xander was using was one of Trey's, and he took home one of mine, I found Xander's out there near the stack, and, I dunno, I just climbed up there to sit for a while, and I didn't hear Claire. Cas came up to check on me."
Ben felt guilty for just having been involved, and wondered what his own mother would have said, had she been the one receiving him from the care of his principal. He had an idea what his father was going to say, but it had been years without her. He worried sometimes that he was starting to forget the sound of her voice.
Ben looked irritated, "Don't take her side."
"I ...didn't think he'd believe me." Alfie answered, looking at little surprised she'd brought it up, "I'm sorry, if you want, I'll tell him."
"When did you do that?"
Claire gave a weak snort, "It wasn't appropriate."
"He said that you, um-..."
"Don't call her that!" Julie growled.
"I'm sorry," his voice was shaken, "I just needed to see you."
"I bet Jaime and Mel are going to their house," he reasoned, "I could take the couch, or whatever, it doesn't have to be a big deal," Mike argued.
"Forty-seven miles an hour," Alfie informed her calmly, even as her stomach expressed its displeasure with a wave of nausea, "But that's specific to this exact car. Any other car, I'd suggest working up from about 30."
"If you can hear them, they can hear you." Claire whispered.
"But I would not say that about-"
Margaret snaked her hands up the back of his shirt, gathering the fabric with her thumbs as she went, tugging at it firmly when she reached his shoulders to get him to struggle out of it.
Xander had picked up on the way the customer had been talking over Claire, and interrupting. He could barely concentrate when others gave him the same treatment, and it was rare that once interrupted he could finish his train of thought without starting over. Cora used to interrupt, long ago, but had learned to listen for cues that he'd finished his sentences, much the way Dean and Ben had. Claire had taken longer to adjust, and Cas had never needed to.
He sent Ben back to his truck for a roll of cables, and continued to set up.
The phone rang several times on speaker before Cas answered, shuffling papers in the background, "Claire... everything okay? You weren't answering."
Claire shoved the convertible top down into place, almost expecting to hear something snap as she did. "Okay, what else?"
"Hi..."
Dean chuckled, "Good thing I left her running."
"Samandriel, we were trying to find out more about you before having you on the show," the second host said in a quiet, paced tone, "So we were looking up stuff online about you, and one place said you're married to this blonde woman, and another place said this other guy, some Asian fellow, was your boyfriend, but that you're not married. We dug around in some old interviews, and we couldn't find, really, anything concrete. Care to clear any of that up?"
"Think Alfie can take the other half of one of them for you?" Xander asked quickly before they were cut off by the closed distance and earshot, "Hey, Matt. Harker. Good to see you guys."
"Well, if you want, but it's not a huge deal, I just-" Ben tried.
"I meant, are you going to tell him that part?"
"And somehow that turned into talking about sex," Alfie added, "Work party thing go okay?"
"Maybe you're right," Alfie answered, "Maybe this is so bad you should be somewhere less stressful while I tell them to leave, we give up trying to get everyone to play nice, even though you're perfectly capable of standing up for yourself and I'm not asking you not to."
"Dinner isn't ready," Cas stated.
"I'm not sure it'll work. If it doesn't, I'll have made myself miserable, and-"
"I couldn't sleep, what was I supposed to do? Anyway, I figured since it's just us, we'll make it easier this time, we won't get so lazy, if just, everything you can't have is gone. So I-"
"Okay, kiddo, I'm not understanding you real clear right now-"
"I won't tell if you won't."
Easily sobered by the more somber aspects of their life together, and the way it currently reflected on their beloved friend, Alfie took her hand gently, "Last night, before we got to the hotel, I mean, you held up great, considering... If you're okay, though, can you talk to him?"
The knocking on the front door was unexpectedly brash compared to the easy silence the two within the house had acclimated to, easily identifying the guest as the one who was expected.
Claire gave a small smile, "You have no idea. So when it comes to Xander, just remember, he had his head injury and almost died right in front of me, and I will not put up with some useless ex-jock like you giving him any trouble. You will watch your fucking language and mind your manners. Whatever you have to say to him, you can say nicely."
"Don't be ridiculous. Obviously I'm keeping you in the basement, I only let you out now that you knocked me up."
"Are you feeling any better?" Dean asked, wrapping an arm around Cas' ribs to support him as he returned him to the side of the bed.
"Oh... Well, how do we tell Kevin that?"
"I'm not stupid enough to walk around whining that I'm a nice guy, and 'why won't anyone date me' masking the assumption that women owed me something, it could've been-"
Dean shrugged, "Nah, it um... seems like he puts up with Ben more than he should have to, anyway. You got any friends that babysit?"
"Yeah, you did. You were real clear," Dean replied, "I'm just trying to figure out how you handled living alone before, that's all. Just thought something might help with the empty nest thing you've got going on."
Will shrugged and chuckled. "I know what I want, and how to get it."
"Sam, stand still, please."
She'd arrived in her cruiser, in street clothes, unconcerned with the mess of steadily graying hair atop her head. The deputy who called it in had gone inside to speak to the good rabbi, leaving her to look over the line of teenage boys sitting on a drier portion of the curb, and a little further off, Aiden, the only one who'd been cuffed.
Ben nodded, "Yeah, Pops. Any time."
Shortly, a waitress, likely a high school kid Claire didn't recognize, brought them their orders. With a look of relief, Claire picked up one of her tater tots and bit into it, only for her features to change to a look of disgust a moment later. She quickly reached for a napkin, and spit out the offending bite.
"I'll just get him into a room with Claire, if he's on drugs, she'll know, and she'll tell me."
Alfie looked over his shoulder, "Yeah, right."
"I can do it for the whole tin of cookies," he answered, not looking in her direction at all.
Claire gaped at him. "He climbs roofs for fun. The first time I ever saw him, he came out of nowhere on a dirt bike and slammed into my dad's car. He fell off a ladder the same day as prom. He's never sitting somewhere safe, twiddling his thumbs unless he's... I don't know, figuring out how to get roller skates onto a live alligator."
"Hey... What do we do with this?" she asked, gesturing to the black metal box.
Her chair made a small scraping sound against the kitchen floor, and he was aware of her approach, but he didn't look up until she sat down on the edge of the coffee table in front of him.
"You knock that off, Dean!"
Kevin shook his head slightly to indicate that he wasn't catching her meaning.
... Outside, Dean made it all the way through the gate before he had to adjust his jeans.
The sun had already set, dinner was being cleared away, and Melody and Jaime had been sent upstairs for homework and picking up toys, respectively. Making a pass through the living room while Alfie was started on the dishes, Claire was startled by a loud knock at the door.
She'd seen Claire's anger enough times it didn't worry her in the least, but it was almost painful to try to recall any time she might have turned it on Alfie. Searching her memories, Melody couldn't think of any instances offhand. She remembered times when things had been tense, but Claire kept herself under control.
"How did Dad let you live on your own without a whole set of tools in the house? You even have an electric drill?"
"Okay, fine, but it's not about the ultrasound, it's about whether or not you pass out half way through your walk because your body is busy building a fucking human being." he snapped, "And aside from accidentally finding your g-spot - you're welcome, by the way - and causing the mess that caused this mess, I've contributed nothing. So, yeah... Can I please come with you, while some doctor, total stranger, shoves a magic sound-wand up your fun-shute to get the first ever images of my child?"
"Yeah... Yeah, okay. That's fine." Dean said, clearly trying to calm down, but still agitated.
Cas spoke quietly with Rachel as Dean walked shortly behind them, happily chatting on his phone with Sam, trading off recountings of their separate holidays, as Sam's family had flown out to see his in laws.
Suddenly it didn't matter so much. He got up from his bed and went downstairs where Claire and Alfie were sitting on the couch with the television running with commercials on mute, and Alfie was singing something repetitive, Crimson and Clover, Claire was rolling her eyes, telling him to 'shut it,' and his grin was growing ever wider.
"I was going to steal one of his guns." Claire said with the voice of a terrified child.
"No we don't." Margaret answered, leaving the room.
Dean tilted his head with a hint of suggestion, sliding his hands down Cas' body to grip his ass, "It'd be hot... It's kind of weird to go asking somebody to do something like that, poking holes in their body, I know, but, just think about it. It'll give you something to do while I start turning this-.. Well, from an outside perspective, I guess it looks like a jumble of bullshit, into a real half-sleeve, okay? You and the kids, and then it's done. Complete set. Like us."
"I will not wear shirts with snaps. I don't participate at rodeos." Cas groaned.
Dean continued to his office, as Alfie started to look over the panel, "You know, to be honest, I was hoping I'd get to play with the dog."
"He won't shut up. He's wheedling-"
There was a hint of a smirk to the corner of his mouth that let on that he was teasing before he answered, "I can take her in tomorrow while everything is quiet."
Cas watched the ball going back and forth as he listened to the questions get progressively harder. Dean would hint, but not by much, and when Xander couldn't answer one, he'd dial it back a bit.
"Yeah, but the bathroom has a lock, and-" Cas dropped to his knees to take Dean, already half hard, into his mouth, feeling fingers tangle in his hair as Dean slowly regained the ability to breathe, despite Cas' best efforts.
"It wouldn't be much fun for me at all if you guys just ignore each other the whole time." She said, her voice deepening with stifled moans. Dean shrugged one shoulder and went to work on Castiel's buttons, starting at the top.
"Where'd you hide it?" Dean asked, reaching below the small of Cas' back.
"That's not fair, my face is as gay as the rest of me... Cruelty through sarcasm, though, that's one of your worst... I don't know how you survived, what scraps of love kept you going, or where they came from, but, when things began coming to light in therapy, I remember thinking how much worse, how twisted you should have been, having lived with her. I never had the strength to ask you about that, I guess I shut it out and hoped you were some kind of miracle."
"Too bad. It's happening."
"And it doesn't bother you at all?"
"No, tell me if you're still mad first."
Cas rolled his eyes as he got in, "If a student heard that-"
"You should sneak out tonight, Kurt swiped some whiskey from his uncle, and we're gonna hang out at Nathan's house. His folks are out of town, and his brother's girlfriend is really hot."
"Gotta be at least thirteen of them, then. Unless there's twins. There's twins, right?" Lucas asked, following her back to the desk to find only Ellen, at which point he sobered immediately, "Yes? What can I help you with?"
"It's much like pound cake, the way it should be," Cas answered, "Though there's a hint of smoke in there I think you might find a way around that in the future."
"I don't really have time to set up a pulley system right now." Dean answered.
"I wouldn't. Not really, c'mon, you know that."
Alfie chuckled, "Bobby didn't drink."
"Grandpa?" Mike's voice came through the garage as he paced just outside the bay doors, until Dean, somewhere within, out of sight, responded, confirming his presence, "I don't have any homework today. I put my stuff away, and got the trash out and swept."
"Okay... Fine. You know her better than I do."
The man cleared his throat, straightening his posture, "My mistake. But yes, we offer a wide range of careers, so, if your girlfriend wants to tag along, learn to do a cut, color, perms, nails, waxing, or whatever, you guys could split the gas money, and both get an education. Also, the trainees need practice, so it's a good chance to grab a cheap haircut."
"When I was his age, I was retiring from gymnastics. What's your point? He's always been a little bulkier than you, and if he doesn't keep up with calorie input, he'll get chubby."
Melody shrugged, unaware of the authority figure passing by as she opened her mouth, "Well it's gonna stop when he squishes you into a pancake and glues you to the wall, and uses your guts to make a big smiley face on the floor."
"As long as you don't show up on a motorcycle, right?" Kevin asked, following Alfie into a dark room and hitting the light switch.
Cas gave a confused gesture, unsure of Dean's point, then it dawned on him, "Ben sits there."
In an attempt at the higher set of monkey bars, Melody had managed to get a few bars away from the ladder, and had missed her next grab, hanging by one hand as she called for Mike to help her down. Both men went silent as Cas seemed to be holding himself to the park bench, at the same time, ready to spring, until Mike had carefully set Melody on the ground.
"We will continue to run this school my way, and I strongly suggest you avoid bringing any more attention to yourself where Ben is concerned."
The man nodded, his actions still aggressive if not threatening, and Dean waited patiently as the guy gathered his wits and began to speak, strained by his attitude, "My wife brought in a white Ford Taurus the other day, you guys switched out the ignition coil, and set up a payment plan, right?"
The sound of machines started again almost immediately, and Alfie made a beeline outside, hoping neither of the girls would notice.
"Don't. I've got you."
Cas couldn't help but duck his head as Rabbi Jake continued to speak, even as the words began to lose sense. He hoped for those left affected, that the points made were uplifting. Things were beginning to blur, though, as they had done throughout the week it had taken to organize the memorial. Some things, however, things that Sam had been correct about, pierced the haze. Sam squeezing his shoulder, that was real. Jess passing him a travel pack of tissues from her purse, it was real. Kevin approaching him at a moment when he'd zoned out, asking if he needed to step out and get some air before the ride to the cemetery... It all added up. It kept him from moving so far out of focus that he couldn't find his way back.
Tired, but with nothing better to do, he made several attempts at a selfie of his mouth with the tip of his tongue stuck between his teeth toward one side, barely breaching his lips and sent the sideways photo to Margaret.
Claire shook her head, "You know damn well I'm the one who handles beatdowns around here. But what did you need? And why this early?"
He muttered to himself as he put the car in park, taking a few deep breaths to calm himself, "I'm gonna get murdered by a redneck... Yeah..."
"Do you trust me, or not?" Ivan demanded.
Gabe nodded, "Anything else?"
Alfie shrugged, "I said I was going to get her a Lexus for her baby shower, and she yelled at me, okay? But that's basically my nephew, so... Yeah."
Alfie didn't realize Dean had noticed the guilty looks, and had intended to mess with him, "What?"
"So... that's good news, right?"
Cyndi raised her hand, "Bahbye."
Dean looked closer at the handwriting on the paper in the dim porch light, "'How many guys' cupcakes...' Little shit... Okay, so they're both suspended... You know this is just sticking them in the same room to either continue the fight or make up and plan their next round of crap, right?"
"Unfortunately the car was badly damaged... I'm not sure my CDs are going to be in any shape to play... Maybe it's a good thing that one fell behind your dresser."
Cas took a deep breath, not having bothered to raise his eyes, "Congratulations... But a dowry of independence, especially of your own making, isn't the worst thing in the world. In your case, it's an achievement. I'm sure Mike will be happy enough to make up for the rest of your blood relatives, and by this time, no one will be able to say there were shotguns involved."
"Cas," Dean breathed, sitting up.
those up?” Dean asked.
And in heaven, Naomi received a strange report on her desk which she did a brief double-take before tossing it behind her on the floor with a heavy sigh and a mumbled, “Why am I surprised by anything Castiel does anymore?”
"Congrats, man," Sam smiled, slapping his brother on the shoulder.
? Dean thought as he and Cas arrived at the bathroom, setting down their things.
"Bitch," Dean glared.
"Cas, I want you to ride me."
"What?" Dean yelped, dropping a grocery bag on Sam's foot.
"Was it angel-radio?"
“Cas, can I open my eyes?”
"What does this image of a cat covered in text mean," the angel puzzled curiously, "and what does it have to do with babies?"
Castiel, meanwhile had not stopped playing footsie with Dean under the table.
"Could you repeat that?"
"My grace was burning as some side effect from the spell, and I couldn't stop it," Castiel explained, as Sam also sat down to join them. "I had to find a new vessel immediately or die."
“No more demons, either,” Castiel added. “Only humans can travel between.”
"Jack, what's wrong?" the younger Winchester asked with concern.
"Is it just me, or has Cas been—moodier—lately."
"Maybe another name that starts with ‘J’?" Dean suggested.
"What do we have against coffee mugs this morning?" she asked curiously, stepping over the debris.
"Yes," Mary smiled. "I'm not sure where you got these cooking skills, but they weren't from me."
"Oh, it's a little hat," he marveled.
sex?"
"Oh, hello," the nephilim waved happily. "You are up extra early today."
“I made it,” Jack explained, waving his hand, the door opening revealing a vast hole that seem to slope downward inside. “It’s a slide to Earth.”
Next was the sound of Dean's coffee mug hitting the floor.
, why would you do that?” Gabriel whined, “all of the good porn is on Earth.”
"Lady," Dean hissed in frustration. "Rowena ain't our friend."
"Of course I want our baby, Cas," the elder Winchester brother reassured. "I just have to make sure nothing bad is going to happen to you first."
“No, Sam, it’s fine.”
“Cas, you need to do the swap now,” Dean pleaded, “go back to your old self.”
Cas willed himself to turn his head, a tightness at this neck, his eyes finally coming into focus on the green numbers of an alarm clock.
"When did you get so tall, Jack?" the angel asked with a slight chuckle, his son now towering over his current form.
With eyes glowing from the effort, a final push freed the shoulders, the rest spilling out onto the bed.
"You're welcome," Cas replied gruffly, wrapping his arms around Dean as the hunter sighed deeply into his shirt.
"And once the blue innards were revealed," Garth's wife added, "everyone knew we were having boys!"
"Any angel senses tingling yet?" He asked with a playful smile.
"-when I woke up I thought that you were dead," the hunter continued, looking up with tears threatening at the edges of his eyes.
"One thing I don't get," Dean began. "How is it that old-you is still breathing?"
Dean was frozen in place, his mind racing, barely even registering all of the nice things Cas was saying about him, because after the first few words, he could only focus on one thing.
Castiel was still shaking as Dean gently touched the angel's round middle.
After getting out of the shower, a little while later, Dean briefly wondered where Sam was as he poured he and Cas a couple of fresh coffees in the kitchen.
"Great!" Garth replied, clapping his hands together, "I'll just run ahead and let the wife know to make a few extra plates and to actually cook the meat."
"So then, Rowena had the audacity to—"
"I'm so happy for you, man!"
The former King of Hell shot a look to Cas and Dean as he turned to exit up the bunker stairs.
"Oh," the younger Winchester replied, dumbfounded. "Um. Really?"
“This
“You hungry?” Sam asked, ushering Cas to the car.
"I was looking up baby names," Castiel said.
. Dean’s brain short-circuited.
Cas's eyes widened as it all came flooding back.
The corner of Castiel’s mouth crooked into a smile as he looked upon the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in his hand.
!” Sam could faintly be heard yelling in the background, wrestling the phone away from the former King of Hell.
—nothing but boxers and a white undershirt. Cas who he woke up to in his bed. In his bed
At that, the hunter squeezed Castiel tighter before looking directly into his brown eyes.
The freezer was stocked with breast-milk that Sam had fetched from a local Mom’s group that donated extra to those in need.
[Warning childbirth]
Dean finally broke from the shock and ran over to engulf his angel in his arms, holding him tight.
"Gender what?" Dean asked turning to Sam.
He was walking down the hallway just in time to hear really loud cursing in Enochian that could
“No—”
“Don’t do this to me,” Dean demanded, voice breaking, “you promised.”
“Well—” Cas began.
"I don't mean to interrupt you, Dean" Castiel said softly, looking up at the blushing man currently straddling him on the bed, the hunter’s hands shakily trying to tear open a condom wrapper that was being particularly difficult.
"Did you sense anything a few minutes ago?"
"Don't worry about it, kid," Dean said, giving Jack a soft pat on the shoulder before joining them at the kitchen table.
"Did Dean tell you to get me this?" He asked in awe, holding up the tiny bee costume.
"No."
“Balthazar?” Castiel said with surprise as the fellow angel hugged him.
"Crowley accused everyone of being a whore, though," Dean replied after a pause.
"Got it," Sam nodded. "Thanks, Cas."
"Oh, Cas," Jack piped up, "I have a question!"
But if he continued as he is now, he would die.
Dean watched as their savior walked over to the twitching form of the witch to finish the job with the familiar glow of a quick smiting. As soon as her life was extinguished, the spell faded completely.
In the background Dean rolled his eyes.
The young man nodded, seeing several emotions pass over his father’s face.
"Oh," Castiel responded thoughtfully. "Did I fail to mention that before?"
. Satan.”
“Oh, hey little bro—” Gabe greeted cautiously, looking from Castiel to Jack. “Nephew—good to see you again. Thanks for the jail-break by the way—”
“I promise to find at least one archangel to give you orders to follow, will that do?”
“Cas—” Dean felt like sobbing again. Cas chose this. Chose to give up everything in Heaven to come back to him.
Castiel listened with worry as he heard muffled sounds of shuffling, whispering, and clanking bottles through the phone as Sam tried and failed to get Dean to wake up.
"Sam was helping me with my cell phone," Castiel explained, "and I believe he may have inadvertently altered some of my settings."
Across the bunker table, Mary looked up from glancing at her phone and examined the board.
"Our baby is male," the angel answered as Dean practically tackled him with hugs and kisses, "I sensed it with certainty for the first time just a few hours ago."
"Is that alright, Dean?" Castiel asked, tears threatening at the edges of his eyes.
The young man nodded slowly, eyes glowing brighter.
"Cas," Dean let out a shaky breath that he didn't realize he had been holding in. "What happened to you?"
They both stood side-by-side, staring at Castiel's previous form which lay quietly on the bed before them. The rest of the room was mostly bare—it being one of the several unclaimed bedrooms in the bunker.
“Country roads, take me home—” Lucifer sang off key, sitting on the porch, cornfield swaying in the wind, strumming a banjo he conjured from nowhere. “Come on guys sing along—”
As Dean finished sending the text, he clicked off the table lamp and pulled the angel into an even closer spooning position.
Dean felt the heat rise in his cheeks, opening and closing his mouth a few times like a dying fish unable to get any words out, before quickly closing the shower curtain and retreating back to the bedroom.
"Cas, where's Mary, I thought she'd come with you?" Jody asked, shuffling around the kitchen, pulling some fresh baked cookies from the oven.
Cas was watching him. Cas was always watching him.
"Dean," Cas began slowly, walking into the bedroom still naked and dripping wet, towel in hand, to find the hunter wildly pacing back and forth, "What's the matter? You look like you just saw a ghost."
Castiel gasped at the same moment as several bulbs burst above them in unison sending sparks of light raining down. The entire bunker went dark for a few seconds before there was a grinding noise and a loud hum as the red emergency lighting kicked in.
"Cas," Dean silenced his angel's nervous rambling with a kiss. "I get it."
“Hello!” Jack waved to everyone, smiling widely.
"So you can see why it's not really a good time for me to come out to the cabin," she continued, choosing to completely ignore Bobby's comment.
“So, Cas,” Sam asked slowly, “I hope you don’t mind me asking—you’re human now?”
“Stardust, apparently,” Crowley replied.
"Babe," Dean called out, shaking the angel's shoulder with concern.
Cas responded by pulling the blanket over his head and groaning.
The Winchesters blinked rapidly as the new woman approached the sigil. She was barefoot, wearing only a hospital gown that was completely open in the back. She tilted her head as she studied the circle and frowned.
He reached up to investigate the tingling at this throat, his fingers finding a thick bandage carefully taped there.
Cas stirred slightly and blinked in the darkness. Something was off. The empty didn't feel like this the last time. Nevermind that he was aware and having conscious thoughts regarding his current situation.
“It won’t be long now,” Castiel panted, reaching down to check his progress, “I should be able to start pushing soon.” At some point the angel had changed clothes and was now wearing only a soft oversized shirt and nothing else.
bacon, Sam’s always buying the healthy crap when he goes on grocery runs.”
"Come on, Cas," Dean replied, throwing his head back and gripping the angel's hips tighter, "Come on."
“What if demons kill each other in Hell? There’s no more Empty, where do they go?” Sam questioned further.
Cas looked around. He was in the bunker, and in Dean's bedroom at that, his bloodied trenchcoat draped carefully over a nearby chair.
“—not this dream again—I can’t watch you get taken again—”
Dean watched on in horror as the gentle blue glow above them was engulfed in its entirety by the infinite blackness and pulled backwards towards The Empty.
"Yeah, I had trouble sleeping for some reason," Sam replied. "I already finished my morning run and made extra eggs if you'd like some."
The sound of Billie's pounding at the door mixed with the pounding of Dean's own heartbeat in his head. He could no longer tell the two apart as the void opened behind them, dark ooze gathering, preparing to strike.
“That means—” Castiel narrowed his eyes in thought.
“I’m still dreaming aren’t I?” Dean chuckled hollowly.
“He prayed to you, Cas, more than he prayed to me,” Jack continued. “You couldn’t hear it because you were in The Empty. But I could hear it. I could hear it
Castiel stopped mid-chew, and Dean realized he had just up and blurted it out.
Dean looked up at the beautiful sight and grinned mischievously before swallowing Cas whole without any warning. He was 99.99% sure Castiel had never had someone do this for him.
"Why Tiberius?"
Castiel immediately startled awake, quickly scooting over to peer over the edge of the bed.
"Where is this warehouse supposed to be again?" Dean asked, bringing Baby to a stop at another light.
Cas squeezed Dean's shoulder gently as he swallowed hard.
“Of course not. After I finished fixing the universe, I set everything to—I guess you could say—autopilot. Then I separated that which you would consider God from myself. But I knew it was too dangerous to leave in one place. So I split the energy into six different pieces and scattered them all to the far corners of the universe. My grace here was the last part.” Jack smiled widely, super proud of himself and his explanation. “I got the idea from a movie I saw.”
"Yes," Castiel chuckled slightly, "that would have been quite impossible in my male vessel."
"In private," the younger Winchester clarified.
“Answer me one thing, Jack,
BACK SOON
Cas popped out from the covers at that, looking up at Dean quizzically, tilting his head.
Dean nearly tripped over his own legs several times on the way down the hall, but Castiel managed to successfully wrangle the inebriated Winchester to his bedroom.
Every chance encounter, every random woman he went home with, every back alley liaison—as soon as things got heated, without fail, he would have a condom whipped out and ready to go. And if he wasn't packing, well—sex without protection was always a no-go.
Castiel's eyes scanned the room briefly in contemplation before offering, "Did you maybe leave the stove on?"
"I read that humans like to name their children with a theme or pattern," Castiel continued, "so I was thinking of a name that would fit with Jack."
. And also, that he would be seeing Dean again soon.
tangled with his legs. And there was a warm hand at his waist.
?” Dean asked incredulously.
“Aye, my Fergus wore that when he was a wee babe, see, I wasn’t such a terrible mother after all,” Rowena explained. “I genuinely hope for the best for you Winchesters and your little one, despite what you may believe.”
"Not a girl," Castiel retorted.
The whole family was seated around the bunker’s map table, listening with rapt attention as Jack insisted on relaying to them all the entire plot of the series final of
"Sam, me and Cas have been together for over a month."
phone. There was no answer on all three, even after several attempts.
“Please,” Jack asked sincerely, placing a hand on the archangel’s shoulder. “Heaven needs you.”
"Dude," Dean gaped. "When was this?"
"I'm really not the best person to ask," Mary replied, looking across the table to Sam for help. "I don't understand Book-face."
was preggers, well, I just had to come and pay my respects."
"This still alright?" the Winchester asked.
“Please stay—”
—to take him to bed and spoon with him last night. Sure.
Dean moved Jack's hands away from his ears as he walked to the other side of the kitchen to get a plate.
"Why did I open the door without checking first?" Jody scolded herself. "How did you even get this address?"
Dean, wide-eyed, stuffed the last piece of bacon in his mouth so that he couldn’t blurt out anything else embarrassing and then got up from his chair and wrapped his arms around Cas who almost choked on his eggs.
Dean smiled, the nightmare finally fading from memory.
"May we play again?" Jack asked hopefully as Mary's cell began to ring.
“Will I see you again, before that?”
Dean shrugged, taking another drink of beer.
Sam, having studied up on his sign language quite a bit recently, replied.
“Cas!”
Moments later Castiel let his wings fall away as the tiny babe’s green eyes fluttered open, a piercing cry filling the room.
"Should?" Dean nearly shouted, starting to get a bit hysterical. "I'm not losing you again, especially not because of something I did to you!"
That is, uh, until Castiel came along.
They never knew her name—the woman from the hospital—but it seemed only right that they give her body a hunter’s farewell.
“Thank you, Rowena,” Castiel nodded with a look of pleasant surprise.
"It's really not that much different than the last time I inhabited a female vessel."
he would keep choosing.
your favorite.”
Dean could just make out Eileen’s agitated voice saying, “Stop shaking the car you two! I’m trying to drive!”
"I thought—" Jody started and then stopped. "I have so many questions right now."
“What is it?” Claire asked.
"I—" Castiel paused a moment in reflection. "I was thinking of Jimmy."
“Have you seen Hell? It’s terrible!”
"Thank you, Dean," Castiel said appreciatively, before noticing a strange expression cross the hunter's face. "What's wrong?"
Castiel was already panting and flushed.
"Then she thought I was Cas's brother and asked for my opinion."
Then he watched Castiel slowly raise his eyebrows and give him a
“I wasn’t sure if you wanted to wait until we got back to Dean to tell us everything—”
“Jack can stay with me, his body doesn’t need the same amount of sleep as you do,” Castiel added, facing Dean. “Go. To. Sleep.”
to, but didn’t.
, again?” Castiel asked, finally standing up now.
"I think I'd like that," Castiel smiled.
"Oh, right," the Winchester mumbled, snaking a hand in-between them where they connected to rub circles around just the right spot—
"Is this as weird for you as it is for me?" Dean asked as a hoodie-clad and sock-footed Castiel entered the bedroom.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, tentatively touching Dean’s shoulder where his hand-print once rested.
"That's Cas," the nephilim replied as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Once he was out of sight the Winchesters shared a look.
“Yes, the dear boy popped down to Hell, gave a big speech to all us demons turned out from The Empty about how we should make better choices this time around.”
again soon—on Earth.”
“Sam?” Dean asked again, skeptically.
—” Raphael shouted at Castiel, immediately brandishing an angel blade.
Mary was nodding off, and Sam was discretely texting Eileen—but Dean appeared to be genuinely invested in the tale.
"I had this brilliant idea," the hunter-werewolf sat his drink down, a large grin on his face. "We got one of the cows from the farm and a tub of blue food coloring which we fed to old Bessie. Then we had the pack tear into her during the party—we all really got into it."
“You’ll return here, and this—" Jack motioned to the grace, "—
"Dean, you want to name our baby after a fictional character?"
"Morning, Cas," Dean grinned in response.
Then Cas—who Sam had never seen without multiple layers of clothing—strolled right into the kitchen this morning in barely any clothes like it was nothing, asking for a plate of breakfast and coffee for Dean.

“Is Dean alright?” Cas interrupted with concern,  “I tried his cell and—”
"We were," Sam responded, quirking an eyebrow. "But a car accident had the main road tied up. We decided just to come back home for now."
"Jerk."
"Wait, what's going on?" Dean asked no one in particular.
"Hello!" Jack greeted warmly.
will be waiting for you.”
"Same time tomorrow, then?" Dean waggled his eyebrows.
“Okay,” the hunter swallowed hard, taking the angels hand and squeezing it tight. “Okay.”

"I find—oh that feels nice—that I miss my trench coat."
at a ridiculously high volume.
"It's not just him, all of you now have my custom
"Earth to Dean," Sam called out from across the huge bunker map-table.
The angel rolled his eyes and locked up the truck.
"And of course I come bearing gifts for your wee little one," Rowena explained, dangling a tiny wrapped package.
Sandwich devoured, Cas took to looking out of the window and just marveling at the fact that he was alive. And, that he was human.
Dean paused and looked up from what he was doing, still in awe that this was Cas in his bedroom.
"What the crap is so important at this hour, Sammy?"
"Cas," the hunter groaned at length as he followed a few thrusts later, the angel collapsing on top of him, pressing breasts to chest.
Dean glanced up in the rear view mirror as he put Baby in reverse. The brown eyes of the lady-Cas stared back at him, sat next to the former body of the angel—leaned gently across the backseat.
?” Dean balked at the voice he’d not heard in years, suddenly sitting up straight in the bed.
“I hate everything.”
“Dean! Dean!” Jack shouted through the shut bedroom door, “Cas asked for you.”
The slide down from heaven was surprisingly much like a literal playground slide.
"I'm an angel, Dean," Castiel replied, voice still tinged with shock. "I should survive birthing a nephilim, especially one conceived out of such weak grace."
, to our
“He did kind of sacrifice himself for us, that one time, I mean, I figured we should maybe hear him out a little. Maybe?”
Sure enough, after a long decent, Castiel popped out at Heaven’s playground entrance on Earth, nearly taking out a small child in the process, earning him an angry stare from who was presumably the child’s mother.
“No more angels on earth,” Sam repeated in awe.
“How—”
Dean rolled his eyes.
Wait. Those are
“Dean, you were
"Who the fuck are you, lady?" Dean demanded.
He blinked awake on the ground of a white void that was very much the opposite of what he would expect from The Empty. Glancing around, Castiel could see the tangled legs of his long-dead brothers and sisters all grumbling awake and righting themselves in equal confusion and shock.
“Well speak of the son-of-the-Devil—” Crowley marveled.
Castiel shifted in his seat, finding that he could no longer get comfortable due to the baby’s movements which had been far more active.
“What is it?”
. Did Cas hear any of that? And he prayed to Jack. But that turned more into desperate screaming into the void in the end. Right as he gave up on prayer. Gave into despair. Gave into drink. Lost hope—
"I must say the clothing of that era was far more complex and constricting," the angel said with a far away smile. "I must thank you again for these comfortable clothes, Mary."
"I'll believe that, when I see it," Jody rolled her eyes.
"How'd that go?" Sam asked.
“Eat some eggs, Cas,” Dean managed, mouth full of bacon. “You’re human, you gotta eat.”
“Hello, Sam.”
Sam and Mary exchanged a solemn look before rushing over to tend to the wailing newborn.
Castiel waited patiently, before waddling over and taking his designated spot next to Dean.
"I believe this is game," Jack grinned as he slotted in another token that clinked into place.
"I'm going to be a big brother!" Jack exclaimed happily.
The hunter hissed, sitting up in the floor, leaning against the bedside table and rubbing at the back of his head, checking for blood. Now his head hurt for two completely different reasons.
But the angel was suddenly silent.
“Yes, I had no choice over who was resurrected. Every angel and demon who ever died has been returned to Heaven and Hell.”
Elsewhere Naomi yelped as Lucifer landed right on top of her, several corn stalks flying into the air—the off-key banjo music increasing in tempo.
At that Castiel felt of his own sleeve and found it empty.
“Oh! Oh!” The angel exclaimed, as the baby started fully crowning, and a soft light started to glow.
It was safe to say that Dean had finally remembered that important thing that he had forgotten—and had repeatedly kept forgetting.
"Have—have you and Cas been practicing—
“Cas, I’ll be, um, I’ll be right back,” Dean said, shuffling towards the door.
“Jack, you said you sealed Heaven.”
Castiel tilted his head, pondering carefully for a moment before responding.
The hunter stared with a mix of shock and relief as the man who was sometimes more human than angel these days continued to soap himself.
The elder Winchester brother rubbed sleep from his eyes as he entered the library, robe flowing behind him.
Dean grunted, leaning over the best he could with Castiel weighing down halfway on top of him. “It’s Sam. We’ve barely heard anything out of him over the last week. I need to answer it.”
, Cas. I miss them too—Dean and Sam. I want to see you
The younger Winchester stayed for a moment, before nodding in acceptance and heading off down the hallway to retire for the evening.
"Cas!" Dean shouted as blood now poured from the former angel's neck, "No!"
Dean downed the last of the water. “The kid came through after all.” He stared at the empty glass. He prayed every night for so long. Prayed to Cas. Bared his whole heart. Prayed so much.
“Yes, Dean,” he responded after a few moments. “This is a good dream.”
"Good to see you again, Jack!" Jody replied, giving him a brief hug, before descending the stairs. "I was passing through and I thought I'd stop in and see you boys, it's been a long—"
“Cas,” Dean sniffled, “he has my eyes.”
Sam leaned over to Castiel. "The other one is named Sam."
The hunter instinctively closed his eyes, expecting that cool rush of healing grace, but only feeling a warm, slightly rough hand.
Castiel nodded in agreement.
After a moment she popped up with a huff—hair now sticking up comically in several different directions. As Naomi attempted to navigate out of the maze of corn, she became increasingly aware of some very annoying music grating at her ears—and it was only getting louder.
Jack walked into the kitchen to find Sam already sitting at the table, reading a book.
Sam had thought—
“Yes, Dean,” the younger Winchester responded, exasperated, finally having control of the cell phone again.
“Yes,” Castiel explained with exasperation. “Gabriel apparently ‘knows a guy’.”
Sitting at the map table was a heavily-pregnant, dark-haired woman that Jody had never seen before, and she was currently eating honey directly out of a large glass jar.
The mood of the room suddenly shifted as Dean nodded.
"One of the women in the group replied with an angry face," Castiel said, shoving the phone over into Sam's space. "What about this photo could possibly illicit such anger?"
“Sam, did you seriously give Crowley a ride
"Dean," Castiel called out, panic rising in his voice. "Something's wrong."
"Not like that you aren't," the hunter gestured vaguely to the angel's midsection which had begun to show.
"Yes, really. I didn't think we needed to issue an officially notarized statement when we started banging."
”Jack, what are you doing up?”
It was quite a dilemma. Sam and Dean are in mortal danger. Castiel could not return to his current body, therefore he must find a new one. But that would require possessing a human, and he had told himself that after what happened to Jimmy Novak and his family that he would never put another human through that again, even at the cost of his own life.
Dean then turned his attention to the soft glow from the bathroom door, crawling out of bed to investigate the sounds of a running shower.
“Cas?” Dean managed to choke out, staring dumbly and blinking rapidly.
"And I won't ever let you die like that," Cas murmured against his lips, "I promise you, Dean Winchester, that for as long as I live I will be by your side. And when it is finally your time and you pass beyond the veil, I will return to heaven and watch over your soul for all eternity."
"Know what?"
"And I told her I was unmarried."
"So what made you suggest
It took a few moments to figure out how to respond to that question appropriately.
”Not at all,” Mary laughed. “Not at all.”
"Hi, Donna," the angel managed as the air was squeezed from him.
"There was so much more, Cas, it seemed so real," Dean sobbed into the man's wet shoulder, beads of water still dripping from his hair, "There was Sam and Jack and, and Chuck-he, he Thanos-snapped everyone we cared about to death. But then Jack pulled a Tony Stark and brought everyone back-well almost everyone-you were still dead. Then like a week later a rusty nail killed me on a routine vamp hunt with Sam. Then Sam got married to some chick, oh man, I don't even know-"
“I could go with you.”
Jack shrugged but complied and started counting kitchen tiles, humming to himself softly.
The elder nephilim’s eyes glowed a bright yellow as energy passed to the struggling Castiel where their hands touched.
"Well, you coulda knocked," Dean exclaimed, throwing up his hands.
"Claire, it's beautiful," Castiel said sincerely, holding up the baby-sized trench coat so the rest could see. "Thank you."
In the back, several shouts interrupted the reunion of the two as another angel tore through the crowd.
After a minute of collecting himself and dusting off the playground dirt, the former angel spotted a man on a distant bench playing a loud game on his cell instead of paying attention to his screaming child and was kind enough to let a stranger borrow his phone for what should have been a quick call.
Jack and his three dads were having a bit of a group hug sort of situation going on.
again.
With a yawn, the hunter blinked awake to find the angel next to him scrolling through Facebook on maximum brightness.
"Hm," Dean pondered for a moment before grinning widely, "only if we can give him the middle name Tiberius."
Dean looked on curiously.
“Love you too.”
“And that’s why you’re—”
Castiel shifted again, what remained of his broken wings suddenly manifested onto this plane, wrapping a cocoon of safety around him, blocking too much of the light from hitting Dean.
The mangled unopened wrapper was soon forgotten on the floor.
"Shush—shush," Dean comforted, wrapping his arms around the angel, "Cas—Cas, it was just a nightmare, you're alright. Our baby's alright. He's still right here."
"Jody," Castiel interrupted, "since you are here, I'd like to go ahead and invite you to my baby shower. All of you, Claire, the girls—and Donna if you could let her know too."
"I—I don't think so, since they stopped trying to bother with Jack long ago," Castiel replied, snuggling deeper into Dean's arms. "Honestly, the other angels should be mostly concerned with just keeping heaving running right now and not with our current activities."
“Mom, Sam, take care of the baby—Jack, you’re with me!”
“Ah!” the angel panted, falling forward on his elbows, wings flexing further inward as the yellow light of the nephilim swirled around the small newborn, before finally settling and fading into the skin.
"As long as he is with us, no matter appearance, I am happy," Jack replied thoughtfully.
"Promise me."
"Yes! Did I fucking stutter?"
"So, Cas," Sam began, "first day in a new body, what's it like?"
Cas wasn’t sure what to expect when they got back to the bunker, but it wasn’t this.
"That reminds me," Sam interrupted, turning to the angel. "How should we refer to you while in this body?"
Dean buried his face in his elbow as the room glowed brighter.
"Yes, Jack?" Castiel responded as he filled his mug with coffee.
"He did," Mary admitted.
"Please don't feel guilty, Dean," the angel said, turning to meet his gaze. "I feel regret about many things, but not this."
Castiel simply nodded in fascination.
Castiel put down the fry he was nibbling on and contemplated the question.
"Dean, you never mentioned this to her?" Sam asked incredulously, gesturing to their guest.
"Bobby, wait," Mary replied, glancing at her cell to see that he disconnected.
"They are good—really good," Jody replied, still staring at the angel. "How far along is—"
There was a long pause as the Winchester seemed to be working up the nerve to say something further.
as a name, Cas?"
"Uh-uh, Sammy," the elder Winchester chided, "Prego-angel gets shotgun."
"It's not just you."
Garth clapped a hand onto the angel's shoulder.
As they pulled out in the road, Sam shuffled around in the passenger seat trying to get his cell out of his pocket and started dialing.
"You know what, Dean," the angel decided a few minutes later, "I think I'd like you to take me shopping after all."
"He's asking if you are expecting, Cas." Sam explained.
Dean found himself thrown by every word out of the mouth of this woman-shaped Castiel.
"Really," Sam added, nodding furiously, "she's not."
Dean blinked rapidly.
With another hard push, the angel gasped, birthing the head into his waiting hand.
Castiel closed his eyes in concentration, moving a hand between his legs, waiting for another pressure wave to help birth the rest of the head.
“Oh,” Jack said, with a complete lack of concern in his voice, “that reminds me—”
Cas cried out as the last drops of his grace were ripped painfully from him by the force of the retreating darkness. The Empty had finally claimed him, but only that small part of him it was entitled to.
"That bitch rescinded the offer!" the woman howled, suddenly making the glow of the spell surrounding the three brighter.
The nephilim stared at the hunter for a moment, as if he were on a mission.
Jack nodded happily, getting up from the table.
the state of his brother’s liver right now.
"Angels are genderless, but having spent these past several years in a male body, I have begun to think of myself as male. So, if you wouldn't mind, please continue to refer to me as you normally would."
"Is this going to kill you?" Dean managed to choke out finally, his voice shaking.
“Huh? Oh, this, don’t worry, it’s
At that, Dean surged forward, enveloping his lover with a kiss.
"Should I start calling you
"You may recall Ishim mentioned that I had a different vessel back then," Castiel continued. "She was a lovely and devout woman. I did not stay with her for long, just the duration of the mission. Unlike Jimmy, my presence did not upend her entire life."
Castiel tilted his head in confusion, "I'm coming with you of course."
Dean growled at her, "Whatever it is you are doing to him, you better stop it right now, or I swear there won't be anything left of you after I-"
“But—” Castiel responded, looking increasingly alarmed as he spotted Raphael in the crowd.
“I—” Jack paused for a moment in thought. “There is still important work for me to do here. More pieces of Heaven and Hell to fix, more laws of the universe to put into place. But then,
Jody blinked rapidly, turning to Jack. "Who's that?"
"Not that I can recall," Sam responded, eyebrows shooting up slightly.
Sam couldn’t help but laugh fondly at Jack’s comment.
—and click on the lamp and stare at the clock. 10:47 AM. That was earlier than he usually managed to wake up after a bender. But that was his life now—
“Dean—”
looked.
Dean shifted on his bed and stared at the clock in anticipation.
"You know, Cas," Dean offered, "if you need more clothes, I'll take you shopping."
“I’ll be right back,” the once angel promised.
"I felt something a few minutes ago, but I can't identify it," Jack replied. "I was hoping Cas could help."
"Dean, I'm still not sensing anything usual," Castiel said, looking up at the warehouse skeptically, "which may mean nothing or—"
Dean turned in his sleep, snuggling up closer to Castiel, but found a soft glow assaulting his closed eyelids.
The angel frowned with concern, closing the distance to put a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder, rubbing gentle circles, as the man stared at the floor and tried to gather his thoughts.
Just this once he would obey. Cas stayed put and let sleep take him.
Perhaps he should start with that.
Sam flipped another page in his book and took in another mouthful of egg.
"I'd like that," the angel replied, as the two hurriedly stripped away their few remaining pieces of clothing.
“You have restored us, oh God, what are your orders?” a random angel asked.
Dean nodded in response, then glanced back at Cas in the rear-view mirror.
“What’s on your mind?” She asked.
“It’s been
The angel scrunched his face slightly in concentration, then shook his head 'no.'
"Um, Dean?" Sam began slowly, "I need to ask you something important—"
—Castiel’s eyes looking into his very soul with patient concern and wild bed hair wearing—
"Cas," Eileen signed and spoke at the same time, "it's your day, you should decide."
Cas was sat on the other end of the sofa, an equally large stacks of books at his feet, intensely scanning the pages for any instances of documented cases of a nephilim born of an angel. So far, all of the known cases were specific to an angel impregnating a human and not the other way around. Sometimes the humans lived and sometimes they died, depending on the relative power of the angel involved.
