Dean snorts, then buries her head further into Cas’s hair to try and suppress her laughter, but ultimately dissolves into giggles. Cas looks up at her, eyes twinkling with mirth. “I love you so much,” Dean tells her.
Dean nods. Jack loves his driving lessons more than anything else, and Dean loves teaching him. She approaches it gently, making sure he feels secure and not stressed out. She did the same when she taught Sam and Cas how to drive, since her own experience with learning how to drive was less than ideal, to say the least. “Do you think it snowed overnight?” she asks, moving her thoughts away from her childhood. It was snowing when they got home yesterday after taking Jack to see the Christmas lights in the nearby town, and it didn’t seem like it was going to stop anytime soon. “I was thinking we could take Jack out and make snow angels, he was talking about it the other day.”
“No.” Cas reaches up to cover Dean’s eyes again, but she catches her hand before she can and holds it against her cheek instead. Cas rubs her thumb against Dean’s cheekbone absently. “What were you thinking about?” she asks.
He also told her that Billie -- who he also resurrected -- had been very upset over the disregard for the permanence of death, but he promised her that after that, he wouldn’t be interfering with the natural order, since he’d be releasing Amara and Chuck’s god powers. He ended up just giving his powers to Amara, but since she’s pretty chill and just wants to hang out in Norway where she can sit in a hot tub and be surrounded by snow at the same time, they let her go. She came to the wedding, which was nice, and she’s appeared in the bunker a few times since then to check in and steal food from their cabinets, but she assures them she has no interest in meddling in people's lives.. She mentioned something about living with Billie too, before, and Dean isn’t sure what that’s about, but she has suspicions.
Dean grins and lifts the former angel’s hand off her face, pressing a kiss to her palm, then pulls her close. Cas nuzzles into her, tucking her head under Dean’s chin and sliding her leg in between Dean’s, tangling their feet. “Good morning,” she murmurs.
hope for it. Sometimes at night, she’ll sit and think about the future. She’ll wonder if a few years down the line, they’ll be able to leave. She fantasizes about owning a house, living with Cas and Jack in a little white house with Sam and Eileen just down the street; about having a real job, buying things with real money and not hacked unlimited credit cards, getting married.
Cas tilts her face up to look at her and brushes the back of her knuckles against the hunter’s face. Dean looks down into her tired, sky blue eyes and covers her hand with one of her own, then bends down to kiss her gently. “I don’t know if it snowed,” the brunette murmurs against her wife’s lips, “But I hope it did. I’ve never made a snow angel before.”
Once Cas is dressed, she crawls back onto the bed and hovers over Dean, gently touching her face. The two of them look at each other for a while, just taking in their appearances. Cas is counting the freckles across Dean’s cheeks -- she can tell just by the way her eyes dart back and forth -- and Dean is looking at the subtle crowsfeet beside Cas’s eyes, wondering what she’ll look like as she gets older, how she’ll look with grey hairs at her temples. She smiles gently, thinking about the two of them in ten years, all creaky and grumpy, but happy.
Cas nods and gets up off the bed, and Dean watches her move around the room, pulling on her pajamas -- a red and black plaid set that is exactly the same as the set Dean wears. Jack insisted on the five of them wearing matching pajamas on Christmas, and none of them could say no to him, so he and Sam went out and bought them and she spent two hours embroidering everyone’s initials onto them, then wrapped them up in paper and ribbon so they could open them on Christmas Eve and watch a movie before they went to bed.
Dean loves asking about his lessons. She loves seeing him light up when he talks about his favorite subjects, the things he’s learned. She loves how excited he gets when she tosses Baby’s keys to him, and the way he scrambles into the driver’s seat. She loves the way he leans into her when she kisses his forehead, and the way he curls into her side when he’s tired. She loves him. Loves him like he was her own.
They pull away and relax again, Cas tucking her head back under Dean’s chin and the blonde holding her close, dragging her fingertips up and down the former angel’s naked back. Inwardly, Dean wishes they could just stay like this -- in bed, warm and cozy, without having to worry about anything except missing breakfast. She hates worrying. She knows Cas is more than capable -- even though since becoming human, her senses have increased in sensitivity, causing her to react harshly to everyday inconveniences, like papercuts and slightly too loud noises -- but she can’t help the jump of her heart into her throat when her spouse is in danger. Not that it didn’t exist
Jack is doing well as just a normal kid, though. They all take turns homeschooling him, each of them have their own subject and try to avoid overlap, but sometimes it’s inevitable. Sam had made it clear that he should learn standard school subjects on top of the hunting stuff, so she takes on most of those: simple math and science, reading and writing, stuff like that. Cas teaches history, since she’s got the most knowledge on that. Dean does all the hunting skills, so she teaches him lore and stuff on top of teaching him how to use and care for different weapons. And Eileen has been teaching all of them sign language.
“It’s all of our first real Christmas,” Cas replies, pinching Dean’s cheek, making her puller her head away
“He’s doing good,” she answers, “He’s a better shot now, but he still needs work on his hand-to-hand and knife skills. He’s doing well with lore though, he likes reading. And he doesn’t write his ‘K’s backwards anymore.”
Everyone started shouting over each other at that, louder and louder, until they were all silenced by a loud whistle from the doorway. Everyone stopped and turned to see Mary Winchester standing there, her fingers in her mouth.
Dean waved vaguely at Cas. “Planning a fun night with your little orgasm weed there, Hotwings?” He cringed a little inside. He hadn’t meant to be quite so blunt.
“Yeah, but that’s kind of a visceral reaction to have in front of people, when you’re not expecting it.”
Castiel saw the creation of the paradise Jack had shown him when Kelly had taken his hand so long ago.
As Jack spoke, Castiel could feel his hope swelling within him. He could be human, truly human. He could stay with Dean, live a life, a
Maybe it wouldn’t have happened if Sam had been along, but then again, that was probably for the best.
“Can I smell?” Jack piped up. Without waiting for an answer, he bent forward and took a sniff. “That smells really nice,” he said. “I like it. I hope your spell works, Sam,” he said, before turning on his heel and heading towards the kitchen.
Eileen called. She had a case. Sam left without Castiel, although he tried to get him to come along. Castiel didn’t want to hunt.
Dean peered at Cas, blinking, trying to understand. His chest hurt, his head felt worse. This felt like one of those moments in life that everything kind of hinged on, and it was so hard to know what it was that he needed, and then just fucking say it. He was terrified.
Dean strode over to the table and picked up the baggie. “So what’s this stuff do?” He opened it and sniffed, then pulled a face, unimpressed. The smell must have reached Cas though, because his eyes widened and his hand flexed by his side. The angel made a small noise in his throat. Dean shrugged and handed the bag to Cas, who immediately buried his nose in the opening.
The first thing he did, about a week after Minnesota, was simply to stand up from the chair he was sitting on in the library, and stretch. As soon as Dean looked up from the book he was looking at, Cas lowered his arms and stated to the room in general, that he was tired, and thought he might go to bed. Sam wished him goodnight without really looking up, but Dean was still watching him as he fished around in his pocket for a moment.
Cas wasn’t exactly sure how to react. He wasn’t exactly angry. More like irritated, he figured. And it wasn’t like human drugs, where he couldn’t function or react to danger, or even develop a dependency. He was mostly just embarrassed. He sighed.
“In the mountains, it’s good to have a little fat in your booze.” She turned and went into the kitchen.
When Cas was finished, he just set his plate down, and gazed at Dean with a glazed look in his eyes. “That was soooo good, Dean,” he said.
He was something other, and his hands could kill as easily as they could heal. It terrified Dean, but in a way that sent tingles down his spine, sent heat through his veins.
He’d been full of energy when he left Kansas, well fed, and rested as though he’d slept for weeks. Or months. As it happened, he’d been gone just over three months, as he discovered once he’d turned on the radio in the truck.
Cas, of course, finished with the werewolves, and rushed to Dean’s side immediately. Dean, slightly stunned from the ghost passing through him (plus Cas’ badass fucking moves) meant that he wasn’t quite able to stop Cas from grabbing his face and looking into his eyes. “Are you okay, Dean?” the angel asked, anxiously.
“Who’s it from?” Sam asked as he tried to fit all the salad fixings into the fridge around Dean’s beer.
let his hands rest on both of Dean’s ass cheeks, his fingers pressing in and his thumbs brushing impossibly close to his hole.
It wasn’t until he let out a huge moan that Sam realized what was going on. His eyes snapped from Cas to Dean, and when Dean finally couldn’t hold in the laughter any longer, and burst out laughing, Sam snapped.
Mary laughed. “I made these for a Christmas party once. I knew your father was coming and I wanted to ask him out. I was hoping it would stiffen my nerves. Just think, if it weren’t for these, you boys might not even be here. In the end, it’s the things you don’t try that you end up regretting, even more than your failures.” She sighed happily and looked at everyone sitting together, sipping their drinks. “It sure is nice, here in this cozy place, being surrounded by family. We don’t have enough times like this.”
His decision made, Castiel wasted no time. He grabbed another change of clothing from Dean’s room along with a pair of sneakers he had never seen Dean wear, threw a few snacks in his bag as well, helped himself to a knife and an angel blade from the armory, then got in his truck and left.
his form. He knew that he could exist on Earth that way, but he’d never be able to be as close to people as he had been in the last few years.
It was true. They hadn’t had much time off lately. Sam had been thinking something a little more tropical, rather than Colorado in February. But free lodging? He’d take it.
That didn’t make even the minutest amount of sense, but Castiel wasn’t about to argue, so he got up and started unbuttoning his shirt, taking note of Dean’s wide eyes and the flush of his cheeks as he undid each button. When he tossed the shirt aside, Dean licked his lips. His eyes ran up and down Castiel’s body, and he could definitely feel the heat of it warming his skin. He rolled his shoulders experimentally, and Dean let out a soft groan.
“May I?” Castiel asked, and Dean nodded, so Cas began wiping Dean’s face and neck with the cloth. “We have to bring your core body temperature down,” Castiel fibbed.
Sam turned red. “I was… I was… just getting it for Mom.” He spun on his heel and departed into his own room.
Cas’ hand left Dean’s ass and when he felt a finger press to his lips, he was disappointed for a moment, but when Cas said “Wet it, please,” he eagerly opened his mouth and sucked him in, slurping his finger and swirling his tongue around the digit.
“I’m so sorry,” Cas stammered, backing towards the door to his own room. “I ruined it for you, I had no idea.”
When everyone arrived, he directed Cas to sit on the end where the blanket was. Sam took the other end, with Jack in the middle, and Dean took the armchair and started the movie.
It didn’t take long. It was only a few, luckily, and they were pretty feral, so Dean didn’t have to feel so bad about ganking them. Cas had gotten one with an angel blade, which, if he was honest, kind of impressed Dean since they were definitely more suited to stabbing than slashing. They threw their shit in the trunk, and Dean gave Cas a slap on the back. “Good job, man,” he said. Cas just nodded, but his lips did quirk up at the corner.
“Look, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. It’s a shitty thing to do to someone, to give them something without their consent.”
Dean followed Cas out into the hall. He was about to speak when he saw Sam come out of the kitchen. They all stopped when they saw each other. Sam was holding a bottle of champagne. A myriad of expressions flit across his face… surprise, guilt, confusion, and finally suspicion.
So he brought his hands up to Cas’ face and tilted his head a little bit and kissed him harder. Might as well go for broke.
Cas closed his eyes and swallowed hard at the sensation of Dean’s tight ass gripping his finger. It felt so good, slick and warm, and he wanted to know desperately how it would feel on other parts of his body. He opened his eyes again and watched as he let his finger slowly slide out of Dean’s ass and back in again, an imitation of fornication that was gratifying, yet left him wanting more.
Cas tipped his head back with his hand to his mouth, chasing it with a water bottle he produced from his other pocket, and then proceeded to
Dean turned on the tv while he ate, watching Cas as he disassembled his burger and ate the parts he liked. Afterward, he headed into the shower and cleaned up, returning to the room to find Cas had removed his coat, jacket, and tie, as well as his shoes, and was laying on his bed looking at his phone.
“Mom wanted to nap, and it’s her truck,” Sam bit back. “Besides. It wasn’t deliberate. I’m... “ Dean smirked as Sammy realized he was caught.
He was practically bouncing as he got out of the truck, but he was quiet. He wasn’t entirely sure what the boys were hunting or whether they had set an ambush or what, so he figured he had better be quiet about it as he made his way into the barn. He was human now, and vulnerable.
It was a good thing he’d seen it before, because he wasn’t paying any attention. Instead, he watched Cas. It was a slow start, but worth it. Cas was watching the movie at first, but he kept sniffing and glancing to his side. After a few minutes, he began to lean over a bit, gradually getting closer and closer to the quilt, until his face was practically buried in it.
He went slowly, working himself inside carefully as he had done with his fingers earlier, inching into Dean with soft rocking movements until he finally breached the tight ring of muscle and slid home, his hips pressed tightly to Dean’s ass. He withdrew, slowly, almost all the way before sliding in again, his weight braced on his left hand while his right held on tightly to Dean’s hip.
Dean made a sound sort of halfway between a laugh and a cough. “So like, if it was just us hanging out and I gave it to you, it wouldn’t be so bad?”
Dean couldn’t even answer, he was laughing so hard. That drew Cas’ attention too, and it finally sunk into his fogged-up feather brain what was going on. He glared at Dean and set the blanket down. “That’s not funny, Dean,” he gritted out, before standing up and walking out of the room.
The cloth moved lower, over the bottom of his ribs, his belly, his navel, lower, catching a little on the bit of hair that led into his underwear. Which was getting tight.
Dean who if he was being honest with himself, kind of wanted to punch him in his stupid angel face right now, just bit out a terse “I’m fine.”
“I didn’t know. I didn’t think he could… I didn’t know. And now he’s there, and he’s hurting, and there’s nothing I can do.”
Cas started with Dean’s boots and Dean started with his flannel, and they met in the middle at Dean’s pants. Dean’s fingers must have still been a little stiff because he fumbled a lot so Cas pushed his hands aside impatiently and undid the buckle of his belt, and then a moment later he was pushing his jeans down so Dean could step out of them.
He got unsteadily to his feet, realizing as he did so that he was completely nude. He made his way to the door and pushed it open, realizing immediately that he had woken up in the dungeon of the Men of Letters bunker. He smiled in relief. He was home.
Dean burped as he opened Sam’s laptop, which he had left behind for Jack to use while his was being repaired. Dean blinked a little. In all honesty, he was a little smashed. He’d been drinking tonight, maybe a bit too much, but it was fine. It was fiiiine.
“I don’t think your friend Cas likes how Rowena was flirting with you,” the ski instructor said, his weird, Dick Roman-y smile sending shivers down Dean’s spine. He really didn’t understand how nobody else saw it.
His eyes shot open, meeting the blue of Cas’. His pupils dilated as Dean watched, fascinated. Cas had to know, had to realize that Dean was fine, but he was going along with it.
Dean liked cooking, and he made lasagna pretty regularly. Cas rarely ate much of anything, mostly just out of courtesy, but Dean knew he liked the way the cheese was all stretchy and chewy on lasagna, and that he also liked to eat the crunchy outside of the garlic toast, so he set out to make the best lasagna Cas had ever had. There were lots of herbs in it already, basil, parsley, oregano. So a little bit of false ironwort would not even be noticeable. It had hardly any taste or smell, and what was there was similar enough to basil that it wouldn’t throw the dish off.
“I feel it too, darling. I have been trying to send you hints all night but I was starting to think I was too subtle.” She climbed onto the bed and straddled him, running one shiny red nail up his chest. “Just promise you won’t tell Castiel.”
“Might as well relax for a few minutes.” Cas brought his hand up to his face and inhaled. Dean’s eyes widened. Cas let out a hum of satisfaction that seemed to reverberate through Dean’s body.
He smiled, happy for the first time since he’d told Dean he loved him. He hugged Jack, took his face in his hands and kissed his forehead. He asked him to tell everyone goodbye, then Jack took his fingertip and pressed it to Castiel’s forehead.
Sam’s glare at Dean intensified. Dean ignored him, but Cas was unsure. “I don’t know if there will be enough room.”
Now Dean was actually panicking a little. This was taking longer than he thought. If Cas pulled back now, he might die. As long as he didn’t, they couldn’t argue, they couldn’t fight, Cas couldn’t
“Hey, have you seen a couple of feds here in town?” He hoped the boys were using the FBI cover on this case, because if not, he wasn’t sure what he could try next.
But he could sense the energy and agitation coming off Dean in waves the whole drive back to the motel. And when he’d made that comment about ejaculation, he wasn’t entirely certain what the response would be. But the next day, cooped up for hours in the Impala next to a man who was clearly uncomfortable, twitching and tapping his fingers, brought Cas to the realization that seeing Dean like this was pretty much better than anything else he could think of. A few more uncomfortable moments, and they’d be even.
Unwilling to step too far down that road, he turned off the tv and then the light, crawling into his own bed. Cas’ phone glowed in the dark.
He crept quietly through the back door, listening for any sign of danger and waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dim light.. He knew he could be just as easily jumped by a Winchester as by a monster, and a Winchester was twice as dangerous. His sneakers made no noise on the dirt floor, and he bent low as he crept past the old stalls.
But Cas still didn’t pull away. Instead, he opened his goddamned mouth. Holy shit. He was kissing Cas. And Cas wasn’t objecting. Instead, he seemed to be participating. Dean could feel Cas’ hands on his arms, sliding to his chest, where instead of pushing him away, he grabbed onto his shirt and pulled him closer. Fuck. Holy shit. Dean started to think maybe he wasn’t gonna get smote just now, and let his tongue slip past Cas’ parted lips, let it slide inside, let himself feel that wet glide, let the soft, electric ozone and fresh air angel smell of him fill his head, until he felt almost dizzy and he had to pull back a bit, just to get his head back on straight.
“I was ill, Dean. It was in every way my own fault, but I was still ill. I didn’t love bees, I didn’t want a cat. My… shattered mind was trying to reassemble itself. I watched the bees, because... They have orders, they follow them. They don’t ask questions, they just do their jobs. No bee has ever ruined their hive and killed half their family in the name of free will. They obey, and life is good.”
“Alright, kiddo,” Dean said, so sotto it was almost a whisper. “I know you don’t want to go anywhere, but I think your family’s had enough death already. Ask me how I know, huh? But... that’s why you can’t give up. Even if you kind of want to, sometimes. And listen, when you’re
The air had a harsh feeling to it, it tickled his nostrils, but he didn’t pay it any mind. He liked this moment, when the fight was over and everything had stilled. Moments of calm in this life usually meant intoxication. Feeling good
things. People coughing up clockwork organs,” Dean referenced the case they’d just finished, “Skinwalker leftovers, that kind of shit.”
“Take this exit,” Sam directed Cas. “If this is really happening, I guess we’re buying kitten formula.”
Batman greeted Dean’s return with a trill and then silence. When Dean scooped him up off the chair for a trip to the kitchen, a buzzing against his arm told him that the little dude was purring.
had turned out to be a whole coven. It was all a lot more complicated than expected, but then, when did anything go smoothly?
” he finally came, spurting out his release onto Dean’s stomach and chest, while at the same time, the room went dark as it was suddenly filled with dark feathers that blocked the light and knocked items off the end table.
Cas and Dean didn’t talk about it again, but Dean still thought about it a lot. About Cas, licking the plate, licking his fingers. Burying his nose in the bag. The
He shuddered in anticipation when Cas returned his hand to Dean’s ass, brushing his fingertip gently over his hole a few times before finally easing the wet tip of his finger inside.
Dean knew Cas was unlikely to sleep in this motel. Despite what people thought, he had noticed the changes in Cas the last few years. He didn’t heal as quickly. He ate a little, and slept a few hours a week, albeit only in the security of the bunker. His vessel was changing too, softening around the jaw, lines around his eyes. Dean didn’t think occupied vessels aged, but the angel part of Cas was diminishing.
“I’m sure. I think the closest analogy would be to the effect catnip has on cats. Completely harmless. Just a temporary good feeling.”
Jack came in with the rest of the things a minute later. He set the bags on the counter and grabbed a knife. “I got a letter, Sam,” he said, excitedly.
It was just as he’d left it. A framed photo of himself and Jack, a few odds and ends he’d picked up over time, a notebook. Nothing else. He didn’t have his phone or his angel blade, those having been on his person when he’d been swallowed by the Empty. He didn’t even have any clothing.
He missed Dean so. But he thought maybe if he stayed a little longer, helped Sam keep his son safe, maybe he wouldn’t mind waiting just a little bit longer.
Dean didn’t even pretend. He closed his eyes and sucked Cas’ finger into his mouth, biting gently to hold him in place, then ran the tip of his tongue up one side and down the other. Cas pulled back slightly, and Dean moaned, and Cas
Guy didn’t reply, but that was because Dean chose that moment to come into the living room, dressed in his hotdog pajamas and dead guy robe. Guy straightened up.
Cas gasped, surprised at the painful thud in his chest he felt at this news. He looked back and forth between them.
“Cas… I… You know you’re my best friend. And I think maybe… except for Sammy. I guess. You’re probably the only person… the most important… I mean. I guess what I want to say is that ever since Purgatory, well, maybe before, and. Well. Then I guess you died and I couldn’t take it, man. And then you came back but all this stuff, and what I want to say is…”
He saw it on the third page, an article saying there were still no leads on the unusual murder and some missing children in Canton, and from what he could gather, it definitely sounded like the kind of thing the Winchesters would investigate, so Castiel finished his meal quickly and paid, jumping in his truck with the newspaper in hand.
The baby, Dean, was born, and Castiel held him the next day. “Say hello to your Uncle Cas,” Sam said. Castiel looked into his watery, unseeing baby eyes and smiled.
Cas was definitely enjoying himself. A few more days passed, and he could see Dean’s tension ratcheting up little by little. He was starting to enjoy this situation for its own sake, watching Dean’s discomfort, the red that stained his cheeks whenever Cas caught his eye, the way Dean jumped when Cas “happened” to brush against him in passing. He almost didn’t want it to end. But he could sense that Dean was pretty much at his breaking point, and knowing Dean, that would end up in some kind of huge argument that could take weeks to resolve. And the last few months had been one of the rare long stretches in their lives where nothing was really
Everyone stared at each other in silence for a moment until finally Dean spoke up. “Look, we could talk about this all night and figure it out, but I think we’ve all been embarrassed enough for one night. Let’s just all go to bed. In our
Suddenly, like in the kitchen, he let out a deep, visceral, throaty moan, that went directly to Dean’s dick, and with a kind of soft
The higher he got, the slower he went, and he watched, fascinated, as Dean’s ass clenched and released as each stroke brought him incrementally higher. Eventually his fingers brushed the bottom curve of Dean’s ass, and he flinched, groaning out a desperate “please, Cas,” that was the single most incendiary thing the had ever heard in his long, long existence.
Cas just shook his head at her and ushered her out of his room, muttering something about how humans, even witchy ones, seemed way too obsessed with sex.
Castiel didn’t know how to bring the situation up with Jack, but Jack was God, and he was in all things, and he knew anyway. It wasn’t long before he came to Castiel instead.
He felt Cas shift, moving his outside leg over Dean’s and moving up so he was kneeling between Dean’s thighs, and Dean opened further to accommodate him. Cas sucked in a breath, and finally,
Cas immediately began mouthing his way down Dean’s torso again, stopping along the way to tongue each nipple. When he reached Dean’s navel, he inhaled deeply, letting out a delicious sounding groan that went straight to Dean’s cock. Which was in unprecedented vicinity to Cas’ face right now.
Dean worked on his coat, jacket, and tie, while Cas kicked off his shoes and started on his belt. Then Dean started on Cas’ shirt, unbuttoning it one at a time, all while giving him the same treatment he’d gotten earlier. He kissed his way down Cas, breathing him in, tasting him. He was so familiar. He’d been surrounded by Cas’ scent for years, until it had become a part of his existence. But this was the first time he’d really been able to breathe it in.
Dean’s hands clenched in the bedding and his hips lifted, and Cas bent over Dean, letting his mouth brush over the curve of Dean’s ass and up his back, letting his tongue trail up his spine. He picked up speed, bracing himself with his other hand as he hovered over Dean, his own hips twitching, frustrated.
Mary cut him off. “It’s definitely not your imagination. He tries to hide it, but everyone pretty much knows. Well, almost everyone.” She laughed. “From what I understand, he’s felt like this for years. I keep trying to tell him, though, that if he thinks it will make him happy, he should just go for it.”
Dean didn’t want Cas sticking his finger in his mouth again, except he also kinda did, and anyway, maybe, if he was honest, he kinda didn’t mind Cas touching him in general, and he didn’t usually have a valid excuse, so maybe it wouldn’t be so so bad just this once if he let Cas give him a very
“Mary, why is your laptop up so loud?” Ever since she’d figured out how computers worked, she had been obsessed with YouTube, spending most of her free time parked in front of her laptop or her phone, watching everything under the sun from historical documentaries to fashion vloggers, to music videos. She’d even spent a week watching a long haired blond guy eat ancient military rations while somehow avoiding botulism. Cas had to admit, the guy did have a soothing voice.
"Shut up." Dean retorted, not as confidently as he meant it. "It's not like that… it's none of your business." He was flustered.
That's how Cas began to imagine it. A sweet moment between him and Sam that turned to more. Maybe something innocent like two friends just hanging out, play-fighting like Sam was known to do with Dean. Maybe Cas would get the same treatment Sam gave to Dean. It would be an honor if the younger Winchester felt comfortable enough with Cas to be playful with him.
With the push of a button on the bedside remote the fireplace blazed up. The woman, whose name they had come to learn was Rowena thanks to the hotel staff, laid herself out on the bed.
Dean circled a nipple with his tongue, hearing Cas' breath hitch as it became harder between his teeth.
Dean kissed Cas on the forehead and pulled him in tight. Cas quit fighting it and decided to trust Dean, he let go and felt the hot liquid pool up around his bottom before soaking into the padding.
"You know there's another one upstairs," she said as she opened the door, drying her hands on a paper towel and tossing it in the bin.
Dean smirked that crooked side smile and snaked his hand down to just above Cas’ member. He could feel the heat radiating between their skin.
He watched Sam's face contort, body rigid, and came to his own orgasm faster than he'd care to admit.
The fantasies became more vivid as the days went on. The following day, as he sat across from his two friends, chewing on the tip of his pen, he started to daydream about them. It started as a question, really, of what they were like in bed, what would happen in a threesome with them. Then it devolved.
"You were so patient for me. Tell me how I can make you feel good, Cas. I wanna make you feel good."
Dean tried to stretch Cas as much as he could before Cas was pushing his fingers away and aligning himself over Dean. He just needed to feel something inside of him.
While Dean teased, Cas was getting full and desperate. Though all the needs he felt completely distracted him from that need, that is until Dean pressed an ice cube to Cas, letting it melt in rivulets down his warm skin. The dribbling over his thighs made him twitch. Dean smiled up at him with that wicked look in his eye and popped the ice cube out of his mouth.
"Aw, c'mere." Dean enveloped Cas who didn't bother unfolding his arms. "I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention before."
"Please... please..." he kept begging, rocking his hips down into Dean, but not getting the stimulation he wanted.
Cas found himself in the back seat of the impala. It was comforting just being surrounded by the air that faintly smelled like Dean. Or maybe it was just that Dean always smelled like the impala. Cas was on his belly, as best he could be with his legs crunched up. He ground down into the seat and moaned at the sensation. Soon he was thrusting harder, faster, moaning Dean's name and then he heard a tap on the window. Startled, Cas peered up to see Dean looking in at him.
Dean stopped to admire his work for a moment. The way the knots dug into Cas and the straps left just the right places exposed. It was beautiful, and Dean told him as much. Then he started on the real work.
Without warning, Cas sank to his knees and put Dean in his mouth. Dean tried to stop him but Cas just pushed his hand away. Cas enjoyed it more than he thought he might and even after Dean had stopped Cas continued greedily sucking at Dean until Dean stopped him reminding him of their other plans.
“Thought you’d never ask.” Dean put a generous amount of lube on his finger and smeared it over Cas’ opening. After working in a few fingers, scissoring them back and forth, Dean put more on himself and positioned Cas in front of him. The ropes provided the perfect grip and the swing would allow for a wider range of motion.
By the time they arrived back in town, Cas was back to his usual self, scrolling through his phone and making comments about whatever he was looking at. The idea of sitting in some brightly lit diner made Dean cringe, so he just went through a drive through and grabbed a meal for himself and just a burger for Cas, then headed directly back to the motel.
He ran his hands slowly back up to Dean’s neck, avoiding his ass for the moment, and Dean let out an unearthly groan of pleasure that sent shivers down Castiel’s spine. Back down again, nudging the waist of his underwear down a fraction of an inch, then back up again. He leaned down, hovering near Dean’s ear and paused.
It worked, thank fuck, and he felt his eyes rolling back into his head as Cas’ hands, currently situated at the top of his thighs, slid higher than they had to this point. Dean felt his thumbs creep down between his legs, and he let them fall open a bit as Cas pushed them apart with his thumbs.
Jack’s face fell. “I can’t go! I told Jody I would visit this weekend. She’s already on her way here to pick me up.”
Cas cut his thoughts off before they got out of hand. Yeah, he could definitely see the appeal in that.
Sam walked in just as Dean hung up the phone. “Jody and Jack got away okay?” Cas asked. Sam didn’t reply. Instead he grinned wickedly. “What are you all doing sitting around here? Why aren’t you packing?”
“I’d love a beer,” Mary replied. Cas rolled his eyes and reached over to turn the speakers down himself.
After thrusting slowly and deeply a few times Dean began pulling Cas toward him faster, feeling their bodies collide with every beat.
"Shhhh." She cupped her hand over his mouth and pushed him around the corner. "What is your problem?"
Cas tried to press into the kiss. He wanted more, more! But Dean pulled back, only letting their lips tickle each other.
Dean kissed his neck and whispered, "I love how into these things you get. It's a turn on to see you turned on." And that made him feel better.
Dean spit on his hand and brought it down to Cas' opening, wetting it as much as he could before slipping a finger in.
It all happened so fast, Cas threw his head back and let out the most pained yet pleasured sound Dean had ever heard. He hurried his thrusting and let himself spill out into his boyfriend. And then they were just there, still connected, naked, messy, in the back seat of the impala.
Cas only nodded, not capable of forming comprehensible words while relief flooded him (and he flooded the diaper).
He watched as the middle aged man’s hands skillfully demonstrated how to make an incision. He started to imagine what those still, controlled hands might be able to do to a living breathing body. Even though he was known for flying off the handle at any minor inconvenience Cas imagined in a different setting Crowley would be collected. And that voice, oh, his gravelly voice giving whispered orders. His fingers trailing over the tools and toys picking the perfect one for the occasion and -
Suddenly the fantasy started to change, bringing a different kink out. And Cas wondered what it would feel like to have Sam's giant cock inside him while he was desperate for a piss. Would Sam laugh and call him a loser for losing control? Golden hot liquid spraying out of his helpless dick all over Sam's stomach and chest as Sam continued to fuck him senseless.
"No. I was going to say don't pleasure yourself," Dean said with a wink as he leaned in to kiss Cas. Then he moved to nibble on his ear and said "I'm serious. I want you to be crazy horny when I get back."
He let out his breath as he worked along Dean's length and then opened his eyes to see Dean watching him intently.
As the day went on Dean noticed something different about Jo. It was the subtle way she smiled at Charlie, and how she tucked her hair behind her ear when she laughed and the stolen glances, and – holy shit. They were hooking up.
Halfway through their walk home Dean and Cas were starting to hope Sam would stay out for a while. But once they got back to the apartment they made quick work of stripping down and heading for the shower.
"And if you do I'll blow open your whole operation out there." She said glancing at Cas. "I see him get all rigid every few minutes. What, do you have him hooked up to some electrodes? You're a real kinky freak, Dean. At family dinner?"
What Sam didn't expect was that Gabe would spend the night low-key flirting with him. At first he didn't notice, though Cas sure did. But as they got drunker the innuendos became more bold.
Sam sighed and took her word for it. Things warmed up awkwardly but eventually they fell into a comfortable pace. And it somehow ended up with Gabe behind the woman and Sam in front of her.
Dean saw Jo enter the house alone and, seeing no one follow her in, decided to go confront her. He leaned against the wall, waiting for her to exit the bathroom.
His stream finally tapered and he shivered as the last few drops escaped him. Cas stood to waddle to the conjoining bathroom. He took off the adult diaper very carefully and dried himself off with some bath tissue.
Dean got in the car after Cas sat up and made space for him. "Ellen called Bobby, they had a pipe burst and water was going everywhere. We came back early so he could help her get it squared away. What are ya doing in here?"
Imagine Sam's bladder capacity based on his size. Once Cas was filled up with as much of Sam's piss as he could hold Sam would pull out, still dribbling, and force Cas to his knees, putting his softening member inside his mouth, and letting the rest flow. Cas would greedily swallow as much as possible, but the stream would be so strong he'd cough and sputter on some of it.
He tried to silently communicate with the Winchester, but Dean wasn't getting it. Cas was growing frustrated with Dean not paying attention to his needs. This game of theirs only worked with trust and this wasn't it.
Cas reveled in the fact they had found something comfortable for both of them. Cas thought he needed everything to be rough, but he had really come to enjoy Dean’s teasing, something he did so well. He knew early on Dean couldn’t be rough with him, it brought up too much stuff, but when he was in his element Dean could be quite bossy and that was enough for Cas.
Sam seemed gentle, but on the flip side Dean seemed rough and he wasn't normally rough in bed. Dean liked making sure Cas felt good, he wasn't greedy or violent the way someone might expect if they just interacted with Dean. So maybe Sam was the same, gentle in real life, but primal in bed.
No. He shook the thoughts from his head. It felt a little like cheating. He knew it wasn’t but still, he felt slightly guilty anyway.
Sam's hands were large, but not rough like Dean's. Not that that was a bad thing, and Cas actually loved the feel of Dean's calloused hands moving along the sides of his body. But Sam's hands looked well manicured, exactly like the kind of hands one would want to explore their sensitive areas. Cas thought Sam's fingers would be long enough to not only brush against his prostate, but to sink into it.
Dean obliged, taking Cas in his hand and stroking it a few times before bringing his hand back up to his mouth and wetting it. Once he had his hand sufficiently wet, he replaced it on his boyfriend’s needy cock. Dean’s hand matched his own thrusts and it wasn't long before Cas wass a sweaty, needy, mess.
"Aye, I see. It's him." She looked to Gabriel. "Don't you worry, once we start, it'll seem like you're the only one here."
"Well you're not exactly being subtle about it." He then imitated Jo twisting her hair and laughing.
She led them back to her hotel -- the nicest one in town. She was, of course, renting the presidential suite fit with a jacuzzi and fireplace. Gabe eyed the jacuzzi but she redirected him.
And when Sam finally finished using and abusing Cas, he'd leave him there alone to clean up the mess, cock still aching for a release.
But maybe the playfulness would become more, rougher, and Cas would get hard and turned on and Sam would laugh at him because of it. But not in a mean way, just in a domineering sort of way. And he'd make Cas strip down so he could see how red and needy his dick really was. Sam would laugh some more at how pathetically horny Cas was before stripping himself. He'd demand that Cas get him erect, even though Cas could tell by the subtle twitch, Sam was a little turned on by Cas' desperation for him.
“I - Dean - Want -” Cas tried to speak but was unable to catch his breath. Dean slowed their movement.
But his words were cut short by the sound of his body losing control. All the liquid he’d been holding all night came bursting out at once, soaking his torso and then arching up to pool on the floor. Dean just watched in amazement at his own work.
Maybe it was easier this way. To pretend that this wasn’t what it was, to leave it unacknowledged. If they addressed it, then things might change, but if they just pretended, then it wasn’t anything. Nothing important. Nothing that could come between them.
“This is really good,” Jack said. He looked like he was enjoying it a lot, albeit not quite as intensely as Cas was.
Dean whimpered when he removed his hand, and Cas didn’t take his eyes off Dean’s ass as he removed his underwear as fast as angelically possible. “I think there’s a condom in my bag,” Dean gritted out.
Besides, it wasn’t like he had the opportunity to touch Dean that often. To take care of him. So, as long as he could reasonably get away with it, he would.
His pondering was cut short as Rowena breezed into the room. Cas had grown close to her as a friend, during the last year or so, and he trusted her almost as much as he did Sam and Dean.
Yeah, okay, he could see how that could be kind of a shitty thing to have happen in front of your family. Even if he did like watching it.
Cas approached the bed slowly. It kind of reminded Dean of a panther. It made him feel like he was being stalked. Sometimes he forgot, sometimes he took Cas’
flushed a bit when Cas had touched him. It probably wouldn’t be entirely unreasonable to be one hundred percent certain.
It didn’t take long to wear off. By the time Cas stopped moaning and sniffing, Sam had the baggies wrapped back up, and less than fifteen minutes had passed. He looked between the brothers and grimaced. His face was a bit red. “My apologies,” he said, with a kind of embarrassed chuckle.
Dean looked at Cas. Cas looked back, his blue eyes shining, and everything Dean was was reflected back. Cas’ hand came up to touch his cheek. “Me too. Dean, oh, Dean! I never thought!  Maybe this weekend, I considered that what I wanted wasn’t going to happen, and maybe anyone would do.” He laughed a bit. “That was silly.”
Next to him, Cas shifted, reaching into his pocket. It was dark as hell out, and the quarter moon didn’t provide enough light to get more than the shadowy contrast of Cas’ features, but Dean’s mind filled in the blanks. He heard the crinkle of soft plastic.
Their mouths met again, briefly, sloppily, and his eyes shot to Cas’ when the angel gritted out, “I’m almost...Dean, I can’t, I’m going to…”
Suddenly, Sam felt a whole lot better, knowing it was Rowena who was coming, instead of some random person they’d never met. As Cas left again to his room, Sam schooled his features back into something resembling indifference. “See,” he told Dean. “Now we’re gonna be stuck with Rowena all weekend.”
Dean was saved from any further uncomfortable conversations by Sam coming into the room, carrying a tray of mugs. Dean realized suddenly that maybe he should ask Sam about this. Alone.
The kitchen was empty. Cas had no idea how long the brothers had been gone, or when they would be back. He didn’t even know what day it was. But the bread on the counter had gone moldy, so it stood to reason they were on a hunt. A stroll through the library and Sam’s room confirmed that suspicion, as Sam’s laptop was nowhere to be found, and he always left it behind when he was planning to be back that day. A note on Sam’s desk had an address in Akron, Ohio, though, which was at least a lead.
“Dean, you don’t have to worry. Your family seems very accepting. It’s okay to admit your orientation. I think they all know anyway. Your mother told me.”
He looked up as Cas and Jack walked into the map room. “I thought you were going to the kitchen?” he asked.
Cas laughed. “Rowena drank most of a bottle of wine at supper, I don’t think she needs more rum. She’s already hanging all over Dean. It would be much better if she had the hots for Sam.”
“Okay, it’s fine then,” Dean said. He saw Dean slide his hand underneath his hips to fist his dick as Cas slicked himself up and lined himself up to Dean’s hole.
The kitten stopped baying, licked his lips, and made an odd sort of clucking sound before vomiting a little pool of whitish-clearish liquid onto Dean’s sleeve and lap.
Sam was the first to get a look at him, but Cas was right behind, obviously having completed his own fruitless search.
--the kitten was deeply stubborn, clearly intending to keep up its squeaker-toy routine as long as it drew breath.
“That’s good,” Sam said, “‘Cause according to this, kittens his age can’t poop on their own. You’ll have to uh… let’s see, it says,
Softly, so as not to disturb Batman as he started to doze in the warm pocket formed by Dean’s hand and stomach, Dean asked, “He’s
“Okay, fine, what was the deal with the bees?” Dean probed perfunctorily. “If you didn’t like them, and you don't like cats, and you’re telling me this now, there’s gotta be a reason, right?”
The beam of his flashlight swept the stairwell, and he found a light switch. The smell was stronger down here -- he couldn’t pick out all the bits and pieces of it like Cas could, but there was a very certain feline musk that sat on the ground like a cloud. Blended with the mildew and dust, it made him cough.
The kitten did not acknowledge this in any particular way, other than pressing on with his tuneless lament.
Of course, he was more stubborn than that. He wasn’t exactly enthused with the notion, but just like his namesake, Batman didn’t have a mom to do that kind of stuff. All the more reason to take him in, as far as Dean was concerned. What if someone else messed it up and he got hurt, or sick?
Its eyes were closed, and its little chest was not moving, no matter how long Dean waited, holding his own breath.
The scrawny body was covered only patchily in short black hair, and its head was a harsh triangle-wedge with frankly
against its will, as it did its damndest to protest. It dug its claws into the skin of his fingers, but as claws go, Dean had had worse. He made a sort of cradle-cage with his hands as he ascended the stairs, giving the little thing space to fight and wriggle, but not to escape.
Cas stopped looking into the rear view mirror entirely after that, all Dean could see of him was the back of his head. He thought about climbing into the front seat a couple of times, but Batman was comfortable, and the idea hit Dean like a ton of bricks that this could very well be the
It was a kitten, Dean supposed, though if pressed he’d say it more closely resembled a mogwai, or maybe a grounded bat.
There was a sad tenderness in Cas’ voice that practically gave Dean hives all over again when he said, shrugging, “You asked.”
Dean shifted Batman gently to the backseat to take the restraints off his gesturing. The kitten stood uneasily with a chirruping grunt. “If I said sorry now, so what? What difference does it make? I said it before, and I still didn’t help you. I could say it right now, you wouldn’t know if I even meant it or not.”
A chest freezer near the doorway between the two areas, however, confirmed what he’d thought. Cat parts of one kind or another were pretty common ingredients in witch magic, and these particular witches had been into some avant-garde stuff, lots of magical experimentation. They must have needed a steady supply.
Batman grumbled lightly when Dean scooped him from his napping place and deposited him alone on the seat of the recliner. He stepped out of the Dean-cave, shedding his shirts as he went and swearing under his breath. The mirror, when he reached the bathroom, showed the damage: everything from chin to navel, covered in angry, raised red patches that itched like the dickens. On top of all that, his eyes looked like he’d been on a five-day bender in a chlorinated pool.
He took two steps in. Dean held his flashlight like a knife and cast yellow circles into the corners of the room.
“Are you... sure that’s a good idea?” Cas worried -- too much, in Dean’s opinion. “You don’t know if it’s cursed, or something. Besides--”
All of a sudden, the way Ariel looked at Cas took a turn… specifically an up-and-down sort of turn. “Well. You’re very lucky to have such a good friend.” To Cas, she said, “Stoic, aren’t you?”
The little thing did its best to stand, shaky though it was. It arched its tiny spine, drew back its lips, and let out a pretty useless attempt at a hiss.
Dean woke with a start to the feeling of his phone vibrating in his pocket. His first thought was that it couldn’t possibly have been three hours already, he felt like he’d hardly closed his eyes, but the clock on his phone said otherwise.
“The hell do bees have to with… is this about me thinking you liked cats, before? You don’t like cats after all, or you changed your mind, whatever, who cares?” Dean began to get agitated. “The bunker’s a big place, dude, once he gets used to it, I’m sure you’ll hardly see him. It’s not like you ever hang around that long anyway. You’re really gonna make a big thing of this? It’s just a cat!”
It took everything Dean had to reach into his ribcage and pull out, “I don’t know. Give me a second.”
He hadn’t lied, about being alright with the next part. A couple of gentle swipes with a warm wet-wipe and Batman caught on quick to what he was meant to do. Definitely easier than a human baby.
life is….” Cas searched visibly for the word, and settled on: “inadvisable, at best. I’m certain you would once have agreed. I find myself unsure of what changed, since then.”
Cas smiles back at her and she bends down to meet her lips. They kiss sweetly and gently, and they linger there for probably too long, but neither of them care.
For a split second, Dean’s heart clenches, but the room remains calm and she knows she isn’t dreaming. So, she pulls Cas back down for another kiss, wrapping herself around her, pressing their bodies together. They lick into each other’s mouths lazily, until Dean pulls away. “We should get up.”
“Almost nine.” She whines this time, making Dean laugh. “Come on, Cas, up and at ‘em.” She presses a kiss to her forehead.
Subconsciously, Dean tightens her arms around her partner, and Cas, knowingly, cuddles closer and presses a kiss to her chest. “I’m here,” she says.
Dean is distracted from her thoughts when Cas rolls over, and she jolts when her hand slaps over her eyes. She lets out a surprised snort.
Cas pushes herself up into a sitting position and leans on her left hand to hover over Dean, whose gaze flickers downwards to the former angel’s bare chest before moving back to her face. She reaches forward to cup the blonde’s face and bends down to kiss her. “I love you, too.”
Dean wakes gently. Her eyes open slowly and she stares up at the ceiling for a moment, her eyebrows pinching. She turns her head to the right first, looking at the back of Cas’s sleeping head for a moment, then to the left to look at her phone where it’s plugged in on the nightstand. She grabs it and unplugs it, then wakes the screen to check the time and see why her alarm didn’t go off. The date catches her eye before she’s even unlocked her phone.
She looks back over at Cas, watching her breathe. She fingers the gold band on her left hand absently. It’s not on paper, of course, since that’s a complicated process they haven’t bothered to start yet, considering, in the eyes of the United States government, Cas isn’t a real person and Dean is dead. But they had a little ceremony back in June. Cas was breathtaking. She wore a simple white dress bought from some department store. Sam and Jack had taken her shopping, leaving Dean alone at the bunker, since it was ‘bad luck.’ But the day of, Dean learned that the anticipation was worth it. It was when she was walking towards her in her dress and bouquet of pink and white flowers, her smile bright, that Dean realized that
Dean hurried his pace a bit so he could finish with Cas instead of after. Dean’s legs start to feel weak and Cas is straining against the ropes with every muscle in his body. And then they are both wrecked. Panting and sweaty, they relished in the moment but then Cas started struggling.
Then he felt the hot jet of liquid spray him in the back of the thigh. Cas smiled to himself as he turned to see Dean clenching his hand around his leaking cock. He stepped closer to Dean and put his hand over Dean's, telling him to loosen his grip.
Cas shivered at the thought and that’s when he noticed the faint sound of Balthazar saying his name. He snapped to and pulled the pen away from his mouth, noticing the deep grooves where his teeth had sunk into it.
Gabe went to her side first and kissed her. Sam stood uncomfortably beside the bed until Rowena broke the kiss with the other man and patted the bed.
Another week, another Winchester family dinner – which now included Charlie and occasionally Jack, or Gabe and Balthazar, or Sam's new neighbors Kevin Tran and his mother, or the garage's newest employee and Bobby's long time friend, Garth. Their little family had certainly grown over the years and Dean had to admit, he loved it.
Everything felt so empty, his bed, his tight little hole, everything, of course, but his balls. They were full and heavy and - Cas hadn’t noticed when he started rocking his hips into the mattress. But he quickly came to and stopped. Sure, Dean would never know if he came, but he quite liked this little game.
He saw her check her phone and then look at Dean through the window. When she looked away and he was sure they wouldn't be disturbed he led Cas up the stairs to the master bedroom.
As he did, the trickle grew to a forceful stream. Cas aimed it at his own torso, feeling the warmth cascade down his groin and legs.
After working three fingers in, stretching and preparing Cas, Sam would sit on the couch with Cas positioned above him and thrust hard into him. It would make Cas whimper but Sam wouldn't care. He would take hold of Cas' hips and bounce him up and down as fast as he could.
So Cas would put his lips around Sam, feeling him grow in his mouth, bigger than he could've imagined, bigger than could fit in his mouth and when he'd choke on it Sam would snort at him and push him away so he could lube up a finger. Then he'd wiggle a slick finger into Cas' hole, forcing three fingers from the other hand into Cas' mouth. When Sam curved his finger to play at his prostate Cas' dick would jump in response.
Sam was laying on Dean's couch, miserably scrolling through Jessica's social media feeds. He couldn't believe she was out again, dancing with some guy in a pub, pictures of her with his arm draped over her shoulders. Sam groaned and tossed his phone in the ground, rolling onto his back and melodramatically resting his arm over his forehead.
"Guess she's riding the tricycle tonight." Gabe winked and headed in the direction of their awaiting venture.
Back at the bar, Sam and Gabe flanked a redhead at a table. They'd been talking to her all night and she was playing hard to get. She finally stood and began walking away before turning back to them.
