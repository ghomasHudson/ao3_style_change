No sleep for John now, very important to make sure he doesn’t fall asleep, very important to keep his eyes open, very important to get him warm.
“I still have a pair. To remind me of the old days.”
“Nope.”
“Sherlock, what’s going on?” John asks quietly, voice full of faked calm.
He surfaces with a splash and wipes the water from his face.
John stares at him for a moment, then stands up and collects his laptop. He doesn’t look at Sherlock as he makes his way to the door, but once there he stops and looks up again.
“Thank you.”
, please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover’s nasty sister?” he says, trying not to sound too admiring.
Like John before, Sherlock deflated completely, but not from relief.
Victor with his cronies make their way to where Sherlock is sitting, old torn photos and pieces of papers scattered in front of him, on top of which the chess board is standing from when Jim had slammed it down and moved his pawn. Victor sits down on Jim’s chair across Sherlock and takes one of the pictures in his hand.
“The lecture hall will be empty before you know it.”
He decides on a mixture of the two,
Molly comes back and Sherlock offers his congratulations and praises the ring, blushes for both of them when Molly rests her hand on his arm.
And all he can think about is John’s neck, hidden behind a beige-striped shirt collar and shoulders hunched against the cold, muscles stretched to turn his head when he is speaking to Lestrade standing next to him.
He had smiled to himself, his teeth gleaming between his lips.
“No.”
She sighs and falls asleep, snoring softly as Sherlock and John take their leave, baby-Lucy also fast asleep in her father’s arms.
“I am. I am.”
He had turned and walked out while Mycroft stayed to give instructions on moving their mother to the morgue and arranging a funeral home to come pick her up.
Everything shatters when Sherlock bursts through the pub’s door, sees John and starts towards him. John lifts his gaze when he hears the footsteps, lips turned up into a smile which falters immediately when he sees Sherlock.
“I’m sorry I could not be what you wanted me to be.”
It comes roaring back, magnified into a thousand suns that surround John and make him glow when he compliments his deductions.
John is starting to look like he did when Sherlock interrupted his date with Miranda.
They haven’t been in touch since Mycroft’s text.
Locking himself in his room, he wonders at Irene Adler’s phone in his hand and how last time someone died because of him the first thing he did was to admire Moriarty’s stakes in the game, how he now feels the empty hole in his heart, once again for someone he barely knew.
He goes to Molly and kisses her cheek, lets his lips hover over her cheekbones, nose lingering on the perfume on her temple.
“Isn’t it?” he purrs.
Every time Mrs Hudson scolds them about the condition of the kitchen. Or the sitting room. Or bathroom.
“I don’t have to.”
The coffee dripped over his lip and down his chin. He reached his hand to wipe it, stopping to look at the dirt under his fingernails. His hands still smelled like moss. He breathed it in, the smell of moist earth mixing with the soap John had used to try and clean him up earlier.
Still odd, still a stranger even to himself.
It doesn’t sound too much like
Sherlock doesn’t know how to interpret this. So he offers an explanation for John’s discomfort by stating he likely doesn’t know where to look, and she all but offers herself to John by stepping up to stand directly in front of him.
John blinks. Then he strokes Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock thinks about the dozens of pills he has hidden in the crack under the sink and dives back in his yoghurt.
The door closes upstairs. There is only white showing in the microscope.
John still couldn’t believe it happened. All this time, no matter how bad it got, no matter how much Moriarty seemed to get an upper hand, he never once thought that Sherlock could lose. That Sherlock could die.
“I know you would have bought it if I asked but where would be the surprise in that? I thought that I should try it out with you, as you’ve been moody when I played by myself last time.”
John: I could have been of help.
“I just thought you would look splendid in it.”
“Mr. Charlton, I presume?” he said.
Sherlock moved closer to him, adamant on receiving his kiss, but John put his hand on Sherlock’s mouth.
“Why didn’t you punish me for talking to that guy?”
“I beg you pardon?” Thomas asked, a bit fearfully.
“But we’re not a couple!”
“Of course, he left you everything.”
Whether Sherlock was conscious of it or not, he tried to dominate John, as much physically as mentally. John knew about it previously, from the gifts, form conversations with Irene, but the sexual aspect gave it a whole new meaning. Sherlock’s touches weren’t forceful but they were sure and demanding. John felt overpowered not by physical strength but by the intensity of Sherlock’s person.
He liked when Sherlock showed his dominating side, but he also liked that Sherlock couldn’t quite be consistent in it. No matter how much he wanted to punish John, he couldn’t keep the façade when he turned his head to kiss John with so much feeling. The fingers deep inside John were moving unhurriedly, making him gasp right into Sherlock’s mouth. Craning his neck in that way was uncomfortable so John had to turn it to the front again and face himself in the mirror.
“You seem very sure that man will approach me.”
“Well, I’m the one relaxing in the bath.”
Oh John, finally giving in, are we?
“Stop.” John didn’t want to listen to this rubbish “I can tolerate the presents, but I won’t be dependent on you.”
“Among other things.”
“Don’t make it sound like a funeral. I was just beginning to have fun.”
John looked over to where Sherlock was pointing.
Sherlock ordered him some kind of colorful drink and John latched onto the occasion to do anything than think about what was supposed to happen. He shouldn’t be so paranoid about a kiss. He kissed tons of people. Granted, they were mostly girls, but it wasn’t like that made much of a difference.
He could have continued, could have made Sherlock lose control or come in his pants, but he kind of admired the restraint it took not to move when he very visibly wanted to. It also seemed unfair, when Sherlock had spared him on his last dare.
John never really felt physically threated by Sherlock, he was fairly certain he could take him on with high chances of winning. At that moment, however, the intensity of Sherlock’s gaze reached a new level and John felt as if he was being killed in a thousand of ways, stripped of organs and bones. He was rooted to the spot, almost shivering under those furious eyes.
“Sherlock …” John’s hands traveled to Sherlock’s own on his stomach, theoretically to free himself.
Anyway, the pleased smile Sherlock sent his way was worth agreeing.
John did it with pleasure, the feel of his fingers on his cock almost too much to bear. At least that meant he would be allowed to come, possibly quite soon.
Sherlock was applying pressure to his back, massaging him, and god, was he good at knowing where exactly to press. John felt himself melting a bit. This was strange, unsettling, but in some inexplicable way, it also felt very nice.
“I’m not Mr Holmes-Watson yet, so be careful what you say.”
“Isn’t he supposed to be my dog?” John asked with amusement.
“Did you touch yourself when I was gone?”
John heard himself saying ‘fine’, but it was like an out-of-body experience. He didn’t think it. He didn’t know what was that even about.
“Get out,” he repeated in a harsh tone.
“I won’t tell you now. You must agree without knowing.”
“I told you, no masturbation without my permission,” Sherlock has a serious face on and it makes John that much more willing to do it.
There was also the fact that Sherlock never made evident what he wanted from John. He kissed him, yes, treated him with affection, but he didn’t exactly show any signs of wanting to sleep with John. John wasn’t even sure of Sherlock’s sexuality.
“Do you,” Sherlock started, his eyes closed to focus, “John Hamish Watson, take this man as your lawfully wedded husband?”
“Is that why he’s giving you gifts?”
“Was that all of it?”
“When I was a kid, Sherlock.”
When he left for the pool he didn’t bother covering his bruises. That would probably just draw more attention to it, and he was receiving a fair deal. Couldn’t people just mind their own business?
And then he just stopped. John was already panting, but he was too proud to ask for anything just yet. He wasn’t going to beg Sherlock just because of a fucking ice lolly, no matter how weirdly erotic that felt.
Sherlock looked beautiful like this. His dark unruly hair made a striking contrast to his pale skin and eyes. His posture was relaxed, and he lacked his usual chaotic energy. He seemed almost calm, soothing in a way that made John feel at ease, even with Sherlock’s attentive gaze on him.
“Enough. Take me home. I want to get out of these stupid clothes.”
Three hours passed and there was still no break-in. His dogs had quieted down some time ago. John knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep and the temptation to check if Sherlock was still there grew every minute. Finally, he gave in, like he always did. Clearly, those two years have taught him nothing.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice was hard, imperious, “free my hands.”
As soon as Sherlock ordered their drinks, John felt his hand encircle his waist. He didn’t react at first but Sherlock was dragging him closer.
John wanted to answer somehow, to laugh with derision, but when he opened his mouth only an ugly sob got out. He clenched his mouth shut, covering it with his hand to stop the noises that wanted to escape. He could no longer hold in the tears that had been gathering in his eyes from the moment Sherlock touched him. His whole body tensed with the effort of keeping from trembling but one kiss on the back of his head from Sherlock ruined it, made John turn around, hold onto Sherlock tightly and sob loudly into his chest, soaking his shirt with tears and snot. Sherlock caressed his hair with his hand and held onto him just as tight.
John’s mind turned blank.
“You never made any indication you wanted me to.”
“Punishment? I’m the one at your feet. Am I not good to you?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened when he moved their hands further, ghosting Sherlock’s fingers against his hole underneath the boxers - “here would be fine as well.”
“It’s a beautiful place for a wedding,” he said before Sherlock could start a conversation.
Before John could ever think to answer, she hung up.
For instance, it seemed only a little bizarre when they were walking up next to each other and suddenly he felt a gloved hand touching his ear.
“John, I think it’s time you leave the water, it’s freezing. I can help you –“
John looked at the man above him and was overtaken with lust at the sight of Sherlock’s face contorted in pleasure. He closed his legs more securely around Sherlock’s waist and forced him deeper, both of them gasping.
John’s first instinct, except letting out that embarrassingly loud sound, was to push Sherlock away. He remembered himself at the last moment and moved his hands from Sherlock’s chest to his curly hair. If Sherlock wanted to make a show, fine, he would get minimal cooperation.
“How much is even on it?”
Sherlock: I’m in Switzerland. SH
Sherlock left the bathroom then, supposedly to give John some privacy. He returned with two wine glasses, when John was already in the bathtub, safely covered with bubbles. Still, he felt weird, being completely naked so close to Sherlock.
“Yes, John?”
“You shouldn’t decide just yet.”
When they were back in their room, the first thing John did was to go out on the balcony that had a jacuzzi and run the tap. Sherlock looked at him imploringly, visibly worried.
John didn’t even think to object. If massaging his back was pleasurable, the head massage Sherlock gave him was heaven. John managed to forget where they were and everything else for a while.
“That’s not even a word.”
a thanks from him as you would from me.”
He manages until they have boarded the train, until they are moving across the moor and John has been staring out of the window for fifteen minutes, the silence between them stretching and stretching and stretching and he must still have some of the drug in his system because suddenly he is talking.
John can admit, he was mean and foolish. He understood why, on the next day, Sherlock disappeared somewhere leaving a note ‘case, don’t interrupt ’ on John’s armchair and didn’t appear for five days after that. So, he needed space, fine with John. At least he didn’t have to apologize right away and hopefully they could both forget about it.
“Do you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes -ah!- take this man as – as your lawfully wedded husband?” John said, somehow shabbily while Sherlock struck his prostate.
Thank you all for managing to read to this point, for leaving comments and kudos. This story is messy and it's hard for me to go back to the beginning and see all the mistakes I've made, but I'm proud I managed to finish something, even if it's taken me three years ha. Comment and let me know how you liked it!
“You’re right,” John moved the hand with the gun, posing the barrel against his own temple.
In his defense, he thought Sherlock would never agree to it. The shirt was in bad taste, and was in no way anything Sherlock would normally wear, even without that blasted sentence. Besides, Sherlock hated when John uttered the word, wearing would prove even more embarrassing.
“Play fair. Truth or dare?”
“I’m open-minded about those kinds of things, right baby?” Sherlock looked into his eyes.
“This is a punishment, John. I would have spanked you, if I wasn’t sure you would have enjoyed it too much.”
“And what makes you think that I would want to be with you after we slept together? Are you that sure of yourself, you arrogant git? To use your body as leverage against me, that’s just below anything.”
Guys, I'm sorry, I know I am being a sap! I promise I will return to the sexy content soon.
Sherlock didn’t seem bothered. He wasn’t unusually pink or breathing harder or any of the things that were characteristic of John’s state. Only his pupils were dilated.
“I don’t want to ask before I’m decided.”
John was certain Sherlock was not a fraud. Some could say he was blindsided by his love for him, but John knew him too intimately to believe for a second Sherlock could be a fake. His love did not blind him, it gave him insight.
“Daddy always takes such good care of me,” John said with amusement, softening his voice “can’t I take care of you for once?”
“And a bite, maybe.” Sherlock added as if all of this was normal.
Don't judge me, I was super drunk when I wrote this and the loss of my brain cells is visible.
John couldn’t believe she was his main advisor but he didn’t have another one, so he pondered her words.
Honestly, he expected to be whipped for this, tied up, and left to lick Sherlock’s shoes begging for forgiveness, anything depraved his mind could come up with. He did not expect Sherlock to leave for another overseas mission the next morning and he thought the silent treatment was his unsatisfying punishment for making Sherlock jealous until he got his newest gift.
“Nice try, daddy,” he leaned in further to clamp his teeth on Sherlock’s throat, but the sudden change of angle inside him made him bite harder than he wanted, though Sherlock’s sound wasn’t one of protest.
He scooted closer to Sherlock on the couch and leaned over the detective. He was going for his lips but when Sherlock closed his eyes John felt petulant enough to change his course and kiss only the corner of it, landing mostly on his cheek.
Sherlock was plunging his tongue in, moving his hand over John’s leg, and he was right the night before, there was no tenderness in this.
Their arguments were rarely about one specific thing. On a superficial level, yes, they were quarreling about something that happened, but before that point, the tension and aggression were accumulating in John for weeks. John tended to ignore the small annoying things unless they surprised him and he mostly just threw biting comments in Sherlock’s direction. But the added tension of the feeling that he was losing to Sherlock, of being an almost-but-not-quite lover, of the imbalance in their rapport, of Sherlock’s weird approach to relationships, created a conflict within him, a desperation he wasn’t able to completely control. So when something big happened it made him react with an intensity that seemed to surprise even Sherlock.
“Is there something you want?”
“Sherlock!”
John thought there surely couldn’t be a more beautiful person on earth than Sherlock was at that moment. There couldn’t be a more charming laugh than the one Sherlock emitted when John stepped on his foot, or a more musical heartbeat.
The animal was cute, he had to admit, but it still made no sense.
“Sherlock,” John was scared to look at him. “This is a very nice farm, but I’m not sure we –“
“I never said it had to be a sexual fantasy, John.”
Sherlock is somewhere between furious and interested, but he leaves it without comment, so John just smiles lazily. He can see himself in the small window on the bottom of the screen and he feels like a porn star with how he’s resting against the headboard, messing with his own nipple. This is mostly for show, but he doesn’t plan on making this particularly enjoyable for Sherlock. He just wants Sherlock to feel like he shouldn’t have left John here, alone. John can take care of his needs without him.
His conversation with Irene went on repeat in his head. ‘Have fun’ she said. How was he supposed to have fun? Why would he even listen to her?
, John thought, but telling it would only make Sherlock pity him when John was left to pick up the pieces of himself. Better not give Sherlock that advantage.
“I could help you with that,” Sherlock suggested, his voice low.
“Sherlock …”
“What do you mean ‘once I’ve chosen to stand by your side’?”
Sherlock groaned and John was pleased and amused by his frustration. He forgot about a tiny detail though. Sherlock had an extremely sexy trembling baritone. In fact, it was one of the things John noticed about him right away, long before he thought he might be attracted to him.
John raised up with a laugh and kissed the pout away.
He didn’t even realize he closed them, crushing his own hands around the base of the toy just to feel it more. It shields what he’s doing there from view a little. When he opens his eyes and sees Sherlock’s hungry, impatient gaze, he smirks.
He started speaking again right after.
He read some articles online on the performing couple. Apparently, they were married now, but they used to be rivals. They even argued once so explosively that they were banned from a national competition. It was unclear to him how exactly these people came to be married, but apparently there was no better duet in this century.
“Suit yourself!” John called after his rapidly retreating form before Sherlock managed to close the bathroom door.
“Oh, I feel you. You’re quite similar to him too, I thought you might be related or something, but when I heard you speak I figured you ought to have the same accent if you were family.”
“I always pay for food, John. Don’t pretend you need to ask, you didn’t even take your wallet.”
Because of the quarantine, I had some time to plan out the remaining chapters, so hopefully, I will update faster. Stay safe y'all.
“Sherlock, what are you doing?”
John could barely hold still when Sherlock’s mouth travelled slowly upwards, lavishing his ankle, his calve, then his knee, with kisses. When John was preparing himself to receive his mouth on his thigh Sherlock changed the leg, showing the same attention to the other one. When he did finally reach the inside of his thigh, a slow maddening process that made John repeatedly bite into his own hand from frustration, it was to immediately start sucking a bruise onto John’s skin.
John finds it on the small remote and god, that is something. It’s so strange to feel it heat up inside him, but he is definitely not complaining.
: Enjoy yourself? Really, John, you’re the only person to whine about an all-expenses paid vacation in Italy.
The longer he looked at the things the more he realized the horrible truth. He didn’t want to throw them away. He liked them. Sherlock gave them to him and even though he had ulterior motives he still felt it belonged to him now. That throwing it away would be a waste.
Sherlock was in the middle of sucking the skin around his nipple when the abrupt ring tone made both of them jump. It was Sherlock’s phone, and with one look John could tell Sherlock was going to ignore it, so he picked it up himself, and kept Sherlock away when he tried to go back to his earlier activity.
John sighed. That woman really did understand Sherlock well.
John was starting to get very flustered. His body was slowly reacting to Sherlock’s ministrations, against all sense. The fact that he usually associated bathing and washing with his little alone time, didn’t really help matters. When Sherlock moved to wash his armpits, John pushed him away.
So while Sherlock was occupied with their blonde lead, he sat by the bar to get properly drunk. This was where he noticed the guy and, at first, John was drawn to him just because he could recognize it was a soldier. He was older than John and seemed generally displeased. John was interested if he could change that.
After a few seconds John found his voice.
Sherlock raised suddenly. He left his half-full glass on the shelf, then put aside John’s empty one. He took a sponge and John understood sitting in the bath wasn’t all Sherlock planned for him.
“Whatever do you mean, John?”
“I will be gone for a moment, baby.” Sherlock was speaking louder. “Wait for me with the scotch, buy yourself something nice there.” And with a quick peck on the lips that John barely registered, he was gone.
The towel helped a little, but it was too late. Everyone saw this. Which was the point, but it didn’t make it any easier.
“There is no one else but you,” Sherlock assured with honesty.
“Isn’t it customary to bring a gift if one was away?”
“I did perform some sexual acts, yes.”
“Are you alright?” Sherlock was searching his eyes.
*************
Sherlock leaned down to his lips slowly, giving his upper lip a gentle nibble. John kissed back with open eyes, not trusting the devotion with which Sherlock treated him, even though it made him tremble inside. He went as far as putting his arms around Sherlock’s neck before the other drew slightly back.
He is lounging in John’s chair, legs throw over the side, stretching his feet to get them closer to the fire.
“So you’re a writer,” Sherlock manages to cough out, almost caught staring at John’s bum.
Like before, Sherlock just can’t stop.
Sherlock breathes in deeply, places his foot on the first step, then the other, then walks up and through the quadrangle, turns left and then right and then left again until he finds the math building, walks up two flights of stairs and knocks on the door.
John grasps Sherlock’s shoulders just when he is once again about to sink down. In the kid’s pool, a couple of mum’s bathing their toddlers glance at them every once in a while, wink at each other and giggle.
“So in all the years you’ve been a consulting detective, you’ve never considered that perhaps if a suspect pushes you in the Thames or drops a piece of evidence in a pool, you would - in the worst case scenario - drown?”
It’s not there.
John doesn’t look nearly as flabbergasted as he should.
The flies hit him first. Then there’s the smell. What was once the earthly shell of a 31-year-old man from Liverpool has now been lying on its face in the abandoned flat for two months and is harvested with flies.
“You need to be in place to inform us the moment the attack comes. An old-fashioned guard crew is always the best. You will intercept the messages, decode them and send them back to us and when the attack finally comes, you will be ready to inform us and
“I, however, have a glass of champagne to deliver,” he says as a farewell.
Sherlock blinks.
“John, please, put the phone down.”
Mycroft is gone. Off to see his dentist, hopefully. His breath has begun to stink.
“Here.”
He wonders if this is something Sherlock used to do with his previous lovers, shared their air, swallowed it in huge gulps, attached himself onto every piece of their lungs. He wonders if Sherlock has had lovers before him. For the first time he is thinking about the people before him, the ghosts in Sherlock’s past who have on their part been responsible in shaping him into what he is now. He wonders if he has been in situations like this before, situations that need him to drink from the other person’s lungs, come back for air and dive back in again.
“You weren’t wearing lipstick before.”
Eyes moving across the table, he accepted the rifle John offered to him. The heaviness of it felt sturdy in his hands, but did nothing to comfort him.
“Not like that. I’ve been done with that life for years. I’m a nurse now.”
“But you wouldn’t be working for the government,” Jim corrects. “You’d be working for me. Mycroft never has to know about this. It’s very unlikely he ever would. He is not omnipotent, you know.”
“Novel,” he breathes out.
“Wanna try in a small hotel room next? Perhaps somewhere warm and sunny, like Barbados?”
It takes him back to his mother’s beauty box where he would dig when she couldn’t see, five years old and interested in everything he’d go and sniff his mother’s make-ups, Chanel No. 5 and the several different types of hand lotion, would eventually be found by Mycroft who wiped off the smears of lipstick from his face and carried him out of the room with his small body thrown over his shoulder like a bag of potatoes, his nose bumping against his brother’s back, he himself screaming with joy. The scent would linger and before Sherlock at the age of nine finally realised his mother would not leave any memento of herself to him other than a cold shoulder and the scent of No. 5, cool and black like her dress-clad back, he would open the door to his mother’s bedroom and hope he could one day see her sitting at the table, turn to look at him and smile.
“The war requires it.”
In December, news about ghettos, horrors of people dying of diseases and hunger in densely populated areas – after each of which John did not eat for several days – changed into news of trains full of people, concentration camps and gas chambers.
Anderson looks to Lestrade for help.
His eyes glide up to his ankles that are covered in white fabric.
John paces back and forth the sitting room, stopping every now and then to look at his phone, sometimes he marches to the kitchen door, but stops before he has the chance to knock or open it. When he finally gathers the courage to enter, Sherlock’s phone has gone off seven times with Mycroft’s name lighting the screen each time so now he has another good way to make John feel needed.
“Yes,” he whispered hurriedly.
Bile rises to Sherlock’s throat.
“What do you normally say?” John bellows, and her breath hitches. “You’ve texted him a lot!”
“No, but Sherlock, the hostage, the old woman, she’s been there all this time!”
For the sixth time. At least.
“Why ta very much. And when I get older, you’re going to leave me and find someone younger?”
. Like sex automatically implies ownership.
“I got pregnant accidentally. Rubber broke, you know how it is.”
“What can I do?” he asks. “Surely MI6 has a way to handle these situations. You must have friends high up! Your superiors ---“
He’ll look at himself in the mirror while shaving the next morning and see his lower lip swollen and chapped. He’ll lick on the torn skin and it will sting and draw a tiny drop of blood he’ll pick up on his thumb and inspect in the fluorescent light.
asked him out.
John comes in an hour later, clearly more sober than Sherlock would have predicted and definitely angrier than when they last spoke. It’s clear from his gait that nothing went according to plan, but Sherlock only feels immensely happy that in the morning John will be waking up with him and not next to Louise Mortimer.
“Lie on your stomach,” he said, taking off his jacket and laying it on the cot.
“Where are you going?”
Usually it’s John who finds him. Before he is lit on fire like a human torch. John steps in just before the explosion, right before the door bangs shut and is locked by an invisible hand, right before the burning trees fall on him and rain down a shower of smoking pine needles.
He goes to get them more tea and when he returns John has finished his breakfast, moves past him with a sharp “We’re gonna miss the train”, and walks away. Sherlock lowers the teas down on the table so forcefully that the hot water sloshes over the rim and runs after him.
John pulls the towel away quickly and Sherlock grows calm instantly, staring at his feet, arms hanging loose by his sides. Slowly, John begins to dab the water droplets off Sherlock’s skin with the edge of the towel. This Sherlock seems to approve for he leans into the touch and rests his hands heavily on John’s shoulders and lets himself be led out of the steaming bathroom.
He now had a lover and was a lover. With a flat in the middle of London to surround their secret, its four walls softening their whispered confessions and echoing with their love-making, Sherlock felt safe and loved for the first time in his life. Before it had been his duty to just stay alive, to appear in public now and then, to maintain the image of a happy son, a decent brother, and well-respected citizen, while on the inside he despised it all, escaped it to drugs and back-alley fights. It pleased him now to be dressed in his finest with Victor by his side, to appear at his mother’s parties, to lead Victor out of the room to the dimly lit hallway.
“I… I…” he stammers.
“Because you are warm. Because you take care of me. No one has done that since Mummy and Father and since Mycroft got fat and turned into an intolerable arse.”
Just then the sergeant came back in, saying he and the private were ready to leave and asked whether they had anything they wanted him to report back to London. Sherlock turned his back, but John followed the sergeant outside, leaving the door open. Sherlock could hear them conversing, but the voices were too quiet to make out what they were saying.
“What, like strip poker? Who finds a fitting piece first gets to decide which item the other takes off?”
“John, I’m sorry. I was at Bart’s and… I lost track of time. Again. And my phone was…”
A door in the corner led to the tiniest bathroom he had ever seen, containing only a basin and a carafe, a towel rack and a faucet in the wall.
“What, no hug for mama?” Irene spreads her arms.
John snorted.
He remembers it suddenly in the middle of the afternoon.
“It will be such fun to watch you burn. Too bad it has to end eventually, since there won’t be an infinite amount of things to
“I need to go to the bank.”
His head ached.
“Yes.”
“I don’t smoke excessively,” Sherlock lists. “Only when people are annoying. I don’t put unlabelled body parts in the fridge… anymore. I cook. Sometimes.”
Sherlock wants to cry. He wants to burst out in tears because John is the first person since Mycroft to defend him. He wants John to see he is human, not like his mother. Crying would make him closer to John and get him further away from his mother.
John looks down at the bomb, at the little red point hovering over his chest.
After fifteen minutes, he looked up from the papers, meeting the calming blue eyes of Doctor Albertson and the incredibly deep green ones of the man who was offering him a chance to either get himself killed for his country or let him show that he was still capable of protecting it outside the medical ward.
She watches as he trots down the grassy slope slowly, the orderly close behind him but at a respectful distance. She nods at him and he stops while she and Sherlock keep walking down the slope and stop under a huge oak. Sherlock lifts his face up to inspect the sunshine flickering through the foliage, enjoys the freckles of light on his skin. The peace is broken once more by Doctor Mortimer’s next question.
Sherlock snatched what was left of John’s lunch – a small pot of pudding – opened it and began to wolf it down, one-handed.
He stumbles out of the bed, picking up the towel on his way.
His address changes so often it would be reasonable to assume that she would not be able to keep up. But every letter finds him and he devours each of them, a temporary escape from the dingy flats and pointlessness of the everyday that is only numbed by the regular occasions of a baggy pushed in his hand, cash exchanging owners and it’s like a light switch is turned on inside his head.
“I do not have monkeytoes,” Sherlock sounds outraged.
He dreams and wakes up with the pillowcase wet, sometimes the sheets, always clutching the bedding thinking there is another person in bed with him. He washes the tears away, to look strong, while the stickiness in his trousers constantly reminds him how fucked up he feels, how wrong everything is. It’s a kind of redemption, reminder that his dreams are as close as he can get to John at the moment.
“Do you know what will happen to you, Sherlock, if you don’t lay off?” Moriarty continues the conversation.
“Sherlock, is it Jim?” John pleads.
The paramedics almost tear the coat apart when they finally reach them and start to rub warmth back to John’s stiff joints. One of them pulls at the coat, the other at Sherlock who has attached himself so tightly against John’s back he seems like a natural part of him.
Like what Sherlock does with his feelings towards John.
“Would you be needing an office?” he asks, wrinkles of laughter decorating his face right where Sherlock already knew a quarter of a decade ago they would be appearing after Victor had spent his best years chasing potential employers off with a stick, having established himself in a nice day job and gotten healthy and fat on the earthly goods provided by that job.
“Sorry, mate.”
John huffed, but got up and went in to fill both mugs. When he came out again, he sat slightly closer to Sherlock.
John grabbed the dish towel and wiped his face with it.
“Any sign of discomfort?” she asked Sherlock.
Sebastian seems more content with this. He points them towards the chairs facing his desk and sits in his with an ease that suggests he wants them to believe he is in charge of the whole bank.
He slept on the lilo.
“We miss you at the Yard,” he says to break the tension.
At the other end of the table, Victor chuckles and lights a cigarette.
“What a good pet!” Jim says gleefully, inspecting John’s surrender, walking around him slowly. He sizes him up and down, biting his lip and sniffing the air around him.
“I’m not an alcoholic. This was just a one-off.”
“I wanna kiss.”
The boy gets more energy from this and begins to blabber.
Irene looks puzzled.
Sherlock tried to wrap himself up warmer inside his coat, hiding his neck and mouth behind his scarf and his hands in his armpits. Another bump on the road shook the car, and he groaned out loud. Something soft landed in his lap, and he peered at the other passengers.
They listened to the sounds getting closer, angry orders being shouted, people rummaging the crates surrounding them, then sounds of footsteps moving to the next room.
During the day, the nightmares never entered his mind. Only when the sun set and darkness enveloped the small cottage, they rushed back and he lay awake in his bed long after Sherlock had fallen asleep.
“I’d say about seven hours, considering. You won’t have an episode, will you?”
Sherlock looks at him vacantly. Of course he knows. Who doesn’t?
Musty smell of wet wood and dust welcomed him in. He was surprised at how small the cabin actually was. It had not looked like a palace from outside either, but inside it looked even smaller.
He will do anything to keep John safe. If that is what is at the end of the road, then it is definitely worth fighting for, no matter how.
“It is,” Mr Hartley agreed.
“Sorry!” he grabs it, hiding a slip of paper under it before he places it back on the table.
He takes the keys from the man and jumps on the driver’s seat. He waves Sherlock in and turns on the engine. The car roars under them like its namesake about to jump on its prey. Jim steps on the gas paddle and they shoot off down the street.
He looks small, like he has shrunk down in his sleep, the white of his tee translucent in the moonlight. There’s a full moon, the night of werewolves, and Sherlock can’t sleep.
John’s expression goes icy for a moment, then back to stony indifference. But there are two extra creases around his mouth.
Every time Lestrade indicates he needs a medical opinion, the little comment at the end telling him that John would enjoy this one as a medical man.
“A man,” John asked, holding tight to the linen she was trying to pull from his arms.
“I don’t know!”
There was still a possibility they did not know they were there.
“We oft are. Have been ever since you decided it would be a good idea to start writing about our cases and publishing them in the world wide web for everyone to see. The question, however, is: why am
It was incomplete, a thought began but never properly finished. An abstract metaphor without the necessary parallel. While the rest of the book was full of cryptic code, this was something John had felt the need to write down in a language anyone who happened to find it could understand. It was almost like a cry for help, an aborted suicide note.
Mycroft brushes invisible dust off his suit as is his habit. Resting his hands on his umbrella, he leans towards his brother.
“I must say, I am impressed by the efficiency New Scotland Yard has approached this case.”
from John and proceeds effectively to break the mood when he forgets John’s new girlfriend’s name on purpose, reveals to Lestrade that his wife is still having an affair and the next thing John says to him is “Shut up!” as he informs him that his sister is still drinking.
“Sherlock” he said, squeezing the wrist he still had in his hand. “Go.”
“I can tell this case is going to take us a couple of days and I can’t have you getting sick.”
“I’m pretty sure he treats everyone like that. Understanding Sherlock isn’t easy.”
“I wish you were here,” John says, positioning the vibrator at his entrance, “Not even to help me, or fuck me. I just wish I could kiss you.”
John was afraid that the only way to get out of this unscathed was to distance himself, but treating Sherlock with indifference seemed impossible. John couldn’t once again live with the horrible loneliness he experienced after leaving the army. He already needed Sherlock too much, was too dependent on him, and the thought of Sherlock throwing him away was the worst scenario he could imagine. It scared him how weak he became, and it scared him Sherlock would despise him for it.
“You never said where to kiss you,” John threw at him smugly.
Sherlock nodded, but when John returned with the steaming cup, he was already asleep on the couch. He left the tea on the coffee table and covered Sherlock with a blanket, wandering to bed himself. He could hear Sherlock’s song in his head, putting him to sleep.
“Fuck, Sherlock, this was …”
That was such a hard thing to do. John wanted Sherlock to touch him everywhere.
And it was the moment Sherlock stopped.
“John,” he says in a low voice, “stop this now.”
“John,” his voice was moved, silent but sure, “I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you, I promise.”
“Is that necessary?”
“Sherlock is not like a normal person. His approach is unpredictable.”
nothing, I just told him he could do anything he wanted to me, basically
John: Immensely
Disappeared into the bathroom for an hour. Told me to wait on his bed, which doesn’t inspire great confidence
“I don’t care. You fucking wear it!”
“You sure it’s not just because you’re a pervert?” he asked with a smugness that he should be incapable of in his current predicament.
Therefore he was surprised that he got to spend his days in the pool, doing absolutely no work, or being taken to lovely restaurants with Sherlock, who discussed the case with him only half of the time. They roamed the Amalfi coast in Sherlock’s rented cabriolet, and Sherlock didn’t complain that it was drawing him away from his work.
“All that I’m going to tell you.”
Unexpectedly harder than resisting Sherlock when he pushed him down and made him beg, was not breaking down when Sherlock surprised him. For instance, John expected to be punished right away when Sherlock returned, had backed away from him right against the counter. He watched Sherlock’s approach with careful eyes, ready to put up a fight if need be, though he was sure he would give in to Sherlock’s touches. He just didn’t want to do it easily. But Sherlock didn’t look at him in the hot, merciless way he did when he wanted to overpower John. He ran his hand through John’s hair tenderly and John blinked.
“Dare.”
“Couldn’t you have bought me something for beginners?” he asks Sherlock, half-jokingly.
“Does it hurt there?” Sherlock’s voice was only a little bit amused.
“Yes.”
When he separated their lips, he could see that Sherlock was as frantically excited as him. It was time to go a bit further, at least for John. If Sherlock begged him to do something, he would, but not before that.
On the first day of his two-week break from work Sherlock woke him up at six in the morning. John was in the process of considering killing him with a pillow, but then Sherlock confused him by saying John had to dress up quickly if he didn’t want to miss their flight.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide when he saw the dildo.
He got only a small margin of advantage from this. Sherlock came, but he didn’t lose his control completely, he didn’t give John what he wanted. This was still not victory and it made John sigh heavily.
Sherlock smiled at him.
After that, John didn’t try to do anything that might upset Sherlock, he just accepted whatever Sherlock decided to give him, be it gifts, kisses or blowjobs. It seemed to make Sherlock happy and John couldn’t complain while he was being pampered either, so he got used to the arrangement.
“Fine, I’ll just go-“
https://www.schaapcitroen.nl/en/rolex-datejust-36-41657255.html
“No,” he made his way back in the direction of the car. “You are crazy and I am tired of your games. We’re going home.”
He was beginning to give up on that particular investigation when suddenly among the words and moans a loud whining ‘Daddy’ was uttered and Sherlock twitched. John looked at the screen. A girl and a boy, twins possibly, about twenty-five, but made to look younger, were sucking a sizeable dick of an older man. John looked back at Sherlock. He seemed normal. Maybe John imagined it? Or something else entirely caused Sherlock to do that? But then the boy said ‘Daddy, please, let me drink it’ and there was no mistaking it. Sherlock’s posture changed, his muscles contracting to keep him still. In the morning light John could see his blush, reaching even his ears. Sherlock was aware he was being watched and that John was not stupid or unobservant enough not to know what happened.
Though by this point Sherlock was shamelessly tugging on John’s pajamas and John shoved him away harshly with a foot on his chest. Sherlock had a look of a predator on his face and it never failed to make John’s blood sing in answer, unfortunately.
Sherlock: Soon. And I’m not on vacation, I’m at work. SH
“What?” John asked, abashed.
“Not in public. And don’t overdo it.”
He tried to push Sherlock back a little, but not with real intent. He had seen quite a bit of porn that happened in an elevator, and he could dream a little, before stopping this.
“You see, John” the sponge travelled oved his shoulder to his back “I am very pleased right now.”
“I earn money, Sherlock. I don’t need you to give me any.”
He very confusedly asked the barmaid for a Long Island Iced Tea but remembered why they were here when the man he was supposed to investigate said to her “On me” and sat down next to him.
It didn’t explain anything. Not the fact that when they got out of the plane a red cabriolet was waiting for them on the parking lot with a guy giving Sherlock the keys. Certainly not the long ride, with breathtaking views of the sea and rocks that took them somewhere on the Amalfi coast in front of a very fancy looking hotel hidden by the cliffs. Definitely not the suite they got, that John was too overwhelmed to see whole for the moment.
Of course, it took quite a bit of time to get used to the feeling. He purposely didn’t choose a small one. But once he got used to it, he increased his tempo, Sherlock’s gaze spurring him on.
He realized he called Sherlock out on his weird kink in front of a group of people, some of them well acquainted with them. Somehow, he had a feeling he also didn’t help his whole ‘not being gay’ argument.
Sigh. “Fine”
“Is this a punishment?” he asked John after swallowing the piece.
“His choice of interests doesn’t really prove that.”
Sherlock seemed to reward John’s decision by removing his teeth and licking the place instead.
“Nothing.”
It was definitely a bad way to answer, because Sherlock turned to him and pinned him with his sharp eyes.
“John,” Sherlock’s eyes flitted down, “you’re still wearing my ring.”
“There’s the man form the restaurant.”
“What?”
Sherlock’s gaze was piercing. “I will punish you.”
Sherlock looked at him in a tortured manner and John could see the case was calling out to him, but he also really didn’t want to move. He leaned up and gave Sherlock a peck on the lips, only to push him off a moment later.
He moved his hand to swipe the wild curls off Sherlock’s sweaty forehead, the movements inside him stuttering. Sherlock orgasmed with John’s name on his lips, his eyes closed and his arms trembling, keeping himself above John. He fell into John’s welcoming arms and John ran his hands through his hair, down his back, while he was regaining his composure.
John scoffed.
John was not afraid to have sex with Sherlock. Well, no more afraid of it than he was of the thought of having sex with any man. He was anxious because Sherlock’s touches worked strangely on him. He never felt like this with a woman, this out of control. He had had sex lots of times, but this was about more than simple physical pleasure or even attraction.
“I don’t know, John. You know, I’ve never been into men, but I can’t say with a hundred percent certainty that I never will. I don’t think you can be too old for that.”
John thought the alcohol would make it easier to explain the situation, but it was tricky either way. He tried to gloss over the fact that he was Sherlock’s kind-of-sort-of accidental sugar baby and focus on their trip to Italy and the kiss they shared, the days after it, the situation at home since the concert. It was clear to him their relationship changed, and now Sherlock didn’t simply ignore it. He touched John in increasingly familiar ways, never enough to call them sexual or romantic, but in ways that he didn’t do before. His fingers lingered on John’s when he handed him a cup, traveled to John’s waist when he was moving him out of the way, landed sometimes on his arm or on his knee when John said something Sherlock considered clever. John wasn’t sure if he was being seduced or tested.
“I told you, you’re much more his type.”
But he kept his mouth open, his legs too. He weaved his hand into Sherlock’s soft hair, the other holding him close around his shoulder.
“This is our late grandfather’s wedding band. Sherlock stipulated that, in the case of his death, all of his possessions will pass onto his fiancé.”
His hand was back on John’s jaw, gently forcing John’s mouth open. The sudden placement of something cold inside it made John startle a bit.
“Fine. We kissed. She thrust her tongue into my mouth and I saw stars. Nobody kissed me like that before. She took my hand and let me feel how wet she was. I almost came in my pants. She was a bit older, I think she did it before. She had condoms, thank god. I entered her and I thought that I was going to die. She wriggled on top of me and I came, very, very quickly. She then showed me how to move my hand to make her come. I got hard again fast and I put it inside her again and used my hand on her at the same time and she seemed to really like that.”
“Don’t you want to give Gladstone a kiss? He’ll get sad.”
His mouth was covered by Sherlock’s hand and that just made him furious. He bit on it harshly, the pain making Sherlock draw back a little and John used that chance to free himself and attack Sherlock, pushing his back on the bed and caging him with his thighs.
“Why do you want it so much? You don’t know how it feels.”
“Another present?”
He guessed that was what Sherlock meant when he said he would make John see himself as he saw him. John felt ashamed to be excited by the sight of his own body. He was so hard and he only wanted more, he wanted Sherlock to put more than his fingers inside and he wanted to see himself in the moment Sherlock entered him. He wanted to see the pain and the pleasure.
“Am I making it hard for you?”
Professor Chalamet did tell him that she had a crush on Sherlock once. John could see them together, a perfect couple, even though she probably wouldn’t solve crimes alongside him, even though she just got happily married to another man. But the logic of his mind couldn’t reach his painfully gripped heart when he saw Sherlock like this, flawless, far away from John.
John complied with the request, sluggishly taking out a condom packet.
“Ah, no, that was because it tickles.”
“Sherlock-“
“John,” Sherlock was smiling at him and John guessed he had to stand up from the couch, even though he was feeling lazy.
John sipped the drink thoughtfully.
“You look so beautiful,” Sherlock said and John laughed, “you look like you’re made for this.”
“It’s not -”
“I suppose not.” John said, sanding him a shy smile.
He busied himself with ordering sushi and cooling the wine, among other preparations, until he heard the unmistakable sounds of Sherlock approaching.
Sherlock reached into his pocket and took out a hotel key card.
“If you insist on giving away my food, for which I paid, you could at least buy some of it back.”
“No.”
Sometimes though, not often, he just couldn’t stop himself from answering Sherlock’s, frankly appalling, behaviour without breaking some of his self-induced resolutions.
John felt weird with his arse and cock exposed in an elevator. The mirror was big, he could see almost all of himself in it and he looked depraved. He could also see Sherlock taking out a small bottle from his coat, spilling the contents onto his fingers.
And if John had tears in the corners of his eyes, they were just a physical manifestation of pleasure.
When they passed a nice looking store with ‘Balance Massage & Wellness’ written on the glass, Mrs Hudson sighed loudly. “I always pass this place, wishing to go in, but I never have the courage.”
“God, Sherlock. Isn’t this too much? First the phone, then the card and now this ridiculous place and the suit. How much more –“
“You better do, or else I can always stop this.”
Sherlock looked at him intensely.
Sherlock’s hand was still on his back and it didn’t seem to be leaving anytime soon.
Sherlock looked at him, not in his - ‘you are an idiot unable to ever understand me’ way, but in his - ‘you are my favourite person in the universe’ way.
Sherlock started breathing, freeing his muscles from rigidly holding his body in one place. He posed his hands above John’s hips and moved him slightly back from his cock.
“This, Sherlock” John lifted up the hand with the Rolex “What is this?”
“No, that happened a year later when my girlfriend taught me how to properly go down on her,” John replied sarcastically.
Sherlock turned him on his back and for one wonderful moment, John thought his prayers were answered. Then Sherlock closed his mouth around John’s nipple and his hand around his member. The other went to press the skin around his hole, massaging his prostate externally.
“John,” Sherlock leans down more into his space. John kind of forgot how the word makes him react. “You promised.”
“From what I’ve heard you were arguing? Whatever was the matter?”
“We don’t have to tell him, do we?”
“Give me the ring.”
Sherlock had definitely done it before because there was no way anyone could be that good their first time, but it was only a passing thought in John’s mind, who was too preoccupied with keeping his eyes open to enjoy the show Sherlock was very clearly giving him. Most of the time he looked up at John, but at moments he closed his eyes, somehow still managing to look graceful and beautiful with his mouth filled with John’s cock.
John eased the pressure holding his legs and ass in place, and Sherlock didn’t wait, he pulled him flush against his body, legs opened wide to accommodate Sherlock’s hips in-between. John could feel how the water from his body seeped into Sherlock’s shirt and trousers. Sherlock didn’t seem to mind, he left no space between them. He dragged his tongue from John’s ear back into his mouth, and these time John barely tried to fight him for dominance. It was clear he wasn’t supposed to.
They drove to a beautiful little restaurant in Positano, and John reveled in the sound and smell of the sea, the breathtaking views of the city built in the cliffs, the exquisite taste of the seafood, listening to Sherlock talk about chemical properties of various wines. He reveled in anything that let him forget what just happened.
“Are we here to question him?”
But he couldn’t give up now.
“You bastard, you’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” John hissed under his breath. Sherlock smirked against his skin.
Instead of answering John moaned, the combination of prostate stimulation and Sherlock’s voice too much for him.
“Oh, so Sherlock didn’t tell you? Well, well. He likes to keep his fair share of secrets, doesn’t he?”
“John” he said breathlessly and John’s chest ached.
He returned to pulling on Sherlock’s bottom lip, but his hand traveled down his own body, opening the button of his trousers. Not wearing underwear was a good choice, he could easily reach the tip of his cock to yank it, moaning into Sherlock’s mouth.
Irene had said to him, but he didn’t want to listen. She was certainly no expert on love, even if she was at sex. He knew what would hurt him and he knew he had to protect himself. He had his ways of keeping himself whole, it didn’t matter Irene said it would not last. He would not admit anything to Sherlock and he would not promise him anything. The other may very well try to make him, but he would
Sherlock left before John had the chance to see him again. He wrote him a message that he was abroad working, no doubt another ridiculously well paid demand of his brother’s. John was a bit pissed at him, because he wasn’t at the clinic for the next three days and could accompany Sherlock if the other just asked, so he ignored the text. Maybe it was for the better that his stupid flatmate went away after that fight, but John was now undecided what to do with his time.
“For your brother, you mean?”
There were definitely changes in Sherlock: he looked gaunter, more ragged, older. A vagabond, returning home after a long absence.
The long time it took to talk Mrs Hudson into agreeing to be treated by him and his initial doubts all faded away with the tension languidly leaving his body. He never expected it to feel this good, he received medical massages before, he was able to give them, but this was quite different. The exquisite pleasure of touch and aroma made him forget about his current problems and his mood held up throughout the evening, even when he tried to desperately hide Sherlock’s initials on the card holder when he was paying.
Currently, for instance, he was seated across from Sherlock in, what John assumed was a very expensive restaurant with a French name he could not pronounce. And he believed that nothing could surprise him more than the debit card he found in the new card holder on his bedside table two days ago. The card was on his name, but the leather holder had Sherlock’s initials. A clear enough message. John was afraid to even touch it.
Sherlock’s look of utter disgust meant it was indeed for Mycroft. Interesting. Usually, when Mycroft asked Sherlock to do something he had to annoy him (and John, for that matter) for a month, before Sherlock agreed.
John had been pretty excited before. Now, ignoring the hardness was impossible and he mewled when Sherlock bit his earlobe.
“I left it at home. Do you think it’s Moriarty?”
When Sherlock finally let go of him and went into the shop, John realized he made a terrible mistake. It was too late now. He agreed to do
John realized that denying anything was futile with Sherlock’s hand still posed possessively on his lower back.
Sherlock kneeled at his feet in one dramatic flourish of motion.
“I’m not sure. The last time I was on a picnic with a decent looking guy, he ended up kissing me.”
“That’s what it is, John,” Lestrade says. “Love. You love him so much you didn’t see any of his faults. You can’t blame yourself for not noticing.”
She goes to a large desk directly in front of Sherlock and takes a clipboard and a pen from it.
He is suddenly very happy, all horrors of last night forgotten. His eyes are bright and his face looks smoother.
“It’s just the usual stuff,” she tries to keep her voice even.
“And you brought in half the gutter with you,” John peeks over Sherlock’s shoulders to see the muddy footprints that decorate the stairs. Sherlock’s dress shoes are spoiled and his trousers are wet up to the knee.
Irene dangles her head. Jim glances at her with disinterest before turning back to look at Sherlock. Doctor Mortimer turns back to him too, then to Jim and Irene again, looking somehow puzzled.
John returns to the poor patient slowly nearing his death on the bed. He brushes away the sweaty hair from the sweaty forehead and rests his hand on the sweaty neck. Sherlock lifts one sweaty hand to press a very sweaty handprint on John's jeans.
John breathes in and growls into the pillows, gathers himself and tries to get up once more.
Sherlock looks up at him under half-closed lids.
The car was awful. The road was awful. The weather was awful. The whole bloody West Country was awful!
John phones Lestrade.
), sitting on the steps of one of the bigger memorials commemorating who-knows-what long gone hero. He looks up, sees Sherlock, and is instantly on his feet.
John did not feel calm at all.
“Consulting criminal. Brilliant.”
Sherlock looks at his brother, his lean back and sharp face.
He puts them in line in front of himself, humming something, starts with the more formal pair Sherlock has named his Groovy Shoes (because they are fancier and always shine more than the others). Then there’s the Everyday Shoes or Criminal Chasing Shoes and finally the Date Shoes.
He walks to the window where the notes Sherlock hasn’t been able to fit on the wall shine white against the glass. The sun pouring in casts shadows the shape of numbers and letters over his face and for a moment he is haloed by the light and mysticism of the symbols on his skin.
“Would it be completely out of bounds if I kissed you?” John asks, like he is talking to a shop clerk at Tesco’s looking for tomatoes.
He jumps up and pulls at his arm until Sherlock relents and stands up as well. Jim takes his shoes from the ground and presses them in his hands, waits for him to push them to his feet then claps his arm around his neck and leads him out.
She looks vulnerable, like all the pain in the world has been poured over her, and yet her eyes blaze with strength at the same time, strength that comes from knowing what you do is right even though it may hurt.
“Have I mentioned how stupid this mission is?”
The front door was open to the warm night. The birds had retired several hours ago, and because Sherlock was for once reading and not fiddling with his equipment, every sound from outside was distinctive and clear. Still, Sherlock had been so invested in his book and so determined not to pay his surroundings any mind that John was the first to hear the change in the forest.
John licked his lips.
“I am not a hero,” John blushed.
John comes home, still trying to decide what to tell Sherlock, clearly changing his mind even after he has planned to go with the lie of new identity and life in America but when Sherlock begs him for the empty shell of a phone, he places it gently in Sherlock’s palm and doesn’t say anything more but exits to hand the folder back to Mycroft.
“Don’t go too far, Sherlock,” John said from his side, still staring at the jar of jams like he was faced with the most difficult decision of his life.
"There is a car waiting downstairs."
John nods gratefully. Sherlock goes back to staring at the pink phone on the table.
“Boys,” Mrs Holmes calls from the other side of the door. “Father is famished. He has already threatened he will start without you if you don’t come down.”
“When did you receive the messages?”
The boy shut his mouth with a snap.
Sherlock should have known the nightmares would be worse now. John had eluded sleep for days, staring in front of him with glassy eyes, his gun by his side at all times, never asleep, never quite awake.
“Better end things with him quick as you can, Molly, before you walk in on him with one of his boyfriends,” Sherlock turns back to his microscope. “Will save you a lot of heartbreak.”
“Shut up.”
The shutter flicks and he is free to escape back to John.
“You look about the same as usual,” Sherlock says to the ceiling. He is lying on the sofa as always, deep in thought (Or sulk. What’s the difference when John has a date.), wearing his pyjamas because obviously no one is going to offer him any kind of case tonight.
John opens his mouth, but Mycroft is faster.
“They agree with me completely. You work best alone, you work best in
“Please, John, please don’t move me,” Sherlock begged. “Just let me lie here.”
This is what Sherlock thinks when Mike Stamford first introduces them.
It doesn’t take too long. Just long enough for John to begin a conversation Sherlock has certainly not expected.
“They say you are not real,” Sherlock says to John.
Sherlock tries to understand what he has just done.
Sherlock hears about this later and hopes it’s a good sign. If John can forgive Mycroft for selling Sherlock’s life story to Moriarty, maybe he can forgive Sherlock for faking his death as well.
“You like him.”
They go home and Sherlock gathers everything he still has on Carl Powers on the kitchen table.
“I’m the child? Me? I sure as hell didn’t start this tickling match!”
He looked up at Sherlock, eyes warm, mouth firm, just a hint of smile playing in the right corner.
Then she smiles and pats her abdomen.
He should have just kept his full attention on holding Sherlock down. But the ridiculousness of the attempt to distract him had made him forget about Sherlock’s really rather long legs, which were now deftly hooked around his midriff and in the process of rolling him over.
“John Watson, hi,” John sighs and nods at Jim.
She winks and is out of the room. John stares at the pot in his hands, lifts the top and sniffs. It smells like chamomile, it looks like chamomile and he dearly hopes the combination will fool Sherlock enough to make him drink it.
“We don’t?”
Sherlock nodded and stepped forward to free himself from the grasp. John turned around to help the sergeant unload the car. The private, who had followed with the rest of the supplies, jumped out of his car and began to unpack with speed that was clearly meant only to impress his superior. Sherlock, who had been given charge of the keys, went to the hut and opened the door.
“Owww,” answers John.
“Thank you.”
Watson had hung it on a nail on the door next to Sherlock’s and now the other nail was empty.
“More guests must have arrived,” Mr Trevor mused.
“Good night, Mr Trevor.”
The tea sloshes on the floor by Irene’s feet, Irene, who is leaning against the doorframe, inspecting Sherlock’s nudity with gleaming eyes.
The voice of a soldier.
John bins everything in the fridge, then begins to unpack the shopping. There’s milk and yoghurt, beans,
Sherlock’s own phone begins to ring. Clutching the pink phone in his left hand, he takes his phone from his breast pocket and replies.
“Well, you’re just as popular as your shampoo. I wouldn’t think anyone would like to wash their hair with that muck.”
“You’re better than him, you are. You are better than him.”
“You know your plots better than I do,” he replies.
for once, and he is out of nicotine patches. Then John walks briskly to him and pulls his arms round his waist.
He is alone at home, John working a double-shift at the surgery.
“NSY. Now,” he says.
“I have played a very minor part in this,” Victor says solemnly.
Sherlock stops insulting the gravel with his heel. Slowly, questioningly, he offers Victor his hand. Victor takes it and squeezes it firmly. His hand is much smaller than Sherlock’s, but still it seems to envelope every bit of it in its warmth. The hand is dry and soft and there is a whiff of almond.
“Stephen, dear, don’t wander off,” the woman said absently, reading the label on a can of pears.
“I didn’t know how you take it, so I just thought something warm would be enough for now and we can dig into the sole carton of milk we have later,” John said apologetically.
Sherlock crunches his nose.
“I’m all right,” Lestrade replies hurriedly, like John is going to too much trouble already.
But it’s a start.
The moment passes and Mycroft slumps, nods slightly and rises from the table. He moves to the window, hands together behind his back. Doctor Mortimer, surprised herself at John’s outburst, is still looking at him for support. When he turns towards them, his eyes are hooded.
“I didn’t know it would take you five hours to choose a jar of jam. Now, what do you need that goose fat for?”
Sherlock, startled by the sound of his name, looks up and directly at the bar where the big-breasted woman is listening to her friends chatter but clearly her concentration is directed towards their table. There’s no question that her eyes are directed at him.
At that moment, Louise Mortimer walks in and orders herself a glass of white. Henry’s therapist. Henry’s very attractive therapist.
Then the fun really stops.
Silence falls over the table again, but now Sherlock does not hear it. He stares at the white piece of wood dangling in front of him, slams his notes back on the table and sits down.
John Watson stands at the edge of the pool holding Sherlock’s shoes and socks in his hands, a very intrigued stork next to him. Both the stork and the doctor follow Sherlock’s rise out of the water with their neck joints stiff, moving their heads in sync, which makes Lestrade and Donovan laugh even harder.
“You were saying?” he goes back to his notebook.
here most because you take all the bloody space and no one else can actually fit here. Now go away, I’m sleepy.”
“Me,” John smiles. “Your date?”
The tree does smell good and the Hershey’s kisses John has decorated it with
She looks homely and calm.
“My husband,” he says, pulling out a sandwich wrapped in clingfilm, “loves jam.”
He remembers yelling. There’s not much he remembers about the actual details of the case, but he remembers the yelling, bellowing, his anger towards John, towards
“I never meant that you are not allowed to be loved, Sherlock,” she says. Her hand, warm and brown from the sun, clasps his.
Under the table, Sherlock takes John’s hand and squeezes it so that his joints crackle. John squeezes back just as hard.
Sherlock scratches at the bark.
“You wearing any pants?”
All in all, a Sherlock lying on top of one with his elbows poking into the other person's chest is not the most comfortable of things to feel first thing in the morning, but Sherlock is ill and John will humour him and let him stay where he is.
“No, no,
“And when I say had, I’m being indelicate.”
Hospital be damned.
He ran through the corridors, skidding to a halt at the door marked with an enamelled plate saying ‘Doctor Philip Albertson, MD.’ He breathed in quietly, willing the tremor in his hand to settle, then patted his hair down before knocking.
“Exactly the reason why I don’t work for my brother.”
Sherlock beeps.
It’s fantastic, it’s brilliant, it’s glorious. It’s heat and moisture and starlight and a volcano erupting all at once, and he whimpers when John stops kissing him and starts talking instead.
Sherlock glances at the woman again, weighing his options.
Lestrade leaves John with an apology and steps next to Sherlock, who sighs deep in relief when the smell of Harris’ awful aftershave moves away from him.
Again, John blushes crimson and Sherlock slithers his foot under the dressing gown to touch his thigh.
Anderson looks incredulous as the woman accepts her drink from the bartender, only to resume her coy glances. He scoffs, swigs down his beer and makes his way towards the loo.
Only the gun always attached securely by his hip broke the illusion of comfort.
Sherlock crouches over the corpse with a slight grunt, flicks open his magnifying glass and begins to inspect the interesting looking fibres on the victim’s shoulders.
Instead, he turns to Mrs Hudson who has come upstairs to tell him there is a taxi at the door he hasn’t ordered. Anger rises in him little by little, John explaining the situation to Mrs Hudson, Lestrade giving orders to people still infiltrating his kitchen, his sitting room, his life. The noises buzz around his head until he explodes and yells for everyone to shut up, Anderson especially, orders himself to think, Mrs Hudson tries to pipe in about the taxi and the moment he yells at her, something clicks into place inside his head.
“Really?” he smiles. “And maybe some beans, too?”
Mr Trevor snickered.
It was not from a handgun.
“Of course!” he slams his hands down, making Mrs Hudson jump up to high heavens, just as John enters through the door.
“You still living on Baker Street, then?” Lestrade asks as he clicks shut his briefcase at the end of the day and leads John out of his office.
They walk in silence for a moment, Lestrade waiting for John to say more, but the walls are too high up after everything that has happened and Lestrade has to be direct if he really wants John to know he cares.
The devil’s dwelling place.
“You can see me,” he offers.
“So touchingly loyal. But oops!”
Sherlock stood still in the middle of the room, the wire from the headphones stretching to its utmost, the vital radio equipment hanging at the edge of the table, almost falling to the floor.
There was only one room that formed both the bedroom and the kitchenette. In the middle of everything were two tables. One larger, obviously meant for his radio equipment, and a smaller one, merely big enough to fit two people and their meals.
So they sit down for tea and biscuits and a briefing of what seems to be the biggest threat against the nation at the moment.
John won’t question it. He’ll come home, see it and think he has gone to Bart’s or to the shops for the milk. He won’t check the website. He won’t text Mycroft.
John gives him the silent treatment for days, never leaving the flat for more than to go to work or to the shops or to Mrs Hudson’s. He never strays far but sits in his armchair, back turned to Sherlock, doing anything but look at him.
Sherlock decides he will never get a broken heart, not if it is that awful. He cannot understand that falling in love could cause something like it, not if it can make you feel as happy as his love towards John makes him.
The bare feet next to his polished Loake boots make him lift his gaze again.
“All right! That’s it!”
Moriarty smiles and moves closer, nodding his head slowly.
When he climbs back upstairs, Sherlock is sitting on the floor, bare legs stretched out in front of him, his dressing gown hanging loose on his shoulders, barely covering anything.
“She’s engaged, you berk.”
“My employer was assured that you wouldn’t.”
‘Here’ is another warehouse. Jim seems to be favouring them lately.
“I didn’t,” Sherlock persists. “I said I can’t swim very well.”
John’s arms tightened around him, crunching against his bones so hard he felt he would break.
“And somebody loves you.”
Instead, he says, eyes fixed back to Moriarty,
Marlon Harris, the Chief Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police, is an elderly man who favours 80s large plastic glasses and combs his hair back to give himself a youthful look. All to emphasise his receding hairline.
“Me?” he whispers.
“She’s beautiful,” Sherlock says.
The winds had suddenly turned after November rains were over, bringing with them icy rain and more mist that buried everything for weeks. The sea did not freeze over, but it became cold enough overnight for ice to form over the rocky beach, making everything slippery.
He jumps upright at the voice, panic mixing with confusion and fear about what has happened to John.
John huffs up the steps to the door of the flat, puts down his bag with a heavy
She reaches out her hand to grab the collar from around his neck. He smells her perfume, categorises the fragrance and saves it on his hard drive.
Of course. A woman so fond of her form would naturally use something so disgustingly intimate as her key code. She is the walking image of pride after all.
Sherlock turns his back to him and tries to sit up straight. He falls over the bed and into Jim’s open suitcase.
“It’s where I began.”
For two months he is constantly thinking about Mycroft’s Machiavellian idea of the end justifying the means. He tries to convince himself it is the best excuse to drag John against him the moment he returns from his own trip to Mycroft’s. Because at the moment every chance might be his last.
Deep breath in, she’s clearly thinking about it.
“’Happy’? ‘Happy’? I am forced to endure a whole evening with people I hate, have to tolerate seven screaming children, am drowned in wine and not in a way I’d have preferred, and I’m supposed to be ‘happy’?”
“On your stomach. On the cot. Like this.”
“My mother died last spring,” Sherlock continues. “My brother is the only family I have left, and I can’t stay with him. I refused any money he wanted to offer me, got a scholarship and came here. Oxford was terrible, too far away from everything, and I thought that in London I could feel part of something again. But sometimes I just
“I’m breaking the law by coming here, Murray. You can’t ask me anything about it, but I can’t leave without you knowing I have gone. I don’t think it will matter much longer anyway, because quite soon you’ll be visited by a man named Holmes who will ask you to take up an assignment of your own. If you say yes, I'll at least sleep my nights easier knowing you will make sure I come back home alive. So when he comes to see you, hear him out and remember that there is no threat to Alicia. She will be safe, no matter what you decide to do.”
Now Sherlock and Victor did the same, careful to say goodbye before any of the servants had a chance to come knocking in the morning.
John swallowed audibly. A childish fear in him raised its head, urging him to drop everything and just run and hide.
Sherlock swings the bow between his fingers, staring at the wall.
“This is only a flatmate showing concern for the other’s well-being.”
He hears Victor breathe in with a little stutter, almost like a laugh, and he looks up. Victor has leaned back in his chair, fingers covering his mouth, lips spreading slowly into a smile.
But he doesn’t cry. And John doesn’t know.
Lestrade waves John’s terrified apologies away, laughing good-humouredly when Sherlock, never learning anything from his mistakes, sticks his hand under John’s jumper again. After that, John is often called by several monikers that are usually given to little children every time Lestrade is having a particularly good day.
“He started with that and then went off to blow the banks and the government building while both were empty,” Donovan continues as she stirs two sugars into her tea and clinks the spoon in her cup.
“So you honestly never watched this when you were a child?” he asks after he has gathered himself enough to speak.
“I understand it was not my best performance so I have decided to do it again.”
“I do! And what you said was a question, not an exclamation. Do get your intonations right.”
“For god’s sake, Sherlock! Stop pulling your earlobe! You’ll get granny ears.”
“How am I ever going to make you quit smoking if the Queen is going to show you such a bad example?”
She sits down with a sigh and stretches her feet forward.
“Tea?” John asks.
He grows bolder every day, biting occasionally and when John wakes up sore and stiff in the morning and moans his body’s misuse, Sherlock only smirks wickedly. For a moment he turns roughness into cuddles and bites into blowing raspberries on John’s skin until John laughs with tears streaming from his eyes and they forget to go further but fall asleep with their skin glowing and breathing deeply just from cuddling and laughing.
“Do you think they’d not wipe out all the information about my past? My whole life changed when I hopped on board the international spying industry.”
“Now, you say you first saw it after you’d spend the afternoon in your garden trimming the nettles smothering your roses?”
“Then one with the Detective Inspector, if you please, Mr Holmes!” the photographer bellows.
Sherlock can’t think.
“The morning after, I know. Just came by to see how the happy couple is taking their first steps.”
An uneducated, short-tempered man claiming the stabbing of his girlfriend to have been an accident but still describes it with fiery passion. Sherlock can see he enjoyed killing her, punishing her with the knife several times more than necessary, only because he got off on every new hit, every new squirt of blood. He doesn’t know whether to be more disgusted by the man’s lack of imagination when it comes to committing murder with a phallus symbol or his atrocious grammar.
“She has my figure already,” Molly says. “Look at the chubby little fingers. And her thighs! I bet the one-pieces your mum gave us won’t fit,” she says to Josh who has sat down next to her on the bed, arm over her shoulders.
Even though John appreciated their thoughtfulness for his recovery (even though by the end of each visit he was pretty exhausted), he was also about to die from boredom by day three.
“You’ve climbed up the social ladder,” Sherlock snickers. “That tie is awful.”
“Well, from what you’re telling me you didn’t exactly reject him, so what’s the problem? You seem to be going along with it just fine.”
Very soon John could not look at the screen anymore and instead watched Sherlock. He was curious whether his flatmate was really as uninterested as he seemed. He watched for signs of arousal, but found none.
“Could you turn that down a bit?” John asked, his voice throaty from sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where?”
“He likes subs who belong to other people.”
“Good,” Sherlock praises and John ignores how that makes him feel, “start from the lowest vibrations.”
And being pleased by Sherlock was an otherworldly experience. It normally was amazing, but here, Sherlock used even more of his mindfulness to make John feel good. He rolled them around in satin sheets, aching for John but never giving in, focusing that much more on putting John’s body on fire with his touch. John fell asleep every night spent and satisfied, cuddled against Sherlock’s side. He woke up late and Sherlock was adamant about helping him dress, using it as an excuse to tease John with fabrics and to kiss along his body. Along with that, the food they ate, the alcohol they tasted, the breeze from the sea they breathed, the birds singing among exotic trees, made John live in a world full of flavour.
John shrugged and started taking off his jumper.
John could survive hard kisses and travelling hands, but Sherlock didn’t allow him any distance. No space to protect his mind and body. No time to protect his dignity.
Sherlock followed him, not looking away from his eyes. John smirked. Even hesitant, Sherlock still had a hunger in him.
“Enough with this truth or dare game,” Sherlock clarified.
He left his hands on Sherlock arms for balance. Sherlock wasn’t nearly as proper and left one hand on his back, slightly above his ass, and to make matters worse the hand was now somehow below his shirt. The other hand he moved to the back of John’s neck, below the collar, and pulled him uncomfortably close.
“You’re over-exerting yourself, Sherlock. I told you Indian was fine.” He told between the bites of his delicious mysterious food that he allowed Sherlock to order for him.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but the way he kissed seemed pensive. His hands skimmed over the places where John’s legs met his hips and it tingled a bit making John jump up. Then, Sherlock opened John’s legs wider and this made John feel very vulnerable and very empty. One of Sherlock’s hand made its way to his perineum and then over the rim of his hole, tracing a circle around it.
Somehow, the imaginary John landed on imaginary’s Sherlock lap, while the other was moving his hand up and down in the same rhythm that John’s real hand was. Sherlock whispered filthy things straight into his ear. His other hand went to John’s face, pushing two of his fingers into John’s mouth and ordering him to suck. And John did, he did it gladly, riding his cock into Sherlock’s hand and taking his fingers as deep as he could, moaning like a whore, wanting more.
As for the other thing, well, he wasn’t sure. It felt nice, fantastic even, that time they kissed in the cabriolet, and he simultaneously thought about it a lot and was already forgetting that it was a real thing that actually happened. He didn’t really have urges to suddenly kiss Sherlock, especially when Sherlock was sitting at John’s laptop with tea spilling out of his mouth, or chewing loudly some food that John had to put right in front of his mouth for him to notice. He didn’t jump away when Sherlock leaned over him to look at John’s notes, he didn’t feel anxious when Sherlock pulled him to run after him from people who were throwing knives at them. This was their normal, ordinary life, and John was too used to Sherlock’s constant closeness to really mind it.
Very suddenly Sherlock drove of the lane, parking on the roadsite.
Was he really called a chicken by Irene Adler? It’s not like he never thought of asking that, just … he wasn’t really sure what to expect. Sherlock didn’t act like this thing they had was sexual in nature, he never appreciated when John called him that cursed word that seemed to be his kink. Irene, however, disagreed on that point. John would hate to prove her right.
“Let me admire you, John. Let me observe the moment your synapses light on fire. I want to know the most intense of your states. Show me your mind when it’s out of control.”
“But you never had penetrative sex?”
“I was playing a role.”
“This place,” Sherlock pressed on with his finger and John almost sobbed, “no one ever used it, is that right?”
“Sherlock …”
“John,” his voice was low, pleading.
John hasn’t cried much since Sherlock’s funeral, only at night, when he woke up from nightmares. This nightmare has finally ended and he could, at last, let the tears flow.
“The main problem is that I can’t. I’ve been losing to him all this time.”
Sherlock, of course, could percept his hesitation.
“I haven’t been handcuffed on a date before.”
“Me, petulant? I was going along with your stupid scheme and that’s what you think? That I was doing it to get on your nerves? You didn’t seem to be avoiding things that would affect me on that couch.”
“John!” Sherlock did not look particularly embarrassed or even surprised. “You’re awake. That’s splendid, I could use a second opinion. Come join me.”
“Usually. It proves to be quite a challenge sometimes.”
“A lead more probably.”
Sherlock was very fast and relied a lot on surprising his opponents. He managed to catch the underside of John’s thigh and the back of his head instantaneously, pulling John down to lay on the couch, the hand on his head saving John from a painful impact with the armrest.
“To shower! Come on, you’re a mess.”
John wanted to say but remained quiet, ‘
“Is he? You know, John, these days everything seems so suspicious. Everyone values their pride so much. Historically, wasn’t it normal to woo someone by lavishing them with gifts?”
John sighed. He was debating how to deflect Irene’s accusations, but in this moment, Sherlock came into the room. He was, thankfully, still fully dressed. He still had the ridiculous shirt on.
In the privacy of his mind, he could allow the imaginary Sherlock to put his hand on John’s thigh in a taxi. He could allow this Sherlock to ignore John’s weak protests when Sherlock’s hand started travelling higher and under his waistband. He could shiver when Sherlock leaned in to order him to open his legs wider.
If even death couldn’t stop Sherlock from playing games with him than John had to keep on playing. He had nothing else to do.
John didn’t even know what to say to this kind of frivolity.
He already had a dare in mind, but Sherlock picked truth.
“What are my choices?” John answered with humor.
He didn’t really expect to be overly interested in the music, more on the aesthetic of being in this place. He didn’t dislike violin music, he even liked hearing Sherlock play when he wasn’t murdering the strings, but he was never one of the people who listened to it in their free time.
John couldn’t quite recognize the look Sherlock gave him. He looked crazed in a similar way he got when he was on a brink of solving a case, but with even more intensity.
John’s sleepy brain did not even try to touch upon how very wrong it was to watch porn with your male flatmate in the middle of the night. He knew Sherlock was watching it for a case, something about sex clubs, though John did not know the details, he was at work when it came up.
“You git! Just fuck me, the hell are you waiting for?”
What he saw confused him. There was a bathtub, filled with water and way too much foam. There were actual candles around it, providing the only light, making the bathroom warm and distorted. John also noticed a bottle of wine on a shelf.
She laughed again.
There was no hesitation, no squeamishness in Sherlock’s movements. There was some urgency in this, but John did tell him to hurry up.
John wanted to reject it, but he realized they were still in their roles. So he took the hand.
Even when he found a small box on his bed and opened it to find a freaking Rolex inside, he somehow let it slide. He went up to Sherlock to make sure the other knew it was not John’s birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s day, or anything that could warrant such generosity. Sherlock seemed unaffected and told John it was ‘just a little gift’ and resumed his work, shushing the other’s protest.
“I want to leave,” John said and his selfishness didn’t seem to disturb Sherlock.
“Are you –“ John started, then abruptly stopped himself.
“I’m dealing with it, thanks.”
The bed dipped under Sherlock and there were lips on John’s neck. John moved forward, but Sherlock just followed, catching him around the waist.
His hands moved down and opened Sherlock’s shirt, button by button, at a torturous pace. Once Sherlock’s chest was free, John looked down. God, he loved that milky white skin. He ran his fingernail down from Sherlock’s ear and neck to that chest, wanting to see the skin redden under the touch. When his fingernail teased Sherlock’s nipple, John could see him biting his lip, so he leaned down to give Sherlock more skin to bite.
“I do not! Don’t twist this so that I fit your perversions. I bet you wish I would just come and say ‘thank you so much, Daddy, you are so good to me’!”
When he took the fingers out, he moved Sherlock’s hand to rest on his throat, made him close his palm around it a bit. Sherlock gasped.
He realized he did something wrong only when the younglings, Greg and most of all, Sherlock stared at him. It probably wasn’t even the words themselves, it was his voice. He didn’t plan to sound so suggestive.
Sherlock has that look again, the one that makes John sure Sherlock has at least some violent tendencies and it makes John shiver. His fingers moving inside himself, slowly stretching the rim of his hole aren’t making him any calmer. The sensation is ticklish in a way, strange and not very comfortable. John doesn’t take much time to find his own prostate and the simplest touch to it makes him arch his back. Sherlock glares at him like a hungry animal.
But none of those situations could top the mortification that little moment of absent-mindedness awarded him. He was bleary, and honestly, he thought Sherlock was the one making all that noise, because, well, he was Sherlock. He didn’t know how tired he must have been to go all the way up to Sherlock before opening his eyes fully and seeing that there were six other people there. John immediately hid behind Sherlock’s back and saw Lestrade facepalming in their direction. He cursed Sherlock in his mind for keeping him up all night, but outwardly he tried to keep the appearance of relative calm.
This was already a lot of stimulation. Sherlock was slow, but he wasn’t quite delicate. His fingers were moving in and out in a manner that was torturous, the tempo of it would never be enough to make John orgasm, but it was just enough to make him frenzied. He could no longer play with his chest, the hand assisting in keeping him from falling forward into the mirror, his legs barely able to stand.
“It is generally the idea.”
“You walked a lot today. Your feet must be aching,” he said in a neutral tone.
“I need an outsider’s opinion.”
“He’s cute. But why, Sherlock?”
Sherlock stood up and rotated John’s stool, so that he was facing Sherlock instead of the bar. John did everything to not contract all of his muscles.
collar? Since when did he have a collar? The last one was just for a case. Did Sherlock actually bring it here?
“John,” Sherlock repeats in a low tone and John thinks he will never comply, but it’s followed by an unwilling: “Please.”
“Did you ever masturbate in public?”
John wasn’t exactly drowning in close friends. The closest person to him was Sherlock, and John felt like asking him about what was going on was both pointless and like admitting defeat. His sister wouldn’t be much help, Mrs Hudson already thought they were together, and he wasn’t in regular contact with any of his university or army pals. Greg seemed like the most available option.
“John-“
John often felt at once underestimated and idealized by his friends. Sherlock did that too, considered him not as capable in thinking, but being somehow above others in terms of goodness. Which was, of course, untrue. John was not better than other people. He could be quite petty, even to the point of being cruel.
They were rained in and Sherlock was going mad. He must have marched around their whole flat a thousand of times.
He liked to think it was because he was drunk at the time. It was an unusual situation anyway. They went to drink with the new recruits placed under Lestrade’s wing. John was initially surprised that Sherlock wanted to take part in something like this, but then Sherlock leaned down and whispered he suspected one of them of triple homicide and had to collect more data.
John could hear the devilish smirk in that asshole’s voice. He barely managed to react when Sherlock’s hands tried to untie his bathrobe, and he was completely naked underneath. He pushed himself away, turning in Sherlock’s direction. He tried to do three things at once: chastise Sherlock, put some distance between them and fix his bathrobe, and it caused him to lose his balance. In a flurry of movement, Sherlock caught him and pushed him back to sit on the counter, next to the laptop, immediately getting all up in his space. It was so expertly done that John was seriously impressed.
They really had very little food while on cases. John was short of ideas when he noticed a bowl with whipped cream made yesterday by Mrs Hudson and only left here because Sherlock apparently liked it very much, though John had never seen him eat it. He had no other choice really, so he took a chance, taking a bit into his mouth. He wasted no time in getting back to Sherlock and holding his head, passing the sweet substance onto Sherlock’s tongue. Sherlock didn’t let him get away, playing with his tongue, licking all of the cream off. By the end, they were both panting.
John was never docile, never submissive, but he felt compelled to allow Sherlock to do whatever he wanted. And the conclusion was simple: Sherlock had fucked up his mind.
And reach Sherlock did. He kept his movements slow, touching the side of John’s face first, watching John as if he was something fascinating. His hand tipped John’s face a little higher while he moved on the pillow, close enough to kiss John again. He kept the kisses languid, but there was a sensuality underneath, and it made John’s heart leap in disagreement with his still foggy head.
“I brought you dinner because I want you to eat well. But yes, you might say my objectives were a little more than that.”
His jaw was tired form how wide Sherlock forced it, from how much he invaded it. Sherlock moved his weight more into him, and his body touched John’s erection dead on. John moaned around Sherlock’s tongue.
And just like this, he lifted John, who quickly tightened the hold around his arms. He knew Sherlock was capable of carrying him such a short distance, but the position was embarrassing. Then again, this was a man who just sucked him off. Maybe John shouldn’t be bothered about the wrong things.
“No, I have someone else in mind. We will check later.”
The vibrator is actually smaller than a cock, at least his cock, and Sherlock’s as well, as far as John could tell from the feel of it against him a couple of times. It was still quite long and most people used a smaller, finger-shaped one as their first anal toys.
“You will look stunning?”
John was getting a bit reddish. He hoped Sherlock would deduce it was from the hot water, but there wasn’t much chance of that.
John’s body seemed boneless. He wanted to go to sleep but managed to remember that he shouldn’t be a selfish prick.
“Anything. The point is that I have you close, Sherlock,” John answered Sherlock with his earlier words, running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
“John.” John shivered, even if Sherlock’s voice was as deep as it normally was. “Sit on the bed.”
Sherlock rummaged through his dressing room. John had no idea what was in there, one again overwhelmed with the idea that he didn’t buy it for himself. Maybe Sherlock just wanted to make him look stupid? Wear something clownish?
“How about truth or dare?”
“Leaving a sign of possession” Sherlock answered when he let his neck go.
John wanted to fire just to prove Sherlock wrong, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to. Even if this was just a dream, even if it was some strange ghost invented by his sick imagination, he still couldn’t kill him. Sherlock had the same certainty in his eyes and it pissed John off.
John resumed the movement of his hands down his chest, sliding one hand to cover Sherlock’s on his stomach and entwine their fingers. Sherlock seemed momentarily taken aback and John turned his head to bump his nose against Sherlock’s cheek.
Taking care of all his plants and animals and improving the building had taken him a long time and he didn’t even realize when fall came. Lestrade came to visit him when it was still warm and he was impressed with all the work John put into the house. They spent a few evenings drinking beer and grilling, and once again, John loathed to watch another one of his friends go, but he got used to this self-imposed isolation, returning to his duties and his frequent walks to the cliffs and along forest paths.
Honestly, he only used it twice. The first time was because he had a really bad day and Sherlock emptied their whole kitchen of anything eatable. Well, not Sherlock exactly, in reality his homeless informants ate everything, but it was the detective that told them to ‘take anything they wanted’.
“Get out.” He barked, closing his eyes with irritation.
He didn’t expect Sherlock to take off the silicone structure and he didn’t expect to come while it was still not completely off him, but it made him shout. It was the most painful orgasm of his life.
John kept his eyes closed, so he only felt Sherlock moving away from him. At some point, he must have caught Sherlock’s head, as his fingers were gripping his hair. He let go quickly, opening his eyes.
He kissed Sherlock while ridding the toy faster and faster. At some point he just couldn’t stand it anymore and used his hand to bring himself to orgasm, shouting into Sherlock’s mouth.
Two years can change a person, and John considered himself very different from how he was when he lived in London. Slowly, unnoticeably at first, he had started to return to the personality he had with the other. It was strange how he was different before Sherlock and he was different when he was gone, but when he was there he felt the most like himself. Sherlock just made him live in the present, even when they didn’t particularly do anything. At first, Sherlock rarely went away to London for cases, working more as a distance consultant and spending time in his home laboratory, but when he did, he refused to part from John, so they had to hire a housekeeper to take care of their home and the animals. By this point, she had her own cottage next to theirs, that John took part in building, his old construction friends from Eastbourne noting that he was much jollier with his boyfriend around. John loved cases, he loved to write them down, but he did not rely on them as much as he did before to make him feel something. Sherlock made him feel plenty of things on his own.
“Can’t I tell him I’m taken?”
Sherlock didn’t tell him why they were going to South Dawns, so John assumed there was a client there. He was still in the dark when they arrived on a visibly abandoned patch of farmland, with a half-ruined house in the middle. He looked at Sherlock, waiting for an explanation of what exactly they were doing here.
“Oh, it seems kind of like a waste of money, doesn’t it?”
“Would you like me to join you?” It seemed that no matter what John said, Sherlock ended up amused.
John had been blindfolded before. He also had his hands tied before. The blindfold is a velvety, long piece of fabric, probably bought for this very purpose. His hands are tied behind his back, but it would be possible to free himself if he so wished. He’s not planning to, there isn’t much he wouldn’t let Sherlock do to him in the first place and he did promise to take the punishment. For now, it doesn’t even feel much like a punishment: he’s naked, blindfolded and tied on Sherlock’s bed. It sounds more like fun actually.
Did he blackmail you?
“No,” he says instantly in a stony voice, “John, I don’t allow it.”
Sherlock didn’t answer or even look at him, but John could see his self-satisfied smirk.
Anyway, this chapter was short, but the next one will be longer, and it should arrive soon, as I'm finishing up the last two chapters.
He reached up to cup Sherlock’s face and was meaning to kiss him, but it felt wrong to do that at this moment, somehow. He ended up putting his head against Sherlock’s arm, hugging him lightly and that felt right; warm and comforting.
John exhaled furiously. It wasn’t really unprecedented, nor was it strange, for Sherlock to run off into danger on his own, but John had hoped they passed that phase already. He had hoped Sherlock would think twice about what would have happened if the bullet didn’t just graze him. Even if it was selfish to imagine Sherlock would suddenly start looking after himself because John was in his life, that didn’t mean John couldn’t be angry about it.
“Kiss me.”
“Take off your clothes and get in.” Sherlock suddenly said to him, without a hint of embarrassment.
Sherlock gave him a pretty neutral question, thankfully.
John’s whole body moved forward when Sherlock’s lips landed on his ass-cheek, his hand tugging on the other one, opening John for the air. His fingers and lips were so close. John wasn’t sure if he wanted to make Sherlock remove the cock cage and then put something, anything, in him, or just get right to it when he begged.
“I hate you.”
He puts the vibrator in a bit and it’s too much. Without preparation, John could have hurt himself. He thought about it, but his desire for pain is satisfied with just this and he does not like to see himself bleed. There are many ways to experience pain and this one would not have been satisfying, he can feel it now, with how full and intense this already feels.
“Your body still seems tense. Isn’t there anything I could do about that?”
“Whatever you want, baby,” Sherlock answered teasingly and John already regretted his choices.
“That’s your own fault, idiot,” he got out from between squeezed teeth.
“I could have taken your card.”
Sherlock smiled.
Oh damn, if Sherlock wanted to play, John would play. Sherlock could go bankrupt if he so wished, it would serve him right.
The second part of the concert was just as good as the first one and John was mesmerized the whole ride back in the cab. He was going to go right to sleep but Sherlock stopped him. He made John sit on the couch and took out his violin.
He could hear one of the officers say: ‘pay up, Anderson,’ and Lestrade warning that if any news of this got to the papers he would fire all of them.
Sherlock let him go, and John stopped against a glass right before the girl in ropes they saw earlier. She was being spanked by another woman, surprisingly dressed quite normally. The spanked girl made eye contact with him and smiled. He could see how much she liked it.
Tom possessed a sort of dry humor and John found his intelligent sarcasm attractive. Making him let down his guard was a slow and interesting process, but ultimately very satisfying. This was not the sort of guy that was easy to pick up, John could have chosen a much easier pray. The problem is that he didn’t want to.
John felt so hot and so hard, but mostly, he felt vindictive.
John hoped Sherlock was done, but then came the scarf. It was a nice scarf, with squares different shades of blue and grey. If possible it felt even more intimate, especially that John suspected Sherlock didn’t need to be quite this close or lean quite to the level of his face to put it on. God, no wonder there were so many rumours about them.
“He also stipulated that the moment you put on this ring you lawfully become his fiancé. And he asked me, personally, to give the ring to you, if he did not manage to do it before his death.”
For example, he initially planned to let that incident with ‘Daddy’ remain forgotten. He really did.
“You stopped the elevator?” John made his lips into a thin line. The most important thing was not to let Sherlock know he was excited by the prospect.
Wow, every time I write a new chapter I feel like it's the worst one. Anyway, the next chapter's gonna get a bit dark, just warning.
“Slowly, John,” he hears Sherlock’s command and he heeds it.
Sherlock practically dragged him through the red door. John was curious what was inside before, but when he saw, he wanted to go back. They were in a corridor with glass walls on both sides. Some of the glass had curtains behind it or dark rooms but there were some that showed the inside of the rooms.
“John, you must meet with me someday, so I can tell you all the embarrassing stories from his youth.”
They stayed like this, swaying to the melody Sherlock started humming for them. John wouldn’t be able to shake the feeling of dancing even when he laid down to sleep next to Sherlock’s warm body.
“Your father wanted you to be manly. He taught you that wanting things that you do not need is selfish and something that a man shouldn’t do. I observed you. You might be fine with getting gifts on occasion, but you never buy anything luxurious or impractical for yourself. And yet you do think about those things you don’t need. You perceive it as a weakness. But you also see it as something forbidden, something … exciting.”
“Oh, were you? Because, it seems to me, Sherlock, that a self-proclaimed genius would be able to come up with a million different ways to get information out of that man. And yet you chose this one. You know what I think? I think you’re trying to confuse me with your mind games, though I cannot for the life of me guess why. And you know what? I’m not just going to sit quietly and do whatever you want me to do. You have weaknesses and I’m going to use them against you if you’re so set on making a fool out of me.”
“And you chose me? John, I’m divorced, do you think I’m an expert in relationships?”
“In a minute I will leave you and you will go to the bar to order something. The man will talk to you. You will tell him about your friend that told you about him that he met last Friday. Try to coax as much information about the killer as you can. Flirt, but not too much. You have a master already, it would be suspicious if you were too willing.”
“I think he’s trying to make me look stupid.”
“Where did your Mister go, anyway?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How do y- ah!”
“What is the point of this, Sherlock?”
With that he freed John and they proceeded to go home. The whole way they were silent, Sherlock fuming and John too embarrassed to talk.
Nonetheless, John was still shocked to see their hotel. It was a structure of luxury wooden tree-houses connected by bridges. It must have cost a fortune and the hotel was full of guests for the ceremony. John was very glad it wasn’t Sherlock paying for all this for once, he was fairly sure that would need another of his international security jobs to ever afford.
As soon as the case was solved, things changed. Well, nothing was actually different, except for the fact that now John had all the time in the world to overthink it. He tried not texting Irene for a while, maybe her distorted ideas about relationships wouldn’t seep into his head that way. Not that it worked. Sherlock was his usual, bored-between-cases self, but sometimes he looked at John in a way that was entirely too intimate for John not to notice it. Maybe he always looked at him like that, John wouldn’t know, he wasn’t a genius detective who spotted every little detail.
He clicks the third setting to prove his point but the sudden increase makes him jump up. He reaches down to catch the handle and moves it slightly down to disconnect it from his prostate because the constant stimulation makes him go mad. He moves it back in, imitating the movement of a cock pounding in and throws his head back.
“Why did you give me a watch? Why did you give me all those things?”
“No.”
“You don’t have to do this.” Sherlock said instead, looking curiously at John. Testing him.
“Come on, let’s go.”
John pushed his hands away. He really wanted to hit Sherlock’s stupid face but overcame the need with exceptional strength of will.
Thank you so much for you who leave kudos and comments, I love reading what you guys think.
“You planned everything, huh?” John sighed.
“Fine. Punish me, then. What are you going to do? Spank me?”
“You know each other?”
“I want to thank you in some way. Do you want something?”
“Truth or dare, Sherlock?”
Sherlock chuckled next to his ear.
Even his hand wasn’t able to stop the sound that it evoked. Honestly, John was just happy he masturbated before this because coming at this point would have been embarrassing.
They didn’t ride a taxi, but a slick black car. Sherlock explained that the club was rather high-class, so they had to arrive like rich people. This once John was happy for Sherlock’s horrible spending habits, if only for the black glass separating them from the driver. The less people saw him the better.
Sherlock’s face changed imperceptibly, but he was pleased.
Not that John had much of it from the beginning.
“Every day that I have you so close but can’t do the things I want feels like a punishment,” Sherlock said, his voice deep and beseeching.
“No, just … wear underwear. But let me choose it too.”
“How do you feel?” Sherlock asked with morbid fascination.
John was often unaware of what caused Sherlock to act the way he did and this time he maybe could have realized sooner, he admits, but how was he supposed to know? Who could ever understand what went on in that brain? Anyway, John feels he should not be blamed for not realizing some things sooner.
“Fine,” John let his body fall forward a bit, predicting that Sherlock would instantly maneuver himself to be his support. He could fall asleep like this, in Sherlock’s arms. “I should go to bed.”
He almost spit it straight at Sherlock when a woman with nothing but ropes on passed next to their table and disappeared somewhere behind a red door.
Normally, John would probably somehow let it go. But that day he had to cover for two other doctors, he was exhausted and hungry to the point of being in tears.
Sherlock made a low sound in his throat and moved his hands to John’s waist. He tried to push John down on the couch but John caught his wrist and straightened his body.
“But before me?”
The sound of a car arriving on their driveway pulled him out of his equilibrium.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice was hoarse, making John shiver. “Truth or dare?”
Before Sherlock could say anything John grinned. Someone should have taken the alcohol away from him.
Sherlock talked excitedly about the music and John let the sound of his voice and the wine relax him. He returned to the auditorium calmly and reacted in no way whatsoever when Sherlock entwined their fingers, except to close his fingers on Sherlock’s hand in return. So what if Sherlock wanted to hold hands as if they were two twelve-year-olds in the cinema? John didn’t lose anything by it.
“Shame. I quite liked it. Truth.”
And Sherlock did eventually reach it, but only to give it a little kiss, before raising to give John another kiss on the mouth, holding his cock in his hand in a manner that was teasing but not enough to make John come.
Now, two days later John was looking at the Rolex on his hand. It must have been quite expensive. Could this even be called a ‘little gift’? John felt queasy. Something was wrong. Something was definitely, horribly wrong and he started suspecting what it was.
Sherlock smiled at him and kissed him again. John was almost going to push him down to give this attention to another part of his body, but Sherlock did it on his own, dropping down to his knees once again.
“I know. I was thinking more than one.”
“No way.”
“Well, I’d wager it was Italian. Though he certainly didn’t look like one.”
John laughed.
He sat in his chair for over an hour overthinking everything and yet still not coming to any conclusion. Only when he heard Mrs Hudson steps on the stairs he raised up.
When John suddenly felt Sherlock’s hand caressing his spine he couldn’t stop his back from straightening and Sherlock’s smirk only grew. Shit, it was now impossible to hide how much it all affected John.
John stood up from his crouching position and raised Gladstone to Sherlock’s face, making the detective run away.
“It’s fine.”
“Like what you see?” he asks and snickers at Sherlock’s heated gaze.
“Turnabout is fair play.”
“What? No, this is a present.”
It wasn’t about that. If he left now, he would be a coward.
“Impatient?” He asked, but very soon he had no way to form words, just unintelligible sounds.
His whole body was shaking uncontrollably and Sherlock was patting his hair and shushing his sobs and John was so far outside of his normal state he could do nothing but cling to him. The blindfold was off, his wrists were free, but he still felt bound. Only when Sherlock kissed his teary face all over, he calmed down a little.
The detective suddenly stood up and moved into his space. If he was going to move a centimetre closer John would definitely smash his idiot face. He might be taller but John wasn’t going to get intimidated.
“What?”
“Fine. I don’t care.”
So the first time, nothing really happened. The second time, however, he might have gone slightly overboard. And by ‘slightly’ he means that he completely fucked up.
“What do you think, John?” Sherlock asked him exasperatedly.
His throat was sore from making all kinds of noise and his body was thrashing with every new bite or suck he received. He really regretted not being gagged. Sherlock was relentless in making him feel the most painful kind of pleasure and John was only thankful he couldn’t see him, so he didn’t have to remember the image. He knew it would haunt him. He never wanted to come so badly in his life. He was quite sure a moment longer and he will lose consciousness.
“Fantastic! Ask for my number from any Holmes, if Sherlock won’t give it. Now you two must excuse me, my friends are waiting.”
Sherlock looked taken aback, which gave John immense satisfaction.
“No,” he bit the skin, “this is not a reward, John.”
John wanted to fight him, but the finger in his ass was moving and making him weak with both shame and pleasure. He blinked when a second finger joined it without any warning, but managed not to close his eyes. Sherlock was kissing along the side of his face but his eyes went frequently to look at his in the mirror and the sharp gaze made John breathless.
John does it, but the little movements quickly become too light. He switches to the second setting without any prompting and Sherlock notices.
. How could he give Sherlock such a promise?
“Why, don’t you like the name?”
That instance, there is definitely very little pain, the muscles inside him crave the silicone warmness, relaxing and closing around it. By the sixth setting John forgets why he started it, forgets he isn’t completely alone, moves his hips, and reaches a point too close to coming to even open his eyes and look at Sherlock. He feels very focused on himself, on his body, and the only thing interrupting him is Sherlock’s sudden voice.
) before he crashes on the bed, ruining the silk with the mud on his coat and shoes. He doesn’t care, and neither will Mycroft who is on his way to pay the bill and collect the stiff whose bodily fluids are slowly soaking the cream carpet beyond repair.
He bangs his suitcase on the sofa and turns around with a sort of pirouette to stare at Sherlock lying on his bed.
He considers asking Mycroft if he actually loved their mother. If he felt any emotion but respect and dread towards the woman who pampered him and provided him with everything he could hope for while his younger brother by seven years barely warranted enough attention to get a glancing look when the nanny dragged him into the room to tell her he had bitten one of his playmates.
In the summer, they would hide themselves in the Trevors’ immense garden, lie down in the grass and feed fresh dates to each other. The stickiness of the fruit mixed with the sweat from the heat of the sun and their love-making would attach them together until they ran, clothes and all, into the small pond surrounded by maple trees in the heart of the garden.
He was never careful, always disappointed when he woke up the next morning, shivering and nauseous, but alive. And brain still in place, ready to tear him apart when he had just put himself together again.
The object of her desperation is a bomber, a nasty one at that. In the past six months he has blown up a government officials building (something Mycroft came over to talk about while John was out and which Sherlock dismissed with a shrug of his shoulder while with the other he tried to gesture his older brother to leave the same way he came in), banks and an unused underground station.
A lone bird sang its evening tune in a nearby pine. The ant had moved on.
Now he is free to look when John doesn’t see. Irene was right, he has known where to look the entire time, just not if he is allowed. Molly said the same, he always looked sad when John didn’t see. Because he wasn’t allowed to show his emotions, not allowed to look at John the way friends never look at each other.
Sherlock’s threat of walking away butt-naked gets him nowhere since Mycroft promises him he will let him, and he probably would, but John interferes with the kind of gentle voice that has never been used to stop their fighting before,
They are sitting in front of a fire on the sitting room rug, blanket drawn over them both, their legs tangled together, John’s toes tickling his beneath the folds of the blanket.
“What do we do?”
He grimaces. Even he can hear how lame, how fake it sounds.
“I am not going anywhere,” he says to Sherlock’s horrified expression.
“Say hello to the darlings!” a cheerful sing-song voice calls from the other end.
“Surely MI6 has to have several other candidates better than me. People who are actually currently on the army payroll.”
He looked like a hunter.
“We went to the zoo on a school trip when I was ten. Some of the boys cornered me by the wolf cages, climbed on the fence and threw me in.”
“Sherlock!”
John huffs out a laugh and looks at his watch, checking how much time they have left.
Then he remembers himself and snatches his hand away. To his surprise, John reaches for it and entwines his fingers with his.
If Watson still dreamt about the horrors of the war, it was a mystery as to why he had chosen to continue to keep close to it by working as a doctor in a military hospital. There was also the military gear he had clearly kept for sentimental reasons as well as his easiness with firearms.
“Kind? No, Sherlock,
“Breakfast,” the doctor orders. Sherlock makes a face and a noise through his nose.
“Why can’t I do it here? Why do I have to go in the middle of nowhere?”
But he could not understand the intensity of the dreams that came when John finally succumbed to sleep on the fifth night. Only when he heard John say his name in the throes of a nightmare he began to think of the people John had lost, friends and lovers, people of his past he never shared with Sherlock.
, Sherlock begs silently.
The next day, he is taken to a part of the hospital used for treatments and directed to a large white room with things he does not want to look at and a large window to an adjoining room and John standing behind it, his hand pressed against the glass.
“The Gibran case. That still on?”
he must have become to do something like that. Sherlock freezes but Lestrade is there, red with anger, and he sends Anderson home on the spot, in front of everyone. Later John tells him that Lestrade has made an announcement in front of his team, saying that whoever has a problem with Sherlock or anything that comes with him, whether it be flesh and blood or a figment of his imagination, can close the door on their way out.
