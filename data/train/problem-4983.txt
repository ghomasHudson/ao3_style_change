“Well that seems a bit unfair,” said Pepper. “You’re throwing Steve into the shark-infested waters of the 21st century dating pool without being willing to dip a toe in yourself.”
“I’d never be weird about something like that, Tony,” sed Seve all blushing bcause he’s closeteded (AN: AN: don’t u fik gay guyz r lik so hot! HOMOSOPES FUCK OFF!!!!!)
“Ah, I see Tony’s still the kind of guy who kisses and tells,” said Hammer with a chuckle that set Steve’s teeth on edge.
“But Strange said this magic is also unprecedented, right? He may not know. And what’s rule number one of espionage?”
"Hey, quick question, what does it mean for my sexual orientation if I'm considering third base with an anthropomorphic swimming pool?" asked Clint.
“What’s the problem, honeycake?” said Tony, looking at Steve as they all filed in the room. “Is it the booze? I’ve never done karaoke sober but I’m game if everyone else is.”
You grab at Steve, but he’s strong enough to push your hand away and run down the length of the hallway. Behind you there’s the sound of your other fight-friends shouting, but your quarry is in your sight. He runs to the large room you recognize as the one that can take you to the quiet place. You do not want to go to the quiet place. You want to smash Steve. You’re about to turn away, not taking the bait, when you feel something else hit the side of your head: a shoe, thrown by Steve.
You’ve been quiet for almost forty-five minutes, which I don’t think you’ve ever done, even in your sleep. What’s wrong?
Yeah, but if I didn’t tell you that, you’d still be doing your Forrest Gump impression five miles down the road.
“Oh,” said the tech, relaxing slightly. Then she added, “I guess this is just a typical Friday night for you, huh?”
“Would Howard have gone with me to that poetry slam? Would he have stayed in a wing of a museum that made him upset because I had to draw a picture of a painting that
“So sorry to keep you waiting. I had a meeting run long, you know how it is,” said Hammer with a conspiratorial wink.
What followed was, in theory, a lot of fun. Everyone took turns throwing back shots (except Steve and Bruce, the latter of whom never had more than one drink per outing for obvious reasons) and belting out what Steve guessed were all the famous pop tunes of the last couple of decades. And Bruce was right, they were a motley mix of great singers (Tony) not horrible ones (Bruce, Nat), and piss poor ones (Thor, Clint), but none of that mattered compared to the sheer cheesecake bravado everyone brought to the mic (especially Bruce). And Steve was filled with that same sort of fond detachment that he’d felt on the few times he and the Howlies got to cut loose and celebrate. It was like he was surrounded by people he cared about deeply, but there was a pane of glass between him and everyone else. Back then he’d chalked it up to being their commanding officer, but now? It wasn’t just that he was sober and most of them were drunk, and it wasn’t just that they were singing and he wasn’t. He just felt… displaced, like a puzzle piece in the wrong box. And whatever puzzle he’d originally belonged to was long gone, even before he went into the ice.
“Why can’t I be the one to ride in the wagon?” Thor joked. He was wearing a lesbian pride flag like a cape that a “group of magnificent shield maidens” had given him to wear today, because “lesbians for Thor” was definitely a thing and Thor was more than happy to enthusiastically embrace every kind of new Midgardian friend, especially ones that shared his appreciation for good-looking women without being creeps.
Rhodey was in town for a week, which meant every dinner in Tony’s calendar that week was booked. Tonight it was their favorite hole-in-the-wall ramen restaurant, which they’d sworn on pain of death never to tell anyone about so the tourists would never find it.
“I don’t think that was the reason. And if you haven’t expelled the root yet, you’re not kissing me now because you finally believe me.”
“Oh, yeah,” said Tony. He looked around, and saw that the others were standing a ways off, so he turned back to Steve and said, “Listen, whatever those buttons are, I hope you know I’ve got your back. If you need to try on new pronouns or new clothes or anything else, I’m here for you, and I’m not going anywhere.”
Then Steve had his eyes closed, his forehead pressed against Tony’s, and his fingers in Tony’s hair, stroking gently.
“We’ll take it from here,” said Clint. Then he looked to his left, where Thor was hiding with him in the empty floor of the office building next door to the Hammerplex.
“Well clearly they’ve hacked it, you idiot!” Hammer shouted. “Now get out of my way, and tell the entire security team to clear out their desks, all of you are fired.”
“And you’re starting the hat phase of your life with a baseball cap that says ‘Ask me about my fuck machines’,” said Bruce.
“Heyyy buddy,” says Nat carefully. “It’s good to see you again. I know you’re here because you thought Bruce was in danger. But he’s not. I swear to you, he’s not in danger from us.”
“I want you to trust that sometimes I know what you’re signing up for better than you do, Steve,” said Tony. “And that I know
who could break into the Tower like you did. And it’s not just anyone who could convince their evil boss to tip off the good guys that he was up to no good.”
I realized while I was writing this chapter that I never actually confirmed my hunch that the Cloisters was built after Steve would've gone into the ice and... yeah. Oops. Oh well, Buzzfeed made a mistake in this universe. I guess I could've hypothetically sent them to another, newer museum, but if you can't tell this fanfic is "Gogglor sends fictional characters to all the places she can't go during the pandemic," and boy do I miss the Cloisters.
“I’ve felt this way long before the spell, Tony,” said Steve as he reached up to caress Tony’s cheek. Tony still wasn’t making eye contact with him.
“This whole list thing was your idea. And it’s working so well that it’s having unintended positive consequences. I never thought I’d have to tell
(AN: Stap Flaming m sersious if u flam it menz ur a preep or a posr! Natsia hez a HT on hr floor bcuz se work 4 Hydra n dey set dat up.0
“Breathe with me, ok?” said Steve, and he immediately started to take big breaths in and out, his broad chest expanding and contracting rhythmically under Tony’s cheek.
Rhodey wasn’t in town and I didn’t have that kind of relationship with you guys yet. Especially you.
Tony walked over to the men’s room and waved at Steve to follow him in. Tony confirmed no one else was in there, put a “Cleaning in Progress” sign outside the door so they wouldn’t be disturbed, then pressed his palms together and put his fingers to his lips.
It felt like something solid shifting around in his chest. Something large and long that touched every part of his lungs. And the moment Tony realized what it was he was feeling, he started breathing
“Yeah, but you’re so much more than that. You’re Steve Rogers. You like to draw with charcoal pencils, and you’re fluent in sign language, and you think the jedi don’t use the force to its full tactical potential, and your accent comes out when you say ‘chocolate,’ and… um…”
“Do all the Avengers have this many inside jokes as you two?” asked Doug, because apparently the conversation couldn’t be about him for a second.
But before Tony could apologize for what he said or for thinking of Steve as divine punishment, Steve said, “I’ve got nothing else going on tonight more important than you, Tony. So why don’t you tell me about your day?”
Fight-friend Tony bolts for the hallway before you can grab him. He’s slippery, but not very fast. He seems to be trying to get you to the little room that takes you to the big quiet room, but you grin with the knowledge that he won’t make it in time. Just as you reach out and almost close your fingers around him, he banks right, through a doorway and down a set of stairs. You take a moment to tear another Hulk-sized hole in the Tower to barrel after him, and then another when he goes through another door two floors down. By the time you catch up, he’s in his shiny shell, and he’s firing hurt-light at your face. Which, of course, makes you furious.
“It does if you’re egomaniacal and evil,” says Bruce. “I mean, she could’ve meant something else, but to me that sounds like her stroking her own ego with a hint she thinks we’re too stupid to get.”
“Help yourself,” said Steve, who started walking over to the corner of the room to begin depositing the 5… 10… 15 broken punching bags down the garbage chute specifically reserved for this purpose.
Ten minutes of explanation later, all Natasha could say was, “Thor is never going to let me live this down.”
“Look at that, same page again,” said Tony as he dug his fingers into the waistband of Steve’s pajamas.
“One of the main reasons most people have friends is so we can have people who’ll comfort us when we’re upset.”
“K-kiss me already,” Tony demanded breathily, afraid that he was going to start begging if Steve held out on him much longer.
“I was saving my appetite.” Tony pulled a face but accepted the bottle. Fluttering his lashes, he squirted some lotion into his hand and made a production of applying it to his neck. “Come on. Admit it. Rubbing aloe vera on me was the highlight of your existence.”
“Hello, Anthony.” When he continued to stare at her in immobilized shock, she insisted, “Where are your manners—aren't you going to invite your mother in?”
While Tony obviously knew that the teen had drawn him once before, he’d been teasing. He hadn’t truly thought more drawings would exist.
I want to thank you guys for all the awesome and supportive comments/kudos on the last chapter. I won't get specific, but I received some pretty aggressive flames in another fandom for taking too long to update in the past...but this has been a vastly different experience and you've all been nothing short of wonderful and I've really enjoyed posting/writing this so far. So thank you so much.
A whirlwind of recent events surfaced in Tony’s memory, bombarding his senses. He saw Steve assisting him through his panic attacks. Supporting him as he learned to overcome his fear of the water. Defending him in front of Killian. Telling Tony “
He sucked until he could tell the alpha was becoming too sensitive and reluctantly released his spent cock.
Tony held himself in check until they’d reached the back of the waiting area—it was less crowded there and offered up a modicum of privacy—before rounding on Steve incredulously, “Care to clue me in on what you were thinking back there, hotshot? Cause I’m
Tony fell silent, nonplussed. Her question had cut to the core of him in the way only a child’s innocent curiosity could.
“Still proud of me?” he slurred darkly, full of self-loathing. His throat was so sore, it hurt to talk. “I warned you, didn’t I? Told you I was damaged goods.”
“You don’t have to,” the teen pledged gruffly, like he had to be damn sure Tony understood him. “I know they teach omegas that it’s your job to keep us satisfied, but that’s all a load of bullshit. You don’t have to give me orgasms to keep me around. Or to make me happy. Or because I'm an alpha and you’re an omega. I'm here because I want to be. I couldn’t take it if...if you weren’t enjoying yourself—”
Tony understood, logically, that assigning blame was pointless. He knew, on some level, that he wasn’t at fault. But it
It was extremely uncommon for an alpha to let their omega mark them in return. And although Tony knew a hickey was in no way the same thing as a mate mark, he was suddenly having a hard time seeing a difference.
Pure satisfaction soared through Tony whenever the alpha reached orgasm. Nothing felt better than knowing he’d pleased his alpha. Than knowing the thick ropes of come lashing his tongue were all for him.
The alpha’s eyes narrowed slightly, as though he wasn’t satisfied with getting a shrug for an answer, but he let it go. “You hungry? You need to get some food in you after last night.”
Tony’s cock sprang out, full-mast and eager to greet Steve. His slick was pulsing out of him in such large quantities he was already soaking the bed sheets.
Steve was a powerhouse. He had big, solid, athlete hands. It wouldn’t have taken much for the alpha’s grip to turn painful—for him to sprain Tony’s wrist like Obie had so many times before. Yet for all his brutal strength, Steve’s touch was unerringly gentle, and Tony was surprised to find that it sent something that felt an awful lot like rightness skittering through him.
Rhodey was unmoved by his fluttering. He just shook his head and let out a long-suffering sigh. Suddenly, a shadow fell over his face as his eyes pinpointed a spot on Tony’s neck. “...Is that a hickey?”
“You’ve been marrying off your toys for hours. Don’t you want to do something else? It’s a beautiful day. We could go to the pool,” Tony cajoled.
While initially stumbling with the unforgiving pace of Nat’s choreography, Steve had gotten the hang of it in little time. Before they’d left, he’d been spinning around the pool like an acrobat from Cirque du Soleil.
Wanted him so much it was making him dizzy – and was going to activate his pheromones if he wasn’t careful.
“I don’t want to ‘work my way up’ to anything. I want to rip it off like a Band-Aid and be done with it.”
He loved feeling the alpha in his mouth. Having that impossibly hard length hitting the back of his throat. How Steve’s big body would shudder and his hips would buck. The low groans and praise that would fall from his lips whenever Tony did something he liked—which was basically everything.
If another alpha had tried to crowd Tony like this, he would’ve felt trapped or scared. He would’ve fought against it. But this was different. Tony knew that all he had to do was ask the teenager to stop and Steve would listen.
“Smell me,” he said frantically, once they were a safe enough distance away. Peering around Darcy’s shoulder, he snuck a glance back at the man. Luckily, the blond’s attention was already off of them. The alpha was blowing his whistle at two kids who were wrestling in the pool.
“The alpha I was with before...he...uh, wasn’t real understanding of the word ‘no’.” To put it mildly. “Omegas aren’t people to him. We’re property. And property doesn't get to have an opinion.”
They wouldn’t believe a word out of the mouth of a disgraced omega. They’d call him a tease. A whore.
Her sniffling grew louder. “I don’t want you to die! I don’t want mama and daddy to die! I don’t want
“…I live here,” Steve said, as if the answer should have been obvious. It was the first time Tony had seen him out of his lifeguard uniform. The alpha was wearing khaki cargo shorts and a blue t-shirt that, while baggier than his lifeguard tank, did nothing to hide his muscles and only made his eyes look even bluer.
Perhaps the request was perfectly innocent. Maybe Steve really did just want him to fix his little brother’s tablet. Afterall, the teen had countless women (and most likely just as many men) throwing themselves at him every day. What could he possibly see in Tony?
Steve leaned back, his fingers going to Tony’s hair. “That’s it,” he urged, as Tony coughed and coughed, retching on chlorine and stomach acid until his airway was finally clear and he could greedily suck a breath into his lungs. “That’s it. Get it all out. You’re okay, baby. You’re okay.”
“The shallow end hasn’t been working out so well, either. Are you sure you don’t want to try going to another pool?”
The beta—Amara—was older than Tony and Darcy. Tony guessed she was in her mid-30s. She had emerald green eyes and was wearing a string bikini of the same color. Her smile was as fake as her spray tan.
Despite all that, a sick part of him yearned for Steve’s attention; wanted to preen under the teenager’s gaze. He’d even spent extra time in the mirror that morning, trying to tame his thick, short brown hair before realizing what he was doing and stomping off. And no matter how many times he told himself that he was only returning to the pool for Nat’s benefit, he knew it was a lie. He was turning into a goddamn omega cliché.
And just like that, Tony was done resisting. “Okay. I guess we can cuddle some more. As long as you never tell anyone that I said the word ‘cuddle’ out loud.”
Tony wasn’t making it easy on him, either. Steve's touch turned him mindless. He was all over the teenager. Sinking his teeth into Steve’s bottom lip. Rubbing himself up against the teen’s big, hard length. Calling him alpha.
“My doctors hadn’t thought I’d live very long, either...we’ve got that in common. We beat the odds, you and me. I always knew you were a badass, but now I know you’ve been a fighter since the day you were born.”
Braving the storm, he at long last stopped pushing away the full brunt of grief that resided inside him, and allowed himself to feel it. All of it.
He could see now that Obadiah had been threatened by him. Scared that Tony would end up better than him at his own job.
“So…” Tony blew out a frustrated breath. “What about you? What do you like to do in your free time?”
“Perhaps temporarily. But I do not suggest taking more than the recommended dose, Tony. So get that idea out of your head now. It would be extremely unhealthy.”
Tony wished he could be annoyed by Steve’s overbearing commitment to taking care of him. He was an independent omega, after all.
After meeting the alpha at the pool, his body had suddenly come alive again. Now here he was, antsy and keyed up. Desperate for some kind of relief and equally as determined to ignore it.
She was too busy staring off into the distance to care. “Does it look like everything he does is in 1080p or is it just me? He’s better than Baywatch.”
Tony sputtered. “That hurts,” he said with feeling. “I take strong offense to that. I am renouncing you as a friend and blocking you on Facebook.”
“Let’s get one thing straight,” Tony informed the teenager. “This isn’t a Netflix and Chill situation. When I invited you over to watch
Tony bristled. He thought of Steve coaching him to breathe through the bathroom door. It shouldn’t have bothered him, but he didn’t like Rhodey calling the younger alpha a douchebag. “He’s not all that bad. He seems like a pretty okay guy, especially, you know, considering he’s still a teenager and everything. He’s definitely less obnoxious than most.”
Tony rushed to intervene with Steve right behind him. “What happened?” he asked Natasha. Nat had a bit of a problem with lashing out in violence, sure, but she wasn’t one to do it unprovoked. “You know you aren’t supposed to push people.”
Sure, the media liked to spread fanciful tales about some ‘lucky’ omegas being able to ‘sense’ their true mates, but Tony knew that was all bullshit. It was a concept made up by Hollywood in order to make money off of gullible romantics. And it definitely wasn’t what was happening to him now.
The alpha was there with Tony through it all, calling him “good boy” and lavishing him with praises. Guiding him through the storm.
“Sit down,” Steve instructed, going into Protective-Alpha Mode. “You’re having another panic attack. Do you remember the breathing exercise I taught you last time?”
He released Steve’s collar and slid his arms around the alpha’s neck. “You’re right. On some level, you’re right. I haven’t let you touch me because...because it’s not just compliments I’m not used to. It's anything. Anything good.” He’d convinced himself he’d been breaking free, but he was still hiding. Still letting his personal demons have too much power over him. “And I've been...I've been letting that hold me back. But I don't want to let it hold me back anymore.”
“Broken bones don’t kill,” said Natasha as she kicked Tony squarely in the gut with enough force to knock him a few feet back towards the tree.
He was near the top of the ladder when he realized with a groan that the first person who’d track him down probably wouldn’t be Natasha; it would be Steve. If Tony so much as grumbled at the cereal choices in the kitchen, Steve tracked him down to ask if he was ok; there was no

“Cap, I think you’ve got a sudden urge to sing coming on!” said Tony when he finished, which made Steve laugh and roll his eyes. Then Steve looked at the little tv screen with the lyrics, and took a plunge.
They continued on like that for a few innings, with Steve periodically saving Tony when Doug started droning on and on about war time propaganda posters, and Colleen cracking jokes and talking with Steve about their respective jobs. Or trying to at least; Tony was interrupting them a lot, to the point that sometime in the fourth inning Colleen was clearly getting miffed. Tony had that effect on people who didn’t know him like Steve did.

“Nothing,” said Bruce. “Hey Thor, remind us all to pick up more chocolate crinkle cookies when we revisit your floor.”
“Tony, I’m sorry,” said Steve, who was practically jogging to keep up. “I messed up, and I’m sorry.”
“Sorry, continue, detective,” said Steve hastily. The green energy was now dissolving everything outside of the room.
“I invented new pigments just to get the stripes in the right color without the lead paint, you know.”
“No, Nat. Just some evil magic making us do stupid things, but nothing that bad,” said Tony as he held out a hand to help Natasha up.
“Get a team up to my office, now!” Hammer shouted at the security guards at the front desk, phone still to his ear.
“Got it in one, doc,” said Tony as he hopped down off the medical table. “Now, if you’ll excuse me—”
“What’ve we got?” asked Tony as he scrambled away from the heap of blankets on the floor and toward the armor assembler.
you. And you managed to get all of his brains without the quarter inch fuse we all assumed came with it.”
“Thanks, you’re a peach,” grumbled Tony as he shoved Steve’s ruined hat in his pocket and snatched the fedora out of the PA’s hand. “I’m getting the fuck out of here.”
“Then apart from me needing to do a little more reading on raising kids in a mixed-religion household—”
“Oh boo hoo I have an uncontrollable urge to kill people” just join SHIELD like the rest of us, asshole.
Thor sits on top of a refrigerator eating pop tarts. The fridge has on it a drawing of Tony signed "SR", magnet letters that spell "CLINT," and various magnets, and a sticky note that says 'Buy More Pop Tarts! Bruce climbs on top of a TV that shows Enchantress peeking out from behind a tree. Tony and Steve are in the vent over the ceiling. Steve is looking inside a cookie jar and frowning, Tony is looking up at a spider.
“Nope!” said Tony as he turned over to face Steve head on, “JARVIS, raise the blinds a bit, I want to see my blushing boyfriend’s face.”
And Tony told him. And once he started telling him, he couldn’t stop. He told him everything that had happened that day, the big and the small. Every single pebble in the rockslide from hell that had buried him. He glossed over the parts starring Steve but otherwise he just… let it all go. And Steve for his part knew exactly when to ask questions, when to poorly stifle a laugh (because yeah, some of it was funny in hindsight, even Tony was chuckling a bit), when to grumble or tut sympathetically, when to be quiet and listen. Tony had no idea how long they went on like that, but when he finished he felt wrung out. Still pretty crappy, but much less overwhelmed and weighed down.
There’s a small porch shaded with an overhang with a bench placed against the exterior wall of the JAILHOUSE. CLINT is already sitting on it, doubled over with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, breathing hard.
You decide to ignore the weird line about choosing your own adventure and reply, “I don’t think that would’ve turned out well for any of us, Tony.”
“Exactly,” says Tony, as he writes a quick list of the Avengers section of the tower on a scrap of paper. You look at the paper and read:
“Don’t care. She’s not invited to my birthday party,” said Tony, barely finding the energy to rub his wrists.
“Not pointless at all, Steve,” said Nat, after she delivered a spinning kick, “I’ll be ready when you are.”
Feeling them up? I was checking their buttons and pockets and earrings to see if they were the artifact.
A few seconds later, they’re back in the kitchen and Tony’s saying, “Bruce, did you see that paper Connors just put out on folding space?”
“Bruce has an eye-wash station in his lab, but you’ll have to get in line behind me,” said Tony bcuz he had a cruss on me 2.
“Steve tried to force you somewhere you didn’t want to go,” says Tony as he reaches down to help you up.
“It doesn’t matter! I’m the team leader! What the hell is the point of having a team leader if you’re not going to follow their lead?”
“No, we are not having the ‘let them figure it out for themselves’ conversation again, Nat. They are literally wearing a couples costume right now for Christ’s sake! We are past the realm of the hilariously un-self-aware and we are now in dead fucking center of maliciously obtuse. And Steve, I honestly don’t know why the fuck you’re pining like some princess in Avengers Tower but if Tony hasn’t sucked your dick yet after almost a
if you don’t start trusting that sometimes, I know what the fuck I’m talking about, Steve. And now we’re fighting so loud that the guy on my left just stared straight through my SEP, so how about we part ways to scream into some pillows and call today a catastrophic failure. No! Pun! Intended!”
STEVE pulls away from PEGGY a bit, turns, and sees sex worker BUCKY BARNES (mid-30s, loyal, daring, stubborn) step out of the open WHOREHOUSE door as well.
Steve talked about his ma the rest of the way down, and kept going as they stopped in the gift shop to get a book on the Guggenheim’s architecture and a sufficiently cheesy magnet for the communal fridge. And Tony listened, albeit with his mouth. He must’ve asked a hundred questions, and cracked just as many jokes about what Steve’s mom must’ve gotten up to at her job if she was that brilliant and spent her life making shoes.
“The hell it doesn’t,” said Steve. “You show up, Tony. Half of caring about other people is showing up. The other half is paying attention and… Christ, you pay more attention than anyone I’ve ever known. I think that’s why we couldn’t be friends for so long. I hated how easy it was for you to see straight through me. At the helicarrier, I’d barely learned your name and you were already picking on my biggest insecurities. I can’t hide
“Tony,”  said Steve softly into Tony’s ear, making him shiver. “I know for a fact you’ve only got one red woolen scarf. And it’s the one I made you for Christmas.”
it is! If I hadn’t come to Midgard, not only would Loki never have attempted an invasion, but Enchantress wouldn’t be here settling a millennia-old score with me. I am a danger and a menace to everyone on this planet and the moment this is over—”
“While that is certainly a likely scenario, Sir had also neglected to sleep for forty-eight hours prior to last night. Just as he neglected to practice basic hygiene over the past seventy-two hours and therefore did not remove the widow-bite compound,” said Jarvis.
"My Chemical Necromancer" is the second best turn of phrase in this fic, but I'd understand if you want to stop reading now and just ride that one out.
“Are you with me, Tony?” said Steve kindly, and Jesus Christ, Tony had literally broken the man’s nose maybe four hours ago and here he was acting like Tony was the one who was hurt. How was Steve even
“I’m taking a nap, J. No one’s allowed in the lab unless it’s an emergency,” said Tony as he walked over to the couch. Maybe this day from hell would go by faster if he slept through a chunk of it. But of course, the second he got comfortable and felt himself drifting off, the tower sirens started to blare, which caused Tony to start so violently he tangled in the blankets and fell onto the floor, landing painfully on his funny bone.
“Sorry about that,” said Tony, “Bit of a hazard when you’re out with an Avenger. But we can still catch the game.”
I had made these cookies for the picnic, although they can certainly be enjoyed on any occasion. And it turns out that picnic was not quite cancelled. I was informed by my friend Bruce that the spirit of a Midgardian picnic is in consuming food somewhere outside your typical eating places. Not being Midgardian, I took him at his word, but I did have to nix his suggestion that we lay down the blanket in the tower’s elevator. Between myself and Steve, we simply wouldn’t fit! Then Steve suggested we take the elevator to the gym, but I really didn’t want a smelly gym to be the backdrop for eating sandwiches and
“Stop, Steve,” said Tony irritably, pressing gently back against Steve’s chest. “Just stop. What you
“I know you too, Tony,” said Steve with a smug little smile. “Not as well as you know me, but I’m catching up.”
here, Tony, and I know that’s practically lunch time for you but some of us are CEO’s who take breakfast meetings with investors and—”
Me: *Kisses. Then mebbe we mak out LOL HES SO HAWTTT!! NEway, stop flaming or I wil cut u! Fangs for da liekz, u goffs wo r reading u da bomb.com!!!)
,” Hammer muttered to himself down in sub-basement 2 as he came up to the vault entrance and put in all the biometric data and combinations he needed to get it open.
And just like that the pre-battle buzz was gone, because no, Tony was not punching teenage girls if he could help it, today or any other day.
“Depends. Can you protect my family? Not just from him; I’m guessing you know how chummy he is with the Sokovian mafia.”
Tony felt his feet take him over to the proverbial scene of the crime and he ducked under the police tape to have a look around. There was a small crater where his suit had landed, lots of trampled grass, and that damn oak tree he’d had to fight around. It was all the same as he remembered. There was nothing new to explain Tony’s persistent questions.
“Well, 'sure' is a strong word, but… yeah. I think so. If I’m wrong, we can go back to searching in earnest, but I don’t think I’m wrong.”
Then it was time to step off, and walking down that street with his friends, surrounded a cacophony of pride flags and feather boas and love and identity of every stripe, Tony felt like he could take on the whole damn world. But the parade route was pretty long, and there wasn’t a lot to do except smile and wave, which meant Tony had a lot of time to think. And so, even though he had promised himself a thousand times he’d stop engaging in the habit, Tony turned his idle mind toward its new favorite obsession: Steve.
Steve had years of army practice in changing quickly, so he was out of his suit and into the janitor’s jumpsuit in the time it took Clint to put on the Captain America pants.
Steve pushed the glasses up his nose, silently blessing the hot-hipster invisibility effect, and made his way inside Hammer’s office, using the janitor’s access keycard to get inside.
His last conscious thought before he passed out was of something woody and stiff coming up his throat, and Steve shouting for a doctor.
“If you keep uninviting people to your birthday party, eventually it’s just gonna be you and Jarvis.”
Steve paused, then turned back around, sorrow in his eyes. And Tony knew he was the one that had put it there, and that alone meant… he had to try.
“Steven, Thor, my beautiful, gigantic sons. Today is the day you discover something very special,” he said.
Steve had spent the last twenty four hours agonizing over how to read what had happened in the kitchen, and now he had his answer. It really had been about the damned glitter. Tony wanted Steve to find someone else.
Thor, if this is the last time we face down someone on the team’s “unfinished business”, I’ll eat my bow. It comes with living our lives the way we do. And we’re a team, aren’t we? When it inevitably happens again, we’ll face it again like a team.
Instead, Tony took a few steps back, the suit floating behind him. Hammer stepped forward, opened the box, and rifled through the contents.
—on driving Tony home after the failure that was his first swim lesson and Tony was more than a little embarrassed about the whole thing. He hated the thought that he’d let Steve down almost as much as he hated himself for being a letdown. And while he knew it was pitifully needy for him to crave the alpha’s approval, he couldn’t banish the heaviness weighing down on his chest at the idea that Steve might be disappointed in him.
“Magical artifacts are often immune to their own effects. Suppose, for example, the artifact is an enchanted chalice. If there were a floor of the tower entirely comprised of swords, it is unlikely it would be able to change into a sword to disguise itself.”
into place on the other side of the door, and he turned to look back at Tony in yet another round of confusion, this time tinged with irritation.
The Puppeteer could’ve made it a much more difficult fight if he’d made her walk over toward the perimeter they’d set up to start puppeting cops. Tony sorely wished he could read the report with the results of her interrogation afterward, but he suspected it wouldn’t be all that useful. If she hadn’t been trying to talk to them through the bubble, she probably had a good reason not to risk opening her mouth. Maybe the Puppeteer had her family. Hopefully the police were sorting it out, now that they were both in custody.
, he wanted a drink. Which he couldn’t have, because Steve Rogers was a sexy, vengeful, all-American demi-god, and Tony would
“Please don’t do this, Tony,” said Steve, and despair was so raw it was like another brand new gouge straight in Tony’s heart.
He’d been six years old…and his father had been willing to let him die in order to teach him a lesson. To make him stronger. Less weak. Less of a disappointment.
“Right. Simple,” Steve said back, looking like he’d never heard the words ‘sensory feedback’ in his life. “Look, I was hoping you could help us out. We’re more than happy to pay you for your trouble. I wouldn’t expect you to fix it for free.”
“Oh, sorry, I—” he started to say, but the words died in his throat. Because the man he’d almost bumped into? It was Brock.
The air in the room seemed to change, Steve straightening up to his full height, and Tony knew his resolve was about to take another big hit.
Well, fuck. If Tony’d had any doubt that ‘someone a little older’ had meant him, it had just been obliterated. Apparently, Steve wasn’t even attempting to be subtle anymore.
So, no, he couldn’t turn off his attraction to the teenager—and, oh, how he’d tried—but being aware of it was a far different animal than acting on it. As long as he didn’t do
Tearing his attention away from the bot, Steve switched the full power of his gaze to Tony. “Babe, '' he said, blue eyes conveying so much happiness, wonder, and admiration that Tony immediately became warm all over, “you built me a talking robot. ‘Approve’ isn’t a strong enough word. This is the coolest thing anyone’s ever done for me.”
The sound of a chair scraping across the floor alerted Tony to Nat’s attempt to sneak away from the table.
He, Steve, and the kids traded some jokes and light chitchat back and forth, but, mostly, their group of four just basked in the easy, peaceful quiet as they enjoyed their ice cream.
“Oh no, I’m not falling for that trick, buddy,” he said hotly. Any friendship they might have had had just gone up in smoke. There would be no more fooling himself into believing that they could be just friends after
Something about the comment made Tony’s temper flare. He loathed the way his instincts practically lapped up the praise. He could never shake his inborn omega desire to please.
He was working on fixing Bucky’s tablet—and trolling Rhodey with more cat videos—when his phone lit up with a new message.
A blur of approaching movement snagged Tony's attention. An older, gray haired woman was walking up to him and Steve. Tony recalled her being in the ice cream shop with them when they’d placed their orders.
A longer pause. Rhodey glanced at Steve before focusing back on Tony. “For what it’s worth, he doesn’t look at you like it’s a fling.”
“I think you could’ve. You strike me as the kind of person who can do anything they put their mind to.”
Besides, it wasn’t like it was some big secret. Tony had done a poor job of hiding how damaged he was. Nobody reacted the way he did to physical intimacy without having some deeply upsetting skeletons in their closet.
“Uh, thanks.” Not what he’d been going for, but he’d look stupid if he didn’t take it. Accepting the jacket, Tony slipped the material over his skin. It was big and warm and smelled like alpha in all the best ways (and would get his pheromones going if he didn’t put a tight leash on them).
. Half-crazed. Like he was on the verge of losing it completely. His blues eyes were scanning obsessively over Tony, honing in on every detail, as if he could somehow commit every last pore, eyelash, and hair follicle to memory. As if his gaze could hold Tony there. Could keep Tony with him.
Steve let out a ragged breath. “I’ve been going nuts not being able to touch you.” The sheer need in his face was staggering. “Just a kiss, I swear. Nothing else.”
He told Steve about Obie. About getting pregnant against his will. Resenting his pregnancy. Accepting his baby—connecting with her—when it was already too late. Being taken to court and then being sentenced to become disgraced. Being given his brand.
Using his key to let himself into Rhodey’s, he waltzed into the living room. “Honey bear, I’m home.”
He’d gotten lucky. Brain cells didn’t typically start to die until around 4-6-minutes after being cut off from oxygen. The thought of brain damage was scarier to him than that of actually dying. He couldn’t imagine who he’d be without his intelligence.
“Do they even make lifejackets in your size?” Tony eyed the blond skeptically as Steve buckled the orange vest over his muscular torso. His shoulder to waist ratio should not have been achievable by mere mortal standards. “That thing looks like it’s going to explode off of you if you flex too hard.”
“Okay. I’ve got this,” he psyched himself up, even as part of him felt silly for needing so much reassurance for what should’ve been a simple act. “We’re going for a light, late afternoon dip. It’ll be great.”
STEVE steps back and puts one hand on the side of BUCKY’s face while the other is on his chest, the conflicting emotions of grief, joy, and disappointment playing over STEVE’s face as he touches his best friend and lost lover for the first time since he fell from the train.
Tony whirled around and said, “Give me three seconds to get changed, then let’s get the fuck out of here.”
Tony looked down at his feet and started doing that uncomfortable shuffle he always did when he was reminded of his and Steve’s age gap.
“Nah, that’s a different neurologist I was dating back in July. Not to be confused with the neurologist I got coffee with way back in February either,” said Clint. When no one said anything, he added, “Look, it’s impossible to spend as much time in medical as I do and
“It’s just... the pull was clearly coming from our own brains, and I’m not going to hold you to whatever my brain-pull made you feel was right at the time.”
You hear the lab doors open. In walk your friends Natasha, Tony, and Steve. All of them have that look on their face like they’re determined to get you to see some sunshine. It simultaneously fills you with warmth and twists you with annoyance. They’re always here like this, trying to look out for you.
“Of course it hasn’t. I’ve only just arrived,” said Tony with his flashiest grin. “Now give me a guest pass or whatever it is you do here.”
Tony scoffed and said, “Yeah, well, having absolutely mind-blowing sex with you the second you get back home has a way of shutting down some of the doubt that grows back every time you leave my side for five seconds.”
Pepper sighed. “We have now reached the point in this recurring conversation where I ask you to say all of these things to
For Steve to take what he wanted from him without a single concern for Tony’s own needs, like what Obie would have done.
Tony couldn’t get enough of being on his knees for Steve. His gag reflex was getting the workout of a lifetime.
Because Steve wouldn’t be here if he was getting fed up with Tony or losing interest. This had to mean that Steve still wanted him.
The teenager must’ve realized he had better ways to spend his summer than chasing after a disgraced omega. Honestly, Tony should’ve been surprised that it hadn’t happened sooner. Instead, he found himself seized by a panicked disappointment.
I hadn’t planned to leave it off there, but I had to cut the chapter for length because it somehow became the longest one I've written and I didn’t want it to be *too* long.
The word ‘property’ seemed to shock Steve out of the weird, aggressive mood he was in. He flinched, deflating.
They searched under arm chairs. They searched under rugs. They searched under tables, and labels, and mugs. They searched under pillows, and under bedsprings. They searched under archery what-cha-ma-things.
“Great. So you remember the part where they said, ‘Don’t touch people who don’t want to be touched.’”
IRL crime podcasters and monster fuckers would flock to Camp Crystal Lake like it was a Walmart on Black Friday the 13th. That many bodies would get law enforcement’s (and SHIELD’s) attention.
I’m not interested in your clothes. But I’ll put in all of my chips if you throw in whatever’s in your pockets, your gun, the buttons on your shirt, and the buckle on your belt.
Tony smiled and shook his head. “I know, Steve. And one day, if you don’t wise up to the fact that you’re dating an emotionally constipated crackpot with a list of issues as long as—”
“So, Steve,” said Pepper as they were walking out of the theater. “Was Tony the one who set you up on your date?”
“Everything alright down here?” said Nat and Steve had never been more grateful to see her in his life.
lose his shit in front of Steve, whether he wanted to or not. Before Tony knew it he was shaking. Not long after, he was hyperventilating. It was like he was outside his own body just watching himself have a breakdown, and he was powerless to stop the shaking and the gasping and… fuck, yep, the tears streaming down his face. The universe could not fuck him over any more than this, short of throwing him back in that godforsaken cave or killing someone. At this point, if the dead person was him, it might just be an improvement on this day.
was a really bizarre movie that had morphed into a sort of performance art piece, featuring performers and props and very lewd jokes for audience members to call out through the course of the movie.
“You always use a driver to get where you’re going, but that day you drove yourself to the aquarium. And we had to spend the whole time driving back to the tower clinging to the seats trying not to jump on each other at every red light. But we wouldn’t have had to do that if your driver was there, so where was he?”
“Because you’ve never practiced,” finished Tony. Tony spun back around on his stool and resumed working on the circuit board.
They were on their way out the door when Tony said, “Crap, now you know everything you could ever need to know about rib vaults and not a damn thing about keeping a date happy.”
“Purely for lack of money,” said Steve. “Ma was a spitfire. English wasn’t even her first language and she still talked circles around everyone she met. And everything out of her mouth was as smart as she was. I’m not the right person to judge intelligence but I think she would’ve given you a run for your money, Tony. She was more into the theoretical side of things, though, and it turns out there wasn’t a lot of money in being really good at geometry. Or if there was, it wasn’t a career path open to a poor Irish immigrant single mother in Brooklyn who got her education from the public library. But she used to read me geometric proofs like they were bedtime stories.”
“Yes, Tony,” said Pepper. “And this is the point in this recurring conversation where I point out that you and I
“I told you to go look at the other exhibits,” said Steve, without even looking up from his sketchbook. “There’s some Escher drawings in this wing, go check them out while I finish this. I think you’ll like his work.”
“I dunno, why do you think the guy who was blown up, kidnapped, tortured, held without his consent in a cave, and surgically turned into a cyborg might have strong opinions on what’s ok to do to someone’s body?”
CAPTAIN ROGERS exits the TURBOLIFT and runs down the HALLWAY. As he’s running, several ROMULANS transport on board in his way, and immediately open fire. ROGERS hides behind a corner, takes out his phaser and returns fire, stunning the ROMULANS in his way. He continues down the HALLWAY until he gets to just outside CARGO BAY THREE. Romulan CAPTAIN AMORA of the ENCHANTRESS transports there as well. She tries to fire her phaser at CAPTAIN ROGERS, but he immediately engages her in hand-to-hand combat. After some back-and-forth, they both tumble through the doors to...

Tony just sighed, which of course made him cough a few petals into his hand that he stuffed quickly into his pocket. No roots that he could feel though. Of
In a moment, Nat heard the faint hum of electricity starting up around her, and saw the lasers and motion detectors come back on in the vent below her.
Clint’s eyes flicked up to Tony’s hat and read the words on it. Then his face lit up like the goddamn fourth of July.
“No it’s not— well, it’s partly that,” said Steve. “It’s more that everything hinges on one person’s thought process. It feels so much riskier than anything we can punch.”
I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to give y'all this chapter today. Words/story by yours truly, art by a guest artist who asked to remain anonymous, but holy CROW what an unbelievably amazing job they did! Please leave them some love in a comment, they absolutely deserve it for the incredible work they did with my goofy little rhyme.
“I’d say I’m fine, but…” Tony opened the hand that was just over his mouth. It was full of white rose petals.
Tony,” said Natasha. “Look at Steve and really try to imagine for a moment that he’s saying what he means, and that he’s in love with you.”
“Yeah? You got something, J?” said Steve, who was now so awake he was sure he wouldn’t sleep for days.
A faint hum started coming from the ceiling, as JARVIS tried to determine whether the CEO that technically owned him or his maker had higher authority here.
Thor, you fly overhead with Natasha and we’ll meet you in town. Tony, Clint, each of you take a horse. I’ll catch up soon enough if I run.
“They — no. They’re robotic arms made to help with basic tasks. They’re not programmed for that,” said Tony insistently.
“No none of that but— but I want to help people. And I want to protect the weak from the powerful. For me I think that means I’m always going to have a dangerous job, Avenger or not. As long as it’s safer for me to be out there standing between the civilians and giant robots, I’m going to do it. Can you live with that?”
“Is he still whining?” said Natasha, slightly breathless over the comms. She’d been jogging around the Hammerplex up the block for the past two hours, and there was a
“Still writing ‘Mrs. Natasha Barton’ in little hearts in your notebooks, Clint?” Tony fired back. He was trying in vain to put some distance between himself and Steve on the common room couch, but Steve wouldn’t have it, always moving closer to Tony and using his hands to rub Tony’s back, stroke the back of his neck, smooth Tony’s hair,

“So bossy,” chuckled Steve as he stepped onto the suit’s boot, the scepter strapped to his back. “You better have the heat turned up high when I get back, this is gonna be a chilly ride.”
about their relationship after what Tony had put him through today. Also because Tony was pathetic and could never quite shake the feeling that everyone he knew only hung out with him because he was rich and brilliant. And now he’d basically said outright that he didn’t think of Steve as a friend, because of course he had. He was in hell. Warm, comforting, beautiful Steve-hell.
much of an idiot. At the very least he’ll put the building on high alert and tell them to keep an eye out for Avengers.”
PHILLIPS springs into action, immediately moving IVAN to a post and taking some rope sitting on top of a barrel to start tying his hands.
“Marsha, thanks for staying to chat, but I can take it from here. Good morning, General. Let’s talk MREs.”
As the security guard dialed up Hammer’s office and people around the lobby took very un-subtle pictures of Captain America in the lobby of the Hammerplex with their camera phones, no one noticed Natasha Romanov, dressed as an office worker, slipping through the gate with a stolen key card, moving quickly to get to her next position.
Eventually Pepper and Rhodey joined them and they watched the play, which Tony was sure was hilarious and well done, but Steve was sitting next to him and his thigh was pressed against his and it was
The lights dimmed, and a company profile picture of a young Hispanic woman with long curly hair and a cheerful smile filled the screen.
So Tony filled Steve in on the history and highlights of the Hitchhiker’s universe: the radio plays and the books and the TV show and the movie; the Vogons, Zaphod Beeblebrox and the answer to life, the universe and everything. He even threw in a few details on how it played into the larger picture of popular sci-fi (
The only thing you're missing out on by going to that link is the skin, which is intended to spoof mid-aughts fanfiction.net.
Tony squinted at the speaker in the ceiling. Usually he made fun of anyone in the tower who associated the ceiling with Jarvis, but from his current vantage point (still on his back on the floor), it was helpful to have something to scowl at.
“How the hell could I possibly keep a guy like you? You’re so… and I’m… you already know. Which means as soon as we get together, the clock starts ticking down until the day you can’t stand me again, and when that day comes it’s going to
Steve felt a weight leave his shoulders he didn’t realize he’d been carrying, and it manifested in a smile on his face.
Tony thought to himself as he listened to the other side of the manhole cover before moving it aside. It sounded like he was still in Central Park, so he wouldn’t have to be dodging any cars to get the hell out of the sewer. He was literally right in the middle of thanking God for such a tiny stroke of good luck when his arm brushed against something.
They wormed their way through a crush of bodies all asking for autographs and what not, but instead of making for the exit Tony had them push their way to the elevator bank. One of the elevators was smaller than the other ones, and had a velvet rope and an attendant in front of it. Tony held up his phone to the attendant, who then let them go inside. The second the doors closed, Steve released all the tension he didn’t even realize he was holding and sagged against the wall.
“How about you don’t and we never say you did?” Tony planted himself in front of the teen like a human barrier. “At ease, Rambo. No one’s fighting anybody and that’s final. We’re leaving. Jane, Thor, thank you for the hospitality. Great burgers. Excellent burgers. We’ll catch up another time. Sorry for...all this.”
“I won so many times, they asked me to stop entering in order to—and I quote—give the other children a chance,” Tony reminisced smugly.
He wanted all that glorious hardness inside him. Filling him. Stroking in and out of him. Making him come apart.
The teen’s words made something inside Tony hurt. It was a confusing and good kind of hurt. A kind of hurt he wasn’t used to.
Tony had spent most of his life feeling trapped, alone, or adrift. Like he had no real place in the world. Like he was so insignificant that his death or disappearance wouldn’t make even the faintest difference. The world would just keep on moving. And no one would miss him. Not really.
“...I wouldn’t say I ‘hated’ it,” he mumbled uncomfortably. He couldn’t let Steve think he’d done something wrong or that Tony had been an unwilling participant, because that wasn’t the case. “It just...can’t happen again. That’s all.”
He wasn’t in much of a mood to socialize, but it was better than being left to his own devices. Otherwise, he would’ve closed himself in his workshop and quickly driven himself crazy overalyzing and dwelling on his strained evening with Steve.
His instincts wanted the wall reduced to rubble. They pawed at him, whining in distress, begging to be let in.
The life vest quickly stopped him from being submerged, his body jerking as it buoyed him to the surface. The water was a pleasant temperature, neither too hot nor too cold, and for about a millisecond, he almost managed to convince himself that everything was fine.
“In the interest of not arguing—because I really don’t think I can handle doing that with you today—I’m gonna pretend I didn’t hear that.” He dragged in a breath. “Honestly, right now, I’m more concerned about what my mom might have in store for me.”
He wanted to ask her how she knew what the word pyromaniac meant…but, no, actually, on second thought, he was afraid to find out. “Right. We’ll go with that.”
“None of this means…” Tony swallowed, the apprehension in his gut upgrading to full on dread. There was one last thing he had to know. Something that had to do with the all too scary ‘M’ word. “He’s not...he couldn’t possibly be...this isn’t happening because he’s my...because we’re mates...right?”
“It’s alright, Natasha. I’m safe. I’ve conquered swimming. I’ve taken to the water like...well, like a fish to water. Ask our friendly neighborhood lifeguard. He knows.”
“Okay, I know what you’re thinking,” Tony rushed to add, “but I’m not making excuses. I totally intend on learning how to swim. Just…maybe not today. How about next week? Yeah. Next week sounds great.”
Tony didn’t know how he managed the level of willpower required to extract himself from Steve’s arms, or how he made it back inside his apartment.
Her green eyes were looking up at him with the kind of judgement free acceptance he’d seldom seen reflected at him.
“You’re welcome.” A few minutes of silence passed, but Darcy seemed incapable of letting the subject drop. “Don’t worry,” she said encouragingly, like Tony was Steve’s jilted ex-lover and in need of cheering up. “I don’t think you’re getting rid of him that easily. He’s too into you. If you’re this sad and mopey right now, he’s probably acting twice as pathetic. You’ll hear from him again.”
“Bucky’s bringing pizza?” Tony fumbled with the pot, almost dropping it on his way to the sink. “Bucky’s coming here? Now?”
Steve had accidentally demolished it. The metal bars had been bent into unnatural positions, crushed under the strength of his grip.
Tony couldn’t compute anyone having that depth of emotion for him. It didn’t make sense. Didn’t align with the way the rest of the world treated him.
Steve was continuing to be the exception to his every rule. There seemed to be almost no limit on what Tony would share with him.
“I think your parents might have something to say about that,” Tony told the redhead. “Now say goodbye to your friend. It won’t be forever. You’ll see him again.”
Ah, I hope this chapter wasn't a let down. I think some of you guys were expecting some action to happen but I want this story to be a slow burn.
Tony was too keyed up for Steve’s unhurried pace. He squirmed, unable to stay still, his restraint all used up. “Come on, Steve. Come on. What are you waiting for?”
Howard had wanted an outspoken, confident, alpha son. Not an anxious, hyperactive, fragile ball of nerves who was too timid to look people in the eye when he talked to them. Tony had overheard his father ranting to his mother about the embarrassment Tony caused him after one of their family business functions.
If he continued carrying on with Steve like this, there’d be no escaping his heat. His body was already changing, showing the early warning signs of an impending heat. His temperature was slightly elevated, his appetite had increased, and his sex drive was somehow getting wilder than it already was before.
Steve wasn’t wrong. Tony knew, in theory, exactly how to swim. His all-consuming, incapacitating fear had always been the real culprit holding him back. Still, did the alpha have to be so damn perceptive? It unnerved him that Steve seemed to understand him so well. “Wow. Sounds lame,” Tony denied, because he was still too emotionally repressed to take the path of least resistance and just admit Steve was right. “And what, exactly, do you propose we do if we’re not getting in the water?”
The alpha likely didn’t make a point of celebrating his birthday with every hookup who crossed his path. Maybe the nature of their relationship simply precluded Tony from being involved.
Steve was downright masterful with his technique, kissing with a skill that belied his age. He had just the right amount of tenderness and assertiveness and never seemed to tire of exploring Tony’s mouth. He’d stoke Tony’s desire to a fever pitch, then trail shiver inducing kisses down his neck until he squirmed.
“That’s it? You’re just gonna leave?” At Steve’s searching look, Tony told him gamely, “You can, if you want to. You can kiss me.”
Steve listened intently, eyes slowly filling with understanding and acceptance. Taking a breath, he said, “I want to be your person too. I want to take care of you.”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Steve said dryly, further prompting Tony’s suspicion that the teenager was somehow even more sarcastic than he was.
“No. No problem,” the young omega answered smoothly. He stepped out of line to introduce himself, a flirty, accessible smile on his face. “Hi. I’m Killian. I don’t know if you remember me, but we’ve met before. My older brother was on the football team with you. Number nine, defensive tackle.”
There was no way he was moving. He’d totally make fun of himself later for thinking it, but it was hard to deny how perfectly he fit against Steve’s chest. Almost as if the space had been made just for him. The alpha was such a strong, comforting pillar of support around him that Tony could feel a huge mass of tension releasing from his body.
Tony had been so afraid of getting attached, but if this hellscape of a week had taught him anything, it was that he was
This was becoming a disconcerting habit. He could hold a conversation with Steve without turning into a sex starved alpha groupie, dammit. He
“What a congenial lady,” Tony remarked sarcastically once the beta was out of earshot. “Something tells me she’s not your favorite person.”
He shouldn’t have shied away from the desire when it had overtaken him in his workshop. He’d made the choice to go all in and he was holding himself to that. He needed to take as much of Steve as he could get before the summer ended.
Tony willed himself not to make a face at the kid just as Natasha resurfaced from the water with a loud gasp. “Ta-da!” she flung her arms out, preening as Tony and Darcy clapped. Christ…the girl really had held her breath for 100 seconds. Maybe she was part fish.
“I know,” Steve said, not in the least bit sorry about treating Tony like a blushing maiden being taken to their mating chambers.
An unbidden image came to mind. For a second, he saw it. Saw himself with a bouncing baby on his hip—
Tony shuffled nervously as the two kids paired up and disappeared into the living room. The alpha’s presence felt even more daunting and inescapable than it did at the pool.
She was so brave, this kid. He couldn’t have been prouder of her than if she were his own little sister.
Tony’s ego had been hoping for a little more than that. Something akin to the alpha jumping at the chance. And then jumping him.
“You’re really committing to this whole ‘talking in third person’ thing, huh? I’d reevaluate that choice, if I were you.”
“I’m working full time for the summer and I’ve got a football scholarship to Empire State lined up for September.”
“That I hafta be careful with it ‘cause it’s messy,” she said guiltily. Her lower lip trembled. “Are you going to take it away from me?”
He was about to deny it when his phone pinged with a new message. Darcy shot him a smug expression, as if to say ‘See?’.
for my attention, and then you spit in my face when I give it to you.” His nostrils flared angrily and his grip tightened again—this time to the point of pain. “You’re awful choosy for a disgraced bitch. You omegas always think you’re too good for us, but from that ink on your neck, I know that ain’t true.”
So when a small voice in the back of his head tried to warn him that neither of them were doing a good job of acting like this was a fling, he’d been too swept up to hear it.
“I can’t stand alpha groupies,” Steve scowled once they were en route to the SUV. “Those same people wouldn’t have given me the time of day before I presented. Don’t let them bother you. They’re not worth it.”
Steve immediately tensed, letting out what Tony was pretty sure was an honest to god growl. “Did he—?”
“Tony,” the teen chanted, his voice awed and reverent. “Tony.” His fingers flexed on Tony’s shoulder. He seemed like he wanted to reach for Tony—to pull Tony towards him—but was unsure whether or not he had permission. “Are you—?”
The corners of Steve’s mouth quirked up at Tony’s comment before turning serious again. “I didn’t always look like this,” he admitted. “Things used to be…well, I’ll be honest…they used to be pretty rough. I was born with a bad case of asthma and a weak immune system. The doctors hadn’t expected me to live very long. They’d warned my parents that I was going to die almost every other day. I was allergic to everything, on a hundred different medications. I'd end up bedridden from something as simple as getting a head cold…and I was small. Smaller than all the other kids my age.” Giving his head a slight shake like he was bringing himself back from the past, he continued, “Presenting as an alpha saved me. My health problems seemed to vanish overnight. But I’ll never forget where I came from. Or how unbelievably fortunate I am.” Adding heavily, “Or how damned easily it could all be taken away.”
In Omega Finishing School, they’d had it drilled into their heads that their alpha’s wants and desires always came first. Omegas who didn’t see to their alphas' needs were letting them ‘suffer’ and were being bad omegas.
“That’s it, baby.” Three fingers now. Stroking him, Steve grasped Tony’s aching cock with his other hand. “Come for me, Tony. Come for me
Any plans he and Steve tried to make ended only one way: with the two of them tangled in each other’s lips again.
Everything in him longed for Steve. His instincts were crying out that he was incomplete without his alpha’s touch.
He didn’t wish that Steve had kissed him. Didn’t want the alpha to lay claim to his mouth and body until he was too lust drunk to remember why it was wrong.
It was the please that did it. Something about the alpha begging completely undid him, snapping the last thread of his control.
He needed it. Needed to drive out the memories playing behind his eyelids before they finished breaking what was left of him.
Though if Steve’s worst reaction to finding Tony on Rhodey’s lap was placing a hand on the small of his back, then Tony supposed he couldn’t complain too much. He’d let Steve get away with it. For now.
He didn’t want her to grow up with the same fear of swimming he’d had. If left unchecked, it would fester and get worse with time. She’d loved the water too much to lose it forever...so he and Steve had cooked up ‘Operation: Get Nat Back In The Pool’.
“Cavorting around town, huh?” Steve’s mouth was tugging up in that fond smile Tony had so desperately missed. “Does that mean you’re finally gonna let me take you out?”
If this was the way he treated all his hookups, he was going to end up with a string of dejected stalkers who were too head over heels to let him go.
Omegas couldn’t conceive outside of their monthly heat, which was why suppressants had been the best—and only—choice for him. He’d been able to avoid his heats while also eliminating all possibility of another pregnancy.
“Um, so…” a young sounding male spoke up nervously. “Should I call an ambulance?” It took Tony a second to recognize who the speaker was. It was the Not-Steve-Lifeguard. The one who’d been on duty when Tony had drowned.
“That reminds me,” Tony placed his hands on his hips as soon as the two of them were out of earshot. “No funny business in front of the kids. It’s not professional behavior when I’m on the clock. As far as they’re concerned, you and I are merely acquaintances. Possibly friends. Anything beyond that stays on the DL. I don’t need your mom coming after me with a shotgun.”
The onslaught of need—of connection, longing, and belonging—that came over Tony was as wild and overpowering as it had been at the pool. Which was bad, because it meant that it hadn’t been an anomaly. Meant that things between him and Steve would always feel this good. Always feel this right.
It was one thing for Tony’s inadequacies and his fear of the water to put himself at risk, but now his weakness had almost gotten Nat hurt.
“Stacy from school is misinformed. Someone should talk to her about speaking in absolutes. She’ll get in trouble for that later on if she decides to pursue a career in academia,” Tony rambled to buy himself time while he decided how best to answer. “Omegas don’t
God, why was that so hot? Steve was ten times stronger than him. He could break Tony in half like a matchstick if he wanted to. Yet he was allowing Tony to give him orders. To tell him what to do.
It was absolutely time for drastic measures. He had to do this. For Nat. And for himself. Even if the notion of doing something for himself was more foreign than it should’ve been.
“Yeah, right. Don’t pull the innocent boy scout act with me, Rogers. I know your tricks now. You’re using the kids as an excuse to spend time with me. Trying to worm your way back into my good graces.”
“Captain America. Steve. Our strapping lifeguard. I’ve bequeathed him with that title due to his red, white, and blue lifeguard uniform and because his little football-slash-swim-team friends are always calling him Cap. It fits him, don’t you think?” Darcy tapped a finger against her lips, mulling it over. “That, or Captain Handsome. Both suffice.”
“I bet they’re only together because it’s some kind of prank.” One of the girls was speaking louder now, as if deliberately trying to be overheard.
A burst of neediness had seized Tony. He’d sought to eliminate the distance that had cropped up between them; to reaffirm their closeness in the only way he knew how. He’d thrown himself at Steve, sliding his hand up Steve’s muscular thigh. Fingers playing with Steve’s belt, he’d shamelessly offered to give Steve his “other” birthday present.
When Steve predictably refused (because Tony had no chance of budging the most stubborn alpha in the world after his protectiveness had been cranked up to an eleven) Tony made multiple swinging grabs for it. The alpha easily evaded his inebriated attempts.
He tried to tell himself that the misery and yearning weighing down on him wasn’t real. That his omega instincts were playing tricks on him because they had some messed up idea that he and Steve were a strong match for making babies. That nothing between them meant anything.
“National Geographic has taught you well.” He straightened up. “Now go play. I’ll be here if you need me.”
He talked to Tony about football and gave him a play-by-play of his latest championship game. He told Tony about his friend Sam and shared some of the amusing jokes he’d heard from him. And he told Tony about his military father. How the man had inspected the corners of Steve’s bed every morning to check that he’d made it correctly, because his father had believed that accomplishing the first task of the day was the number one secret to success.
Because their eyes roamed over him like he belonged to them. Like he existed solely for their pleasure.
The alpha’s lids slid open. For a quarter-second, his expression remained unchanged. Then his gaze met the sight on the desk in front of him.
And it wasn’t like Tony hadn’t already let the cat out of the bag. Thanks to his tattling hickey, it was obvious to everyone with eyes what exactly he and Steve had been getting up to in their spare time. “You’re already here. Might as well stay.” Addressing the rest of the yard, “You can all stop pretending you’re not eavesdropping now. He’s staying. Looks like some introductions are in order.”
with Steve, but the evening had devolved into another make out frenzy, and now the credits were rolling on the screen.
coding, but apparently her family had picked up on the one interest and completely missed the other, and Olivia was thrilled to have someone she could talk to who knew what recursion was. Since then, whenever Pepper was in town for more than a few days, he’d take the whole family out to lunch somewhere mostly so he and Olivia could talk shop about whatever they were working on (Olivia had a real gift for coming up with stuff for code to do that was completely useless and
“Screw you, Tony,” said Steve, but he wasn’t meeting Tony’s eyes when he said it. In fact, he seemed like he was trying to fit his 6’4” height into his old 5’2” frame.
Tony ducked behind a bush and surveyed the scene. Miss Hot Topic 2009 was doing a good job keeping Nat, Steve and Clint at a distance with the frequency and intensity of the blasts her shield was emitting. Clint’s arrows, Nat’s bullets and Steve’s shield weren’t having any luck getting through. Bruce was nowhere to be found. It looked like Steve didn’t want to call in the Hulk for this one.
“Tony’s a perfectionist about his costumes, so he might be a bit. The rest of them are probably pre-gaming in the kitchen. Hey that reminds me, Thor has some Asgardian booze he swore could get even you buzzed and I just finished testing it to confirm it won’t kill you. Wanna come up to the lab? You look like you could use it.”
“Exactly! Strip out all the bullshit and people perform to connect with each other. Or with God, if you go for that sort of thing,” Tony said with a vague wave of his empty shot glass.
“Elevator’s that way,” he said with a point in the right direction. “You go on ahead, I just remembered I need to take care of something.”
On the other side of the room, among the racks of coats, was Natasha Romanov, tied to a rolling chair, hands bound and a thin stream of blood trickling from one nostril. Standing behind her was a goon with a gun pointed at her head. And there were two people now standing behind him.
“JARVIS, is the containment elevator ready?” says fight-friend Tony, who is not in his armor, but you recognize his voice.
too late to say ‘no.’ The world won’t end if you make a scene. Trust the guy who’s made more than his share.”
“That’s a pretty good list, hon,” said Steve. Then he paused as though he were thinking and said, “I think I might be able to pencil a few of these in.”
“But the LA County Museum of Art makes it worth it,” said Doug. “They’ve got a great wing on 20th century Americana.”
There was a tense silence for a moment, when Tony said, “Alright, first thing’s first: show me the scepter’s in the case.”
Tony thought, but he said, “Hey, are you sure this is enough potatoes? Pretty sure Thor’s going to need this many just for himself.”
“Let’s pretend it’s not magic for a second. Let’s say it’s something else proximity-based, like a bomb,” says Tony. “And it’s a really powerful bomb, but you want to be extra sure that it reaches all the floors of our part of the tower. Where do you put it?”
“She does seem like the type to mean it that way,” says Natasha thoughtfully. “So that rules out Thor’s floor, Bruce’s floor, and the Common Room floor, potentially.”
All in all, the experience was quite fun and memorable, no less because of these delightful little cookies. Now, a few tips concerning the chocolate:
“I can’t even remember the last time I did karaoke,” said Natasha. Then she added, “Well, that’s a lie. I did it in Tokyo in ‘09 at a yakuza’s birthday party, but that was at a bar, not a noraebang.”
Thor holds out mjölnir and gestures for everyone to touch it. You do, and feel a sensation that is equal parts extremely present, completely indescribable, and very easy to miss if you’re not looking for it.
“Tow it, I’ve got three more,” said Tony as he straightened his tie and practically skipped up the steps of the building in his haste.
“Some kind of project. Something that’s going to force us to spend time together, but when we’re ready to kill each other we can focus on it instead of us. Like—” and Steve watched Tony’s eyes light up with an idea.
Actually it’s mostly her biographers that speculate. And she plays coy about it every time someone asks in an interview.
“Mr. Stark has been liking or making comments on a large number of pictures on his social media profiles tonight. The commonality of all of them is that you’re in them, and I calculate the likelihood of that being chance to be less than two percent.”
“I still can’t believe you want to leave. After only an hour of people in spandex pretending to lick their own butt holes? You can go if you want, but that’s totally my fetish.”
Tony kept his eyes closed, but he could hear Steve adjusting his stance into something combative as he stared down all five feet four inches of their Hanahaki therapist, Dr. Mitchell, at the foot of the bed. Dr. Mitchell adopted a placating, but solid stance, and her ability not to cower before the wrath of Captain America spoke to her many, many years of experience and almost supernatural gift for sorting through emotions that she’d been practicing over the past two weeks.
“Look, if you guys are gonna lie to me like this, you’ve got to nail down the details a little better.”
“No, the part that didn’t sound like you was when your doppelganger said, and I quote, ‘Is there any amount of money that could make an exact replica of this scarf in any fiber that isn’t wool? This guy I really, really like knit this for me for Christmas and I love it, but I’m allergic to lanolin. I know it’ll break his heart if I don’t wear it, and I’d literally rather die than see him unhappy.’”
Tonu was laffing but then he stoped & he said, “Ok, now we’ve straightened that out, let’s go to the My Chemical Romance concert.”
“Well, some people have guideposts they want to hit at least. Do you want to… run for president, write a New York Times bestseller, become a foster parent, start a business, be a movie star—”
“If we include the roof, the containment floor is in the center, but I don’t think that necessarily means it’s definitely there,” Tony continues, as he starts drawing concentric circles starting from the containment floor and working outwards. “We already know this artifact packs a kick, so it could hypothetically be anywhere.
“Wow,” said Clint. “Count on Tony to catch a disease where being an oblivious idiot can actually kill you.”
“My guess is bruising, overexertion and dehydration, but I want to be sure there’s nothing worse. The Puppeteer had him fighting us pretty brutally for over an hour. Tony’s built for strength, not endurance.”
And without even thinking, Steve had his sketchpad in front of him again. After forty five minutes of sitting back in the shaded part of the courtyard, he had two whole pages of Tony making faces, Tony’s hands over his head making dramatic claws, Tony with his chin on his fist listening intently, Tony laughing. He’d drawn Tony from memory more often than he cared to admit but this? He’d treasure this.
Steve followed Tony’s gaze. Up on the giant screen, there was Steve and Colleen. They were framed in a heart labeled “Kiss Cam.” Steve turned to look at her, and while she was blushing a bit, she was already leaning in for a kiss.
“I mean, it’s a Tingler. It could be in his butt,” says Tony. “I’m sure he’d let Bruce search him for it.”
Props to everyone who guessed Steve's floor! As for what the artifact is, you'll have to wait just a little bit longer, or head back to chapter sixteen and see if you can spot it ;)
“Professional courtesy. You should be honored - that’s a rare commodity with me, according to Pepper. JARVIS, get me the schematics for the model 5 boot propulsion system.”
They went down the stairwell, and down past Clint's floor, down past their own levels, past the front foor. They went down until they could go down no more, down to the bottomest, bottom-most floor. And there, rure enough, was Clint all alone. And he sighed as he spoke in a somber-most tone. "Oh I miss all my friends who like places down low. But they are not here, I've gone low as can go!"
Bruce straightened up and said, “I’m sorry. Childhood trauma about lightning. But I’m in control. It’s alright.”
You lead them to the kitchen and make a stack of ham sandwiches, which everyone devours greedily. Tony, Nat and Steve all seem to be covertly whispering something to each other as they eat. Something about, “All of these options are terrible” and “Try them anyway.”
“You see, I wanted to date Steve but if I did that publicly all the homophobic preps and haters would come out, so I put on this disguise. But that’s why we need to hurry up and get to the concert. I can’t be late for my own show,” Said GERAD WAY OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!
But all of that was before they’d started looking at the actual art, because Tony was incapable of paying attention to anything longer than a fraction of a second unless it was a machine or a math problem, and the Guggenheim was short on both. They’d managed a peaceable equilibrium of Tony mostly playing with his phone while Steve appreciated the art, right up until Steve had sat down and broken out his drawing pencils.
Bruce shakes his head a bit and says, “It could mean that not only is the artifact not on Thor’s floor, but it’s not on the floors above or below it. The ‘more than a few steps’ might be the literal steps to another level of the tower,” says Bruce.
“Before I came here, Strange showed me an example of an artifact,” you say. “It was a book with a person trapped inside its story. Strange said he thought something similar is trapping us here in the tower. But… there’s a natural connection between a book and a story, right?”
“If it was a fancy hat we’d’ve had to check it at the door, like your ego until about thirty minutes ago,” Tony retorted.
everything he does is a worse version of what I do. So when it comes to the truly important things, he uses StarkTech.”
“No such thing, in our line of work,” said Bruce with a wry smile. “Anyway, thank you for the tour, but I should probably get going—”
I can't believe we're getting to the end of this monster fic. Thank you to everyone who's been along for the ride, the comments and kudos are all very appreciated. Coming up, the thrilling conclusion!
Tony and Clint probably would have gone on like that for much longer than any two adults should have, but Steve cut in with, “Tony, if you’re really alright, stand up.”
You are absolutely allowed to pick doctors/dentists/hair stylists/accountants/anyone you pay to take care of you that make you feel comfortable and respected.
TONY takes a moment to register the now unguarded want in STEVE’s eyes, then grabs the back of his head and pulls him down for a searing kiss. Not to be outdone, STEVE, walks TONY back to the wall next to the window and presses him against it. Both of them seem intent on kissing the life out of each other. The hooting of an owl is audible outside.
If you’re going to psychoanalyze my actions, do it properly. Who’d I take with me to the house of my lovers, Tony?
“Must be a bug,” Tony mumbled, praying to a God he didn’t believe in that it was a bug, and that Steve wasn’t talking about
Sarah Rogers is loosely based off a real person: Marjorie Rice. She was a home maker in the 1970's with only a high school education, but she contributed tremendously to a math problem we STILL haven't completely solved: pentagonal tessellation. That's what Sarah was referring to about "covering the plane" - some pentagons can "tile" in a way that completely covers a 2D plane and some can't. We still don't know how many of these pentagons there are or what kind of pattern there is to pentagons that can and can't tile. But Marjorie Rice discovered dozens of pentagons and tessellation patterns from her kitchen table.
Within a few seconds Steve was hurling Bruce’s rapidly growing frame into the elevator, which slammed shut and they could hear Bruce’s growls immediately diminish as it plummeted to the containment floor.
“He gets tunnel vision when he gets his mind set on things. Usually it’s tech or coffee, but sometimes it’s food. He’s not trying to be rude,” said Steve, a little defensively.
Asgard has a completely different conception of gender from Earth, so Thor's pretty much queer by default. Bruce id's as straight, but would describe his relationship with his gender as "he/him complicated." Anybody who dates either Clint or Nat knows the other one is one of the cornerstones of their life, that they're never going to live apart, and that's never going to change.
“We need to do a PR campaign with the kids so they know that I exist too,” said a yet-again-shirtless Bruce with a sigh.
For the first time since the fountain, Tony took in his surroundings. He was in a prison cell, but the door was open and there was a cop standing by, keys in hand. To his left was a cell with a couple of drunks and heavily-tattooed henchman types, several of whom were glaring at him like they wanted to start something but knew better with the guard right there. Seated on the bench to his right was Steve Rogers. He had two black eyes and a worried expression on his face.
Steve gave a tired smirk, then glanced down at the offending stitches near his left wrist and said, “I really thought I got the color match right this time.”
Tony also took a cup, but he was frowning at his. Steve showing up with a dessert in Central Park, where they were meeting up before heading over to see
“See, I’m glad we’re practicing, Steve,” said Tony in his normal voice. “Because we’re catching some amateur hour mistakes here. Most dates don’t like it when you tell them to shut up.”
“It’s gonna have to be quietly,” said Tony. “If Hammer managed to stay out of jail in spite of the entire damn world watching his robots destroy the Stark Expo, imagine how long he could draw out a court case and what he could do with the scepter in the meantime. Plus, ‘he’s too stupid to own an infinity stone, your Honor’ isn’t exactly a solid legal argument. Even if we got our hands on whatever evidence we’d need to prove he came by it illegally, that puts it in possession of the government, not us. Asking Hammer to give up the most powerful weapon on the planet will be a cake walk compared to asking the same thing of Uncle Sam.”
