But before he could get an answer from tony he could hear the distinct screeching noise his phone was calibrated to make in case of emergencies when he was not picking up his phone. The noise echoed through the empty house from the hallway where Tony had left their phones.
I finally looked at tony for the first time since we arrived at the party. He looked somewhat pale and very exhausted. The fine lines at his eyes crinkling more than ever. I was still holding him facing me and felt him sag into my arms listing completely into me like he had just lost all his energy. If I was not the one holding him I would have never noticed it.
He hooked an arm below Tony’s right knee pulling it up a little so the wound wouldn’t be touching anywhere creating more discomfort.
“Are you alright?” Tony asked cocking his head slightly to the left his eyebrows rising ever so slightly.
Steve was just about to close his eyes as he heard the slightest of whimpers from Tony and he was on his feet immediately,  hands hovering over his form
“Okay, now that everyone is up can we please get to the point. Here tony” natasha said handing him a mug as well, but Steve caught a quick peek to find that his was definitely not tea or coffee but juice and he made a face at it before taking a tentative sip.
“You cant have coffee until the drugs wear off completely” and Tony blushed hard suddenly remembering that he had just been through a rather embarrassing ordeal.
“I don’t think I will ever take your side on this, but I will respect your decision because I have realized something off late , that tony doesn’t let go like he does with you. I spent three weeks with him in the lab while he was getting more sick and he just pretended to be fine and then you walk in and he has a panic attack and gives in. So I know if there is anyone he trusts, it’s you. ” he said adjusting his glasses
That caught Steve’s attention, feeling somewhat better about the fact that Tony had not just been disinterested in his class but in all others as well. Steve had been going out of his way off late to get that boy's attention in class but to no avail.
Bruce was okay, there was no need for a code green, he had stayed on quintet monitoring everything from behind the scenes.
“ Why does everyone keep talking about protecting me? I don’t need to be protected!” he said with a tinge of irritation
“No honey, I am just glad you are awake.”  Tony didn’t look like he believed him but he was too tired to care .
Natasha was holding her wrist close to her ,protecting it . She had sprained her left wrist and sported a gruesome bruise along her right jaw.
“He wouldn’t give that up , he's already laundering weapons, besides we don’t know what rumlows play is in here" natasha was right
He unbuckled Tony’s pants , and pulled them off throwing them carefully down onto the floor and his eyes caught sight of the wet patch on his underwear.
“hey” he said softly instead , closing the door behind him again as tony jerked awake completely , now grinning at Steve.
“Help me Steve..help" he let out but didn’t move a muscle as he sat there trembling and Steve quickly dropped the railing on his side of the bed and sat down on the bed hand going to his face trying to comprehend what he was saying
“you are okay, I have you" steve repeated again and finally Tony mumbled something that vaguely sounded like
Steve found Tony and Clint sitting on the communal room couch or rather slumped over it holding the controls to their video games. Tony didn’t even notice steve coming in , but clint sat up a little straighter giving him the slightest of nods.
“I am not going with obie.” Steve only nodded his head not wanting to start an argument while Tony was this vulnerable.
Steve rubbed his back gently for a few seconds and pulled away “come on  ,let’s get this over with yeah?” he said tugging gently at the hem of Tony’s shirt to get it over his head.
“Everything okay between you and your friends?” he asked raising his eyebrow as Tony’s glare was suddenly directed towards him.
“everything that happened was by no means your fault. It’s okay that you are feeling like this, and we will get through it together I promise you sweetheart. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you here okay?”
“you are right, you can’,t go home like this. Best stay over” he grinned half-heartedly at him knowing he was playing dirty
Tony calmed down after five minutes of squirming before realizing that they were really only going to sleep.
“Can you skip gym? I need to talk to you" he asked and pursed his lips hoping Tony would give him the chance.
He gave an unimpressed  groan and Steve continued “he said you can leave the hospital today evening”
“we will be just fine" he pressed his smiling lips to Tony’s one last time before picking him up off the counter and just as he turned , the towel around Tony’s waist caught onto the counter pulling away from the both of them and Tony blushed pressing his face against Steve’s neck before Steve even realized what had happened.
“how are you okay? You were not okay” he mumbled to himself like he was trying to figure out something
“You think this is not a big deal? Do you realize that by not telling me you are deliberately letting someone hurt you? Is that want you want?” his voice was rising steadily and Tony’s breath hitched stopping Steve mid rant and he quickly moved to hug the boy but Tony pushed him away.
Steve removed the tube carefully slowly and Tony’s sigh of relief was such a beautiful thing for Steve to hear. The whole process took about two minutes and Tony held his breath the whole time with Steve having to remind him to breathe so he wouldn’t pass out.
“Yeah" Steve refrained from kissing him , even though he really wanted to. He spoke nonsense softly trying to distract him from everything,  kept it up for another ten minutes until he felt Tony relax completely,  his eyes falling closed as his chin dropped on Steve’s chest.
“no!” he said immediately and then more gently he said “ if I close my eyes I see the explosion and you unconcious”
“what is that?” he asked pointing to the bags by Steve’s feet and Steve picked them up and handed them over to him and Tony took it eagerly like a child on christmas morning and Steve couldn’t help but wonder what kind of christmases and birthdays he had been having all his life.
“Absolutely, anna you rest up okay honey? Your parents will be here in no time" she said before leaving to making the call
“Okay , so there are some pieces of information he has and some he doesn’t. We have to figure the moments we discussed them and what was common during those times or who” natasha said already thinking back .
Just as I started towards Tony I saw Bruce sit down next to him. Engaging him in some sort of conversation. Not even my serum enhanced hearing could pick up on what they were saying over the loud music. Tony has been sulking this whole time. But I was not able to get to him sooner, stuck in my obligations to greet everyone I knew.
"Do you want to go back to sleep? Come on ill lay down with you." I guided him back forward. Nat moved her hands to undo his sweat soaked shirt. Once the shirt was off , I Pulled him with me to lay down. Nat brushed a kiss on tony's head and they left the room silently.
“thanks” he said before giving her a quick kiss on the cheek and a lingering hug. By the time Steve made to the hotel he realized it was well past six in the evening. But he had promised natasha that he would rest for a while so he did even if it took him a lot longer than usual to actually fall asleep.
Tipping his chin up , Steve moved in closer, their lips almost touching he whispered “will you be good for me while I am gone?”
“better now, can’t believe  that happened"tony said his voice a little scratchy ,and Bruce chose that moment to walk on ,he stood at the door before he realised something was amiss.
But worst of all he had been up all these nights because he felt absolutely terrible that he had done it with his minor boyfriend. Tony was his to protect and Steve had done the exact opposite. It had played over and over in his mind and it was made worse because Tony had pushed him away.
“Are you okay with me seeing bucky?” he shrugged immediately like it didn’t matter but Steve knows how much it matters.
“Yes , the child of Howard stark” He conformed and thor not so subtly leaned towards Natasha and whispered (again not so quietly, not that it mattered because Steve has enhanced hearing) “I thought we were to keep the young man a secret from the captain?”
He quickly entered the room leaving the door wide open and trudged over to the bed like he didn’t want to be here. Steve watched silently as he squared his shoulders ,toed his canvas off and pulled his feet up onto the bed.
But apparently quickly wasn't working for him today because just as he got up his vision blacked out and he felt himself pitching forward and someone grabbed him before he smashed his face into his unfinished plate.
“Steve, round up call. Do you need me to take over?” she asked looking at him and he shook his head , he was the lead on the mission. He needed to be there for it
“I forgive you then” he said around his spoon and Steve shook his head while Tony shrugged like he didn’t want to have this conversation
They spoke for a while, but things were still rushed. But the surgeon seemed very confident and capable of pulling this off. He also seemed to have done his homework on the reactor which made steve feel like he was the right man for the job.
“You okay?” he asked and Tony nodded ,but that was enough and he moved gently , pulling out and Tony whined and writhed underneath him as Steve pushed back inside nailing the spot in his first try.
“target at 12 o clock" and Steve nodded subtly knowing she was going to chase him down. Steve stayed put , as Tony frowned at them both.
“so just to be clear , you lied about always being there for me right? You know what it doesn’t matter.” He said pacing his right hand worrying at the nape of his neck.
He was already getting tired and Steve thought maybe this was the perfect excuse to get out this conversation.
“He is quiet the smart alec, I’ll give you that” he said leaning against a pillar beside them and Steve silently agreed, refusing to think about how Clint knew what the two of them were talking about.
“No I have to go home" he said hurriedly looking suddenly afraid as he looked around for his discarded bag and shoes.
Things got better , eventually. Steve kept busy in school and tony seemed to be over his infatuation with Steve. He was doing very well in school, Bruce loved him. Tony and Bruce had taken to each other quickly . Steve often found the teen trailing behind Bruce as they both waved their hands around arguing about science.
Tony was on his feet in seconds a smile finally hinting at the corner of his lips as he followed Steve out of the gym. They walked side by side until they reached the parking lot and Steve unlocked his car motioning for tony to get in. He was just glad he got his car today.
“Steve, don’t do this to yourself” Natasha said as she closed the door behind her softly unlike Steve who had just slammed it.
“mr. Nelson called mr.stane to come pick him up  apparently because he was hurt and he’s already in the parking lot!” Steve cursed internally while Tony tried to jump off the bed.
“Slow down there octopus, you are going to pull out your IV” clint told him and Tony whined, he whine loudly shaking his hand out in front of Steve’s face
Steve tugged him closer towards him and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair once before leaning forward and kissing him softly on his lips. Steve could hear Tony’s heart racing from this close and he turned him around so that Tony’s back was resting on his broad chest.
“Look at me Tony” his eyes slowly rose to meet his and Steve could tell he had finally gotten through to him but there was more he needed to say.
Tony sighed his shoulders relaxing against Steve as he licked the last of the ice cream from the spoon.
"I forgot about them because of the invasion, not on purpose!" I snipped, slightly annoyed that Steve thought I would have had the time for this between everything that was happening.
Steve wasn’t sure how to handle Tony, all these days he had only seen one side of Tony- a very defensive sixteen year old, who was very smart for his age and seemingly acing the social skills among his peers.
“Okay, calm down we will get it out . I promise, the nurse is coming, it will be out in a minute” Steve told him as natasha left to go find a nurse faster.
“why did you think I was going to break up with you?”  he saw Tony stiffen a little before he shrugged it off
“good, I am very happy to hear that" steve said as evenly as possible and Tony frowned at him , a hand slipping out through the sheets to poke at Steve’s chest.
“okay, tell you what. I’ll stay here the whole time okay? Ill be right here. You just need to close your eyes for a little bit and you will be asleep before you know it.”
“Here, but go slow please" he said pushing the other cup towards him and Tony all but jumped happily as he reached for it.
“Mr Rogers?” he gave her an encouraging smile and her frown disappeared and she tried to get up but Steve held her down quickly by her shoulders.
Steve did take him for his pizza and waited patiently while Tony over chewed every bite. Steve hid a smile as he tried to deflect the conversation every possible way and chuckled when he insisted he needed to stop at a mechanic's to buy some tools.
“I am not feeling well , so I need you here with me" he mumbled and Steve carefully pushed him away to read his face but he didn’t see anything there other than the sudden sadness that seemed to have taken over him since he came back from the men’s room.
“You are okay , I got you" Steve said softly and that snapped Tony’s eyes back on him and he went from confused to fearful as he yanked his arm away from Steve’s and tried to disappear into the wall behind him.
It was starting to get frustratingly hard to get straight forward answers from him , so Steve squared his shoulder, held a hand out and said “up you get, come on”
“He is not going to be okay with that, I know, but if he stresses more then it would be harder on his recovery" steve disagreed with Bruce
“Bruce please tell me he is going to be okay" he said finally letting his voice break and Clint shifted closer to him as a sign of comfort.
Natasha got up and wandered towards where Phil had gone and Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair
“Balls don’t like me, they seem to have a personal vendetta against me” he shrugged and Steve was now definitely concerned as he remembered Tony’s posture earlier.
“was worried, I was constantly nauseous and -" Tony started but Steve scolded her “nat , he will be fine, leave him be. Now is not that time" even though he knew she was right.
He hoped tony would come out of this state soon enough , for three reasons. One it was his birthday and he hadn’t even realized it yet. Two cps could send an agent to check in on tony any moment. And three he needed to take him to medical to get him checked out . Last night was not normal and Steve worried about how often this has been going on and what Tony really meant by he can’t sleep.
“Are you seriously telling me you let him go back? Why would he want that?” he startled a little at the new voice , turning to see clint perched on a cabinet, legs swinging fingers turning a page on a suspiciously large file.
It didn’t take long , to get Tony checked out and situated in a room. The doctors had been very worried at how dehydrated he was and the lack of nutrition.
“No I am not, and that’s exactly what I am saying Tony. I don’t have a hand in this decision .” the moment Steve said it, you could visibly see the fight in Tony leave. His body sagging against his chair he covered his face with his hands , elbows on his desk as Steve waited , giving him some time.
“you got tony out here, you knew this would happen.” Fury, the goddamned bastard had the guts to smirk at Steve.
Right, so if Steve was dead the tracker would pick up on his cold dead body. He was actually glad Tony was not awake for this part , he looked down at Tony again just in case.
“I am okay Tony, I promise everything is okay” He said and Tony pushed away the food from near him to create space and moved closer to Steve allowing Steve to wrap an arm around his waist.
Tony sat in the far right but for once he wasn’t sitting with rhodey or pepper. They were sitting on opposite ends of the room actually.
He pressed a kiss onto his cheek and pulled his hand out from under his shirt but replaced it again over his shirt.
“Maybe stane taking him back is the best for all of us.” Steve murmured and Clint patted him on the back .
He was wearing one of Steve’s button down school shirt that he had left at Tony’s place and shorts. Off white (maybe pink) shorts that barely escaped the length of his shirt. And with the backpack he looked even more childish than normal.
“I am okay now , everyone can let go.” Tony said ,trying to laugh it off. It was a known fact any of us hated showing weakness in front of others and we all respected that.
Spotting the new kid immediately, a sharply dressed brunette , with brown eyes and eyelashes of an angel sitting in the far right corner with Mr.Rhodes. He let his eyes sweep across the class just one last time and smiled
“Yup" he said brushing Tony’s hair off his face. He had a crease running along the skin of his forehead from where he had slept on Steve’s shirt and he leaned down to kiss it.
Steve shook his head , “no, sorry . Just distracted. Do you have any free periods coming up? We can work on in then” he said just loud enough for Tony,  who was sitting atleast three tables away, to hear. Maybe atleast that would get his attention or get him some attention from his baby.
Tony didn’t look disappointed, infact it seemed like he expected it. But that wasn’t surprising because Steve had made it very clear to him that Tony was still too young for this.
The blast was very close to where Tony and Steve were standing , and they were both thrown a large distance colliding with a wall on the far end and falling to the floor. Steve only remembered gripping Tony as tightly as possible , and the intense sudden pain he felt at the back of his head as it collided with the wall and then just blacking out.
“Okay, what’s going on?” steve said finally his clear enough to understand that something was obviously not right here. Bruce and natasha had a very straight face, which itself told him it was not good news.
How would he tell him that the fun the two of them had had was mostly sexual? Steve was starting to panic a little a his current situation.
Tony was excited about the birthday because he would legally be an adult but Steve knew he had been terrified out of his mind because in Howard’s will , it was mentioned that once Tony was eighteen the company would go to him and Tony had admitted to him that he didn’t know anything about running a company.
“Sir, with all due respect, this is a museum of natural history and they are going to be very bored so there is not much trouble they can get into” he countered
“Lift your hips a little for me” he instructed as he worked Tony’s pants lower onto his thighs exposing the now very prominent bulge but Steve paid it no mind has he wrapped his hands on the perfect globes of Tony’s behind giving it a squeeze and Tony moaned into the kissed
steve swallowed not wanting to admit it “I did” but tony nodded like he understood why Steve was hesitating but Steve needed tony to know the whole truth
Well, at least he went to the nurse. If not anything ,Steve knew he was being looked after by someone “see? there was an upside to going to the nurse after all” Steve commented , folding his hands over his desk.
“I am sorry, I am just angry and worried for you. This is not okay tony, how long has this been going on?”
“you were so tired I didn’t want to trouble you and I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what they did to you” sadness washed over him like a ton of bricks and he just held him tighter.
I woke up to the smell of singed metal. Wrinkling my nose I opened my eyes to find the source. Would you look at that! My entire left side of the Armour was black instead of its usual glimmering red. Someone was saying something to me, I should probably respond to them.
“Its not fair steve , you have kept a lot of information from me too. And If I feel I don’t need to share it with you now then that is my decision” he said , but Steve could hear the tremble in his voice,  he was only retaliating to Steve’s anger and nothing more.
“If you are compromised we need to make sure we can reach you. This is a tracker” he said handing out a small object that resembled a button that you would sew onto your clothes.
Steve groaned, not wanting to deal with the man. He was a familiar face for sure, what being a famous business man but that didn’t make Steve feel any comfortable.
“I don’t…steve please dont tell anyone please…i shouldn’t have told you i..shit” he pulled on his shorts quickly backing away from near steves proximity.
“How is he doing?” Bruce asked as he injected something into Tony’s IV cannula. He checked the leads on Tony’s chest to see if they are secure before he settled down on a chair.
“And yet here I am sleeping like a baby every night.” He stuck his tongue out and Steve chuckled before heading to the bath to change.
Steve didn’t want to wake him, things would be harder if tony was aware. Steve didn’t know why tony had insisted on staying here but he knew that was not going to be possible. Whether he liked it or not, stane was right about shield being dangerous for tony. This was no place for a teenager to be playing around.
“Any fatalities?” He asked as he rubbed both his palms across his eyes hoping to clear away the haziness.
“Hey it’s the only thing I could think of on short notice okay” Steve shrugged swinging his leg over his bike and putting the key in ignition. Just as Tony grabbed onto his shirt to use him as support to get onto the bike Steve stopped him
Steve turned again to look at him and smiled to himself as he saw Tony nibbling on the spoon in his hand ,which held no food. He looked tired and exhausted and looked worse than Steve felt.
“,deep breaths for me please" the doctor ordered and Tony followed and Steve watched his reaction carefully for any signs of indifference.
"let's not tell Steve about this little incident okay? He has been enough worried lately. I don't want to trouble him on my account"
“give me my pants back" he asked trying to push him away and Steve took the ice pack away looking down to just make sure once again that Tony was okay.
"fury can brief us on the way" Thor nodded already excited of the battle and jumped onto the quinjet.
“he will found out soon enough"  he told her , meaning he had actually forgotten to mention it to him.
“Tony?” he called out softly, refraining from touching him but Tony didn’t stir so he reached out to rub slow circles on his back “wake up buddy" Tony startled awake and if Steve hadn’t wrapped an arm around his waist reflexively he would have tipped over from his chair.
Steve moved the table away , he moved to sit beside Tony’s chest , his fingers carding through his hair trying to calm him down.
Carefully letting go of his hands over Tony’s ears he guided Tony down onto the bed so he can sleep until obadiah arrives.
"What-," before he could question more, their positions were suddenly flipped ending up on his stomach and his sweatpants along with his boxers, supersoldier behind him feeling his hips being raised, leaving kisses down his spine until his face was face to face with his ass. His hands spreading apart his cheeks, feeling his breath against his ass. His tongue ran over his rim, kissing it as well, making him whine at the teasing.
But Steve could only shake his head and rolled on his back so that Tony was lying on top of him, hugging him tightly and pressing kisses all over his face. Tony didn't turn his head away, but he also didn't cease his pouting. "I'm so sorry", Steve said slightly out of breath and kissed Tony's pouting lips. "You almost gave me a heart attack and then you're freaking out over algae."
"Hello there", Tony finally managed after his gaze had wandered up Steve's body, stopping at the perfectly placed water droplets on his chest.
“He could use it”, she added and then raised her hand again to pat Tony’s cheek. Tony tried to jerk away but Mantis had already gotten all the information she needed. There was something else under all that sadness and even though she knew that the sadness wouldn’t go away just like that - Tony desperately needed help. Controlling the maelstrom of emotions wouldn’t be easy but at least Tony’s feelings swirled around. Steve’s  had been almost static, fixed on one point in their entire intensity. That had been what made her pass out, it was too much all at once.
A little giggle escaped Peter, but it disappeared into another yawn. "They invaded the tower, dad! I couldn't do anything about it."
“Hello?”, Steve called out, slowly moving towards the house and looking for a sign that might tell him what year it was. He didn’t want to call out for Tony in case he was back in the present, but it hadn’t felt like the present he had left would be the one he was returning to.
"Plus he'll probably be knackered tonight, so hopefully we can get him to go to sleep a little early and enjoy our evening."
Well, Steve wasn't entirely naked, he was wearing the tiniest Captain America speedos Tony had ever seen and that was quite the surprise effect when Tony had expected a pair of his usual swim shorts.
Exhaling loudly, Tony stepped aside. “Get your spangled ass in here, then.” He closed the door a little more forcefully than might have strictly been necessary and glared at Steve.
Tony was a little disappointed when it turned out to be empty – or at least its inhabitants had gone into hiding when Tony and Steve had started to jolt their homes with their rock climbing. But it didn't matter much because he had a far more interesting specimen right in front of him.
“Bedroom”, Tony agreed with a smirk; and then almost squeaked when Steve picked him up and carried him. “Fuck, that’s hot.”
Steve did talk to Bucky and Sam. And the rest of the team, for that matter. Bucky gave him a hug that was strong enough to almost break Steve’s ribs and lectured him about the dangers of time travel until Steve swore up and down that he would never again attempt to somehow not experience time the same way everyone else on earth did. (Except for Dr. Strange and friends, obviously.) Sam told Steve about how his new Captain America duties were going; that the shield was still in one piece and Steve told him how proud he was to have such a worthy successor.
"That'd be cool, but no lasers- not until he's older for sure," Steve chuckled. "I know how much you love your lasers,"
While all this went down, Steve had notice all the looks they were getting and immediately got his husband’s attention. “Tony, we need to go. We can just take the food with us,”
Steve sits down next to Tony and gently grabs his hand. He didn't say anything and tried to stay with Tony without making him uncomfortable.
Watching the door open slowly and stepping in, he spotted the holding orb, a circular metal cell as it spun around before coming to a complete stop after a minute and dropped down onto the devalued flooring that fit it perfectly
That was all he needed to hear before he started to break and take off the restraints, careful not to mess up whatever the hell was hooked up to him, shaking the man slightly. "S-Steve? Steve?" he slightly smacked his face, not too hard though.
"Tony!" He says sternly as tears roll down his cheeks. "Look at me!" He holds back sobs. "Why didn't you tell me that I had a son?" he repeated
They told him he’d probably wake up soon so it would be best for him to be at his side with loved ones to reassure him I’d he wakes up in a bad reaction. With another nod in confirmation, he walked into Tony's room and holds his hand gently. That's when Morgan and Happy walk in with Peter following in behind as Morgan ran to her Papas’s arms.
He takes Morgan from Steve with a hum. "Mhm, don’t be too long though, I’ll start lunch better be back by then mister "
Nat nodded getting out following him inside. "I'm sure he'll like the gift too," she nudged his arm as they walked inside leading to the common room where Peter was making conversation there was a small birthday party ned and MJ was there and another male student who was a little flirty with Peter there. He was talking with his friends when he looked up and saw Steve immediately smiling brightly. "Pops!" He squealed maybe and ran over almost jumping on him as he hugged him
Steve was sitting in his chair in the circle, next to Tony who had Morgan in his lap. As people began speaking, he would give soft looks and smiles over to Tony, wanting to see if he was okay. As a young man stopped speaking, Steve responds. "And that's it. Those are the brave little baby steps we gotta take so we can try to find purpose again." He pauses for a moment. "I went into the ice in '45. Right after I met a girl. Woke up 70 years later... You gotta move on." He reaches out and gently grabs Tony's hand. "you will find purpose again. We just have to continue taking those tiny brave baby steps. It may seem small now but later, you'll look back and see how far those baby steps got you."
After he turned off the helmet he grabbed the blanket he had found on the ship laying down on the cold metal floor curled up. Fuck he just wanted to go home, be with the man he loved. Their last date was before Steve had to go off the grid because of their stupid government. He dazed off wondering if Steve looked any different from the last time he saw him if he still loved him if he'd come back to him. What if he finally realized Tony wasn't enough for him and decided to go back to his best friend?
"Thought you vowed to never touch because they were too boring," Steve playfully rolled his eyes as Tony appeared next to him in their old room, carrying in his old metal shield which he graciously took from him.
It had been a couple of weeks after the Thanos snap, it was quiet for the most part, people taking in the realization most of their loved ones are gone. That's what Captian America realized when he finally realized, a day after that horrid day, that his love, Tony Stark was nowhere to be found. After contacting Happy and getting no luck, he called on his last hope, Tonys CEO of Stark Industries and Happy's wife, Pepper Potts.
"Okay let's see what we got...," he muttered under his breath pulling up the folder, searching for something useful. Hold up... he paused as he stared at the screen. This didn't make sense... This formula was being formed by some kind of inhuman- possibly, also explains Tarleton's big growing head. A scan of the person's brain, a full body of their captivity, and their vitals displayed on the screen- he may have come for a lab but he wasn't going to keep them suffering. All he had to do was now find this door, maybe this was the answer.
Suddenly, everything just began to shake. Was this an earthquake? Steve thought to himself, turning off the water and throwing down his towel as he threw on one of his long shirts and ran out of the room to find a window. What he saw almost made his heart skip a few beats. He spotted a ship being carried by a bright-looking star as it was making a landing in front of the compound. Steve along with the others ran outside to meet the newcomer, especially with the hope to see who inside the ship, I mean there must be a reason for her to bring this here.
"You should know, I'm not in the best of moods," a voice boomed as a new person joined them on the ship, slamming down a spazz of lightning destroying one of the big robots.
He groaned as he pushed his hips up before pausing to dig his heels into the sheets, digging his fingers into Tony's hips, holding him up and he fucks up into him fast knowing the both of them won't last too long he knew Tony was so close.
There was a pause as they watched as Steve looked frantically, maybe to find a solution. "Then get out... and seal the door!"
He shrugged a little. "It been too long, i probably was just really stressed after all that, he was born at 35 weeks,"
"Well I guess that gives me an excuse to teach underoo here on what his dad does," he joked with a slight chuckle, pressing a kiss to the top of Peter's head, thankful he was a heavy sleeper.
Steve pulled away, removing his fingers and his hand away. "Are you saying you want me to fuck you already?" he asked licking his lips with a smirk.
“You and me Tony, just the two of us in the room honey.” He ran his fingers tips across Tony’s chest and and repeated the pattern again and again giving Tony something to familiarize on.
“can I put it on you?” he asked again gently bring the mask closer and when Tony didn’t shy away again he held it up over Tony’s nose and mouth feeling Tony resist the air flow
“I am not wearing that! Its ugly and it has no back" he huffed and Steve chuckled before throwing it at him anyway.
“No” he said calming down slighting , his voice was gruff and Steve made him drink some water through a straw.
It took almost another twenty minutes before the rest of them were done with this floor and Steve almost sighed with relief. That relief was very short lived however when pepper came walking out of the elevator looking pale and nervous.
“Hey stop with the joking , I am trying to have a serious conversation here" he turned himself on the chair facing Tony his salad forgotten
“Okay steve, but like I said before it’s not that easy.” Bruce sighed “and it’s not just about legal, have you considered Tony’s point of view? His mansion, his lab. He wouldn’t want to leave all that and just walk out. I have a distinct feeling that Tony’s fear of going against stane is that he will lose his only connection to his parents.”
Steve had wanted nothing more than to wrap his hands around Tony but it seemed like everything had taken a really harsh turn. Steve was exhausted , still in pain.
Steve managed to finish up his class without being too bothered by the unimpressed look he was receiving from Anthony after he gave them homework on the first day. The bell rang and before Steve could drop his book ,sit back down and lift his head, tony had left, leaving a frowning Steve in the wake. He had made a beeline for the door before any of kids had even packed up.
“Uhm, clint said the microwave hasn’t been working right since two days so I thought I’ll take a look. But actually it’s not too bad ,I fixed the rotator and then since I had already opened her up I thought I could give her an upgrade" he said simply like it was the most normal thing for a sixteen year old to be doing at three in the morning in his underwear.
“I will take it from here, thank you" he said nodding to the other two and the gave rhodey a grateful smile
It baffled steve how shy Tony was. At school tony was loud and loved the attention. He was crass with his words, an air of pompous attitude always surrounding him. But with steve ,when they were talking about intimate things he was especially shy.
“How did you know?” She scoffed lightly “he has been throwing looks your way ever since we arrived here.” Steve tried not to let that bother him as he noticed tony and his two friends, pepper and Rhodes who seemed to have become somewhat inseparable since tony joined this school.
“Mm that boy needs distractions too Steve. And it’s obvious that history is his as well.” He said looking up from his paper and sipping his coffee casually. Steve felt himself blush a little before he cleared his throat suddenly worried that the whole school knew. Or what if Tony had told everyone?
"clint grab a cloth and run it with some cool water" clint too?huh. I was missing a lot of things.I pried my eyes open .Steve was sitting on his knees next the couch hand in my hair looking more worried than ever. Bruce was holding my wrist in his hand looking at his watch. I pulled my hand away and tried to get up. But I was immediately stopped with Steve's hand on my chest pushing me back down.
“Then stop talking and come here” he said winking at him and Tony crawled over towards him and sat on his knees in front of Steve unsure what to do.
“I hope you will forgive me” he whispered in his ear as he nosed his way up Tony’s neck and his temple and Tony writhed beneath him at the words and Steve pulled away just enough so that he could see his face.
Steve didn’t hear what Clint replied ..he was just too tired for his ears to pickup on Natasha’s earpiece sounds at the moment.
“You know stevie, Its nice to see you so protective over someone. He must be really lucky to have you" bucky said finally settling comfortably now that natash and Bruce had left. There was still a lot of tension between the two after the mention of Howard’s death but they will eventually get there some day.
“Don’t remind me" Steve said “I’ll meet you guys in Tony’s room in ten" he said and headed towards the gym .
One, steve was smiling unbeknownst to himself because tony being bored in his class was not only a history thing and two, there was a questionable sense of pride bubbling in Steve’s chest that he just couldn’t fathom. Was he proud that tony was doing well in Bruce’s class?
Steve was yet to speak to Bucky, which he didn’t know why he was hesitating so much about or that’s what he told himself,  because he knew somewhere deep inside that it had something to do with what peggy had said about knowing his feelings towards Bucky in the forties.
“You are breaking up with me aren’t you?” he asked his voice angrier as he slid out from under the covers and stood up running his hands through his still damp hair
He pulled Tony along towards one of the private room stopping once to make sure the girl was okay. She was already asleep and the other teacher walked in just in the nick of time letting him deal Tony.
There was a light sting to his cheek , his ears ringing as he suddenly opened his eyes again ,when had they closed? To look at natasha who was now now trying to pry his hands off the sleeping teen.
Thor woke to the sound of the hamper shutting close and Steve gave him a small smile as he watched the Norse god fumble around trying not to fall off the small bed.
“Steve don't do that,  you are thinking too hard. “ he felt warm lips brush at his jaw ,down his neck bringing him back to the present .
Steve placed the bowl back down scooting backwards next to Tony before gently manhandling him so that he was laying against his chest.
“I am going to put it in okay?” he told him but Tony didn’t look like he was tracking and Steve reached over put a hand below his neck , holding him there “tony?” his eyes landed on his after a few seconds
“They are my dog tags, one belonged to me and the other to Bucky. It’s the only thing I have left from the forties" he said and smiled as Tony’s eyes marveled at them
I didn't know what it meant, but Tony seemed excited so I smiled anyways trying to appreciate whatever he had managed to accomplish. "j, let her down easy" he instructed. The boots came off, after he stuck the landing gracefully. Wiping the grease off his hands, he sauntered over to me. I opened my arms, and he sat down on my lap, locking his hands around my neck. He looked so pale and exhausted. I wrapped my arms around him pulling him close tucking his head by my shoulder and kissed his head.
“Are you sure?” he asked and Tony giggled a little when Steve kissed under his chin before dropping him on the bed. He hadn’t realized his right arm had become numb from holding Tony for a while . He shook his arm out before he crouched down next to the bed, face to face with Tony.
“I am going to attach some leads to him, monitor his heart . Steve he needs to be propped up a little more, it will help his breathing. Clint grab the oxygen mask.” Bruce was all business, he didn’t stop to see if anyone was actually doing what they were told. He grabbed supplies for an iv and set it up dragging the pole near the bed
Tony’s sudden movement startled all of them, Steve and Dr.Brandon moving closer immediately to hold him still.
“we did talk about Bucky, after the incident of him with tony” they all nodded “I did mention he was the winter soldier, and told him he was staying at my old apartment”
“Okay, okay can you sit here for a few moments? I’ll be right back , I need to have a word with the principal.” Tony gave him a quizzical look not sure whether to trust him or not.
It all happened at once, the door on the trains closing, pepper screaming for tony and Tony’s frowning glare aimed at him. And of course the blast that shook the platform as Steve all but wrapped himself around the teen covering as much flesh as possible before he felt themselves being thrown at the wall behind them. The searing pain at the back of his head made things fuzzy after that.
“Second of all, can we have this conversation after school? I’ll tell stane I have to do homework with rhodey and pepper so I can stay late.”
“Why?” Tony got defensive as he looked up and shot a look to Steve as if he had expected it to have been his idea and Steve shook his lightly at him before tipping his chin towards the spies.
“This incident would have never occurred if tony was not here in the first place. And he sure as hell wouldn’t have stopped to greet his teacher in the goddman subway if you hadn’t enrolled him into the same damn school as this man” stane wouldn’t even meet his eyes, just pointing fingers while he glared at Fury.
“I failed to save Bucky once, I thought I lost him that day. People think captain America is a hero but Tony you have to understand that my biggest failure after the serum was me being unable to save my best friend from the fatal fall."
“Can you just make sure he waits outside , I would like to have a word with him before he comes in here" the agent nodded and left
When she didn’t receive an answer from Tony she turned to Steve but the look in his eyes gave away that he didn’t know either.
Tony licked his lips where it was bleeding just a tiny bit and gave a shaky smile. His walls he had up when Steve had first entered were slowly dropping.
"you want to head up to shield?" nat asked reading my mind. I nodded my head no because I knew if we went there would only be more questions and that would mean it will take longer.
"Are you hurt anywhere? H-" there was knock on the door amd Tony jumped in his chair while Steve went to open it
“We need to talk , until then I think this will suffice" he said pulling away and Tony looked like a kicked puppy as he nodded
“Natasha does hate you” steve stilled before rolling his eyes at the dramatics and Tony froze before he took the few steps back and cowered behind steve.
“It’s not an option sorry.” The doc said firmly and Steve was actually quiet surprised at how authoritative he sounded.
“ I am sorry for what happened yesterday I really am” he said as he looked down rejected from his own failures haunting him
“How did this happen?” he growled and Tony retreated a step back and Steve had to remind himself to calm down.
Steve conceded knowing there was a tub of ice cream in his freezer anyway. Clint kept back up ice cream at Steve's place and it came in handy sometimes.
“I didn’t , I wouldn’t.  He was just a baby” he said shakily “I wouldn’t recognize him, you have to believe me" and it looked like the last part was directed at Steve but he had nothing to offer.
He sighed softly as he headed towards the door, automatically opening it, time to find this lab before getting out of here. Wandering through the first hall, he immediately spotted a terminal that could give him the answers he needed. Walking up and typing on the keyboard, 'Tarleton G 001 REGENERATIVE FORMULA'
When he stared into those ocean blue eyes again- emotions crashed over him all over again. "Holy shit... you're alive," Tony immediately got back to work, pulling at all the restraints on him, he'd answer any of his questions when he could feel him in his arms again.
Tony leaned up against the closet wall, arms wrapped around himself as he kept his gaze down, fuck should he speak first- he felt awkward, being in the same room as Steve especially in a small space, it felt weird.when he opened mouth nothing would come out and he just wanted to curl up even kore
"I swear, I question why I married you," Steve mumbled with a sigh, shaking his head as he pushed himself out of bed going off to find their son Peter hoping to find him just playing to himself. Immediately, he found the basement door wide open, heading down and squinting through the glass door and found the toddler messing around with an old iron man helmet, had the helmet on, and was messing around with it.
"Excuse Sir Stark-Rogers," The AI Friday spoke up. "Sorry to interrupt but your husband has just arrived in the driveway,"
"George... go!" Steve rushes George out with a hand gesture as he looks back at the panel. "Head to the command deck!" he turned back to as he was sealed in. "EVACUATE NOW," Grabbing the shield off his back and turned to the malfunctioning reactor.
"Mhm everything’s peachy," he turns his head after leaning it back on steves shoulder. "Just thoughts,"
Peter looked at Tony with big eyes. "Can I sleep with Daddy and Papa? I promise I'll be quiet and won't bother or squirm, pleaseee," He begged with a sad tone.
The super soldier sighed before closing the door and sat in Rhodes seat next to Tony's bed, reaching forward taking one of his frail hands, lightly rubbing his knuckles taking a moment to just enjoy this moment, he didn't know if Tony was awake or not so he just spoke anyway hoping he'd hear this anyways.
It was like another one of those days, where one of them would go on a long mission then come back days later after no contact with one another. Expect this one was 5 years, Tony thinking the love of his life was dead. Tony kept his head on the man's chest, eyes closed, ear pressed against where his heart was beating, let himself reassure the years of nightmares were false.
“Aw I’m very proud of you- but we’re going to have to leave the mask home okay?” He asked with a soft voice. “We can’t have people think you’re the bad little guy now do we?”
The other sighed as he started pulling out of the parking lot after buckling up himself. “Go ahead and buckle him with you,” he nodded as he did as told and continued what he was doing while leaving soft kisses on the toddler’s face.
Steve quickly lifted his daughter into his arms and gently kisses her cheek. "Sorry I didn't text you. We talked about something that I think you want to hear about."
“Of course,” Steve replied, taking the boy in his arms. He carried him over where he sat at a table with 4 chairs, sitting Peter across from him knowing he would want to sit next to Tony.
He sat down to eat after throwing away the web. "I don't know bug... papa... papa just works alot nowadays,"
SHIELD joined them on the Chimera and helped around, that only problem was- they were having trouble finding the other 3 Avengers... Natasha, Barton, and Thor. Knowing Nat and Barton they were undercover around the world and hard to track. While Thor- hell he's a god, he could be anywhere. That all changed when at the AntHill, where the resistance stayed, Kamala found out about the captive Inhumans kept in a secure location- no one would take her side and help her- so she snuck out with the help of Theo- an inhuman who could make portals - but it would be too late for anyone to realize she's gone.
Tony chuckled lightly as he looked up from walking towards the house noticing the black Audi, a smile making his way on his face.
Tony decided to ask their son something he might come to regret later. “Hey, bug? Remember about me telling you about what I do? How about you join me tomorrow, make some cool things,”
Tony pecked his lips back before just hugging the male close, head in his neck with a sigh, soon everyone came back with all stones and soon the construction of the new gauntlet began, soon it was all put together and ready to be used.
He shivers wishing the best of luck to Hiwars before rushing to their meeting point with the case. "Let’s get out of here," he said quickly
Steve gently takes Tony's hand and kisses his knuckles. "Y'know, I still love you. I've never stopped loving you."
Tony paused again, closing his eyes a little, letting out a small grunt of pain, and opened them again. He had to finish this for Steve.
Tony immediately stood up using the table as support, knocking over a glass or two that was in front of him. "You know what I need? A shave," continuing as he begins to rip out the IV in his arm. "And I believe I remember-," He hears his best friend Rhodes in the background calling his name as he rips it out a bit painful as he began raising his voice a little. "Otherwise that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world remember that? Whether it impacted other precious freedoms or not that's what we needed,"
"Tiny Dancer hm Nat?" he lightly chuckled and looked over at the blonde. "What was yours? Legolas I'm guessing Barton?"
Tony paused again, closing his eyes a little, letting out a small grunt of pain, and opened them again. He had to finish this for Steve.
Steve smiles at Morgan's response and then looks up at Tony and stands up. "Alright. I'll meet you guys at home then?" He asks softly.
"I think you got punched enough years ago," he tried to wipe his tears with his thumbs. "I forgave James long ago... i forgave you ever since you came back in our son's life,- and proved yourself tonight i guess.."
-"No, no, NO- Steve, what are you doing-," Tony was cut as his mouth dropped watching him yell out while George in the background trying to stop him, his shield in front of him as he rushed towards the spazzing out reactor. "No. just stop... Stop," His voice cracked as he slowly started backing up, his arms started shaking.
Steve smiles softly as he watches Peter on the screen. He looks over at Tony and smiles. "He's so much like you. So smart and talented."
"No- please don't blame yourself-," she walked up to him, a tablet in her hands. "The only thing we can do now is proving to AIM that we aren't going to back down- Tarleton wants us to fight with each other and prove to the world that we are the same people from 5 years ago," she frowned as she showed him the tablet screen, the interrogation.
Now he felt like he had no purpose anymore. He felt like he should've expected Steve to sacrifice himself for the world if it came to it but the fact his last words to him was 'see you later' and no communication to each other during the battle- he had to watch from afar the ship exploding- no notice. They couldn't even find his body to give him a proper funeral- Tony couldn't even be there due to the blame of the Avengers causing A-DAY. They failed, they failed New York, they failed the innocent people that died... most importantly, they failed themselves along with their leader.
That shut Steve up before he could finish apologizing once again, gulping slightly, feeling like a lump was stuck in his throat, not even realizing a hand grabbed the back of his head bringing him down and before he knew it he felt those familiar soft lips on his.
Steve holds onto Tony and gently rubs his back. "Hey... It's okay, it's okay Tony... Shhhh..." He whispers. "I forgive you."
"Mm... I'm fine but you capsicle need to go to bed as well," Tony gave him that same look and tone, knowing how exhausting that kind of missions can take a toll on you.
Steve was surprised, to say the least, but he found himself releasing a slight hum, snaking his arms around the brunette's waist, feeling legs wrap around his waist, adjusting his waist so he was laying on top, using his forearms to not put all of his weight on him.
Tony froze looking away at the mention of the kid’s name. "I can’t," he muttered as the patio door opened and little morgan popped out and jumped in Tony’s lap. "Auntie Pepper said to come to save you,"
"Oh Oh, Can we go to McDonald's?" Peter asked excitedly, bouncing on his heels. "Please with a cherry on top daddy?"
It took him a minute but AIM files pulled up and what he saw would forever burn in his mind. His own lover's murder on that ship, and god it was like his world stopped. There was no sound in the clip. Tarleton was at the computer panel as Steve ran in, full Captain America uniform on. They were yelling by the looks of things as the ship shook, a blue smoke around them, sparks flying. Steve was staring at the computer before saying something and looking towards the door. Tarleton ran towards the door and behind it was the door panel as the doors closed when Steve looked back as if the man just locked him into the danger zone. He didn't run towards the door or anything, he just turned to the malfunctioning reactor and ran towards it before the screen went white.
Steve couldn't take it anymore and fast-walked over to Tony almost sprinting as he embraced him, tears already building up in his eyes, the brunette's arms wrapping around him as they just enjoyed the presence of each other, leaving the past behind them at that moment.
"Hey Mr. Rogers.., if you find this recording- most likely redhead is showing this to you if she gets this- Don't... Don't post this anywhere this is going to be a real tearjerker- I don't know if you're ever going to see these, I don't even know if you're still,"
Steve kisses his temple and smiles faintly. He knows he's thinking about Peter. "You know, if we tried the time heist, there's a possibility it could work. We can get Peter back."
"No sweat." He took a deep breath, turning towards the next destination. "Rescue the inhuman, no more regen formula, no more adaptoids- high fives all around,"
Of course, Steve glanced back at Tony but he wanted to stay out of this conversation as long as possible, he wasn’t the type of person to talk about these things.
He nods and kisses his cheek. "Okay. I'll go get a shower and get ready for bed then." He whispers. "Hurry and you could join me." He teases playfully.
Morgan joined the hug hugging her new brother as Tony lightly rubbed his back. Peter nodded hiding his face sniffling.
Nebula came over and moved Tony to one of the ships chairs so he was more comfortable, she felt so sorry for him, it didn't look comfortable on the floor either.
Staring at the white pregnancy test in his hands, Tony almost wanted to shed tears- he didn’t know he didn’t think it would be possible. He sniffled as he looked at the two pink lines that confirmed his suspicions of pregnancy, he guessed he was around at least 8 weeks. Tony took a deep breath, he knew he had to tell Steve but when? This morning the government wanted to take control of the team, due to the number of damages they do after every battle, but Steve refused. He knew he'd have to talk to him but how? Steve didn’t like how he signed the accords. He flushed the toilet, stuffing the test in his coat before he headed to the meeting room where his finacé was waiting for him, to discuss the accords
Steve shakes his head and sighs. "He's hurt, Pepper. And that whole spiel he just had, all of that was true. How can I not beat myself up?"
"I-I-," Tony's voice spoke up as everyone looked towards him as he slowly started to back up towards the door. "I-I'm sorry I need to go excuse m-me," he turned around and ran out of there, ignoring his name being called, especially the fight that was going to break out.
But as it was slowly appearing... he noticed something familiar... things he'd only remember. He lowered his repulsors down as it was pushed out, its arms and legs spread, his face softening as the clouds cleared- it felt like time was frozen, the world paused around him. His eyes couldn't unfocus from what he saw.
Steve wipes away his tears and kisses his forehead. "We're your family, Pete. I promise we are here for you." He whispers and smiles softly.
Steve groaned lightly against his neck, creating one last hickey before pulling back. "Guess we will go old fashioned,"
Steve nods. "I probably won't be able to get in anywhere without people realize who I am. But I'll try."
He smiled softly leaning in his touch. "I have an even better solution," he pulled him up and to the living room of course with a bottle of scotch plopping on the couch and told Friday to play videos from the peters folder.
Steve nods and slowly gets up, clearly something bothering him. He looks back and smiles sadly. "It... It was good to meet you, Peter." He says softly before walking out.
He sighed shakingly as he finally fell asleep for the first time in forever while Nebula- well she was off doing whatever leaving the human being.
"So you're both just going to walk away," Kamala asked in disbelief, Tony had enough of this and headed towards his RV. "The Avengers were set up! Cap was murdered!"
Peter looked up at his Dad with big eyes full of curiosity. “What does pops do? Why can’t I know?” he asked with a small pout as he asked.
Tony nodded with a hum as Steve sat on the bed, criss-cross watching the male crawl into his lap, legs wrapped around his strong waist. Steve brought him into another passionate kiss his free hand cupping his cheek, his other trailing down to his ass, circling one finger on his rim before sliding it in, pumping it slowly letting him get used to the burn before adding in a second doing the same before he started scissoring his fingers, picking up his speed slowly, he was always this caring years back and it never changed.
"No! Dunt wanna!" Peter said as he looked around with a gummy smile before he started heading to the ceiling fan not hearing his father call for the nice lady in the walls for the stepladder but he was too busy spinning around on a ceiling fan blade liking to tease his poor dad because he knew he wouldn't get as mad as easily as his pops.
"Peter Benjamin Stark-Rogers," he crossed his arms, speaking sternly. "Do not give me that attitude," in return the toddler scrunched up his nose and stuck his tongue out at him, he was getting to his limit. "If you do not stop with this attitude, you're going to the time out corner, you wouldn't act this way if your pops were here,"
“Daddy, can you sit with me? I don’t like it when I’m all alone in the back..,” he asked with a sad voice.
Tony laughed softly as he pulls up a picture of Steve in his suit. “He’s the red, white, and blue with the shield remember? He’s been famous way before me though,” He joked, they never talked about the past though.
He lightly gasped standing up. "Wow 3000, that’s alot," as he left. "Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys," he joked before heading to their bedroom
He glanced at Barnes, the soldier had glanced at him as well, the pain of his past was catching up to him then. He was choked up trying to show that the starks were made of iron, not cry. He was strong- okay maybe a few escaped because of his pregnancy. But what made his heart hurt more, was watching him strangle his poor mother to death. The video ended with Bucky clearly in the frame -full-body, clear face, and all no mask- as he stepped up to the camera raising his pistol and shot the lens. He clenched his fists immediately going for the attack- but Steve stopped him.
"What?" he heard Kamala come up behind him to look over his shoulder, he's starting to like this kid.
It was a few minutes before the boy started drifting out of the anesthesia shifting in his bed clenching and unclenching his fists, one leg was supported up in the air, muttering things under his breath about the fight, for his dad, asking where he was, or just something incoherent. His eyes opened slowly everything was still a blur.
"We're trying to take senescence- and it looks like he did what he said he was going to do... Thanos wiped out 50% of the population of the world,"
Spotting him awake after peaking in the recovery room’s door frame, sighing softly at the conversation he had with Nat before he ran into Tony.
"No- no- there's...," he paused slightly as he tried to get it together, starting to type away on his laptop. "...there's more here,"
Peter cupped his face tears building up as he shook his head. "N-no sir i-i wouldn’t," he sniffled happily
What felt like hours later, Tony was peacefully still getting his rest but he slowly came back to reality trying to block this new bright light out of his face as he opened his eyes surprised to see this.. woman.. she was surrounded by fire and just floating there, he's definitely never seen her around either.
"You'll see by tonight," Steve winked at him with a soft smirk as he headed out of the room. "See you there!"
The star- now shown to be a woman known as Captian Marvel sent it down gently on the ground. After a minute the hatch opened to reveal none other than Tony Stark looking pale and on the brink of death is supported up by the Blue robot as they slowly had to walk down, tony even tripped a few times but remained standing.
"Yeah yeah but what's the fun of not making a late entrance?" Tony chuckled, crossing his arms over his chest.
Steve smiles and hugs his son tightly in his arms. "Hey, bud. Happy birthday." He whispers and rubs his back gently.
"Okay no no no," he ignored Rhodes telling him to sit down as he pointed towards Carol. "We need you, your new blood,"
He softly knocked before pushing open the door eyes widen a little as he spotted Rhodey already in there.
“fuck no no no- baby-,” he grumbled as he slowly peeled away the now dead armor around him- he couldn’t call for help now- Friday was down- no one knew where he was, he was stranded on Solkovia.
He looks up at him and sniffles. "I did?" He asks softly and smiles faintly. "I... I'm just trying to catch up and be a good father since I was gone his whole life..."
Tony grumbled in response as he was trying to stay asleep, whining as he pulled the bed covers over himself, turning over with his back to Steve.
4 more chapters left, those will be the longest ones yet including two smuts which I'll be trying to make my best ones yet. Cant believe when this is all done it'll be the longest thing I've ever written. hope yall enjoy all this.
He kisses his head. "It's okay, baby. Don't apologize." He whispers. He looks over at Morgan and smiles softly. "Morgan got you a juice pop to help you feel better." He whispers.
He sighed shakingly as he finally fell asleep for the first time in forever while Nebula- well she was off doing whatever leaving the human being.
Tony lightly played with the mans hair with one hand and the other rubbed his back muttering how he was allowed to cry it out and  that he was here for him
"Well, uh Kamala," He rolled his eyes gesturing towards Banner, raising his voice in anger. "Your emerald-eye friend here is kind of on my shit list,"
"For right now, yeah. My princess is tired, I can tell. And it's time to go to sleep, okay?" He says softly.
"Want it really bad- please want your cock- want your cum to fill me up until I'm leaking till the next day- give it to me good please,"
"Last we talked, I called him because he never showed up for lunch and... Steve, he's somewhere in space.. there's no way in getting a hold of him I've tried to, believe me, I don't know if he's alive or... dead..,"
He blushed watched him kiss his knuckles. "You missed," he playfully said and tapped his lips with his other hand. "Besides i didn’t say it was 100 percent gonna work, only 99.987% Dofus"
This place was full of hallways, twists, and turns, it felt like there wasn't an end. It was dusty, space dust everywhere, filled with covered boxes in a lot of these rooms, like no one had been here in years, not in use. It was as if they weren't trying to keep something out... but something in. Having to use some of the juice left to fly up on a broken elevator shaft and take out the security turners, having to drop down and more hallways to run through, he finally reached the room.
“ What should I do about his erection? I feel like he doesn’t get off when we have sex and I’m worried. Should I wait till Bruce comes back? Or do you know of anything? I m worried that it may be some health condition ya’ know? What happens if it’s a blockage down there and he can’t get it up?”
Sorry about the late update. I’ve been super busy with school and work. I hope you like the new chapter.
The man turned to Tony with a smile. He was younger looking than Howard and wore a black business suit. “ My name is Morgan Stark and I am Howard’s younger brother and your uncle. That is our brother Greg, the youngest out of the three of us.”
“ You morons. And you are supposed to be protectors of Earth. He manipulated you. The song was cursed. He wanted you to bring Tony back to him. Turn those speakers off now.”
Hi guys I’m looking for a Tony x Steve fanfic. Steve gets teleported into another universe where Tony is locked up after being deemed a criminal. The other universes Steve doesn’t want to interacting with their Tony. Steve has to wait until his tony can open a portal to save him. At the end Steve’s Tony opens a portal and rescues him. The other universe Avengers are wary of him. Tony was able to open the portal by using the i dirt stones and with the help of Jane Foster. At the end the other universe Captain America makes amends with the other universes Tony and it can be alluded that they try to start a relationship.
Tony was about to open the door when heard heard someone scream in pain. Tiny hurried opened it and stopped short. Steve was in grey sweatpants and a white shirt and slippers and standing over Clint who was wearing what appeared to be a Hawkeye themed pajama set. Why someone would make an adult size kids pajama with little super heroes patterning all over the clothing was being him. Steve was giving Clint and murderous glare and was angrily tapping his right foot.
“ Ewww. No. He’s our age. And let me tell you.” Morgan mouth the words oh my god. “ He Can pound my ass like no tomorrow. Yesterday he held me up against a dresser and I thought I was going to die and go to heaven. He is gifted with that dick of his.”
Tony backed himself up to a wall and grabbed a wrench from a nearby work table, holding it defensively.
It turns out this Tony hadn’t created nanotechnology yet. But that was understandable he wasn’t as awesome as him.
Tony looked up at him. Steve looked back at him. He was no longer smiling. He joyful visage replaced by the serious demeanor he associated with missions: the face of a strategical leader. Tony has hoped he wouldn’t be trying to flirt and expect a response so soon.
Bucky was a trouble maker and therefore a pain in the ass. He would often gang up with Sam and Clint to make everyone’s life a living hell, especially Schmidt. They had somehow gotten a hold of several armadillos and released it on the floor on which is office was located and they ended of wreaking havoc. This Bucky was a lot happier than the one Tony had met and quite the flirt. He was also Steve’s best friend  and seemed to want to help him in whatever way he can. Which apparently included helping Steve win over Tony. He had the unfortunate experience of overhearing a “ how to flirt session” between the too and how to pick up someone. It was really sad to see Steve try and practicing wooing someone. The man was completely hopeless.
Tony dropped the fish. “ You don’t want the fish? Ok. That’s fine. But I can help you get that thing off your tail. Will you let me.”
Tony felt a body over him and something in him. He slowly peered around and saw a terrified Steve Rogers in what appeared to be his black Hydra uniform, cowering under Howard’s glare as best as possible without slipping out of him.
Them both Tony is currently keeping me company tonight. “ Do you want me to use that wording or that you are currently fucking him?”
Maybe he should go to Wades apartment tonight. Maybe he just forgot to call Peter and tell him he returned. Yes, that is what he will do.
Tony scratched behind his ear. “ I’ll be back tomorrow. I’ll bring you something good to eat.” Winghead nuzzled his neck before allowing him to leave.
Tony just nodded and scurried along as he saw the pitcher of water in his hand was still half way full.
“ Why don’t you just tell us why you are here. I don’t trust you. You could be a spy trying to infiltrate our ranks and endanger our team.” Steve growled.
Clint started to laugh, “ Man remember when he accidentally booked extra tickets for you and Rhodey to spend a week in Italy? There was no way in hell that was an accident. You don’t just accidentally spend $10,000 extra on a vacation. That man will kill to have you as a son in law.”
“ Bruce will follow Nat anywhere. That jackass however, is a little more stubborn,” Clint loudly whispered.
“ They are his family. He wants them safe. He won’t mind dropping you like a hot potato if you are meaning to hurt them. “
“ You stubborn bastard.” Tony growled as Steve tried to flip him over and onto the sand. Tony held on and continued to try and open his mouth. He wanted to strangle the bastard for being so hard headed.
The Slave-master swallowed before starting. “ There were other slaves he accompanied regularly. I assumed they could be called friends.” He said carefully.
Tony sighed as he waited outside the doors. He was going to die. Well that thought wasn’t new. He did ad a risky lifestyle as a part time super hero and before that his partying habits. So yeah. There was that.
Steve came back and deposited a plate of chocolate waffles and bacon in from of Tony and placed a similar plate next to his own. Tony guessed he was going to have the same thing. A bowl of spinach was then placed in front of Clint.
“ Anthony, you are practically glowing. Either whatever broad you were with last night was phenomenal or you may have a crush. And I assume it’s the latter as  you are quite smitten and you are completely sober today.”
Tony glared at him. This was no laughing matter. These people were evil if they thought they could stuff him into a onsie just because they happen to be the parents he always wanted.
Steve sighed. Looks like it was going to be one of those days were Tony would be in bad bad mood. He undid his boots and jumped in bed, pushing Tony more toward the center.
“ Operation: Little Mermaid is a go.” Clint said over the comm. Tony just rolled his eyes. Winghead looked up at smiled brightly at him. Tony noticed that his hair looked as if it were combed with pompade placed in it. It made him wonder if he had escaped the pen again and stole from one of the SHIELD agents.
“ Yeah yeah keep growling punk. That never fucking works on me. I have to report to you that the older Stark decided to throw a vase at Clint after he refused to tell him that you were currently fucking his son.”
Tony felt a soft hand on his cheek. He opens his eyes and grimaced at the bright light. He visions slowly adjusted and a figure became clear in his field of vision.
Tony turned away and headed out the door, but not before flicking the archer the bird. Nope he was not jealous at all.
Steve just shook his head, “As I was saying vacation sheet will be available soon, same spot in the common area and you will be checked off to make sure you have completed any missing paperwork before you leave. Next on the list is a friendly reminder for annual wellness checks next month.It is mandatory and sign up will begin next week. Failure to complete the wellness check will result in suspension of your active status.”
Tony reaches for Grants hands and had them placed on his hips as he reached forward and kissed his lips. He Flicked his tongue against his lips, wanting a soft gasp. He slipped his tongue in and began to trace the inside of his mouth. He tried to play with the velvety appendage opposite  from his own but it was clumsy and uncoordinated. Despite this, it was adorable.
Peter showed him a wrist. “ Here.” Harry thought he looked so adorable when he was confused. But right now was not the time.
“ Come one Grant. Give it to me.” Tony panted. That was when he get a sharp thrust from below him. If Steve hadn’t been there to hold him and if Grant hadn’t had him in a bruising hold, he probably would have been flying off.
“ You’re now fun Stevie. Look you made him frown. Just get him his Friends. I’m pretty sure he will reward you handsomely.”
Clint gave a look of mock offense.  “ You wound me Nat. I thought we were friends.” The blonde laid himself across her lap and clutched his chest with his right hand and he had the other draped over his brow.
Rogers. Ok so he was still pissed. It’s not like Steve should have been surprised. He did break the man’s wrist.
Tony rolled his eyes. Damn. He didn’t want Steve to find out. Strange placed a soft kiss on the crown of his head and pulled back.
Tony felt his heart swell and he wanted to cry. Why was this Tony so loved? What was wrong with him.
When Jarvis had replied with a short "Of course, Sir", Tony waddled off in the direction of the kitchen where he found Steve at the coffee machine.
, but Tony pressed a finger to his lips. “Now you say this?”, Tony went on quietly. “Now you say I’m
Steve felt a lump in his throat. “I’m so sorry, baby. I’m so sorry I hurt you like that back when... it wasn’t right. I’m so sorry I left you, even though that wasn’t me-me. You deserve better than that. I’m just... so sorry.”
“Tell him”, she said again, looking up into Steve’s eyes before she scrambled out from where she was laying and limped over to Gamora.
“Hm.” Tony didn’t sound particularly convinced by that, but he snatched the strawberry ice cream from Steve and shoved the vanilla tub into his lap instead. “JARVIS, play the 2014 Godzilla please.”
“Good evening, Captain Rogers”, JARVIS smooth British voice said from the ceiling (or wherever Tony’s AI’s spoke from anyway).
"Ughhh." With a little effort, Tony managed to lift Peter up and passed him on to Steve. "I'll need the suit soon to lift you up, Petey. Especially when you've eaten that much."
Tony was watching Steve, his every movement when he lubed up his fingers and started to massage Tony’s hole. “Hurry up”, Tony rasped out when Steve took his time to even dip the first finger inside. “I need you inside me!”
“Yes!” With a groan Tony tried to move even closer to Steve. “Please, make me come, please I need it, I’m yours!”
Only cleaning up the utmost necessary, Steve and Tony cuddled back together. Tony placed his head on Steve's biceps, which he commented with a grunt, but he pulled the duvet over them.
“Slow down there with the questions, Capsicle.” Tony stood up and went to his liquor cabinet to pour himself a drink. “Short version: I invented time travel. Yes, we brought everyone who disintegrated in the snap back. Thanos is dead. Thor chopped his head off. You were there for all of this! I have no fucking clue where you went afterwards, though. Care to explain?” Tony gripped the tumbler in his hands tightly, his knuckles turning white. Steve was worried he’s smash the glass and cut himself, so he got up and gently took it out of Tony’s hand.
Steve watched Tony dry the plates and put them in the drying rack. He wouldn’t be able to go back. It made sense, considering everything, he had felt like he had been blocked by something when he had tried to travel back to 2024. And maybe it wasn’t so bad: Tony was alive, Bucky and Sam were around. But this was the second time in his life that time left him stranded and he was entirely sick of it. Of time travel too.
He didn't manage to finish his sentence because thanks to the superspeed Steve had already covered the distance to the water and had run in until the beach fell off enough that Tony wouldn't get hurt upon flopping into the water.
“If?”, Tony asked, curious and so intently focused on Steve that he almost felt dizzy; Tony Stark’s full attention was really something.
Tony leaned in for another kiss and while it started with the same passion as before, it was so, so sweet. There was a feeling in it that made Steve’s head spin with more than just lust, that made his heart flutter and the butterflies in his stomach dance. And then Tony’s fingers brushed over Steve’s nipples as if by accident. “Please”, Steve babbled against Tony’s lips, helpless under his ministrations. “Please let me. Please!”
“That’s a nice surprise to come home to”, Tony commented and Steve immediately whipped around, embarrassed. “Hi”, Steve spluttered, trying to get the apron over his head and waving at the ceiling to get JARVIS to turn off the music. The AI turned the volume down, at least something.
Tony decided to throw all caution into the wind. Mantis was right, in a way, he couldn’t get much worse. More pain would settle into his soul so easy like a day full of laughter for other people. “Hug me, that would make me happy.”
The next couple of days had been slow. Steve adjusted to Tony’s life – mostly tinkering in his downstairs workshop and regular skype calls to Pepper and Peter Parker. Apparently Tony took regular time off from
Tony made a disbelieving sound. “Peter! You promised you’d do what papa tells you. Please be careful!”
“If I let you in and you hurt me again, I will kick your ass”, Tony said suddenly, when Steve had just folded the towel. He was staring at Steve again with that look on his face. “And if you want to run-“, Tony swallowed hard, “you better do it now.”
Steve didn’t take his eyes off Peter in the water when he squeezed Tony's hand. “Stop worrying Tony, I can feel you thinking.”
"Gosh, Tony, yes." Steve held Tony down for a moment before easily lifting him up so he was in position while Steve got on his back. Tony's fingers dug into Steve's arms while he just dangled there in the air, his cock leaking a drop of precome and his hole wet with lube and waiting to be filled. "Jesus, I love when you do that super strength thing."
First over his neck, slowly massaging him a little until he practically melted into Steve and then caressing down his back; following the line of his spine.
Peter kept giggling, but he was careful not to fall when Tony set him back down. He walked over to Steve and hugged his legs, almost ridiculously tiny against the beefy dorito shape of the supersoldier. "Thank you, papa", Peter said. "You'll still keep going to swim with me, though, aren't you?"
Steve blushed, but took the ice cream tubs from Tony so he could sit down as well. “That... would be very nice.”
He just huffed and crossed his arms in front of his chest, and Steve was momentarily distracted by the way the open leather jacket accentuated his body.
“You missed him... it’s okay. I’m glad he’s back. Hello, JARVIS”, Steve replied as calmly as possible. Tony had probably had a couple fights with the team about this from the way he acted. But JARVIS had been ripped from him, who was he to dictate Tony if he was allowed to resurrect his AI or not? Steve guessed however that Wanda was not a regular guest around here and felt a pang of sadness and compassion for her loss.
Mantis took Steve’s hand and reached for Tony’s. “Can’t, not until I know that you’re not getting worse. You’re like a feedback loop”, she added, her entire body trembling under the intensity of the emotions she picked up from their hands. She placed them on top of each other and Tony immediately tried to pull his hand away but she didn’t let him. “One negative emotion and you’re falling into a void”, she whispered. “How do you want to get out of it, all alone?”
Laughing, Tony bent over to open the freezer. “Can do.” He grabbed two cartons of ice cream and two spoons and motioned for Steve to go back to the living room. “I’m assuming you’re staying here tonight”, Tony said when Steve had sat down in front of the holographic tv screen on an ugly dark red sofa that looked like Tony might have stolen it from a Star Trek set.
“No baby.” Steve’s embrace got a little tighter and Tony contently closed his eyes. He would fight anything and anyone that dared to come between them. He wouldn’t let anything take this away, now that he’d finally gotten it. “I’m going to stay with you until the end of time.”
Steve tangled his legs with Tony's and smiled. "Family days are the best days", Steve agreed and got into a comfortable sleeping position, his eyes already closing.
After that they stopped the chatter for a while, getting lost in each other's touches and kisses. Tony unwrapped himself from Steve so he could actually reach his dick instead of only grinding against him and turned them around, Steve on his back and Tony sitting on his lap; looking like the cat that got the cream. The speedos didn't get another look as soon as Tony had pulled them off with his teeth; and after showering Steve's thighs and abs with kisses and kitten licks and a few hickeys, Steve actually growled.
"Yes", Tony agreed immediately and went back to grab his abandoned juice cocktail. "Time for the after-swim party!"
Deciding on a black leather chaiselongue as the least offending object, Steve walked over to it and sat down with a sigh. Tony stalked to a very Bauhaus looking armchair that could’ve come straight from his dentist’s waiting room and faced Steve. “Well?”, Tony asked, his voice sounding strangled. “Have a go at that conversation then.”
"Fuck! Oh my, Tony, fuck-" Gripping the sheets and moaning loudly, Steve started to slowly move his hips in the rhythm of Tony's head movements. Every time Tony thought Steve had too much control he sucked on the tip for a bit, letting his tongue dance over it, until Steve actually writhed under him. Only then he took his entire length back in, keeping his hands occupied with Steve's balls.
