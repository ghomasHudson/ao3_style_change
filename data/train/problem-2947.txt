But then he saw Dean break through to him. Dean had barely fought him, just begged him to stop. He told him he knew this wasn’t him.
He hears himself, quietly, asking Cas if he liked the windmill. In that moment, it’s all that matters. All other concerns fall away from him as he imagines the shock of coming back to life; he knows better than most what it feels like to be resurrected. All that matters is that Cas felt safe and at peace when he came to in the field.
Dean sits at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of whisky. The bottle sits on the table in front of him, half empty.
When Dean made his way to him, wrapped him in his arms, sheer relief written on his face, Cas’ resolve almost failed. Almost.
“Yes, he’s Cas,” Dean says, looking off into the distance of the library. “That’s not – you asked me what happened. Before.”
“Do you know how long you’ve been here? No one is saving you. You think you’re awake because of some divine intervention? You’re awake because I want you to be. Because if I have to be, then you will be. You’ve been a little thorn in my side and now I get to return the favor.”
Dean expects him to move away, the quick comfort withdrawn as fast as it is given. It’s how this usually goes.
It being the stilted silence. It being the ever-present, but unspoken echo of final words no longer final.
Cas finds release of a tension he hadn’t known he was still holding in hearing those words - the absolution he’d been seeking. Allowing himself to receive the love he’s given so freely, with no expectations, echoed back to him. Dean wants to have him. He can have Dean. Has him.
Dean flushes from the contact and the praise – he’s not sure from which more, and he isn’t going to examine that now. He just presses his face into Cas’ neck and breathes, taking in the warmth of being held, being loved, like this. This - this he can have. The thought overwhelms him.
Then the moment is over, time rushing back into place. Dean watches Cas hug Sam. He hears him talking about the Empty. Hears Sam explain where Dean had scattered Cas’ ashes.
Now, his hands are sweating as he carries it inside, balancing it in one hand and the shopping bags in the other as he struggles through the door. The action –
When a small smile crosses Cas’ face, Dean feels like he’s won the big fight all over again. Better than, even. He’d fight God every day for the rest of his life for a chance see those lines of happiness on Cas’ face again.
But some are beyond anything he could have imagined. Part of him wants to believe the Shadow has sent fake memories. But another part of him, a quiet but firm intuition, says that these are real. And that they could change everything.
With eyes fixed on Cas, Dean began to move his head forward. Cas’ vision went bright white as Dean took him into his mouth, tongue moving in maddening ways, lips tight around him. His hand worked the base while he set the pace with his mouth. Cas’ hand moved to Dean’s hair, fingers tangling in it. He couldn’t control his hips from thrusting forward, fucking Dean’s mouth, chasing the tight, wet heaven. Dean’s hand moved up to his hip to help steady him, and he rubbed little circles there, but still he took Cas down deeper, humming contentedly. Cas shuddered at the vibration, the warmth, the profane sight of Dean kneeling below him.
Cas removes his hand from Dean’s and stands, brushing dirt off his pants. Dean lets his hand drop, regretting the loss of contact, but keeps his eyes fixed on Cas’ smile. He licks his lips unconsciously, and the corner of Cas’ lips turns up further in response.
Dean nods and looks over at Cas. The road stretches out straight in front of them, clear and free of other travelers.
First, the Shadow comes as Naomi. Again, and again, she shows him how he killed Dean. Over and over. Hundreds of times. But he knows that was not real. He may have experienced the pain of the actions, but he had stopped short when it came to the real Dean. The Dean who needed him.
Finally, he breathes out a frustrated sigh and turns away to walk to his bedroom. He tells himself that it’s okay. It’s better even. He still doesn’t know what he needs to say. He’ll sleep on it and it’ll be fine in the morning.
Benny shot him a cocky smile and eased Dean’s hands down, placing his own hands on either side of Dean’s hips, supporting him.
Some stories take a while to get to where they’re meant to go. They build over time and take on a life of their own. Notes scratched out in the margins later to be revived and brought to life under the right circumstances. Memories come and go and come back again, brought forth when they are needed most.
But then the Shadow-as-Naomi shows him memories he doesn’t recall. Tells him that he can have these stolen memories back, but they’ll come with a price.
Cas isn’t sure there is a strong enough word for what it means to him, knowing that Dean had wanted to pick a place of comfort for him, and “nice” barely captures a fraction of the feeling. He doesn’t have the words to help Dean understand what it felt like waking up there in the meadow.
Cas slowly pulled his fingers from Dean’s mouth, rubbing his thumb across Dean’s bottom lips again, shiny with saliva.
They had been comfortably silent as they cleaned up in the nearby stream. Dean thought to himself then:
“I couldn’t – when he was gone, I couldn’t.” He swallows, continues. “Talking about it – I – he made a deal. Cas did. To save Jack.” Dean hears Sam draw in a quick breath at that, but he carries on before his brother can say anything, “The Empty – it told him it was going to wait. Wait until he was happy. That’s when it would take him.”
Purgatory was where he would do his penance and he had made peace with that. He would purify himself in this wasteland. He had decided that he would stay in Purgatory.
“You’re alive,” Dean whispers, one hand coming to rest on Cas’ chest, the other reaching up to gently cup his face.
“Or do you think that love will save you?” it continues. “Oh – you do. What a pathetic little creature you are.
Whenever he smells the dewy morning grass or feels the warm rays of the sun waking up, or sees Cas, standing with his face to the sky and wings fluttering in the breeze, Dean can summon up that moment in his mind – the final puzzle piece falling into place to reveal them, together, in full bloom.
Cas pushes him back against the wall of the kitchen, pinning Dean with one hand running through his hair and the other grasping his shoulder, where his handprint used to be. Dean lets out a moan that he’d be embarrassed about if he had the ability to think as Cas moves against him, lips and tongue working the way down his neck.
“Dean - I was in heaven. Jack - he made an exception. Just the one. So that I could help him.” Cas stares off, clearly recalling a memory of heaven.
“I don’t want to lose you again,” Dean says, and his face crumples at the thought. He reaches out to cradle Cas’ face in his hands, holding his gaze instead of turning away from it.
“Cas,” Dean had told him when he voiced this one night in hushed tones as they stood beside the trees nearest the river’s edge, eyes on the gentle flow of the water in front of them, “you have to let go of all that crap.”
“I know that,” Sam says, “I made Cas breakfast earlier this morning, after my run. But he didn’t really say much. What happened?”
He had no idea until this moment how much he had lost – rewritten because remembering was too much to bear. After all, how could he remember moments of pure instinct, devotion, and even love, when he had lost them?
“There wasn’t supposed to be an after, Dean. I made my peace. I made my choice.” Cas fixes Dean with the piercing stare he’s become so used to.
Dean started to tell him what he hadn’t been able to say aloud, moments before, and Cas almost let him. Almost.
But Benny understood that. And, in his own way, he believed that it was for the best, if it meant that they escaped.
Benny’s grip was firm around his shaft. His thumb rubbed the head, teasingly, before he started to work up and down Dean’s length. Dean couldn’t resist the touch, his hips involuntarily thrusting forward into the motion of it. Benny chuckled and placed messy kisses along Dean’s jaw, tightening his grip and stroking faster as Dean thrust helplessly into Benny’s hand. It’d been so long for Dean that he was done for quickly.
“The only reason I kept putting one foot in front of another was to get to you. I didn’t get it before, but I do now. Without you, there’s no me.” He laughed, but it was humorless and hollow. “And that’s fucked, I know that, and more pressure to put on you than you deserve, but it’s the truth. It’s the
Dean calls Jody up for advice, or just to chat about how she’s doing with the girls, with work, with hunting.
Dean waits in the library, thinking Cas will come looking for him after his shower. He knows that his friend has to be exhausted - coming back from the dead will do that. But they have a lot to catch up on. A lot to talk about. A lot that Dean has to figure out quickly what he wants to say.
to do that for Sam. But there was no other choice at the time - and so Dean had done it, and would do it again, when it came to Sammy.
Rowena had walked him through the steps he’d have to take once he arrived. He inhales deeply and starts on the spell she wrote down for him. Dean stumbles over the first words of the incantation, cursing himself, then hoping that doesn’t mess up the whole spell, and wishes to himself that Sam was here with him. He’s better at the Latin, the magic, all of that. But it’s just Dean. And he has to do this.
Dean isn’t sure how long they sat there. Cas was out of it when he came to. He had blinked open his eyes slowly, as if keeping them open was a struggle, and simply rumbled, “Dean.”
When he wakes and stumbles into the kitchen in the morning, he finds a note in Cas’ handwriting, “Out – back tomorrow. - Cas”
“Yeah, no – I’m –” Dean backs up and lets Cas pass by, close but not touching. They haven’t touched since Cas – since. Dean pushes that thought aside.
Dean hadn’t been able to help it. It was more touching than he’d had, outside of killing, in longer than he could remember. Not to mention the hungry look Benny gave him as he removed his finger from his mouth. Dean was captivated, and he leaned into the touch as Benny’s hand came back up toward him, behind Dean’s head this time, pulling him forward to close the distance between them.
“I thought so, too. But a week ago, the gladiolus you gave me was dying. I –” he looks sheepishly down at the ground. “I think I may have overwatered it. I had my hand to it and I was just wishing that I could fix it and – well, you see it now. So, I’ve been trying other things. I wasn’t sure about – about my wings, but I thought – maybe –”
“There are days I’m not. God, what I’ve put Sammy through in the past few months alone, you don’t even know, man.” He shakes his head, pushing that thought away and pushing forward, “I don’t deserve his forgiveness, but I’ll take it. I’ll try to be worth it. I’ll try to be the person you both think I am. But that day, Cas, I was. I was because of you.”
Dean turns slightly, swallowing as he clocks just how close Cas is to him, how he has to tilt his head up to catch Cas’ eye. The look on Cas’ face as he stares at the picture is inscrutable.
Cas brings his hand up to cover Dean’s, and closes his eyes, leaning into the touch. Dean inhales sharply, audible enough for Cas’ eyes to open at the sound.
“Sergei wasn’t the only collector,” Rowena explains when she arrives at the bunker, holding up the shimmering vial of archangel grace. “But there isn’t very much here. And I truly don’t know of more when this is gone. You’ll have four, maybe five hours to do the spell and get yourself back through the rift. That should do the trick, but just so. You’ll have to be quick. And be careful.”
– Cas had returned. Jack had popped down, looking wiser and more stare-into-your-soul all-knowing than any three-year-old had any right to be.
“I think I understand what work Jack said I needed to do. I think I needed – time. This garden. Knowing I could stay here, with you, no matter what,” he says, the last words coming out more hesitant than the first.
“Did he – he came back. He was quiet, but it was Cas.” Sam says the words like facts, but the question is implied.
“I ripped his face off, you know. You should have seen –” but the words are lost as Dean’s blade slices clean through his neck, his head landing several feet away.
“I ain’t sayin’ I like it, wastin’ all this time runnin’ ‘round here when we could be gettin’ out,” Benny said, “That bein’ said, we’ll find your feather boy, if that’s what it takes to get you to make the jump.” He had punctuated his declaration with a firm nod, as if it was that simple. Decided and that’s that.
The next time they meet is in no way intentional. Charlie is back and, immediately, decides to drag Dean’s ass into a recently opened gay bar to wingman for her. Dean manages to drag Cas along, because there’s no way he’s gonna hang out alone once Charlie fucks off.
Considering it’s been three years of a bare minimum of contact between them since (not for lack of trying from just about everyone else, but they’re both stubborn), Dean feels pretty certain that there’s no fucking way Cas is suddenly okay with his presence now.
Dean suddenly realizes he’s going to have to put his thoughts into words to communicate them. So, instead, he freezes.
Referring to those tiny cut-offs as anything even adjacent to pants seems like a joke to Dean. But. For a second he’s thinking. “Yeah not happening, sorry, man.”
He goes back to staring at his drink. He wonders how appropriate it would be to ask his Mom not to ask around about him. Not that he’s got any deep dark secrets hidden, but it’s the kind of stuff he’d rather his Mom hear from him first.
There are no mirrors in purgatory, if Dean ignores the way he can sometimes recognize a hint of his own face in the dull surface of rivers and creeks. Easy, that. He’s got better things to do, anyways.
The thing is, Dean has been building a man his entire life, but now he is no longer sure if that’s because he wanted to be a man, or because he wanted, desperately, to look like one. He’s not really sure what the difference is, between the two, which ones the tomato and which ones the tomato. He does know that he’s been wearing armor that his father gave him, and that he’s now 42 fucking years old and maybe it’s time to at least build a set of armor for himself.
Jack nods, slow and measured. “I was thinking, there’s so many genders and sexualities and I’m only two years old, it makes sense I won’t get it. So, it makes sense I don’t have any of that yet, you know?”
They don’t kiss in the mall, but Cas rolls his eyes with a scoff and Dean claps the back of his hand against the side of his arm and that’s almost the same.
Cas shrugs like the weight of the entire world rests on his shoulders. “I will respect your choice, Dean.”
She turns to the side, briefly inspects the table. “I wanted to reach out to you earlier,” she says, voice low. “You and Sammy, I just… you father, he made it pretty clear that I wasn’t welcome back.”
“I do.” Mary doesn’t quite grab Dean’s hand, but she rests her hand closer to his, a silent peace offering.
Cas turns from the clothes rack and gives Dean one of his looks. The one that seems to tell him that eternal angelic patience is not enough to get him to dig for what Dean is trying to say.
Cas had helped, when he’d rebuilt Dean’s body. He’d made his chest smaller, had encouraged his cock to grow and hair to sprout where it hadn’t before. He’d reshaped his vocal chords, slightly.
With a sigh, Dean takes in his house, then starts to make for the stairs. If he’s gonna get the place wedding-ready, he should make it visitor-ready, too. Jody’s probably gonna host some of their guests, and Sioux Falls has hotels, but Dean’s not gonna send people to a hotel when he’s got a perfectly fine house that they could live in instead.
He’d shared that thought with Dean once. Dean had laughed at him, until he was gasping for air curled up on his side. “It’s a pile of crap, actually,” he’d informed Cas with a grin and patted his back. “Good thing you don’t have to deal with it.”
Instead he just shrugs. “You should head back to your friends.” His voice sounds a lot more distant, all of a sudden. He chokes on the words.
“Dean…” He can’t hear Sam’s expression but he knows that exasperated sigh. “You know you’ll always be family, always be home. I’m not gonna be here forever, it’s just…”
When he’s human again, Dean’s not sure who he sees anymore, but it’s not like it fucking matters. He’s a dead guy walking, if he’s lucky.
And yeah, he’s not even going to think about the universe where his life is a freaking TV show. Because it begs a whole lot of question, he’s not sure he wants the answer to. It’s good that, these days, there are a lot of other questions that need answers first, instead.
Mary looks appropriately skeptical, but doesn’t say anything. Which means that once again there is a long, awkward, silence.
After hell, this is what he sees: Unbroken skin in places that used to be lined with scars, broken bones set right, the soft lines of his face the same as they were before he went to hell caked in the dirt of his own grave, a handprint burned into his shoulder. He forces himself to look away. The handprint continues to burn under his shirt, even when he doesn’t look, even when he forces himself not to think about it. A visible reminder that now that he’s free of Hell, Heaven is trying to lay a claim on him too.
Cas swallows, brings himself to back to the present. He’s in a motel. It’s daytime and The Shadow has no domain here. He’s safe. He’s with Dean.
Once topside, though, Benny had known early on that he was wrong to leave Purgatory. That he had been dreaming of a life that didn’t exist anymore. There was too much here on earth: choices, noises, regrets, desires.
Dean deepened the kiss, tongue pressing against Benny’s lips and he parted them, allowing Dean’s exploration.
“How’re you feeling?” Sam asks, as he starts pulling food out of the cabinet. He waits, so damn patient, while Dean ignore his question.
“Dean, the Shadow showed me things about Purgatory – our first time there. And I – I didn’t remember it fully either. Naomi – she must have – it doesn’t matter. The point is: it wouldn’t have changed anything, for me.” He brings his hand to rest on top of Dean’s on his chest. “I would have loved you the same as I have since I first held your soul. Dean, nothing would have changed.”
“Dean,” he says after an uncomfortably long silence. “Did you need –” He stops himself short, frown forming. “I want to go make some tea.”
Cas nods and is rewarded with an unabashed smile. Cas feels relief and not an insignificant amount of pleasure at the sight.
Cas looked at Dean with that piercing blue gaze. He knew they were both remembering a memory echoing from the past:
Sam tilts his head at Dean as if considering what to say, then slowly, as if choosing his words carefully, says, “Yeah. Like I said, he didn’t say much. But he ate. Went back to his room. Dean, is everything okay?”
“Dean,” Cas says, and Dean knows now that the way his voice rumbles his name will never not affect him. But he can’t think about that right now, because Cas continues, “I wasn’t in the Empty anymore.”
Later that week, she calls Sam with an idea. Rowena explains to him that the spell, while fairly simple, would need to be cast in a specific place – a
He doesn’t hear Cas come into the kitchen, but feels him move into place behind him, head just above his shoulder. He just barely brushes against Dean to look at the photo, but all of Dean’s attention moves instantly to that point of connection between them.
When Benny had found a gash from the fight on Dean’s arm, he brought it up to his mouth, pressing his lips against it, eyes up on Dean’s as he had licked away the blood, sucking gently. The pressure had hurt, but good, and Dean brought his hand up to Benny’s head, fingers tangled in his hair, holding him in place. Benny had groaned into it then, winked up at Dean, and kept going.
he thinks, knowing he’ll never say any of this to Cas out loud, but he can’t help the words churning through his skull:
In the Empty, Cas sees echoes in the nothing around him. He knows that they are the Shadow’s doing, but that doesn’t make them any less painful, because they were once real: the hurt look on Dean’s face when he learned of his betrayal, that he was working with Crowley. The fear in his eyes as he tells him to bow down and profess his love to him, the new God. The devastation at what he does to Sam’s mind.
Now, though, the longshot felt out of reach. What offering, what atonement, could be worthy of what he was asking for in return?
Cas raises an eyebrow, still frowning, like he is trying to piece together a puzzle that he’s certain is missing a few pieces. The picture out of focus.
“I’m glad,” Cas says, softly, looking down at his hands. He’s not sure what to say. He knows you keep gifts. Dean made it very clear that that mattered. What does it mean that he saved it from the flames, kept it for himself? He wouldn’t think it meant anything, except for the way Dean said it.
Dean took Benny back in his other hand, thumb swirling over the head of his cock, fingers wrapped firmly, picking back up the rhythm where he left off. Between the feeling of Benny drinking from him, and the steady motion as he worked his hand up and down the length of Benny’s cock, he had been utterly lost to the sensations. Through a haze, he could hear Benny moaning and could feel the vibration of the sound pulse against his skin under Benny’s mouth.
“If you don’t know by now that you’re forgiven for everything – that I will always forgive you – I don’t know what to tell you. But if you’ll let me,” Dean said, shifting beneath Cas’ arm, eyes searching to catch Cas’ gaze, “I could try to show you.”
It’s Dean’s turn to frown. “Why would –” he starts, before pausing to tamp down his frustration at himself, that Cas would even feel the need to ask. “This is your h-” he tries again, but the words won’t make it out.
Sam had told him that while remnants of Cas’ fading grace might remain, he would be mostly-human. And mostly-humans snore like buzzsaws after a long night of being raised from the Empty.
So, his prayer has become the same words, repeated again and again. They are the words that he couldn’t find to say when they mattered most:
The first thing Cas does when they arrive is mumble “shower” and slouch into the bunker. At least he can walk on his own.
He’d thought that was a spark of faith - just the smallest flicker. A new idea for him at that time in his life. But he had no idea back then what faith was. He would, though.
Suddenly, Cas is knocked to his hands and knees by a searing pain in his skull, sparks shooting behind his eyes. He thinks that this must just be another punishment from the Shadow, but then he hears it shrieking.
It wasn’t something Dean had given much thought. But he had eyes, and he’d seen the way Benny’s would flick down when they talked. And in the moment, being taken over completely sounded like paradise. Dean knew that there would be the possibility that Benny could himself lose control, could drink too much from him; there was nothing Dean could do in the moment to stop him. But to give up control was the best kind of release for Dean and this was giving the ultimate control, and he wanted to surrender to it completely.
He finishes off the second vampire, the second of Benny’s killers, and gathers their heads. He sets down his bag containing his supplies for the second part of the spellwork.
. The word he so rarely allowed himself to even think. “Whatever you want, Dean,” he said, slowly, voice a deep rumble, “it’s yours.”
“Heard you talkin’ to yourself last night,” Benny said by way of a good morning greeting, as Dean shifted, still waking up, and pushed himself up from the spot beneath the tree that had served as his bed the night before.
“Dean?” He’s not sure how long he’s been quiet, but Sam’s voice is soft enough for him to have a decent idea. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be there too, it’s just…”
Castiel has learned new things about Dean’s body since then, too. He’s learned where he likes to be touched and where he doesn’t. Where he’d once used his grace to build his skin, he can now run his fingers, dig them into him where his body gives, softly. He knows what Dean tastes like, and the sounds that escape him when Cas tastes him, the way his breath hitches and his thighs squeeze around Cas.
In a Dream he sees a weird nightmare version of himself. Nightmare-Dean tells him the exact kind of shit Dean didn’t need to hear. Dean sees a version of himself with black eyes, blood splattered around his face, and for once he doesn’t need longer than a split second to recognize himself. Maybe it’s easier, looking into the future.
Dean lets out a chuckle to diffuse the electricity between them. “I think I grew out of my butch phase, honestly,” he says with a lop-sided smile. There are old pictures, somewhere, of Dean in a too-big leather jacket, hair buzzed, wearing too many layers to hide as much of his body as possible. “She wears it better than me, anyways.”
Once he’s back, there’s mirrors again, which makes it harder to ignore the face that looks back at him.
Cas hums, either in agreement or because he’s mildly pissed, now that he’s less busy taking care that Dean doesn’t fall apart. “I won’t take the choice from you, Dean,” he says eventually, into the silence between them. “Even if I don’t understand it.”
Since then, Castiel has Fallen, has regained his grace, and has given it up again. He understands the human intricacies of gender better, now, understands what it means for a body to be wholly his. He knows he wouldn’t have wanted to take a vessel with a body much different from Jimmy Novak’s. Not without changing it in some of the ways Dean has changed his own.
“Are you a woman?” It’s the first question that comes to mind. The thought makes Sam feel… vaguely like something is attempting to rip out of her.
Now it’s Cas’ turn to make a soft sound, inspecting Dean’s body, slowly, in the mirror. “I wouldn’t change you, not without you telling me to,” he seems to settle on, eventually. “Too many have made decisions about your body, I wouldn’t want to be among them. Not if I can help it.”
When Eileen lays a hand gently on Dean’s back at the end of the night and half-smiles at him reassuringly, he wants to scream. He’s not quite sure why, so instead, he forces a half-smile in return.
“No, I’m not talking about this again, man. I mean it - you ask me again and I’ll break your nose. Just find a way to get him back.”
“Oh yes,” the Shadow says, “you see now. I saw more than you knew the first time you came to visit. More than you could know.
Dean forces himself to look at Jack – really look at him – for the first time: his awkward posture, so unsure in his body; his hopeful eyes flickering between Cas and Dean, seeking out approval; and his smile, tentative but full of joy that rivals Dean’s to have Cas back.
“I know you are,” Benny had chuckled again, and rolled his hips against Dean teasingly. He could feel Dean twitch beneath him at the contact and groaned as he moved against him. “Want you just like this.”
“Jack needed me in heaven. Now, you need me here. I don’t know what use I can be anyway like this. I tried, but I don’t have my powers anymore” Cas lets of a heavy sigh and continues, “Tell me, Dean - how did you feel about finding out that Chuck had been writing your story, making your choices for you? Where does what I chose fit in with what everyone needs from me?”
“Dean, if you say that it was your fault, I swear-“ Sam cuts himself off with a frustrated shake of his head.
“Cas, hold on a minute,” Dean had said after an hour or so of walking, waving Benny to scout on ahead. Cas turned to face him, keeping his face neutral as best he could.
Cas takes Dean’s hand and leads him down the hall to his bedroom. Dean’s mind is blank– empty of any thought other than Cas.
When Sam and Eileen visit, he cooks that healthy shit Sam loves, just because it makes him smile. He and Eileen eat bacon cheeseburgers. Cas has a little bit of everything. They talk late into the night every time.
Cas had been hesitant to return the hug. A part of him, a painful part that ached with regret, didn’t believe then that he deserved it – that comfort, that indulgence.
He takes out his knife, slicing a deep gash into his hand. His blood drips onto the pile of ingredients below, sealing the spell. He wraps a handkerchief around his hand, chest tightening with a familiar ache as he recalls the electric spark of Cas healing him, which he had always done - even when they were fighting.
He tries the hat on and looks at Dean, feeling, if he had to put a word on the emotion, self-conscious.
Dean had brought his other hand up to Benny’s jaw, pulling him up and turning his head so that their eyes met.
No water is running when he pokes his head into the bathroom. He walks the halls and finds that Cas’ bedroom door is shut. He can’t hear any sound of movement on the other side of the door, but he stands there for a few minutes, hand hovering near the doorknob.
Cas understood intuitively that Dean needed his help here. That he was out of his depth. He tried to reassure him, saying, “It’s okay, Dean. Whatever you need, it’s yours.”
Some were said only in his mind, others voiced aloud for whomever, whatever, to hear. He was beyond caring what else might come for him. Not if it meant his words might reach Cas.
But then Dean had broken into a grin and swiped his hand across Cas' cheek, granting himself that freedom in the moment, and Cas had been unable to resist leaning into the touch, if only for a moment, though his face remained troubled.
He was certain he hadn’t fully understood the meaning of being grateful before waking up in that meadow, surrounded by blackberries and wildflowers. The soothing sounds of a nearby brook, a light breeze, and songbirds had been the only thing breaking the silence around him as he stood still in the light, giving thanks.
Dean pulled back, smiling slightly at Cas’ groan from the loss of contact, and, green eyes locked on blue the whole time, he sank down to his knees in front of Cas.
Dean closes his eyes to keep the tears welling up from falling, his mouth forming a grim line. He nods once.
Dean flinches at the words that had angered him so much just days before. He looks down at the floor.
Cas closes the gap between them as Dean finishes his last word. Their first kiss is soft and gentle, an exhale after a long held breath.
Dean had agreed to his plan – so long as they found the angel and took him along. Fine. He’d waited long enough, and while he thought the idea was a damn foolish one – an angel being a beacon for danger, bringing every fanged creature in the forest gunning for them – if that was what it would take, he’d find the feathered thing that Dean was so attached to.
Replacing that voice with his own takes time and more effort than he wants to put forth most days, but he’s found that, like everything in life, it gets easier with practice. His own voice gets stronger the more he uses it, and he likes how that feels. Even easier is letting the voices of his loved ones drown it out, giving the weight due to their words to let them smother the ghost of John’s. The combination of both efforts gives him hope that one day he’ll wake up and the haunting will be over. Even if that day never comes, he knows now how to fend off the lies and hurt.
“Cas, I didn’t get a chance before. I never allowed myself the chance – there’s things I want to say. Things I need you to hear.” Cas’ face softens, and his eyes don’t leave Dean’s face. Dean would usually get flustered under the intensity of his gaze, but he briefly thinks that they’re well passed that now and moves forward to close the space between them.
Jack had been trying to get passage to the Empty but hadn’t been able to find a way before Dean went through the rift to perform his spell. Now, though, his message by way of the new Death to grant him passage in the Empty has been accepted.
But time is a thief, and like always - steals it away before long. Dean drops his hand down to the table and Cas slowly pulls back his own.
Cas closed his eyes, trying to fight the emotions battling their way to the surface. How could he say no to Dean telling him he needed him. Openly begging him - showing a vulnerability that he so rarely allowed anyone to see. But a small part of him had hurt, still, at being a need to Dean and not a want. He pushed that aside. He opened his eyes again, and he simply said, “Okay, Dean.”
He rolls his shoulders and, with the movement and a fluttering sound, unfurls his wings. He stretches them out, letting them spread behind him. The blues and greens of his feathers matching the sky and grass; the reds, yellows, oranges, and violets standing out, vibrant against them; all of them colors of Cas’ garden; all of them iridescent as they catch in the sunlight.
should have turned my back on you. And I damn sure should have brought you back topside after you saved Sam.”
The light hits just the right angle, blinding him for a moment, and in it, Dean sees a flash of white in his mind. His mouth goes dry and his heart races. He can’t stop the image once summoned by his memory. In the flash of light, he sees Lucifer’s blade piercing Cas’ back. He closes his eyes, tight to block out the light, and pushes the memory away.
When Sam relays this to Dean, his brother is quiet. He has the same empty lack-of-expression on his face that has been in place for months. It’s as if all of the light has been tamped out from inside of him, and all that’s left are the crumbling ruins of an abandoned temple; that he’s still standing is nothing but a tribute to Cas.
Dean’s only gone to the upper floor of the house once or twice, because the floorboards didn’t look like something he ever wanted to step on, and he’d only ever slept in the library anyways when staying with Bobby, so turning it into a permanent bedroom didn’t really make a difference. Not like there were any books left, either.
“Wanna get outta here?” Dean asks instead of doing any of that, one eyebrow cocked suggestively. “I don’t think Charlie’s coming home tonight.”
“They say love is in your heart,” Castiel breathes heavily against the side of Dean’s neck, and earns a surprised laugh for his troubles.
That’s… far from what Castiel had been expecting, and he has to let the question sink in. “Not in a long time,” he says eventually, thinking back on his own confused jealousy at the open affection between Dean and every woman he’d ever desired. Jealousy was a sin, and it had, perhaps, been one of Castiel’s first ones.
“Angels don’t have a concept of gender,” Cas says, softly, like he’s explained this many times. “Neither has... divinity itself, I suppose. Few gods ascribe to western ideas of gender the way society does, these days. Prophecy... never called for a
“Dad can I tell you something?” Jack’s voice is small, like he’s scared of the answer, for whatever reason that may be.
Sam pulls his most ‘how are you this stupid’ face. Fair enough. “Yeah, I don’t think that’s true, Dean. “
"Cas is my best friend," Dean amends, carefully. Best friend, roommate, love of his life, but that part he doesn't want to share with a stranger, even if said stranger is his mother.
Good thing, too, because it means he had time to finally meet up with Mary after months of trying to avoid doing so.
It's good enough for Dean, who hangs up with a relieved sigh, then tosses the phone onto the coffee table and closes his eyes while he waits for Cas to actually get back.
“Hey Dean,” she tells him, impossibly sweet, and just for a moment everything slips back into place. It shouldn’t feel this important, to just hear his Mom say his name, but it does.
Dean doesn’t quite manage the energy to nod. There’s a storm inside his chest and he feels himself taking a few shuddering breaths that burn in his throat. Figures. Cas next to him is a calm and steady presence.
As always Cas nails him with one sentence, and Dean has to look away, fiddle absent-mindedly with one of the bracelets around his wrist. “Yeah, well.” Not much else to say there, really. “Still feels stupid, being scared of your own Mom.”
Dean sighs. “We got roomed together, kinda made friends out of necessity, stayed in contact after.” He shrugs, pretending like it’s not a big deal. “Then I needed a place to stay and he’d inherited an empty townhouse. Two birds, one stone. Three birds, if you count our other roommate.” An inadequate summary for a long and painful story, but more than he’s willing to share with most.
That’s the words she leaves with, leaving Dean with Cas, an unfinished round of a word game, and a deep desire to get completely wasted.
“Y’know, I always wondered, since you brought me back I guess, why you didn’t just... change me. My body, I mean.”
The rings on his hand feel like they weigh several tons as he gives his mother a hesitant wave across the bar. He wonders where the fuck this ranks for awkward interactions.
Castiel has always known Dean’s body. Or at least he has since knitting him back together, after hell, when Dean’s soul had rested with him. He’d been pure grace then, uncontained waves and energies, buzzing with a restlessness he had not yet been able to name. It may as well have been the entirety of his existence.
So, with the mirror shit figured out, of course life finds a new curveball to throw at him. When he’s 26, Dean stands over the dead body of a shifter that took his appearance, and with it, apparently the contents of his head.
“I’ve wondered in the past, if… certain things, if they would be easier, if I’d taken a female vessel instead of Jimmy.” Sam can imagine what he might mean. “At the time I chose him based on proximity and how likely he was to say yes, but many people would have been fit to be my vessel, not just Jimmy and Claire.”
Dean forces himself to not think about how easy it was, to look at himself, to see the face that he should know is his and think ‘this is a monster’.
"I am Castiel," he introduces himself, a little stiff but managing to sound polite nevertheless. "Dean and I are… roommates."
“What do you mean, Cas is staying with me?” Dean asks Sam incredulously. He’d been clearing out the trash and his upbeat work playlist is still blaring until he hits Stop on the ancient tape deck he’d rescued from a garage sale.
At age 16, Dean spent a lot more time in front of mirrors, even if he spent a lot of time insisting otherwise to Sammy. A lot of work went into looking as good as he did, but it still had to seem effortless. Dean wouldn’t tell Sammy about the way he avoided looking into his own eyes, even while cutting or styling his hair. He didn’t like the kid looking back at him, soft and childish even after the shit he’d already seen. Being taken seriously by other hunters was a battle and a half already when he was stuck with his Dad all the time, he didn’t need to look like a fucking baby, too.
“Humans don’t usually do that, buddy, it’s okay.” Dean likes to wrap himself around Cas when they are together like this. Something about them touching each other with as much of their bodies as possible.
Yeah, there’s been the whole deathbed confession but come on, the thing with saving anything for the moment you’re literally dying is that you don’t have to live with the consequences of your actions.
“Feels like I still am.” Dean breathes out sharply, a huff that’s too angry to be a sigh. “I wanna fucking stop wearing the jacket.”
“Fine.” Dean turns to stare down the completely fucking deserted road again. There’s been nothing but corn for the past hour, and before that it’d been wheat. When they get really lucky, there’s some cows to mix things up between fields. “Why d’you always gotta be such a girl about this shit.”
Dean Winchester is still an expert on how to build a Man, but he knows that the man is no longer who he is. He knows how to take that man apart now, too, and what the person underneath looks like.
Jack smiles. “Lee said I could pick my own name, but I think I still want to be Jack, because that’s the name my mom picked for me.”
They do kiss in the car, because the Impala is Dean’s true shell against the outside world. She’s yet another thing inherited from his father, like his genetic disposition for mood disorders and addiction, but she, by now, is Dean through-and-through, in every crook and former dent or scratch. He knows that even if he ever manages to shed every last part of John Winchester that has burrowed into his DNA and synapses (he won’t, but it’s nice to imagine, sometimes), even then he’d still keep her.
, that is what humanity made of it. An error in translation.” He leans his head so his cheek rests on Dean’s shoulder. “And later an error in communication. I didn’t understand it, gender. Couldn’t have, really, at least not then.”
And, shit, what’s he supposed to say to that. “Right.” Dean starts the engine, and they drive out of town. At one point Sam pulls out some wipes to remove the make-up, slowly, methodically, the way she does everything these days. When Dean turns to look at her again, he can see his sister for a split second, before the blank indifference of Sam’s expression registers.
Dean wonders how many more times he’s going to have to look at alternate versions of himself. He looks older, in 2014, and he can appreciate some of the changes, at least aesthetically. Wondering about how he gets his hands on hormones in the fucking end times is a question for another day, though. And his appearance is the only thing he can appreciate about this twisted mirror.
Cas sighs and wraps himself around Dean by the back. He’s in sweatpants and a soft t-shirt, one of Dean’s old ones that looks at least one size too tight on him. So, perfect, for Dean’s purposes at least.
“Anna would have been better at explaining it,” Cas sounds almost sorry for being unable to describe… understanding emotions. “She had a way with words. We talked about… humanity, though not long.”
The words don’t come out, though. “Yeah,” Dean manages to press out, tongue heavy. “Yeah, she’s… she’s very cool, Sammy.” Close enough.
“We are afraid of things for a reason,” Cas responds like the two-semesters-of-psychology-classes asshole he is. He moves from the armchair towards the couch, pushing Dean until they’re sitting next to each other.
“Yeah, I know, she’s still figuring herself out.” Dean breathes. “I’m fucking forty and I got no fucking clue who I am. Ever since… ever since the mess with Chuck. I was just this—I was just this guy he made to do what he wanted; you know. Gave me my fucking dad’s jacket and I said ‘Yes, sir’ and put it fucking on.”
Mary looks like she doesn't quite buy that, which is fair. It’s a woefully inadequate word to describe Cas-and-Dean as a unit. But she also doesn’t press further. Dean wants to both hate and love her for it.
That had been five years ago. Dean seeks eye contact with Cas, which he answers with a soft smile. Very aware of Mary’s gaze on him, he tears his eyes away quickly. Thankfully she doesn’t ask for more.
“I love you so fucking much,” Dean breathes out. It’s still hard for him, saying that, so Cas smiles.
They get Cas back, eventually. They always do manage to get him back, no matter what. Dean’s not even sure what it involved this time.
“I’m not interrupting anything?” Mary asks once she’s at their table with one meaningful look between Cas and Dean.
They both take a long moment to pull apart from each other, but eventually Dean lets go of Cas’ coat. Cas gets up, then helps him stand too, and they begin actually getting ready for bed in earnest.
Cas grins. “We can’t have that, can we?” He slides down Dean’s body and takes his cock in his mouth while he fingers him, until Dean grabs his hair, pushes himself against him, rides his fingers and mouth through his climax. “Nobody has touched your body more intimately than I,” he hums against the skin of his stomach, touching his own hard cock as he does. “I have held your soul within my grace, my waves have swept through your pores, your nerves, your cells. And I have held you, like this, so many times.” He comes soon after at the sight of Dean’s wide-eyed look down at him.
By the time Dean’s 26 he’s got the mirror shit mostly figured out. Yeah, he still doesn’t spend too much time around them unless he can’t help it, but he can recognize his own face in them without having to carefully reconstruct it from its individual pieces again and again. A stupid thing to have to take baby steps about, but for all he knows it’s like this for everyone else.
They manage to pay for their drinks and let Charlie know that they’re heading home with surprising speed. It’s a good thing, too, because Dean feels raw and antsy, the kind of mood that’s led to him too drunk to stand or in the middle of a brawl more than once. Sobriety’s probably always going to feel like a knock-down drag-out fight to him, but times like this it’s worse than usual.
Cas, the Almost-Human, who has Fallen again and again in every way imaginable, he looks at Dean, really looks at him, when he’s wearing nothing but jeans and a t-shirt, when he puts on bright pink cowboy shoes and a matching hat with a wide grin, when he does his first testy twirl in a summer-y pleated skirt, and he knows that he may have no clue about how to build a man, but he now knows how to construct one Dean Winchester perfectly, over and over again.
“I’m getting rooms ready,” Dean says, after a moment of silence. “If he wants to stay over, he can.” Because Cas also needs to agree to doing so, which is probably where the issue’s gonna lie anyways. Why the hell would Cas want to stay at his place when he can sleep at Jody’s, or a crap, by-the-hour motel with mystery stains on the sheets and water ranging from freezing to lukewarm.
“We were accompanying a friend,” Cas says eventually, once he realizes Dean isn’t going to verbally backpedal. “She found… different company, a lot faster than expected.”
There’s an audible sigh of relief from the other end of the line. “So you’re good?” The second half of that sentence remains unspoken, but they can both hear it.
Castiel… Castiel leans towards Jack to gently wrap an arm around his shoulder, to briefly squeeze. Jack is rarely comfortable with being touched by anyone but those closest to him, but now he leans into the partial hug, lets his phone fall to the side. “I’ve got this friend,” he tells Castiel, after a moment. “We… we met online. They’ve got more than one father too.”
Cas freezes, then turns to look at Jack. The fear in Jack’s voice makes him run through several worst-case scenarios in his head, but he tries not to let any of them show on his face. “Of course,” he tells him, keeping his own voice low so it doesn’t disturb Sam and Dean in the front.
Dean can't quite get himself to meet her eyes when they separate again. He’d known what to expect, at least in parts, after a handful of awkward mails and two terse phone calls. But seeing Mary for the first time, he realizes, is a whole different beast to wrestle. More of a bear than the lion he’d expected. There’s a bitterness bubbling up inside him, like he has any right to a woman who left him 30 years ago.
It’s another long midnight drive. Castiel doesn’t recognize the mixtape Dean has put into the tape deck, but he does recognize a few of the songs from the various tapes he’s given him over the past weeks, months, years.
“I love you,” Castiel says, simple. They have said it many times before, but he knows the ways the words still cause Dean’s heart to flutter. “If love truly rests in the heart, it is good I can no longer reach into your chest to touch it.”
Sam is silent, but Dean doesn’t need to see his little brother to know the face journey he’s going through. He can hear a series of deep breaths like his brother is some kind of agitated horse. “Oh.”
Castiel looks down at Jack, who looks like he’s much smaller than before. “You are still very young, Jack, and you have had other things on your mind.”
Dean nods, because yeah, fair, he’s not even really sure what the fuck is up either. He turns to curl towards where Cas is lying in bed, wiggling into his arms. “Love you,” he hums, softly. “I owe you.”
Dean’s been mostly pensive, but eventually he seems to muster up the courage to say what’s been on his mind. “Cas you ever wonder what it’d be like if you were a woman?”
“We don’t have to do anything today,” Cas points out very reasonably, with one pointed look at Dean’s hand.
“Yeah.” The wave of adrenaline that had made Dean stop his car and jump out to go shopping for clothes has abated a couple minutes ago.
“Angels don’t have… we predate the modern western construct of gender, and most versions that came before.”
Dean almost chokes on his drink. “We’re not--,” he starts, hastily, then sees Mary’s look, which is both teasing and surprisingly tender.
Cas shakes his head and peppers more kisses against Dean’s bare skin. “I haven’t held your heart since then.”
Dean Winchester has built a man through layers. Layers of flannels and shirts and leather jackets. He knows exactly how a man should carry himself, how a man should speak and where a man’s hands must be at all times. He’s built a man around himself like a fortified shell-- if you’d ask him, he’d say like one of those formations the Romans did. A Man is shields and spears pointed outwards to protect what’s inside, and to attack when necessary.
“Lemme know how that works out for you.” Dean gives Cas a pat on the shoulder, which may as well have been a long and passionate kiss in their language of public displays of affection.
At least until the door closes behind them. “Mary upset you,” Cas states. More words between them go unspoken as Dean just looks at Cas’ face. Most of those words are
Mary tilts her head towards where she’d been sitting before. “Meeting old friends. Making new ones.”
“Course we would’ve wanted you.” Dean feels like a little kid again, like he’s reassuring his parents after yet another argument, like he’s consoling his father after he’d drowned himself in a bottle, like he’s telling Sammy that everything’ll be alright. His voice sounds so much smaller than he feels. “You’re our Mom.”
“Fuck, I got no idea, Cas.” Dean slumps, like he’d much rather have this conversation anywhere else. “If I knew I—I think I’d have stopped trying, you know? Like, Sam just knew what she wanted.”
“I love it.” Dean looks at Cas and thinks about how much he loves him, how he thinks he couldn’t have loved him even more, but then he looks at the jacket, which should be a grim reminder of just one of the times he had to fucking bury Cas, but instead it feels like a giant neon sign that just reads ‘
“But you understand it now?” Dean grabs Cas’ hand, twines their fingers together, allows himself to enjoy a moment of gentle intimacy.
With a small grunt, Dean slides further towards the wall in his booth, then gestures wordlessly at the empty space as an offer to Mary.
Bobby Singer would say the same, but mean it differently. There’d be something in his eyes, a sense of deeper understanding, an unspoken reassurance that he won’t be the one to decide if you became a man.
“Some of them are women. I wouldn’t choose another body now, of course, not as long as I can remain within Jimmy’s, but I am glad his body is mine. I… doubt I would feel as attached, had I chosen a woman as my vessel.”
These days, they rarely all take the same car anymore. It’s easier to have at least two cars at their disposal, so Cas takes his truck, and Dean takes the Impala and they split on whatever case it is they’re working.
When he’s got Michael trapped in his own head, he gives him a taste of his own medicine, at least kind of. He stares into the mirror, trying to put the pieces he sees together so they form his own face, but all he sees is the archangel.
Dean laughs, like he’s won a fight. In a way he has, since pancakes are a good time for everyone. “Damn straight I do.”
There’s a long stretch of silence before Dean decides to let Sam win just for the hell of it. “I think there’s a Biggerson’s coming up, you wanna get lunch?”
Their hug is stiff, and awkward, but it's a hug all the same. Mary doesn't smell like home, she smells like smoke and motor oil. She smells like work.
Castiel had, at the time, taken few liberties with the influence he took on Dean’s body. The intricacies of human gender had seemed impossible to understand, like yet another one of those things that elevated Humanity above Angels.
Three years later, Dean has more important things to worry about than what he looks like. There’s a contract on his name, and honestly, he doesn’t give a shit about looking good when he’s dragged to hell. Not like the demons are going to give a shit. Not like he’s going to look good once they start carving into him.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean murmurs after a moment, then gestures for Cas to get up again, kisses him long and deep, a pleased hum in his throat. “You should talk disembowelment to me more often.”
“Dude, everyone wants to be a girl sometimes. It’s normal, girls are cool, who wouldn’t want to be one?”
The demon enjoys his reflection and spends a lot of time looking at himself. It’s understandable, really—the last time Dean had felt the pull of the Pit touching his soul, his body had been little more than a skeleton dressed in blood-soaked tatters of skin. Now, though, he’s gorgeous, knows exactly how to smile and how to sneer to get what he wants.
Instead, Sam had asked, with his voice small, in the tone Dean associates with having to sneak him to the library, or soccer practice, or anywhere else where Dad didn’t want either of them, “Hey, do you think we could do the wedding at… your place?”
Mary stares at him, eyes open wide. Then she presses her lips into a thin line and nods. “He saw me… with another woman.”
If you asked John Winchester what made a man, he’d just say that you either are or you ain’t, no science about it.
Dean huffs a bitter laugh, because yeah that did sound like John motherfucking Winchester. “Yeah, well, no hard feelings,” he lies. He has plenty of feelings, and most of them are hard, but it doesn’t seem fair to Mary to dump that responsibility on her.
“Yeah?” She tilts her head and if it weren’t so fucking uncanny, Dean would almost laugh at her shitty imitation of Cas. “So?”
“I could’ve had a Mom. This whole time, if she’d just… if she’d just bothered to pop in a couple years earlier.” Maybe he wouldn't feel like this, if she had. Scared, of coming out to his fucking lesbian Mom who just ran into him in a gay bar where he basically admitted to being some kind of regular.
“An exhausting number of them.” Castiel sounds aggrieved by the entire thing. “But that was nothing new.”
Most of them are lessons taught by monsters, by claws and teeth and bullets. Some of them, Castiel knows, were taught by John. Those are lessons he is glad are no longer reflected on Dean’s skin. Others are ones Dean taught himself, a scar on the inside of his left hand, cuts and slashes on his arms, injection marks on his thighs. Those come back eventually, despite Castiel’s help.
He takes a long drink from his glass. “If your new friends try to tell you about anything I may or may not have done on stage--,” he pulls a face, mostly at the thought of his (clean, but still) laundry getting aired out accidentally. “It’s probably true, but don’t listen to them, okay?”
If Dean had hoped he could ease into coming out to his mother more than he had been able to with John he was, honestly, kidding himself.
“So,” he hears himself saying, “How have you been, Mary?” He goes for a conversational tone, but it comes out more tense than he’d intended.
Dean had never thanked him for it, but Cas had also never confirmed the suspicions he’d harbored that Cas had been the one behind the changes, and not just a warped perception of how he’d looked, before Hell.
Dean’s proud of his space. Which doesn’t mean he isn’t aware of the fact that it very much looks like the place of a 45 year-old bachelor. Could be worse, could be the place of a 45 year-old divorcee. It’s a close thing, but he’s gotta cling to whatever he’s got.
“Don’t strain yourself on my behalf, darling,” Dean’s grip on Cas’s sleeve has loosened and he turns to look his partner in the eyes. “I like it when you get mean.”
Michael loves mirrors, loves looking at himself in them. They’re one of the few places he’ll let Dean catch a breath of air, probably because he senses the way they make him feel off-kilter and unbalanced even now, taking a second to recognize the face looking at him. It makes him feel even more trapped than he had before, and he’s almost glad when Michael pushes him under again. At least he won’t have to look at the bastard, then.
The shifting sound of his coat implies a shrug. “We are all still unique beings, Sam. And I still don’t know if I understand it. Gender. It seems silly, sometimes, especially…”
Dean doesn’t cling to Cas on their way back, but he does grab his hand tighter than he usually would, feeling surprisingly clammy in the dry spring night. Neither of them says anything. Cas's always been good at comforting silences, and Dean rarely finds his words in moments like this.
Dean and Sam are bickering in the front when Jack turns to look at Cas from his phone’s screen. He’s gotten really into TikTok lately, which Cas knows is an app popular with young people these days but doesn’t comprehend much beyond that. There are videos, and a lot of floating text and weird faces.
“Wasn’t sure you’d wanna…,” Dean manages to choke out. Separation hasn’t been working well for him, even if he’d been the first to move out of the bunker. He’d also been the last one to actually settle in one place.
The past years have seen Singer Salvage improve from ‘a burned-out husk that had been standing abandoned for eight years’ more and more towards ‘living conditions’ but that doesn’t mean the place is anywhere near a state where it could host a whole fucking wedding.
Spoke too fucking soon. “You always wanted to try?” Dean decides to get in the fucking car at last because he’s not having this talk in a Walmart parking lot. “Make-up?”
Every morning and evening, Dean Smith looks into a mirror, his eye trained to spot as many mistakes as possible. On his first day at Sandover, there had been a fading bruise on his neck, one that he is glad to see gone after a week. Not remembering how he got the bruise is almost as unnerving as its presence is in general. Either way, he needs to lose some weight, so he goes on a diet.
Thankfully, Sam shakes her head. “I was just curious. I always wanted to try, it seemed like the right time.”
It’s the end, the real end of it all, when he really pays attention to his reflection again. It’s not on purpose, just a flash in the side of a window even, not a real mirror, that catches his attention. There’s a dark print on the jacket he’s been wearing ever since—the jacket he’s been wearing. Blood, he recognizes, uneasily, pressed into the fabric on his left shoulder in the shape of a hand.
Between old clothing that looks just like what John Winchester may have worn, Dean slowly begins building himself a new armor.
“Her experience was different to mine. She chose to Fall, and all that came with it. She chose the body she’d grow up in, the woman she’d become.” Cas sounds wistful, almost. Sam wonders, what the relationship between Cas and Anna had been. She’d barely known either of them, at the time. “It was important to her, that she be born as a woman. I never understood that, until now.”
Neither of them is going to admit to the other to being a romantic sap over the phone, but they’ve said enough to know.
Every single one of Sam’s expressions is smug now unless she’s trying to seem less like a fucking weirdo. She’s not trying now. “I thought so too.”
Sam realizes she and Cas barely spend any time alone together. She now knows it’s at least partially thanks to the fucking Gadreel mess, but even before then… Cas tended to stick with Dean. Being alone with him for what may be the first time in ages was… weird, especially since this time didn’t involve any vague hostility from Cas.
They snag a booth, Dean and Cas across the table from Mary. If he looks out of the window, Dean can see Mary’s sensible car parked across from Cas’ truck. It helps the fluttering of his nerves, as does leaning to the side against the window..
“If I had been in a different body when I fell, I may have sought out ways to alter my appearance, or my presentation. But Jimmy Novak... his body suits the image I enjoy having of myself.”
He looks at Cas, not Mary, because Cas, despite not really saying anything so far is the kind of steadying presence he
Dean hadn’t expected the call from Sammy about the wedding. He had expected an invitation, hell, he’d already been looking at flights, because he loves the kid but Sam’s the kind of person to get spontaneously hitched without warning halfway across the country.
“Every scar’s a lesson learned,” Dean had said, one day. “Some of ‘em stupider than others, but they’re still lessons.”
“But you no longer are,” Cas says, as gently as he can. There’s not a lot about the past year that he’d like to relive.
“But I have held your body since then. Touched you with more than just my grace.” He lets his hands roam over Dean’s body as much as he can, brushes a thumb gently over one of his nipples. His other hand speeds up its rhythm, stroking Dean in the way Cas knows he likes, in a way that shortens his breath and will, cause him to press down against his touch.
Dean didn’t, until now. He reaches over to attempt to grab the book, but Sam dodges him easily. “Dude what’s the deal?”
Now, though, with a wedding on the horizon, Dean is forced to look at the shape of the place. The downstairs is renovated, partially on his own, part of it with help from friends he’s made in Sioux Falls and, when he’d admitted to needing them, actual paid professionals. The furniture is mostly second-hand shit with a few key exceptions, mixed together wildly. He keeps his space clean, at least, and owns enough for it to actually look
Dean freezes. “No.” It sounds like a lie, even though he and Cas hadn’t even really been talking, just fucking around on their phones playing word games together. How that’d become a date night activity he’s got no idea, but he also isn’t complaining.
“Don’t,” he hisses into the phone. “Just. Don’t. Don’t act like we’re kids who just gotta make up, Sam, it’s not that fucking easy.” Dean grimaces at his own tone.
Next to him, Mary is silent for a long time. “You know, I'll always love you,” she says eventually, and suddenly Mary sounds like his Mom. When he looks at her, he sees Mary again.
He does, though, one day at a time, in bright colors and patterns. For their anniversary, Cas orders him a jacket with custom embroidery on the back. A meadow in spring, a small creek running through tall grass, blue skies, a windmill in the back, like a silent guardian over the peaceful scene. It’s a place Dean would easily recognize anywhere.
Cas grins and slips lower, far enough to dip inside of Dean. He’s wet and warm, like life often is. “It might be like glimpsing at an angels true form. Perhaps it would kill me, to touch you like that again.”
The conversation pauses, but not for long, this time picked up again by Dean. “So, you know what we’re doing here, what brings you to a place like this?” He almost adds ‘Mom’, but bites it back at the last second.
Cas narrows his eyes, because Dean did get a little bit dressed up. Not enough to warrant getting grilled by his mother about it. Jesus fucking christ.
There’s another long silence of Dean listening to Sam picking his words carefully. Before Sammy can speak up again, though, he quickly jumps in with. “Hey, Cas just got back with groceries, talk later?”
Cas shakes his head. “When I returned your Soul to your body, I held your heart within my grace to start its beat. I didn’t know… didn’t understand, the way people associate hearts with love. It was just another part of your body.” One of his hands slips between them, brushes through the hair on Dean’s chest, the happy trail under his belly button, lower, until he finds his cock and strokes it softly.
“Um, d’you wanna head inside?” Dean tilts his head towards the diner they’d decided to meet at as neutral ground.
Castiel the Angel would give a clinical answer. He knows the ways in which the molecules of a man fit together, how his soul fits between them.
