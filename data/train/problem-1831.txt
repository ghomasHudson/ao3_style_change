Sherlock lifts his chin. "You know that I can tell when you're managing me."
Sherlock rubs at his eyebrow, looking away.
, chest tight. To Natalie he says, "I'll be right out"; to Sherlock,
John says, "Yes."

"Why would it be different, John?" George asks; and John rubs at his face. Sitting up. He rubs at his knees.
: Part—what're we on? 47 I guess—47 will be a little bit late; my apologies. It’s about 80% done and has been so for a week—I’ve been ill, and I’m still really exhausted. It’s not out of the question it’d go up tomorrow, but Tuesday seems more likely.
John swallows. Pushes himself up to his feet, turns, and—and—
"Well," Holmes says, but it's slipping: he sounds—cautious, almost hesitant, when he says, "Fellatio in the chemistry labs is certainly frowned upon."
. Over and over and over—not twenty years, John is thinking. Longer, John'd guess. Since he was—a boy. Christ. The hot, helpless rage in John's throat.
"I didn't mean it like that."
. I'd rather not have a serial bomber, even an incompetent one, running about London, if it's all the same. But Donnell didn't think it merited outside help until—"
as Sherlock gasps, "don't stop, s-seven—"; and John feels a sudden-hot surge of fury and then shame but then Sherlock's foot comes down onto his shoulder arching-eeling as gravel-crunch "I want," Sherlock tells him, "your mouth on my cock."
"E-eight," Sherlock manages, rough, "don't stop"; and so unlocked and flooding John rubs up the back of Sherlock's lean thighs and Sherlock just—goes, knees to chest folding like fabric soft all over for John to bend down and give him a kiss.
"All right?" John asks, and then gasps,
It takes him a moment, but he finally manages, "Smoking behind the bike sheds?"
: knives laid flat down the wings of his ribs; but in '93 his mum'd finally—and then his dad—and what a spectacular cock John'd been, Christ, the last thing he wants to think about is 1993. While two hours away Sherlock'd been—slouching into his blazer with his—no. No. Not—it'd been—summer, hadn't it. J-June. Home in Oxford, for the summer hols, no uniform, no school—so what, then? What'd Sherlock been, in 1993? An hour and a half away John'd been—drunk, probably, unbuttoning a dirty-blonde dirty punk rock guitarist from her dirty tartan flannel shirt while Sherlock—Christ.
—" and smashes his fist into the wall pressing up and then stops as John stops, unsteady: panting, panting—
It's a very peculiar question. Or—not the question, because it isn't a question, but the odd serious tone in which the statement is delivered; the unfamiliar expression on Sherlock's very familiar face. Together they make John feel peculiar, like the suggestion makes him feel peculiar. Off-beat.
—and Sherlock digs his fingertips into his hair.
Sherlock touches him gently—so gently!: but of course it'd be absurd to expect him to be anything but. John's cock hardens in Sherlock's long tender fingers and Sherlock's breath rises and falls with John's quickening, tightening breath and John keeps his hands off Sherlock's neck and his shoulders and his mouth and his prick but when Sherlock slithers closer to him John's hand slides to his back, wide-open-splaying, and Sherlock lets him; so helpless John pets at Sherlock's back and gasps for heavy, panting breaths as he fucks Sherlock's fist and long fingers and when Sherlock reaches across him for the drawer and John's lube and John's dildo John lets him, crooks his thigh up so that Sherlock can pet him open, ride it into him: a heavythick unrealhot weight pushing him open, making him—remaking him—: making him new as Vic'd made him new, as Rebecca'd made him new, like their friends in Ron's living room had made him new, like Miz Bee Hiven, like Cal, like Janeka, like that surreal strange sequence of days in December with Sherlock back home at last running fabric dissolution trials in an assortment of acids in in the kitchen of 221B while John spent the evening with Paul feeling his heart start to wake up again, making him new all over again, making him and remaking him, all making him new: their eyes on John's face and their hands on John's body, all these other people that'd torn him down tugged him open eased him apart to make him this person who would open his body to let Sherlock into him; his heart to let Sherlock into him; the whole of him letting Sherlock into him as he lets is letting will let Sherlock into him; to let Sherlock have him as Sherlock has had him and will have him and is having him him; to let Sherlock flinch from him over and over and still follow—, and follow—, and follow after; to—to sodding
"Still thinking that I can't keep it going," John says, rough, "for longer than six and a half minutes?"

—and sharp, "just for me," as John gulps down shuddering breaths, nodding and nodding, as Sherlock rubs his barely-damp fingertips against him, little misdirected earthquakes rippling through John's hot skin. "In my hands", nearly snarled: sparks, "You'll stay here, for me to," and John tinder; clawing at Sherlock's hair and his sticky back and his flexing-firm arse as Sherlock rolls his prick through the sweat-slick groove of John's hip and his thigh,  "to make—make you come all over me, yeah?" John nodding arms tight around him; while mouth moving John's mouth Sherlock shapes words, barely heard: "You'll stay," and John's whole body vibrating— "with me—" like his throat 'round a moan— "and come apart," Sherlock whispering, "while you kiss me"; and John gasps, "Yes."
"A good hard rogering with that little toy of yours," Sherlock adds, and pops a bite of chicken into his mouth.
"Yeah," John says. His voice wobbles. "Sherlock," he says, rubbed thin; "Yeah," Sherlock murmurs. His touch: cool, slick; John's burning ash-crumbling skin. John breathes. Breathes in. "All right?" Sherlock asks, circle-slow soft petting and John's breath gusts out and John says, "You can. Go in," so Sherlock is pressing slow-slow-slow-slow-in.
"Yeah." Breathed out. "I like it." Warm and ticklish on his skin: John shivers, warm all over hot and ashamed and Sherlock rubs his parted lips so gentle against the seam of John's ear and "Oh," John gasps, "
When he gets back into the flat Sherlock is waiting for him at the table. Fully dressed. Sitting upright in a chair with his shoes on, even, next to a bottle of lube and two of his bizarre modern-art sex toys, his mouth smooth and unreadable and pale. John considers, briefly, whether or not to smile.
Mycroft notches his elbows, folding his hands together in front of his face. "I had some time," he says, "while I was waiting."
"Thanks."
"And when I have to stop," Sherlock says, into the space between them.
"You've had a shower," Sherlock observes.
it, has never been able to bear these seas between them and before he means to decide it he is standing before Sherlock's chair with Sherlock looking up at him, taking a long slow breath in and in and in and then—
"It's." Sherlock swallows: up-down, up-down; John has a sudden brief, electric fantasy of putting his hands on that flushing throat. "Like kissing, almost."
"I'd let you fuck me mercilessly across the duvet," Sherlock says, quiet; but John finds he's been half expecting it. His hands don't stop.
, Christ. He's not fifteen, is he?
Tight with bravado Sherlock says, "Tell him we're fucking off to Scotland to shag for four days, you mean"; and John says, "Yeah."
John's eyes. His throat. He fumbles blind for the towel rail to get the suspender belt on back to front. He turns it around, then sits on the lid of the toilet to roll on his stockings. It takes him eight tries to work out how to use the clips. The tops of the stockings tug at his leg hair. When he stands up to look at himself in the mirror he can't even see all the way down to his knees. A middle-aged soldier kitted out in black lace: it's hard to imagine much in which John feels less at home, but for Sherlock he'd give an awful lot of things a try:
of all things while naked in his arms Sherlock is nuzzling, slow and sweet, against John's hot face: absurd. "Sherlock," John whispers, "I want to make you happy, will you—"
John lifts up his head. Would—protest, maybe, or—but Sherlock's already got his mouth on him, lipping at him lightly, mouth loose and gentle as he cradles John's balls in his palm. John inhales, then laughs, a little, blinking up at the ceiling, then reaches down to pet at Sherlock's soft hair. Tugs, a little.
"He's having a bit of a time," he tells her, "and I'm part of the problem, that's all." He rubs at his face. "Honestly it'd be the best thing in the world if he could have a sodding
me," John croaks. "I feel—so alone with him, like I can't—I can't properly
Standing just beside him, Sherlock says, "It wasn't like you're thinking, with Jacob," very quietly. "He didn't—"
"I need an address for Lucy Matley," John says. Thinking:
"I—no." John swallows. "I didn't mean it."
Sherlock ducks his head.
"I love it," Sherlock says, too fast, and John touches his cheek: hot.
Turning his mouth up towards Sherlock's, John asks, "Will you tell me how?"
," Sherlock whispers hot-close. "Reckon you thought about it in your chair, too." Bites at his earlobe, while John arches up onto his toes. "While I was off in Manchester, and you were fucking yourself for everyone in London to watch?"
He's still hunched over John's computer. John watches as he rubs his thumb over his mouth, then brushes across the trackpad, clicking once—twice—again—
"Mental health things," John says. Just.
, John thinks, somewhere in between eating the peppers Sherlock had picked off his half and Sherlock getting a text from an old friend of a friend of an acquaintance about something off at the Royal Opera, can't talk now, giant tree crisis, and could Sherlock pop by in the morning? But the idea really slips John's mind again until he finds himself eyes closed on his side petting his thumb up and down, up and down, up and down the smooth papery sole of Sherlock's bony right foot, tucked up near John's chest while Sherlock, who is propped up on his elbows and the mass of his disordered duvet with his laptop, is reading aloud selected highlights from some report or other Greg has sent him from the some sort of National Crime and Something Statistics or Whatnot Investigation Centre, intended—John gathers—as a special sort of a weekend treat.
It is nothing new, John is thinking, under this sun or any other; but he'd never say it. It wouldn't help. Sherlock has always been precisely that kind of self-involved: charmingly convinced of his own uniqueness; exasperatingly egotistical about the specialness of everything he thinks; and
"Where to next?" John asks.
," says Sherlock, voice low and rough; and John pulls his hand back. Sliding back between Sherlock's soft belly and taut thighs while he thumbs at a nipple, soft and relentless and over and over and over until Sherlock says, "
, with sparks rolling up John's skin as Sherlock presses him onto his back arms braced John drags his other leg—
Above him, the ceiling is sparking back into view. He tucks his chin down towards his chest. Can barely breathe, still. Sherlock is still perched on the coffee table, red-faced, shoulders hunched. His cock is tenting out his bottoms: John could get down on his knees and bury his face in him, his wiry long thighs and hard prick and soft balls, the animal smell of him coming up over soap while John rubbed his cheek against the softest warmest spaces of his skin, velvety and hypnotic; kiss him and lick him and suck at each fragrant millimeter of his skin, until Sherlock said—
. At least this way it won't wake him up.
John sighs. He doesn't know. He wants—he says, "I want to talk to someone who likes their job, I think."
, to Harry's latest reply.
kitchen floor—
Sherlock laughs: there's that, at least. Shoulders hunching up.
John groans, shuddering hard all over as Sherlock gasps, "John—John—" and lets go of John's hand to fumble with John's fingers and the buckle and John shivers and whines with inside him all of Sherlock's right hand inside him all the way inside him as the strap slips open and blood surges into John's face and he wants—needs—wants—Sherlock's little high desperate noises in the back of his throat as his hand shifts—turns, barely, and— "John, can I—can I—"
They kiss. John touches: his sticky warm skin.
; but it doesn't do anything to make John forget who Sherlock is. Every teacher who'd ever summoned John in for a lecture was a tired, middle-aged, middling academic, usually with jowls and disorderly hair; Sherlock has the hair, at least, but his version takes a hair dryer, two different kinds of smoothing serum, and a brand of mousse that comes in a bottle that looks like it was designed for outer space. John goes to him with his throat tight and his palms prickling; but even in spectacles, Sherlock is very far from an authority figure. Even in spectacles, he's still just a git with an exaggerated opinion of himself, isn't he.
"You like it?" John asks. Rubbing, a little harder.
Sherlock is silent, head bent, not looking at him. Embarrassed John turns: he'd said he'd wash his back, didn't he, but—; the loofah, then, if—; so John grabs it, not knowing what else to do.
, John is thinking, as he nods at PC Hwang on the cordon;
"You want me to touch you more?" John asks, and Sherlock gasps, "Yes—y-yes—" and John slides his left hand under the water and around Sherlock's hard cock, gives him four—five—seven long-shivery pulls while Sherlock moans into his mouth and licks at his teeth and presses his shaking hand against John's hot cheek while John whispers, "You want me to pull you open, to—to pull you apart? You want me to pull it out of you?" as broken Sherlock says "Yes—yes—
Sherlock's lips are parted, looking down at John, propped up on an elbow and petting him. Nowhere to go. Like lying in the grass somewhere quiet and sweet-smelling, drowning in the full blaze of the golden melting July sun.
He swallows. His wrists, probably. If John had thought about it, he'd've thought about his wrists but he—didn't, did he—? except that now the fantasy leaps out of some half-stashed lid-askew box at the base of his ribcage, rolling out forward and back, somehow, through time.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mr. Watson." Holmes is moving behind him: under the carpet, the floor creaks. "I'm impressed," he says, and trails the tip of the cane up over John's right buttock; boiling, vaporized: John is gasping, blinking sweat out of his eyes. "I think," Holmes says, caressingly, "that you ought to tell me all about what you and your friend on the fencing squad have been up to."
"And you—got involved with him," John says. It is, he finds, queerly difficult to describe it as anything else.
John tells him, "Come over here and see," to which Sherlock snorts, spraying—gulping—then releases John's foot elbow knocking over his cup as he shoves his serviette to his mouth and nose and streaming-squinting eyes, emitting a breathless-pained noise as John jerks up half to standing to lean over and mop at the tea spilt all over the table. Snorted all over the edge of Sherlock's plate.
. "It—it shifts, I think," Sherlock says, then lets out a frustrated sigh. "I just, I can't—"
"Don't you mean, 'the safety and effectiveness of your brother'?"
John kisses his scapula, soft. "Yeah, but if there's one thing I feel relatively confident insisting you're
"It's all right," Sherlock says quickly, and pushes up onto his knees. "It's all right," repeated as John palms him, helpless, then drops his hands; touches Sherlock's knee and ankle as Sherlock turns, pushes his feet clumsily up the carpet past John's shoulders, John scooting up awkwardly onto his elbow, rubbing up the long flushing side of Sherlock's thigh. John bends in to kiss his hip; and Sherlock pushes at him, twisting John's body open at the waist. The long arch of his body as he bends his head—and wethot John inhales, inhales; rubs at his sides; pets at the furry skin beneath the jut of his cock and then wraps one arm around Sherlock's legs and pulls him into his mouth. Sherlock moans: wet and open barely around him. Christ. John tries to hold his hips still but can't, cock shoving across Sherlock's tongue. Sherlock whines, pants, laps at him clumsily; and burning, burning John pulls him deeper. Swallows around him. Sherlock gasps, shoving in; squirms, getting his mouth half-closed dragging his tongue—
Eyes squeezed tight shut. Hand tight on John's skull. John on his knees between his thighs with his fingers up him watching Sherlock's chest slow, slowly, fade: and unflatteringly. John all over hot and tender, overwhelmed. Fingers in him. Full up with him. Cells from his body in John's body: Christ. John feels like he's about to cry.
"So you referred her to us?" she demands. "Because you thought we'd have an easier time scheduling a chinless racist who thinks John's lower class?"
, over and over and echoing over again, helpless:
what I did with my genitals, which—frankly, I don't much want to do
"Hardly running," John says. "Is it."
He nods. Mute. He leans forward to refill her glass, empties the bottle.
," he bursts out. "Fuck, I'm sorry, John, I—" and so John folds a hand over him and Sherlock stops. John pets, gentle. Cupping him close. His thumb resting light low-down on the base of Sherlock's hard, hot cock. His testicles soft and fragile in John's palm.
Shivering John scrubs a hand across the sweat on his own face. Pulling up: hands sliding on John's hips Sherlock makes a tight, heartbroken sound. John bends back to kiss him, quick; then stretching he fumbles for the bottle, can't—drips a splash down onto Sherlock's cheek as Sherlock flinches and John half-sobbing laughing smears his knuckles through it whispering, "Christ you're lovely," as Sherlock gasping crams himself hard into John's rubbed-raw throbbing arsehole: "
"Thanks." He rattles the door open: a rush of cold air to replace the fleeing steam; John shivers and grabs Sherlock's towel. "I'm just." Inhaling, steady.
"Worth it," Sherlock murmurs, leaning up, "I think—"
"What would you do, really?" he asks. "If you didn't teach?"
John swallows. Nods, and so Sherlock's lashes smudge down against his cheeks, as he fits his soft mouth back around John's cock.
Some time passes. Sherlock is so very warm. His long bare body soft and hard together, pressed against John in his bed.
"The way you taste," John manages, and Sherlock pulls him back into his mouth. Warm and wet, John's reckless blood; "Smeared," he manages, "all over my tongue."
"Does seem a bit of a waste of time," John agrees.
"Please," John whispers, rubbing his elbow over his face. "Please."
John sighs, sitting forward. "It's not like that, it's not—a power play, is it. He's just—he's just a bit of a mess, isn't he? And he—this dynamic, where he knows things and I don't, it's not—for ages, for years I thought it was about power, and about him, controlling me, but if the past five weeks have shown me anything it's that he's—he feels desperately vulnerable,
Just inside John's bedroom door, Sherlock hovers beside his overnight bag, looking torn.
. He looks up at the wide-open windows full of light bright blue air at just past ten in the morning of a Sunday and then downstairs is pocketing his notebook trotting down the street with his mobile at his ear while it rings, and rings, and rings.
John inhales, slouching, but he doesn't take his feet back. A flaw, he thinks, in his plan of attack. He finds himself watching Sherlock eat the better part of a slice of French toast before he finally remembers his own: Sherlock's hands on him, predictable. John's never been anything but hopeless, when it comes to him. He takes a bite. Bangs his knife down on the plate to get his tea and the blade tips and the handle slides off the edge: clumsy. Crumbs all over the table, most like.
"Sorry," John says, thick. There is a sticky, prickling itch working its way down the back of his spine: too warm, really, inside. "I don't mean to—"
. And then, while John was still rubbing a hand over the back of his skull not thinking not thinking not thinking George'd said,
—and he stops, heart hammering, halfway to hyperventilating, at the softest suddenest swiftest brush of Sherlock's mouth on his mouth.
"I'm just going to..." John waves a hand, and Sherlock waves the spoon, so John goes upstairs and showers.
And kissing. His mouth. His tongue. God, John feels—liquid. Drugged. "Yeah." He swallows.
"When you're out on a case without me, I worry," John says. "That's—not going to change, I don't think, but what—what made this
"What then?" John asks, quiet, and Sherlock tightens his arms around him.
; and goes to toss their neglected tea—at least Sherlock'd drunk most of his, at some point—and warm up the second half of last night's mediocre leftover stir-fry.
," wavering: his cock slid tight along the fucked-soft-wet-licked crease of John's arse. John breathes in and out hammering hard. Sherlock's never been so close. John can
"No," John says, "that's not—
John laughs, awkward. "Not really necessary," he says, finally. "You can just. Ask." Sherlock lifts his chin, watching him; and John says, "But we—we can if you want to."
Breathes.
"I want you to get me kitted out like a professional tart and then fuck me through the leghole of my knickers," Sherlock tells him, gravelly and thick; and then flattens his hand across his hot, red face.
"Ah, yes, 'the prime opportunity to dirty up your pretty face,' now I remember," says John, stepping back.
"You can't be serious," John says.
Against his chest, Sherlock is silent. John can feel his shoulders tensing; his neck, under John's hand.
Light as air, when Sherlock says, "Why would I go?"
John swallows: floods. "False pretenses," he says, "not very nice"; while Sherlock is, not-at-all-subtly, pushing at the back of his head. "So I'm a bit of a fuck, then, am I?" John wriggles his weight onto his elbow so that he can push the bra just a bit up, so that most of Sherlock's dusky pink hard-peaked nipple pops free:
. John kisses his hair, and Sherlock shoulders up against him, closer, settling in: his back warm-wet against John's chest. John pets his wet hair, his damp cheek. Sherlock's eyes are closed, face pink from the heat. Between John's bent-up legs Sherlock's bent-up legs loosen. Rest open.
That moment aside.
"Do you really want to fling me into the shower and hose me off?" Sherlock asks.
"Well, then," John is nearly through with saying, but Sherlock is already pushing up to his feet dragging John up by his vest to give him a hot, hungry kiss half bent back over their plates while John gropes his arse through his pajama bottoms and thinks about Sherlock shoving him down over the table, across his chair. Sherlock fucking him up against their black windows, nothing outside.
"No, I—" Sherlock says; so John kisses him. Strokes at his hair, his cheeks, and whispers, "It's fine."
"Do you want do it?" John asks.
but he'd still let John lie to him about his pajamas. Pick at that unhappy uncertain yearning. Unspool it, knit something new. Against Sherlock's thigh Sherlock has wound their hands together, interlaced their fingers; gripping John's right hand as tight with his left as the right is clutching his untouched wine: lovely, John is thinking, blood warm, and sweet. As relentless and impossible as the sea. All his lovely long fingers odd chins sea-sky eyes and all the long uneasy rest of him, sitting just beside John around other people, hand in his hand.
," gasped breathless shivering as Sherlock rolls his weight—up, up over-against him, arm trapped hand tucked—tucked under him, scraping blunt nails over John's electrified belly, with half his other hand tucked into John's arse and his knee sliding in between John's sweat-soaked thighs. Sherlock nuzzles the back of his ear. "God," John's broken throat sopping-wet whole body rippling with Sherlock's—weight—
like he is: that unhappiness is radiating off him, is part of what John is touching, with Sherlock in his arms. Sherlock is curved in towards John's body in John's bed like—like an uncertain plant-ish tendril, at the very coldest harshest starting edge of spring: in the quiet John rubs their knees together in their stockings and pets at Sherlock's ribs, at his satiny shoulders, at the cut of his collarbones and the taut-strung lines of his throat; as millimeter by millimeter Sherlock slow shifts his whole body closer, uncurling towards him: like the unwinding whorls of a tender green growing little fern.
By Thursday, John is thinking about it.
John comes up to take his wrist. "Someone was taking the piss, I take it? Not Greg," he adds, touching the skin at the edges of the bruising. Warm. "Greg nearly has a coronary every time you get into it with a suspect, he'd never—"
Instant. Drowning: black-heavy surge surf-crashing dragging-down as, confessed, John thick-slick swallows stabbed doesn't gasp—his face malformed battered-pulpy soft thick mass of his nose and his mouth opening for air while his badly-dammed flood of anxiety roils over him head to toe, leaving him panicky and shivering, clutching Sherlock to his chest.
"I haven't done that in twenty years at least, I don't think," says Sherlock, mopping at his face again, watermelon pink.
need to see what they took out of that gallery, so let's—just do all of that, and then after they've found the bomb and spent a congratulatory five minutes slapping each other on the arse, we can go back to the flat and you can shout at me for running about covering your idiot arse with a gun in between telling you you're good-looking and clever, and then I can give you the throttling you so richly deserve. All right?"
, John'd thought,
"And we're finished here, are we."
: the tops of his thighs slick with—with what Sherlock does to him and thick John asks, "Can I—can I kiss you, Sherlock, I want to—" dizzily petting fingers trapped between scratchy lace and hot skin while Sherlock's wet fingers slip into the wet hot wanting space inside him and then
"So," George says, and then jabs his fork into his salad.
while panting Sherlock rolls shivering-up into him again.
"Thirty," John says.
"Yeah." She's smiling. "Exactly."
. It'd taken 'til June before John'd been properly sure that tomorrow he'd come in again, because by then he knew he couldn't do that to her; but John'd not been in the surgery ten minutes before Rhoda'd shoved a four-year-old with an earache at him and told him that there were more tongue depressors under the sink. After eighteen months their old surgery—which hadn't been so much three rooms as two rooms and one rather spacious walk-in, no window—had been condemned due to decades-old water damage; so then John'd helped Rhoda pack up shop and somehow found the wherewithal to go to work with Cal and Jeremy while she hunted down a new spot—and in the end it'd turned out that Sherlock—that Sherlock all that long while—while
, John thinks.
Sherlock's still flapping his arms about, like some sort of great underfed stork, incongruously arrayed in bespoke suit trousers and hand-knitted green wool. John never wears his own jumper, but Harry'd improved quite a bit, by the time she was reduced to knitting for Sherlock.
demanding," John says. Protesting: not quite quiet, inside. "You're—in a lot of ways you're pushy, about other things, and you're—" He swallows. Throat tight. "You're often tactless," he concedes, "and very frequently difficult, but—but getting you to actually
"John."
"All right?" John asks, quiet.
Sherlock swallows. Says, "Yes."
"Granted," Sherlock says, gruff, "not how quite how I'd anticipated spending the rest of my Sunday."
Sherlock nods, and John laughs. "What?" Sherlock asks, chins crumpling offendedly, but John shakes his head.
"No," Sherlock says, then squeezes harder, holds him fast. "
Sherlock nods. His skin on John's skin: John shivers. Presses closer: there shouldn't still be room. "I like it," Sherlock whispers.
John pushes at the pillowing duvet, stretching, and Sherlock makes a small, disgruntled noise and pulls him back.
-saying is deafening. He can tell John to fuck him dry six days a week but Sherlock wants—Sherlock is always wanting—softer and sweeter and
"So you—what." John drags his gaze back up to Sherlock's flushed face. "Do you... touch one hand with the other? or—"
," ground out, "I know I—"; and Sherlock hits him again. "You—I think," John gasps, "you—desperate,  can barely—the top on the lube sticks, so—" and Sherlock's hand comes down on John's arse so hard it ripples down his thighs through his belly into his tight-heavy balls— "rubbing back against you," thick, "until you're so desperate—I.
, I—"
, and I—he's dreadful at saying no to me, he does—just what I want, so it'd be—it'd be worse than—so how can ask him to—to step past that, just because I want—I want him to—"
: John squirms: Sherlock's flat hand blooms golden-black down through the meat of his cheek and he moans. Moans. "You're ruining my trousers," Sherlock murmurs, still half-pressed up tight, cock hard against him. "Which do you think'd be easier to tidy up, after, them or the floor?" When Sherlock inches back and John grabs onto his arse holds him tight; Sherlock huffs. Thumbs over John's burning swollen face and murmurs, "Can't wait to get your mouth on me, can you?"
"Are you all right?" Sherlock asks, very quietly.
"Yeah," John says, and then clears his throat. "Yeah, I know."
"God," John gasps, then laughs. "Well." Sherlock shivers, pushes back, but John can't, he just—just kisses Sherlock's shoulder, heart roiling in his chest, easing up. "Not quite the master plan, but," kneeling back. "Are you all right?" He rubs at the sweaty small of Sherlock's back, petting down, careful circles, light.
John exhales, tucking his face down against Sherlock's neck, breathing deep, and Sherlock inhales sharply, stretching underneath him. John turns to kiss him again, elbow braced by Sherlock's head and Sherlock's long arms wrapping hesitantly around his back. Sherlock is moaning before John even realizes he's grinding down: "Sorry, sorry," John gasps, but Sherlock shakes his head over and over, gasping, "No, no—" pressing up— "
Sherlock had asked.
"I'm afraid of hurting him," he says, finally. "I'm—
him, John
, he thinks; he thinks,
Breathing. Sherlock is silent. Watching. He can risk it again, he thinks; so John wraps his hand around his cock thick and heavy between his spread trapped thighs; strokes himself, light-light-light, watching Sherlock watch him, sitting upright and flushed in John's soft chair.
"Carefully," Sherlock says, finally.
He trails off.
John twisting back to kiss him desperate
Sherlock chews, and watches him. John rubs at his cheeks.
John clears his throat. "Not enough in volume, I suppose."
"Yeah," Sherlock says, finally: in a low, half-unrecognizable voice, not meeting John's eyes.
John's mouth is dry. "Mycroft?" The only logical conclusion. Sticky, is Sherlock, at his nape. John's palm curves around his shoulder, home.
. So deep, Sherlock rubbing his knuckles into John's belly while John pants— squirms, knotted—and then
"No?" she asks. "I see." That familiar half-quirk at the corner of her mouth, coming back.
"I want to do it to you," John says. "What you like."
"Oh, so she's got terrible taste as well as being—"
"Christ, that's a strange idea," he says, finally; and Sherlock crumples forward so sharply that—that it takes John a moment, really, to realize he's laughing.
; and John, considering Sherlock's erection and the four and a half millimeters remaining of bathwater and the porcelain and the relative decrepitude of his knees, pulls back just enough, twisting, to fumble around in the things on the edge of the basin.
"You've got it," Sherlock says, a little too fast. Catching John's chin. "You've done an excellent—," he says, holding him, and John closes his eyes. A sharp, red-brown feeling like being caught—
"Oh, don't know," Sherlock breathless says. Swallows. Head back rubbing-wrist soft hair as he says, "Could always—do my tax, or—"
Swallowing. The air through the open window just above them barbed with a cooling damp bite and Sherlock warm and heavy in sleep against him and John swallows, and swallows; but the serrated ache in his throat doesn't go away. Not even after he turns his face just enough to rub the duvet against his damp, hot cheek.
"All right?" Sherlock asks. Gentle. Soft.
(—and John ice-cracking all over, opening up—)
John takes a breath. Another: it's so close in here, he can't— "Listen," he says, finally. "If he turns up at your crime scene, will you text me?"
, John wants: he wants he wants he wants. His heart, thundering: when did that happen? fingers-tongue warm breath on his shoulder, Sherlock's, Sherlock's breath. John's lube:
"Like this?" John asks, and touches him: only just. Petting: his wet fingers and the taut-shivery soft skin of Sherlock's arsehole. Sherlock closes his eyes and John rubs-soft against him. "All right?" he asks. Feeling the long tensed line of Sherlock's body as John kisses the edges of his sweat-damp pink-flushed hot face.
," John says grateful. Hands loosening. "Still ongoing, I'm afraid, so I can't say much," he says: "Sherlock's—away, at the moment, working on—"
"I like your plans."
John tightens his hand twisted back into Sherlock's thick hair. Sherlock is breathing in huge, ragged gulps.
"Thirty-s—um," John says, and then shifts. "Sorry, no—he's thirty-nine, I always—I know he's thirty-nine." He rubs at his face. "You don't have to tell me he's an adult. I know that."
Sherlock is smiling. "No."
A window opening on a hot day; John's cock drips onto the pillow as he gasps and gasps for the rushing-in air. So much for the towels, John can think; and he swallows. It's—inexplicable, how different it feels, except that then Sherlock is nudging John's thighs apart again and John feels that too, every millimeter: his muscles relaxing and contracting in countless little bursts while Sherlock shifts him around to make a barely-there gap between his thighs. "Can I," Sherlock murmurs, "a bit," and John swallows and swallows until he can say, "Yeah," and Sherlock lets out a hot gust of breath on his cheek and lets go of John's balls and then pulls back enough to get the bottle, to slick up John's skin. John slides his right hand under his own genitals. Lifts them up, as Sherlock'd done, so he won't lose his fucking mind; Sherlock is sliding his cock into the slick-wet space of his thighs and so John tightens up for him and it pulls at the muscles in his throat. It's completely bizarre. He doesn't know how any part of him will react. He's full up with a thick unrealistic sex toy that shudders and jolts in him heavy and good while Sherlock fucks his thighs and every inch of erectile tissue on his body is tight and full and aching. Sherlock screws himself in against him, making delicious little noises while he kisses the back ridge of John's shoulder and his ear and his throat and John rubs Sherlock's left hand over his own navel and up to his ribs and then jerks forward when Sherlock's fingertips brush over his nipple and
Under the table, he touches Sherlock's thigh through his coat. His knobby knee. Then he turns his mouth close to Sherlock's ear and murmurs, "I'm glad you turned up."
"I would, you know," John says, very quietly, "if you really want"; and breathing out against him, Sherlock nods.
"Do you still feel silly?" Sherlock asks. Hushed. Just for them.
After a moment, Sherlock shrugs one shoulder, then the other. "I consulted with an assistant of hers, for a time," he says: careful, light. "During the trials." He turns away again, bending to poke through the mess of objects on the coffee table as he says, "Quite useful with pairing faces and aliases, her office," and then straightening, and taking an audible breath. "Better fetch your gun," he says, finally, and then stuffs his hands in his pockets.
"Not good?" Sherlock asks, and John laughs.
"What?" Sherlock says, and then, after a moment, pushes up to sitting. "
"What?" John barks out a laugh. "You stuffing me full of cock? Because that can't possibly be news, I mean—"
," Sherlock's fair-round bare shoulder, "too." Sherlock shivers under his fingers. "Good?" John asks. "Or."
—" so John gives him a pinch and Sherlock moans, hips jerking up.
A curious sensation. John can feel him, of course; hard to miss, a cock up your arse. But he doesn't feel—wanting or not wanting, quite. Turned off or turned on. Sherlock is staring up at him like—water, or oxygen: an inarguable inescapable needed thing, with his huge green-yellow purple-smeared eyes. That aching-dragged rubbed-raw feeling from earlier, just—before: it's not, John thinks, a million miles away.
it, Sherlock, I want to
"I like this," John says, "I like you like this"; and Sherlock laughs.
Sherlock pins him face-down to the sheets. Fucks him hard and merciless and keeps him pinned while John pants and squirms and arches underneath him pushing back up against around him counting aloud to ten—twenty—
"A little," he says, and then swallows, twice, convulsively. "Thank you," he says, very quietly. John's hand is out at his hip: hovering, helpless; and Sherlock swallows again—again—and then steps, very carefully, to meet it.
"I want you to finish rinsing off," John says, unsteady, "and then I want you to get into pajamas, and sleep for at least four hours, and I want you to sodding
For some time in silence. John stares out through the windscreen, into frothing apricot water, pink and silver light.
; fucks John straight through one orgasm and slowly—shiveringly—into another; and then while John is still sobbing through the aftershocks and dripping onto the cabinets Sherlock pulls John's shirt up, his vest: tugs them both up together over John's limp arms heavy head to bare the last barely-hidden sweat-soaked spaces of John's body and then wraps his arms back tight around John's waist: Sherlock's open shirt. His bared chest. Pressed tight to John's stripped spine with his cock still hard and thick in John's arse: the hot-sticking expanse of Sherlock's hot, familiar bare body.
"Here." Sherlock's too tall, really, for John to properly reach: "If we lie down, I can kiss you better," John says, and Sherlock nods. His hot face just brushing John's face. He drops John's hand, climbing back onto his belly on the bed: "You have to take off your pants, though," Sherlock says, as though John's not already got his thumbs hooked in under the elastic.
"You were unhappy," George says, and John nods. "Sherlock had left," George adds, "he had left you"; and John mutters, "Christ," and leans his head back, and closes his eyes. "You missed him," George persists; and "
"And people think
John glances at him, sprawled out and naked and shining, still hard, then away. "Do you not?" He bends down to tug them on—Christ, he's repulsive, he needs to take a twelve-hour shower and then probably burn these bottoms, after. "I'll make the breakfast if you want, but it seems unwise to—"
"I have faith in our ability to improvise," John tells him, and Sherlock starts giggling, turning his two-thirds massaged right hand up to drag John back in on top of him, slow but relentlessly. John's knee would bang down between Sherlock's but Sherlock's hands are all over him, under him, soft for an instant between hard bone and porcelain and then settling him down flush against him, easy and possessive: legs interlacing with John's legs as Sherlock kisses him, paws at John's head and his back and his arse: "Just—," John is saying, all the while; "just let me—," petting Sherlock's soft-furred wet thighs and laughing into-against Sherlock's warm wet mouth as Sherlock leans up to give him kiss, after kiss, after kiss.
: John almost wants, painfully, to laugh.
John puts his hands on Sherlock's shoulders. "Sherlock."
All right. All right. Wet-sticky all over his arse and his balls. After lightning, he is thinking. Singed.
"Yeah." John pushes up. Settles his weight back onto his heels and unclenches his fingers: the buckle has left sharp purpling indentations in his palm. Sherlock is staring up at him. "What?"
"John, can you take Mr. Chalcroft at 9?" Natalie asks. "It leaves you double-booked but it should be routine, and Mrs. Akhtar rang up just a moment ago in a state—her daughter's asthma." Radhika Aktar doesn't do well with doctors but she's used to Rhoda, at least: it's the sensible solution, so John nods, and Natalie hands him two charts, which he takes into his office. He puts them down on his desk. His bag down on his chair.
"It's the most intimate thing," he forces out, "that he'll let me do."
"Convenient," John tells him; and Sherlock laughs. John rubs their noses together, dizzy. Skin all over champagne bubbles as they pop. "I like it when you laugh," John murmurs. Smiling. His body open-unfurling in Sherlock's hands.
, John is thinking, with a morning-clear oceanic ache,
Careful. "Should I stop?" John asks. Watching Sherlock's too-near dear face shift sideways, mouth tipping, sliding down.
"Eating," George suggests, and John laughs.
"Does it keep you up?" John asks, after a moment.
"Do," Sherlock asks, "do you want to."
; and togetherer. Face to face.
"It sounds like you've snuck me up to your bedroom," Sherlock says. "While your parents are away."
"St. Paul's," Sherlock says, "or the British Museum, possibly, doesn't matter, I need to go back to Baker Street"; and Greg just stares at him, mouth hanging open. "What?" Sherlock glares at him. "I do mean
"No," John says.
"Um." John laughs a little. "Fuck. That's." Laughing, again. Burning up.
"I want," Sherlock says, "you to take me," quiet, "right up to the edge"; and locking-settling all the parts of him unlocking, John lets out a long, slow breath:
Watching his face. "You could let go," Sherlock notes; so John sets the knife on the cutting board; and Sherlock darts in for a quick, half-illicit kiss.
"I'm a lot sweaty," he corrects, in that low-hot pantherish voice that he's more or less programmed John to respond to by getting hard, immediately. Why resist? John wriggles close. Their thighs don't quite slide together: tangled with sweat their leg hair pulls and sticks. Sherlock hums anyway, purry and hot, pressing against him, already starting to plump up. Suffocating; airless: John breathes deep. The stale musky animal smells of Sherlock's familiar warm body, stale breath old sweat dirty hair, glorious! Dizzy John touches his spine. 'Round the edges of his scalp John can taste bitter browned smoke and nicotine; the cigarettes Sherlock smokes but barely: at the back of John's throat it is red-and-bruised and pulling, held, caught. Aching-regretful John rubs at Sherlock's scalp. His long neck. Curling warm and pliable against him Sherlock is pressing his mouth against John's throat. Here, now. Forgiven, somehow. Buzzing John's skin, Sherlock murmurs, "At least let me clean my teeth."
Sherlock opens his eyes, finally. Blinks at him.
—I'm sorry, John, I'm sorry, I—" as dropping the bottle John shakes his head and shakes his head and bending down to kiss him open-mouthed and wet and wanting reaches down between them to smear too-cold lube against his arsehole down Sherlock's prick, satiny-hot and—
, probably, you've been—" his dizzying-thick posh bloody lube and—
Sherlock doesn't look back. He swallows, though: once, twice. Drying John's dry plate, over and over again. John holds himself still on the edge of the sink. He wants to take it out of his hands.
"Try," Sherlock says, and then, "Mr. Watson," and John's mind goes a stunning, staticky white.
"And then come back," John repeats. "And then. Before I fall asleep, I mean."
Rough, Sherlock says, "Not many people touch me."
"Thanks," Sherlock says, rough.
"She said—I called her Mrs. Holmes," John tells him: Sherlock shifting, "and she. Corrected me."
; as Sherlock's long thick fingers curl into him, deep into him, and "What's that, then?" Sherlock is asking, low and dangerous. "Two cocks up you in one night?"
sodding
John swallows. Kisses the corner of his mouth, as soft as he can; and Sherlock swallows. Loud. "As long," John says, quiet, "as you need": and Sherlock says, "Stay."
John swallows, and Sherlock sips his tea.
He scrubs at the plate, because eggs stick, don't they, but they don't because they are gone.
"For what it's worth," he says, when he can, "if anyone else had said that to me, anytime since 2013, I think I'd've beaten them through the floor, so—"
John groans. Comes, nearly sobbing, as Sherlock rubs—and rubs—
version of Sherlock: John had believed. He hadn't thought that he ever would again. Sherlock'd never had much difficulty turning John around before he'd left but, for all the parts of him that'd still been heartbreakingly, excruciatingly recognizable,
"Is this going to be what it's like for me, now," John asks, very quietly, "with you and the purple?"
"I'm sorry," John says, and Sherlock jerks his head:
John exhales slowly, and closes the book.

"I—your lube." Sherlock laughs, a little breathlessly. "Last night. Still on the coffee table, or." He bends down to give John a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss. "Or the carpet, I wasn't really paying attention, unless you—"
—it's a dreadful opera, really." He touches his mouth. "Though the sets looked rather... atmospheric, I suppose, which I suppose is about the best you can hope for, with

Sherlock rubs at his face, then says, "Can we—we ought to eat, to—"
"Want to dry off and take a look?" John asks him.

"Yeah," John says. "If you want."

"Green," John whispers, and wipes at his face. "I want you to." Hand on the back of the chair. Braced.
John curls his fingers on Sherlock's sternum.

"I'm—yeah, no, I'm counting," John says. Laughing, a very little; and George's eyes crinkle up at the corners.
. "I." John can't finish. Can barely breathe. Sherlock fucking him slow and relentless with his long slick fingers while he presses hot, open-mouthed kisses over John's stretched-too-tight skin. "S'mine, I picked it," John gasps, and Sherlock pushes into him deep and hard and he moans and moans and moans.
to me."
John shifts. Splays his hand across Sherlock's trapezius. Rubs over the top of his back.
expensive
"I know," he says, "I know you are," achy and low. He swallows. He asks, "Did you get any sleep this morning?"; and Sherlock, slumping, sighs.
For an instant John's vision blurs. Across the table. Priyanka and Denise and Rhoda are now all discussing, rather heatedly, Cate Blanchett; while Natalie is leaning over to ask Marianne about her trip to Oslo. Voices, faces, light and sounds: that strange sleight of mind where in a crowded room everything else fades and buzzes and smears together, when someone says your name. Last night when John'd got him finally on the phone Sherlock had said: John; whispered: John; moaned:
John chews and swallows. "Yeah," he says, reaching for his cup, "sounds it"; and Sherlock makes his constipated-owl exasperated face at him, across the tops of their tea.
"You're still wondering if I am, aren't you." Sherlock rests his cheek against his own hand, looking down at him.
John can feel the workings of him: the arch of his back carried underneath his flushed skin. Christ. "Next time I've got you like this," John murmurs, and Sherlock gasps and presses back. John's two fingers into him up to the second knuckle, working—working—; before Sherlock breathes deep and pulls back.
, Sherlock'd admitted,
"You don't have to come," John says. Chest heavy. "

John swallows. "You got close," he says, and then, carefully, "er—

"At my funeral," Sherlock says; and opens his eyes.

"I'd give good money for you to've said that to Rhoda," Sherlock murmurs, face tucked against his; John laughs raggedly.
, he thinks,
"You'd best watch your language," Sherlock says. Stern. Mute and helpless, John nods.
"I'm not going to tie you up," Sherlock clarifies; and then he says, "You locked your door"; and John—
"I'm not," Sherlock says, then stops. Quiet, he sighs. Lifts his head.
"Even though," Sherlock says, "you're not—," with the tip of his thumb pressing against the tender underside of John's bottom lip as his voice dips and rolls; and
Sherlock breathes. Breathes.
Sherlock doesn't say anything. His face: that odd, strange softness that his expression can—
"Not right now, if you don't want, I mean." John inhales, slings his arms around him, moving up onto his side as Sherlock settles carefully beside him and pulls the duvet up to their heads, palm sliding up John's goosebumped arm:
"I think," Sherlock murmurs, "you ought to tell me." John shudders, pressing back. "All these things," tongue thickwetwarm-cool, goosebumping up, "that you shouldn't think."
, John is thinking, beaten tender. To be peculiar. Strange.
," John gasping wrapping his arms around Sherlock's warm near-bare body as Sherlock is pulling him close hard-tight against him close skin-close too close not close enough. Face to face pressing boundary to boundary and can't hard-
Sherlock tips his face down, a very little. "Be still for me," he says, very softly, and John closes his eyes.
John shifts, restless. "Haven't got to your back half yet," he says, finally; and Sherlock looks back up at him. He hesitates, then rolls up onto his side.
"Mm." Sherlock swallows. Blinks twice. "All of them, I think," he says, finally, watching John's face.
Sherlock is still taking his turn up the sofa. Down. Up again, like that story about the bloke and the mantlepiece on
"You hate Cal," Sherlock says.
"Ah—her surgery hosts the incomparable Brian," Sherlock says, "two mornings a week."
"Morning," says John.
John nods. Forehead to forehead, tongue thick. His throat. "And I'd still want—every version of you," John whispers, pressing them together; Sherlock moans, "
"And I apologize," Sherlock says, very formally, "for what I said to you before that, too"; and John—
"He'd gone to Dover, I did check," Sherlock replies. "He'd got on the train, I had pictures, he was—"
Instead of private clients
He's got his thumb tucked against the rim of his lid, which is shining. Damp. A bead of tea just at the edge—
"It wasn't," Sherlock says, "
"How many," Sherlock asks, quiet; and John swallows. Sherlock's face, tilting down again: he kisses John's mouth, his jaw, and then looks at him properly and says, "How many times," very quietly, "do you think."
"Sherlock," John whispers. Mouth scraping Sherlock's mouth: Sherlock nods; John swallows. He can't say it. Wouldn't. Too cruel. Helpless John touches his hair, which he'd combed. His not-so-smooth cheek.
He stops, shoulders rising, suddenly awkward again; and. Realizing. Quietly John says, "Before you left, then."
John asks, "Any chance of you being able to—"
"So," John says. "What do we know so far?" and Sherlock straightens in his seat.
"You drank my mouthwash," Sherlock counters, "
Christ. John rubs a thumb across one peaked nipple and Sherlock's breath hitches, but he's still—he's still so
"Yeah," John sighs, knees falling wide. "Yeah, I—yeah." Watching Sherlock's intent face as Sherlock nods and says, "Get your feet up, then," and John snorts.
"I," John blink-blink-swallows, laughs— "I do, I love it, I—"
This is his bed right now. It smells of his body, their bodies. He can listen to the water run, eyes closed. Sherlock had known already: John tries, chest tightening, to put it out of mind.
His mobile buzzes. He stuffs a bite of sandwich in between his teeth and wipes his hands before digging it out:
; and right into his ear Sherlock had made a little hot longing sound that'd lit John up like sparklers all over, zinging all over him, searing into his skin; and then Sherlock had said his name. So. So John'd pitched his voice low and warm in a shade of Sherlock's big-cat bedroom and back-of-cabs voice and told him that he'd still got the knickers on, that he'd been petting himself through them, that he'd been practicing holding the back out of the way, and Sherlock'd sounded half-disbelieving, half-embarrassed, when he'd asked, uncertain,
, John thinks; and is silent.
In the dark staring up at the ceiling John scrubs a hand over his face. His laptop is tucked down on the bottom shelf of his bedside table, recharging for tomorrow. His mobile on the top, easy to reach. Past midnight in Amsterdam, as though Sherlock'd sleep: John huffs, half laughing, then reaches for his phone. Half embarrassed, thumbs out,
Sherlock swallows. "Yeah, it's fine," he says, and then brushes over John's mouth, jaw, chin. Drops his hand, leaning back.
"I want," Sherlock is whispering, "I want to, to stay like—like this in—inside you until we fall asleep." Clutching at John's arse barely-moving panting—his burning-hot face. John swallows: a heavy, hot tangled-up want.
. Again. Again.
He laughs. "I think we have one egg and half an onion," he says.
"I do," John says, very gently.
"Sorted," Sherlock agrees. "Who was it?"
and scrabbling at the door John moans, feet curling in his shoes. Sherlock drapes himself around him—
Sherlock doesn't say anything. Licks his lips. His cheeks are flushing, little reddening spots on his absurd, lovely cheekbones: John angles his hand, the red head of his prick just nudging out into air; and Sherlock crosses leg over knee in John's chair.
Sherlock is silent. Jerky, he nods.
"But the sex isn't enjoyable for you," George says. "Setting boundaries isn't rejection."
different, so that when George had asked John what John was finding annoying, after a long, pulled-tight untangling moment John had said, very quietly,
John swallows. "Let's have the other, then," he says: careful, steady; and watching him Sherlock does just what John asks.
John presses their mouths together. Breathes. Part; and breathe. The taste of his tongue and his toothpaste: God, three days without him, not even. John kisses him, breathing deep, taking in; and against him Sherlock squirms. Presses his hips to John's hips: John's body, in his chest opening-horror, responds. Sherlock rubs one sprawling hand across him belly arse and back, then slides it into John's pants. John puts his hand on Sherlock's big wrist. Heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat: the second, John's. Pulse pounding John kisses him, open-mouthed. Beneath-against him Sherlock is breathing hard already, panting deep; his tendons flex in John's grip, and throat tight John brushes a kiss to his cheek.
"What, just me?" John asks, raising his eyebrows, but he gets his shirt open. "You've already got your free show, haven't you? How long were you standing there? Watching me take what I wanted?"
"Did you know your feet were this sensitive?" John asks.
"Yes, best to head that off, I'd think," John says. Watching the bunching curve of Sherlock's hunched spine. "Especially if this is—about you, I mean": and Sherlock straightens, putting his shoulders back, and turns to face him.
, as beneath him Sherlock's jaw is grinding, clicking shuttight—
Sherlock's mouth tugs into one of his lovely awkward half-smiles. "I didn't say that," he says, and John grins and unfastens the top button of Sherlock's shirt.
"Never mind." Smiling: "Touch me"; opening his mouth on Sherlock's mouth as Sherlock tugs John over on top of him by his suspenders, kissing him down to his bones: the suspenders, Christ, another life. Sherlock's damp breath on him-into him: they kiss, and they kiss. "Do you like it," John asks, "when I touch you?"; and Sherlock, pulling John tighter against him, nods. Fingers sliding under John's suspender belt and then curling: a hardsharp burst in his belly, hot. Touching all over big hands, long and clever, pulling John down by his ribs and his shoulders and his arse: how can they get any closer? But they keep finding ways. They kiss and they kiss and they kiss.
"John," says Sherlock, thick.
, moaning long and low and taut, shivering all over, nothing left inside him that could possibly spill out. Pressed everywhere behind him Sherlock is panting, pushing his fingers into John's mouth; his big body pinning John's body down to the bed, and "Oh," John gasps, "
"Not faces, though," Sherlock says, muffled by his half-closed mouth. "I'd expect."
"You don't drool," Sherlock says, "much," and then kisses him: slow, delicate, almost painfully sweet.
John kisses his hair. His face. "So come upstairs with me."
"I missed you," John says, very quietly.
"Even without thinking it's pathological, yeah?" John says.
, because you haven't got the balls to admit—"
: oh. On John, it hadn't—but. But on Sherlock it's stunning. His mad eyes ringed and speckled, wild and verdant, impossibly green.
John touches his hot cheek. Aching.
John nods. He turns back to the sink. He rinses the last streak of soap off Sherlock's plate. Enough, he thinks. If he were just beginning to see what is—
—his mouth to—to John's forehead, and his temple, and his—his—
"Curtains open, I take it," John murmurs.
John's throat scrapes: painful. Battered. His hollow, cavernous mouth.
Okay, so, I’m temporarily pulling the “out of 59″ again--that 59 is... well it’s just wrong (definitely low), I know it’s wrong, I’ve known it’s wrong since, like, June, but I don’t know for sure what should replace it, and I feel really silly for continually having to change it. So I’m just going to leave it blank for the time being. It is safe to assume that as long as it is blank, there are ≥7 sections left, because the last few sections are much more clearly mapped out with much more obvious dividing lines than the remaining bits in between.
, much more cheerfully. Dave thus discarded, John found that somewhere in there they'd all agreed to share a table and three bottles of Malbec, side by side across from Brian and Michael as though Cal and John, too, were
"Yeah," John breathes. Sherlock pulls back bare inches. Skin so fair and flushed he glows: John's hands on his face and Christ, he's beautiful; cheekbones long lashes John's thumb. He's breathing hard, John notes. His shining eyes, red mouth. Still hard inside him:
"About me not liking your ex-boyfriend?" John asks, a little confused.
"But you're not," says Sherlock. Close. Low. Burst from John's too-tight chest too-high he laughs. "You're holding still," Sherlock murmurs, mouth brushing down, "for me."
"I think," he says, "that's probably why I don't read thrillers," and drinks the last of his wine.
"You're so red," Sherlock says, soft, and then bends down to kiss him.
Sherlock's voice is nearly sharp. Eyes sharp. The corners of his mouth pulling sharp. John shrugs. "Portsmouth to London... not a bad drive, this time of night." He tucks the knot of pasta into his mouth. He's never quite got the hang of it, with chopsticks.
He can smell them, everywhere. Nothing else. Sherlock's body stretched out with John's body. So naked with him, in his bed.
Heavy on his back Sherlock says, "You," digging his fingertips against the crease of John's armpit, "are a bad person."
—" as John bends to lick at his nipple fucking three fingers into Sherlock's wet body while between them Sherlock's cock drips and twitches and drips: "I'd want to do it so slowly, though," John whispers, kissing—up: his mouth meets Sherlock's mouth and Sherlock gasps into him—jerks— "Can I—I'd want to kiss you while I did it," John explains, "and fuck you—open so gently for my—"
," Sherlock repeats, sharp. "There's no place to hide it properly on the pods so it'll be in the lost-and-found, or still in the toilets, or someone's already found it and stolen it hoping it's—"
"Not that you're counting," George says, but it's gentle, good-humored. From Harry it'd be a knee to the balls: John takes a breath. Lets it out. George isn't Harry.
Sherlock swallows. Up-down, John thinks, aching, in concert with Sherlock's throat again moving: up-down.
"It's warm in here," Sherlock says, "isn't it."
or perhaps even
"All right," he says, quiet; and Sherlock opens his eyes.
"I think I either have to get in with you, or use your shower," John says at last, reluctant, when Sherlock is down to his socks and his pants. Sherlock looks up at him, unreadably: "I've got work," John explains, "I was running," quite awkwardly.
"Yeah." John nods. "I kept thinking, I would've—would've wanted him to roll me over and have a look, you know." He shakes his head a little. "Pants down and all."
Sherlock lifts his head. Rubs his lips—Christ. John breathing hard, chest heaving, while Sherlock kisses him at the tip and then—mouths—
Sherlock nods. Foreheads rubbing together.
irrelevant. Sherlock at school would've been impertinent. Sherlock at school would've been a terror: a rude, strange-looking boy with no social skills and a crushing, overactive mind. He really did reorganize the library alphabetically by the first letter of the text and then by height—or, at least, he told John he did, and John can believe it; can believe that Sherlock at fifteen spent half his time trying to blow up various school outbuildings and a fair percentage of it succeeding; can believe that Sherlock, at fifteen, was awkward and ungainly, sullen unless it suited him to be a smart-arse; out of uniform more or less constantly, because he's always loathed ties; undergrown, still; but still with his startling eyes.
Sherlock is still just staring at him, but at this he blinks, refocusing. His bared face. His soft green eyes. "You'd—think about it," he says, finally, "like that": it takes a moment, for John to realize it's a question.
," Sherlock says, voice breaking, so John says, "Tell me," and then slips his mouth back down to him skin and elastic feeling Sherlock's nipple swelling hard onto his wet wanting tongue, God, as Sherlock says, "I—I—," and when he stops again John stops sucking and Sherlock moans, and moans, and moans. After a moment, John opensup tonguepressing out touched justtohim and then
"I was going to do that," Sherlock says, unwinding his scarf and standing too close.
"Yeah," he says, quiet. "How do you want—"
He stops. Throat dry.
Sherlock stops. Barks a sliver of a laugh.

He stops.
"It doesn't—it doesn't feel like that, not—." A breath: easy. In, and then out. "I wasn't ever—focused, on them," John says, "not like—." He scrubs his hands over his face and then sighs. "It's much more about me for him, I think, than it ever was about them for me. And maybe that's just a self-serving delusion, but I—"
In John's arms Sherlock's body locking down seized tight while forehead to forehead John watches him in kaleidoscope pieces heart fluttering: Sherlock's body torn out of his body so close to his body as eyes blurring Sherlock blinks—and gasps—forced up pressedtight to John's braced-close empty body as he—
"Bold words," he says, very softly, and then pushes back from the table and walks through the kitchen.
John swallows, nodding. His tight thick throat. "But I can't—I can't do it

He remains interrupted, John thinks, for quite some time.

"No," Sherlock agrees, very quietly; and pets his long wet fingers up John's slick inner thighs, which shiver apart, utterly helpless.
"Hold onto that for me," John says, kneeling between Sherlock's spread pulled-up and curling stocking feet. Helpless. John bends and kisses the knot of his ankle, then peels down his black socks. His heart is pounding so hard his hands are shaking. He pets at the ball of Sherlock's twitching foot, rubs over his big toe: his nose prickles on the inside. He bends down to kiss the top of Sherlock's angular arches, with Sherlock  lying bright-red and panting with his knees pulled up and his cock hard between them but somehow John wants—John wants—
"I'm fine," Sherlock says. He sounds—normal, almost, John thinks; John can't tell. "You didn't hurt me," Sherlock says. "You didn't push."
say no, can I?" John asks. "It's just—with every part of him broadcasting how badly he doesn't want me to reject him—"
"Just an old exercise. An étude," he says, and then, flushing redder, "it clears my mind."
"You can play with my tits," Sherlock says; and something inside John—loosens. Cracks free.
Sherlock lets out a gust of breath. Shudders. Pulls John tighter against him, cock still nestled thickly into the crack of John's arse;
"Sherlock." John is gasping, panting, can't even not want— "
," John says, and stretches his hand between them, splaying across Sherlock's chest, "you're just about the least demanding person I've ever met." John takes a breath, watching embarrassment war with something vast and nameless in Sherlock's lovely queer face. "You aren't demanding," John says, quiet, "but I—I know you, sometimes, I think." He swallows. "So—I'm
Blink-blinking in the edges of their white light. John cups his right hand over the flushed side of Sherlock's long throat, his thumb resting just at the hinge of Sherlock's jaw.
"You—you can trust me," John says: inadequate, helpless; and too fast Sherlock whispers, "I do": and aching all over John shakes his head and asks, "Can I trust you?" and Sherlock flinches back like John's hit him.

John bends back down, kisses the tender little crease between Sherlock's buttock and thigh—and Sherlock jerks and gasps, "Stop, stop," and John closes his eyes.
The bottle is a heavy matte black plastic and 250mL and still has a sticker on the bottom:
"Mycroft's irritatingly good with dogs," Sherlock says, reluctant; and John says, "But surely you could rig up some way to electrify the doorknob, though, couldn't you?" and Sherlock laughs out loud.
"All right," Sherlock says, fast.
Sherlock nods; and then lets go of John's fingers. Reaching over for his tea.

John stops. Silence. The waitress is all the way back on the other side of the restaurant, head tilted over her mobile, the ends of her ponytail just breaking across the seam of her sleeve. Could almost smell pressed close breathed deep. Filling up his lungs.
—and then closes his teeth on the little metal ring and gives him a little tug and John slams his hand down on the headboard. Groans, doubled over, as that squeezing-too-tight feeling shivers out across the whole of his skin and Sherlock pulls him down hard and gives him a hot, wet kiss, licking into him so wet and open from the thick plummy head of Sherlock's cock getting wet getting him wetter so that he could eat it back out of him with his hands wrapped hard around his hips to hold him tight to his face as though John weren't braced against the headboard weren't grinding down on his face while moaning right into him Sherlock licks, and licks, and licks. Gives him a little tender teasing fuck with his tongue and John wants—he wants— "More," gasping; gasping, "
"You look beautiful," John says, quiet, and touches Sherlock's pink mouth. "You're the most beautiful—"
"I'm not," Sherlock—mouth warm against him so soft and John wouldn't, could never, wants only to—is slowly saying, "I'm not...
the pitch of his voice is dropping, when he says, "on my way home."
Sherlock's mouth twists, unhappily. "You look like I've just confessed to you some sort of—tragic childhood sexual trauma—"
, John thinks. "I suppose," he says. Sherlock has never been precisely sterling at following directions. John goes over the garlic again: another series of chops, another quarter turn.
"No," Sherlock gasps, "I want—. John, I—.
as shifting his weight knee and elbow John whispers, "While I feel how wet you've got for me": bending down to lick Sherlock's throat, wrapping his dripping cock in a slick, desperate fist.
, triumphant: as all the doors in his chest unlock so that at last John can duck his head down and repeat, "You wanted to see me, sir," more quietly, looking up through his eyelashes at Sherlock's long hands, his borrowed spectacles, his pink cheeks. John's borrowed skin is settling into his body, feeling strange and off-balance and
Over some time of John not-tugging Sherlock's hair slowly, so slow: he settles. Slow: John is held still heart-beating,
"We did get that far," Sally says. "But other than the one at Kew Gardens, none of the bombs have been at all dangerous, and the threats have all been for times when the tourists aren't precisely heaving in—middle of the night, or early in the morning; and he went so far as to threaten Westminster Abbey at quarter to nine in the morning and then send
John laughs.
"I'm just that good of a friend." John licks at his lips, tasting nothing. Aches. "Can I kiss you, or—"

And he can't he doesn't what should he with his hands hovering a breath above Sherlock's blotchy trembling skin while Sherlock sobs into John's duvet and helpless John repeats over and over, over and over, "it's all right, you're in my room, you're all right," over and over, "we're home, we're in the flat in Baker Street": until allatonce Sherlock shudders pushing up his back into John's stretched-out hollow hand and gasping John pets shakily up to Sherlock's nape gasping, "All right, I can—is this all right, does it—help," as shuddering Sherlock is pushing his spine up against John's hand and still sobbing and so John clambers lying down next to him half-holding to make space for Sherlock to jerk up and drag over shivering clawing his body to John's body while he makes a terrifying, metal-on-stone grinding as he shoves his tear-wet face hot to John's throat. John wraps his arms around him, heart pounding, holding tight-tight-tight while Sherlock paws at John's back and John's shoulders and helpless John rubs at his neck and Sherlock's ribs heave—and grind—and
"M'not much of a test," John manages. "Not in trouble much," he says, unsteady, "am I," but if he hadn't hadn't been—if he hadn't been such a fucking—

He'd meant to go to see this woman, and he'd meant to take John along; but somewhere in the breath between that moment and the moment when Sherlock'd not-quite-slammed their front door he'd decided—to go alone, that's all. A lie: the sort that, for years, has made John angry: that's all, that's

—and the
"I like this," John says quietly, "being. Close." He rubs at Sherlock's back, tense and hunched beneath his shirt. John swallows. He says, "Does it—"
Sherlock shakes his head, hair scraping on the pillow. "You are." Rubbing his open palms up the tops of John's thighs, slow. Slow. He's flushing, blooming up his chest and throat in dark red palm-sized splotches: it's hypnotic. "I like looking at you," Sherlock says, very quietly.
Sherlock is flushing. Redder when he pulls back, looking down at John. His eyes soft at the edges: old-paper yellow, sea green.
Careful, battering inside his cheeks and his temples. Gentle, he thinks, and slow.
Sherlock's face breaks, grinning. He closes his eyes, rubbing at his own face and not looking at John; but not arguing, is he.
"Christ." Looks back down, thumb at the shell of Sherlock's ear. Sherlock puts his mouth over the half-slipped flies of John's boxers and breathes out hot and wet and damp, and John swallows hard. "I swear to you I'm not usually so quick off the mark," he says, breathless, "but you'd better—"
He tastes like John's skin. "Could, you know," John murmurs.
"How convenient." Sherlock's hand loose around him, barely moving—John's blood mixed-up everywhere all over but still half of him half-hard in Sherlock's gentle stroking hand. "Good?"
"We were going to have breakfast," Sherlock says, under his breath.
"Yeah. Wait—is Rhoda still here?"
"Come to bed with me," he says, very quietly. It's absurd. It's nowhere near dark yet. But Sherlock— "To sleep or—or lie down, or." John stops. Rubs at the jut of Sherlock's hip, helpless. "Or whatever you want," John says, low and rough. "Whatever you need."
that kind of,            and.
Alone, on the landing.
"No—because it makes me furious," Sherlock says dismissively; and John feels his face get hot. "Even though you chose to go somewhere where lots of people got to point weapons at you—"

His arm 'round John's middle is heavy and warm. Curled close, warm and safe, not quite pressed everywhere together. John takes a breath, shuddering-relaxing: at last, at

Held back John brushes a kiss over Sherlock's mouth, tastes a hot-sour bitten spot on his lip. "Who says I'm stopping?" asks John, quiet. He pets a palm up Sherlock's fuzzed, wet thigh.
, three days in: Sherlock's velvet-soft allover thick and soothing pushing John's jaw and soft palate apart, John tonguing at the salt-wet slithery taste of him at the tip (Sherlock had waited for him: John remembers. Sherlock had washed his hair). When John licks at him and sucks and swallows, Sherlock's sounds: low rough throat-caught vowels, and John pulls off to rub his fist upover around him just long enough to watch Sherlock scrub one big palm across his hot-flushed face. Throat fluttering-full John puts his mouth down back around him dragging animal-salt along the wet insides of his cheeks. Less hollow, John sucks, swallows— "Please," Sherlock breathes, low and rough: John sucks. "Can you—"
John nods. "Take down a drug lord or two."
It's quiet, he thinks.
. All that but again some certain kind of... misfiring, perhaps; misfiling, at least: a lack of comprehension of John getting off when John could get off and not thinking that much about it, that had hidden, for half a decade, behind all Sherlock's prickliness and dogmatism and condescending superiority about everything else on the planet; that had looked like something it wasn't, and hadn't looked like it hurt. When John'd come back from Rebecca's that first time Sherlock'd been sitting in his chair half-hidden behind the paper, which John had long been convinced he only read to view his own face in a larger size. He'd missed the clear line of sight to the door.

John swallows. Prickling skin-shell throat tight all-over feeling—
John nods. "I do," he agrees. Sherlock didn't, as it happens, sound entirely certain; but. John says, "I like pretending you're my hot lesbian girlfriend, too."
"God you can I I want," says Sherlock; and then stops. Hands: digging under the belt. Swallows, hard, twice: loud enough to hear. "Can I make you come again?" he asks, unsteady; and John laughs. Swallowing: he rubs his knuckles across Sherlock's hot cheek and Sherlock twists. Bites down on the end of John's thumb.
Sherlock frowns. Fat bottom lip: absurd; honestly, sometimes John could just—as huffily Sherlock says, "But I don't lie about anything
Sherlock nuzzles the side of John's nose. Beneath his eye. Across the tugging, sensitive scrape of his stubble, just missing — his — mouth,
; so as quick as he can John lies back down to press tight against him ribs touching, kissing him through the hammering rush of Sherlock's racing hot pulse, and Sherlock grabs at him, skull and shoulders, clinging; John touching him inside and out. They kiss: half-unbreathing. Sherlock's tongue slipping into him as John pets the blood-hot membrane borders of him, fucking his fingers slow just into his trembling tensed body while Sherlock kisses his mouth open for his heart. John pets, pets, curling his fingers: Sherlock flinches. John stills, but Sherlock is gasping, "No—no, don't, don't stop": breath caught and high, his whole body. Christ John doesn't want to but Sherlock asked so slow slow slow with his fingers tucked inside him John kisses him, slow. Slow and tender open-panting-mouthed with his fingers just-petting at the rim of him: Sherlock draws his knee up higher, his breath fast and shallow as John cradles his head in his arm and presses his body to his body trying to read him in his quavering silence: wanting and dreading and dreading what he wants and so—careful. Don't make him—while Sherlock gasps shoulder-squeezing and John nuzzles his face and rubs his thumb against him with his two fingers inside him and his mouth opening soft on Sherlock's wet mouth as Sherlock pants. Tensed, unsurprising, all over: Christ. John rubs his thumb against him: careful, slow. It wasn't like this, he is thinking. It wasn't anything like this when he got Sherlock open for his plug in Sherlock's bed a thousand years ago and Sherlock'd just—gone. Yielding: easy. Where had he gone? John hadn't known to miss him, but it'd been nothing like Sherlock's unsteady hitching breath or the hardtight clench of his body or his green-eyed purple-smudged face with its edges cracked open: a wire stretched around wanting and terror and misery. That—that can't have been better, can it? Not knowing that—not knowing he didn't want and still—and Christ helpless John kisses Sherlock's throat Sherlock's jaw Sherlock's cheek. The damp pink edge of his open panting mouth: "All right?" John asks, heavy. Still petting.
A kiss. They kiss.

"Yeah?" Sherlock is smiling. Pressed hot to John's hair— "Should I do it now?" Hand tucked between them, rubbing his palm over John's hot stinging skin. "Turn you over my knee?"

Sherlock doesn't answer, plugging the drive into his laptop—no, John's laptop, which was closer.
Helpless, John reaches over the gear lever for his hand, which winds up with his.
"Want me to do it better, this time?" asks John quiet; and watching him, quiet, Sherlock hesitates, and then says, "All right."
John pets at his hair, scratches at his scalp. Under the white t-shirt and the dressing gown Sherlock's shoulders hunch up.
"Is that." He swallows, feeling—. "Is that a thing I can be," he asks: knived. "If you're sleeping with me?" Cut up all over inside.
When Sherlock leans back, John looks up, trying too late not to catalogue: most of the eggs, a slice and a half of toast, all the tea. "All right?" John asks, but Sherlock is already pushing up to his feet. John follows him into the kitchen. Gets started scrubbing out the pan from the eggs while Sherlock scrapes the rest of his dinner into the bin: when Sherlock brings his plate over he's frowning, like he can't entirely work out how John wound up doing the washing up again. "You can dry," John tells him, like it's a concession; so Sherlock dries.
It comes out belligerently, and John wonders, really, if he didn't make such a habit of wandering 'round their flat and the various cabs and crime scenes of the greater London area paying attention to Sherlock Holmes, if he'd miss the little pink blush creeping up his throat; if he'd take the tone seriously and say—

"Hm." Sherlock inhales. "I don't want to go out, you'll put on pants if we do. What've we got? Besides beans."
good-looking and clever and employed in interesting fields, but he isn't going to take her second sister for lunch on Saturday, is he. He knows that. Just spouts out some nonsense about already having plans and ducks back into his office, doesn't even think about it until later. He's busy. He's been busy. Nothing more.
John licks his lips. Laughs, a bit. "Survival technique." He brushes the edge of the mark on Sherlock's fair throat: hesitant, until Sherlock arches into it, inhaling.
"You could tell me about it, if you want to," John says. The words feel thick, in his mouth, a poor fit; beneath him, Sherlock blinks, mouth open, staring down. John kisses him again, just alongside the strap of the bra. "Tell me how I lured you home with me," John explains, "while my parents are on holiday in Weymouth": and all in an instant opening wide looking down at him, sun-bright, Sherlock—
Gentle. Brisk. He rubs the shaving foam all over Sherlock's palm and his fingers and his forearm, smoothing it out, before he squeezes the tip of Sherlock's little finger in his fingers, and then hand over hand petting rubs up-over up-over and in, pulling smooth and steady and slow. The shaving foam works better than he'd really hoped: Sherlock's skin, sliding slick on his skin. Sherlock is watching him, eyes half closed, breathing slowly: in, out, in.
"All right?" John asks, quiet. Sherlock swallows noisily, twice. Up-down, John thinks, unseeing. Up-down. "It's you and me, Sherlock," John says, quiet; and Sherlock nods.
"Christ," John is gasping, gasps; "

"He's not got any right," Sherlock says, with a plaintive note, sounding oddly young; but then he bites his lip; bends down to give John a quick, hard kiss; and then straightens up, shoulders squared, face flushed.

"I'd expect it took you some time," he says, finally, and Sherlock lifts his head.
"Have you—are you done, then," Sherlock asks, under his breath.
"Yeah." John puts his back into it: sodding eggs. "Word on the medical receptionist grapevine is that Tariq is recently single," he explains, "and, I gather, looking somewhat aggressively"; and beside him Sherlock makes an uninterpretable sound.
"I know," John says, still giggling. "I know."
: amber-blue, his sliver of bare heaving shining sternum soft skin wanting—his hands‚ and—his little bitten not-half-silent little lovely grunts with his bowing back as John's knees dig into wet and grit and John holds the base of Sherlock's thick cock and tries to get him so deep he'd undo the knot in John's chest he'd pull him all the way open and shudder into him,
"You should—you should do what you, whatever you want," Sherlock says, a little too fast; and then hunches the whole of himself together. Burrowing his body against John's body, as though he could push—in.
John brushes his knuckles over Sherlock's knee. Scoots his chair closer. "I liked them," he admits, quiet. "So it took me a bit." Rests his hand, soft, low down on Sherlock's disheveled shirt, just above where earlier he'd pulled it untucked at the back.
God. In 1986, Sherlock was—what, nine? No. Ten. Living in Wolvercote, John knows, with his gran. "I have a very hard time imagining any of you in America," John admits; and then brushes his thumb across Sherlock's cheek.
but not soon enough to prevent them from crashing into the side table, lamp wobbling and John's mobile falling off the back as they stumble—

"Bet you can do, come on," John says, "I'll squish up"; and squishes up: fait accompli.
"Not as good as I want to be." Sherlock swallows. That little softwet doubled sound. "Everything—I want to, to give you," he says, "I want to—I want to—be able to see it, I want to know what you want before—before you know it," stumbling; and startled, John laughs.
Accuracy.
He fixes a sharp, thoughtful stare on John's face. Hot.
John. Nods.
"I love you," John says, unsteadily, and then presses their foreheads together. "I—I'm
and Sherlock moans pushing up against him as delirious John—
"Can we," John says. Stops.
John scratches his nose against Sherlock's wet scalp, thinking.
John takes his hand. Touching his palm, his wrist. All his long fingers, tangling with John's fingers as John tugs. Draws him out of the kitchen. Through the living room. Stretched between them their arms like a bridge: John wants to walk across it.
—he wonders.
He leans back against the window as he does his dressing gown up, clumsy-fingered. His whole body is buzzing. Wide awake.
Sorry about the delay; I've had a cold; I'm still planning 59 for the 13th; let's see if I hate myself for saying that in a week and a half!!
—sighs.
—while Sherlock nods and writhes and nods and pulls at him, panting, John's shivering-shuddering hips and spine in his restless moving hands as John comes, and comes, and comes.
John swallows. "Yeah," he says, helpless.
"What do you think," Sherlock asks, under his breath, "rugby coach, or—" and John laughs, helpless. It's absurd. It's so absurd. It's so absurd it shouldn't— "Fine," Sherlock is saying, clipped; "I had a bit of a chat with your coach, then,
rough: "Whether or not," John adds, "you let me play with your tits." It isn't a lie. He doesn't think he's ever been so honest about anything else in his life.
After a moment, Sherlock says, "I missed you."
Friday John gets up and showers and shaves and goes to work and comes back and makes himself pasta for dinner and brushes his teeth and goes to bed and Saturday he wakes up and Sherlock's in again. Sitting fully dressed at their table with toast and jam and a copy of the
"Yeah," John says, quiet.
"Sherlock," John croaks; as Sherlock is saying, "—have you just. Pushed down over the edge of the table, p-peeled naked and—" and John buries his face in his hands.
"Do you find my discipline to be insufficient?" Holmes is asking. Sherlock. Holmes. There's a note of gentleness in his voice that scrapes against the insides of John's chest. John's eyes are prickling, his knuckles white.
"Hungry?" Sherlock asks.
"Oh, you've got enough," John counters, unsteady; and then scrubs his palms over his face.
me," and John groans, "Yes, I'd—I'd moan for it, I'll always—" and Sherlock slaps him across the face and John shudders, head to toe. Writhing, pinned, hard to breathe and Sherlock drags his head back up. Gulping sobs.
. He could hold open for Sherlock a door; a window. Held open a trapdoor for him once, memorably, in Swansea. John could do things past counting for the chance to lie down just beside him in the bed where Sherlock asked John to kiss him and do up his hooks: one, by one, by one.
John scans a jar of gherkins, then a jar of gherkins, while the phone rings. Three ninety-five. Three ninety-five. Then the phone rings, and he scans a jar of gherkins. He wishes the woman with the handlebar moustache would answer the phone, which is ringing, but he supposes that since the rest of the staff have all been moved to the submarine, she must be rather busy. He's not even entirely certain she works for Tesco's. If she did she might pick up the phone.
get wet, John notes: not as wet as John, not by half, but the tip of Sherlock's cock is already leaving a sticky kiss against the hollow of John's hip, tucked flush. John swallows, kneeling up: already too hot. Bends down for Sherlock's throat, Sherlock's chest, the dark coral peaks of his nipples; Christ, squirming and arching for John's mouth more eagerly than most girls. John licks over the line of his bottom ribs, nuzzles back up under his arm: Sherlock jerks underneath him, digs his hand into John's hair. Shoving him
After a moment John thinks he can manage, "For so long everything that had anything to do with you was just so
Mycroft doesn't answer, for a moment. Then he says, "How long has it been?"
John laughs, then realizes she's serious. "What, really?" he asks. "Like—Peter James, or—"
"That's." John laughs, a little rough. Knee up, up, up; over Sherlock's shoulder—stretching—
: anyone other than Sherlock, John knows, wouldn't've been able to stop. If you were me, I mean.
—and between their bodies Sherlock holds up his hands, trying to tug his expression into something more serious, and John gets all his long fingers wet.
"Do you think he heard us?" Sherlock asks, hunched over the hob, tilting the pan from side to side to spread the batter.
"Hm."
He can't. His throat—closed. Barely breathing.
Sherlock licks into him for a long, long time. John keeps silent as long as he can and then moans until his voice gives out, but Sherlock keeps going, John shuddering on the edge of coming and never—quite—tipping over—; and then the bell rings downstairs. Sherlock groans, but he gets up; wipes his chin on the back of his hand and clambers off the bed. He's obviously hard through his trousers and his face is shiny and red but then he disappears down the stairs and a few seconds later John can hear him talking to Paige at the front door. John closes his eyes. With a case on offer, he won't be back for more. John waits until he hears the door shut again, counts footsteps up seventeen steps. Then he tucks his hand under his hips to give himself something to fuck into and thinks about the long grass and his uniform trousers and Sherlock rolling over onto his back after, chin wet breathing hard, while John unfastened his flies and then bent his head down so that Sherlock could come in his mouth and John could swallow and swallow and swallow. His orgasm feels a little bit like being punched in the head. He can barely drag himself under the covers, after.
"I'll wash it, too," John says. "Haven't since—well, I probably ought to anyway, before it gets too cold for it to dry."
John shakes his head, shakes his head. God. "Nothing," he whispers, "like." Fingertips under his button: tug, but no room for them to be closer: John tugs. He can hear Sherlock swallow, so close. "Just because," Sherlock says, "
"Bianca is tracing him as we speak," Mycroft says, "and Chloe is on call."
; as though all the four of them, arranged in tidy pairs, were sedately, unremarkably, in love. All throughout that wretched meal Brian and Michael and Cal had chatted agreeably about real estate prices and and the disappointing trim on last year's Audi A4 and the general unreliability of babysitters hired to keep some sort of regular date night while John drank steadily in something near silence as, every few moments, Brian landed a look upon him that'd been scornful, cutting and too-knowing and, and, all that and also just
"Having sex with Vic felt like trying to raise the dead," John says, at last. Sherlock warm and living and touching him all over; and the hard hot lump of his loss, still trapped somewhere at the roots of John's heart. Knotted up. Quietly John says, "But it was me that came back, instead."
Sherlock pulls up, hair sticking up all over, face pink lips red, and John laughs. Folds his hand over his face so he won't see.
John nods.
"It's less lonely," Sherlock says, unsteady, "with you": and helpless John cradles his face in his hands and tries to fit everything Sherlock can't hear him say into a kiss.
at home, he feels as though he is a home waiting only for its other half to pull itself shut around them: the comfortable, unprepossessing kind of untidy of their living room, stacks of books wherever someone was last reading them, unopened post in a slithery puddle on the mantle, coins and receipts and half-dried-out biros scattered across the table between their chairs. For the first time in years it makes the back of John's neck prickle; crackle like lightning, not yet struck. The mess is not all Sherlock: an ordinary, everyday-use sort of thought. Steadier John can remember that upstairs he still can't leave a wet flannel hanging over the edge of the sink, a kind of mixed-blessing legacy of being in the military for over a decade; but when he'd come up on Saturday to find something to sign the papers with he'd just dug around wherever he'd thought to look and left his discards where they fell—pencils; pink highlighter; Sherlock's fountain pen, heavy and engraved along one silver side:
His voice is dropped low—very low. He looks up, though. Meets John's eyes.
, what was John fucking
work they are doing."
That sort of—wrapping up, and—mouth, rough-warm Sherlock's. And.
John pauses.
That does the trick, mostly. Sherlock hums but holds still, and John scrubs; scrubs; rinses the flannel and then wipes over his cheek, gentle: that one pinker, a bit, now, than the other. "There," he says; and Sherlock opens his eyes, looking up at him, mouth quirked but still obviously fighting it, trying for irritated, deservingly.
Sherlock is blinking, blinking. "Yeah. Yes." The fading light from the window behind John's shoulders, just catching in the frilling-soft pale fuzz around Sherlock's eyes. "It feels good."
like—devouring his heart as gasping, "Fuck," Sherlock gasping, gasping as John licks into him into him
After a moment, John stands, comes out into the kitchen and fills the kettle, then heads upstairs to get dressed. It's past three: he's spent enough of his day in a dressing gown. It could just be his imagination, but he thinks it eases Sherlock's shoulders down a bit as well, when John comes back down in a shirt buttoned to the collar and his oldest pair of jeans: Sherlock sets down the violin and takes the tea John hands him and mostly doesn't meet John's eyes, but he does lean in to dart a kiss against the corner of John's mouth, then turn away again, his face pink. John knows better than to push it. He takes his tea over to the sofa. Sherlock sits down in his chair.
"That's why he employs all those terrifyingly well-dressed young women," Sherlock agrees, hot on John's ear. Closer:
Upstairs. Upstairs amid the streaming billows of clean summer air flooding sweet into his bedroom he shakes his sheets out across his bed. He smooths them flat. He pulls them tight. He shakes his pillows into his pillowcases, one at a time, and then snaps them tight. Smooths them flat. The top sheet is wrinkled so he shakes it loose and then tosses it out across his mattress, then brushes it smooth and pulls the edges taut, then smooths it out with his hand and then he picks it up because it's wrinkled, and tosses it out. Jerks it flat. Brushes in smooth with the palm of his hand so that it can lie there in all the clean rain-crisp air where it will wait for his still drying duvet, and it is done, nearly; done, at least, as he can at this moment cause it to be. His familiar tidy room with its cool floorboards and the bed pressed under the window framed with Mrs. Hudson's filmy curtains and not quite enough room beside the base of the lamp on the bedside table and the chair at the foot of the bed where John sits to put on his shoes. It's just a room, in some ways, but it's John's room, isn't it. He'd been glad to come home. By November of 2014 parts of John had stopped missing Sherlock, nearly; that low heavyblank hollowness that he had known, intellectually, was, in fact, grief had shifted and changed inside him until, when Sherlock had, in fact, come back, and come back different, John had almost been something not entirely unlike annoyed.
And he breathes.
After a long, taut moment, waiting. "It was miserable for you," Sherlock says, quiet; and John swallows and "Close," he says, "enough."
"All right," she says. "Why the invitation, then?"
John reaches over. Touches the side of Sherlock's trousers, quick, just above the knee.
Sherlock hesitates for a moment, before saying, "A. Lover, of sorts, I suppose."
John wraps his arms around Sherlock's waist.
Sherlock is very gentle, when they kiss. John is gentle, too. He likes it, he is finding, with a warm prideful flush of pleasure and embarrassment: how absurd it feels, how private. Here is a newly unshadowed unseen thing: Sherlock with his big hands braced behind John's back so he can lean his long warm body into John's body, so he can trade with him small not-quite-silent kisses, so he can rest their foreheads together in between. John pets his long spine through his shirt. It has been a very long time, John is thinking, since he has kissed anyone quite like this. It makes him feel soft, and foolish, and glad.
"You can," John says, "if you want to."
got the release date marked on our calendars"; and Denise says, "You're not old enough to have the release date marked on your calendar"; and Natalie gives her the finger. Sherlock's eyes are darting around the table with a stiff, somewhat shell-shocked look, one arm still holding his coat shut tight, the other still clutching his untouched wine. John feels dreadful, almost, for a moment; but he's had too much to drink for it to really properly stick.
"Your legs?" John asks, curving his fingers back down against the tops of the backs of Sherlock's thighs.
, he'd said, finally; and looked up to meet George's clear, unjudgmental brown eyes.
"So—I make these into a little roll, do I?" John asks, holding up one slithery stocking; and Sherlock nods, dragging his right foot across the duvet, to set it up on John's knee: "Without twisting," John adds, dropping his thumb to press momentarily into Sherlock's instep.
"Will you tell me I'm pretty?"
She says, "I can't imagine you saved everyone you saw in the army, either."
Sherlock is silent. After a long, taut moment, he nods.
"Hello," John murmurs, later.
John isn't laughing. He is nodding, he finds. They are standing very, very close.
Sherlock's fingers fall soft into his hair, and John rubs like a cat into his palm. John bends down, careful, and licks a single thick stripe up Sherlock's cock, then looks up.
"Thank you," Rhoda says. Half-smiling. "I think."
Sherlock's nostrils flare, but he starts unbuttoning his shirt. "Long enough to know you moan for it like it's the best you've ever had," he sneers. "A little gently-blue toy prick with fake balls that probably came in a starter kit for exploring anal play on discount at Lovehoney, hm? Was your rubbish lube included, too?"
"All right," John says. "Yes. But—"
Won't meet his eyes, will he? Looking down at the baseboards like an errant schoolboy and taking a breath air on John's back and his tongue and all at once a weighted, indescribable feeling, doors: opening, and he presses up onto his toes. An impulse. The hot tender edge of Sherlock's red cheek, rough with day-old whiskers; and caught in John's fingers, still, the bird-breast thrum of his lovely, angular wrist.
But of course the things that are and are not in Sherlock's vocabulary remain, to John, a perpetual, unplumbable mystery: don't they. Don't they. When Sherlock'd come back in November he'd showered—not slept: John could tell—at Mycroft's, twice; and then, for several days, in 221C—on, according to Mrs. Hudson, an ancient and leaking lilo, that would (she said) hurt even the back of a boy. When Sherlock had found out she'd told John about the lilo he had left 221C and then paid for three nights, one at a time, in a succession of low-end dingy hostels where
Nose tucked down close against him Sherlock says, "Like so?" breath warm on the edge of John's chin.
"Yeah," John says. "Long day. And I slept through my alarm this morning, so—"
," arching his hips up-up, his erection brushing John's jeans, and Christ, that must sting, mustn't it? John undoes them while he kisses across Sherlock's ribs. "
"Could you come?" Sherlock asks.
The monstrous thing inside John's ribs twists and snarls, so John bends down, spine curved 'til it aches, and gets his hand tight around the base. Kisses the head and licks at it, feeling—feeling—
"I'd've left work early, you know," John says, thick; and fast Sherlock replies, "Would you?"
"I'm not worried I'd be—" he waves a hand— "unfaithful, or that he'd—break up with me, if it even makes sense to—it's not that kind of a relationship." He inhales, very slowly. "But I—I do worry that I can't give him what he needs, that I—can't do this without hurting him, and he's already proven he can walk away once, hasn't he?"
"Yeah," Sherlock says, "or—or it's more, or less, or—I don't know," he says, voice tight. "I don't know. But—"
After a shower and a shave he feels better, mostly. Nearly. The rain has stopped. He opens the window in his bedroom and breathes in, and in, and in. When he comes back downstairs Sherlock is in the kitchen scraping a pan into a bowl—and that's hollandaise, Christ, John's a terrible person. Sherlock doesn't even like hollandaise, and he
; and John rubs at his face, thinking. Thinking.
"Yes," Mycroft says. "I've already had Bianca let the police know to expect you."
"On the surgery, this time," Rhoda says, "for making us all work through lunch," and Natalie bounces up onto her toes: her hair bounces, too, and she claps her narrow hands.
He swallows. Shakes his head.
Could just. Knees over his shoulders, and. "Yeah." Wavering. "Yeah."
"It's." Sherlock swallows. "
; as Sherlock rubs his mouth against John's sweaty back and says, "Yes."
, and
"Or maybe," Sherlock says, breathless, and grabs at John's hip, fucking into him hard: "
Caught: Sherlock groans. "Go slow," John tells him, and whining licking at the gaps between John's wet fingers Sherlock fucks up into him as John's nipples knot up with his stomach and his balls, a hot tight "Y": uncomfortable. Painful; he wants more. "Christ what you do to me," John is—speaking, helpless: a letting-out; as under him Sherlock moans 'round his fingers, eyes fluttering shut. "Are you—Christ." John swallows. Bending. Forehead to forehead, folded half in half: shifting underneath him Sherlock whines and John pets at his tongue and the edges of his lips and his jaw opening up panting into him as John inhales. Exhales, as Sherlock gulps at his air. "I—John," Sherlock says. Thick. Shifting underneath him shivering into a moan: "
