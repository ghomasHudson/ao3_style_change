"I'm human but that doesn't mean I couldn't have done something more." Greg mumbled as he leaned into Mycroft's touch, surprised that Mycroft was holding him so gently. "I could have been working on this three years ago. I could have kept looking for a trail and I didn't. Once Sherlock told me he wouldn't be able to help me and the case went cold I just stopped and if I hadn't those families wouldn't be dead right now." His voice cracked slightly and he looked down.
Victor didn't fall asleep right away, instead choosing to take in every detail of the moment before allowing himself to succumb to sleep. He knew he was insanely lucky to even be still in the flat, let alone to be here cuddled up in bed with the two of them. He shifted some so Sherlock would be more comfortable against his shoulder, watching how John followed him to stay close to Sherlock. He tried to pull his hand back but John grunted and pulled so that their hands remained exactly where they were on Sherlock's stomach. He then, still asleep, started rubbing his thumb over Victor's palm, the effect of which was what finally drove Victor into a deep restful sleep unlike any he'd had in years.
to behave." He smirked as he watched John put on his shoes. He wanted nothing more than to strip that smirk off John's face and pound him into the couch. He took a deep breath trying to keep his mind focused. "But you can embarrass him for me," He offered with a hopeful smile. "It's very easy to do." He assured his lover. When John walked toward him with
"Yes, I do." He whispered, trying to keep himself calm and focused. The feel of Sherlock's hands on his skin felt like it was leaving behind trails of electric. He held himself as steady as he could trying to be a good submissive.
He kissed Hamish's cheek a few times.
"Things sure are different for you all now, aren't they?" Mrs. Hudson said fondly, smiling.
"You could have come here." Hamish said softly, tears falling heavily and he beat his tiny fists against Victor's chest. "You could have stayed. I don't need room. I need Daddy happy!"
"I'm glad you decided to stay." He whispered not really sure what his mind was doing. "It's nice to have someone who... Understands." He blushed a bit more, meeting Victor's gaze again. "I hope you will let me help more now." He looked down at their hands with a small smile and wondered if it made Victor feel as content to touch John as it made John feel to touch him. His heart belonged to Sherlock but he couldn't deny that Victor's touch was pleasant and calming. Victor looked away from John, a shy smile on his lips. He didn't know why he was so warm and happy. Part of him felt like it was because he was close to Sherlock, but he another part of him whispered that John was rather a factor in that warm fuzzy feeling as well.
"I'm sure." John moaned loudly, his toes curling slightly as Sherlock worked. "Fuck..." He whispered, beginning a string of profanities. He shook
"I'll pay to get you a new one." He muttered sounding embarrassed, he looked back and saw the exasperated look on John's face. "Mycroft wouldn't stop sending you messages about how I was becoming a danger to you, so I sort of... Lost my temper and threw it at the wall. Sorry." Greg gave a chuckle from outside and Sherlock gave a huff. "Go make tea, Greg. John's throat is sore." He ordered, not wanting to have Greg's judgment coming down on him now as well. Greg went to reply but John cut him off.
While Mycroft had been showing his son how to pretend Sherlock had been trying to smooth things over with the noticeably upset Alex. Sherlock knew he was uncomfortable with the fact that John and Victor had gone outside alone and he really wanted him to be comfortable.
"Okay!" Hamish grinned and as he giggled he ran over to their stack of DVDs looking over them. Sherlock moved almost on automatic as he worked to build the fort. Hamish brought the movie over to John. "Can we watch this one?" He asked excitedly.
John's illness is getting worse, Sherlock has the flu, and Victor arrives... But Victor doesn't find what he expects in the good Doctor but how could he? They're the only two men in the world who are mad enough to fall for Sherlock Holmes.
"I'm sorry..." He whispered and he kissed the top of both their heads before sweeping off and out the door, Greg having to run after him to keep up. Sherlock had no words even as Greg scolded him down the stairs, he was too wrapped up inside his head.
"I think I'm the exact opposite of romantic considering the fact John and I have been together for a few days and this is our first date, Greg." Sherlock snapped softly, annoyance in his tone.
For the first time in his life Sherlock finds himself being studied the way he studies everyone and everything around him.
“If anything, you gave him a bit of joy, I think.” John adds.
“My grave.”
John can Hear Sherlock’s snort of disdain.
Sherrinford lowers himself off the table. “Yes we do.”
He doesn’t need to look again to know that two of the three uniformed men are growing angry, their faces flushing red in a way that has nothing to do with ambient temperature. In the back of his mind, John thinks:
(See the end of the chapter for
John can feel Sherlock’s boredom from across the room; it emanates from him the way heat radiates through the flat when the oven is turned up full blast and the door to it is wide open. The detective is pacing beside the bed—four long strides up and four long strides back. John rolls over onto his back and cracks one eye open, trying hard not to think about the oven door left open at the flat. He makes a quick mental note to send a text to Mrs. Hudson as soon as possible. Internally shrugging, he reminds himself it has been almost twenty-four hours since they’ve been home.
“I didn’t.” Sherlock knows it now. “I said there’s at least one place you should be.”
God, to be twenty five again. “Night, Dale.” John tells him, rolling his eyes at the ceiling. He rolls his shoulders, wincing at the stiffness from being idle settling in. Locking the front door and slipping the key back under the mat, he decides to walk for a little while in hopes that the exercise will work some of the kinks out of his back. It’s a decent night, anyway, a little cool and damp but not enough to deter him.
Apparently the building was used as offices for some business or the other because there are still a row of chairs in front of the big front windows and an empty reception desk with what looks to be an original Apple computer still perched on it. He brushes off some of the dust and whistles lowly.
They are all silent except for an odd squeak from Martin.
He knows she feels it, too, when she hugs him tightly and says, “I’ve chosen quite the brood for myself, haven’t I, John?”
For auld lang syne, my jo,
“Christopher, we were so glad to hear your sister was found,” the ginger-haired woman states honestly.
Sherlock’s Mind Voice slices John’s thoughts cleanly in two.
“You’ve upset Ophelia.”
John doesn’t need the story repeated, frankly, because he was there, but it has something to do with the people on the plane in front of them; an older man and a girl about seven years old. When the man left his seat to use the lavatory, the little girl finished off the man’s tiny bottle of whatever-the-hell-kind-of-whiskey-they-serve-these-days-on-cheap-flights-to-America-because-Sherlock-was-being-pigheaded-and-didn’t-want-to-go-anyway…
Naturally, Sherlock had been a stubborn prat during the whole booking process, but at least he had been a silent prat. Somehow, at the end of it, they’d managed to be locked into a holding cell together and luckily with no one else. John wonders if he should make an effort to thank him for keeping his yap shut.
So far, John has been impressed that Sherlock is controlling his temper. A quick thought of maybe getting out of here crosses his mind, but it’s already three seconds too late.
“Don’t say anything.” John warns under his breath.
“Ah, Martin, I never took you to be so forceful. Was it a good kiss?” Sherlock rumbles over Sophie’s giggles.
"I want to. I just want to know what it would be like. They've shared you, I want see what that feels like. I belong to you but I want to see what it would be like to have Sherlock handcuff me." Alex chuckled and pressed his lips to Victor's neck. "We've never even tried handcuffs before."
"Can we move closer to Papa?" Hamish asked John in a whisper. He nodded quickly.
"Yes he is and I really am quitting so I won't be seeing you again unless it's dead on the news." Sherlock snapped again, trying to keep his emotion out of his voice and off his face. Victor dramatically placed a hand over his heart and mocked a fainting spell.
"Sherlock and I have some last minute shopping to do since we have a new addition to the family." Mycroft offered to break the silence.
"I want to learn to play the violin like you..." He whispered. Sherlock blushed and chuckled.
"Sherlock! What have you done?!" Mrs. Hudson exclaimed as she came in the door Greg left unlocked. "Oh my table..." John and Greg both dissolved into laughter which then became a coughing fit for John.
"You really should knock before you enter other people’s rooms, John." He said, trying to act calm, but inside he wasn’t calm anymore. He was terrified. "They might have company." He snapped.
"No, we're the Holmes brothers and as John has once pointed out my brother's name literally opens doors." Sherlock regained his countenance, not looking at Alex for the moment. "John, take your medicine." Sherlock said in a soft tone but with firmness. He strode into the bedroom and retrieved the bottle returning it to John with water and standing over him with crossed arms until he took it.
"Hm... I don't believe you." John grinned and kissed Sherlock again, moaning loudly into the kiss. "What if I can't sleep?"
"Alex - are you sure there was nothing
"I feel that way because you're brilliant! You're the smartest person I have ever met! You're one of the most observant, clever, and beautifully insane people in the world. You know so many things and you do all these little things just for me, just
"Well this is quite an interesting little picture." Victor said smiling as he leaned into Alex.
"I can get your tea, Love. Just relax." He whispered in his ear reassuringly as he rubbed his back in soothing circles. He was ignoring Greg and Mycroft's presence all together at this point because he was so utterly focused on John. He brought the cup to John's lips and let him take a few sips before sitting the cub down. "See? You're fine. Don't let him scare you." Sherlock whispered as he started to run his fingers through John's hair. "You're okay," He kissed his cheek a few times, trying to keep his lover here instead of going in to a serve panic attack. This wasn't happening. John was not falling apart. He took a long, slow breath focusing on the floor in front of him. He was fine. There wasn't anything to... The image of Sherlock's face when he'd asked John to leave the flat so he could meet with Victor flashed in his mind and he shuddered. He closed his eyes tight, focusing on his breathing. Five counts in, five counts out.
Magnus set him down by the laundry room, then proceeded to curl up on the floor outside, his head positioned to see straight in. Like watching an insect maintain its nest, Bilbo thought idly. He’d found a book on fabric maintenance in the library and consulted it carefully, as well as his notes, before starting a large pot of water on to boil. Some items he could stir in hot water and soap, and rinse clean; others needed to be sponged and laid out to dry. Eventually he might have to figure out how to make his own clothing, from the bolts of fabric in the treasure hoard. Assuming he lasted that long.
“Thank you.” The door slid open to reveal a shower stall that Bay stepped directly into.
Bay stared after her, still flummoxed. Then he noticed Lestrade watching him, concern on his face, and Bay quickly turned away and began limping purposefully down the road. He didn’t need a detective inspector taking an interest in him, or realizing he’d been abandoned (temporarily?) by his master.
“This is not a negotiation,” Ivan interrupted, standing. He set the axe aside first. “Get in bed. Now.” Nico lifted his chin slightly, blue eyes glittering with defiance. He’d been fairly well-behaved up to this point, really, a bit mouthy but done all he was told. This was the key moment then.
Aquamarine was not embarrassed by Irene’s presence. That would imply he had some kind of civility, sensitivity to local mores. And clearly he did not. He wanted
,” Ivan allowed with a smirk. The boy was not amused. “Wash,” Ivan ordered, winging the wet cloth at him. Unconcerned with his own nakedness he dried with another cloth and then pulled on his clean-ish sleeping clothes—on the march he slept in what he wore during the day, so the thin sleep pants and shirt hadn’t been worn since they were last in a city under their control. But, they
“Yes, another murder,” Magnus repeated impatiently. “You were an Army doctor, do you want to check out the body?”
She released him quickly. “Oh, sorry, Master!” He shook his head and offered her a chair. “He’s just very contrary.” John raised an eyebrow at her; if she understood how ironic he found her complaint, she refused to let on.
“That’s a neat trick, to fall asleep sitting up,” Magnus commented leadingly. “Your eyes were still open, blinking and everything.” He waited.
are too willful, Bay!” he added in frustration.
“How d’you know she had a suitcase?” Lestrade persisted, obtusely.
Another kiss, just the thing to rile him up. Well, a little discipline wouldn’t hurt him. “Really, calm down, that’s all you have to do.” He nipped his ear and the boy swore. “You’re not a very quick learner, are you?” Ivan noted with amusement, taking his opportunity to taste the boy’s skin again. Even with all the other smells and tastes of the era getting in the way, his were familiar, and Ivan closed his eyes and quite lost himself for a moment. Then he realized Nico had finally stilled—quivering with tension, but not struggling. Reluctantly Ivan turned him loose and Nico scrambled to the far side of the bed, eyeing him warily. His gaze darted to the door.
“You and I are—” Magnus interrupted himself, conveniently. “Well, what’s
Magnus popped back out. “He’s my new slave,” he informed Anderson coolly. “Touch him and you’ll regret it. Come on,” he added to Bay, who tried his best to get away from the angry pair.
can tell your servants to prepare baths for all of my men. Bathing once or twice in their lives won’t kill them.”
“Well, then I’ve no idea,” Bay gave up.
“Magnus—two minutes, I said,” Lestrade broke in. “I need anything you’ve got.”
“I was worried I had awakened you,” the dragon claimed, his silky tone too innocent. “I had the most interesting dream, and awoke to find myself kicking at the wall.”
Aquamarine snarled at him, baring his teeth, and John clamped his hand down on the back of his neck. “That’s enough,” he said, completely mystified by Aquamarine’s behavior. “If you’re hurt, tell me where.” He could speak perfectly well.
That seemed to be it, and with a sigh Lestrade shook his head and let Anderson and his team back into the room with the body. Magnus’s performance seemed to be somewhat routine to them—even suspect, Bay observed, although his reasoning had made perfect sense. To Bay, anyway, and what did
“And your archenemy?” Bay guessed evenly.
Magnus moved in for the kill. “So’s Sergeant Donovan.” Anderson’s eyes shifted guiltily to Donovan and Bay pursed his lips, trying not to smirk. Magnus sniffed pointedly. “Ooh, and I think it just vaporized,” he went on cheekily. “May I go in?”

musicians,” Nico responded, and Ivan smirked. He really shouldn’t let the boy get away with so much. “Thought you were all warriors.” This was not a compliment.
sense of how vigilant a proper guard had to be, did they? Aquamarine knew Taffy understood, though.
,” Magnus tried to explain. Sometimes his explanations did not help much. “A little stray Hobbit who came to my door.” He grinned, or so Bilbo thought; he showed his teeth, anyway, which were enormous. “I feed you and keep you warm and give you nice things, don’t I?”
As he started to leave the telephone box, however, the phone rang. Maybe Magnus was calling him back already? Bay picked up the receiver gratefully. “Hello?”
Bay looped it over his head and clicked the ends together at the front of his throat. “Yes, it fits.”
or the
Worst case, Bay would give the driver his master’s contact information, and the man could bill him. Obviously drivers hated doing that, though; it was one of the main reasons many wouldn’t even stop for lone slaves at all, because it wasn’t uncommon for masters to not trust slaves with money. That, and the somewhat apocryphal fear of being charged with helping a slave’s escape attempt. Masters could be very belligerent sometimes.
Bilbo did not believe that, because why would he have such strange and nonsensical images in his head, of worlds he’d never seen and things he couldn’t identify? Surely it was more dragon magic, just meant to unnerve him—to what end, Bilbo couldn’t say, but he supposed dragons got bored, and had to amuse themselves somehow. He could think of worse ways.
Aquamarine raised his eyebrows at him as if to say,
The girls came home shortly after lunch and Aquamarine was drafted to help carry the impressive number of bags in from the cab. John knew his mother didn’t like them cluttering up her front parlor. “We’ll take them out to the tent this evening,” he assured her, holding Taffy so the curious little dog couldn’t get into any of the sacks. “Are you sure you got everything?” he deadpanned to Irene. He could afford what she wanted and didn’t like to tease her too much—her former master had delighted in keeping her without material possessions as it suited him—but he couldn’t
He had planned to be very prepared, so they could get in and out of the city before sunset, when Sherlock’s ban kicked back in—they’d already had to notify Lestrade that they were coming to London for a few hours, and John occasionally wondered if random people were plainclothes police officers assigned to watch them—but once he’d started reading about the slaves John had found he couldn’t sort through them dispassionately. He wanted to take them all home, make sure they were well-treated. Sherlock could’ve managed the advance prep easily, except it bored him too much. So now they were left wandering past the booths of various maids and gardeners and cooks and nannies, John finally forcing himself to do a
Nico watched him suspiciously for a moment, then, when Ivan stretched his legs out before the fire and leaned his head back as though weary, the boy decided it might be alright and knelt on the flagstones, eyeing Ivan’s filthy boots as though formulating a battle strategy for removing them.
Aquamarine sighed and nodded. “
“Yes, of course I want him. Yes,
“They
Magnus closed his eyes without responding and Bay limped closer. Then as Magnus unfurled his arm Bay saw he had not one but three nicotine patches stuck to it, which was what he was pressing on. Bay did not smell any smoke in the flat, so he surmised his new master was a non-smoker, at least now. Good news for his lungs. When Magnus didn’t do anything else Bay hobbled over to a chair and sat, starting to stretch out his leg.
Magnus was crouched beside him, eyes probing his face as though he could read his mind. “There you are,” he remarked when he saw Bay focus again. “The transport’s here.”
“That’s Jennifer Wilson’s case,” he realized, before he could stop himself.
Predictably Irene found this amusing. “The coffee maker? After what you did last night, the
this vaguely sinister confusion, all the hints and assumptions and warnings—but he was finding that he didn’t
Genuine question, or couched command? Oddswise the latter, though odds went out the window with this fellow. “Alright.” Magnus released his hand and Bay lowered himself to his knees with the aid of the nearby wall.
Master was agitated about something, though. Normally he was very calm and confident, but now he paced slightly around the room, obviously deliberating over something. Petulantly Aquamarine found it boring and wanted to go back to his own room. After a moment Master sighed and sat down in a low chair, cheek resting on his fist as he regarded Aquamarine tiredly. “Come take my books off,” he finally said.
“What’s this all about, then?” he asked suddenly, startling himself slightly. He looked at Anthea. “Where are we going? Who’s your master?”
every time I touch you!” he ordered angrily, cupping Bay’s cheek. “I’m not going to hit you, I told you that.”
“Master, what happened?” Irene wanted to know.
“Suitcase?” Lestrade echoed faintly. Bay glanced around but did not see one in the room.
Magic! Magic wasn’t
Leonid opened the door to the bedchamber and pulled the boy inside, trapping him in a corner by the fireplace. Ivan glanced over at them briefly, then went back to the map he had spread on the table before him. The other warriors in the room made eye contact with each other and smirked knowingly.
Lestrade leaned precariously over the rickety railing. “What is it? What?”
“Oh yes, dear, coming right up,” the woman assured him, navigating his mother’s kitchen expertly.
But here was someone telling him they were all true.
“Unlikely!” Magnus declared confidently, popping out of his chair. Bay was not sure Magnus was really the right person to comment on what was likely among normal people. Then again, serial killers were not normal, either.
The bolt of agony shot through him and Bay was unable to stand, his can skittering out from under him as he crunched to the hard floor, half catching the chair. He was angry at himself for letting the pain overwhelm him like that, he was used to pain, used to mistreatment. He could read people well and the man hadn’t given any sign that he was about to attack—which made him very dangerous indeed. Normally at this point he would’ve vanished into his own head, but something told him not to, not here with this man. If he did he might never return.
“Sorry, excuse me.” Bay interrupted the stream of random nonsense his master was spouting. “Could you slow down a bit, please?” The man had sped up walking as well as talking.
Anderson and Donovan blanched with horror while Magnus smirked smugly, before disappearing inside. Bay moved to follow, dropping his gaze and biting his lip a second too late, and Anderson glared murderously at him. “What are you looking at?” the policeman snapped menacingly, raising his arm.

a killer; at the very least, someone who’d facilitated her death, someone who knew she was in trouble but didn’t get help.
know? He continued down the stairs, hoping Magnus wasn’t getting too impatient with him.
“I’m just telling Mrs. Hudson about you,” Magnus shared as Bay sat back down.
He did
Bay tried to breathe regularly, in and out. “My master says I was hit on the head as a child,” he conveyed.
“Oh?”
“Serial killers are always hard,” Magnus proclaimed, with an incongruously cheerful grin. He had dimples. “You have to wait for them to make a mistake.”
He waited to see if the umbrella would rise again but the man merely rolled his eyes. “A bank account could be set up in your name, cash on demand,” he continued. “A meaningful sum every month. You look more like someone who would save it up, though,” he predicted.
“Nuisance!” Magnus declared, of being tired. “I’ve got a case, I’ll sleep when it’s done. I’m going to text Lestrade and see what’s been going on. So you might as well sleep.”
Bay stopped on the street near the police tape and realized two things: for the last several minutes he’d been thinking critically, analytically, trying to solve an important problem, rather than focusing exclusively on his own misery and survival; and two, he didn’t see Magnus or the transport anywhere.
Magnus was unimpressed. “It’s just a psychosomatic pain,” he dismissed, which Bay had heard before. Not sure what the point of that diagnosis was, though—it wasn’t like anyone sent slaves to therapy to get over these things. “You limp when you walk but forget about it when you’re daydreaming, or otherwise distracted.”
“Perhaps we ought to go to the country instead,” Bay suggested flatly, making Magnus glance up at him suddenly.
The back door opened again and Aquamarine crawled out onto the deck. Mrs. Watson stepped away from him as he approached John’s chair and knelt up. He was wearing dark jeans—rather tight—a button-down shirt that wouldn’t stay tucked in, and a green argyle sweater vest. Since John had only ever seen him in loose, casual clothes, the change was sexier than he would have imagined. “Don’t you look sharp,” he complimented with a grin. He avoided groping Aquamarine in deference to his mother’s presence, even though he quite wanted to.
There was a knock on the door. “Bay, are you alright?” He couldn’t catch his breath to answer, and Magnus slid the door open a couple inches, to see Bay’s hands braced against the wall as the treacherous, glorious water stripped the grime from him. “You’re making noise.”
“That’s brilliant.” Bay was slightly startled to realize
“You’re new,” Donovan went on speculatively, and it would be rather unwise for a slave to ignore her and keep walking, especially when he didn’t know whose side his master would take. So Bay turned back to her.
In response Ivan reached forward boldly and grabbed him—not the recommended approach in a knife fight, granted, which was why it was so effective. In an instant he had the boy’s back pressed firmly against his chest, one arm holding both of his in place, the other tight across his hips. It was an intimate position and he could practically feel Nico realizing he’d gone from bad to worse. He struggled furiously.
“Oh, sorry.”
John noticed his unnatural silence and sought to cheer him up, however undeserved. “Think of all the reading you’re getting done,” he suggested. “And the experiments!”
“Bay, stop talking drivel,” Magnus commanded, which was ironic from Bay’s point of view.
money, if Bay had been in any doubt before. Money did not impress him, though—it just meant certain things were predictable, and others not.
“Must keep an eye on the local excitement,” Mr. Holmes replied, feigning boredom. “Especially when it involves a citizen.” He said the last word like it was particularly significant.
“And I really appreciated that,” Bilbo promised, but not with enough sincerity, apparently.
Aquamarine took a sip of coffee first. “Aquamarine,” he pronounced slowly.
Magnus put his mobile in his pocket. Oh, serious now. He approached Bay cautiously, as one would a wounded animal. Did he think, for a moment, that Bay might be dangerous, unpredictable, perhaps not entirely sane? Good. Let
“There wasn’t a case,” Lestrade repeated. “There was never any suitcase.”
” Then he clapped his hands in glee, obviously seeing something in his mind far different from everyone else.
Aquamarine was not opposed to this positive assessment. “Molly. Butter,” he requested, indicating the bowl in the middle of the table. John rolled his eyes, fearing Molly might swoon, and passed him the butter himself. Aquamarine gave him a little smirk that said he didn’t think John was totally immune to him either.
“Big,” Aquamarine finally said. He seemed quite troubled by this, but John had to admit he didn’t get it.
Aquamarine had rather long legs and was not always careful with them; one flailing foot came a little too close for comfort to John and he decided he had to intervene. “Enough playing,” he told Aquamarine evenly, grabbing his leg. Molly quickly retreated to a safe distance as John pinned the leg against the back of the chair and gave the slave a steady look. “Aquamarine, you have to wear shoes if you want to walk around and see the modern world.” Irene seized the opportunity to shove a Doc Marten onto the trapped foot, and Aquamarine whined. “I’m sure it will be uncomfortable at first,” John acknowledged. “If you don’t want to wear the shoes, you’ll have to crawl around inside all day like a little savage, because the people who get to go out are the ones who can walk in
“No, very thoughtful,” Bilbo agreed mildly.
Carefully, as though humoring a crazy person—which was rather ironic—Magnus took Bay’s hand and rubbed it gently. “Darling, I think it would be better to stay focused on her phone,” he suggested, with such obvious restraint that Bay couldn’t help a quick smirk. Right, Magnus already knew who’d killed her, of course—so he said—and it was the same person who’d killed the others, and not a coincidence or a copycat.
“Warriors, and musicians,” Ivan claimed. “Sometimes both in the same person. Music is important on long marches.”
Bilbo reminded himself that he was lucky to be alive and relatively well-treated, and he shouldn’t antagonize his creator. “Right, that sounds lovely,” he responded, putting some sincerity into it. “I wanted to do some laundry today, also.”
"You deserve a person who doesn't question his love for you. " explained the blond man.  "You deserve someone who loves you completely and will never doubt you. You deserve better than me."
Sherlock's mouth moved towards his crotch, taking care to kiss the doctor's calf, patella, and inner thigh to... Once he got close to the base of the erection, he started this winding path again on the other leg. John's head fell backwards as he trembled in anticipation of his former roommate's way of foreplay. Oh, he wasn't complaining, but his patience was -
"And?" insisted the detective.
The blond didn't know exactly why he asked that question. It had flown by itself, and he couldn't hold it back.
When John loosened the grip of his mouth on his fingers, Sherlock resumed his caresses on the doctor's erection. One of Sherlock's fingers, now carefully lubricated by the blond man, returned to caress the nervous little hole. The detective stopped to assess his lover's reaction and began to penetrate him in this way - when he got his consent. John's mind, fogged by desire and alcohol, didn't even pay attention to the pain caused by the intrusion. He quickly nodded his head to encourage Sherlock to continue his exploration of that portion of the anatomy.
Or, perhaps it was Lestrade? Or was it Mycroft? No. Sherlock wanted to rip out his vocal cords - with a filial, hidden tenderness, no doubt - from his brother every time they spoke to each other. It couldn't have been what he'd mentioned to him. Or... Moriarty? He wouldn't have dared, would he?
The doctor tried to suppress a burst of laughter at the detective's reaction. He had raised his arms, shaking them, with a stubborn sigh, and scowled in the hollow of his armchair.
"I told you, I'm not leaving the flat for work. I'll review what you have an offer an opinion but I need time with my family."
"Wait, you told him?" Greg asked Mycroft with wide eyes and a blush on his cheeks. At the glare Mycroft gave him, he realized that Sherlock had deduced it and he'd just confirmed it. "Oh, Sorry." He mumbled.
"I'm not brooding Hamish. Really, what has gotten into you?" He looked down at him with a furrowed brow.
"Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson called coming up the stairs.
"Erm, thought I saw spider," He lied and turned pink. It was an incredibly stupid lie considering they all knew he wasn't afraid of the creatures at all. Greg looked at him with slight disbelief before turning back to look at Mycroft.
"Sherlock," Victor said in a pleading voice, his eyes meeting Sherlock's. "You're drunk with power. If you're going to be in control you must be fair about this." He said firmly and Sherlock gave him a smirk.
. Sherlock deserved so much more than an ordinary wounded soldier but he wanted John. John's hand slid up into Sherlock's hair massaging his scalp gently as he deepened their embrace, trying desperately to allow their contact to reassure him. Sherlock smiled softly closing his eyes and committing this moment into permanence in his mind palace. He never wanted to forget
"Papa! No food fights!" Hamish pouted but only because he wanted to fight too.
"I love you too," he said right after John no matter how many times he said it. He started to giggle when it became clear that John was sort of stuck in that admission. "I love you too." Sherlock honestly did love John more than words could explain. He loved John so much because he made him feel important just by holding him tightly and saying so. If anyone else had done this, he wouldn't believe them but he believed John. "I love you too," he said with a giggle for what had to be the twentieth time now and he gave John a curious look. John stopped, realizing he was sort of stuck in a loop and just let silence fall around them for awhile. He just held Sherlock to him, listening to his breathing and his heartbeat and feeling him in his arms. He didn't know what else to do or say right now, he was completely at a loss. His mind raced from here to there, trying to find the perfect thing to say. The perfect words to speak his mind, but nothing came. He pressed a soft kiss against Sherlock's mouth, his eyes searching Sherlock's as they broke apart. Sherlock was utterly comfortable like this. Even though they weren't speaking he was at peace. They didn't have to talk. They could simply look at each other. Just like they were now and feel like they were the only two in the world. He brought a hand up to John's hair and played with it mindlessly, it was always so soft. "Do you want to watch telly or something?" He asked John with a shy smile. "That is what couples do, correct? Sit on the couch and watch crap telly?"
date." Mycroft corrected him, slightly flushed. Sherlock looked slightly confused. "You two go out to dinner rather frequently, just so you can both be sure the other eats. You have given him your jacket four times during cases because he had forgotten his own. You left him..." John was very red and coughed slightly.
but he wanted to desperately give John his ten smacks.
"After it gets dark? You make it sound like I'm texting for a shag." He giggled; he honestly did feel more relaxed now. He didn't feel any weariness about anything for the moment. Talking about it really did help. He should have known it would. It always did but he somehow forgot every time. "But, if you must know I was talking about you. How you were acting at dinner was worrying me and I was talking to him about it."
"Like shit," Surprisingly that answer came easily from Sherlock who was curled up in his chair. He was getting the damn flu. He was trying so hard to fight it but he knew he was getting it. He curled up tightly in chair his eyes shut tight as he held his stomach tightly. To make everything worse, his throat was already starting to feel a tad sore. "B-But I'll be fine."
"Oh come off it, Mycroft. We used to do it all the time." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. Hamish was giggling and running circles under his legs. "'Mish stop it." Sherlock scolded and Hamish stopped but pouted. "Go get the blankets and the sheets from the closet." Hamish grabbed Marius' hand and pulled him along with him as they went to get them. Sherlock organized the chairs and was surprised when Mycroft helped him.
Sherlock shut his eyes for a moment before turning and trying to look at John properly. He was for the first time since relapsing, actually upset he could not deduce what John was thinking. He could tell that his blogger was furious. He read that much even with his drug addled brain only at basic functionality. However when John demanded his answer he swallowed hard, John couldn't possibly know he'd just taken something. Maybe he knew he was using again but there was no way he could know about the stash of drugs now hiding under the bed. He'd thrown it before John had entered, his brain didn't consider that the amount of noise the drugs had made as the wooden box slipped under the bed would give him away. No, John knew he was using but didnt know about his most recent fix. He considered just telling him the truth, finding it odd that the desire to do so just rolled easily through him. He mulled it over for a long moment before deciding that wouldn't end well. John would just get more angry and maybe leave. That would be the worst. If John left... So Sherlock decided it would be better to lie and make him think he was fine. Perfectly fine. Which wasn't really a lie, he felt fine. Or he had until John had come home.
"We'll get there faster in my car. Shall I drive?” He asked tentatively and Sherlock simply nodded. His mind was already too focused to speak. He got in the car, rushed Greg in, and then immediately started sorting through details in his head while they were driving.
"Sherlock, he didn't mean to." John whispered, as when he saw Hamish start to cry, he rubbed his back in soothing circles. "I know he needs to be more careful but he didn't mean to hurt you." He whispered to Sherlock, and it was obvious he was just a tad annoyed.Marius considered sleeping in the fort with Hamish for moment, and then he pouted. He moved into Mycroft's arms and hugged him tightly.
"I will be. I'll be fine. And as long as you stay out for a little while it will all be fine. I promise to explain as soon as it's all over." He kissed John as hard as he could, holding onto him tightly. "Thank you, for trusting me. I swear it's all going to be fine."
"I don't deserve your help, John. Therefore I believe I'll keep how I am feeling to myself, thank you." He snapped, but John was having none of it. John moved quickly and expertly, eliciting a groan from Sherlock as he gently forced the pillows underneath him. Sherlock’s stomach turning and his head giving several painful throbs at the sudden movement. "Just stop, John, stop." He pleaded, his voice annoyed and desperate at the same time. He didn’t want John to stop but he knew logically that John should. John should stomp upstairs, fling all of his items in a suitcase whilst cursing at him, and storm out. But he wasn’t. He turned his eyes up to look over John as he spoke.
Sherlock finally stops talking and oozes off House’s desk.
Directly across from Mycroft, Greg is seated beside Mrs. Hudson on another couch. Next to Greg is a tall lamp offering its soft white glow to the muted atmosphere.
There’s so much building between them, many things they’ve said and have yet to say but neither can force himself just to relax and trust he isn’t going to be rejected by the other even now. It is a wonderful thing, this, and if the emphatic joy that waltzes up and down the Link they have created could be made into light and colorized—they would light up the entire street with golds and silvers, perhaps the whole block or even the entire city. Or even the very zenith wrapping about the Earth…
“Gosh, it’s cold in here and that’s saying something because this is a morgue,” she mutters nervously. No one answers her, so she skitters in between them all and towards her office. She counts to ten before Mike joins her.
“Let me see that,” John orders, standing up and moving behind the bench to get a better look—or as best he can in the almost-darkness.
Instead of parsing out some sage advice, though, John giggles lightly and says without preamble: “You’re toast.”
for their place in it. Seems like he’s managed to hook the baby of the family.
They leave together and John turns to make his way to the Tube, though Sherlock redirects him towards a waiting taxi with a hand on his shoulder. He takes note of a distinct feeling of loss when that hand is taken away as he slides across the back seat to make room for Sherlock’s legs.
“Yes,” John answers at the same time Sherlock says, “Well…”
Mycroft Holmes raises a single perfectly-plucked (Sherlock thinks they are also
Sherlock nods, fingers tightening briefly against John’s. “It was a physical manifestation of your instinct to protect.”
Sherlock doesn’t look up again, even to see if his line of utter shite has had any effect; for that small mercy John is grateful, because he’s watching as the detective’s finger traces down the page and back up to the top. He tries to convince himself that Sherlock absolutely does not look delectable with his legs folded and his head bowed, an icon of genius and curiosity.
Beside him, Sherlock is quaking with suppressed laughter. “Shhh!” John whispers, patting his thigh. After a second, he stops patting and rubs lightly with his fingertips. Sherlock inhales deeply.
(Did I mention that the desk is
Martin shakes it, amazed at the soft strength of Arthur’s big hand. “I guess I am,” he tells him.
“Mr. Holmes,” is spoken by a cool, masculine voice, someone who is accustomed to issuing orders and having them followed without question.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No, not sex, sex is stupid, Victor.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “Take him with you.” He and Sherrinford turn away from them.
John cracks his eyes to see the bottle Sherlock’s holding out to him, it’s his shampoo. “Alright,” John agrees then proceeds to make quick work of washing his hair. He rinses just as the curtain is pulled back and Sherlock steps out. He completes the job and turns off the tap, taking the offered towel with a smile. He’s not quite dried off when Sherlock grabs him by the hips and hauls him into. The taller man bends down and takes a loud, dramatic sniff of John’s hair.
John nods, his mouth too full to politely agree.
: John Sends, cupping Sherlock’s face in order to angle it upward, fingers tangling in the ebony curls on the nape of his neck.
“I don’t think John is going to forgive me this time.” Sherlock mutters to his feet, looking for all the world like a shy, gangly teenager about to faint from nerves.
I nod, but I still don’t really feel it. “Thank you,” I mumble as Nova sits up and blinks her ridiculous eyes at me.
“Sherlock, I don’t know what you’re thinking, but stop eyeing the walls.” John’s voice is a bit stronger now, less gruff and closer to his usual warm tenor.
More applause. John Watson rolls over on the couch, curling up and tucking his face against the back cushions. On the television, Doctor Stamford is still talking.
“Which Holmes?” He asks, ignored when Barkley talks over him. For some reason, that little detail seems important at the moment.
John Receives Desire and Need and returns it along with Want and Affection. He leans down to begin placing a trail of petal soft kisses from the base of Sherlock’s neck down his spine. Beneath him, the detective hums and purrs contentedly. Kneading one well-formed buttock with the palm of his hand, John moves upward again in order to gently grasp the skin on Sherlock’s nape in his teeth. He worries it a bit then sucks and finally laves the little red mark with his tongue.
No one says anything, so the man takes it to mean he should continue. “The body is not one of our pilots because all of the pilots we had signed up for Sunday were men. In fact, this body is not a ‘he’ at all, it is that of an unknown woman.”
“John.”
Mycroft raises his eyebrow at the reference. “Consider them safely out of the general population.” He says with such steel in his voice that the statement brooks no further questioning.
I am so sorry this is taking so long to update and for this short chapter. I'm not at home because we've not had power in several days. Hoping to pass 'code' tomorrow and be able to go home. Please don't think for a second this work is abandoned, I'm still writing it out by hand in a notebook. Thank you all for staying with me!
“Well?” Sherlock leads.
Now it is Sherlock’s turn to frown. “Why aren’t you getting your pet psychics in on this one?”
“Yeah, I bet you do,” Victor raises a white-gold eyebrow, “I can imagine what you look like under those clothes.” He indicates Sherlock’s jeans with a jab of his chin.
“Good night, John,” Sherlock half-mutters as he pulls the antique tome from the coffee table.
These are the flags in the mental picture Sherlock Sends to John. It may be a clue to the next part of the story!
doing here?” Lestrade queries from across the room where he’s at the coffee machine making a fresh cup.
The mattress vibrates beneath John’s back. He reaches out to pull Sherlock closer, so that they wind up with Sherlock’s head on his bare chest. Sophie sees the cuddle and decides she wants in on it, so she gives one last hop and lands squarely on Sherlock’s back.
Victor reaches into the pocket of his long coat and produces a large wad of cash which he lays down in the center of the table between them. The gold money clip binding it all together glints in the low light of the dining room. John frowns, Sherlock ignores it.
John’s tumultuous thoughts are brought to a halt when Sherlock suddenly goes very, very still and very, very quiet. His green eyes are almost black, his expression slack but filled with a fear unlike anything John recognizes. His normally pale skin is the cyan pallor of death in the faint light from outside the window yet one single drop of sweat makes its way from his hairline, down the side of his face and John can’t stand it another second, he reaches out and catches it on the tip of his index finger.
story depending on how I feel when I actually tell this story, right?
Look, I’ll be right back, okay? Just need to use the loo. Be a love and move that chair for me? Thank you. Ugh. Could you just tie that boot lace for me, too, please? Sorry, I just can’t reach it right now. Alright, I’ll be right back.
Martin beams and blushes at the same time. Mrs. Hudson hands out menus from the stack on the center of the table and they all make their choices. The waitress who takes them smiles and even goes so far as to give Martin a little wink as she goes to turn in their orders.
to tell him, but the naturally inquisitive part really, really wants to know; since he can’t speak as a cat, he chooses to remain silent. As much as this is going to hurt, he knows John needs it. It’s the only way they are going to be able to move forward.
“Take cover!” Someone shouts.
He lets his sentence fade because there’s no real way to tell if something is really wrong or if it’s just his overactive imagination inventing problems.
They don’t exactly jump away from each other, though they do turn their heads towards the irritating sound. Victor Trevor is stretched out on the sofa, legs propped up on the arm and watching them with an avid glint in his eye that puts John instantly on the alert.
John momentarily forgot the question, abruptly distracted by a movement in front of him. Sherlock thoughtfully nibbled at the skin of his index finger.
Sherlock's head bent down to come and lay butterfly kisses on his lover's cheeks, nose, forehead and lips. John was overwhelmed by this. He would never have thought Sherlock Holmes could be so sweet in this way.
Sherlock's eyes seemed to become deliciously wild with each passing second.
"What? The King's a woman?"
The sudden absence of the detective near him felt like an icy bite on his skin. John straightened up to see Sherlock search in an agitated manner for the pants that lay on the floor further down. He moistened his lips as he watched the strange creature that was his former roommate – and realized that he was still dressed. John, naked, straightened up and walked towards him as the detective had just put his hand on the wallet. Without warning, John's hands slipped the detective's silk shirt over his arms and back, while kissing his back.
However, where Mary was a gentle warmth that embraced him, Sherlock was a forest fire that razed everything. His whole life had changed since he'd known the detective. He had helped him get over his return from the war. Then, when he came back, after two years away, he had pulverized his life again. Sherlock was a hurricane that shaped his life as he wanted it to be and John let him, because he liked the way his life was turning with his best friend. The colours were brighter, the air was fresher, he felt more alive with him.
, not a king!"
Was it possible to make these two people coincide in his existence? He had thought so. He had sincerely thought it might be. Until his stag night.
The doctor spread his legs while the detective's fingers began to caress around and inside the hole in the former soldier's body to prepare him properly. After a few seconds, John's panting and grunting resumed - and Sherlock's accompanied him as his erection stroked the doctor's - the detective penetrated him.
"Damn it, Sherlock..."
"No, no, no, no, nooooo." refuted the doctor by overstretching the syllable of the word. The finger brandished to add impact. "You missed. Now it's my turn. That's it."
"John..."
"Sherlock!" he moaned, as his whole body buckled and his mind lost touch with reality for good.
. John – the one who kept saying he wasn't gay – was kissing him. With enough ardour that he could believe that it was not accidental.
"Give me your fingers. "ordered John, in a hurry. Sherlock's eyebrows frowned, interrogator. "Come on, give them to me."
"Where?"
Sherlock's long legs wrapped around him to take away the potential and incongruous idea of leaving him.
The clergyman coughed impatiently, but the couple didn't care. John nodded, slowly. The subject of their conversation, behind the doctor, seemed for the first time in his life terribly uncomfortable.
Sherlock's long legs stretched out in front of him and became entangled with those of his opposite number. He tried to make beady dog eyes – the kind they made whenever John tried, when they lived together, to refuse to do any chores, crazy or normal, for him. The doctor couldn't remember ever resisting that adorable look.
John's hands were busy unbuttoning his shirt as kisses rained down the detective's long neck. Sherlock moaned, which usually would have made him blush with shame if his thoughts hadn't been all focused on John. His body trembled as the doctor's teeth chewed the flesh from the back of his neck. Suddenly, the detective wished that John's incisors would create a work of art on his skin, that they would imprint themselves on his epidermis like a fleeting memory.
"My heart has been yours for a long time. For so long, so long." said John, more confident. "I give it to you. It's yours."
John felt as if he had died and been reborn at the same time.
The doctor instantly noticed the impatience in his voice. It was such a familiar tone that often preceded an insult or criticism of his intelligence.
The doctor had to run after Sherlock to catch up with him in Church ministry before he ran away. He had managed to stop him by putting his hand on the inside of his elbow and pulling him to face him. The tone of the detective's voice was anxious. A flake of emotion was coming into John's eyes without him being able to identify at least one of them, so intrinsically linked, together, did they seem.
"But, no..." The doctor was having trouble getting serious enough to articulate anything. "She's a
When Sherlock's warm mouth began to resume his blowjob, the blond man suddenly pushed him away.
At this mere thought, the detective's legs tightened on his prey, possessively. John, who hadn't realized this new state of mind, associated this movement with an additional physiological response to his kisses, bites and caresses. He dipped his fingers into the dark tide of the detective's hair, while his mouth resumed a deeper exploration of Sherlock's pecs.
The doctor did not have the reflex to question himself on the reasons that led him to find this common and
The medical assistant watched him with tears in her eyes. The woman was beautiful, really. Oh, my God! He wished he could have loved her to the fullest. He wished he could have loved her as she deserved. She was remarkable, radiant. But still... Still, it wasn't enough for him. He couldn't do that. He couldn't commit to that marriage.
"John Hamish Watson, do you take Mary Morstan to be your lawful wedded wife?" said the clergyman, palms raised to the cathedral ceiling of the place of worship. "Do you promise to love and cherish her for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, and vow loyalty till death do you part?"
Anyway, it already belonged to him.
Their knees came into contact with the ground, as John tore the aluminum casing of the condom. He gestured to see who would put it on, knowing full well that it would be Sherlock who penetrated him - the very idea caused a delicious knot in his lower abdomen in anticipation of the sensation. It was all the more appropriate in view of the foreplay that had taken place. As he expected, the detective grabbed the condom and unrolled it over his penis.
The detective had grumbled that playing this stupid game would be his ultimate wedding present. The doctor had laughed out loud at the sentence, and Sherlock's mind seemed not to be conscious enough to reflect on the disconcerting but cute sound his friend had made.
John had quickly catalogued his clothes on the floor, carefully avoiding looking at the worn condom lying at the bottom of the bag in the living room garbage. He had dressed hastily and left the scene of the crime - his crime of adultery. He had meticulously avoided Sherlock's sleepy, wounded look.
"What happened, John?"
His mind was struggling to remember the last time she was offered a blowjob too...
Sherlock turned around as soon as the shirt fell on the floor. The anticipation of what they were about to do brought a new urgency to the kiss. Both men's breathing was painfully chopped up as John's fingers anxiously unbuttoned the detective's pants - making the simple task more difficult. When he succeeded, he pulled down the pants and underpants at the same time at the detective's feet, and Sherlock gestures with his feet to get rid of them. Their two erections came into contact for the first time, which brought a new concert of moaning.
His fiancée's coughing suddenly brought his mind back to the present moment.
. The detective's tongue had just licked the entire length of his penis to take it in his mouth, immediately. John's hands searched his brown curls, clinging to them, as he repeated the detective's name in a disorderly and strangled manner, giving him a few hints, on occasion.
That was so good.
His stag night had been a disaster. A spectacular slip-up – if you had to call it like that.
"It was obvious... " sighed the medical assistant. "I knew it the moment he came back. I thought... I thought, maybe... At first..." Her hand went to caress John's cheek tenderly. "I am honoured to have been able to make you happy, John Watson." She took his hands in hers and brought them to his lips... "I know how to admit defeat in the face of a lost cause."
"Okay... am I smart?"
Sherlock's gaze lingered for a few seconds - more than necessary - at the sight of this rough draft of an authoritative John. He would have been unable to provide a rational explanation as to why this type of gesture, which he categorized as the remnants of the Captain Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, gave him a sudden urge to obey his former roommate. When he used this more imperative tone of voice, the detective wanted to explore how far the doctor could order him.
In addition, John had expressly forbidden him to choose an element from the periodic table. Or anything that came anywhere close – near or far – to science.
"And then they say the English are not feminists."
"Why?" the detective continued, stubbornly.
It was Sherlock's turn to explore.
"I've often thought of you. Just like that, I mean. I've... Caressed myself, often, thinking it was you... You have no idea how much... The last two years have been hell... " Sherlock's hands came to frame the doctor's face. He touched it and looked at it as if he had an infinitely precious stone in his hands."At least I used to be able to see you, but... You weren't there. It was intole -- "
The ex-military man looked at him incomprehensibly. Having already forgotten his own question, he had no idea what Sherlock was talking about.
"All right... " the brown-haired man obeyed, with a sigh.
"Are you sure?" asked the detective, as one of his thumbs drew circles near his balls.
However, John wasn't leaving. John was everywhere. He lived, already, in an - unspeakable - majority of Sherlock's thoughts. At that moment, with his body against his own, there was no room for anything else. Sherlock's foggy mind desperately tried to saturate his mind with him, with them, in anticipation of the inevitable moment when he would return to Mary.
His best friend's features seemed to calm down immediately. As if he were a child and someone had just brought him a cuddly toy or a teddy bear. Words that no one but his parents had ever said to him before in his life. Words that had never meant anything to him, but that hummed to his soul when they were spoken in John's voice. His John.
"Well, now it's my turn." said John, putting his hands on the armrest of his seat.
"Wallet. Back pocket of my pants."
for Sherlock that he had assumed at the time was exhaustion or adrenaline.
The doctor had climbed onto his lap, crushing him in his chair. His fingers detailed every millimetre of the skin on the detective's face. Sherlock shivered – shivered, jolted – at the touch as he tried to find a rational justification for this sudden change.
Sherlock and John woke up completely naked, wrapped in a blanket on the floor.
This idea created a knot in his belly and he tried to hide his adoring smile under one of his hands. He coughed, as John's seriousness disappeared and a new burst of laughter followed.He hadn't noticed Sherlock's trouble - thank God.
The doctor would have preferred to throw himself, unarmed, into a fight in Afghanistan rather than hear Sherlock tell him that his feelings weren't mutual or say goodbye.
Was that flickering was his voice? He barely recognized it.
And on the other hand, there was the fear that the detective wouldn't want that. It wasn't just fear, it was a real phobia.
Despite his acquiescence, he displayed a sulky air. Then he moved his body forward and put his head inside his palms while his elbows perched on the top of his kneecaps. His knees frequently collided with those of his former roommate. His position was a precarious balance and she was bringing out the childlike features on the detective's face.
Enough waiting. Both men nodded, as John dropped to the floor on his back. Sherlock nervously sought guidance - or his agreement, he didn't know exactly. This was all new to both of them.
"Wait, wait..." Sherlock implored, as John burst out laughing beneath his pitiful face. "One more try!"
The doctor's patience was at its peak. After Sherlock's treatment, he could feel his nerves on edge.
The closer he got to his wedding, the more torn he felt.
Sherlock loved how his heart was almost tachycardia in the face of this new set of sensations. He loved how John's fingers in his scalp formed a weak resistance when the detective tried to move his head back to meticulously kiss the jaw bone or the skin of the doctor's neck.
"All right," agreed John, crashing into his own chair.
The blond man seemed to make sure that not a single centimeter of the detective's milky skin was marked by his passage. He felt that John, like the explorers, wanted to plant a flag to make the discovery of his body official - and Sherlock, my God, was more than willing to let him. The doctor could do whatever he wanted with him, as long as it wasn't to abandon him.
Sherlock squinted to decipher his handwriting on the piece of paper stuck to the former soldier's forehead. Mado –
Sherlock's instincts kicked in when John's irresistible mouth went south on his body. His fingers grasped blonde locks to straighten John's head to capture his lips in a feverish, hungry kiss. His lips cuddled, titillated every corner of that mouth he had watched so long since he had known him. The detective's hands migrated to the former soldier's hips and he lifted him up to sit him in his chair. This time, his slender silhouette overhung John's smaller body, without breaking the embrace of his mouth over his own.
The Priest was looking at him both angry and worried. Their friends and families were becoming restless. John opened his mouth, then closed it again. His stomach hurt.
Without further ado, the detective sealed that agreement, that promise, with a frantic kiss.
The detective's eyes widened at this new information.
It seemed so obvious to him now. At least out of respect for the woman who had saved him from himself.
Mary's hand let go of his and she quickly wiped away the tears that were tearing her cheekbones.
"No. I feel tired so maybe I can fall asleep before the pain sets in." Sherlock replied quietly sounding hopeful. He really did want to sleep. He feared he wouldn't be able to though. Whenever he was coming down sleeping was next to impossible, but maybe... Maybe with John here...
"Sher..." John mumbled, half jolting awake. It was clear he'd been sort of having a nightmare again. He blinked a bit confused. "When did we come in here?" John looked at Sherlock from the bed clutching the shirt around him like a blanket. He shivered violently. "We need to give you your medicine." He mumbled and tried to stand.
"I'm starving but I feel like I going to vomit." Victor answered sadly. "Which doesn't make any sense considering I haven't eaten in three days."
"The number of times I almost..." John shook his head; they'd discussed this all already. They'd talked about how much he wanted to end himself because he'd missed Sherlock, but it truly had been so many times. "It's still worrying to me. I still feel like I am nothing... I'm still going to feel it. Even if I know the truth. I'm sorry it's stupid and childish of me to act like this. But it's hard. I love you and if I ever lose you I won't even think twice about walking out of this life. You are my world and you have been for so long... I love you."
No one besides John seems to understand Sherlock's sympathy for Victor. Why must their be a real reason for helping him? Isn't being his friend enough? He used to be a good person and Sherlock was determined he could be that person again.
"Of course he is. Why are you so shocked? Mycroft says your rather romantic with John." Sherlock scoffed.
"Don't be ridiculous." He snapped and strode over to open the door.
"What is your favorite dish here?" Mycroft asked Greg directly. He smiled.
"My kits still here in the living room, in the top is an oral thermometer." He motioned, not entirely thrilled to hear that he might have a fever. "Damn it, if I have the flu after getting the flu shot..."
"Of course I remember." Sherlock assured him. "It was wonderful, I never said we didn't have good times." He tried to pull away from Victor but found Victor's grip was a bit stronger than he thought.
"Jesus Christ..." Victor grunted softly, exhaling a breath he didn't know he'd been holding. "Alex... You'd better stop..." Victor said in a shaking voice. "I don't want to have to fight Sherlock..." He tried to laugh but twitched a bit nervously.
"Honestly, Greg. I'm not upset with you. It's Sherlock. You'll need to apologize to him, not me." John said simply as he stepped into the living room, his eyes went wide once he saw Mycroft helping with the fort.
stop them this time." His voice only got darker and Greg sighed, it made him uncomfortable. Hearing Sherlock admit he was wrong made him uncomfortable to begin with, but now here it was Sherlock was apologizing and taking all of the guilt on himself. It wasn’t a promising start to this journey.
"They have the perfect height tree just in the back. She is going to get it and show it to us." Hamish giggled. Sherlock raised his eyebrows, giving off his best surprised face,
"Wuv you too." Hamish said sleepily.
"J-John, he'll force me." He whispered, shutting his eyes tight. "He keeps a gun on him, he'll use it. He knows how to get to me, John. It wouldn't be like if any stranger cornered me. He knows how to manipulate me."  He could already picture it happening in his mind. "I...I don't want to." He almost whimpered suddenly wrapping his arms around John and clinging to him, reminding himself that John was and would always be his anchor. John wrapped him in his arms, pulling him so he could sit up and wrap himself completely around the shaking detective.
"It's the same style as Sherlock's phone, just the newest one. I bought you a blue case for it and some screen protectors." Mycroft said off handedly.
could Sherlock do this to him? Tears came more rapidly but John was completely disconnected from them. Almost as if he didn't even know they were falling. "After everything we have been through you're going to do this AND you're going to have the audacity to lie to me about it?!" He was torn between a fit of violence and a panic attack, his chest heaving rapidly as he clenched and unclenched his fists. He wanted to both shake Sherlock and to run away. "You selfish son of a bitch." John didn't check his words. He was far too angry and hurt to mind what he said. He moved over and grabbed Sherlock again, by the front of his shirt - shaking him slightly as if that would somehow snap him out of this. Sherlock's eyes met John's and his breath was sucked out of his chest by the host of emotion swirling around in the soldier's normally calm gaze. "What the
Sherlock jumped up and started pacing the entire length of the living room, spinning his room the entire time. His hands shaking as he tapped his phone against his leg. His mind was racing ten thousand miles a minute. He walked over and wrenched open the case file immediately focusing his mind on it. His attention narrowing quickly, his let out a huff of breath. Why? Why hadn't Greg told him it was
As John watched his son comfort Marius tears came to his eyes. He had no idea Hamish could be such an amazing comfort to another child. If they had another child he would be the best older brother in the world. He was so caring and sweet. John, fearing some more tears were about to come out, wrapped an arm around Sherlock and hid his face in his shoulder. A few tears had fallen from Marius eyes, but he tried to be big boy and wipe them away on John's long jumper sleeve. After he was done, he took a shaking breath and nodded slowly as he took the star gently. He gave Hamish a careful hug.
Mycroft/John - HollyGlow
"Sherlock, you really didn't have to do that." Greg said slowly, the frown still on his face. He was actually quite surprised but he didn't want to admit it. "I mean, I'm very grateful but I'm sure Mycroft and I could have done that. You didn't have to." He assured him and looked down because Marius had finally started to stir again.
"I won't..." He whispered softly but sleep was too close. His body giving in to his utter exhaustion as the relief spread through him. It drew him into the comfort of their embrace, Sherlock's warmth lulling him to sleep. He was warm to the touch, despite his shivering. Sherlock's face tight with worry as he surveyed every detail about John in their little blanket bubble. He mumbled something trying to wake himself, which Sherlock realized was because he needed an injection but John couldn't fight the wave of exhaustion. His hand clenched around Sherlock's shirt, like a child would just holding him close. He coughed again, harder than before but didn't fully wake.
"I think we were behaving like grownups, that's the part you don't like brother." Sherlock teased as he looked into the kitchen to see it still in the same state as they had left it. Greg was gingerly moving around as he made tea, carefully avoiding touching the table.
"Oh trust me, I noticed. You have some balls showing up to Buckingham Palace with nothing on but a sheet. But then again you are Sherlock Holmes." He smiled and led Sherlock out of the bathroom and helping him into bed. "I'm going to go get the blanket and make some tea. Do you need anything?" He knelt down and retrieved Sherlock's bags and used needles from under the bed, his face relatively blank as he did so. He could be strong Sherlock was trusting him so for now he'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
"You could be with us..." Hamish forced out, trying to stop his tears and Victor smiled sadly.
. He couldn't say the word, but it ate away at him. He was trying to stop these tears, they made him angry. He wasn't supposed to get attached like this... But he couldn't help the guilt. He should have caught the murderers after Hamish's parents had been killed. He felt like he was being punished for trying to be normal. His entire body shook with tears, guilt, and the sudden withdrawal of adrenaline. His mind and body forced to reconnect because the danger was long gone and he was back in his safe zone. He was broken and lost. He didn't know what to think or feel. John tried to lift his chin but he refused to meet John's eyes.
"I can't say I feel exactly like that but I do understand what you're saying. When I wake up in the morning... I just have this ache in my chest that when I open my eyes that you won't be there. And I don't mean that in terrible way, I just mean out on a case. It's happened so many times and at first it didn't bother me but now it's become a fear." He swallowed hard, trying to ignore the ache and tightening in his chest. "I hate waking up alone. I think Hamish knows it too because whenever you're not here, somehow he ends up in our bed. I think he hears you leave so he runs down here to keep me company." He sucked in a breath, trying to swallow the sob. "When you're not here I feel like... It's those three years all over again. Maybe I have just grown too attached to you but even if we're apart for just a few hours, I start getting the same ache in my chest. But I force myself to push the ache down because if I don't I won't be able to take care of Hamish and I won't be able to take care of you. It's all so overwhelming but I would never trade it for anything because you two are the loves of my life and I can't be without either of you."
"Well that didn't last long," He said with a giggle.
"I'll beg if I have to." Greg whispered, moving toward his ear and nibbling. "I can beg properly. On my knees, for you, if that's what it takes." He pulled away, a smirk on his lips. "But you may not want to hear me beg for you," He said with a dramatic sigh as he turned on his side, his back to Mycroft. "That could bore you," He said with another sigh but he was wearing a grin.
"Alright. But I promise. If he's any trouble we'll make him leave. But I honestly don't think he'll be that hard to deal with." Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and hugged him tightly. "I just want to give him a chance and I know you all think it's stupid of me, but I trust him."
"Oh hell," He sighed. "I bust people for drugs here all the time. Lots of us do. If he's not careful he's going to get himself arrested." Greg ran a hair through his hair, his heart sinking low. He had been afraid this was why Mycroft wa calling him. It was starting all over again. Images of Sherlock the last time he relapsed flashed in his mind and he sighed heavily. "Why would he relapse? I mean, what's so bloody awful that he felt the need to turn back to drugs? I thought he was happy." He set the file back down with a sigh. John looked more upset at the question and Greg immediately felt horrible for asking it out loud. He watched as John began to pace, his tells betraying his emotion. He clenched and unclenched his fist and if Greg wasn't mistaken he actually started to limp a bit as he walked. His heart sank again as he guessed that the boys still hadn't had 'the talk' yet. "It was damn near impossible to get him off the stuff last time, I can't even imagine how hard it's going to be this time." Greg wathed as John's mind turned in on itself, as John instantly began blaming himself as he sought a way to fix this for Sherlock. To make everything better for the detective without concern for his own self or wellbeing. Greg was certain that he ought to have a bit more faith in Sherlock, he had changed quite a bit, but the evidence in front of him was rather clear. The proof was there and no matter how much the three of them wanted to deny it, they couldn't. "He'll need to go to rehab again." He said firmly, meeting Mycroft's eyes.
John snorts and rolls his eyes beneath his palm. “Military kink,” he mutters.
As he negotiates the roads which are practically empty at this late hour going out of the city, Sherlock watches Ophelia fidget in the passenger seat. She keeps switching from gnawing on her already short fingernails to picking at the hems of her denim shorts. She’s wearing her favorite blue and white striped blouse and for a moment he finds himself wondering if he should get her a light jacket for the unpredictable British spring weather.
“Mummy…” Mycroft attempts to explain.
A sound not oft-heard rings out in the downstairs hallway of 221 Baker Street, London, UK.
“Well, yeah. You’re the best thing that ever happened to Sherlock, besides Sophie and there’s no way I’m going to be responsible for…”
Sherrinford shrugs. “Dunno, bet you didn’t know that I’ve worn off the treads of my boots in a lot of the same sand you’ve seen.”
. He may obfuscate, talk around something or omit things, but generally,
“That is what I intend to find out. I will contact you tomorrow.” With that, Sherlock moves across the kitchen in a graceful whirl, Ophelia close on his heels.
They follow a rather long hallway until it opens up into a cavernous room. There are lights hanging from the metal rafters; hoses and electric wires go in every direction like some weird techno spider web. In the center of the chaos is a giant aircraft, similar to one of the experimental planes in Sophie’s book. Its glossy black paint reflects the lights above it.
. Dammit. He’s cute. James and Sally look a little concerned and Lestrade has checked out for a few moments, but he
John Watson loves Sherlock Holmes, of that there can be no doubt. If the matching molecule tattoos on their hands don’t give it away, nor the soppy way John still looks at the detective, then you must be dead. Alright?
Martin grins up at the older man self-consciously as Douglas places the wine in front of him.
“He’s always done that?” John grins.
“Yes, I was…I was overseas. The Red Cross rushed me home, but it was already too late. The car crash…it was…just bad. Closed-casket funeral—her parents insisted. There had never been any love lost between myself and her folks, never.” Victor’s pale blue eyes are filled with pain and a regret he knows all soldiers feel at one time or another; some never get over that feeling.
“Which…”
She adjusts herself on his lap, gazing earnestly into his eyes.
He waits for the laughter to begin; instead he’s pleasantly surprised by a deep voice saying behind him, “It fits you.”
John smiles despite his irritation with the interruption. “They’re gone, then?” he asks.
Greg pulls himself away and all three men stare down at the woman who is out cold with a nasty grin on her face. Both detective-y persons stare at John who opens his mouth to explain.
He starts walking again, staying close to the buildings to his right. When he has to stop to cross traffic at a corner, Sherlock Answers him.
Martin squeaks as Greg’s eyebrows fly up to his hairline and John just about dumps his beverage in his lap, he’s laughing so hard.
(Not really.)(winky face)
Barely aware, Sherlock’s deep timbre breaks and cracks on a scream like a man in the throes of denial steeped in the darkness of long-held grief.
Captain steps in closer to the man who is gazing about the morgue with wide eyes and raises his hands as if to touch him. The man, who is almost eye to eye with the Captain flinches and drags his hands through his hair. The brown curls are damp with sweat and tight against his scalp.
Finally, his brain grabs hold of a long lost training film played for doctors caring for patients with PTSD and flashbacks. Very slowly, John moves out of what he thinks could be Sherlock’s swing range and simply starts talking.
Martin can feel his eyes widen in fear as the man pulls his fist back.
Sherlock regards John for a few heartbeats, then slowly takes the instrument from his shoulder and replaces it in its case. After that, he sort of runs out of steam.
Two nights later and it’s once again well after midnight. John is perched on the top step of a staircase leading up to an attic of yet another old house in the suburbs. He’s tired and about fed up with everything in general, but more specifically with this whole business. Maybe it’s time to find something else. Surely there’s a surgery out there that would hire him to sign off on absence slips or something. He stretches his legs and crosses them at the ankle, perturbed. Both Mike and Dale swore that there was activity here last night, so where are the spirits now?
“Sherlock, don’t. We’ve too much work to do.”
Martin knows he’s blushing and he feels like a complete idiot. “No,” Roderick and I were supposed to be on the East Coast by tonight and then home by the end of the week.
“I’m not going to last much longer…” John warns, meeting each of Sherlock’s thrusts with his own. The pool table only sways slightly.
John chuckles, allowing the tense mood to be broken. “Who are you, then? This doesn’t seem to be your regular…” he trails off, not wanting to use the word ‘haunt’ for fear of insulting her and making them all go away.
John isn’t sure where to go with that statement. “That’s amazing.”
to clean up as is normal after the men come to this room in the night. I can see things more clearly on these days when there is no pain so when I look at her face…but I pretend not to notice how tired she looks to me. She gives me a nod when I am done, says something to the other girl and leaves me alone with an old but clean nightgown and my small meal for later.
“Doctor Watson, we have been looking all over for you. They found Martin and apparently he’s going to be okay.”
Neither one of them pays any attention to who moves first, because once they meet in the middle, it makes no difference. John’s hand cups the back of Sherlock’s head, tilting his face to get the best angle to kiss him. It quickly becomes less of a kiss and more a stake to a claim.
Sherlock stares, only somewhat taken aback by John’s cheek. He waits until John actually begins reading, drops to all fours and proceeds to crawl towards the chair, only stopping after he’s half-limbo’ed under one of John’s legs in order to rest his chin on John’s thigh. His half-unbuttoned shirt catches on John’s jeans and pulls tighter across his chest.
“Why would that be?” John queries.
There are now three distinct entities sitting in the kitchen: in two of the chairs, a young boy and a girl, probably twins, seeming to be about ten years old, and another girl, much younger, seated cross-legged in the center of the table. She grins at John and waves at him as if greeting a long-lost favorite uncle. John blinks twice and wonders how long he’s been this close to these emanations without realizing it.
“That’s a lotus.” Sherlock states, probing the wet mass with his index finger then bringing it up closer to his face; John notes with no little irritation that Sherlock’s glasses have disappeared again.
“John, I do believe that my brothers and Mrs. Hudson are well aware of our particular set of activities when we are alone.” Sherlock grins roguishly and drops his shirt as if daring John to say anything.
“What?” Martin almost looks like he’s going to faint.
When Sherlock pads into the kitchen, he’s also changed into his ‘around the flat’ clothes, primarily consisting of flannel pajama bottoms and an old grey t-shirt that John is almost one hundred percent certain was in one of the few boxes he moved into Baker Street with. Sherlock’s fingers are making a swift knot of the sash on his blue dressing gown and he offers John a quick grin. John shakes his head at the almost-manic expression on the detective’s face and decides that he looks good enough to eat.
point in trying to interrupt when her tongue becomes the slave to her speedy mind. Sophie eventually runs out of words and settles down next to him and holds up the model she’s got clutched in her hand for him to see. John personally checked out the unusual Stealth bomber up close; it seems she’s as impressed with it as he is.
“John?” Sherlock asks, for once taken aback by the vehemence in the other man’s voice and attempting to school his own reaction against what he knows John has seen. It is too late, the damage is done. He starts moving backwards, away from John’s heightened state of emotion, only to find John has fisted a hand in his shirt and is holding him in place that way. The world tilts on its axis a bit more than it has already the past few days and Sherlock rapidly cycles through appropriate ways to end this scenario and draws a blank. So sure a few moments ago that John was going to turn around and touch him in some manner, now he adopts his usual cool demeanor.
Sherlock lazily blinks. “Does it look like I’m in the mood to talk, John?” he says out loud but at the same time Sends :
It strikes John strongly that instead of looking into a flat, he is seeing a road that splits into three: three choices that could have been made.
I’ve got to say, though, after that, we were pretty much inseparable. It wasn’t sexual, never that, but we were pretty good friends for homeless people, I think. Up until I started working for Sherlock Holmes.
John knows he’s made some sort of noncommittal sound as the air is forced out of his lungs. He stretches under his boisterous daughter and his hand glances off a muscular shoulder to his left. Sherlock is still here, then. John pokes him with his fingers, a little harder than he’d intended. Sherlock grunts.
Sherlock is ninety three percent positive that if it were possible to spontaneously combust he is going to do it in about four seconds. John left hand is cupping his chin, the right caressing the side of his face and Sherlock can see
Never really mortified at details such as this, Sherlock isn’t exactly walking around talking about how the case is ‘like Christmas’ either, so John knows he’s not as unaffected as most people believe.
“Can it, Princess.” John says as he finds himself a seat at the conference table in the corner. He chuckles when Sherlock shoots him the evil eye.
“I’m not sure what is happening at the moment, though I do believe you’ll all be glad to find out why I called you all here.” Says a politely clipped accent from the doorway as there’s a dull thump against the industrial carpet.
“Yes, you can. I’ve even got a list of places…” Sherlock begins, his deep voice creeping into I-have-a-hypothesis-territory.
“Indeed.” Sherlock answers, tilting his head slightly, eyes flashing. “He was extradited to America after killing his last two victims here in London. As much as it pains me to admit it, my brother, not me, was responsible, in part, for apprehending Daniel and ensuring his subsequent execution. Mrs. Hudson lives over on Baker Street.”
Continue to fire, his brain does. John is borne aloft on dreams of the future. He dreams of his best friend returning to life on the eve he proposes to a woman named Mary; he dreams of a fantastic wedding with a speech that melts his heart all over his shoes; he dreams a vague dream of child with blue eyes and a black mop of curly hair mixed in with dreams of a deranged black-mailer and Sherlock, his personal phoenix, raising his gun and pulling…
isn’t really a constant, isn’t it?
They pass Greg who has acquired a steaming cup of coffee. He bids Mrs. Hudson good-bye and thanks her again for the hot bun. She smiles and is quickly whisked away when Sherlock threads his arm through hers. Time was, many years ago, she would have been thrilled to have such a looker on her arm; she’s still overly proud of this man but he makes her feel as fiercely maternal as murderous in turn.
Ophelia nods. “Yeah, well, I don’t believe you, but you should be.”
“Yeah, I’m aware of that, thanks,” he states blandly. “What the hell, Sally?”
During Ruthie’s little gossip session, Kevin has returned with the tea kettle and four mugs. He’s carrying the mugs by the handles, one on each finger of his left hand; he’s got the kettle by the handle in the right. Ruthie spreads a linen napkin on the table, folding it in half. Kevin sets the kettle on the table then pours.
They all look at each other. House moves first, going around behind his desk and grabbing the rather moth-eaten duffel bag he’s got under it; completely ignoring Sherlock, who has dropped into his chair. He rummages through the bag until he finds another pair of equally moth-eaten jeans and an old Rolling-Stones T-shirt that only has artful holes in it. He ignores everyone else as he pulls the clothing on and steps barefoot into a pair of trainers from the bottom of the bag.
Without admitting anything, Mycroft replies, “Oh, no doubt we’ll get him.”
Greg’s contemplations are interrupted by the paramedics, who gently get John to a stretcher and down to the ground floor as efficiently as possible. Greg follows them, the terrier on his heels. No one else seems to be paying any mind to the dog, which in some ways he’s glad but in other ways distinctly annoyed that a room full of detectives is ignoring what could either be a prime witness or even a suspect to what has changed from a homicide inquiry now to kidnapping.
he was then like I do now. Now I’m not surprised. I wasn’t surprised when he told me that this baby is a boy nor was I surprised when he told me who the father is and when he laid out, in no uncertain terms, exactly what was going to happen to the man. I’m ashamed to say I actually felt a little bad about it…but not really.
“Should I?” Victor queries, indicating the Cat.
“Like Papa’s, but not,” Sophie deduces. She looks over her shoulder at Sherlock. He sees what she wants and leans down without being asked. Sophie gently springs one of the ebony curls with one hand and does the same to Martin’s. She laughs and pulls a bit too hard on both of their heads.
Sherrinford’s gaze travels from Sherlock’s hand to John’s face and back. In the same space of time, a knowing expression settles on his handsome face and he grins crookedly at them, eyes lighting up with pride.
Naturally, that derails John’s happy train in an instant. He stares at Sherlock for a second then turns back to Victor. Beside him, Sherlock shifts a bit closer, pressing their legs together from thigh to ankle.
For his turn, John also takes a moment to compose himself. There is a distinct feeling of being on a crossroads here, but he’s also got the impression that it is necessary in order for anything between them to move forward. Whatever it is that Sherlock needs to show him, it must be pretty serious and it is obvious taking an emotional toll on the psychic to do it. John is not going to back out on him now.
It's only been several hours since Sherlock Holmes dived from the roof of Bart's hospital, but in that time so much has happened and the one man he was supposed to keep an eye on throughout it all is the one who fell off the radar.
“Oh give it up you posh git. Millions of people wear those socks, they’ll keep your feet warm and dry whilst you frolic through the fresh fields of new grass.” John smirks, watching Sherlock wrinkle his nose at the six-pairs-for-five-pounds socks. John has been saving those for just such an occasion as this. Doesn’t hurt the consulting git to come down from his high horse once in a while. Besides, John’s no fool, he knows full well what’s going to happen to the rest of the pack, and really Sherlock doing experiments on socks is always better than a bored Sherlock. Bored Sherlocks can be dangerous to walls. And the sanity of John Watsons.
“Right.” Stottlemeyer says, tugging open the buttons on his long coat. He turns his strong attention to Sherlock. “Can you find him?”
“What do I do with this?” John asks as he follows Sherlock into a small foyer. They walk into the sitting area and John manages to keep all his questions silent as Sherlock stares around the room.
John stands on the landing in front of their flat, at the top of the seventeen steps, with the door flung open wide, pondering. The place is much neater than usual, even when he was inhabiting the space alone. He’s got a pretty good idea that the orderly appearance of the flat to Mycroft in some way. Strange how the feeling of it has changed so much in just a few days: from desolate to welcoming. What is even odder is the prickling sensation in his brain that if things would have been different, he would not be here at all.
. John does not like dealing with his emotions on the surface and Sherlock has shook an awful lot of cobwebs down from those deeply hidden rafters.
Wilson nods. “I’ll stay.” He thinks that's better, really, because if he gets his hands on House's neck right now, he'll probably throttle him.
(Cue the drum roll…because, of course you all know who that is, don’tcha?)
John tilts his head towards Sherlock in acknowledgement. Sherlock smirks smugly.
Somehow, though, Martin hadn’t told anyone else about the job offer with MJN yet, perhaps now wasn’t the time, either.
for auld lang syne.
John doesn’t have to be told twice. He grabs Sherlock’s hand and drags him out the door, ignoring the twin amused snorts of the brothers Holmes as he heads straight for the exit. Well, at least it sounds like there's something the two of them agree on.
She giggles, “Just Sophie, Uncle Martin.”
“Ok, I’m not going to ask you for exact details of your dream…”
John does his best to thank the policemen and the MP and steers Sherlock away by grasping his forearm. If the detective doesn’t have any data to go on by now, there simply isn’t any, even after the six and one-half minutes that Sherlock spent on the site swooping about like a vulture.
By the time Sherlock smelled the smoke it was too late. Something about the horror of waking up high and finding your house on fire sobers you up very, very quickly. As foolish in his bravery in his state as he always is even as he ages, he fights through the flames until he finds his sister, her striped blouse singed and hair blackened with soot.
“Greg?” John asks, staring at Sherlock the way Mrs. Hudson is sure a hawk stares down a mouse. If this were any other situation, it might actually prove to be a bit humorous.
John is quiet as they stop at a drinks stand then wend their way through the rows of tables to the one reserved for their party.
“I’d say sorry, but…” John states with a shrug.
Sherlock knows well that sometimes John needs his space to deal with his emotions. Tonight, later, he will comfort his body and his heart, but for now, he can allow John
John can hear Sherlock settling back in his chair as he stretches the towel over the edge of the sink to dry, knowing a back-handed compliment when he hears one. He grins, just a little, and tries not to think too hard about how he’s going to reward himself for that one.
It takes three full seconds for John to catch up. Realizing that he’s been virtually dismissed, he widens his stance and stiffens his shoulders. “And on whose authority do you get to tell me what to do?”
“I know,” I sniff as Mrs. Hudson squishes a tissue into my hand. I wipe my nose. “It hurts me,” I tell them, fighting against the grief again, “it hurts so much that he died that way. He had so much to…”
“Is it your hobby to run amok like a mangy mongrel and bite people? How do I know you aren’t rabid?” Sherlock leans towards Victor, attempting to use his newly found height to intimidate the other boy.
John lets his thoughts spiral off. Perhaps Sherlock’s right. Maybe he really is useless, unable to tell a corporeal spirit from one that seems to only exist in the realm of thought. What about those three children from the Norton house? He tries hard to remember what they appeared to be wearing. He couldn’t see James or Janey’s feet, but the baby was dressed in a white cottony looking dressy-like thing and her little feet were bare. Strange now that’s he’s remembering it, all three of them were definitely not dressed in modern clothing. He casts about his memory in an effort to place their outfits, but comes up empty handed.
Irene quickly resumed their drive back to the tent, but she seemed troubled. “Why is Mycroft Holmes interested in Aquamarine?” she asked, clearly finding this ominous.
Magnus cupped his cheek with his free hand. “Things will be so much better for you from now on,” he said. “I promise. I’ll help you, and eventually you’ll remember everything.”
“Why d’you keep saying suitcase?” Lestrade cut in. He had clearly seen this performance before, too often to be wowed by every trick.
“Three so far, another one almost certain to be reported soon,” Magnus conveyed excitedly. “Poisoned, no signs of struggle, no reason to kill themselves, found in strange parts of town, no apparent connection among them. Oh yes!” he added, texting avidly, “we have a serial killer on the loose in London!” He sounded, in a word, thrilled.
