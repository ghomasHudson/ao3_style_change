“You’re still an angel, Cas.”
It started out.
“--but the thing is, their buzzing noise is actually from their
They talked after that, about nothing and everything, bees and pie and old westerns. Night took over the sky and Dean scooted closer to Cas-- just for the body heat, of course. Cas held his hand and guided him down until he could see the stars and feel Cas next to him.
Now, Dean doesn’t know how Cas found out about that, and he doesn’t ask. The day is bright, and Cas is here, and he’s asking Dean for something. Something he can do.
Cas had asked to go on a drive. Right, that’s what happened. So Dean took him, why not? And Cas had said to pull over, so he had. They’d gotten out of the car and Cas had taken his hand and led him into the grass and flowers. And Dean had followed, of course he had.
“Huh?” Dean asks, pulled out of his thoughts. Cas has raised their hands to point at a small cluster of stars.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shot up, running to the doorway. “SAM! I thought I fucking told you--” He stopped. “Wait.”
Cas is breathing next to him, half human, and he hasn’t let go of Dean’s hand.
“Sammy once told me. Atoms come from exploded stars, right?” At that, Dean thinks he sees Cas smile.
Cas, he found, wouldn’t look him in the eye for longer than five seconds. That was the first thing he noticed. The second was that he didn’t touch Dean anymore, and Dean didn’t even
Dean grabbed his wrist and pulled him out of the room, and Cas’s thoughts were going a mile a minute because
when I touched you.” He grabbed Cas’s collar with both hands, pulling him closer, relishing just in the opportunity. Cas gazed at him, wide-eyed, his brain trying to catch up.
Dean was on his feet in seconds. He would never say that-- Cas had to
Cas leaned over his shoulder as he demonstrated, whispering questions into his ear, and Dean tried not to think too hard. At one point, he made a crown and placed it lopsidedly on Cas’s head. “It’s your halo,” he said, and Cas smiled.
, two weeks ago, curling in on himself and crying because of him, and Dean couldn’t look away.
The empty had taken Cas. It hurt to think of his best friend and he knew there were more pressing matters at hand, but all he could do was sit and suffer.
“Oh.”
Then shrugs.
“A million things but that doesn’t matter. One: You love Cas. Two: You’re bisexual dude. Always have been, 75% of homophobes are homophobes because they’re gay.”
. Bisexual: Being attracted to both genders sexually. Dean had never out right said that he was bi, but Sam had a strong suspicion that he was. Hmm. There was a sure way to be sure.
“You must have done something, Cas doesn’t offend easily. What did you do? Did you say something?”
Bobby never mentioned having any kids, she must have been a surprise to him as well.
~Thanks*~
like he wanted to. Raking his eyes down the angel’s body he takes in how beautiful his angel was. Dark hair complemented his naturally tan skin and cobalt blue eyes. Those eyes he so often looked into were sad and tired. “Cas-wait. I do love you. I meant what I said at the warehouse. I do need you, but not because you were an angel but because you make me a better person, you make me believe in myself like you do. I love you- I should have said it sooner but I was a coward and I uh I just.” Feeling a loss for words he thinks of what to say. His eyes are full of awe once again and the blue is quickly taken by the black of his iris. Dean knows that look, he’s seen it in countless number of women,
“Well I know you’re not looking at the mechanic are you?” He laughs, Dean wasn’t gay, because he’d been a ladies man since birth.
“Gay means you like other dudes man. Jesus.”
*BACK AT THE BUNKER...*
Goodnight? His room was the opposite way.
“My grace is gone?”
.” It’s coming from beneath him, his angel is breathing slightly in and out and another labored
“When’s the last time you were here?”
Previously On… Dean was rejected, Castiel was sassy, and Sam was, Sam. Will they finally confess their true intentions and feelings or will this continue to be like the actual series? You decide. !
Her blonde wavy hair flows down to her back, half of it is up in a type of braid, her jeans are tight and don’t leave a lot to the imagination. But her combat boots and the small blade he see’s peeking out of her boot says otherwise. Most people wouldn’t catch it, but Sam Winchester was not most people.
Cas awoke with the sound of Dean snoring lightly above him and Kevin muttering something about Geoffrey. Who the hell was he? He hadn’t really watched the show, he only payed attention when Dean was looking at him, instead he had closed his eyes and thought about how happy he was with Dean and fallen asleep. Now his hunter was asleep above him and he knew that if he didn’t move him he would have a pain in his neck the next morning. “Goodnight Kevin” he said as he got up and picked up his hunter before carrying him to their room. Dean woke up when he realized he was being carried and hooked his arms around Cas’s neck. “Hmm. You gonna make a habit of carrying me when I fall asleep?” “Perhaps.” “I’ll make sure to do it more often then.” Dean kissed his neck before whispering in his ear, “I haven’t forgotten about earlier, but it can wait. I’m too tired right now.” Cas chuckled, he knew teasing his hunter was a sure fire way to get him to speed things up. “Good” he said as he pulled back the covers after setting him down. Crawling up next to him he wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist and pulled him closer to himself. “Goodnight love.” “Night honeybee.” Cas dreamed of him and Dean fighting a ghost with Sam and after finishing the case successfully they went out to watch a movie together. He had never been to the movies, but after having his dream he decided he wanted to go.
.” Not wanting to seem rude he fights off the urge to shrug, frankly he’s just happy the guy is alive, regardless of what form he’s in. “Okay we’ll figure it out, let’s go tell Sammy the good news.” Castiel tries to get up from the warehouse floor but even with Dean’s help he can barely move. “I got you.” In one swift motion, Dean is picking up the, not so light, ex-angel. “Jesus, you’re heavier than you look.” “Jimmy was very physically fit, I tried to keep his body in the condition I found it in Dean. Out of respect of course" he mumbles the last few words but Dean heard them anyways.
“Sammy. We’re here. I’m not gonna carry you in, your too big for all that come on.” Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes he stretched and looked at his new home. Dean handed him his bags and patted him on the shoulder before heading inside. Bobby was waiting inside, and grabbed the bags and put them in a room, afterwards he pulled them both into a tight hug. “Thanks for letting us crash here man. Don’t worry about a thing I can take care of things here when you’re gone, and I’m going to look for a job first thing in the morning.” “Stop you’re yammering, you boys are family. I won’t have you looking for a job or anything else, your job is school. That goes for the both of you. School doesn’t start for another couple of weeks but I’ll see what I can do about enrolling you.” “Thanks Bobby” I say before sitting down. “If you’re desperate for work though, I can use some help working on some of these junkers out back and your old man always said you had a knack for fixing cars.” “Um yeah I’m alright, I’ll do what I can.” “Well I’m going to crash, you boys should get some sleep. Take whatever room you want.” They both nodded and Dean waited expectantly, after deciding to go into the first room Dean got up and went into the one adjacent. “Night Sammy.” “Night.”
He scrolls through the listing trying to find something suitable.
“Yes.”
Dean’s POV
After returning home, Cas takes Dean up on his offer to watch the cowboy movie.
“God. You're so stupid sometimes. Bisexual is liking BOTH. Never mind stay in denial. Fine. Then go tell him you don't love him, because he loves you Dean. The guy looks at you like you created the universe and he knows the guy who did! It’s not fair to keep stringing him along like this man. I know it’ll hurt him but it’s for the best. And if you don’t love him then why did you mope around when he didn’t make it out of purgatory? Or cry after you kicked him out? Yes, I know about that, don’t even try to lie. Most of all why would you have stayed on that warehouse floor crying over his lifeless body confessing your love to him? You love him, just fucking admit it already. If not then let the guy move on with his life.”
“Neither, there’s a section on mechanics and.”
to be a surprise.”
” Cas once again sports a bitch face, “I am not a baby, but you’re right. The outfit I usually don, is not as comfortable as it once was. I would prefer not to be carried around in public, as nice as this is it may draw unwanted attention.” Right, Cas was right. “Can you uh stand long enough to pee or?” “I can sit down and take care of this, I am not a baby, regardless of your continuous labeling me one.” Setting Cas down on the toilet he turns around to give the guy some privacy but stays just in case. Five minutes later after an almost zipper accident they are back to Dean carrying Cas to the living room. The position is becoming a familiar one and Cas doesn’t object to the idea. Once comfortable again they unpaused the movie.
Nothing happened.
almost falling over he catches himself with the back of the couch. “Dammit Cas. Just let me help okay?”
When they arrive at the morgue, he realizes that they’re not wearing the right clothes to get in. “Uh, I didn’t bring my fed suit. And I doubt they’ll believe you’re with the FBI looking like that…” Glancing at her, carefully eyeing her up and down.
“God, that’s awful. If you ever want to come to one of the AA meetings let me know, don’t worry it’s not too religious. Just a ‘higher power’ and all that.”
“Ouch” he said trying to readjust himself. Dean laughed briefly and turned around.
He didn’t realize he was weeping until he felt the tears fall onto his neck, great. Now Dean would really hate him, he hated it when people cried. This only made him cry more, and he rolled over to sob into his pillow. The pillow that smelled like Dean, he must have taken the hunter’s pillow by mistake.
“No buts. I don’t know why you’re so worried about it anyways, you’re going to skip to the fifth grade and you’re only eight.”
“Yes sir.” Looking discouraged he digs a book out of his back pack and begins reading.
. Not literally, of course, but he was hungry. The diner he’s headed to has the best waffles and he can’t wait for the angel to try something other than burgers. Pulling up to the old hole in the wall diner he cut’s off the engine.
John hugs him one last time, inhaling deeply and smiling at the life he had wanted all along. When he pulls away he looks his son in the eyes and pats his face, “I’m proud of you Dean, I didn’t say as much as I damn near should have. But I mean it, you boys are my life, I should have seen that sooner. And you, Cas.”
“You said I changed you, but you changed me. The only reason I’m not some brute and mindless killing instrument is because of you. Sure I taught you how to love the whole world, but I learned what love truly is from you. All the sacrifices you made, all the good you do, despite being the one to get hurt every time. And usually you have me there bullying you about that decision. Hating you for saving me. Lashing out at you. Cutting you off from your family. Kicking you out or abandoning you time and time again. But each time, you find your way back. No matter what your family says, your friends, or even me. You always come back to me and I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve you, but I know that I need you. We’re family.”
“That’s true. Hm.”
“That’s not true Dean, I’ve seen many adolescents do so.”
“Dammit Dean, what did you do?!”
“He was digging in Bobby’s archives and he met a girl, he should be back in a couple of days.”
“Chocolate pie is barely even pie. But whatever. Pie is still awesome.”
“You must come here often, she likes you.”
“It’s impolite to ignore one’s salutations, it almost makes me regret saving you.
“Cas wait, are you okay? I didn’t mean to upset you, it’s not your fault, and you couldn’t have known it was a gay cowboy movie anyways. We’ll watch it. Sit down and have a beer with me huh?”
Getting out of the station wagon, he almost knocks Dean over. “I want burgers. Not pie.”
After changing into the clothes he was given. He lays down and tries to remember the dream. The movie had ended and they were talking about the warehouse and what Dean had said, then they were hugging?
Great. Just one more reason for the hunter to hate him, now Cas had ruined his pillow on top of everything. You need a plan Castiel. Think if this was not Dean what would you do?
“My stomach is experiencing mild discomfort. Should I be concerned?”
“Relax Winchester, I’m just scoping the place, we can B&E it later.”
“Fine. We’ll stop at the next exit, wake up your brother and make sure that he doesn’t have to go too.”
“Oh so the saint becomes the demon. Ye without sin cast the first stone princess.”
Sure enough there was a huge hickey on his neck. Dammit Dave. He told him not to leave any visible marks, but hot damn it turned him on at the time. “So I thought you said nobody caught your eye.” “Uh, no I met her working the case. Her name’s Claire. Perfect rack.” “Alright, TMI. Go to sleep, Bobby caught a case close by and wants us to check it out. I’ll drive first shift since you’re getting back so late.” “Thanks man. Night.” “Goodnight.” After Dean falls asleep Sam gets up to start the coffee maker. Almost tripping over Dean’s pants he picks them up and throws them on the bed, tossing a phone and a piece of paper with it.
There’s no room for shame when you're already a monster. When you look at someone and you think of ten ways to tear them apart in the same breathe that you think of ten ways to fuck them into the matress.
“Leave me alone.” Cas’s voice is beautiful. It falls onto Dean’s ears like a blessing, a reprieve from the horrible ringing in his ears. “You're not real.” Fear and anger mix in Dean’s gut and he wants to throttle something.
When he thinks of a perfect life its Cas, and Sam and this makeshift, ragtag family that they’ve put together. It’s everyone happy and safe and settled in some nowhere town where their kids and their kids kids could play and be away from whatever shitty sham of a life they're living right now.
beating in time with his racing heart.
And then she shifts.
“Me. So let's not play this game, because we’ve
Sam is almost to the door when Dean snags his jacket, dragging him to a stop.
Sam is struggling to calm Jack, who is crying so loud that he can physically feel the ground shake. He looks on the verge of tears himself as Dean walks in and Dean once again feels a wave of regret that nearly brings him to his knees.
eyes that he's missed more than anything. Comparing them now, Jack’s are similar but nothing will capture Dean’s attention the way that Cas’s do.
his mind sings like a mantra—but finds he can't move. His breath is stuck in his throat as Cas lets out a gasp, silver peaking through tan, red seeping along a white shirt like a leviathan's poison through the thin skin of a neck. For a moment the sight before him blurs, overlaps, black flowing out of every pore, rot crawling up cracking skin, an explosion of blood. White overtakes his vision. Something screams in the distance and it takes him only moments to realize that it was Jack, shrill cries echoing along the water like a siren.
Dean has been fighting her since he met her, a figure in the middle of a tornado of darkness. He’s been fighting against the pull of her, fighting against the ache in his chest.

like a mantra. He doesn't even get to process the second part of the statement, just awkwardly clearing his throat.
“So,” Sam gets up to follow him as he paced back and forth along the table, bouncing Jack lightly. It is nap time.  “As long as you give me a schedule I should be fine. People do it all the time.” Dean turns to give him a raised eyebrow, gesturing wildly to the stitched wings on the baby’s back. Jack isn't a normal baby and normal baby rules don’t apply to him.
“Thank you, Jack.” Dean mutters, sliding him into Cas’s arms. “I’m glad someone here appreciates my humor.”
Dean’s honestly too tired to figure out what that means. He just drags a hand down his face and tries to hold in one of the biggest yawns of his life.
Jack is quick to fall asleep, just as he always is when they're in the car for any length of time. Sam is fading in and out of consciousness next to him, curling around his carseat like a giant cat, and Cas….

The joke falls on deaf ears, Sam already wandering away with one last harsh pat on Cas’s shoulder and Cas making the cosmic entity equivalent to grabby hands at the gurgling baby.
They cross the threshold of the house. Bitterness creeps through him, mixing with the stale blood on his tongue. This is just a cruel parody of everything he ever wanted.
He’s able to keep his own head up for a little bit, and his bright blue eyes have retained their unnervingly intelligent look. It’s made even more obvious when they glow golden in Cas’s presence as if reacting to his grace. His hair is sticking up randomly, resistant to Deans attempts to brush it with the tiny soft brush he had bought.
Dean lets out a sound that is close to a squawk, slamming his hands down on the table. “Some old dude!” He repeatings. “
Dean looks back at Sam as he hangs up, throwing his phone onto the table and turning back to grabbing books.
Dean lays Jack down in the open bed, pulls the blankets up so that he’ll be warm and barely manages to make it back to the couch before he collapses, head in his hands.
He was torn. He didn't want Sam going out there on his own; he had already lost so much and he couldn't keep him safe from 100 miles away. But at the same time they couldn't exactly bring a baby with them on the case, especially not with something as dangerous as a wraith.
in that picture that’s burning a hole in his pocket. Like he would rather be here than anywhere else in the world, like he would trade anything to be able to stay in that moment permanently.
Life on the road with a baby was hard, more than once Dean was forced to feed Sam in the backseat of the Impala, his dad slaving over that fucking journal. Sam's body was nearly half the size of his own. He used gentle hands to burp him when he needed to, frantically cleaned the seats as he inevitably puked. Dad hated when the Impala was dirty.
Dean feels a hand on his cheek, so small that it doesn't even span the entire length. Tiny fingers and nails curl into his skin and he covers it with his own. It's completely dwarfed, his entire hand enclosed by Dean’s palm alone, calluses catching on the back of Jack’s hand.
Dean presses a kiss to Cas’s hair, his forehead, anywhere he can reach, just to assure himself that he was there, that this was real.
“Dead.” Dean thinks of blue eyes and a flash of white. “There was an accident.”
“You're back.” Dean can see his lips move, hear his own voice, but he has made no movement himself.
But not with Cas. It was a comfort to hear his soft breathes, to know that they didn’t need to fill the silence. Just being with each other was more than enough.
Dean is trapped.
That is until Dean tried to make Jack take his nap in the playpen and was met with earpiece shrieks.
“Why?” Cas asks. “You ran yourself into the ground and
What if this was all just a dream? If Cas was never back in the first place and Dean was just losing his mind? Imagining things that aren't actually there? Without Cas next to him, in his line of sight, in grabbing distance, it all seems to grow hazy as if it was never real to begin with.
Jack curls a hand around a beer bottle and winces at the taste, digs into shitty Chinese food like it’s the best thing he’s ever tasted, because it is. Everything is new to him.
It takes Dean a moment where he's all shaky breaths and stuttering heartbeats before he can even move. One step and then the next, his mind disconnected as Cas also takes a step towards him.
Jack was back to dozing comfortably in Cas’s arms where he couldn't get puke on another article of Dean’s clothing. Cas was still looking at the two hunched over the computer with that soft smile. Dean knocks his elbow into Cas’s gently, careful not to startle him while he was holding the baby.
of wanting something so desperately that, sometimes, it hurts to breathe around the ache in his chest and the want in his gut. Of losing him over and over and somehow never learning that he had to take his chance while he still could because who knew if they were going to be alive tomorrow.
Finally, Dean can't take it anymore, pushing to his feet, careful of Jack who is still peering up at them. Cas doesn't seem to be scared of him leaving, just watching as Dean paces across from him. He keeps talking.
They still need to find a way to get Mary back, and the weight of the angels and demons no doubt coming after Jack still sits heavy on the back of his mind, but they have Cas. He is a solid presence in the Impala, a line of heat along his side as they finally pull into the garage, and soft hands and shuffling feet as Dean pulls Jack’s carrier out of the backseat.
Dean can’t raise a hand against Cas, even when he knows it’s not Cas.
This baby couldn't be evil, nothing this innocent was ever truly evil, but he would need guidance, protection. And, somehow, that responsibility fell to Dean. To Dean. Dean who shouldn't be trusted with a dog, let alone a baby, let alone one of the most powerful beings in existence.
Dean feels almost nauseous with it. He collapses next to Cas on his knees, gently turns him until he’s lying on his back, staring up at the neverending void above them. He’s never seen Cas look so dead, so tuned out from the world.
Thank you for reading!
“Tummy time?” Dean lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding and pushes off the couch, finally letting go of Cas’s wrist. Immediately his hand feels cold. He wants to grab him again, some possessive part of his brain never wants to let go, as if by holding Cas’s wrist he could somehow tether him here. Instead, he just watches as Cas gets up, smoothing down his trench coat. It was a relief to see him in it again.
Dean is so consumed by his own guilt and fear that Jack’s cries sound far away, his fingers tightening more until he can feel the bones creak.
! Wild Bill, Clay Allison, Curly Bill Brocius,
But he smiles up at Cas as if he knows him, as if he remembers him from his time before he was born.
Dean can pretend all he wants, has been pretending from the moment Cas has fallen limp on the grass. That Cas wasn’t actually dead, that he would one day walk through the door of that bunker, that he himself was okay. That he was dealing with this the right way.
“You would love Cas.” He says one day out of the blue. He had talked to Jack before, but not like this. Never about Cas.
Dean knows, now, to hold a burping rag under Jack's chin, carefully patting his back. His eyes flutter shut as he drinks from the bottle, hiding those blue eyes from view and making Dean’s chest ache. Blue eyes and brown hair, pale skin flawless and baby smooth where Dean runs his fingers along one cheek. He looked like a doll more than anything, any puffiness and redness already gone. That makes Dean pause because he knows that it can take a while before babies stop looking so… smooshed, but here Jack is.
“Careful with your hair, he has a death grip when he wants to.” Sam warns.
Dean lets out a sharp breath through his nose and takes another step closer to Cas. “Why would I lie about this? None of this is your fault.”
“Do not make light of this.” Cas interrupts his voice cold enough to stop Dean in his tracks. “This is not a chick flick moment, these are my feelings and I’d like you to respect that.” Dean shuts his mouth, snapping his eyes back to meet Cas’s and he’s captivated once again.
“Don’t touch Cas.”
“How do you even want me here?” Cas’s voice is like ice. It chills Dean to the very core, it makes him freeze in his tracks, makes him realize just how mad Cas really was. “If I was you I’d want me
.” Dean quickly scrambles forward. He meets Cas’s eye for the first time since this all started.
“I didn't mean what I said,” Dean needs to say this, needs Jack to know, even if he didn't quite understand it yet. “I don't wish you were never born, Sam was right I just wish that Cas could be here, with us.” Dean meets Jack’s glowing eyes and watches them fade back to a familiar blue.
Dean wakes up surrounded by warmth. The overwhelming feeling of safety settling over him like a blanket.
like a balm that soothed something deep inside of him.
Why did they have to talk about this? Why couldn't Cas let a good thing be? Don't fix what isn't broken (even if at the moment they did seem pretty broken, trading stolen glances over their son).
“I can’t tell if you’re getting better at this or worse.” Dean lets out a sharp huff of air through his nose, almost sick with the realization that he was right. The confirmation was almost worse. Already they're used against each other, a weapon to make the other obey.
They had bought a soft cushioned carpet specifically for this reason about a week in. It was laid haphazardly in between one of the armchairs and the new couch they had also bought. It was soft enough that Jack would be comfortable, even when he got too tired to hold his head up and laid it in his hands.
Instead he curls his fingers around his own wrist, squeezing until he can feel his bones creak.
Cas who he cared about. Cas who he had cared about for who knows how long, the two of them dancing around each other. Cas who had rebuilt him from scratch, but left his calluses so he wouldn't hurt himself. Who placed every freckle and mole.
Jack was none of those things. Dean needs to make sure to cradle his head when he carries him, and burp him every single time he feeds him instead of just when he has gas. It's all a learning experience for him.
Feeding Jack was another thing Dean has to grow used to, it was far different from feeding a six month old.
The tone takes him by surprise. Just how many times has he made it out? How many times had he clawed his way to the surface only to be pushed back down?
When did he get on the bed? When did the tv get turned on? What show was this? The questions enter his mind and leave just as fast.
. The thought alone made Dean giddy, smiling into his pillow.
The anger.
Crowley doesn't appreciate being dragged around the country. He cares about Dean. A crooked smile curls over Dean’s face when he thinks about it, the King of Hell
“Dean,” Cas says and his voice nearly breaks. With anger or grief or whatever mixture of emotions Cas was feeling at the moment, it didn't matter. “Don't lie to me, not now.”
“Of course.”

Cas, for what it's worth, isn't looking at him like he’s crazy. He just has a soft look in his eye, a small quirk to his lips as he looks between Jack and Dean.
There’s no answer as it is, Sam stays silent as they spiral closer and closer through the looping halls of the bunker.
“I feel like you should be more worried about doing our fucking job, than about me destroying another nursery.” He spat out. “I'm dealing with it just fine.”
“You are not your father, and I am not Mary and Jack is not you, and Jack is not Sam. We are our
Something in Dean snaps and he quickly scoops Jack up. The baby startles just as Dean thought he would, arms flying out and more importantly, tiny shadowy wings extending and smacking into Dean's chest. It knocks the wind out of him.
The tall one pushes him into the bathroom, away from the woman who he doesn't seem to trust, who looks at him with curious eyes. He sets him on the toilet as he sits on the edge of the bathtub.
“You have the same eyes, you know. I don't know how considering he's not actually your dad.” He says as he gives Jack his first bottle of the day, ignoring how crazy he sounds talking to a 7 week old baby. “Though you have your mothers hair.” Dean pointedly ignores mentioning how similar that shade is to his own.
Why do words have to be so hard?
So, they don’t talk. Even as they silently agree on tummy time, sitting cross legged with Jack between them, peering up with his too sharp eyes. They just stare blankly away from each other.
He can still see his nose crunching under Dean’s fist, the burn of the mark on his forearm as anger thrummed through his veins like a drug. Dean can imagine his hand curling against Cas’s throat, the burn of stubble under his palm, the crack of his cheekbone. The warmth of his blood on Dean’s knuckles, lingering until he could finally bring himself to wash it off.
“Because of this mark” Michael spits out the word, ignoring him and glancing back at the mirror, locking eyes with Dean who grits his teeth. He can feel the smugness flowing through Michael. He’s confident in his position, in his ability to control Dean if he needs to.
Dean had never understood comfortable silences until he met Cas. He always had to talk, fill the silence in a room, or else it would smother him.
One day, Dean wakes up to the door of the bunker slamming closed and he bolts out of bed, skidding to a stop in the entryway, gun cocked. All he finds is a scrap of paper on the radar telling him that Sam had left for a hunt and would text him when he was on his way home.
It never hits, there’s no pain. Just a flash of light.
Dean lets his eyes fall shut. For all his bravo, he finds that he can't look Cas in the eye, not while he admits how weak he is.
Eventually, Jack’s weight grows heavy enough on Dean’s shoulder that he knows he’s asleep. He scoops him up like the child he is, an arm supporting his neck and another under his knees.
Sam is completely still as Dean finally enters Kelly’s room and terror creeps up his spine. If something has happened to Sam, Dean wouldn’t leave. He would sit there and wait. Wait until the angels or demons or whatever god forsaken creature finds them and….
Dean looks down and sees Jack's face, screwed up and crying. Something in him breaks and he feels a tear fall before he can stop it. He can't find the words to comfort Jack. Words never come easy when he is going through shit like this, so instead he sways side to side cradling him in his arms and buries his face in baby soft hair.
“It’s fine.” He says instead, slightly more confident this time. He slips a sock onto each tiny foot, and the onesie over Jack’s head, trying his best to keep from spiraling. He counts the little bees on the onesie and quickly realizes it's the same one they had taken from the lake house. It makes his heart jolt sharply in his chest.
He tries to breath through the pain in his chest when he wakes up at night to a baby screaming and he has to deal with it by himself. When he looks into Jack's eyes and can only see Cas staring back at him.
Dean thinks of watching his mother burn and tucks the newborn's head closer to his chest.
When they get back to the bunker they're going to have to talk. A part of Dean is dreading it the same way that he dreads every conversation about feelings, but another is almost giddy, because this was it; this was the win he needed.
“Why are we going to your room?” Cas asks as Dean pushes open the door. “Does Jack not have a nursery?”
“Cas…” Dean’s lips brush against the rough palm of his hand and Cas sighs, his eyes falling shut.
Sam eventually comes to a stop in front of Dean and Jack, the baby's neck craning as far as it could to try to look at Sam. Dean sighs and pushes himself into a sitting position, scooping Jack up so he wouldn’t hurt himself trying to look that high.
Dean move him wherever he wants, evident by the fact that Dean couldn’t shake the hand on his wrist even if he wanted to.
“If you want, I’ll finish up here and you can go take the bottle to the kitchen.” He gestures with his free hand towards the bottle on the dresser.
not Cas.
“Checked his diaper?”
“I'm guessing you changed him during the night while I was asleep.” Dean pushed himself up and mirrored Cas’s position, their knees knocking together. After their talk last night (which Dean couldn’t even start to think about without blushing like a teenage girl), Dean hadn't woken up again, which meant that Cas had taken care of all of Jack's needs through the night.
When Dean turns back around Cas is still sitting on the bed, fully dressed, and looking at him with an expression that could only be described as fond. It just makes Dean blush harder. God, what was he? Some teenage girl.
The shadowy wings fold away as Dean cradles him on instinct.
“No Dean, you're really not.” Sam lets out a frustrated sigh and sits in the chair across from him. Dean tries to glare at him, but Sam keeps giving him the same sad look. “You act like you’re doing fine, but you’re not.”
Or maybe Dean is just trying to find an excuse as to why he wants to be so close to Cas, why he always wants to push in closer, the never ending need to just be near him. If it was the handprint then it wasn't his fault, he couldn’t stop it, it wasn't something he would have to get over. He wouldn't have to move on. Blaming it on the handprint was easier than admitting that he wanted something he couldn't have, something that Cas couldn't give him.
Dean can’t find it in himself to care at the moment, more focused on calming a screaming Jack. He had to fight back the feeling of nostalgia. He remembers waiting with Sam clutched in his tiny arms or clinging to his hand as his dad got them a room. Dean remembers the line of clerks who gave him that same annoyed look, though filled with more pity. Babies were never good for the hotel business.
The very thing that made Cas an angel, the closest thing he has to a soul. Something unquestionably Cas’s.
Dean wants to interrupt, but he can't seem to find his voice, choking on the lump in his throat.
“You know what? Sounds about right for our life. Kid imprints like a baby duck, and he has the wings to match.” Dean laughs at his own joke, glancing up to meet Cas’s disapproving glare.
“She didn't take it well, according to Jody.” Dean admits. His hands itch to hold Jack. Two months and he’s already gotten used to the weight in his arms, the ability to hide his face in Jack’s baby soft hair. “We told Jody that we could drive there to tell her in person, but she said she would handle it.”
Dean doesn't sleep that night.
My main blog is
“You are not taking Jack into a town being terrorized by a shapeshifter.” Cas stated. “If you want to go then you can, but me and Jack will be staying here.”
“We’ll talk about this in the morning.” He says, sliding down so that he’s curved around Dean and Jack both. Their fingers are still laced together and neither of them make an effort to untangle them. “Sleep. I'll watch over you.”
“Of course.” As if it was obvious, as if there was no other option. “I don't sleep, it only makes sense for me to watch over Jack at night, and since his bassinet is in here it easiest for me to just stay in here.”
But not this time. He sits wide awake, eyes glued to the screen, Cas’s wrist never leaving his grip and Cas never pulling away.
His stomach growls and he latches onto that, sweeping in to pick up Jack who has been looking at them, eyes glowing their normal gold. Dean somehow feels like he’s judging him. It seems like a ridiculous thought. He was two months old, he couldn't even burp on his own.
The baby is completely silent for its first bath. Dean distinctly remembers the way that Sam would scream and cry when the water touched him. Bathtime was torture for the both of them until Sam was nearly three. But not this one, he simply looks at Dean throughout the entire process. Even as Dean pours the warm water over his head to wash the gore out of his hair, careful to keep the suds and water off his face, he simply squirms.
Regret settles like a pit in his stomach as he looks at the carnage. Jack doesn't deserve to have his stuff destroyed because Dean can't handle his own grief.
So it’s finally finished. Sorry it took so long! I’m not entirely happy with it so I’ll probably rewrite some part of this in the future. Also tag change cause Cas is no longer dead.
Sam eagerly hands Jack over, his tiny hands clutching desperately at Dean's shirt once it's in reach. Sam’s eyes glance down at the trenchcoat, before darting away.
Cas loves him and Dean loves Cas back just the same but he won't admit it because he's scared. And that is so entirely selfish that Dean wants to punch himself.
“I keep waiting for it to get better, having Sam and you should be enough but it's like a part of me died with him.” Dean finally sobs. “I just want him back,” He pauses trying to drag a breath into his aching lungs, eyes falling shut.
And my spn/fandom blog is @deanwinchesterforbatman2k21
Cas lets a sharp breath through his nose and turns the full force of his glare onto Dean. Dean’s head is still spinning, trying to figure out how to get this back on track, how to make Cas see how important it is that they stop talking about this.
But Dean will never feel right again. Right is dead and gone, right is ash and bone on a beach twelve hours away, right is wherever angels go when they die. Right has gone somewhere Dean can’t follow and he can feel its absence in his chest, in his soul.
kid. Well, his and Cas’s now, but the point still stands.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam just nods, his face serious enough that Dean knows he doesn't have to finish, and turns to continue up the steps and out the front door.
Cas turns to leave and Dean makes a wounded noise without his own permission.
Cas had told him bits and pieces of his time in the empty. It was a horrible mocking thing. It liked peace and quiet and would do anything to keep it that way. It didn't like Cas personally because he had made it ‘loud’.
Dean turns right back around, instead, and heads to the kitchen.
Dean will never feel that cool rush of grace, the healing touch of something so purely
Sam looks at him, and the pain in his eyes nearly stops Dean. Regret sits like a stone weight in his chest. Sam has lost everyone, he already takes the guilt of so many deaths onto himself, even when he had no control over it.
Dean aches for revenge, against Lucifer, against Kelly, against Jack, but he could never get it. Lucifer is gone, took his mother with him, Kelly is dead and Jack….
Cas starts pacing the room anxiously, arms stiff at his side, hands clenching and unclenching along with Jack’s cries.
In the barn, Cas’s eyes were filled with so much innocence, so much hope for humanity. It was the same innocence and hope they filled with when he spoke of Jack. Eight years later and Cas still has that same belief that there was good in the world.
Once again, blue eyes.
“Wings, yeah.” Jack sleepily looks up at Cas, eyes glowing the same gold they always did when his wings were out. “Happens when he’s really happy, or upset, or even when he’s tired.” Dean pulls open one of his nightstand drawers and adds the feathers to the rapidly growing pile in there.
“Because after everything that you've done, you owe us, you son of a bitch. So you get your ass down here and you make this right, right here and right now.” Dean's voice rises with his anger, tears gathering in his eyes without permission. This wait is longer, a minute before Dean suddenly erupts punching the wall in front of him until his knuckles crack and bleed. The pain grounds him.
For the first time since they had found Jack on that bed, covered in blood and slime, burning the sheets around him, Dean was utterly lost. He doesn't know how to make Jack feel better. He can't calm him down when he can't even calm himself down. He can't form the thought to sing to him. All he can do is stand there, the screaming baby held in his arms as he tries to save this.
He comes to looking in a mirror.
Dean sees Cas’s eyes flickering from Jack back to himself, as if he couldn't choose what to look at first. He’s still standing too far away for Dean’s liking, the space between them drawing Dean forward until he’s toe to toe with Cas.
He’s allowed to do that now.
Dean knows love, and he knows who’s he’s in love with and Amara isn’t him.
The only reason Dean doesn't bolt up and storm off is the baby peacefully asleep on his knees. Jack glues him to his spot on the couch, but anger sits at the back of his throat and nearly chokes him.
He was Lucifer’s kid, he had somehow convinced Kelly and Cas that he should live before he was even born. They couldn’t trust him, not right away, not in their line of work.
Cas looks up at Deans laugh and Dean is suddenly struck silent by those eyes. Those blue,
Cas had only been back for a day and he was already doing so well with Jack, so overwhelmingly gentle for someone who could just as easily kill a shapeshifter with a hard enough punch.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas knows. He has to. Or, at the very least he’s thinking it, but he doesn't push and Dean couldn't appreciate it more. His throat is still closed painfully as he measures out the formula, buries his nose in Jack’s hair, tries to ground himself enough to finally come out and say it.
The drive is hazy, unmemorable, his eyes not quite focusing on the road, his hands shaking where they’re white knuckling the steering wheel. Jack is oddly silent in the back, Sam sitting up straight next to the carrier as if he had forgotten how to relax in the week that he was gone. There are no coos or cries that Dean has gotten so used to over the nearly two months that Jack has been with him.
“Dean?”
Dean’s eyes don’t leave the pyre until it’s nothing but ash.
Since that night by the Lake house, more often than not, Dean woke up screaming or, god forbid, on some nights crying. No one needed to see that. Every night Dean had to live with the shame and the grief and the pain and that pit in his chest that threatens to swallow him whole. That wasn’t going to go away just because Cas was back, no matter how much he wished that was true.
“Penny for your thoughts?”
The picture is of Cas, Sam, Claire, and him. He's not even sure of when it was taken, though he’s sure it was Jody’s handiwork. Claire is laughing at something Sam had said, her legs thrown over Cas’s, but Cas is too busy glaring at the camera. It's Dean himself that catches him off guard. He's looking at Cas like he hung the stars, like there was nothing more important in the world.
“Don't worry, he won’t wake up from us talking, I think he finds it calming.” Dean can't help himself from smiling down at the baby. He was growing quickly, seemingly at the same rate as any other baby according to the websites he had read, but it still felt far too fast.
They're alone in the bunker for a week. A week of silence broken only by a baby babbling and Deans own inane chattering. A week of the pit of shame in Deans stomach threatening to swallow him whole.
Dean wants to hate him, he does hate him in some way. He can feel it, hidden under the sorrow and guilt and mistrust. It’s misguided anger of course, Dean knows that, he
Dean gently lays Cas on the table, hovers over him for a couple moments, letting his lips brush Cas’s forehead in the whisper of a kiss. Another thing he’s wanted for years, now suddenly obvious in the face of his friends….
The nearest baby store is nearly an hour away, but the drive seems to settle something in both him and Jack. It hurts Dean that Jack has already started to associate the impala with home and safety the same way Sam and him had. He deserves better; he deserves a real home.
Normal or not it still makes Dean close his eyes against the rush of emotion. He just can't seem to get a grip, every movement of Cas’s drawing his eye. Every feeling amplified in his presence.
. They’re an anchor keeping him from just floating away, lost in the images crossing the tv screen.
Suddenly a scream rips through the air, so loud Dean has to cover his ears. It's loud enough that it moves the flames making them ripple through the air.
It doesn't hurt any less to see them here, especially not when Cas is….
Cas has already gotten hurt because of them, has
But still the mistrust lingers, because this isn’t his baby brother. He didn’t have 22 years to watch him grow into the man he was before he was faced with the idea of him being inhuman. Dean doesn’t have the concrete trust in Jack, built over decades like he did with Sam.
“Yeah, I made sure to tell her last night, as soon as we got back.”
Cas just smiles at him. “Sleep, Dean. I'll watch over you.”
Dean lets out a frustrated growl and debates just waking Jack up so he can leave anyway. His fingers are still trapped in his hands and Dean knows if he tries to pry them out Jack is going to wake up screaming.
But Cas loved him. Cas was willing to give his life for him. So, a part of Dean cares about Jack too, even if he wants to hate him.
They head to the kitchen anyway to make a bottle before going to the library, landing heavily on the couch with a muffled sigh. Dean hands Cas the bottle and watches as he feeds Jack.
Instead he carefully lays Jack in the middle of the bed. He is far too young to actually roll off the bed, but better safe than sorry. His cries slow after he has a fresh diaper and a full stomach. Instead he was letting out small whimpers, his eyes never leaving Dean.
“Yes, as long as he had both of us sufficiently close, he seemed fine.” Cas finishes zipping up Jack’s footsie pajamas, giving Dean an exasperated look. “We are going to have to teach him to sleep on his own eventually, Dean.” Dean looks away instead of replying.
Then, all at once, it hits him like a train that Cas is
Jack would have to be set up in Dean's room until they could find him a crib, and even then he would need around the clock attention for at least another 2 months before he could start sleeping through the night.
Dean would put the bath off, seeing as how Jack is half asleep already, but there was the smell of sour milk around the kid, and Dean really didn't want to have to deal with that for longer than necessary.
Dean ignores him, pushing himself off the bed and waiting patiently for Cas to follow him.
They always seem to lose. This is what the fourth, the fifth, time they've lost Cas? Though it was never this final. There was never a flash of light, never an imprint of wings on the ground. Dean can still see the blinding light when he closes his eyes, an afterimage burned onto the back of his eyelids. Just another thing to haunt him.
It’s too close to what it would actually look like. Dean looks at the floor and half expects to see wings charred into the ground, to see his body still lying there.
“Give me the day.” Dean begs. “I need to think.”
Dean turns away from the flash of light, away from the searing of wings into the ground, only to find that the ground is no longer there.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Dean didn't want to live without him, gladly would have let Chuck have his way if it didn't mean taking Jack and Sam down with him. He would have let Chuck have his way if his way didn't mean living forever without Cas, because even God knows what his true weakness is, what he couldn't live without.
How many times had Cas been tricked for him to have given up so wholey. How long has he been stuck here, constantly reliving his rescue only for it to be fake, for Dean to collapse in a pile of black ooze. For ‘Dean’ to openly mock him for his sentiment.
Jack isn't small, but when he presses his face closer to Dean’s chest and snuffles gently, Dean can almost pretend that he’s as young as he’s supposed to be. Dean can imagine the baby he would be, all blue eyes and chubby cheeks. He thinks maybe it would be easier to accept him then, when he looked the part of the innocent child.
The weeks it took them to get a spell strong enough to guide him here it had sat on that chair mocking Dean for his loss. Sam had seen it once, had given Dean a sad understanding look before leaving him to his grief. Day after day he would fall asleep with his hand pressed to the scar on his shoulder, hoping it’ll bring him some comfort, that wherever Cas was it would comfort him as well. A connection even in death, to the person he loved.
“No thanks, I think this is better birth control than all my sex ed classes combined.” But, she is already making her way closer to where Cas is shifting Jack from his shoulder into the cradle of his arms. Jack looks back at her, blinking slowly. At least he wasn't crying.
“Give me a minute.” Dean is ashamed to admit it, but he almost begs, turning away from Cas once more. He’s trying to get his thoughts in order but they seem to bounce around his head faster than he could even hope to process them.
. To get his hand off him, to gain an ounce of control so he can physically drag it away. “Don't touch it and I’ll stop fighting.”
It's three days later that Sam finally comes back. Jack is asleep in his playpen, having just eaten, and Dean is taking a break from painting the nursery a beer loose in his hand.
Dean gapes for a moment, before Jack’s uncomfortable squirming brings him back to the present.
The flashback to Cas sitting on a motel bed, pawing through Dean’s toiletries like he owned them, is so vivid that Dean has to push himself off the bed. He has to pace around the room, his arms feeling strangely empty.
It doesn't help that Jack is obviously picking up on their mood, whining and squirming while Dean changes him. He gets a hand in Dean’s hair while he's carrying over his shoulder and yanks so hard that Dean lets out a cry of pain, delicately trying to get Jack’s fingers untangled.
Sam lets out a frustrated sigh that immediately raises Dean’s hackles. Anger is a familiar face and he lets himself be overcome by it as Sam continues, oblivious to Dean’s turmoil.
understand, he knows exactly what he's chasing. He knows what that handprint means, but he’ll never admit it, not even to himself. He knows why it burns, something so pure was never meant to touch the rotted, hallowed out thing that his soul is becoming.)
“I’m going to go make dinner since we missed lunch.” Dean doesn't wait for Cas’s answer. He doesn't want to look at his face and see that openness turn to disappointment when he realizes that Dean isn't going to talk about it. The conversation they should be having hovers between them, making it hard to breathe if Dean thinks about it for too long.
Dean sits down hard on the seat across from him and rubs a hand across his face. His stubble was getting too long.
There was no one to guide Dean, besides his own memories. No Mom to teach him how to properly heat a bottle, no Crowley to snark about how exactly not to raise kids. No Cas….
“I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me-” Dean hears the words catch in Cas’s throat as he stands up straight, Jack cradled in his arms. “Is that?”
Dean has been stumbling around on eggshells that he himself had placed, desperately clung to rules of his own making, terrified of giving Jack the same childhood he and Sam had. Scared of turning into the type of father that made his kid call him ‘Sir’.
Six hours. Honestly he applauds himself for even getting that far. Cas hadn't changed the way he was acting, not really, but Dean couldn't help but focus on him even more now.
For the first time since the gas station, Dean walks away from Jack, leaves him with Sam. He storms into the nearly complete nursery and, for a moment, pauses.
Jack is almost five weeks old when Dean begins to slip. He knows that he hasn't been getting the amount of sleep he should be. Most parents aren’t meant to raise a kid alone, let alone a supernatural kid who refused to be on his own for more than five seconds at a time.
Cas reaches a hand up, letting his fingers brush Dean’s cheekbone, barely skimming the surface until Dean leans into it fully, resting his cheek in Cas’s hand. He turns his face until his lips brush a still bloody palm. He wants to lean in and kiss him properly, but there'll be time for that later when they're home safe and sound in the bunker.
He snatches the baby carrier from the floor and is quick to buckle in Jack, the baby grumbling as he's moved from his comfortable spot in Dean's arms.
Dean pulls Cas’s hand away from his mouth, guides it down to his shoulder, thankful that he had nothing more than a t-shirt on. It's a last effort, a plea, a prayer that he can't voice out loud, too scared that his voice will crack with emotion.
have a serious talk at some point of another. Not if you wanted to continue to kiss that person, and holy fuck did Dean want to kiss Cas again, maybe even without Jack being there this time.
It’s waking up in the morning and finding a case to work on, Cas by his side. It’s saving the day and coming home to his family alive and well.
Cptnvers on tumblr made a drawing of the
Dean gives Jack a look but finds him focusing instead on the sound of Sam’s voice, quizzically searching for the source. He has already eaten and has a dry diaper so he was just awake, content in Dean's arms.
Dean had to stop himself from buying those childproof handles for every door in the bunker. Jack was only two months old, dude couldn't even hold his head up by himself yet, let alone walk.
Those eyes lit any room he was in.
It's all as simple as breathing to them, to exist in the same space, to work as one part of a whole unit. They part ways, they come back together, never skipping a beat in a conversation. It makes Dean’s heart pound because: How long has it been this way? How long has he essentially been married to Cas without even noticing?
A secret said in the daylight is clear, concise. No room for excuses and arguments. Sunlight paints things in black and white. Light and shadow. Secrets are meant for the dark, the gray area of the night.
Cas nods, motioning for him to lead the way, a matching smile on his lips.
The baby is squirming on the bed, the sheets around him charred and black. Someone (probably mom, his mind supplies, sending a bolt of pain through him) had started to clean Kelly up, but there was still blood on the sheets, coating her thighs.
Dean misses the ease of yesterday morning before he even opens his eyes.
He pulls out all the fixings for a full breakfast, setting them on the counter closest to Cas and Jack.
He tries to memorize every piece of this moment, from the blue of Cas’s eyes to the ozone smell that surrounds him like the beginnings of a thunderstorm. The weight of Jack in his arms and the warmth emanating from Cas like a furnace. Even Sam awkwardly coughing in the background.
Sam had to pull Dean kicking and screaming from the other world, away from Cas striding towards Lucifer like he was nothing more than some random demon. Like he couldn't kill him without breaking a sweat.
So Dean lets Jack stay curled up on his shoulder, because even though it isn't right, it’s better than nothing. Better than the cold of knowing that the only thing left of Cas is apparently the handprint on his arm and a piece of grace wedged in close to his soul. It's better than the ache that has made a home in his shoulder since Sam lit the pyre.
Dean sucks in a ragged breath and looks down just to make sure that there was no ash, just the absence where the qareen once stood. The
“I hope you have his optimism.” Is blurted out as Dean gives Jack a bath, his little legs kicking up water.
“I'm amazed you got him to fall back asleep without this.” Dean remarks. He places the jacket close enough for Jack to grab at and the lapel immediately goes towards his mouth.
Cas. His mind latches onto that for some reason, the weight of it settles in his mind and it sounds right. The answer to a question that he’s already forgotten.
“I never said love.”
When Dean looks back, Cas is staring at him with open wonder, thumbs brushing the hinge of his jaw gently.
Cas wanted this kid. He wanted this kid enough to die for him. It is written plainly everywhere he looks. Cas and Kelly put so much thought and research into this, bought the best they could. They did their best to make this a house that Cas could raise the baby in. No matter what, Lucifer's blood or not, this baby was Cas’s.
Castiel, shield of god, was scared of words.
to help her instead of trying myself.”
“Missouri is dead.”
He wonders if they’re gonna end up making a habit of kissing with Jack in between them and chuckles to himself as he pulls away.
Part of him feels a little silly. It's a common phase, but after last night it had taken on a new meaning, his whole world readjusting, his mental dictionary rearranging so the phase sits at the forefront.
Dean is overwhelmed by a feeling he can't describe. Like walking into a cool room when it's sweltering outside, like the warmth of a person pressed into your side when it's cold, the comfort of a hand in yours when you're scared. It's finally coming home after a long road trip, sinking into your bed after a long day.
My spn(and art blog now) is
“He’s beautiful.” The woman had paused where she was looking at the car seats, and is now turned towards Dean and Jack. “A little late to be crib shopping though, where's your wife?.” She smiles and it grates on Dean’s nerves.
scared him enough that he had completely shut down.
The tug in his chest rises into a full scream as Cas lights up from the inside, a sliver of that beauty shining through his eyes.
“I wasn’t talking about mom.”
It had been a day, less than 24 hours, since Dean had thought he would never see Cas again. He couldn't even go a
Dean is more than annoyed when they pull into the motel, Sam guiding him off the freeway. Just like every other moment the car slows to a stop, Jack quickly starts crying louder and Dean’s frustration grows. Dean is forced to wait outside the clerk office, rocking the newborn’s carrier back and forth in an effort to calm him. The clerk makes a face at him through the glass.
Its stupid to be that vunerable. To give people the chance to use something so important to you against yourself.
It’s ingrained in his mind, written into his DNA, that he has to protect Sam, even at the cost of his own life.
“I'll let her speak for herself. Remember, two hours.” And then he continues walking down the hall as if he wasn't going to leave Dean at the mercy of a twenty year old with a bigger sense of vengeance than goddamn Batman.
“Hey Cas,” Dean’s voice breaks and he's forced to clear his throat. “I want you to meet your son, Jack.” Cas doesn't respond. Of course he doesn’t, but Dean desperately wishes he would. Wishes he would get up and ask to hold Jack. Dean would teach him how to support his head and make sure that he was secure. But, instead, the only noise is his own harsh breaths as the pain in his throat grows and Jack’s small snuffles against his chest.
That he couldn't manage to keep any part of his family together.
Jack took to it like he does everything else, with a curious glance filled with far more intelligence than a two month old should have. He still cried and fussed like any normal baby when he was hungry or uncomfortable, but things like changing and baths didn't startle him the way it probably should have.
“Hello, Dean.”
“I'm glad that, even though I was gone, he had so many people to take care of him.” Dean’s heart stops at the first mention of Cas’s death. His entire mind grinds to a halt, echoing at him -
With a flash of golden light a shadowy wing shoots out and smacks into Dean, nearly knocking him over.
The blood stings in Dean’s veins. It burns a path through his body and he can't tell if it's actually curing him or killing him. With every dose, the pain in his shoulder fades as the blood flows like acid through him. He’s sure that death would be preferable to this. He wants to beg and plead for it to end, but all that leaves his mouth are screams that shake the walls of his cell.
Jack isn’t crying yet, but his eyes are wide, peering around for whatever startled him.
“I think you're the only thing keeping me alive right now.” He admits letting his cheek rest on baby soft hair.
But instead, he finds himself moving closer.
It was a look he couldn't examine too closely.
It's everything he ever wanted, nine years of pining and avoiding the topic.
If he had talked about it before he wouldn't have been able to stop himself from admitting just how safe Cas made him feel.
Dean doesn't actually remember becoming a demon, but he does remember waking up to pain.
It’s relief as the pain in his shoulder, the ants under his skin finally begin to fade, a lost piece of grace so close to home.
Dean latches onto those words, the way they send him careening back into last night.
If anything his words make Cas even more upset. Dean bets that if he wasn't holding his wrist he would be pacing back and forth across the room like a caged animal. Instead he lets out harsh breath through his nose like he’s trying to calm himself down.
He gets the crib and buys a playpen and other necessities, trying to block that entire conversation out of his mind. Jack is slowly growing discontent with staying in his carrier and he would be due for a change and a feeding soon.
Something catches in Dean’s throat when they turn the corner and a figure comes into view. He’s in a suit, the black material shimmering in the blue light of the photobooth. His trench coat is still tucked away on the couch, abandoned in their haste.
Dean saw them every night when he slept.
Dean was put in charge of a kid he had never met before, who could already care and think for himself. Who could take an angel blade to the chest and survive. This wasn’t a baby, even if he was born yesterday.
Cas’s death is no longer an open wound, bleeding out, staining everything, but it sure is a bruise. Unnoticeable until you move the wrong way, put too much pressure on it, and then it’s all consuming.
“Oh.” She seems to regret her words, visibly recoiling in a way that's almost satisfying.
“If you're gonna change him,” Dean nearly laughs as Cas whips around to face him. Now that Dean could take a closer look, his hair was wild. It stuck up every which way, like he had been running his hands through it constantly. “Wipe a cold wipe on his stomach and then wait a couple seconds before you take off his diaper.”
“You left and I couldn't do anything about it, and all I had left of you was Jack and I just-” Cas tilts Dean’s head up gently, until green meets blue.
“Here,” Dean sounds like he gargled a handful of gravel. “Hand him over, I'm sorry I left while he was like this.” It's the most words Dean had said to Sam since before everything had happened.
.” He emphasises the words as if it would somehow change Sam’s opinion on the whole thing.
“Oh you wish? Wishing doesn't do shit, Sammy. It’s the same as praying in my book.” Dean can feel the anger growing like a fire in his chest. It’s too easy for him to just give in. To feel
He also has the trench coat in one hand and Dean sort of already misses him wearing it. Dean grabs it anyway and places it over Jack’s sleeping form the same way he does every night. He lets his finger brush the baby’s cheek.
“Then don’t.” Dean doesn't sob. He
Instead, he screams all night until Dean drags himself out of bed and lets him sleep in the newly bought bassinet, close enough that Dean could run his fingers along one tiny arm.
A connection, she claimed, and Dean just laughed.
Cas stands before him and he can’t fight, he
“Oh yeah and Claire should be here in like two hours.” That makes Dean pause. He takes a moment to let Sam’s words sink in, wondering what exactly he forgot, before he runs out of the room chasing Sam down the hall with a shout.
“Dean, you haven’t even admitted to yourself that Cas is gone.” Sam’s voice is quiet, as if he could soften the blow of the words, but it still steals his breath.
Dean gives in and slides closer to Cas, leaving Sam and Claire to their case talk. It didn't matter if Dean listened or not if he’d be sitting this one out. Claire finally wanders away from Cas and Jack to look closer at Sam’s computer.
“Of course, Missouri, I’ll be there.” Sam says, placing his gear bag on the table and throwing books in seemingly at random. He pauses at Dean’s raised eyebrow holding up a finger. “No just me. You'll probably know why as soon as I get there, so I’ll let it be a surprise till then.”
Dean is already wide awake, having spent the last two hours trying to get a colicky Jack to fall back to sleep, when Sam emerges from his room. He’s fully dressed and on the phone grinning bigger than anything Dean had seen in a long time.
Dean delicately pulls the pajamas on, after socks and a diaper, and has to hold back another sob. It's definitely something Cas picked out, a soft blue with pale yellow and black bees buzzing around. He pauses, resting his head against his burned forearm, lets the pain ground him.
Sam has slowly become more comfortable with the baby, even holds him every once in a while. But still, he has mostly kept his distance, kept to his search for a way to bring mom home. Which is why Dean is so taken aback when Sam finally speaks.
Dean stalks over to the crib ready to feel the snap of wood under his heel before it feels like he's been doused in freezing water.
One finally talks to him as he's looking through the cribs, chest aching with something he doesn't even want to think about. Jack is awake in his carrier, peering up at Dean with a curious gaze that makes Dean lean down to brush his hair back. He's pretty sure contact was good for babies.
“Okay.” Dean pointedly doesn't look at Cas, hoping that he didn't notice, what was no doubt, a long ass pause.
The way that Cas is looking at him makes Dean swallow hard, peering around nervously for something else to focus on. He turns his attention to Jack between them, his head once again laying on his arms comfortably.
This was a different kind of pain, though. This is inexpressible, his soul slipping piece by piece into corruption.
“You left me with your kid.” Dean chokes out, and gently headbutts Cas. He pulls back, sliding his hands to either side of Cas’s neck. He looks him in the eye, meets his searching look head on. “I thought I told you never to pull a stunt like that the last time you got stabbed.” Cas pulls his best bitchface, but doesn't pull away. He just lets Dean cradle him like he was something fragile.
The pain gets him caught.
At one point, while Dean had disappeared with Jack, Jody must have called because Dean returns to Cas hovering over some old lore books, his nose crinkling up as Jody laughed at him through the phone. He looks mildly offended and Dean wants nothing more than to smooth out the crease in his brow, take some of the weight off his shoulders.
Dean spent thirty years on the rack, he knows pain, he knows about your soul being flayed open, put back together only to be torn apart in some horrifyingly new way.
“It can't be too hot, just about here is right.”  Dean fills the tub just enough to reach Jack’s belly button. Cas places Jack on the counter, cushioned by a soft mat that Dean had placed there for that very reason, and starts pulling off Jack’s outer clothes.
Thank you all for reading I appreciate you so much.
The qareen lights up from the inside out, it shines from his chest, his eyes, his mouth as he screams in pain. He folds in on himself, dissolving into his core, like a star collapsing.
He reaches up to rub at the stubble on his cheek and Dean catches his hand with his own, resting them on the table between them.
Jack wakes up to Tombstone’s main menu cycling on the scene, over and over, the same song the same images flashing across the screen. The credits had ended nearly ten minutes earlier, but getting up would mean letting go.
Dean nods along, far too exhausted mentally to reply in any coherent way. It just seems par for the course at this point, Cas can sense Jack’s emotions and Jack can sense Dean’s and Dean is just lost, adrift alone and trying to figure things out on his own.
He watches Sam light it instead. He listens to him say thank you, say goodbye, teaching Jack how to mourn, how to be human. Dean watches him pour the gasoline, the silver lighter turning gold in the light of the flames, and he can't look away.
Even as they were falling asleep, Cas dressed down again and sitting next to Dean on the bed, he could feel his unwavering gaze. It was almost a comfort, as he fell asleep.
“I don't care.” Dean’s eyes snap to Cas’s in shock. “Why would I care about you messing up? You said yourself, yesterday, we’ve both made mistakes. I don't love you any less for your mistakes just like you don't love me any less for mine.” It's said with so much confidence that Dean’s heart leaps into his throat. “That’s not going to change just because we’ve admitted our love out loud.”
Cas slides down until he’s face to face with Dean, careful not to wake up Jack. His hand has slid down as well, lacing with Dean’s own over Jack’s stomach.
other than sad or empty.
He ignores Sam, marching to his room. For a moment he wishes that he could leave, run away from the bunker for a couple days. He can’t stand being stuck here.
Cas follows him silently, to Dean’s relief. He seemed to be waiting for Dean to continue, a brief glance revealing the pinched look was still marring his features.
Cas’s eyes widen with understanding, flickering widely between his own hand and Dean’s face.
beg. This monster that has stolen his face doesn't deserve to make Dean beg, doesn’t deserve to hear the pleas fall from Dean’s lips.
Cas wasn't his significant other, wasn't his boyfriend or husband, wasn't anything but a friend. But part of Dean is shattering, because he wants that so bad it's like a physical ache.
Dean wonders what she did to deserve Sam’s ire. He draws a blank. He already can’t quite remember what shade her hair is, what accent she has.
Even now that Cas was back, Dean had already fallen back into the same antagonistic behavior his father had when Mary was alive, and
He lets his arm trail all the way from Cas’s neck to his hand, tangling their fingers together and tugging him back to the impala.
Since Sam had left, Dean has taken to letting Jack sleep with him again. He would nap with the baby tucked in his sling or curled up on his chest. He spends nights in Dean’s room, the bassinet close enough to touch without getting off the bed. Even then, many nights Dean will give in and let the baby sleep on him.
“You know she doesn't think of you like that.” Cas gives Dean a look, but lets him keep his hand. “At the very least we’re like the weird uncles.” Cas moves to take his hand away, but Dean pulls him back. “No -look- Cas, you can't change what happened, but you’re doing the absolute best you can to make it up to her, now. And
“We've lost everything and now you're gonna bring him back. Okay? You're gonna bring back Cas, you're gonna bring back Mom, you're gonna bring them all back. All of them. Even Crowley.” Another pause, a breath, then two. But there's no answer. No phone call from Cas, no laugh as Crowley appears out of nowhere like the goddamn cheshire cat. Absolutely nothing and anger rises like bile at the back of his throat.
He’s alive and in Dean’s room, in Dean’s clothes, close enough that Dean can feel him radiating warmth like a furnace. Dean sways forward until his forehead lands on Cas’s shoulder, eyes falling shut as Cas threads his fingers through the hair on the back of his neck.
It almost scares him now, the thought of leaving Cas. Of walking away, of seeing
But that doesn't mean he doesn't want to. Dean wants a stiff drink with every fiber of his being. To get lost in the haze of alcohol and maybe kill a few things while he’s at it.
“You know a lot about kids.” Cas remarks and his eyes are even softer now, following Dean's motion and bending down to kiss Jack in the same spot. All at once, it’s like the breath is knocked out of Dean.
It seems like Jack hadn’t woken up again, Cas wouldn't have been able to get him off or back on Dean’s chest without waking him up, no matter how careful he was about it. This means Jack was no doubt hungry, explaining the rude awakening.
. The kid doesn't deserve his anger.
“It’s not okay.” Dean states, running a hand through Jack's hair. He ignores Sam sputtering behind him and walks to his room.
Every two hours Dean pulled over into whatever stop he could find, pulling the camping stove out of the trunk to heat the bottles of water taken from Cas’s house. With steady hands he measures out the powder into the bottle perched on the trunk of the Impala and struggles to pull himself out of the memories threatening to drown him.
Dean said yes to save his family. To save Jack and Sam and Cas, to make sure they were safe. And if he has to live the rest of his life trapped away? He was willing to pay the price.
“Change.” Dean himself turns around, willing the blush to leave as he peels off his flannel and henley. It doesn't help that he can hear Cas suck in a sharp breath, and his ears flush even more, no doubt a very unattractive shade of red.
Dean and Sam's childhood was crap, surfing from motel room to motel room, with the occasional stop at a babysitter or Bobbys. He wouldn't- no he
Instead, Dean slots his hand against the handprint of a dead man and he feels the ache. He lets the emptiness wash over him and mourns.
He remembers the bloody handprint, he hasn't managed to wash it away. It sits on a chair in his room, pushed out of his sight, but still he finds his eyes drawn to the place it is hidden without his permission.
“Dean,” The harsh gravel of Cas’s voice makes Dean’s eyes fall shut, scared of what he has to say, and more scared of him not saying anything. “I promise you I'll do everything I can to get her back.”
Mary’s gone. If she’s lucky enough she’s already dead, if not she’s stuck in a slowly dying world with at least one archangel that has it out for her specifically.
“He’s just too small to be there by himself for the night.”
Even Amara could sense it. When it had come down to it, it wasn't Amara’s name he called, it was Cas, it'll always be Cas. It was his anchor when he was lost without his memories. His last connection to Cas when he was dead and gone in the empty. It was so strong that Jack could feel it, that Jack knew he could trust them.
Kelly had a wrap, folded neatly over the crib bars, directions printed and underlined on the changing table next to it. Dean makes sure the wrap is correct and tight, keeping the baby close to his chest, high enough that he could feel his soft puffs of breath against his chest. The cloth supporting his head. He can already hear the mocking he was going to get from Sam.
Part of him wants to scream, because it
“Why are you saying all of this now?”
Dean huffs out a laugh and pulls her hair back, tucking it into the collar of her leather jacket. The same leather jacket she had liberated from Dean’s closet five months earlier.
The walk back to Jack gives him more time to let the shame settle somewhere in his chest, doubling as he walks into the main room.
Dean finds himself wandering into Cas’s room, unable to control himself as he pushes the door open. If Dean thought the nursery was bad, this is like a hit to the chest. Cas is in every inch of this room. From the rumpled bed, to the phone on the bedside table, to the single picture frame on the desk and something in Deans chest burns. He aches and hurts.
He doesn't notice that his hands have stopped moving until he feels the delicate brush of shadowy wings on the edges of his fingers.
But something about this lingers in the bunker for days.
He bundles it up and lays it on the other side of Jack, opposite to his own pillow. He has to drag a hand down his face as Jack sleepily latches onto it, tiny hands clutching one of the lapels.
Dean still doesn't sleep that night.
He looks back at the trench coat lying over the edge of the bed, and then looks back to Cas who is watching him intently. He still looks scruffy and sleep-worn in Dean’s clothes, even without having actually slept. Dean doesn't think he’s ever looked better.
Dean nearly stops breathing, it feels like a fist was squeezing his heart. Every possible scenario flashes through his head at once. The angels showing up at the front door, whatever shitheads left at the British Men of Letters tracking them down, Jack screaming loud enough to bring down the whole bunker because Dean left his line of vision.
“Makes sense. He did sleep on top of me most of the time you were….” The words get stuck in his throat.
Cas, not the one close at his side, looking up at him curiously.
Cas steps away and for a moment Dean thinks that he’s going to leave anyway, but he doesn’t. Instead he pulls Jack from Dean’s arms, leans him over his shoulder and starts to burp him, pacing around the kitchen as he goes. He’s going to get puke on his shoulder and back, but Dean lets him, leaning on the counter heavily.
The road was calming, the sense of doing something, going somewhere. Idleness never appealed to Dean, not really.
eyes watching him all the while. The whimpering has stopped now that Dean has moved closer and Dean looks at the newborn, truly looks at him.
Except it apparently
Everytime Sam tries to bring it up Dean shuts him down. He doesn't want to think about the ways he’s failed the two of them, the way he let his anger overtake him.
It was all of Dean’s feeling for Cas, bottled up into one ache that starts at his shoulder and reverberates down into his chest, echoes throughout his entire body, consumes him.
“Bedtime for the twerp.” Dean announces. He leans back so that Cas can get a clear view of how to take Jack out the car seat, one hand tucked underneath his neck and the other hefting the baby out and onto his shoulder. “Jack, too, I guess, he needs just as much beauty rest as Sam.”
Dean pulls the both of them to their feet and finally let’s Cas’s hand fall away from his shoulder, if only so he can intertwine their hands together between them.
But the way she held herself, that was all Dean. The set of her shoulder, as if she would take on the world to protect what little was hers, the quick smirk, the haunted eyes. It painted a picture that Dean didn't want to see. Held a mirror to all the ways that they had messed up her life.
“I should take it away.” The words settle in the air around him, sending a bolt of fear down his spine. He had always known it was important, it was something of Cas’s left on him, but through the years it had become one of the only things that was purely his. Something he didn't have to share with anyone else.
“Yes, Sam. Okay.” Dean finishes throwing the dish towel off to the side. “As in okay, you and Claire can take care of this one.” Sam was still looking at him as if he had grown another head. “But…” Dean watches the expression nearly fall off his face before he continues. “We’re gonna go back there one of these days, or better yet we can go to Tombstone, visit the Grand Canyon while we're out there. Jack needs to learn some of the finer things in life early.”
“We have to check this out. Dodge City is just down the road, it could be a day trip,” Dean pushed himself up from the table, gathering everyone’s plates and cups to take to the sink. “Hey, I bet we could even find a tiny cowboy hat for little Doc Holiday over there.”
Dean sees her close her eyes for a moment, sees her take a deep breath before she opens them again and leans in to get a closer look at Jack. Jack smiles back at her, his gummy smile that never fails to make something in Dean’s chest soften.
He destroys the room, tearing down the pictures, throwing the chair against the wall, knocking over the dresser, perfectly folded baby clothes scattering across the room.
Dean can’t remember the last time that he
Sometimes, Dean thinks he’s already dead. Roaming a never ending cycle of memories, but then the blackness never fails to engulf him. He’s set adrift at times, nothing to hold him down, just darkness as far as the eye can see. Voices echo, bouncing off of nothing, spiraling back to Dean, before he’s launched back into a memory, a nightmare, whatever pleases Michael at the time.
Jack starts crying and they both reach for him simultaneously, hands brushing against each other. It makes Dean flinch back, eyes bulging slightly. Cas lets Dean have him, his brow furrowed.
“It's okay,” Sam sounds nervous, his voice barely more than a whisper. Dean knows that he's the one that caused it and feels like a piece of shit. “I know you're trying to deal with this in your own time. I'm happy to help where I can.” His voice is so sincere it hurts.
“You can also put the burping rag over your shoulder and do it that way, especially if you want to walk around.” Cas nods along and watches intently as Dean gently pats Jack’s back.
“Dean, don't.” Dean ignores Sam’s voice, moving to pick up the small body on the bed. Much smaller than Dean remembered Sam being, nothing more than 5 and a half pounds at most. Sam was a big baby, who grew into a much bigger man and Dean can feel the phantom weight of him in his arms. It was far too heavy a weight for a 4 year old to carry.
It isn't until Cas pulls gently on the baby’s hand that he finally lets go. He takes Jack from Dean’s arms, their fingers brushing. It makes Dean inhale sharply.
Cas finally lets out a heavy breathe through his nose and looks away.
There’s no panic on the face of the man in the mirror. His green eyes just look confused, something like concern hidden deep.
He can hear someone shushing someone else off to his left and he buries his face farther into his pillow before peaking open one eye.
“Cas…” Dean's voice is thick, choking past the lump in his throat as Cas reaches up to grab his hand. Not moving it, just simply covering it with his own.
“You have a piece of Castiel’s grace!” Dean’s mind grinds to a halt, the words echoing in his mind dangerously. A piece of his grace. A piece of his
“Please, Cas.” Cas does nothing more than turn his face away, his eyes squeezing shut once more as if it’ll somehow make Dean go away. “Cas look at me.” And he does, blue eyes opening blearily, locking with green, but Dean can tell he still doesn't believe him. He still looks resigned to his fate, searching Dean’s face like it's the last time he’ll ever see him, but making no effort to get up.
Cas takes Dean’s silence as an admission.
That takes Dean aback, startled by the sheer honesty lacing Cas’s voice. It’s not what he thought Cas was going to say, but this almost scares him more. This truth, thrown into his face, terrifies him. Because, that cuts to the quick of things doesn't it?
It doesn’t surprise him when the blade lowers. Sam and him were always soft on each other. They could never see each other for the monster they were.
No baby crying.
They don't talk about it and, although part of Dean is scared that it will fester and drive Sam away again, he’s almost relieved. Dean knew he was being an ass, knew that he can’t do this alone
Their second kiss is just as good as the first, if not better, Cas leaning into it with a sigh. His free hand is threading through the hair on the back of Dean’s neck in a way that makes his heart somehow beat faster, makes it feel like it’s gonna come right out of his chest.
A thought strikes him and Dean glances over at the library, scanning the new couch they had placed in there. He tugs Cas with him, finger slotting together just as perfectly as they have every time.
“So he’s small enough that he needs to use a baby bathtub for now,” Dean explains turning on the shower with the handheld spout. “I try to put the tub high enough that it won't hurt my back.”
It hurts to look at the nursery. Dean can see Cas in every aspect. The crib is slightly crooked in some places, the walls a soft blue, the paint a little messy. Tiny imperfections that spoke of Cas without him even being there.
“You left me alone,” he sobs into the fabric and curls tighter around it. “How could you leave me?” He doesn't know who he's talking to. Cas is gone. Not coming back.
It didn't happen a lot of the time, especially in the beginning. Every time he closed his eyes he would be overtaken by the sight of wings burned into the ground, and blue eyes devoid of the life that made them so special. He would begin to fall asleep only to jolt awake, unsure if it was truly a nightmare or the fear of one.
When he was unsure or upset he would run his hands along it, as if Cas could feel it, as if it would somehow make him appear. It would ease the ache in his chest, calm him when he was angry. When he was halfway to damnation, the mark beating a tattoo in his head, it kept him human. It let him know that Cas wasn't Cas anymore, that Lucifer had stolen his face.
He looks up at Dean curiously, tilts his head to the side in a way that sends a wave of grief through Dean.
It's a quiet ride home.
He places a pillow on one side of Jack, but finds himself searching the room when he realizes that he only has one pillow.
Cas was going to live a happy life here and Dean would give almost anything, anything to have this for real. To carry Cas over the threshold of the bunker, Sam, Mom, Jody, and the girls laughing in the background. To fight over the colors of the nursery and what toys to get.
Dean is desperate for it to stop. He doesn't love Amara.
“Well at least you have this little one.” She reaches towards Jack who is currently fascinated with the mitten on his hand, alternating between gumming at it and waving it around. Dean has to resist the urge to smack her hand away. “A part of her will always live on through him.”
Finally he pulls back, lets their cheeks brush, stubble against stubble. Rests his forehead against Cas’s, eyes closed, feels the brush of air as Cas lets out an unsteady breath.
Dean had to be a mother and a father to Sam, and he would never be able to leave that headspace. Sam will always be Dean’s kid and Dean will always worry about him.
Dean shushes the baby, wrapping his tighter in the towel and leaning down to kiss his forehead, rubbing Jack’s arms through the towel in an attempt to warm him a little. It didn't do much to calm him, but then again, nothing would until he was dressed and warm.
He looks back towards Cas, waiting for him to back him up. Or at least sigh in that way that means, while he doesn't agree with Dean, he’s gonna go along with him anyway cause he was that good of a friend. Instead he finds Cas giving him a strangely intense look, his head tilted to the side and his eyes narrowed. Dean imagines most other people would have shit their pants at a look like that.
“Okay?” There's that voice again, one of these days Dean is just going to deck him.
So he lets Jack lean on him as he finally grows tired. Dean feels him slump over, soft hair skimming against Dean’s collar, his cheek brushing against his shoulder and it’s not right. It's a flush of grace that is too warm, too bright, too strong. It’s not evil, if anything it is calm, reassuring, like standing just a moment too long in the sun, but it's not
. He’s not drawn in, there’s no want threating to consume him, just a nauseating mixture of hate and something that thinks it’s love, but isn’t.
Sam gives him a disbelieving look but waits until Jack has passed out and Dean has managed to get him in the playpen before he speaks again.“What's the worst that can happen Dean, we're in a warded bunker and you'd be an hour away, max.”
Dean wakes with a gasp, automatically reaching towards Jack’s bassinet, his cries still ringing, only to find him missing. He spins wildly until green meets blue and feels his breath catch.
It comes out of his mouth like a confession, a secret, meant to stay between him and Jack, who lays curled up on his chest. He rises and falls with every breath Dean takes, the motion calming his most recent crying fit.
Dean knew why he never brought it up, the longing and heartache and fear mixed in with sheer relief. The nights of Cas repeating
The boy presses into Dean’s side when they sit on the couch and Dean can just as easily see Sam in his place. Oh so small and tucking perfectly into Dean, it didn’t matter how old he got. Six months, a year, twelve, even now if he ever wanted to he could probably still fit just right.
“Missouri Mosley has, what she assumes to be, a wraith attacking psychics, so I have Jody on the case.” Dean once again raises his eyebrow as his brother continues to pack.
The thing is: He could go. It might even be good for him to get away, have nothing to focus on but a hunt. This thing had to be a ghost or a shapeshifter or even a ghoul. None of those take that long, especially when they choose such a high profile look. But even thinking about leaving Jack and Cas behind after just getting everyone together made his brain heave to a stop, something like static filling up empty air.
Every moment that Cas was gone, every day he spent without him, Dean walked a tightrope. He wanted to drink but he wouldn't let himself, remembering angry words slurred out from his dad's mouth like acid. He wouldn't let anybody take Jack because he remembered the burden of caring for a baby that shouldn't be your responsibility.
It's not that he didn't know, because he
The silence in the kitchen is nearly deafening, the echo of the dishes clattering into the sink reverberating off the tiles.
Dean plucks Jack out of his car seat, carefully cradling his head and neck with his fingers. His diaper was dry, he was fed and burped, but still he cried no matter what. The only thing that seems to calm him is Dean himself, pulling him close and humming gently.
Dean could still feel Sam's grip like a vice, but nothing matters besides blue eyes and a gravelly voice uttering his name like a prayer.
Dean wanders back into the kitchen taking stock of Cas, still sitting at the table as if he has nothing better to do. He has a furrow in his brow, though, and Dean prepares himself for the inevitable.
He sits there for far too long. Long enough that he knows Sam will be looking for him. An ache has settled in his hand and he focuses on a single drop of blood sliding down his arm as he drags himself off the floor. It stains the bandages wrapped around his burns.
It’s not a surprise when Amara appears from behind it, just like it’s not hard to fight her.
a stranger.
“I can feel the love you feel, only it’s cloaked in shame.” She calls out and it falls between them like a gauntlet.
It’s like looking at a stranger. Michael wears a dark tuxedo, a bow tie tucked neatly under his chin. He’s dressed to the nines, his hair slicked back perfectly. It’s not Dean, he looks far too comfortable in his skin for it to be Dean.
“Just because you have a kid now doesn't make you my dad, too.” Dean just leaned back throwing his hands up in surrender. Claire gives him one last glare before turning to look at Sam. “So do we know what this thing is? He was some old dude right? A ghost maybe?”
Somewhere down the hall Dean hears Sam’s door slam shut with a certain finality and closes his eyes with a sigh.
Something about the Impala soothes him, maybe it was the noise or the vibrations but inevitably, when they pulled over to feed him he would start crying as the car drew to a stop.
“I bet.”
The grace is stolen, but it’s still beautiful.
A child who doesn't look like a child, who looks enough like Cas that it aches. His blue eyes peer around curiously and he is so innocent, not even a day old.
He wants to hide his face in his hands as he quickly changes out of his jeans.
It was still looking at him with those intelligent blue eyes, cradled in the crook of his arm.
“Do you want to make the bottle or do you want to hold Jack.”
(Dean
Dean moves to leave, grabbing Cas’s wrist as he passes.
So, he’s stuck in his own mind. He wanders his memories, though childhood games and laughter, through mistakes and regret, though memories of family and love. Each time one ends he finds himself in a new one, a never ending movie, his best hits.
But now, with his screaming baby tucked against his chest and the person he loves staring at him with questions in his eyes, he just
Dean turns around and comes face to face with Cas, close enough that he instinctively grabs his hip to steady himself, fingers brushing along worn fabric.
He latches onto that longing as if it’ll save him, like it’ll make the thoughts stay put for just a moment so he can actually
Dean opens his mouth and nothing comes out. He swallows harshly and decides, for the first time possibly ever, there was no way out of this besides honesty, to make Cas see just how stupid it was to love him.
Dean can see Sam’s growing frustration with the baby, he had never dealt with one besides Bobby John, and even then he had left most of it to Dean. Sam has never really had to take care of a baby this small before.
Dean can never leave for long anyway, the same gnawing fear pulling him back.
A pair of wings searing themselves into their final resting place.
Dean knows Sam still feels guilty over their mom’s death, over Jess’s, Madison’s, Amy’s, Kevin’s. The hundreds of people they’ve failed to save, the thousands they’ve put in danger just by existing. Sam blames himself for everything and Dean is doing nothing but giving him more blame. Another sin to weigh down his soul.
Dean finally lets go of Cas’s wrist and pushes himself off the table with a heavy sigh.
, his mind supplies, but the thought leaves his mind before he can voice it. It slips through his fingers and he feels frustrated for a beat.
Dean wanders the aisles of the store and ignores the cooing of the women wandering alongside him. Once or twice he swears the same woman passes by him just to look, ignoring whatever was in the aisle he was in, high chairs or some crap like that.
Dean stands there, his chest aching and his hands cold.
He should have known he wasn't in the headspace to talk to Sam, especially after the various fights they have had over every small thing. Sam refuses to leave the bunker either, possibly thinking he’s helping Dean or maybe just trying to get on his nerves.
stops. They never stop
“I can get a general sense of his emotions most of the time.” Dean whips around to look at Cas. “Like right now, he likes the warm water, but he’s also slightly hungry so we should hurry.” Cas continues as if he didn't just drop a bomb on Dean.
“If I were to leave again how would you feel.” Dean sucks in a strangled breath, imagining Cas walking away. It's all of his worst fears come true. Dean’s knees are weak and he has to lean against the table behind him. Jack is still screaming in his arms and Dean just doesn't
“When is Mary getting back?” Dean's body freezes, the floor drops out from under him - because
fight.
Cas’s mark is the purest part of Dean. It’s love and faith and everything he thought he could never be, never have. It was a tether between him and one of the only truly good things in his life.
“You think I’m going on another hunt.” Sam sounds incredulous, eyes narrowed in a way that Dean knew means trouble.
Dean quickly makes his escape, unease and grief growing stronger with every word she spoke.
Cas has him already, of course. He is tucked against his chest, safe. His wings are out, a testament to just how upset he is, stretching and folding, sparking a dangerous gold where Cas is brushing his fingers through them. It reminds Dean of his nightmare, fire crawling up tanned skin and dark pants. It's enough that he grabs Cas’s hand, stopping his path, pulling him away from the baby's wings. He twines their fingers together, curled back up on his side, nearly a perfect mirror to the night before, his face is buried in Cas’s side.
go,” His voice is like gravel as he leans his forehead against Dean’s. “I’ll go with you.” Dean lets out a shaky breath and feels Cas’s lips brush against his own.
Being close to him makes Dean’s skin crawl as a desperate sense of wrongness settles in his bones.
Dean stumbles into the room, not startling Cas but making him glance up with a soft smile anyway. Jack is distracted by now, chewing on the horn of his moose while You Shook Me slides into D’yer Mak’er in the background.
Irony sits like a lead weight in Dean’s stomach as he walks up the front steps of Cas’s house. It makes his stomach roll, bile climbing up his throat and he buries his nose in Cas’s hair.
“Yeah, well, if we're going to play the blame game here I think I have you beat.” Dean replies, his hands clenching the edge of the countertop. “Who was the one who took the Mark of Cain? Who agreed to let Amara out in the first place? Who gave Lucifer a way to manipulate not only Sam, but you too? Who didn’t help you track down Lucifer? Who pushed you away instead of agreeing to help keep Kelly and Jack safe?” Dean’s voice grew slightly, his fingertips aching from how hard they were digging into the granite of the counter.
The first couple of hours, Dean just putters around the bunker, Jack perched in his arms, putting away the various baby things they had taken from Cas’s house.
Dean finds he can’t finish that thought. Instead, he finishes dressing Jack and heads out of the bedroom to the kitchen. He needs something to do with his hands, some excuse to look away, to not have to stare Cas in the face and tell him that he failed
Dean shifts, ready to pull Cas in—because
Dean tries to put it out of his mind. At first by trying to go out and have a good time, but that ended with a fit of nausea when she pulled away long enough to start kissing down his neck.
The next fic will be a little sad still and will mainly deal with Cas learning how Dean was while he was gone and how he reacts to it along with some insight into Jack’s powers and his angel side.
This was the place Cas wanted to make his home. Dean saw the nursery, the toys, the rooms.
It’s a devastating mixture of the two that surrounds Dean. They’re looped around him, a hand on his chest and another wrapped around his waist, pulling him closer with a hidden strength that makes Dean’s bones creak. He can see Cas out of the corner of his eye. Truly
Cas had said this didn't change anything, but it did. It had to, because Cas loves him. He isn't worried about how other people can use that against him, how

“I said change.” Dean picks up his clothes and throws them in the hamper across the room before walking back over to Jack’s bassinet. “If you want Jack to sleep at all tonight you're going to have to hand over the trenchcoat.” He listens to the shuffling behind him and tucks jack in. Sometimes, if Jack was particularly colicky, Dean would have to swaddle him like a little burrito, but tonight he’s already half asleep. He reaches out for Dean's hand as he pulls up the pale yellow blanket. Dean smiles down at Jack, leans over to kiss his forehead gently, suddenly overcome with affection for him.
because of them. He can't risk revealing his feelings and then losing this. He can't love Cas and fight with him, he can't see him walk away, can't see him get hurt.
“Cas.” It’s a word. A name he thinks. Something important, something that he’s forgotten. It’s significant in that it’s absence creates a hole in his mind where it should be.
Dean wakes up to the angel still sleeping on his chest. Taking the opportunity to look at the angel without passing judgement, he looks closely at the angels tan skin. Even though Castiel is a warrior of heaven, there are barely any scars visible above the neck. It puzzles Dean, not because he has a lot, but because he was
“Thanks but it’s just Sam, and I’m really just a regular run of the mill hunter. My brother though, he uh he’s pretty good.”
“Dean, it’s five o’clock. We haven’t even had dinner yet.”
“Hey sunshine.”
“Guess we don’t have to worry about that anymore,” the hunter said, pulling away from him.
This wasn’t uncommon in their relationship. It was just one more way to communicate and he knew that she would understand his pain. But, he didn’t want to kill the honeymoon buble that they had been living in up until Dean’s departure.
“Yes?”
The sky was beginning to look like a meteor shower, Sam was in bad shape but could tell that something chaotic was happening. “What’s going on?” he groaned, “The angels. They’re falling.” Cas. I could feel my heartbeat begin to speed up and Sam looked worse and worse. “Cas!” No answer. “Cas!” I began to pray silently as I yelled out for the angel. Cas, wherever you are, I need you here. Sam is in real bad shape and and the angels there falling. Have you fallen? Oh god Cas, be careful wherever you are. Silence filled the air, Sam had passed out now and he began to scream “Castiel!” He couldn’t lose his brother and his best friend all in one day. Picking his brother up, he put him in the Impala and drove him to the hospital. Carrying him into the waiting room he yelled for the final time that night.
His emotions were all over the place, was Dean saying that he loved, loved him back? That he wanted to be with him?
“No, he said that it was for you, but he also killed the thing and said that when he did, it burned away my grace as well. So, I am human, yes.”
When he first laid eyes on the righteous man’s soul in hell he was lost, he was lost without any sense of direction, but he didn’t want to be found. Dean’s soul shone brighter than any he had ever encountered, it called out to him in a secret language that was all its own. Even after he’d been to hell, purgatory, and become a demon, the man’s soul was
“Cas if you don’t go find my brother and have a heart to heart right now, I’ll drown you in holy oil. Go.” “Right. Thanks again”
After a stern lecture about
The angel begins to stir and he turns around in Dean’s arms preparing for conflict. Nostril’s flare and a low growl escapes his throat, “What do you want Crowley? A thank you?”
“Are you going to stand there or are you going to help?”
that you loved me. I’ve known all along, what I didn’t know. God, I denied it for so long. Was that
to see those pretty green eyes again.” “I have to take care of my little brother, sorry.” “Hmm I love a sensitive guy” pulling out a piece of paper she handed it to him “here’s my number feel free to call or text any time.” He nodded politely before shoving the piece of paper in his pocket, he wasn’t going to text or call her but he wasn’t going to be rude. Satisfied she walked away, relieved to not be bothered anymore he pulled out his pencil to attempt to learn something. A dark haired boy took the seat next to him but he barely noticed. He waited for him to ask him if he was new or something but instead he just looked intensively at his book. Okay. Odd, most people either gawked at him or at least introduced themselves to him. Wondering what this dude’s deal was he remembered the name. Castiel, seems fitting.
Opening his eyes, he frowns, it must have been a dream. Still on the couch, Dean is beside him snoring softly. The TV screen is blank and there is a blanket thrown on top of him, he slowly realizes he’s half way on top of Dean. If awake, the hunter would surely protest. Moving slowly he tries to inch off of the other man, much to his surprise his body is 75% back to normal. He can move more freely without a sharp pain halting him every second. The dream he had of him confessing the truth about the warehouse is slowly fading, confirming that it was indeed a dream. What doesn’t fade are Dean’s words to him in the warehouse. It was true, Castiel was in love with Dean, but he couldn’t risk the loss of the only family he had left. In the dream, Dean had felt the same way, but that’s all it was, a
from you. I meant what I said about loving you, but now,” A sharp pain was radiating through his chest and he didn’t know if he could say the next part. “Now. I need to love myself so that nobody else has to. And
Dean's POV
Running his hands up and down Cas’s muscular thighs he licks his lips, and his angel groans. Moving back up he pulls the t-shirt over Cas’s head. “Ugh.
“Stop” he said to himself.
Sliding his tongue into Dean’s mouth, the angel smiles against the hunters mouth and moves to where his ass is on Dean’s crotch. Grinding up and down he starts to move in rhythm with his hunter, soon his pants are uncomfortable. He pulls away again but this time, out of confusion, “Dean. I’m uncomfortable, these pants are starting to hurt my genitals.”
“Do you want to sit up front?”
“Great,” he smiles at her remembering a bar down the road. “I think there’s a bar up the road. They have good fries.”
“Sure, thanks.”
A strong hand is shaking him awake, “Cas wake up. You were having a nightmare.” Sam’s hazel eyes are above him lined with worry and understanding. “It’s okay it was just a dream. You okay?” A nightmare? No, he had to take this as something more,
He nods but remains tense. She turns on the radio and Drake blasts through the speakers.
“Can you walk?” Dean looked concerned. Waiting on the illusion to end and the empty to begin mocking him again.
Allie left regardless of Noah’s words and is weeping in the car. Pulling over she stops to read the letters.
Dean unrolls his silverware and begins to cut up his waffles and applies butter to it before pouring the syrup on it. Cas looks puzzled, so Dean stabs a piece of the waffle and hands it him instructing him to try it. Chewing thoughtfully he considers the flavor, “It’s good.”
How the empty had recreated this, however, was the real mystery. It was something that was unique to Dean Winchester. He was so in tune to his soul that any movement of it within fifty feet called out to him.
“Hun I know that’s not true. It’s my dazzling personality you like not just my new smoking body.” “Exactly.” Now they were looking at each other with heart eyes and leaning in to kiss. “Alright I’m done, have fun kids. Use protection.” Both of them pulled away to roll their eyes at him, now he had to find his boyfriend. “Cas? Baby? Look I’m sorry. You know it doesn’t matter to me if you’re a man, I love your vessel. It’s who I fell in love with and I wouldn’t want it any other way. Okay?” “Dean, I’m not upset I just got an idea is all. If I could move myself to a woman’s vessel then we could have children correct?” He hadn’t given that much thought. “Uh sure yeah I don’t see why not, but I wouldn’t want to look at another vessel for that long. I like you as you are.” “Oh, I just thought it was a solution.” “It is and it’s a good one, but your grace is still fading and what would happen if you moved into another vessel and you became human? More than that what about the woman you would be possessing?” “You’re right, I never think about things that way. You’re so smart love.” “Do you really want kids right now? I mean I would love nothing more than to settle down with you in the suburbs but with my line of work I don’t see how that is possible.” “Can’t you retire? You’ve done more than your civic duty Dean, you deserve to have the apple pie life too.” Never had he thought of it that way. “I guess but um there are still monsters out there, and that will never change.” “I know but there are other hunters as well, and if something happens to pop up in our neighborhood then you go and kick its ass. Now you just won’t go out looking for it. Well maybe on holidays if you still need to every now and then but I want to come on every case, deal?” “Are we planning a future together?” “I believe we are. But what will we do for money?” “I can always get a job as a mechanic and you can do whatever you want to do or I can steal credit cards. Whatever you want.” “Someone will have to stay at home with the children, and you’re so much better with kids than I am. How about we take turns huh? I do it one week and you the next?” “Sounds like a game plan to me.” “Good.” He leaned in to kiss him and stroke his hair, “I can’t wait to start a life with you. I can hear you singing lullaby’s to the babies now.” “Hmm, but Dean I don’t know any.” “Me either, Mom always sung Hey Jude to me and Sammy. It did the trick well enough.” “She was a very good mother, and you will be an excellent father.” “Thanks babe, but not as good as you. Tomorrow we can go looking for houses if you want.” “What’s wrong with the bunker?” He raised his eyebrows, really? “Don’t worry I’m only kidding. I’d never dream of raising our children here although it would be the safest place for them.” “They’ll be safe as long as there with us.” There was a knock on the door that interrupted their moment and he groaned. “What?!” “Hey um not to listen in or anything but I couldn’t help but over hear your little predicament. And you two having children is possible. Mix you guy’s sperm together and then implant a female, or ya know your big bro in a female vessel. Just something to think over.” “What? Does Sam know that you’re offering this?” “Yes, he’s the one who recommended it when I told him that you two we’re planning a family.” “Sorry Gabe but this whole thing is just weird don’t you think so Cas?” “No Dean actually it’s a very good idea indeed.” “Great, I’m glad you think so baby bro because it’s already done! Your swimmers are planted in me right now. Coming up in two to five months a baby!! Baby Winchesteriel.” “What the hell Gabe? We were talking about in the future! Not now!!! Cas get your brother sister out of here before I punch him.” “Dean don’t he’s not lying he’s carrying our child. I know it’s sudden but we can’t go back now.” “What do you mean we can’t go back? Where did he get the egg for it?” “No need for an egg when you’re a badass archangel. Bye now!” “Cas this isn’t over go get your brother so we can talk about this some more.” “Dean we did want kids right? Why wait?” “Because I-I’m not ready yet.” “It won’t be here for another couple of months. We have some time to adjust.” “The bunker isn’t ready to have a baby in it. We’d have to baby proof, buy a baby bed, clothes, the whole works!” “I know, I know it’s a big step but we’ve waited this long and it feels like we wasted a lot of time. I don’t want to waste any more time. I want this now, but I understand if you’re not ready just yet.” “No, of course I’ll be ready. We’re doing this together, so I’ll be ready for anything.” Another knock on the door interrupted them a second time, but this time it was Sam. “I hear congratulations are in order!” “Yes, they are. You’re going to be a dad congratulations!” “Just because Gabriel is carrying you guy’s baby doesn’t mean I’m the father. We haven’t even said I love you yet, man but I am so excited to be an uncle!” “Yeah good ol Uncle Sammy which reminds me I’m retiring due to settling down with my angel, but something pops up around here we’ll tackle it, anything else you’ll be flying solo. I would ask you to retire as well but I doubt that will happen.” “Actually Dean, Gabe and I are working a case right now. I didn’t want to interrupt your honeymoon phase but there was a ruguru attack a couple of towns over. Don’t worry about it we already handled it.” This wasn’t not anything new, but at least he had an archangel in his back pocket. “Good job Sammy. Just be careful.” “Always am.” When he left and they were alone again he smiled before grabbing his angel’s face, “We’re going to be a family.” Their kiss was slow and tender. “Come on, let’s go watch some Game of Thrones.” “Okay.” Interlocking hands they headed into the living room where Sam and Gabe were as well. “Hey make room.” Gabe moved to sit in Sam’s lap and he had to hold back with a sly remark instead he sat down and pulled Cas on his lap as well. “Start it over, Cas and Gabe haven’t seen the first episode.” Sam went to the pilot episode on the DVR and the marathon began.
