! He thinks, horrified, and feeling spun out. He knew Castiel could be violent—he’d seen that up close already—but the man had been relentless last night. It was like seeing his alpha side for the first time and Dean wasn’t ashamed to say he wasn’t still scared shitless from witnessing it. Who wouldn’t be?
It was terrible how quickly you could get used to something, Dean mused as he stared around the empty bedroom. Already the walls, with their weird leaf and vine wallpaper, were becoming familiar. By Dean’s estimate he’d been there for nearly a week now, though it was truly impossible to tell. There was no clock in the room, and much to his surprise no windows. Worse, Meg had straight-out refused to tell him how long it’d been, or even the time of day the last time she’d visited! “Sorry Dean-o, it ruins the vibe, ya know?” It was, in one word, maddening. Dean had sulked after she had left, but in a twisted way he got it. Castiel was all about mind games and getting things his way. Dean didn’t know what kind of hold Cas had over Meg but he was beginning to suspect she was just as much a prisoner as he was.
Dean loses some time sniffling out his fear and pain to the stillness of the night, but eventually he finds he absolutely must move. His bladder is aching for release and as much as he doesn’t want to get up the prospect of Castiel coming back to find Dean’s wet the bed like a pup isn’t one the omega is willing to consider.
“Oh.” The boy looked disappointed as Sam came up to the counter to pay. “He was in here earlier this week but he didn’t look like he was feeling good. He was shaking and he spilled coffee all over the place.” He rang up the coffee. “That’ll be $2.48.”
“Okay--I’ll be right back!” Castiel said with a grin, and pulled away. It didn’t take long for him to be swallowed up in the crowd as he headed towards the bar. Dean watched him go for as long as he could, and once he was out of sight he dropped his head down into his hands. “Oh god, you gotta get it together Winchester!” He groaned out loud to himself. “Everything is going well. It’s all going to be okay!” At least he hoped it would be. Hopefully some liquid courage would help things go smoother. Dean didn’t know about Castiel but he was vested in the night going well...
Just when he was starting to safe, when it seemed certain that there was no way Asmodeus could catch him, Gabriel let his guard down. It was a mistake; he risked a glance in the rear view, just one, but it was enough. Asmodeus was right there, back in the middle of the road when Gabe looked up but it was too late. He hit the brakes and the squealing of tires rent the air but there was no way the car was going to stop in time. Gabriel screamed as the car plowed right through Asmodeus like he was made of nothing more than smoke before coming to a violent, abrupt halt several feet down the road. For several long, agonizing seconds Gabriel sat frozen, body rigid. His hands still clutched the steering wheel tightly, his knuckles turning white from the force. What the hell was he supposed to do now? He needed to get out and check out the damage, not just to the car--and oh god, Cas was going to kill him if he damaged the car!--but to Asmodeus as well. Gabe wasn’t a doctor by any stretch of the imagination but he knew there was no way the guy could have survived being hit like that.
He hits the back hall at a dead run, finally past the point of caring if anyone sees, and judges him, cause fuck them. He bursts through the men’s room door, hands already fumbling with his zipper only to come to an ungraceful skidding halt just inside the doors. “The fuck?” He mumbles, far too drunk and desperate to fully process what he’s seeing, or rather
Dean averted his eyes from the mirror, not wanting to see his face as he recalled what had come next. It had been like something straight out of those omega abuse movies they made pups watch in school. Castiel’s eyes had flashed alpha red and before Dean could react he had lunged across the table at him. From there things had gotten foggy though Dean was certain he had hit his head on the table when Castiel knocked him and his chair over. The alpha had wielded fists and slurs with accuracy and Dean had been trapped. He shuddered, fingers coming up to gently probe the line of bruises decorating his jaw.
“Hello Gabriel,” The man greeted, not at all perturbed by the look of building outrage on Gabriel’s face. “Please don’t worry, I come in peace.” The guy's lips twitched like he had said something funny and was trying not to laugh.
Chapter warning: This chapter contains MAJOR CHARACTER DEATH, Castiel hallucinating before his deal comes due, depictions of Hellhounds that may be upsetting, and Castiel being taken to hell.
Liquid fire rushes through Dean’s veins as his heart clenches in his chest. His inner omega is screaming inside him and there;s nothing he can do. Nothing will help. The bite is unending and unwanted; it’s the worst violation Castiel could have inflicted on him. The rapes had destroyed his body and mind but this? The bite destroyed Dean down to his very soul. Before he passes out fully Dean feels that deeply treasured part of him inside die, engulfed in flames . . .
Without ever really realizing it the world for Dean narrowed down to that bright light. The cries and screams of the damned, the fire and smoke, the unrelenting demons, all of it slowly faded away. All that remained was the light; it flicked occasionally but it seemed to beckon to him in a way he couldn’t deny. Whatever it was it had a pull to it, a desperate need that hooked Dean like a tether that pulled him ever closer. He didn’t even realize he was nearly upon it until he was literally right there and the light was right there, close enough to touch.
“Don’t give me that dirty diaper look Cassie!” Gabriel taunted, “I could hear you thinking all the way over there! You should be thanking me for breaking you out of your funk!” He crossed his arms over his chest in a way he’d definitely gotten from their mother as he waited to see what Castiel would reply. It was a move that always drove Castiel absolutely crazy and he knew it--a fact proven when one eyebrow raised in challenge.
Dean paused, giving Benny a thoughtful once-over as he pretended to think about it. “I dunno,” he finally said, doing far better at keeping himself in check than Benny. “You’d probably have to lose the beard and the ‘tude at the very least, but yeah. I can picture it.”
After a veritable lifetime of hunting one would expect Castiel to be used to waking in strange places with little memory of how he’d gotten there. While that was the case normally Castiel was fairly sure waking up to pitch blackness was a new experience even by his standards. “What the?” He muttered as he brought a hand up to rub at his eyes...only to hit it upon a hard surface before he could even get there. What the hell? He palmed the surface, shocked to discover it felt like wood. What was going on here? Dropping his hand he squirmed around the best he could, his confusion only mounting when he encountered the wooden surface on all sides. What
The chapter picks up a few hours after the previous one left off; Meg drugged Dean after his bath. Castiel comes into the room and rapes Dean. During it he knots Dean and forces a mating bite on Dean. Dean breaks down afterwards.
He thought, watching wide-eyed as Castiel scented him. Considering how utterly terrified Dean was in the moment there was no way in hell he smelled of anything other than the rancid scent of fear.
The fourth wall, what he could see of it, looked to be unfinished stone that someone had painted over with a deep yellowish gold color. A heavy brown curtain hung down one side of it, possibly covering a window. The bed was directly behind him--one of those fancy modern looking ones with just a thin headboard and cream and dark colored bedding. It was the only piece of furniture he could see in the room, and not for the first time Dean had to wonder just what in the hell had happened to him. Was this a joke? Who the fuck would go through all the trouble just to kidnap him in the first place?
It was cold comfort, however, considering Dean had to bury the man back into the ground again. He found himself still frowning as he went back to the body and picked it up, pleased to find it warm to the touch and very much alive. “I’m sorry about this,” He offered in pity condolence as he lowered the man’s body back down into the awaiting box. The human didn’t even stir, to which Dean found himself utterly thankful. He didn’t want the poor guy to wake like this; it was bad enough he’d be doing so from inside the box. Unable to handle the slew of unfamiliar emotions churning through him, Dean stood and turned before snapping once more. He didn’t turn to look afterwards; he didn’t want to see the way the earth had returned to its previous state like there wasn’t a man six feet down waiting to wake. No, Dean had seen enough. His job now done; he unfurled his tawny wings and took flight. It was time to go home.
Castiel scoffs in response, shaking his head. “Do I look like I’m stupid?” He asks rhetorically. “You think you’re gonna grow a pair and take it from me? All you have to do is say the word Dean. We can end this right now. We’re going to go and have a little talk, you and I,” His blue eyes slid between the brothers. “And I won’t even hurt Sammy, how about that?”
“Damn, kid!” Benny exclaims some long minutes later, still chuckling between the words. “I haven’t laughed that hard in a while!” He reached out, his large hand heavy and warm where it pats against Dean’s shoulder in a friendly gesture. “I didn’t bring anything because I wasn’t sure you’d be up to eating but I think we have time to swing around someplace before I drop you off.”
Dean glanced left, past Garth and the other angels lined up behind him to find Mary’s garrison  and her seconds, Jody and Donna, watching him. They were rewarded with the same shaky grin he’d given Sam before he looked away again. Bobby and his garrison were to the right of them, and Dean didn’t need to look to feel the judgemental gaze coming off of John. How they’d managed to talk him into stepping down for a job as big as this was beyond Dean. He was sure it hadn’t gotten down quietly, and was intimately glad he hadn’t been party to that decision.
Just because he didn’t attempt to pick up someone at every place they stopped didn’t mean Cas was a prude! If you asked him Castiel would say it meant his brother was nothing but a horn dog and----
“You don’t know how Clarence can be.” Meg replied quietly, sounding resigned. Her scent was sad which made Dean’s nose wrinkle from the offending odor. “If I had tried to leave or call the cops or whatever else you think I’d be the one in that bed, not him.” She sighed, the sound long and deep. It echoed in the small confins of the room. “Look, I’m not saying I haven’t made mistakes here because obviously I have but that’s not the point. Are you going to help me with him or not?”
Eyes fully back on the road, Castiel smirked. He may have cheated a bit since he’d asked Sam’s opinion earlier on what an appropriate date would be to have with Dean. He was glad to see the younger Winchester had given him sound advice regarding his brother’s love of food. Castiel had been skeptical at best since most omegas didn’t like to eat as much as Sam had assured him Dean did. “Shall we then?” He asked, wanting to be absolutely sure before they went through the hassle of getting into the building. Privately, he was pleased that Dean was on-board with his club idea even if it had taken some creative bribing to get him there. He wouldn’t have said anything if Dean had been fully against it, of course, but Castiel preferred when things went according to his plans.
Gabriel didn’t even know what he was supposed to say to that. Instead he just gaped, barely even rousing when the waitress reappeared with his coffee and food. He managed to toss out his thanks but all his attention was on the angel, notably, of whom the waitress didn’t even seem to notice. In fact, it was so disturbing Gabriel found himself fixing said angel with an exasperated look before blurting out: “Seriously? Am I the only one seeing you right now?”
When Dean finally rises from the depths again it’s to the sound of voices around him. They’re closer this time and it takes a good few seconds before Dean realizes that along with them there’s also hands that are touching him.
— “Dean?” Castiel’s deep rumble breaks into his thoughts suddenly leaving the omega blinking in surprise.  Whoops! There he went again, losing his damned mind all because of Castiel… Dean coughed feeling the tell-tale flush of embarrassment spreading hot across his face and neck. He’s suddenly grateful that they chose to wait until later to go because the dim light as the sun fades away is now working in his favor.
"You okay there, hombre?" The cheerful guy in the front--Garth, he'd said his name was--asked as he glanced in the rear view mirror at Dean. "You look like you're in need of some serious cheering up! Is there anywhere else you want to stop first?"
“You know we can’t do that.” Castiel spoke up, his voice a strangled mix of sad and frustrated. “Dean said Asmoudeus needs to be stopped and we’re the only ones who can do so. We can’t let him do to someone else what he did to you.” The ‘and me’ remained unspoken but it hung like a noose in the air between the two of them.
Dean whimpers and moans, but he does slit his eyes open obediently. Just like before the green eyes were glassy from the fever and don’t really seem to look at her. He whimpers again, the sound of pure misery as the heady scent of slick hits Meg’s nose. Giving up on prosperity she wrinkles her nose at the smell, just barely refraining from making a comment that she knows won’t be appreciated. “Let’s give the bath a try, okay?” She says instead, wondering how this is her life. “Can you stand?”
Cold, hard reality slams home as the sharp burn in Dean’s ass increases tenfold. Castiel’s knotting him, he thinks horrified, before he’s plunged over the cliff. While he was doing his best to ignore what was happening Castiel had stroked him to hardness alongside his own. Now Dean comes screaming Castiel’s name, high and beyond horrified. The keening sound is high and reedy, full of all the agony Dean’s feeling in his body and soul. He’s just barely come back down when he feels it: the pinprick drag of sharp canines over the left side of the neck before Castiel is biting down hard. Agony explodes behind Dean’s eyes for the second time in as many seconds and this time he loses himself over to it. Castiel is fucking
He’d been up less than two hours and already the day felt like it was going to last forever. Castiel had never imagined he’d see Dean again and so he certainly wasn’t prepared to wake up to find the angel right there in his hotel room, less than ten feet from his bed! To say it’d been a shock was an understatement, though it had nothing upon finding out that somewhere along the line his angel and his brother had gone and become BFFs! Castiel grit his teeth just reliving the memory:
him, grunting harder and harder as he chases his pleasure at Dean’s expense. His stomach turns; horror and grief waging a battle for his soul as he closes his eyes and hopes for it to end.
Dean thought, his mind nothing but a giant flat-line. His entire body was a confused mixture of deferring signals that he had little hope of decoding. All at once he wanted to run down the street screaming at the top of his lungs. He wasn’t overly friendly with his neighbors but surely someone would hear the racket and come to help? On the flip side Dean wanted to cower and submit, wanted to curl up in a little ball and hope like hell Cas didn’t feel like hurting him anymore.
Sadly, it doesn’t help. Castiel’s hands shoot out and become two vices clamping onto Dean’s hips, restricting any further movement. Before Dean can protest, or wrap his mind around what’s happening here, he’s being bent forward at an awkward angle. “Cas!” He gasps as his face is shoved forward into the tiny space between the wall and the water pipes that connect to the urinal. “What the hell!?” Dean struggles but it’s futile; Castiel’s body has become a heavy weight behind him pinning him in place.
He didn’t even register getting back into the car, or even driving. It was just like between one blink and the next the world had shifted around him and instead of a brick alleyway Castiel found himself at a dirt crossroads. Night had fallen somewhere along the way, casting everything in shadows but that was fine by Castiel. There was no need for daylight in what he was about to do.
“If you’re sure about it chief,” Benny simply sounded resigned; this was a conversation they’d had more than once in the past and he’d never managed to win one yet. Feeling awkward hovering there he turned and sunk down on the steps beside Dean. He knew they were getting off schedule, but if Dean didn’t care then just this once Benny found he didn’t care either.
“You won’t mess anything up darling!” Balthazar laughed, the sound echoing in their narrow alleyway. “Really, this fretting isn’t like you! We both know you aren’t a virgin so what’s the problem, hmm?” The taller man leaned sideways, trying to meet Gabriel’s eyes again. “I’ve never seen you like this.” He noted, “I assure you nothing bad is going to happen. You’re going to have a delightful time; I can guarantee it!”
Gabriel… The thought of his brother bolstered him enough into sitting upright in the seat as hope slowly began to fill his chest. Castiel may have only gotten a year for himself but Gabriel was alive! That was worth anything, even the looming fear of Hell, and suddenly the only thing Cas wanted was to see him. He needed to see for himself that his brother was safe and sound; he didn’t think he'd truly settle until he did.
Dean rolls his eyes in response but his heart warms at hearing Benny’s casual dismissal like that. He knows he won’t get into too much trouble—he is the second lead after all—but Benny could reap the fallout for them both. The fact that the beta is willing to do so just for Dean’s personal comfort warms him to his toes. “We gotta make sure to get you something as well.” He declares; if Benny’s making sure he gets fed then he’s darn well going to make sure Benny gets something to eat as well.
Ah-ha! There! Two houses down from where he’s standing there’s yet another privacy fence, though unlike the others it’s not been painted and is quite worn. Sam had given the place a berth when he went running past the first time, a general sense of unease guiding him, but now he found himself edging closer. Aside from the complete lack of a paint job to Sam’s amazement there’s also something that doesn’t fit in laying right in front a section of the fence: a bright blue tarp puffed up into a suspicious sized lump.
"Holy shit!" He swore, voice choked with an emotion he couldn't name. That had been far, far too close for comfort! He shuddered, feeling ready to tremble apart right then and there. What the fuck was all this? Surely it was a dream, right? Though the more he considered it, the more Gabriel doubted it was. He had a creative imagination, sure, but he couldn't ever recall having a dream anything like this before! "Get a grip, man!" He told himself as he looked up...only to freeze. The man was standing in the road again.
Just like that Dean felt all his complaints shrivel up and die in his throat. Mouthing off to Bobby was one thing; standing up to John was a different one. Namely, he could get away with the one and not the other. Dean sighed, resigned, and hung his head. He didn’t want to do this but it seemed like he was getting absolutely no say in the matter. “Kay,” He finally muttered at length, defeated. He just hoped he would be able to survive…
“It’s going to be okay Dean.” Sam says, proud of the way his voice doesn’t crack with all the emotion he feels. “I promise. I’m going to make sure everything is okay.” More than anything he must believe it to be true. Come hell or high-water Sam’s determined his brother will be okay. One way or the other.
He thought, and mentally shrugged his shoulders as he started down the street. The houses were further apart here with most surrounded by large privacy fences that varied in color. Why anyone needed a privacy fence when the houses were already set quite a distance from the main road, Sam had no idea. Nor had he realized they came in so many colors. He tore past one in white, then another in yellow, and further down was one in green, another in blue, and so on.
Castiel closed his eyes against the sudden rush of pain surging through him at the demon’s words. He’d foolishly hoped there’d be some way to break the contract before his time came due but that was no longer an option now. He gave himself five long seconds to mourn the life he was willingly throwing away before he opened his eyes again. Meeting the demon’s fiery red gaze again he finally surrendered. Before he could let himself think about what he was doing Castiel found himself kissing the demon full on the lips. It was a filthy kiss; it tasted like sulphur and death, but Castiel gave as good as he got, making it battle for every inch of dominance. It was stupid considering he’d sealed his fate as surely as they sealed their lips but he’d never been one to back down.
Dean thinks, panting for air that feels too thin as it scrapes into his lungs. He’s sprawled out the best he can on the cool tile of the bathroom floor, face down, but he’s as far from comfortable as he can get. His skin pricks with the barest touch; even the gentle current of air as it circulates is too much to bare. He’s sweating and shivering and god, how can this be happening now? He’s not quite far enough gone to not know what this is--it’s a heat, has to be--but why now? Dean doesn’t know for sure since it isn’t like there’s calendars laying around but he thinks he still had a month or so to go until his next one.
Hannah beams at him, their mango sunshiny scent growing more pronounced at Dean’s words. “That’s right! I’ve seen you and your alpha here before.” They confirm with a relieved smile that feels a tad out of place considering the way Dean still hurts. “Is he here with you?”
Sam swung a punch though thanks to Dean’s quick reflexes he just barely grazed his brother’s shoulder. “I’m telling him it’s all your fault!” Sam declared before he was suddenly taking off across the lot at high speed. Unlike his brother he had never been late and he didn’t intend to start now!
“Thanks.” Dean snorted though his heart wasn’t in it to retort Benny’s claim. All hurting aside, he was tired. He was vaguely sure he had passed out somewhere around 1:00 a.m. though it hadn’t been a peaceful slumber. He had a hazy notion of tossing and turning but all that really stuck out were the weird dreams he’d had. Castiel had featured prominently in most of them, and while the details had slipped out of Dean’s head as soon as he’d woken he was left feeling unsettled. Biting back a yawn he tried, and failed, to shoot Benny a smile. “I think I’ll nap on the way there today.” It was unusual considering Dean’s normal ride consisted of inhaling caffeine like he’d die without it, but he
Between one blink and the next the illusion shattered; the woman looked no different than from before, though now she did look a bit bored. “Well, that all depends on you there, handsome.”
“Dean.” The alpha says, his voice barely more than a gravely gargle. There’s blood leaking from his mouth to match all the blood that’s seeped into his shirt. His hands are pressed against his stomach where the gun must have gone off but even as Dean watches blood wells up underneath Castiel’s fingers. “Dean.” He repeats, voice thicker.
Castiel rolled his eyes at his brother’s antics before looking up to meet Dean’s gaze in the rear view. The poor angel looked beyond confused and he could feel his annoyance draining away at the sight of it. “It’s just music.” He told Dean, “It’s probably different than what you’re used to, isn’t it? The band is called the Backstreet Boys, they were pretty popular back in the 90’s.”
Over where Alfie couldn’t see him well, Sam smirked as he filled his cup with coffee. It was no big secret to anyone aside from Dean’s completely obliviousness that Alfie had quite the crush on his big brother. Sam found it cute, himself. There was a bit of a gap, age wise, but he could see it working if Dean ever got his head out of his ass. “I don’t really know,” he replied, craning his neck to look over the shelves at the counter. “I haven’t talked to him this week. I know he called the other day and asked Bobby for some time off so I figured he was just taking a vacation, you know?”
“Time to wake up puppy!” Castiel declares in a loud sing-songy voice as he storms into Dean’s bedroom. He’s a man on a mission—a tornado on two legs as he moves. By the time the loud clang of the thick steel door slamming shut behind him echoes through the room he’s already halfway across it. “You’d better be awake!” He warns, and it’s the only warning Dean gets before he’s right there beside the bed. The omega blinks up at him sleepily, still under the effects of the drug mist Meg had insured he’d been doused by when she left. There’s a tell-tale hint of fear underlying that green gaze and oh, how the sight makes Castiel’s cock twitch in his jeans. He’s half hard already and has been ever since he woke up to the delicious sight that now lays before him.
It wasn’t a nice sound, more like nails on a chalkboard that made Castiel flinch under the weight of it. “I’ve been waiting for you.” The woman said simply, shrugging like this wasn’t the most unusual interaction Castiel could lay claim to having. “I didn’t think you were ever going to get up!”
The stairwell blurred around him as tears well up in his eyes. What the hell was he supposed to do? He groaned, defeated. He had half a mind to bang his head against the railing for all the good that would do. It’d surely hurt like hell but what was a little (or a big) headache compared to the hurt Dean had to be feeling right now?
he thinks mournfully as he finally leans back with a gasp. His stomach still churns but there’s nothing left to come up. Sam would know what to do, or at the very least what to say, Dean considers as he lays there. He should be disgusted laying there so close to a puddle of vomit but he doesn’t have the energy to care about it. What’s the point anyway? The bedroom is silent around him as it always is and that just drives the point home of how alone Dean is now. Sam, Bobby, Benny--nobody was looking for him. They probably didn’t even care. The thought hurts, well more than Dean is willing to admit. He misses his family and his friends and fuck, he even misses work.
?!” Unsurprisingly it’s Dean who breaks the tense silence that’s fallen between the three of them. While he makes sure to keep one wary eye on the gun the rest of his attention goes to focus on Castiel’s face. It’s harder than he thought it’d be, looking his rapist and torturer in the eyes, but Dean does it anyway. There’s nothing but malice pouring out from those blue depths and for the life of him Dean doesn’t know how he missed it before. “Put the damn gun down!” He orders, proud of the way his voice doesn’t wobble despite his churning emotions.
Sam deflated like someone had let air out of a balloon. “I’m not saying it’s any of my business,” he started, well aware he was treading a fine line that he wasn’t aware he had crossed until it was too late. “I just don’t want to see you hurt is all.” Considering how picky his brother was at the best of times Sam could easily picture that happening.
Pain floods his senses, drowning Dean in the agony as Cas continues to pound into him. His breath punches out of him with a broken sob, punctuated by a particularly hard thrust, and it’s like a damn somewhere within Dean cracks. He sobs, the sound broken as his heart and once started he can’t stop the tears from falling.
“Will you tell him I’m not mad about the spilled coffee? It was a pain to clean up but it’s cool. I know Dean isn’t the type who’d do something like that on purpose!” He rang Sam up and handed over his change along with his coffee. “I hope he’s okay!”
“C’mon bud, it’s time to go home.” He murmured, surprisingly gentle as he reached down and scooped the soul up. The soul shook and shuddered under his hands, no doubt expecting hurt to come to it like what had happened so many times before. Dean shushed it, his hands gentle as he lowered it down towards the waiting body. He hoped he had done it justice; he’d used the soul’s memories to build the body correctly and he was fairly sure he’d gotten everything correct. At least he certainly hoped so; humans had some rather strange appendages that left the angel unsure. Still, no time like the present!
“Nice to meet you,” Gabriel grinned back tiredly before lazily rolling his head to the other side where Castiel and Dean were. His brother was sitting in a wheelchair pulled up to the bedside and looked pale and drawn in a hospital gown. Gabriel lingered over the obvious bandage circling around Castiel’s skull and the cast adorning his right ankle. “You okay, Cassie?” Gabriel asked, pleased to note Dean looked relatively unharmed where he stood next to his brother.
Castiel was enjoying this immensely. He shifted, his jeans feeling incredibly tight against his straining erection. There was just something
“Psshhh! We’ll make time.” The hand not on Dean’s shoulder waves dismissively like it’s not Benny’s ass on the line alongside Dean’s the longer they drag things out. “Can’t send you off going hungry, can I? What kind of bodyguard would I be?”
“Probably more than I should!” Castiel admitted with a grin. “It’s quite popular; I’m rather surprised that you’ve never been there!” He glanced away from the road over at Dean considering. “The beer glazed meatballs are phenomenal. They’re the best in the state from what I’ve heard.”
The words hit Dean like a punch to the solar plexus and he crumbles under the sheer weight of them. Attacked? Found unconscious? The air suddenly feels like it’s being sucked out of the room through a straw. Dean can’t breathe. He gasps, heart began to pound in his chest even as his lungs strain but nothing happens. No air is coming in and he can feel himself panicking but Dean can’t make himself stop. He can’t
“No problem!” The girl grinned in return before she turned and headed back to the kitchen. Gabriel watched her go, though the strange sounds of flapping wings had him turned back to the table. There, in the previously empty chair across from him sat a tall white guy with artfully tousled brownish hair, a smattering of freckles, and the strangest green eyes Gabriel had ever seen. He blinked in surprise, one eyebrow arching into his hairline as he eyed the dude. He hadn’t seen him come in but that could be down to the lateness of the hour and the fact he still felt like three quarters of used up, days-old shit. “Can I help you?” He finally asked after eyeing the guy for way too long; sue him, there was something strangely attractive about the dude and Gabriel was only human after all!
Below him Dean gurgled out what could have either been an insult or an apology had it been able to be understood. The pain was more than overwhelming--he’d never felt any like it in his life! He had enough presence of mind to realize he’d bitten his tongue as blood filled his mouth before it dripped out onto the sheets below.
Before he knew it Dean had actually made his way into the house. He blinked at his living room, surprised.
The weather outside was surprisingly nice for being the middle of the night for the time of year it was. Not too hot, nor too cold with no fog to be seen. Gabriel let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding as he drank it all in. The churning feelings from the nightmare were still lingering, but for now it was nice to see some calm in the world. He pulled his jacket closer together as he surveyed the area. He’d been so dog-tired when they pulled in he hadn’t paid much attention but now that he was wide awake it was time to check things out! Surely there was a bar around here somewhere--almost every little town had one in some form or another. With that in mind Gabriel picked a direction at random and headed off.
Meg sighed, frustrated. It didn’t take a genius to see that Dean didn’t understand a single word she’d just said, so what now? It wasn’t like she had any other options here aside from digging around for the fake knot she used when Castiel was off ‘working’. “I can’t believe I got stuck with this!” She grumbled under her breath, glaring up at the camera once more. While this was far from her first kidnapped omega rodeo that was the first time one of them had went into heat and it wasn’t like there was an instruction manual. “Okay.” She said out loud like Dean had actually replied instead of the weak kitten noise he’d made. “Let’s give the bath a try.” If that didn’t work she was willing to sacrifice her toy for the good of the omega. Though privately she doubted Dean would be able to use it even if Castiel gave her permission to unchain one of his hands. Ugh. Why did she get stuck with the literal shit job of the equation?
Despite himself Dean had to smile. Leave it to Benny to get protective of him like he was one of the man’s pups or something. “I appreciate it,” he said as he reached for the coffee cup. “But I’ll go. If I miss any more days Sam’ll show up like the overprotective mother hen he is and start stinking the place up with his worried pheromones!” Dean scrunched up his nose just thinking about it and took a big sip of his coffee just to get the phantom scent out of his head.
Just like before it rang and rang before the voicemail kicked on again. Glancing at the time, Sam scowled deeper as he bit out a message: “Answer the phone you jerk! A friend of ours said you were sick. Why didn’t you call me? Either way I’m going to swing by there after work, and no you don’t get a say in it! If you need anything before then call me!” Ending the call, Sam leaned back in his seat and sighed. A couple of missed calls wasn’t anything to get concerned over, Sam knew, but he couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that there was something more going on.
. Castiel really can’t thank Meg enough for the good job she’d done after she’d gotten Dean back into bed. Once the omega had been drugged into sleep, she’d went to work spreading rose petals everywhere. Unlike the normal cliché of red roses these petals were an alluring pink that darkened to a near purple color as they died. The contrast was beautiful; they covered the floor, the bed, there was even a trail leading into the bathroom. The omega had looked simply delicious splayed out in the middle of the bed with the petals arranged around him just so. Castiel wasn’t ashamed to admit he'd gotten off just watching Meg work thanks to the hidden cameras that connected to the laptop in their bedroom. By the time she’d been done and Castiel had gotten to take in the whole effect he’d been rock hard and leaking once more. He licked his lips as he recalled the way he had pounced Meg as soon as she’d gotten back to their room. They’d both been desperate--they didn’t make it to the bed. They’d rutted up against the wall like they were teenagers again until they both came screaming Dean’s name.
Sixty seconds. That's approximately how long it took Gabriel to deeply regret his decision to drive away from the haunting reminder of his family. Between one blink and the next the fog in front of the car parted revealing a very familiar man in a pristine white suit. Gabriel's stomach and heart lurched as one as he slammed on the breaks but it was too late to stop--he was too close... He slammed his eyes shut, dreading the inevitable *thud* that would signify him hitting the guy but...it never happened. Warily, he opened his eyes again only to gape at the empty space in the road where there should have been a body. Nothing was there, and for the life of him Gabriel didn't know whether to be relieved or horrified.
Dean huffs, disbelieving. He knows it isn’t—how could it be when he’s Cas’ prisoner? —but he doesn’t move away. They remain like that for who knows how long, each taking solace in the quiet breathing of the other. It’s nice, far nicer than Dean could have ever asked for, and he’s drifting on the verge of passing out once more when Meg finally breaks through the cocoon of silence they created. “How about I help you take a warm bath, hmm?” She asks, gently scratching the top of his head. “It’ll help you feel better.”
“Because you’re the best,” Bobby said as though it was simple as that. “We all discussed it and you were the best choice for the job if you want to take it. There’ll probably be a promotion in the works for you afterwards.” Bobby went on as if his words were helping rather than sending Dean deeper towards full blown panic. “I know you’ve been wanting to make a garrison leader someday…”
Up close, however, Dean regretted his decision. The dumpster was just as cold as he was and the smell made him gag.
Before Dean could so much as blink Castiel’s suffocating weight was off him. Next came the thin protection of the blanket causing the naked omega to shiver under the onslaught of the cooler air from the room. Castiel’s weight returned a moment later as he clambered back on the bed and proceeded to smash Dean underneath his weight. He sat straddling Dean’s side, rendering it impossible for the other man to buck him off. “Now, where were we?” He asked as if they were discussing the weather and not Dean’s bought of insubordination. It was the only warning Dean got before Castiel began: “What.” Punch. “Did.” Punch. “You.” Punch. “Say?” Punch.
She sprays Dean down from head to foot, letting out a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding when he starts to squirm. He doesn’t open his eyes and he doesn’t tell her off so she takes it as a win. “Hopefully this helps ya.” She tells Dean as she sprays him off one more time before going to get a washcloth and soap. If nothing else at least he’ll be clean after all this.
He was turning away before he even realized he’d done it. The alleyway swum in his vision as he turned but Castiel ignored it just as surely as he ignored the tears streaming down his face. He refused to let this farce continue on; he’d fix this, one way or another. A part of his mind registered Balthazar yelling behind him and the feel of a hand grabbing his shoulder but Castiel pushed it all away. Nothing else mattered beyond helping Gabriel. If it was the last thing he would do Castiel was going to save Gabriel’s life.
Dean shrugged, managing to make the motion look awkward and stiff as he did so. Even so, a secretive smile crossed his face as he preened, pleased that the hunter had noticed. “No need to drag everyone in on a private conversation.” He said easily, giving the human a look daring him to challenge it. He may not know much but Dean knew enough that one didn’t go discussing demons around humans all willy-nilly.
Dean and Sam try to convince Castiel to put the gun down to no avail. Sam jumps Castiel and a moment later Dean does the same. The three of them tussle before the gun goes off. . . Sam and Dean get up but Castiel doesn't. He's been shot in the stomach though it's unclear who fired the shot. Castiel tries to apologize but Dean doesn't accept it; he turns his back leaving Castiel to die alone. Sam calls for help despite it already being too late. The story ends as Dean suddenly collapses due to horrible pain from the mating bite Castiel inflicted on him. It is unclear what happens to him.
Sam ended his search in the garage, frowning at the silent sight of the Impala parked there. “Where’s Dean?” He asked the car like it was actually capable of answering back. Nothing in the house had looked disturbed and Sam didn’t know what bothered him more, that, or the fact the impala was still there. He circled the car slowly, frowning when he found the keys to it still hanging out of the ignition.
“Just a club, eh?” Gabriel muttered, honey-colored eyes fixed on the sign in the distance. The Inferno was very much more than a club, at least from what he’d heard. Things had a tendency to go down there that didn’t happen in other clubs and Gabriel had to admit, despite himself, he was curious. The whole idea was Balthazar’s fault, obviously. He’d breezed into town just in time to help Gabriel and his younger brother Castiel finish the hunt they’d been on, when he decided it was time to spice up their life.
Apparently the disbelief showed up loud and clear on his face because Bobby rolled his eyes, and tried his best to appear annoyed. It didn’t work, however, considering the way he was smirking like he knew something Dean didn’t. “I know what you’re thinkin’,” He started without a preamble, “but you are the right angel for this. You’re a good soldier, loyal to a fault, and follow the rules better than any of the others in your garrison.” The older angel leaned in, pulling all of Dean’s focus onto him. “This is a big job, son. Word is Hell’s got its claws into a human soul it shouldn’t have. We need you to go down and rescue him.”
For Sam, running had always been a calming activity—it was a way to drop all the stress of the world for a while and just
Two seconds later Gabriel found himself wide awake anyways as something darted across the road in front of the car. Panicked, he slammed on the breaks and the next few seconds were lost in a blur of patchy fog, blinding headlights, and the loud squeal of tires on asphalt. When Gabriel thought he could blink again without vertigo making him want to puke he was horrified to see there was a man standing alongside the road, watching him. Horror seeped into his bones as he stared back, only for the sensation to solidify into ice upon the realization that he
Once outside Sam didn’t hesitate. By the time he reached his car he’d already pulled his phone out and begun dialing.  He listened to the ringing on the other end as he got into the car, frowning. Dean always answered his phone. Even when he was nesting he didn’t miss a call; he usually ended up burying his phone under the blankets with the rest of him. The fact that he wasn’t answering the phone right away, especially after what Alfie had told him, bothered Sam. He scowled as the ringing clicked over to the voicemail and angrily pushed the end button. “What the hell, Dean?” He grumbled out loud as he called again. If Dean was asleep or something stupid like that Sam was going to kill him.
Gabriel simply blinked dumbly, too caught between wanting to laugh and wanting to burst into tears to feel much of anything else. He turned his attention back to the road, blinking away the burning wetness in his eyes as he stared out into the dark. Why them? Why now? Why here, in the middle of the night in the middle of abso-freakin’-nowhere? Not for the first time, Gabriel wished Castiel was here with him. His younger brother would probably feel just as disturbed as he did, but it would have been nice to have some company to prove he wasn’t going out of his mind. . .
Castiel squirmed in his seat as he felt his face flame at the memory. Now that he’d had time to think about it he was embarrassed by what he’d done. In the heat of the moment it had felt good, better than good, but given too much time to think had quelled any high his orgasm had given him. Not to mention the fear lingering in the back of Castiel’s head of what Gabriel would say if he’d found out what Cas had done. Despite his brother’s fervent ongoing jokes otherwise Cas hadn’t been a virgin since April Kelly had taken him back to her house during their junior year of high school. While he knew for a fact that Gabriel knew about that incident his older brother couldn’t help himself from making jabs about Castiel’s sex life--or lack thereof--since.
Sam finds Dean outside along a fence covered with a tarp. Dean is in very bad condition and unresponsive. Sam calls for an ambulance.
Trust was what got him into this mess in the first place--why would he ever fall for it again? Dean bites his bottom lip as he looks between Meg and the bowl then back again. Her look of hope goes straight through his chest and he has to look away. “Can’t.” He brokenly whispers through a bone-dry throat. He hopes he’s making the right decision.
The guy broke out into an honest to goodness grin that made his strange eyes light up even more. “We have not,” the guy said, sounding strangely sad about that, “But I have met your brother, Castiel.” The way he said Castiel was almost reverent, like whispering a prayer.
As feared, Dean was in a bedroom, but it certainly wasn’t his. What was worse was the dual realizations that he was naked and he was laying on the floor rather than on a bed.  Cold ceramic tile (the source of his coldness) that shockingly looked like wood stretched out the length of the room. What he could see of three walls held the same leaf and vine wallpaper but the most horrifying thing of all was the heavy steel door set into the far wall. Even from where he lay Dean could tell the thing was solid and the lump inside his stomach clenched with the realization.
? Continue hunting? Castiel was good enough to make it on his own but that didn’t mean he wanted to. The thought of continuing on by himself until he was finally taken out by some random monster made his chest tighten. The truth was simple: while he could hunt alone
Distantly, like he’s off floating on a cloud he can hear the grunting, panting as Castiel begins chasing his pleasure.
Ten minutes later Dean had two takeout cups in his hands; one filled to the brim with nothing but ice and the other bubbling merrily with cola. For the longest time he just sat there and stared, his hand clutching the waxed cups hard enough to bend them.
“Dean…” Sam started hesitantly, just as aware of all the other angels watching like Dean was. “Did you forget what happened in Hell? You saved the human! The chosen one! Garth’s right man, you’re a hero!”
With a defeated sigh, he dropped his hand to rest on the steering wheel. All lack of current living situations aside, it’d been a long four months. Hell, it’d been a long
Part of Castiel had to admit the demon knew what it was doing with the way it made the women's hips sway enticingly. If he’d been a lesser man he could admit he’d probably have been taken in by the whole package…
Unfortunately, Dean’s moment of euphoria is short lived; though by the time the sound of a door opening and closing reaches him it’s already too late. The pungent smell of aroused alpha is like a kick in the chest, heavy and cloying over the top of the scent of piss and Dean gags on it, eyes flying open in alarm. His hackles raise, body tensing to fight-or-flight yet there’s nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. He’s mid-stream and caught with his pants down, literally.
It was dark by the time he reached the field but Dean paid it no mind. He could see perfectly well in the dark and ths had no problems seeing the large hole in the ground where he’d buried the human.
“I didn’t realize it was any of your business!” Dean shot back as he crossed his arms. His hands were balled into fists but he didn’t start swinging--at least not yet. “The last I checked I didn’t need to get your approval on who I see or go out with!” It stung knowing that Sam was right but Dean would be damned before he admitted it, especially out loud to Sam himself!
“What’s what?” Castiel asked at the same time Gabriel tipped his head back and broke out into another fit of laughter. This time both Castiel
Behind him Dean stood frozen, shocked down to his core. He could feel the walls of his world closing in around him and he was powerless to stop it. Distantly he felt the impact as his knees hit the floor but he hardly cared. Nothing mattered anymore, especially not him.
Sam shook his head, ignoring the way his sweat-drenched hair whipped around to smack him in the face. Dean was ruining everything; the show, Sam’s life, and not to mention his own. Where the hell could he have gone?! Wherever he was Sam hoped he was sure as fuck enjoying it because once Sam caught up to him, there was going to be definite hell to pay.
Garth noticed his discomfort immediately. “You alright, my man?” He asked, concerned. “There aren’t many spots but I can find some place to pull over if you need me too!” He glanced back at Dean in the rear view mirror again. “I can swing around a drive thru and get something to drink or some ice or something if you think that would help too!”
"Chicken noodle." Meg confirms with shining, hopeful eyes. "It isn't much, just from a can, but hey, at least it's warm!" She tries to sound cheerful about it though the effect goes completely over Dean's head. Try as he might he can't wrap his head around what's happening here. It's been . . . well he doesn't know how long it's actually been but why now? After everything he's been put through thus far, why now? As much as he wants the soup, and make no doubt he does, Dean doesn't think he can trust it.
A lifetime passed but Castiel didn’t let it slow him down. It took nothing short of an eternity to pull himself fully from the box but there was still dirt all around and no time to rest. He dug and clawed and fought his way for every foot until finally, at long last, his reaching fingers encountered nothing but air.
Castiel pushed off from the wall and moved closer to the bed. “They hadn’t when I left the set yesterday. Consensus is you’re off having a good time with, I believe her name is Heather.” He stalked around the bed slowly like a shark circling its prey as he moved out of Dean’s eyesight. “Tell me, Dean,” Castiel leaned down, his breath brushing the shell of Dean’s ear, “How does it feel to know everyone you care for think you’ve just callously abandoned them? Hmm? Do you feel good knowing that you’ve pushed away anyone and everyone who could possibly help you in your time of need?” He leaned in further and gently nipped at the outer shell of Dean’s ear, his teeth barely skimming the delicate flesh. “Despite what you may think you’ve been perfect for my plans since day one. Thanks to your callousness I can do whatever I want to you, and the best part is that nobody will ever know! All I’d have to do is show up with some sob story about you and Heather and nobody would bat a second eye at me!” He chuckled and bit down harder on Dean’s ear.
“Hannah.” A quiet commanding voice pipes up from across the room, breaking through the sudden tense atmosphere. “Give him time to gather his wits. The doctor should be here shortly.”
As a general rule angels didn’t panic. They were built to receive orders and mindlessly obey, not to worry or fret or panic like their father’s creation did. Dean, on the other hand, had always been a bit different compared to his brethren. He obeyed and followed orders with the best of them but deep down in his being he had...questions. It was a sensation Dean lacked the words to describe, and the knowledge to properly question. Who was he to question things anyway? He was a mere foot soldier, programmed to obey and follow orders from his superiors...the same superiors who had summoned him to God’s throne room.
be! The eyes could deceive you, Castiel knew. He’d seen, or rather thought he’d seen, enough things growing up hunting to know one couldn’t fully trust what they were seeing in front of him. Denial didn’t make his brother sit up and yell “Gotcha!” however, no matter how much Castiel wished it to be so.
Dean stared, flabbergasted. Was he really getting dating advice from his cab driver? Seriously, what was his life? “Uh,” He coughed, not even sure where to begin addressing any of that. “It’s something like that I guess…” Sure, he guessed… What was he, a twelve-year-old girl going through her first breakup? He groaned, shifting slightly in his seat. It was a mistake--a stab of pain shot through his ass and up his spine, nearly stealing his breath away. A whimper slipped out before he could stop it and he squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to see Garth’s reaction. The guy was practically drowning in blockers so it was impossible to tell what designation he was but either way Dean was sure he wouldn’t be receptive to a whiny omega.
Dean thinks harshly, not at all cowed despite Cas stealing his voice with his little trick. It’ll wear off soon enough and then Dean will
with distressed omega pheromones. The scent hit Sam with all the force of a sledgehammer to the head and he reeled backwards from the onslaught. Distantly he took notes of the stains—a terrible mix of blood and other bodily fluids he didn’t want to think about—and before he was fully aware of what he was doing, Sam turned tail and ran.
“I am Samael, Dean’s brother. And this is Garth.” The angel said, waving at the lankly looking man standing guard near the door. “We’re glad to properly make your acquaintance.” Behind him Garth waved though he remained at his post by the door.
. There was something deeply primal about it; something raw that appeased to his inner alpha. Even now as he pounded down the sidewalk in the early hours of the morning Sam could feel his alpha rumbling in pure pleasure. While most people—Dean included—would think Sam was crazy for going jogging in the middle of February the crisp cool air revived him. And if it wasn’t snowing, which wasn’t supposed to happen until the following week, Sam didn’t see where the problem was.
What was he supposed to do now? Dean didn’t have a clue and it wasn’t like there was anyone around to ask either. Taking a deep breath, he steeled his nerves before slowly pushing his way up to sitting using his left arm. He was barely up all the way before he was dry retching again, the pain temporarily overriding his senses. Oh god, he was so, so screwed, wasn’t he? Even without seeing it Dean was sure it was broken. The sickening throbbing radiating out from the arm all but confirmed it. Now what? It was one thing to be out wandering the streets in the middle of the night and a whole ‘nother to do it with a broken bone. Despite Dean’s fervent hopes help didn’t magically materialize out of thin air which meant he had no choice but to keep going. With his right arm carefully tucked up against his chest he picked a direction and continued to walk.
On the inside, however, things weren’t that simple. Oh, the fame and fortune and nice house was all true, of course, but none of that mattered since Dean was alone. While he relished playing bad-boy, heartthrob Jensen Ackles in real life he was about as far from being the man as he could get. The fact that he was already twenty-six and wasn’t mated, or even had an alpha for that matter, hung over his head like a pendulum.
Realization sunk in the same second her eyes switched to bright red hellfire, confirming his fears: she was the demon he’d been waiting for. Fear suddenly clawed it’s icy way into his chest but Cas wasn’t having it; he couldn’t afford to screw up now. Distantly he thought he could hear Gabriel’s voice screaming at him to run. Another time, a different circumstance, and he probably would have turned tail and bolted for it. Now, though? Now he didn’t even blink; he let the full weight of his cold blue stare meet the burning red gaze and held it. He was afraid but fear could be tamed. ‘Never let them see you afraid,’ a wise person had once told him and Cas took it to heart now. He swallowed hard, the only outward sign of his nerves, and stared death in the face without flinching.
To Sam’s consternation the day seemed to drag on forever. The fact that he was wholly unfocused throughout a good chunk of it hadn’t helped either. He couldn’t help it, however. He had tried calling Dean again on his lunch break but had gotten no further than he had that morning. Dean still hadn’t answered and Sam was truly beginning to worry. Sick or not it wasn’t like his brother to keep missing phone calls like he was.
He prayed, not up to dealing with baddies who made house calls. Thankfully his prayer was answered as standing on the other side of the door was none other than Dean’s angel brothers. Both were dressed in jeans and flannel, and in Sam’s case an ugly orange jacket that only an angel could love. Gabriel let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and lowered the knife. “Samshine! Garth! What brings you to our humble abode?” He greeted as he stood back to allow the angels entrance to the room. Ever since they had helped dispatch Asmodeus the two angels had been showing up almost as frequently as Dean did.
“You’re kidding.” While it wasn’t the best comeback ever it was literally the only thing Dean could come up with in the moment because, seriously? All this because he’d done the job given to him? He was beyond baffled; nothing even remotely like this happened for doing a good job so what was up? He felt a bit like a fish stuck out of water if all the floundering he was doing was any indication. He looked around at the crowd with new eyes and when he saw John lurking towards the back with a raised brow Dean abruptly hit his limits. He needed to get out of there, just to clear his mind if nothing else. Casting an apologetic look at Sam then Garth--he’d explain things to them later--he shoved his way through the crowd and quite literally flew for it.
Castiel watches Dean spacing out with lust burning through his very veins. The drug mist is potent but he’s never before seen the aftereffects of it so closely before. It’s fascinating to see the way Dean’s eyes glaze over as he stares out into the middle distance. It’s this, watching the way his body goes slack as he lets Castiel do whatever he wants that turns Castiel’s dial all the way up to eleven. Castiel kisses him once more before biting down on Dean’s lower lip. The tiny inhaled gasp of pain is absolutely worth it and he finds himself smirking in satisfaction as he pulls back from the bed to standing. He wastes no time, hands practically vibrating as he unzipped his jeans letting his cock finally spring free. He groans his relief to the air as he struggles to get his jeans the rest of the way off before turning to the bed once more.
For his part Benny simply shakes his head, amazed and saddened as he watches Dean go. It’s obvious to him the omega is still hurting, still feeling the after-effects of his heat, yet there’s little he can do to help. As a beta his naturally calming scent helps—that was part of the reason he broke protocol to sit beside Dean for a while—yet the older man can’t help the way his heart clenches at seeing his friend suffer. It’s been this way for years now, practically ever since they met, yet it bothers him every single time. He looks skyward, momentarily ignoring Dean, and sends up a quick prayer to whoever might be listening that an alpha would come along who could properly help Dean. The omega wouldn’t thank him for it, had he known, but Benny supposed what he didn’t know couldn’t hurt him. It wasn’t likely such a prayer would be answered anyhow—Dean was far too stubborn for that.
the expected shot never came. Instead of hearing a bang there was a small prick on the right side of Dean’s neck and suddenly the world turned to liquid around him. “What?” He slurred—or at least he thought he did. He was distantly aware of the world falling around him and then suddenly there was nothing.
To Dean's profound relief there didn't seem to be any snakes, at least none that he could see. But was the room getting hazy? Confused, Dean lifted his head and looked around the room, startled to see a fog like mist seeping out of the small vent fixed high on the wall near the bathroom door. "The fuck is that!?" He yelped but it was already too late: the mist quickly covered the room in a thick blanket of hazy white. Dean coughed, eyes watering. He dropped to the floor in a crouch but it didn't help. His head and vision swam in tandem as he felt his body slip sideways towards the floor. A familiar deep chuckle vibrated through his bones, following him down into the deep.
His inner voice nagged at him as he groaned and proceeded to bury his face in his hands. See, this was another reason why he didn’t date—it made him act like a damned idiot! “Do—do they have good drinks there?” He mumbled from behind his hand-shield. God, he hoped so! With the way things were going so far Dean was sure he was going to need at least half a dozen just to survive the night!
“My name is Samael.” The taller angel proclaimed in a resigned voice as he stepped inside, not that the reminder would do any good--Gabriel seemed to come up with a new name for him every single time they’d met. Garth, by contrast, just grinned as he followed Sam inside before bee-lining to the table where Dean and Castiel were. Gabriel watched the angel go with a chuckle and a shake of his head before turning to close the door.
“I’m sorry we didn’t get there sooner.” Another voice, somewhat softer than Dean’s spoke up from the opposite side of Gabriel’s bed. It was enough to prompt him into opening his eyes again and he was relieved to find it was easier this time. Blinking against the light Gabriel looked up to find an unfamiliar set of hazel eyes looking down from a concerned face. “Who’re you?” He slurred, sounding as tired as Castiel had, though he was bolstered by the look of relief that passed across the man’s face.
“Look at you,” Cas slurs, obviously drunk as he slides in closer. “All needy and perfect.” His hands reach out, running slowly up and down Dean’s flank, nimble fingers teasing at the hem of his shirt. “Just waiting for me, weren’t you?” The alpha breathes, the scent of whiskey practically coming out of every pore as he leans close enough for his breath to tickle the back of Dean’s neck.
What he sees doesn’t make him feel any better. Dean’s sound asleep, dead to the world, and if not for the presence of the oxygen tube still carefully looped up under his nose Sam would worry that he had died. As it is Dean doesn’t look to be too many steps above it. What skin that can be seen between the bandages and extensive bruising is pallid and there’s a smudge of deep purplish bruising underneath his right eye. The left is an utter mess of ugly bruising and has swelled completely shut. Sam can feel a low growl start in his throat as his eyes travel downwards, taking note of the way Dean’s lower lip is split and swollen as well and the tell-tale bruising around his chin where someone—whoever the bastard was that hurt him—had roughly grabbed him.
“Sir!” The voice comes again, though this time it’s giddy sounding which leaves Dean wondering what it’s so happy about. He’s hurting and he’s exhausted, neither of these things equate to happiness. “Can you open your eyes for me?” It presses like Dean isn’t trying his damndest to scowl in response, something he’s not sure he’s pulling off but doesn’t care anyway.
By the time it’s over Dean’s sure he’s dying. Everything hurts worse than before and to his horror he finds somewhere along the line he started to cry. It isn’t helping with the whole breathing thing but he can’t make himself stop either. It’s the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back and just like that all the fight goes out of Dean. He goes lax in his bonds and simply sobs.
Wait--what? Dean blinks, shocked. A cold chill runs down his spine to pool uncomfortably in his stomach as he parses the alpha’s words. He can’t believe it--did Castiel actually apologize? To him? The idea is inconceivable after everything. He steps back, horror sweeping across his face as he shakes his head. No. No. This can’t be happening! Castiel can’t just apologize like everything is going to be fine and forgiven! It just doesn’t
When he turned back he was surprised to find Sam still standing there, watching him. While that wasn’t totally unusual--the angels were a little on the
“Oh screw that!” Gabriel spat, too wound up and raring to go to stop and think things through. Castiel had a good point, he knew, but damned if he was going to wait around for them to get their thumbs out of their asses. He’d dealt with Asmodeus before and he knew every second counted. He raised the machete he’d grabbed from the car’s trunk as he went storming up to the door. He’d barely knocked upon it before the door flung open revealing a giant bear of a man with dark hair and a beard who eyed him distrustfully before opening a mouth full of pointed teeth. Gabriel didn’t hesitate--he swung the machete for the fences and sliced through the vampire’s neck like it was tissue paper. Its body dropped as the head went rolling...only to come to a stop at the feet of Castiel and Dean, who had finally caught up to him. “About time you two showed up!” Gabriel offered up before he hopped over the body and headed down the long unlit hallway that led deeper into the club. Gabriel kept an ear out, listening to the quiet sounds of Castiel and Dean following him as they moved deeper. Despite the rows of doors lining the hallway Gabriel ignored them all in favor for the one at the very end.
Lifting his head he looked around, frowning at all the nothingness around him. He could possibly try breaking into one of the buildings but honestly Dean didn’t feel up to the task. Not to mention it would probably bring law enforcement of some kind down on his head and then where would he be? He couldn't currently string a sentence together but he had a feeling the cops would be interested in getting ahold of him. And what about Hannah? Dean had promised them, at least he figured he did since he couldn’t remember, that he’d stay away from everyone else.
. Sam thinks, frowning, from his position just outside the door to Dean’s hospital room. He’s been holding his lone vigil here and in the waiting room for hours now, yet nobody has really told him a damn thing about what happened to his brother.
“The hell?” Gabriel exclaimed as he moved away instinctively from Dean. He blinked at the parking lot like he’d never seen it before as he tried to wrap his head around just what the hell had happened. “How did you do that?” He asked, a slight note of hysteria in his voice as he rounded on Dean. “What did you do?”
Were all humans always so abrupt? Dean wondered as he met Gabriel’s appraising gaze with one of his own. It was fascinating to him to find the brothers didn’t look alike, something he’d been expecting. The man in front of him was shorter than Castiel with longer, lighter hair, and honey-whisky colored eyes that were watching him with wary curiosity. Dean remembered to smile in return, hoping to set the human at ease. “I’m Dean.” He said, calm and cool as a cucumber. “I’m the one who pulled your brother from the Pit.”
“Have you ever been to The Blue Parrot?” Castiel asked as Dean settled into the passenger seat of Castiel’s large Continental. For all that it was Dean’s idea to go out for a drink it’d been Castiel who had insisted upon driving. The guy is certainly a little strange (especially given that his car is a godawful gold toned Lincoln Continental Mark V) but Dean ain’t complaining. Why would he? Castiel’s the hottest alpha Dean’s ever laid eyes on and the novelty that he wants to go out with Dean hasn’t been lost. Hell, Dean’s fairly sure it never
A bath. . .? Dean blinked up at her drowsily, not fully comprehending her words. His brain had went and checked out once more leaving him feeling sluggish and not all there despite the heavy weight of his body. It was an odd disconnect that only happened when his heats got bad  though he couldn’t ever recall having one that left him feeling this terrible. Either way he hummed his consent, or what remained of it that he could give. Even half out of his head as he was Dean doubted Meg at her worst couldn’t do half the harm that Castiel had already inflicted on him.
The guy certainly knew how to sober up a conversation, didn’t he? Dean frowned as he watched the hunter’s head drop over his plate until he found himself staring at a head full of messy brown hair that was in desperate need of a comb. “Bobby’s my superior, he’s in charge of my garrison.” He pointed out needlessly, “though I suppose that would make him a boss of sorts by your standards.” He shrugged again, the motion causing the leather of his jacket to creak. “He sent me to help you against Asmodeus.” Given the way things had been going so far it probably would have been a wiser idea had Bobby came himself, Dean considered. But that was neither here nor there since he was the one who was here which meant this mess was now his to deal with, for better or worse. “I believe if we work together we should be able to defeat him!”
Across the table Gabriel shuddered and held up a hand. “Don’t!” He ground out, before looking up to meet Dean’s eyes. “Can you not toss his name out like that?” This whole thing was bad enough but Gabriel knew he wasn’t going to get through it if he had to keep hearing the demon’s name over and over. “No offense, but shouldn’t they have sent an army or something?”
Despite himself he flushed, caught between annoyed and mortified that she’d seen him kneeling in the dirt for so long. What would she have done if a demon had shown up after all? “What are you doing here?” It seemed like a safe question to ask, all things considered.
“We don’t have to do this, you know.” He said, his voice sounding loud in the silence. His whiskey colored eyes were firmly glued on the landscape passing along outside though his back was a tight line of tension.
Chapter Warning: This chapter contains one of the character's making a demon deal at the crossroads to sell their soul.
Castiel thought darkly when he was sure he finally had himself under control. Despite his mixed feelings otherwise he knew he needed to get up and try to start looking for his wayward brother. Or well, at least a phone at the very least considering he literally had no idea where he even was in the first place.
Alpha though he was, Sam knew a threat when he saw one. He cowed, all display of aggression fading away to be replaced with curdling embarrassment. As much as he wanted to avenge his brother—who probably wouldn’t thank him for it—Sam hadn’t meant to let himself get so far out of control. “I’m sorry,” He said, meaning it. “I’ll try harder to control myself.” He didn’t know how much he could count on that being true, but it was the thought that counted, wasn’t it?
Castiel, unfortunately, hadn’t shared in Dean’s opinion. Whereas Dean had went the extra mile in dressing in some of his fancier clothes the alpha had showed up in a pair of ripped jeans and a ratty Metallica shirt that had seen better decades. Things had quickly spiraled down from there as the man had wasted no time in deriding everything from Dean’s clothes down to the silverware. Even the food hadn’t been good enough--even now Dean cringed at the memory of seeing Castiel throw his bowl of ravioli across the dining room. “This tastes like dog food!” The alpha had ranted, his chest heaving as he rounded on Dean. “You’re trying to poison me!”
So what’s she doing here then? Meg wishes she knew. Sighing quietly she watches the steady rise and fall of Dean’s body as he slips off into sleep. She picks up the bowl and rises fluidly to her feet. “I’ll try again later.” She whispers, not wanting to wake him.
“I hope so,” Dean muttered but he let it drop. He wanted to have a good time tonight and he was determined that nothing was going to stand in his way of it! Still, he couldn’t help but continue to stare up at the building as they parked and got out of the car. “How did you find this place anyway?” He asked as they headed across the lot to where the line was. Going by the outside of the place alone it didn’t scream ‘party over here!’, at least not in Dean’s opinion.
Normally he could ignore it but on mornings like this one, where he’d woken tired and strung out after finally coming down from yet another grueling eight-day heat, the realization that he wasn’t getting any younger was like a slap in the face. It hardly helped matters that he hated mornings like they were a plague either. They were usually far too early for his taste, too bright, and often contained Dean’s overly cheerful, seemingly perpetual easy-going, personal driver Benny picking him up.
For a time he simply lay there, panting as he struggled to catch his breath in the early evening breeze. He’d gotten enough of a look at his surroundings to know he was in a field but the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ of it all was the furthest thing from his mind at the moment. It was a silly, naive thing, but he was strangely proud of himself. He’d gotten himself free; but now what? The question lingered as he caught his breath, his desperate panting slowing to something approaching normal.
