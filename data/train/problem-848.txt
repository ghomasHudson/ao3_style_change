One day James asked Sherlock why he was so interested in philosophy. The young Holmes's answer didn't take long. In his opinion philosophy studies the versions of truths of this life. People are powerless in relation to this world, and if they had chosen the other way, what would have happened then? Ignorance of this world is something we all have in common. But trying to grasp all these seemingly simple truths, to understand something beyond and beyond ordinary understanding, simply disconnects you from reality. It's as if you're related to the truth. "They seem to be what I live for."
- Um, well, it's probably one of the most beautiful places in Britain. Rugged mountains and valleys and hills and fields and woods, where I spent a lot of time. Mostly hunting with my dad. He would shoot game and our dog would find it. Oh, that's right! There's a lot of heather moors and secluded sandy beaches. It's cold, though.
After a couple of hours they did get down to their homework. Books spread around, the smell of paper, leather covers and worn dusty pages. In the small library of the Holmes house there was one ancient stained-glass window depicting the Virgin Mary. The sunlight falling on it turned into a multi-coloured glow. They sat beneath the stained glass window, studying the history of the Middle Ages, and in this blessed silence they heard each other's quiet sighs. And now, they were already sitting shoulder to shoulder. Sherlock's thin fingers traced across John's face, slowly descending to his lips. No, he didn't ask to close his eyes, he didn't ask permission, but he couldn't resist his friend's charm. A cautious and quick kiss. The same one that any girl who was in love with Holmes dreams of.
James grabbed his arm, pulling back the sleeve of his white shirt slightly, loosened his tie a little, and then continued talking, but in a whisper. Their faces a couple of centimetres apart, blood beginning to boil in their veins as the tension built up between them.
By the fireplace, where the embers were burning, John was looking at an old photograph. Him, his parents and a fiery coloured puppy. It had been a present for his twelfth birthday. "Is that really all I have left of you?"
- We all do.
- That's genius. But how do you know?
- Last week you promised to let me read a book on astronomy. Would you be so kind as to bring it to me, please? I've got a car coming to pick me up soon.
- Sherlock, what do I do?! He's going to disappear on his own!
The argumentative questions were interrupted by quick kisses that made it hard to breathe. Fingers tangled in her hair, a shiver spreading through her body, a heartbeat so frantic that it echoed off the empty walls.
And his heart truly shattered into a thousand pieces, and all the pain that had accumulated over the years turned into tears. Pure and true tears. Sherlock no longer doubted that James had a heart.
- Please stop all this.
- James, don't be so naive.
- Sherlock... um... what's going on?
- John, I keep forgetting to ask, what's your dog's name?
- You're a true Scot, and you don't know your country's history!
- Yeah, I suppose it does.
John ran to the stables without saying anything to his grandmother, saddled Alasdair and was already on horseback heading down that road into the woods. They had a long way to go in the woods: miles of silence and no wind. The cautious flitting of birds. Purple bells in glades, trembling aspen leaves, triumphant light, and finally, forest twilight, when dampness reeks from moss and fireflies burn in the grass. The forests are never silent. But all John wanted to hear was a familiar voice. That tinkling bark of his red-haired dog.
- I wrote you letters, but I got nothing back. I was deluding myself, covering my thoughts with a thin layer of dust. I was told to let it go, but I couldn't. Soon I stopped doing that too, so as not to disturb you unnecessarily.
- Hey, Sherlock! Using your deduction to figure out what I need from you?
- Oh, what... what happened to you? You're covered in abrasions.
- You don't divide people's actions into exclusively black and white, but I dare you to ask this, Sherlock.
- You shouldn't hate your enemies. Emotions get in the way of thinking. And John is not your enemy.
"I'm leaving because I want to forget everything. I don't want you to think I'm weak. I don't want to see your tears as well as my own. I deleted your number a long time ago and burned all the pictures from the album. I try to live without you, but I hardly succeed. Just remember sometimes the seashore where you and I used to ride, and those forgotten places in the green park."
- Sherlock, I, like you, ponder whether the man standing next to me could have been my friend in another reality.
They met as enemies, but said goodbye as friends.
The hazy sun at nine in the morning. Its rays, falling in patches across the courtyard, grazed the edge of the roof, penetrating the room. Dust particles floated in the air, settling on books with worn covers, but the air itself was fresh. That morning chill that made me want to wake up and run for the day. It must have been how Sherlock's mornings began. He used to take every opportunity to stay home, but now he can't linger for a second. He's afraid he'll be late for the adventure that John has devised.
- I do not! I do, and I'll take the test.
- Just like you are to me?
- John, what's wrong?
In the shade of the trees, they were talking about something. They argued again, wondered and joked. As if they were sworn friends who had known each other since childhood. Only everyone knows that over time, friendship turns into something more. Sherlock was afraid to look John in the eye, constantly averting his gaze, to which he only squeezed his hand tighter and asked just to look at the sky with him. The red-haired dog frolicked around, drawing them into a carefree game, if only for a few minutes. They ran after him, forgetting everything. And there were no two boys in the whole world happier than these.
- It would distract me from my studies. My parents want me to be a doctor, maybe a chemist, maybe a diplomat.
- That doesn't mean I'm gonna run to him with open arms! He took you away from me.
Barely touching each other with delicate fingers, they walked up the stairs. About halfway up, Sherlock paused, wondering if his actions were the right ones. If what James wants happens, Sherlock won't even be able to talk to John anymore. But on the other hand he could understand Moriarty as well. "Don't hesitate to let me be your princess tonight, because that's what you think of John, isn't it?". Again the guile, again the game shrouded in lies.
- I want to be a pirate!
- Oh, lucky you... I'm not allowed to have a dog.
- So could he?
They were together again. The master and the red dog. Redbeard plopped John down on the ground and never stopped wagging his tail. They were both insanely happy. Sherlock told him that he had found him near the river near the bridge. Redbeard was lost and didn't know where to go, so he didn't try to find his way home. None of that mattered now, because the worst was over. John couldn't even find the words to thank Sherlock. He just kissed him. In the middle of the street in the moonlight they kissed softly, knowing that words were unnecessary here.
- Almost right. Scots and Picts. The history of the Scottish kingdom begins in 843, when Kenneth MacAlpin united the two tribes. Eh, teach better.
Moriarty family residence. James was already waiting for Sherlock, for today they wanted to settle an argument from years ago. And it wasn't about science at all.
- Into a thousand pieces, huh? I think I know what we're going to talk about.
The Renaissance, which left its mark on world culture, influenced the idea of style. The Renaissance is a weaving of the new into the old: the love of neat forms, symmetry and clear lines of the ancient world is harmoniously combined with the luxury, splendour and wealth of the late Middle Ages. This is exactly what the Moriarty Mansion was like. There were arches everywhere instead of doors, windows barely covered by expensive fabrics such as silk or velvet, with exquisite embroidery and twisted cords, and reproductions of the very Renaissance paintings hung on the walls.
- Do you mind?
John pushed Sherlock's hand away, grabbed his things and hurried home. Before he left, Sherlock told him that he would be waiting for him in Regent's Park tonight. John refused to believe it to the last, realising that he was different. Already at home he sat in his room, pressing a trembling hand to his barely warm lips. An overwhelming desire to escape, but would only be left to stare out the window and think of all the possible lives he could have lived, but now would never know, because he had known the taste of love. Another love.
Sunday morning. They have arranged to meet in Regent's Park. Sherlock tells John that it's a favourite place for Londoners north-west of the centre. Like Hyde Park, Regent's was the personal hunting ground of Henry VIII and only became public in 1845. "I'm like my brother and proud of it" - Sherlock repeated this often, as if to remind John that he was just as clever as Mycroft. An ordinary walk between two friends, but they still had so much to learn about each other.
- Redbeard.
- An Irish setter called Redbeard.
London's Westminster School. The grey walls that hold the wisdom of the ages, the gates adorned with Latin lettering, the courtyard and the library that is always full of people. School really does become a second home - not all at once, of course - but you get to love the routine of the days spent reading, the joy of meeting friends, finishing lessons and taking long walks afterwards, arguing about nothing and talking about the same things. It is a time to find true friends, the rest is in our hands, whether we manage to keep it through the years, whether we can teach something new, and whether we learn ourselves.
- You'll call your brother again, won't you? Look, I can do whatever I want, and even you can't stop me...
For the remaining thirty minutes they sat in the living room and drank tea again, remembering everything. They decided to let go of that past, to forget it. That friendship, that relationship would never exist again, but a fresh start was impossible for either of them. Sherlock made the rational decision to stay on the neutral side. "A formal friendship? I didn't expect to hear you say that, Sherlock, but I'm impressed. Have it your way." Just a thought. James didn't answer; he nodded his head silently, letting him know he agreed.
- Nothing. We've just come to the conclusion that it's time to bury the hatchet. It doesn't make sense, does it?
- Why not?
- No, James. It was for you. Isn't that what you wanted?
The next day at the academy, the first lesson was world history. Sherlock and John were already sitting together reading the last pages of the paragraph, finishing the assignment. James knew that Sherlock was certainly not alone, but still managed to approach and say a polite hello. A brief conversation ensued between the two geniuses, understood only by the two of them. Such behaviour surprised absolutely everyone. "What happened to him?". "Surely this is James Moriarty, the one?".
- Oh, come on! It's just a house. You live in Kensington yourself, and here you are, for some reason, surprised.
- John, go home. I'll try everything I can to find him. If anything, Mycroft will certainly help.
Being proper Englishmen, they began with a cup of tea and milk. Outside the window it was pouring with rain that never seemed to stop. Sherlock's older brother would be arriving in two hours, so they didn't have much time.
- Erm... Well... There were definitely Scots and I think there were Gaelic tribes... Come on, there's no such thing!
"Even though we were close every day, there were still those things between us that we dared not say. As we lose faith and drift away from each other, we will try to find the words. No one knows what the future will bring, but moving forward hand in hand is exactly what makes us stronger. I want you to accept even my bad sides, because that's part of who I am now. And from this day forward, we will be what we have always been, we will be dreamers."
- I would forgive you anything but your weakness.
- Get him.
He chased Alasdair like never before. The ground flew from under his hooves, dust rose, and his heavy breathing echoed. Almost in darkness John noticed something flickering among the trees. He tried to stop the horse, but it reared up sharply, toppling the rider. There was a thud. John's head hit the ground, but he quickly got up and ran after something ginger. Scratching against thorny branches, stumbling into puddles and stumbling over rocks, he kept running. "Redbeard! Redbeard!" But it wasn't a dog, just a fox. Alasdair remained waiting for John at the spot. Going back home didn't feel like it at all, because that's how John found him. A little longer and night will fall, darkness will descend on the land, and then the way home will be almost impossible to find. John ducked into the horse's mane, struggling to hold back the tears, and so on all the way home...
- Yeah, well... Um, what's your name...
- I wasn't even thinking.
Soon a black car pulled up, out of which a young man in a sharp suit and a nice tie, holding a classic black umbrella. John at once realized that he was from the upper classes of British aristocracy, but who he was to Sherlock was not an easy mystery.
- I'm Sherlock Holmes, remember? You know, I'd like to talk to you...
- But I'm so bored, Sherlock. I want your attention.
- Redbeard! He's... he's gone!
- Sherlock... Are you sure you live here?! It's more like a museum!
- He's never been to a city this big. Back in Scotland, I could let him go for a day because I was sure Redbeard knew the area and would always get home in time. But it's not like that here!
- What? Are you going off topic again?
Confused, he made his way home. Sitting idly by was simply impossible because his friend was in danger. Not far from the outskirts of the town there was a road leading into the countryside and there into the forest. A whole day had been wasted, but it was only evening, there were still a few hours before complete darkness set in. "That will definitely be enough for me. I'll find Redbeard myself!"
- What do you want?
- This is my brother. He works for the British ministry. A very important figure to me and to England itself. God save the Queen. I almost forgot, I'll give you your jacket back tomorrow morning. Don't be late for school.
- You're really good at dodging the question. I say one thing and you say another. If I say you're vain, this time you're saying you can't find a man in the world who lives as wretchedly as you do.
John was to spend time with him, but he knew in his heart of hearts that he was more than willing to follow Sherlock anywhere he wanted to go.  The days when Sherlock left and John couldn’t follow him because he was due at the clinic left them both feeling out of sorts.  Greg found that Sherlock was even more difficult to deal with on the days that John didn’t accompany him than he had been before John had come into his life, and so he began to text John to see if he was available
“Oh, okay, food,” John said.  “I don’t suppose you’ll be too happy with me feeding your body Pedigree Chum, will you, Sherlock?”  The look Sherlock gave John said everything that needed to be said, and with a capital NO! to boot.  John wandered into the kitchen to rummage through the fridge, and found a plate of cold chicken; leftovers from the meal Mrs Hudson had brought the boys the night before.  As usual, Sherlock hadn’t touched his, and as Mrs Hudson gave very generous portions – she was always trying to feed them up – there was plenty left over.  John spooned two lots out onto flat plates, and placed one on the floor in front of Jilly, and the other in front of Sherlock, who snorted and fixed John with a rigid gaze.
“No Sherlock, I had a go message set up ready to send, and it got sent accidentally when I landed on my phone when you PULLED ME OFF MY CHAIR!!”
John gasped, remembering all of the visits he had made, never stopping to wonder where last week’s flowers had gone.  In the beginning, time had been strange; hours passed and the clock would tell him it was ten minutes since he had last looked.  Months went by, and yet the newspapers had only produced one edition.  It was no wonder it hadn’t occurred to him that something was happening to the flowers he left; in John’s mind it had been months since he last came, when in reality there had been no more than a few days since the last time he had been.  As time had gone on, and life had returned to some semblance of normality, John had gone less and less to the graveside, so he simply hadn’t noticed.
A couple of days after the bathroom incident, John decided he couldn’t stand being in the flat a moment longer, and that he needed to get out by whatever means were necessary.  He waited until Sherlock was in the shower and made a run for it – although in his heavily pregnant state, it was more of a waddle – and he made it as far as Speedy’s downstairs before the ungainliness and the backache that had been plaguing him all night forced him to rest up.  Luckily, the only people in the café were the petite, dark-haired Beta waitress, and another Omega, who left soon after John arrived.  The waitress sat him down in a corner, rummaging about behind the counter for a few cushions and making him comfortable, before refusing to bring him a cappuccino and instead providing a cup of camomile tea.  He grimaced, but thanked her for her consideration.  Approximately five minutes later, Sherlock burst out of their front door, hair dripping, one hand holding up his trousers, shirt unbuttoned and only one shoe on, the other in his hand.  He was shouting into his mobile phone at Mycroft loudly demanding he scramble helicopters and scour the CCTV to see who had kidnapped his pregnant mate.  John sighed deeply, and then asked the waitress to tell Sherlock he was sitting inside.
“Faster.”  The instruction was delivered quietly; a casual observer might think John was not affected at all by the sight in front of him, but that was not the case.  The rough fabric of his fatigue trousers was damp and straining from his erection, but he was disciplined, hands laid on his thighs, unmoving.  Sherlock obeyed, the tone of command in John’s voice unmistakable, and Sherlock was powerless to resist it.  As his hand moved faster along his shaft, Sherlock’s expression became more frustrated; he needed something…more.
Sherlock’s hands were gentle, and that wasn’t helping John’s problem.  He almost wished Sherlock would be rougher, as that would help him focus more on the pain of the injury, rather than the ghosting touches that did nothing more than make John’s cock rock hard.  Sherlock had finished cleaning all the grazes, but continued to gently dab at John’s thigh, cleaning non-existent dirt from his wound.  Finally he looked up at John, his eyes heavy-lidded, pupils dilated, and in a gravelly voice asked, “John, can I… can I kiss you?”
“Come in!” John’s voice answered, and Sherlock went in.
Greg pumped the air with his fist gleefully.  “I
and the
Greg managed to catch up with Sherlock just outside the hospital, where he was scrunched in a ball up against the wall.  Greg had never seen him look like that in the whole time he had known the younger man; even when he had been gripped by withdrawal, shivering and vomiting, with a look of naked desire for some cocaine to ease his suffering, but determination to win out in his eyes.
Mary was the second person to help him come back from that black edge, day by day; a small smile and hello here, an understanding of his need for solitude there.  One day he had been surprised to find himself smiling back at her; a month or so later, laughing at some small but very cheesy joke she had made.  It had been a small step from there to a drink in the pub after a particularly difficult shift at the surgery, because of a patient who had been convinced that Google made her a better GP than John’s medical degree made him.  A few pints later, and John had been snogging Mary furiously against the wall of the pub.  The relationship had been easy to fall into after that, and slowly but surely, John fell in love.  Sherlock’s loss became easier to bear, never completely going, but slowly fading back, until his wrenching loss was no longer the first thing on John’s mind when he woke up, nor the last thing on his mind before he closed his eyes at night.
As John followed Sherlock across the dance floor of the club, he started to reflect on exactly how he’d gotten into this situation.  It had started the day before, when Lestrade had called them in on a case; three bodies had been discovered, one on each of the preceding three days, and the Yard had come up against a dead end as far as the investigation was concerned.  Sherlock had spent some time examining all of the crime scenes, roundly berating Anderson for everything he had missed, including the vital piece of evidence as far as Sherlock was concerned – a faded but still legible UV stamp on the hand of one of the men that indicated he had been to a club the night he had died.  One of the other men had a coaster from the same club on his coffee table, and when Sherlock examined the third man’s wardrobe, he declared unequivocally that it was obvious – to him, at any rate, although neither John nor any of the Yarders could see it – the man had attended the same club, and had in fact been something of a regular there.
going to cause harm to someone who didn’t deserve it – he would do it, and any time someone asked if he wanted something, he would accept it.  He thought carefully about whether he would have any conditions to this acceptance, but figured that during his time helping Sherlock with cases, he’d broken any number of laws, and the amount of force he had used to subdue some of the criminals they’d caught was definitely immoral, so he didn’t think there was much point in excluding those now.  No, he would accept any invitation or suggestion, and hope that it was enough to change his outlook on life.

“John! Just the man! Could you do me a massive favour? I haven’t managed to walk Jilly yet, and I’ve just been called into work!  I didn’t manage to give her a proper walk yesterday either… She’s champing at the bit to get out…. Could you take her?  Please?”  John swallowed nervously, but he couldn’t refuse…
John felt the remaining traces of Sherlock’s panic dissipate.  He knew he wasn’t being told the whole story, but he also knew it was better to let Sherlock come to him in his own time, rather than push him to get the truth.  He grabbed a tea tray then ran the hottest water he could stand and scrubbed at a couple of cups, glasses, side plates and a knife – he didn’t trust that they had remained clean since the last time he’d got stuck with the washing up.
“How about starting with dinner? Angelo’s?”
“I don’t know why you’re going to all this trouble, there is nothing wrong with me, just sign the form so I can leave,” he said without any preamble.  John was rather taken aback by this, and didn’t mind showing it.  “Mr Holmes, where did you get your medical degree?” he enquired.  “I don’t have a medical degree, and it’s Sherlock, Mr Holmes is my brother,” Sherlock scoffed.  “Then if it’s all the same to you, Sherlock, I’ll use MY medical degree to continue your medical examination.  Could you remove your coat, scarf, jacket and shoes, please?  And just pop on the scales when you have, I need to record your height and weight.”
“I have something I need to show you,” John answered, and he placed one hand on the small of Sherlock’s back, guiding him around the corner onto the almost cobbled road.  As he breathed in again, Sherlock’s eyes widened, and he turned to John, as though seeking validation of his senses.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well if you were serious about keeping people out, you’d have gotten a decent lock put on the door, I mean, anyone could get through this, it took me 30 seconds, and that was using a piece of old fuse wire…”  His voice tailed off.  “Not… good?”
Scottish one didn’t.
“Okay, turn up on to your side facing me,” Sherlock instructed as he turned back to the bowl to dampen another fresh piece of gauze.  John took a deep breath; there was nothing else for it, he was going to have to turn over and expose his arousal to Sherlock.  Sherlock turned back to John, and came face to… face… with John’s erection, which was currently tenting the front of his underwear.  Sherlock drew in a sharp breath, and quickly turned his attention back to the graze on John’s leg, starting the process of cleaning the wound again.  John felt mortified; he’d been staying out of Sherlock’s way for exactly this reason; his attraction to the younger man was growing day by day, and he was determined not to push Sherlock into a relationship he wasn’t ready for.  Now it appeared he was stuck in exactly the situation he’d been trying to avoid.
Sherlock arrived back at the flat two days after John’s heat was over.  He sniffed the air, eyes narrowed and zeroing in on John, before declaring, “You’ve been in heat.”  John had braced himself for more, but Sherlock had surprised him by merely asking, “Was everything okay?”  John had nodded, feeling a little dumbfounded, and that had been the end of it.  It was only a few days later that it had occurred to John that the timing of Mycroft’s mission had perhaps been a little convenient, and he wondered if that was actually the case or if he was getting a bit paranoid in his old age.  He was reminded of a bumper sticker he used to see on an old MG when he was a kid – “It’s not paranoia if they really are out to get you!” – and smiled ruefully.
“Hi Mary,” John responded with a smile, “quite a bit better than the last time you saw me, thanks!”  The blonde started pulling on the blankets, straightening them and tucking them under the mattress, fluffing the pillows, checking John’s water jug.  She looked over at Sherlock, who was still enraptured by his son’s eyes.
While Mr Holmes was gone, John took the opportunity to glance through his records.  No minor illnesses here, but there were more than the average number of broken bones, cuts and abrasions needing stitches at A&E, and a lengthy correspondence from an exclusive rehab centre that John was well aware he wouldn’t be able to afford for himself, should the need ever arise.  John wondered what kind of job it was that needed a medical and resulted in those kinds of injuries, something to do with the previous addiction, maybe?  He was beginning to regret sending Mr Holmes off by himself to produce the urine sample, and wondered whether a blood sample would be an appropriate move.  Just then, the door opened and Mr Holmes entered the room, setting the specimen pot on the desk next to the medical form.
He had judged it well, he knew, as Dr Watson replied “Oh, I think I could manage that,” he replied, “after all, it’s our duty to teach new students coming through, and experiencing the procedure yourself makes you more empathetic to the patient.  I think there are a few other, less conventional techniques for prostate exam I could show you too…”
Three months later...
Dr Watson worked quickly, never asking a question unless the answer was not available to him via Sherlock’s records; Sherlock appreciated his efficiency.  Before long, it was time for the physical examination to begin.  “Take a seat on the couch there, Sherlock, if you would.”  Dr Watson turned to grab a pair of latex gloves, and Sherlock drew in a sharp breath, knowing the assumption he would draw.  It would be a matter of another couple of indrawn breaths in the right places to ensure that Dr Watson revised his initial assumption and started thinking along the same lines as Sherlock, so when he heard Dr Watson snap on the gloves, he hissed inwards again.
He's spend the last two days hiding in the flat with his mobile off, trying to escape them - everyone that's trying to get hold of him is calling my mobile - which wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't been on call last night and therefore awake all night… I suppose I could have given my mobile to Sherlock, but I dread to think what would have happened if Harry or my mum had rung and he'd answered… *shudders*
“Well…. You told me I was bait, I was just making sure I didn’t stick out… I mean, I didn’t know if he was the guy we wanted or not, did I?”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice had come weakly from the other side of the door.  “Oh Sherlock, please!”  At the sound of his voice, Sherlock had started to shoulder barge the door, desperately trying to get through.  “Please Sherlock, I need you, it hurts so much!”  Sherlock redoubled his efforts, calling John’s name as he did, and the lock began to splinter.  He finally managed to burst through, to discover John writhing naked in his bed, a toy in one hand, but with his gun in the other, firmly trained on the door.  As soon as John recognised Sherlock, he dropped the gun to the floor, and moaned.  “Please, Sherlock, I need you, nothing’s helping!”
The sound of a siren heading down Baker Street didn’t stir Sherlock either, he was so wrapped up in his own head; it wasn’t until about half an hour later when there was a loud banging on the front door that he even stirred out of his mind palace.  He had just made the decision to stay where he was when the hammering happened again.  There was the sound of Mrs Hudson opening the door; Sherlock could hear her twittering away at whoever was there, most likely telling them off for the noise they had made.  Then Sherlock heard her gasp, and Lestrade’s footsteps pounding up the stairs.  The door to the flat banged open, and Lestrade was dragging him up off the sofa and shoving him towards the door, shouting at him.  It took a second or two for Sherlock to work out what Lestrade was saying, but when he did, his breath caught and the world seemed to stop.
“Well? What did they say?” Sherlock asked eagerly.
“Hmm… Nice figure, John, you’ve got some lovely muscles under here, why do you keep hiding them behind those baggy jumpers?”  Sherlock smirked at Rob’s words, and John could see from the glint in his eyes that he agreed with Rob.  It was a conversation they had had on a few occasions, mostly when Sherlock was trying to distract John from the results of another failed jumper experiment.
Stamford, is this down to you? Or the rugby lads having a laugh?  I know I said I'd be able to play in the match last week, but I couldn't let Sherlock go off chasing a masked gunman by himself, goodness only knows what sort of trouble he'd have got into…
Sherlock yanked open the curtain, dragging John out into the shop.  He stalked his way around John, examining him from all angles.  The tight black t-shirt fitted snugly around John’s muscular biceps and pectorals, and although his waistline was a little softer than it had been in his army days, it too looked good.  The soft black leather trousers clung to John’s arse and strong thighs, and Sherlock felt his mouth begin to water.
Sherlock had chatted with a few Estonian people, in an attempt to pick up some of the language, but discovered it was extremely difficult, related only to Hungarian and Finnish.  He had managed to pick up a few basics, such as “hello”, “please” and “thank you”, but had decided he knew all the Estonian he would ever need to know when he had discovered that “twelve months” translated to Estonian as “kaksteist kuud” – pronounced almost exactly as the English “cocks taste good”.  Since then, every question John asked with any relation to time was answered with “kaksteist kuud” and a raft of giggles.  John had been informed that Sherlock was going to be twelve months in the bathroom, that he wanted to go out to eat in twelve months, that John had napped for twelve months on the second afternoon they had been there, and that Sherlock had ordered their wine twelve months ago.  It was worth putting up with for the look of sheer joy on Sherlock’s face every time John giggled.
“What do you think?” he asked.
“JOHN EXPERMENT GONE RONG BODYSWAP JILLY AM SHERLOCK”
“Well I’ve done some research Sherlock, everything I’ve looked at suggests we
“Here, use mine.”
John moved directly in front of Sherlock to check the glands in his neck for swelling, as a first indication of infection, and was surprised when Sherlock opened his legs wide, creating a space for John to step into.  Most patients either scrunched themselves awkwardly over their laps in a combination of making it easier for John to reach and protecting their genitals, so John was even more surprised to see Sherlock lean back slightly, forcing John to stand as close as he could in order to reach.  Being so close to this strangely handsome man was stirring some odd feelings in John; back in Afghanistan he had been close with his army colleagues, all boys together and all that, modesty didn’t last long when you lived all day every day with an entire unit, but back here in London he didn’t have any particularly close male friends, and to be honest, he kind of missed the closeness.  He’d taken a couple of female friends out on dates, but was the perfect gentleman, even if they gave indications that they’d quite like him not to be.  John forced himself to be professional; this Sherlock Holmes was a patient, after all, and heaven only knew what sort of trouble he could get into if he wasn’t careful.  As he stepped back, John noticed the erection growing beneath the fabric of those suit trousers, and began to have his suspicions about what was actually happening here.
John returns home, and the new little family try to adjust to life together.  Sherlock has time to start some research into their strange bonding situation.
“Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know...?”  At that moment, a petite young lady in a lab coat came in with a cup of coffee; John could smell it from where he stood and it reminded him of the stuff that came out of the percolator in his student digs.  It was always as thick and as black as tar because nobody could ever agree on whose turn it was to clean the thing out.
*****
Two weeks later, John found himself standing nervously in front of Lestrade’s twin daughters, a dozen or so other six year olds, and various parents who had stayed to help – or so they said; John was sure they were staying to watch his total humiliation.  Even Sherlock had agreed to come along, feeling slightly guilty for causing John to be in the situation in the first place.  If anyone had asked him, however, he would have said the situation was entirely of John’s making; it had been his own idea to say yes to everything, not Sherlock’s.
“Will you try them on John, for me?” Sherlock replied quickly.  He heard John’s sigh of exasperation before the response came, and knew he was reminding himself of his vow.
“How do you do it? Bonding?” William asked.  He’d never really paid that much attention to that kind of thing, he wasn’t very interested in other people, apart from John.  John’s eyes widened a little as he replied.
Finally, the photograph is of the actual flower stall, which is located just outside the old city wall near the Vana Wire hotel - which is also lovely.
“Sherlock, I found this and…” John’s voice shocked Sherlock’s eyes open, as he shoved open the door and entered the room.  Sherlock suddenly realised he hadn’t locked the door, and he was standing in front of the Captain with his cock in his hand, moments away from an orgasm.  He let out a strangled squeak, and turned his back, desperately trying to stuff his cock back into his underwear and to do his trousers up, but he was so aroused, so
Sherlock had replied to his text,  and John had reluctantly acknowledged the wisdom of his words.  Harry had done a pretty good job of caring for him, but John had still felt drained and confused when he had returned to Baker Street.
“Hmmm?” John asked, leaning back towards Sherlock again.  Sherlock raised his upper body from the desk slightly, enough to allow him to turn his head to face John.  His eyelids opened, revealing pale eyes with pupils blown wide open, focused directly on John’s own bright blue eyes.
It's a feeling I'm quite used to, when I was in the army I kind of developed a sixth sense for when people were hidden away and watching, it's like a prickling feeling on the back of the neck.  I had a quick scout round the shop, but couldn't see anyone.  I assume it was just a fan of the blog, that happens sometimes, people want to come and see us but are too shy to speak to us.  If it was you, please do come and say hello - unless you're planning to say you hate the blog!
“No, John, you’re not imagining things…”
Since then, Sherlock had been alone.  He’d had company in the sense of having people in his life, such as the gruff Alpha DI Lestrade, who was not as clever as Sherlock but still clever enough to know not to challenge him about the deductions he made.  Then there was Molly, the pathologist at Bart’s, who Sherlock knew carried a torch for him despite him rebuffing several of her advances in a way that even she couldn’t misinterpret.
Sherlock looked at his next list, numerous bullet points all under the bolded title of Sexual Assault. He picked up his notecards that he was prepared to read off of, verbatim, just like his attorney suggested- but those cards were a watered down, if not sugar coated, version of the things that he had endured. He looked over at Victor who gave him a sly smile. Sherlock eyes thinned as he watched his ex. Why was he going to grant Victor mercy, he was certainly never given any. He placed the cards back down and heard John’s breath hitch, he could practically feel his eyes burning a hole in the back of his blazer.
“ I’m getting ready to enter my last year of medical school.”
His lips quirked up in a smile, “my colleague, best friend…my boyfriend.” As soon as he completed that statement Emily was clinging to his arm making a “aww” noise. Sherlock’s smile could only grow wider as he looked down at her.
“to me?”
"John, is it mild?"
Meet me here in about 20 minutes. Try not to worry. -GL
"No, it's fine I uh like it." Sherlock spoke in a gentle tone.
I'm not dead-SH
Sherlock reluctantly lifted himself off of John’s now soft penis and clenched at the empty feeling left inside him. when he stood his knees shook and John was quick to stand up and hold him close for support. The ex-soldier chuckled softly, secretly proud that he had that kind of effect on his boyfriend. John picked up Sherlock and let him wrap his legs around him and carried him to their shared bathroom down the hall. “shower or bath, baby?” he asked, setting Sherlock on the sink counter.
I first of all want to thank every single one of you who has read this story and taken the time to comment, I truly can’t tell you how happy it makes me to see you enjoying a story I put so much work into. That being said, I feel the need to be very honest with you all. it has been far longer than I would have liked since I have updated a chapter and I am genuinely sorry and feel guilty about it. I want to give you all this update because you truly deserve to know what is going on and the future of this story. In the past few several weeks I have started back being a full time college student, taking 15 credit hours of science and math based classes can really wear you out haha and takes up a lot of time and energy, but aside from that- I have some other things going on. I'm about to get really personal here so if you don’t want to read it skip to the TLDR summary at the end lol.
"Your cock?"
"He mentioned to me not to treat him like he was broken"

Please comment with any ideas suggestions and feedback! i hope you all enjoy this chapter! lots of love <3
"Ah, no. Why aren't you in bed?"
"John" he was still crying, " please come home. I need you."
Mark sighed and ran his hand over his face, " please don't make this any harder on yourself."
He took a sip of water but refused the bar.
“Sherlock… love, when has there ever been a time that I haven’t fully supported and respected your decisions when it comes to something you care so deeply about?”
John laughed " that's a bold question. No not really though, you?"
“can I take you out to dinner?” John asked breaking the silence. Sherlock nodded and kissed him again removing himself from the doctor’s lap.
"Sherlock, love. I need you to wake up"
John smiled slyly and sat down, “ you can, actually. Given you’ve already seen to our previous arrangement…” John waited for Mycroft to nod his head in confirmation, which he did. “and seeing as how you are my future brother in law and the holiday, I have a request for a Christmas present.”
“Sherlock are you- can I come in?” there was no reply just the click of the door being unlocked. John enter quickly, expecting something that resembled what he saw that night, but there was nothing of the sort. Sherlock looked up at him with eyes that pleaded for an explanation, but the man appeared fine, there was no blood, no drugs or even the smell of a cigarette. “sorry, I called out but- I was worried.”
“Emily, stop. We don’t need to talk about that right now. This isn’t about him anymore, it’s about me and you. I want you to get some rest and then we are going to find a way out of here.” Sherlock said as he extended his legs, letting them come to rest on the cool ground.
**********************************************
“more.” Came a low request from above him. If Sherlock wanted more, it was more he would get. John got off of him and grabbed the musicians hands, roughly pulling him off the couch.
“can I see your bedroom?” Victor cut him off and Sherlock’s face did little to hide the fact that he was thrown off by the question.
The judge took the small pause as an opportunity to speak up, “ the blood was from your rectum, correct?”  Sherlock nodded. “ tearing very often leads to infection if not treated, did you seek medical care?”
Despite not sleeping, Sherlock wasn’t the least bit tired and was in fairly good spirits given all things considered. He spent the first few hours of the morning studying his latest samples in his bacteria garden and documenting the data into a spreadsheet to later publish on his website. He sipped on the tea Mrs. Hudson had brought up and even voluntarily ate a few of the biscuits she had sent up as well. As noon approached Sherlock anticipated a text from John as his break time was near.
EXCITING NEWS!!!!!! I HAVE A NEW JOHNLOCK STORY COMING OUT JANUARY 15,2021!

Sherlock managed to eat around 10 bites of spaghetti and drink all of his wine. After John cleaned up the kitchen he went and sat on the sofa and turned on the telly. Sherlock was busy poking some poor animal with a sharp stick to notice John talking to him.
“wh-why? Sherlock, what happened today was, well it was sick!” John stood from his chair and watched the detective do the same, both taking a few steps towards one another.
"What?"
" I can't give you what you want John"

" I have nothing to say to him."
When Victor caught sight of Greg he broke into the widest smile, tears threatened to prick his eyes, so happy that his newfound love had arrived to help him out of this situation. “Greg, I’m so glad you’re here. What’s going on? What took you so long?!” Victor rambled.
"What?! What did I do?" John asked in a panicked tone.
"Alright, good night, sweetheart. I love you.im glad to have you back home." He pushed up to his tip toes and kissed him gently.
Sherlock shook his head " no, I wanted to so bad but I came home." He started pressing small kisses to John's neck.

John smiled, “come on, the food is getting cold.” He took Sherlock’s hand and they sat down on the sofa turning on the tv. John ate his noodles, content to watch Doctor Who with Sherlock’s head in his lap. He smirked to himself and took one of the crab Rangoon’s out of their bag and offered it to Sherlock. “no.” the mop of curls replied, and John rolled his eyes, Sherlock loved those cheese filled wantons. He pulled the casing in half and took one of the crisp corners between his teeth and leaned over top of Sherlock, offering for him to take it out of his mouth. Sherlock glanced up and scoffed, “you’re ridiculous, John.” He said before ignoring the floating food above him. John stayed in that position, giving Sherlock time to change his mind and stretched up to take it from John’s mouth with his own and eating it. John smiled and considered that a small Victory.
"Big or little what, John? You can't just ask me to choose between two things in which I have no idea of the context your talking about. And besides those are both terms that have a wide range of-"
Sherlock pondered how to answer the question, picking his words carefully, “not during the time I was with him.”
Sherlock faced away from John and tears escaped his eyes. He made his way under the hot steam and trickle of the shower water. He inhaled deeply and thanked a higher power that the water could hide his tears.
Unknowing to one another, John and Mycroft realized that the story they had originally been told about that first incident was a lie. Victor hadn’t been under the influence of alcohol at all, he knew what he was doing. Mycroft scolded himself for having the story wrong all these years.
"What are we?" Sherlock said, finally lifting his eyes to meet Johns.
Sergeant Bradshaw got up from his own seat and took a step towards the detective, his voice lowered, “actually, what your telling me is quite shocking and I’m attempting to have some compassion for you but if you want me to handle this like your any other person-fine, that’s just what I’ll do.” He glared, all niceties dismissed as he sat back down and picked up his pen. “who are the other two individuals who can speak to these claims?” he asked
Sherlock’s hands were sweating, something they hadn’t done since the night he told Victor he was leaving for good. He saw Lestrade sitting at his desk and the familiar figure with strawberry blonde hair that was crouched over filling out what looked to be a personal information packet. Lestrade took notice of his presence, “ah, glad you made it.” Lestrade announced and Victor turned around to see who was at the door. Immediately Sherlock began trying to deduce him- he obviously worked a day job, probably something political going by his suit and haircut, as well and the fading tan lines on his wrists. When Sherlock finally let his eyes meet Victor’s, he was surprised to see that Victor seemed to be searching to find where he knew him from. This, in many different ways, made Sherlock upset. All the pain and trauma that this man had inflicted on his life and he could barely recognize who Sherlock was. In a way, Sherlock wished it could stay like this, but he knew the second Lestrade introduced them it would all be over. After-all, how many people were named Sherlock Holmes? Sherlock internally answered his own question. One. there was only one Sherlock Holmes and it was him. Lestrade stood up from his chair and walked to stand closer to the two men. “Victor, this is Sherlock Holmes, the best detective in London and probably the world, he will be playing a substantial role in this case.” As soon as his name left Lestrade’s mouth Victor’s eyes lit up, his brows raised slightly, and the faintest trace of a smirk appeared on his lips. Victor stood from his chair and outstretched his hand to Sherlock. It took every fiber in his being not to flinch or step backwards toward John. “Hi, Victor Trevor. Nice to meet you, Sherlock.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, ‘so this is how we are going to play the game’ he thought before shaking Victor’s hand, the first contact he had made with him in nearly ten years. Sherlock didn’t return the statement, only moved to the side and let John approach. “Sorry, Victor” Lestrade apologized, “I should have warned you, Sherlock’s not the best with conversation but the more you get to know him you, will learn to cherish the moments when he is actually quiet.” Lestrade laughed but no one else did. God bless blissfully unaware Lestrade. “oh, John you didn’t have to come we are just doing an interview and paperwork.” John directed his attention to the detective inspector, still trying to comprehend the scene that just played out before him, “uh, yeah, no that’s okay I have nothing better to do. I’ve got some time off work and thought this would be a good way to stay busy.” John lied. “Victor, this is Dr.John Watson, Sherlock’s-“ John interrupted “Colleague.” Lestrade shot him a quick confused look but dismissed it. “right, Dr.Watson this is Emily Trevor’s brother, Victor. He will be acting as one of our main witnesses throughout this investigation.” Victor reached out to shake John’s hand. John wanted so badly to smack it away and knock him out cold but he followed Sherlock’s lead and acted as if everything was fine. “I’m sorry about your sister.” John chose to say rather than ‘nice to meet you.’ At least he had some genuine sincerity behind his audible remark. Victor nodded and sat back down, finishing up the last few lines of information.
You might have noticed there are a couple of additional tags... And that this is the last chapter.  I'm sorry, really I am... You might also have noticed this is now the first in a series - I promise this will not be the end for Sherlock and John! #sorrynotsorry
“So what, we just wait? For how long? Jeez Sherlock, Mark and Peter will be here in the morning to collect Jilly, are you going to go with them? And what if you need proximity to get back in your own body, what if you get stuck in Jilly’s?  I don’t want to even BEGIN to think about living with her in your body!”
“Hello John, got some post here for you, it was delivered this morning.  Jilly, hasn’t Daddy come to get you yet?” she cooed, scratching Sherlock behind the ears.  Before he could do anything about it, Sherlock’s back leg lifted a little off the floor and began to kick rapidly.  His back arched, and a look of absolute bliss came over his face.  “Aww yes, you like that, don’t you Jilly?” Mrs Hudson said, rapidly devolving into baby talk.  “Yes, you love it when I scratch your special spot.”
“I knew he was up to something, the signs of guilt were written all over him.  It turns out he was swapping decent parts from the Army’s Land Rovers with worn out parts from his own, then requisitioning new parts from stores.  Nobody questioned anything because the new parts were put on the Army’s vehicles, not on his, and he claimed to be buying the parts for his own vehicle through Ebay.  Nobody seemed to think it was strange that the Landies were burning through so many parts either, probably because Westbury was in charge of requisitioning.  It was very clever, really.”
As John entered the dimly lit room, he saw a figure standing by the filing cabinets, a piece of thin wire in his hand which was catching the light thrown off by the small desk lamp.  John flicked on the light switch, and Sherlock turned from the cabinets, a smirk on his face.  John’s first thought was that those camo trousers looked as good as ever, and his second was that Sherlock’s exercise regime was obviously working well, as his arms and chest were beautifully toned, filling out his olive t-shirt nicely.
This is John's sister, Harry.  I thought you all deserved an explanation before this blog was archived, so I'm posting it here.
Sherlock swallowed hard, and dipped his hands into the bassinet.  “Gently,” John murmured, “support his head… That’s it…” Sherlock couldn’t believe how small the little bundle was, how light… He sat carefully down on the side of the bed, tucked up as close to John as he could get so the Omega could scent him.  He allowed John to adjust his arms so that the baby was nestled carefully in the crook of his elbow, and with the index finger of his other hand, he traced a gentle line down the baby’s nose, marvelling at how warm and soft the skin was.  He turned to John with a look of wonder on his face, and found words had failed him completely.  This… miracle… was his son; after months of waiting, he was finally here!  And between them, John and Mycroft had ensured that Sherlock would be the first Alpha to meet his child.  He felt a sudden rush of emotion; love for his brave and stubborn Omega, and a fierce warm rush of filial affection.
The flat, without either of them speaking, was melancholy and quiet. Not a sound from ms.Hudson downstairs, not even the humming of the heater that normally always buzzed.
“Afternoon Sherlock, how are you?” Greg asked as Sherlock sat down in his usual chair in the office.
Phrased that way it made complete sense, and as usual, Sherlock was right. No matter what would have happened in the order of testimonies, Sherlock would have had to say his side of everything. John put a hand on Sherlock’s ribs, subconsciously where he now knew Victor’s name was carved into the delicate flesh. Two pairs of blue eyes met and comfortably stared into one another. They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and for the first time, staring at Sherlock, John thought the younger mans soul seemed at peace. John leaned up to give him a light kiss that was returned with a thin lipped smile. “ I’m going to go shower.” And with that Sherlock left John with only his thoughts.

" yes John I know that. You say it every time I bring up the subject. Can we just talk about this without you treating me like a wounded animal."
“ we have time before we need to get ready… play something for me.” John took the violin from its case and passed it to Sherlock along with the bow. “ play and ill fix breakfast.”

"Why would I be mad at you, I just want to help you." He squeezed him a bit tighter. " do you want to be alone?"
"John"

I really do hope you enjoy it anyway! I hope you all are staying safe and healthy, lots of love <3
"That wasn't what I was going to say, John I'm-" Sherlock was almost begging to speak.
"Sex" Sherlock stuttered.
John bent down, kissing Sherlock’s neck, nipping at the soft skin. He took himself in hand until he reached his full arousal and reached for the lubricant on the nightstand, “ same position as last night?”
"To bed?"
" your a very sexual man John. You want that in a relationship, I can't give that to you. You will grow tired of pornography and your hand and break it off"
Johns morning passed the same, kids with upset stomachs, runny noses, and older teens faking to stay out of school. He waited in anticipation for  lunch, not only to get away from everyone but to check up on Sherlock to make sure he was okay. He felt awful about leaving him alone. Soon enough 1:30 hit and only minutes after his phone alerted him he had a text
" I'm Sherlock I know things!" the detective said with a hand movement.
"What, why?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ew no, mrs Hudson is on her way over ill have her bring Indian if that's good with you?"
Mycroft arrived within the hour and signed the required papers.
“no” Sherlock lied, knowing damn well he hurt it when he backed himself into the corner of the lab.
SMUT WARNING
Hi friends! hope you are all doing well! This will be the last update to this story before I mark it as completed! Just wanted you all to know that the first two chapters of my new story "Suddenly All the Songs Were About you" are posted! I really hope you all enjoy it!
Now to the story: * smut warning*
"I'm not, let's go get breakfast then"
Sherlock placed his face in his hands and took a few deep breaths before standing up and walking back to the microscope. He was grateful John hadn’t walked in on him wallowing in self-pity.
John nodded and pulled his detective into a languid kiss. He was sure they looked like a high school couple, desperate to make out in-between classes, but he didn’t care. When Victor exited the bathroom Sherlock tried to pull back, but John held him tighter. He hoped Victor would drown in the sight of the man he had done wrong so at ease in Johns hold.

Sherlock was taken out of his thoughts when John placed a hand on his shoulder, “move forward.” For once the detective did what he was told, and John sat down behind him. “lay back.” John said opening his arms. Sherlock moved himself between John’s legs and leaned back, his head coming to rest on John’s collarbone. The taller man sighed contently and let his eyes fall shut again.

"I don't believe in luck"
Sherlock sighed and removed himself from John’s lap without a word. He took his violin from its case and began to play a sad melody, one that John hadn’t heard him play before. The doctor couldn’t help but worry that his lover’s choice may set back all the progress he had made. Selfishly he wished Sherlock would have said no and they could begin trying to forget victor ever existed. He watched in sad admiration as Sherlock swayed ever so slightly with the strokes of his bow on the instrument.
"Sex interests me. I hate it, but it's still intriguing"
Sherlock sighed, “Of course it’s not, nothing ever seems to be your division.”
“yes.”
"Alright, wanna share why?"
" I-I can't sleep in my room." Sherlock said with a hint of shame and embarrassment.
"Yes"
"Dinner?"

"Why do you think I'm going to leave?"
" 18"
"Sherlock"
Sherlocked adjusted his position slightly higher on the bed and looked up at John, his eyes still watering from gagging. He was stroking the doctor’s cock in a steady rhythm. John thought he could have came then and there just looking at the detective, but nothing prepared him for what Sherlock said next.
"But you have an actual job?"
Greg quickly called a cab and rushed to 221b. He took the seventeen stairs up two at a time and found the two men laying on the couch, Sherlock’s head in John’s lap. Sherlock sat up quickly and John cleared his throat. They all moved to their respective chairs out of habit. When Sherlock walked past Greg, his nose scrunched up in disgust, “god, you smell like him. I said flirt with him, I didn’t say you had to shag him.”
When quarantine started for my state, back in march, I re-watched all the Sherlock episodes for the first time in a long time and one night decided to read my old fan-fiction- Starving to Please. I saw the potential that 14-year-old me had created and being nearly 5 years clean, felt removed enough from the situation to continue writing. I felt rejuvenated and inspired to pick this story back up, it gave me a creative outlet and a meaningful way to spend my time while not able to go in public.
The judge flipped through some papers and stared down the court room directly to Sherlock. “ The court finds Victor Trevor guilty of the charges of domestic abuse made by Mr. Holmes, I have sentenced Mr. Trevor to five years imprisonment for the charge.” There was a pause “unless there is new evidence to be presented, on all charges and degrees of sexual assault the court has found Victor Trevor…” the tension rose so high in the courtroom it felt like you were choking on it. as if all the oxygen molecules multiplied in size and were causing suffocation rather than an aid to breathing. John felt Sherlock’s hand tighten around his own. “ not guilty.”
Sherlock stood, buttoning his suit jacket at the middle and placed the papers and notecards in front of him. he took a sip of his water. John looked back at Sherlock’s mother who was already sniffling and holding Mycroft’s hand, John almost wished someone was there to hold his. He settled for clasping his own sweaty palms together.
John looked up and smiled at the taller man,"the feeling is mutual" he sat up a bit and placed a small kiss to Sherlock's cheek. Sherlock almost jerked away but forced himself not to. That was another "side effect" of Victor, Sherlock was scared that any attempt at affection would end in being hit, insulted, or held down and forcibly penetrated. He decided then that he would try his best not to let his past with Victor ruin the chance he had with John.
Sherlock nodded. And opened his arms to let John burry his head in his bare chest for a moment.
Inside the small bathroom Sherlock started the water for the tub, deciding against the quickness of a shower. As the water heated he disrobed and looked into the mirror, he felt very indifferent about the person who was staring back at him. He smiled to himself and welcomed the feeling of indifference. Pouring some bath salts into his water and stirring them around he was about to get in when he remembered the razors tapped to the top of the sink cabinet. He pulled them off and held them in his palm, tracing over them with his finger, careful not to cut himself. The piece of tape held four of them. two boxcutter blades, one from a broken shaving razor and the last was from a pencil sharpener he took apart, the very first time he marred his skin. That blade was dull, had traces of rust on it by now but he had kept it. Of all the ridiculous things he had let himself feel sentiment towards, that sharpener blade had to be the most ridiculous. He looked at it and saw lonely nights and cold days, where the only warmth was when his own blood pooled at the top of his skin. The thought of getting rid of that blade seemed unfathomable…until now. He was sure the feelings would shift day by day, but in this moment he wouldn’t have felt anything if those blades disappeared. For better or worse he would always have the memories they left behind. He put them on the counter and stopped the water before delicately climbing into the tub and leaning his head back to relax.
Is Victor with you? - SH
" we're you in a relationship with the person who assaulted you?"
John seethed, Mycroft’s stomach churned, Greg fought back another wave of nausea and the rest of the court didn’t look much better. Emily and her family, except Victor, all sat with quiet tears falling from their eyes. Everything got worse the more Sherlock divulged about his life, when would it stop? How much worse could it get?
"Emily Trevor" Sherlock sighed, " I know her family"
John fixed an ordinary small breakfast with eggs, some hash browns, and fruit. They say across from each other and John held his fork out to Sherlock with a bite of egg on it. " please?"
"You would be okay without me John. You did it before, sorry for that again."
“please.” Was all Sherlock said. It wasn’t something the inspector had ever heard him say with genuine emotion behind it, it shocked him but also caused a pit in his stomach to open up. Greg moved to close his office door and propped himself up against the desk directly in front of Sherlock.
Christmas eve was upon them. the couple arrived at the Holmes’s a few hours before dinner would be served. Sherlock’s mother insisted on her son showing John around the farm, she watched from the kitchen window as the pair walked with gloved fingers intertwined across the property. When they came back inside John helped Sherlock out of the Belstaff and kissed the tip of his nose that had been reddened by the cold, making the detective roll his eyes at the cliched act. The two went off into the small den and pulled two arm chairs near the fire, moving them so that they could face one another as they warmed up. Conversation came easier than ever before, it all seemed to get easier with each day that passed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It doesn’t matter, I’m not hungry. Your choice.” Sherlock was still focusing hard on the slide in front of him but Victor’s voice lingered in his mind ‘you haven’t been going hungry...’ it taunted him.
John’s mouth quirked into a smile, “ it’s a bit complicated, but I suppose eating disorders and recovery is. I can get him to eat most days, never anything much but he is making progress. I have noticed though… when he’s overwhelmed with emotion or when he’s upset, his first defense mechanism is to refuse food. He fights me about it much more than usual during those times. I’ve been letting it slide during those moments, but I fear with this case just beginning it will be an uphill battle to keep him fed.”
Sherlocks phone buzzed and there was a text from Lestrade asking him to come to the station to fill out some additional paperwork. Sherlock threw on his coat and scarf and made his way to New Scotland Yard. When he walked through the doors he was greeted by the familiar smell of coffee and printer ink. The first person to catch sight of him was none other than everyone’s *favorite* officer Sally Donovan. She greeted him by rolling her eyes “Oi, why did you run out on Emily Trevor’s case the other day? That’s a new level of rude even for you, freak. The boys sister has gone missing and you won’t even have the courtesy to give him a moment of your time to speculate where she may have gone off to?” she spat the words at him as if it was the most vile thing that had ever happened. “I’m not involved in that case anymore and regrettably I don’t know what happened to his sister. The great thing about being a consulting detective is that I don’t have to take any case I don’t want, and I DO NOT want that case-end of story.” Sherlock replied in a firm tone as he continued walking down the hall to Lestrade’s office.
Sherlocks breath hitched at the pet name " I don't know, I suppose It just felt like the right thing to say"
Almost mothing came of their conversation, of course Mycroft knew people in France-even a few of Sherlock’s homeless network, but not Billy Wiggins and Sherlock made sure to leave no trail. John couldn’t bear to wait in the hotel room any longer. He took a taxi to the 8th arrondissement and began walking to any and all entrances marked on a map one of the homeless networkers gave him yesterday. He wasn’t going to go down, but he needed to kill time, and this seemed like the best way to do it.
"I don't know if I'll be back for the rest of my stuff today or not." He shot angrily
John was angered that there was nothing to do but wait. John Watson was always a man who took action, made the first move, he had been a leader on his high school rugby team, then in the army, in med school, and throughout his entire professional career. But now he had to sit back and hope that Sherlock would return soon.
“please clarify the extent of the sexual assault.”
Lestrade had truly turned on the charm for tonight’s date, and if he didn’t know that Victor had kidnapped his own sister he would have actually been interested in the guy. As the wine flowed, so did their conversations. It seemed as if they had talked about every event from their lives. The restaurant was closing and had to ask the men to leave, but the DI hadn’t obtained the information he had sought out yet. They stood near Victor’s car under the street lamps, “I don’t really want to go yet…” Lestrade trailed off, looking towards the sidewalk and holding one of Victor’s hands in front of them.
"Really?" John said with almost too much joy in his voice for it to be on a friend level.
“for purposes of recording I need his name said aloud.”
John stood and walked over.
"So sex..." Sherlock spoke.
Sherlock nodded, knowing that John had only fingered him with two before. He felt John add a third digit and inhaled deeply as it stretched him even further. It didn’t hurt, it was just added pressure that soon turned back to pleasure. John continued a few minutes longer before leaning over to press a kiss to the small of Sherlock’s back and withdrawing his fingers. “how do you feel, baby?”
Sherlock sighed and then moved to get up from the table.
"Apology accepted. Are you done?" Sherlock shot back, still rude but not quite as harsh."
Sherlock was already up and dressed in a purple shirt that was once tight on him but now was a bit loose.
"Mmmm"
Sherlock rarely found himself mesmerized but lately It happened more often, and John was always the reason why. Sherlock loved admiring John but didn’t always get the chance to let his eyes linger as much as he would have liked when they were caught in the heat of the moment. But now there was nothing keeping him from admiring his lover. Even being out of army for several years, John kept the frame of a soldier. Sure, some of the once sinfully defined muscles had faded over time but his body was toned and magnificently sculpted. Sherlock often found himself admiring how broad John’s shoulders were compared to his own and always took advantage of running his hands over John’s torso when they were cuddling.
"Please, I'm sorry"
"I take pride in my hair,John"
Get updates and keep up with me on twitter @OhHeyyItsAnna
" good, I'm proud of you." John wrapped an arm around him and led him to the sofa.
"Why are you dressed?"
"John, drive him to the hospital. I'll have people waiting, how bad is it?"
“Ya creeped out yet?”
"What is there to talk about, you obviously know what's going on" sherlock said hurt and embarrassed.
Sherlocks heart fluttered at the pet name, "I hate it John"
"I could pull it off"
John moved up stairs and started packing things, Sherlock just continued to stand in the kitchen with a blank look on his face. Wondering what the hell he had done. And if John was really going to leave.
Victor reached his free hand up to caress Greg’s face before holding it, “We could go back to my place,” He whispered looking up at Lestrade before connecting his lips with those of the silver haired man. Lestrade kissed back and nodded in approval.
"I guess I won't then."
AUTHORS NOTE
“I guess it’s my turn now.” John said with a sigh. “what do you mean?” Sherlock questioned and John took one of his hands in his own. “things didn’t exactly go fine at the yard. Yes, he made some comments and asked personal questions, but he hit a nerve with me, and I snapped. I didn’t hit him or really hurt him- just threatened him a bit. He threatened me back with ‘emotional leverage’ about you, but I just thought you should know.” John said with his head hung a bit low in shame.
Sherlock climbed the stairs and saw John was still waiting by the window. As he came into view John turned and smiled at him, “Everything okay?” he asked and Sherlock nodded bending down to kiss him, wrapping his arms around his waist and let his hands come to rest on his lower back. “want to tell me what you all talked about?” John asked, his curiosity getting the better of him. Sherlock mumbled a little laugh, “I just warned him not to get too attached to Victor.” John blinked up at his boyfriend, “Sherlock Holmes, you are a good man.” Sherlock sighed slightly annoyed by the emotion, “yours.” He hummed. And John nodded against his chest, “My good man.” The doctor perched onto his toes and kissed his lover passionately, “my brilliant, wonderful, sexy as hell, good man.” He said nipping at Sherlock’s neck causing the detective to laugh. The mood of the flat quickly began to shift into a seductive and sultry lull.
John realized what he menu and nodded his head in understanding. "Why didn't you tell me, you knew I was worried anyway."
When Sherlock was released from the hospital John guided his tired body into the cab. The sun was beginning to rise over the city just as they arrived at the hotel. John was practically supporting Sherlock’s body with his own. The positioning was awkward and after only a few steps he picked up his lover and carried him the rest of the way to their room. Sherlock had been quiet ever since he had woken up and it was hard to tell if it was from exhaustion or because he was still searching for the right things to say.
He pulled on his robe and walked downstairs to put the kettle on and turned on the shower as he made his way back upstairs. He crouched down next to Sherlock, “ the showers warming up.” He said kissing the detectives head as he opened his eyes once more “ I have two options for you.”
Back in London Lestrade had just finished a rather long day at the yard and had halfway invited himself to Victor’s house. Lestrade stood nervously at the door holding a bottle of scotch and knocked apprehensively. When Victor opened the door Greg nearly dropped the expensive liquid. “my god, what happened to you.” Lestrade said shocked as he took in the sight before him. One of Victor’s eyes was swollen but not bruised, he had cuts and deep scrapes across his face. Victor tried to smile but winced at the pain it brought, he stepped aside to welcome Greg in, “some lunatic attacked me as I came out of Tesco last night, slammed my head into the pavement a few times too.” Victor explained. Greg brought a gentle hand to the other man’s cheek and rubbed his thumb over one of the deeper cuts. “I otta choke the bastard” he whispered, “did they catch who it was?” Victor shook his head no and led Greg to the couch.
The blogger would have liked for his detective to stay there forever but unfortunately, he had to use the bathroom. He let his hand rest on Sherlocks shoulder and he shook him slightly.
Sherlock registered that he pulled away from John, something he hadn’t done in quite some time. As soon as he realized what he had done he brought himself close to John, grabbing the shorter man’s strong hands and placing them on his waist and leaning to kiss him. The weird tension seemed to be forgotten and both men were silently grateful for it. “John. I need to call Lestrade.” Johns eyebrows furrowed slightly, “well, yes I assume you- “Sherlock cut him off, “no, I need to call him and ask him to come here so we can talk, alone.” He emphasized the last word and John felt a twinge of disappointment that he wouldn’t be included in whatever conversion was about to unfold between Sherlock and Greg. “oh. Alright. Well, I guess I’ll just head out…again.” John said mildly annoyed. “what, why?” Sherlock asked, blatantly confused. “You said you wanted to talk with Lestrade alone.” John replied reaching to take his coat off the rack. Sherlock moved to stand in front of him, “I meant without Victor. Not you.” He held the side of John’s face and kissed him passionately, as he put John’s coat back in its place. John slowly walked Sherlock back towards the couch and sat him down before straddling his lap and kissing him harder. Sherlock returned the kiss with just as much passion and enthusiasm as he was met with, when John started trailing kisses down his neck thoughts of Victor just hours before filled his mind but were quickly dismissed. Sherlock let out a wanton moan when John nipped at the nape of his neck, “Call Lestrade.” he whispered, moving his head to once again look Sherlock in the eyes. “but” Sherlock began, and John cut him off with a kiss, “we can finish this later.” John removed himself from Sherlock’s lap and handed him his phone.
John moved down the steps and past Sherlock.
John nodded and smiled, " wanna put on a film while we eat?"
“Sherlock, you don’t-I’m fine.”
John wanted to ask the most redundant question of ‘are you okay?’ but he didn’t. Of course Sherlock wasn’t fucking okay and he didn’t have to put on a brave face and act like he was. John took a tentative step towards him and when Sherlock didn’t back away, he brought him into his arms. The detective body heaved with each sob. John was hurting, he would have to be a real sociopath not to, but he didn’t cry- he didn’t even feel like crying anymore. He was teetering between numbness and overwhelming anger, but it was all overshadowed by the need to comfort his boyfriend. “I…I didn’t know. I had no idea about-”
Sherlock stamped up the stairs to 221B, and threw himself down on the sofa, his back to the world.  He didn’t understand his Omega; all he had done was what any Alpha would do, to look after his precious, pregnant mate and make sure he didn’t need to do
John just wanted life to go back to normal; he wanted people to stop tiptoeing around him as though he was a poor broken thing.  Greg and the other Yarders had tried inviting him out for drinks down the local after a case had been closed, but he had sat in the corner moping into his pint, and then he had stopped accepting the invitations.  After a while, the invitations had stopped coming, and John had felt increasingly insular.  John had always been the one to encourage Sherlock to go out for dinner, and without his push, dinner became a takeaway - or more often, leftovers - as John didn’t eat much and didn’t have the inclination to cook anymore.  Sherlock had made dinner once or twice, and while the food had been amazing – it was “simple chemistry, John,” after all – John had pushed his food around the plate a few times, then smiled a sad smile and gone to bed.  Sherlock didn’t know how to make the effort after that, he didn’t know how to fix John.
Sherlock stood, listening for a moment.  The corridor outside was silent; everyone was busy elsewhere, so Sherlock undid the button of his trousers and slid the zip down.  He groaned with relief, and thought fleetingly that it might be enough for him to be comfortable, but soon realised that would not be the case.  He palmed his cock through the black stretch cotton of his underwear, hissing as his touch sent sparks through his entire body.  He dragged his hand along the length from the root to the tip, moaning involuntarily, and shoved his hand inside his underwear.  Sherlock gripped his hard cock, sliding his hand slowly along its length, his hips thrusting into his hand.  His eyes closed, and his breathing deepened, as the precome started to flow from the tip.  Inside his mind, Sherlock replayed the sight he had seen in John’s room; he remembered the sheen of sweat on John’s brow as he had thrust into his hand.  He heard John saying those filthy things, vowing to fuck him and fill him, and Sherlock’s moans grew louder.  He felt the tingling start in the base of his spine, and thrust harder, gripping tighter.
As is Sherlock's new dating service, apparently, since he's decided that Molly is incapable of finding herself a new beau and he's going to do it for her - including interviews for all the potential applicants - I can imagine that's going to go well…
John pushed back his chair and stood, tugging his shirt down, “let’s go and talk to Anderson then.”
Two days later, a rather cagey email came back, asking what Sherlock's interest was in the article.  After a week or so of furious emailing back and forth, Sherlock had found out that although his and John's case was by no means the only one Dr Beardshaw had heard of, it did seem to be the longest gap between the bite and bond that she'd come across.  Dr Beardshaw herself was not available for a meeting, however, as she was attending a conference in Alabama, and John was not prepared to travel with Alex, and the idea of leaving him made Sherlock feel physically sick.  One other piece of information had Sherlock off in a flurry of research again; apparently Dr Beardshaw had been corresponding with another Omega colleague who had been investigating other couples who had experienced the same delayed instant bond that John and Sherlock had - and he seemed to think he had some evidence for some rather special chemistry going on between them.  He was calling it the soul bond.
Despite John’s rather unconventional trip around the park, everything was fine until the Jack Russell ran straight across one of the paths that ran round the park, and John ended up with some rather nasty gravel rash.  Both of his exposed arms were scraped from wrist to elbow, his face and his thigh were scraped also.  As Jilly rounded a curve, John was swung round, twisting so he was pulled along on his back, extending the gravel rash around to the back of his thigh as the gash in his jeans ripped open even wider.  The Jack Russell jumped through the bars of a railed fence, into a bush and disappeared; Jilly was too big to fit through, so she stood milling about on the pavement.  John was able to struggle to his feet, and with the help of a couple of giggling students who were walking through the park was able to make it back to Baker Street with Jilly.  He dropped her off with Mrs Turner, grimacing as the ache really started to set in, and made his way back to number 221b.
Tonight though… tonight was different, John was again bathed in sweat, his face and bare chest shining in the little light coming into the room, but his expression was one of arousal.  As Sherlock continued to watch, John pushed at the light blanket covering him, and exposed the trail of golden hair at the bottom of his abdomen which ran down into the grey cotton of his pyjama bottoms, currently tented by an impressive erection.  Sherlock watched, unable to tear his gaze away as John palmed his cock over the thin fabric and squeezed the hard flesh beneath his hand, hips thrusting upwards.  Sherlock felt himself react, the tight knot of arousal at the base of his spine flooding through his groin, and he pulled at his trousers, adjusting his uncomfortably constricted erection.  John moaned, talking in his sleep as he thrust lazily into his hand.
Just at that moment, the door opened, and a pretty petite blonde Beta woman walked in.  “Hi John, how are you feeling?” she asked, with a smile in his direction.  Sherlock gave her his best glare, but the baby in his arms gurgled a little, and he suddenly found he couldn’t spare her the attention.
“I felt so down, I’d lost a wife and a baby in one fell swoop, and I was living here with you and didn’t know I could ever be happy again… If I had known how you felt, I’d have had something to live for, something to lift my life… I’m not saying I’d have jumped into your arms, of course not, I needed time to grieve for what I lost, but I’d have had something there… Do you understand what I’m saying, Sherlock?”
Sherlock made his way to John’s office, knocked at the door and waited.
*****
The man turned back, looking at John as he spoke.  “Is that what?"
Finally, if you did enjoy reading, please let me know!
The next couple of hours were spent either lounging about on the sofa, tongue-bathing or trying bad-temperedly to fit a Great Dane body comfortably into Sherlock’s armchair, depending on who was being considered.  John dozed off again; he’d only had a few hours of bad sleep thanks to the amount of alcohol he’d drunk the night before.  He was awoken rather abruptly by the sound of Sherlock shouting, “Oh for God’s sake, what the hell is that taste?!”
The case had been wrapped up fairly quickly after that, the man was in custody and, according to a Lestrade who had spent the weekend watching too many old Noir private detective movies, “singing like a canary”.  Sherlock had rolled his eyes, while John and Greg had started talking in what they liked to think of as their gangster voices, and coming up with as many stereotypical gangster-style phrases as they could.  They had had a fun fifteen minutes, and the fact that it annoyed Sherlock was a bonus, they felt.
John swallowed nervously.  “Yes,” he said without hesitation.  They met in the centre of the room, John’s journal discarded carelessly on the floor next to his chair, so close to the open fire that the edges of the cover were starting to curl and smoke.  Sherlock brought his hand up to the back of John’s head, curling his fingers into the short grey-blonde hair.  He bent his head downwards, and John stretched his neck up to meet him.  Their lips touched, and John sighed, gripping Sherlock’s dressing gown in his fists and pulling the taller man towards him.  The kiss became more passionate, John’s tongue licking at the seam of Sherlock’s lips, his eyes closing as Sherlock granted him entry.  The taste was delicious; John thought that he had never tasted anything quite so amazing before.  It was a combination of tea and cigarettes, with an underlying sweetness and synthetic strawberry flavour.  He kissed into Sherlock’s mouth as though his life depended on it, Sherlock responding in kind.  He was vaguely aware of a soft “flump” sound from behind him, and then Sherlock was pulling away, pointing at the fire.
“Oh, you ... you told him about me?”
“I fed you?” he said, in a tone of disbelief, but even as he spoke, Sherlock could feel the contentment radiating from John – the kind of contentment that only came from an Omega who had been provided for by his Alpha.
John had decided Sherlock should be brought up to speed with the whole of Doctor Who, right from the very beginning.  That meant all six hundred and ninety five episodes that comprised the original series, and then starting on the rebooted series after that.  Sherlock didn’t really enjoy the older series, but he
John attempted to peel his eyes open, managing on the third or fourth attempt.  He sat up – or rather, he moved an inch or two from the sofa, realised his head had been cleaved in two by a maniac with some sort of siege weapon, and reclined again, closing his eyes.  After a few minutes of very careful exploration, he realised there was no wound that he could find, and reasoned that there must be another explanation for the blinding pain in his head.  Slowly things began to come back to him; the pub with Lestrade the night before, the pints, the shots, the kebab on the way home – there was the explanation for the rumbling in his guts, at least – and finally collapsing on the sofa because getting up the seventeen stairs to the flat had been hard enough, let alone the rest of the way up to his room.
“Westbury and Anderson.”
Sherlock lay back on the sofa in a pair of loose pyjama trousers, a t-shirt, and his second best dressing gown, and glared at the letter Mrs Hudson had brought up with his cup of tea that morning.  Bloody Lestrade!  Sherlock huffed, irritated that his morning was about to be ruined; why should he need to have a medical to carry on doing Lestrade’s job for him?  Then again… Sherlock had noticed the new doctor down at the local surgery, and deduced that he was a lot more flexible about his sexuality than he realised.  Flinging himself off of the sofa, Sherlock stalked off to the bathroom to run a bath, and head out to see if he could manipulate Dr Watson into seeing him.  Sherlock had studied his comings and goings on his regular visits to be patched up after numerous run-ins with London’s criminal classes, and knew that today would be a good day to visit the surgery.
“Oh, I’d say they’ve got really close, Mrs Hudson.  Got a real bond,” John said, and he sniggered.
“I need to introduce you to our son, Sherlock, and he’s going to want feeding soon…” Sherlock turned to the bassinet for the first time, gazing down at the small bundle, wrapped in a pale blue blanket.  He stepped around the end of the bed to the side with the bassinet, gazing down into a pair of eyes the same colour as his own.
toast,” John replied, with an amused smile on his lips.  As Sherlock looked at him, he could see the telltale crumbs dotted over John’s chest that confirmed he had, in fact, eaten.
“What the hell are you playing at, Sherlock, John’s been in labour for half an hour!!”
Sherlock turned slowly, starting to realise why the pattern of indentations was so familiar, and looking at John with an expression of combined disbelief and amazement.  John began to feel a pervading sense of realisation that he knew was not coming from him.  “Tell me, John, did you have a friend called William when you were a little boy?”
Sherlock can't concentrate for thinking of the night he watched John Watson... and it's affecting The Work.  He finds a way to relieve his frustration and has a breakthrough.
“It was a few weeks before Mycroft could get me safely out of the country to start with, so I collected the flowers myself because they were proof to me that you were still breathing, that you hadn’t given up.  They were proof that it had been worth it, that I had kept you safe.  Once I was… away… one of Mycroft’s minions used to collect them for me, and send them on.  Some places I went to I received a parcel regularly, with your flowers in.  Other places were harder to get packages to me, and I’d receive one, then nothing for weeks on end.  I never let anyone else remove the petals; that was always my task.  I could imagine your fingers brushing each one, and it made me feel closer to you, as though I was touching something you had just handed to me…” He trailed off, slowly opening his eyes to look at the myriad colours in the box before him.
“John….” Sherlock warned, sternly.  “What is it? What do you know?”
After about an hour, John had struck up a temporary friendship with the bartender, Kelly.  It was quite freeing, he thought, to be able to talk to a girl when you already knew you weren’t going to get anywhere with her, and so you could just talk about things that interested both of you without having to watch every word or try to impress her.  They’d already discovered a mutual love of music, and John was currently trying to convince her to give Paul Weller a try, rather than the grunge that was her usual fare.  As Kelly wandered off to serve another customer, John turned to look out over the crowd, and realised he had company.  A smartly dressed young man was looking at him with a lop-sided smile, and spoke when John registered he was there.
About two hours after he'd dozed off on the sofa, John woke abruptly when Alex started to fuss.
John was terrified.  His labour seemed to be progressing too quickly, even though he realised the backache that had plagued him all night was most likely due to him having being in the early stages.  He needed Sherlock.  During childbirth, the Alpha’s scent kept the Omega calm and their pheromones reacted with the Omega’s brain chemistry to ensure the proper dilation of the birth canal.  If no Alpha was with the Omega, things could go very wrong very quickly; if the birth canal didn’t dilate enough, it could result in trauma to the child, and major damage to the Omega, sometimes even death.  For this reason, the hospital kept a couple of unbonded Alphas on staff in the maternity unit for any Omegas who came in without an Alpha, but John had flatly refused to have one of them in with him.  Although the babies developed a bond with the Alpha in the room at their birth, there were drugs that could be given to break the bond with only a minor lasting effect on the child, and besides, new therapies were being developed every day to help them overcome the effects.
“Captain Watson!” he said, leaping to his feet and dropping his glasses on the table.
The second time John’s heat had come on, it had been extremely unexpected – not only had John’s heats always been weak affairs compared to what some of his other Omega friends had described over the years, they were erratic too, and since John had had a heat only two months previously he hadn’t been expecting another one for at least a month yet.  As luck would have it, John had been at Harry’s, making the most of what appeared to be a sober period in her life to reconnect, and she had immediately shoved him into her spare room and thrown a handful of Omega toys in his direction with a wry grin.  “You know I haven’t had any need for these since Clara left, at least I can get a little satisfaction knowing you’re suffering on your own too!”  John had thrown the lock on the door – Harry was his sister, but she was still an Alpha, and an Alpha with a drinking problem at that so he wasn’t taking any chances with her biology - and just got on with it.
The conversation, which had started from nothing and gone nowhere, made them see each other's world in a new way. John was no longer the pragmatic and quiet but brave hero from one good fairy tale, and Sherlock turned out to be a dreamer. They listened to whispers of secrets, hoping to be heard. You cannot deceive your own heart, for it knows the true path, knows all secret desires. And the whole world was now open before them...
- Because you and I both believe that this world isn't such a cruel place. And I'm ready to accept you, James. Are you ready?
- You.
- What? А?
- You mean like violin lessons? How about horseback riding? Fencing? Shooting? I always thought of you, but at one time you were depressed. I still don't know what happened.
- I'm like you - coming to terms with life and dreaming of something bigger. But seriously, when did it all start? I mean, you and I used to be friends. If I can put it that way. Why did you suddenly change your attitude towards me?
- You don't know anything about him. James...
- Well, it's not hard. You're Scottish, but you're not a redhead. Your hair's blond enough, I assume you inherited it from your father. Your middle name is Hamish. No Englishman would give that as a first name, I mean at baptism, and as your middle name is John, more reversible in speech, I can deduce that your mother is English. Blood mix, pure genetics, chemistry, and we get you. It's also the accent from the north of Scotland that gives you away.
Before Sherlock left, they were both walking around the garden. The rain had already stopped, but the sky was still hidden behind thick grey clouds. Not daring to hold hands, they just stood side by side.
- Look at the sky, James; it's there for you. Look at the face of every person you pass on the street; all those faces are for you. And this street, and the land itself; it all belongs to you. All these things are yours, as well as all other people's. Remember that when you wake up in the morning and think you have nothing. And also, you have me. Sherlock Holmes, your friend. And John. You're not alone, never have been.
- Do you?
- Don't misunderstand him, John. He wants to get better, but he doesn't know how. He lacks faith in himself and in his future.
- What?
- Sherlock... what are you doing...
- And why is John Watson so angry, eh? He's just determined to change. Is that a bad thing?
On the way home, each thought differently, but something united their thoughts. The anticipation of tomorrow. The two boys, very different from each other, were suddenly friends. It was incredible for both of them. Already at home, as night fell on the city and people slowly entered the realm of Morpheus, John and Sherlock looked up at the stars. Across the city, when the distance was measured in tens of kilometres, they were still connected by a single sky.
- Actually, I live at my grandmother's. It's her house. My family never had that kind of luxury, unless... No, never mind. Where's your room?
On a day off, it was business as usual. Morning mail. Redbeard dutifully brought the paper into the house, swiped the bacon off John's plate and ran out into the street. After breakfast, John went shopping with his grandmother. But the red dog was gone. Redbeard did not respond. It became a little unsettling, but still normal, because John knew his dog. He'd never run away from home for more than a couple of hours. Already since lunchtime, John started looking for his friend. He walked around the immediate area with Sherlock, asking around the neighborhood, but everyone said they didn't see any lonely dog wandering around.
White clouds were gathering over England. Here, in the realm of rain and fog, the winds often prevailed. It was noticeably colder outside. John was going for a walk with the dog. He wore the warm scarf his grandmother had knitted him for Christmas, his favourite coat and his black, slightly worn boots. John didn't want to go to that park at all, but it was as if his dog understood that this was the time to be there. Sherlock was sitting under a tree reading a book. John couldn't find the words, so he was afraid to approach. Silence could be misleading, and the wrong words could ruin their friendship.
James himself favoured the exact sciences, such as mathematics or physics. Mathematics, he said, encompasses not only truth but also the highest beauty - a beauty that is cold and austere, like the beauty of sculpture.
After that, John gave his jacket to Sherlock and started to go home. John expected nothing in return, but the words of gratitude reached his heart. At that moment a spark was kindled that would soon burst into a bright flame. At the gate young Holmes caught up with him and tried to say something, but it only amused John. At first.
- William Sherlock Scott Holmes. Just Sherlock. See you tomorrow, John.
- I do. It's friends and attention and love and care. I... We can give you all that. Just take a step towards us.
- Why... why did you agree to this?! It was all for John, wasn't it?!
- Not until after we've done our history assignment!
- Sherlock, I couldn't say it because I didn't believe it myself... I closed myself off, but I realised it was a mistake. Then it was too late. You stopped coming to class because your brother started teaching you himself. At the academy, you're always reading, writing or talking to others. I wanted your attention... I wanted you! Eventually these attempts turned into bullying, but I couldn't stop. It seemed to be the only way... And then John came along. You found a new friend, and I was furious...
A strange feeling enveloped the two of them. Like hoarfrost on the cold ground. The silence of this world, that seemed so unreal, artfully created by someone, was interrupted. Sherlock used sarcasm to hide his own emotions and wonder if he was capable of sincerity, and John simply paced among the murky light of the lights, hidden behind the shroud of that very snow.
- The answer is no. He couldn't.
Being a true Scot, he is willful, hot-hearted, but kinder than anyone else. There, he was truly free. Little Watson's favourite time of day is evening, towards sunset. The sun is slowly retreating beyond the unattainable horizon, giving way to his sister Moon. The cold breeze from the fjords brings something far away that you can't find in your own land, which is probably why you begin to think that you are lonely. In the Scottish fields John would run with his dog, flying a kite, or sometimes ride his father's horse. A noble Clydesdale called Alasdair, which is a family favourite. John was upset when he had to leave for London because it was impossible to bring the horse with him, but his mother was never able to sell him. Despite all the pain, that horse belonged to her husband and he gave it to his son. John now lives with his grandmother in Kensington in a huge mansion that has been passed down through the generations. The neighbourhood itself truly reflects the English atmosphere. Victorian architecture, stunning green streets and upscale restaurants.
A drizzling rain at 8 am. A piercing sense of loneliness and a dream to soar to the heavens just at the sight of the grey buildings. Treading lightly in the world without leaving their footprints anywhere seemed to be the only way for each of them, but they went against all the rules and chose their own.
They sat on the silver-tinted blue silk, grabbing every breath because there wasn't much oxygen either. Disheveled hair and a half-unbuttoned shirt, a naive but sly deceptive look. They already knew who was playing this game, but they were in no hurry to expose it, or else there would be no excitement to play this game to the end.
“Sorry, family joke from when I was a kid, I meant my bonding gland.”
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” he yelled furiously.  The file dropped, and the curly black haired, pale faced reader was revealed, looking utterly perplexed at the question.  “I’m reading my file.  Don’t worry, I haven’t violated anyone’s privacy, I’ve only read my own.”  He rolled his eyes, as though John’s question was the most unreasonable thing anyone had ever said to him.  In less than a minute, John was across the room, snatching the file from his hands, and throwing the feet from his desk.  “What about my privacy?” he roared angrily.  “This door was locked, how the hell did you get in?”
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221b Baker Street.”  He gave a funny click and wink, looked at Mike and said, “afternoon,” then left.
At his words, Sherlock leapt across the room, tearing his clothes off as he went.  “Are you sure?” he growled, visibly fighting the urge to just
The first trick was a total disaster.  He’d managed to get as far as secreting the coin up his sleeve without anyone noticing apart from a few of the parents, but when he waved his ‘magic wand’ – in reality a piece of dowel from a DIY store that he’d painted black and white – the coin had flown from his sleeve across the room and he’d been completely unable to find it.  The children were in fits of giggles, as were most of the parents, and John was beetroot with embarrassment.  The second trick was just as bad, the little boy John had chosen to help him had helpfully pointed out that John had just slipped his card onto the bottom of the deck, rather than into the middle as he’d said he was going to, so John was forced to push the card into the centre of the deck where he promptly lost it.  All of the children found this extremely funny, while John just felt more and more humiliated.  Fifteen minutes later, and John was sat at the kitchen table, with a gaggle of small children hanging from his arm, begging him to do another funny trick.  The Lestrades finally managed to get him a little space by starting a game of pass-the-parcel in the living room, and John was finally able to relax a little.
John strode over to the young man, grabbed his hips with his gloved hands and spun him around, causing Sherlock to fall slightly off balance with both hands pressed onto the couch.  Pressing his hands to the insides of Sherlock’s thighs, John pressed his legs further back and wider apart.  “You may find it more comfortable to fold your arms on the couch and rest your head on them; this position can cause backache if held for too long, neither bent not upright.”  Sherlock complied immediately, responding to the unspoken authority in John’s manner.  As his back arched into its almost horizontal position, his buttocks spread and his pink hole was revealed.  John fought the urge to drop to his knees and bury his tongue inside, and won, but barely.  “I haven’t crossed the line yet,” he told himself, “everything up until now has been medically necessary… And I’m just being thorough, it’s not as though there are never any men under 50 diagnosed with prostate cancer… As luscious as that arse is, I can’t think of any reason on earth why shoving my tongue inside would be seen as a medical procedure!”
Mrs Hudson had popped upstairs for another visit on the third day Xander had been home, and was shocked when Sherlock thrust him at her, almost in tears, and babbling that he couldn’t do it, that he didn’t know how to be a father, that she should take Xander away and let someone else look after him.  Mrs Hudson had taken one look at them both, picked up Xander and sent Sherlock off to bed for a solid 8 hours of sleep.  After that, she made a point of coming up to visit at least twice a day.  She came first thing in the morning as Sherlock was getting up, and insisted on taking the baby for cuddles and feeding him, and she came back around teatime, insisting she had cooked too much again, and asking Sherlock if he would do her a favour and eat the excess.  They both pretended her visits were purely for her own benefit, rather than to give Sherlock time for a shower and a hot meal every day.  Sherlock still felt overwhelmed, caring for their newborn son by himself, but he struggled a little less with Mrs Hudson’s help.
John lay curled up on the bed for a couple of minutes, listening to Sherlock’s moans drifting up through the floor from his room directly underneath John’s own, before deciding he couldn’t stay there, listening to Sherlock’s passionate embracing of his new love life.  He thumped his feet on to the floor, stamping over to the wardrobe where his overnight bag was stored, and threw it down onto the bed, yanking the drawers open and randomly grabbing at clean socks and pants.  He shoved the desk chair out of the way to get at the socket under the desk and unplugged his phone charger, throwing that in on top of the underwear.  He was suddenly aware that the noises from below had stopped, and thought somewhat savagely that it served Sherlock right if his lovemaking was being interrupted.  John grabbed at a couple of pairs of trousers, a few shirts and jumpers and rammed them into the bag as well.
“Being a dog is doing absolutely nothing at all for your intelligence, Sherlock…” John laughed.  Sherlock snorted, and nosed out: FASTER then arranged neatly underneath, I CAN GO BACK TO FULL SENTENCES IF YOU PREFER BUT IT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER.
John’s memories lasted only a little longer; he walked straight into an argument between his mum and his dad, who had come home drunk from the pub again having spent the money John’s mum had given him there, instead of taking it to the supermarket to get the chicken thighs for dinner.  On top of that, John’s older sister Harry had been caught sneaking a bottle of cheap whiskey from the cupboard, so she was in a corner of the room screeching her own two-penny worth into the general din.  John tried to sneak upstairs without being seen so he could change his clothes, and maybe delay the telling off he was sure to get, but unfortunately he was spotted, and the noise ratcheted up another level.  His mum grabbed a wet flannel and scrubbed at all the marks she could see, all the while yelling at John’s dad and Harry, while John winced and tried to make himself as small as possible.  When his mum started yelling about the amount of money it cost to replace John’s clothes, and why couldn’t he go two days without ruining another t-shirt, after she’d just spent all that money on his school uniform, John thought it best not to mention just yet that he was now bonded and wouldn’t be going to school and wearing any of that expensive uniform.  It was a conversation for another, quieter day, he felt.
John stood in the centre of the living room, staring blankly through the kitchen, in the direction of Sherlock’s bedroom.  What had he done?  He knew Sherlock was not very experienced sexually, and he had just snogged the face off the man.  He’d probably frightened the life out of him, and now Sherlock had run for it, escaping to his bedroom – what if he told John to leave?  How could he fix this?
Well, it's been very quiet round here, Sherlock's had no cases - not even a three, so I've not really had anything to blog about.  I was racking my brains trying to see if there were any old cases I hadn't already told you about, and realised I've never blogged about how I actually met Sherlock - so here you go.
Sherlock starts to play with John...
“Alexander Sigerson,” he said, “after both of our fathers.”
his bed while he got up and prepared some food for them.
“John? I didn’t know you were- John, what’s happened, what’s the matter?”  Sherlock’s voice sounded from where he stood naked and hard in the doorway.  He was getting increasingly distressed as his quick eyes took in the sight on the bed before him, and his erection started to wilt.  John snorted and glared at him angrily, then stepped into the en-suite toilet to collect his toiletry bag from the small medicine cabinet.  “John? Talk to me, please! I’m sorry John, whatever I did, I’m sorry!”  John stopped dead, his hands forming into fists, and he slammed one down on the top of the toilet tank, causing it to rattle noisily.  He spun on his heel and stormed out of the tiny room, eyes flashing angrily.
“Then who said anything about flatmates?”  John hoped the face he was showing to the stranger wasn’t as confused looking as it felt to him on the inside.  There was a sudden flurry of activity, the man grabbing a long dark coat and swirling into it, as he spoke again.
“Please, John!”  John finally felt he had calmed enough to know that he wouldn’t embarrass himself, and started to move his hips, gently at first, but quickly getting harder and harder.
Sherlock pulled open the door and stepped up to the desk, the resident dragon was in place behind the appointment book.  “Fetch me a doctor to sign this”, Sherlock said disdainfully to her, slapping the medical form down on the counter in front of her.  “I beg your pardon?!” she spluttered.  “I need this signed, a doctor has to sign it, so fetch me a doctor!  Are you an idiot?”  Sherlock watched as the woman started to fume.  “I’m sorry, “Sir”,” she sneered, “we don’t have any doctors available, you’ll need to make an appointment next week.”
John turned to look at what was happening, and was nearly knocked over by a skinny young man in dirty jeans and a hoodie, running past holding a large brown leather handbag.  John took a moment to assess the situation, then turned and set off in pursuit of the skinny youth.  It only took a few steps before he was within reach, and he rugby tackled the thief to the ground.  The woman came running up behind him, babbling her thanks to John.
“I.. I..” John spluttered.  “I would never have gone home with him, Sherlock, he wasn’t my type!”
I told Sherlock what had happened, and he made a point of asking her if she would make some of her fabulous cheese scones and gingerbread - things warmed up rather rapidly after that, and not just because Mrs H's oven was on!
“Sherlock, what the hell?!” he burst out, turning his head rapidly away from his flatmate’s nudity, and setting off the barbarian with the double handed broadsword once again.  “Get some clothes on, wouldya?”
Xander chose this moment to decide it was time for lunch, so Sherlock quickly prepared his bottle, testing the heat of the milk on the inside of his wrist, and tucked himself into his chair, feeding Xander.  When Greg returned, he sat back down on the sofa and turned to Sherlock.
“Why is he running?!” Greg shouted back as he shot off down the corridor after Sherlock.  Mycroft scrubbed his hands through his hair, wishing he had time to figure it out, but the situation with the Americans needed to be dealt with very delicately now, after he had been forced to cut their meeting short.  He sighed, and went back to the desk in the tiny office the maternity staff had been kind enough to let him use.  He picked up his Montblanc fountain pen, ready to make notes as he made another round of telephone calls while he waited for more news of John.
John dropped to his knees, sliding his hand under Sherlock’s testicles to his arse, and slid his fingers back inside.  At the same time, he began to slide the soft skin on Sherlock’s hard erection, and slid his lips over the shiny purple head.  Sherlock threw his head back, hissing once more.  “Fuck!” he breathed, “I won’t be long!”  John’s response was to roll his tongue around the sensitive bumps on the underside of the glans, and suck him down deeply, right to the back of his throat.  Sherlock’s orgasm hit, almost crushing John’s fingers, buried deep in his arse, and John gobbled the salty ropes down greedily.  For a few moments, both men tried to catch their breath.
He had only had to declare war on the fridge once more since then, and as Sherlock had come rushing into the kitchen just after he had started, the fridge had been reorganized very quickly, with Sherlock even going so far as to clean out the inside with bleach, disinfectant, and hot water.  John only had to rustle a couple of bin bags for Sherlock to come running now.
That picture unlocked the entire case for him - he could tell from the light on the client's face that her dressing table was right by the window, and it was obvious then what had happened.  The night was unseasonably warm, on top of which she'd left the heating cranked up too far before she'd gone out, so she'd left the bedroom window open and the curtains a little ajar to let the breeze into the room.  Turns out there is a tree in her garden with a magpie nest in - the magpie had spotted the twinkling reflection of the diamonds as the breeze had blown the curtain around, hopped in through the open window and pinched the necklace!!  Ten minutes of Sherlock up a tree later, and one valuable diamond necklace was safely returned to a grateful client, along with instructions to either keep the windows closed in future, or to lock up the jewels before bed!
“Please…” Sherlock moaned, eyes squeezed shut and breath coming fast.  John slid his hand round to the front of Sherlock’s trousers and popped the button open.  He slipped his hand just inside Sherlock’s waistband, fingers brushing over Sherlock’s hot skin, making his breath catch.  Sherlock moaned again, thrusting his hips back against John’s groin.  Slowly, John dragged Sherlock’s zip down, spreading the two halves of the fabric, then yanked the trousers down to Sherlock’s knees.  A small bottle fell from Sherlock’s pocket, and John turned his head quickly to see what it was.  He picked up the little bottle, smiling when he saw it was lube.
“I prefer to text,” the man responded.
Sherlock slipped the ends of the scarf around his neck through the loop and pulled it snug, then swung his coat round himself, grabbing his keys and wallet – he didn’t like to spend his own money if he could help it, but if Mycroft wasn’t around, it couldn’t be avoided.   He stepped out of 221b Baker Street and hailed a passing taxi, giving the driver the name of the local surgery.  He had timed his arrival perfectly, there were a few patients still waiting to be seen, but the majority of the waiting room was empty; previous experience told him that Dr Watson was likely to be finished with his list.
The ambulance pulled up outside Speedy’s, and quickly bundled John onto a trolley, loading him onto the waiting vehicle and speeding him away towards the hospital.  It all happened so quickly that he didn’t even have time to protest that he needed to wait for his Alpha, and besides, the contractions were kind of keeping him occupied.  The journey itself was a bit of a blur as John concentrated on trying to remember the advice he had given to so many Omegas over the years – keep breathing, relax, just let your body do what it knows how to do...  He was rushed into the maternity unit, and thought for a moment or two that he could see Mycroft at the desk as they went past – but that was silly, why would Mycroft be there and not Sherlock?  Then the doors to the maternity unit closed behind him, and he was gently being moved onto the bed in a luxurious birthing suite and stripped of the clothing on his bottom half.  After that, was pain, sweat and tears.
Sherlock’s initial reaction was confusion, then curiosity, then fear and frustration.  He had managed for over thirty years to remain removed from the messy world of procreation, and within a few days of meeting his new flatmate, Sherlock was beginning to find his transport was rebelling against him.  He couldn’t explain why he detested allowing John to leave the flat, the mere thought of him out on the streets of London by himself was repellant to Sherlock.  Almost every day now he was waking with a hot and hard erection, willing them away was getting more and more difficult; he had even had to resort to wanking in the shower on a few occasions, after John had left the flat.  He had finally begged Mycroft to find him something to do out of the country so he could get a few days’ relief, and that was when John’s first heat had come on.  Mycroft, of course, had taken advantage of Sherlock’s begging and spun it in such a way that Sherlock now owed him another couple of favours, never mind that he had solved a particularly thorny problem for him.
“This is mine, we work on it when we’ve got nothing else to do.”
“Perhaps you should have gone home to wait,” John suggested with a small smile.  Sherlock at least had the grace to blush a little, but John continued to smile; he didn’t know what Sherlock had spent all afternoon doing, but he hadn’t caused any trouble.  John was secretly pleased that Sherlock had stayed around, he didn’t know how he would have coped being so far from his Alpha for so long this early on in their bond; having Sherlock close had undoubtedly made things easier for John, even if they hadn’t been physically in the same room.  Sherlock moved in to kiss John, his eyes fluttering closed, and John gripped the lapels of his coat in his hands, pulling the taller man towards him and leaning into the kiss.  Sherlock stopped abruptly, and bent forwards, tucking his nose under John’s jaw, inhaling deeply.  John jerked his head back as Sherlock’s hair tickled his nose.
