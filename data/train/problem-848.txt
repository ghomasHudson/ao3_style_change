Molly let out a soft giggle and beamed his way, their feet coming to a stop between a splitting hallway, Molly’s class down an entirely different corridor to his. She placed her soft hands atop his shoulders and grinned at him, all white teeth and pink lips and he was instantly reminded of how lucky he was to have her as his friend.
He was humorous and kind when he said it. Passionate and eager, yet calm and collected. Eyes their usual ocean blue, an oatmeal shaded sweater covering his light, London-tanned skin, and his lips pink and plush, a rosy hue where they caught between his teeth during deep thought.
“How do we go about it then?” John cleared his throat, brows furrowing as he curiously awaited Molly’s answer, simultaneously staring wistfully at the bubbling kettle.
John watched as he winced slightly with the force of his angry movements and swallowed, trying his best not to get too offended by an irritable Sherlock.
“Well, I’m not going if you don’t go,” John stated matter-of-factly, expression pleased, confident and self-assured.
Sherlock smiled a little, for the first time all day, as he listened to the bright sound of John’s laugh, joyous and light – Sherlock loved that laugh, that welcoming giggle that wholly enveloped you, that made you feel safe. It was a home. Sherlock was convinced there was a home in John’s laugh.
The rugby captain laughed softly and nodded, beaming brightly up at the other boy before clearing his throat, and letting out a deep, self-encouraging sigh, “You wanna go celebrate?”
Molly swallowed, staring motionlessly out at the crowd of silent onlookers, all somewhat heartbroken as they watched her utter, softly, "Molly Hooper."
The skinny brunette smiled as he walked, eyeing the ground with sudden interest, cheeks darkening a bit as he explained, “I look at others and deduce them. It’s all in the details, even the smallest of them; simply logical conclusions based on noticeably indicated information.”
John laughed loudly and readjusted his backpack before beginning the small walk to Baker’s main hall, Molly trailing along beside him as he bobbed his head in confirmation, “Of course, I have.”
“I’d be careful, Sally,” Sherlock snapped, glancing briefly over at her to stare her dead in the eyes before turning away as Ms. Montgomery stood from her desk to address the room, “Your jeans are starting to wear at the knees. Can’t have everyone knowing how you spend your afternoon study sessions with Philip Anderson.”
“‘Course, if it was just a one-time thing for you, that’s fine too, yeah? I’m not trying to force anything, but I just wanted you to know you’re, you know, always welcome—”
“So, how do I know when the best time to light a fire is?” The young girl asked, frowning as she watched their mentor slowly chew his food, his eyelids heavy and hair a mess.
Molly smirked and walked over to his desk, grabbing her purse and keys before turning back to him with a grin and waving him her way with a flick of her head, “Come on, lover boy. Let’s go find a charity shop.”
Immediately, the brunette tucked into his pasta dish, rolling up each noodle gently on his fork before lifting it to his lips and into his mouth, quietly going about his eating, and rather adorably as John observed the soft movements and shy chewing. He dug into his own food, reveling in the creamy texture and soft spice of his lasagna, his absolute favorite at ‘
Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. He'd heard of the kid - oh yes, he'd heard of him; he'd heard about how he could make a fool of someone in three seconds, expose their darkest secrets, point out every flaw that ever came to be throughout the whole of their depressingly short life. But seen him? Hardly. The boy was like a ghost - one minute he was floating past you in the hallway and the next he was gone, gone as though he'd simply vanished through one of the corridor walls. This, right here, was a rare moment in John Watson's life.
“Saying Sherlock converted you or some bollocks,” Greg sighed, readjusting the backpack strap hanging low on his shoulder and shifting uncomfortably.
“Seb, you were literally just drawing a blue dick on the whiteboard with an expo marker,” John growled out, “I really don’t think you’re in any position to talk.” John relished in the giggles that resounded from the boys next to him and even allowed himself a small smirk as he watched Sebastian attempt to defend himself, only to fall silent.
John parked his car in its usual spot, wincing a bit as the engine clanged noisily before he turned the key and shut off the vehicle, reaching for his backpack and sliding out of the driver’s seat with a bright smile, slamming the door behind him and locking up. He made his way toward Baker’s front gate, running a palm through his damp hair, glancing down and shaking his head amusedly at his ruffled clothing. He’d been running late this morning, no one to blame but himself, having laid in bed for a good few minutes reading through the many comments gracing his new video, marveling over how many views he’d gotten, his growth in subscribers, and laughing at how much of a catch Sherlock Holmes was — laughing once he’d pushed past the initial wave of jealousy, of course.
Sherlock smirked proudly at the statement and pulled his phone from the table’s surface to tuck it away inside his hoodie’s stretched front pocket.
“Yeah, bit weird, mate,” James scoffed, punching John lightly in the shoulder before leaning back in the plastic blue chair of his desk.
“So, what were you up to?” John asked suddenly, and Sherlock glanced up to see that he had moved on to picking at the small chicken sandwich atop his tray.
“You don’t want cirrhosis, do you?” John added, smirking and finally taking a bite of the banana in his hand.
“Yeah, some fancy bollocks like that. Says his dad has a ton of weird shit from that time he thought aliens existed.”
. That’ll all really help me win.” His words were dripping with sarcasm as he frowned, furious with himself and his abilities.
John Watson and his stupid YouTube videos, his stupid rugby practice and his stupid, rather adorable, love for classical music and Sherlock’s own videos. Stupid. He was an idiot. He was a popular kid, a jock, a people-pleaser, kind on the outside, manipulative on the inside. He was ordinary. Wasn’t he?
But so often he found that people liked that side better; his own self, the one outside of the camera and the music and the videos uploaded to that channel, was a freak, an arrogant arsehole who hid behind harsh words and spitfire comments, a human being that hated being human,
He watched as the ellipsis at the bottom of the screen danced to signify John currently forming a response, the three dots teasing him as they shook in their gray hue.
“What do you say?” John asked, watching as Sherlock’s own eyes, those kaleidoscope eyes, widening and darted from the rugby captain to the dancer floor and back. John saw the fear there, a small, scared look that he read easily as insecurity, and he quickly poked the boy in the ribs.
Sherlock swallowed, glanced to his side, then to the floor, sighed and then shook his head, “Sebastian Wilkes and three others.”
Even though most despised him, District Twelve's civilians seemed to be watching his every move with expressions of grief, sympathy, anguish.
Sherlock arched a brow and quickly got his breathing under control, lifting his eyes to look back at Victor, running a weak hand through his tousled curls, "Well, I don't necessarily care."
Sherlock scoffed and shook his head, “No. Of course not. He made the decision to break up with me rather than force me into anything. Thankfully.”
The curly haired boy lugged his belongings into the studio, glaring forwards while he walked past the dozens of ballerinas eyeing him suspiciously as they left their afternoon class. He rolled his eyes and pushed past them and into the slowly emptying ballet studio, slipping off his tennis shoes - old and tattered blue converse - dropping his duffle bag and beginning to stretch, extending his arms upwards and downwards and spreading his legs in a straddle like position, sitting gracefully onto the wooden floor. He leaned over his thighs, grabbed his toes and pulled them towards himself, huffing out a breath as the movements pulled at his muscles, the sensation both relieving and painful.
— narrowed his eyes and grabbed lightly to Sherlock’s upper arm, holding it softly and preventing his leave, titling his head in confusion as he gazed thoughtfully at Sherlock’s blank expression.
And so it left Sherlock in a state of indecision, pushing open the doors to the studio and glancing at himself in the many mirrors, the urge to write out a small, superfluous message to the rugby team’s captain tickling the ends of his fingers. He slowly placed his hand over his pocket, feeling the rim of his mobile and pondering quietly to himself, chewing on his bottom lip with uncertainty.
And then she sighed too, and they were suddenly both silent as they sat in the homey car, John’s fingers numb with the cold blowing in from the open windows, Harry’s ears slightly pink, matching the tone of her lipstick rather well. He glanced at her, an appreciative smile lining his slowly softening features, as an overwhelming swell of fondness swept through his stomach — he wasn’t sure what he’d do without her most days.
He had listened to it today in French class, and watched it under the discretion of his desk, and fallen utterly, and completely, in love.
John smirked at the lot of them, all entirely harmless, each of them simply gifted with big mouths and an adoration to talk. He glanced over at where Sherlock sat, alone, slouched, looking entirely exhausted — it brought a frown to John’s expression, brows furrowing. The temptation to get up and sit next to the boy was almost overwhelming — hell, Sherlock was alone and he wasn’t even new.
“I’m worried about you,” Ms. Hudson tutted for what had to have been the hundredth time, whilst she placed a steaming hot cup of tea on the coffee table beside Sherlock’s ramrod straight form.
“No bloody way,” Sholto wheezed, face crinkling with amusement as he stared up at Wilkes, expression almost awed by his presence, “I’ve been trying to convince her since the start of the semester.”
. She’ll be back in a bit to make dinner,” Harry answered, strolling towards the small kitchen with a bit of a bounce in her step.
With a roll of his eyes, Sherlock sneered playfully at John before looking away to avoid blushing yet again, much to his own distasteful embarrassment. He grabbed for his cup and took a cooler sip, reveling in the sharp bitterness coffee had to offer and the tangy sweetness of those two invaluable spoons of sugar.
And in an instant, he dropped from his tiptoes and collapsed to the ground, spinning across the studio floor, chest heaving, body whirling, movements graceful and poised for both beauty and emphasis.
,” Haymitch spoke up from behind him, and Sherlock turned, catching the hint of a smirk on his lips, delighted by Molly’s actions, it seemed, “That’s how you do it.” The blonde man stood and pushed in his chair, yanking out his flask and downing several large gulps of whiskey. He then strode passed Sherlock, aiming to leave the train car, but not before slamming a hand down on Sherlock’s shoulder, a grin marring his features gleefully. “
“How will people contact you with a case then?” She asked, hope titling her question’s tone as she watched him stick a fork into the cold dish of noodles.
“But they’ll be dry,” John added, reaching down into his dresser and grabbing out a black and grey tee, along with a pair of what looked like navy jeans. He turned back around to face Sherlock and handed them over with his ever-present warm smile, his eyes alight with friendliness, his expression careful and sincere.
James shook his head, his brows lifting nearly to his hair line as he let out a long, exasperated breath, “Christ. Bloody Americans.”
“I’m glad your knowledge of the English language extends so very far,” Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes to himself, if only to settle the blooming panic rising in his gut, his head pounding, his heart clenching, his body trembling internally at the very thought that his most daunting of secrets, most important, had just been thoroughly and royally revealed because of his own daft ways.
His sister gazed at him with wide eyes, brows at her hairline, and let out a sharp, rather bemused giggle, the sound emanating both shock and disbelief, “Christ, John, are you in
He watched as Sherlock ducked his head to look at the place through the front window, the smile still there, clad in glossy black lipstick, those ethereal eyes bright and almost white, circled in the dark of his eye makeup — the boy looked absolutely breathtaking and John had a feeling he’d be staring far too much tonight.
John scoffed and sighed softly, glancing over at her before staring back down at his hands, dropping them lifelessly into his lap as he cleared his throat.
Sherlock held back a groan, throwing his head forwards and pressing his palms against the sink, hair hanging down across his forehead as he shut his eyes and softly mumbled back a response, heaving out a weak, “What?”
They would see, he would make them see, what a thoroughly equipped mind, and a simple alteration to song, could do.
Afterward, once all had been said and done, it started to rain. Umbrellas scattered about the cemetery as each guest made their way towards their vehicles, taxis, methods of transportation. He felt Lestrade pat him on the damp form of his suit clad back, felt Ms. Hudson squeeze his hand as she slowly sauntered off, felt Molly lightly kiss his cheek, until he was left alone, standing there, glaring at the golden letters engraved into that simple slab of stone.
So, I’ve got a certain hashtag practically overtaking my Twitter notifications at the moment. Anyone care to explain what #beeface means?
"What do you mean?" That deep baritone asked and John instantly shrugged once more, feeling far more nervous now than before.
?” John gaped, laughing incredulously as they approached his locker, “How the hell do you cheat at Knots and bloody Crosses?”
“I feel like a bloody waitress,” Harry spat out, rolling her eyes good-naturedly as she turned to face the two of them.
He took the corner, heading towards the student parking lot and in the direction of his parked car, the silver Toyota awaiting him almost expectantly, when his phone buzzed obnoxiously in his back pocket. He reached back and slipped it out, reading the message portrayed across its screen.
John hummed and bobbed his head in understanding, his brows furrowing as he thought about it; it made sense, why people wouldn't particularly like that, but it merely made John all the more excited - Sherlock Holmes was a wonder, a puzzle he wished to solve.
But, as bewilderingly new as it was, it was also oddly coincidental. He couldn't shake the small clue, the small suspicion, that had wormed its way into the back of his mind, that somehow, in some way, the anonymous dancer had been there, on that very day John had leaned over and played his music for his friends.
, giving himself a pat on the back for his efforts, for each big gain he made in terms of subscribers, and treating himself to an extra cigarette every day that week, just because.
— smiled, and Sherlock glanced at the outstretched hand, the other expertly balancing the full, heavy box as he awaited Sherlock’s acceptance of the gesture and his own introduction.
And that revelation utterly enveloped his every little thought as he stared forwards, the very same boy gripping tight to a small, bathroom towel and shuffling it against his hair, chocolate curls falling this way and that, tumbling against his forehead, lying still damp against his ear, the gel from his “
John scoffed in agreement and then turned to her, expression pained, pursing his lips in concern as he met her eyes, pondering the way the ballet dancer had moved, had spun, had swayed and turned and whirled — he had seemed so utterly defeated, desperate, in a way John hadn’t seen before, not in any of his other videos.
He watched as Sherlock’s eyes flickered in their multicolored shade, blinking repeatedly before dropping to the ground, shyly, timidly, which only caused John’s smile to spread wider across the entirety of his warm expression.
His mates cheered and hollered piercingly loud and John cringed slightly where he stood, keeping his eyes down in an attempt to shy away any evidence of obvious irritation.
“When you rudely bashed through the front door? Yes,” Sherlock spat, and though he went for a strong, forceful tone, trying to appear bold, unbothered, his voice only shook, weak and hoarse with worry and fear of what his future held now.
“I swear, Sherlock,” She prattled on, shaking her head and sounding far more resigned now as she placed the dishes back in their rightful cupboards, slamming them shut and moving closer to where he sat once more, “that big, old brain of yours would work
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” John chuckled, shaking his head yet again and shrugging his shoulders lightly, as though his body were acting out of his control. “I can’t help it; I’m still processing.”
Mike Stamford shook his head at their conversation, leaning across the table and scoffing loudly, “What’d you do, Seb? Sway her with your good looks and charms?"
“The kind of music he plays on that ancient violin is the kind of music my granddad puts on for his afternoon naps,” Sholto scoffed, shrugging his shoulders and leaning back in his seat, “Boring.”
“Don’t be stupid, Holmes,” The boy snarled back, horrifically amused features dropping into a look of deeper rage, a look that spoke volumes, a look that said, ‘
He could hear the dinging of silverware and plates just outside his door; he could hear the faint mumbles of a consistent conversation, and the distinct sound of Molly’s mousy voice. They would be expecting him. He couldn’t run off into the woods with his dog and his arrows.
“I have a long walk,” Sherlock forced out, swallowing thickly and glancing around the deserted library, berating himself for the poor excuse.
“So,” Molly said with a grin as John slammed the door of his prehistoric car Thursday morning, slipping his cellphone into his pocket upon her arrival before him and arching a brow her way, suspicious of her short greeting and lack of ‘hello’.
Upon exiting the train and stepping into the light of the Capitol’s sun, Sherlock and Molly had been pounded by excited citizens and their generous words. Their shouts and hollering so loud that Sherlock had been tempted to throw his palms over his ears and growl at their stupidity. And yet, at the same time, though he had been disgusted earlier, he was now fascinated. Because he was hearing things – words – fall from their mouths that he had never heard before; words of praise, words wishing good fortune and admitting bewilderment. Words cheering not only for Molly, but also for him.
He shook his head and swallowed, reaching the rugby field and slowly stalking over to the benches, seemingly the first one out of the locker room in his hurry to flee from Wilkes. He sighed and sat down, putting down his things and looking up to spot Greg swaying over to him, one hand holding tightly to his water bottle, and the other twisting through his short, silver hair, dyed purposely that way a while back, its brown roots seeping through just a bit.
John blanched, a glare immediately taking the place of that warm smile, fierce and dark, a warning of some sort tweaking his earlier sincerity. Before he could bite out any such thing, however, Harriet Watson stepped forwards and held out a hand, beaming brightly at Sherlock, of whom stood, confused and incredibly nervous — what did Harry know? What had John told her? Perhaps she’d been informed of how very damaged and pitiful Sherlock Holmes, the lonely chemistry-loving nut, truly was — but no, John surely didn’t see him as such. Did he?
When she caught her breath, running a finger behind her ear to tuck away loose strands, she faced John, biting her lip and shrugging, "So?"
"Slow," John warned. From the look on Sherlock's face, he might not even be hearing John any more. John remembered liking it hard and fast, once upon a time, but realistically, after this much time gone by ... he braced his hands and thighs to be ready to control the speed of Sherlock's hips by force, if necessary.
And he wanted to tell him so, storm out of the cafe without so much of an explanation, stand where he sat and yell how about how much of an idiot John was for thinking him friend material, shout and kick and shriek about how, in the end, John would leave — just like everyone else did. Just like his mother did when he was born, just like his father did when that Lorry came out of nowhere, just like Mycroft did when he found there was nothing worth staying in London for anymore.
“I’m only going if you’re going, John,” Molly stated, eyes focused on the screen of her phone now resting in her hands of which sat atop the table, thumb lazily moving across the screen as she scrolled through what looked like Tumblr, aesthetic paintings and photographs of flowers filling the screen.
“No, no, I’m bloody serious,” She snapped, and he instantly turned back to face her again, taking in the solidarity of her expression, her lips drawn in a thin, hard line, her eyes flashing some sort of warning his way as he blinked blankly and listened whilst she continued, “because whoever this person is, they sound pretty damn important.”
Sherlock arched a brow, keeping the throbbing pain of the bully’s words below the surface, and standing up just a bit taller, shoulders burning from where the metallic form of the lockers had dug just a bit too deep.
“Good,” John snorted before Sherlock heard him sigh and then felt as a weight dropped down at his side, their shoulders pressed together, hands crossed over their torsos as they both stared upward at the ceiling.
Harriet giggled to herself, high-pitched squeaks that always reminded John of a dog's toy, and closed the door behind her, but not before yelling teasingly out, loud and clear, "Behave yourselves!"
He froze, swallowed his next word, that name on his lips, and watched as Molly’s somewhat frightened expression broke into one of utter heartache, piteous and sympathetic, eyes running over the curves of his face, the broken form of his steadily deteriorating health, the exhaustion, hunger, and lack of proper hydration apparent, the state of his thoughts showing through on top of it all.
“Thank you,” Sherlock cleared his throat and dropped his eyes down to the closed notebook in his pale, slender fingers.
He watched John swallow, blink, and slowly drop his hand, gently placing it down once more and turning away, laughing softly and shaking his head. “Amazing,” he breathed lightly and poked at his untouched lunch tray.
Sherlock glanced back at the rugby captain then, eyes innocently wide, mouth hovering open just enough to decide which response he was going to attempt to make.
The corner of John’s lips quirked up before he turned to Sherlock, sending the brunette’s heart racing, leg beginning to shake anxiously beneath the lunch table, his eyes transfixed by the bright light of the boy’s smile, the shimmer of those rippling oceans.
I've just been ridiculously busy and have some family drama going on, as well as a bad typing hand; so I'm a bit slow with updating but I'm still here, and hopefully you are too?
Sherlock felt a twinge of envy at the way she was looking John up and down with turquoise eyes, so much so that he allowed it to encompass the whole of his previous urge, jealousy replacing lust, in such a way that he found himself thankful — had he
And, still, there he stood, a low, hollow sensation in his gut pleading with him that, one day, John would love him back — cowardice and all.
“It’s not something I like, you know,” John laughed softly, and somewhat shyly, “everyone’s eyes on me, everyone listening. But making videos is something else entirely. It’s like being on that stage with no one in the seats watching you.”
“Mum in?” John turned back to his sister, expression taking on a more casual appearance, lips just slightly curved, brows lifted with his questioning tone.
"Oh, no. Sorry," She stammered, shaking her head, ponytail flinging in every direction, "I didn't mean
“Hello, Holmes,” A voice whispered softly into his ear, and he quickly whirled around, coming face to face with the tall, strong-built form of Sebastian Wilkes, towering over him with dark eyes and dark hair, hungry like the wolf, a snarl on his threatening expression.
John wasn’t frowned upon because he preferred apples over strawberries. So why did it matter if Sherlock preferred boys over girls?
He lifted his eyes, and was instantly glad he did, the sight of Sherlock quirking that small, timid, uncertain smile worth so many precious things all in one — John would be content to see that smile for the rest of his days if he’d been given the option to.
“Bloody right it is,” John inhaled sharply and chewed on the side of his cheek, running a hand through his hair as he searched through the inner contents of their mostly empty fridge, “He’s been right under our nose this whole time.”
And so, when his mother and father threw a small, get-together, those cousins attending once again, with Mycroft’s favorite kind of cake and a bit of weak wine, Sherlock lost it — lost the entirety of his composure, his emotions overflowing, his anger swelling, his bitter, sour expression bursting into one of outrage. It wasn’t fair and he intended to make them know it. He’d thrown cake, he’d deduced his distant relatives to tears, he’d thrown a tantrum when his dad attempted to drag him away to his room, he’d punched a hole into his wall and dealt with a bruised, and scraped, fist the week after.
With a wholeheartedly more pleasant set of features, Sherlock went back to watching the agile boy on the field, observing the way he called out to his team mates, the way he occasionally glanced back at the crowd as though in need of proper motivation, the way he bounced in place when he wasn’t in battle, the way, much to Sherlock’s heated cheeks, his shorts hiked up just a bit too far with each long stride forwards. Swallowing thickly, he gazed outwards, watching how that dirty blonde hair shimmered when graced by any single ray of sunlight, admiring those ocean blue eyes, so blue, so
Sherlock jolted as the bell’s piercing trill rang out around him, the students of whom had stopped to stand witness to their conflict now turning away and jogging off to their respective classes, leaving Sherlock trapped in the middle of the empty corridor, Wilkes’ fist beneath his chin and his heart faltering with what a silent hall now meant for his well-being.
It was silent as Sherlock turned away again, expression giving nothing away, body rigid and guarded, upright and yet hunched slightly, as though he were hiding in himself, hiding whatever it was that was currently, and most often, making him so very lonely, so very sad.
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped, and pulled his arm from John’s grip. He then glanced at the boy, watching as his eyes dropped to his slightly swollen bottom lip, his face creasing with a hint of worry before it softened yet again and fixed itself on Sherlock’s tense features, the way he was stood, angled away, guarded and closed-off.
Sherlock hummed to himself before frowning and clearing his throat, “And before you frown upon it, blame John. He texted me first.”
“Come on,” John whined, lips forming an utterly ridiculous — and, frankly, adorable — pout, as he leaned against the back of his desk chair, “I’ve had Molly in a couple. Hell, even
He watched as Sherlock let out a soft huff of amused air, his eyes brightening just slightly, his expression softening and his lips, pink and sculpted to perfection, lifting. John took pride in making the boy laugh; his skinny figure, those ethereal features, rising to display merely the smallest look of emotional bliss, but a look of emotional bliss all the same.
“I’ll take care of him, John,” The woman assured, lifting the rim of her drink to her mouth and sipping, all while leaving her eyes fixed on the rugby captain’s own bewildered expression.
“I’m calling it, mate,” John stated and turned to move towards his date, an even warmer smile blooming across his expression at the sight of him.
Sherlock snorted softly to himself and shook his head, smiling at the video thumbnail of a warm, tan face sticking his tongue out in utter exhaustion, mathematical symbols of all shapes and sizes surrounding him.
“Hey, I get it,” John smiled tenderly, his hand moving to rub circles into the small of Sherlock’s back, “My dad’s a wanker when he’s drunk.”
On top of this, things are not very comfortable at home and I haven't had much time to write with finals topping everything else off.
"What if, one day," Molly began, smiling as she gazed blankly up into the sky, "they all stopped watching?"
Molly blinked, swallowed, glanced at Sherlock, turned back to Haymitch, and then shrugged, “But you’re our mentor, aren’t you supposed to teach us, about sponsors, and strategies and the like?”
With a smile, John nodded and turned toward his computer screen, clicking with his mouse and tapping keys on his keyboard, concentrated and thoughtfully as he clipped the video footage and dropped in a musical track of some sort. It entranced Sherlock, how much John seemed to enjoy doing so — Sherlock often loathed editing his ballet routines, whether it was seeing himself on the screen or the act of damaging his self-pride through blurring the lines of his face. He didn’t even listen to his compositions before he uploaded them, instead doing his anonymous editing whilst the volume was muted.
He’d completely lost the plot — and his parents had decided against parties and banquets for the rest of the year, and Mycroft had despised him for it. It eventually passed however and Sherlock had come to the decision he never wanted to celebrate anything again — he told his parents they could take his silly excuse for a birthday party and put it out with the morning’s rubbish. He wanted no part in any more celebratory affairs.
Sherlock glanced upward, stopping his eating to instead stare intently at his mentor, watching him for any sign of a lie, because if what he was saying was true, Sherlock had no chance at all.
“What’s your favorite color?” John asked, voice tinged with intrigue, expression open and sincere, practically childish when matched up to the depth of his question.
"I'm fine," he mumbled, readjusting his bag straps before stepped forwards and around John, only to feel a hand grip his shoulder, sending him into a nearly violent flinch, his entire body tensing for what his mind shouted as,
John smiled and slowly, ever so gently, pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s as they swayed, and though he felt Sherlock flinch at the touch, the boy didn’t pull away, instead relaxing into John’s embrace, slowly but surely.
He met the rugby captain’s eyes and was surprised to find a somewhat sad look there, John’s expression soft and glum, features narrowed and brows furrowed, lips pursed and shoulders hunched forward, the entirety of his figure attentive and serious, as though the words Sherlock was saying were nothing short of
Sherlock scoffed and dropped his eyes to the table, swallowing thickly and shrugging, “Not much to tell, really. My parents were rather posh. If we went anywhere, it was to big gatherings at art museums or business meetings at my father’s place of work.”
The first thing the man did was approach the decanter, fill his empty class, and then take a rather large sip, as though he’d been desperate to quench his thirst. The second thing he did was turn to face the two of them, his tributes, his students, the two teenagers he would have to teach his ways and then watch helplessly as they died on the battlefield. Sherlock couldn’t even imagine how they looked – surely, not promising at all. He was slouched downwards in the soft cushion of one of the train’s sofa chairs, his white button-up shirt now wrinkled, his black slacks covering the whole of his long legs, of which were spread out in front of him. His fancy dress shoes were getting to be rather uncomfortable, and his curls had fallen from their perfectly smooth-backed form, falling atop his forehead rather messily. He looked unforgivable; he wasn’t sure what Haymitch – their mentor – could possibly think of him. Molly didn’t really look like a victor, but at least she was sitting upwards, a bright smile on her face, posture ramrod straight.
“I don't know,” he whispered, looking down at the water surrounding him, breath finally evening out as he stared at the bottom of the off-white tub, at his pruned fingers, at his practically concaving stomach. But didn’t he? Didn’t he know why? He hadn’t wanted to continue; he hadn’t wanted to wake up without Him there, to yell about the eyeballs in the microwave or the fingers in the fridge, to remind him to take care of himself, to eat and catch a few hours of shuteye, or remember to hydrate after a taxing case. He didn’t want a life without precisely that — so why not leave it?
John gawked a bit at him, his head whirling from watching the road to watching Sherlock, eyes narrowed as he frowned in confusion, before all his features simultaneously softened, a warm smile saving the harsh concern sprawled across his expression, “Because I care about you, Sherlock Holmes.”
say,” Sherlock murmured under his breath, rolling those indescribable eyes as he glared out the car window, curls flopping lazily and messily against his forehead.
, he didn’t want to be left alone but John’s friends were here and this was a party and he was quite sure parties were meant to be enjoyed, meant to involve having fun and playing games and smiling, laughing amongst people you click with, rebelling in silly ways and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. But John was standing here, beside him, looking shy and conflicted, with a drink in his hand that he hadn’t yet sipped. Sherlock simply couldn’t allow that. He wouldn’t take away John’s fun, he wouldn’t tie him down.
“Oh, right,” Greg hummed, pointing at James Sholto thoughtfully, “He said you got rejected by Ezliabeth Cooper, didn’t he?”
“Please,” Sherlock shook with the cold and the tightness of the firm grip on his arm, holding him in place, an escape this time utterly impossible though he still attempted to struggle out of the boy’s grip. He was sure that John was going to hit him, shove him to the ground, tell him
He started up the car and, in an attempt to lighten the mood of the situation, even just slightly, John let out a sharp chuckle, regaining Sherlock’s attention and shrugging his shoulder amusedly, “Future doctor, yeah? Can’t help it.”
They both entered with sighs of relief at the warmth that enveloped them, a small fireplace crackling in the corner of the diner, before John turned to the hostess and grinned, greeting her with a kind ‘hello’ and lifting up two fingers, to which she beamed and grabbed two menus, guiding them over to a small table alone and secluded from the mere few people that were currently going about their meals. She left the menu cards with them and asked for their drinks — a water for the both of them — before disappearing behind the bar only a few feet away.
“That’s no way to treat a lady, you wankers,” Mike snapped, rolling his eyes and lifting his own drink to his lips only to lower it soon after and frown at its empty contents.
The night of the rugby match had John’s stomach fluttering, the butterflies inside present for all the wrong reasons, wings flapping against his insides, buzzing in his gut, throwing his every movement out of proper control. Because he wasn’t nervous about the game — hell, he’d played enough to last him a lifetime. No — he was nervous because Sherlock would be watching. How that made any sense, he didn’t know. Molly came to watch him nearly every game and he had never been close to vomiting over knowing her eyes would be on him.
John grinned as they approached and instantly wrapped Molly up in a gentle, tight hug, eyes shining with admiration for his friend, heart floating with mirth at the sight of her, all giggly and bright and warm.
, shut up,” John moaned in utter humiliation, heart thumping rapidly in his chest as though he’d suddenly uttered his deepest and darkest secret, when in reality he hadn’t said a word.
“Oh,” Sherlock mumbled, and self-consciously lifted a hand to tame the top of his ruffled curls, “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock swallowed and without so much of a thought in advance — his idiotic, impulsive, pathetic self — nodded his head. But he had made John smile again — and
And then the tributes of District Twelve were pulling into a station, the train’s wheels barely squealing as the machine slowed oh-so-carefully, zooming leisurely by crowds of multicolored heads, citizens of the Capitol cheering for them, smiling and grinning and calling out in glee. It disgusted Sherlock so very much his blood ran cold. They holler and congratulate now, and yet, when he dies in a few days, they will not be half as enthusiastic.
worried?” Greg pleaded, his brows drawing down in concern, his shoulders hunching, limbs hanging lifelessly.
John swallowed and looked down, his heart clenching, both with how much Sherlock had been willing to share with him and the idea that the dancer had bared witness to any account of vile intoxication — he wasn’t sure the extent of ‘
"You know," She shrugged, turning to look back at him, frowning at his confused expression, "what if all the districts just decide to stop watching? If no one watches, they don't have a game, right?"
Sherlock grinned and leaned back in the booth they were tucked in, cozy and comfortable — John was completely content, sat there with Sherlock, talking to the boy like they’d known one another for years, decades even. He couldn’t imagine ever living without this, and he was determined to never have to. Before John could open his mouth to ask Sherlock another question about his art gallery escapades, he heard the chime of his friend’s phone from his black skinny jeans’ pocket. The boy frowned and reached down, obviously glancing at the text beneath the table, before sitting up straighter and rolling his eyes.
When John pulled the old Toyota into school Friday morning, he could already spot Molly Hooper sprinting across the student parking lot and over to where John was gingerly aligning his car between the two, parallel lines. He watched as she waited, bouncing on the balls of her feet, hands grasping the straps of her spotty pink backpack so hard her knuckles were beginning to turn white.
With a small smile, he gave the dog a gentle kiss on the nose, chuckling in spite of himself, "Lucky mutt."
"A reminder that you are human," Mycroft leaned back and dropped his arm, glancing away from Sherlock's confused expression, and turning instead to glare at the boys and girls crowding together before the Hall of Justice, "And so are they."
It wasn’t until lunchtime that Sherlock finally got his daily dose of John Watson, the blue of those eyes, the golden shimmer of that hair, the rippling of muscles that lay hidden beneath the swell of a fluffy oatmeal jumper. Sherlock had gathered his things and plummeted down in his usual corner table, alone and secluded from the rest of the student population, his body hunched over, shoulders drawn forwards as he scrolled lazily through his newest comments, berating himself for the lack of new uploads. It was when he had finally lifted his head from the bright light of his mobile screen that he noticed the rugby captain approaching, all smiles and warmth and gentle movements. He swallowed thickly and watched as the blonde did as he had before, placing his tray down with a smack and sitting effortlessly across from Sherlock Holmes, as though no one was watching him, as though the entirety of his circle of friends weren’t glaring, as though the girls who fancied him weren’t glancing over enviously.
Mycroft lifted his head and sighed, “Humans are no different from animals. If you can shoot a rabbit, surely you can shoot a tribute.”
“Just ask him out already,” John scoffed, quirking a short smirk before tossing his own bag beside the team’s bench.
John nodded softly, gently, not wishing to scare the boy into another mask, “Were you happy with,” John paused, and cleared his throat, “with him?”
John watched, amused, as Sherlock slid into the passenger seat, his curls seeming somewhat in disarray, the tall, skinny boy dressed in a baggy, black jumper — obviously in an effort to keep warm against the cool winds of London’s current weather — and thin, skin tight jeans in a dark, faded grey. He looked —
With a fond glance in his direction, John turned to beam brightly at the camera lens, his expression lighting up with such intense joy Sherlock couldn’t help but stare, bewildered by those lifted lips, those shining blue eyes — the crinkles beside them a telling sign that John was genuinely
It wasn't the first time he'd gone through a tearful farewell with the setter. He did it just before every reaping. Because he never knew which one would be his last. Sighing, Sherlock shut his eyes for a moment, swallowed stiffly, and turned away from his best friend, dashing past his family members and back down the hall towards the exit.
He accepted the outstretched hand with a small, polite smile, nodding his head at her and clearing his throat, “You as well.” Once he dropped her palm, he glanced at John and found the boy positively glowing with joy as he stared right back, a look of pride — or was that adoration? — on his face, causing Sherlock’s cheeks to fall warm once more, and his head to duck down shyly, finding far too many eyes on him at the given moment.
?” John whispered into the quiet bathroom, his voice low as he stared down at the boy before him, his eyes still shut, his brows drawn together in a frown of concentration which John found entirely endearing. He meant the question wholeheartedly — it wasn’t to be romantic or charming or seductive: he truly meant it. How was one person so many different things that added up to the literal definition of perfection? Sherlock Holmes was everything John could positively want in a human being and it was a bewildering thing, to be standing there, and staring, even touching, a person so simply serene in John’s eyes.
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock groaned in that same low baritone John was so unhealthily obsessed with, “How could I forget,
And that was the honest truth. Sherlock Holmes knew he would never fall in love. He knew he would be a terrible father. He also knew that he surely wouldn't voluntarily put himself into a situation of which held, and relied on, so much…emotion.
He looked at his bare walls and imagined John playfully teasing him for the simplicity of his entire room; he looked at his small, black chair and wanted John to be sitting in it, saw his
Once they stepped off the last of the stairs, Sherlock took in the room and its many sights. A cheesy, cheap string of shiny silver paper decor was hung from the ceiling, shimmering and sparkling in the bright lights shining across what seemed to be a makeshift dance floor, bodies twirling and bumping into one another where the music boomed and their feet flew. There was a counter and a small mini fridge that held a collection of canned beers, red paper cups, a bucket of ice, bowls of chips and finger-foods along with silly party hats and beaded necklaces in all shades. Green alien cut-outs were taped to the walls, and a strange disco-like ball sat in the corner of the room, illuminating the walls with white circular lights, bright and spherical like the night sky’s stars. The crowds of people were dressed in all sorts of costumes — Sherlock saw a girl painted pink, with odd squiggled makeup drawn across her cheeks and arms, another with a strange alien mask, another with a blue haired wig and shiny spandex clothing. All in all, it truly seemed to be a rather successfully put together party, the small basement holding close to fifty people, most dancing and others sat around on the smattering of sofas and larger couches. Sherlock had never seen anything like it, everyone so happy and smiling, laughing and giggling, making out with their significant others and dancing with their friends, tossing back beers, throwing ping pong balls into red plastic cups, cheering and clapping and hollering. It was insanity and yet it was a kind of insanity Sherlock had never before experienced.
Next day John could hardly remember what was supposed to be the issue. He'd turned off his phone while he was working his shift at clinic, and Sherlock had got shirty about it, and aliens had demanded that they have sex, and something animal or otherwise had pissed on their front steps, but Mrs. Hudson had come out and dumped a bucket of water on it, so a reasonably good day all in all, in spite of everything. Whatever it was, it couldn't be too important.
, Seb,” One of the boys further back leered, hitting Wilkes across the shoulder and snickering under his breath, an amused expression gracing the features of everyone except for Sebastian. The man in discussion snarled and shoved his friend backwards before reaching forward and grabbing Sherlock by the front of his jumper, his roar sending Sherlock into panic mode, though his face remained completely, and utterly still.
Stupid body, stupid survival instincts, stupid oxygen, stupid breathing. It was all stupid, all of it.
The dancer’s around them slowed as the music began to fade out, each note growing fainter and fainter, and John reluctantly pulled back a slight bit to better face the boy before him, Sherlock’s own expression aware of the song’s end, and John swore he saw a quick twitch of disappointment flash in those sculpted features.
“Hello, git,” Harriet smirked and sauntered closer, punching John lightly in the shoulder whilst her eyes remained on Sherlock, judging and careful, dropping from the curls atop his head to the ends of his old, tattered Converse — and Sherlock would be lying if he said he didn’t feel the least bit intimidated; hell, he couldn’t imagine what she must think of him: his eyes smattered in a yellowing bruise, his lip split at one end, his complexion pale, his hair ruffled beyond saving.
They cleaned their plates, Mrs. Watson offered seconds to which everyone but Harry refused, and soon John was nudging Sherlock with his foot beneath the table, head flicking in a gesture towards the hall whilst he smiled that warm smile, a tell tale sign that they were allowed to go on their way. Sherlock made a point to thank John’s mother before he followed John back to his bedroom, feeling warmed by the wholesome aftereffect of a proper dinner, of a proper sitting-down with a proper family — it was an entirely new sensation, this, and one he never thought he’d actually prefer to hiding within the confines of his bedroom with a cup of tea and an old granola bar. Even before the accident, his father hadn’t ever wanted anything like what he’d just experienced. He’d hire a cook, sit beside the fireplace with a book too thick for one evening’s sitting, drink his favorite liquor, and announce that Sherlock and Mycroft help themselves to supper — Sherlock had always found himself sneaking downstairs at three in the morning and snacking on leftovers, too busy to eat at the right time, or simply unbothered.
“I take it it went well then?” She questioned, her back turned to John and her chestnut hair done up in a tight bun. John could practically hear the smirk in her voice. He lifted his head from staring at the lessening contents of his mug, and gazed gently at her.
They would see, he would make them see, what a thoroughly equipped mind, and a simple alteration to song, could do.
John smiled and nodded his head, understanding why it might be, before glancing back down at the ground and scoffing thoughtfully - pleased to steadily be learning more and more about the mysterious boy.
“Chemical reactions, cause and effect; that sort,” He muttered, pushing back a stray curl from where it sat atop his pale forehead.
Their eyes met and within an instant John was retracting his hand, holding it to his heart and looking incredibly regretful, frowning in shame and unspoken apology. Sherlock inhaled sharply and swallowed the fear that had slowly risen from the bottom of his gut, pulse racing, mind whirling in confusion.
And with that, John reached for the handle and poked his head around the narrow slot, his hand extending, mobile tucked beneath his fingers and against his palm. He had every intention of dropping the cellphone on the edge of the sink, but his eyes caught sight of something stark black, sharp and startlingly contrast against milk-bottle white skin. He heard Sherlock’s quiet protests far too late and as soon as his eyes took in the sight of Sherlock’s long, pale spine, he set his sights on the curving detail of a tattoo.
“What the hell am I gonna wear as a costume?” He scoffed, staring at his wardrobe and reaching forwards to shuffle through the many hanging garments, desperately searching for anything remotely spaced themed.
Sherlock’s heart swelled at the words and he found himself turning to face the boy, gazing wishfully into the blue pools of his oceanic eyes, his line of sight dropping down briefly to John’s lips, before he caught himself and turned away, nodding his head both slowly and gratefully, hoping the boy hadn’t noticed his fumbling slip-up and speedy recovery. But as he glanced at John in the corner of his eye, he could see the boy frowning, as though terribly concentrated on Sherlock’s profile, as though he was running something over in his head, processing, coming to some sort of conclusion on how to take action, on how to react. And when Sherlock turned back to John, the boy was staring back — at his lips. Sherlock’s mind imploded, and his heart froze, and all of a sudden the urge to lean in was overwhelming, consuming him, pulling him in to the hazy look in those two dreadfully tempting oceans, beckoning him forwards —
does some sort of meet up or something one day, like shit dude I’m in the UK and need to meet this human being.
John threw back his head in laughter, tears at the corners of his navy eyes as the boy’s around him cried out in amusement and glee, each of them riddled with giggles, cards long forgotten, food only half-touched.
"You ready?" Molly asked, her voice hushed as though she were attempting to whisper, but remained unsure of herself.
“And then eat his face,” Irene added before taking another sip of whatever alcoholic, colorful drink she was drinking.
Sherlock clenched his jaw. He thought about his father, always emotionless and blank, in a consistent state of uncaring callousness, not a quirk in his features nor a twitch that indicated anything other than pure numbness — something he carried with him to the grave, body in the casket slack and far too eerily similar to when he had been breathing. He thought about Mycroft, bloody Mycroft, with his nose in the air, his ginger-brown hair slicked back, his umbrella gripped tight in one hand, glaring at Sherlock, frowning at Sherlock, shaking his head at Sherlock — disappointment, disdain, regret,
, but because he was entirely in love with John Watson and the amount of shared touch they were currently involved in was beginning to drive him insane; God help him.
John smiled wearily and nodded, his heart clenching in both anxiousness for that day and excitement.
“But really,” He took a deep breath and watched Sherlock cautiously, as though he were a frightened cat John had to approach with utter care and soft words.
“You’re different,” John Watson admitted, that familiar, warm smile back on his face again, comforting and gentle, shivers shooting rapidly up Sherlock’s spine at the sight, twisting his gut with need, with desire.
,” Sherlock allowed himself a soft chuckle, shaking his head in admiration, watching as the blonde boy before him pressed on.
Smirking, he leaned down to put his notebook away, only to hear his phone buzz against the lunch table. He zipped up his bag and stood, glancing down at the screen once more and narrowing his eyes.
Carefully and gently, John placed his hand on Sherlock’s warm shoulder, softly shaking him back and forth and waiting until the ethereal color of those eyes slowly shimmered up at him, eyelids having fluttered open and brows drawing inwards with confusion.
He lifted his eyes once more to the blonde, admiring the way he laughed, white teeth revealed as he continued to be undefeated, smirking and seemingly saying something witty as Sholto downed a cup of ale and Moran giggled wildly. He was beautiful, always so
Sherlock gazed curiously at the small apartment building as John drove into a rather wide parking lot, the tall structure complete with dozens of arbitrary windows and mediocre balconies, the walls of the place creamy in color and a bit grungy with obvious aging. He couldn’t help a smile from spreading across his features at the look of the thing, inexpensive, yes, and not too appealing to the eye, but Sherlock already felt more at home here, knowing John resided somewhere behind those walls, than he ever had in his own house, large and overbearing, lonely and, for him, unsafe.
The two of them laughed softly, ducking their heads as their cheeks reddened with mirth, the bliss of merely spending a few minutes of their time with each other brightening their features and tugging at the corners of their lips. When they finally reached the counter, John turned to the now silent brunette beside him and shot the boy a warm look, eyes soft and beam gentle.
Moran snorted while Sholto nodded in amusement and lifted a finger to point at John’s costume, nodding his head in approval, “You certainly took the cliche route.”
On a normal day, Sherlock Holmes would roll his eyes when he saw her rosy cheeks, her, practically, glowing hazel eyes, and her perfectly pulled back, brown ponytail. But today? Today, he could tolerate her. He wanted to tolerate her, because Molly Hooper was the same age as he, and Molly Hooper would be going to the reaping too. And Molly Hooper's name could be drawn and he'd never see her again, besides the occasional glimpse throughout scenes that would flicker seemingly endlessly across a wide screen hologram, entertaining the Capitol. And – little thing like her – he'd probably be watching her die.
With a sigh, his small home coming into view, he turned to the small girl of whom had been his rather loquacious walking partner, and stopped walking, shrugging his shoulders her way before grunting, "I'm never having kids."
John blanched, and lifted his palms to his face, covering the wincing of his embarrassed features, “Christ, Molly.”
John glanced up at her, eyes narrowed as he watched her strangely innocent movements, the soft, harmless tone of her voice as she asked her
To his utter horror, John Watson laughed, a grin replacing his hurt expression, “What? You embarrassed of me?”
: Honestly, I’m a huge fan of theballetbee and I’m totally okay with this hashtag. I think it’s awesome what you did John, shouting him out like that, and its sparked something wonderful in your fans that people are talking about!
, he simply wanted to be sure Sherlock was taken care of, dressed in fresh clothes and warmed up until he was rosy cheeked.
Sherlock nodded and opened his mouth to say something else, only to be interrupted by the waitress setting their drinks down.
“I don’t know why you bother,” Sherlock uttered, that shield dropping just a tad as he faced his hands, of which sat folded in his lap, fingers fiddling, and, or so it seemed, trembling slightly.
And somehow, after some fiddling of the tourniquet and the awfully irritating inaccuracy of his shaking fingers, Sherlock was blissfully, and
Mum was fine with it, the whole sexuality thing - hell, she was the one who told the both of them, “
The high-pitched whirr of the coach’s whistle jogged him from his glaring, knocking all of the boys into action, leaping to their feet and beginning to spread out across the field as the Roach barked orders their way. John jogged to where he needed to be and gazed out at his teammates, suddenly loathing them all, suddenly wishing he were anywhere else but here. And, even as things were kicked into gear and the drill began, John continued to gaze with a look of resentment until, before he knew it, he had a face full of bad breath and fuzzy mustache.
John nodded, removing his hand from Sherlock’s thin frame as it began its usual routine of ‘clench, unclench, clench, unclench,’ and moving aside, growling under his breath and kicking at the ground with his sharp cleats, a chunk of grass flying upwards and plummeting noiselessly to the earth below once more.
John couldn’t help the enormous amount of giggles that came soaring from his chest, so loud and breathless that he had to cover his mouth with his hand, shaking his head in admiration before righting himself and smiling brightly, “You truly are a
“Sherlock,” John whispered, and Sherlock felt the blood in his veins flow cold when he turned and caught sight of what those eyes had so thoroughly latched onto. His black jumper was lifted just slightly, the pale complexion of one bony hip revealed, matted with black and blue, the aftermath of Sebastian Wilkes’ beating, a far worse conclusion than the one John had, apparently, come to imagine as just a split lip. Sherlock tugged the fabric back over the exposed skin.
It was safe to say Molly was perhaps even more obsessed than he was. He didn’t blame her, of course.
,” John chuckled quietly; the sound of his laugh moved through Sherlock’s brain like a hopeful melody echoing in an empty cathedral, ethereal and sacred. “I should’ve danced with you sooner.”
He heard her soft footsteps as she quickly jogged up next to him, joining in a steady pace by his side.
When he received no response, he swallowed and shut his eyes for a moment, repeating, softly, “I have nothing.”
“I’m absolute shite at explaining these kinds of things but,” John shrugged and turned back to face the ceiling, shutting his eyes and smiling, warm and genuine, “for some reason, now, everything seems even more surreal, even more magical.”
“You’re more of a slut than most of the girls at this school, Holmes,” Wilkes practically giggled, throwing his head back as though all of this was simply hilarious, as though the prospect of Sherlock ever finding someone to love was the funniest thing he’d heard in a long while.
With a growl and a shake of his head, he reached over and grasped his phone, tapping the screen lightly and wincing a bit as the bright light of the screen flashed before his eyes. He swallowed thickly at the message floating there, atop the blue of his plain, unimpressive screensaver, and the four letters that made up a name so very infuriating nowadays.
“Sorry?” John chuckled softly, glancing at each of the other boy’s who were simply grinning his way, waiting expectantly for where Greg intended to go with his arbitrary question.
Victor grabbed at his hand, yanking him back against his firm chest and laying a sloppy kiss to his lips, growling against Sherlock’s mouth, hands running down his torso, stroking his arms, caressing his waist.
“Definitely,” John grunted, turning to her over his shoulder and laughing softly, meandering over to the blue cabinet door and expertly entering his passcode, springing the lock into life as it opened, bearing his abhorrent number of books and excess, unnecessary items. Once he’d transferred over whatever he needed and didn't need, he slammed the door shut and lifted his backpack onto his back once more, approaching Molly of whom was still busy fumbling with her textbooks and notepads.
Sherlock then turned to John, watching as the dirty-blonde grabbed for the remaining apple atop his tray and turned to grasp his backpack, unzipping the front pocket and sliding the fruit inside. He then faced Sherlock, a smile gracing those plush lips, tan expression kind and gentle, eyes careful and warm, as he lifted a hand to fix where his hair had been shuffled to the side.
He turned to leave with those last few words on his tongue, only to stop and stare when the stranger on the floor finished his re-packing and stood up to face Sherlock —
Sherlock stroked his fingertips up alongside it, where the skin was reddened but not broken. "Hah, yes. Good to know I didn't forget my training." His fingers kept moving upward, over John's knee and up his thigh, against the grain of the hair, slow and exploratory. John's breath caught audibly. He could feel Sherlock's gaze like another hand as Sherlock's eyes tracked his own fingers up John's leg and continued on: up where John's shorts were distorted by the line of his cock, further to his rising and falling chest, his hot face. "
"Yeah," he sighed at the first touch of Sherlock's finger. "Yeah, just like -- wait, not yet, just -- stroke, yes, you'll feel when I'm ready -- all right, stop." Sherlock reared back, shocked, and John put a gentling hand on his arm. "Condom."
But it put him right back where he'd started from when John was in the room: The instant he wasn't alone, he'd go back to being so damned abnormally slow. People always thought they could tolerate that, but after a time it apparently began to wear on a person.
"Didn't," John said. "If the only consulting detective in the world can't keep track of his own cock, that's not my fault."
Sherlock turned to him, incredulous. "John," he said. "Think carefully. You could be free. You know what I am."
His climax, which had seemed imminent, even inevitable, now withdrew, making way for the vivid memory of the bleak and pleasureless minutes he'd spent chasing orgasm in the past, as his grip grew ever more uncomfortably tight and his partner's impatience grew more and more apparent, until coming was a chore from which all joy had fled.
Sherlock grinned breathlessly, watching, watching, lip caught in his teeth. He got hold of John's hip with one hand and lifted, rolling John's weight back onto his shoulders, and breathed, "What do you need?"
John could feel himself opening all at once -- god, so strange; he'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Sherlock drew in a noisy gasp. "Oh! does it hurt?"
He did love this, whether or not that made sense -- not just for the power but for the pure sensual overload of it. John was ordinarily noisy but wordless at this stage, but tonight he tugged gently on his handful of Sherlock's hair and said, "Thinking about me, were you?"
John's hair stood up in back. His eyes were heavy and his mouth wore the very same curling, self-satisfied smile that had, some months ago, made it impossible for Sherlock not to kiss him. He had tugged his pants back up, and he looked like any man. An attractive man; a pleasant man; at the moment a happy man; but not at all an extraordinary man.
it. Was John slow and luxuriant when he was alone, or hasty and businesslike? Did his neck and chest flush, as they did when he was with Sherlock? When he came, did he make that choked-off gasp that was so delightful? Sherlock loved to watch John, especially when he was greedy and demanding.
Sherlock took John's hip in a nice firm grip, and John only arched into it a little bit. "Is that why?"
Sherlock lay down beside him -- right way round this time -- and looked at his face from closer up, but nothing unusual revealed itself. "You've got a day off tomorrow, haven't you?"
And then he wanted to kiss John's slack mouth and withdraw to his own room and remember everything without haste for as long as it took and come like a nuclear bomb into his own patient, familiar fist.
He was limited by the flexibility of his wrists, and everything he tried was impossible to sustain, and the pleasure built but couldn't crest -- maddening -- irresistible. Alternating fingers was the only thing he could do and keep doing for any length of time, and it seemed his cock got more and more sensitive, and it wasn't enough, wasn't enough, he needed more -- "John," he said, and the note of plea in his voice was shocking.
"Yes," Sherlock gasped, and the next moment John's hand was on his cock and John's mouth was on his mouth and he came like a firecracker.
When he opened his eyes to gauge the effect, he was surprised to find John grinning. "Something amuses you?"
Sherlock could recall debacles that resulted from acquiescing to such a request, and also debacles that resulted from refusing it. "I'm not entertainment," he said, as he'd said to other men, though somehow because it was John there was less venom in it. "Trust me; I've got lots of experience in this. It will take too long, and you will get bored."
Sherlock set the empty bottle down and pulled the collar aside, and there it was, a red smudge -- smooth; at least it wasn't deep enough to bleed -- just in the hollow between Sherlock's collarbone and his neck, like a galaxy in a National Geographic photo all diagonal and fuzzy.
They were standing so close that John could feel Sherlock's chest expand with every inhale. "I expect we had a very good reason."
"Soon," John said in a note of dark and confident promise. "I just want you to tell me one thing. One thing, Sherlock, before I let you do as you like."
Something hurt, just a quick pang out in the unimportant extremities of his body, but he was close, he was close, he was
John pulled the bloodied jumper over his head and stuffed it between Sherlock's head and the side rails.
John, the utter bastard, yawned hugely and stretched, putting his sleep-flushed and slightly bitten torso on display. Sherlock was
Sherlock touching John was avid and curious and devastatingly observant. No surprises there. But Sherlock being touched was an unfamiliar creature. The most innocent touches made him writhe under John's hands, and more focused caresses made him all but stop breathing. John wanted him naked like his next breath.
"I have the oddest feeling that there ought to be someone there. And that there's something I ought to …” He lost the rest against the soft skin behind Sherlock’s ear. Why was he trying to talk when it was so lovely to lie pressed together like this, getting familiar with Sherlock's scars and freckles, waiting to be ready for another round, reveling in his good luck? One of John's favorite things. Waste of time at a moment like this, talking.
But as soon as John stood up, Sherlock began to frown, then to mutter, and then to struggle, even under heavy sedation. His jerky movements threatened to pull the IV out.
John wasn't a beauty like Sherlock, but he was built for endurance, and in action he knew he didn't disappoint. He knelt over Sherlock's reclining body, caging him in hands and knees, and Sherlock raised his face, straining up for the kiss, begging for it with his posture and the upward tilt of his beautiful mouth.
